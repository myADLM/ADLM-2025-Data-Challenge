L. Test Principle:
The ARCHITECT iDigoxin assay is a one-step STAT immunoassay for the
quantitative measurement of digoxin in human serum or plasma using CMIA
technology with flexible assay protocols, referred to as Chemiflex. Sample, anti-
digoxin coated paramagnetic microparticles, assay diluent, and digoxigenin
acridinium-labeled conjugate are combined to create a reaction mixture. The anti-
digoxin coated microparticles bind to digoxin present in the sample and to the
digoxigenin acridinium-labeled conjugate. After washing, pre-trigger and trigger
solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction
is measured as relative light units (RLUs). An indirect relationship exists between the
amount of digoxin in the sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT i
System optics
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
All performance characteristics were established on the ARCHITECT i2000
SR
system.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was performed with the ARCHITECT iDigoxin assay based on the
National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (CLSI EP5-A2
guideline).
Two ARCHITECT i 2000 Systems were used along with 2 lots of reagents
SR
and 2 lots of calibrators. The assay was run twice a day for 20 days using 3
Multi-constituent Controls and 3 human serum based panels in replicates of 2.
The 3 human serum based panels were prepared by adding digoxin
concentrations into a pool of human sera at final concentrations targeted at
0.80, 2.00 and 3.60 ng/mL.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Five pooled serum samples (1.80, 2.40, 3.00, 3.60 and 3.90 ng/mL) were
diluted manually with the ARCHITECT iDigoxin Calibrator A. Each sample
was diluted to have 11 concentration levels. Each sample was diluted using
the ARCHITECT iDigoxin Calibrator A. The concentration of digoxin was
determined using the ARCHITECT iDigoxin assay and the resulting percent
deviation from linearity or concentration difference was calculated. For
diluted samples reading above 1.0 ng/mL, the percent deviation from linearity
ranged from 4.0 to 8.8%. For diluted samples below 1.0 ng/mL, the
concentrations were within 0.1 ng/mL of the expected results. The regression
equations for the five samples are shown in the table below. The linear range
of the assay is 0.3 to 4.0 ng/mL.
Sample A (1.80 ng/mL) y = 0.9940x + 0.07
Sample B (2.40 ng/mL) y = 0.9845x + 0.07
Sample C (3.00 ng/mL) y = 0.9943x + 0.05

purified synthetic Digoxin from US Pharmacopeia (USP) Reference Standard
Digoxin. The ARCHITECT iDigoxin Calibrators are manufactured using
normal human serum and matched to the internal Reference Calibrators.
The normal human serum used in the calibrators has been tested by an FDA
approved method and found to be nonreactive for HIV-1/2 Antibody, HCV
Antibody, HTLV-1/2 Antibody, HBc Antibody and HBsAg.
Real time stability testing is ongoing. Based on accelerated stability results,
the data support an expiration date of 9 months for ARCHITECT iDigoxin
Calibrator Kits at 2-8ºC.
Open-vial real time stability testing for the calibrators is ongoing. Testing
currently supports a storage time of 4 months at 2-8ºC.
d. Detection limit:
A study was conducted to determine the limit of the blank (LoB) and the limit
of detection (LoD) for the ARCHITECT iDigoxin assay using the
ARCHITECT i2000 System following CLSI guideline 17-A. The
SR.
determinations were performed using one blank, assayed 60 times and four
samples containing low concentrations of digoxin assayed 15 times. The limit
of blank obtained was 0.07 ng/mL and limit of detection was 0.09 ng/mL.
A functional sensitivity study was performed using a series of seven samples
ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 ng/mL which were prepared by diluting Calibrator B
with Calibrator A. These samples were tested in replicates of ten two times
per day for five days using one reagent and calibrator lot for a total of 100
replicates per panel. The total % CVs were calculated and plotted against the
mean concentration. A reciprocal curve was fitted through the data, and the
functional sensitivity value was calculated as the concentration corresponding
to the 20% CV level of the fitted curve. At the upper 95% confidence limit,
the lowest ARCHITECT i Digoxin assay value exhibiting a 20% CV was
calculated to be 0.1 ng/mL, which is below the reportable range of the
ARCHITECT i Digoxin assay.
The measuring range is 0.3 to 4.0 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
A study was conducted to evaluate the potential interference from
triglycerides, hemoglobin, bilirubin, protein (low and high level), HAMA and
Rheumatoid Factor (RF) in the ARCHITECT iDigoxin assay using the
ARHITECT i 2000 system.
SR
Interference testing was performed on the ARCHITECT i System. Testing
8

--- Page 9 ---
was performed based on guidance from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute document CLSI Document EP7-A2.
No influence from the endogenous interfering substances tested was observed
during the study.
Five serum specimens with digoxin levels ranging from 0.35 to 2.84 ng/mL
were supplemented with the following potentially interfering compounds. The
mean recovery observed during the study ranged from 99.1% to 104.8%. The
following table is included in the reagent package insert. Results are shown
below:

Cross-reactivity was tested for the major digoxin active metabolites
(digoxigenin bis-digitoxoside, digoxigenin mono-digitoxoside, digoxigenin),
related compounds (acetyldigoxin, digitoxin, digitoxigenin, ouabain,
deslanoside, lanatoside C, proscillaridin) and other therapeutic agents that
may be co-administered to determine whether these compounds affect the
quantitation of digoxin concentrations using the ARCHITECT i Digoxin
assay. The compounds were spiked into a serum pool (control) containing no
digoxin and into two therapeutic levels (approximately 0.8 ng/mL and 2.0
ng/mL) of digoxin. The samples were assayed and the digoxin concentrations
of the spiked samples were compared to the control serum. The data are
summarized in the following table.

results. The amount of DLIF in these patient samples is extremely variable,
but in some cases these levels have been shown to approach concentrations
that are in the therapeutic range of digoxin. As with any assay employing
mouse antibodies, the possibility exists for interference by HAMA in the
sample, which could falsely elevate or depress results. The manufacturer of
Digoxin Immune Fab has stated that no immunoassay technique is suitable for
quantitating digoxin in serum from patients on antibody fragment therapy.
According to the manufacturer’s insert, DIGIBIND will interfere with digitalis
immunoassay measurements.”
“It has been reported in the literature that one in ten patients converts 40% or
more of oral digoxin to an inactive reduction product (dihydrodigoxin) via
bacteria in the gut. There is little or no cross-reactivity reported for
dihydrodigoxin.”

Each of the 20 sets of serum/plasma tubes were spiked with digoxin to
achieve 10 different spiking concentrations (0.30, 0.40, 0.60, 0.80, 1.20, 1.60,
2.00, 2.80, 3.20 and 3.60 ng/mL). Two tubes of each collecting tube type were
used for each spiking level. The results are provided in the following table:

The statement presented in the package insert is as follows:
“The ARCHITECT iDigoxin assay accurately quantitates digoxin concentrations
in human serum or plasma at concentrations up to 4.0 ng/mL. Numerous studies
have shown a relationship between serum levels of digoxin and its concentration
in myocardial and other tissues. Optimum therapeutic effects usually are observed

when serum levels are in the range from 0.8 to 2.0 ng/mL based on
radioimmunoassay, although some clinical benefit may be realized at serum or
plasma concentrations below 0.8 ng/mL. The risk of toxicity increases at serum or
plasma levels above 2.0 ng/mL. Symptoms of digoxin toxicity may include
gastrointestinal disturbances such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea,
central nervous system disturbances manifested by blurred or yellow vision,
headache, weakness, dizziness, apathy, and confusion, and cardiac rhythm
disturbances and tachycardia. There is some evidence that children may tolerate
slightly higher serum or plasma concentrations than adults. It is important to note
that the distinction between adequate digitalization and toxicity in patients cannot
be made on the basis of digoxin concentrations alone. Most studies show a
significant overlap between the toxic and nontoxic groups. Additional factors to
consider when evaluating the correct therapeutic dosage for each patient are lean
body weight, age, renal function, concomitant disease states, concurrent
medications, and other clinical factors.”
The literature references are provided in the package insert for the statements
above.
