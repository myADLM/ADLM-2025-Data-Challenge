L. Test Principle:
The DS-A Draw-In Blood Glucose Test Strips use the reaction of glucose oxidase (GOD)
with capillary whole blood glucose to form gluconic acid. This, in turn reacts with potassium
ferricyanide on the strips to form ferricyanide. During this reaction, electrons are released
which generate a current proportional to the concentration of glucose present in the sample.
The DS-A Blood Glucose Meter uses amperometric biosensor technology to convert the
electronic signal to concentration which is displayed on the meter. The meter is calibrated by
inserting a lot specific calibration strip into the meter prior to starting a new box of test strips.
This is provided in each box of test strips.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability studies were conducted using venous blood samples with target
concentrations of 40 mg/dL, 80 mg/dL, 120 mg/dL 200 mg/dL and 300 mg/dL.
Concentrations were confirmed on the Yellow Springs analyzer (YSI). Within-run
precision was determined by analyzing each sample 40 times on each of 3 lots of
strips. The summary of all lots is below

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Five venous whole blood samples were spiked with glucose to cover the measuring
range of 20-600 mg/dL, and evaluated 20 times per sample on the DSA Blood
Glucose meter and the YSI analyzer. Values ranged from 21-590 mg/dL. Each
sample was analyzed on 5 A-Check DS-A meters with 2 lots of test strips. Linear
regressions for each strip lot compared to the YSI are below:
Lot Slope Intercept r R2
1 1.02 -2.1 mg/dL 0.996 0.993
2 1.01 2.5 mg/dL 0.997 0.994
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There are three levels of Quality Control material available for separate purchase.
They cover the low, middle and high glucose range. The mid-range control is
included with each test kit.
Traceability
1) Traceability: The DS-A-CHECK meter is compared to the YSI 2300 Glucose
Analyzer in the accuracy studies below. The YSI is calibrated with NIST (SRM)
917a reference material. Quality control material is gravimetrically prepared and
assayed on the DS-A-Check meters in multiple runs to establish ranges. Control
ranges are included on each vial of test strips.
Stability
1) Accelerated and real-time temperature and humidity studies for the DS-A Draw-
In Test Strips were conducted to determine closed and open vial test strip stability
and to verify performance of the meter and strips at temperatures of 0° C-40° C.
Real time studies were conducted for 19 months. Closed vial stability is 18
months at 24°C ± 3°C and 60% ± 10% relative humidity. Open vial strip stability
is 90 days at 4-32° C at 80% relative humidity. Recommended operating
temperatures are 14° C-40° C.
2) Alliance Blood Glucose Control Solutions stability studies were conducted in real
time. Closed vial stability at 23°C to 27°C is 18 months. Open vial stability
studies were performed at 20° C, 25° C and 30° C. Open vial stability for 20° C-
30° C is 90 days.
Calibration
The meter is factory calibrated but each vial of test strips has a calibration card
containing the calibration coefficients for each lot of test strips. The Operator’s
Manual instructs the user to load the calibration card for each test vial prior to using

the strips in a new vial. The lot number displayed on the meter after loading the
calibration card must match the lot number on the strip vial. If there is no match, an
error message is generated and no glucose result is displayed.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit is 20 mg/dL as described is section M.1.b. above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous and Exogenous Interference
Endogenous and exogenous substances were analyzed at two concentrations of
glucose and interferent according to CLSI EP 7. Each concentration of interferent
was added to whole blood samples whose glucose concentrations had been adjusted
to between 100-150 mg/dL, and 200-250 mg/dL as measured on the YSI 2300
analyzer. The sponsor defined no significant interference as less than 10%
interference when compared to the control pools with no interferents added. Results
are summarized below.

Hematocrit
Six whole blood samples with hematocrits ranging from 30% - 55% were tested at
four different glucose concentrations of approximately 50 mg/dL to 500 mg/dL
against the YSI. The percent differences of the DS-A glucose results at each
hematocrit level were calculated against the YSI glucose results at 40% hematocrit.
The sponsor demonstrated that for each level of hematocrit there was ≤ 12%
difference across the entire glucose range. A caution about using samples with <
30% or > 55% is stated in the labeling.
Altitude Studies
Altitude studies were performed using five whole blood samples with glucose
concentrations from 52-498 mg/dL as determined on the YSI 2300. Each sample was
tested in duplicate on six meters and 1 lot of test strips at 6 altitudes. Values were
compared to the YSI 2300 (see chart below) The sponsor demonstrated a <16% CV
for all samples across all lots on the DS-A-CHECK for glucose concentrations

2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes __X__ or No ______
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger. Since the
whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip there are no special handling or
storage issues.
5. Calibration:
Strip lot-specific calibration is accomplished by inserting a calibration card, which comes
with each vial of DS-A-Draw-In test strips, into the DS-A-CHECK meter. The meter
records the calibration coefficients and the strip lot number. When the test strip is
inserted into the meter, the meter detects the lot number and matches it to the information
from the calibration card.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor has three levels of controls which are purchased separately. The mid range
control is included with the kit. When a test strip is inserted into the meter, a control can
be analyzed. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the individual
control vial labels. The user is referred to a troubleshooting section at the end of the
control test instructions of the owner’s manual to identify possible reasons control results
fall outside these ranges and is instructed to contact Customer Assistance or their health
care provider.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
An ease of use study was conducted with 150 lay users who collected and analyzed their
own fingerstick samples using only the labeling for guidance. See section M. 3. c for
their results compared to a reference method. They were also given a survey of 12
questions to evaluate their comprehension of the written materials. On a scale of 1-5 with
5 being the easiest to use or understand, the results ranged from 4.34 for the clarity of the
illustrations, to 4.89 for the overall design.
