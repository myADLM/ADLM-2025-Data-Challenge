L. Test Principle:
S-Test CRP – CRP in the sample causes an antigen-antibody reaction with antihuman
C-reactive protein mouse monoclonal antibody-coated latex particles, resulting in
agglutination. The C-reactive protein concentration is determined by measuring this
agglutination by measuring the absorbance change. The rate of increase in
absorbance, monitored bi-chromatically at 570 nm/800 nm, is directly proportional to
the C-Reactive Protein concentration in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Three serum samples (with normal, intermediate and elevated levels) were
tested for CRP on two S40 Clinical Analyzers two times per run, two runs per
day, for a total of 24 days. The mean, standard deviations, and % coefficients
of variation (CV) were calculated for each sample.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The reportable range is 5 to 98 mg/L. The assay is linear from 5 to 98 mg/L on
the S40 Clinical Analyzer. If a sample result is less than 5 mg/L, the result is
flagged by the analyzer as <5 mg/L. If a sample result exceeds 98 mg/L, the
result is flagged by the analyzer as >98 mg/L. This range is supported by the
limit of detection study (section M.1.d below), the method comparison
(section M.2.a below), and the linearity study shown below.

Linearity across the assay range was confirmed by testing commercial
linearity standards at 12 levels ranging from 4.9 mg/L to 98.5 mg/L. Each
level was tested in replicates of four. The percent recoveries ranged from 95.7
to 106.1%. The linear regression equation obtained for the study was y =
1.035x – 0.160, r2 = 0.9982
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The S Test-CRP cartridges are factory calibrated and traceable to the Institute
for Reference Material and Measurement (IRMM) Standard Reference
Material CRM470. The 2-D barcode printed on each cartridge provides the
analyzer with lot-specific calibration data.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank and Limit of Detection were determined by assaying low
samples (5 serum samples were used) and blank samples (bovine serum
albumin in saline). Both the low samples (60 reps, 20 reps per day) and the
blanks were assayed each day (5 different samples, 4 reps on 3 days, total n =
60 low samples and 60 blank samples). The testing was split between two
instruments. The limit of detection was determined to be 2 mg/L. The assay
reportable range is from 5 to 98 mg/L on the S40 Clinical Analyzer. If a
sample result is less than 5 mg/L, the result is flagged by the analyzer as <5
mg/L. If a sample result exceeds 98 mg/L, the result is flagged by the analyzer
as >98 mg/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies to determine the effects of Unconjugated Bilirubin,
Hemolysis and Lipemia were performed. Serum pools containing 8 mg/L CRP
and 21 mg/L CRP were spiked with various concentrations of unconjugated
bilirubin (1.6 - 50 mg/dL), hemoglobin (31-1000 mg/dL) and Intralipid (63 -
2000 mg/dL). The sponsor states that interference is considered to be
significant if the analyte recovery changes by more than ±10%. There was no
significant interference observed from bilirubin, lipemia, or hemolysis at the
tested concentrations.

Not applicable

A series of 95 serum specimens with CRP values ranging from 5 to 91 mg/L
were assayed in singlicate on the S40 Clinical Analyzer using S-Test CRP
Reagent and Olympus AU640 Analyzer as the reference method. Least-
squares regression analysis (Deming) yielded the following results:

Performance for the S-Test CRP was evaluated at three Physician Office
Laboratories and with a total of three operators. Operators assayed unaltered
clinical serum samples with values ranging from 5 - 88 mg/L. The correlation

b. Matrix comparison:
A study was performed on the S40 by running CRP determinations on 22
paired samples drawn from the same patients in serum and heparin plasma
tubes at four POL labs and at a clinical laboratory. The serum results ranged
