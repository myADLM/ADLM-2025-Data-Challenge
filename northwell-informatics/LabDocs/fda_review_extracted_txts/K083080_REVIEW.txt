4. Special instrument requirements:
SQiDworks™ Diagnostics Platform
I. Device Description:
The IgX PLEX Rheumatoid Arthritis Qualitative Assay is supplied as two boxes requiring
separate storage conditions: the Refrigerator Box must be refrigerated at 2-8ºC, and the
Freezer Box must be stored in a -15ºC or lower freezer. A microarray plate and wash buffer
concentrate are stored refrigerated while the Reporter mix, Calibrators, Positive Control #1,
Positive Control #2, Negative Control, and Sample Diluent are stored refrigerated. The
microarray plate consists of an array of protein and antibody replicate spots, covalently
bound to the surface of coated glass within each well of a standard 96-well assay plate. All
plates have the identical configuration of microarray elements, containing:
• 21 capture spots for Rheumatoid Factor Fcs and 21 capture spots for anti-CCP
antibodies.
• Internal normalization curve and control spots for internal consistency
confirmation.
The outer plate holder is labeled with a barcode indicating the assay type and lot number
which is read by the platform. The reporter mix is comprised of diluted fluorescently labeled
mouse monoclonal antibodies to human immunoglobulin G, A and M (marker antibody).
Each type of marker antibody is labeled with a dye in a different spectral range allowing for
the detection of both sub-classes of RF in one well; CCP is detected with a different dye in
different wells. Each signal is analyzed to provide the end result for each analyte. The
system reports each result independently.
The SQiDworks Diagnostics Platform is a multiplex immunoassay instrument that fully
automates the process of a specific IgX PLEX Assay from serum transfer to reporting of all
assay markers for each individual patient sample. The instrument automates the entire
immunoassay protocol from end-to-end including sample pipetting, serum dilution,
incubation, washing, and drying. Once the assay’s biochemical reactions have completed, the
instrument automatically performs a multi-color fluorescent scan of each well in the
microarray, analyzes the data, and generates a report containing results for all assay markers.
The SQiDworks Diagnostics Platform also includes numerous internal quality checks and
user safety features with fail-safe and interlock mechanisms.
The instrument integrates an automated pipetting station, a fluorescent scanner, washing and
drying stations, and other ancillary hardware components using dedicated instrument control.
In addition, the software provides scheduling, self-verification, data acquisition, data
management, analysis algorithms and reporting software.

L. Test Principle:
RF antibodies as well as any anti-CCP antibodies present in the serum sample or control
materials bind to immobilized human IgG Fc fragments or the cyclic citrullinated peptide
respectively to form antigen-antibody complexes. Unbound antibody and other substances in
the sample are washed from the wells. Next, anti-human IgA, anti-human IgG, and anti-
human IgM antibodies labeled with fluorescent dye are added as a mix. Excess reporter
antibodies are washed away, and excess wash buffer is removed from the wells. Each well is
scanned for each of the three dye wavelengths. The intensity of the generated signal is
proportional to the amount of IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies bound to the printed spots in the
wells.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the four assays was determined by choosing clinical samples
that were negative, slightly below the assay cutoff, slightly above the assay cutoff, or
well above the cutoff for each assay. The positive samples were from rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) patients diagnosed using the established American College of

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators: The external calibrators (standards) are eight dilutions of a sample
derived from human sera containing an appropriate representation of each of the
analytes to be reported. The assay standards (secondary standards) for RF (IgA, and
IgM) are traceable to the WHO/First British Standard 64/2 (primary standards) and
internally calculated in IU/mL. The CCP IgG results are internally calculated in
U/mL and are comparable to other assays on the market. The quantitative results are
converted to qualitative results (positive and negative), based on assay-specific cutoff
values. No dilutions or reconstitutions are needed.
Controls: The positive and negative control samples are derived from human sera
clinically diagnosed as positive and normal respectively. The platform treats the
controls as samples and does not perform any quality assessment based on the results.
Although expected results for each applicable analyte of each control are provided,
each lab is expected to follow their own quality procedures for assessing controls.
A real-time stability study is on-going. Current data supports a three-month shelf life.
Serum samples were found stable at room temperature for 6 hours and for 1 week at
4ºC.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable for qualitative assays.
e. Analytical specificity:
Several RA samples with low or intermediate levels were evaluated with different
levels of endogenous interferents above physiological ranges. The table below lists
the levels (mg/mL) of interferents at which the bias relative to the unspiked sample is
< ±15%:
Bilirubin Hemoglobin Triglycerides Human IgG
mg/mL
RF IgA 3 25 100 10
RF IgM 1.2 12.5 12.5 1.3
CCP IgG 3 100 100 10
f. Assay cut-off:
The sponsor established the cutoffs of the assays using an ROC analysis of a data set
consisting of serum specimens from 135 rheumatoid arthritis patients and 150 normal
donors (n=285) collected from commercial sources representative of the United
States, Canadian and European populations, along with the corresponding clinical and
demographic information. These samples were not included in any other analysis
(method comparison or clinical study).

The ROC analysis provided a list of potential cut-off values with sensitivity and
specificity calculated for each. The sponsor examined the proposed values which had
balanced sensitivity and specificity and then chose the one with the best confidence
interval and accuracy. The chosen cut-offs were: 12.0 IU/mL for RF IgA, 18.2 IU/mL
for RF IgM, and 11.7 U/mL for CCP IgG.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Concordance between the IgX PLEX RA Assays and the predicate methods was
calculated using 2x2 comparison tables with determination of positive percent
agreement, negative percent agreement, and overall agreement, based on the cut-off
level for each assay system. 350 clinical specimens were used; 250 patients
diagnosed with RA according to ACR criteria and 100 normal donors. Two results
were invalidated due to a within-well normalization failure.

3. Clinical studies:
The objective of this study was to establish the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the
IgX PLEX RA assay, which detects RF IgA, RF IgM, and CCP IgG in serum samples.
The clinical sensitivity and specificity were calculated by comparing the IgX PLEX RA
assay result interpretations to the clinical diagnosis categories of RA patients,
presumptive normal samples, and patients with other diseases both autoimmune and non-
autoimmune. The available clinical diagnosis for the RA patients was defined by ACR
criteria.
909 clinical specimens, collected from 360 patients with RA, 399 patients with other
diseases—both autoimmune and otherwise—and 150 presumptively normal donors. Of
the 909 samples assayed, 14 were invalidated by the system for various reasons,
predominately because of within well normalization failure. Therefore 895 clinical
samples were available for analysis.
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
358 RA samples were available for calculation of clinical sensitivity:
TP FN Sensitivity +/- 95% CI
IgX PLEX RF IgA 306 52 85.5% 83.6% - 87.3%
IgX PLEX RF IgM 334 24 93.3% 92.0% - 94.6%
IgX PLEX anti-CCP 278 80 77.7% 75.5% - 79.9%
b. Clinical specificity:
Normal samples and samples from other diseases and conditions were tested (number
in parentheses): Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (43), Sjogren’s Syndrome (26).
MCTD (43), Progressive Systemic Sclerosis (53), Arthropathies (26), Osteoarthritis
(43), Joint Pain, CTS (37). Myalgia & Myositis (38), Vasculitis (17). Other
Autoimmune Diseases (61).

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected value in the normal population is negative. However, apparently healthy
asymptomatic individuals may have RF, usually of low titer. RF titers are also
occasionally seen in other autoimmune diseases than RA. Anti-CCP antibodies appear to
be fairly specific for RA although, as with most autoantibodies, some apparently healthy
individuals are anti-CCP positive. The incidence of false positives to all three analytes
increases with age and is similar in females and males.

5. Calibration:
Normalization of the captured signal intensity occurs in each well to bring all reaction
results to an internally calibrated value (AEC). This process is used to normalize
variances in assay kinetics and minor inter-lot variances between the microarray wells.
Standardization then occurs at the plate level using eight defined assay standards
(calibrators) provided with the assay. Patient sample results are then calculated from this
standard curve. The value is compared to the cut-off and a determination of positive or
negative is made.
6. Quality Control:
A set of internal quality control rules are invoked to evaluate the data that is produced.
These rules were identified by safety and hazard analysis to mitigate risks such as
missing human sera and general failures in the reaction. They include quality control
rules for checking the fitness of the normalization and standardization curves, as well as
thresholds of controls measuring reporter activity and human sera presence. When data is
found that does not fit the required control levels or rules, further processing of the data is
halted and the value “No Result” is reported. The internal quality control rules, or
invalidation rules, are at each level of data processing. Single analyte results may be
invalidated due to high CV of the replicate capture spots, results for a well may be
invalidated due to improper normalization curve or control threshold, and results for an
analyte may be invalidated due to an improper standardization curve.
