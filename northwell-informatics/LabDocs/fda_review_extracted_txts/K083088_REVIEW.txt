Negative results do not preclude influenza virus or RSV infection and should not be used as the
sole basis for treatment or other management decisions. It is recommended that negative test
results be confirmed by culture.
Performance characteristics for Influenza A Virus were established when Influenza A/H3 and
A/H1 were the predominant Influenza A viruses in circulation. When other Influenza A viruses
are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.
If infections with a novel Influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should
be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent Influenza viruses
and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in
these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

4. Special instrument requirements:
Verigene® System consisting of the Verigene Processor (software version 0.7) and the
Verigene Reader (software version 1.5)
I. Device Description:
The Verigene® Respiratory Virus Nucleic Acid Test (VRNAT) is a set of reagents and supplies
designed to be utilized in RT-PCR and hybridization assay using the Verigene® instrument
system for detection and identification of human influenza A, influenza B, and RSV viral RNA.
The VRNAT primers target matrix (M) gene of influenza A, non structural (NS) and M genes of
influenza B, and L gene and F gene of RSV. The amplicons are hybridized to gold nanoparticle
probes through a mediator oligonucleotide and target-specific capture oligonucleotides on a
microarray-based chip in a disposable test cartridge. The signal enhanced with elemental silver
at the test site is detected using the Verigene Processor.
The VRNAT also includes control materials:
Internal Positive Control
The internal positive control (PC) refers to a set of ‘capture’ oligonucleotides on the test
microarray that directly hybridize to a specific gold nanoparticle probe present in the Reagent
Pack of each Test Cartridge. The PC spots are further amplified during the silver amplification
step.
Internal Negative Control
The internal negative control (NC) refers to a set of oligonucleotides on the test microarray that
have no significant homology to Influenza A, Influenza B, and RSV sequences available in public
2

databases.
Inhibition Control
Inhibition Control (PC1) or positive amplification control is diagnostic of potential inhibition
effects during the target amplification step. It is a synthetic DNA construct designed to act
as an artificial target within the VRNAT. It is included in the Primer Mix along with PC1-
specific forward and reverse primer. The PC1 target binds specifically to a capture spot on
the test chip and the Verigene Reader analyzes the PC1 signal.
Process Control
The process control (PC2) is an intact MS2 bacteriophage and therefore controls for the
nucleic acid extraction step and the target amplification or the RT-PCR step. In the VRNAT,
isolated MS2 bacteriophage RNA is amplified in the RT-PCR step by virus-specific primers.
The amplicon is then mixed with the target buffer containing MS2-specific mediators, it binds
to the MS2-specific capture spot and to the probe via the mediator oligonucleotide, and is
detected in the Verigene® system.

amplified in a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The amplicons are mixed with a
sample buffer containing target-specific mediator oligonucleotides and applied to the Test
Substrate on a microarray chip in a disposable test cartridge. The cartridge is inserted into the
Verigene Processor. The mediator oligonucleotides are chimeras with one part complementary
to the target and another part complementary to the Universal Gold Nanoparticle Probe. The
Probe mix is added to form the capture-target-mediator-Gold Nanoparticle Probe complex. The
signal is amplified by deposition of elemental silver at the test sites to generate nanoscopic gold-
silver aggregates which are illuminated and the light scatter is measured. The test results are
analyzed in the Verigene Reader.
Interpretation of Results:
The Verigene System software automatically determines the specimen results for influenza A
virus, influenza B virus, and RSV. The test is designed to provide a “Detected” or “Not
Detected” decision for each of the three viruses evaluated in each test sample. A valid ‘call’ is
made only when both inhibition control and process control are ‘Detected’ during analysis of
each test signifying that the extraction and target amplification processes performed correctly.
Failure of the system, cartridge or sample to produce a test result of “Detected” or “Not
Detected” for one or more of the targeted viral agents can produce a “No call” result. The
descriptions of possible “No call” results with the recommended recourse to be taken can be
found in the table below:

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The Verigene® Respiratory Virus Nucleic Acid Test reproducibility study was performed at
each of three sites. Eight unique samples were created by diluting known concentrations of
viral particles with Viral Transport Medium. The following strains representing Influenza A,
Influenza B, RSV A, and RSV B were used to prepare the samples: Influenza
A/Wisconsin/67/2005; Influenza B/ Florida/04/2006; RSV A Strain Long; RSV B Strain B-1
Wild Type (B WV/14617/85). Each strain was represented at 3 distinct concentrations: high
negative, low positive, and moderate positive.
Unique
Viral Strains and Levels
Samples
1 Influenza A - High Negative; Influenza B - High Negative
2 RSV A - High Negative; RSV B - High Negative
3 Influenza A - Low Positive
4 Influenza B - Low Positive
5 RSV A - Low Positive
6 RSV B - Low Positive
7 Influenza A - Moderate Positive; RSV A - Moderate Positive
8 Influenza B - Moderate Positive; RSV B - Moderate Positive
At Site 1, the reproducibility study was part of a larger precision study (see below) which used
the same set of 8 samples and was performed over 12 non-consecutive days. On each test day,
two operators performed in duplicate the VRNAT, involving sample isolation, target
amplification, and the Verigene Test. In the reproducibility study performed at sites 2 and 3, the
samples were analyzed on the Verigene System in triplicate daily by 2 operators on each of five
non-consecutive days after undergoing sample isolation and target amplification.
In the ‘Reproducibility and Precision’ studies, the moderate positive samples served as positive
controls since they were expected to provide positive decisions 100% of the time. The same
samples also served as negative controls; ‘Not Detected’ decisions were expected at Influenza B
and RSV B in the moderate positive samples containing Influenza A and RSV A and conversely
‘Not Detected’ decisions were expected at Influenza A and RSV A in the moderate positive
samples containing Influenza B and RSV B. The positive and negative controls provided
expected decisions during the studies.

The Verigene System quality control regimen rests on the foundation of a system design that
reduces the probability for errors and includes a unit-use disposable Test Cartridge
containing all the reagents needed to run a single test:
• A series of automated on-line quality measurements that monitor instrument
functionality, software performance, fluidics, test conditions, reagent integrity, and
procedural steps in each assay each time a test is performed.
• A series of automated on-line procedural checks guide the user each time a test is
performed.
• Several layers of controls built into the VRNAT ensure that failures at any step within the
VRNAT are identified in the end-point image analysis of the Test Cartridge.

process and tested in triplicate at each dilution level for each virus. The limit of detection
defined as the lowest concentration at which ≥95% of the replicates tested positive, was
assessed based on the performance of the samples within each dilution series as judged by
the Verigene calls. This LoD was confirmed by testing an additional 20 replicates for each
strain in order to demonstrate that the virus was detected ≥95% of the time.

1) Reactivity/Inclusivity
The analytical reactivity was evaluated against strains of Influenza A, Influenza B, RSV A,
and RSV B that are representative of temporal and geographical diversity. Known
concentrations of the viral strains grown in culture were diluted in sample matrix (Universal
Transport Media, Copan) to achieve the titers listed in the table below. A total of 14 strains
for Influenza A, 10 strains for influenza B, and five (5) RSV strains were tested in triplicate
at 100 TCID /mL. All viral cultures were detected; the VRNAT analytical reactivity
50
demonstrated 100% concordance with expected results for all primer and probe sets included
in the device.

Cross-Reactivity Evaluation
Analytical specificity (cross-reactivity) studies were performed to assess potential cross-
reactivity of the VRNAT with common respiratory pathogens and other microorganisms
commonly present in specimens collected from the nasopharynx. A total of 38 organisms of
interest were identified as respiratory pathogens with which the majority of the population
may be infected. These included 15 viruses and 23 bacterial strains which were propagated
and the titers were determined. To assess cross-reactivity, each organism was diluted in a
sample matrix (Universal Transport Medium, Copan) to the concentration listed in the table
below and taken through all the steps of the VRNAT protocol.

None of the organisms tested interfered with the internal controls. For all the organisms
tested in the VRNAT for cross-reactivity ‘Not Detected’ calls were made by the Verigene
Reader for each of the three viruses in the VRNAT, Influenza A, Influenza B, and RSV. No
cross-reactivity was observed with the common respiratory pathogens and organisms
infecting the majority of the population.
f. Assay cut-off:
The Verigene Respiratory Virus Nucleic Acid Test (VRNAT) uses a microarray-based
platform in which the viruses and the inhibition control (PC1) and process control (PC2) are
represented by recognition elements on the Test Substrate. The recognition elements are
virus-specific oligonucleotides that bind to the amplified viral targets, which in turn bind to
gold nanoparticle probes via additional recognition elements. A gold nanoparticle probe-
specific signal enhancement reaction deposits silver at the virus-specific spots. The scatter
from the spots is detected by the Verigene Reader and registered as signal intensity. In
addition to the above recognition elements, the Test Substrate has spots specific to positive
control (PC) and negative control (NC). Three conditions were identified that together
served as a single set of clinical cutoff criteria.
Condition 1: Noise Threshold
Condition 2: Normalized ‘Ratio to Negative Control’ (Ratio-to-NC) – intensity at the virus-
specific recognition element normalized against the intensity values at the negative control
elements.
Condition 3: Normalized ‘Ratio to Positive Control’ (Ratio-to-PC) – intensity at the virus-
specific recognition element normalized against the intensity values at the positive control
elements.
The Noise Threshold was determined empirically to be equal to Negative Control + 2 SD.
The cut-offs for the normalized ratios, ‘Ratio-to-NC’ and the ‘Ratio-to-PC’, were determined
by using ROC curves. For a positive ‘Detected’ decision the following criteria apply:
Condition 1: Signal intensity is above the noise threshold
Condition 2: Ratio-to-NC is above 0.85
Condition 3: Ratio-to-PC is above -0.4
If any one of these criteria is not met, a negative ‘Not Detected’ decision is provided. If the
Ratio-to-PC for any one of the three viruses falls between -0.4 and -0.5, an equivocal (i.e.,
No Call – IND ZONE) decision is provided. Criteria set for each of the three conditions are

required to be met for a ‘Detected’ call.
VRNAT Decision Process
For a result, the decision tree examines the presence of both PC1 and PC2 initially (see
Schematic). Both PC1 and PC2 signal intensities have to meet the detection criteria before
the analysis is allowed to proceed toward establishing the presence or absence (i.e.,
“Detected” or “Not Detected”) of the individual viruses.

3. Clinical studies:
Performance characteristics of the Verigene® Respiratory Virus Nucleic Acid Test were
established during a prospective study during the 2007-2008 respiratory virus season. A total
of 720 nasopharyngeal swab specimens were prospectively collected for routine influenza or
RSV testing by DFA/culture methods. The residual specimens were frozen and later tested at
three clinical sites, 240 at each site, using the Verigene® Respiratory Virus Nucleic Acid
Test. The patient population was distributed by age as presented in the table below:
Patient Population by Number of
Age Subjects
0 – 1 120
1 – 5 229
5 – 20 129
20 – 65 204
>65 38
Total 720
The VRNAT performance was compared to a culture-based reference method followed by
direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) identification of all culture positive samples. Samples
which demonstrated discordant results between the VRNAT and the reference method were
further analyzed by using bi-directional sequencing at an independent reference laboratory.
A total of 21 samples (2.9%) generated a “No Call” result; ten (10) of the samples (1.4%)
gave a ‘No Call – Indeterminate Zone’ result indicating an equivocal call. Another eleven
(11) samples (1.5%) gave a ‘No Call – Pos Ctrl’ call indicating an inability to detect an
internal control. All the samples with an initial ‘No Call’ result were re-tested and resolved
successfully by following the recommendations in the ‘Results Interpretation’ section (see
above).

Dual Infections
Of the 720 samples included in the clinical study, 12 samples were positive for 2 infections
by the VRNAT, translating to 1.7% of the samples tested. Comparable RT-PCR—based
real-time detection methods have reported a significantly lower percentage for dual
infections (~0.1%). Two inter-related factors may contribute to the higher percentage of the
dual infections observed in the VRNAT. Competitive inhibition is often observed in dual
infections, especially when one infective agent is at a much lower initial concentration
resulting thereby in amplicons below the detection limits of fluorescence-based methods.

During the 2005-2006 flu season, 12% of 148,636 samples tested for influenza were positive
for either Influenza A or Influenza B [based on data from laboratories in the US which
collaborated with World Health Organization (WHO) and National Respiratory and Enteric
Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS)]. During the 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 flu seasons,
the prevalence was 13% of 179,268 samples tested and 18% of 225,329 samples tested,
respectively.
According to data reported to the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance
System (NREVSS), the prevalence of RSV was 16% in the 120,503 samples tested for RSV
during the 2005-2006 season and 17% of the 126,617 samples tested during the 2006-2007
season.
In the Verigene Respiratory Virus Nucleic Acid Test multi-site study, which analyzed 720
samples collected during the 2007 – 2008 flu season, the prevalence of Influenza A observed
by culture and DFA was 17.1%, of Influenza B was 4.3%, and of RSV 6.8%. By VRNAT,
of the set of 720 samples, 25.0% were positive for Influenza A, 4.0% were positive for
Influenza B, and 14.0% were positive for RSV. While no dual infections were detected by
culture and DFA, the VRNAT detected 12 dual infections or 1.7% (see “Dual Infections” in
the Performance Characteristics section). Because the incidence of a triple infection of
Influenza A, Influenza B, and RSV is low, it is recommended that the samples undergo
repeat testing if nucleic acids from all three analytes are detected in a single sample.
