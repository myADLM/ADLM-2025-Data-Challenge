K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None Referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The EliA™ wells are coated with a specific antigen. If antibodies that recognize that specific
antigen are present in the patient’s specimen they will bind. After washing away non-bound
antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgG antibodies EliA™ IgG conjugate
are added to form antibody-conjugate complexes. After incubation, non-bound conjugates are
washed away and the bound complexes are incubated with a development solution. After
stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the reaction mixture is measured. The higher the
response value, the more specific IgG is present in the specimen. To evaluate test results, the
response for patient samples is compared directly to the response for calibrators. The EliA™
IgG calibration is a total IgG calibration. It is based on a set of six WHO-standardized IgG
calibrators derived from human serum. The calibrators are required to perform an initial
calibration curve, which can be stored in the ImmunoCAP instrument and may be used up to
28 days. Each assay outside of a calibration run includes curve controls that have to fall
within defined ranges to verify that the stored calibration curve is still valid.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Imprecision of the assays on the ImmunoCap 100 instrument was assessed by testing
three serum samples with six replicates each, over 18 runs (3 instruments x 6 runs
each, n = 108 replicates per sample). Imprecision of the assays on the ImmunoCap
250 instrument was assessed by testing three serum samples in triplicate over 21 runs
(3 instruments x 7 runs each, n = 63 replicates per sample). A separate calibration
curve was performed with each run.

Diluent and the results are shown below. The samples were tested in two runs with
three replicates and two replicates of the curve controls. The Observed/Expected
(O/E)-values of the three samples for RNP70 were within the specifications. Not all
O/E-values of the three samples for Scl-70 and Jo-1 were within the specifications
(0.8 > O/E < 1.2) (out of specification values are highlighted in grey). However, due
to differing binding characteristics of the antibodies in patient samples, not all sera
can be diluted linearly within the measuring range.

The measuring range (detection limit, upper limit) for EliA™ RNP70 and Jo-1 is
from 0.3 to ≥ 240 EliA U/mL, and for Scl-70 is 0.4 - ≥ 320 EliA U/mL. The
measuring range for each analyte is claimed from the detection limit to upper limit
and is defined by the formula: (highest calibrator point) x (conversion factor from
reference batches) x (factor to assure a minimum of measuring range). The EliA
system measuring range is fixed and given in µg/L from 0-600µg/L. However, the
use of batch specific factors will convert the different upper limits of the measuring
ranges to? U/mL. The conversion factors from reference batches are: 0.5 for EliA
RNP70 and EliA Jo-1, and 0.66 for EliA Scl-70.
The lot specific factor is determined on reference batches in a way that the cut-off,
(which was determined in µg/L) is assigned the value of 10 EliA U/mL for all EliA
ANA tests. In routine production new batches are compared with reference batches
and if a difference is seen, then the batch-specific conversion factor is adjusted so that
the cut-off remains at 10 EliA U/mL.
The factor to assure a minimum of measuring range is set at 0.8 for EliA RNP70,
EliA Scl-70 and EliA Jo-1. Due to the batch-specific conversion factors, it is not
possible to determine a fixed upper limit for the measuring range and it is noted in the
labeling that the upper limit of the reported results can vary due to a lot-specific

conversion from μg/L to EliA U/mL. Results above the stated upper limit are
reported as “above”. They also state that due to differing binding characteristics of the
antibodies in patient samples, not all sera can be diluted linearly within the measuring
range.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
IgG calibrators are traceable (via an unbroken chain of calibrations) to the
International Reference Preparation (IRP) 67/86 of Human Serum Immunoglobulins
A, G and M from WHO. New batches of IgG Calibrators are compared to a
secondary standard (standardized with the IRP) or the IRP directly and adjusted
accordingly to meet the correct concentration. The instrument measures specific IgG
concentrations in μg/L. By using a conversion factor given by the lot-specific code of
the EliA ANA Wells, the results are automatically converted to EliA U/mL.
d. Detection limit:
In order to determine the lower limit of the measuring range (detection limit), the
ability of the new device to differentiate between serial dilutions of Calibrator 4.0 and
background (sample diluent on EliA™ antigen wells) was evaluated. Calibrator 4.0
(4 ug/L IgG) was serially diluted with EliA sample diluent, in halves to 0.5 ug/L
(1:8), and run on EliA IgG calibrator wells and compared to the Calibrator results.
The discrimination ability of the assay is represented by “D” and acceptance criterion
was set as: D should be >2.0 for calibrator 4 diluted 1:4 (i.e. 1 μg IgG/L) on the
different EliA™ antigen wells for both the detection limit and hook effect.

Both the RNP70 and Jo-1 were able to discriminate samples containing 0.5 μg/L IgG
(Cal 4.0 1:8) from the background. The corresponding detection limit was 0.25 EliA
U/mL when using 0.5 as correction factor to convert μg/L to EliA U/mL.
The EliA™ Scl-70 was able to discriminate samples containing 0.5 μg/L IgG (Cal 4.0
1:8) from the background. The corresponding detection limit was 0.33 EliA U/mL
when using 0.66 as correction factor to convert μg/L to EliA U/mL.
Hook effect:
Hook effect was analyzed by using dilutions from high positive serum samples with
an estimated concentration high above calibrator 600 (containing 600 μg/L of IgG).
The sample dilutions were measured in 4 replicates.

For Jo-1, no hook effect data were provided due to the inability to locate sera showing
signals higher than the highest calibrator point (i.e., 600 μg/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference:
For each assay, a low positive or equivocal sample and a high positive sample were
diluted with sample diluent and spiked with different amounts of interfering
substances or their respective blank solutions, and analyzed in triplicates. A
calibration curve was run in duplicate. Acceptance criterion of the ratios of spiked
sample vs. spiked blank of 0.8 to 1.2 was established. A calibration curve was run in
duplicate. The runs were repeated twice. One batch of EliA™ antigen wells and one
batch of system reagents were used throughout the studies. The following final
concentrations of additives in the samples were reached:
Bilirubin C – 1,930 mg/dL
Bilirubin F – 2,100 mg/dL
Chyle – 95,000 Units/dL
Hemoglobin – 47,000 mg/dL
Rheumatoid Factor IgM – 4,800 IU/mL
There was no demonstrated interference with any of the assays at these concentrations
except for Bilirubin C and Hemoglobin in EliA™ RNP70. With Bilirubin C, ratios of

0.7 and 0.4 were observed with both samples for both runs, respectively. One sample
(low), for run 1, gave a ratio of 0.7 for Hemoglobin but was within specification for
the second run. The second sample was within specification for both runs. Generally,
the use of sera that are lipemic, hemolyzed or have microbial contamination is not
recommended as stated in the package inserts (Section: Specimen collection,
Handling and Preparation).
Cross-reactivity:
A panel of the International Reference Panels for autoantibodies from the Centers of
Disease Control (CDC) and Association of Medical Laboratory Immunologists
(AMLI) were tested in duplicate using one batch of the EliA assays. The CDC panel
included 10 samples identified as positive for dsDNA, ssDNA, Histone, (weak) Sm,
SS-B/La, (weak) SS-A/Ro, Centromere, U1RNP, Scl-70, and Jo-1. The AMLI panel
included 8 positive samples and 2 negatives. The positive samples contained both
major antibodies as well as other minor antibody levels and contained the same
antibodies as the CDC with the exception of Histone. Patient diagnosis for the CDC
samples wasn’t available, however the AMLI samples included: CREST,
scleroderma, MCTD, Sjögren’s syndrome, polymyositis, SLE, and healthy.
With one exception the new devices detect the targets as expected. Pertaining to EliA
RNP70, CDC5 was found positive/equivocal with the test, but is reported to be high
positive for Sm and histone only. In nature, however, Sm is associated with RNP and
a parallel detection of the two antigens is not unexpected?. The results demonstrated a
good specificity and sensitivity for the single tests. No cross-reactivity to other
autoantibodies could be detected.
f. Assay cut-off:
The sponsor tested 400 apparently healthy Blood Donor samples from Caucasian
individuals equally distributed by sex and age to evaluate expected values in the
normal population and to confirm the previously defined cut-offs. The sponsor’s
acceptance criteria for validating the cut-offs was that the 95th percentile should lie
below the lower limit of the equivocal range and the 99th percentile should lie below
the upper limit of the equivocal range.

b. Matrix comparison:
The suitability of different sample matrices for each assay was determined by
collecting serum, EDTA, lithium heparin and citrate plasma samples from fifty
different donors. Sample values spanned the range of the assays. Negative samples
did not switch to positive in any serum/plasma combination in any assay. Linear
regression of the equivocal and positive samples for each serum/plasma combination
in each assay demonstrated that the matrices were equivalent.
