Measurement Methods

• CLSI Guideline EP9-A2: Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient
Samples
• CLSI Protocol C28-A2, How to Define and Determine Reference Intervals in the
Clinical Laboratory
L. Test Principle:
The measurement of amino acids, succinylacetone, free carnitine, and acylcarnitines
with the NeoBase assay involves extraction of dried blood spots from newborns with
a solution containing stable-isotope labeled internal standards and analysis using a
tandem mass spectrometry (MSMS) system. The response of each analyte relative to
their corresponding stable-isotope labeled internal standard is proportional to analyte
concentration.
In the NeoBase Non-derivatized MSMS Kit, data is acquired in the Multiple Reaction
Monitoring (MRM) mode. During this acquisition, a collisionally induced of each
analyte is measured for a set time period. Data acquisition and processing is
performed by the software package included with the system.
The triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer that is used for these measurements is a
computer-controlled device that separates and quantitates ions based on their mass to
charge (m/z) ratio. The extracted sample is delivered to the ion source of the mass
spectrometer by the liquid chromatography (LC) system consisting of the
autosampler, micro pump(s) and solvent vacuum degasser. What is reported in the
MSMS MRM spectrum is the m/z value of the precursor ions that generated a desired
product.
Analyte extraction with the NeoBase assay is accomplished for the amino acids and
carnitines by simply contacting the sample with the extraction solution containing the
corresponding internal standards during the incubation step. However,
succinylacetone requires a specific derivatization reaction during the incubation step
for its extraction and measurement. The derivatization and extraction of
succinylacetone takes place simultaneously with the extraction of other analytes by
addition of an aliquot of the Succinylacetone Assay Solution to the extraction mixture
containing internal standards.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was performed across multiple instruments, operators,
assay lots and multiple sites. The study plan consisted of the analysis of dried
blood spots samples at three different analyte concentration levels. The study
included three MS2 instruments and three QMicro instruments tested at three
different sites as well as six different operators and three different NeoBase
assay lots. Each run consisted of the analysis of 6 replicates of each sample
level (6 distinct dried blood punches and sample preparations) by one operator
using one assay lot on one instrument. Each day, there were two runs (two
different operators) per instrument and assay lot. The analysis was carried out
5

--- Page 6 ---
for five days for each instrument and assay lot. Overall, there were a total of
30 runs per instrument (5 runs per operator and assay lot on each instrument).
Each operator performed a run on each of 5 distinct days (not necessarily
consecutively) for an instrument and assay lot.
The total variability or Total %CV was determined as the square root of the
sum of squares of the variation components mentioned above and according
the equation 1, where Wr is the Within-Run variation, Br is the Between-Run
component of variation, Bl is the Between-Lot variation and Bi/o is the
Between-Instrument and Operator contribution to variability.
Total imprecision = [(Wr)2 + (Br)2 + (Bi/o)2 + (Bl)2]1/2

An in-house precision study of the NeoBase Non-derivatized MSMS kit was
performed using the QMicro Tandem Mass Spectrometry System. The data
for the precision evaluation was acquired using multiple reaction monitoring
(MRM) mode.
The testing for the precision was based on the CLSI guideline--Evaluation of
Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry (EP5-A) -- using three different
levels of dried blood spots denoted in this study as Low, Mid, and High
samples. These blood spots contained enriched levels of amino acids,
succinylacetone (SA), free carnitine and acylcarnitines spiked into whole
blood. The analyte concentrations of these spots cover significant clinical
ranges (endogenous to above cutoffs). Additionally, one low and high blood
spot controls were included for each run and used as plate qualifiers for this
study.
Briefly, two runs per day, for twenty days over a period of one month were
performed among four operators (five runs each) using the same lot of
materials including DBS, extraction solution, flow solvent, and
succinylacetone assay solution following the NeoBase assay procedure. Each
of the runs within the same day was separated by at least two hours. All of the
runs were acquired on one single instrument.

Linearity:
The linearity of the assay was determined by testing dried blood spot samples
enriched with known and increasing analyte concentrations that covered the
entire clinical range (endogenous to above cut-off levels). Twelve
concentrations of each analyte were tested, and there were six replicates for
each level. Finally, three low and high blood spot controls were included for
each run and used as plate qualifiers for this study (all control results must be
within 3 SDs of the assigned value). The study design consisted of one run per
day over a total of four days. The linearity was determined by plotting the
measured analyte concentrations and a function of the corresponding known
enrichment levels and performing linear regression analysis of the data. The
linear ranges (R2 ≥ 0.99 for all) for the assay on the QMicro Tandem Mass
Spectrometry System are presented below.

Recovery:
Analyte recovery for the NeoBase Non-derivatized MSMS kit was evaluated
using the QMicro Tandem Mass Spectrometry System over five runs. Each
run consisted of one plate containing 8 replicates each of endogenous samples
and samples enriched at five different levels (levels L1 through L5) of the
analytes of interest. Analytical runs were validated by including three low
and three high blood spot controls (lot # Pilot 1) for each run and used as plate
qualifiers for this study.

Value Assignment:
Internal Standards: The value assignment of the internal standards consists
of the production of reference stock solutions of the corresponding non-
labeled analytes. These solutions are of known concentrations and thus are
used to determine the concentration of the individual internal standards in
each vial type. The procedure consists of preparing three separate stock
solutions of amino acids and of acylcarnitines. Each solution is prepared
individually and the material is individually weighed for each solution.

The result of this process is three individually prepared solutions for each of
the acylcarnitines and amino acids (the stock solutions are mixtures of each
analyte type). Separately, internal standard vials are reconstituted (either
amino acids or acylcarnitines). The reconstituted internal standards are then
diluted and mixed with dilutions of the corresponding non-labeled reference
solutions. Three random vials of each lot (either amino acid or acylcarnitine
internal standards) are used for each of the stock solutions for a total of 9 vials
analyzed. The resulting mixtures of internal standards and reference solutions
are processed using the derivatized assay procedure. Using the known
concentrations of the reference stock solutions, the concentration of each
internal standard is determined per vial and per reference stock solutions. The
results are analyzed for consistency within plate, within vial, within stock
solution and between plate, between vial and between reference stock
solution. If the data is consistent across all reference solutions and vials, the
average concentration of each internal standard obtained from these
experiments is then assigned as the lot assigned value.

Dried Blood Spot Control: The assignment of the analyte concentrations in
the NeoBase dried blood spot controls is performed using amino acid and
acylcarnitine internal standards whose values have been assigned as described
above. The value assignment consists in the determination of the analyte
concentration in the low and high assay controls by analyzing the control
material with the NeoBase assay procedure.
The dried blood spot are processed as indicated for the NeoBase assay. In this
procedure, three different internal standard working solutions are prepared (all
from the same internal standard assay lot) to avoid biases due to the
preparation of the internal standard solutions. The blood spots are then
processed using each internal standard solution and analyzed in 12 replicates
and in three runs. The results of these experiments are analyzed for precision
and consistency and if the data is consistent, the average concentration for
each analyte is reported as the expected mean concentration expected for the
lot.

Stability: Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed
for blood spot and internal controls and kit components and found to be
acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
The functional sensitivity of the NeoBase assay was evaluated by excising
discs from each of two sets of blood spots (these blood spots contained a high
and low enrichment levels of the analytes of interest). The sample discs were
placed in microtiter plate wells and extracted with the NeoBase extraction
solution. Upon completion of the extraction, the extracts from each level were
pooled by transferring a small amount from each extraction well and into a
common vial and mixed (this is referred to as “DBS extract diluents” below).
Next, an aliquot of each of the pooled extracts was taken and spiked with
amino acid and acylcarnitine internal standards resulting in a high internal
standard concentration sample (Level 1). Sample level 1 was mixed with the
DBS extract diluent in a 1:1 v/v ratio to obtain a Level 2 sample whose
internal standard concentration is expected to be one half of that present in the
Level 1 sample. This procedure was followed serially until a total of 17
dilutions were accomplished from which 18 sample levels with decreasing
concentration of internal standards (Level 1 to 18) were obtained.
These solutions for each of the DBS levels were dispensed into microtiter
plates. Additionally, 12 low plate controls and 12 high plate controls were
extracted using NeoBase assay procedure and two rows of the neat NeoBase
extraction solution was dispensed to ensure that Level18 which contains the
lowest internal standard concentrations is not cross contaminated by preceding
wells.
To determine the functional sensitivities of the analytes in the NeoBase assay,
three different approaches were employed for data analysis: 1) a stepwise
linear regression analysis, 2) a relative concentration response of adjacent
dilutions and 3) the precision of the replicate samples. Thresholds were
determined for each of the above parameters and the functional sensitivities
were established as the lowest concentration that met all three criteria.

e. Analytical specificity:
The analysis to identify potential interferents proceeded in the following
manner:
1. A broad compilation of substances that could potentially interfere with
the assay. The substances listed would be found in the clinical sample
and a molecular mass overlap with any analytes or internal standards
detected with the NeoBase assay. The initial list of potential interfering
substances were compiled from the following sources:
(a) 336 substances suggested by CLSI guideline EP7-A2 to be common
interfering substances in clinical assays;
(b) 122 substances from the NIST mass spectral database that had
potential mass overlaps with analytes detected with the assay; and
(c) 8 substances identified to be potential interfering substances in
NeoGram AAAC Derivatized Tandem Mass Spectrometry kit. In
total, the initial list considered 466 substances.
2. The list was refined by evaluating whether or not there was likelihood for
any of these substances to be present in the neonatal sample.
3. The chemical structures of the remaining substances was examined and if
the chemical structure of a substance indicated the potential to have the
same mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) as an analyte or internal standard of
interest, its structure was further examined to predict whether or not this
substance would fragment in the tandem mass spectrometry experiment
in such a way to produce the same mass transition as any of the analytes
or internal standards in the assay. If the likelihood of a substance to
fragment in such a way to interfere with the assay was predicted to be
negligible, such substance was not considered a potential interference for
the assay. If a substance, however, was predicted to potentially ionize
and fragment in such a way that would produce the same mass transition

used for the detection of an analyte or internal standard in the assay, that
substance was evaluated further.
4. Over all, 16 compounds were identified as potential interfering
candidates. These 16 substances and the respective target analyte/internal
standard with which they would interfere (listed in the parenthesis) are
Aminocaproic acid (Leu), Asparagine (Orn), Creatine (Ala), Creatine
(Leu), Dihydroxybenzoic acid (SA), Folic acid (C18:1OH),
Formiminoglutamic acid or FIGLU (Arg), Hydroxylproline (Leu),
Lidocaine (C4 IS), Malic acid (Leu IS), Methionine sulfone (Tyr),
Ornithine (Pro), Salicylic acid (Orn), Sarcosine (Ala), Penicillamine
(Met), Propranolol (C6), and Pseudoephedrine (Phe).
5. The 16 compounds identified above as potential candidates for
interference with the assay were evaluated by subjecting them to
daughter ion scan tandem mass spectrometry experiments.
Fragmentation of the 16 interfering candidates confirmed that 14 of them
generated fragments identical or close (within +/- 1 amu) to the daughter
ion of the target analyte or internal standard. Therefore, they are
considered as potential interfering substances in the assay and required
further evaluation.
These 14 interfering substances were further evaluated by the actual
NeoBase assays in which pooled dried blood spot (DBS) extracts, both at
endogenous level (referred to as Endo hereafter in this study) and analyte
enriched level (referred to as Enriched hereafter), were spiked
individually with each of the 14 potential interfering substances at the
concentration suggested by CLSI EP7-A2 guidelines, results of which
were compared with those obtained from the same pooled DBS extracts
but measured without any spiking of the potential interfering substances.
Results from these experiments indicated that 5 of the 14 substances
evaluated caused a statistically significant change to the analyte
measurement, and thus were confirmed to be potential interfering
substances for the NeoBase assay. These substances are Asparagine,
Creatine, Methionine sulfone, Sarcosine, and Hydroxyproline. These 5
compounds were further evaluated by performing dose response
experiments in which the interfering substance was spiked in DBS
extract at increasing concentrations to determine the concentration at
which the interference becomes significant. None of the interferents
should impact screening with the NeoBase assay (e.g. false positives).
6. The second study consisted in the evaluation of substances not expected
to have a mass transition overlap but that could affect the assay by ion
suppression or other indirect processes. In these experiments, eight
substances (see table below) were spiked individually into blood. This
spiked blood was then used to make DBS at endogenous and 3 enriched
analyte levels. Reference control DBS (free of interfering substances)
were also made. Results from these experiments indicated that none of
these 8 substances interferes with the NeoBase assay.

7. Finally, the potential interference of Chlorhexidine gluconate (the active
ingredient in Chlorascrub SwabRM) with NeoBase assay was also
examined. This compound was first examined by adding the solution
squeezed out of Chlorascrub Swab to NeoBase DBS assay (at both
endogenous and enriched analyte levels) before incubation. Results
showed that this compound caused significant changes in the measured
concentrations for a number of analytes compared to reference assay (no
Chlorascrub Swab solution added) and the total ion chromatogram (TIC)
intensity was suppressed substantially. Tandem mass spectrometry
fragmentation analysis was performed to investigate the observation in the
screening test, and dose response study of chlorhexidine gluconate was
also performed. Chlorhexidine gluconate interferes with quantitation of
the C10and C5 internal standards at concentrations ranging from 450 –
2790 µmol/L, respectively, however the residual amount of the compound
found on the skin after Chlorascrub Swab use should only be a small
percentage of the amount known to interfere.
These compounds and the details of their potential to interfere are all
described in the package insert for the device.
Carryover:
The study samples were DBS prepared using enriched concentrations of
amino acids, succinylacetone, free carnitine, and acylcarnitines spiked into
whole blood. DBS samples were extracted according to the NeoBase
assay procedure and pooled. Sample pooling was performed in order to
minimize sample variation. Pooled samples were dispensed to microtiter
plates 4 and data acquired using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)
mode. Quality control samples (two replicates each Low and High
controls) were analyzed at the beginning, middle, and end of each run.

The study was designed to characterize carryover for three cutoff
situations: 1) “more than” cutoff positive carryover; 2) “less than” cutoff
positive carryover; and 3) negative carryover.
When using a “more than” cutoff, a patient is flagged if an analyte is
above a certain concentration cutoff. In this case, positive carryover from
one sample into another could result in a False Positive determination by
artificially increasing the analyte concentration above its cutoff. This type
of carryover was characterized by acquiring a range of high concentration
samples (LL1 (cid:198) LL4) each followed by three borderline samples (BL1 (cid:198)
BL3). The borderline sample was chosen such that analyte concentrations
are in the region of the estimated cutoff ranges. Five runs were acquired
on the QMicro and MS2 platforms.
The results for the study demonstrate that for SA carryover may occur in
cases where a Tyrosinemia Type I patient with drastically elevated SA is
followed by a borderline patient. This is noted in the package insert. The
clinical impact of this result is a potential increased repeat testing rate due
to increased false positive outcome. Since the magnitude of the carryover
is not great for SA, only the repeat testing rate is affected and not the
safety or efficacy of the assay. Additionally, this disorder is not very
prevalent (incidence rate 1:100,000-1:125,000; ref. 1, 2), thus instances in
which carry over may be present will be very infrequent and thus the
increased repeat rate will not be substantial.
Carryover was not detected for other analytes.
Drift:
The potential of the NeoBase Non-derivatized MSMS kit to be subject to
drift was evaluated. The data for the drift study was acquired using
multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The experiment was set to run
continuously for a total elapsed assay time of approximately 24 hours.
This timeframe covers the area of concern for practical use of the assay;
that is, within day drifting.
For this study, dried blood spots were prepared using three enriched
concentrations (denoted in this study as Low, Mid, and High) of amino
acids, succinylacetone, free carnitine and acylcarnitines spiked into whole
blood.
Three low and three high blood spot controls were included for each run
and used as run qualifiers for this study. Each plate was considered to
contain the equivalent of two runs. The time elapsed during the acquisition
of each run was 1.5 hours. Therefore, the study analyzed a total of 16 runs
(time points) collected throughout one 24 hour-period. The mean from the
first run was used as time zero reference. Analysis of the data indicates
that the assay variability over the 24-hour test period is well within the
expected precision of the assay as demonstrated by Between Run % CV,
therefore no drift was detected.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison studies took place at two different US newborn
screening laboratories that evaluated the NeoBase assay in parallel to the
predicate device (identical specimens were analyzed as paired samples by
both methods). The sample set consisted of 9416 random neonatal samples,
104 samples from with true positive diagnoses, and 320 artificially enriched
dried blood spots. Correlation was established by assessing whether or not the
methods were concordant in determining the paired samples to have analyte
concentration values above or below their corresponding cutoffs. Examination
on the number of concordant pairs for each analyte (cases in which both
methods agreed) provided the percent agreements shown here:

The two samples that neither of the two assays was able to detect based on the
study cutoffs were a CPT-2 and a VLCAD case. The CPT-2 sample had been
in storage for over three years and the VLCAD sample had been stored at
room temperature for over one year. The CPT-2 sample was found originally
during routine newborn screening at a state laboratory using the predicate
device. It is possible that the acylcarnitine analytes in these samples had

experienced a significant degree of decay over time and thus causing the
corresponding analytes to be below the study cutoffs. For both of these
disorders, elevated levels of long chain acylcarnitines are expected, but neither
device indicated that it measured analytes above the cut-offs. The package
insert indicates that degradation of acylcarnitines may occur in patient
samples, however, this should not impact newborn screening where samples
should be tested within 10 days of sample collection.
US Site 1:
The correlation study at US Site 1 was executed using the MS2 Tandem Mass
Spectrometer System (MS2) instruments to acquire all of the NeoBase and the
NeoGram data. One lot of the NeoBase assay was used. All of the NeoBase
data were acquired using full MRM method and all of the NeoGram data were
acquired using the full scan method. A total of 31 full or partial plates
containing retrospective presumptive negative (left over) neonatal samples
were acquired totaling 2,500 neonatal samples. Additionally, 14 stored
confirmed True Positive (TP) samples, 50 artificially enriched Presumptive
Positive (PP) and Presumptive Borderline (PB) samples were acquired using
both assays. (The PP and PB samples are artificially prepared DBS. The PP
and PB samples were derived from analyte enriched DBS prepared by the
sponsor.)
The following 2x2 tables indicate the results of each analyte after testing of
paired samples on the predicate and proposed device. None of the discrepant
results were from stored confirmed True Positive samples.

reporting abnormal result levels for each analyte should be established by using
statistical measurements (e.g. percentiles, means, and standard deviations) in
consultation with metabolic disease specialists who can provide additional
guidance based on incidence rates, disease severity, and typical profiles of known
positive patients. The determination of presumptive abnormal amino acid,
succinylacetone, free carnitine and acylcarnitine concentration profiles should be
based on predetermined cut-offs obtained from pilot studies performed with the
NeoBase Non-derivatized MSMS kit. If available, samples from patients with
known disorders (true positives) should be run to provide additional guidance in
setting conservative abnormal and borderline cut-off levels. As larger numbers of
samples and confirmation of presumptive positive results are obtained by each
laboratory, it is recommended that this information be used for reviewing the cut-
offs on a regular basis. The actions to be taken when specimens fall under either
of three categories – presumptive positive, borderline, and presumptive negative –
are described below.
Presumptive positives:
Results that are above (or below if it is a low cut-off) the abnormal cut-offs
should be considered presumptive positive. Retesting of the original specimen
with the original method is recommended for all specimens designated as
presumptive positive for one or more disorders or analytes. Follow local
regulations and guidelines for the handling and reporting of presumptive positive
results.
Borderline specimens:
Results that fall between the abnormal cut-off and the borderline cut-off should be
considered borderline results. Retesting of the original specimen with the origina
method is recommended for specimens whose initial results are borderline.
Follow local regulations and guidelines for the handling and reporting of
borderline results.
Repeat testing:
Regardless of whether retesting was initiated because of initial borderline or
presumptive positive status, if the repeat testing result is above the abnormal cut-
off (or below if it is a low cut-off) then the result should be considered
presumptive positive. Follow local regulations and guidelines for the handling and
reporting of presumptive positive results.
Regardless of whether retesting was initiated because of initial borderline or
abnormal status, if the repeat testing result falls between the abnormal and
borderline cut-offs, then all available data (initial and retesting) should be taken
into consideration to report the values according to local regulations and
guidelines.
Regardless of whether retesting was initiated because of initial borderline or
abnormal status, follow local regulations and guidelines in cases where retesting
results are below (or above if a low cut-off) the borderline cut-offs.

Presumptive negatives:
If all the initial results of any specimen, are below (or above if a low cut-off) all
the borderline and abnormal cut-offs, the result can be treated as presumptive
negative (or low risk) and reported appropriately.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Typical expected NeoBase Non-derivatized MSMS kit results for neonatal
populations are presented below. These results were obtained at two US newborn
screening facilities.
The data represents 9,363 neonatal results. The population means and population
standard deviation (SD) are shown in micromolar (μM) quantities.
