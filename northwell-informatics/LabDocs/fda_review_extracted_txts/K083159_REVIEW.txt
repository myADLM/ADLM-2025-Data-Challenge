c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The assigned values for Berichrom Heparin LMW Calibrator, Berichrom
Heparin LMW Control 1 and Berichrom Heparin LMW Control 2 are
traceable to the 2nd World Health Organization (WHO) International
Standard for low molecular weight heparin. Assigned values are obtained
from multiple determinations, on multiple coagulation instruments and
Berichrom Heparin lots. A typical assigned value for the calibrator is 1.40
IU/mL. Typical control values are 0.40 IU/mL for Control 1 and 0.90 IU/mL
for Control 2.
