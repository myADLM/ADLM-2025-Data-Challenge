4. Panel:
Immunology (82)
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The intended use is the same as the previous cleared Introl™ CF Panel I Control
(k060070) which states:
The Introl™ CF Panel I Control is intended for in vitro diagnostic use as a quality control
to monitor analytical performance of the extraction, amplification and detection steps of
diagnostic assays used in the detection of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane
Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene mutations and variants. This product is intended to
be extracted and analyzed routinely with each CFTR assay run.
The INTROL™ CF Panel I Control is designed to monitor the detection of 38 CFTR
mutations associated with cystic fibrosis, including the 23 mutations recommended for
testing by American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) and the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). The INTROL™ CF Panel I Control also
monitors 3 polymorphisms (I506V, I507V, F508C) and the 5/7/9T variants.

4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable
I. Device Description:
The formulation of the modified and cleared INTROL™ CF Panel I Control is the same:
INTROL™ CF Panel I Control consists of synthetic CFTR DNA suspended in a matrix of
synthetic DNA targets, carrier DNA of a non-human species, preservatives, dye, and
stabilizers. CFTR DNA is stabilized in the matrix and released when processed through
common extraction methods as if it were a whole blood specimen.
INTROL™ CF Panel I Control modifications from the cleared panel:
CFTR DNA has been modified as follows:
1. Exon 3: additional 106 nucleotides 3’
2. Exon 5: additional 184 nucleotides 3’
3. Exon 14b: additional 100 nucleotides 5’ and additional 289 nucleotides 3’

CF panel I with calculations adjusted for the new size plasmids. The first two builds are
comprised of five bottles each. Each bottle contained specific clones, independently
manufactured. The third build is comprised of three bottles, each containing different
clones independently manufactured. All lots were tested using the xTAG™ Cystic
Fibrosis Kit, eSensor and other amplification methods and found to give the correct calls.

2. Comparison studies:
The three batches of modified INTROL CF Panel I Control were tested in the following
CFTR detection assays: xTAG® (Luminex/ TmBioscience), eSensor® CFCD (Osmetech),
and InPlex® (Third Wave) which require the additional CFTR sequence of the modified
INTROL CF Panel I Control in order to detect Control alleles 711+1G>T and 2789+5 G>A.
All genotype calls were the same as for the predicate INTROL CF Panel I Control with the
exception that 711+1G>T and 2789+5 G>A were detected by all assays.
Risk analysis
A risk analysis using Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) was performed to assess
the impact of the modifications. Results showed that the design outputs of modified INTROL
CF Panel I meet design inputs in conformance with design control requirements as specified
in 21 CFR 820.30.
3. Clinical studies:

5. Expected values/Reference range:

N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
