values are 0.20 IU/mL for Control 1 and 0.60 IU/mL for Control 2.
Stability Testing
Shelf life (Closed)
Study Duration
24 month shelf life; studies performed for 1 month past labeled shelf life.
Testing Frequency
Day 0; 6, 9, 12, 18, 19, 24 and 25 months
Storage
+2 to +8°C
Replicates
Calibrator: Three six-point calibrator curves are generated from three vials of
calibrator; a mean calibration curve is established from the three curves. At
each time point, a vial is tested in duplicate.
Controls: At each time point, a vial is tested in duplicate.
Acceptance Criteria
Control 1: Results obtained must not deviate more than ±0.05 IU/mL
compared to Day 0 results
Calibrator & Control 2: Results obtained must not deviate more than ±20%
compared to Day 0 results
The mean value at each time point is compared to the Day 0 value. Results
obtained must meet the acceptance criteria. Shelf-life (expiration) dating
assignment at commercialization reflects the real-time data on file at Siemens
