4. Special instrument requirements:
TearLab Osmolarity System
I. Device Description:
The device consists of the following components and accessories: one TearLab Reader, two
TearLab Pens, two TearLab Electronic Check Cards, Single Use TearLab Osmolarity Test
Cards, and TearLab Control Solutions. The TearLab Osmolarity Test Card, in conjunction
with the TearLab Osmolarity System, provides method for determining tear osmolarity using
nanoliter (nL) volumes of tear fluid collected directly from the eyelid margin.
To perform a test, a new Test Card containing a microfluidic capillary channel is attached
onto the Pen. The tip of the Test Card is touched to the inferior tear meniscus located above
the lower eyelid and collects 40-50 nanoliters of tear fluid by passive capillary action.
After a successful collection, the Pen in conjunction with the electrodes embedded on the
Test Card, measures and stores the tear fluid impedance. The Pen is then docked to the
Reader. The Reader downloads impedance data from the Pen in order to calculate and
display the final osmolarity as a numerical value displayed in units of mOsms/L.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To establish the linearity of the system through the range of 282-391 mOsms/L, seven
samples in a dilution series ranging from 251 – 428 mOsms/L were each run in four
replicates on one lot of test cards, one TearLab Reader and two Pens. For the lowest
and highest samples tested (251 and 428 mOsms/L respectively), TearLab indicated
that the value was either below or above the detectable range. The Pens were
randomly assigned. Samples were also run in duplicate on the Wescor 5520 Vapor
Pressure Osmometer. Results are summarized below:
Regression Intercept r2
0.928 15.976 0.9903
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
OcuSense TearLab Control Solutions are two levels of aqueous salt solution sealed
within glass ampoules. These solutions are formulated gravimetrically at two
different sodium concentrations. Product stability is established based on real time
studies. Samples were analyzed at predetermined intervals with failure defined as
greater than a 2% change in sodium concentration.
Closed Vial Stability of Control Solution: control solutions contained within sealed
glass ampoules were evaluated at two temperatures, 2-8 °C and 30 °C. The sodium
concentration was determined using a flame photometer analyzer (n=5). The mean
and percent change was calculated after 36 months after the date of manufacture. The
sponsor determined that the control solutions contained within a single use glass
ampoule is stable for 36 months when stored at 2-30°C.
The TearLab Osmolarity Systems are calibrated against a set of precision resistors
and temperature references. This procedure has been established to ensure that all
TearLabs operate within identical tolerance limits.
d. Detection limit:
The upper and lower limit of detection of the TearLab Osmolarity System is 275-400
based on replicates of two levels of contrived tears, at 275 mOsms/L (7 replicates)
and 400 mOsms/L (21 replicates), respectively, tested on one lot of test cards with
one TearLab Reader and one Pen. Paired with the linearity testing performed above in
section L.b., the sponsor has demonstrated that the device is capable of reading values
as low as 275 mOsms/L and as high as 400 mOsms/L with linearity established from
282-391 mOsms/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
To establish the effects of matrix components on the osmolarity of human tears,
sodium chloride solutions were compared to a complex mixture of mono- and
divalent ions formulated to mimic human tears. Both matrices were analyzed on a
Wescor 5520 Vapro vapor pressure osmometer calibrated using a 290 mmol/kg NIST
traceable NaCl solution. The fluid samples were also measured for impedance on a
TearLab device.

[Table 1 on page 5]
Regression	Intercept	r2
0.928	15.976	0.9903

--- Page 6 ---
Linear regression analysis showed that the difference between sodium chloride
solution and a complex mixture of mono- and divalent ions meant to mimic human
tears was approximately 750 Ohms across a range of osmolarities, representing a shift
of 8 mOsms/L. Because physiological variance in electrolyte ratios is expected to be
less than 1-10% of each electrolyte, the expected change in osmolarity resulting from
these variations is 0.08 to 0.8 mOsms/L. As this range is not clinically relevant, the
sponsor concludes that there are no measurable matrix effects from the physiological
variance in electrolyte composition in human tears.
Linear regression analysis showed that the difference between artificial tears
comprised of of monovalent ions, divalent ions, and tear proteins (specifically,
lysozyme, immunoglobulins and albumin), as compared to the same matrix without
tear proteins, was less than the measurable precision of the TearLab (< 3 mOsms/L).
Because physiological variance in protein ratios is expected to be much less than the
100% difference within this experiment, there are no expected matrix effects from
physiological variance in protein composition in human tear.
Linear regression analysis showed that the difference between artificial tears
comprised of of monovalent ions, divalent ions, tear proteins, lipids and mucins as
compared to the same matrix without lipids and mucins, was less than the measurable
precision of the TearLab (< 3 mOsms/L). Because physiological variance in protein
ratios is expected to be much less than the 100% difference within this experiment,
there are no expected matrix effects from physiological variance in lipid and mucin
composition in human tear.
Therefore, there are no expected matrix effects from physiological variance in
electrolyte composition, protein composition, or lipid and mucin composition in
human tears.

Not Applicable.
2. Comparison studies:

clinically significant range of osmolarity for a total of 80 samples ranging from 280 to
372 mOsms/L and measured on the predicate Wescor 5520 Vapro Osmometer and the
TearLab Osmolarity System. The Deming regression between the individual Wescor

N. Instrument Name:
TearLab Osmolarity System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test card is single use and must be replaced with a new card for additional readings.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X____ or No ______
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with tears from the lateral (temporal) extent of the
eyelid. Since the tear sample is applied directly to the test strip there are no special
handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
The manufacturer calibrates the TearLab Osmolarity System against a reference standard
solution prepared from dried, high-purity sodium chloride traceable to the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Calibration by the user is not required.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor has two levels of controls available for this device with both normal and
high osmolarity control solutions available in single-use glass ampoules. An acceptable
range for each control level is printed on control package insert. The user is instructed to
not use the device if the control solutions are outside of the range indicated and to contact
the distributor.
The Electronic Check Cards (ECC) will also verify TearLab function. The Electronic
Check Card contains precision resistors on a printed circuit board to provide a known
standard signal to simulate tear impedance. The user attaches the ECC to the Pen, which
converts the precision resistor signal of the ECC into an osmolarity test result that should
be compared to the allowable range as indicated in the ECC instructions for use. In this
manner, the user can verify that the Pen and Reader hardware and software are
performing as expected.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Rationale For Contrived Tears
To perform the within-run, between instrument, lot-to-lot, and method comparison studies
presented in this submission, approximately one half liter of tear fluid would be necessary
which is equivalent of fifty thousand tear collections. Comparison of sequential tear
collections on the predicate Wescor and TearLab osmometer are also made impractical by
the small volume of accessible human tear fluid per subject. Additionally, split sample in
vitro tests of tear fluid were found by the sponsor to be unsuitable for the external clinical
sites enrolled to examine the performance of the TearLab.
In order to mitigate errors due to evaporation or dilution from reflex tearing during
performance testing of the TearLab, the sponsor synthesized artificial tears that accurately
represented the impedance-osmolarity relationship of human tear fluid. To demonstrate the
acceptability of using contrived tears in place of human tears, roughly one half liter of
contrived tear solution was synthesized under an ISO 13485 quality system in an independent
reference laboratory. The composition of the contrived tear contained a complex mixture of
mono- and divalent ions, proteins, lipids and metabolites to mimic the human tear matrix.
The contrived tears were then diluted to produce seven osmolarity specimens representing
the clinical range of tear osmolarity (280, 287, 294, 305, 316, 345, 372 mOsms/L). Samples
were analyzed on a Wescor 5520 osmometer calibrated using a 290 mmol/kg NIST traceable
NaCl solution and an OcuSense TearLab device. The contrived tear solution was split into
0.4 mL aliquots in individually sealed vials that were then disseminated to the performance
testing sites.
In addition, to demonstrate the performance of human tear fluid measurement with the
Tearlab osmometer, a pool of human tears was collected from 43 different people, of which a
portion was split into four fractions and partially lyophilized to increasing levels of
osmolarity. The fractions were then measured on both the TearLab and Wescor 5520
osmometers.
Wescor Osmolarity vs. TearLab Osmolarity
Test Slope Intercept r2
Human Tears 0.9626 10.964 0.9531
Contrived Tears 0.9455 12.433 0.95
The impedance-osmolarity relationship of the contrived tears used for performance testing
was identical to that of human tears.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
