J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
Varelisa ReCombi ANA Screen
2. Predicate K number(s):
k050625
3. Comparison with predicate:
The new assay is similar to the predicate assay as follows: same indications for
use, specimen type, assay principle, conjugate, and reagents. The new assay
differs from the predicate assay by replacing the previous Sm antigen with a
synthetic human Sm peptide and the elimination of a pre-washing step.
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI H18-A3: Procedures for the Handling and Processing of Blood Specimens;
Approved Guideline—Third Edition
L. Test Principle:
The Varelisa ReCombi ANA Screen is an indirect noncompetitive enzyme
immunoassay for the qualitative determination of dsDNA, U1RNP (RNP 70, A, C),
Sm[D], SS-A/Ro (52 kDa, 60 kDa), SS-B/La, Scl-70, CENP-B and Jo-1 antibodies in
serum and plasma. If antibodies specific for the nuclear antigens are present in a
patient sample they bind to these nuclear antigens coated to the assay wells. In the
second step an enzyme labeled secondary antibody (conjugate) binds to the antigen-
antibody complex. The enzyme labeled antigen-antibody complex converts the
substrate to form a colored solution. The results are read spectrophotometrically and
are interpreted as positive, equivocal, or negative by comparison to a cut-off
calibrator.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Three samples (high negative, equivocal and high positive) per parameter
were analyzed in 5 runs, with 8 replicates per run. Each sample contained all
eight antigens. The runs were carried out by one operator within one day.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The consistency of calibration material is ensured by a testing procedure
comparing the new calibrators to corresponding master calibration material
demonstrating that the internal target values are met. No international
standards have been established for these analytes. The performance of the
bulk production of positive and negative control sera is adjusted until the
release criteria are met. Values have to be found in accordance to an
established acceptance range.
Based on accelerated stability testing, unopened kits were projected to be
stable for 12 months when stored at 2 – 8°C. Sample stability claims are based
on the recommendations in CLSI H18-A3.
d. Detection limit:
This study was intended to verify the previously established detection limit
(k050625). Sample diluent was measured 90 times per run on two different
lots. Analytical sensitivity (detection limit) was calculated as the mean of the
optical densities (OD) of the sample diluent plus three times the standard
deviations (SD) then converted to a ratio. The analytical sensitivity for the
assay was 0.1.
e. Analytical specificity:
Ten CDC ANA human reference sera from the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention and 10 sera of the AMLI Consensus Reference Panel 2002,
were diluted and tested twice by two different operators on two different lots
of the new device and one lot of the predicate device. Both the new assay and
the predicate assay gave a positive result (> 1.4 mean ratio) for CDC 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 which all contain antigens recognized by the Recombi ANA
Screen. All other samples in the CDC panel were negative (CDC 6, 11, and
12). Both the new assay and the predicate assay gave a positive result for
AMLI panel members AMLI 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 which contain target
antigens recognized by the test. AMLI 1 and 10 were negative as expected.
Endogenous interferences:
The following interfering substances (up to the listed concentration) did not
adversely affect the test results (i.e. change the outcome): Bilirubin C (21.6
mg/dL), Bilirubin F (19.1 mg/dL), Chyle (1590 FTU), Hemoglobin (494
mg/dL), and Rheumatoid Factor (550 IU/mL).
f. Assay cut-off:
The equivocal range and cut-off of the assay were determined in k05625. The
sponsor presented a study of 460 healthy Caucasian blood donors evenly
distributed by age and sex that confirmed the established cut-offs.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The performance of the new device was compared to the performance of the
old device using 253 samples from patients with known clinical background
(50 infectious disease, 50 non-connective tissue disease (CTD), 103 CTD, and
3

--- Page 4 ---
50 Rheumatoid Arthritis) and 92 blood donor samples. Equivocal results were
regarded as negative:
Predicate ReCombi ANA Screen
Positive Negative Total
New ReCombi Positive 102 5 107
ANA Screen Negative 1 145 146
Total 103 150 253
Positive Percent Agreement: 99.0% (102/103) 95% CI: 94.7 – 100%
Negative Percent Agreement: 96.7% (145/150) 95% CI: 92.4 – 98.9%
Total Percent Agreement: 97.6% (247/253) 95% CI: 94.9 – 99.1%
b. Matrix comparison:
26 negative samples from healthy donors and 13 samples spiked with different
amounts of sera from ANA+ donors each available as serum, citrate plasma,
EDTA plasma, and heparin plasma were run in duplicate. Performance was
acceptable in citrate plasma and EDTA plasma however heparin plasma
samples interfered with correct test results. The labeling contains a warning
not to use heparin plasma.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
See Assay Cut-off above.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
See Assay Cut-off above.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
