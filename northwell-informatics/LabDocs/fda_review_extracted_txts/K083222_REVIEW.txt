L. Test Principle:
Bound or dimerized HCT (oxidised form) is reduced to free HCT, which then reacts
with serine catalyzed by cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) to form cystathionine.
Cystathionine in turn is broken down by cystathionine beta-lyase (CBL) to form
HCT, pyruvate and ammonia. Pyruvate is then converted by lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) to lactate with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) as coenzyme. The
rate of NADH conversion to NAD+ is directly proportional to the concentration of
HCT (Δ A340 nm).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was determined following the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI) document EP5-A2. Axis-Shield HCT controls (low, medium and
high) and 3 quality control panel members were assayed (in duplicate), using 2
lots of reagents and calibrators, at 2 separate times per day for 20 days on one
instrument (therefore n=80 for each control and QC panel member). For each run,
freshly dispensed controls and QC panel members were used and the order
sequence for each run was randomized. A calibration curve was generated for
each reagent lot on the first day of testing. The results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Six EDTA plasma sample pools were obtained from healthy volunteers.
Sample pools 1 and 5 were spiked with L-HCT (dimerized HCT) to give HCT
values within the upper range of the assay (46.43 and 43.79 μmol/L
respectively). Sample pools 2 (8.80 μmol/L), 3 (10.43 μmol/L), 4 (13.75
μmol/L) and 6 (17.78 μmol/L) were unaltered samples. All 6 sample pools
were diluted with Cal 0 (0 µmol/L) according to the following scheme:

Sample pools were tested in replicates of 2 with one lot of reagents,
calibrators and Axis-Shield HCT controls (low, medium and high) on the
Olympus AU400. Testing was performed over 2 days. The % recovery for all
samples across the range of the assay ranged from 91 -104%.
To determine dilution linearity, an analysis was carried out in accordance with
CLSI document EP6-A. 1st, 2nd and 3rd order polynomial least squares
regressions analysis was performed for all 6 sample pools. Using this
analysis, sample pools 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 were found to be linear.
For sample pool 1, the p-value for the non-linear co-efficient for the 2nd-order
(b2) polynomial was significant (i.e. p < 0.05). The degree of non linearity
was assessed by calculating the difference and % difference between the
linear and non-linear model at each concentration. These values were within
the acceptance criterion pre-determined by the sponsor. Therefore, the data
for sample pool 1 was considered linear.
The reportable or measurable range of the proposed assay is 1.0 to 46 µmol/L.
Recovery of samples above the upper limit of the assay:
Five EDTA plasma samples with HCT levels of approximately 70, 100, 150,
300 and 500 µmol/L were prepared by spiking with L-HCT. Neat samples
were assayed in duplicate using the proposed device and the mean values were
calculated. Samples containing up to 500 µmol/L HCT gave results above the
upper limit of the assay (50 µmol/L). The samples were also manually diluted
and assayed in duplicate on the proposed assay. The mean µmol/L value of
each sample was calculated and this value was corrected by the dilution factor
and compared to results obtained using a reference method. The results are
summarized below:

The sponsor included the following statement under Limitations of Use:
The linear range of the Liquid Stable (LS) 2-Part Homocysteine Reagent when
run as directed is 1-46 µmol/L. Specimens > 46 µmol/L should be diluted 1 part
specimen to 2 parts Cal 0 µmol/L or 1 part specimen to 9 parts Cal 0 µmol/L as
appropriate.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls: Controls were cleared under k980907 and are sold separately.
Calibrators
Traceability and value assignment: The calibrators are prepared
gravimetrically and are traceable to NIST SRM 1955. Twenty replicates of
test calibrators and 20 replicates of Reference calibrators were tested using
one lot of the proposed device for value assignment. The mean must meet
specifications. The assigned values were confirmed by a designated
measurement procedure (HPLC) and must meet release specifications.
Stability: The stability characteristics of the calibrators were determined
using real-time studies. The unopened shelf-life was determined to be 24
months and the open vial stability was 15 months at the recommended storage
of 2 to 8 °C. The claimed stability of the assay for both unopened and opened
shelf life when stored at 2 to 8 ºC is 12 months.
Calibration Frequency: The calibration curve is valid for 30 days on the
Olympus AU400.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) studies were
conducted according to the recommendations of the CLSI document EP17-A.
LoB
Sixty replicates of Calibrator 0 (0 µmol/L) were run for each lot of reagents
and calibrators. Fresh calibrators and controls were used in each run and all
runs were valid. The mean and the standard deviation (SD) were calculated
for the 60 replicates for both lots. The data sets were normally distributed and
the LoB was calculated as follows: LoB = Mean Cal A result + 1.645 x SD
The LoB for lot 1 was 0.20 µmol/L and 0.18 µmol/L for lot 2.
LoD
At least 60 replicates of 5 low-level HCT EDTA plasma samples (for lot 1)
and 6 low-level HCT EDTA plasma samples (for lot 2) were assayed. Fresh
controls were used for each run and all runs were valid. The samples for both
lots did not follow a Gaussian distribution and could not be transformed to
6

achieve a Gaussian distribution. Therefore, per EP17-A, the following non-
parametric LoD calculation was used: LoD = LoB + Diff, where Diff = Mean
target concentration - 5th percentile concentration of the replicates from the
sample between the LoB and 4*LoB, and Target concentration is estimated as
the median of the replicates from the sample between the LoB and 4*LoB.
The LoD for lot 1 was 0.33 µmol/L. The LoD for lot 2 was 0.32 µmol/L.
The sponsor states in the package insert that the LoD is 0.33 µmol/L. The
claimed measuring range for this assay is 1-46 μmol/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Each of the interference studies were performed using 4 EDTA plasma
samples ranging from 5.9 to 47.2 µmol/L HCT. Some of these samples were
spiked with L-HCT to give samples at the higher end of the measuring range.
The HCT samples containing the potential interferent (test samples) and the
HCT samples not containing the interferent (control samples) were tested in
replicates of 3 using the proposed assay. The following calculation was then
applied to the results:
% Interference (diff) = Mean Conc (test)-Mean conc (control) x 100
Mean Conc (control)
No significant interference was defined as % difference (interference) less
than ± 10%. The results of the studies are summarized below:
Substance Concentrations tested No significant interference

Bilirubin 20 mg/dL 20 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 500 & 1000 mg/dL 500 mg/dL

Cysteine 200 & 500 µmol/L 200 μmol/L
Pyruvate 375 & 1250 µmol/L 1250 μmol/L
Other Limitations: The sponsor included the following limitations in the
package insert:
• Cystathionine is measured with homocysteine, but in the general
population the cystathionine level (0.065 to 0.3 µmol/L) has a negligible
effect. In very rare cases, end stage renal disease and patients with severe
metabolic disturbances, cystathionine levels may rise dramatically and in
severe cases cause greater than 20% interference.
• Hydroxylamine, present in several iron reagents may carryover (reagent
probe or reaction cuvette) and cause falsely low results. Routine rinsing
procedures are not adequate to eliminate this problem in most cases.
Possible solutions would include special washing protocols, changing to

an iron assay that used ascorbic acid as reductant or running iron and
homocysteine assays on separate instruments.
• Carbamazepine, methotrexate, phenytoin, nitrous oxide, or 6-azauridine
triacetate may affect the homocysteine concentration.
• Samples with raised protein levels show >10% difference compared to
results obtained from normal samples and should be avoided.
The labeling contains the following black-box warning. The sponsor also
included the statement under “Limitations of use”:
• Note: Specimens from patients who are on drug therapy involving S-
adenosyl-methionine may show falsely elevated levels of homocysteine.
Patients who are taking methotrexate, carbamazepine, phenytoin, nitrous
oxide, anticonvulsants, or 6-azauridine triacetate, may have elevated levels
of homocysteine due to their effect on the pathway.
f. Assay cut-off:
No cut-off established/required.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
One hundred EDTA plasma samples from apparently healthy donors were
collected. Twenty of the samples were spiked with L-HCT to obtain samples
across the assay range (6.5 to 49.0 µmol/L for the proposed device and 6.3 to
49.3 µmol/L for the predicate assay). The samples were assayed in duplicate
using the predicate assay and in one replicate using the proposed device on the
Olympus AU400. The mean result of the predicate and the single replicate of
the proposed device were used in all subsequent analysis. Passing-Bablok
linear regression method comparison was performed on 94 EDTA plasma
samples. Pearson correlation was used to determine the correlation
coefficient. The results are summarized below:
Slope of regression line 0.991 (95% confidence interval 0.980 to 1.001)
Y-intercept 0.165 (95% confidence interval 0.031 to 0.290)
Correlation coefficient 1.00 (95% confidence interval 1.00 to 1.00)
Average percent bias 0.01% (95% confidence interval -0.10 to 0.07%).
Six samples of the 100 samples tested were identified as outliers following the
outlier testing recommended in the CLSI guideline and were removed from
the final analysis. The outliers contained particulate matter and were lipemic.
The sponsor included the following statement in the package insert:
• Specimens containing particulate matter (fibrin, red blood cells or other
matter) and visibly lipemic specimens should not be used with the assay.
Results from these specimens may be inaccurate.

b. Matrix comparison:
One collection tube of each of the following types was collected from 30
volunteers: EDTA plasma, lithium heparin plasma, serum and serum separator
tube (SST). Six samples were then spiked with L-HCT to obtain HCT
concentrations which covered the measurable range of the proposed assay.
Each sample was tested in replicates of 3 for each of the selected tube types
on the Olympus AU400. The mean concentration of each sample was
calculated for all collection tubes. The percent recovery for each sample was
calculated by comparing the mean value of the EDTA tube type (control tube
type) to the mean value for the corresponding serum, SST, and lithium heparin
tube types for the same sample. The mean % recoveries across all samples for
each of the collection tubes ranged from 94 - 108 %. Therefore, each of the
selected collection tube types is considered suitable for use with the assay.
The sponsor included the following statement in the package insert:
• Serum (collected in serum or serum separator tubes) and plasma (collected
in potassium EDTA or lithium heparin tubes) may be used for the
measurement of homocysteine. However, it is not recommended to use
individual patient results from serum, heparinized plasma and EDTA
plasma interchangeably. Additionally matrix differences between serum
and serum separator tubes and plasma tubes have been reported.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Reference ranges are based on literature references provided in the package insert.
Total HCT values in plasma/serum from 5 to 15 μmol/L are considered normal.
However, total HCT values in plasma/serum differ with age, gender, stress and
other physical conditions. Total HCT values in plasma/serum > 15 μmol/L are
considered abnormal.
The sponsor included the following statement in the package insert:
• The reference range should be determined by each laboratory to confirm the
characteristics of the population being tested.
