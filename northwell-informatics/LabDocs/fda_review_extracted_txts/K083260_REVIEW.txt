L. Test Principle:
The Elecsys Myoglobin Immunoassay includes two applications of the same reagents, the
18 minute Myoglobin assay and 9 minute Myoglobin STAT assay. The assay is a two-
step sandwich immunoassay, using two different monoclonal antibodies directed against
human myoglobin with streptavidin microparticles and electrochemiluminescence
detection. Results are determined via a calibration curve which is instrument-specifically
generated by a 2-point calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent barcode.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision for the Elecsys Myoglobin (18 minute) assay was evaluated on the
Elecsys 2010 analyzer. The protocol consisted of testing each control (PCC =
PreciControl Cardiac 1 & 2) and human serum samples (HS) at 3 levels, high
medium and low. Testing included 6 replicates each day for 10 days. Both total
and within run precision were calculated according to CLSI EP5-A2.

d. Detection limit:
Myoglobin 18 minute assay
LoB was determined for the Myoglobin assay (18 minute) on the Elecsys 2010
analyzer according to CLSI EP 17-A. Five analyte free human serum samples
were measured on 2 Elecsys 2010 analyzers in 6 runs per instrument. In total 60
measuring points were collected. The LoB was determined to be 17.937 ng/mL.
The LoB claim in the labeling is 18.0 ng/mL.
The protocol for LoD determination consisted of testing 5 human serum samples
with low analyte concentration on 2 Elecsys 2010 analyzers in 6 runs per
instrument. The LoD determination was based on the LoB and the standard
deviation of the low concentration samples. The total standard deviation was 1.54.
The LoD was determined to be 19.98 ng/mL. The LoD claim in the package insert
is 21 ng/mL.
The LoQ was determined as the lowest amount of analyte that can be measured

The Myoglobin assay has a measuring range of 21-3000 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity and endogenous interference studies:
The sponsor’s definition of non-interference is recovery within ± 10% compared
to reference without any interfering substance.
50 total pharmaceutical compounds were examined for potential interference with
the Myoglobin assay. No interference with the assay was found.
Samples of different myoglobin concentrations were analyzed for each
endogenous interferent using the Elecsys Myoglobin STAT assay on the Elecsys
2010 analyzer.
Hemolysis: To investigate the influence of hemoglobin, 4 samples with
myoglobin values of 71, 117, 165 and 2600 ng/mL were spiked with hemoglobin
and compared to an unaltered aliquot of the sample. No interference was found up
to 1.4 g/dL hemoglobin.
Lipemia: To investigate the influence of lipemia, 3 samples with myoglobin
values of 113, 530, 2176 ng/mL were spiked with intralipid and compared to an
unaltered aliquot of the sample. No interference was found up to 2200 mg/dL
intralipid.
Bilirubin: To investigate the influence of bilirubin, 4 samples with myoglobin
values of 73, 182, 198 and 2700 ng/mL were spiked with bilirubin and compared
to an unaltered aliquot of the sample. No interference was found up to 65 mg/dL
bilirubin.
Biotin: To investigate the influence of biotin, 3 samples with myoglobin values
of 41, 294 and 2300 ng/mL were spiked with biotin and compared to an unaltered
aliquot of the sample. No interference was found up to 50 ng/dL biotin.
No high dose hook effect was found at myoglobin concentrations up to 30,000
ng/mL.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed comparing the values obtained with
the ELECSYS Myoglobin STAT assay with the predicate Elecsys Myoglobin
STAT assay (k983176) on the Elecsys 2010 analyzer. 139 samples were tested in
singlicate with myoglobin values ranging from 23 to 2523 ng/mL. The results
were calculated using Passing-Bablock regression. The resulting regression
equation was y = 1.044 – 2.076x, r = 0.9875.
A method comparison study was performed comparing the values obtained with

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Expected values for the Elecsys Myoglobin Test System were defined based upon
two reference range multicenter studies conducted in 1999. Testing took place in 10
countries using self-reported healthy individuals, blood donors, ambulatory patients
and hospital workers. Results were obtained from the Elecsys 1010 and the 2010
immunoassay analyzers using the Myoglobin STAT reagent. This information is
transferable between the Elecsys Myoglobin 18 min. assay and STAT applications.
Both the 18 min and the STAT versions of the product are the exact same
formulation. The difference is that one assay utilizes a 9 minute incubation time and
the other an 18 minute incubation time. The method comparisons demonstrate
acceptable correlation.
Expected values were determined to be:
Number 2.5 – 97.5 %
Men 1030 28-72 ng/mL
Women 1132 25-58 ng/mL
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
