--- Page 2 ---
For use with MicroScan® Dried Gram Negative MIC/Combo, Dried Gram
Negative Breakpoint Combo panels. MicroScan® panels are designed for use in
determining antimicrobial agent susceptibility and/or identification to the species
level of aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacilli.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The MicroScan® Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panel is used to determine
quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies
grown on solid media of rapidly growing aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-
negative bacilli. After inoculation, panels are incubated for 16 - 20 hours at 35°C
+/- 1°C in a non-CO2 incubator, and read either visually or with MicroScan
instrumentation, according to the Package Insert.
This particular submission is indicated for the addition of the antimicrobial
Tigecycline at concentrations of 0.015 – 32 μg/mL to the gram negative
susceptibility panel for testing Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, E. coli,
K. oxytoca, and K. pneumoniae.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
“Do Not Report” with Proteus mirabilis.
The performance of Tigecycline has not been established with Stationary and Log
Inoculum methods. Inoculum should be prepared with turbidity or Prompt™
method.
The ability of the MicroScan Dried Negative panels to detect resistance to
Tigecycline is unknown because resistant strains were not available at the time of
comparative testing.
4. Special instrument requirements:
These panels can be read at > 16 hours of incubation either manually,
automatically on the autoScan® 4, or with the WalkAway® instrument systems.
I. Device Description:
The MicroScan® Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panel contains microdilutions
of each antimicrobial agent in various concentrations with Mueller Hinton Broth and
various nutrients which are dehydrated and dried in panels. Each panel contains two
control wells: a no-growth control well (contains water only/no nutrients or broth),
and a growth control well (contains test medium without antibiotic). The panel is
rehydrated and inoculated at the same time with 0.1 ml of suspension prepared by the
turbidity method (inoculum prepared in water, then 0.1ml transferred to 25ml of
inoculum water containing pluronic-D/F-a wetting solution) for a final inoculum
concentration of 3-7 X 105. The Prompt® method of inoculation is also
2

recommended as an alternate means of preparing the inoculum. The panels are
incubated at 35o C in a non-CO for 16-20 hours and read by visual observation of
2
growth. Panels may also be read automatically with the WalkAway® or the
AutoScan®4.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S18) “Methods
for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;
Approved Standard”.
L. Test Principle:
The antimicrobial susceptibility tests are miniaturizations of the broth dilution
susceptibility test which have been dehydrated. Various antimicrobial agents are
diluted in Mueller-Hinton broth supplemented with calcium and magnesium to
concentrations bridging the range of clinical interest. Breakpoint Combo panels use
concentrations equivalent to the categorical breakpoints of CLSI. After inoculation
and rehydration with a standardized suspension of organism and incubation at 35°C
for a minimum of 16 hours, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the test
organism is determined by observing the lowest antimicrobial concentration showing
inhibition of growth.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using 10 isolates tested at 3 sites on 3
separate days in triplicate. All ten isolates had a mode that was on scale. The
mode was determined by the method used and therefore it is not always the
same for each method. The study included the testing of the following
inoculum and reading variables; turbidity inoculum method and Prompt®
method of inoculation with reading performed manually using a touchScan®
SR, autoScan 4® or the WalkAway® instrument. Even though such
variability between methods exists, all read methods demonstrated a
reproducibility of >95%.
The following table provides the overall results for all combinations of these
variables.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Quality Control was performed daily with the turbidity method, and Prompt®

repeat the number of times a result was obtained at each concentration.

Quality control results demonstrated the ability of all variables of the procedure
(reading and inoculation) to produce acceptable results most of the time. There
appears to be a slight trend where the modes of the turbidity and Prompt®
inoculation methods with the different read methods are one dilution higher
compared to the mode of the reference method.
Inoculum density control: A turbidity meter was used for the turbidity inoculation
method. The Prompt® method of inoculation had colony counts (CC) performed
periodically throughout the study to determine the average inoculum density since
there is no visual check of the inoculum using this device. The Prompt® method
of inoculation had an average of 4.83 x 105 CFU/mL for E. coli ATCC 25922
with a range of 1.2 x 105 to 1.68 x 106 CFU/mL.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical testing was performed at three sites using fresh isolates supplemented
with stock isolates of gram negative organisms. A comparison of the
MicroScan® Dried Gram-Negative test panel results was made to the
reference method as recommended in the CLSI standard M7-A7, with the
following deviations from that recommendation: Pluronic-F is used as the
inoculum in the frozen reference panels. This is composed of water which
contains a very small amount (0.1) of Pluronic to provide a smoother draw of
liquid into the inoculator.
Reference panels were made using the cation adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth
and read visually after 16 – 20 hours of incubation at 35°C in a non-CO2
incubator. Testing of the reference method and the MicroScan panels was
performed at the same time. A challenge set was also tested at one site and
compared to the reference broth dilution result mode that was determined by
previous testing of each isolate multiple times in the recommended reference
panel. All isolates tested grew in the MicroScan panels.

Evaluable results are those that fall within the test range of the reference
method and could also be on-scale with the new device if within the
plus/minus one dilution variability. EA is when there is agreement
between the reference method and the MicroScan® within plus or minus
one serial two-fold dilution of antibiotic. CA is when the interpretation of
the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the
MicroScan® result.
The challenge set of organisms was also tested using the Prompt® method and
turbidity method of inoculation with all reading methods. This included 75
challenge isolates that were tested at one site. All read methods had a >95%
essential agreement.
The following table demonstrates the performance based on essential agreement
and category agreement for the challenge set and the different inoculation and
reading methods.
