Testing should not be performed unless the patient meets the most current U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) clinical and epidemiologic
criteria for testing suspect A/H5 specimens. The definitive identification of influenza
A/H5 either directly from patient specimens or from viral cultures requires additional
laboratory testing, along with clinical and epidemiological assessment in consultation
with national influenza surveillance experts.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as
the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
• For prescription use only
• The AVantage™ A/H5N1 Flu Test is indicated for use only in high complexity
laboratories.
• Although this test has been shown to detect cultured human-derived Influenza A
subtype H5N1 virus, the performance characteristics of this test with specimens
from humans infected with H5N1 or other avian influenza viruses are unknown.
• May also detect other subtypes of influenza A viruses that express NS1 protein
with the following binding domain sequence motifs: ESKV, ESEV, and ESEI.
• It has been reported (2) that binding domains detected by the AVantage™
A/H5N1 Flu Test can be present in viruses infecting swine and equine hosts. The
performance of the test with viruses infecting swine and other animal hosts, or
specimens from humans infected with swine influenza viruses has not been
established.
• Monoclonal antibodies or PDZ’s may fail to detect or show lower sensitivity of
detection with influenza A viruses that have undergone reassortment or amino acid
changes in the target epitope region.
• The performance of the AVantage™ A/H5N1 Flu Test with specimens obtained
from humans infected with influenza A H7N3, H7N7, and H7N2 viruses has not
been established.
• The AVantage™ A/H5N1 Flu Test does not detect avian or human viruses with the
binding domain containing the EPEV motif. The EPEV PL does not bind to the
PDZ in Line 1 of the test to any measurable extent. The EPEV binding domain
was characteristic in clade 0 avian viruses and human derived viruses (3). No clade
0 infections have been reported since 2002.
4. Special instrument requirements:
None

I. Device Description:
The AVantage™ A/H5N1 Flu Test is a rapid immunoassay that detects the presence
of the influenza A/H5N1 virus from nasal swabs or throat swabs using a combination
of gold-conjugated pan-reactive monoclonal anti-influenza A antibodies and
recombinant proteins containing PDZ domains to selectively capture the nonstructural
protein 1 (NS1) from H5N1. The PDZ proteins uniquely bind PDZ ligands (PL)
through specific amino acid sequences at carboxy-terminus of the PL. The carboxy-
terminus sequences of NS1 are unique and different in H5N1 as compared to seasonal
influenza (2) and provide the scientific basis for selective and specific detection of
avian influenza viruses containing ESKV, ESEV, and ESEI sequence motifs in the PL
of the NS1 protein.

L. Test Principle:
The AVantage™ A/H5N1 Flu Test comprises a cassette containing a lateral flow strip
with a positive control line and two test lines. The control line contains goat anti-
mouse polyclonal antibody. Test Line 1 (PDZ #1) contains N-terminal GST-tagged
fusion protein, PDZ domain 2 from the PSD 95 protein (GI: 197927399) (12) with
preferential binding to H5N1 NS1. Test Line 2 (PDZ #2) preferentially binds to NS1
protein from seasonal influenza subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 and contains PDZ domain
8 from the INADL protein (GI:112382256) (13). A fourth line printed just above line
2 also contains PDZ #2 and binds excess non-H5N1 protein from a sample. The
AVantage™ test has been demonstrated to specifically detect NS1 protein from

H5N1 Clades 1, 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3. Other subtypes of influenza A viruses that express
NS1 protein with identical binding domain sequence motifs may also be detected.
The patient sample is transferred to the lyophilized Lysis Buffer vial (Reagent A),
where cells are lysed releasing intracellular proteins. The Loading Buffer (Reagent B)
is added to condition the sample. The sample is then added to the Detector (Reagent
C), which contains lyophilized colloidal gold-conjugated monoclonal anti-influenza A
antibodies that recognize a broad range of influenza A subtypes and strains. After re-
suspension of the antibodies, the solution is added to the sample well of the
AVantage™ A/H5N1 Flu Test cassette, where NS1 protein in the specimen will react
with reagents on the membrane of the cassette. The results are interpreted visually by
observing the presence or absence and relative intensity of the color lines at the
indicated locations on the membrane.
Interpretation of Results:
Expected Performance of External Controls
Each AVantage™ A/H5N1 Flu Test Kit includes an external positive control
containing recombinant influenza A H5N1 NS1 protein. M4 Viral Transport Media
(Remel) should be used as the negative control. External positive and negative
controls should be performed in conformance with local, state, and federal regulations
or accreditation requirements and the user’s laboratory’s standard quality control
procedures. At a minimum, a positive and a negative control test must be performed
and the expected results documented prior to using each kit for the first time. The kit
should be used for patient specimens only if both the positive and negative controls
tests yield expected results.
Specimen Results and Interpretation
Test cassette must be read between 30-45 minutes after sample transfer to the cassette.
Readings outside this window of time may affect the accuracy of results.
Appearance of red line(s) indicates a reaction. Lines can occur in four positions. Lines for
test interpretation are position C (control), position 1 or / and position 2.
Note: If two lines appear close to each other near the bottom of the read window,
always read the lower one as Line 2.

Report the specimen to be presumptive positive for influenza A/H5 virus and notify
immediately the appropriate local, state or federal public health authorities to
coordinate transfer of the specimen for additional testing.
Test is Invalid
– If no Control line (C) is present, OR
– If the Control line is present and both Line 1 and Line 2
intensities are greater than Control Line intensity
(proceed immediately to section VI).
ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR INVALID SAMPLES
IMPORTANT: For an invalid test which shows both Line 1 and Line 2 intensities are
greater than Control Line intensity, dilute sample 1:10 in M4 VTM and repeat the
AVantage™ A/H5N1 Flu Test with the diluted sample. This result may occur with
samples having high viral concentrations such as viral culture specimens.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within Laboratory Precision
The within laboratory precision of the AVantage™ A/H5N1Flu Test was
demonstrated by conducting within-laboratory testing of full length recombinant
protein H5N1 NS1 analyte (A/Viet Nam/1194/2004 (H5N1) isolate) spiked into
M4 VTM at "high negative", "low positive", and a "moderate positive"
concentrations.
1. High Negative (C ) 4 pg NS1/100 µL M4
5
2. Low positive (C ) 9 pg NS1/100 µL M4
95
3. Moderate positive (2.7*C ) 24 pg NS1/100 µL M4
95
The tests were conducted at Arbor Vita Corporation over 12 days, two runs per
day, in duplicate per H5N1 NS1 analyte concentration, for a total of 48 tests per
analyte level. A Negative control was included in each run.

Sample Type
Positive
High Negative 4+/48
Low Positive 46+/48
Moderate Positive 48+/48
Negative Control 0+/24
Performance of the assay was consistent with the Negative Control yielding 100%
negative results, the High Negative sample yielding 8% positive results while the Low
Positive and Moderate Positive samples respectively yielded 96% and 100% positive
results.
Reproducibility
The reproducibility of the AVantage™ A/H5N1 Flu Test was determined by
measuring the consistency of assay performance using the full length recombinant
protein H5N1 NS1 analyte (A/Viet Nam/1194/2004 (H5N1) isolate) spiked in M4
VTM at levels of 0.4xLoD (High Negative), 2.7xLoD (Moderate Positive) and
4xLoD (High Positive). Since the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1 protein) is not part
of the intact virion but rather is expressed in infected cells and released into
secretions and/or media, recombinant NS1 protein expressed in mammalian cells
was used for the reproducibility study. Due to safety concerns a reproducibility
study with live H5N1 virus infected cells was not performed.
The testing was conducted over five days at three sites with two operators at each
site. A Negative control was included in each run. On the fifth day an additional
Challenge Sample was tested at each site. This sample had no H5N1 NS1 protein
but did include 250 pg/100 µL of recombinant H1N1 NS1 protein
(A/Taiwan/112/1996(H1N1)).
Summary of Reproducibility Study Results
Results of interpretations at each site and for each sample type are combined for
each operator across the five different days of testing. Visual interpretations are
designated as negative (-) or positive (+).

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Assay Controls
Quality Control requirements must be performed in conformance with local, state,
and/or federal regulations or accreditation requirements and a laboratory’s
standard quality control procedures. It is recommended that the user refer to CLSI
document C24-A3.
Each AVantage™ A/H5N1 Flu Test Kit contains an internal procedural positive
control. When running the test, the appearance of a red Control Line in each test
indicates proper function of the buffer reagents, capillary flow, and functional
integrity of the test strip within the cassette. If the Control Line does not appear,
the test is considered Invalid.
External positive control provided with the kit contains a non-pathogenic,
lyophilized pellet of recombinant NS-1 protein that must be reconstituted in M4
(VTM) solution prior to use.
External negative control is not provided with the kit. M4 Viral Transport Media
(Remel) should be used as the negative control sample. The kit should not be used
if external control tests do not produce the correct results.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical Sensitivity
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined using a full length recombinant
NS1 protein from Influenza A virus (A/Viet Nam/1194/2004 (H5N1) clade 1 and
two H5N1 clade 2.2 cultured viruses derived from clinical specimens. The LoD
was calculated as the lowest detectable level of the analyte at which approximately
95% of all replicates tested positive using visual interpretation.
Serial dilutions of the recombinant H5N1 NS1 protein in M4 medium were
prepared and tested in the AVantage™ A/H5N1 Flu Test assay in replicates of
four. The lowest dilution (12 pg/100µL) expected to yield 4/4 positive results
from this titration was then chosen as the nominal (N) and three additional
dilutions with concentrations N, 0.5N and 0.75N were prepared. Each of these
concentrations and a negative control were tested in replicates of 20 with the
AVantage™ A/H5N1 Flu Test. The LoD was determined to be 9 pg/100 µL.

Based on the preliminary results the specimens were further diluted 1/50, 1/100,
and 1/200 in a background of Negative Clinical Pool (NCP) and tested in triplicate
to determine the LoD. Additional 20 replicates of the 1/100 and 1/200 dilutions
were tested to confirm the LoD.

e. Analytical specificity:
Analytical specificity of the AVantage™ A/H5N1 Flu Test was evaluated with
respect to 1) reactivity (inclusivity) with a number of human-derived cultured
viruses and full length NS1 recombinant proteins representing geographically
diverse H5N1 viruses 2) potential cross-reactivity with non-influenza pathogens
associated with respiratory tract infections and 3) potential interference by
substances commonly encountered in nasal and throat specimens.
1) Reactivity/Inclusivity
Clinical reactivity of AVantage™A/H5N1 Flu Test with H5N1 viruses from Clade
2.2 was demonstrated by testing 24 independent viral culture samples all identified
as Clade 2.2. The NS1 protein PDZ Ligand (or PL) from Clade 2.2 H5N1 viruses
is predominantly ESEV (99%) with rare instances of ESEI PL.

Analytical reactivity of the AVantage™ A/H5N1 Flu Test with H5N1 viruses from
Clades 1, 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 was further demonstrated by testing full length
recombinant NS1 proteins containing the PLs ESKV, ESEV, and ESEI.
2) Cross-Reactivity
The AVantage™ A/H5N1 Flu Test was evaluated for potential cross-reactivity
(analytical specificity) with a total of 21 bacterial and 28 viral isolates representing
common respiratory pathogens or flora commonly present in nasal and throat
clinical specimens. The bacterial isolates were tested at concentrations of
approximately 1.5x108 cfu/mL. The viral isolates were tested at concentrations of
104 – 109 TCID /mL, or 102 – 104 CEID /mL. Testing for each organism was
50 50
performed in triplicate. None of the pathogens tested exhibited cross-reactivity
with the assay.

Bioinformatic Analysis and AVantage™ A/H5N1 Flu Test Inclusivity and
Cross Reactivity
There have been reported cases of humans infected with pathogenic influenza
A H7N3, H7N7, and H7N2 subtypes. Based on bioinformatics analysis of the full
length NS1 sequences from H7 viruses isolated from humans, the AVantage™
A/H5N1 Flu Test will likely detect samples from such cases as positive. Out of
four (4) NS1 PL sequences available in GenBank, two (2) H7N7 NS1 PLs are
ESEV, one (1) H7N3 NS1 PL is ESEV, and one (1) H7N2 NS1 PL is ESEI (11).
The performance of the AVantage™ A/H5N1 Flu Test with specimens
obtained from humans infected with these viruses has not been established.
The AVantage ™ A/H5N1 Flu Test detects the H5N1 influenza virus NS1 protein
by its C-terminal PDZ-ligand sequence (or PL). The PL sequence distribution
among influenza A subtypes supports high specificity for all tested H5N1 with no
cross reactivity with other subtypes. As shown in the tables, for each subtype
there is a predominant NS1 PL sequence in isolates found throughout the world

and over time. In addition, these sequences include many strains, suggesting that
the PL is highly invariant. The PLs found in H1 and H3 are biochemically distinct
from those observed in H5N1. The H1/H3 PLs have been demonstrated to bind to
PDZs with different affinities relative to H5N1. In the clinical study 168 patient
samples positive for seasonal influenza were tested using the AVantage ™
A/H5N1 Flu Test without any false positive results for H5N1.

3. Clinical studies:
The performance of the AVantage™ A/H5N1Flu Test was assessed in a
prospective clinical study during the 2007-2008 influenza season (December 07-
March 08). Due to the rare occurrence of H5N1 infection, 27 retrospective
specimens from infected individuals collected in the course of WHO/NAMRU-3
(World Health Organization; Naval Medical Research Unit-3) pandemic
surveillance and response activities were tested to demonstrate the performance of
the AVantage™ A/H5N1 Flu Test in detecting the influenza A/H5N1 virus.
a and b. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
Prospective Study
A total of 464 symptomatic subjects were recruited from four clinics at three US
sites into a respiratory illness surveillance study conducted by the Naval Health
Research Center (NHRC). Of these 464 subjects, 110 had influenza infection, 73
subjects had Influenza A (113 positive specimens) and 37 subjects had Influenza B
(55 positive specimens). Swab sample collection was attempted from two
anatomical sites, nasal and throat, for each subject. For twenty subjects only one
sample was obtained (15 nasal only, 5 throat only), resulting in a total of 908
specimens. The reference method was viral culture followed by
Immunoflourescence Assay (IFA) based on unlabeled influenza A or B specific
mouse monoclonal antibody visualized with fluorescein-labeled anti-mouse
polyclonal antibodies. The hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) assay was used for
subtyping of influenza A positive specimens.
Of the 908 samples tested, invalid results were reported for 13 samples, (1.4%)
and were not included in the analyses. A total of 895 sample results were included
in the study.

Retrospective Study
Due to the rare occurrence of H5N1 infection and the absence of infection in the
United States, a formal prospective clinical evaluation of human and/or avian
influenza A/H5N1 virus could not be accomplished. To demonstrate performance
of the AVantage™ A/H5N1 Flu Test detecting influenza A/H5N1 virus
retrospective specimens from infected individuals collected in the course of
WHO/NAMRU-3 pandemic surveillance and response activities were tested. All
isolates were classified as Clade 2.2 and were part of the CDC global H5N1
repository.
The 24 human-derived H5N1 viral culture specimens were grown in MDCK cells
or eggs. Included in the study were three H5N1 negative samples. Study
personnel were blinded to the true H5N1 status. The reference method used to
verify H5N1-positive status of the viral culture samples was HAI. Eleven of these
specimens were from first passage cultures, and 13 of the specimens were from
second passage cultures. The study was conducted at a BSL-3 facility.

rate has been over 60% among those infected. The World Health Organization is
tracking the outbreaks of the virus and coordinating the global response to human
cases of H5N1 avian influenza http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/en/
The definitive identification of influenza A/H5 either directly from patient
specimens or from viral cultures requires additional laboratory testing, along with
clinical and epidemiological assessment in consultation with national influenza
surveillance experts.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
