L. Test Principle:
The assay is a solid-phase, two-step, chemiluminiscent immunoassay that exploits
liquid phase kinetics in a bead format. The allergens are covalently bound to a soluble
polymer/co-polymer matrix, which is labeled with a ligand. The assay specific
antibody is labeled with alkaline phosphatase. The use of an amino acid co-polymer
amplifies the amount of allergen that the matrix can support. The chemiluminiscent
detection system is a phosphatase ester of stabilized dioxatane. Cleavage of the

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
For the intra-assay study, three positive samples and one negative control
sample for each of the six allergens (Red Maple, White Hickory, Red Cedar,
Sweet Gum, Common Sagebrush, Wing Scale) were analyzed 80 times (for
each allergens) in one run. For the inter-assay study, the same samples were
analyzed 80 times in 2 different runs. The acceptable criterion for the negative
sample is for the average dose must be <0.10 kU/L. All negative sample
results were within the acceptance criterion. The acceptable criterion for the
positive samples is ≤15% for both intra-assay and inter-assay studies. The
intra-assay CV ranges were from 3.04% to 5.24%. The inter-assay CV ranges
were from 4.27% to 7.03% (see table below).

Lot to lot reproducibility:
Three lots were analyzed using 3 positive samples on each of the six allergens
were analyzed 240 times. The acceptable criterion is ≤20%. The lowest
variability was 1% and highest variability was 2%. All three different lots for
the six allergens had <20% variability.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies:
For each allergen, two samples were diluted in 2-fold serial dilutions to 5
levels. The undiluted (neat) and diluted samples were tested with the specific
allergen to demonstrate linearity at concentrations within the assay limits.

d. Detection limit:
Analytical sensitivity: 0.1 kU/L
e. Analytical specificity:
Inhibition studies:
Specificity of each allergen was verified through competitive inhibition
testing using a single serum sample or pool of sera. A negative sample was
used to measure the background response.
To initiate the inhibition experiment, 70µL of undiluted and 4 levels of 5-fold
serially diluted inhibitor extract were mixed with 250 µL of sample or pool.
This mixture was incubated at room temperature (15-28°C) for 1 hour
allowing the immunological reaction to occur. Each sample mixture
containing the inhibitor extract and the appropriate controls was assayed with
1 lot of each allergen. The percent (%) inhibition was calculated according to
the following formula:
(Response of pos. control – sample response with inhibitor extract)
(pos. sample – neg. sample) X 100
(Response of pos. control )
(pos. sample – neg. sample)
The inhibition study demonstrated that the allergens tested are inhibited by the
relevant inhibitor extract in a concentration dependent fashion. Also, the target
% inhibition of 50% was met. These results indicate specificity of the red
maple, white hickory, red cedar, sweet gum, common sagebrush and wing

Clinical performance of the allergens was demonstrated by testing samples
from non-atopic individuals and atopic patients with case histories of
suspected clinical reactions to the specific allergen or allergy group in the
