I. Device Description:
The IMMULITE 2000 Free T4 is a solid-phase, enzyme-labeled chemiluminescent
competitive immunoassay. The assay kit includes bead packs, reagent wedges, and
adjustors (calibrators). The solid phase (bead) is coated with monoclonal murine anti-
T4 antibody. The liquid phase consists of alkaline phosphatase (bovine calf intestine)
conjugated to T4.
Source materials derived from human blood were tested and found nonreactive for
syphilis; for antibodies to HIV 1 and 2; for hepatitis B surface antigen; and for
antibodies to hepatitis C.

L. Test Principle:
The patient sample and the reagent are incubated together with the coated bead
for 30 minutes. During this time, free T4 in the sample competes with enzyme
conjugated T4 in the buffer for a limited number of antibody binding sites on the
bead. Unbound patient sample and enzyme conjugate are then removed by
centrifugal washes. Finally, the chemiluminescent substrate is added to the
reaction tube containing the bead and the signal is generated in proportion to the
bound enzyme.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated in accordance with CLSI document EP5-A2. 6 serum
pools and one control sample were processed in duplicate over the course of
20 days, two runs per day, for a total of 40 runs and 80 replicates using the
IMMULITE 2000 analyzer. The precision data are summarized as follows:
Within-Run Total
Material/ Sample # Mean SD CV SD CV
# Rep (ng/dL) (ng/dL) (%) (ng/dL) (%)
Pool 04 80 0.39 0.037 9.5 0.052 13.3
Pool 05 80 0.51 0.040 7.8 0.052 10.2
Pool 06 80 0.85 0.038 4.5 0.060 7.1
Control 80 1.13 0.067 5.9 0.072 6.4
Pool 07 80 1.49 0.072 4.8 0.090 6.0
Pool 08 80 2.91 0.103 3.5 0.104 3.6
Pool 09 80 4.82 0.144 3.0 0.172 3.6
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated by assaying free T4 calibrators A through F (ranging
from 0 to 6.4 ng/dL) as unknowns. Calibrators are mixed to create
intermediate values for a total of 10 different concentrations. Each sample
was measured in replicates of 5 using the IMMULITE 2000 analyzer. The
percent recovery across all samples was calculated and the % recovery ranged
from 91% to 119%.
In addition, the expected values (X) were plot against the observed values (Y)
and a line fit was plotted. The linear regression is calculated as Y= 0.9725X +
0.0617. R2= 0.995.
The data provided support the sponsor’s claim for a reportable range of 0.3
ng/dL – 6 ng/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The IMMULITE 2000 Free T4 assay is traceable to an internal material.
Stability:
Stability testing included real-time testing of the assay kit in addition to stress
testing designed to simulate storage/stress conditions. Stress testing studies
support real-time stability claims and the conditions tested were 3 day storage

at 37 oC, 7 day storage at room temperature (15-30 oC), and 3 freeze/thaw
cycles (freeze -30 oC to -5 oC, thaw at 2-8 oC).
The IMMULITE 2000 Free T4 assay kit is stable for 330 days (unopened)
when stored at 2-8 oC. On-board the IMMULITE 2000 analyzer, the reagent
is stable after opening for 92 days. The calibrators are stable at 2-8 oC for 30
days or at -20oC for 6 months (aliquoted).
d. Detection limit:
The limit of the blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) were determined in
accordance with the guidelines of CLSI document EP17-A using the
IMMULITE 2000 analyzer. A zero calibrator was assayed 60 times on 3
instruments 60 using 3 lots to determine the LoB. Three low serum pools and
zero calibrator were assayed twice a day for 20 days on 2 instruments, using 3
lots to determine the LoD. Functional sensitivity of the assay was determined
by plotting the results of the precision studies (coefficient of variance (CV) vs.
mean Free T4 concentration) and reporting the Free T4 concentration with a
CV of 20%. The results were as follows:
LoB = 0.05 ng/dL (non parametric)
LoD = 0.13 ng/dL (parametric)
Functional Sensitivity = 0.25 ng/dL
The assay has a reportable range is 0.3 ng/dL – 6 ng/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
i. Interference from endogenous substances:
Potential interfering substances (unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin,
triglycerides, hemoglobin) were spiked into aliquots of patient samples.
Unspiked aliquots served as the control. Samples were selected so that
free T4 levels spanned the range of the assay, and interferents were tested
at a range of concentrations using the IMMULITE 2000 analyzer. The
sponsor states that no significant interference occurs if the percent
recovery is between 85 – 115% across samples. No significant
interference was observed for the following levels of interferents:
Triglycerides: up to 1000 mg/dL
Conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin: up to 20 mg/dL,
Hemoglobin: up to 634 mg/dL.
ii. Cross-reactivity:
Concentrations of potentially cross-reacting substances were spiked into a
zero analyte sample. Percent cross-reactivity was calculated using the
5

--- Page 6 ---
following equation:
(zero analyte sample dose recovery) / (amount of compound
added) x 100 = % cross-reactivity
The results were as follows:

which were spiked) ranging from 0.3 ng/dL to 5.2 ng/dL on the IMMULITE
2000 analyzer using Free T4 assay (new device) and ADVIA Centaur FT4

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Expected values generated by the predicate device (ADVIA FT4 assay) using 283
samples were verified by using 158 apparently healthy subjects with the
IMMULITE 2000 FT4 assay (candidate device). Using the 158 apparently healthy
subjects analyzed using the non parametric percentile (2.5 and 97.5) the range
obtained was 0.88 to 1.87. Based on the closeness of the method comparison
between the predicate and candidate devices, the sponsor claimed that the
expected values are transferable to the candidate device. Method comparison
regression equation: y=1.06X – 0.0001, coefficient correlation = 0.981, (see
section M.2.a above).
Expected results presented in the labeling are as follows:
Clinical Condition FT4 Range (ng/dL) FT4 Range (pmol/L)
Euthyroid 0.89 -1.76 11.5 -22.7
Hypothyroid less than 0.89 less than 11.5
Hyperthyroid greater than 1.76 greater than 22.7
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
