L. Test Principle:
The Calcium_2 (CA_2) method is based on the work of Michaylova and Illkova, who
found that Arsenazo III could form a stable complex with calcium with high
selectivity at low pH. The ADVIA 1650 system automatically predilutes the sample
with saline by 5-fold. The sample predilution allows for very small sample volumes
to be used for multiple tests run in random access on the analyzer. From the diluted
sample, 4 uL is added to 100 uL of the reagent, mixed, and incubated for 5 minutes at
37C. Calcium ions form a colored complex with Arsenazo III, which is measured at
658 nm. Absorbances of test samples are compared with that of the Calibrator to
convert signal into calcium concentrations reported to the customer. The amount of
calcium present in the sample is directly proportional to the intensity of the colored
complex formed.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:

Precision was evaluated using CLSI document EP05-A2 as a guideline.
Samples from two serum controls, two urine controls, one spiked serum pool,
and one spiked, urine pool were tested. Each sample was assayed 2 times per

run, 2 runs per day for 10 days, totaling 40 replicates using the ADVIA 1650
system. The experiment was run using one reagent lot on two systems for
serum and one reagent lot on one system for urine. Medical decision levels, as
well as normal range and abnormal range of the assay were challenged in this
experiment.
The precision data are summarized as follows:
Within Run Total
Product Mean (mg/dL) N SD %CV SD %CV
serum
(control) 5.82 40 0.08 1.4 0.12 2.1
serum
(control) 9.81 40 0.12 1.3 0.13 1.3
serum (serum
pool, spiked) 13.83 40 0.07 0.5 0.11 0.8
urine (control) 5.95 40 0.07 1.2 0.18 3.0
urine (control) 11.80 40 0.11 0.9 0.18 1.6
urine (urine
pool, spiked) 23.61 40 0.11 0.5 0.50 2.1
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated by comparing observed values versus expected values
for 9 equally-spaced diluted samples prepared from high and low pools
(separately for serum and urine). Each sample was measured in replicates of 3
using the ADVIA 1650 analyzer. The percent recovery for serum samples was
within 100 – 105.5% and for urine samples it was within 100 – 106.1%.
In addition, the expected values (X) were plotted against the observed values
(Y) and a line fit was plotted. The linear regression for serum samples is Y=
1.0026X + 0.1679, r= 0.9998. For urine samples, the linear regression is Y =
0.9971X = 0.3775, r = 0.9998.
The data provided supported the sponsor’s claim that this assay has a
reportable range of 1 – 16 mg/dL for serum samples and 1 – 32 mg/dL for
urine samples.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The ADVIA CA_2 method is traceable to an internal Siemens reference
method (Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission), which uses reference

materials from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), via
patient sample correlation.
Stability:
The reagent has an on-board stability of 30 days on the ADVIA 1200, ADVIA
1650/1800, and ADVIA 2400 systems. Unopened reagents are stable until the
expiration date when stored at 15 – 25oC. Reagents should not be frozen.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of the blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) were determined in
accordance with the guidelines of CLSI document EP17-A using the ADVIA
1650 analyzer. Deionized water, low serum control material and low urine
sample material were used to determine the LoB and LoD. Functional
sensitivity of the assay was not calculated. Testing was conducted over a
period of 10 days, with 2 runs per day using one system and one reagent lot.
A total of 40 replicates of the blank sample, and 40 replicates of the low
samples were run. The results are as follows:
LoB (serum) = 0.12 mg/dL
LoB (urine) = 0.09 mg/dL
LoD (serum) = 0.31 mg/dL
LoD (urine) = 0.25 mg/dL
The assay has a reportable range of 1 – 16 mg/dL for serum samples and 1 –
32 mg/dL for urine samples.
e. Analytical specificity:
i. Interference from endogenous substances:
Potential interfering substances [unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin,
triglycerides (using Intralipid and avian TRIG), and hemoglobin] were
spiked into two pools of human serum samples. The calcium
concentrations of the two pools were 6 mg/dL and 12 mg/dL. Two
chelated Gadolinium contrast agents were also tested for interference,
gadodiamide (Omniscan) and gadoversetamide (Optimark). Unspiked
aliquots served as the control, and the analysis was performed using an
ADVIA 1650 analyzer. The sponsor claims no significant interference if
the % recovery is < 10% between the tested and the control samples.
Percent recoveries ranged from 100 to 109.8%. No significant interference
was observed for the following levels of interferents:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed using 172 serum samples ranging
from 1.10 mg/dL to 15.55 mg/dL and 50 urine samples ranging from 1.15
mg/dL to 25.76 mg/dL. Two serum samples were excluded for not being
within the measuring range of the assay. The studies were performed on the
ADVIA 1650 analyzer using the CA_2 assay (new device) and the CA assay
(predicate).
The regression correlation is summarized as follows:

b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study was performed using 25 paired serum and Li-
heparinized plasma samples containing calcium across the assay range.
Samples above the normal reference range were spiked. Testing was
performed using one ADVIA 1650 analyzer on one reagent lot over 2 days.
One sample was beyond the range of the assay and was excluded from the
calculations.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The serum/plasma reference range was determined by using 148 serum samples
from apparently healthy adult volunteers (77 females and 71 males). The samples
were assayed in duplicate on the ADVIA 1650 system using one reagent lot with
non-parametric analysis to calculate the values at the 2.5 and 97.5 percentile.
These results show that 95 percent of specimens fell within the calcium
concentrations of 8.7 – 10.4 mg/dL (2.18 – 2.60 mmol/L), with samples ranging
from 8.5 – 10.8 mg/dL (2.13 – 2.7 mmol/L). Since the equivalency between
serum and plasma samples with the CA_2 method was shown in a matrix
comparison study (section M.2.b), this reference range applies to both serum and
plasma samples.
For urine ranges, a literature reference was used (Tietz NW. Clinical Guide to
Laboratory Tests. Third Edition. Philadelphia, PA: WB Saunders Company;
1995:102-105). Expected results are as follows:
Matrix Range (mg) Range (mmol)
Serum/Plasma 8.7 – 10.4 (mg/dL) 2.18 – 2.60 (mmol/L)
Urine 100 – 300 (mg/day) 2.5 – 7.5 (mmol/day)
