L. Test Principle:
In this assay, patient sera, reference control, positive and normal controls are added to
the genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells which express
chimeric form of the human TSHR and a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)
induced luciferase reporter gene. The cells are seeded and grown for 15-18 hours to a
confluent monolayer in a 96-well plate prior to the addition of the samples. CHO cell
monolayer is incubated with patient serum for 3 hours to allow the binding of TSI
immunoglobulin to the chimeric human TSHR on the cell surface. This binding
induces a signaling cascade resulting in increased production of intra-cellular cAMP
which induces the production of luciferase. After incubation, the cells are lysed and
luciferase levels are measured with a luminometer. A significant increase in
luminescence over the Reference Control indicates the presence of TSI antibodies in
the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Intra-assay Precision:
Intra-assay precision was conducted by a single user over a 20 day period,
with each sample tested in triplicate. The resulting RLU values were
averaged per sample. Each plate of cells analyzed per day contained 16
samples (3 high responding samples, 3 medium responding samples, 3 low
responding samples, 3 normal samples, 2 reference controls, 1 positive control
and 1 blank replicate). The average variation for each sample was calculated
(CV%) across each plate. The result was summarized in the following table:

Site-to-Site Reproducibility:
Site-to-site reproducibility was assessed at 3 trained sites (with 2 technicians
at site 3) that performed 2 runs per day with each of four samples in triplicate
over an eight day period. Two days were excluded from site 2 due to a
technical failure. The total number of replicates for each sample is 180
(3x2x8x4 – 3x2x2x1). The data was summarized in the following table:

Each site’s data were analyzed to determine the Reproducibility and
Repeatability of the panel samples. Sample E had a positive ratio (Number
Positive/Total Number Tested) of 60/60, Samples F and G had negative ratios
(Number Negative/Total Number Tested) of 60/60. The overall coefficient of
variation (%CV) for the three samples was 15.0%, 20.3%, and 20.5%,
respectively.
b. Assay temperature:
The effect of temperature on cell lysis was determined to be critical during the
reproducibility study. The assay was tested at different temperature to
confirm the effect of the temperature on assay result. No statistical difference
was observed when the lysis occurred between 20 - 25ºC; however, a decrease
of approximately 20% in %SRR was observed if the lysis temperature was
dropped from 20ºC to 19ºC. The following notation was added to the assay
procedure in the package insert: “Note: It is critical to maintain the cell
lysis temperature above 20ºC. The test result will be affected if the lysis
temperature is dropped to 19ºC or less.”
c. Cell density:
Cell density was determined to be critical to the assay performance. The
impact of cell density was studied on duplicate plates that were seeded with
three concentrations of cells, which will reach to 90% confluent, 100%
confluent and over-100% confluent (more densely packed) respectively, after
18 hours of incubation. Each plate was treated with a positive, reference and
normal controls as well as with serum containing high, med and low levels of
TSI. No difference was found on %SRR among three plates containing
different cell confluent levels when high and med levels of TSI were tested;
however, a 19% decrease in %SRR was observed in wells planted with
densely packed cells when serum containing a low level of TSI was tested.

A following warning note was added into the package insert: “Individual
wells containing piled or layered cells should be disqualified from use
based on over-confluence.”
d. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
f. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Reference Control was the bovine Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (bTSH)
standardized against the rhTSH Standard (WHO Standard NIBSC 03/192,
Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone, Recombinant, Human, for Bioassay).
Positive control:
Positive control values between lots provided in the kit are different due to
differences in each manufactured antibody lot. An extra warning sentence
was therefore added to the package insert as following:
“It is good practice to examine the results of the Positive and Normal
Controls before examining the test results of the specimens. However
different lots might have a different positive control range. Please check
the positive control reference range label for the test range before the
test. If one or both of the controls fail to perform as expected, review the
steps and conditions under which the test was performed to determine the
cause(s). Do not report results until controls perform as expected.”
Specimen stability:
Four specimens containing two positive (near the cut-off) and two high
positive samples were stored at 2ºC - 8ºC (up to 72 hours), -20ºC (up to 3
months) and compared to samples stored at -80ºC. No apparent decrease of
the signal was observed.
Freeze and thaw:
Four specimens, one negative and three positives, were tested repeatedly for
up to 4 cycles. No statistical difference in the results was shown when a
sample was repeatedly frozen and thawed for a maximum of three cycles.
g. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by 20 blank measurements and the
average of the 19th and 20th ranked measurement was 62.75%. Twenty
measurements of a low positive were carried out and the standard deviation
was calculated at 16%.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) of 89.14%SRR was calculated based on the
formula provided in CLSI EP17-A. [LoD = LoB + c SD (62.75 +
β S
1.649*16)]. The LoD was verified in 25 measurements of a positive specimen
diluted to the claimed LoD (5 measurements of 5 positive specimens over 5-
days). 24 out of 25 (96%) measurements showed %SRR value higher than
6

--- Page 7 ---
LoB.
h. Analytical specificity:
Cross-Reactivity:
Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), and human
Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) share the same α-chain with TSH. The cross-
reactivity study was performed by testing different amounts of FSH, LH and
hCG in normal human serum and TSI containing sera from confirmed Graves’
Disease (GD) subjects with low positive and high positive %SRR. No cross-
reactivity was observed with FSH up to 2000 mIU/mL, LH up to 625mIU/mL,
and hCG up to 40,625 mIU/mL in the serum. No cross-reactivity was
observed in studies of spiked sera with TSH up to 0.35mIU/mL (the normal
physiological range in healthy adults is 0.0003 – 0.0030 mIU/mL).
Autoimmume Specimen Cross-Reactivity:
Serum from patients with auto-antibodies associated diseases [10 patients with
Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), 10 patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
(SLE), and 16 patients with Hashimoto's' thyroiditis (Hm)] were tested and
found to have no increased cAMP induced luciferase in the TSI Reporter
Assay except one Hm sample. This sample which had a SRR% of 150%, was
found to have a TSH level at or above -0.35 mIU/mL. A statement that any
specimens with TSH levels above this range need to be disqualified for use is
included in the Package Insert.
Interference:
Normal sera and TSI positive sera (one in high positive and one in low
positive) were tested in the presence of different amounts of hemoglobin,
bilirubin and lipemic samples. No interference was seen in samples spiked
with hemoglobin up to 250 mg/dL, bilirubin levels up to 36.6 mg/dL, or
lipemic levels up to 1168 mg/dL.
i. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-off was established using 74 samples from 30 patients with
diagnosed GD and 44 normal patients with no known or clinically diagnosed
thyroid disease. The %SRR is calculated by the ratio of RLU (Relative Light
Unit) from sample to RLU from reference control. The SRR% data obtained
for each of these subjects were analyzed using receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The cutoff was verified in pre-clinical
testing with an additional 50 GD positive sera from non-treated patients and
140 normal sera. The patient serum is considered positive for the presence of
TSI if the SRR% measured ≥140% over the Reference Control.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
An initial study was performed at two testing sites with a total of 312
specimens to be evaluated by both the subject and predicate devices. One
specimen was excluded due to insufficient quantity for testing. Twelve of
these specimens were excluded from statistical analysis due to indeterminate
results on the predicate device. The remaining 299 specimens were analyzed
for positive and negative percent agreement.

The predicate device detects autoantibodies to the TSHR, of which there are
two classes, stimulating (TSI-hyperthyroidism) and blocking (TBI-
hypothyroidism). The predicate device is unable to distinguish between the
two antibody types, whereas the TSI Reporter is specific for the TSI class.
The patient populations tested in site 1 and 2 are different from site 3. Site 3
is a reference laboratory that receives specimens from all medical disciplines.
The difference in patient populations tested at sites 1 and 2 vs. site 3 accounts
for the decreased positive percent agreement value that is caused by the
specificity difference between TSI Reporter and the predicate device at site 3.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable. Serum is the only matrix.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
Sera from 50 Graves disease patients and 199 normal subjects were tested for
assay sensitivity and specificity. The result is summarized in the following
table:

Clinical Specificity: 99.5% (198/199) 95%CI 97.2 – 99.9%
4. Clinical cut-off:
Same as Assay cut-off.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
A total of 140 normal samples with 72 female subjects and 68 male subjects were
tested to determine the reference range of SRR%. The average SRR% for the
female population is 34% (ranged from 9% to 116%) and the average SRR% for
the male population is 37% (ranged from 5% to 116%). There are no apparent
differences in the reference ranges for male and female populations. Expected
value in normal population is negative.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
