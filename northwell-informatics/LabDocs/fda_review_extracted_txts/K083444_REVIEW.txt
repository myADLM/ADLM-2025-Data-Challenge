Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP) and Cardiac C-Reactive Protein (cCRP) Assays
Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff; Replacement Reagent and Instrument Family Policy
CLSI EP17-A Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation
L. Test Principle:
Particle enhanced immunoturbidmetric assay. Human CRP agglutinates with latex particles
coated with monoclonal anti-CRP antibodies. The aggregates are determined
turbidmetrically.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run precision of the CRPL3 assay was determined using 2 control samples
and 3 human samples, run 21 times on the Hitachi 917 analyzer.
Day-to-day precision was determined by three determinations of two controls and
three human samples in 1 run/day for 21 days. For the day-to-day precision, the
second replicate of the 3-fold determination is used.
Within Run Between Run
Sample Mean (mg/L) SD CV % Mean (mg/L) SD CV %
Control Level I 3.6 0.03 0.85 3.1 0.08 2.7
Control Level 2 42.2 0.26 0.61 41.4 0.86 2.1
Human Serum 1 0.9 0.03 4.00 0.5 0.03 6.2
Human Serum 2 1.6 0.02 1.02 1.5 0.05 3.3
Human Serum 3 18.4 0.09 0.48 39.1 0.73 1.9
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To determine the linearity of the CRPL3 test system, three clinical samples were
diluted with 0.9% saline in order to cover the measuring range of the assay and were
tested on the Hitachi 917. The samples covered theoretical values from 0.13-5.03
mg/L, 0.42-20.591 mg/L, and 3.24-429.39 mg/L and the percent recovery was
determined for each region of the measuring range by comparing the measured value
of CRP to the theoretical value and shown below:
Region (mg/L) Percent Recovery (%)
≤ 5 97.3 - 100.56
5 - 350 98.5-101.7
> 350 88.7 – 105.45
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: This method is standardized against an internal method traceable to
CRM 470 (RPPHS- Reference Preparation for Proteins in Human Serum).
Stability (real-time studies): The unopened kit components are stable up to 12 months
stored at 2-8°C. Both reagents are stable opened and refrigerated on the analyzer for
84 days.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LOB) was evaluated on the Hitachi 917 analyzer using 5
replicates of one analyte free sample, run 6 times over ≥ 3 days on 2 instruments. LoB

was determined to be < 0.2 mg/L by calculating the mean value ± 3 SD.
The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of blank (LOB) were according to CLSI EP
17-A guidelines. The LOD was calculated using the standard deviation of 5 samples
with low analyte content measured once per run on two instruments and corresponds
to the sample concentration which leads with a probability of 95% to a measurement
result above the limit of blank. The LOD was calculated to be < 0.2 mg/L from 5
replicates of analyte-free sample on two instruments, with six runs distributed over 3
days.
The functional sensitivity (Limit of Quantitation) for the CRPL3 test system was
measured using five low concentration CRP samples in one run/day over 10 days on
two analyzers and determined to be 0.6 mg/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
The effect of endogenous interferences was examined by measuring analyte recovery
in the presence of hemoglobin, bilirubin, and lipids. No significant interference with
CRP measurement was determined with icterus (up to 60 mg/L), hemoglobin (up to
1000 mg/dL), lipids (up to L index of 1000), rheumatoid factor (up to 1200 IU/mL),
and no high dose hook effect seen with CRP concentrations up to 1200 mg/L.
