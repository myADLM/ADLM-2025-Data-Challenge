L. Test Principle:
Proteins contained in human body fluids react with specific antibodies in the reagent, to form
immune complexes in an immunochemical reaction. These complexes in the reaction mixture
cause the scatter of a beam of light passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered
light is proportional to the concentration of IgG in the sample. The result is evaluated by
comparison with a standard of known concentration. This is the same well established
nephelometric principle as the predicate.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity:
Linearity across the assay range was confirmed by testing a human urine sample with
high concentration (59.7 mg/L) of IgG. This sample was serially diluted with System
N Diluent down to the lower detectable measuring range (3.33 mg/L). Each dilution
was tested in replicates of five. Data were analyzed in accordance to CLSI EP06-A
and EP17-A. Percent recovery was calculated using the formula: (Mean of
test/expected concentration) x 100. All dilutions met the acceptance criteria of 85 to
115%. Test results that fall outside the measuring range are flagged. The linear
regression analysis was performed. Data showed a regression equation: y = 0.9824x +
0.0891, r =0.9994. Reportable range for IgG-U device is approximately 3.6 to 58.0
mg/L for urine samples.
Hook Effect:
The possibility of antigen excess occurring when using the device was evaluated with
sample (pool concentration) above the assay range. The samples were analyzed,
indicating no antigen excess effect observed up to at least 648.4mg/L.
b. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrator and controls are traceable to the reference material Calibrator ERM® -
DA470 (CRM 470).
Stability:
Data was provided to support shelf life, open vial, and on-board storage. When
stored at 2- 8 °C, the data supported a 24 month shelf life. Open vial stability for the
N Antiserum was 4 weeks and 14 days for the N/T Protein Controls LC and N Protein
Standard. On-board stability data supported 4 and 2 weeks for the 5 mL and 2 mL
vial of N Antiserum reagent, respectively, and 7 days for the N/T Protein Controls
LC.
c. Detection limit:
Data were analyzed according to EP17-A.Detection limit represents the lower limit of
the reportable range of urine IgG. The analytical sensitivity is defined as the minimal
detectable level of analyte, which can be distinguished from zero. The value was
calculated as the mean value of fifteen replicates of three human urine samples and
sample diluent. It was determined to be 3.6 mg/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed according to CLSI EP7-A2. No interference for
