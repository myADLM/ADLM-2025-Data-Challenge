L. Test Principle:
Proteins contained in human body fluids form immune complexes in an
immunochemical reaction with specific antibodies. These complexes scatter a beam
of light passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light at 840 nm is
proportional to the concentration of the respective protein in the sample. The result is
evaluated by comparison with a standard of known concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The performance characteristics for β -microglobulin in serum and plasma are
2
available in the Decision Summary for k063272. The evaluation of β -microglobulin
2
in urine is referred to as the B2MU method below.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility: Precision testing for the B2MU method was
conducted over twenty days according to CLSI/NCCLS EP5-A2, at a single
site. A single instrument, a single reagent lot and a single operator were used.
On each day of testing, each sample was run in duplicate in two separate runs.
The test samples consisted of two levels of Dimension Vista® Protein 1
Controls, and two pooled urine samples that covered the low and high ends of

the measuring range. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the
data consistent with the recommendations of EP5-A2. The % CVs for the
controls was less than 2.35% and the % CV for the urine pools was less than
6.7%. The data are shown below:

Urine pool 80 0.45 4.48 0.17 0.169 3.78 0.028 0.276 6.15
Lot-to-Lot precision was demonstrated using four samples covering the assay
range and testing on three reagent lots. Each sample was assayed in triplicate
from three different Flex® cartridges, producing nine replicates per sample for
each of the three reagent lots. The mean, standard deviation and % CV was
calculated for the data set of each sample from each lot. The % CV values
were then used to determine the mean % CV and standard deviation across
lots. For each sample, a one sided 95% confidence interval was used to
determine the upper limit. The acceptance limit for % CV for lot-to-lot
precision of < 5% was met.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The reportable range for the B2MU method was determined according to
CLSI EP-6-A. A high urine sample (5.95 mg/L) was diluted with System
diluent. A urine sample was run neat along with serial dilutions to cover the
assay range. A total of 13 levels were prepared and tested. The observed value
represents the mean of five replicates. Per the EP6-A procedure, the observed
(Y-axis) and expected (X-axis) values were fit by linear and cubic models.
Weighted regression fits were used for both models. The same weighting
factors were used for each model and were derived from the replicates data by
the classical approach of 1/Variance. These models were used to generate
predicted values for each sample. The difference between the linear and cubic
predicted values for each sample was taken as the bias at each level. The
acceptance criteria were defined as: Bias at each level ≤ ±0.05 mg/L or 15%,
and the mean bias for all levels ≤ ± 15%. The range of the bias was -4.98 to
+5.08 % (-0.13 to +0.05 mg/L), the mean absolute bias was 2.8 %. The
acceptance criteria were met. The BSMU analytical measuring range is 0.20 –
5.80 mg/L (0.02 – 0.58 mg/dL). The first order polynomial is used for the
best fitting straight line (linear fit). The regression analysis for the linear fit is
as follows: Slope = 0.965 Intercept = 0.029. The range of percent recovery at
each concentration (observed value/target value) is shown below:

assay was evaluated. Testing indicated no hook effect up to 24.4 mg/dL (244
mg/L).
d. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators):
The calibrator and control are traceable to WHO 1st International Preparation
for β -microglobulin.

Stability: Material was tested at day 0, and after 12, 18 and 24 months. Three
vials, 3 replicates per vial were tested. For open vial stability, vials were
stored on board the instrument and tested in duplicate at 0, 4, 7, 9, 11, 14 days.
The acceptance criteria for shelf life (± 15% of the assigned value) and open
vial (±10% of the day 0 value) were met.
Calibrator Expected Values: A typical assigned value for ß -microglobulin, in
2
Dimension Vista® Protein 1 Calibrator is 0.116 mg/dL (1.16 mg/L).
Calibration is required for any new lot of reagent or every 30 days for the
same lot.
Control Expected Values: A typical analyte concentration for ß -
2
microglobulin in Protein 1 Control L is 0.112 mg/dL (1.12 mg/L), and for ß -

runs of triplicate determinations on each of three human urine samples were
tested on one day with a single reagent and a calibrator lot and instrument.
The mean and SD for the 15 replicates for each sample were calculated. The
bias for each sample was determined (bias = mean - sample determination).
The average bias across the three samples for each concentration was
calculated. The pooled SD across the three samples was determined per EP17-
A Appendix B. The observed Total Analytical Error (TAE) was calculated.
(TAE = average bias plus 2SD) Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined
based on the TAE. An acceptance criterion of 30% was used based on
precision and recovery performance of the method. The Limit of Quantitation
for ß - microglobulin in urine was determined to be 0.019 mg/dL (0.19 mg/L).

f. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was conducted in accordance with CLSI EP7-A2
Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline - Second
Edition. Test samples were prepared by spiking the potential interferent into
urine. Ten replicates of each urine sample with interferent were tested.
Control samples for ß2-microglobulin in the urine samples tested ranged from
0.022 mg/dL - 0.495mg/dL (0.22 mg/L - 4.95 mg/L). The recovery of ß2-
microglobulin in the presence of spiked material ranged from 90 - 103 %. The
acceptance criterion for the bias (less than ±10%) was met in all cases.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Performance between the Dimension Vista® B2MIC Flex® reagent cartridge
and the predicate was compared. The study included 42 native specimens,
with β -microglobulin ranging from 0.022 - 0.55 mg/dL (0.22 - 5.52 mg/L),
2
and 40 spiked specimens. Spiked samples were prepared by adding purified
β -microglobulin to individual specimens. An additional 27 samples were run
2
for the extended high range. Passing-Bablock regression yielded the
following statistics:

Not applicable.
b. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The concentration of β2-microglobulin in urine of healthy individuals is below the
detection limit of detection for this method (less than 0.020 mg/dL [0.20 mg/L]).
This reference interval is based on Lammers M, Gentzler W., Reifferscheidt G,
Schmidt B. Determination of Beta 2 microglobulin by a particle enhanced
immunonephelometric assay. Clin Chem 2002; 48: A-119. The reference interval
was confirmed by running a transference study as outlined in CLSI C28-A2 How
to Define and Determine Reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory - Second
Edition. The acceptance criterion was defined that no more than 10% of the
values could lie outside the published range of < 0.02 mg/dL. The acceptance
criterion was met as all samples fell within the published range.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
