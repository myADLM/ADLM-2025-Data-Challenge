The Emit® 2000 Sirolimus Assay is for the in vitro quantitative analysis of
sirolimus in human whole blood as an aid in the management of sirolimus therapy
in kidney transplant patients.
The Emit® 2000 Siro/Tacro Sample Pretreatment Reagent is an accessory reagent
for use with the Emit 2000 Sirolimus Assay and/or the Emit 2000 Tacrolimus
Assay.
The Emit® 2000 Sirolimus Calibrators are intended for use in the calibration of
the Emit 2000 Sirolimus Assay.
2. Indication(s) for use:
See intended use above.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use.
See expected values section, below regarding interpretation of results.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Performance was evaluated on the Vital Scientific V-Twin Analyzer.
I. Device Description:
The Emit® 2000 Sirolimus Assay contains liquid reagents, including (mouse
monoclonal) antibody, buffer, a pretreatment and enzyme reagents.
The Emit® 2000 Sirolimus Calibrators are frozen material containing sirolimus in a
preserved human whole blood hemolysate. There are six calibrator levels with
nominal concentrations of 0, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 ng/mL sirolimus.
The calibrators contain human source material. Each donor unit used in the
preparation of this product was tested by FDA-approved methods for the presence of
antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and type 2 (HIV-2), as
well as for hepatitis B surface antigen and antibody to hepatitis C virus (HCV), and
found to be negative. Because no testing can offer complete assurance that these or
other infectious agents are absent, this material should be handled using good
laboratory practice to avoid skin contact and ingestion.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
2

--- Page 3 ---
Abbott IMx Sirolimus Microparticle Enzyme Immunoassay
.
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):
k042411
3. Comparison with predicate:
Both devices are immunoassays intended for use in the quantitative
measurement of sirolimus in human whole blood. Both devices require a
manual pretreatment. The predicate device uses microparticle enzyme
immunoassay technology; this device uses a homogeneous enzyme
immunoassay technology.
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Conformance to standards was not noted by the sponsor.
L. Test Principle:
The Emit® 2000 Sirolimus Assay employs a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay
technique used for analysis of sirolimus in whole blood. This assay contains mouse
monoclonal antibodies reactive to sirolimus. The assay is based on competition for
sirolimus antibody binding sites. Sirolimus in the sample competes with sirolimus in
the Enzyme Reagent that is labeled with recombinant enzyme glucose 6 phosphate
dehydrogenase (rG6PDH). Active (unbound) rG6PDH enzyme converts the oxidized
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in the Antibody Reagent to NADH,
resulting in a kinetic absorbance change that can be measured spectrophotometrically.
Enzyme activity decreases upon binding to the antibody, allowing Sirolimus
concentrations to be measured in terms of enzyme activity. Endogenous serum
G6PDH does not interfere with the assay because coenzyme NAD functions only
with bacterial (Leuconostoc mesenteroides) enzyme employed in this assay.
The pretreatment process lyses the cells, extracts the analyte and precipitates most of
the blood proteins. The pretreated samples are centrifuged, the supernatant containing
the analyte is assayed.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were conducted at the manufacturer’s site and at two external
sites using whole blood pools at concentrations which represent sub-therapeutic,
mid-therapeutic and upper levels. The pools were prepared from sirolimus spiked
3

--- Page 4 ---
into EDTA whole blood. A sample pool from patients treated with sirolimus was
also evaluated. The study was conducted with one reagent lot. Multiple
calibrations were performed during the study, as needed. Specimens at each level
were analyzed in duplicate twice per day for 20 days (n=80). A separate (pre-
analytical) extraction was performed for each sample. Results are summarized
below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity/recovery by dilution:
A linearity study was performed using a patient sample spiked with a sirolimus
stock solution (prepared from purified sirolimus) to a concentration of 30 ng/mL
determined gravimetrically (independently of the EMIT assay). Intermediate
concentrations were prepared by sequentially mixing the high sample with the
Emit® 2000 Sirolimus Calibrator (0 ng/mL) to produce concentrations equally

These studies support linearity and recovery/accuracy to 30 ng/mL. For lower
limits of the assay, see Detection Limit, below.
High sample dilution:
The method for diluting high samples recommended in the manufacturer’s
package insert was validated with patient samples, including samples
containing sirolimus concentrations near the upper end of the assay range.
Samples were diluted 1:1 with calibrator or negative whole blood. Observed
percents recovery (averaged across replicates of each individual sample) were
within +/-10%.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators are traceable to master pools formulated with sirolimus reference
material of high purity. The master pool levels are confirmed by
chromatographic methods from three reference labs. Estimated uncertainties

in calibrator measurements provided in the 510(k) were shown to be within
acceptable limits.
The shelf-life of the Emit® 2000 Sirolimus Calibrators is established using
real-time data collected from multiple lots. Recoveries, tested at 5 equal
intervals throughout the expiration dating period are determined using a
standard curve based on “control” calibrators stored at -70°C. Similar testing
was performed for opened calibrator vials. At testing time points, calibrators
were removed from storage at 2-8o C, sampled and returned to storage at that
temperature. Recovery of the test calibrators (measured in replicates) are monitored
over time. The sponsor indicated that real-time testing showed no significant
drift during testing ( < 0.02% change for shelf life studies) and that stability
was within the manufacturer’s criteria.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank, limit of detection, and limit of quantitation were
determined. The blank samples were sirolimus-free patient samples. The low-
analyte samples were prepared from individual sirolimus patient samples that
were diluted with sirolimus-free patient samples. The study utilized one
reagent lot, two instruments, multiple (28) calibration curves, five blank
samples and five low-analyte samples, and was conducted over 3 days. Blank
and low analyte samples were assayed in duplicate on each instrument.
Analyses showed LoB = 2.3 ng/mL; LoD=3.5 ng/mL.
To determine limit of quantitation, seven patient samples ranging from 1.6 –
6.7 ng/mL were measured on five consecutive days (over a period of 48 days),
1 run per day. Four replicate measurements were measured for each run. The
study was performed with one instrument and one reagent lot. Recovery
studies, as well as limit of detection and limit of quantitation, support the
sponsor’s claimed limit of quantitation of 3.5 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The effects of potential interferents on assay performance were evaluated.
Potential sources of interference tested were hematocrit, endogenous
compounds, other co-administered or OTC drugs.
a) A hematocrit range of 12.5% to 60% was evaluated. Sirolimus recovery
relative to the control calibrator ranged from 90-102%. No trends were
apparent.
b) Endogenous compounds:
Sirolimus was spiked into samples containing the interferents at
concentrations listed in the table below. Sirolimus concentrations were 5

ng/mL and 20 ng/mL. Samples were pretreated and measure in replicates,
n=5. Percents bias were all within +/-10%. Results are listed below.

c) Co-administered drugs and common OTC drugs
Samples were prepared to contain potential interferents and 6 or 20 ng/mL
sirolimus. All samples were pretreated and assayed n=5 times. The percent
interference of each drug was calculated relative to control samples containing
only sirolimus. The immunosuppressive drugs that were tested included:
cyclosporine, mycophenolic acid and its metabolite MPAG, and tacrolimus. A list
of available drugs (with concentrations) tested is included in the package insert.
At the concentrations tested, the drugs did not cause significant interference with
the assay. Recoveries were within +/-10% of the control sample.
d) Cross-reactivity
Major sirolimus metabolites were evaluated for cross-reactivity, at a concentration
of 25 ng/mL, in the presence of 0 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL sirolimus. The samples
were pretreated, and assayed (n=5 replicates). Results, listed in the table below,
were compared against a control sample. Cross reactivity was calculated as:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Measurements of patient samples with the Emit® 2000 Sirolimus Assay were
compared to LC/MS/MS. (Information on the comparator method was included in
the 510(k)). The studies were conducted externally at two sites. Samples (n=123)
were whole blood EDTA collected from kidney transplant patients treated with
sirolimus. The mean time since transplant was 6.9 years, and all but six samples
were from patients > 6 months post-transplant. Samples evaluated were trough
(C0) samples. The majority of the samples were from one draw per patient. In
cases where patient samples were from two draws per patient, these were
separated in time (2 weeks to 4 months). Analysis of the data showed there was
no significant effect of repeat measurements (from a single patient) on the
regression statistics.
Samples were pretreated with the Emit® 2000 Siro/Tacro Sample Pretreatment
Reagent and run in random order on the V-Twin Analyzer. Calibrations occurred
as needed during the course of testing at each site (4 calibrations at site 1, two
calibrations at site 2). The data was analyzed by least squares linear regression.
The first replicate of the Emit Assay result and LC/MS/MS result was used in the
data analysis. The values obtained on the V-Twin Analyzer spanned the assay
range from 4.1 – 29.5 ng/mL. Results from each site separately were included in
the 510(k), and are pooled below.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable; Clinical sensitivity and specificity is not typically provided in
510(k)s for this type of assay.

Data regarding patient demographics and selection criteria were provided in
the method comparison evaluation in the 510(k).
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable; this is a quantitative assay.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The following is stated in the package insert:
The optimal concentration range for sirolimus in whole blood using this assay has
not been established. Optimal concentration ranges vary according to the specific
assay used, and therefore should be established for each specific assay. Values
obtained with different assay methods should not be used interchangeably due to
differences in cross-reactivity with metabolites, nor should correction factors be
applied. Laboratories should include identification of the assay used in order to
aid in interpretation of results. Each institution should establish the optimal ranges
based on the specific assay used and other factors relevant to their patient
population. Optimal ranges depend upon the patient’s clinical state, individual
differences in sensitivity to immunosuppressive and nephrotoxic effects of
sirolimus, co-administration of other immunosuppressants, time post transplant
and a number of other factors. Therefore, individual sirolimus values cannot be
used as the sole indicator for making changes in treatment regimen and each
patient should be thoroughly evaluated clinically before changes in treatment
regimens are made.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
