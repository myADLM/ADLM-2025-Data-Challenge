L. Test Principle:
The ACL AcuStar D-Dimer Chemiluminescent Immunoassay is a 2-step assay. In the first
step, assay buffer, magnetic particles coated with a monoclonal antibody specific to D-Dimer
is mixed with a sample. Following an incubation, during which any D-Dimer in the sample
is captured by the antibody coated particles. In part two, after a washing step which removes
any unbound materials, a tracer, consisting of a monoclonal antibody specific to D-Dimer
conjugated with isoluminol is added to the sample cuvette. During a short incubation, the
tracer binds to any D-Dimer captured by the antibody coated particle. After a washing step
to remove any unbound tracer, the sample cuvette is sent to the luminometer, and the
chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLU’s). The RLU's are
directly proportional to the D-Dimer concentration in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Dilutions of a high concentration D-Dimer plasma sample (~95000ng/mL) were
prepared in AcuStar D-Dimer Assay Sample Diluent. Each level was tested in
quadruplicate using two different lots of AcuStar D-dimer reagents. Results
demonstrated linearity of 54.3 – 74000 ng/mL with Auto Rerun Off. When the Auto
Rerun is activated, the ACL AcuStar makes an on-board dilution and automatically
corrects the final result for the dilution factor, which expands the test range to 54.3 –
1110000 ng/mL. No inhibitory prozone was detected on the highest concentrations
tested.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The submission contained Cartridge on-board stability, Calibrator and Control on-
board stability, and partial on-board Control stability (to simulate normal usage) data
that supported the cartridge, control and calibrator stability claims.

d. Detection limit:

ACL AcuStar using 2 different lots of AcuStar D-Dimer reagents. Detection Limit is
calculated as:
[S ] x _____3 x SD _____
1 0
RLU – RLU
1 0
The submission contained data to support the detection limit claim of 6.51 ng/mL
e. Analytical specificity:
The highest concentration of hemoglobin (500 mg/dL), bilirubin (18 mg/dL),
triglycerides (1250 mg/dL), heparin (Low molecular Weight and Unfractionated) (2
IU/mL, rheumatoid factor (450 IU/mL), and human anti-mouse antibody (1 µg/mL)
were each spiked into two samples (low and high D-Dimer concentrations) and the
results compared to the unspiked sample results. To demonstrate the lack of
interference of fibrinogen to the AcuStar D-Dimer assay, a positive D-Dimer sample
was diluted to multiple levels with sample diluent and D-Dimer depleted plasma, and
the results compared. Data demonstrated no significant interference by;
Hemoglobin up to 500 mg/dL
Bilirubin up to 18 mg/dL
Triglycerides up to 1250 mg/dL
Heparin up to 2 IU/mL
Rheumatoid factor up to 450 IU/mL)
Human anti-mouse antibody up to 1 µg/mL
f. Assay cut-off:
Assay cut –off was validated through ROC analysis using 150 frozen samples from
non-consecutive outpatients suspected of VTE. The samples were selected to include
`30% positive VTE samples and were tested with the HemosIL AcuStar D-Dimer
Assay on the ACL AcuStar. A 100% Sensitivity, 35.2% Specificity, and 100%
Negative Predicative Value was obtained based on a 500 ng/mL cut-off.

In-House Study
150 frozen samples from non-consecutive outpatients suspected of VTE and 30
samples diagnosed with Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) were tested in
singlicate with HemosIL AcuStar D-Dimer on the ACL AcuStar versus the VIDAS
D-Dimer Exclusion Assay. (y = 1.16 x -247, r=0.90)
Field Study #1
102 patient samples, 14 of which from patients diagnosed with VTE, were tested in
singlicate with HemosIL AcuStar D-Dimer on the ACL AcuStar versus the HemosIL
D-Dimer HS on an ACL TOP. Sample results ranged from 6 – 12629 ng/mL y=2.54
+383.39, r=0.89.
Field Study #2
100 patient samples, 24 of which obtained from patients diagnosed with VTE, were
tested in single CATE with HemosIL AcuStar D-Dimer on the ACL AcuStar versus
the BioMerieux VIDAS D-Dimer Exclusion Assay. Sample results ranged from 77 –
63131 ng/mL. y = 1.09 -51.74, r= 0.98
b. Matrix comparison:
50 fresh plasma samples were obtained from an emergency room and immediately
analyzed in duplicate with the HemosIL AcuStar D-dimer reagents on an ACL
AcuStar instrument and then split into two aliquots. One aliquot was stored at 2-8° C,
and the other at -70° C. After one week, each aliquot was tested in duplicate, and
compared to the fresh sample results. Results demonstrated good correlation ;
Fresh vs 2-8 ° C : y = 1.04 x -323, r=0.99
Fresh vs -70° C : y = 1.03x -290, r=0.99
3. Clinical studies:
344 frozen citrated plasma samples were collected from patients admitted to an
emergency unit with suspected VTE. 97 were confirmed as VTE positive by standard
objective tests and the remaining 247 were confirmed as negative
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Based on the cut-off of 500 ng/mL, 100% (95% CI 96.3 to 100.0%) sensitivity and
100% (95% CI 97.3 to 100.0%) negative predictive value was obtained.
b. Clinical specificity:
7

--- Page 8 ---
Based on the cut-off of 500 ng/mL, the study yielded a specificity of 55.5% (95% CI 49.0
to 61.8%)
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
4. Clinical cut-off:
5. Expected values/Reference range:
189 citrated plasma samples obtained from healthy blood bank donors were tested in
singlicate on an ACL AcuStar using one lot of HemosIL AcuStar D-Dimer reagents. 9
samples were deemed far outliers and removed from the analysis. The D-Dimer
concentration distribution was not normal; therefore, non parametric statistics were
applied, resulting in the following:
Non-Parametric Limits 95% Limit 90% CI
Lower 65.5 53.1 -73.1
Upper 630 564 - 802
The device’s package insert recommends that each laboratory establish its own normal
range.

Barcode reader. for both the specimen and rack. If there is no sample in a rack position,
the barcode reader reads the barcode on the back of the rack position that indicates an
empty location.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimens are sampled from an open tube and automatically diluted
5. Calibration:
The assay kit contains lot dependent, bi-level lyophilized calibrators. The assay uses a 4
Parameter Logistic Curve (4PLC) fit data reduction method to generate a Master Curve
which is stored in the instrument through the cartridge barcode. With the measurement
of calibrators, the predefined Master Curve is transformed to a new, instrument specific
4PLC Working Curve.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
