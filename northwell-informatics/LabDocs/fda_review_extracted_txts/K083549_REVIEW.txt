I. Device Description:
The AbT Glucose Control Solution consists of a viscosity-adjusted, aqueous liquid
control solution containing a known quantity of d-glucose. The product is packaged
in plastic dropper tipped bottles for easy application of the control solutions to the test
strips and a red coloration to aid the user to visually confirm application of the
control. The product is nonhazardous and contains no human or animal derived
materials.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The control is traceable to an 88 mg/dL standard of NIST Standard Reference
Material 917b as analyzed using a commercially available chemistry analyzer.
The 88 mg/dL standard was manufactured in accordance with the NIST
“Instructions for Use as a Standard in Clinical Applications” which
accompanies the certificate of analysis for SRM917b.
Stability:
Stability testing protocols were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The
product has a closed-vial stability developed through real-time testing of 24
months at 2 – 30 oC. Open-vial stability is 90 days after opening at 2 – 30 oC,
but should not exceed the printed expiration date.

Value Assignment:
The control lot is tested using a commercially available clinical chemistry
analyzer with an expected value of 88 mg/dL. Value assignment protocols for
the FreeStyle and FreeStyle Lite blood glucose monitors involve repeat testing
to obtain the mean value. The assigned range is based upon a percentage of
the obtained mean. The expected results may vary slightly with each lot. The
expected range is listed in the product insert for both the FreeStyle and
FreeStyle Lite blood glucose monitors. In addition, the product insert for this
device alerts the user to use the range indicated in this control’s product insert
rather than the range provided in the glucose test strip product’s insert that
applies to another commercially available control material.
