SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification
ODE Review Memorandum (Decision Making Document is Attached)
To: THE FILE RE: DOCUMENT NUMBER K083572_
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the
SUBMITTER’S own Class II, Class III or Class I devices requiring 510(k). The following
items are present and acceptable (delete/add items as necessary):
1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device.
BD BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F Blood culture Medium K921133
2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as
described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which
includes instructions for use, package labeling, and, if available, advertisements or
promotional materials (labeling changes are permitted as long as they do not affect the
intended use).
The Indications/Intended Use of the modified device has been reviewed and has not
changed.
3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S), including clearly labeled diagrams,
engineering drawings, photographs, user’s and/or service manuals in sufficient detail to
demonstrate that the FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified
device has not changed.
The fundamental scientific technology of the modified device has not changed. The
modifications were
• The BD BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F Blood Culture medium volume from 25mL of
broth to 30mL.
• The modified BD BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F Blood Culture medium contains the
addition of antioxidants and vitamins to stabilize the nutrients in the media during
the manufacturing process.
• The modified BD BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F Blood Culture medium contains an
increase in the glucose (dextrose) and a reduction in the concentration of
sucrose. The sugar content in the Blood culture medium (TSB) has not changed.

predicate device including, labeling, intended use, physical characteristics, and
Similarities
Current Modified
Intended Use BD BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F Same
Blood Culture medium is used in a
qualitative procedure for the
aerobic culture and recovery of
microorganisms (bacteria and
yeast) from blood. The principle
use of this medium is with BD
BACTEC Fluorescent Series
Instruments.
Sample type Blood Same
System BD BACTEC Fluorescent Series Same
Instruments.
Differences
Medium volume 25 mL (Blood to broth ratio 1 : 2.5) 30 mL (Blood to broth ratio 1 : 3)
Addition of None Antioxidants and vitamins
ingredients
Concentration of Lower glucose, higher sucrose Increase in glucose, reduction of
glucose/sucrose sucrose
5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification
on the device and its components, and the results of the analysis were provided.
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation
activities required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be
applied were submitted.
c) A declaration of conformity with design controls. The declaration of conformity
included:
i) A statement signed by the individual responsible, that, as required by the risk
analysis, all verification and validation activities were performed by the designated
individual(s) and the results demonstrated that the predetermined acceptance
criteria were met, and
ii) A statement signed by the individual responsible, that the manufacturing facility is
in conformance with design control procedure requirements as specified in 21
CFR 820.30 and the records are available for review.
The design control activities were performed and were acceptable.

Medium Modification validation protocols included equivalence testing of new formulation
(test) and current formulation (control) by the Fluorescent Series Instruments. The
organism list included reference strains of commonly isolated pathogens comprising of
Gram negative, Gram positive organisms and yeasts (i.e. C. albicans, C. glabrata and C.
neoformans). The protocols were:
a) Without blood or supplement
b) Validation testing to examine the extremes of blood volume range (0, 1, and
15 mL) expected in the clinical use
c) Detection of very low densities of viable organisms
d) Testing on delayed vial entry

The yeast group (i.e. C. albicans, C. glabrata and C. neoformans) was analyzed
separately and the data is acceptable.
A system validation (algorithm regression test) was performed by inoculating bottles with
reference organisms and blood volumes. The modified algorithm is only active on the
Aerobic Plus medium and the data indicated that the software algorithms have been
implemented and the software can be used in validation. Results also indicated “PASS”
in the regression test.
6. A Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary and the Indications for Use Enclosure
were provided.
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the
indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s
description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified
and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed.
The submitter has provided the design control information as specified in The New 510(k)
Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the
previously cleared (or their preamendment) device.
