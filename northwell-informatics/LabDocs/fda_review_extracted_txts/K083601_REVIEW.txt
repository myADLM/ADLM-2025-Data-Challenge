L. Test Principle:
When a sample is added to the cuvette, the antiserum against human Immunoglobulin
Lambda light chains will form a complex with its corresponding antigen in the
sample under optimal pH conditions and in the presence of PEG. These complexes
scatter a beam of light passing through the sample. The intensity of the light that
passed through the complex can be captured and measured by the instrument. The
intensity of the light passed through the complex is proportional to the concentration
of the respective antigen (free and bound Lambda light chains) in the sample. A
series of calibrators of known antigen concentration are assayed to generate a
calibration curve which is used to determine the unknown concentration of the
sample. The memory can be stored in the machine and used for the calculation of the
unknown samples in the future runs.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within run precision:
Within run precision was determined by running four serum controls at
different detection levels and one human sera pool once a day for 20 days.
Level 1 represented the low to mid detection range (25% -30%), Level 2
represented the low detection range (<20%), Level 4 represented the mid level
of detection range (~50%), and level 3 represented the high detection range
(>80%). The %CV from all 5 serum controls tested was less than 5%.

Level 4 20 209.0 3.42 1.6
Human sera pool 20 301.1 6.13 2.0
Total Precision (Run- to-Run and day-to-day):
Total precision was determined by running two levels of serum control
materials twice a day for 20 days with each sample ran in duplicate (20 X 2 X
2). Level 1 represented the low detection range, level 2 represented the mid
detection range. Three additional human sera pools that span the region of
150 mg/dL to 450 mg/dL were added later. The result was summarized in the

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity:
Linearity was assessed using two different pools of human sera to cover all
measuring range. Pool 1 was used to determine the linearity of the assay over
“Whole Analytical Measurement Range (Whole AMR),” and Pool 2 was used
to determine the linearity of the assay over “Low Analytical Measurement
Range (AMR).” Pool 1 was created by spiking concentrated Lambda light
chains into a human pool serum, followed by serially diluting the spiked
sample with saline to obtain 10 samples with concentrations of Lambda light
chains from 423 mg/dL − 0 mg/dL. Pool 2 was created by serially diluting a
human pooled serum sample to create 10 samples with concentrations ranging
from 54 mg/dL − 0 mg/dL. Each sample was run in triplet in both AMR test
and Whole AMR tests. The measured value from each sample was plotted
against the theoretical value. The data is summarized in the following table:
Test Range Slope Y-intercept Relative Bias
Range R2 % CV range
(mg/dL) (95% CI) (95% CI) range
Low AMR 1.8 − 54.3 1.05 -3.82 0.9916 -67.5% to 0% 0.3% to 2.4%

AMR (0.98 to 1.04) (-12.57 to 1.08)
ORDAC range (Over Range Detection and Correction):
For a sample that is out of the linear range but between 400 to 800 mg/dL, the
machine will follow the automated protocol ORDAC to achieve an acceptable
degree of accuracy. To verify the accuracy of the ORDAC protocol that is
performed automatically by the machine, a set of 25 samples, equally
distributed within the range of 300 to 800 mg/dL were run in duplicate on
Synchron Lx20 according to the ORDAC parameters setting. The results
were compared with manually pre-diluted saline. Data was evaluated by
plotting the result from automatically run with ORDAC protocol against the
result from manually pre-diluted protocol. The data was summarized in the
following table:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrator: SENTINEL Plasmaproteins Cal 3X, previously cleared in k081533
is traceable to ERM-DA 470 (European Reference Material) from BCR (EG
Community Bureau of Reference), corresponding to RPPHS(Reference
Preparation for Protein in Human Serum).
On-board Stability test:
Three levels of serum controls containing Lambda light chains (62.93 mg/dL,
145.93 mg/dL, and 226.10 mg/dL) were tested on Synchron LX 20 System
with opened on-board reagents up to 29 days. Percent recovery for each
control level was tested within 90% − 110% thought out the 29 days period.
Unopened Reagent Stability test:
Three different lots of unopened Reagent 1 and three different lots of
unopened Reagent 2 were tested at different time frame up to 25 months. The
calibrator is used as sample to be tested for the same time frame as the
reagent. Percent recovery ranged from 85% − 115% for Reagent 1 and 2,
95% − 105% for calibrator. The shelf life for both reagents were claimed to
be stable up to 24 months when stored at 2ºC − 4ºC.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by 20 blank measurements of
saline in three different runs (total 20 X 3). The LoB was calculated to be
0.55 mg/dL based on formula of Mean + 1.65 x SD.
Limit of Detection:
To determine the Limit of Detection (LoD), a human sera pool was diluted
with saline to obtain a concentration higher than the LoB (0.55 mg/dL). The
diluted pool was measured in three different runs with 20 replicates each on
Synchron LX20 System. If the result of Mean – 3 SD from all three runs is
below the measuring range yet greater than LoB, then the concentration of the
diluted pool is considered to be the LoD.

The LoD of this assay is 5.71 mg/dL.
Limit of Quantification:
A pool of human sera with a concentration around 20 mg/dL was serially
diluted with saline to obtain a set of samples with decreased concentrations of
human Lambda light chains. Each sample was tested on Synchron LX20
system with 10 replicates. The LoQ is defined by %CV being ≤ 10% and the
% relative bias, which is defined as the absolute bias (theoretical value –
observed value) divided by theoretical value, being ≤ 20%. The Limit of
Quantification is 20 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference on Endogenous compounds in serum:
For the interference study on bilirubin, hemoglobin and triglycerides, human
serum samples were spiked with various concentrations of interferents. A
minimum of three replicates of each interference level were run. Absolute
bias at each concentration level was determined against concentration of non-
spiked pool. For the determination of potential interference by Rheumatoid
Factor (RF), a human serum with a RF concentration of about 1012 U/mL was
diluted with a human serum without RF. Absolute bias for RF interference
was determined against theoretical values which were calculated based on the
dilution ratio.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To determine the degree of correlation between the Lambda light chains assay
on the Synchron LX20 System vs. the IMMAGE Immunochemistry System
Lambda light chain (k964260) on IMMAGE nephelometer Analyzer, 79
serum samples ranged from 21.2 mg/dL – 1120 mg/dL [corresponding to 78.9
mg/dL – 3643.1 mg/dL based on Whole IgG (MW 150,000)] were tested in
duplicate with both devices. The result from the current device (calibration
based on Lambda light chains as Whole IgG content), was plotted against the
result from the predicate Nephelometer.
