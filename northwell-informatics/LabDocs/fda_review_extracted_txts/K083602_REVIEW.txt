L. Test Principle:
When a sample is added to the cuvette, the antiserum against human
Immunoglobulin Kappa light chains will form a complex with its corresponding
antigen in the sample under optimal pH conditions and in the presence of PEG.
These complexes scatter a beam of light passing through the sample. The intensity
of the light that passed through the complex can be captured and measured by the
instrument. The intensity of the light passed through the complex is proportional
to the concentration of the respective antigen (free and bound Kappa light chains)
in the sample. A series of calibrators of known antigen concentration are assayed
to generate a calibration curve which is used to determine the unknown
concentration of the sample. The memory can be stored in the machine and used
for the calculation of the unknown samples in the future runs.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was assessed using two different pools of human sera: Pool 1 was
used to determine the linearity of the assay over the “Whole Analytical
Measurement Range (Whole AMR)” and Pool 2 was used to determine the
linearity over the “Low Analytical Measurement Range (Low AMR)”. Pool 1
was created by spiking concentrated Kappa light chains into a human pool
serum, followed by serially diluting the spiked sample with saline to obtain at
least 10 samples with concentrations of Kappa light chains of 0 mg/dL - 750
mg/dL. Pool 2 was created by serially diluting a human pooled serum sample
to create at least 10 samples with concentrations ranging from 0 mg/dL - 77
mg/dL. Each diluted sample was run in triplicate in both Whole AMR and
Low AMR tests. Data were analyzed in accordance with CLSI EP6-A. The
measured value from each sample was plotted against the theoretical value.
The data is summarized in the following table:

ORDAC (Over Range Detection and Correction):
For samples that are out of the linear range but between 600 to 1250 mg/dL,
the instrument will automatically dilute the sample following the automated
protocol ORDAC. Study was done to verify that serum samples diluted by the
automated protocol ORDAC, achieve an acceptable degree of accuracy as
determined by comparison with manually diluted samples. The ORDAC
function was verified by using a panel of 25 samples, equally distributed
within the range of 591 to 1825 mg/dL. Samples were run in duplicate on
Synchron LX20 according to the ORDAC parameters setting. The results
were compared with paired aliquots of each sample that was manually pre-
diluted. Data generated met the Preapproved Acceptance Criteria of slope 0.95
to 1.05; R≥0.975 and demonstrated the accuracy of the assay within the range
of 600 mg/dL to 1250 mg/dL. The following table summarizes the results:

to 1250 mg/dL.
Prozone effect – samples from 1250 up to 10000 mg/dL will be reported as
>750 mg/dL.

266.6 mg/dL, and 435.6 mg/dL) were tested on Synchron LX 20 System with
opened on-board reagents over 29 days. Percent recovery for each control

The study for on-board stability described above was used to determine
calibration stability of the Kappa light chains assay reagents on the Synchron
LX20 System. For the study, a calibration with fresh reagents was performed
at Day 0 and was used throughout. The acceptance criteria of percent recovery
against measurement at Day 0 (90% to 110%) were met through the Study
from Day 0 to Day 29. The claimed on Board Calibration Stability will be 14
days.
Unopened Reagent Stability Test:
A Real Time Study was carried out on three different lots of Kappa light
chains assay for up to 38 months. Reagents were stored at +2 to +8°C
throughout the duration of the study. Accuracy was tested on two levels of
serum control material. During the analysis, a fresh material was used to
calibrate the tests. Three replicates were tested for each level. Percent
recovery ranged from 98.4% − 104.0% for calibrator and 98.2% − 110.6% for
controls. The shelf life of the Kappa Light chains assay was claimed to be
stable up to 24 months when stored at 2°C - 8°C.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical sensitivity studies were conducted following the preapproved
internal protocol and acceptance criteria according to CLSI document EP 17-
A.
Limit of Blank:
The limit of Blank (LOB) was determined by 20 blank measurements of saline
in three different runs (total 20 X 3). The LOB is based on formula of
(Mean+1.645SD) and was calculated to be 0.25 mg/dL.
Limit of Detection:
To determine the Limit of Detection (LOD), a human serum pool was diluted
with saline to obtain a concentration higher than the LOB (0.25 mg/d/L). The
diluted pool was measured on three different runs with 20 replicates each, on
Synchron LX20 System. LOD was defined as the concentration at which
(Mean–3SD) is below the measuring range yet greater than LOB.

N= 60 8.59 0.804 6.18
The LOD of this assay is 6.18 mg/dL
Limit of Quantitation (LOQ):
A pool of human sera with a concentration around 40 mg/dL was serially
diluted with saline to obtain a set of samples with decreased concentrations of
human Kappa light chains. Each sample was tested on Synchron LX20

System with 10 replicates. LOQ is defined by the %CV being ≤ 10% and the
percent bias must be ≤ 20%.
% Bias was defined as: (Theoretical value – Found value)/
(Theoretical value)*100.
The LOQ of this assay is 30 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous compounds in serum:
Interference study was done to evaluate interference caused by bilirubin
(conjugated and unconjugated), hemoglobin, lipids (triglycerides), and
Rheumatoid Factor (RF) in the Kappa light chains assay on the Synchron
LX20 System. Human serum samples were spiked with various concentrations
of the interferents. A minimum of three replicates of each interferent level
were run. Absolute bias at each concentration level was determined against
concentration of unspiked pool. For the determination of potential interference
by RF, a human serum with a concentration of RF of about 1012 U/mL was
diluted with a human serum without RF. Absolute bias at each concentration
level was determined against theoretical values. The table below shows that
the data generated met the acceptance criteria:

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
See expected values
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Normal reference range was established by testing 100 female and 102 male
voluntary healthy donors, 20 – 69 years old. Reference range was calculated at
95% of the samples distribution. The Kappa light chains were found to range from
122 mg/dL – 437 mg/dL among the tested healthy donors.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
