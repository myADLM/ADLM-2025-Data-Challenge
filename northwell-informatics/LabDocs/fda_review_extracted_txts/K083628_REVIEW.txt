L. Test Principle:
The GlucoDr auto Blood Glucose Monitoring System is based on measurement of electrical
currents caused by the reaction of glucose with reagents on the gold electrode strip. Glucose
in the blood sample reacts with FAD glucose dehydrogenase and potassium ferricyanide in
the test strip, which creates electrical currents. The subsequent electrical currents are
proportional to the glucose concentration in the blood and converted to the equivalent
glucose concentration by the algorithm programmed in the test meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed precision studies using venous whole blood with
concentrations between 58 and 324 mg/dL (spiked samples). Testing was performed
at 3 sites with 10 meters (3 meters used at site 1 and 2 and 4 meters at site 3) and
three lots of test strips were tested with 10 replicates of each lot in one day. The
results for all three lots are presented in the table below:
Level Mean of glucose Within-run (SD) %CV
(mg/dL)
1 58 1.88 3.22
2 103 1.95 1.89
3 150 2.73 1.82
4 190 3.72 1.96
5 324 5.95 1.84
In addition, repeatability of the test strip was tested with control solutions (low,
medium and high). Testing was performed at 3 sites with 10 meters (3 meters used at
site 1 and 2 and 4 meters at site 3) and three lots of test strips were tested with 10
replicates in one day. The results for all three lots are presented in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the glucose measurements was demonstrated by comparing prepared
blood samples on the GlucoDr auto blood glucose monitoring system and a glucose
reference method. The seventeen samples ranged in concentration from a low of
approximately 10 mg/dL to a high of approximately 600 mg/dL. Three GlucoDr
meters and three lots of blood glucose test strips were tested in replicates of three.
Linear regression of the comparison data yielded the following relationship:
Lot 1 - y = 0.9973x – 1.6265, R2 = 0.9996
Lot 2 - y = 1.0018x + 0.0570, R2 = 0.9986
Lot 3 - y = 1.0004x + 0.9824, R2 = 0.9987
The reportable range for glucose measurements is 20-600 mg/dL
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Values for the control materials are assigned by repeat testing over time and
analyzing the variation of the results. Expected values for each lot of control solutions
are printed on the strip vial. The test strip and control solution stability was assessed
by performing real-time and accelerated studies for the shelf life and in use stability.
Stability protocols and acceptance criteria were evaluated and found to be acceptable.
The claimed shelf life is 18 months and the claimed in-use stability is 90 days for
control solution and 4 months in-use shelf life for the test strips when stored at room
temperature.
d. Detection limit:
See linearity/reportable range studies above.

e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous and exogenous substances were tested for interference on this assay at
three glucose concentration (58, 163 and 261 mg/dL). Three test strip lots and 4

glucose measurement from the control greater than 10 mg/dL for glucose
concentration <75 mg/dL and greater than 10% for glucose concentration >75 mg/dL.
The following substances were tested.

hematocrit levels from 20 - 60%. Each glucose level/hematocrit combination was tested
on 5 meters using 3 lots of test strips, by comparing the results of samples at each of the
varying hematocrit levels to the sample of the same glucose concentration at a normal
(40%) hematocrit level. Each glucose level/hematocrit combination was also compared to
the corresponding YSI value. The data supports the sponsor’s claimed hematocrit range
of 20-60%.
Altitude study:
An altitude study was performed with four whole blood samples spiked to the following
concentration 80-120, 180-200, 280-320 and 380-420 mg/dL. The samples were tested at
ground level up to 8,200 feet. All samples met the sponsor’s acceptability criterion of the
difference between the minimum and maximum result at each concentration range is <
10%. The data submitted supports use of the device up to 8,200 feet.
Temperature and Humidity study:
Temperature and humidity studies were performed and showed that the meter can be
used at temperatures from 10 to 40°C and humidity from 35 to 55%; and exposed to
temperatures from -10 to 51°C and a relative humidity from 11 to 91%

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The consumer study was performed at three POC sites with a total of 130 lay-users.
The lay-users ranged in age, education and were about equally divided between males
and females. Each participant performed their own fingerstick and tested their blood
using the instructions in the User’s manual and package insert. A trained healthcare
professional then performed another fingerstick and tested the blood on the same
meter. Samples ranged from 31 to 552 mg/dL with samples below 63 mg/dL and
above 423 mg/dL adjusted to acquire these extreme ranges. Blood was collected and
measured on a YSI analyzer.

Alternate site testing:
The consumer study was performed at one POC site with a total of 51 lay-users. The
lay-users ranged in age, education and were equally divided between males and
females. Each participant performed a self-test on their finger, palm, arm and thigh
testing their blood using the instructions in the User’s guide. A trained professional
then performed testing on the finger, palm, forearm, upper arm, thigh, and calf testing
the blood on the same meter.

This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip, palm,
forearm or thigh and venous and arterial whole blood. For capillary whole blood, since
the sample is applied directly to the test strip, there are no special handling or storage
issues. For venous whole blood, samples must be tested within 15 minutes of draw and
the sample cannot be stored.
5. Calibration:
Each vial of test strips has a code number which is used to calibrate the meter. The code
number must be verified by turning on the meter using the power button. The code
number cannot be changed with a test strip inserted into the port. The user confirms that
the code number on the test strip bottle matches the code number in the instrument. No
further calibrations are required of the user.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor sells two levels of control solution with this device. To mark the test result
as a control, after the test result is displayed the user is instructed to press the +/- buttons
to select the attention event icon. After the attention event icon appears on the display
press the power button to save. This distinguishes control results from actual blood
glucose tests in the memory. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the
test strip vial label. If control results fall outside these ranges, the user is referred to a list
of troubleshooting steps and the customer care line.
