K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
This 510(k) Premarket Notification was prepared and referenced the following guidance
documents and recognized standards:
Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff - Assayed and Unassayed Quality Control Material
(DRAFT final: June 7, 2007)
No Standard document was referenced.
L. Test Principle:
Not applicable.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Values for Toxo IgG CalCheck are calibrated against the WHO anti-Toxoplasma
serum (TOXM), 3rd International Standard for T. gondii from the National Institute
for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC), UK. Values are assigned using a
minimum of 3 Elecsys 2010/ cobas e 411 analyzers, 3 MODULAR ANALYTICS
E170/ cobas e601 analyzers. Two independent series of analyses are performed for
each instrument. The target value is then calculated as the median of the determined
values.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Not applicable.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-off was determined using a master calibrators for the assay that has
values assigned that are traceable to the World Health Organizations (WHO)

standards. The sponsor used the WHO anti-Toxoplasma serum (TOXM), 3rd
International Standard for T. gondii from NIBSC, UK. Two independent series of
analyzes were performed on the Elecsys 2010, cobas e 411, and the MODULAR
ANALYTICS E170/ cobas e601 analyzers. The samples were run in duplicate and
the target values were calculated as the median of the determined values. This fulfils
the requirements of demonstrating a target values for the Toxo IgG CalCheck levels
