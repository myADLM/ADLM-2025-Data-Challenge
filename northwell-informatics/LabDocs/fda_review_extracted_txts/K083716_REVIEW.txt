H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The FIRST RESPONSE® Early Result Pregnancy Test is an in vitro diagnostic
home use test device intended for the early detection of pregnancy. The test may
detect the pregnancy hormone (hCG), in some cases, as early as 6 days before the
missed period (5 days before the expected period).
This test is only intended for individual use at home. It is not intended for use in a
healthcare setting.
Important note regarding negative results:
Some pregnant women will not be able to detect hCG in their urine 6 days before the
missed period. If you test negative before your missed period, but think you may still
be pregnant, you should re-test again a few days after your missed period.
Important note regarding positive results:
Because this test detects very low levels of hCG, there is a small chance that this test
will give positive results even if you are not pregnant. Chances of this are greater for
women nearing age 40 and older.
All results should be confirmed by your healthcare provider, especially when making
decisions about future medical care.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For over the counter use
This test is only intended for individual use at home. It is not intended for use in
a healthcare setting.
4. Special instrument requirements:
None
I. Device Description:
The FIRST RESPONSE® Early Result Pregnancy Test kit consists of two
chromatographic test strips enclosed in plastic housing and the package insert. The
test strips contain avidin-biotin chemistry and mouse monoclonal and goat anti-mouse
polyclonal antibodies.

The device is intended to detect pregnancy, in some cases, as early as 6 days before
the missed period (5 days before the expected period). The ‘expected period’ is
defined as Day 0 of a woman’s menstrual cycle while “missed period” is defined as
Day 1 of the menstrual cycle.

concentrations of hCG. In the first study the urine samples were prepared
from a negative urine pool and also spiked with purified hCG at 8, 10, and 12
mIU/mL. In the second study urine samples were prepared from a negative
urine pool and also spiked with purified hCG at lower hCG concentrations of
3.2 and 6.3 mIU/mL. Study participants were asked to interpret the result of
the FIRST RESPONSE® Early Result Pregnancy test as either positive or
negative using the instructions provided with the test.
The results are summarized in the table below.
Samples with hCG Results
Study 1 (104 consumers)
0 mIU/mL (n=104) 104/104 negative
8 mIU/mL (n=104) 101/104 positive (97%)
10 mIU/mL (n=104) 101/104 positive (97%)
12 mIU/mL (n=104) 104/104 positive (100%)
Study 2 (~300 consumers)
0 mIU/mL (n=104) 104/104 negative
3.2 mIU/mL (n=102) 5/102 positive (5%)
6.3 mIU/mL (n=104) 40/104 positive (38%)
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The effect of high dose hCG on the test was evaluated using hCG standards
(WHO 4th IS) ranging from 1,000 mIU/mL to 500,000 mIU/mL. All samples
yielded the expected positive results.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The test is calibrated against the WHO 4th I.S. for hCG.
The stability testing protocol used to support the shelf life was reviewed. The
sponsor claims a 24-month shelf life for the test when stored below 86°F
(30°C).

Not applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
Various prescription and OTC drugs (acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid,
ascorbic acid, caffeine, gentisic acid, atropine, phenothiazine,
phenylpropanolamine , ampicillin tetracycline, all at 10 µg/mL), potential
endogenous interferants (glucose and albumin at 20 mg/mL, hemoglobin,

bilirubin, estriol at 10 μg/mL) and homologous hormones (hLH and hFSH at
1000 mIU/mL and hTSH at 1 mIU/mL) were added to aliquots of non-
pregnant urine pool at hCG levels of 0 and 25 mIU/mL. These samples were
run on the FIRST RESPONSE® Early Results Pregnancy Test and in each
case, no effect on the performance of the test was observed. All samples
produced negative results at 0 mIU hCG/mL and positive results at 25 mIU
hCG/mL.
f. Assay cut-off:
This device is intended to detect pregnancy 5 days before the expected
menstrual period. See the precision section above for performance at different
concentrations of hCG.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The performance of the subject device was compared to the predicate test of
the same name, FIRST RESPONSE® Early Result Pregnancy Test. Urine
samples from clinically determined pregnant and non-pregnant women were
tested on both the predicate device and three lots of the device under review.
All non-pregnant samples were negative and all pregnant samples were
positive.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
A study was performed to determine the incidence of positive results in urine
from non-pregnant females when tested with FIRST RESPONSE® Early
Result Test. Urine specimens from non-pregnant women in pre-menopausal
(ages 18-40) peri-menopausal (41-55 years) and post-menopausal (>55 years)
age groups were evaluated. Testing was performed with three (3) lots of
devices.
The results are summarized in the table below.
Age Group Urine specimens (n) Positive results (%)
18-40 years 63 0/189 (0%)
41-55 years 104 13/312 (4.2%)
>55 years 104 4/312 (1.3%)
Detection of hCG in Early Pregnancy Clinical Samples
An early pregnancy study was performed to support the sponsor’s claim that the
device detects hCG in urine up to five (5) days before the expected period. Urine
specimens were collected daily by women attempting to conceive. In all, 51
individual conceptive cycle sample panels were evaluated each having urine
samples from 7 days prior to and 2 days after the first day of the expected
menstrual period (day 0). A total of 102 women consumers participated in the
study to evaluate and interpret the samples from the conceptive cycles. The
samples were randomized and tested individually using three (3) lots of the First
Response devices. Each sample was tested twice and each result recorded
independently.
When performed and interpreted by the consumer participants, the FIRST
RESPONSE® Early Result Pregnancy Test detected a positive result in 68% of
the cycles 5 days before the expected menstrual period, 89% of the cycles 4 days
before the expected menstrual period (EMP), 100% of the cycles 3 days before
the EMP, 100% of the cycles 2 days before the EMP, and 100% of the cycles 1
days before the EMP.
