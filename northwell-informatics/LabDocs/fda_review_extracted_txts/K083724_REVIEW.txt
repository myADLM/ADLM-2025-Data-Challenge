H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Urine strip test strips are for “in vitro” diagnostic use and are intended for
prescription use near-patient (point of care) and centralized laboratory locations.
Urine Strip includes test pads for qualitative and semi-quantitative determination of
urobilinogen, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, proteins, nitrite, pH, blood, specific gravity,
leukocytes and ascorbic acid in urine.
Urine test strips results may provide information regarding the status of carbohydrate
metabolism, kidney and liver function, acid-base balance and urinary tract infections.
Test results can be used along with other diagnostic information to rule out certain
disease states and to determine if microscopic analysis is needed. The test is to be
read visually.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable. The device is a visually read single use device.
I. Device Description:
The Wiener lab Urine Strips are in vitro diagnostic reagents strips containing dry
chemicals for the qualitative and semi-quantitative detection of urobilinogen, glucose,
ketones, bilirubin, proteins, nitrite, pH, blood, specific gravity, leukocytes and
ascorbic acid in urine. The sample reacts with the solid phase dry chemical reagent

peroxidase catalyzes the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with potassium iodide to colors
ranging from greenish light-blue through greenish-brown and then to brown.
Bilirubin: is based on the coupling of bilirubin with 2,4-dichlorophenyl diazonium salt in
a strong acid medium. The color changes from light tan to dark-tan.
Ketone: is based on the reaction of acetoacetic acid in urine with nitroprusside. The
resulting color ranges from tan, when no reaction takes place, different purple shades for
positive reactions.
Specific Gravity: is based on the pKa change. In the presence of urinary cations, protons
are released from a polyelectrolyte producing a color change in the bromothymol blue
indicator from blue to yellow.
Blood: is based on the pseudoperoxidase activity of hemoglobin, which catalyzes the
reaction of 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbencidine with buffered organic hydroperoxide. The
resulting color ranges from greenish-yellow to greenish-blue and then to dark blue.
pH: is based on a double indicators (methyl red and bromothymol blue), which gives a
broad range of colors covering the entire urinary pH range. The colors range from orange
to greenish-yellow and then to bluish-green.
Protein: is based on the color change of the indicator, tetrabromophenol, in the presence
of proteins. A positive reaction is indicated by a color change from greenish-yellow to
green and then to dark-green.
Urobilinogen: is based on the diazotization reaction of a diazonium salt and urinary
urobilinogen in a strong acid medium. The color changes range from light-oink to dark
reddish-pink.
Nitrite: is based on the reaction of the p-arsanilic acid and nitrite, derived from a dietary
nitrate in the presence of bacteria in urine, to form a diazonium compound. This
compound reacts with N-(1-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine in an acidic medium. The
resulting color is pink. Any degree of pink color is considered positive.
Leukocytes: reveals the presence of granulocyte esterases. The esterases cleave a
pyrazole ester derivative to release hydroxyrazol derivative. This derivative reacts
with diazonium salt to produce a purple product.
Ascorbic acid: is based on the reducing process of ascorbic acid. The composition
comprises certain aromatic compound which is colored in its oxidized state but which
becomes colorless when reduced by ascorbic acid. The color changes from dark-green
to greenish-yellow.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing was performed using 2 commercially available urine
controls (negative and a positive). Within-run precision was performed in 20
replicates in one day with three lots and three operators. The between-run
assayed both controls once a day for 20 days using three lots and three
operators. The results were read by comparing color reactions to the color
blocks on the canister label. Results are displayed in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The range of the device was assessed by repeat testing with spiked urine
samples containing known concentrations for each analyte. Test material was
adjusted to match the mid-point of a concentration range for a particular color
block on the strip. The samples were repeated in replicates of 10 with three
test strip lots and three operators (one lot per operator). The results are
obtained by the direct comparison of the reagent strip with the color blocks on
the bottle label. The results are presented in the tables below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
No information on traceability was provided.
Real time stability studies have been conducted. Protocols and acceptance
criteria were described and found to be acceptable. When stored at 2-30 ºC the
assay reagent is good until the expiration date 18 months.

d. Detection limit:
The sensitivity of the assay was validated by spiking negative/normal urine
samples to known concentrations for each analyte (70% of the cut-off, 100%
of the cut-off and 130% of the cut-off). The samples we repeated in replicates
of 20 with three test strip lots and three operators (one lot per operator) in one
day. The results are obtained by the direct comparison of the reagent strip with
the color blocks on the bottle label. The results are presented in the tables

e. Analytical specificity:
Urine samples with known analyte concentration were spiked with possible
interfering substances to various concentrations. The samples we repeated in
replicates of 3. The results are obtained by the direct comparison of the
reagent strip with the color blocks on the bottle label. The results are
presented in the tables below:
