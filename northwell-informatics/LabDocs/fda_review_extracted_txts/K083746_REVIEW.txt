H. Intended Use:
1) Intended use(s):
The BioSign® Flu A+B test is an in vitro rapid qualitative test that detects influenza type
A and type B nucleoproteins antigens directly from nasal swab, nasopharyngeal swab,
and nasalpharyngeal aspirate/wash specimens obtained from patients with signs and
symptoms of respiratory infection. It is intended to aid in the rapid differential diagnosis
of influenza A and B viral infections.
A negative test result is presumptive and it is recommended these results be confirmed by
viral culture.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the
sole basis for treatment or other management decisions. The test is intended for
professional and laboratory use.

L. Test Principle:
The BioSign® Flu A+B test utilizes the chemical extraction of viral antigens followed
by solid-phase immunoassay technology for the detection of extracted antigen,
influenza A and/or B. In the test procedure, a specimen is collected and placed for
one minute into the extraction well of the test device containing extraction solution,
during which time antigen is extracted from disrupted virus particles. The test device
is then raised, tapped and laid back down onto a level surface to allow the solution in
the extraction well to migrate through the pads containing lyophilized detector
antibodies conjugated to gold dye and then through the test membrane. If influenza
antigens are present in the specimen, they will react with anti-influenza antibody
coupled to gold dye particles, migrate through the membrane as antigen-antibody-dye
complexes, bind to the immobilized anti-influenza antibody on the membrane, and
generate a colored line in the test line position (A and/or B). The rest of the sample
and unbound/bound dye complexes continue to migrate to the control line position
(C), where antibody to the anti-influenza antibody is immobilized, and forms the
control line.
Interpretation of Results
Formation of the Control line serves as an internal control to demonstrate that
lyophilized antibodies in the dye pad have been hydrated and that sufficient sample
has been applied to allow for migration to the Test line and beyond. If the Control
line does not appear within the designated incubation time, the result is invalid and
the test should be repeated. The BioSign® Flu A+B test has two test line indicators,
one for influenza A and one for influenza B. The two test line indicators allow for the
separate and differential identification of influenza A and/or B from the same
specimen. If either test line appears in the test result window, together with the
control line, the test result is positive for influenza.

a) Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility study for the BioSign® Flu A+B test was conducted at two
physicians’ offices and one laboratory using a panel of 90 coded specimens for
each site. Testing was performed by two personnel for five days at each site. The
panel consists of coded samples of high negative, low positive and moderate
positive specimens for each of influenza A and B. For influenza A and B positive
samples, A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and B/Maryland/1/59 were used. The low positive
was the LoD level of each strain. Each specimen level was tested in triplicate
every day per operator. Each operator conducted test using the coded samples
following the test protocol given in the package insert as if they are testing patient
sample including the sample extraction step.
The results obtained at each site agreed 100% with the expected results. No
differences were observed within run (15 replicates), between runs (five different
days), or between sites (two POL sites and one lab).
b) Linearity/assay reportable range: NA
c) Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or method):
NA
d) Detection limit:
The Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined for each of the two strains
selected from the influenza type A and type B strains listed in the analytical
sensitivity section below. The sensitivity level of each selected viral strain
established in the analytical sensitivity study was tested 60 times to confirm the
sensitivity level as LoD level, which gives 95% detection rate. All four viral
strains tested were detected 96.7% of the time in 60 replicates.

NOTE: The performance characteristics of the test with cultured avian influenza A
subtype H5N1 virus, or with specimens from human infected with H5N1 or other
avian influenza viruses are unknown.
The performance of the BioSign® Flu A+B test was evaluated with human specimens
obtained from patients infected with the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus consisting of sixty
six (66) frozen clinical nasal and nasopharyngeal swab samples that had previously tested
positive for 2009 H1N1 by the cleared CDC RT-PCR test. The BioSign® Flu A+B test
detected 71% (47/66) of the CDC RT-PCR test positive specimens. The detection rate
was 91% with the higher tittered specimens and 38% with the lower tittered specimens.
f) Analytical specificity
The potential cross-reactivity of the non-influenza respiratory pathogens and other
microorganisms with which the majority of the population may be infected was tested
using the BioSign® Flu A+B test at medically relevant levels, 106cfu/mL for bacteria and
105pfu/mL for non-flu viruses. None of the organisms or viruses listed in the table below
gave a positive result with BioSign® Flu A+B at the tested concentration.

g) Interfering substances
The interference study was conducted using medically relevant concentrations of the
potentially interfering substances listed below with two strains each of influenza type A
and type B to assess the potential interference of the substances on the performance of the
BioSign® Flu A+B test. The test was conducted by spiking each substance into samples
containing the lowest detectable virus level of influenza Type A or Type B for the
positive interference testing and into samples without influenza virus for the negative
interference testing. Each substance had no inhibitory effect on the BioSign® Flu A+B
test performance at the concentration listed in the table below.

3) Clinical studies
a) Clinical sensitivity:
A prospective clinical study was conducted from January 2007 to March 2008 and
during March and April 2009 to determine the performance of the BioSign® Flu A+B
test for nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash, nasopharyngeal swab, and nasal swab
specimens. The samples were collected at 5 sites in the USA from patients who
visited physicians’ offices and clinics with signs and symptoms of respiratory
infection during the study period. All collected samples were tested with BioSign®
Flu A+B, and were cultured to confirm the results of BioSign® Flu A+B. The total
number of patients tested was 862, of which 30% were 5 and younger, 38% were 6-
21 years old, and the rest were older than 21. Forty eight (48) percent were male and
52% were female.
The combined data from all sites of the prospective study are presented in the tables
below. The samples that produced discrepant results between BioSign® Flu A+B and
viral culture were further evaluated with an FDA cleared PCR based assay (real time
RT-PCR, PCR hereafter). These results are presented in the footnote below each
table.

As further verification of the PCR test results shown from the samples with discrepant
results between BioSign and viral culture, available archived remnant samples from the
clinical studies with concordant results were also tested by PCR. The specificity for both
Flu A and Flu B was 100%, while the sensitivity for Flu A was 90% and the sensitivity
for Flu B was 91.7%.
Archived Samples
Eighty (80) frozen archived samples originally obtained from influenza positive patients
visiting Columbia NY Presbyterian Hospital and confirmed as positive for either
influenza A or Influenza B by viral culture were tested with BioSign Flu A+B.
