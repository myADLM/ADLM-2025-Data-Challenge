1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Amphetamines II (AMPII) is an in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative and
semiquantitative detection of amphetamines and methamphetamines on automated
clinical chemistry analyzers at cutoff concentrations of 300 ng/mL, 500 ng/mL and
1000 ng/mL when calibrated with d-methamphetamine. Semiquantitative test
results may be obtained that permit laboratories to assess assay performance as part
of a quality control program. Semiquantitative assays are intended to determine an
appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method
such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS).
Amphetamines II provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific
alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical
result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI EP5-A2, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement
Methods, Approved Guideline.
L. Test Principle:
The ONLINE Amphetamines II assay is based on the kinetic interaction of
microparticles in a solution (KIMS) as measured by changes in light transmission. In
the absence of sample drug, soluble drug-polymer conjugates bind to antibody-bound
microparticles, causing the formation of particle aggregates. As the aggregation
reaction proceeds in the absence of sample, the absorbance increases. When a urine
sample contains the drug in question, this drug competes with the conjugate-bound
drug derivative for microparticle-bound antibody. Antibody bound to sample drug is
no longer available to promote particle aggregation, and subsequent particle lattice
formation is inhibited. The presence of sample drug diminishes the increasing
absorbance in proportion to the concentration of drug in the sample. Sample drug
content is determined relative to the value obtained for a known cutoff concentration
of drug.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor conducted two separate precision studies using Hitachi 917
analyzer for samples containing d-methamphetamine and d-amphetamine.
Precision was determined according to a CLSI (EP5-A2) precision protocol.
Samples were prepared by spiking a negative human urine pool with either
d-methamphetamine or d-amphetamine at the following concentrations: zero
drug, -75%, -50%, and -25% below the cutoff, cutoff, and +25%, +50%,
+75%, and +100% above the cutoff. The d-methamphetamine and d-
amphetamine stock solutions had an analytically confirmed concentration of
1 mg/mL based upon Certificate of Analysis. Samples were tested in 2
replicates per run, 2 runs per day for 21 days, total n=84. During precision
testing with d-amphetamine, 9 calibrations were performed. During

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity across the range was confirmed by serially diluting a spiked urine pool
containing drug in desired levels listed in the table below. Each sample was assayed
on Hitachi 917 analyzer in the semi-quantitative mode. The results were averaged
and compared to the expected result and the percent recovery was calculated.
Sponsor calculated the % recovery by dividing the recovered result by the target
concentration and then multiplying by 100. Results are presented below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The assay is calibrated using d-methamphetamine. Calibrators for cutoff levels (300
ng/mL, 500 ng/mL, 1000 ng/mL) included in this device has been previously
cleared in k060645. Control materials for three cutoff levels have been previously
cleared in k080183, k090939.
The sponsor provided the stability study protocols for reagent stability, and it is
based on the real time stability studies conducted at 2-8oC. The on-board stability
for open vials is 56 days. The sponsor recommends that users should not freeze the
reagents.
d. Detection limit:
Performance at low drug concentrations in the semi-quantitative assay was
characterized by determination of recovery (see section b above).
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was determined by spiking various concentrations of structurally
similar drug compounds into drug-free urine. The cross reactivity studies were
conducted for both semiquantitative and qualitative modes to determine the
approximate quantity of each compound that is equivalent in assay reactivity to the
300, 500, and 1000 ng/mL assay cutoff. The table below shows the semiquantitative

The cross-reactivity studies for structurally unrelated compounds were conducted
using urine spiked with drug to low positive (+25%) concentration and a high
negative (-25%) concentration for each cutoff level (300, 500, 1000 ng/mL) to
determine the potential interference of the assay with variety of endogenous and
pharmaceutical substances. Aliquots of pooled drug-free human urine and urine
samples were further spiked with structurally unrelated compounds at a
concentration of 100000 ng/mL (except for LSD [(2500 ng/mL] and Δ-THC-9-

urine. Both studies tested in semi-quantitative and qualitative modes. For both
studies, the potentially interfering compound was spiked into human urine
samples containing either d-amphetamine or d-methamphetamine at
concentrations roughly equivalent to the ±25% cutoff concentration. The d-
amphetamine and d-methamphetamine stock solutions had an analytically
confirmed concentration of 1 mg/mL based upon Certificate of Analysis. The

There is the possibility that other substances and/or factors not listed above may
interfere with the test and cause false results, e.g., technical or procedural errors.
The sponsor includes a note in the labeling about not assaying the Tina-quant
Hemoglobin A1c Gen. 2 and the Amphetamines II assay on the same analyzer as
follows:
“When you are running Amphetamines II, and Tina-quant Hemoglobin A1c Gen.
2 assay on a Hitachi 917 system, please avoid processing Amphetamines II as the
first test from standby status. If no other testing is pending then a dummy test
sample should be processed to prevent the Amphetamines II from being the first
test from standby (Dummy test order any test having an R1 (not HbA1c).”
To test for possible positive and/or negative interference from specific gravity, the
sponsor prepared samples containing drug at control levels (±25% of each cutoff
concentration) with specific gravities ranging from 1.001 to 1.020. No positive or
negative interference due to specific gravity was observed.
To test for potential negative interference from pH the sponsor prepared samples
containing drug at control levels (±25% of each cutoff concentration) with pH
ranging from 4.5 to 8.0. No negative interference due to pH was observed.
f. Assay cut-off:
There are three cutoff concentrations claimed for both d-amphetamine and d-
methamphetamine: 300 ng/mL; 500 ng/mL; 1000 ng/mL.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor conducted an initial method comparison study to evaluate the
performance of the device for d-methamphetamine. This study involved 190
unaltered clinical samples (114 negative and 76 positive) evaluated by the
methamphetamine assay and also tested for methamphetamine using GC/MS.
The agreement between GC/MS and new device results for both qualitative and
semi-quantitative modes of the device are listed in the tables below.

The sponsor conducted two additional studies for both d-amphetamine and d-
methamphetamine assays. The results were compared with GC/MS results for each
cutoff concentration used in the new device. The sponsor used 40 unaltered urine
samples negative for amphetamine or methamphetamine, including 4 near cutoff
negative samples (i.e. values between cutoff and -50% of the cutoff by GC/MS for
each drug), and 40 unaltered urine samples positive for amphetamine or
methamphetamine including 4 near cutoff positive samples (i.e. values between
cutoff and +50% of the cutoff by GC/MS for each drug).
New Device Results vs. stratified GC/MS Values for the d-Amphetamine assay:
The results for d-amphetamine listed in the tables below demonstrated a 92.5%
negative agreement at the 300 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL cutoff concentrations with
GC/MS for both the semiquantitative and qualitative assays. For d-amphetamine
cutoff concentration of 1000 ng/mL, the device produced 95% and 97.5% negative
agreement with GC/MS results for semiquantitative and qualitative assays,
respectively. 100 % positive agreement was observed between GC/MS and the new
device for both semiquantitative and qualitative assays at all cutoff levels. The
comparison between GC/MS and new device results are listed in the tables below.

The sponsor evaluated the cause for the discrepant results generated between the new
device and GC/MS for negative samples, and determined that the samples contained d-
methamphetamine that also produced a signal due to cross-reactivity. The results between

The sponsor evaluated the root cause for the discrepant results generated between the
new device and GC/MS for negative samples, and determined that the samples contained
d-amphetamine that also produced a signal due to the presence of antibody targeting d-
amphetamine in the device. The results between GC/MS and new device cross reactivity
data for d-methamphetamine at 300 ng/mL cut-off are listed in the tables below.
