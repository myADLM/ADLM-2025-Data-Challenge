L. Test Principle:
The ARK Topiramate Assay is a homogeneous immunoassay based on competition
between drug in the specimen and topiramate epitope labeled with the enzyme
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for binding to the antibody reagent. As
the latter binds antibody, enzyme activity decreases. In the presence of drug from the
specimen, enzyme activity increases and is directly proportional to the drug
concentration. Active enzyme converts the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH that is measured spectrophotometrically as a rate of
change in absorbance.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated using CLSI Guideline EP5-A2: Evaluation of
Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods as a guideline.
Tri-level controls containing topiramate were used in the study. Each level of
control was assayed in quadruplicate twice a day for 20 days. Each of the runs
per day was separated by at least two hours. Each run was calibrated
separately. Two lots of reagents were used.

Three patient sample pools were evaluated in a 5-day precision study. A high
patient pool was supplemented with topiramate stock prepared by gravimetric
addition of purified USP topiramate in methanol. The serum samples were
assayed in quadruplicate twice a day for 5 days. Each of the runs per day was
separated by at least two hours. One calibration curve was used to quantitate
all five days. A total of 40 determinations were made for each sample.

The claimed measuring range for this device is 1.5 to 54.0 µg/mL. The study
to evaluate linearity was performed on the ROCHE Hitachi 917. A 60.0
µg/mL serum sample was prepared by adding USP topiramate gravimetrically
into pooled human serum. This high sample was mixed with human serum
negative for topiramate in varying proportions to create a dilution series of 19
samples with varying topiramate concentrations between across the assay
range. The topiramate value of the high sample was confirmed by
measurement with a reference method (gas chromatography). Two analytical
runs of three replicates of each sample were assayed on an automated clinical
chemistry analyzer. The results of the six replicates were averaged. The data
was analyzed using linear regression as well as non-linear fitted polynomial
regression. The linear bias was estimated by the predicted results according to
1st order and 2nd order mathematical regressions and the percentage difference
between the predicted values according to CLSI EP6-A. Percentage difference
between the predicted values of the 1st and 2nd order regressed values was
considered acceptable if it was ± 10%. A linear relationship was
demonstrated between 1.2 and 54.0 µg/mL.
Dilution/Carry-over: High sample carryover and accuracy of dilution were
evaluated. Pooled human serum was supplemented gravimetrically with USP
topiramate to contain 80.0 μg/mL of topiramate (High Sample) and 2.0 μg/mL
(Low Sample). A single replicate was tested and five sets of the following
sequential arrangement were tested: “H H H L L L ”. The mean result for 5
1 2 3 1 2 3
replicates of L represents the possible carryover effect compared to the mean
1
result for 5 replicates of L (unaffected by a preceding high sample). No
3
carry-over was observed from a high topiramate sample to a low topiramate
sample.
Accuracy of dilution of a high sample was accomplished by diluting the High
Sample manually with the ARK Topiramate Calibrator “A” (zero calibrator as
diluent). A four-fold dilution was made to achieve an expected value of 20.0
μg/mL. The mean of 10 replicate measurements of diluted topiramate was
calculated to determine the percentage recovery. Two lots of assay were used
for these studies. Recovery of all diluted samples was acceptable (98.8%).
Recovery: Analytical recovery was evaluated by adding concentrated
topiramate drug (USP) into human serum negative for topiramate. The stock
solution was added volumetrically to human serum negative for topiramate,
representing drug concentrations across the assay range. Test sample
concentrations were 1.5, 2.5, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 10.0, 15.0, 30.0, 45.0, and 55.0
μg/mL.
Two analytical runs of three replicates of each sample were assayed on an
automated clinical chemistry analyzer. The results of the six replicates were
averaged and compared to the theoretical target concentration and the
percentage recovery was calculated. Recovery at all samples was within ±
10% of the expected sample concentration.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Freezing and Thawing: Three human serum pools were created to evaluate
time of storage at refrigerator temperature (2 to 8 °C) and the effects of
freezing and thawing. The topiramate levels of the serum pools were
approximately 4, 10 and 30 μg/mL, which spans the suggested therapeutic
range of 2 to 25 μg/mL. One aliquot of each specimen was refrigerated for the
duration of the study, 28 days. Three additional aliquots were frozen, with one
aliquot each to evaluate 1, 2 and 3 freeze/thaw cycles. Freeze/thaw (F/T)
cycles included a minium of 1 day for each period of freezing before thawing.
All specimens were tested together on Day 5. After testing, the three aliquots
were refrozen, and on Day 28 all specimens were tested again. This caused the
three aliquots to have undergone an additional freeze/thaw cycle each to give
2, 3, and 4 freeze/thaw cycles for the respective specimens. The original
refrigerated aliquot was maintained as the control throughout the testing
period for each specimen, and Day 0 measurements were also made. Each test
point included triplicate measurements. The mean topiramate levels were
calculated.
Tri-level quality controls for the ARK Topiramate Control were used to
evaluate freezing and thawing of the calibrator matrix. The nominal
concentrations are 2.5 (LOW), 10.0 (MID) and 40.0 (HIGH) μg/mL. Three
sets of controls were frozen, with 1, 2 or 3 freeze/thaw cycles respectively.
One set was refrigerated under normal storage and served as the control. Two
analytical runs were performed with 5 replicate determinations of topiramate
per run. The mean topiramate concentration was calculated for 10 replicates
each. Human serum specimens endured up to 28 days refrigeration and up to
4 freeze/thaw (F/T) cycles. No substantial differences either from the Day 0
measurement prior to challenge or in comparison with the measured
topiramate in refrigerated aliquots were observed for the three specimens
studied. The sponsor recommends that clarified specimens be stored up to
one week at 2 to 8°C. If testing will be delayed more than one week,
specimens should be stored frozen (≤ -10°C) up to four weeks prior to being
tested. Users should limit the number of freeze-thaw cycles.
Expected values: ARK Topiramate Calibrator is comprised of a synthetic
protein matrix (buffer, bovine serum albumin, and preservatives) with the
following concentrations (μg/mL) of topiramate: CAL A (0.0), CAL B (2.0),
CAL C (4.0), CAL D (8.0), CAL E (24.0) and CAL F (60.0). ARK
Topiramate Control is comprised of a synthetic protein matrix (buffer, bovine
serum albumin, and preservatives) with the following nominal concentrations
(μg/mL) of topiramate: LOW (2.5), MID (10.0) and HIGH (40.0). Topiramate
is traceable to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) topiramate. There is no
internationally recognized standard for topiramate.
Value Assignment: Calibrators and controls are prepared gravimetrically and
using USP topiramate. New lots must have topiramate levels ±5% compared
to an internal reference calibrator or control lot.
6

--- Page 7 ---
Stability: Accelerated and real time stability studies are being performed to evaluate
the stability of the ARK Topiramate Assay, Calibrator and Control. Stability testing
protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable.
Multiple lots are tested; precision and accuracy is evaluated after testing multiple
replicates at each testing time point.
In addition, avoid prolonged exposure to temperatures above 32˚C.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Quantitation (LOQ) studies were conducted using CLSI Guideline
EP 17-A: Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of
Quantitation.
Pooled human serum representative of the patient specimen matrix was
supplemented with topiramate to give concentrations of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5
μg/mL. Eight replicates of each sample were tested in each of five runs to give
a minimum of 40 replicates of each LOQ sample tested. The LOQ of the
ARK Topiramate Assay is defined as the lowest concentration for which
acceptable inter-assay precision (≤ 20% CV) and recovery (± 15%) is
observed.
Nominal Mean SD % CV % N
(µg/mL) (µg/mL) Recovery
0.5 0.3 0.03 8.8 62.0 40
1.0 1.0 0.05 5.3 96.0 40
1.5 1.4 0.05 3.7 94.2 40
The sponsor’s criteria of LOQ were met at 1.0 μg/mL, but the claimed LoQ for
the ARK Topiramate Assay is 1.5 µg/mL.
Results below the measuring range are reported as <1.5 μg/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
A study was performed on the ROCHE Hitachi 917 to evaluate potential
interferents of the assay.
Interference studies were conducted using CLSI Protocol EP7-A2:
Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry as a guideline. Clinically high
concentrations of potentially interfering substances in serum with known
levels of topiramate (approximately 5 and 20 μg/mL) were evaluated. Each
sample was assayed using the ARK Topiramate Assay, along with a serum
control of topiramate. Multiple replicates of each sample and their respective
serum controls were tested. The mean results of topiramate were calculated
and the percentage recovery relative to the serum control mean result was
determined. Interference was indicated when addition of a compound led to a
> 10% change in measuring topiramate levels above the results seen in the
control.

was performed with the proposed device on the ROCHE Hitachi 917 and on
an FDA-cleared device (predicate). One instrument and two lots of reagents
were used. 113 specimens were tested; unaltered patient samples up to 54.0
µg/mL were included. In addition, 15 specimens were supplemented with
USP topiramate to create samples with topiramate levels that more fully
spanned the assay range.
Specimens were diluted in the zero calibrator for the predicate method in
order to obtain a quantitative measurement at concentrations above its
reportable range.

b. Matrix comparison:
A study was performed on the ROCHE Hitachi 917 to study the equivalency
of plasma and serum. Individual plasma and serum samples negative for
topiramate were obtained and these samples were supplemented with
topiramate at four concentrations spanning the proposed measuring range.
Four anticoagulants studied included sodium heparin, lithium heparin, sodium
EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetate), and potassium EDTA.
Six replicates of each sample were tested and the mean result was calculated.
The mean percentage recovery in various plasma and serum was determined
relative to a serum control. All of the plasma types evaluated were found to
be equivalent to serum for the measurement of topiramate.
The use of serum separator tubes was not evaluated.

inconsistent correlation exists between levels of circulating topiramate to toxicity,
adverse affect or clinical efficacy1. Topiramate levels above 25 μg/mL may occur
infrequently. Therefore, monitoring topiramate concentration in patients is
warranted.
