510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
k083801
B. Purpose for Submission:
New device for US consumer market
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
KHN Solutions, LLC Bactrack Select 30, 50, and 70 Breathalyzers
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Quantitative (electrochemical fuel cell sensor)
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Bactrack Select 30, 50, and 70 breathalyzers are self-contained units with a
sensor at the top of the unit for breath sampling. The LCD displays a timer for
countdown. There is one start button on the S30 and two buttons, a start button
and mode button, on the S50 and S70. The mode button is used to display the
number of uses and aids in the re-calibration of the device. The devices display
the calculated percent blood alcohol concentration (BAC) up to 2 decimal places
(0.08%) for the S30 and S50 and the 3 decimal places (0.082%) for the S70. The
LED/LCD display also shows the number of uses prior to each device usage.
These devices are powered by two AA batteries.
2. Principles of Operation:
The sensing material in gas sensors is metal oxide (SnO ). When the SnO is
2 2
heated to a high temperature in air, oxygen is adsorbed on the crystal surface with
a negative charge. Then donor electrons in the crystal surface are transferred to
the adsorbed oxygen, resulting in leaving positive charges in a space charge layer.
Thus, surface potential is formed to serve as a potential barrier against electron
flow. Inside the sensor, electric current flows through the conjunction parts (grain
boundary) of SnO micro crystals. At grain boundaries, adsorbed oxygen forms a
2
potential barrier which prevents carriers from moving freely. The electrical
resistance of the sensor is attributed to this potential barrier. In the presence of a
deoxidizing gas, the surface density of the negatively charged oxygen decreases,
so the barrier height in the grain boundary is reduced. The reduced barrier height

decreases sensor resistance. The relationship between sensor resistance and the
concentration of gas is expressed by an equation to determine the alcohol
concentration.
3. Modes of Operation:
This device has only one mode of operation.
4. Specimen Identification:
There is no mechanism to identify the specimen.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy:
The sponsor performed a consumer study to determine if consumers could
correctly use and interpret the device using only the supplied instructions for
use and compare to the results obtained by an evidential breath alcohol tester
(the LifeLoc FC10). Seventy-six participants took their breath alcohol
reading with the Bactrack S30, S50 and S70 Breathalyzers and recorded the
result. Immediately afterward, the participants were administered a breath
alcohol test using the professional device operated by a trained individual.
For the S30, the breath alcohol paired concentrations ranged from BAC of
0.000 to 0.272% (by the evidential device). Linear regression analysis of the
data showed a slope of 0.8519, a y-intercept of 0.0173 and a correlation
coefficient of 0.861.
For the S50, the breath alcohol paired concentrations ranged from BAC of
0.000 to 0.272 (by the evidential device). Linear regression analysis of the
data showed a slope of 1.019, a y-intercept of 0.0061 and a correlation
coefficient of 0.9519.
For the S70, the breath alcohol paired concentrations ranged from BAC of
0.000 to 0.272 (by the evidential device). Linear regression analysis of the
data showed a slope of 1.0667, a y-intercept of 0.0034 and a correlation
coefficient of 0.9244.

After the study, participants were asked questions about the ease of use,
instructions and about the ability to understand and interpret the test results
displayed by the device. The results are presented below:

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
This device was not tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA). The sponsor performed their own testing using the
S50 and collected performance data using the NHTSA requirements for
precision and accuracy as a guide. These requirements (referred to as Model
Specifications) consist of 20 trials at a Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) of
0.000, 20 trials at a BAC of 0.008 and 20 trials at a BAC of 0.032. BACs are
simulated in breath by a Breath Alcohol Sample Simulator (BASS), which
provides an alcohol-in air test sample with known alcohol concentrations,
flow rate and air composition. The acceptance criteria for the Model
Specifications are: not more than one negative result at 0.032 BAC, not more
than one positive result at 0.008 BAC, and not more than one negative greater
than zero and no positives at 0.000 BAC. The Bactrack S50, being
representative of the S30 and S70 technological characteristics, had no
negatives at 0.032 BAC, no positives at 0.008 BAC and no positives at 0.000
BAC. Negatives are defined as being less than 0.020 BAC. Positives are
defined as being greater than or equal to 0.020 BAC.
c. Linearity:
These devices will report concentrations from 0.00 to 0.400% BAC. However,
the DOT Model Specifications require accuracy and precision testing up to a
concentration of 0.032 only; therefore, true linearity over the entire measuring
range of the device was not evaluated. These devices met all of the applicable
NHTSA requirements for precision and accuracy as described above.
d. Carryover:
Carryover studies are not required by NHTSA and were not performed using
these devices.

e. Interfering Substances:
The sponsor chose to duplicate the NHTSA requirements for cigarette smoke
interference. The sponsor evaluated the possibility of cigarette smoke
interference with the devices. An alcohol-free person who smokes cigarettes
smoked approximately one half of a cigarette. Within one minute after
smoking, the subject took a breath alcohol reading. The subject then repeated
this procedure for 5 trials. The acceptance criterion for this trial is: no
positive results. The Bactrack S50, being representative of the S30 and S70
technological characteristics, produced all negative results in this study.
2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
a. Limit of Detection:
The DOT Model Specifications do not specifically address the detection limit
of breath alcohol devices. However, the devices must be tested at a BAC of
zero (blank reading) to assess the possibility of false positives. This consists
of 20 trials under normal laboratory conditions at a BAC of 0.000. Non-
alcoholic human breath is to be used as the sample. For devices capable of
providing a reading of greater than 0.000 BAC and less than 0.020 BAC, the
acceptance criterion is: not more than one such result. The Bactrack S50,
being representative of the S30 and S70 technological characteristics, had no
false positives in this trial.
b. Temperature:
The DOT Model Specifications require testing 10 and 40o C to assess any
possible effects of temperature. At 10o C, 20 trials are required at 0.008 BAC
and 20 trials are required at 0.032 BAC. Acceptance criteria are: not more
than one positive result at 0.008 BAC, and not more than one non-positive
result at 0.032 BAC. The Bactrack S50, being representative of the S30 and
S70 technological characteristics, had no positive results at 0.008 BAC and no
non-positive results at 0.032 BAC.
At 40o C, the requirements are identical. Again the Bactrack S50, being
representative of the S30 and S70 technological characteristics, had no
positive results at 0.008 BAC and no non-positive results at 0.032 BAC.
c. Vibration:
The DOT Model Specifications require vibration testing to assess any possible
vibrational effects.

--- Page 8 ---
Twenty trials are required at 0.008 BAC and 0.032 BAC. Acceptance criteria
are: not more than one positive result at 0.008 BAC, and not more than one
non-positive result at 0.032 BAC. The Bactrack S50, being representative of
the S30 and S70 technological characteristics, had no positive results at 0.008
BAC and no non-positive results at 0.032 BAC.
d. Cutoff:
For the purposes of performance testing, a BAC cutoff of 0.020 was used to
distinguish positive from negative samples.
K. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
L. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
