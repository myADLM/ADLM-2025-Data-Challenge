L. Test Principle:
Blood sample is added to a cylindrical blood holding cup. An oscillating pin is immersed
into the blood holding cup. Movement is obstructed when a clot forms and attaches to the
pin and cup surfaces. As the clot becomes firmer, the rotational movement of the pin is
reduced. The motion of the pin is detected by an optical detection system. The rotational
movement of the pin is converted into amplitude. An amplitude of 0 mm means
unobstructed rotation, and an amplitude of 100 mm can be regarded as blocking of the pin by
the clot. The TEM amplitude is a measure of the clot firmness.
The following parameters are used to describe the clot firmness:
MCF (mm) – Maximum clot firmness (maximum amplitude) of the developed clot during the
test
A10, A20 – Clot firmness (amplitude) at the time points 10 and 20 minutes after CT
CT (s) – Clotting time The time from test start until first significant level of clot firmness
(2mm) is reached
CFT (s) – Clot formation time. The time from the CT/R until a clot firmness of 20 mm is
reached
α – Alpha angle. Angle between the baseline and a tangent to the clotting curve through the
2 mm (CT/R) point.

--- Page 5 ---
Dose-response curves for heparin, for dilution and for urokinase on the INTEM assay,
were presented to demonstrate thromboelastograph principles: coagulation kinetics, clot
firmness, and hyperfibrinolysis.
Dose response to UF heparin was presented to demonstrate coagulation kinetics. It is the
most widely used anticoagulant in clinical practice, and it inhibits plasma coagulation
(mainly FIIa). Heparin was spiked in the concentrations 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 U/ml.
A dose-dependent effect was seen on all INTEM parameters.
Dose response to dilution affect was presented to demonstrate clot firmness. Blood
samples depleted of platelets or fibrinogen decreases clot firmness. To simulate the
depletion of platelets and fibrinogen due to plasma expander substitution in a patient,
normal blood was diluted in saline to 90, 80, 70, 60 and 50%. A pronounced dose-
dependent effect was seen on the INTEM A20 (Figure 10), the CFT and the Alpha Angle.
The effect on the CT parameter was very weak. Only at the 50% dilution the CT results
began to prolong in comparison to the 100 % whole blood control, but the values were
never elevated above the upper reference limit.
Hyperfibrinolysis dose response was demonstrated in-vitro, through spiking studies with
the physiological plasmin activator urokinase was spiked in the concentrations 10, 20, 30,
40, and 50 U/ml. In most cases, there was a clot lysis within 1 hour from 20 U/ml on. A
decrease of the median Lysis Onset Time (LOT) and A20 parameter was seen from 20
U/ml on. The other parameters CT, CFT, and Alpha were not affected as within the
urokinase concentration range tested the clots fully before the clot lysed.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run (channel-to-channel), total, and operator-to-operator precision were
evaluated. The sample pool consisted of the following sample types:
• Normal blood samples in the reference ranges
• Level 1 blood samples (at the medical decision limit between normal and
hypocoagulable): normal blood samples diluted with physiological saline solution and
spiked with a direct thrombin inhibitor
• Level 2 blood samples outside the reference ranges (at the medical decision limit
between normal and hypercoagulable): normal sample spiked with fibrinogen (up to
approximately 8 g/L)
• ROTROL N (level 1 - mimicking ‘normal’)
• ROTROL P (level 2 - mimicking ‘pathological’)
Within-run precision was assessed by performing five consecutive runs of each
sample/control. Each run was performed using four different channels of ROTEM® in
parallel which resulted in 20 replicates per test and sample.
Total precision was determined by analyzing two levels of control in duplicate on two
separate runs, over 20 working days. The two test runs were separated by at least two
hours.
Between-operator precision was investigated by five different operators analyzing the
two control samples during one working day, using two different channels per test and
sample. Results were deemed acceptable based on the following:

Clinical samples from patients with suspected or acute hemostasis disorders in the
peri- or postoperative phase or at the ICU were included in the study. The study
included patients with normal coagulation, hypocoagulable and hypercoagulable
states in order to obtain results over the whole range of the individual parameter
results. A unique sample identifier, the reason for the surgery, and a brief qualitative
description of the clinical finding at the time of blood draw were obtained for each
patient included in the study. Patients were recruited from three (3) US sites. The
samples for the activated tests were analyzed within two hours from blood draw, the
non-activated test (NATEM) was analyzed within one hour.

N. Instrument Name:
ROTEM® delta
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Automatic
2. Software:
Instrument uses Linux operating system. No unauthorized software can be installed by
the user. No user access at the operating system level is allowed. Software on the
measurement path is used for measurement result calculation, controlling functions,
monitoring the measurement process and data analysis. The measurement is represented
in a graphical picture and as numeric results.
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Sample identification information is manually entered into the instrument.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Samples are collected in 3.2% sodium citrate, and pre-warmed to 37ºC in a sample
holding cup. The instrument automatically pipettes samples and reagents. Samples are
stored at room temperature, and must be used within four hours of collection.
5. Calibration:
The ROTEM® delta device uses a two tier calibration. A factory set calibration that
involves the elasticity of the spring connector, and a zero-signal auto-calibration that is
monitored as long as the instrument is turned on.
6. Quality Control:
The controls lyophilized plasma based reagents that have to be reconstituted fresh for
each test run. The controls are recommended to be run with each series of assays and
with any change of personnel operating the tests. The package inserts of ROTROL N and
ROTROL P show batch-specific target reference ranges for each parameter of the
ROTEM® tests. The material can therefore not only be used to monitor precision, but
also the accuracy of the system (device, reagents, and test operation).
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
