--- Page 3 ---
•dispenses 100 μL of sample into a cuvette
•dispenses 50 μL of Ancillary Reagent and 50 μL of Lite Reagent and incubates for
2.75 minutes at 37°C
•dispenses 200 μL of Solid Phase and incubates for 5.5 minutes at 37°C
•separates, aspirates, and washes the cuvettes with Wash 1
•dispenses 300 μL each of Acid Reagent and Base Reagent to initiate the
chemiluminescent reaction
•reports results according to the selected option, as described in the system operating
instructions or in the online help system.
A direct relationship exists between the amount of TSH present in the patient sample
and the amount of relative light units (RLUs) detected by the system.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
CLSI protocol EP5-A2 was used as a guideline to study precision using 2
Centaur XP analyzers for 20 days with 2 runs per day. Four controls and six
patient serum pools were assayed in duplicate in two runs for 20 days on at
least two ADVIA Centaur systems using two reagent lots and two calibrator
lots (n ≥ 80 for each sample). Precision also was evaluated for patient plasma
pools. Five plasma pools were assayed in duplicate in two runs per day for 20
days on one ADVIA Centaur XP System using two reagent lots and two
calibrator lots (n = 80 for each sample). The Serum and Plasma Pools were
prepared using commercially available serum and plasma units. Different lots
of serum and plasma units were used in the preparation of each pool. Serum
Pool 1 and Plasma Pool 1 were not spiked with stock TSH concentrate. Serum
Pools 2 to 6 and Plasma Pools 2 to 5 were spiked with stock TSH concentrate.
The results of the study are presented in the table below.

The standardization of the TSH3-Ultra method is traceable to the WHO
International Standard for Human TSH (IRP 81/565). A comparison over the
full range of the assay gave the following correlation:
ADVIA Centaur TSH3-Ultra = 1.103 (WHO) - 0.111 mIU/L; r=1.000
On-board stability experiments showed that the reagent is stable for 28 days at 2-
8◦C and the sponsor requires that it is calibrated every 7 days.
Shelf life stability experiments showed that the reagent is stable for 24 months at
2-8◦C

d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) for the TSH3-Ultra assay was determined as
recommended in CLSI guideline EP17-A. A TSH3-Ultra negative equine base
pool was used as a blank and was analyzed on two ADVIA Centaur XP
instruments over 12 days. The sample was tested twice daily using two
different reagent pilot lots with 2 replicate determinations per run and the
daily analyses were separated by at least 2 hours. Each instrument was
calibrated on day one only. The LoB was calculated to be 0.001 µIU/mL.
Limit of Detection (LOD) - Four low human sample pools with mean values
ranging from 0.0027 to 0.0111 mIU/L were used to determine the LoD.
Human serum pools were prepared by pooling samples with low TSH
concentration at 0.0056, 0.0072, 0.009 and 0.0097 mIU/L. The human pools
were analyzed with 2 different reagent lots, on 1 ADVIA Centaur XP system
over 10 days with 2 replicates/sample/run for a total of 40 replicates/sample.
The LoD was determined nonparametrically since the requirement of
normality was not met for these pools for all combinations of reagent lot and
system. The LoD was calculated to be 0.006 µIU/mL.
Functional Sensitivity - Six levels of serum based pools were used to
determine functional sensitivity. Human serum pools were prepared by
pooling samples with low TSH concentration at 0.0023, 0.0042, 0.0056,
0.0072, 0.009 and 0.0097 mIU/L. Six human serum pools each were assayed
on one Centaur XP system using two reagent pilot lots, twice per day for 20
days. For functional sensitivity, the total imprecision results generated at each
of six pool levels for each reagent lot and system were fitted with an
appropriate nonlinear function using the nonlinear regression program. The
functional sensitivity was determined to be 0.008 µIU/mL, which is the lowest
analyte concentration at which the total imprecision for the assay does not exceed
20%. The results of the study are presented below.

Hook effect: High TSH levels can cause a paradoxical decrease in the RLUs
(high dose hook effect). In this assay, TSH levels as high as 3000 mIU/L will
assay greater than 150 mIU/L Hook Effect: A concentrated sample of purified
TSH was measured both neat and on dilution within the measuring range of
the TSH-3 Ultra assay. There was no high dose effect observed at TSH
concentrations up to 3,000 mIU/mL. This assay uses a two-step design that
significantly reduces the risk of a high dose hook effect.
e. Analytical specificity:
The purpose of specificity study is to determine if other glycoproteins with
alpha sub-units similar to that of TSH cross-react with TSH antibodies in the
TSH3-Ultra assay. The following substances were tested: Human Chorionic
Gonadotropin (hCG), Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing
Hormone (LH). Specificity of the ADVIA Centaur-Ultra assay was evaluated
by adding the purified hormones, hCG at 200,000 mIU/mL. FSH at 1500
mIU/mL and LH at 600 mIU/mL into three serum samples. Each test sample
was compared to a matched unspiked control using two reagent lots.
The following substances were tested in human serum samples: Human
Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG -Scripps 2286001) at 200,000 mIU/mL,
Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH- Scripps 2187401) at 1500 mIU/mL and
Luteinizing Hormone (LH- SCRIPPS 2270102) at 600 mIU/mL. Three serum
samples with TSH concentrations of 0.95, 1.93 and 3.66 uIU/mL were spiked
with the above hormones at the target levels. The resulting samples were
assayed for TSH along with the matched unspiked controls on one Centaur XP
system using two lots of reagents. The % cross-reactivity was less than 5%.
for all three hormones.
Interfering Substances:
Interference by endogenous substances was evaluated in serum sample
according to the guidelines of CLSI Document EP7-A2. The following
substances were tested: conjugated and unconjugated Bilirubin, hemoglobin
(lysed RBC) and triglycerides. Each sample was spiked with an interferant to
the maximum and half maximum levels. Each test sample was compared to a
matched unspiked control. The percent change of TSH recovery was
calculated as % Recovery = (Observed spiked sample dose/ Observed
unspiked sample dose) x 100

Two serum samples with TSH concentrations of 1.10 uIU/mL and 6.40
uIU/mL, respectively, were spiked with the above interferents at the target and
half target levels. The resulting samples were assayed for TSH along with the
matched unspiked controls. The recoveries ranged from 96.3% to 100.9%

Heterophile Interference Study: Interference by HAMA Type 1 and HAMA
Type 2 pools as well as 19 HAMA positive samples ranging from 62.5 to 215
ng/ml were evaluated using four reagent lots on one ADVIA Centaur XP
system. The recoveries of HAMA Type 2 for four TSH3-Ultra reagents
ranged from 1.18 to 1.28 uIU/mL. The recoveries of HAMA Type 1 for four
TSH3-Ultra reagents ranged from 3.50 to 6.71 uIU/mL. Assay of a wide range
of HAMA positive samples showed that there was no significant difference in
the TSH values between the four TSH3-Ultra reagents and the current TSH3
reagent. The results demonstrate that TSH3-Ultra reagents like the current
TSH reagent are not affected by interference of heterophile antibodies.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The new TSH3-Ultra assay was compared to the predicate device by testing
241 clinical samples consisting of stored (previously frozen) and fresh serum
samples. The samples ranged from 0.009 to 148.2 mIU/L were performed on
the Advia Centaur XP system. This protocol was run in accordance with CLSI
document EP09-A2. Samples were procured from commercial vendors
(retrospective study). In-house donor samples were collected from apparently

comparison correlation: y= 0.99x +0.09, r= 0.998
b. Matrix comparison:
Matched heparinized plasma, EDTA plasma and serum samples were
collected from patients in the range of 0.008 to 150 mIU/L TSH. Correlation
was performed on 92 pairs of serum and lithium heparin plasma samples and
93 pairs of serum and EDTA plasma samples on the Centaur XP system.
Some of the paired samples were spiked with a TSH stock to achieve
concentrations covering the analytical assay range. The following results
support the use of lithium heparin and EDTA plasma samples with the
Centaur TSH3-Ultra assay.

The sponsor determined their own reference ranges for adults, adolescents
and pediatric populations. To determine the reference range for the ADVIA
Centaur TSH3-Ultra Assay, aliquots of each patient sample were run on each of
two ADVIA Centaur XP systems. Two lots of TSH3-Ultra reagents and one lot
each of FT3 and FT4 reagents were used for all samples, and one lot each of
aTPO and aTG reagents were used for the adult (≥ 18 years old) age group only.
Adult Reference Interval: Two hundred and twenty nine adult serum specimens
were obtained from apparently healthy adult blood bank donors and tested for
aTPO, aTG, FT4, FT3 and TSH. Seventy samples were considered abnormal
because the FT3, FT4, aTPO, aTG values were outside the ranges given in their
corresponding current Centaur Instructions for Use.
.The reference intervals for each combination of Advia Centaur XP system and
reagent lot are given below:
Reagent System Lower Upper Reference
Lot Reference Limit Limit
114080 AF26108B 0.549 4.796
AT26108E 0.572 4.603
114081 AF26108B 0.570 4.631
AT26108E 0.561 4.515
Adult Reference Interval: The adult reference interval determined for ADVIA
TSH3-Ultra assay is 0.550 to 4.783 mIU/L. The reference intervals were
established by calculating the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the distribution of
values obtained with the assay
Adolescent Reference Interval: One hundred and eighty three ‘leftover”
adolescent (12 years of age to less than 18 years of age) serum specimens were
obtained from routine laboratory testing and tested for FT4, FT3 and TSH. Nine
samples were considered abnormal because the FT3 and FT4 values were outside
their respective reference intervals given in the current reference literature.
All adolescent serum specimens that met the following criteria were included in
the study: If the FT3 values were between 2.6 and 4.8 pg/mL, [1] and if the FT4
values were between 0.6 and 1.4 ng/dL. [2]

Adolescent Reference Interval: The adolescent reference interval for the
ADVIA TSH-3 Ultra is 0.505 to 4.942 mIU/L. The reference intervals were
established by calculating the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the distribution of
values obtained with the assay
Pediatric Reference Interval: One hundred and thirty seven ‘leftover” pediatric
(2 years of age to less than 12 years of age) serum samples were obtained from
routine laboratory testing and tested for FT4, FT3 and TSH. Eleven samples were
considered abnormal because the FT3 and FT4 values were outside the range
given in the current reference literature. These intervals are given below.
All pediatric serum specimens that met the following criteria were included in the
study: If the FT3 values were between 2.6 and 4.8 pg/mL, [1] and If the FT4
values were between 0.8 and 1.7 ng/dL. [2]

Disease”, p. 8.
The pediatric reference intervals for each combination of Advia Centaur XP
system and reagent lot are given below:
Reagent System Lower Upper Reference
Lot Reference Limit Limit
114080 AF26108B 0.66 6.31
AT26108E 0.66 5.62
114081 AF26108B 0.67 5.68
AT26108E 0.63 5.59
Pediatric Reference Interval: The pediatric reference interval determined for
ADVIA Centaur TSH3-Ultra assay is 0.636 to 6.267 mIU/L. The reference
intervals were established by calculating the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the
distribution of values obtained with the assay.
Conclusion: The pediatric, adolescent and adult TSH3-Ultra reference intervals
are similar to those cited in the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry
(NACB) reference publication:
