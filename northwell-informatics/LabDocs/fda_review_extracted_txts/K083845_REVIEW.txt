L. Test Principle:
The xTAG® CFTR 60 Kit v2 incorporates multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and multiplex
Allele Specific Primer Extension (ASPE) with Luminex’s proprietary Universal Tag sorting system on the
Luminex® 100 or 200 xMAP™ platform. First, a multiplex PCR reaction produces amplimer sizes
ranging from 179 to 465 base pairs. The sample then undergoes a multiplex allele specific primer

extension (ASPE) reaction where 2 aliquots of the PCR product are run through 2 parallel ASPE reactions
(“A and B reactions”). Panel A (ASPE and bead mix) is identical to that in the xTAG® CF39 Kit v2
product (k083846). Analysis using the xTAG® CFTR 60 Kit v2 requires that each sample be tested with
both the ‘A’ and ‘B’ portions of the Kit.
The ASPE step allows for detection of each allele (wild-type or mutant) of a given locus using an allele-
specific probe (ASP) which contains a unique DNA sequence (tag) at its 5’ end. Each bi-allelic locus has
two ASPs and each tri-allelic loci has 3 ASPs included in the ASPE Mix. For each ASP, the 3’ end of the
primer is a perfect match for its allele, but will have a 3’ mismatch on any other allele. The only
exception is the CFTR dele 2,3 which has two ASPs to detect the presence of the deletion due to the
presence of an underlying polymorphism. Both these ASPs however are tagged with a common tag at
their 5’ end. The DNA polymerase will only extend the primer when there is a perfect match on the 3’
end such that the primer is only extended if its target allele is present in the sample. Biotin-dCTP is
incorporated into the extending chain if extension occurs.
For the hybridization reaction, the 2 ASPE reaction products are added directly to microwells containing
aliquots of the Bead Mix (A and B) which contains bead-immobilized anti-tags which are the perfect
complement to the tag sequences associated with the ASPs in the respective ASPE reaction. Each coupled
bead is spectrally distinguishable from the other coupled beads in a given bead mix. A fluorescent
reporter molecule (streptavidin-phycoerythrin) is bound to the biotin on the extended primers. Each
tagged primer hybridizes only to its unique anti-tag complement; therefore, each colored bead represents a
specific allele, through the bead/anti-tag/tagged primer association. The beads are then analyzed by the
Luminex instrument. The Luminex instrument contains two lasers: one identifies the color-coded bead,
and the other identifies the presence or absence of extended allele specific primer through the
phycoerythrin reporter. Thus, the genotype of that locus is identified by the presence of phycoerythrin
signal attached to one or both ASPs.
For each sample analyzed by the CFTR 60 kit v2, two output files containing MFI signals from the
Luminex instrument are generated (one output file for the “A” reaction and one for the “B” reaction). The
proprietary software component of this product analyzes these two output data files, matches the
information from the two templates based on the Sample IDs, and combines all the information to provide
a final qualitative genotype for the sample. The genotypes identified can be found in the tables shown
above in the section titled Device Description. TDAS CFTR enables the end-user to select between 2
options for the final result displayed for a given sample: Option 1: Full Panel (60 mutations/deletions + 4
variants), or Option 2: ACMG/ACOG panel (23 mutations and deletions). When Option 2 is chosen,
results for the remaining mutations and variants in the full panel are not available to the user.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A multi-site, multi-operator, multi-lot, blinded study design was used to evaluate total variability
of the xTAG® Cystic Fibrosis 60 kit v2. There were 2 operators per site, each performing 1 run
per day across 3 non-consecutive days (3 runs per operator or 6 runs per site). Within a given run,
each assay point was run in duplicate. A total of three (3) assay lots were tested (1 lot at each site).
The reproducibility sample set consisted of genomic DNAs that were purified from 41 clinical
samples, 7 Coriell lymphoid cell lines, and 15 plasmids. Compound heterozygous and
homozygous samples were represented. A summary of results of the reproducibility study and %

Samples that list one allele are heterozygous. Samples 49 through 63 were plasmids.
Samples #43 and #48 (Coriell genomic DNA) made a ‘No Call’ after an allowable rerun at Site 3
(operator 1) whereas sample #57 (plasmid) made 3 miscalls at Site 1 between 2 operators.
Reproducibility of detection of a compound heterozygote dF508 / F508C was also characterized in this
study. Of the 36 replicates of sample #32 tested, 30 generated a dF508 HET call and 6 generated a
dF508 Mu D call. Both results are accurate when taking into consideration the definition of a Mu D call
(i.e. only the mutant allele is detected).

Extraction study: To evaluate the effect of the extraction step on sample
reproducibility, the pre-analytical (sample extraction) step was evaluated at a single
site, using 18 unique clinical (whole blood) samples representing wild-type and 3
mutant genotypes (ΔF508, N1303K, V520F). Three different extraction methods were
tested using the same assay lot by 2 operators, across 9 non-consecutive days. Each
operator performed 3 runs per extraction method, and each assay point was run in
duplicate. The total number of replicates per sample was 36: (3 extraction methods) x
(2 operators / extraction method) x (3 runs / operator) x (2 replicate / run) = 36
replicates. All assays passed, with no miscalls. The xTAG CFTR v2 assays
demonstrated a reproducibility of 100% across the 3 extraction methods evaluated.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability: The stability performance of the xTAG® Cystic Fibrosis 60 Kit v2 was
evaluated using at least three kit lots. The stability protocol includes testing under real-
time and accelerated conditions. Real-time data is based on kit components stored at
the recommended temperature. Accelerated data is based on stressed conditions where
components are stored at elevated temperatures. The baseline shelf-life takes into
consideration both empirical data collected on related kits, including the xTAG® Cystic
Fibrosis 60 Kit v2 and the products cleared under k043011 and k060627, and available
real-time and accelerated data generated through testing the xTAG® Cystic Fibrosis 60
Kit v2. The current claimed shelf-life for the xTAG® Cystic Fibrosis 60 Kit v2 is 12
months, which is supported by historical and accelerated data.
d. Detection limit:
The usable range of the xTAG® CFTR 60 Kit v2 assay was determined by testing serial
dilutions of genomic DNA samples prepared from Coriell lymphoid cell lines. Ten
samples covering 11 mutations were chosen to represent frequently occurring cystic
fibrosis mutations in the pan-ethnic CF population, or because they may present
unusual, potentially problematic conditions, such as relatively high or low MFI values,
high cross-over signals, large amplicons, etc. Both heterozygous and homozygous
samples were evaluated. Each of several genomic DNA samples were assayed in
duplicate at 9 concentrations (300, 150, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 1.56, 0.78 and 0.39
ng/μL). Genomic DNA, extracted from whole blood, was used as a wild-type positive
control in all runs. At each tested concentration, the data across all samples were
pooled. The lowest concentration giving an apparent assay failure rate of ≤5% was
considered an estimator of the LoD. The proposed assay lower bound (LB) was set at a
concentration (C*) lying at or slightly above the estimated LoD. At concentration C*,
22 replicates of each of the 10 genomic DNAs were run along with 8 negative controls
dispersed uniformly throughout the plate to determine the LoD. The Lower Bound and
Upper Bound of the assay range was determined to be 2 ng/µL and 300 ng/µL,
respectively. The LoD was determined to be 1.56 ng/µL. The claimed DNA input
range is 2-300 ng/μL. The assay was optimized for 50 ng/μL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The effects of the potential interferents hemoglobin (150 mg/dL), bilirubin (20 mg/dL),
and triglycerides (300 mg/dL) on the performance of the xTAG® CFTR 60 v2 Kit was
10

--- Page 11 ---
examined using 8 whole blood samples. Four (4) samples were wild type and four (4)
samples were heterozygous (N1303K Het (1 sample), V520F Het (1 sample), and
ΔF508 Het (2 samples)). The sample spiked with interferent was compared to sample
without interferent and run in quadruplicate. Of 48 samples (4 mutations x 3
interferents x 4 replicates), 3 samples produced no-calls that required repeating. Upon
repeat testing, all alleles were called correctly. The results indicated that none of the
substances produced an inhibitory effect on kit performance at the concentrations
tested.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison
Accuracy of the xTAG® CFTR 60 v2 Kit was assessed by evaluating samples
representing all alleles (mutations and polymorphisms) probed by the assay. A total of
488 mutant alleles were tested using a total of 386 clinical samples comprised of both
compound heterozygous and homozygous mutants. The majority of samples consisted
of left-over, anonymized, banked whole-blood specimens. These specimens were
supplemented with genomic DNAs from EBV-transformed lymphoid cell lines (Total
8), and 2 custom-designed plasmids engineered to contain 1-2 CFTR mutations each.
The FDA cleared xTAG Cystic Fibrosis Kit (k043011 and k060627) was used as the
comparator for the panel A mutations and dideoxy-sequencing was used for the panel B
mutations. Acceptance criteria were provided for the Phred Scores.

b. Matrix comparison:
Studies using both wild-type (10) and mutant samples (8) in EDTA and citrate were
conducted to demonstrate that the anticoagulants do not interfere with the assay. The
data supports the claimed anticoagulants.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
The clinical sensitivity and specificity can be estimated based on the published studies
of mutation frequencies in various ethnicities and based on the results of analytical
studies described in this submission.
Other clinical supportive data:
The following literature was provided for the 21 alleles not previously reviewed and
cleared by FDA (all patients had a CF diagnosis). PI refers to Pancreatic insufficient

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Cystic fibrosis is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in the Caucasian
population with an incidence of approximately 1 in 3,200 live births. The incidence of CF
in other ethnic groups varies: approximately 1 in 9500 in Hispanics, 1 in 15,300 in African
Americans, and 1 in 32,100 in Asian Americans. The table below presents the prevalence
of the alleles in the xTAG® CF 60 v2 Kit based on the cited reference.
