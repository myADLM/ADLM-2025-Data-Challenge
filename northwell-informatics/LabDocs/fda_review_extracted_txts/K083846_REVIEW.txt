The amplimer sizes range from 179 bp to 465 bp. Purified genomic DNA is extracted from
each sample and a multiplex PCR reaction is carried out under optimized conditions. Each
sample undergoes a multiplex allele specific primer extension (ASPE) reaction, where an
aliquot of the PCR product is run through the ASPE A reaction. This step allows for
detection of each allele (wild-type or mutant) of a given locus using an allele-specific probe
(ASP) which contains a unique DNA sequence (tag) at its 5’ end. Each bi-allelic locus has 2
ASPs and each tri-allelic loci has 3 ASPs included in the ASPE Mix. For each ASP, the 3’
end of the primer is a perfect match for its allele, but will have a 3’ mismatch on any other
allele. Both these ASPs however are tagged with a common tag at their 5’ end. The DNA
polymerase will only extend the primer when there is a perfect match on the 3’ end, so that
the primer is only extended if its target allele is present in the sample. Biotin-dCTP is
incorporated into the extending chain if extension occurs.
For the hybridization reaction, the ASPE reaction product is added directly to microwells
containing aliquots of the Bead Mix. Each coupled bead is spectrally distinguishable from
the other coupled beads in a given bead mix. A fluorescent reporter molecule (streptavidin-
phycoerythrin) is bound to the biotin on the extended primers. Each tagged primer
hybridizes only to its unique anti-tag complement; therefore, each colored bead represents a
specific allele, through the bead/anti-tag/tagged primer association. The beads are then
analyzed by the Luminex instrument, which contains two lasers: one identifies the color-
coded bead, and the other identifies the presence or absence of extended allele specific
primer through the phycoerythrin reporter. Thus, the genotype of that locus is identified by
the presence of phycoerythrin signal attached to one or both ASPs.
For each sample analyzed by the CFTR 39 kit v2, an output file containing MFI signals from
the Luminex Instrument is generated. The proprietary software component of this product
analyzes this output data file, to provide a final qualitative genotype for the sample. The
software includes a feature which enables users to select between 2 options for the final
output:
Option 1: Full Panel (39 mutations + 4 variants).
Option 2: ACMG/ACOG panel (23 mutations).
When Option 2 is chosen, the non-ACMG/ACOG recommended panel of mutations/variants
will not be available to the user.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A multi-centre, multi-operator, multi-lot, blinded study design was used to evaluate
total variability of the xTAG CFTR v2 system. The experimental design generally
follows CLSI recommendations (EP5-A and MM17-A) and requirements laid forth
by the FDA in I080024.
The study included two arms. Arm A evaluated the reproducibility of the sample
extraction step using 18 unique clinical (whole blood) samples representing wild-type
and 3 mutant genotypes. DNA was extracted using 3 different methods and tested
using the same assay lot by 2 operators, across 9 non-consecutive days. Each
operator performed 3 runs/extraction methods, and each assay point was run in
duplicate. An extraction was performed for each assay run by each operator. The
number of replicates per sample was: (3 extraction methods) x (2 operators/extraction
method) x (3 runs/operator) x (2 replicates/run) = 36 replicates. The results are
summarized in the following table.

c 18 18 x 12 = 216

Arm B evaluated the reproducibility of the analytical (post-extraction) steps of the
assays at 3 external sites using in order of preference and availability, purified
genomic DNAs extracted from clinical (whole blood) samples, purified genomic
DNA extracted from lymphoid cell lines, and/or plasmids. Each set contained
samples representing all mutations and variants probed by the CFTR 39 Kit v2.
There were 2 operators per site, each performing 1 run/day across 3 non-consecutive
days (3 runs per operator or 6 runs per site). Within a given run, each assay point was
run in duplicate. A total of three assay lots were tested (1 lot/site). This arm of the
study also provided information on the ability to resolve different sources of
variability in the post-extraction (analytical) step of the assay. For example, it was
possible to analyze data from a particular site to estimate the operator-to-operator
variability.
The results indicated a precision of >99.54% across the 3 sites. There was one “no-
call” after 1 re-run at Site 3, and 3 mis-calls (from a single plasmid sample) at Site 1.
Reproducibility of a compound heterozygote dF508/F508C was also demonstrated in

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Previous stability studies support a shelf-life of 1 year when kit reagents are stored at
-25°C to -15°C. Repeated freeze-thaw cycles (up to 4) do not compromise the
integrity of the xTAG™ CFTR 39 Kit v2.
Assay controls: The package insert recommends that at least two negative controls
and a rotating set of positive controls (including a dF508 mutation) are included with
each run.
d. Detection limit:
The package insert recommends that purified DNA have at least a UV 260/280 ratio
of >1.5 depending on the extraction method used. The assay has been optimized for
use with 50 ng of total DNA, but reliable results were previously demonstrated with
DNA amounts between 10 ng to 1.5 µg.
The detection limits were determined by serially diluting 10 gDNA samples, obtained
from commercially available cell lines at 10 levels ranging from 300 - 0.39 ng/μL.
The LoD is defined as the lowest amount of genomic DNA in a sample for which the
assay can detect genotypes with a positive agreement rate of ≥ 95%. Eight of the
samples were heterozygous, one (1) was homozygous, and one (1) contained a non-
panel mutation which would be called as wild type by the assay. Three of the
heterozygous samples were compound heterozygotes, but the second allele was a
non-panel mutation and therefore called as wild-type by the assay. At each

concentration, 22 replicates from each of the samples were run. Based on initial
results, a LoD = 1.56 ng/μL was proposed. An additional study was performed using
2 ng/μL for each of the 22 sample replicates. Two samples exhibited 21/22 correct
calls, corresponding to a 95.4% positive agreement. No failures were observed at the
300 ng/μL concentration.
e. Analytical specificity:
To examine the effects of potential interferents that might be found in whole blood
samples, a study was conducted using 8 whole blood samples (4 wild-type for CFTR
mutations, 1 N1303K Het, 1 V520F Het, and 2 ∆F508 Het). Each sample was split
into 6 parts, and incubated in the absence or presence of one of 3 potential interferents
(hemoglobin at final concentration of 1,500 µg/mL, bilirubin at a final concentration
of 200 µg/mL, and a mixture of triglycerides at a final concentration of 30 mg/mL).
Samples were extracted and assayed with the kit according to the instructions.
Dideoxy- sequencing of the CFTR exons in each sample was conducted to confirm
the genotypes of each sample. Results indicated that none of the substances at the
concentrations tested produced a significant inhibitory effect on kit performance.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Accuracy of the xTAG CFTR 39 Kit v2 was assessed through evaluation of samples
representing all alleles (mutations and polymorphisms) probed by the assay. Three
hundred nineteen (319) samples were used in this method comparison study. These
samples were left-over, anonymized, clinical specimens, eight were genomic DNAs
from EBV-transformed lymphoid cell lines, and 2 were custom-designed plasmids
engineered to contain 1-2 CFTR mutations. The genotype of all samples was
confirmed by bi-directional sequencing. The xTAG Cystic Fibrosis Mutation
Detection Kit was used as the comparator method.
For all exons, the results indicated 100% agreement between the xTAG Cystic
Fibrosis 39 Kit v2 and the xTAG Cystic Fibrosis Mutation Detection Kit. There were
0 no-calls and 0 mis-calls in the accuracy study.

frequencies in various ethnicities and based on the results of analytical studies
described in this submission.
b. Clinical specificity:
The clinical specificity can be estimated based on the published literature and the
results of analytical studies described in this submission.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in the Caucasian
population, with an incidence of approximately 1 in 3,200 live births. The incidence of
CF in other ethnic groups varies, as seen in the following table.
Ethnic Group Incidence of Cystic Fibrosis
North American Caucasian 1 in 3200
Ashkenazi Jewish 1 in 3300
Hispanic 1 in 9500
African American 1 in 15 300
Asian American 1 in 32 100
Native American (Pueblo) 1 in 3970
Native American (Zuni) 1 in 1347
N. Instrument Name:
Luminex System (100 IS or 200 including ISv2.3 or xPONENT v3.1 software, calibrators,
and controls)
O. System Descriptions:
See k073506 for a description of the Luminex System and base software environment
Results:
For each sample analyzed by the CFTR 39 kit v2, an output file containing MFI signals from
the Luminex Instrument is generated. The proprietary software component of this product
analyzes this output data file, to provide a final qualitative genotype for the sample. The
software includes a feature which enables users to select between 2 options for the final
output:
Option 1: Full Panel (39 mutations/deletions + 4 variants).
Option 2: ACMG/ACOG panel (23 mutations and deletions).
When Option 2 is chosen, the non-ACMG/ACOG recommended panel of mutations/variants
will not be available to the user.
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this
line of product types:

Yes ____x____ or No ________
1. Specimen Identification:
Users must fill in Batch Information by providing a unique batch Name, Description and
Creator. Users have to enter appropriate patient information, i.e. number of samples, and
sample IDs.
2. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Genomic DNA preparation, multiplex (16-plex) PCR, amplicon treatment, multiplex
ASPE, bead hybridization and incubation with reporter are performed semi-manually.
Subsequently, beads are analyzed by the Luminex 100 xMAP™ system, and data
®
generated analyzed by TDAS CFTR Analysis Software CF-I (TDAS CF-I) to provide
final genotype for the sample. User must pre-select sample view, either “ACMG panel”
or “Full Panel” for each unique patient sample to be analyzed. The user will not be able
to unmask any hidden data for samples for which the “ACMG panel” is selected, and
visa-versa.
3. Calibration:
The Luminex system should be prepared and calibrated according to procedures
described in the Luminex 100 IS 2.3 user Manual or Luminex 200 System user Manual.
The xTAG Cystic Fibrosis v2 T-A IS template must be installed on the computer that
controls the Luminex system.
4. Quality Control:
Negative Controls:
At least two DNase, RNase free water controls are required with each run. The wells
which are negative controls must be designated when analyzing data with the TDAS
CFTR software.
Positive Controls:
It is recommended to routinely include in each run a set of rotating positive controls for
CFTR mutations probed by the kit. Since the CF dF508 mutation is the most common
(accounting for 30-88% of all CF mutations depending on ethnic group*) it is
recommended that a control sample wit this mutation be included in every run. Luminex
Molecular Diagnostics recommends the use of genomic DNA controls similar to the
specimen type whenever feasible although spiked controls (using synthetic DNA) may be
used when specimen samples are not available.
