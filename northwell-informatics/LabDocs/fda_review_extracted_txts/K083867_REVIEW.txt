K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
• Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods;
Approved Guideline (EP5-A2)
• Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline (EP7-A2)
• Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of
Quantitation; Approved Guideline (EP17-A)
L. Test Principle:
The Access SHBG assay is a sequential two-step immunoenzymatic (“sandwich”)
assay. A sample is added to a reaction vessel along with paramagnetic particles
coated with anti-SHBG antibody. During incubation, the SHBG antigen in the
sample binds to the immobilized anti-SHBG antibody on the solid phase.
Alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-SHBG antibody is then added and reacts
with a different antigenic site on the SHBG molecule. After incubation, materials
bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are
washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate Lumi-Phos 530 is added and
the light generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light
production is directly proportional to the concentration of SHBG in the sample.
The amount of analyte in the sample is determined from a stored, multi-point
calibration curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All performance characteristics were performed on the UniCel DxI 800
analyzer.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the proposed device was evaluated using a method based
on the guideline CLSI EP5-A2 using 4 patient samples. Sample 1 was a
serum pool, partly depleted with anti-SHBG paramagnetic particles.
Sample 2 and 3 were unaltered serum pools. Sample 4 was pooled serum
spiked with human SHBG. The samples were assayed in duplicate, twice

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies were performed using 3 serum samples. Sample 1 was
spiked with human SHBG to approximately 200nM. Sample 2 was an
unaltered sample with approximately 35nM SHBG. Sample 3 was partly
depleted with anti-SHBG paramagnetic particles to approximately 3nM
SHBG. At least 6 serial dilutions were prepared from each sample using
Access Wash Buffer II. Each dilution was tested in 4 replicates; neat
sample concentrations were determined as the mean of 8 replicates. The
data was analyzed using linear and quadratic models. The quadratic fit
was found to be significant. Therefore, the degree of non linearity was
assessed by calculating the % difference between the linear and non-linear
model at each concentration. The results are summarized below:

Based upon the linearity study and the limits of detection, the claimed
measuring range is 0.33 to 200 nmol/L.
The package insert states:
• Samples can be accurately measured within the analytical range of
the lower limit of detection (0.33 nmol/L) and the highest
calibrator value (approximately 200 nmol/L).
• If a sample contains less than the lower limit of detection for
the assay, report the results as less than that value (i.e., < 0.33
nmol/L).
• If a sample contains more than the stated value of the highest
Access SHBG Calibrator (S5), report the result as greater than
the value of the highest calibrator. Alternatively, dilute one
volume of sample with 9 volumes of Wash Buffer II.
High-dose hook effect: The potential for a high-dose hook effect was
evaluated using one patient sample spiked to approximately 49,500
nmol/L SHBG and a second sample obtained by dilution an SHBG stock
solution in serum to create a sample with approximately 1000 nmol/L
SHBG. The relative light units at 49,500 nmol/L and at 863 nmol/L did
not fall below the relative light units generated by the highest SHGB
calibrator (S5).
The product insert states:
• The access SHBG assay does not demonstrate any “hook” effect
up to 49,500 nmol/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
The Access SHBG calibrators (0, 3, 9, 27, 80 and 200 nmol/L) and
controls (10 and 100 nmol/L) are traceable to WHO 95/560 reference
material. They are sold separately.
Real-time stability including shelf-life and open vial stability studies were
performed for the controls and calibrators. The study protocols and
statistically calculated acceptance limits were reviewed and found to be
acceptable. At the time of submission, the sponsor has demonstrated
acceptable unopened shelf life of 12 months for the controls and
calibrators when stored at 2 to 8 °C. The sponsor has demonstrated
acceptable open vial stability of 28 days for the calibrators and controls
when stored at 2 to 8 °C.
Calibration Frequency: The calibration curve is stable for 28 days.

d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) and the Limit of Detection (LoD) studies were
performed in accordance to CLSI EP17-A. For LoB, 156 replicates of the
S0 calibrator were measured. The 95th percentile of the replicates was
estimated using a non-parametric approach and the 97.5% upper
confidence limit of this estimate was used to estimate the LoB. For LoD,
180 replicates of 5 low level samples were measured.
The LoB was estimated to be 0.017 nmol/L
The LoD was estimated to be 0.33 nmol/L
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference from various compounds was evaluated on serum samples
containing approximately 13 nmol/L and 140 nmol/L SHBG. The sponsor
defined noninterference as <10% deviation from the un-spiked samples.
Based on data, the sponsor claims no interference for the substances and

To evaluate the potential cross-reactivity of various compounds whose
structure is similar to SHBG the substances were spiked in the Access
SHBG calibrator S0. % cross reactivity was calculated as follows:
[(mean test value-mean control value) x 100]/concentration of compound
tested.
The following compounds at the listed concentrations were tested:

The sponsor provided data to support the claim that no significant cross-
reactivity (defined as ≤ 1.3%) was observed when the calibrator S0 was
spiked with the compounds listed above.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To compare the performance of the Access SHBG assay to the predicate
device, a total of 158 unaltered serum samples ranging from 5.7 to 184.5
nmol/L SHBG were assayed on both devices. The slope, intercept and
confidence interval (CI) were determined using Deming regression; the
correlation coefficient (r2) was determined by linear regression. The
results are summarized in the table below:
n Slope (95% CI) Intercept (nmol/L) (95% CI) r2
158 1.09 (1.06 to 1.12) 1.84 (0.54 to 3.00) 0.94
b. Matrix comparison:
A comparison study was performed following the recommendations in
CLSI EP14-A2 with a total of 61 matched serum and plasma (heparin)

samples. All samples were unaltered and ranged from approximately 10
to 200 nmol/L SHBG. Serum samples were collected in plain and gel
(SST) tubes. Samples were assayed in 3 replicates on one Access UniCel
Dxl 800 instrument. The slope, bias, y-intercept and confidence intervals
(CI) were determined using a Deming regression and the correlation
coefficient (r2) was determined by linear regression. The results are

Analysis was performed including a non-parametric determination of the 95%
reference range and a bootstrap estimation of the 95% confidence interval (CI)
of each of the range estimates. The Access SHBG reference range is
summarized below:
n Median age Median 95% CI
Males (20 – 50 yrs) 151 37 38.2 nmol/L 13.3 – 89.5 nmol/L
Females (20 – 46 yrs) 141 34 47.2 nmol/L 18.2 – 135.5 nmol/L
Post-menopausal females (47 – 91 131 59 49.6 nmol/L 16.8 – 125.2 nmol/L

The product insert states:
• Each laboratory should establish its own reference ranges to assure
proper representation of specific populations.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports
a substantial equivalence decision.
