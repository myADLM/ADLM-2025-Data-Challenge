L. Test Principle:
Vipera lebetina venom, like Vipera russelli (Russell’s viper) venom, directly activates
Factor X without requiring Factor VII. Factor Xa in the presence of calcium,
phospholipid, and Factor V/Va will activate prothrombin to thrombin. Once present,
thrombin will cleave fibrinogen to fibrin and the fibrin polymerizes into a solid clot.
Lupus anticoagulants are phospholipid dependent antibodies. Low levels of
phospholipid are inadequate to neutralize the antibody/inhibitor, whereas, high
phospholipid levels will. The low level of phospholipid in LupoTek DetecTin VL is
sensitive to the present of lupus anticoagulants (LA). The high level of phospholipid
in LupoTek CorrecTin VL renders the reagent insensitive to LA.
PlasmaCon LA is used to monitor testing variable in laboratory quality control system
for assays sensitive to the presence of LA.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability (within-run precision) studies were performed on three lots of
LupoTek DetecTin VL, three lots of LupoTek CorrecTin VL and three lots of
PlasmaCon LA. Results (clotting time in seconds) were determined from
testing two runs per day over 20 days on the STA Compact analyzer
according to CLSI EP5-A2. The mean, SD and 95% CI were calculated for
each analyte. The %CV of the average clotting times was < 5% and was
within the acceptance criteria of ≤ 5% for repeatability and ≤ 10% for within–
device precision.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The reconstituted stability of the LupoTek DetecTin VL, CorrecTin VL and
PlasmaCon LA were assessed by longitudinal studies. With criteria of an age-
related trend and a maximum shift of 10% of the zero point clotting time, the

f. Assay cut-off:
The cutoff for the LupoTek DetecTin VL and CorrecTin VL was determined
by ROC analysis. Plasma from 122 patients was obtained from referring
laboratories. These plasmas were de-identified, but a diagnosis was provided
by the laboratory. For those samples diagnosed as LA positive, the samples
were tested by ISTH guidelines and included two or more assays of different
principles, one of which demonstrates phospholipid dependence (i.e., the
ability of excess phospholipid to neutralize the antibody).
Each sample was evaluated with LupoTek DetecTin VL, CorrecTin VL, and
Diagnostica Stago DRVV Screen and DRVV Confirm in R2’s laboratory.
Normalized ratios (NR) were calculated according to the following equation:
NR = [Screen reagent time of sample/Screen reagent time of PNP]
[Confirm reagent time of sample/Confirm reagent time of PNP]
Each sample was classified as TP, FP, TN or FN in reference to the clinical
status (diagnosis) provided by the referring lab for the LupoTek and predicate
reagents. Results were classified according to the following:
True positive (TP): positive by both the NR and clinical status
False positive (FP): positive by the NR but negative by clinical status
True negative (TN): negative by both the NR and clinical status
False negative (FN): negative by NR but positive by clinical status
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison was conducted on 122 patients analyzed on the STA
Compact in an internal study to determine the cutoff for the LupoTek
DetecTin VL/CorrecTin VL normalized ratio. Subjects included a mix of
known LA patients and other miscellaneous clinical conditions.
Another study using 155 patient samples were analyzed in three laboratories
using LupoTek DetecTin VL and CorrecTin VL, and Diagnostica Stago
DRVV Screen and DRVV Confirm on STA Compact analyzers. Samples
were a mix of known LA patients and other miscellaneous clinical conditions.
Each sample was classified as being positive or negative for LA for each of
the reagents (assays) by calculating the normalized ratio. Percent agreement
was reported as follows:

b. Matrix comparison:
Fresh/frozen study: Patient samples were obtained from known normals
(n=20) and known LA positive (n=11) donors. Each sample was tested before
freezing at -70°C, and after freezing and storage, the samples were thawed in
a 37°C water bath. The difference between the fresh and frozen samples was
calculated and expressed in raw seconds and in percent of the fresh value.
The normalized ratios (NR) were calculated for each pair of fresh sample and
frozen sample and examined for any change that would result in changing the
diagnosis of LA. The study found random shifts in fresh versus frozen
samples; however, there was no change in NR which prompted a change in
diagnosis of the 31 samples. The normalized ratios of the LA positive
samples were essentially unchanged.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
None
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
A study of 131 non-hospitalized healthy donors (as determined by screening with
a PT and APTT) were analyzed with LupoTek DetecTin VL and CorrecTin VL
on a Stago STA Compact analyzer. Samples were double centrifuged and testing
was performed in duplicate. The geometric mean and standard deviation of the
clotting times were calculated and the ranges were calculated as the mean ±2 SD.
The mean PlasmaCon LA clot times (as determined in the precision study) with
DetecTin VL and CorrecTin VL were 83.7 and 39.7, respectively. Results
demonstrate an abnormally prolonged clotting time with DetecTin VL and a
corrected time within the normal range with CorrecTin VL.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
