E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Destiny Max instrument performs hemostasis testing using human samples.
The system is comprised of an instrument that performs the assay testing and a
Personal Computer. The Destiny Max is a high through put instrument with cap-
piercing capability and Graphic User Interface (GUI) software that provides the
user the capability to order tests, visualize and print the results.
2. Principles of Operation:
The Destiny Max is a coagulation analyzer that performs clotting, chromogenic
and imuno-turdimetric coagulation testing. The analytic processes are performed
inside plastic disposable cuvette trays. Cuvettes are extracted from the supply and
travel along a transport system where they are pre-heated. Sample is pipetted
from an open or closed tube, and then a reagent arm adds the appropriate reagent.
The cuvettes are then moved to the analytical section of the transport system
where the measurement (mechanical and/or optical) takes place.
The mechanical measurement module of the Destiny Max system performs the
measurement of clotting times using an electromechanical method. There are
eight mechanical measurement channels, which gives the system the capability to
perform eight simultaneous clotting time measurements of any type.
The optical measurement module of the Destiny Max system is an electro-optical
device that monitors the transmission of changes in the optical reaction cuvette
wells. This module is made of solid state light sources at four different
wavelengths, optical light guides, and detectors. The data points gathered during
the measurement process are used to perform optical clotting time measurements,
chromogenic measurements or immuno-turbidimetric measurements. Once the
analytical process is complete, the cuvettes continue to the waste area where they
are stored for manual removal by the operator.
3. Modes of Operation:
Random access; multi-tasking (an unlimited number of tests may be programmed
at one time)
4. Specimen Identification:

Barcode reader
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Sample is aspirated and dispensed using the cap-piercing probe. For samples that
must be prediluted, the sample will be aspirated from the aliquot cuvette and
transferred to the predilution cuvette, diluted, and transferred to the measuring
cuvette. For samples loaded in Eppendorf cups on the Eppendorf Sample Tray,
the sample will be pipetted directly into the measuring cuvette.
6. Calibration:
Results are calculated into concentration or activity units with the use of stored
calibration curves. Up to 12 calibration curve points/calibrator and up to 5
calibrators per assay can be stored. There are several ways the Destiny Max can
prepare a calibration curve:
1) Automatic dilutions of a single calibrator plasma
2) Automatic dilutions of a single calibrator plasma with a blank added
3) A series of dilutions manually prepared
4) Using a calibration set containing several calibrator plasmas
7. Quality Control:
• 1000 result positions per control level file
• Levy-Jennings-like graphic screen display of up to 120 results on each
control for each test
• Operator alert on screen and result printout when QC error occurs
• Westgard rules or other laboratory definable result criteria evaluation

a. Accuracy:
A three site accuracy study was conducted to demonstrate correlation to the
predicate device. Samples were collected in 3.2% sodium citrate and were
selected from normal as well as the intended patient population. A minimum
of 80 samples per test were run at each site.

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing was performed on all assays and modes following
recommendations from CLSI EP-5A. Testing was run over 5 days. On each
day 4 vials of each control level (3 levels) were reconstituted and run in
triplicate to give a total of 60 data points for each level of control. CV’s were
generally <6%. Precision for the factor levels ran a little higher; however, the
values were within acceptable limits for these parameters.
c. Linearity:
Linearity testing was carried out following guidelines recommended in CLSI
EP6-P. Assays were calibrated, and testing was performed to determine what
range the signal is directly proportional to the concentration or % activity.
Results are expressed as the range, and the correlation coefficient (r) for the
expected vs. observed values over that range.

2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
Normal samples were analyzed for each assay, and a reference interval calculated
using the mean and a 2SD range. The normal reference ranges are provided in the
method applications and package inserts as guidance, however, the labeling also
recommends that each laboratory establish its own ranges to reflect ethnicity and
age of its own population.
The Limit of Blank (LOB) was calculated per CLSI EP17-A for the D-Dimer
Test. The mean and standard deviation for 60 replicates of the diluent were
calculated. It was determined that the data were approximately normally
distributed, and the LOB was determined to be 60 ng/mL.
Testing was performed on the D-Dimer assay using pooled normal plasma (PNP)
spiked up to >100,000ng/mL in order to determine if the assay demonstrated a
high dose hook effect. No hook effect was observed.
K. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
