The ADVIA Chemistry Cystatin C Reagent is composed of two reagents: Reagent 1
is buffer and sodium azide and Reagent 2 is comprised of latex particles coated with
anti-cystatin C antibody (rabbit) and sodium azide.
The ADVIA Chemistry Cystatin C Calibrator is a five level calibrator set. Five 2.0
mL vials are supplied with each kit and contain recombinant human Cystatin C in

The CYSC latex reagent is a suspension of uniform latex particles coated with anti-
cystatin-C antibody. Serum or plasma samples containing cystatin C are mixed with
the latex reagent and agglutination takes place that causes an increase in turbidity.
The turbidity is measured at 571 and 805 nm. The cystatin C concentration in serum
or plasma is determined from a calibration curve that is generated with the calibrators.
The CYSC calibrators consist of a 5-level calibrator set (approx concentrations 0.4,
1.2, 2.4, 4.8 and 8.0 mg/L) which is a ready to use liquid in five 2.0 ml vials.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
The studies were conducted on the ADVIA 1650/1800 instrument.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within run and total imprecision was assessed according to CLSI EP05-A2.
The ADVIA Chemistry Cystatin C Reagent assay was used to measure
cystatin C concentrations in four serum-based control materials, four serum
pools spiked with pure cystatin C and three plasma pools (Li Heparin) two of
which were spiked with pure cystatin C. Samples at the medical decision
levels, normal ranges and abnormal ranges were run in duplicate twice a day
for 10 days (n=40). The results for within-run, between run and total
precision are shown in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity of the CYSC latex reagent was assessed via percent recovery of
serum and plasma samples across the assay range of 0.1 to 8 mg/L. Low and
mid level of the dilution series were prepared from a spiked serum pool.
Serum samples were diluted with saline to form seventeen equally spaced
samples that ranged from 0.02 to 8.43 mg/L. The resulting linear regression
equation was y=1.02x -0.140 with a correlation coefficient of 0.99. The
resulting data are shown below.

The sponsor conducted a lower range linearity study to assess the lower assay
range. Nine equally spaced serum samples (diluted with saline) that ranged
from 0.12 to 1.18 mg/L were assessed for linearity. The percent deviations
were less than 7.4% and the linear regression equation was y=0.980x+ 0.05
with a correlation coefficient of 0.997.

Using the combined results from the linearity studies, the sponsor claimed a
linear range of 0.1 to 8.0 mg/L.
The ADVIA chemistry system has an auto-rerun mechanism that is triggered
by a result above the upper range of an assay. Saline is used to dilute the
original sample (up to three times) to bring the sample to a measureable value.
The sponsor conducted a high dose (hook effect) study to determine if high
doses of cystatin C interfered with the assay. Ten samples were prepared by
spiking a serum pool with Cystatin C to achieve concentrations of 55 mg/L.
There was no interference observed for concentrations up to 55 mg/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There is no international recognized reference standard for Cystatin C. The
ADVIA Chemistry CYSC method is traceable to an internal standard
containing highly purified human Cystatin C. The ready to use 5 level (zero
not included) calibrators are traceable to an in-house preparation with
concentrations of recombinant Cystatin C in human serum. The high
calibrator is prepared by spiking Cystatin C to the target concentration into
human serum which is then serially diluted to achieve the remaining
concentrations.
The CYSC calibrator value assignments were determined by recovery on the
ADVIA 1650. The recoveries of patient samples on ADVIA Chemistry
CYSC methods were compared to the sample recoveries using N Latex
Cystatin C method. This calibrator lot was established as the master calibrator
lot. Subsequent batches of calibrator are value assigned against the master lot.

Stability
Real-time stability studies for the CYSC Calibrator were conducted for 12
months and the results support the sponsor’s shelf-life claim of 12 months.
Two lots of the calibrators were opened at day 0 and stored at 2-8 C. Periodic
testing was performed with the open-vial calibrators and recoveries of controls
were generated. The results were compared with fresh calibrators and the
results support the sponsor’s claimed open- shelf stability for the calibrators of
60 days.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) and Limit of
Detection (LoD) were determined in accordance with the CLSI EP17-A
guidance.
The LoB study was conducted to determine the highest observed measurement
values for samples free of analyte. A blank sample was assayed with 2
reagents and 2 calibrator lots in multiple replicates over a period of 4 days on
2 ADVIA 1650 systems. The LoB was determined to be 0.02 mg/L and
supports the sponsor’s claimed LoB of 0.07 mg/L.
The LoD was conducted using a low cystatin C sample (a serum based control
with an approximate value of 0.37 mg/L). The LoD equation is LoD= LoB
+1.645*(low sample concentration). The sponsor’s LoD was determined to
be 0.03 mg/L. The results support the sponsor’s claimed LoD of 0.10 mg/L.
The LoQ was calculated based on the CLSI Guidance EP17-A in which total
error = bias + 2*SDs. Bias was calculated to be 0.02 mg/L. The LoQ= 0.02
+2*0.01 = 0.04 mg/L. The results support the sponsor’s LoQ claim of 0.10
mg/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Two serum samples containing cystatin C at concentrations within the normal
range (0.6 mg/L) and abnormal range (3.0 mg/L) were evaluated for
interference. The effects of interference by hemoglobin, conjugated and
unconjugated bilirubin, lipemia (intralipid) and rheumatoid factor (RF) were
evaluated. The samples were tested in duplicate and multiple levels (five
equally diluted pools) of interfering substances were tested. Recovery
calculations were performed by comparing observed Cystatin C concentration
at each level of interferent versus observed Cystatin C concentration of
control (no interferent). No significant interference defined as ≤ 10 % was
found on the ADVIA 1650 for hemoglobin up to 1000 mg/dL, conjugated and
unconjugated bilirubin up to 60 mg/dL, lipemia (intralipid) up to 1000 mg/dL
and RF up to 1200 IU/mL.

A list of compounds (acetyl salicylic acid, ibuprofen, prednisone, furosemide,
acetaminophen, ascorbic acid and creatinine) were evaluated for interference
and were found to have no significant (≤ 10%) cross reactivity or interference.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A split sample method comparison study was conducted between the ADVIA
Chemistry Cystatin C method (assayed on the ADVIA Chemistry 1650
system) and the N Latex Cystatin C method (assayed on the (BN System).
Fifty-five serum samples with values ranging from 0.13 to 7.75 m/dL were
assayed with one reagent lot in singlet on each system. The linear regression
equation obtained was y=1.003x+0.021 with a correlation coefficent of 0.986.
b. Matrix comparison:
A serum/plasma comparison test was performed for the ADVIA Chemistry
Cystatin C assay. Fifty-three matched serum and plasma paired samples
containing cystatin C across the range of the assay were analyzed in duplicate
with the assay. Some samples were spiked to cover the assay range. Lithium
heparin and EDTA results are shown below.

from apparently healthy adult in-house volunteers. Serum samples were
measured in singlicate with one reagent lot on the ADVIA 1650 system. The
mean, median 1.5 and 97.5 percentile results were calculated and shown in the
chart below. Ninety-five percent of the specimens fell within the Cystatin C
concentrations of 0.56 to 0.95 m/dL. The results support the sponsor’s reference
range for serum and plasma of 0.56 to 0.95 m/dL.
