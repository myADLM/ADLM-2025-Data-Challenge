L. Test Principle:
The On-Call® Plus Blood Glucose Test Strips are thin strips with a chemical reagent
system using glucose oxidase. They work with the On-Call® Plus Blood Glucose
Meter to measure the glucose concentration in capillary whole blood. Blood is
applied to the end tip of the test strip. The blood is then automatically absorbed into
the reaction cell. The reaction takes place in the reaction cell. A transient electrical
current is formed during the reaction which is detected by the meter. The blood
glucose concentration is then calculated based on the electrical current. The result is
then shown on the meter display. The meters are calibrated to display plasma
equivalent results.

venous blood samples containing heparin anticoagulant at approximately 42%
hematocrit level. The range of glucose concentrations used (2 to 667 mg/dL)
is representative of the measuring range of the meter. The results of meter
readings vs. YSI Plasma Values were compared using linear regression
analysis.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
System traceability and validation of calibration and control materials are
traceable to NIST standard reference material (SRM) 917b, D-glucose
(dextrose) which was used for calibration.
A real time stability study of the control solution with cap closed was
conducted and found to support the 24 month shelf life of the control solution.
In addition, an open and closed stability study of the control solution was also
done to mimic the actual use condition. The study results confirm the 3-month
use life of the control solution.

e. Analytical specificity:
The effect of interference on the On-Call® Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring
System was evaluated with two test strip lots using venous blood samples
containing heparin anticoagulant at approximately 42% hematocrit level at
three glucose concentrations (approximately <60 mg/dL, 100–150 mg/dL and
350-450 mg/dL). The blood samples were then used to prepare the test pool
at low and high concentrations of the interfering substances and control pool.
The acceptance criteria were as follows:
Glucose concentration < 75 mg/dL:
Average absolute bias for each interfering substance compared with
control pool must be ≤ ± 15 mg/dL
Glucose concentration ≥ 75 mg/dL:
Average % Bias for each interfering substance compared with control
pool must be ≤ ±15%

Hematocrit study
The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated on the On-Call® Plus
Blood Glucose Monitoring System with three test strip lots using blood
samples at four glucose concentrations (40-60, 80-120, 250-300, and 450-550
mg/dL). The four levels of glucose concentrations were prepared from venous
blood samples containing heparin anticoagulant at six different hematocrit
levels ranging from 30-55%. Glucose results for each concentration and
hematocrit level were compared to the same plasma glucose concentration on
the YSI at 40% Hematocrit using the acceptance criteria below.
Glucose concentration ≥75 mg/dL:
Average % Bias (Average strip reading vs. Plasma YSI Value at 40% Hct):
within ±15% bias
Individual %Bias (Individual strip reading vs. Plasma YSI Value at 40% Hct):
within ±15% bias
Glucose concentration < 75 mg/dL:
Average Bias (Average strip reading vs. Plasma YSI Value at 40% Hct):
within ±15 mg/dL bias
Individual Bias (Individual strip reading vs. Plasma YSI Value at 40% Hct):
within ±15 mg/dL bias
Results indicate that the On-Call® Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System
can provide accurate results when measuring blood samples having 30–55%
hematocrit ranges covering measurement range of the system.

Altitude study
An altitude effect study was performed by testing each of 15 different samples
at sea level and at elevated altitude of 8,516 ft. The On-Call® Plus Blood
Glucose Monitoring System meets acceptance criteria of having more than 95%
of the data points for all three strip lots within ± 20% bias when glucose
concentration is ≥ 75 mg/dL, and ± 15 mg/dL when glucose concentration is <
75 mg/dL when compared to plasma YSI values. The results indicate that the
On-Call® Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System meets the accuracy
acceptance criteria for testing at both sea level and elevated altitude of 8,516 ft.
Temperature and humidity studies were performed per ISO 15197:2003 and
showed that the meter can be used at temperatures from 5-45°C and at a
relative humidity from 20-90%
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The system accuracy evaluation for the On-Call® Plus Blood Glucose
Monitoring System has been performed according to EN ISO 15197:2003,
Section 7.3 System accuracy evaluation.
A trained technician performed testing with each study subject’s capillary
blood samples from fingertip, palm and forearm sites on the studied system.
The testing was performed using the same method provided in the instructions
for use for the studied system. Exceptions are allowed for very low (<50
mg/dL) and very high (>400 mg/dL) glucose concentration samples. Per EN
ISO 15197:2003, samples with glucose concentration of <50 mg/L and >400
mg/L can be prepared by incubating the samples or by supplementing
additional glucose to obtain the samples in these very low and very high
glucose concentration levels. For each subject, an additional fingerstick
capillary blood sample was also collected into microtainer tubes containing
heparin anticoagulant for the YSI reference instrument testing and hematocrit
level testing.
Study Site:
The tested glucose concentration range was from 43.6 to 473 mg/dL for
fingertip capillary blood testing. The tested glucose concentration range was
from 47.5 to 399 mg/dL for palm and forearm capillary blood testing. The
subject blood hematocrit range is from 32% to 49%.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
The objective of the user performance evaluation study was to demonstrate
that the intended users are able to operate the On-Call® Plus Blood Glucose
Monitoring System (studied system) as well as a trained technician. The user
study was performed for fingertip, palm, and forearm sample sites to
demonstrate that acceptable user performance can be obtained at palm and
forearm alternative sample sites in addition to the fingertip sample site.
The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Score of 6.0 to 7.8 was obtained with the
User’s Manual and the test strip and control Package Inserts of the On-Call®
Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System. In addition, a questionnaire
administered to the participating lay persons indicated user satisfaction with
the ease of operation by following the Instructions for Use in the User’s
Manual and the overall performance of the On-Call® Plus Blood Glucose
Monitoring System.
Device labeling was given to each study subject to allow the subject to learn
and understand how to run testing for the studied system. After reading the
instructions, each study subject performed fingerstick testing on the studied
system by themselves. After each study subject tested themselves, a trained
technician also ran the same testing with the same subject’s fingerstick blood.
The same procedure for fingerstick testing was then repeated for palm and
forearm alternative sites. In the study for each subject, additional fingerstick
capillary blood was also collected into microtainer tubes containing heparin
anticoagulant for the YSI reference instrument testing and hematocrit level
testing.
A user performance study was performed by testing 107 different subjects
over 13 days. Both the layperson and technician performed the testing for
each subject sample for the user study. The tested glucose concentration
range was from 47.5 to 399 mg/dL.
The user performance on the On-Call® Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring
System was evaluated according to EN ISO 15197:2003, Section 8 User
performance evaluation. The user study was performed for fingertip, palm,
and forearm sample sites to show that acceptable user performance can be
obtained at palm and forearm alternative sample sites in addition to the
fingertip sample site.

3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied
directly to the test strip as they are collected
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
