510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
k090067
B. Purpose for Submission:
New device for US consumer market
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
KHN Solutions, LLC Bactrack Select 80 Breathalyzer
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Quantitative (electrochemical fuel cell sensor)
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Bactrack Select 80 breathalyzer is a self-contained unit with a sensor at the
top of the unit for breath sampling. The LCD display displays a timer for
countdown. There are two buttons- start button and mode button. The mode
button is used to display the number of uses and aids in the re-calibration of the
device. The number of uses is displayed prior to each measurement. The device
is powered by two AA batteries. The device also includes six individually
wrapped replaceable mouthpieces and displays up to 4 units. The display window
shows the breath alcohol concentration in increments of 0.001% in the range 0.000%
to 0.400% BAC. Characters are used to instruct the user and display the status of the
device. The device also includes a beeper to give the user audible prompts.
2. Principles of Operation:
The BACTRACK® Select Breathalyzer is an alcohol screening device used for
the detection of alcohol in the breath. The device employs a fuel cell sensor. An
alcohol fuel cell uses an alcohol oxidation reaction. In an alcohol oxidation
reaction, a fixed number of electrons are freed per molecule of alcohol. If alcohol
is present, a corresponding voltage is generated from the fuel cell, which is
proportional to the alcohol content of the breath sample.

J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy:
The sponsor performed a consumer study to determine if consumers could
correctly use and interpret the device using only the supplied instructions for
use and compare to the results obtained by an evidential breath alcohol tester
(the LifeLoc FC10). Seventy-six participants took their breath alcohol
reading with the Bactrack Select 80 Breathalyzer and recorded the result.
Immediately afterward, the participants were administered a breath alcohol

test using the professional device operated by a trained individual. The breath
alcohol paired concentrations ranged from BAC of 0.000 to 0.277. Linear
regression analysis of the data showed a slope of 1.062, a y-intercept of 0 and
a correlation coefficient of 0.9724.
After the study, participants were asked questions about the ease of use,
instructions and about the ability to understand and interpret the test results
displayed by the device. The following table included the questions, answers
and response percentages obtained from the consumer study.

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
This device was not tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA). The sponsor performed their own testing and
collected performance data using the NHTSA requirements for precision
and accuracy as a guide. These requirements (referred to as Model
Specifications) consist of 20 trials at a Blood Alcohol Concentration
(BAC) of 0.000, 20 trials at a BAC of 0.008 and 20 trials at a BAC of
0.032. BACs are simulated in breath by a Breath Alcohol Sample
Simulator (BASS), which provides an alcohol-in air test sample with
known alcohol concentrations, flow rate and air composition. The
acceptance criteria for the Model Specifications are: not more than one
negative result at 0.032 BAC, not more than one positive result at 0.008
BAC, and not more than one negative greater than zero and no positives at
0.000 BAC. The Bactrack Select 80 Breathalyzer device had no
negatives at 0.032 BAC, no positives at 0.008 BAC and no positives at
0.000 BAC. Negatives are defined as being less than 0.020 BAC.
Positives are defined as being greater than or equal to 0.020 BAC.

c. Linearity:
This device will report concentrations from 0.00 to 0.400% BAC. However,
the DOT Model Specifications require accuracy and precision testing up to a
concentration of 0.032 only; therefore, true linearity over the entire measuring
range of the device was not evaluated. This device met all of the applicable
NHTSA requirements for precision and accuracy as described above.
d. Carryover:
Carryover studies are not required by NHTSA and were not performed using
this device.
e. Interfering Substances:
The sponsor chose to duplicate the NHTSA requirements for cigarette smoke
interference. The sponsor evaluated the possibility of cigarette smoke
interference with the device. An alcohol-free person who smokes cigarettes
smoked approximately one half of a cigarette. Within one minute after
smoking, the subject took a breath alcohol reading. The subject then repeated
this procedure for 5 trials. The acceptance criterion for this trial is: no
positive results. The Bactrack Select 80 Breathalyzer produced all negative
results in this study.
2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
a. Limit of Detection:
The DOT Model Specifications do not specifically address the detection limit
of breath alcohol devices. However, the devices must be tested at a BAC of
zero (blank reading) to assess the possibility of false positives. This consists
of 20 trials under normal laboratory conditions at a BAC of 0.000. Non-
alcoholic human breath is to be used as the sample. For devices capable of
providing a reading of greater than 0.000 BAC and less than 0.020 BAC, the
acceptance criterion is: not more than one such result. The Bactrack Select 80
Breathalyzer had no false positives in this trial.
b. Temperature:
The DOT Model Specifications require testing 10 and 40o C to assess any
possible effects of temperature. At 10o C, 20 trials are required at 0.008 BAC
and 20 trials are required at 0.032 BAC. Acceptance criteria are: not more
than one positive result at 0.008 BAC, and not more than one non-positive
6

result at 0.032 BAC. The Bactrack Select 80 Breathalyzer had no positive
results at 0.008 BAC and no non-positive results at 0.032 BAC.
At 40o C, the requirements are identical. Again the Bactrack Select 80
Breathalyzer had no positive results at 0.008 BAC and no non-positive results
at 0.032 BAC.
c. Vibration:
The DOT Model Specifications require vibration testing to assess any possible
vibrational effects.
Twenty trials are required at 0.008 BAC and 0.032 BAC. Acceptance criteria
are: not more than one positive result at 0.008 BAC, and not more than one
non-positive result at 0.032 BAC. The Bactrack Select 80 Breathalyzer device
had no positive results at 0.008 BAC and no non-positive results at 0.032
BAC.
d. Cutoff:
For the purposes of performance testing, a BAC cutoff of 0.020 was used to
distinguish positive from negative samples.
K. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
L. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
