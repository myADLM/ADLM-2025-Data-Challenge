1. Intended use(s):
The Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc. device, D3 DFA Metapneumovirus Identification Kit, is
intended for the qualitative detection and identification of human metapneumovirus
(hMPV) in nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs and aspirates/washes or cell culture. The
assay detects hMPV antigens by immunofluorescence using a blend of three
monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), from patients with signs and symptoms of acute
respiratory infection. This assay detects but is not intended to differentiate the four
recognized genetic sub-lineages of hMPV.
Negative results do not preclude hMPV infection and should not be used as the sole
basis for diagnosis, treatment or other management decisions. It is recommended that
specimens found to be negative after examination of the direct specimen results be
confirmed by an FDA cleared hMPV molecular assay.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as intended use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Fluorescence microscope with the appropriate filter combination for FITC (excitation
peak = 490 nm, emission peak = 520 nm); magnification 200-400X.
I. Device Description:
The device, D3DFA Metapneumovirus Identification Kit, consists of the following
components:
1. Metapneumovirus DFA Reagent (5-mL): One dropper bottle containing a blend of
fluorescein-labeled murine monoclonal antibodies directed against hMPV. The
buffered, stabilized, aqueous solution contains Evans Blue as a counter-stain and 0.1%
sodium azide as a preservative.
2. hMPV Antigen Control Slides (5 slides): Five individually packaged control slides,
each with a well containing cell culture-derived MPV positive cells and a well
containing cell culture-derived negative cells. Each slide is intended to be stained only
one time. Control material has been treated to be non-infectious; however normal
laboratory precautions are required when the material is handled.
3. 40X PBS Concentrate (25-mL): One bottle containing a 40X concentrate consisting
of 4% sodium azide (0.1% sodium azide after dilution to 1X using de-mineralized
water) in PBS.
2

--- Page 3 ---
4. Mounting Fluid (7-mL): One dropper bottle containing an aqueous, buffer
stabilized solution of glycerol and 0.1% sodium azide.
The D3 DFA Metapneumovirus Identification Kit (D
3
MPV Kit) uses a blend of three
hMPV antigen-specific murine MAbs that are directly labeled with fluorescein for
detection of hMPV. The reagent detects but does not differentiate between the four
recognized subtypes of hMPV (subtypes A1, A2, B1, and B2). The MAbs all
recognize a hMPV protein, approximately 46 kilo Daltons in size, which corresponds
with the size of hMPV nucleoprotein, but do not compete with one another for
binding sites.
An overview of the procedure is as follows:
The cells to be tested, derived from a clinical specimen or cell culture, are placed onto
a glass slide and allowed to air dry. The cells are fixed in acetone. The MPV DFA
Reagent is added to the cells which are then incubated for 15 to 30 minutes at 35°C to
37°C in a humidified chamber or humidified incubator. The stained cells are then
washed with the diluted phosphate buffered saline (PBS), a drop of the supplied
Mounting Fluid is added and a cover slip is placed on the prepared cells. The cells are
examined using a fluorescence microscope. The hMPV infected cells will fluoresce
apple-green. Uninfected cells will contain no fluorescence but will be stained red by
the Evans Blue counter-stain.
Materials Provided
1. Metapneumovirus DFA Reagent (5-mL): One dropper bottle containing a blend of
fluorescein-labeled murine monoclonal antibodies directed against hMPV antigens.
The buffered, stabilized, aqueous solution contains Evans Blue as a counter-stain and

2. hMPV Antigen Control Slides (5 slides): Five individually packaged control slides,
each with two wells, one well containing cell culture-derived hMPV positive cells and
one well containing cell culture-derived negative cells. Each slide is intended for
staining only one time. Control material has been treated to be non-infectious;
however, biohazard safety precautions for handling infectious materials are required.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Assay precision, intra-assay variability and inter assay variability were assessed
with a panel of proficiency-level antigen control slides. The reproducibility panel
consisted of 5 panel members. Each panel member was a 2-well slide spotted with
the same cell preparation in each well. The cell preparations used to construct the
slides are the following:
1. Non-infected LLC-MK cells
2
2. Low level hMPV (A1 strain) grown in LLC-MK cells (manufactured to
2
contain between 4 to 10% infected cells).
3. Mid level hMPV (A1 strain) grown in LLC-MK cells (manufactured to
2
contain between 20 to 30% infected cells).
4. High level hMPV (A1 strain) grown in LLC-MK cells (manufactured to
2
contain between 50 to 75% infected cells).
Each panel was tested daily in two separate runs for 5-days by three different
laboratories (30 total runs). The panel members were randomized with different
slide identification numbers to act as a “blinded” panel. An hMPV Antigen
Control Slide (two-well slide, one well contains cell culture-derived hMPV
positive cells and one well contains cell culture-derived negative cells) was
stained according to the D3 DFA Metapneumovirus Identification Kit instructions
for use with each run. The following results were recorded for both the control
slides and the panel slides:
1. Presence or absence of green fluorescence.
2. Percent of cells exhibiting green fluorescence.

A single lot of D3 MPV Kit was used. A total of 210 data points were included in
the reproducibility study data analysis (7 samples and controls/run X 2 runs/day X
5 days X 3 sites = 210). The combined data from the three sites demonstrated that
the detection of hMPV occurs in a reproducible manner. The presence of hMPV
infected cells was reported in 100% (120/120) of the wells in which infected cells
were present. The combined data from the three sites also demonstrated that no
hMPV was detected in non-infected cells. The absence of hMPV was reported in
100% (90/90) of the wells in which infected cells were not present. The total
percent agreement for the D3 DFA Metapneumovirus Identification Kit was 100%
(210/210).

then were accessioned for archival and production level stocks. Preparations of
monoclonal antibodies from each cell line were initially evaluated by indirect
immunofluorescence assay against cell cultures infected with known hMPV.
Antibodies were purified by Protein G affinity using fast protein liquid
chromatography (FPLC).
MAbs characterization
A variety of methods (e.g., SDS-PAGE Electrophoresis, ELISA, Western Blot,
and available databases, such as NCBI) were used to characterize the subject
MAbs in terms of purity, sensitivity, and specificity. MAb purity was checked by
SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. A minimum purity of 90% has been set as the QC
acceptance criterion. Purity is typically ~95%. Candidate MAbs Binding Affinities
were evaluated by measuring the dissociation constants (Kd) for the MAbs using
ELISA. The binding specificities of the candidate MAbs were characterized using
Western Blots. All three candidate MAbs all recognized a 46 kDa protein present
in LLC-MK cell lysates that had been infected by any of the four genetic sun-
2
lineages of hMPV. Searches of the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) databasesyielded presumptive evidence that the target for each of the
three MAb clones is thehMPV nucleoprotein. Nine proteins are known to be
encoded in the hMPV genome.Of the nine hMPV proteins, only the nucleoprotein
is of a size equivalent to the 46 kDa sizenoted on the Western blot of the three
MAb clones.
Each of the three anti-hMPV MAbs were labeled with fluorescein, using
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), with standard procedures. The labeled MAbs
exhibited staining patterns on hMPV-infected cells similar to the patterns seen
with the unlabeled MAbs. A final blended solution of the three labeled MAbs was
formulated to yield optimal fluorescence intensity on hMPV-infected cells, and
lowest background. Studies were conducted to determine that the three MAbs do
not compete with one another for the same antigen binding sites. The self-
competitive epitope blocking study demonstrated that reduced fluorescence could
be observed when targets are first blocked by the same MAb, unlabeled. The
“Cross clone” competitive blocking study was carried out by reacting hMPV
infected (hMPV types A1, B1, and B2) R-Mix cells in plates with the three
unlabeled MAbs at increasing concentrations, and then counter-staining each set
with one of the other two clones (only fluorescein-labeled) at standard
concentrations. This study illustrated that fluorescein staining intensity unchanged
regardless of increased concentration of unlabeled MAb in all labeled and
unlabeled variations.
MAbs analytical sensitivity performance evaluations on cell culture systems
The final blended solution of the three labeled MAbs was also directly compared
to commercially available anti-hMPV MAbs (labeled as ‘research use only’ or
‘analyte specific reagent’) for sensitivity performance on cell culture systems.
Analytical sensitivity of the final blended solution of the three labeled MAbs
testing cell culture specimens was evaluated using cell culture system against a
non-labeled murine monoclonal antibody (MAb-8) to hMPV strain MPV75-

The MAb-8 is a research use only device that has not been cleared by the FDA.
However, there is data presented in the literature addressing its specificity and
sensitivity to hMPV: Landry, Marie L., Ferguson, David, Cohen, Sandra, Peret,
Teresa C. T., Erdman, Dean D., “Detection of Human Metapneumovirus in
Clinical Samples by Immunofluorescence Staining of Shell Vial Centrifugation

1950-1952.) Each of the hMPV subtypes was diluted to a level of ~350 TCID ,
50
and then serial 2-fold dilutions were prepared from that suspension to a final level
of 0.7 TCID . Each dilution of virus was inoculated (0.5-mL) into 6 shell vials of
50
R-Mix (containing monolayers on cover slips), centrifuged at 700xg for 60
minutes and incubated at 35°C to 37°C for 48 hours. The final blended solution of
the three labeled MAbs and the anti-hMPV MAb comparator (CDC MAb-8 used
as IFA) were each used to stain 3 shell vials of each viral dilution. The following
table provides a count of fluorescent-staining viral plaques on each cover slip at
the indicated viral dilutions:

were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours and then stained with the final blended
solution of the three labeled MAbs using the draft procedure of the D3 DFA
Metapneumovirus Identification Kit, and with the anti-hMPV MAb comparator
(CDC MAb-8 used as IFA). Each well was examined for fluorescent cells, and
scored as “positive” (fluorescent cells present) or “negative” (no fluorescent cells).
The experiment was repeated 3 times. Results in the following table are noted as
numbers of positive wells counted in each 96-well plate.

The combined results from the two analytical studies mentioned above showed
significantly better staining with the DHI final blended solution of the three
labeled MAbs than with the RUO unlabeled single MAb.
Analytical performance of the final blended solution of the three labeled MAbs as
DFA reagent was also compared with that of a new commercial hMPV DFA. The
study tested both reagents on acetone-fixed cell spots and hMPV infected shell
vial cultures. The cell spots were prepared from the four laboratory virus subtypes
A1, A2, B1, and B2. The staining results of the DHI hMPV DFA Reagent and the
ASR reagent were very similar.
Stability Studies
Shelf life for the complete kit
The shelf life of the device D3 DFA Metapneumovirus Identification Kit is
established at 18 months, with 24 months of real-time data collected. At time of
the 510(k) submission, November 2008, existing data supported a 24-month shelf
life exclusive of the antigen control slide that has an 18-month shelf life. Stability
studies has been conducted in two phases: (1) using kits produced during the
development phase according to draft written procedures, and (2) using kits
produced according to established procedures by manufacturing staff (this phase is
on-going). Kits are stored at 2°C to 8°C, and are tested at time intervals during
storage according to the study plan. Characteristics monitored are performance, as
well as pH, color and clarity. Acceptance criterion is “bright fluorescence” (as
opposed to “dim fluorescence” or “no fluorescence) observed in fixed, stained,
infected cells (infected to a level of 3 to 4+ cytopathic effect) using DFA Reagent
at 1/16 dilution. The table below summarizes performance results to date:

Shelf life for the hMPV antigen control slides
Real-time stability studies were conducted to establish shelf life of the hMPV
Antigen Control Slide. An expiration dating of 18 months from date of
manufacture, when stored refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C was established. Lots of
slides are reserved for staining with MPV DFA Reagent according to the device’s
instructions for use. Each lot is tested at fresh and at expiration. As part of the
release testing, an additional randomly selected lot may be included in the testing.
Acceptance criterion is “bright fluorescence” observed in fixed, stained, infected
cells using undiluted DFA Reagent. The table below summarizes performance

d. Analytical Sensitivity (Detection limit):
LoD studies on cell culture amplified specimens
Detection limit on cell culture amplified specimens of the D3 DFA
Metapneumovirus Identification Kit were addressed using cell culture systems.
Results of these studies also provide evidence of analytical reactivity with
representatives of each of the four recognized genetic sub-lineages of hMPV, A1,
A2, B1, and B2. Analytical detection limits on cell culture amplified specimens
for the four virus subtypes detected by the D3 DFA Metapneumovirus
Identification Kit were established with results reported in numbers of fluorescent
cells per cell monolayer. Each master stock virus preparation was diluted in a ten-
fold manner. Eight wells of a 48-well R-Mix cell culture plate were inoculated
with each dilution. The plates were centrifuged at 700 xg for 60 minutes, and then
incubated at 35°C to 37°C for 48-hours. Each well was stained with the D3 DFA
Metapneumovirus Identification Kit then examined at 200x magnification and the
number of fluorescent cells counted. In this study, the detection limit for the test
on cell culture amplified specimens is defined as the lowest inoculum level at
which positive wells (i.e. containing fluorescent cells) are observed, in terms of
TCID . The table below summaries the results:

Analytical detection limits on direct specimens for the D3 DFA Metapneumovirus
Identification Kit were addressed using quantified cultures of characterized
isolates of each of the 4 recognized genetic sublineages of hMPV (A1, A2, B1,
and B2). The infected culture cells from a 1000 infected cells/mL culture were
serially diluted with a suspension of uninfected LLC-MK cells. 25-µL aliquots
2
from each dilution level were spotted onto 10 replicate microscope slides, then
fixed and stained according to the instructions for use described in this product
insert. Each cell spot was examined at 200x magnification. Results were reported
as numbers of positive replicates for each set of 10. Analytical detection limits for
each of the 4 hMPV genetic sublineages were defined as the lowest dilutions at
which at least 9 out of 10 replicates were detected. Results are summarized in the

e. Analytical Reactivity:
Refer to analytical sensitivity section
f. Analytical specificity:
The D3 DFA Metapneumovirus Identification Kit was tested for cross-reactivity
against a variety of cells and microorganisms. Stringent conditions for cross-
reactivity testing were achieved by using a high concentration of the D3 DFA
Metapneumovirus Identification Kit Reagent and relatively high titers of
microorganisms. The D3 DFA Metapneumovirus Identification Kit Reagent was
prepared at 1.5X the concentration that is provided in the kit. No cross-reactivity
was observed for 59 virus strains or for 16 host culture cell types. Twenty-five
(25) bacterial strains, one yeast, three Chlamydia sp. and one protozoan were
evaluated for cross-reactivity, including Staphylococcus aureus, a protein-A-
producing bacterium. Except for Staphylococcus aureus, which was cross reactive
with the D3 DFA Metapneumovirus Identification Kit, all other microorganisms
tested negative. Staining of S. aureus appeared as small points of fluorescence.
The Protein A produced by the bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus, may bind the
Fc portion of some fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibodies. Such binding can
be distinguished from viral antigen binding on the basis of morphology, i.e., S.
aureus-bound fluorescence appears as small (~1-micron diameter), bright dots.
Results from cell cultures with bacterial contamination must, therefore, be
interpreted with caution. The following language was added to the “Limitations of
Procedure” section of the product insert to address this issue: “Light background
staining may occur with specimens contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus
strains containing large amounts of protein A. Protein A will bind to the Fc
portions of conjugated antibodies. Such binding can be distinguished from
viral antigen binding on the basis of morphology, for example, S. aureus-
bound fluorescence appears as small (~1 micron diameter), bright dots.
Therefore, results from cell cultures with bacterial contamination must be
interpreted with caution.”
• Fifty-nine (59) virus strains were tested for cross reactivity. Depending on the
particular virus, 71 to 714 TCID viruses were inoculated into shell vial or
50
multi-well plate cultures and incubated for 24 to 48 hours, to yield a 1+ to 4+
cytopathic effect, processed and stained with the 1.5X D3 DFA
Metapneumovirus Identification Kit Reagent according to the procedure as
detailed in the product insert. Stained cells were examined at 200X
magnification. No cross reactivity was observed for the viruses listed below:

(cid:131) Thirty (30) microorganisms, including 25 bacterial and one yeast cultures,
three Chlamydia sp. and one protozoan commercially available control slides
were tested for cross reactivity. Bacteria were cultured, processed as
suspensions, then spotted on microscope slides at CFUs (colony forming units)
ranging from 6.4 x 104to 2.93 x 107/well in a 10-uL dot, depending on the
bacterium, then stained with the 1.5X DFA Reagent according to the
procedure as detailed in the product insert. Stained cells were examined at
400X for cross reactivity. Concentrations for each bacterial organism cultured
by DHI for cross reactivity testing were determined from suspensions of the
bacteria in PBS by spectrophotometer according to McFarland standards of
levels 1.0 and 2.0 (equaling approximately 3.0 x 106 and 6.0 x 106 CFU per
mL). Slides were prepared with spots of 10-uL of the suspensions to give
either 3.0 x 104 or 6.0 x 104 per spot. At the same time, 1-mL of each
suspension was plated on an appropriate agar dish for colony confirmation.
According to the confirmation agar cultures, initial concentrations of the
bacterial organisms in the study ranged from 6.4 x 104 to 2.93 x 107 CFU/well.

Except for Staphylococcus aureus, which was cross reactive with the D3 DFA
Metapneumovirus Identification Kit Reagent, all other microorganisms tested
negative. Reactivity with Staphylococcus aureus is more than likely due to
binding the protein A produced by Staphylococcus aureus. Microorganisms

At the time of the DHI D3 DFA Metapneumovirus Identification Kit clinical
studies, there were no standard or FDA cleared methods to detect hMPV in
respiratory specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of acute
respiratory infection. For purposes of these studies, Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc
(DHI) established and validated a real-time Reverse Transcriptase (RT-PCR)
procedure for use as a comparative test method to detect hMPV RNA in a

specimen. This real time RT-PCR assay was developed by DHI using a primer
set and TaqMan probe as described in the publication: Maertzdorf, J., CK Wang,
JB Brown, JD Quinto, M Chu, M de Graff, BG van den Hoogen, R Spaete,
ADME Osterhaus, and RAM Fouchier. “Real-time Reverse Transcriptase PCR
Assay for Detection of Human Metapneumoviruses from All Known Lineages”
J. Clin. Microbiol. 2004:42:981-986. A nucleic acid (RNA) extraction procedure
was also developed and validated, as was the RT-PCR reaction,including primer
sets, and gel electrophoresis. Detection of an amplicon in the PCR end-product
is presumptive evidence of hMPV RNA presence in a specimen. The amplicons
were sequenced by a third party (Agencourt). DHI then compared these
sequences against an established/published set of hMPV sequences.
Confirmation of the hMPV RNA sequences in the amplicon was interpreted as
verification of hMPV RNA in the specimen.
Analytical Sensitivity
The analytical sensitivity of the hMPV real-time RT-PCR/Sequencing
Comparator Assay was determined for 4 hMPV strains (subtypes A1, A2, B1
and B2). Viral stocks of 4 hMPV strains (subtypes A1, A2, B1 and B2) were
generated in LLC-MK cultured cells. The viral stocks were frozen at -70° C.
2
The TCID /mL of each stock was determined by cell culture with monoclonal
50
antibody detection. A nasopharyngeal clinical matrix was created from
nasopharyngeal swabs placed in transport medium obtained from patients with
signs and symptoms of acute respiratory infection. The matrix was tested for the
presence of hMPV RNA using the hMPV real-time RT-PCR Comparator Assay.
Patient specimens found to be negative were pooled to create sufficient material
for all of the dilutions. The quantified viral stocks were diluted with the pooled
nasopharyngeal clinical matrix to produce a suspension equivalent to the
following TCID /mL levels: 1000, 500, 250, 100, 50, 10, 1, and 0.1. Each
50
TCID /mL level dilution was extracted 10 times (80 per hMPV strain) using the
50
Qiagen Viral RNA Mini Kit. The hMPV real-time RT-PCR/Sequencing
Comparator Assay was performed in singlet using 20-µL volumes of each
extraction. Analytical detection limits for each of the 4 hMPV genetic
sublineages were defined as the lowest dilutions at which at least 9 out of 10
replicates were detected. Detailed analytical sensitivity data for the hMPV real-
time RT-PCR/Sequencing Comparator Assay are presented in the following
table:

Extraction Efficiency
The extraction efficiency was determined by extracting serial 10-fold dilutions
of cRNA and comparing the actual copies of cRNA in the eluate versus the
calculated copies if 100% recovery. The actual copies of cRNA were obtained
from the qRT-PCR standard curve constructed by a serial dilution of un-
extracted cRNA standards. The extraction efficiency ranges from 25 to 40%.
The range was obtained from triplicate extractions repeated over 3 days.
Duplicate PCR reactions were performed on each dilution.
Detailed results of this study are presented in the following table:

testing direct respiratory specimens were established during prospective studies at 3
geographically diverse U.S. clinical laboratories during the 2005 and 2006
respiratory virus seasons (December 2005 – April 2006 and December 2006 –
March 2007). All specimens used in the studies meeting the inclusion and exclusion
criteria represented excess, remnants of respiratory specimens that were
prospectively collected from symptomatic individuals suspected of respiratory
infection, and were submitted for routine care or analysis by each site, and that
otherwise would have been discarded. Individual specimens were delinked from all
patient identifiers and given a study sample code. All clinical sites were granted
waivers of informed consent by their IRBs for this study.
Performance of the D3 DFA Metapneumovirus Identification Kit was assessed and
compared to a predetermined algorithm that used composite comparator methods at
clinical study site 1 and 2. The composite comparator methods consisted of viral
culture and a validated hMPV real-time RT-PCR followed by bi-directional
sequencing analysis comparator assay. The hMPV real-time RT-PCR comparator
assay targets the hMPV Nucleocapsid gene. “True” hMPV positive was defined as
any sample that either tested positive by viral culture, or had bi-directional

sequencing data meeting pre-defined quality acceptance criteria that matched hMPV
sequences deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
GenBank database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), with acceptable E-values. “True”
hMPV negative was defined as any sample that tested negative by both viral culture
and the hMPV real-time RT-PCR comparator assay.
Performance of the D3 DFA Metapneumovirus Identification Kit was evaluated and
compared to the same validated hMPV real-time RT-PCR followed by bi-directional
sequencing analysis comparator assay as described earlier, alone, at clinical study
site 3. Any sample that had bi-directional sequencing data meeting pre-defined
quality acceptance criteria that matched hMPV sequences deposited in the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank database
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), with acceptable E-values, was considered as hMPV
positive, and the real-time hMPV RT-PCR comparator assay negatives were
considered as hMPV negatives at this site.
The E-values generated from the clinical trials range from a low of 2e-77 to a high
of 2e-67. The E-Value from NCBI BLAST Alignment indicates the statistical
significance of a given pair-wise alignment and reflects the size of the database and
the scoring system used. The lower the E-Value, the more significant the hit. A
sequence alignment that has an E-Value of 1e-3 means that this similarity has a 1 in
1000 chance of occurring by chance alone.
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=handbook.section.614).
Therefore an E-Value ranging from 2e-67 to 2e-77 has a very low probability of
occurring purely by chance.
Study Site 1 evaluated a total of 1564 fresh respiratory specimens submitted,
December 2006 through March 2007, to the laboratory for respiratory virus testing.
Slides were prepared from Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)-washed cells from the
fresh specimens and fixed according to the prescribed protocol. The slides were
stained in accordance with the procedure in the product insert.

study site 3 was not assessed against the predetermined composite comparator
methods, positive and negative percent agreements, instead of sensitivity and
specificity, are used in the performance presentation.
b. Cultured Cells Testing
Performance characteristics of the DHI D3 DFA Metapneumovirus Identification Kit
testing cultured cell specimens were established during a prospective study at DHI
during the 2007 respiratory virus seasons (January 2008 – April). All specimens
used in the studies meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria represented excess,
remnants of respiratory specimens that were prospectively collected from
symptomatic individuals suspected of respiratory infection, and were submitted for
routine care or analysis by each collection site, and that otherwise would have been
discarded. Individual specimens were delinked from all patient identifiers and given
a study sample code.
Performance of the D3 DFA Metapneumovirus Identification Kit testing cultured
cell specimens was evaluated and compared to the same validated hMPV real-time
RT-PCR followed by bi-directional sequencing analysis comparator assay as
described earlier, at clinical study site 4. Any cultured cell specimens that had bi-
directional sequencing data meeting pre-defined quality acceptance criteria that
matched hMPV sequences deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) GenBank database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), with acceptable E-
values, was considered as hMPV positive. The real-time hMPV RT-PCR
comparator assay negative cultured cell specimens were considered as hMPV

The E-values generated from the clinical trials range from a low of 2e-77 to a high
of 2e-67. The E-Value from NCBI BLAST Alignment indicates the statistical
significance of a given pair-wise alignment and reflects the size of the database and
the scoring system used. The lower the E-Value the more significant the hit. A
sequence alignment that has an E-Value of 1e-3 means that this similarity has a 1 in

(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=handbook.section.614).
Therefore an E-Value ranging from 2e-67 to 2e-77 has a very low probability of
occurring purely by chance.
A total of 74 freeze-thawed nasopharyngeal swab specimens were cultured and

of hMPVobtained from the University of Iowa Emerging Pathogens Laboratory
located in Coralville, IA. The cell culture was incubated for 48-hours to amplify
the virus. Cell spots were prepared on glass slides as described in the D3 DFA

cultures at three concentration levels of infected cells (less than 10%, between 20
and 30%, and between 40 and 50%). The slides were sent to three outside
investigators where they were stained using the D3 DFA Metapneumovirus
Identification Kit and examined. Each investigator provided interpretations of test
results, i.e., presence or absence of fluorescent cells. Replicate prepared slides
were evaluated at DHI by staining and examining with an alternative non-labeled
murine monoclonal antibody (MAb-8) to hMPV strain MPV75-1998/CAN98-75,
which was developed at the CDC by standard methods. (Note: The MAb-8 is a
research use only device that has not been cleared by the FDA. However, there is
data presented in the literature addressing its specificity and sensitivity to hMPV:

Dean D., “Detection of Human Metapneumovirus in Clinical Samples by
Immunofluorescence Staining of Shell Vial Centrifugation Cultures Prepared from
Three Different Cell Lines”, J. Clin. Microbiol. 2005 43: 1950-1952.). DHI also
performed DHI hMPV RT-PCR/Sequencing Assay on each of the virus isolates to
verify their identities as hMPV.
The following table summarizes the data from the three external sites using the D3

In conclusion, the D3 DFA Metapneumovirus Identification Kit detected 98.7%
(74/75) of the suspensions expected to contain infected cells from cell culture. The
CDC MAb-8 reagent detected 100% (75/75) of the suspensions expected to
contain infected cells from cell culture. One suspension, which was hMPV strain
B2, was missed by the D3 DFA Metapneumovirus Identification Kit reagent. The
estimated infected level, as seen on the CDC MAb-8 stained suspension, was less
than 2% infected. It is probable that due to sampling issues, the D3 DFA
Metapneumovirus Identification Kit reagent-stained slide did not contain any
infected cells.
