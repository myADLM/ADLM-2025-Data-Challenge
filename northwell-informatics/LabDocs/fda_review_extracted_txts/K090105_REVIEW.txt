L. Test Principle:
The LupoTek KCT is an activated partial thromboplastin time reagent without any
added phospholipids and with kaolin as the contact activator. In the absence of added
phospholipid the assay only poorly accelerates the clotting cascade and is sensitive to
coagulopathies in the contact and common pathways.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision (repeatability) studies were conducted on three lots of LupoTek
KCT reagent, two runs per day over 20 days using a normal and an abnormal
(LA positive – k083878) quality control plasmas as described in CLSI
guideline EP5-A2. Acceptance criterion of ≤ 10%CV was met. The clotting
times for the first replicate obtained on a STA Compact and summary %CV
and 95% CI of the precision results were as follows:
Plasma Mean Clot Times Repeatability Total
(rep #1 - secs)
Normal 61.5 1.2% 2.2%
CI (1.0 – 1.6%) CI (1.9 – 2.6%)
Abnormal 256.9 3.1% 6.6%
(95% CI) CI (2.5 – 3.9%) CI (5.7 – 7.8%)
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The open vial stability of the LupoTek KCT reagent was assessed by
longitudinal studies of three lots on a Diagnostica Stago STart4 analyzer. The
recoveries of two control plasmas (normal and abnormal) were assessed at the
initial use of each kit and thereafter at periodic time points. The kit
components were stored capped when not in use and freshly reconstituted
control plasmas were prepared at each time point. Acceptance criteria were
an age-related trend and a maximum shift of ±10% of the zero point clotting
time to determine open vial stability of 24 hours when stored at room
temperature (23 – 25°C).
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies of LupoTek KCT were determined on an STA Compact.
Interferent was spiked into pooled normal plasma (PNP) and a dilution series
prepared. The maximum concentration tolerated in the assay was defined as
the highest concentration of interferent wherein any consistent shift relative to
the recovered value of the base PNP clotting time was less than 10%. The
maximum concentrations were hemoglobin 500 mg/dL, unconjugated
bilirubin 20 mg/dL, lipemia 2,000 mg/dL and heparin < 0.1 Units/mL.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 180 patients of known clinical status, including known lupus
anticoagulant patients were analyzed in three laboratories with a test lot of
KCT and with Phospholin ES, and an LA sensitive APTT reagent. Clinical
status for lupus anticoagulant was determined using the Stago hexagonal
phase phospholipid assay and several dilute Russell Viper Venom (dRVVT)
assays.
Each sample was scored as abnormal for either KCT or the APTT according
to their raw clotting times. Laboratory diagnosis was determined by testing
according to International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH)
guidelines and included two or more assays of different principles, one of
which demonstrates phospholipid dependence.
Each sample was classified in reference to the clinical status for LA provided
by the referring lab and tested for the LupoTek KCT neat clot times and the
predicate APTT clot times.
Each sample was also classified for agreement between KCT and the APTT.
Percent positive, percent negative and overall percent agreement in relation to
clinical status were calculated according to FDA guidance Statistical
Guidance on Reporting Results from Studies Evaluating Diagnostic Tests.
Agreement tables of summary data are reported by site and immediately
followed by the corresponding raw data agreement tables.

b. Matrix comparison:
Samples were obtained from 10 known LA positive patients and from 12
random patients sent to the coagulation laboratory. Each sample was tested
before and after freezing at -70°C. The difference between the fresh and
frozen samples was calculated and expressed in seconds and in percent of the
fresh value. The clot times were compared to the upper limit of the normal
range and evaluated for any change that would result in changing the
diagnosis between LA positive or LA negative. Data from two random
samples reported abnormal results for the freshly collected samples; however
frozen results were reported as normal. Sponsor noted that results were
borderline results, i.e., minimally outside the established normal and abnormal
ranges. Remaining study results indicate that change in clot times were not
significant enough to change the result status of the sample.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
To determine the normal reference range 131 healthy donors were tested with
LupoTek KCT on an STA Compact analyzer. The geometric mean and standard
deviations of the clotting times were calculated and the range was calculated as
the mean ± 2 SD. The mean was 70.0 seconds, with a 2SD range of 49.2 – 90.7
seconds. Each laboratory should establish its own reference range.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
