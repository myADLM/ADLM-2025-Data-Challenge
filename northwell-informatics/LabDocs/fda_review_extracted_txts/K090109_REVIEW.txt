For prescription use
4. Special instrument requirements:
epoc Card Reader, epoc Host
I. Device Description:
The epoc glucose test is being added as an additional sensor to the existing single use
test card that is used with the epoc Blood Analysis System. This test card is inserted
into the epoc Reader and all analytical steps are performed automatically. Patient and
user information may be entered into the mobile computing device (epoc Host) during
the automated analysis cycle.
The epoc Blood Analysis System is an in vitro analytical system comprising a
network of one or more epoc Readers designed to be used at the point of care (POC).
The readers accept an epoc single use test card containing a group of sensors that
perform diagnostic testing on whole blood. The blood test results are transmitted
wirelessly to an epoc Host, which displays and stores the test results.
The epoc System is intended for use by trained medical professionals as an in vitro
diagnostic device for the quantitative testing of samples of whole blood.
The test card panel configuration currently includes sensors for Sodium, Potassium,
Ionized Calcium, pH, pCO2, pO2 and Hematocrit. This submission adds Glucose to
this list of cleared tests.
To perform a blood test, a new test card is inserted into a card reader’s card slot with
white label face down. When fully inserted, the test card is automatically engaged in
the reader.
Changes to the epoc Blood Analysis System required to introduce the Glucose test
include:
• Developing a new Glucose sensor and adding it to the existing epoc test card,
which was already designed to accommodate additional sensors;
• Modifications to the existing EpocHost software application to accommodate the
new test;
• Labeling changes including indications for use for the Glucose test.

L. Test Principle:
The glucose sensor comprises an immobilized enzyme first layer coated onto a gold
electrode of the electrode module, with a diffusion barrier second layer.
The Epocal glucose electrode uses the enzyme glucose oxidase to convert glucose to
hydrogen peroxide, and then uses an amperometric sensor to detect the enzymatically
produced hydrogen peroxide. Peroxide detection is by redox mediated, horseradish
peroxidase catalyzed, reduction on a gold electrode.
The enzyme layer immobilized on the electrode is further over-coated by a diffusion
barrier layer whose composition and dimensions are selected to facilitate rapid
transport of oxygen to the oxidase enzyme and assure that the enzymatic reaction rate

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The reportable range of the assay, 20 to 700 mg/dL is supported by the
linearity study. This study was performed in-house using blood samples as
per CLSI EP6-A recommendations for evaluation of linearity. A total of nine
blood samples, with theoretical concentrations of 29, 83, 137, 212, 298, 406,
492, 578, 675 mg/dL were prepared from two pools of blood, which were
evaluated by comparison with in-house reference instruments with traceability
to NIST standards. Regression analysis was performed as per CLSI EP6-A.
The summary is given in the table below.
Slope Intercept R2 Range
Glu [mg/dL] 0.9996 0.64 0.9989 20-700
Another study was performed in-house on multiple whole blood samples with
Glucose values spanning the reportable range. Three types of samples were
considered, namely, normal hematocrit-normal venous blood pO2, normal
hematocrit– hypoxic venous blood and elevated hematocrit-normal venous
blood pO2. Linearity is reported versus two in-house standard whole blood
glucose methods with traceability to NIST standards.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The epoc System’s test card comprises an on-board calibration material. This
calibration fluid in the test card is prepared gravimetrically. Its concentration
is measured for each batch with in house secondary reference instruments.
Each reference instrument is calibrated with fluids having NIST traceable
glucose concentrations and periodically verified using NIST SRM 965B
serum based glucose solutions.
Stability is based on real time studies.
No controls available with assay. The manufacturer recommends using
commercially available controls to comply with federal, state and local
regulatory requirements that oversee the institution.

d. Detection limit:
The detection limit of 20 mg/dL for the epoc was verified by demonstrating
acceptable precision near 20 mg/dL as described above. A study was
conducted on whole blood samples at 20 ng/mL glucose using cards from four
different lots and testing over 100 cards/blood sample on 50 different readers.
The test was performed within 12 min for each sample. The observed %CV
was <5.2%.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed in-house on the epoc glucose sensor. In
each of these tests a whole blood specimen was aliquoted into two samples.
The test sample was spiked by addition of interferent, while the control
sample was spiked by the addition of the solvent of the interferent.
Anticoagulants:
• Citrate had no significant effect up to 15mM (441mg/dL), after which it
decreases the glucose reading by -0.28%/mMCitrate, i.e. -
0.01%/(mg/dLCitrate); therefore it is not recommended to use collection
devices containing citrate as additive.
• Na fluoride had no significant effect up to 10mM (42mg/dL), after which
it decreases the glucose reading by -0.1%/mMNaF, i.e. -
0.024%/(mg/dLNaF); therefore it is not recommended to use collection
devices containing Na fluoride as additive.
• Oxalate had no significant effect up to 20mM (128mg/dL), after which it
decreases the glucose reading by -0.29%/mMOxalate, i.e. -
0.045%/(mg/dLOxalate); therefore it is not recommended to use devices
tubes containing oxalate as additive.
• Iodide had no significant effect up to 28μM (0.47mg/dLKI), after which it
decreases the glucose reading by as much as (-0.16mg/dL)/μMI-, i.e. (-
9.5mg/dL)/(mg/dLKI). Iodide concentrations higher than 0.4mMI–
(6.7mMKI) will trigger iQC.
• Bromide had no significant effect up to 28mM (224mg/dLNaBr), after
which it decreases the glucose reading by (-0.23 mg/dL)/mMBr, i.e. (-
0.029mg/dL)/(mg/dLNaBr).
• N-acetyl cysteine had no significant effect up to 500μM (8mg/dL), after
which it will trigger iQC.
• L-cysteine had no significant effect up to 750μM (9mg/dL), after which it
will trigger iQC.
• Gallamine triethiodide (Flaxedil) had no significant effect up to 11μM
(1mg/dL), after which it decreases the glucose reading by (–
0.27mg/dL)/μMgallamine triethiodide, i.e. (–3mg/ dL)/(mg/dLgallamine
triethiodide).
• Thiocyanate had no significant effect up to 1mM (5.9mg/dLKSCN), after
which it decreases the glucose reading with -1.7%/mMSCN, i.e. (–
0.29mg/dL)/(mg/dLKSCN).

--- Page 9 ---
• Uric acid had no significant effect up to 700μM (11.8mg/dL), after which
it decreases the glucose reading by (-3.5mg/dL)/mMUric Acid, i.e. (–
0.21mg/dL)/(mg/dLUric Acid).
• Mannose had no significant effect up to 3.5mM (63mg/dL), after which it
will increase the glucose reading by +3.8%/mMMannose, i.e.
(+0.21%)/(mg/dLMannose).

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The applicant evaluated the performance of the new epoc tests on patient
specimens (capillary, arterial and venous) in clinical settings including at the
point of care. The reference instrument was the predicate device, i.e. iSTAT
Abbott Point of Care analyzers using CG8 cartridges and a Roche Hitachi
analyzer. Comparison testing to the predicate device was performed in two
locations: central lab and Hematology-Oncology-POC site. The testing was
performed by a phlebotomist who was part of the POC-coordination staff.

The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Effect of Hematocrit
Hematocrit effect was evaluated in six glucose level blood linearity studies
performed at four different hematocrit levels.
The hematocrit was evaluated by centrifugation using the micro-hematocrit
method. The reference mean glucose concentration was computed from the
average of at least two in house reference instruments with traceability to
NIST standards. The percent bias for each sample tested was within 10% of
the reference mean for each level and each level of glucose demonstrated
acceptable precision and there was no correlation between the glucose result
and the hematocrit.
The summary is presented in the Table below. Each sample was tested on 6
cards, i.e. duplicates from 3 different lots and each individual sample fell
within 10% of the reference mean:
