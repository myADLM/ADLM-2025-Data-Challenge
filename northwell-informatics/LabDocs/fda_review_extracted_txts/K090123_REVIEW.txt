L. Test Principle:
The Neonatal Biotinidase kit is based on a semi-quantitative fluorometric assay. A
schematic presentation of the BTD enzymatic reaction is shown below.
Biotinidase
biotin 6-AQ 6-AQ* + biotin
* Fluorescent product
BTD is found in the blood sample itself. Filter paper disks from newborn DBS
samples, calibrators and controls are punched into the wells of a microplate. When
biotin substrate reagent containing biotin 6-aminoquinoline (6-AQ) is added to a well
containing a punched DBS, the reagent extracts and reconstitutes the proteins and
enzymes in the spot. The BTD enzyme in the sample cleaves the substrate to biotin
and fluorescent 6-AQ. The addition of the ethanol stops the reaction and precipitates
the proteins to cover the bottom of the well and the extracted spot. The fluorescent
product (6-AQ) formed during the reaction is measured with a fluorometer. The BTD
activity of the sample is determined by comparing the fluorescence intensity of the
sample to a calibration curve. The measurement is expressed as U. 1 U = 1 nmol of
the end-product that is formed during one minute and in one deciliter of blood (1
nmol/min/dL).

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the proposed device was determined according to CLSI EP5-
A2. The variation of the assay was determined using DBS samples with 6
different activity levels, 3 kit lots, 3 instruments, and 3 operators. The study
was performed on 20 separate measurement days. Each run included 4
replicates per sample level. A nested, balanced random effects analysis of
variance (ANOVA) was used to calculate the estimates of precision. The
results are summarized below:

287 108 217 358 21 7.4 30 11 35 12
* Within lot variation consists of within run, between run, between day,
between instrument, and between operators.
As part of the precision study, the kit quality control (QC) materials were
assayed for run acceptance and the sponsor calculated the variance in
precision. The results are summarized below:
Kit QC material n Mean (U) Within Run Variation Within Lot Variation
SD CV % SD CV %
Normal 108 267 21 7.8 26 9.8
Abnormal 108 55 5.1 9.2 5.3 9.7
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity was determined in accordance with CLSI EP6-A. A regression
analysis was performed with DBS samples ranging from 13.8 to 390 U. The
fitted regression model is: y = 0.998x – 0.66 (r2 = 0.999) where:
y = observed BTD activity
x = expected observed BTD activity
The sponsor concluded that the assay is linear from 16 U to 390 U. The
claimed measuring range is 16 U up to the highest calibrator (nominal value
approximately 350 U).

The package insert includes the following recommendations:
• Samples that result in values below 16 U are recommended to be re-
assayed as duplicates. If the values are still below the limit of detection,
they are recommended to be reported as "< 16 U". The result should be
considered positive [for biotinidase deficiency].
• Sample values above the measuring range are reported as the activity of
the highest calibrator of the kit. These samples should be considered
negative [for biotinidase deficiency]. To accurately quantitate values
above the calibration curve, another method should be used.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There is no international reference preparation or reference method for BTD.
The Neonatal Biotinidase Kits are traceable to commercially available 6-AQ.
The BTD activity is assigned to the units using synthetically prepared reagent,
6-AQ (reaction end-product), as the gravimetric standard. The purity of the 6-
AQ reagent is analyzed using quantitative 1H-NMR.
Calibrators are prepared from porcine whole blood with a preservative spotted
onto filter paper. Kit quality control materials are prepared from human blood
(hematocrit adjusted to 55%) with a preservative spotted onto filter paper.
Value Assignment: Each level of control and calibrator material is assayed
multiple times on multiple fluorometers. The mean of the data obtained is
calculated and presented in the quality control certificates for the calibrators
and controls. The secondary calibrators (which are value assigned against the
primary calibrators) are used to value assign the kit controls and calibrators.
The SD presented for the controls is taken from the precision study performed
to characterize the assay’s precision.
Real-time stability including shelf-life, transport, and in-use stability studies
for the entire kit were performed, including the controls and calibrators.
Additionally, accelerated stability studies were performed separately for the
kit calibrators and controls.
The shelf life of the kit (including calibrators and controls) is 18 months when
stored at -16 to -30 ºC. Once opened, the calibrators and controls are stable
for one month when stored at 2 to 8 ºC.
d. Detection limit:
The limits of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) were determined
according to CLSI EP17-A.
For the LoB, 180 measurements were carried out using 5 analyte-free DBS
samples on filter paper. The limit of blank (LoB) was determined as the 95th
percentile of the ranked results. The LoB of the assay is 12 U.
6

--- Page 7 ---
For the LoD, 48 measurements were carried out on each of 8 low level
samples (DBS samples on filter paper). The LoD was defined as the lowest
sample data where less than 5% of the values were below the LoB. The LoD
of the assay is 16 U. The CV % at this level was < 10%.
e. Analytical specificity:
The proposed device was evaluated for interference in accordance with CLSI
document EP7-A2. Whole blood pools with approximate target BTD
activities of 20, 55, 80 and 160 U were used in the studies. The potential
interfering compounds were added to the one set of blood pools to create the
test pools. Solvent only was added to the other set of blood pools to create the
control pools. The test and control pools were used to prepare DBS samples
on filter paper. The following potential interfering compounds were
evaluated:

in the misclassification of a patient with a biotinidase result near the cut-
off value as ‘normal’ when in fact, the patient should be classified as
‘deficient’. A patient with known or clinically suspected elevated blood
albumin concentration should be screened with an alternative method and
confirmed according to local requirements for follow-up testing.
Limitations: These statements were included under “limitations of the assay”
and in the “interference” section of the product insert.
• Kanamycin sulphate, glutathione, sulfamethoxazole, sulfisoxazole, and
trimethoprim can interfere with this test by increasing biotinidase activity.
This could result in the misclassification of a patient with a biotinidase
result near the cut-off value as ‘normal’ when in fact, the patient should be
classified as ‘deficient’. Patients or mothers known to have received
kanamycin sulphate, glutathione, sulfamethoxazole, sulfisoxazole or
trimethoprim should be screened with an alternative method and
confirmed according to local requirements for follow-up testing.
• Gammaglobulin (1.8 g/dL at biotinidase activity level of 55 U and 1.5
g/dL at biotinidase activity levels of 80 U and 160 U) caused a decrease in
biotinidase activity. This could result in a false positive result (biotinidase
deficient) in normal patients with biotinidase values near the cut-off
value. However no interference was observed with gammaglobulin (6
g/dL) at a biotinidase activity level of 20 U.
• Triglycerides (Intralipid at 150 mg/dL for biotinidase activity levels of 55
U and 80 U, 300 mg/dL at biotinidase activity of 20 U and 400 mg/dL at
biotinidase activity of 160 U) caused a decrease in biotinidase activity.
This could result in a false positive result (biotinidase deficient) in normal
patients with biotinidase values near the cut-off value.
• Biotin (500 ng/dL) at biotinidase activity level of 55 U caused a decrease
in biotinidase activity. This could result in a false positive result
(biotinidase deficient) in normal patients with biotinidase values near the
cut-off value.
• Ampicillin (0.56 mg/dL), penicillin G potassium (18.75 mg/dL), sodium
phenobarbital (5.5 mg/dL) and phenytoin (1.88 mg/dL) at biotinidase
activity level of 160 U caused an increase in response, whereas no
interference was observed at biotinidase levels of 20 U, 55 U and 80 U.
• Valproic acid (25 mg/dL) at biotinidase activity levels of 80 U and 160 U
caused an increase in response, whereas no interference was observed at
biotinidase activity levels of 20 U and 55 U.
Statement: This statement was included in the “interference” section of the
product insert.
• The following substances were found not to interfere at the concentrations
indicated; adreno-corticotropic hormone (15 ng/dL), ampicillin (2.8
mg/dL for biotinidase activities of 20 U, 55 U and 80 U), ascorbic acid (3

f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable. See clinical cut-off in 4. below.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Studies were performed according to CLSI EP9-A2. The samples used in the
study included 1516 newborn DBS specimens representing the US population
analyzed as singlicates with the proposed device and with a commercially
available assay. The samples consisted of 1496 routine screening specimens
and 20 retrospective specimens diagnosed positive for BTD deficiency. The
cut-offs were determined according to each method’s respective labeling (30
% of the mean ± 2 SD for the proposed device and 37% of the mean for the
predicate).
Method comparison data (1516 samples) with the routine and known positive
samples. The routine samples are illustrated with (o) and the known positive
samples with ((cid:86)). The labeling cut-offs are presented with solid lines.

b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable. The device should only be used with neonatal whole blood
spotted on filter paper obtained from heel prick.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
BTD deficiency is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. A newborn with
profound BTD deficiency is homozygous and usually has enzyme activity that is
less than 10% of the average of the normal population and sometimes there is
almost no activity at all. Newborns classified as having partial BTD deficiency
are heterozygous and have intermediate levels of BTD activity, typically 10 –
30% of normal.
The proposed device was not designed to differentiate between partial and
profound BTD deficiency. Therefore, the device has one cut-off that
differentiates between ‘normal’ and ‘deficient’. The cut-off of the proposed
device determined in the submission and recommended in the package insert is 30
% of the mean of the distribution of BTD activity of a normal newborn population
± 2 SD.

The package insert states that samples with BTD activities below the chosen cut-
off should be considered as presumptive positive. These samples should be
reanalyzed with a different method and confirmed according to local requirements
for follow-up testing.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The distribution of BTD activity of a normal newborn population (USA) was
established using the proposed device by determining the BTD activity of 1496
routine newborn specimens in a neonatal screening laboratory. The following
descriptive statistics and percentile cut-offs are included in the package insert:
Activity n Range Mean Median Lower percentiles
0.1% 0.2% 0.5% 1% 2%
Proposed (U) 1496 31.5 - 388 163.8 160.9 60.4 62.4 70.6 77.8 85.9
The package insert includes precautionary language that each laboratory should
establish its own cut-off values and that cut-offs based on data collected with any
other BTD assay should not be used.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
