L. Test Principle:
The FORA G30 Blood Glucose Monitoring System uses electrochemical methodologies. The
system quantitatively measures blood glucose level using an amperometric method, which
involves detecting the current produced from glucose oxidation. The electrons generated
during this reaction are transferred from the blood to the electrodes. The magnitude of the
resultant current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the specimen and the
signal is converted into a readout displayed on the meter.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor’s precision studies were based on ISO 15197 and CLSI EP5-A
recommendations. The within-run precision study samples used were venous blood
(hematocrit range 38% - 54%) spiked with dextrose to create 5 levels of blood
glucose. Three lots of test strips and 10 meters were used in the study, with 10 tests
performed on each meter for a total of 100 tests per blood glucose level.
The results are as follows:
Standard
Coefficient of
Samples No. of Tests Average (mg/dL) Deviation
Variation (%)
(mg/dL)
Level 1 100 42.7 1.76 4.11
Level 2 100 78.9 3.23 4.10
Level 3 100 152.2 3.54 2.33
Level 4 100 203.8 4.63 2.27
Level 5 100 305.7 7.13 2.33
The day-to-day run precision study samples used were glucose control solutions.
Low, medium, and high levels were used. Three lots of test strips and 10 meters were
used in the study, with 1 test performed on each meter per day for 10 days, for a total
of 100 tests per control level.
The results are as follows:
Standard
Coefficient of
Samples No. of Tests Average (mg/dL) Deviation
Variation (%)
(mg/dL)
Low Control 300 82.7 2.51 3.04
Medium Control 300 145.1 3.09 2.13
High Control 300 334.9 5.40 1.61
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor indicated that the linearity study protocol was developed according to
CLSI EP6-A. The candidate device was tested to verify linearity of the system using
blood samples with glucose concentrations between 20-600 mg/dL. Venous blood
samples were used. Samples were spiked with dextrose in order to create nine
glucose levels (20, 40, 60, 90, 120, 200, 320, 420, 600 mg/dL). Testing was
performed using the FORA G30 meter (candidate device) and the YSI-2300 glucose

The results are as follows:
Linear Regression Correlation coefficient (R2)
y = 0.9819x + 1.9316 0.9997
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The FORA G30 system (including meter and test strips) has an operating
environment of 10 – 40oC and relative humidity below 85%. Performance testing
supports this range. The system was also tested in extreme conditions to determine if
it could operate correctly in its indicated range after being exposed to harsher
conditions. Temperature exposure limits of the system were determined to be -20 –
60oC, and humidity exposure limits of 5 - 95% relative humidity. Drop tests and
vibration tests were also performed on the device.
Test strips were examined using accelerated stability studies to determine unopened
shelf life. The sponsor currently has real time stability testing to support unopened
shelf life of the test strips for 12 months when stored between 4 – 40oC. In-use
stability of the test strips is 90 days after the first opening.
In-use stability of the glucose control solution (cleared under k041107) is 90 days
after the first opening when stored between 2 – 30oC.
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the system is 20 - 600 mg/dL. This range was verified by the
linearity study (see section M.1.b.).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference Study:
The sponsor indicated that the interference study protocol was developed according to
CLSI EP7-A. Blood samples were collected in an anti-coagulant (Li-EDTA) vacuum
tube from seven volunteers, and glucose levels were adjusted to a low (75-85 mg/dL)
and a high (300 mg/dL) level using the YSI 2300 as a reference instrument. The
percent bias caused by various interferences must be less than ± 10%. Interferents
causing a bias greater than 10% are examined using a dose-response test to
interpolate the concentration at which 10% bias would be observed.
The results are as follows:

Altitude Study:
An altitude study was performed on a mountain in Wuling, Taiwan with an elevation
of 10,744 ft. The capillary blood glucose results of 20 volunteers were tested using
the FORA G30 meter at high altitude and compared to the Roche Accu-Chek meter at
high altitude. The results of this study are acceptable: 95% of the measurements
must have a deviation less than 20% at ≥ 75 mg/dL and less than 15 mg/dL at < 75
mg/dL.
Hematocrit Study:
To test accuracy due to the hematocrit effect, venous blood samples were collected in
an anti-coagulant (Li-EDTA) vacuum tube, and glucose levels were adjusted to the
following ranges; 40-60 mg/dL, 70-120 mg/dL, 120-200 mg/dL, 240-280 mg/dL, and
420-440 mg/dL and 480-520 mg/dL. Samples were then adjusted to hematocrit levels
of 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, and 60%. The YSI 2300 was used as the reference method.
The results of the hematocrit study were reviewed and found to be acceptable.

vs. YSI-2300
A Clarke error grid analysis was also presented; 99% (121/122) of results fall in zone
A – clinically accurate. 1% (1/122) fall in zone B - deviating from the reference
method by more than 20% but would lead to benign or no treatment. These results
are the same for both the FORA G30 and the Clever Chek TD-4230.
Alternate Site Testing Comparison:
This study was performed in accordance with NCCLS EP9-A and ISO 15197. 120
lay users at 3 different locations tested themselves using each alternate site with the
FORA G30 blood glucose meter. Lay users were given the user manual in English,
and were given no additional instructions. The lay user then obtained a fingertip
blood sample, and the fingertip glucose result was compared to the AST glucose
result.
