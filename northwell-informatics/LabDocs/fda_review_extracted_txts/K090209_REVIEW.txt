L. Test Principle:
The HemosIL Liquid Heparin assay is a one stage chromogenic assay based on a
synthetic chromogenic substrate and on Factor Xa inactivation. Heparin is analyzed
as a complex with antithrombin. Antithrombin present in the plasma forms an
[AT⋅heparin] complex. The concentration of this complex is dependent on the
availability of the patient’s endogenous antithrombin. When FXa and FXa specific
chromogenic substrate is added to patient sample, two competing reactions occur
simultaneously: a) inhibition of FXa by the [AT⋅heparin] complex, and b) reaction of
residual FXa with the chromogenic substrate resulting in cleavage of para-nitroaniline
(pNA). The released pNA is measured at 405nm and is inversely proportional to the

AT level present in the test plasma.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The low and high levels of the HemosIL LMW and UF Heparin Controls were
run for 20days, 2 runs per day, 2 replicates per run (N=80). The ACL Elite,
ACL Futura, and the ACL TOP were used for testing. Results demonstrated
%CV for the UF Heparin of <7%, and %CV for LMW Heparin Controls <6%
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Assay linearity was determined using the WHO International LMW Heparin
Standard, the WHO International UF Heparin Standard, and Normal pooled
plasma. The standards and pooled plasma were mixed and diluted to 5 levels
ranging from 0 to 2.2 IU/mL. Each dilution level was analyzed in triplicate on
representative instruments using HemosIL Liquid Heparin reagents and the
mean result was plotted against the expected values. Testing was preformed
on the ACL Elite, ACL Advance, and ACL TOP and demonstrated acceptable
linearity of up to 2.0 IU/mL for all instruments.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Each lot of UF Heparin Controls is traceable to the 5th International WHO
Standard 97/578 for UF heparin and each lot of LMW Heparin Controls is
traceable to the 2nd International WHO Standard 01/608 for LMW Heparin.
Each lot of calibrator is traceable to the 5th International WHO Standard
97/578 for UF heparin and the 2nd International WHO Standard 01/608 for
LMW heparin.
A real-time stability study was performed using three lots of kit reagents,
calibrators and controls. Reagents were tested at time zero and stored at 2-
8°C. At 4, 7, 11, 14, 18, and 21 months the LMW and UF controls were
tested in quadruplicate on an ACL TOP using the stored reagents and
calibrators, and the mean results compared to the mean result at time zero.
Data supported the real-time stability claim of 21 months.
d. Detection limit:
Detection Limit was determined by running 20 replicates of the zero calibrator
on representative instruments (ACL Elite, ACL Futura, and the ACL TOP)
using HemosIL liquid Heparin reagents. Testing was performed on the ACL
9000 (representing the ACL 8000/9000/10000/Elite/Elite Pro family of
instruments), ACL Advance representing the ACL Futura/ ACL Advance
family), and the ACL TOP (representing the ACL TOP family). Detection
limit was determined to be Mean (n=20) – 3SD.
System Limit
ACL 8000/9000/10000/Elite/Elite Pro 0.04 IU/mL
ACL Futura/ACL Advance 0.02 IU/mL
ACL TOP Family 0.04 IU/mL

ACL Futura/ACL Advance	0.02 IU/mL
ACL TOP Family	0.04 IU/mL

e. Analytical specificity:
Assay specificity was assessed by testing hemoglobin, bilirubin, and
triglycerides. For each substance, the controls were spiked with multiple
levels of the indicated interferant. Each interferant level was tested in
triplicate and the mean results compared to the unspiked control result.
Testing was performed on the ACL Elite, ACL Advance, and ACL TOP and
demonstrated no significant interference by hemoglobin up to 300 mg/dL,
bilirubin up to 20 mg/dL, and triglycerides up to 800 mg/dL.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
HemosIL Liquid Heparin Assay was compared to the predicate at 3 sites (2
external, 1 internal) using several IL coagulation platforms. The internal site
used samples sourced from CliniSys in Atlanta, GA, and Lahey Clinic in
Burlington, MA. The clinical sites used samples from patients undergoing
heparin therapy.
Internal site
Testing took place on the ACL ELITE, ACL Advance, and the ACL TOP.
