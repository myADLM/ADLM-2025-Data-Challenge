LOJ Kit, Test, Alpha-fetoprotein for testicular cancer
4. Panel:
Immunology (82)
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Dimension Vista® AFP Method: The AFP method is an in vitro diagnostic test for
the quantitative measurement of alpha-fetoprotein in human serum and lithium
heparinized plasma on the Dimension Vista® system. Measurements of alpha-
fetoprotein are used as an aid in managing non-seminomatous testicular cancer
when used in conjunction with physical examination, histology/pathology and
other clinical evaluation procedures.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as above
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Dimension Vista® System
I. Device Description:
The Dimension Vista® AFP method consists of two synthetic bead reagents and a
biotinylated murine-anti-AFP antibody. The first bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated
with an anti-AFP monoclonal antibody and contains a chemiluminescent dye. The
second bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains a
photosensitizer dye. All are supplied in liquid format in a reagent cartridge.

L. Test Principle:
The Dimension Vista® AFP method is a homogeneous, sandwich chemiluminescent
immunoassay based on LOCI® technology. The LOCI® reagents include two
synthetic bead reagents and a biotinylated anti-AFP monoclonal antibody fragment.
The first bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with an anti-AFP monoclonal antibody
and contains chemiluminescent dye. The second bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated
with streptavidin and contains a photosensitizer dye. Sample is incubated with
biotinylated antibody and Chemibeads to form bead-AFP-biotinylated antibody
sandwiches. Sensibeads are added and bind to the biotin to form bead-pair
immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at 680 nm generates singlet oxygen
from Sensibeads which diffuses into the Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent
reaction. The resulting signal is measured at 612 nm and is a direct function of the

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
In addition to the original precision results using serum samples, a precision
study using a lithium heparinized plasma pool sample was conducted in
accordance with the CLSI EP5-A2 Approved Guideline for Evaluation of
Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods.
Material Mean SD (%CV) SD (%CV)
ng/mL Repeatability Within-Lab
Plasma Pool 249.0 2.9 (1.2) 5.1 (2.0)
To determine the precision at the lower end of the assay range, the sponsor
provided data from a 5-day precision study using a lithium heparinized plasma
pool sample with 8 ng/mL AFP. The results are summarized below.
Material Mean SD (%CV) SD (%CV)
ng/mL Repeatability Within-Lab
Plasma Pool 7.5 0.08 (1.0) 0.13 (1.7)
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Same as k071597
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Same as k071597
d. Detection limit:

e. Analytical specificity:
Same as k071597
f. Assay cut-off:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable.
b. Matrix comparison:
Matched serum and lithium (Li) heparinized plasma samples (N=70),
were collected from patients and immediately frozen at -20°C. All samples
were tested within 60 days from the date of collection. On the date of
testing, serum and Li heparinized plasma samples were thawed at 20 - 25°C
for 30 minutes and the AFP values were determined with the Dimension
Vista® AFP assay. Samples above the assay range (0.5-1000 ng/mL) were
manually diluted with matched normal human serum and Li heparinized
plasma. Samples were run in triplicate. AFP recovery in serum versus Li
heparinized plasma was compared by Passing & Bablok regression analysis.
