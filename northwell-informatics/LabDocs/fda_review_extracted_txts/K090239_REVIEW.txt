I. Device Description:
The ProGastro Cd Assay detects toxigenic Clostridium difficile and an Internal
Control by a process of nucleic acid extraction from patient specimens followed by
PCR amplification and detection. Following collection of a soft or liquid stool
sample from a symptomatic patient, a portion of the sample is diluted in Stool
Transport and Recovery (S.T.A.R.) Buffer and the solids separated via centrifugation
(Stool Clarification). The Internal Control is added to the sample prior to extraction
to monitor for PCR inhibitors that may be present. The nucleic acids from the sample
are extracted and purified using the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG automated
extractor. Nucleic acids are added to the C. diff Mix for subsequent PCR
amplification and detection using the Cepheid
SmartCycler II.
The C. diff Mix contains oligonucleotide primers and probes that target the tcdB gene
of toxigenic strains of C. diff. The probes are dual-labeled with a reporter dye
attached to the 5’-end and a quencher dye attached to the 3’-end (see table below).
During PCR amplification the primers and probes anneal to the template (if present)
followed by primer extension and template amplification. The 5’-3’ exonuclease
activity of the Taq polymerase cleaves the probe thus separating the reporter dye from
the quencher and generating an increase in fluorescent signal. The amount of
fluorescence at any given cycle is dependent on the amount of amplification product
present. The SmartCycler II instrument and software monitors the process, interprets
the data, and presents a report upon completion.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Expected Values
The prevalence of C. difficile Infection can vary between institutions. Variables that
affect the frequency of the disease are patient population, type of institution and
epidemiology. C. difficile is responsible for approximately 20% of all cases of antibiotic
associated diarrhea and the overall incidence of disease is approximately 0.1 - 2% among
all hospitalized patients1. In the ProGastro Cd multicenter prospective study, the
prevalence among symptomatic patients varied from 10.4% to 15.8% by site and
averaged 13.4% overall. The number and percentage of C. diff positive cases determined
by the ProGastro Cd Assay during this study, stratified by patient age group, are
presented in the following table:

Clinical Performance
Performance characteristics of the ProGastro Cd Assay were established during a
prospective study at three U.S. clinical laboratories from July through October 2008.
Samples used for this study were leftover raw stool specimens that were collected for
routine Clostridium difficile testing from patients over two years of age by each site. The
reference method was tissue culture cytotoxin assay (CTA). Demographic details for this
patient population are summarized in the following table:

Reproducibility
The reproducibility of the ProGastro Cd Assay was evaluated at three laboratory sites.
Reproducibility was assessed using a panel of six simulated samples that included
medium positive, low positive (near the assay limit of detection,
≥ 95% positive) and “high negative” (< 5% positive) samples. Panels and controls were
tested at each site by two operators for five days (6 samples and 4 controls and 2
operators for 5 days at 3 sites = 300). The overall percent agreement with the expected
result for the ProGastro Cd Assay was 99.0%.

An additional reproducibility study was performed to assess samples that were at an
intermediate concentration, below the assay’s LoD but above the “high negatives” tested
during the original reproducibility study. The percent positive for the intermediate
member across all sites was 42.2%. This result was expected as the intermediate
concentration should be positive in the range of 5 - 95% and the samples were lower in
concentration than the LoD concentration (≥ 95% positive) and higher than the “high

Analytical Sensitivity
The analytical sensitivity (limit of detection or LoD) of the ProGastro Cd Assay was
determined using 10-fold serial dilutions of two C. diff strains that were spiked into raw
stool and processed according to the Instructions for Use. The LoD concentration of each
bacterial strain was confirmed by extracting and testing 20 replicates. Portions of the
same serial dilutions were cultured and quantified in units of CFU/mL and used to
determine CFU/reaction. Analytical sensitivity (LoD) was defined as the lowest
concentration at which ≥ 95% of all replicates tested positive.

In addition, the analytical sensitivity was determined using quantified genomic DNA that

sensitivity of the ProGastro Cd Assay is 5 genomic copies/reaction.

Reactivity
In addition to the strains used in the Analytical Sensitivity (LoD) Study, an additional 35
well characterized isolates representing at least 25 different strains, five different
toxinotypes, nine different restriction enzyme analysis (REA) types, five different
serogroups, and three different ribotypes were used to evaluate the reactivity of the
ProGastro Cd Assay. The strains were tested in triplicate at a concentration of 3
times each strain's LoD and all strains were reactive with the ProGastro Cd Assay.
Analytical Specificity
The analytical specificity of the ProGastro Cd Assay was evaluated by testing a panel of
50 cultures consisting of 41 bacteria, 8 viruses, and one yeast strain representing common
gastrointestinal pathogens or microorganisms. Bacteria and yeast were tested at
concentrations of 1.35 x 108 organisms/mL. Viruses were tested at concentrations of
103.5 to 106.5 TCID /mL. The cultures were spiked with Internal Control and were

* Higher concentrations of Clostridium sordellii exhibited inhibition of the Internal Control. No cross-reaction in the
FAM channel was observed at 0.45 McFarland.
** Cultured and titered Norovirus was unavailable; nucleic acids from a positive clinical sample (Milwaukee Public
Health Lab Real Time PCR assay with a C value = 20.5) were tested.
T
Interference
Blood, mucin, fecal fats, over the counter and prescription medicines (Kaopectate,
Immodium AD, Pepto Bismol, Vancomycin, and Metronidazole) and a radiological
contrast agent (barium sulfate) were spiked into aliquots of a raw fecal pool along
with one cultured and titered strain of C. difficile (C. diff). C. diff was spiked in at a
concentration of 2 times the assay’s Limit of Detection (LoD). Clinically relevant
amounts of the potential inhibiting substances were added to spiked samples.
Samples were clarified and spiked with the Internal DNA Control (IC). Nucleic acid
from the samples was extracted with the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG. The
nucleic acids were tested in triplicate reactions with ProGastro Cd on the Cepheid
SmartCycler II. The following table shows the potential interfering substances used
for this study.

None of the potentially interfering exogenous or endogenous substances interfered with
detection of C. diff at a concentration near the LoD of the ProGastro Cd Assay.
Carry-over/Cross-contamination
To evaluate the level of carry-over/cross-contamination with the ProGastro Cd Assay,
simulated Clostridium difficile (C. diff) high positive samples run in series alternating
with C. diff high negative samples were tested over five separate extraction and PCR
runs. High Positive samples represented the upper range of Ct values obtained in the
ProGastro Cd clinical trials (lowest Ct = 25.4). High Negative samples consisted of
negative stool spiked with a concentration of C. diff below but near the analytical LoD
concentration such that > 95% of samples should be negative. The samples were
processed and extracted in a “High Positive/High Negative” alternating fashion on the
bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG and likewise processed and run on the Cepheid
SmartCycler II instrument in an alternating fashion. Three out of fifty-five high negative
samples tested showed potential C. diff contamination. Due to the fact that the high
negative samples did include a low amount of C. diff that is detectable no more than 5%
of the time, it cannot be ruled out that these results may actually fall in this category.
Potential contamination could have occurred during sample preparation, during
extraction, during transferring of the purified nucleic acid from the sample vessel into the
microfuge tube, or during preparation of the PCR reactions.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
