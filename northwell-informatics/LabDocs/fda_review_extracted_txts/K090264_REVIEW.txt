Dimer HS 500 Latex Reagent is a suspension of polystyrene latex particles of
uniform size coated with the F(ab’)2 fragment of a monoclonal antibody highly
specific for the D-Dimer domain included in fibrin soluble derivatives. The use of
the F(ab’)2 fragment allows a more specific D-Dimer detection avoiding the
interference of some endogenous factors like Rheumatoid Factor. The calibrator is
packaged with the kit and is the exact same product already marketed with the
HemosIL D-Dimer HS (k070927).
HemosIL D-Dimer HS 500 Controls: The Low and High D-Dimer HS 500 Controls
are prepared to contain different concentrations of partially purified D-Dimer
obtained by digestions of Factor XIIIa cross-linked human fibrin with human
plasmin. Controls are sold separately and are the same product originally submitted
with the HemosIL D-Dimer assay under k972696 (also marketed with HemosIL D-
Dimer HS (k070927)).

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing was assessed using EP05-A2 for total (within-device) and
within-run (repeatability) over multiple runs using two levels of HemosIL D-
Dimer HS 500 Controls (low and high) and an internally prepared low D-
Dimer plasma pool near the cut-off on the ACL TOP instrument. Precision
was performed on two replicates per run, two runs per day for 20 days (n = 80
for each sample level) on two different ACL TOP instruments. The
acceptance criteria for within-run precision of the Low Control, High Control
and Low Plasma Pool was ≤ 6%, ≤ 6%, and ≤ 10% CV respectively. The
acceptance criteria for total precision of the Low Control, High Control and
Low Plasma Pool was ≤ 10%, ≤ 10%, and ≤ 12% CV respectively. All results
were within acceptable limits.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linear range of the assay is 215 – 128000 ng/mL with Auto Rerun.
Linearity was assessed based on two studies that cover overlapping ranges:
359-7650 and 1202-320402 ng/mL. To demonstrate that the separate linearity
studies support the claim across the range, the two data sets were combined.
Studies were performed on the ACL TOP instrument with two reagent lots
and the Auto Rerun feature deactivated. Dilutions of HemosIL D-Dimer HS
500 Calibrator were prepared in saline containing BSA to achieve selected
concentrations and each level tested in triplicate. Both reagent lots met
acceptance criteria of ± 15% inaccuracy.
Linearity was also assessed on the ACL TOP with the Auto Rerun feature
activated on two reagent lots. Dilutions of internally prepared prozone control
(concentration 320402 ng/mL) was diluted in saline containing BSA to
achieve selected concentrations and each level tested in triplicate. Both
reagent lots met acceptance criteria of ± 15% inaccuracy.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Value assignment of the controls was assessed on two QC approved batches
of HemosIL D-Dimer HS 500 reagents (with their corresponding calibrators)

and one representative ACL TOP instrument. Each control is analyzed with
two lots of reagent and two calibrations per reagent. Controls are tested 10
times in singlicate and the mean and standard deviation is calculated. Values
outside the mean ± 20% are eliminated and the means recalculated. As a
maximum, one discarded value per reagent lot and calibration is acceptable.
The HemosIL D-Dimer HS 500 assay is calibrated using the calibrator
included in the kit. Calibrator value assignment is assessed from dilutions of
new calibrator and reconstituted vials of house standard. For the new batch of
calibrator, the minimum number of obtained values has to be 40 and a
minimum of 20 values for the house standard. Individual values are
multiplied by the corresponding dilution factor and the mean values
calculated. Values outside the mean ± 10% are eliminated and the means
recalculated. The value of new calibrator is calculated versus the
concentration of house standard.
Shelf-life stability at 2 – 8°C is ongoing using three different lots of HemosIL
D-Dimer HS 500 reagents. Results to date support a shelf-life of 21 months.
The reagent is considered stable at the labeled storage temperature until one of
the following criteria is not fulfilled on two consecutive test days:
a) A correct calibration curve cannot be obtained:
• Highest calibrator response is outside ± 25% of the initial day
• The calibrator dilution level 6.25% is < 5 mAU/min
b) The reported values for the controls are outside the target value by ±
25% for the Low Control and by ± 20% for the High Control
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Detection and Limits of Quantification were assessed using
EP17-A. The Limit of Blank (LOB) was established from 60 replicates of a
blank (saline) analyzed on an ACL TOP using two different lots of HemosIL
D-Dimer HS 500 reagents.
The Limit of Detection (LOD) was established with 60 replicates of a low D-
Dimer pool of plasma samples analyzed on the ACL TOP using two different
lots of HemosIL D-Dimer HS 500 reagents. The LOB was determined to be
146 ng/mL and the LOD was 203 ng/mL with a standard deviation of 41.40
ng/mL.
The Limit of Quantification (LOQ) was determined Dilutions of HemosIL D-
Dimer HS 500 Calibrator. Four independent dilutions of each level were
prepared and analyzed in duplicate in five runs using HemosIL D-Dimer HS
500 reagent. Acceptance criteria was ± 15% inaccuracy and CV ≤ 15% was
exceeded for the expected ng/mL of 166, however the value at 208 ng/mL was
within limits establishing an LOQ of 208 ng/mL. According to CLSI EP17-A
guidelines the LOQ could be equal to LOD or higher, but not lower. Thus, the
sponsor established the low-end linearity claim as 215 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed using EP07-A2. The highest
concentration of interferent to be claimed was spiked into two samples (low
and high D-Dimer concentrations) and the results compared to unspiked
5

samples. All samples were tested in 10 replicates using a single lot of
HemosIL D-Dimer HS 500 reagents. For the human anti-mouse antibody
(HAMA) study three plasma samples positive from HAMA were evaluated in
duplicate with HemosIL D-Dimer HS 500 and HemosIL D-Dimer HS
containing a blocking agent against HAMA compared to samples tested in
duplicate with a lot of HemosIL D-Dimer HS without a blocking agent. Data
demonstrated no significant interference for the following:
• Hemoglobin up to 500 mg/dL
• Bilirubin up to 18 mg/dL
• Triglycerides up to 1327 mg/dL
• Rheumatoid factor up to 1400 IU/mL
• FDP up to 10 ug/mL
• Human Anti-mouse Antibodies report as negative for D-Dimer
f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off value for the HemosIL D-Dimer HS 500 was established through
a combination of an Outcome Study performed on 295 frozen samples from
patients admitted consecutively to an emergency unit with suspected PE or
DVT and an internally conducted Blind Mode Study on 100 subjects.
The Blind Mode Study utilized the same samples tested for the In-house
Method Comparison Study (n = 100). Summary statistics for the Blind Mode
Study can be found in the table below under Method Comparison.
Optimization of the House Standard to a cut-off value at 500 ng/nL FEU was
established through clinical testing of 295 frozen citrated plasmas from
patients admitted to an emergency unit with suspected VTE. Of the 295
samples, 75 were confirmed as VTE positive (47 PE and 28 DVT) by standard
objective tests and the remaining 220 were confirmed as negative. Receiver-
operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed representing
sensitivity versus 1-specificity for all values of the threshold in order to assess
diagnostic accuracy across the spectrum of test values.
The clinical cut-off value for the HemosIL D-Dimer HS 500 was validated
using a different patient sample set through the Multi-center Management
Study. This study is the basis for the exclusion of VTE claim when used in
conjunction with a PTP (Wells) score. The Multi-center Management Study
was performed at four hospitals on 747 samples from patients admitted
consecutively to the emergency unit with suspected DVT or PE.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
In-house method comparison was conducted on 100 frozen samples from non-
consecutive patients suspected of VTE obtained from a hospital. Samples for
In-house Method Comparison Study and Blind Mode Study were selected by
the investigator to include a high prevalence of positive VTE samples and
then sent to a testing facility in blind mode without diagnostic information.
The samples were analyzed in singlicate with the HemosIL D-Dimer HS 500
Test on the ACL TOP versus the VIDAS D-Dimer Exclusion Assay. Samples
reporting outside the tests’ ranges were diluted and reanalyzed according to
6

labeling instructions. The slope and intercept were calculated by Passing-
Bablock and correlation coefficient by Pearson. Result summary statistics:
slope 1.00 and r = 0.981, met study acceptance criteria: slope = 0.85 and r >
0.93.

The multi-center management study was performed at four hospitals on 747
samples from patients admitted consecutively to the emergency unit with
suspected DVT or PE. 401 patients were suspected of DVT and 346 patients
were suspected of PE. Of the 346 total PE patients, 204 were females and 142
males with a mean age of 51 years (16 – 101 years). Of the 401 total DVT
patients, 236 were females and 165 males with a mean age was 65.9 years (16
– 95 years).
The Wells model was used to assess pretest probability assessment (PTP) and
patients were classified as having a high, moderate, or low probability of DVT
or PE.
• Patients with a negative D-Dimer test result and a low PTP score
underwent no further diagnostic testing and were followed up after 3
months for development of DVT or PE.
• For patients with a negative D-Dimer test result and a moderate PTP, it
was the physician’s decision whether to follow-up after 3 months or to
undergo imaging techniques. Data from the Management Study show that
all patients with a negative D-Dimer and a moderate or low PTP received
either imaging, 3-month follow-up or both.
• Patients with a positive D-Dimer test result or a high PTP score underwent
imaging techniques.
The overall prevalence of DVT and PE in the total population of samples was
22.4% (90/401) and 15% (52/346), respectively. As of the 3-month follow-
up, none of the patients that were negative through D-Dimer testing had
developed DVT or PE. The sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive
value (NPV) of HemosIL D-Dimer HS 500 for DVT and PE using the
previously established clinical cut-off of 500 ng/mL is summarized below

b. Matrix comparison:
A study was conducted in 57 samples collected in a hospital emergency room
to compare fresh samples versus frozen samples. Fresh samples were
analyzed in duplicate with the HemosIL D-Dimer HS 500 on an ACL TOP.
Aliquots of each fresh sample were frozen at -20 C for at least 1 day and then
tested in duplicate again with the same reagent and instrument. The data
supports use of frozen samples in the performance studies (r = 0.999; y =
1.0393x + 10.222) and were found to be within acceptable limits of slope =
0.85 to 1.15 and r > 0.96.
To demonstrate equivalent performance between citrate anticoagulant
concentrations (3.2% and 3.8%), a comparison study was performed using 20
paired citrated plasma samples. Three of the samples were unspiked and the
other 17 were spiked with varying levels of an internally prepared high-level

D-Dimer concentrate (90,000 ng/mL FEU) to cover a broad range.
Comparable performance was observed between the two anticoagulant
concentrations with a slope of 0.998, correlation (r) of 0.996, and a mean bias
across the range of -2.3%. Acceptance criteria were slope = 0.9-1.1, r > 0.9,
and mean bias ≤ 5%.
3. Clinical studies:
The outcome study was performed on 295 frozen samples collected from patients
with a suspected episode of pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep venous thrombosis
(DVT) admitted consecutively to a hospital emergency department. The samples
were sent to an alternate site for testing. Sequential non-invasive tests were
carried out in the following order: D-Dimer testing, lower-limb compression
ultrasonography and lung scan. Those patients with no conclusive diagnosis
underwent phlebography or angiography. Patients diagnosed as DVT or PE
positive were treated accordingly and those deemed as negative were monitored
for a risk of a thromboembolism event during a 3-month follow-up period. Each
sample was tested with the HemosIL D-Dimer HS 500, the HemosIL D-Dimer
HS on the ACL TOP and historical data from the original tests performed with the
VIDAS D-Dimer Exclusion Assay were included. The VTE prevalence in the
evaluation was 25.4% (75/295 patients). Among the VTE positive samples, 28
corresponded to DVT patients (9.5%) and 47 to PE patients (15.9%). A cut-off of
500 ng/mL was used for the HemosIL D-Dimer HS 500 and VIDAS D-Dimer
Exclusion Assay. The sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value (NPV)
of HemosIL D-Dimer HS 500 for DVT and PE using the previously established
clinical cut-off of 500 ng/mL is summarized below with the corresponding 95%
confidence intervals (CI):

Studies were conducted using CLSI C28-A2. Plasma samples from 140
apparently healthy blood bank donors were tested in duplicate with a single lot of
HemosIL D-Dimer HS 500 reagents on an ACL TOP.
The data support a 95% reference interval limit and 90% CI as follows: Lower
29.1 (0.3 – 57.8%) and Upper 500.1 (471.4 – 528.9%).
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
