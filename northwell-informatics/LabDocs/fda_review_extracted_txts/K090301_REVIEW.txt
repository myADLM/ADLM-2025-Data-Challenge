H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The BinaxNOW® PBP2a Test is a qualitative, in vitro immunochromatographic
assay for the rapid detection of penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a) present in
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The test is performed
directly on blood culture samples positive for S. aureus.
The BinaxNOW® PBP2a Test is not intended to diagnose MRSA nor to guide or
monitor treatment for MRSA infections. Subculturing positive blood cultures is
necessary to recover organisms for susceptibility testing or epidemiological
typing.

L. Test Principle:
The BinaxNOW® PBP2a Test is a rapid immunochromatographic membrane assay
that uses highly sensitive monoclonal antibodies to detect the PBP2a protein directly
from blood cultures which have been identified as being positive for S. aureus. These
antibodies and a control antibody are immobilized onto a test strip as two distinct
lines and combined with other reagents/pads. This test strip is mounted inside a
cardboard, book-shaped hinged test device.
Specimens are aliquots from blood cultures which have been identified as positive for
S. aureus. After the sample is prepared, it is added to the sample pad at the top of the
test strip and the device is closed. Results are read at 10 minutes.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility study was done at three sites, tested by two operators in
duplicates for five days.
10 x (2) duplicates x 2 operators x 5 days x 3 sites= 600
Reproducibility was >95%.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The controls for the BinaxNOW® PBP2a Test are:
1. Built-in positive and negative procedural controls with each testing strip
A. The appearance of a blue line at the “control line” position can be
considered an internal positive procedural control. If capillary flow
has occurred, this line will always appear.
B. The clearing of the background color from the result window is a
negative background control. In comparison to the color of the control
line, the background color in the window should be white within 10
minutes.
2. The recommended QC organisms are the following
4

--- Page 5 ---
Positive control: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus BAA44
Negative control: Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus
ATCC25923
Quality control data was compiled across all four sites and all QC results
were acceptable. The overall expected results were greater than 95%.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical limit of detection of the BinaxNOW® PBP2a Test in ATCC
strain BAA44 using 1/10 diluted saline suspension inoculum is 2.5 x 107
cells/mL.
Bacterial Number

the BinaxNOW® PBP2a Test which provided expected results. There were 38
MRSA strains from NARSA included in the study representing Pulse-Field
Types (PFT) USA100, USA200, USA300, USA400, USA500, USA600,
USA700, and USA800.
Cross Reactivity
Cross Reactivity Study was performed on 32 methicillin-susceptible
Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 38 Staphylococcal strains (other than S.
aureus) and100 non- Staphylococcal strains. All strains tested negative in the
BinaxNOW® test except Cryptococcus neoformans and Staphylococcus
sciuri. A limitation statement will be included in the package insert regarding
the unexpected results of Cryptococcus neoformans and Staphylococcus sciuri
on the BinaxNOW® PBP2a.
Interfering Substances
There was no interference observed with the 20 substances such as
medications, human and blood components, and supplements normally found
in blood culture bottle media.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The clinical study was conducted in 2008-09 at four geographically diverse
hospital laboratories within the US. A total of 199 S. aureus samples were
evaluated with the BinaxNOW® PBP2a Test and compared to standard
methods used routinely by the laboratories: Cefoxitin (30 µg) disc diffusion,
Oxacillin (1 µg) disc diffusion and automated antimicrobial susceptibility test
systems.
The table below presents BinaxNOW® PBP2a Test performance by reference
method. Because each sample was tested on more than one reference method,
there are more observations in this table (n=317) than the total number of
samples (n=199).
