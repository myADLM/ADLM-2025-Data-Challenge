L. Test Principle:
“Calibration verification is the assaying of calibration materials in the same manner
as patient samples to confirm that the calibration of the instrument kit or test system
has remained stable throughout the laboratory’s reportable range for patient test
results.” (42 Code of U.S. Federal Regulations. Part 493.1217. Standard; Calibration
and calibration verification procedures.) (sic.)

Calibration verification is not a requirement of the Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay
systems based on the manufacturer’s recommendations. However, CalCheck
solutions can be used in instances where such a test procedure is required by
certification agencies, or where the user wishes to document calibration verification.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Elecsys Rubella IgG CalCheck is Standardized against the NIBSC 1st
International Standard for Anti-Rubella Immunoglobulin, Human. The NIBSC
standard is reconstituted and a serial dilution set is created from it. A master
curve is derived using the NIBSC dilution set. The master calibrators are assigned
values using the master curve. From the master calibrators a master curve is
derived. In turn the CalChecks are assigned values using the master curve based
on the master calibrators. Values are assigned using a minimum of,
• 4 Elecsys 2010 / cobas e 411 analyzers,
• 4 MODULAR ANALYTICS E170/ cobas e 601 analyzers.
Six independent series of analyses are performed on each instrument. Each
sample is tested in duplicate. The target value is then calculated as the median of
the determined values. Approximate target values are given in the table below.
Lot-specific target values may differ slightly after value assignment.

Stability:
Two studies were performed in order to verify the stability claims for the Elecsys
Rubella IgG CalCheck. The data was generated using Rubella IgG master
calibrators, which have the same composition and target values as Rubella IgG
CalCheck.
Study 1: Accelerated Stability: Reference and on-test material are tested in
duplicate. The on-test material is stored at 35°C for 3 weeks, the reference
material at 2-8°C. The on-test recovery is calculated as a percent of the reference
value. The acceptance criterion was recovery of 90-110 % of the reference value.
The unopened Rubella IgG CalCheck is stable up to the stated expiration date.

Study 2: Open Vial Stability: The Elecsys Rubella IgG CalCheck test material
and reference material are tested in duplicate. The test material is reconstituted,
stored for four hours at 25°C (in open vial). The reference material is a freshly
reconstituted set of Elecsys Rubella IgG CalChecks. The acceptance criterion was
recovery of 90-110% of the reference value.
The reconstituted Elecsys Rubella IgG is stable up to 4 hours at 20-25°C.
