L. Test Principle:
Creatininase (in the first reagent) hydrolyzes creatinine in a sample to creatine.
Creatine is hydrolyzed by creatinase to sarcosine and urea. Sarcosine from this
reaction is oxidized by sarcosine oxidase to glycine and formaldehyde and hydrogen
peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide reacts with 4-aminoantipyrine and an acid in the
presence of peroxidase to yield a quinine imine chromogen. The resulting change in
absorbance at 540 and 770 nm is proportional to the creatinine concentration in the
sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies for serum and urine samples were evaluated using CLSI
EP5-A as a guideline. The sponsor conducted a 20 day ANOVA study with
the Dimension Vista 1500 instrument. The sponsor conducted within run
precision (repeatability), between run precision, between day precision and
within lab precision (total) with two serum pools, two serum controls, two
urine pools and two urine controls. For within-run precision, samples were
run in singlet for twenty days (n=20). For total precision, samples were tested
twice daily, in duplicate over 20 days (n=80). Results of the precision studies

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Serum and urine linearity were assessed via recovery studies using EP6-A as a
guideline. Studies are conducted on the Dimension Vista 1500 instrument
Serum
Serum samples were assayed in replicates of five and linear regression
equations were determined. Serum samples were spiked with anhydrous
creatinine and nine lower concentrations were prepared using Dimension
Vista Calibrator level 1 as a diluent. Serum samples concentrations ranged
from 0.0 to 25.46 mg/dL. The serum linear equation is y=0.993x-0.14 and the
recoveries ranged from 87.9 to 100%. The linear equation and recovery
results and limit of detection (LoD) in d. below support the sponsor’s claimed
serum linear range of 0.14 to 20 mg/dL.
Urine
Urine samples were assayed in replicates of five and linear regression
equations were determined. Urine samples were spiked with anhydrous
creatinine directly into urine to make a high sample and nine lower

concentrations were prepared using deionized water as a diluent. Urine
concentrations ranged from 0.00 to 464.80 mg/dL. The urine linear equation is
y=0.991x-2.96 and the recoveries ranged from 93.7 to 106.9%. The linear
equation and recovery results and LoD in d. below support the sponsor’s
claimed urine linear range of 2.8 to 400 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The Dimension Vista Enzymatic Creatinine Calibrator is traceable and
prepared gravimetrically from the NIST standard reference material SRM914.
Value assignment
Six levels of the in house master calibrators are prepared from the stock
solution that is traceability to NIST 914 SRM Creatinine standard reference
material. Level 1 does not contain analyte and is assigned a value of 0 mg/dL.
The creatinine standards used in these calibrators is prepared using an in-
house gravimetric preparation. Standards were tested in replicates of 5 per
level assayed with multiple lots on multiple instruments. The sponsors
acceptance criteria for the obtained values for calibrator A and B are 0.8 to 1.0
mg/dL and 20 to 22 mg/dL respectively. Working calibrators are traceable to
the in-house master calibrators with similar protocols.
Stability
Stability characteristics of the Dimension Vista ECREA Calibrator were
determined stressed and accelerated studies. Real-time studies are on-going.
Four different stressed conditions were test at five time periods. The results from
the studies support the sponsor’s claimed shelf-life of 12 months at 4 °C, closed
(sealed) stability of 30 days on the instrument and open vial (punctured) stability
of 5 days at 2-8° C.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor assessed the Limit of the Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection
(LoD) according to the CLSI EP17-A guideline. The LoB was determined by
assaying five blank samples (deionized water) in replicates of four (n=20) and
adding 2 standard deviations of the mean. The LoD was determined by
assaying four replicates of 5 samples (with concentrations close to 4 times the
LoB) per day for three days. The samples were assayed on four instruments by
one operator. The results for LoB are 0.07 mg/dL and for LoD are 0.14
mg/dL for serum. The LoD for urine was calculated to be 2.8 mg/dL.

Analytical specificity:
Interference studies to determine the effects of unconjugated bilirubin,
hemolysis and lipemia were performed according to CLSI EP-7A. The
sponsor states that interferences are considered to be significant if the bias
between the test and control samples are greater than 10%.
Assay performance claims have been established on the Dimension Vista
System 1500 by testing a serum pool containing approximately 1.0 mg/dL
creatinine to the following concentrations of each interferent:
Unconjugated and conjugated Bilirubin – 30 and 40mg/dL;
Results:
Bilirubin: No significant interference at 30 mg/dL.
Concentrations greater than 30 mg/dL bilirubin may cause interference.
Hemolysis – 500 and 600 mg/dL;
Results:
Hemolysis: No significant interference at 500 mg/dL.
Concentrations greater than 500 mg/dL may cause interference. The sponsor
states in the package insert the following “moderately hemolyzed specimens
should not be used with the ECREA method”.
Lipemia (intralipid) – 1000 and 4000 mg/dL.
Results:
Lipemia (Intralipid): No significant interference at 1000 mg/dL.
Concentrations greater than 1000 mg/dL may cause interference.
The sponsor has the following interference section in the package insert:
Hemoglobin at 600 mg/dL [0.37 mmol/L] decreases ECREA results by 10%
at 1.02 mg/dL [90.2 μmol/L] creatinine.
Bilirubin (unconjugated) at 40 mg/dL [707 μmol/L] decreases ECREA results
by 19% at 1.01 mg/dL [89.3 μmol/L] creatinine.
Bilirubin (conjugated) at 40 /dL [707 μmol/L] decreases ECREA results by
16% at 1.01 mg/dL [89.3 μmol/L] creatinine.
Lipemia at 3000 mg/dL [33.9 mmol/L] increases ECREA by 25% at 1.01
mg/dL [89.3 μmol/L] creatinine.
In additional, the sponsor has an extensive list of substances tested in the
package insert and found no significant interferences.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A comparison study was performed using CLSI EP9-A2 as a guideline with
this device and a commercially available enzymatic method.
One-hundred and thirty serum samples that ranged from 0.57 -19.9 mg/dL
were assayed in singlicate with the current method using the Dimension Vista
1500 (y-axis) and a creatinine assay using the Hitachi 917 (x-axis). The
resulting linear regression equation is y=1.029x-0.177 mg/dL with a
correlation coefficient of 1.00.
One-hundred and twenty-six urine samples that ranged from 8.2 to 391 mg/dL
were assayed in singlicate with the current method using the Dimension Vista
1500 (y-axis) and a creatinine assay using the Hitachi 917 (x-axis). The
resulting linear regression equation is y=1.057x-6.11 mg/dL with a correlation
coefficient of 0.999.
The sponsor has conducted a method comparison to a reference procedure
called Isotope Dilution-Gas Chromatography/ Mass Spectrometry (ID-
GC/MS) to evaluate commutability. Thirty-two serum samples ranging from
0.5 to 40.9 mg/dL were evaluated against the ID-GC/MS method. The
resulting linear regression equation was y=1.027x-0.015 with a correlation
coefficient of 0.9985. Twenty urine samples ranging from 25.7 to 404.0
mg/dL were also evaluated against the ID- GC/MS method. The resulting
linear regression equation was y=1.019x-3.089 with a correlation coefficient
of 0.998.
b. Matrix comparison:
Fifty-six matched sets of serum(x)/ lithium heparin plasma (y)/ sodium
heparin (y) samples ranging from 0.53 to 17.25 were assayed with the
Dimension Vista 1500 using EP9-A2 as a guideline. Sixteen of the fifty-six
samples were spiked to obtain higher creatinine concentrations. The
following tables show the linear regression results from the comparison of
serum to the plasmas tested.

Linear Regression Equation Y=0.9745x + 0.0634 Y=0.978x + 0.0745
