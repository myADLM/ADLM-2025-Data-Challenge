Body Fluid Application:
Total nucleated cell (TNC) count and RBC count
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Body Fluid Application can be run on the ADVIA 2120 and the ADVIA
2120i hematology analyzers. The ADVIA 2120/ADVIA 2120i Body Fluid
Application uses the ADVIA 120 CBC TIMEpac and ADVIA 120 Diff TIMEpac
reagents to determine the TNC and RBC counts. No additional Body Fluid
Application specific reagents are needed.
The ADVIA 2120 Hematology system consists of the following: an analytical
module that aspirates, dilutes, and analyzes whole blood samples; an autosampler
that automatically mixes, identifies, and presents the samples for processing; a
computer workstation that controls the instrument, provides primary user interface
with the instrument and manages the data produced by the instrument; a printer
that optionally generates reports based on the instrument results and an autoslide
module.
2. Principles of Operation:
The ADVIA 2120/2120i Body Fluid Application uses the Basophil/Lobularity
and RBC/Platelet channels to enumerate the TNC and RBC counts. The TNC
count is derived from the Basophil/Lobularity channel. The ADVIA 2120/2120i
BASO reagent contains surfactant and phthalic acid which, in the presence of low
heat in the Baso channel reaction chamber, lyses RBCs and strips the cytoplasmic
membrane from all leukocytes except basophils. This cell suspension is
subsequently passed through the flowcell. The cell suspension is intercepted by
light from the laser diode where the low-angle light scatter (2° to 3°) and high-
angle light scatter (5° to 15°) signals of each cell are counted.
The RBC count is derived from the RBC/Platelet channel. The ADVIA
2120/2120i
1

--- Page 2 ---
RBC/Platelet reagent uses sodium dodecyl sulfate and glutaraldehyde to sphere
and fix the RBCs. This cell suspension uses the same flowcell and low-angle and
high-angle light scatter signals as the Baso channel to count the RBCs. The
system automatically reports the TNC and RBC counts in conventional or SI units
appropriate for body fluid samples.
The Basophil/Lobularity cytochemical reactions consist of two steps:
Step 1 - Red blood cells and platelets are lysed using the ADVIA 120 BASO
reagent.
Step 2 - All white blood cells except basophils are stripped of their cytoplasm
using the ADVIA 120 BASO reagent and the increased temperature in the
reaction chamber.
The Body Fluid Application default Run Screen, displays 3 cytograms:
Peroxidase, Basophil/Lobularity and RBC Scatter cytograms. The
Basophil/Lobularity and Peroxidase channel cytograms have been modified
specifically for the light scatter characteristics of the cells in body fluid samples.
The RBC cytogram is the same as the cytogram for whole blood analysis.
The reported TNC count is derived from the Basophil/Lobularity channel. The
TNC count is the sum of the events above the Baso Y-channel Noise threshold
plus the events left of Baso X-channel 49. The events in the Baso channel Noise
region for the Body Fluid Application are excluded from the TNC count.
The WBC count from the Peroxidase channel (WBCP) is compared to the TNC
count from the Basophil/Lobularity channel. When the TNC does not agree with
the WBCP count within limits specific to the Body Fluid Application, the TNC
count is flagged with an asterisk. Determination of the RBC count is the same as
for whole blood samples. The Header information includes the body fluid
specimen type.
3. Modes of Operation:
ADVIA 2120/2120i system is a random access analyzer which has three sampling
modes: [1] Manual open tube sampler, [2] manual closed tube sampler and
[3] automated closed tube sampler (Autosampler).
4. Specimen Identification:
Sample identification is done by following modes: [1] Manually entered sample
ID [2] barcode [3] rack/position numbers (for autosampler only) and [4]
instrument automatic incremental numbering.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Body fluids samples must be manually mixed by gentle inversion for the manual
open and closed tube modes. The automated closed tube sampler mixer rotates
first to +45° then to +135°, staying at each orientation for a minimum of 0.6
seconds and a maximum of 15 seconds. A total of 25 mixer-cycles are required
before aspiration. Fully mixed samples which have a dwell of over 15 seconds
require an additional 20 mixer cycles before aspiration. If a dwell exceeds 5
minutes, the samples must be mixed again for 45 cycles before aspiration.
6. Calibration:
ADVIA 2120/2120i systems calibration for all reportable CBC, Diff. and retic.
(except % retic.) parameters require the ADVIA SETpoint Calibrator and one
2

A precision study was performed based on the guidelines contained in CLSI EP5-
A2. The TNC and RBC pools were assayed over a 20 day period with two runs
per day; two replicates per run, for total of 80 replicates for each pool.
Stabilized pools were prepared with target TNC concentrations of 50, 100, 500,
1000, and 10000 cells/uL in plasma diluted 1:2 with phosphate buffer.
Stabilized pools were prepared with target RBC concentrations of 50, 100, 500,
and 1000 x 103 cells/uL in plasma diluted 1:2 with phosphate buffer.
The results were analyzed using nested analysis of variance consistent with the
guidance contained in CLSI EP5-A2.

The results are considered acceptable if they meet the design input requirements
for within-run precision. The design input requirements are ≤ 15% CV at 500
cells/μL for the TNC count and ≤ 10% CV at 50 x103 cells/μL for the RBC count.
Conclusions: The results of the precision studies using stabilized specimens
indicated acceptable precision over the time period tested.
Repeatability Testing
Specimens were utilized from the stability study, described below. One specimen
of each body fluid type assayed 10 times in one run on a single day. Additional
assays were not possible because of sample volume and sample stability
limitations. The mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation are
calculated for each sample included in the study. The results are considered
acceptable if they meet the design input requirements for within-run precision.
The design input requirements are ≤ 15% CV at 500 cells/μL for the TNC count
and ≤ 10% CV at 50 x103 cells/μL for the RBC count.

Conclusion: The results from the repeatability study demonstrate that within-run
precision of the body fluid counts meets the design input requirements of ≤ 15%
CV at 500 cells/μL for the TNC count and ≤ 10% CV at 50 x103 cells/μL for the
RBC count.
Reproducibility/Specimen Stability
The goal of the testing the Body Fluid Software is to demonstrate stability of
fluids under different conditions using the system software. This was
accomplished by using remnant body fluid samples collected in K2 or K3 EDTA
at two external sites. These sites collected pleural, peritoneal and peritoneal
dialysate body fluids. The samples were run on ADVIA 2120/2120i using the
body fluid application. These fluid samples were tested within 2-hours to
represent the baseline or zero (0) time result, as well at different time points, and
different conditions (room temperature and at 2-8°C). Specimens included:
Five (5) samples with RBC counts that fall in the range from ≥ 10,000 cells/uL to
6.76 x 106 cells/μL for each type of fluid.
Five (5) samples with TNC counts that fall in the range of 0.030 to 400 x 103
cells/μL (30 to 400,000) for each type of fluid.
Conclusion: The observed regression slopes all meet the acceptance criteria of
falling within the range of 0.9 to 1.1. It can be concluded that body fluid samples
are stable at room temperature for 8 hours and when refrigerated for 24 hours.
c. Linearity:
The objective of the linearity protocol was to verify low level linearity of the body
fluid TNC and RBC counts. High level linearity of the counting methods has been
established previously (k042251) in whole blood sampling modes. Low level
pools with a target WBC concentration of 500 cells/uL and an RBC target
concentration of 500 thousand cells/uL were created. Serial dilutions of these
pools were made with cell free materials (plasma diluted in PBS) over the low
level range of the assays. The WBC pools were aspirated 13 times each in body
fluid mode, and the RBC pools were aspirated 12 times each.

d. Carryover:
The carryover protocol was run in all three sampling modes: manual open tube,
manual closed tube, and automated sampling. Carryover was tested by four
different methods in each sampling mode:
A normal whole blood assayed in CBC/Diff mode followed by three aspirations
of a saline sample in body fluid mode.
A manipulated whole blood sample with elevated WBC counts (approximately
30,000 cells/uL) and RBC counts (approximately 6 million cells/uL) assayed in
CBC/Diff mode followed by three aspirations of a saline sample in body fluid
mode.
A normal whole blood assayed in body fluid mode followed by three aspirations
of a saline sample in body fluid mode.
A manipulated whole blood sample with elevated WBC counts (approximately
30,000 cells/uL) and RBC counts (approximately 6 million cells/uL) assayed in
body fluid mode followed by three aspirations of a saline sample in body fluid
mode.
Five sets of carryover sequences were run for each type of carryover test within
each sampling mode. A saline primer was assayed before each body fluid sample
when using the Autosampler as instructed in the body fluids instructions for use.
Carryover results are listed in the Tables below. Each Table entry is the average
of the 5 carryover sequences run in each configuration.

e. Interfering Substances:
If TNC and RBC counts from patient samples where the manual differential
shows a proportional neutrophil count ≥ 80%, crystals, the presence of lipids
and/or chylomicrons, cellular deterioration and disintegration, or the patient is
under treatment with a sclerosing agent, the results should be confirmed by an
alternate method.
2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
The range of reportable values study included a limit of blank (LoB) study, a limit
of detection study (LoD), and a limit of quantitation (LoQ) study as defined in
CLSI EP17 CLSI EP17-A to determine the lowest concentration of TNC and
RBC counts that can be detected with at least 95% probability.

Limit of Blank
Cell free samples were prepared by mixing equal amounts of cell free plasma and
PBS. These samples were assayed in body fluid mode over a 4-day period. A total
of 80 assays were performed on the blank samples.
The results are analyzed non – parametrically as recommended in section 4.1.1 of
CLSI EP17-A. The TNC LoB is four (4) cells, and the RBC LoB is 1,000 cells.
The limit of blank was determined to be 4.24 cells / uL for TNC and 1.43 x 103
cells/uL for RBC.
Limit of Detection
Limit of detection (LoD) was estimated by preparing pools with a TNC
concentration of approximately 20 cells/uL and an RBC concentration of
approximately 10 x 103 cells/uL. Based on the LoB results, five samples prepared
with a TNC concentration of approximately 20 cells/uL were assayed 13 times
each day for a total of four days. Likewise, five samples prepared with an RBC
concentration of approximately 10 – 11 x103 cells/uL were assayed 13 times each
day for a total of four days. LoD is calculated as LoD = LoB + (c-beta)x(SD) as
recommended in section 4.3.2 of CLSI EP17-A. The limit of detection was
determined to be 12.8 cells/uL for TNC and 2.8 x 103 cells/uL for RBC.
Limit of Quantitation
Pools were prepared with target TNC concentrations of 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and
500 cells/uL. Each pool was assayed 13 times each. Pools were prepared with
target RBC concentrations of 0, 10, 30, 50, 75, 100, and 500 x103 cells/uL. Each
pool was assayed 12 times each. LoQ is determined as the analyte level where a
20% total CV is obtained. The LoQ for the TNC count is 27 cells/uL and the LoQ
for the RBC count is 4.94 x103 cells/uL.
K. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
L. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
