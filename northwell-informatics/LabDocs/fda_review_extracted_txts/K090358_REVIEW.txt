L. Test Principle:
The ARCHITECT iValproic Acid assay is an in vitro chemiluminescent microparticle
immunoassay (CMIA) for the quantitative measurement of valproic acid in human
serum or plasma. Anti-valproic acid coated paramagnetic microparticles, and
valproic acid acridinium-labeled conjugate are combined to create a reaction mixture.
The anti-valproic acid coated microparticles bind to valproic acid present in the
sample and to the valproic acid acridinium-labeled conjugate. After washing, pre-
trigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting
chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). An indirect
relationship exists between the amount of valproic acid in the sample and the RLUs
detected by the ARCHITECT i System optics.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated at the manufacturer’s site on three ARCHITECT i
2000SR instruments using three lots of reagents and one lot of calibrators. The
assay was run twice a day for 20 days using three levels of Abbott Immunoassay-
MCC (Liquid) and four levels of patient serum panels in replicates of two,
resulting in a total of 80 replicates for each control and panel. Results are shown

A study was conducted to demonstrate that valproic acid supplemented into
human serum can be accurately recovered by the ARCHITECT iValproic
Acid assay. A total of 10 human serum and plasma specimens (5 serum and 5
plasma) and the ARCHITECT iValproic Acid Calibrator A (recalcified
nonreactive human plasma) were supplemented with a valproic acid stock
solution of concentrations of 0, 15, 30, 75 and 113 μg/ml (determined

by the equation:
% Recovery = (Observed (μg/mL)/ Expected (μg/mL)) x 100
The expected concentrations were based on the gravimetric preparation using
USP valproic acid material of known concentration. Results from serum
samples are shown below. Overall, similar results were observed for the
plasma samples evaluated.

To demonstrate linearity across the assay range, five individual serum samples
and five individual plasma samples were each spiked with a concentrated valproic
acid stock solution to target sample concentration values greater than 140ug/mL
but less than 160 ug/mL. Each sample was diluted using the ARCHITECT
iValproic Acid Calibrator A to 11 concentrations spanning the entire assay range.

Validation of the manual dilution procedure:
A study was conducted to verify the use of ARCHITECT iMulti-Assay Manual
Diluent as the manual diluent for routine 1:10 dilutions of a sample tested with the
ARCHITECT iValproic Acid assay. Five high serum and five plasma sample sets
containing valproic acid concentrations were tested in replicates of four. Average
percent recovery was equal to 104%.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The ARCHITECT iValproic Acid Calibrators are traceable to United States
Pharmacopeia (USP) valproic acid.
The stability of the calibrators was established through real time testing,
conducted at multiple time points. The sponsor’s protocol was reviewed and
found to be acceptable. Three lots of calibrators and one lot each of reagents were
used to test multiple levels of serum panels and control material. At time point
zero, all calibrator bottles were opened and closed, and then stored at 2-8°C for
the duration of the study. The serum panels were stored at -70°C or colder. No
trends in recovery of serum samples were observed throughout the real-time
month testing interval.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) of the ARCHITECT i
Valproic Acid assay were determined based on CLSI Protocol EP17. These
evaluations were performed using one blank (60 replicates) and five low level
valproic acid samples (15 replicates each). Analysis yielded LoB = 0.27 μg/mL
and LoD = 0.51 μg/mL. Three instruments, three lots of reagents, three lots of
calibrators and one control lot were used for this study. Results support the low
end range claim of 2 ug/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The following compounds were tested for cross-reactivity or interference in serum
samples containing 0 ug/mL, 50 ug/mL and 100 ug/mL valproic acid.
Measurements were compared to those of control samples without cross-reactant.
Results are shown below and in the package insert:

Interference from endogenous compounds was evaluated based on the CLSI
Protocol EP7-A2. Serum specimens with valproic acid levels were targeted at 50
and 100 μg/mL and supplemented with the compounds listed below.

concentration) μg/mL Valproic acid 100 μg/mL Valproic

Evaluation of Other Potentially Interfering Compounds
The ARCHITECT i Valproic Acid assay is designed to have a mean recovery
of 100 ± 10% in the presence of HAMA and rheumatoid factor (RF). In a study,
the ARCHITECT i Valproic Acid assay was evaluated by testing specimens with
HAMA and RF to further assess the clinical specificity. Five specimens positive
for HAMA and five specimens positive for RF were evaluated for percent
recovery with valproic acid spiked into each specimen to target concentrations of
50 and 100 μg/mL. The mean percent recovery for HAMA specimens ranged
9

from 103% to 104% and for RF specimens ranged from 103% to 109%. The
package insert notes that specimens from patients who have received preparations
of mouse monoclonal antibodies for diagnosis or therapy may show either falsely
elevated or depressed values when tested with assay kits that employ mouse
monoclonal antibodies.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable. This is a quantitative assay.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison was performed based on guidance from the CLSI EP9A-2. Two
ARCHITECT i 2000SR instruments, three lots each of ARCHITECT iValproic Acid
reagents and calibrators, and one lot of ARCHITECT iValproic Acid controls were
used. Two ARCHITECT i 2000 instruments, three lots each of ARCHITECT
SR
iValproic Acid reagents and calibrators, and one lot of ARCHITECT iValproic Acid
controls were used. A total of 152 serum specimens containing valproic acid that
spanned the measurement range of the assay were measured. No other selection
criteria were applied. Results ranged from 3.13 to 144.10 with the ARCHITECT
iValproic Acid and from 3.32 to 145.06 with the AxSYM Valproic Acid assay.

A bias analysis was also performed by the sponsor on the same specimens. The
average bias exhibited by ARCHITECT vs. AxSYM in this study was -0.386% (95%
confidence interval -1.181% to 0.410%). Within the typical therapeutic range
of valproic acid therapy (50 to 100 μg/mL, as read in the AxSYM), the
average bias was -0.353% (95% confidence interval of -1.442% to
0.736%).
b. Matrix comparison:
A study was conducted to evaluate different anticoagulant tube types that can be
used with the ARCHITECT iValproic Acid assay. Donors were drawn with the
following matched, FDA-cleared tube types of serum and plasma: human serum,
no additive (control); human plasma 2K-EDTA Sodium Heparin, 3K-EDTA
