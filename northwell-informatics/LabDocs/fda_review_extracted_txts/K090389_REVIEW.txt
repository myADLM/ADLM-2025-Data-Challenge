L. Test Principle:
The AP-1000 Blood Glucose Monitoring System uses electrochemical
methodologies. The system quantitatively measures blood glucose levels using an
amperometric method, which involves detecting the current produced from
glucose oxidation. The electrons generated during this reaction are transferred
from the blood to the electrodes. The magnitude of the resultant current is
proportional to the concentration of glucose in the specimen and the signal is
converted into a readout displayed on the meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor evaluated within run and between run precision of the device
using a protocol based on CLSI EP5-A. Whole blood samples spiked with
six different glucose concentrations were used. Ten replicate
measurements were tested for each concentration each day, using two lots
of test strips and ten meters for a total of twenty days. Results for each
test strip lot are summarized in the tables below:
Lot 1

(mg/dL) SD (mg/dL) SD (mg/dL) variation (CV %)

In addition, the sponsor evaluated five replicates of two levels of control
solutions with two test strip lots and twenty meters. Results are
summarized in the following tables:

(mg/dL) (mg/dL) variation (CV %)

2 231.8 6.9 3.0
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor evaluated linearity of the device using a protocol based on
CLSI EP6-A. Testing was performed using oxygenated venous blood
samples at eleven different blood glucose levels, ranging from 20 to 726
mg/dL, tested on two lots of test strips, on ten meters in replicates of ten.
The YSI 2300D STAT plus glucose analyzer was used as the reference
method. The measuring range of the device is 20 to 600 mg/dL.
Linear Regression Analysis:
Lot 1: y = 1.0375x + 3.8754, r2= 0.9991.
Lot 2: y = 1.0563x + 0.8588, r2= 0.9986.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
The values for the MAJOR Control Solutions are assigned by repeat
analysis using three different lots of AP-1000 test strips and five AP-1000
meters. The mean and standard deviation are used to establish the
acceptable range for the strips.

Stability characteristics of the Major Glucose Control Solutions were
determined using real-time studies. The unopened shelf-life is 24 months
and the open vial stability is 90 days at the recommended storage of 36 °F
to 86 °F.
Stability characteristics of the AP-1000 blood glucose test strips were
determined using real-time studies. The unopened shelf-life is 18 months
and the open vial stability is 90 days at the recommended storage of 36 °F
to 86 °F.
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the system is 20 - 600 mg/dL. This range was
verified by the linearity study (see section M.1.b.).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed using a protocol based on CLSI EP7-
A. A blood sample was collected from a volunteer. Hematocrit was
adjusted to 40 ± 2 %, and the sample was separated into two aliquots. The
glucose levels were adjusted to a low (100 to 150 mg/dL) and a high (200
to 250 mg/dL) level by supplementing each sample with a 50% aqueous
glucose solution. The YSI 2300D STAT plus glucose analyzer was used
as a reference instrument. The following substances were evaluated,
Ascorbic acid (1.2, 1.5, 2 and 3 mg/dL), Acetaminophen (2, 6, 15 and 20
mg/dL), Dopamine (3.2, 6.5, 9.7 and 13 mg/dL), Ibuprofen (4.2, 15, 30
and 40 mg/dL), L-Dopa (5 and 10 mg/dL), Tetracycline (0.4, 1.5, 3 and 4
mg/dL), Tolbutamide (10, 35, 70 and 100 mg/dL), Cholesterol (300, 350,
400 and 500 mg/dL), Creatinine (1.5, 15, 22.5 and 30 mg/dL) and Uric
acid (7, 12, 16 and 20 mg/dL). Each potential interfering substance was
added to an aliquot of the low glucose blood sample and to an aliquot of the
high glucose to the final concentrations listed above and compared to the
same sample without the potential interfering substance (control). The
results are as follows:

Ibuprofen, Tetracycline, Tolbutamide, Cholesterol and Creatinine did not
significantly interfere with the measurements (bias less than ±10%).
Acetaminophen (2 mg/dL), Ascorbic Acid (2 mg/dL at low glucose levels
and 30 mg/dL at high glucose levels), Dopamine (3.2 mg/dL at low
glucose levels and 9.7 mg/dL at high glucose levels), L-dopa (5 mg/dL)
and Uric acid (7mg/dL) significantly interfered with the measurements
(bias more than 10%).
The sponsor included the following warnings in the label:
• Therapeutic levels of acetaminophen, normal to high levels of uric
acid and high levels of ascorbic acid/ vitamin C in blood may
result in inaccurate glucose readings. Blood glucose readings from
these cases should be interpreted with caution.
• Therapeutic levels of L-dopa or dopamine may result in inaccurate
glucose readings with the system.

Hematocrit Study: the effect of hematocrit was evaluated in a study
using a venous blood sample with five glucose concentrations (20, 70,
170, 285 and 600 mg/dL) and hematocrit levels adjusted to 25, 30, 40, 50,
55, 60 and 70 %. The YSI 2300D STAT plus glucose analyzer was used
to check the glucose concentrations of the blood samples. Each glucose
level/hematocrit combination was tested on ten meters per lot of strips
(two lots of strips). The results of samples at each of the varying
hematocrit levels were compared to the YSI value of the samples. The
average of the measurements had a deviation less than 15% at ≥ 75 mg/dL
(individual bias ranging from 0 to 17.6 %) and less than 10 mg/dL at < 75
mg/dL (individual bias ranging from 0 to 6 mg/dL) at 30 to 55%
hematocrit.
The sponsor included the following warning in the label:
• Abnormal blood cell counts (hematocrit levels below 30 % and
above 55 %) may cause inaccurate test results.
Altitude Study: the effect of altitude was evaluated using five venous
blood samples with five glucose concentrations (56, 72, 123, 253 and 462
mg/dL) with hematocrit levels between 30 and 55 %. The YSI 2300D
STAT plus glucose analyzer was used to check the glucose concentrations
of the blood samples. The results of this study are acceptable: all
measurements must have a deviation less than 20% at ≥ 75 mg/dL and less
than 15 mg/dL at < 75 mg/dL.
The sponsor included the following statement in the label:
• Clinical testing demonstrates that altitudes up to 10,183 feet (3104
meters) above sea level do not affect results with the AP-1000
Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
Temperature and humidity studies: studies were performed to
demonstrate that the meter can be used at temperatures from 10 to 40 °C
and at relative humidity ranging from 20 to 80 %. A venous blood sample
with three glucose concentrations (approximately 50, 100 and 250 mg/dL)
was used for the studies. The YSI 2300D STAT plus glucose analyzer
was used to check the glucose concentrations of the blood samples. Five
meters and one lot of strips were used for each study. The results were
reviewed and found to be acceptable.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Reference Method Comparison:
This study was performed in accordance with ISO 15197 to demonstrate
the accuracy of the proposed device when compared to measurements
obtained with the YSI 2300D STAT plus glucose analyzer (reference
method). One hundred blood samples with glucose concentrations ranging
from 21.8 to 600 mg/dL were prepared by spiking a blood sample with
glucose. The hematocrit was adjusted to 40 ± 2 %. The YSI 2300D
STAT plus glucose analyzer was used to check the glucose concentrations
of the blood samples. One meter and two lots of strips were used for the
study. The study met the ISO 15197 standard where ninety-five percent
(95%) of the individual glucose results shall fall within ±15mg/dL of the
results at glucose concentrations <75mg/dL and within ±20% at glucose
concentrations ≥75mg/dL. The results are as follows:

Lay-User Study:
This study was performed in accordance with ISO 15197 with 150 total
patients. The 150 study participants obtained and tested their own
capillary whole blood sample using the AP-1000 Blood Glucose
Monitoring System (the proposed device) and only the directions in the
labeling. Health care professionals then tested capillary whole blood
using the proposed device and the YSI 2300D STAT plus glucose
analyzer (the reference method) on the same individuals. These samples
ranged in concentration from 58 to 350 mg/dL. The results met the ISO
15197 standard criteria where ninety-five percent (95%) of the individual
glucose results shall fall within ±15mg/dL of the reference results at
glucose concentrations <75mg/dL and within ±20% at reference glucose
concentrations ≥75mg/dL. The results are as follows:
