H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
LipidPro™ system is intended for in home (self-testing) or health care professionals and
for testing outside the body (in vitro diagnostic use only). LipidPro™ system which
consists of meter and test strips, measures total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL-C), triglyceride (TG) and glucose in capillary whole blood.
Cholesterol measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders involving
excess cholesterol in the blood and lipid and lipoprotein metabolism disorders. Lipoprotein
measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of lipid disorders (such as diabetes
mellitus), atherosclerosis and various liver and renal diseases. Triglyceride measurements
are used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus, nephrosis, liver
obstruction, other diseases involving lipid metabolism, or various endocrine
disorders. Calculated LDL-cholesterol values are reported only when triglycerides are ≤
350 mg/dL; when triglycerides are > 350 mg/dL, calculated LDL-cholesterol are not
reported.
Glucose measurement is for the quantitative measurement of the concentration of glucose
in capillary whole blood that can be taken from the fingertip, ventral palm, dorsal hand,
upper arm, forearm, calf and/or thigh by diabetic patients or health care professionals as an
aid in the management of diabetes. Glucose measurement is not to be used for the diagnosis
of or screening for diabetes or for neonatal use. Alternate site testing should be done during

L. Test Principle:
LipidPro system has two different test principles: one for glucose and the other for the lipid
profile (total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride)
The LipidPro blood glucose test is based on measurement of electrical current caused by the
reaction of glucose with the reagents on the electrode of the test strip. The blood sample is
drawn into the end of the test strip through capillary action. Glucose in the sample reacts with
glucose oxidase and hexaammineruthenium chloride, generating a current that is proportional
to the glucose concentration in the sample. The result is shown on the meter display after 3
seconds.
The LipidPro profile test results are based on reading reflection density. When the blood is
applied, the color changes in the test area through an enzyme reaction. The meter records this
change in color and converts the measurement signal to the displayed result using the data
previously entered via the code. The color changes are proportional to the lipid concentration
in the sample. The result is shown on the meter display after 2 minutes.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated according to the CLSI EP06-A guideline. Linearity was
performed using the LipidPro meter and the LipidPro glucose test strips, total
cholesterol test strips, HDL-cholesterol test strips, and triglyceride test strips.
i.) EDTA venous whole blood was spiked or glycolyzed to produce two levels of
glucose concentrations (low and high level). These two glucose concentrations
were mixed in proportion to create 12 glucose concentrations with equally spaced
concentrations. A total of 14 glucose concentrations were prepared with glucose
concentrations ranged from 20 to 600 mg/dL. Each concentration was tested five
times by the LipidPro meter and in duplicate by the YSI 2300 analyzer. Regression
analysis showed a linear relationship between the LipidPro method and the YSI
method: Y = 0.9983X + 0.967, R2= 0.9999
ii.) EDTA venous whole blood samples were used to prepare two levels of
concentrations (low and high level) of cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and
triglyceride. These two levels were then used to prepare four levels of intermediate
concentrations. Each concentration was tested five times by the LipidPro meter and
in duplicate by another laboratory method. Regression analysis showed a linear
relationship between the LipidPro meter and the laboratory method. Results are
summarized below:
For Total cholesterol: Y = 0.996X + 1.7212, R2= 0.9998, samples ranged from 100-
400 mg/dL
For HDL-cholesterol: Y = 0.978X + 1.779, R2= 0.9946, samples ranged from 25-80
mg/dL
For Triglyceride: Y = 1.0002X + 0.7005, R2= 0.9999, samples ranged from 70-600
mg/dL
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed that the glucose test is linear
from 20-600 mg/dL, total cholesterol test is linear from 100-400mg/dL, HDL-
cholesterol test is linear from 25-80 mg/dL, and triglyceride test is linear from 70-
600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The LipidPro glucose measuring system is traceable to NIST SRM 917b reference
material. Method comparison information demonstrated accuracy to YSI 2300 analyzer.
Infopia Co. has documented traceability to the NCEP’s recommended accuracy base for
Total Cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol by performing a direct comparison with a
13

--- Page 14 ---
Cholesterol Reference Method Laboratory Network laboratory using fresh human
specimens which cover the NCEP medical decision points.
Triglyceride does not have a reference material; it is traceable to a commercially
available laboratory method through an internal procedure.
There is no calibration required to perform the LipidPro lipid profile and glucose tests;
however, a lot specific code is provided with each test strip. Calibrations were done in-
house and parameters were coded into the test strip. The user must check and make
sure that the code number printed on the test strip vial matches the code number in the
LipidPro meter before testing.
Value assignment:
The value assignment of the LipidPro control solutions were determined by an in-house
procedure. The range of the control solutions was determined by assaying multiple
runs of the control solutions on ten LipidPro meters. For total cholesterol control
solution level 1 and 2, ranges were set at mean ± 20 mg/dL; for HDL-cholesterol
control solution level 1 and 2, ranges were set at mean ± 5 mg/dL; for triglyceride
control solution level 1 and 2, ranges were set at mean ± 20 mg/dL; for glucose control
solution level 1, 2 and 3, ranges were set at the following:
Glucose control Target Acceptable
solution level concentration range
Level 1 (low) 50 mg/dL Mean ± 15
mg/dL
Level 2 (medium) 100 mg/dL Mean ± 20%
Level 3 (high) 300 mg/dL Mean ± 15%
Real time stability was performed to assess the shelf-life and open-vial stability of the
control solutions and test strips for all the analytes measured (cholesterol, HDL-
cholesterol, triglyceride and glucose). Stability studies protocol and acceptance criteria
were provided and found to be adequate. The sponsor claimed that the unopened test
strips have a 12 month shelf-life and are stable for 3 months after first use when stored
at 2-8oC. Unopened control solutions have a 12 month shelf life and are stable for 3
months after first use when stored at 8-30oC.
d. Detection limit:
See linearity/reportable range study above.

e. Analytical specificity:
i.) Endogenous and exogenous interferent effects:
An interference study was conducted to determine the effect of common
interference substances based on the CLSI EP07-A guideline. Common interferences
were evaluated by spiking venous blood with different analyte concentrations. Each of
these concentrations was then spiked with the interfering compound at different
concentrations to make the interference samples. Three levels of glucose
concentrations (40, 160, and 320 mg/dL) and one level (around medical decisions
point) of total cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides were tested. The % bias was
calculated based on the differences between the spiked sample and the control
sample. The sponsor defined no significant interference (NI) as bias ≤ ±10 mg/dL
for glucose values < 75 mg/dL or ≤ ±10 % for glucose values ≥ 75 mg/dL for
glucose test; bias ≤ 15% for total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride. If
there is interference detected, the substance will be listed as an interference (I)
substance in the table below and in the package insert. Based on the data, the
sponsor claims no significant interference for the substances and concentrations

ii.) Hematocrit effect:
The sponsor evaluated the effect of hematocrit on EDTA whole blood samples
spiked with five hematocrit levels (20, 30, 40, 50, and 60%) at eight glucose
concentrations between 45 – 542 mg/dL. Each sample was tested 15 times on the
LipidPro meter. These values were compared to values from an YSI-2300 analyzer
of plasma glucose values at the hematocrit of 40% (reference method). The sponsor
defined no significant interference as bias of ≤± 15 mg/dL for glucose values <75
mg/dL and ≤± 15 % for glucose values ≥75 mg/dL.
The sponsor concluded that hematocrit between 30-55% range did not show any
significant hematocrit effect on the glucose results.
Another hematocrit study was performed using EDTA whole blood samples spiked
with six hematocrit levels (30, 35, 40, 45, 50, and 55%) at the following analytes
concentrations: Four levels of cholesterol (132-283 mg/dL), five levels of HDL-

cholesterol (25-65 mg/dL), and five levels of triglyceride (74-355 mg/dL). Each
sample was tested 15 times on the LipidPro meter. These values were compared to
values from the laboratory method of analytes values at the hematocrit of 40%
(reference method).
The sponsor concluded that hematocrit between 30-55% range did not show any
significant hematocrit effect (<5%) on the total-cholesterol, HDL, and triglyceride
results.
The sponsor states in their labeling that hematocrit levels less than 30% may cause
falsely high reading and hematocrit levels greater than 55% may cause falsely low
reading for all analytes.
iii.) Temperature and humidity studies were performed and showed that the device can
be used from 18 to 30oC (64-86oF) and from 10% to 90% relative humidity for all
analytes measured. An altitude study was performed and demonstrated that meter
performance for glucose was not significantly affected by altitudes ≤10,000 feet.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
i.) For LipidPro glucose test:
One forty-seven layusers performed a fingerstick test using the LipidPro glucose
measuring system (LipidPro meter and LipidPro glucose test strips). A healthcare
professional then performed the test on the LipidPro glucose measuring system and
the Evolution Blood Glucose Monitoring System (predicate device). A venous
sample was obtained and plasma samples from these patients were performed on
the Hitachi 747 analyzer (reference method). The range of glucose values for the
fingerstick samples was 58-488 mg/dL. In order to obtain sufficient samples in the
lowest and highest concentration intervals, 13 glucose concentrations were adjusted
by collecting blood in a heparin tube. Eight samples less than 50 mg/dL (33-48
mg/dL) were hydrolyzed and five samples greater than 400 mg/dL (511-563 mg/dL)
were spiked with glucose. The linear regressions were as follows:
Between the lay user’s finger-stick and the venous samples:
Patient’s results on LipidPro (Y) vs Hitachi 747 (X):
Y = 0.9989X + 3.3360, r2 = 0.9867, N= 160

Cholesterol Testing System. A healthcare professional then performed the test on
the LipidPro Total Cholesterol Testing System and the Cardiocheck System
(predicate device). A venous sample was obtained and plasma samples from these
patients were performed on the Architect c16000 analyzer (reference method). The
same test protocol was used for the HDL-Cholesterol and Triglyceride testing

iii.) Alternative testing sites for blood glucose measurement: Upper arm, forearm, calf,
thigh, ventral palm and dorsal hand testing has been performed by the patients and
the healthcare professionals to show comparable performance at times of steady
state conditions. A venous whole blood sample was drawn at the same time and
tested on the Hitachi 747 analyzer (comparative method). The range of glucose
values for these samples was 60-600 mg/dL (by the finger), N=150. The linear
regressions were as follows:

N. Instrument Name:
LipidPro™ meter
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings.
There are two separate test strip insertion ports. The glucose strip measurement connector
is at the top part of the meter and the lipid strip inserting part is at the bottom part of the
meter. The glucose sample volume is 0.3µl while the lipid sample volume is 5 µl.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ____X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly to
the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, ventral
palm, dorsal hand, forearm, upper arm, calf, and thigh only. The whole blood sample is
applied directly to the test strip by capillary action. Venous EDTA samples may be used by
the healthcare professionals.
The lipid tests are intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger. A
capillary rod is used to pick up the blood samples before applying onto the test strips.
Venous EDTA and heparin samples may be used by the healthcare professionals.
26

5. Calibration:
There is no calibration required for the LipidPro meter by the user; however, the user must
check to make sure the code number of the test strip matches the code number displays on
the meter before running any test. There are two ways to code the meter: The glucose test
strip has a color-tag at the back of the strip which enables the meter to recognize its code
number through the RFID tag on the meter. The lipid test strip has a RFID-tag on each test
strip’s vial which enables the meter to recognize its code.
The LipidPro glucose measuring test system is plasma-calibrated.
6. Quality Control:
Glucose control solutions at three different concentrations and lipids control solutions at
two different concentrations can be run with this device. The user must select the control
mode using the mode button to prevent control results from being stored in the internal
memory as patient result. The control solution readings are not included in the average of
the patient results. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial
label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these
ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. A usability study was performed to assess the readability of the labeling by recruiting 100
lay users (aged 18-70 yrs old) who were provided with the test kit containing labeling for
the US market. Participants varied in age, education, country of origin, and were about
evenly divided between men and women. These lay users also completed a questionnaire to
response to whether the device is easy to use and the Instructions for use were written in a
way that makes it easy to use. The sponsor concluded that 100% of the users responded
that both the device and Instructions for use were easy to use.
2. Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the sponsor concluded that a 7th
grader would be able to read all the package inserts and user manual according to the
Flesch-Kincaid grade levels.
3. Customer service is available 24/7, 365 days a year. Toll free phone number is 1-888-446-
3246 for customer support.
4. EMC testing was performed and passed by the SK TECH Co. and a certificate to Infopia
Co., was provided by the sponsor.
