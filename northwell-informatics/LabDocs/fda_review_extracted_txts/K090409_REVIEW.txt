Ed. (2005).
L. Test Principle:
The BioPlex 2200 HSV-1 & HSV-2 IgG kit is an automated system, it uses the
following procedure.
The kit contains two different populations of dyed beads are each coated with HSV 1
&2 gG1 and gG2 antigens. The BioPlex 2200 System combines an aliquot of patient
sample, sample diluent, and bead set reagent into a reaction vessel. The mixture is
incubated at 37°C. After a wash cycle, anti-human IgG antibody, conjugated to
phycoerythrin (PE), is added to the dyed beads and this mixture is incubated at 37°C.
The excess conjugate is removed in another wash cycle, and the beads are re-
suspended in wash buffer. The bead mixture then passes through the detector. The
identity of the dyed beads is determined by the fluorescence of the dyes, and the
amount of antibody captured by the antigen is determined by the fluorescence of the
attached PE. Raw data is calculated in relative fluorescence intensity (RFI).
Three additional dyed beads, an Internal Standard Bead (ISB), a Serum Verification
Bead (SVB) and a Reagent Blank Bead (RBB) are present in each reaction mixture to
verify detector response, the addition of serum to the reaction vessel and the absence
of significant non-specific binding in serum.
The instrument is calibrated using a set of 4 distinct calibrator vials, supplied
separately by Bio-Rad Laboratories. The 4 vials representing 4 different antibody
concentrations are used for calibration. The result for each of these antibodies is
expressed as an antibody index (AI).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A Precision panel, consisting of 8 panel members was prepared by Bio-Rad
Laboratories. For each analyte, 2 of the 8 panel members had high positive
levels of the antibodies, 2 had low positive levels of the antibodies, and 2 had
antibody levels near the cutoff; additionally there were 2 high negative panel
members.

Precision testing was performed at Bio-Rad Laboratories on one lot of the
HSV-1 & HSV-2 IgG Reagent Pack, one lot of the HSV-1 & HSV-2 IgG
Calibrator Set and one lot of the HSV-1 & HSV-2 IgG Control Set. Each of
the 8 panel members was tested in duplicate (x2) on 2 runs per day for 20 days
(2 times x 2 runs x 20 days = 80 replicates per panel member). The data were
analyzed for intra-assay and inter-assay precision according to the principles
described in the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute guidance EP5-A2,
revised November 2004. The standard deviation (SD) and percent coefficient
of variation (%CV) were calculated. Results are shown below.

The assays reproducibility was assessed at three sites using serum, EDTA and
heparinized plasma samples. A reproducibility panel was prepared at Bio-Rad
Laboratories and consisted of 8 panel members and the HSV-1 & HSV-2 IgG
positive control. Reproducibility testing was performed using 3 lots of the
HSV-1 & HSV-2 IgG Reagent Pack, 3 lots of the HSV-1 & HSV-2 IgG
Calibrator set and 3 lots of the HSV-1 & HSV-2 IgG Control set (one lot at
each site). Each of the reproducibility panel members were tested in duplicate
on two runs per day, for 5 days, on 3 lots (2 replicates x 2 runs x 5 days x 3
lots = 60 replicates per panel member). The data were analyzed for intra-assay

Potential cross-reactivity was evaluated as follows: Samples known to be
positive for one of the twenty potential cross-reactants, as determined by FDA
cleared devices, listed in the table below were evaluated with the BioPlex
2200 HSV-1 & HSV-2 IgG assays. All samples were pre-tested by a
commercially available HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG immunoblot assay and only
those that tested negative by the immunoblot assay were further tested by the
BioPlex 2200 HSV-1 & HSV-2 IgG kit. The results demonstrate that the
various disease state samples evaluated do not cross-react with the 2 antigens
in the BioPlex 2200 HSV-1 & HSV-2 IgG kit.

** Two Bacteroides sp. samples were identified HSV-2 equivocal and low positive with AI values of 1.0 and 1.1, respectively, by the BioPlex
2200 HSV-2 IgG assay.
N/A = Not available
Testing for interfering substances was conducted according to CLSI Protocol
EP7-A2 (Vol. 25, No. 27). Samples were pre-pared by blending a pool of
negative human serum with samples positive for HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG to
achieve values of 3.0 to 5.0 AI. Interferent or solvent (negative control) was
added exogenously at levels indicated in the Table below. Test and control
samples were evaluated in replicates of ten. Changes in signal ranged from -
8.3 to 10.3%. No significant interference was observed in any of the
substances tested.

f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off value and assignment of the calibrators were determined by
performing concordance and Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC)
analysis, using predicate results as the standard. Analyze-it software is used
for the ROC analysis.
Based on the results, calibrator values are adjusted such that the cut-off value
at time of market is equal to 1.0 AI for HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG assay. Samples
with AI values <0.9 are considered negative, samples with AI values >1.1 AI
are considered positive while samples with an AI value between >0.9 and
<1.1 are considered equivocal. Testing was conducted internally at Bio-Rad
Laboratories.
A total of 662 samples were evaluated to confirm cut-off values established in
early development. All samples were confirmed positive, negative or
equivocal by the Focus HerpeSelect®1 and HerpeSelect®2 ELISA IgG
predicate kits. ROC Analysis was performed for each analyte using this
population of samples.
BioPlex 2200 HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG assays met or exceeded the
concordance requirements of ≥ 96% and ≥ 94% positive agreement as well as
≥ 95 and ≥ 97%% negative agreement respectively. The results of
concordance testing and ROC analysis validate the cut-off that was
established for each of the analytes in the BioPlex HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG
assays.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with reference method:
Performance of the BioPlex 2200 HSV-1 & HSV-2 IgG kit in the intended use
populations was tested against a commercially available immunoblot test in a
prospective study conducted at a total of 3 U.S. clinical sites. For purposes of
sensitivity and specificity calculations, the BioPlex 2200 equivocal results were

assigned to the opposite clinical interpretation than that of the corresponding
immunoblot result. Likewise, immunoblot equivocal results were assigned to the
opposite clinical interpretation than that of the BioPlex 2200 result.
Performance in Sexually Active Individuals
The sensitivity and specificity of the HSV-1 & HSV-2 IgG kit was assessed using
leftover serum samples from sexually active individuals where an HSV-1 test was
ordered (N=289) and sexually active individuals where an HSV-2 test was ordered
(N=286). Samples were tested at 3 U.S. clinical sites. Combined results from all
sites are shown in the Tables below.

Performance in a Low Prevalence Population
The sensitivity and specificity of the HSV-1 & HSV-2 IgG kit was assessed using
leftover serum samples from a low-prevalence population, collected in a non-STD
setting, in people age 16-19 (N=200). Samples were tested at 2 U.S. clinical testing
sites. Results are shown in the following tables.

b. Matrix comparison:
Matched serum and plasma (EDTA and heparin) samples drawn from 87 individual
donors were acquired from commercial sources. All samples were evaluated in
replicates of two. Plasma AI values were compared to matched serum AI values.
All samples correlated well, the corresponding slopes of regression and square of
correlation (R2) was 0.99.

individuals where an HSV-1 test was ordered (N=289); sexually active individuals
where an HSV-2 test was ordered (N=286); and for expectant mothers (N=399).
The observed and the hypothetical positive and negative predicted values were also
calculated for HSV1 &2 in both of the study populations.
