I. Device Description:
1. HemosIL® INR Validate: the control set consists of three-levels of lyophilized
citrated control plasmas which have assigned INR reference values in the range of
1.6 - 5.0. Level 1 has an INR range of 1.6 - 2.4, Level 2 of 2.5 - 3.5, and Level 3 of
3.8 - 5.0. The reference INR values for each level are reagent-specific for the IL
coagulation systems. The plasmas are collected from human donors on stable anti-
vitamin K therapy. The INRs are monitored by running the controls on a local
instrument/reagent system using the laboratory’s locally established lot-specific
MNPT and manufacturer’s lot-specific ISI value.
2. HemosIL® ISI Calibrate: The calibrator set contains four-levels of lyophilized
citrated calibration plasmas which have assigned INR reference values in the range
of 0.9 – 5.0. Level A has an INR range of 0.9 – 1.1, Level B of 1.6 – 2.4, Level C
of 2.5 – 3.5, and Level D of 3.8 – 5.0. The reference INR values for each level are
reagent-specific for the IL coagulation systems. Level A is collected from normal
human pool. Levels B, C, and D are collected from a pool of human donors on
stable anti-vitamin K therapy.
3. ISIweb: ISIweb is a web-based service for customers used in conjunction with
designated HemosIL PT reagents on IL coagulation systems, whereby the PT and
INR results can be entered and calculated.

CLSI H54-A: Procedure for validation of INR and Local Calibration of PT/INR
Systems; Approved Guideline.
L. Test Principle:
HemosIL® INR Validate:
As determined through the ISIweb software, the PT/INR system is verified if the mean
INRs of all controls are within of ± 15% of their assigned INR reference values.
If the mean INRs of all the controls are within ± 15% of their assigned INR reference
values, the PT/INR system is verified. If the mean INRs of the controls are not within
± 15% of their assigned INR reference values, a new local ISI calibration is
recommended using the HemosIL ISI calibrate set. The new local ISI and MNPT is
verified by re-running the HemosIL INR Validate controls on the same
instrument/reagent system with the local ISI and MNPT
HemosIL® ISI Calibrate:
To establish a local ISI, the calibrate plasmas are run on the IL instrument/reagent
system. The PT (second) data is entered into the ISIweb, which will generate a
calibration curve from the PT and the INR reference values by plotting an orthogonal
regression of LogINR (x-axis) vs. LogPT (y-axis). From the slope and y-intercept of
the curve, the ISI and MNPT are derived as follows:
ISI = 1/slope MNPT = 10 y-intercept
ISIweb:
When used in conjunction with HemosIL Validate, the mean INR for each control level
will be automatically calculated by ISIweb. The ISIweb will verify whether the mean
INR for each level of control is within ± 15% of the assigned INR reference values.
When used in conjunction with HemosIL ISI Calibrate, the mean PT and % CV value
of each calibrator level is automatically calculated by the ISIweb software. For each
level of the calibrator, if the % CV passes specification, ISIweb generates a calibration
curve from the PT and INR reference values by plotting an orthogonal regression of
LogINR (x-axis) vs. LogPT (y-axis).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The traceability of the tri-level HemosIL Validate and the four-
level HemosIL Calibrate with INR reference values are summarized as follows:
The House Standard ISI Calibrate INR reference value is derived from the
mean INR reference values from combined sources of >200 laboratories and
three WHO laboratories. At the WHO laboratories, Human IRP (RTF/95) and
Rabbit IRP (RBT/05) were used. The House Standard ISI/MNPT for each
instrument/reagent combination are derived from House Standard Calibration
curves using the House Standard ISI Calibrate reference INR values and PT
(seconds). Reagent-specific INR reference values for each production lot of
HemosIL Calibrate and HemosIL Validate are calculated from the mean PT
(seconds) and the House Standard ISI/MNPT on the same instrument/reagent
combinations as the assignment of the House Standard ISI and MNPT.
Stability:
Reconstituted stability studies were performed to support the reconstituted
stability for the HemosIL Validate and HemosIL Calibrate. Two lots were
used in the studies for each device. At different time intervals, the stored
control and calibrator levels were analyzed in a minimum of four replicates
and the mean results were compared to the Time 0 mean results.
- 8 hours at 2-8º C in the original vial
- 30 days at -20º C in the original vial
- 4 hours at 15-25º C on-board IL Coagulation System
A shelf life stability study is ongoing at 2-8º C using three different lots of
HemosIL Validate and HemosIL Calibrate plasmas. At different time
intervals, the plasmas were run in a minimum of four replicates using the
representative IL instrument/PT reagent combinations. The results were
compared to the Time 0 mean results. The package insert instructs the end
user to use the expiration date as shown on the vial. The results to date are
within acceptable limits of ± 10% difference from Time 0 mean results.
