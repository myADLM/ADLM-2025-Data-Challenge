L. Test Principle:
Proteins contained in human body fluids form immune complexes in an
immunochemical reaction with specific antibodies. These complexes scatter a beam
of light passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional
to the concentration of the respective protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by
comparison with a standard of known concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing was performed in accordance with CLSI EP5-A2,
using ANOVA method. Specimens at each level were analyzed in duplicate,
twice a day, for 20 days, (n=80).

Dimension Vista IgA
To assess precision of the extended lower assay range, two low serum pool
samples (0.09 g/L and 0.22 g/L) were evaluated. Precision results were
summarized below:
Mean Standard Deviation mg/dL [g/L] (% CV)
Material mg/dL [g/L] Repeatability Within-Lab
Serum pool low 9.0 [0.09] 0.2 [0.002] (2.5) 0.3 [0.003] (2.9)
Serum pool low 22.0 [0.22] 0.3 [0.003] (1.5) 0.4 [0.004] (1.7)
Dimension Vista IgM
To assess precision of the extended lower assay range, two low serum pool
samples (0.093 g/L and 0.176 g/L) were evaluated. Results are summarized
below:
Mean Standard Deviation mg/dL [g/L] (% CV)
Material mg/dL [g/L] Repeatability Within-Lab
Serum pool low 9.3 [0.093] 0.2 [0.002] (1.9) 0.2 [0.002] (2.0)
Serum pool low 17.6 [0.176] 0.4 [0.004] (2.3) 0.4 [0.004] (2.5)
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Data were analyzed in accordance to CLSI EP06-A.
Linearity across the lower extended range was confirmed by testing one
human serum sample containing 1.42g/L IgA and one human serum sample
containing 0.42g/L IgM. Each sample was serially diluted 12 times. Each
dilution was tested in replicates of five. All dilutions met the acceptance
criteria of 15% or less difference between the measured and expected
concentrations.
The IgA new extended range is 0.063 g/L to 7.50 g/L
The IgM new extended range is 0.053 g/L to 6.40 g/L
Hook Effect:
Same as k061338 (IgA) and k061845 (IgM).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Same as k061338 (IgA) and k061845 (IgM)
d. Detection limit:
Data were analyzed according to EP17-A with allowable total error of 30%.
The Limit of Quantitation (LOQ) is the lowest amount of analyte that can be
quantitatively determined within a defined total error. The value was
calculated as the mean value of fifteen replicates of three human serum
samples and sample diluent. The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined
to be 0.063 g/L for IgA and 0.053 g/L for IgM.
e. Analytical specificity:
Same as k061338 (IgA) and k061845 (IgM).
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison studies for both Flex cartridges were done according
to EP9-A2. To support the extended range, the Dimension Vista® IgA and
IgM assays were compared to N Antiserum to Human IgA and N Antiserum
to Human IgM, respectively, on the BN ProSpec® System. Serum samples at
the extended low end of the assay range with concentrations ranging from
0.062 to 0.246 g/L (IgA) and 0.052 to 0.200 g/L (IgM). Regression analysis
of these results yielded the following equations:
