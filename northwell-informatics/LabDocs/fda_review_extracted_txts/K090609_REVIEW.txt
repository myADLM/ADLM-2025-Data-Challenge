L. Test Principle:
The test is based on electrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of capillary
action. The electrical current generated by the reaction of glucose with the reagent of the
strip is measured by the meter and is displayed as the corresponding blood glucose level.
The strength of the current produced by the reaction depends on the amount of glucose in
the blood sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run and between-run precision studies were performed according to the CLSI
EP5-A: Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods;
Approved Guideline – Second Edition, guideline.
For the within-run precision studies 10 replicates of each of 5 spiked venous whole
blood glucose levels (hematocrit of 35 to 50%) and 2 levels of control solutions
(Normal and High), were analyzed using 10 meters, and three lots of each OKmeter
Match blood glucose test strips (A and B). These tests were performed in one day,
for a total of 100 test per each glucose level. Results are summarized below.

y = 0.9908x + 3.9828; R2 = 0.9991 for Test Strip B
The claimed range of measurement for this device is 25 to 580 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The device showed traceability to a laboratory analyzer, YSI 2300 in the method
comparison studies in 2.a. below.
Two levels of control material, OKmeter Control solution normal (100 mg/dL) and
OKmeter Control solution high (300 mg/dL), are available for use with this test
system. One level, the normal level, is provided with the meter. Shelf life and open
vial stability were evaluated at 10-40ºC using 3 lots of each control solution. The
results support the 18 month shelf life and the 90 day open vial stability claims.
Real-time stability studies demonstrated that the test strips, OKmeter Match test strips
A and B, have a 24 month unopened shelf life and a 3 month shelf life once opened.
The recommended storage temperature is 39 to 86°F (4 to 30°C) and below 85%
humidity.
c. Detection limit:
The reportable range is 25 to 580 mg/dL based on linearity/reportable range studies
above (section M.1.b.).
d. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor tested substances for interference using two test strips, A and B (3 lots of
each), 10 meters, and 3 levels of glucose (achieved by adding 50-100, 200-275, and
400-500 mg/dL glucose to human venous blood). Samples were then spiked with the
following interfering substances. Each sample was analyzed 20 times. The labeling
states that elevated concentration of the following substances may affect test results.
The following table lists the concentration of each substance at which no significant
interference (≤ 10%) was detected:

Hematocrit study:
The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated on the OKmeter Match blood
glucose monitoring system with 3 lots of each test strip (A and B) using 20 samples at
each of 6 concentration ranges of glucose (30, 85, 150, 300, 400, 500 mg/dL). The
glucose samples were prepared from venous blood samples at 5 hematocrit levels at
approximately 20, 30, 45, 50 and 55%. In total 100 measurements were made and
each of the results compared to the value obtained from the same plasma glucose
concentration obtained by YSI. The % bias did not exceed ±15 mg/dL for glucose
values <75 mg/dL and did not exceed ±15% for glucose concentrations ≥75 mg/dL for
hematocrit concentrations within the claimed range of 20 to 55%.
Altitude study:
Five whole blood samples with glucose concentrations ranging from 50 to 400 mg/dL
were tested at 91, 890, 1460, 1900, 2610, 3402 meters (3402 meters ~ 11,161 feet).
Each glucose concentration range was measured 6 times at each altitude. The bias
was calculated relative to the results obtained at the local altitude (91 meters).
The results demonstrate that the system meets the accuracy acceptance criteria for
testing at altitudes up to 3402 meters (11,161 feet) with biases less than ±15 mg/dL for
samples ≤75 mg/dL, and less than 10% for samples containing >75 mg/dL glucose.
Temperature and humidity studies:
The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies that demonstrated that the
OKmeter Match system (with both strips A and B) can be used at temperatures of 50
to 104°F (10 to 40°C) and <85% relative humidity, and stored at temperatures of 39
to 86°F (4 to 30°C) and < 85% humidity.

Not Applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Reference Method Comparison:
The sponsor performed a system accuracy evaluation comparing the
OKmeter Match to YSI. Healthcare professionals tested 100 capillary samples in 5
concentration categories (<50, 50-80, 80-120, 120-200, 201-300, 301-400, and >400
mg/dL) per strip, using 2 meters and 3 lots of each test strip using the OKmeter
Match and the YSI (the reference method). Results are summarized below.

Fingerstick and Alternate Site Testing Comparison Studies:
The sponsor performed a lay-user study where accuracy of the device was tested
using 160 fingerstick samples obtained by the lay-user and 110 samples per each
alternative site (the palm, the forearm, the upper arm, the calf and the thigh) obtained
by the lay-user. Participants, who were able to read the User’s Manual in English,
were instructed to read the manual and perform testing on the finger and then the
alternative sites. A technician drew venous blood for measurements on YSI. Results
were obtained for each of the alternative sites using each of the strips (test strip A and
B). Samples ranged from 60 to 450 mg/dL. Results are summarized below.

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer,
webserver, or mobile device?:
Yes or No __ X___.
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?:
Yes or No __ X___.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes
for this line of product types:
Yes X or No .
The applicant has provided documentation that indicates the device was designed and
developed under good software life-cycle processes.
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied
directly to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, palm,
forearm, calf, and thigh. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test
strip there are no special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
The meter is a non-coding meter, therefore no coding is required by the user.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor provides one level of glucose control solution, normal, with this device.
Two levels, normal and high, are available for purchase separately, as stated in the
labeling. To perform a control test the user is instructed to press the “M” button
while the blood drop symbol is flashing. The control bottle symbol will then appear
on the display which means that the results will not be stored in memory. An
acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. If the
control values fall outside these ranges, the user is referred to the user manual and
customer support for problems and more information
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
The sponsor provided a readability study and obtained Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Scores
of 7.4 to 7.8 for the OKmeter Match User’s Manual, test strip insert and control solution
insert.
