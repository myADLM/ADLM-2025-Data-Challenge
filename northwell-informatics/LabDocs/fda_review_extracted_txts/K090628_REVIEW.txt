L. Test Principle:
Once a whole blood sample is applied to the sample chamber of the test strip, glucose
measurement commences. Glucose measurement is based on electrical potential caused by
the reaction of glucose with the reagents contained on the strip’s electrodes. The current
resulting from this enzymatic reaction is measured and converted to glucose concentration by
the meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Venous blood (hematocrit value of 45%+/-1%) was tested at five glucose concentration
ranges: 30 – 50, 51 – 110, 111 – 150, 151 – 250 and 251 – 400mg/dL. Ten DIDGET
meters with 10 replicates per meter (n=100) were used. The glucose concentration of
each sample was checked by reference method immediately before the first and after the
last measurement of meters. The within-run precision for all meters and concentrations
tested were as follows:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The assay measuring range of the device is 20 – 600 mg/dL. The sponsor conducted
linearity studies to demonstrate that glucose measurements using their device are linear.
Venous whole blood was collected and glucose adjusted to 7 concentration levels (0,
20, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 550 mg/dL). Eight DIDGET meters were tested at each
glucose concentration with 3 replicates. The linear regression line for three lots was: y
= 0.994(x) + 0.0492, r2 = 0.999.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Shelf life studies show that control solutions have a twenty-four month life-span and
a six month shelf-life once control solution bottle is opened. The recommended
storage temperature is 59° F - 86° F. Traceability for controls is referenced to the NIST
SRM 917a (dry D-glucose).
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit is 20 mg/dL as supported by the linearity study described above.
e. Analytical specificity:
The interference studies including hematocrit effect for blood glucose measurement
were established in the sponsor’s predicate device (Contour Glucose Monitor –
k062058) that uses the same glucose test system.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed with 123 subjects between the ages of 4

and 24 years. Capillary finger-stick testing was done where participants aged 8 and
above tested themselves and the parent/guardian assisted with, or performed, testing
for participants ages 4 to 7. The distribution of gender, diabetes type, and age for all
123 subjects were as follows.
Gender Number % of Total
Male 54 58
Female 69 42
Diabetes Number % of Total

18 - 24 52 42.28
Of the 123 subjects used, 2 samples were excluded from testing as there were no YSI
results. The range of concentrations of 121 samples was 53 – 463 mg/dL by the
reference method. The linear regression line for the accuracy study was, y = 0.99x –
0.72, r2 = 0.969. The accuracy for DIDGET meter vs. YSI in the format of ISO
15197 is given below.
Fingerstick accuracy for glucose concentrations < 75 mg/dL:

(52.68%) (80.36%) (90.18%)
The glucose distribution of natural capillary samples did not cover the entire assay
measuring range of the device. In order to achieve glucose concentrations across the
entire measuring range of the meter, 47 venous blood samples were spiked or
glycolyzed to obtain high or low glucose concentrations for testing. The range of
concentrations for all 168 samples (capillary and modified) was 25 – 563 mg/dL by
the reference method. The linear regression line for the accuracy study was, y =
1.02x – 3.43, r2 = 0.981. The accuracy for DIDGET meter vs. YSI in the format of
ISO 15197 is given below.

to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger tip only.
Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip, there are no special
handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
No calibration is required from the user. The meter accommodates auto-coding, in that
each strip is designed and manufactured to code the meter appropriately when the strip is
inserted.
6. Quality Control:
Three levels of control are supplied with the device. Users are instructed to test control
solutions when the meter is first used in order to verify that they can use the meter
correctly. In addition they are instructed to run a control when a new vial of test strips is
opened, when they suspect the meter or strips are not working correctly, if test results
appear to be abnormally high or low, or are not consistent with the patient's symptoms.
The user is referred to the troubleshooting section of the owner’s manual if control results fall
outside the assigned ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
The sponsor performed a readability assessment of the labeling and the lay user instructions
are at 7.5 grade level or below.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
