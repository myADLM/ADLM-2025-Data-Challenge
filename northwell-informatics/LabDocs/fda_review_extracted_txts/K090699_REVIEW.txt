L. Test Principle:
The candidate device is a well established method of measuring the level of HbA in
1c
the red blood cell. The candidate device is based on chromatographic separation of
HbA on a cation exchange cartridge. The various forms of hemoglobin exhibit
1c
charge differences (positive) at the acidic pH of the mobile phase, and thus can be
separated on a support that is negatively charged (cation exchange). The use of ion-
exchange chromatography then allows molecules to be separated based upon a
molecule's charge. Separation is optimized to minimize interferences from
hemoglobin variants (HbS, HbC, HbD and HbE trait), labile A , hemoglobin F and
1c
carbamylated hemoglobin.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the proposed device was evaluated using a protocol based on
the CLSI EP5-A2 guideline. Normal patient, normal control, diabetic patient
and diabetic control samples were run in the precision study. The precision
study was performed on 6 instruments in 3 laboratories over 10 days. Each
site was provided with the same sample set and directed to perform 2
replicates of each sample on each of 2 runs/day (morning and evening) for 10
days. Each site conducted the study on 2 instruments. The position of the
precision specimens in each run was randomized. The results were analyzed
by nested Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with the hierarchical levels of labs,
instruments, days, and runs. Patient samples are EDTA human whole blood.
The results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The study was performed following the CLSI EP6-A guideline. Linearity
across the reportable range was performed using low (2.5% HbA ) and high
1c
(19.6% HbA ) EDTA whole blood patient samples. These were mixed
1c
together in varying ratios. The measured values were compared to the
theoretical values based upon the dilution factor. Polynomial regression
analysis (for first, second, and third order polynomials) were performed to
determine the statistical significance of non-linearity. The higher order
coefficients were found not to be significant and linearity was demonstrated.
The measured results for each dilution were within a maximum difference of
0.24% in this range. The results are summarized below:
% A (theoretical) Predicted 1st order Predicted 3rd order Difference

17.61 17.61 17.52 0.09
19.60 19.56 19.63 -0.07
The reportable range of the device is 3.5 to 19.0 % HbA .

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators were previously cleared in k070452. The recommended control
materials were cleared in k070546 and k052838.
The proposed device has been certified by the National Glycohemoglobin
Standardization Program (NGSP) as having documented traceability to the
Diabetes Control and Complications Trial reference method.

e. Analytical specificity:
Icterus (bilirubin) and lipemia (triglyceride) interference: Two EDTA whole
blood patient samples representing normal and diabetic HbA samples were
1c
split into aliquots and treated with increasing concentrations of triglycerides
and bilirubin. The treated and untreated samples were run in duplicate on a
VARIANT II TURBO Hemoglobin Testing System and the differences in %
HbA between the samples were analyzed. Bilirubin up to 20mg/dL and
1c
triglycerides up to 6000 mg/dL had no significant effect on HbA
1c
determination.
EDTA interference: In order to determine the effect of high concentrations of
EDTA that can occur in cases of “short draws”, 2 whole blood patient samples
representing normal and diabetic HbA samples were split into aliquots and
1c
treated with 11 times (11X) the expected EDTA concentration in samples.
The treated and untreated samples were run in duplicate on a VARIANT II
TURBO Hemoglobin Testing System and the differences in % HbA between
1c
the samples were analyzed. EDTA, up to 11X had no significant effect on
HbA determination.
1c
Labile A (LA ) interference: Two EDTA whole blood patient samples
1c 1c
representing normal and diabetic HbA samples were split into aliquots and
1c
treated with increasing concentrations of a glucose solution (up to 1000
mg/dL) and incubated for 3 hours at 37 °C to facilitate the formation of LA .
1c
The treated samples and untreated control samples were run in duplicate on
two VARIANT II TURBO Hemoglobin Testing Systems and the differences
in % HbA between the samples were analyzed. LA up to 6% had no
1c 1c
significant effect on HbA determination.
1c
Carbamylated hemoglobin interference: A series of EDTA whole blood
patient samples representing normal and diabetic HbA were prepared with
1c
varying concentrations of a high carbamylated hemoglobin solution (prepared
by treating the red blood cells of a normal patient sample and a diabetic
patient sample with 2.6 mM potassium cyanate at 37 °C for 45 minutes until
the carbamylated hemoglobin level increased to 6%). The carbamylated-
containing samples and the control samples were run in duplicate on a
VARIANT II TURBO Hemoglobin Testing System and the differences in %
HbA between the samples were analyzed. Carbamylated hemoglobin up to
1c
4% had no significant effect on HbA determination.
1c
Hemoglobin F (HbF) Interference: A series of EDTA whole blood patient
samples representing normal and diabetic HbA were prepared with varying
1c
concentrations of a high HbF (>25 %) solution. The treated samples and
untreated control samples were run in duplicate on two VARIANT II TURBO

--- Page 7 ---
Hemoglobin Testing Systems and the differences in % HbA between the
1c
samples were analyzed. HbF up to 25% had no significant effect on HbA
1c
determination.
Hemoglobin Variant Interferences: Hemoglobin AD, AE, AS and AC-trait
patient samples (20 of each) with HbA values distributed across the non-
1c
diabetic and diabetic range were analyzed by the proposed device in replicates
of four and compared to values obtained by a NGSP secondary Reference
Laboratory using a boronate affinitity method. Two out of 7 hemoglobin AD-
trait, 2 out of 11 hemoglobin AS-trait, 1 out of 11 hemoglobin AE-trait and 3
out of 9 hemoglobin AC-trait patient samples within the clinically significant
range of 6% and 9% HbA tested exhibited differences of more than ± 10%
1c
from values obtained using the reference method.
The sponsor includes the following statements in the product insert:
• Icterus, as indicated by bilirubin concentrations up to 20 mg/dL, does
not interfere with the assay.
• Lipemia, as indicated by testing a normal and a diabetic sample spiked
with a lipemic clinical serum sample to achieve triglyceride
concentrations up to 6000 mg/dL, does not interfere with the assay.
• Carbamylated hemoglobin concentrations up to 4% do no interfere
with the assay.
• Hemoglobin F concentrations up to 25% do not interfere with the
assay. In cases where hemoglobin F concentrations are greater than
25% , the % A should not be reported.
1c
• In a study to assess interference form hemoglobin variants, 2 out of 7
hemoglobin AD-trait, 2 out of 11 hemoglobin AS-trait, 1 out of 11
hemoglobin AE-trait and 3 out of 9 hemoglobin AC-trait patient
samples within the clinically significant range of 6% and 9% HbA
1c
tested exhibited differences of more than ± 10% from values obtained
using the reference method. Laboratories should take this into
consideration when evaluating results from patients with a hemoglobin
variant trait.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To demonstrate accuracy across the measuring range of 3.5 to 19% HbA , the
1c
proposed device was compared to the predicate using 40 EDTA whole blood
patient samples and 12 spiked EDTA whole blood samples. The samples
were run in singlicate on the proposed device and on the predicate device. A
linear regression analysis of the results calculated a slope of 0.9621, an
