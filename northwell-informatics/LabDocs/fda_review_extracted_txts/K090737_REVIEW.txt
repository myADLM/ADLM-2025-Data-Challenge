b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity across the assay range was confirmed by inter mixing the level 1
sample of the Bio-Rad Lyphochek hemoglobin A1c linearity set (~ 3.5%
HbA1c) with a high patient sample (~ 18.5% HbA1c) creating three pooled
sample sets each with 5 levels of HbA1c. One set of samples was diluted with
the Hemoglobin Capillary Collection System (HCCS) reagent and two other
sets of samples were diluted with the Wash/Diluent solutions one with the
VARIANT II and the other with the D-10 Hemoglobin Testing Systems. Each
sample was tested in duplicate on each system. Results are presented below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor has documented traceability to the NGSP’s recommended accuracy
base for HbA1c by performing a direct comparison with a Secondary Reference
Laboratory (SRL) using 40 fresh human specimens. At this time, the assay is
NGSP certified. However, NGSP certification expires at the end of one year. For
current certifications see the NGSP website at:
http://www.ngsp.org/prog/index2.html
Accelerated stability studies have been conducted. Protocols and acceptance
criteria were described and found to be acceptable. When stored at room
temperature the shelf life of the HCCS device is 24 months.
Stability of whole blood samples prepared with the Hemoglobin Capillary
Collection System (HCCS) has been conducted. Protocols and acceptance
criteria were described and found to be acceptable. Samples when stored at 2-
8°C are stable for 4 weeks, 15-30°C stable for 2 weeks and 42°C stable for 4
days.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range for the VARIANT II is 3.1 to 18.5% HbA1c and the D-10 is
3.8 to 18.5% HbA1c. See the linearity study above for data on recovery of
samples across the measuring range.
e. Analytical specificity:
A study was conducted to determine if the level of interference for Liable A1c
and Carbamylated Hemoglobin in patient samples differs when diluting
samples using the HCCS to diluting the sample with Wash/Diluent for the
VARIANT II and D-10 Hemoglobin A1c Programs. Two venous whole blood
samples representing normal and diabetic A1c levels were split into 2aliquots.
One aliquot of each pool was treated to elevate the Labile A1c. The other
aliquot was treated to elevate the Carbamyated Hemoglobin. Next set was
diluted using the HCCS reagent and the other with the Wash/Diluent solution
of the assay being studied. Samples and controls were run in duplicate on each
system. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria states that the %difference of
HbA1c for samples diluted with HCCS method as compared to samples
diluted with Wash/Diluent Solution must be less than < 0.3 % HbA1c for
normal samples and < 0.5 % HbA1c for diabetic samples. The study showed
that these criteria were met.

--- Page 7 ---
To evaluate the effect on hemoglobin variants such as Hb S, C, D and E when
tested using the Hemoglobin Capillary Collection System (HCCS), samples
with known hemoglobin variants were tested. One sample was prepared using
the Wash/Diluent solution (control) and one using the HCCS device
(candidate). The sponsor’s acceptance criterion required that the %difference
of HbA1c between the control and the candidate devices were within +/- 0.2
% HbA1c. The studies found that samples containing HbS, HbC, HbD and
HbE showed no significant interference.
