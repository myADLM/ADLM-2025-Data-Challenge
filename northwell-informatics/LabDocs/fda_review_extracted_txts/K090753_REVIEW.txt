L. Test Principle:
The TheraTest EL anti-CCP2 assay is a solid phase enzyme immunoassays in a 96-
well plate format for the measurement of antibodies against CCP. Wells are
incubated with diluted samples, calibrators, and positive and negative controls.
During the incubation, anti-CCP antibodies, if present in the test sample, bind to the
solid phase antigen. The wells are washed, and isotype-specific horseradish
peroxidase labeled anti-human immunoglobulin antibody (enzyme conjugate) is
added. After incubating the wells with the enzyme conjugate, unbound labeled
antibody is removed by washing. A chromogenic substrate solution is added to the
wells, and the presence of antibodies to CCP is detected by a color change. The
intensity of the color is proportional to the amount of the bound antibody and is read
by an ELISA reader. The absorbance value in the blank well (incubated with
specimen diluent) is subtracted from the values obtained with samples, calibrators and
controls.
In the semi-quantitative mode, the absorbance of the sample is converted to a relative
2

value based on the standard curve generated by the calibrators. If the specimen's
measured absorbance value exceeds that of the highest Calibrator the result is
reported as > 128U/mL. In the qualitative mode, the result is based on a ratio of the
sample to the cut-off calibrator.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The between-run (total) precision and within-run precision across the assay
range was measured by testing 8 specimens in triplicates in 20 separate
assays, one or two assays per day. Precision was calculated by the Analyze-it
for Microsoft Excel software, and results are presented in the following table:
Sample Mean Within-run Between-run
(U/mL) CV% CV%
1 3.2 6.3 9.0
2 4.1 4.2 6.2
3 7.6 4.5 6.5
4 15.5 3.6 5.5
5 21.3 4.1 5.7
6 35.4 4.8 8.4
7 56.4 4.3 6.6
8 100.6 4.1 8.9
Raw data results from the same specimens were analyzed according to the
qualitative calculation described in the package insert are presented in the
following table:
Sample Quantitative Target Obtained Qualitative Result
Result Qualitative (n=60)
(U/mL) Result
+ equivocal -
1 3.2 - 0 0 60
2 4.1 - 0 0 60

6 35.4 + 60 0 0
7 56.4 + 60 0 0
8 100.6 + 60 0 0
The sponsor recommends that equivocal samples be reported as equivocal and
the patient be re-tested with a fresh sample.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor presented two studies to support the claimed range of Limit of
Detection to 128 U/mL for the EL-anti-CCP/2 assay.

In the first study, the highest calibrator (Calibrator 5) and two other specimens
positive for anti-CCP (at two levels) were each diluted with Zero Calibrator in
five dilutions, from 1:1 to 1:20 and tested in duplicate using the semi-
quantitative method. Results from these three specimens were pooled
together and regression analysis using data points above the Limit of
Detection (LoD) was performed to yield: y = 1.001x + 1.499, R2 = 0.988.
Samples ranged from 2.6 - 123.2 Units/ml.
An additional three specimens positive for anti-CCP were each diluted with
Zero Calibrator in ten dilutions, from 1:1 to 1:10 and tested in duplicate using
the semi-quantitative method. Results from these three specimens were
pooled together and regression analysis using data points above the LoD was
performed to yield: y = 1.021x + 2.014, R2 = 0.985. Samples ranged from 3.7
- 109.5 Units/mL and sample recovery ranged from 97 - 126%.
The sponsor presented a study that supported the claim that there is no hook
effect up to approximately 1700 U/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There is no accepted reference standard for anti-CCP. Each lot of assay
calibrators is traceable to an internal master calibrator and is validated to
determine if they fall within a pre-determined acceptable range. A high
positive clinical sample is selected as a control. It is validated against the
standard curve and against the curve generated with the new calibrators and
must fall within a pre-determined acceptable range. The sponsor has
performed real-time stability testing on unopened kits that supports a claim of
12 months at 4°C.
d. Detection limit:
The studies of the assay detection limits were based on CLSI EP17-A
“Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of
Quantitation; Approved Guideline.” The Limit of Blank (LoB) was
determined from 60 readings of one blank sample. The measurements were
organized according to their value to determine the LoB as the 95th percentile
of the blank distribution. The LoB was determined to be 0.0465 Units/mL.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined by calculating the SD from 60
S
results obtained from repeated readings of 5 low concentration samples. The
pooled estimate from repeated measurements was SD = 0.054. The LoD was
S
calculated as 0.135 Units/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The analytical specificity of this assay was determined in k023285.
Potential interference from anti-Rheumatoid Factor IgM and anti-dsDNA
antibodies was determined by spiking normal and anti-CCP2 positive clinical
specimens with the other autoantibodies. No significant (±10%) interference
was shown by anti-dsDNA levels of 630 IU/mL and anti-RF IgM
concentration of 256 IU/mL. The sponsor did not evaluate the effect of other
4

endogenous or exogenous substances on the performance of the assays. The
package insert contains a caution not to use hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric
samples.
f. Assay cut-off:
A cut-off of 5 U/mL was validated by determining the anti-CCP value of 100
blood bank donors (51 female, 49 males). The values were ranked in
descending order; only one donor was ≥ 5 U/mL. Therefore the sponsor
determined that the upper level of normal was 5 units and set this as the cut-
off. Based on the results of the imprecision studies of samples around the cut-
off (see above), the sponsor established an equivocal zone at 6 U/mL.
Test Negative Equivocal Positive
Semi-quantitative (U/mL) < 5 > 5 - < 7 > 7
Qualitative (ratio) < 1.0 > 1.0 - < 1.4 > 1.4
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The TheraTest EL-anti-CCP/2 assay was compared to another commercially
available ELISA anti-CCP test using a total of 319 specimens: 100 Blood
Bank Donors, 119 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as diagnosed by
American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, and 100 patient samples
referred by a rheumatologist to a reference lab for anti-CCP testing. Samples
below the LoD and above the upper limit of claimed linearity were excluded
from method comparison analysis leaving 177 samples for comparison:
Predicate Device
Positive Negative Total
EL anti-CCP2 Positive 46 3 49
Equivocal 2 1 3
Negative 0 125 125
Total 48 129 177
Equivocal results are treated as positive:
Positive Percent Agreement = 100% (48/48) 95% CI: 93 - 100
Negative Percent Agreement = 97% (125/129) 95% CI: 92 - 99
Total Percent Agreement = 98% (173/177) 95% CI: 94 - 99
Equivocal results are treated as negative:
Positive Percent Agreement = 96% (46/48) 95% CI: 86 - 99
Negative Percent Agreement = 98% (126/129) 95% CI: 93 - 100
Total Percent Agreement = 97% (172/177) 95% CI: 94 - 99
b. Matrix comparison:
Serum is the only sample type claimed. The user is so advised in the package
insert.

a. Clinical Sensitivity:
The sponsor makes no claim of clinical sensitivity. Claims of clinical
sensitivity should be supported by comparing test performance to known
clinical diagnoses.
b. Clinical specificity:
The sponsor makes no claim of clinical specificity. Claims of clinical
specificity should be supported by comparing test performance to known
clinical diagnoses.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
We estimated the clinical sensitivity of the assay using the results of the assay
from the original 119 RA patients and the 100 blood bank donors. The 100
referred for testing samples were not included because there was no
information about their clinical diagnosis:
Rheumatoid Arthritis
Positive Negative Total
EL anti-CCP2 Positive 83 1 84
Equivocal 2 0 2
Negative 34 99 133
Total 119 100 219
If equivocal samples are considered positive:
Sensitivity: 71.43% 95% CI (62.74%- 78.78%)
Specificity: 99.0% 95% CI (94.55%- 99.82%)
Overall Agreement: 84.02% 95% CI (78.59 - 88.28)
If equivocal samples are considered negative:
Sensitivity: 69.75% 95% CI (60.98%- 77.28%)
Specificity: 99.0% 95% CI (94.55%- 99.82%)
Overall Agreement: 83.11% 95% CI (77.58 – 87.49%)
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected value in the normal population is negative. However, the presence
of autoantibodies related to RA increases with age. Using the cut-offs established
above, 99% of the samples tested were negative for the presence of anti-CCP2
autoantibodies. The sponsor suggests in the labeling that each laboratory
establish its own normal range.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
