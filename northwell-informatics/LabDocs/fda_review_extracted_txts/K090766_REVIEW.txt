510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
k090766
B. Purpose for Submission:
New Device
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Lifeloc Technologies, Inc. LifeGuard
Lifeloc Technologies, Inc. BacTrack B90
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Quantitative (electrochemical fuel cell sensor)
E. System Description:
1. Device Description:
The LifeGuard and BacTrack B90 models are self-contained units with a
mouthpiece at the top of the device for breath sampling. A round power button
and a triangular execute button are located on the front of the unit along with the
display screen. The power button turns the unit on and performs a self-test. If the
self-test passes, READY is displayed on the display. The unit is powered by a
single nine volt battery. The device also includes disposable mouthpieces. The
display window shows the breath alcohol concentration in increments of 0.001%
from 0.000% to 0.400% BAC. A graphical display and audible prompts assist the
user in providing an appropriate breath sample.
2. Principle of Operation:
The LifeGuard and BacTrack B90 are alcohol screening devices used for the
detection of alcohol in the breath. The devices employ a fuel cell sensor. An alcohol
fuel cell uses an alcohol oxidation reaction. In an alcohol oxidation reaction, a fixed
number of electrons are freed per molecule of alcohol. If alcohol is present, a
corresponding voltage is generated from the fuel cell, which is proportional to the
alcohol content of the breath sample.

a. Accuracy:
The sponsor performed a consumer study to determine if consumers could
correctly use and interpret the device using only the supplied instructions for
use. Results were compared to an evidential breath alcohol tester (the LifeLoc
FC10). Twenty-eight participants took their breath alcohol reading with the
new device and recorded the result. Immediately afterward, the participants
were administered a breath alcohol test using the professional device. The
breath alcohol concentrations ranged from BAC of 0.000 to 0.116 by the
evidential device. Linear regression analysis of the data showed a slope of
0.889, a y-intercept of 0.006 and a correlation coefficient of 0.965.
After the study, participants were asked questions about the ease of use,
instructions and about the ability to understand and interpret the test results
displayed by the device. The results are presented below:

* One volunteer had not consumed alcohol but believed he had done so when he
drank a non-alcoholic mixer. When he obtained a result of zero he felt that he did
not understand the result. The reading of zero was confirmed by the evidential
device.
b. Precision/Reproducibility:
This device was not tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA). The sponsor performed their own testing and collected
performance data using the NHTSA requirements for precision and accuracy as a
guide. These requirements (referred to as Model Specifications) consist of 20
trials at a Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) of 0.000, 20 trials at a BAC of
5

0.008 and 20 trials at a BAC of 0.032. BACs are simulated in breath by a Breath
Alcohol Sample Simulator (BASS), which provides an alcohol-in air test sample
with known alcohol concentrations, flow rate and air composition. The
acceptance criteria for the Model Specifications are: not more than one negative
result at 0.032 BAC, not more than one positive result at 0.008 BAC, and not
more than one negative greater than zero and no positives at 0.000 BAC. The
device had no negatives at 0.032 BAC, no positives at 0.008 BAC and no
positives at 0.000 BAC. Negatives are defined as being less than 0.020 BAC.
Positives are defined as being greater than or equal to 0.020 BAC.
c. Linearity:
This device will report concentrations from 0.00 to 0.400% BAC. However, the
DOT Model Specifications require accuracy and precision testing up to a
concentration of 0.032 only; therefore, true linearity over the entire measuring
range of the device was not evaluated. This device met all of the applicable
NHTSA requirements for precision and accuracy as described above.
d. Carryover:
Carryover studies are not required by NHTSA and were not performed using this
device.
e. Interfering Substances:
The sponsor chose to duplicate the NHTSA requirements for cigarette smoke
interference. The sponsor evaluated the possibility of cigarette smoke interference
with the device. An alcohol-free person who smokes cigarettes smoked
approximately one half of a cigarette. Within one minute after smoking, the
subject took a breath alcohol reading. The subject then repeated this procedure for
5 trials. The acceptance criterion for this trial is: no positive results. The device
produced all negative results in this study.
2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
a. Limit of Detection
The DOT Model Specifications do not specifically address the detection
limit of breath alcohol devices. However, the devices must be tested at a
BAC of zero (blank reading) to assess the possibility of false positives.
This consists of 20 trials under normal laboratory conditions at a BAC of
0.000. Non-alcoholic human breath is to be used as the sample. For
devices capable of providing a reading of greater than 0.000 BAC and
less than 0.020 BAC, the acceptance criterion is: not more than one such
result. The device had no false positives in this trial.

b. Temperature
The DOT Model Specifications require testing 10 and 40o C to assess
any possible effects of temperature. At 10o C, 20 trials are required at
0.008 BAC and 20 trials are required at 0.032 BAC. Acceptance
criteria are: not more than one positive result at 0.008 BAC, and not
more than one non-positive result at 0.032 BAC. The device had no
positive results at 0.008 BAC and no non-positive results at 0.032
BAC. At 40o C, the requirements are identical. Again the device had
no positive results at 0.008 BAC and no non-positive results at 0.032
BAC.
c. Vibration
The DOT Model Specifications require vibration testing to assess any
possible vibrational effects. Twenty trials are required at 0.008 BAC
and 0.032 BAC. Acceptance criteria are: not more than one positive
result at 0.008 BAC, and not more than one non-positive result at
0.032 BAC. The device had no positive results at 0.008 BAC and no
non-positive results at 0.032 BAC.
d. Cutoff
For the purposes of performance testing, a BAC cutoff of 0.020 was used
to distinguish positive from negative samples.
K. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
L. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
