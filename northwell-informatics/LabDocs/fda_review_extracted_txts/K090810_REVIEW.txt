M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed to assess absolute count within-run
reproducibility for low, normal, and high CD3 and CD3CD4 samples. For
each sample, twenty-one (21) aliquots of whole blood were stained with
CD3/CD4/CD45 TriTEST reagent using Thermo Scientific Cyto-Cal™ Count
Tubes. The range of CVs for CD3 cells, observed for all samples were 4.0% -
6.2%. Acceptance Criteria: Medium and High Cell Concentration Samples -
≤ 5% CV, Low Cell Concentration Samples (Semi-quantitative with-in run) -
7.5 % CV. The range of CD3CD4 cells, observed for all samples were 4.3% -
6.9%. Precision data met the acceptance criteria.
Within-run results:
Sample N Subset Mean cells/µL CV%
Low 21 CD3+ 549 6.2
CD3+CD4+ 369 6.9
Medium 21 CD3+ 1875 3.8
CD3+CD4+ 1220 3.9
High 21 CD3+ 3602 4.9
CD3+CD4+ 1996 4.7
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To assess linearity and recovery, a dilution recovery study was performed.
One fresh whole blood sample was concentrated by removing plasma. This
high sample was diluted with serum to 80%, 60% 40%, 20% and 0%. The
results are as follows:
Expected results vs. measured values
Subset r Slope Intercept
CD3+ 0.9996 0.991 17.492
CD3+CD4+ 0.9990 1.0094 12.159
Recovery was within 10% of expected value for levels tested.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
A reagent Shelf-Life Stability study was performed on three lots of Cyto-
Cal™ Count Tubes at room temperature (20°-25°C). Bead counts were
measured from Day 0 to 16 months and recovery was expected to be within

Day 0 for all three lots for up to 16 months.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was performed to determine the potential of endogenous
and exogenous substances to affect accuracy. The interference was assessed
by adding known amounts of interfering substances into whole blood with a
CD4+ concentration of 398 cells/µL. Acceptance Criteria: CD4+ Count
Measured recovers within ± 10% of CD4+. No interference was observed for
samples adjusted in the pH range of 6.8 – 8.8, in addition to sample conditions
listed below:
EDTA: No significant interference from EDTA 10 mg/mL
Icterus (jaundice): No significant interference from Bilirubin up to 20 mg/dL
Hemoglobin: No significant interference from Hemoglobin up to 20 g/dL
Lipemia: No significant interference from Triglycerides up to 500 mg/dL
