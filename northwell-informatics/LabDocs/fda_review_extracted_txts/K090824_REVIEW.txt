H. Device Description:
The BD ProbeTecCT Qx Amplified DNA Assay is based on the simultaneous
amplification and detection of target DNA using amplification primers and a
fluorescently-labeled detector probe (8, 9). The reagents for SDA are dried in two
separate disposable microwells: the Priming Microwell contains the amplification
primers, fluorescently-labeled detector probe, nucleotides and other reagents necessary
for amplification, while the Amplification Microwell contains the two enzymes (a DNA
polymerase and a restriction endonuclease) that are required for SDA. The BD Viper
System pipettes a portion of the purified DNA solution from each Extraction Tube into a
Priming Microwell to rehydrate the contents. After a brief incubation, the reaction
mixture is transferred to a corresponding, pre-warmed Amplification Microwell which is
sealed to prevent contamination and then incubated in one of the two thermally-
controlled fluorescent readers. The presence or absence of C. trachomatis DNA is
determined by calculating the peak fluorescence (Maximum Relative Fluorescent Units
(MaxRFU)) over the course of the amplification process and by comparing this
measurement to a predetermined threshold value.
In addition to the fluorescent probe used to detect amplified C. trachomatis target DNA, a
second fluorescently-labeled oligonucleotide is incorporated in each reaction. The
Extraction Control (EC) oligonucleotide is labeled with a different dye than that used for
detection of the C. trachomatis-specific target and is used to confirm the validity of the
extraction process. The EC is dried in the Extraction Tubes and is re-hydrated upon
addition of the specimen and extraction reagents. At the end of the extraction process, the
EC fluorescence is monitored by the BD Viper instrument and an automated algorithm is

--- Page 3 ---
applied to both the EC and C. trachomatis-specific signals to report specimen results as
positive, negative, or EC failure.

1. Analytical performance:
CT QX Assay Analytical Sensitivity:
The Limits of Detection (LoDs) for the CT QX Assay with C. trachomatis serovar H in
urine and swab specimens when extracted on the BD Viper System were determined to
be < 15 CT elementary bodies (EB) per mL for neat and Qx UPT urine and < 30 CT EB
per mL for expressed vaginal and endocervical swab and PreservCyt specimens. A
,
correlation of EB to Inclusion-forming units (IFU) suggests that the CT QX assay LoDs
with serovar H in urine and swab specimens correspond to < 1 IFU per mL (15). The CT
QX Assay on the BD Viper System in extracted mode was able to detect 16 isolates
representing 15 CT serovars (A, B, Ba, C, D, E (2)*, F, G, H, I, J, K, LGV1, LGV2, and
LGV3) with ≥ 95% proportion positive at a concentration of 15 EB per mL in CT/GC QX
Swab Diluent.
* Testing with CT serovar E included the nvCT strain, a new variant with a deletion in
the cryptic plasmid. (21)
CT QX Assay Analytical Specificity:
DNA from 141 organisms listed in Table 2 was extracted on the BD Viper System and
tested with the BD ProbeTecCT Qx Amplified DNA Assay. All potential cross-reactive
species were tested at > 1x108 cells/mL except where noted. The CT Qx Assay did not
cross-react with any of the organisms tested.

CT Qx Interfering Substances
The performance of the BD ProbeTec CT Qx Assay on the BD Viper System in extracted
mode was evaluated in the presence of potential interfering substances which may be
encountered in swab, urine and/or PreservCyt specimens. Potential interfering substances
were spiked into Qx UPT urine and vaginal swab specimen matrices as well as
PreservCyt specimens in LBC Specimen Dilution Tubes, in both the presence and the
absence of CT elementary bodies (30 CT EB/mL in urine matrix and 90 CT EB/mL in
swab/LBC Specimen Dilution Tube matrix). Results are summarized in Table 3.

For neat urine, pools were co-spiked with CT serovar H and GC strain ATCC 19424 at
45 EB per mL and 150 cells per mL, respectively. Neat urine specimens were stored at
either 2-8oC for 1, 3 or 7 days; or at 30oC for 8, 24 or 30 h; or at -20oC for 60 days. At
each time point, samples were removed from storage and tested with the BD ProbeTecCT
Qx Assay on the BD Viper System in extracted mode. Thirty-two assay replicates were
generated for each condition (sample type/temperature/duration). The expected results
were obtained with the CT Qx assay under all conditions tested.
For Qx UPT urine, pooled specimens were co-spiked with CT serovar H and GC strain
ATCC 19424 at 45 EB per mL and 150 cells per mL, respectively. The spiked urine
specimen pools were then stored at either 2-8oC for 24 h or 30oC for 8 h prior to transfer
into Qx UPT tubes. The Qx UPT specimen pools were then stored either at 2-8oC for 14,
21 or 30 days; or at 30oC for 14, 21 or 30 days; or at -20oC for 60 days. At each time
point Qx UPT specimens were removed from storage and tested with the BD ProbeTecCT
Qx Assay on the BD Viper System in extracted mode. Thirty-two assay replicates were
generated for each condition (sample type/temperature/duration). The expected results
were obtained with the CT Qx assay under all conditions tested.
Vaginal Dry and Expressed Swab Stability
Pools of CT negative vaginal swab matrix were used in analytical experiments to support
the storage and transport stability claims for dry vaginal swab specimens. Pools were co-
spiked with CT serovar H and GC strain ATCC 19424 to achieve 90 EB per mL and 300
cells per mL, respectively, when seeded onto swabs and expressed in CT/GC Qx Swab
Diluent. Seeded dry swabs were stored at 2-8oC for 3, 7, or 14 days; or at 30oC for 3, 7
or 14 days; or at -20oC for 30 or 60 days. At each time point, dry swabs were removed
from storage and expressed into 2 mL of CT/GC Qx Swab Diluent and evaluated with the
BD ProbeTec CT Qx Assay on the BD Viper System in extracted mode. Thirty-two assay
replicates were generated for each condition (sample type/temperature/duration). The
expected results were obtained with the CT Qx assay under all conditions tested.
Pools of CT negative vaginal swab matrix were used in analytical experiments to support
the storage and transport stability claims for expressed vaginal swab specimens. Pools
were spiked with CT serovar H and GC strain ATCC 19424 to achieve 90 EB per mL and
300 cells per mL, respectively. The spiked swab matrix was stored at 2-8oC for 7, 14 or
30 days; or at 30oC for 7, 14 or 30 days; or at -20oC for 30 or 60 days. At each time point,
samples were removed from storage and tested with the BD ProbeTec CT Qx Assay on
the BD Viper System in extracted mode. Thirty-two assay replicates were generated for
each condition (sample type/temperature/duration). The expected results were obtained
with the CT Qx assay under all conditions tested.
Endocervical and Urethral Swab Specimen Stability
Pools of CT negative endocervical swab matrix were used in analytical experiments to
support the storage and transport stability claims for endocervical and urethral swab
specimens. Pools of swab matrix were spiked with CT serovar H and GC strain ATCC
19424 at 90 EB per mL and 300 cells per mL, respectively. The pools were dispensed in

--- Page 8 ---
2 mL volumes into BD sample tubes to simulate “wet” endocervical specimens and
stored at either 2-8oC for 7, 14 or 30 days; or at 30oC for 7, 14 or 30 days; or at -20oC for
30 or 60 days. At each time point, samples were removed from storage and tested with
the BD ProbeTec CT Qx Assay on the BD Viper System in extracted mode. Thirty-two
assay replicates were generated for each condition (sample
type/temperature/duration). The expected results were obtained with the CT Qx assay
under all conditions tested.
Post Pre-warm Specimen Stability
Pools of male and female CT negative neat urine were used in analytical experiments to
support the storage stability claims for pre-warmed neat and Qx UPT urine specimens.
Pooled specimens were spiked with CT serovar H and GC strain ATCC 19424 at 45 EB
per mL and 150 cells per mL, respectively and either added to Qx UPT tubes or left
untreated as neat urine. Both specimen types were pre-warmed at 114°C for 15 min, and
cooled for 15 min. After the pre-warm process, specimen tubes were stored at either 2-
8oC for 1, 3 or 7 days; or at 30oC for 1, 3 or 7 days; or at -20oC for 30 days. At each time
point samples were removed from storage and tested with the BD ProbeTecCT Qx Assay
on the BD Viper System in extracted mode. Thirty-two assay replicates were generated
for each condition (sample type/temperature/duration). The expected results were
obtained with the CT Qx assay under all conditions tested.
Pools of CT negative vaginal and endocervical swab specimen matrices in CT/GC Qx
Swab Diluent were used in analytical experiments to support the storage stability claims
for pre-warmed expressed vaginal, endocervical, and male urethral swab specimens. For
both types of matrix, pooled specimens were spiked with CT serovar H and GC strain
ATCC 19424 at 90 EB per mL and 300 cells per mL, respectively and aliquotted into 2
mL volumes in BD specimen tubes. The tubes were pre-warmed at 114°C for 15 min and
cooled for 15 min. After the pre-warm process, the specimen tubes were stored either at
2-8oC for 3 or 7 days; or at 30oC for 3 or 7 days; or at -20oC for 30 days. At each time
point, samples were removed from storage and tested with the BD ProbeTecCT Qx Assay
on the BD Viper System in extracted mode. Thirty-two assay replicates were generated
for each condition (sample type/temperature/duration). The expected results were
obtained with the CT Qx assay under all conditions tested.
PreservCyt Specimen Stability
Pools of CT and GC negative PreservCyt clinical specimens were used in analytical
experiments to support the storage and stability claims. Pools were co-spiked with CT
serovar H and GC strain ATCC 19424 to achieve 90 EB per mL and 300 cells per mL,
respectively. The pools were dispensed in 20 mL volumes in PreservCyt vials and stored
at either 2-8oC or 30oC. After 30 days, 0.5 mL from each vial was removed and added to
an LBC Specimen Dilution Tube. The specimens in the LBC Specimen Dilution Tube
were then stored at 2-8oC for 30 or 90 days; or at 30oC for 30 or 90 days; or at -20oC for
90 days. At each time point, samples were removed from storage and tested with the BD
ProbeTec CT Qx Assay on the BD Viper System in extracted mode. Twenty-four assay

replicates were generated for each condition (temperature/duration). The expected results
were obtained with the CT Qx assay under all conditions tested.
Reproducibility
Reproducibility of the BD Viper System using the BD ProbeTecCT Qx Assay was
evaluated at three clinical sites on one BD Viper System per site. A panel of simulated
specimens was tested that comprised CT and GC organisms seeded into swab diluent for
the BD ProbeTecCT Qx Assay. Simulated endocervical and urethral specimens contained
a clean endocervical swab whereas the simulated urine and vaginal swab specimens did
not. Uninoculated swab diluent for the BD ProbeTecCT Qx Assay was used for the CT
negative samples. Nine replicates of each panel member were tested every day for five
days on each BD Viper System. The data are summarized in Table 4.

tested that comprised CT and GC organisms seeded into Qx swab diluent at two different
levels each of which was below the respective analytical LoD for the organisms (1:10,
1:100). These levels were selected to fall within the dynamic range of the analytical
LOD curve of the assay. Fifteen replicates of each panel member were tested every day
for five days across three BD Viper Systems. The data are summarized in Table 5.

A reproducibility study of the BD Viper System using the BD ProbeTec CT Qx Assay
was also conducted for Liquid Based Cytology (LBC) specimens at three clinical sites on
one BD Viper System per site. A panel of simulated specimens comprising CT and GC
organisms seeded into LBC Specimen Dilution Tubes containing PreservCyt Solution
was tested with the BD ProbeTec CT Qx Assay. Uninoculated LBC Specimen Dilution
Tubes containing PreservCyt Solution were used for the CT negative samples. Nine
replicates of each panel member were tested every day for five days on each BD Viper
System. The data are summarized in Table 6. Two additional target levels were included
in the panels to characterize the reproducibility of test results (i.e., proportion positive or
negative) at target levels below the analytical Limit of Detection (LoD) of the BD
ProbeTec CT Qx Assay. These additional specimens comprised CT and GC organisms
seeded into LBC Specimen Dilution Tubes containing PreservCyt Solution at dilutions of
1:10 and 1:100 of the respective analytical LoDs of each analyte. These levels were
selected to fall within the dynamic range of the analytical LoD curves for the BD
ProbeTec CT Qx and GC Qx assays. Nine replicates of each panel member were tested
every day for five days across the three BD Viper Systems. The data are summarized in
Table 7.

System Cross Contamination and Carryover
An internal study was conducted to evaluate the risk of producing a false positive result
in either the same run on the BD Viper System in extracted mode (within run cross-
contamination) or in a subsequent run (between run carryover). Testing was conducted
using negative and positive samples on three BD Viper Systems. Negative samples
consisted of CT/GC Qx Swab Diluent/LBC Specimen Dilution Tube with PreservCyt
Solution. Positive samples consisted of a representative analyte (at 105 CT EB/mL)
spiked into CT/GC Qx Swab Diluent/LBC Specimen Dilution Tube with PreservCyt
Solution. The overall rate of cross-contamination (i.e., with alternating columns of
positive and negative samples and a prevalence of 50%) was 0.41% (9/2208). The overall
rate of carryover contamination (i.e., carryover between successive runs when the
prevalence was 50% in the previous run) was 0.36% (8/2208). Cross-contamination and
carryover rates across the three BD Viper Systems are summarized in Tables 8 and 9.
