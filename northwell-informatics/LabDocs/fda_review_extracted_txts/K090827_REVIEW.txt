I. Device Description: The BD ProbeTec GC Q Amplified DNA Assay is based on the
simultaneous amplification and detection of target DNA using amplification primers and
a fluorescently-labeled detector probe. The reagents for SDA are dried in two separate
disposable microwells: the Priming Microwell contains the amplification primers,
fluorescently-labeled detector probe, nucleotides and other reagents necessary for
amplification, while the Amplification Microwell contains the two enzymes (a DNA
polymerase and a restriction endonuclease) that are required for SDA. The BD ViperTM
System pipettes a portion of the purified DNA solution from each Extraction Tube into a
Priming Microwell to rehydrate the contents. After a brief incubation, the reaction
mixture is transferred to a corresponding, pre-warmed Amplification Microwell which is
sealed to prevent contamination and then incubated in one of the two thermally-
controlled fluorescent readers. The presence or absence of N. gonorrhoeae DNA is
determined by calculating the peak fluorescence (Maximum Relative Fluorescent Units
(MaxRFU)) over the course of the amplification process and by comparing this
measurement to a predetermined threshold value.
In addition to the fluorescent probe used to detect amplified N. gonorrhoeae target DNA,
a second labeled oligonucleotide is incorporated in each reaction. The Extraction Control
(EC) oligonucleotide is labeled with a different dye than that used for detection of the N.
gonorrhoeae -specific target and is used to confirm the validity of the extraction process.
The EC is dried in the Extraction Tubes and is rehydrated upon addition of the specimen
and extraction reagents. At the end of the extraction process, the EC fluorescence is
monitored by the BD Viper System and an automated algorithm is applied to both the EC
and N. gonorrhoeae -specific signals to report results as positive, negative, or EC failure.

L. Test Principle:
The BD ProbeTec GC Qx Amplified DNA Assay is designed for use with the BD
ProbeTec Chlamydia trachomatis/Neisseria gonorrhoeae (CT/GC) Qx specimen
collection and transport devices, applicable reagents, the BD Viper System and BD Fox
Extraction. Specimens are collected and transported in their respective transport devices
which preserve the integrity of the N. gonorrhoeae DNA over the specified ranges of
temperature and time.
Urine and swab specimens undergo a pre-warm step in the BD Viper Lysing Heater to
dissolve mucus and homogenize the specimen. After cooling, the specimens are loaded
onto the BD Viper System which then performs all the steps involved in extraction and
amplification of target DNA, without further user intervention. The specimen is
transferred to an Extraction Tube that contains ferric oxide particles in a dissolvable film
and dried Extraction Control. A high pH is used to lyse the bacterial cells and liberate
their DNA into solution. Acid is then added to lower the pH and induce a positive charge
on the ferric oxide, which in turn binds the negatively charged DNA. The particles and
bound DNA are then pulled to the sides of the Extraction Tube by magnets and the
treated specimen is aspirated to waste. The particles are washed and a high pH Elution
Buffer is added to recover the purified DNA. Finally, a Neutralization Buffer is used to
bring the pH of the extracted solution to the optimum for amplification of the target.
The BD ProbeTec GC Qx Amplified DNA Assay is based on the simultaneous
amplification and detection of target DNA using amplification primers and a
fluorescently-labeled detector probe. The reagents for SDA are dried in two separate
disposable microwells: the Priming Microwell contains the amplification primers,
fluorescently-labeled detector probe, nucleotides and other reagents necessary for
amplification, while the Amplification Microwell contains the two enzymes (a DNA
polymerase and a restriction endonuclease) that are required for SDA. The BD Viper
System pipettes a portion of the purified DNA solution from each Extraction Tube into a
Priming Microwell to rehydrate the contents. After a brief incubation, the reaction
mixture is transferred to a corresponding, pre-warmed Amplification Microwell which is
sealed to prevent contamination and then incubated in one of the two thermally-
controlled fluorescent readers. The presence or absence of N. gonorrhoeae DNA is
determined by calculating the peak fluorescence (Maximum Relative Fluorescent Units
(MaxRFU)) over the course of the amplification process and by comparing this
measurement to a predetermined threshold value.
In addition to the fluorescent probe used to detect amplified N. gonorrhoeae target DNA,
a second fluorescently-labeled oligonucleotide is incorporated in each reaction. The
Extraction Control (EC) oligonucleotide is labeled with a different dye than that used for
detection of the N. gonorrhoeae-specific target and is used to confirm the validity of the
extraction process. The EC is dried in the Extraction Tubes and is re-hydrated upon
addition of the specimen and extraction reagents. At the end of the extraction process,
the EC fluorescence is monitored by the BD Viper instrument and an automated
4

algorithm is applied to both the EC and N. gonorrhoeae-specific signals to report
specimen results as positive, negative, or EC failure.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study of the BD Viper System using the BD ProbeTec GC Qx Assay
was evaluated for Liquid Based Cytology (LBC) specimens at three clinical sites on one
BD Viper System per site. A panel of simulated specimens comprising CT and GC
organisms seeded into LBC Specimen Dilution Tubes containing PreservCyt Solution
was tested with the BD ProbeTec GC Qx Assay. Uninoculated LBC Specimen Dilution
Tubes containing PreservCyt Solution were used for the GC negative samples. Nine
replicates of each panel member were tested every day for five days on each BD Viper
System. The data are summarized in the table below.

Two additional levels were included in the panels to characterize the reproducibility of
test results (i.e., proportion positive or negative) at target levels below the analytical
Limit of Detection (LOD) of the BD ProbeTec GC Qx Assay. These additional
specimens comprised CT and GC organisms seeded into LBC Specimen Dilution Tubes
containing PreservCyt Solution at dilutions of 1:10 and 1:100 of the respective analytical
LODs of each analyte. These levels were selected to fall within the dynamic range of the
analytical LOD curves for the BD ProbeTec CT Qx and GC Qx assays. Nine replicates of
each panel member were tested every day for five days across the three BD Viper
Systems. The data are summarized in the table below.

g. Cross Contamination and Carryover: An internal study was conducted to evaluate
the risk of producing a false positive result in either the same run on the BD Viper
System in extracted mode (within run cross-contamination) or in a subsequent run
(between run carryover). Testing was conducted using negative and positive samples on
three BD Viper Systems. Negative samples consisted of CT/GC Qx Swab Diluent/LBC
Specimen Dilution Tube with PreservCyt Solution. Positive samples consisted of a
representative analyte (105 CT EB/mL) spiked into CT/GC Qx Swab Diluent/LBC
Specimen Dilution Tube with PreservCyt Solution. The overall rate of cross-
contamination (i.e., with alternating columns of positive and negative samples and a
prevalence of 50%) was 0.41% (9/2208) for the CT/GC Qx Swab Diluent and 0.45%
(5/1104) for the LBC Specimen Dilution Tube with PreservCyt Solution. The overall
rate of carryover contamination (i.e., carryover between successive runs when the
prevalence was 50% in the previous run) was 0.36% (8/2208) for the CT/GC Qx Swab
Diluent and 0.54% (6/1104) for the LBC Specimen Dilution Tube with PreservCyt
Solution. Cross-contamination and carryover contamination across the three BD Viper

PreservCyt Specimen Clinical Study
Endocervical swab specimens and PreservCyt specimens were collected from 2079
compliant female subjects attending family planning, OB/GYN, and sexually transmitted
disease clinics at eleven geographically diverse clinical sites in North America. Subjects
were classified as symptomatic if they reported symptoms such as dysuria, coital
pain/difficulty/bleeding, abnormal vaginal discharge, or pelvic/uterine/adnexal pain.
Subjects were classified as asymptomatic if they did not report symptoms. Two subjects
were excluded due to an undetermined patient infected status. Three subjects did not
have a PreservCyt specimen result. Therefore there were 2074 subjects evaluated.
Three randomized endocervical swab specimens and a PreservCyt specimen were
collected from each female subject. The three reference endocervical swabs were tested
with the BD ProbeTec ET CT/GC/AC assay, the BD ProbeTec GC Qx assay, and another
commercially available NAAT (Nucleic Acid Amplification Test). Sensitivity and
specificity for PreservCyt specimens were calculated by comparing results to a patient
infected status (PIS) algorithm. The designation of positive or negative PIS was based on
the endocervical swab specimen results from the three reference methods. At least two
positive reference results were required to establish a subject as PIS-positive. At least
two negative reference results were required to establish a subject as PIS-negative. Data
are presented in the following tables.

4. Clinical cut-off: Clinical cut-off was validated during the swab and urine clinical trial
(K081825). The cutoff was 125 MaxRFU (> 125 MaxRFU = positive; < 125 MaxRFU =
negtative). The same cutoff was utilized for the clinical trial to validate the performance
of the PreservCyt Solution specimens when tested with the GCQ assay on the BD Viper
System in extracted mode.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
A. Prevalence: The prevalence of positive N. gonorrhoeae specimens in patient
populations depends upon: clinic type, age, risk factors, gender, and test method. The
prevalence observed with the GC Qx Assay during a multi-center clinical trial for
PreservCyt specimens ranged from 0.0% to 13.3% based on the data presented in the
table “GC Qx Assay Performance for PreservCyt Specimens Compared to Patient
Infected Status (by clinical site)” under performance.
B. Positive and Negative Predictive Value: Hypothetical positive and negative predictive
values (PPV & NPV) for the GC Qx Assay from the multi-center clinical trial for
PreservCyt specimens are shown in the following table. These calculations are based on
hypothetical prevalence and overall sensitivity and specificity (compared to the patient
infected status) of 95.3% and 99.95% for PreservCyt specimens.
