using the GSP instrument.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
The data obtained using the GSP Neonatal hTSH blood spot immunoassay should
be used as an aid to other medically established procedures and results interpreted
in conjunction with other clinical data available to the clinician.
Screening for congenital hypothyroidism by measurement of hTSH
concentrations requires a decision of the screening policy, definition of tiers, cut-
off values and follow-up. The laboratory needs to establish its own cut-off values,
which can be based on a percentile, or on the basis of a normal range1.
Interpretation of results and the recommended follow-up algorithm for congenital
hypothyroidism screening is described by American Academy of
Pediatrics/American Thyroid Association.
4. Special instrument requirements:
For use on the GSP instrument only.
I. Device Description:
• Neonatal hTSH calibrators and Neonatal hTSH controls - prepared from
human blood with a hematocrit value of 50-55% and calibrated against the
Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone, Human, for Immunoassay, Third International
Standard, NIBSC Code 81/565. The six calibrators contain concentrations of
added TSH at approximately 1, 10, 25, 50, 100 and 250 µU/mL blood. The two
controls contain approximate TSH concentrations of 15 and 60 µU/mL blood.
• Anti-hTSH-Eu tracer – mouse monoclonal in Tris-HCl buffered (pH 7.8) salt
solution containing bovine serum albumin, mouse IgG, and < 0.1% sodium azide
as preservative.
• Neo hTSH assay buffer – Tris-HCl buffered (pH 7.8) salt solution containing
bovine serum albumin, bovine globulin, Tween 40, polyethyleneglycol 6000, an
insert red dye, and < 0.1% sodium azide as preservative.
• Anti-hTSH Microtitration Strips – plates coated with antibodies directed
against a specific site on the beta subunit of the hTSH molecule.
Each kit contains reagents for 1152 assays.
All human source materials used in the preparation of kit components was tested
and found to be non-reactive for the presence of HBsAg, anti-HIV 1 and 2, and
HCV by FDA approved methods.

L. Test Principle:
The GSP instrument is a fully automated, high throughput batch analyzer for time
resolved and prompt fluorescence analysis of samples in microtitration plates. It is
intended for in vitro quantitative and qualitative determination of analytes in body
fluids.
The GSP™ Neonatal hTSH assay is a solid phase, two-site fluoroimmunometric
assay based on the direct sandwich technique in which two monoclonal antibodies
(derived from mice) are directed against two separate antigenic determinants on the
hTSH molecule. Calibrators, controls and test specimens containing hTSH are reacted
simultaneously with immobilized monoclonal antibodies directed against a specific
antigenic site on the ß hTSH subunit and europium-labeled monoclonal antibodies
(directed against a different antigenic site located partly on the ß subunit and partly on
the a subunit) in assay buffer.
The assay buffer elutes hTSH from the dried blood spots on the filter paper disks. The
complete assay requires one incubation step.
DELFIA Inducer dissociates europium ions from the labeled antibody into solution
where they form highly fluorescent chelates with components of DELFIA Inducer.
The fluorescence in each well is then measured. The fluorescence of each sample is
proportional to the concentration of hTSH in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated in accordance with CLIA document EP5-A2,
Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods:
Approved Guideline.
The variation of the GSP Neonatal hTSH assay was determined using spiked
dry whole blood spot samples, 3 kit lots and 3 GSP systems. The samples
were dried blood spot specimens (DBS) prepared from whole blood spiked
with TSH. The sample concentrations were chosen to cover the calibrator
range of the GSP Neonatal hTSH kit, which is 1 - 250 µU/mL blood. Two of
the samples were chosen to be as close as possible to the medical decision
level (7 - 25 µU/mL blood).

--- Page 6 ---
Heparinized whole blood specimens were collected from four apparently
healthy adults. In addition, heparinized whole blood was used for preparation
of one specimen (sample 5). The hematocrit of the specimens was adjusted to
correspond to the hematocrit of neonates (approximately 50-55%). The
samples were spiked with four TSH concentrations. The four blood samples
were used to prepare dried blood spot samples by dispensing the prepared
samples onto filter paper. The filter papers were dried overnight at room
temperature in a laminar flow hood and stored thereafter at -20 ºC in sealed
bags with desiccant. The study was performed over 23 days in 27 runs each
consisting of 2 plates with 4 replicates per sample. The analysis of variance
approach was used to calculate the following:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity study protocol and analysis for the GSP Neonatal hTSH kit was
performed in accordance with CLSI document EP6-A: Evaluation of the
Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach,

The claimed measuring range for the TSH assay is 1.31 – 250 uU/mL.

Blood was drawn from one apparently healthy adult that represented a “low
concentration” sample. The hematocrit of the specimen was adjusted to
correspond to the hematocrit of neonates (approximately 0.5 - 0.55). A part of
the specimen was separated and TSH standard was added to obtain a high
concentration sample containing TSH approximately 300 µU/mL. 10 samples
with intermediate concentrations were prepared by mixing the low sample
with the high sample and spotted on filter paper and dried overnight. The
dried blood spot samples were measured in random order in a single run with
two GSP Neonatal hTSH kit lots and two GSP instruments. The samples were
analyzed in three replicates per run.
A polynomial evaluation of linearity was used for the data analysis. The
assumption of constant variance across all levels is not fulfilled in the GSP
Neonatal hTSH kit. Rather, the variance is proportional across different
measurement levels. Therefore, weighted regression models were used.
A linear regression line and second and third order polynomials were fitted to
the data. The results of regression analyses were compared. The significance
of the second and third order polynomials were evaluated by performing a t-
test. Both the second and third order regressions have statistically significant
nonlinear terms (β2, β3) at a 95% significance level (p-value <0.05).
For TSH concentrations over 5μU/mL blood, the maximum observed
difference between the linear regression models was -5.4 %. For
concentrations ≤ 5 μU/mL blood, the observed absolute difference between
the models was 0.32 μU/mL blood. Therefore, the assay has been
demonstrated to be linear over the claimed measuring range of 1.31 - 250
μU/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators and Controls: The calibrators and controls for the GSP
Neonatal hTSH are only available in the kit.
The Neonatal hTSH calibrators and Neonatal hTSH controls are dried blood
spots (DBS) on filter paper in sheet format prepared from a commercial TSH
standard and washed red blood cells diluted in filtered human serum (with a
final hematocrit value of 50-55%). The six calibrators contain concentrations
of added TSH at approximately 1, 10, 25, 50, 100 and 250 µU/mL blood. The
two controls contain approximate TSH concentrations of 15 and 60 µU/mL
blood. The calibrators and controls are stored at +2 - +8 °C.
TSH-WHO standard material (WHO 3rd IS for TSH 81/565) is used to
prepare primary calibrators for the GSP Neonatal hTSH kit. The standard
material is diluted in 1% BSA-TSA solution and the concentration of the stock
solution is gravimetrically determined. The WHO stock solution is added to
washed red blood cell/filtered serum suspension and dispensed as blood spots
on Whatman 903 filter paper.
The primary calibrators are used to monitor the level of secondary calibrators
regularly. The primary calibrators are used to draw a standard curve against

--- Page 8 ---
which the secondary calibrators are evaluated. The secondary calibrators are
prepared identically to the kit calibrators and controls (described above). The
concentration determination is done against the previous lot of the secondary
calibrators. They are stored at -20°C.
Initial concentration values for the kit calibrators and the kit controls are
assigned against the secondary calibrators using GSP instrument. The final, kit
lot specific concentrations for the kit calibrators and kit controls are assigned
in the final release test using the level calibrators and GSP instrument.
Stability:
Accelerated and real-time shelf-life stability: Study protocols, preliminary
data and acceptance criteria for shelf-life stability testing were provided for
the Neonatal hTSH kit components including the calibrators and controls at
refrigerated (2-8°C) and elevated (35°C) temperatures and elevated humidity
(RH 80%) and found to be acceptable. Based on the accelerated stability data,
twelve month shelf-life stability at 4°C is claimed for the Assay kit. Real-time
studies will continue to confirm and extend the dating.
In-use and on-board stability: Study protocols, preliminary data and
acceptance criteria for in-use and on-board stability were provided for the
Neonatal hTSH kit and found to be acceptable. Once opened, calibrators and
controls can be stored for 2 weeks at +2 to +8 °C in the original bag (protected
from light and moisture), and thereafter used in the hTSH assay. After
opening the package, the anti-hTSH microtitration strips can be stored for 2
weeks at +2 - +8 °C in the original package or in a resealable plastic bag with
desiccant (protected from light and moisture), and thereafter used in the hTSH
assay. Punched anti-hTSH microtitration strips can be stored on-board in the
GSP instrument plate storage magazine for 12 hours. On-board stability data
supports on-board storage of Anti-hTSH-Eu-tracer and Neo hTSH Assay
buffer up to 5 days.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of
Quantitation (LoQ) was determined in accordance with the CLSI Guideline
EP 17-A: Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of
Quantitation.
Limit of Blank: Three blank pools were prepared using washed red blood cell
and filtered serum. The hematocrit of the specimens was adjusted to
correspond to the hematocrit of neonates (approximately 50-55%). Blank
dried blood spot samples for testing were prepared and dried overnight.
Repeated measurements (n = 216, n = 72 / specimen, n = 24 / specimen / kit
lot) were carried out using the samples. 18 separate runs were performed
using three kit lots and three GSP instruments over six days.
The LoB was estimated nonparametrically as the 95th percentile of the
measurements. The LoB was determined to be 0.96 µU/mL blood.

--- Page 9 ---
Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ): To prepare the
samples for the determination of LoD and LoQ, blood was drawn from three
apparently healthy adults. In addition, heparinized whole blood was used for
preparation of one specimen (sample LoD3). The hematocrit of the specimens
was adjusted to correspond to the hematocrit of neonates (approximately 50-
55%). Low level samples for the LoD and LoQ analyses were prepared by
dispensing the different blood specimens without any addition of TSH on
filter paper and dried overnight.
Repeated measurements (n = 216 / specimen) were carried out using the 4
dried blood spot specimens. The runs were performed using three different
Neonatal hTSH kit lots and three different GSP instruments. Statistical
analysis calculated the LoD to be 1.31 µU/mL blood.
In absence of a recognized reference method, a functional sensitivity study
was used to define LoQ. LoQ is the lowest concentration of TSH that can be
measured with acceptable total variation of the assay (CV% < 20%). LoQ
was determined to be 1.31 µU/mL blood.
Samples that result in values below 1.31 µU/mL blood (2.91 µU/mL serum)
are recommended to be reported as "<1.31µU/mL blood" or "<2.91 µU/mL
serum". These results are not considered to be accurate, but can be considered
screen negative for congenital hypothyroidism.
Samples that result in values above the uppermost calibrator (Cal F;
approximately 250µU/mL blood or 555 µU/mL serum) are recommended to
be reported as "> Cal F µU/mL blood (kit lot specific value)" or "> Cal F
µU/mL serum (kit lot specific value)". The results are not recommended to be
considered accurate, but can be considered screen positive for congenital
hypothyroidism.
e. Analytical specificity:
Hook effect:
For the GSP Neonatal hTSH assay no hook effect was observed with TSH
concentrations up to 2000 µU/mL blood.
Blood was drawn from one apparently healthy adult donor. The hematocrit
was adjusted to correspond to the hematocrit of neonates (approximately 0.5 -
0.55%). This specimen represented “low concentration” sample. A part of the
specimen was separated and TSH standard was added to obtain “high
concentration” sample (2000 μU/mL blood). The other samples with
intermediate concentrations were prepared by pooling the “low concentration”
sample with the “high concentration” sample as presented. The different
dilutions were used to prepare dried blood spot samples by dispensing the
blood pools onto filter paper and dried overnight. The TSH concentrations of
the dried blood spot samples were measured using three kit lots and one GSP

--- Page 10 ---
system. The samples were analyzed in four replicates in random order on a
plate.
The results from the dilution series were analyzed. In this study the tested
sample concentrations did not result in test results where the result came back
to the calibrator curve, therefore no hook effect was seen at the concentrations
tested. The highest value expected in newborns would be approximately 1000
uU/mL.
Cross-reactive substances:
Cross reactivity was determined in accordance with CLSI document EP7-A2,
Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline – Second
Edition.
To determine the effect of the potential interferent on the measured TSH
concentrations of the samples with the addition of the tested substance, the
results were compared to those of the samples with no additions other than the
solvent. The 95% confidence interval approach was used to evaluate the
magnitude of the cross-reactivity. A bias of greater than ±1SD (from the
product specifications) was considered as analytically significant cross-
reactivity. Ten percent (10%) is the specification for the within-plate assay
variation (CV%) at the tested TSH concentration levels.
Heparinized whole blood was used as sample. The hematocrit of the blood
was adjusted to correspond to the hematocrit of neonates (approximately 0.5-
0.55). The blood was spiked with two different clinically relevant TSH
concentrations, 15 and 30 µU/mL blood; the tested substances were added to
these blood samples. The samples without any additions except solvent
(1%TSA-BSA) were used as controls. Dried blood spot samples were
prepared by dispensing blood pools on filter paper and dried overnight.
The TSH responses of the dried blood spot cross-reactivity samples were
analyzed with one GSP Neonatal hTSH kit lot in a single run. The samples
were analyzed in 12 replicates in random order.
The tested potential cross-reacting substances and their test concentrations:

The sponsor concludes that hCG at concentration 100,000 U/L and hFSH and
hLH at concentrations 250 U/L do not cross react with the measurement of
TSH using the GSP Neonatal hTSH kit.
Interference:
To determine the effect of the potential interferent on the measured TSH
concentrations of the samples with the addition of the tested substance, the
results were compared to those of the samples with no additions other than the
solvent. The 95% confidence interval approach was used to evaluate the
magnitude of the interference. A bias of greater than ±1SD (from the product
specifications) was considered as analytically significant interference.
Heparinized whole blood was used as sample. The hematocrit of the blood
was adjusted to correspond to the hematocrit of neonates (approximately 50-
55%). The blood was spiked with two different clinically relevant TSH
concentrations, 15 and 30 µU/mL blood; potentially interfering substances
were added to these blood samples. The pools without any additions except
solvent were used as controls. Dried blood spot samples were prepared by
dispensing the blood samples onto filter paper and dried overnight.
The TSH responses of the dried blood spot interference samples were
analyzed with one GSP Neonatal hTSH kit lot in a single run. The samples
were analyzed in 12 replicates in random order.

b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable. This assay uses neonatal dried blood
spots only.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Clinical data from newborn screening specimens tested at two U.S. state
laboratories are presented below. At both sites, the routine screening samples
were obtained from the samples submitted to the laboratories for testing by
order of a physician. The confirmed positive samples were acquired from
retrospective, banked samples in the possession of the laboratories.
Screening cut-offs used for classifying test results from both devices at both
external sites were those found in the table below, based on the American
Association of Pediatrics recommendations1:
Screening negative Borderline Screening positive
<9 uU/mL blood 9-18 uU/mL blood >18 uU/mL blood
<20 uU/mL serum 20-40 uU/mL serum >40 uU/mL serum
Study 1: 2053 routine left-over neonatal DBS specimens were assayed in the
study and used in the analysis. Of the 2053 there were 20 retrospective
samples from diagnosed hypothyroid babies and 2 samples found during the
testing of the routine left-over specimens were screening positive.

Study 2: A total of 2180 routine left-over neonatal DBS specimens were
assayed in the study, of which 2104 were included in the analysis. Of the 2104
there were included 23 retrospective samples from diagnosed hypothyroid
newborns. During the evaluation 3 routine left-over specimens were
confirmed to be from hypothyroid newborns and therefore the total number of
hypothyroid specimens is 26 of the 2104 specimens.

4. Clinical cut-off:
Screening for congenital hypothyroidism by measurement of hTSH
concentrations requires a decision of the screening policy, definition of tiers, cut-
off values and follow-up1. The laboratory needs to establish its own cut-off
values, which can be based on a percentile, or on the basis of a normal range. Cut-
off values should be monitored and reassessed when necessary.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
hTSH patient values by percentile from the testing completed with the Neonatal
hTSH kit at the two U.S. state laboratories described above (3c):
hTSH hTSH
Study n μU/mL blood μU/mL serum
Mean Median Mean Median
1 2081 4.0 3.2 8.8 7.0
2 2033 4.1 3.6 9.1 8.0
Percentiles
Study n hTSH μU/mL blood hTSH μU/mL serum
95th 97th 98th 99th 99.5th 95th 97th 98th 99th 99.5th
1 2081 7.9 8.8 9.5 10.7 11.6 17.6 19.6 21.1 23.7 25.8
2 2033 7.8 8.8 9.5 11.5 13.0 17.4 19.6 21.1 25.4 29.0
It should, however, be remembered that cut-off values of hTSH in dry blood spots
may vary between different tests and different populations. Therefore, it is
recommended that each laboratory establishes its own reference range and cut-off
limit from a representative sample population.
N. Instrument Name:
The GSP Instrument
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The GSP instrument is a fully automated, high throughput, batch mode analyzer.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this line of product types:
Yes ___X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
The sample format for the GSP is dried blood spots. If the dried blood spots are
prepared via an external puncher such as the Wallac DBS Puncher, Wallac
MultiPuncher or Wallac AutoPuncher a worklist of the samples is transmitted
directly to the GSP database in the instrument. If the dried blood spots are
prepared manually then GSP Workstation is used to enter worklists into the

--- Page 16 ---
database. When the plate barcode is read, the GSP software accesses the worklist
information from the database.
The GSP sends the sample results to GSP Workstation. Before it sends them,
results are stored in GSP.
Each GSP plate is barcoded with a unique identifier that is read by the barcode
reader resident on the GSP instrument.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The GSP instrument specimens are dried blood spot format and no mixing of the
sample is required to prepare it prior to analysis on the instrument. Either through
manual punching or auto punching the dried blood spots are prepared and added
to the plate wells. The plates are loaded into a removable plate magazine. Up to
24 plates may be loaded into the plate magazine. The plate magazine is there
loaded into the stacker on the GSP instrument and the door closed. The GSP
instrument will then present each plate to the barcode scanner for identification
and matching to the plate work list.
5. Calibration:
The six levels of calibrators, calibration curve, must be run in duplicate for each
kit lot and DELFIA Inducer lot. Thereafter the calibration curve is valid for up to
24 hours, or until a new calibration curve is run.
6. Quality Control:
Controls are provided in the kit. Controls should always be used to assure the day-
to-day validity of results. The controls should be run in the same way as the
samples. Controls at different levels are included in the kit and may number from
2 to 3 levels. These controls should be run in each assay; if the assay includes
more than one plate, controls should be run on each plate. Each laboratory should
establish its own mean and acceptable range for the controls. The established
mean should be within +/- 20% of the values stated on the quality control
certificate provided with the kit. It is recommended that the laboratories establish
their own controls at different levels in addition to the controls included in the kit.
Samples results should only be reported if control results for the assay meet the
laboratory's established criteria for acceptability.
