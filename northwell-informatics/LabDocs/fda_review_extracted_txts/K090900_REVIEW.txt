The Anchor Calibrator is in turn traceable to USP material gravimetrically
spiked into human serum.
Stability:
The stability of the calibrators is established through real-time data. Testing is
conducted at multiple time points and must pass pre-defined acceptance
criteria. The unopened product refrigerated at 4oC is stable for 12 months.
The opened product is stable for 30 days, refrigerated at 2 - 8 oC.
Value Assignment:
Values are assigned to production lots by using an ADVIA Clinical Chemistry
System calibrated with the Anchor Calibrator and adjusted with a ratio
derived from the Anchor Calibrator assigned value (target value) and the
mean recovery of the Anchor Calibrator values (observed). The table below
shows the target values for one specific lot of calibrator material
