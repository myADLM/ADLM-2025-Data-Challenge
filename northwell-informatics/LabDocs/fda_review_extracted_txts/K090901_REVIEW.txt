1. Intended use(s):
The eSensor® CF Genotyping Test is an in vitro diagnostic device used to
simultaneously detect and identify a panel of mutations and variants in the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene in genomic DNA samples isolated
from human peripheral whole blood specimens. The panel includes mutations and
variants recommended by the 2004 American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG). The
eSensor® CF Genotyping Test is a qualitative genotyping test that provides information
intended to be used for cystic fibrosis carrier screening as recommended by ACMG and
the 2005 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) for adults of
reproductive age, as an aid in newborn screening for cystic fibrosis, and in confirmatory
diagnostic testing for cystic fibrosis in newborns and children. The test is not indicated
for use in fetal diagnostic or pre-implantation testing. This test is also not indicated for
stand-alone diagnostic purposes and results should be used in conjunction with other
available laboratory and clinical information.

Same as Intended Use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For professional use only.
The eSensor® CF Genotyping Test does not identify the I506V, I507V, and F508C
polymorphisms, thus in the case of ΔF508 homozygosity, reflex testing by bi-directional
DNA sequencing is recommended
The eSensor® CF Genotyping Test does not identify all possible mutations in the CFTR
gene, for example E60X, I148T, 1078delT, V520F, 2143delT, 3199del6, D1152H,
3876delA, 2183AA>G, R560K, R117L, R347H, G551S, 711+5G>A, 394delTT,and
3905insT. A negative result for all the mutations in this panel does not necessarily
indicate that the individual does not carry mutations in CFTR gene (carrier or affected
status).
The mutations included in this test represent >80% of the mutations carried by Caucasian
American adults.

L. Test Principle:
The OMD eSensor® CF Genotyping Test is a multiplex microarray-based genotyping test
system. It is based on the principles of competitive DNA hybridization using a sandwich
assay format, wherein a single-stranded target binds concurrently to sequence-specific
solution-phase signal probe and solid-phase electrode-bound capture probe. The test employs
polymerase chain reaction amplification, exonuclease digestion and hybridization of target
DNA. In the process, the double stranded PCR amplicons are digested with exonuclease to
generate single stranded DNA suitable for hybridization. Hybridization occurs in the
eSensor® XT-8 Cartridge (described below) where the single-stranded target DNA is mixed
with a hybridization solution containing labeled signal probes.
During hybridization, the target DNA binds to a complementary, single-stranded capture
probe immobilized on the working electrode surface. Single-stranded signal probes (labeled
with electrochemically active ferrocenes) bind to the target adjacent to the capture probe.
When inserted into the eSensor® XT-8 instrument (described below), simultaneous
hybridization of target to signal probes and capture probe is detected by alternating current
voltammetry (ACV). Each pair of working electrodes on the array contains a different
capture probe, and sequential analysis of each electrode allows genotyping of multiple
mutations or polymorphisms.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility study panel consisted of twenty-two (22) genomic DNA (gDNA)
samples obtained from commercially available cultured cell lines, representing the 23
recommended ACOG/ACMG panel mutations and the 5/7/9T polymorphism. For
practical considerations, the 22 samples were divided into 2 sets of 11 samples, so
that the sample set was run in duplicate to evaluated intra-assay reproducibility using
a single kit. Only one lot of reagents was used for this study. A total of 1320 samples
(30,360 genotype calls) were tested, consisting of sixty (60) replicates (3 sites X 2
operators X 5 days X 2 replicates) for each of the 22 gDNA samples. DNA
concentrations ranged from 6.43 to 12.73 ng/µL (32.2-63.7 ng/sample), which is
within the 10-500 ng/sample range recommended in the package insert. A ratios
260/280
ranged from 1.52-2.84. Two additional runs were performed for any test which gave a
“no-call” result. No miscalls were observed on first pass or after repeat testing.
Thirty-six samples generated no-calls on the first pass were called successfully upon
repeat testing. The data were evaluated after first-pass results and following
additional runs for no-calls. All samples gave 100% agreement with DNA sequencing
after repeat testing. There were 36/1320 (2.7%) per sample first pass no-calls and
zero miscalls. The data were also evaluated after first-pass results on a per SNP basis
and the correct call rate was 1980/2040, 97% agreement (96.37%, 95%LCB) for
Positive (Mutation) Calls and 27552/28320 and 97% agreement (97.12%, 95% LCB)
for Negative (Wild-Type) Calls.
4

--- Page 5 ---
Among 36 no-calls, three were attributed to poor PCR amplification, four were
attributed to an increased amount of mutant signal relative to WT, nine due to
cartridge pumping, nine due to XT-8 instrument slot pumping, one due to invalid
controls and three were attributed to operator error in set up of the PCR and seven
were attributed to operator error in set-up of the exonuclease reaction (6 due to lack
of addition of exonuclease and one due to insufficient mixing). All no-call samples
gave correct calls after additional testing. The reproducibility results by sample, by
genotype, and site/operator are shown in Tables 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

wild type sample were tested using three different kit lots at a single site. A single no-
call was observed with one lot but was resolved upon repeat testing. No miscalls were
observed either before or after repeat testing. The data were evaluated after first-pass
results and following additional run for a no-call. All samples gave 100% correct calls
when compared with DNA sequencing.
Genomic DNA Extraction Reproducibility
A total of 20 independent whole blood samples of different heterozygous genotypes
(6 ΔF508 7T/9T, 1 R117H 7T/9T and 2 with 7T/7T, 1 G551D 5T/7T, and 8 WT
7T/7T and 2 with 5T/7T) were extracted by three commonly used extraction methods

and tested using the eSensor® CF Genotyping Test. The data were evaluated after
first-pass results and following additional runs to resolve the six no-calls observed.
After repeat testing, all samples gave 100% correct calls when compared with DNA
sequencing.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The reference method is bi-directional sequencing. A minimum acceptance criteria
for Phred scores was >20, which represents a 99% confidence of accuracy.
Assay Controls:
Each test contains internal positive and negative controls to assure proper functioning
of the system: Failure of either control will be indicated on the summary line of the
report as “Invalid Control(s)” and the identity of the failed control will be given in the
test results section of the report. The genotyping test results will not be reported for
any sample for which a positive or negative control failure occurs.
Positive Control: Each cartridge contains a capture probe that is complementary to a
synthetic target DNA present in the hybridization mixture. The target also contains
ferrocene label and thus generates an appropriate signal in the assay. The positive
control is designed to detect a systematic failure of the hybridization and/or detection
processes. A lack of signal for the positive control indicates a genotyping assay
failure. If a correct signal is observed for the positive control, but one or more
genotyping assays are invalid due to low signals, then a failure of DNA isolation or
PCR amplification or Exonuclease digestion is indicated.
Negative Control: A negative control is present on each cartridge, consisting of a
capture probe that does not hybridize to any sequence within the target DNA or signal
probes. Signals on the negative control indicate an assay system failure.
DNA Contamination Monitor (DCM): It is recommended that a blank PCR using
nuclease-free water instead of DNA template be performed and included with each
PCR run. This DCM sample is then processed with the other samples in the run, and a
DNA Contamination Monitor Report is reviewed for this sample. The severity of
contamination is determined by the System, and reported as a Contamination Metric
with a value between 0.0 and 1.0.
Stability:
Six stability studies were performed which included Kit stability, open pouch,
hybridization solution on cartridge, single and double stranded DNA, and reagent
pack freeze/thaw stability. Real-time stability studies currently support a three month
shelf life. The stability studies for the components and processes performed supports
the stability claims shown in Table 4 below.

*Open pouches should not be exposed to high humidity (~80%) to prevent possibility of

d. Detection limit:
Two genomic DNA samples of different genotypes (Wild Type and ΔF508
heterozygous) were extracted from whole blood stored in EDTA and serially diluted
and tested 20 times each at input amounts of 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 500 and 1000
ng/PCR using the eSensor® CF Genotyping Test. Absorbance ratios (260/280) were
1.88 and 1.89 from the Wild Type and ΔF508 heterozygous samples respectively. An
additional run was performed for tests that gave a first pass no call result. The number
of first pass correct calls for the 0.01 ng sample for the WT and ΔF508 sample was 5
and 1, respectively. The 0.01 ng ΔF508 sample provided 18 no calls and 1 miscall.
The miscalled sample gave a 9T/9T call for a 9T/7T sample. No miscalls were
observed with the WT sample.
All input amounts from 0.01 ng to 1000 ng for both samples gave equivalent final
performance (100% Agreement with 98.76%, 95% LCB), (99.95% LCB on a per
SNP basis). The limit of detection was established as the lowest concentration at
which no-calls or miscalls were obtained after repeat testing. The lower detection
limit was determined to be 0.1 ng of purified DNA per reaction and the upper
detection limit was determined to be 1000 ng of purified DNA per reaction. The
recommended range of DNA input amounts for the eSensor® CF Genotyping Test is
from 10 to 500 ng. A summary of the results is shown in Table 5 below.

e. Analytical specificity:
The following interfering substances were added separately to seven whole blood (4
ΔF508 heterozygous, 2 R117H heterozygous, and 1 G551D heterozygous) samples at
the concentrations indicated, and no effect was observed on yield of extracted DNA,
multiplex amplification of CFTR gene sequences, or genotyping of mutations in the
CF carrier screening panel: triglycerides (500 mg/dL), conjugated bilirubin (30
mg/dL), hemoglobin (~20 g/dL), and short draw EDTA (at a concentration equivalent
to 5-fold higher than that provided in a standard EDTA blood collection tube).
The 2183AA>G and R117L were evaluated and demonstrated not to impact the
results of the eSensor® CF Genotyping Test. When present in the same region as
panel mutations, they may interfere with genotyping results. Two whole blood
samples with the 2183AA>G mutation (N1303K/2183AA>G, and 2183AA>G/WT)
and 1 with the R117L (G85E/R117L) mutation were tested as part of the method
comparison study and shown not to interfere with the calling of the 2184delA and
R117H mutations. Two samples containing the benign variants near the ΔF508
mutation which consisted of a compound heterozygote sample ΔF508/I507V and
3849+10Kb C>T/F508C were tested as part of the method comparison study and
were called correctly. Both samples were correctly called as heterozygous for ΔF508
and 3849+10Kb C>T, respectively.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 112 whole blood and previously banked samples isolated from whole blood
were used in this study. There were 162 positive calls from the 112 samples which
consisted of heterozygous, homozygous, and compound heterozygous for the panel
mutations. One mutant sample each for R334W, 2789+5G>A, ΔF508 and 5T were
included in this study.

§ For the purpose of the IVS8-5T/7T/9T Variant, "Positive" samples are regarded as those that have at least one copy
of the 5T allele while "Negative" samples are regarded as having only the 7T and/or 9T allele
The number of positive sequencing calls is greater than the number of independent samples due to the inclusion of
compound heterozygous samples.
The Grand Total consists of the total number of sequencing calls for mutations, the 1 5T/5T sample included,

N. Instrument Name:
eSensor® XT-8 Instrument
O. System Descriptions:
See k073720 decision summary for description of the eSensor® XT-8 instrument description,
principles and mode of operation.
1. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X____ or No ________
2. Specimen Identification:
The sponsor’s submitted software documentation demonstrated that the software design
meets the stated requirements for this device and were verified and validated in part by
testing the system with known wild type, mutant, and negative control samples
determining that signal detection configurations result in correct call/results.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Sample identification is performed through entering in the sample ID and the barcode of
the test cartridge to be used with the sample. The barcode of the cartridge is scanned as
the sample is about to be run.
4. Calibration:
See k073720.
5. Quality Control:
The eSensor® CF Genotyping Test on the XT-8 Instrument uses a combination of
electronic and molecular controls and validity criteria to verify the proper operation of
the system and assure the delivery of accurate results. The eSensor® CF Genotyping Test
provides a system of controls for proper instrument setup and function, preparation of
reagents, handling of samples, and function of the cartridge and reagents. The criteria for
control and test results comprise consistent and stringent test for reporting of results.
Furthermore, results from control tests provide useful information to troubleshoot test
failures and to identify the potential root cause(s) and corrective action(s). A defect in
product or process occurring at any step of the process is expected to cause a failed
control or a signal which does not meet the criteria for a valid test result. In any of these
cases, no result is reported and further troubleshooting and/or a repeat of the test is
performed.
