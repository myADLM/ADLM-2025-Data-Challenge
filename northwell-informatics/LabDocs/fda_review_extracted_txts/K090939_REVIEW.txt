I. Device Description:
C.f.a.s. DAT Qualitative Plus Clinical calibrators contain a mixture of 10 different drugs,
prepared by quantitative addition of drug or drug metabolite to drug-free human urine.
Drugs included are amphetamines, barbituates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine,
methadone, methaqualone, opiates, phencyclidine, and propoxyphene. The calibrator set
contains a single level for each drug in a drug mixture. Drug concentrations are verified
by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Drugs or drug metabolites and their
respective levels included are as follows:
Amphetamines: 500 ng/mL
Barbituates: 200 ng/mL
Benzodiazepines: 100 ng/mL
Cannabinoids: 50 ng/mL
Cocaine: 300 ng/mL
Methadone: 300 ng/mL
Methaqualone: 300 ng/mL
Opiates: 300 ng/mL
Phencyclidine: 25 ng/mL
Propoxyphene: 300 ng/mL
Control Set DAT Clinical controls contain a mixture of 10 different drugs, prepared by
quantitative addition of drug or drug metabolite to drug-free human urine. Drugs included
are amphetamines, barbituates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, methadone,
methaqualone, opiates, phencyclidine, and propoxyphene. Drug concentrations are
verified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Target concentrations are
established at ±25% of the assay cutoff.
