I. Device Description:
The AbT Glucose Control Solution is a viscosity-adjusted, buffered aqueous
control solution containing a known quantity of glucose. The product is packaged in
a plastic dropper tipped bottle for easy application of the control solution to the test
strips and contains red coloration to aid the user to visually confirm application. The
product is nonhazardous and contains no human or animal derived materials.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Evaluation of the Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods;
Approved Guideline—Second Edition (CLSI EP5-A2).
L. Test Principle:
Not applicable
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The D-Glucose used in this control is traceable to an in-house glucose
preparation which is traceable to the NIST standard 917b. Values are
assigned by repeat analysis using three different lots of AgaMatrix
WaveSense Presto test strips and one AgaMatrix WaveSense Presto Blood
Glucose Monitor. The mean and standard deviation are used to establish the
acceptable range for the AgaMatrix WaveSense Presto Blood Glucose
Monitor.
Stability characteristics of the AbT Glucose Control Solution were determined
using accelerated and real-time studies. The unopened shelf-life is 24 months
and the open vial stability is 90 days at the recommended storage of 36 °F to
86 °F.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
Not applicable
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
An acceptable range for the AbT glucose control used with the AgaMatrix
WaveSense Presto blood glucose monitoring system is printed on the control vial
label. When using this control material, users are to compare their control result to the
range on the control vial (rather than the range printed on the test strip vial).
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision
