Guidance for Industry and FDA
L. Test Principle:
When whole blood is added to the reagent, the fluorochrome-labeled antibodies in the
reagent bind specifically to leucocyte surface antigens. The stained samples are
treated with BD FACS™ Lysing Solution to lyse erythrocytes prior to acquisition and
analysis on the BD FACSCanto or BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer. During
acquisition, the cells travel past two spatially-separated laser beam and scatter the
laser light. The stained cells fluoresce. These scatter and fluorescence signals,
detected by the flow cytometer, provide information about the cell’s size, internal
complexity, and relative fluorescence intensity. During analysis by BD FACSCanto
clinical software, the lymphocyte population percentages are determined.
Lymphocyte population absolute counts may be determined if lymphocyte data from
another method is manually entered. BD Multitest reagents employ fluorescence
triggering, allowing direct fluorescence gating of the lymphocyte population10-12 to
reduce contamination of unlysed or nucleated red blood cells in the gate.
When BD Trucount tubes are used, the lyophilized pellet in the tube dissolves,
releasing a known number of fluorescent beads. During analysis, the absolute
number (cells/μL) of positive cells in the sample can be determined by comparing
cellular events to bead events. Then BD FACSCanto clinical software (minimum
v2.0) determines absolute counts.
When BD Trucount tubes are not used, samples must be stained in 12 x75-mm BD
Falcon™ polystyrene tubes or equivalent. BD FACSCanto clinical software
(minimum v2.4) can also determine absolute counts if lymphocyte data from another
method is provided.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was determined by running commercially available control samples
stained with BD Multitest 6-Color TBNK Reagent on both the BD FACSCanto
and BD FACSCanto II flow cytometers. Each control sample was measured in
duplicate during two runs per day, over a span of 21 days, using three of each
instrument type, and three rotating operators. Each control sample was
analyzed separately with the following response variables:
• CD3+ T lymphocyte subset percentage
• CD4+ T lymphocyte subset percentage
• CD8+ T lymphocyte subset percentage
• CD16+CD56+ NK lymphocyte subset percentage
• CD19+ B lymphocyte subset percentage
For each lymphocyte subset percentage, the acceptance criterion for the study
was total within-device standard deviation (SD) ≤ 2.5 with upper 95% confidence
4

--- Page 5 ---
limits ≤ 2.5 (they were < 2.0). In addition, all analyzed components of total
precision (including day, between-run and within-run precision) had upper 95 %
confidence limits for SD < 2.0. All precision results met the study acceptance
criteria.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Not applicable.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Not applicable.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A comparison study was performed to determine the method bias between the
systems. Sixty two (62) surplus or prospectively procured samples were
collected from two sites. Three discrete bins were identified to provide even
distribution of data across the range of CD4. A minimum of 10 and a
maximum of 20 samples were collected per bin. Of the 62 samples, 52 met
the bin classification criteria. See bin ranges below:
Bins Range
1 ≥ 1% - <15%
2 15% - 30%
3 >30%
Accuracy was assessed by analyzing the bias between the device and the
predicate system. The overall mean bias was determined for lymphocyte
subset percentages on each instrument. A 95% confidence interval was
conducted and subjected to the acceptance criteria.

It is recommended that laboratories must establish their own normal reference
intervals for the BD Multitest 6-color TBNK reagent parameters that can be
affected by gender of patient, age of patient, and preparative technique. Race of
patient and individual variations of epitope expression can also have an effect,
although sufficient data is not available to establish this. Age, gender, clinical
characteristics, and race of patients should be known when a reference range is
determined.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
