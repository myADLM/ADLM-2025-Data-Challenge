The BD ProbeTec GC Qx Amplified DNA Assay, when tested with the BD Viper™
System in Extracted Mode, uses Strand Displacement Amplification technology (SDA)
for the direct, qualitative detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae DNA in clinician-collected
female endocervical and male urethral swab specimens, patient-collected vaginal swab
specimens (in a clinical setting), and male and female urine specimens. The assay is
indicated for use with asymptomatic and symptomatic female and male individuals to aid
in the diagnosis of gonococcal urogenital disease.
3) Special conditions for use statement(s): For Prescription use only
4) Special instrument requirements: BD ViperTM System with automated nucleic acid
extraction mode
I. Device Description: The BD ProbeTec GC QX Amplified DNA Assay is based on the
simultaneous amplification and detection of target DNA using amplification primers and
a fluorescently-labeled detector probe. The reagents for SDA are dried in two separate
disposable microwells: the Priming Microwell contains the amplification primers,
fluorescently-labeled detector probe, nucleotides and other reagents necessary for
amplification, while the Amplification Microwell contains the two enzymes (a DNA
polymerase and a restriction endonuclease) that are required for SDA. The BD

ViperTMSystem pipettes a portion of the purified DNA solution from each Extraction
Tube into a Priming Microwell to rehydrate the contents. After a brief incubation, the
reaction mixture is transferred to a corresponding, pre-warmed Amplification Microwell
which is sealed to prevent contamination and then incubated in one of the two thermally-
controlled fluorescent readers. The presence or absence of N. gonorrhoeae DNA is
determined by calculating the peak fluorescence (Maximum Relative Fluorescent Units
(MaxRFU)) over the course of the amplification process and by comparing this
measurement to a predetermined threshold value.
In addition to the fluorescent probe used to detect amplified N. gonorrhoeae target DNA,
a second labeled oligonucleotide is incorporated in each reaction. The Extraction Control
(EC) oligonucleotide is labeled with a different dye than that used for detection of the N.
gonorrhoeae -specific target and is used to confirm the validity of the extraction process.
The EC is dried in the Extraction Tubes and is rehydrated upon addition of the specimen
and extraction reagents. At the end of the extraction process, the EC fluorescence is
monitored by the BD Viper System and an automated algorithm is applied to both the EC
and N. gonorrhoeae -specific signals to report results as positive, negative, or EC failure.

Medical Devices, May 11, 2005. http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/guidance/337.pdf

L. Test Principle:
The BD ProbeTec GC Qx Amplified DNA Assay is designed for use with the BD
ProbeTec Chlamydia trachomatis/Neisseria gonorrhoeae (CT/GC) Qx specimen
collection and transport devices, applicable reagents, the BD Viper System and BD Fox
Extraction. Specimens are collected and transported in their respective transport devices
which preserve the integrity of the N. gonorrhoeae DNA over the specified ranges of
temperature and time.
Urine and swab specimens undergo a pre-warm step in the BD Viper Lysing Heater to
dissolve mucus and homogenize the specimen. After cooling, the specimens are loaded
onto the BD Viper System which then performs all the steps involved in extraction and
amplification of target DNA, without further user intervention. The specimen is
transferred to an Extraction Tube that contains ferric oxide particles in a dissolvable film
and dried Extraction Control. A high pH is used to lyse the bacterial cells and liberate
their DNA into solution. Acid is then added to lower the pH and induce a positive charge
on the ferric oxide, which in turn binds the negatively charged DNA. The particles and
bound DNA are then pulled to the sides of the Extraction Tube by magnets and the
treated specimen is aspirated to waste. The particles are washed and a high pH Elution
Buffer is added to recover the purified DNA. Finally, a Neutralization Buffer is used to
bring the pH of the extracted solution to the optimum for amplification of the target.
The BD ProbeTec GC Qx Amplified DNA Assay is based on the simultaneous
amplification and detection of target DNA using amplification primers and a
fluorescently-labeled detector probe. The reagents for SDA are dried in two separate
disposable microwells: the Priming Microwell contains the amplification primers,
fluorescently-labeled detector probe, nucleotides and other reagents necessary for
amplification, while the Amplification Microwell contains the two enzymes (a DNA
polymerase and a restriction endonuclease) that are required for SDA. The BD Viper
System pipettes a portion of the purified DNA solution from each Extraction Tube into a
Priming Microwell to rehydrate the contents. After a brief incubation, the reaction
mixture is transferred to a corresponding, pre-warmed Amplification Microwell which is
sealed to prevent contamination and then incubated in one of the two thermally-
controlled fluorescent readers. The presence or absence of N. gonorrhoeae DNA is
determined by calculating the peak fluorescence (Maximum Relative Fluorescent Units
(MaxRFU)) over the course of the amplification process and by comparing this
measurement to a predetermined threshold value.
In addition to the fluorescent probe used to detect amplified N. gonorrhoeae target DNA,
4

a second fluorescently-labeled oligonucleotide is incorporated in each reaction. The
Extraction Control (EC) oligonucleotide is labeled with a different dye than that used for
detection of the N. gonorrhoeae-specific target and is used to confirm the validity of the
extraction process. The EC is dried in the Extraction Tubes and is re-hydrated upon
addition of the specimen and extraction reagents. At the end of the extraction process, the
EC fluorescence is monitored by the BD Viper instrument and an automated algorithm is
applied to both the EC and N. gonorrhoeae-specific signals to report specimen results as
positive, negative, or EC failure.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance: Same as described in K081825. No additional analytical
studies were necessary to support this extended claim.
2. Comparison studies:

Characteristics
b. Matrix comparison: NA
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity: See under Performance Characteristics
b. Clinical specificity: See under Performance Characteristics
Performance Characteristics
Clinician-collected male urethral swab specimens and male Qx UPT and neat urine
specimens were collected from 787 symptomatic and asymptomatic male subjects
attending OB/GYN, sexually transmitted disease (STD) and family planning clinics at
seven geographically diverse clinical sites in North America. Thirteen male subjects were
excluded from the data analysis due to age requirement violations, antibiotic treatment in
the last 21 days, opting to withdraw from the study after initially consenting, failure to
obtain paired swab and urine specimens, urine quantity less than 20 mL, or transport and
storage errors related to specimen collection. Therefore, the final data analysis included
774 compliant male subjects.

Additional Analysis: Co-infection status
To determine the effect of CT co-infection with GC, a performance analysis was
conducted to assess the GCQ assay results when compared against PIS by co-infection
status. Co-infection is defined as GCQ PIS positive and CTQ PIS positive. CTQ PIS
positive is defined similarly as to GCQ PIS positive (two of the three reference swabs
tested positive for CT). The following table displays the co-infection status of the
subjects, the number of specimens, and the calculated sensitivities and specificities for
the GCQ assay.

4. Clinical cut-off: Clinical cut-off was validated during the swab and urine clinical trial
(K081825). The cutoff was 125 MaxRFU (> 125 MaxRFU = positive; < 125 MaxRFU =
negtative). The same cutoff was utilized for the clinical trial to validate the performance
of the asymptomatic male specimens when tested with the GCQ assay on the BD Viper
System in extracted mode.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
A. Prevalence: The prevalence of positive N. gonorrhoeae specimens in patient
populations depends upon: clinic type, age, risk factors, gender, and test method. The
prevalence observed with the GC Qx Amplified DNA Assay during a multi-center clinical
trial ranged from 1.4% to 19.1% for female specimens and 4.8% to 40.5% for male
specimens (including both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects).
B. Positive and Negative Predictive Value: Hypothetical positive and negative predictive
values (PPV & NPV) for the GC Qx Assay are shown in the following table. These
calculations are based on hypothetical prevalence and overall sensitivity and specificity
(compared to the patient infected status) of 99.3% and 99.3%, respectively. In addition,
PPV and NPV based on actual prevalence, sensitivity and specificity are shown in the
tables under performance characteristics section (See “GC Qx Assay Performance
Compared to Patient Infected Status (by specimen type and symptomatic status)” and
“GC Qx Assay Performance Compared to Patient Infected Status (by clinical site).”
PPV was calculated using: (Sensitivity * Prevalence) / (Sensitivity*Prevalence + (1 -
Specificity) * (1 - Prevalence)). NPV was calculated using: (Specificity * (1 -
Prevalence)/ (1-Sensitivity) * Prevalence + Specificity * (1-Prevalence)).
