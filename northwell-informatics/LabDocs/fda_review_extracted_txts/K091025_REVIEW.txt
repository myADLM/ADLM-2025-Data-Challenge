H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use:
chromID™ VRE agar is a selective and differential chromogenic medium
containing 8 μg/mL of vancomycin, for the qualitative detection of E. faecium and
E. faecalis showing acquired vancomycin resistance (VRE) in stool specimens.
chromID™ VRE agar can be used as an aid to identify, prevent and control VRE
colonization in healthcare settings. chromID™ VRE is not intended to diagnose
VRE infection nor to guide or monitor treatment for infections. Subculture to
non-selective media (e.g. trypticase soy agar with 5% sheep blood) is needed for
further identification, susceptibility testing and epidemiological typing.

K. Standard/Guidance Document referenced (if applicable):

L. Test Principle:
chromID™ VRE agar (patents pending) consists of a rich nutritive base including a
variety of peptones. It also contains chromogenic substrates and a mixture of
antibiotics including vancomycin (8 μg/mL) which enable
• the specific and selective growth of VRE,
• the direct detection of E. faecium and E. faecalis through the
characteristic color of colonies:
- E. faecium: violet color for ß-galactosidase producing strains
- E. faecalis: blue-to-green color for α-glucosidase producing strains
The selective mixture inhibits enterococcal strains that do not express acquired
vancomycin resistance; enterococcal strains that express intrinsic vancomycin
resistance (i.e. vanC phenotype: E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus); and most Gram-
negative and Gram-positive bacteria .
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated at three sites using a set of ten organisms
which were tested in triplicate each day for three days at three different sites.
The study included vancomycin susceptible and vancomycin resistant E.
faecalis and E. faecium (both with vanA and vanB). The quality control
reference strains were also included in the study.
Preliminary results at 24 hours demonstrated 80% reproducibility. After
incubation for the full 48 hours, overall reproducibility was 100%.

--- Page 6 ---
Two strains of P. aeruginosa, five strains of P. fluorescens, and one strain
each of S. maltophilia and A. baumanii grew producing colorless and/or
atypically pigmented colonies.
One strain each of C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, Geotrichum
candidum, Saccromyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus niger, and Penicillum
abeanum, all grew producing colorless or blue colonies on the chromID™
VRE medium.
The study results are reflected in the Limitation and Cross Reactivity sections
of the device package insert.
Interference Study
Commonly used medicinal substances namely, Preparation H Ointment,
Boudreaux’s Butt Paste, Glycerin, Dulcolax, Vaseline and Tucks Pads, as well
as human blood and physiological saline were found to decrease growth of
VRE isolates on the chromID™ VRE medium in comparison to the control.
However, the chromogenic reaction remained unaffected.
Testing of both Preparation H Cream and Miconazole 7 resulted inhibition or
delayed growth of VRE isolates on the chromID™ VRE medium at 24 and 48
hours incubation. However, the chromogenic reaction remained unaffected.
Cary Blair transport medium was tested and found to have no detrimental
effect on the growth, recovery or chromogenic reaction of VRE isolates on the
chromID™ VRE medium.
Collection Swab Study
The influence of collection swabs on the recovery of VRE was also
evaluated. Rayon and nylon flocked swabs were tested dry and coupled with
Amies transport media. After 1 and 4 hours of contact there was found to be
no significant difference in the sensitivity of detection of VRE between dry
swabs and those in Amies transport medium. After 18 hours of contact at
room temperature, the nylon flocked swab with Amies transport media
resulted in the best recovery for VRE, followed by nylon flocked dry swabs
and rayon swab with Amies transport media. After 18 hours at 2-8ºC, the
nylon flocked swabs with and without Amies transport medium resulted in
the best recovery of VRE, followed by the rayon swabs with and without
Amies transport medium.
See doc 6

f. Analytical Sensitivity
Recovery Study
A recovery study was performed to determine the lowest number of colony
forming units (CFU) of vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) that will
grow on the chromID™ VRE medium. One strain of E. faecalis (vanA)
bioMerieux stock no. 05.02.228; and one strain of E.faecium (vanA) ATCC
700221; were evaluated. Ten-fold serial dilutions were prepared in saline and
then plated in duplicate onto chromID™ VRE medium. After 48 hours
incubation, the number of CFU was counted on each plate. The number of
CFU obtained on the two plates from each dilution was averaged. The percent
recovery on chromID™ VRE was determined to be equivalent to 100
CFU/mL of sample.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The performance of the chromID™ VRE agar was evaluated at four
geographically diverse laboratory sites. A total of 1299 stool specimens were
evaluated. Stool specimens were inoculated on chromID™ VRE agar
medium and the Bile Esculin Azide Agar with 6μg/ml of Vancomycin.
(BEAV). Both plates were observed for growth at 24 and 48 hours. Colonies
with violet or blue-to-green pigment (chromID™ VRE) or brown to black
pigment diffusing into the medium (BEAV), were identified by a combination
of conventional reference methods to include Gram stain, catalase, VITEK 2
GP, and 16S-500 sequencing. Vancomycin resistance was confirmed by agar
dilution.

A challenge set of 75 well characterized isolates were tested at one external
site. The challenge isolates included vancomycin resistant and vancomycin
susceptible E. faecalis and E. faecium, E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus, and
other gram positive microorganisms commonly isolated from the stools.
Results of the challenge study were compared to the expected result as
determined by the organism identification based on API® results or known
reference strain and vancomycin resistance as determined by the vancomycin
agar dilution method.
One challenge isolate E. faecalis 13029 vanB produced blue-purple colonies
after 48 hours incubation. This was due to a rare situation of activity of both
enzymes (α-glucosidase and β-galactosidase) occurring in one strain. Both
enzymes reacted with the chromogen in the chromID™ VRE agar medium
and this combination of activity produced the blue-purple color variation.
A second study was performed to evaluate the detection of enterococcal
strains with low level vancomycin resistance. Forty-nine enterococcal strains
characterized by intermediate or low levels of resistance to vancomycin were
evaluated. The strains tested were from several international collections such
as ATCC, LMG (Gent-Laboratorium voor Microbiologie, Belgium), NCTC
(National Collection of Type Culture, United Kingdom) and the bioMérieux
stock collection. E. faecium and E. faecalis isolates with a low level of
vancomycin resistance were detected if their vancomycin MIC was greater
than or equal to 4 μg/mL. For a majority of the isolates, the characteristic
colony coloration was observed after 48 hours incubation. All the isolates of
E. casseliflavus in this study were inhibited on the chromID™ VRE medium.
Most isolates of E. gallinarum in this study were inhibited on the chromID™
VRE medium with the exception of two isolates, the first with the acquired
vanA gene resulted in growth of violet colonies, a second with an MIC of
greater than 64 μg/mL resulted in growth of colorless colonies.
