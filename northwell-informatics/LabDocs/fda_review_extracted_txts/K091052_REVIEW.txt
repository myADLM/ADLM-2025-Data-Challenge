4. Special instrument requirements:
Piccolo xpress™ Chemistry Analyzer (k934592)
I. Device Description:
Each Piccolo MetLyte Plus CRP Reagent Disc contains dry test-specific reagent
beads: 67.2 µg Anti-human CRP coated latex ( mouse) and 0.3 µg Anti-human CRP
(goat). A dry sample blank reagent (comprised of buffer, surfactants, excipients and
preservatives) is included in each disc for use in calculating concentrations of CRP
and chemistry analytes. Each disc also contains a diluent consisting of surfactants
and preservatives.

The discs are designed to separate a heparinized whole blood sample into plasma and
blood cells. The disc meters the required quantity of sample and diluent. then mixes
,
the plasma sample with the diluent and delivers the mixture to the reaction cuvette
contained in the disc perimeter. The diluted sample mixes with the reagent beads
initiating the chemical reactions that are then monitored by the analyzer. The discs are
8 cm in diameter and are single-use devices. The disc may also be used with serum.
(The Abaxis Piccolo System is an established point of care device since 1994 with
eight cleared Chemistry analytes: Blood Urea Nitrogen (k942782); Chloride
(k010670); Creatinine Kinase (k992140); Creatinine (k942782); Glucose (k934592);
Potassium (k992140); Sodium (k993211); and Total Carbon Dioxide (k992149).

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Standard documents:
CLSI EP 17: Determination of limits of detection and limits of quantitation
CLSI EP 18: Quality management for unit-use testing.
L. Test Principle:
The method used by Abaxis is an enhanced latex-agglutination turbidimetric
immunoassay. Sample is mixed with a suspension of mouse anti-human CRP
monoclonal antibody that is bound to latex. CRP in the sample binds to the antibody-
latex particles and agglutinates creating turbidity. Light scattering from the turbidity
is used as a measure of CRP. Turbidity is measured as a change in absorbance at 630
nm. This absorbance change is directly proportional to the CRP in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility of the assay was assessed by testing in duplicate two levels of
controls, one patient samples close to the 7.5 mg/L assay cut-off performed in
two sites over 20 days (n=80). Additional four samples (two close to assay
cut-off, one mid-range and one upper-range) were tested in duplicate at one
site for five days (n=40). The intra-assay and inter-assay %CV ranges were
from 1.7% to 8.4% and 2.9% to 9.8%, respectively (see tables below).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity across the assay measuring range (5.0 - 200 mg/L) was confirmed
by testing pooled sera with low range concentration of 4.6 mg/L and pooled
sera with high concentrations from 202.8 mg/L. Nine dilution pools were
calculated and prepared with the low and high sample pools using the S=9
Dilution Scheme recommended in CLSI EP6-A standard Appendix A. The
diluted samples were re-assayed four times on four Piccolo xpress Chemistry
Analyzer.
Linearity results were as follows:
Regression N Slope Intercept R2 r
Equation
Y= 1.037x – 0.764 4 1.037 -0.764 0.994 0.997
Reportable range: 5.0 – 200.0 mg/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The calibrators are traceable to Beckman’s method calibration to
Standard Reference Material BCR 470
Stability: Accelerated stability testing 25ºC and 35ºC at 0, 14, 21, and 28 days
and 0, 3, and 10 days testing intervals respectively. Real time testing at 2-8ºC
were tested at 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 ans 21 months. The reagent discs are
stored at recommended temperature 2-8ºC in their sealed pouches. Expiration
date claim is 21 months.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation
(LoQ) were determined using five pools including the lowest CRP calibrator
(human serum spiked with CRP to 4.5 mg/L), three dilutions of lowest
calibrators in saline, and a saline blank. Each pool was assayed twenty times,
twice on each of 10 Piccolo xpress Chemistry analyzers.
The LoB is determined either by Gaussian or non-Gaussian distribution. If
Gaussian, LoB is determined by equation; if non-Gaussian, it is determined as
the non-parametric 95th percentile.
The LoD was determined by equation LoD = LoB + (C β * SDs) where C β =
1.645/(1-(1/(4*f)), where f is degrees of freedom (n=1), and SDs is the
standard deviation of the observations.
The LoQ was determined as the lowest sample run that displayed CV<20%
and Accuracy vs. expected value of 80-120% (inaccuracy <20%).
The results were as follows:
LoB = 0.32 mg/L
LoD = 0.91 mg/L
LoQ = 2.5 mg/L

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies:
Endogenous substances : Six Human serum pools (28 and 250 mg/L CRP) and
a control pool were tested with up to 750 mg/dL Hemoglobin, 35 mg/dL
Bilirubin and 750 mg/dL Triglycerides) in four replicates on each of four
Piccolo xpress Chemistry analyzers. Interference were observed at ≤10%. The
Piccolo xpress Chemistry analyzer will automatically print ‘HEM’, ‘LIP’, or
‘ICT’ if interferents are above the physical interferent values as listed above.
Exogenous substances: Thirty five drugs and other substances were selected
as potential interferents with the CRP methods based on recommendations by
Young, DS Effects of drugs on laboratory testing 3rd Ed. Wash DC AACC
Press 1990. Listing of exogenous and other substances and levels tested of
CRP for each level with ±10% shift were as follows:

Glutathione 30 13% dec.
Isoniazide 4 16% dec.
L-dopa 5 28% dec.
Oxaloacetate 132 57% dec.
Rheumatoid factor (RF): Undiluted and Normal serum samples were spiked
~150 mg/L CRP were tested with RF serum (up to 644 IU/mL). Each sample
was run in quadruplicate on four Piccolo analyzers. No interference were
obsserved.
HAMA interference: Undiluted and Normal serum samples were spiked 50
mg/L CRP were tested with a known HAMA serum (up to 115ng/mL from
ProMedDx). Each sampole was run in quadruplicate on four Piccolo
analyzers. No interference were obsserved.
The Package Insert states “Specimens from patients who have recceived
preparations of mouse monoclonal antibodies for diagnosis or therapy may
contain HAMA”.
These interferent listings and results as shown above are listed in the CRP
Package Insert.
High dose effect: A commercial CRP calibrator with an assigned value of
1,040 mg/L was run neat and diluted into a serum pool to obtain CRP at 520
adn 260 mg/L. Each sample was assyaed four times on four Piccolo analyzers.
No high dose effect (prozone effect) was observed.
The extrememly high CRP concentrations up to 1,000 mg/L would not be
expected to provide numbers within the Abaxix dynamic ranges. An error
code stating >200 mg/L will flag the results.
f. Assay cut-off:
Assay cut-off: <7.5 mg/L. The assay cut-off was determined from 69 healthy
adults tested in duplicate by the Abaxis CRP method and the Beckman CRP
method. CRP Reference interval was based on demonstrated transferability of
the reference intervals from Beckman reference interval (per CLSI EP5-A
guideline).
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison study was performed on 113 samples with
concentrations ranging from 5.0 – 200.0 mg/L. Of the 113 samples, 20
samples were from 5-10 mg/L ranges; 29 samples from 10.1-25 mg/L ranges;
12 samples from 25.1-55.0 mg/L ranges; 13 samples from 55.1-89 mg/L
