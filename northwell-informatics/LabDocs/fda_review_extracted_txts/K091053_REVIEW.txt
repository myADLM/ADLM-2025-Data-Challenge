exhibiting signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infections. This assay targets the
conserved regions of the Hemagglutinin-Neuraminidase (HN) gene of HPIV-1, HPIV-
2 and HPIV-3, respectively. The detection and discrimination of HPIV-1, HPIV-2 and
HPIV-3 nucleic acids from symptomatic patients aid in the diagnosis of human
respiratory tract parainfluenza infections if used in conjunction with other clinical and
laboratory findings. This test is not intended to detect Parainfluenza 4a or
Parainfluenza 4b Viruses.
Negative test results are presumptive and should be confirmed by cell culture.
Negative results do not preclude Parainfluenza 1, 2 or 3 virus infections and should
not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other management decisions.
2. Indication(s) for use: Same as intended use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
To be used with the Cepheid SmartCycler II Real Time Instrument with Dx Software
version 1.7b or 3.0a and either a MagNA Pure LC Instrument (Roche) and the
MagNA Pure Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Roche) or a NucliSENS® easyMAG™
System (bioMérieux) and the Automated Magnetic Extraction Reagents (bioMérieux).

An overview of the procedure is as follows:
1. Collect nasopharyngeal swab specimens from symptomatic patients using a polyester,
rayon or nylon tipped swab and place into viral transport medium (not provided with
kit).
2. Add an Internal Control (IC) to every sample to monitor for inhibitors present in the
specimens.
3. Perform isolation and purification of nucleic acids using a MagNA Pure LC
Instrument (Roche) and the MagNA Pure Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Roche) or
a NucliSENS® easyMAG™ System (bioMérieux) and the Automated Magnetic
Extraction Reagents (bioMérieux).
4. Add purified nucleic acids to ProParaflu+ Supermix along with enzymes included in
the assay kit. The ProParaflu+ Supermix contains oligonucleotide primers and target-
specific oligonucleotide probes. The primers are complementary to conserved regions
of the Hemagglutinin-Neuraminidase (HN) genetic sequences for HPIV-1, HPIV-2
and HPIV-3 viruses. The probes are dual-labeled with a reporter dye attached to the
5’-end and a quencher dye attached to the 3’-end (see table below).
5. Perform reverse transcription of RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) and
subsequent amplification of DNA in a Cepheid SmartCycler® II instrument. In this
process, the probe anneals specifically to the template followed by primer extension
and amplification. The ProParaflu+ Assay is based on Taqman chemistry, which
utilizes the 5’ – 3’ exonuclease activity of the Taq polymerase to cleave the probe thus
separating the reporter dye from the quencher. This generates an increase in
fluorescent signal upon excitation from a light source. With each cycle, additional
reporter dye molecules are cleaved from their respective probes, further increasing
fluorescent signal. The amount of fluorescence at any given cycle is dependent on the
amount of amplification product present at that time. Fluorescent intensity is
monitored during each PCR cycle by the real-time instrument.

J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
ID-Tag Respiratory Virus Panel, Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Inc.
2. Predicate K number(s): K063765
3. Comparison with predicates:
Both assays detect HPIV-1, HPIV-2 and HPIV-3 using nucleic acid amplification
techniques. Both assays use nasal pharyngeal swabs as the collection device and the
MagNA Pure LC system for nucleic acid isolation. In addition, the ProParaflu+ Assay
can also utilize the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG System for nucleic acid
extraction. The detection system with both assays involves spectrophotometric
detection. The assays differ in that the predicate is a multiplex Nucleic Acid
amplification and end-point detection assay also detects Influenza A, Influenza B, RSV,
Influenza A subtypes H1 and H3, hMPV, Rhinovirus, and Adenovirus. The
ProParaflu+ assay is a multiplex real-time Nucleic Acid amplification and detection
assay detects HPIV-1, HPIV-2 and HPIV-3 only.

L. Test Principle:
The real-time PCR process simultaneously amplifies and detects nucleic acid targets in a
single closed-tube reaction. The ProParaflu+ Assay enables the detection and
differentiation of human Parainfluenza virus (HPIV) types 1, 2, and 3 and an Internal
Control and is based on three processes: nucleic acid isolation, reverse transcription (RT)
and Real Time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification/detection. The Internal
Control (IC) is added to each nasopharyngeal (NP) swab from symptomatic patients to
monitor for inhibitors present. Nucleic acids are isolated and purified from the NP swab
sample. Purified nucleic acid is added to the ProParaflu+ Supermix (includes Taq
polymerase) along with the appropriate enzymes. The ProParaflu+ Supermix contains
oligonucleotide primers complementary to highly conserved regions of the
hemagglutinin-neuraminidase gene for HPIV-1, 2, and 3 and target-specific
oligonucleotide probes dual-labeled with a reporter dye attached to the 5’ end and a
quencher dye attached to the 3’ end. After initial reverse transcription of RNA into
complementary DNA (cDNA), amplification proceeds during which the primers and
probe anneal specifically to the template (if present) followed by primer extension and
amplification. The ProParaflu+ Assay is based on Taqman chemistry, which utilizes the
5’ – 3’ exonuclease activity of the Taq polymerase to cleave the probe thus separating the
reporter dye from the quencher. This generates an increase in fluorescent signal upon
excitation from a light source. With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are
cleaved from their respective probes, further increasing the fluorescent signal. The
7

amount of fluorescence at any given cycle is dependent on the amount of amplification
product present at that time. Fluorescent intensity is monitored during each PCR cycle by
the real-time instrument.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility Study
An Inter-Laboratory Reproducibility study was conducted by extracting and
testing a panel of 9 samples at three sites performed by two operators at each site
for 5 days per operator (for a total of 10 runs per site). The Reproducibility Panel
used in the study was prepared by spiking nasopharyngeal (NP) swab pools with
cultured and titered stock solutions of human Parainfluenze virus (HPIV) types 1,
2 and 3 at low positive (2 x LoD), medium positive (10 x LoD) or high negative
(0.01-0.001 x LoD) concentrations. Panel members were coded and randomly
sorted to make 9- sample test panels and to ensure sample identification was
unknown to the operators. The 9-sample test panels were stored at ≤–70oC and
shipped to the sites frozen.
A set of ten panels (90 total samples) was provided to each laboratory; one set was
used for each of the 5 testing days per operator. Each operator thawed one panel
set per day, spiked the samples and a Negative Control with the Internal Control,
and performed nucleic acid extraction on the panel samples using either the Roche
MagNA Pure LC system (Site #3) or the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG (Site
#1 and Site #2). An Extraction Control, a well characterized human parainfluenza
3 virus, was also included with each nucleic acid isolation run. Extracted nucleic
acid was tested with the ProParaflu+ Assay on the Cepheid SmartCycler II. The
Positive Parainfluenza RNA Control was also included with each PCR panel
run. Each of two operators performed these activities on five days for a total of 10
reproducibility runs per site. A single lot of ProParaflu+ reagents was used. A
total of 358 data points were included in the reproducibility study data analysis
(12 samples and controls/run X 1 run/day/operator X 2 operators X 5 days X 3
sites = 360; 2 purified nucleic acid samples from site 1 (1 HPIV-1 medium
positive and 1 HPIV-2 low positive) were mistakenly combined following
extraction. These 2 samples were excluded from analysis). The total percent
agreement for the ProParaflu+ Assay was 97.8%. The ProParaflu+ Assay is a
qualitative assay based partially on numerical Cycle Threshold (Ct) values. The
overall Ct value %CV across all sites for all samples and controls ranged from
1.57% to 8.13% depending upon analyte type, target type, and concentration
tested.

important to detect HPIV and there are no differences in treatment of HPIV based
on HPIV type. This limitation was addressed in the following two ways: 1) In the
Interpretation of Specimen Results section of the ProParaflu+ Assay Instructions
for Use it is stated that “dual or multiple parainfluenza infections are rare, and
they may be artifacts of the SmartCycler Dx software due to signal bleed-over. It
is required that repeat testing for these samples be performed starting from the
purified nucleic acid, original sample, or a newly collected sample.” 2) In the
Limitation section of the ProParaflu+ Assay Instructions for Use it is also stated
that “dual or multiple parainfluenza infections are rare, and they may be
artifacts of the SmartCycler Dx software due to signal bleed-over. It is required
that repeat testing for these samples be performed starting from the purified
nucleic acid, original sample, or a newly collected sample.”
Also, there were two false HPIV-1 positive samples detected in HPIV-1 High
negative samples at Site 2. The Ct values for these two samples were 41.6 and
38.8. Low level carry-over/cross contamination could have occurred during
creation of the sample, during sample preparation for extraction, during extraction
or when transferring the purified nucleic acid samples from the sample cartridge to
microfuge tubes. (Note: since the high-negative samples include a low amount of
HPIV that is detectable no more than 5% of the time, the possibility of these two
samples actually being samples that fall in the 5% category can not be ruled out).
This limitation was addressed by including the following statements in the
Limitation section of the ProParaflu+ Assay Instructions for Use: “The detection
of viral nucleic acid is dependent upon proper specimen collection, handling,
transportation, storage, and preparation (including extraction). Failure to
observe proper procedures in any one of these steps can lead to incorrect
results.”; “There is a risk of false positive values resulting from cross-
contamination by target organism or its nucleic acids.”
Supplemental Reproducibility Study
Due to the fact that the clinical trial for the ProParaflu+ Assay resulted in more
than 10% of the clinical samples that were positive by the ProParaflu+ Assay with
Ct values beyond the mean Ct values of the LoDs (approximately 31 Ct for HPIV-
1, 29 Ct for HPIV-2 and 33 Ct for HPIV-3), but before the assay cutoff at 45
cycles, a supplemental Inter-Laboratory Reproducibility Study was also
conducted at three sites to evaluate inter-laboratory reproducibility of the
ProParaflu+ Assay (including variables of operator, instrument, location, and
time) with samples having a concentration below the assay’s Limit of Detection
(LoDs) but above the High Negatives previously tested in the reproducibility
study (i.e. “intermediate samples”). The Reproducibility Panel consisted of 3
nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples, one each spiked with HPIV-1, HPIV-2 or
HPIV-3 at 1 log below the LoD. Panel members were coded, stored at ≤ –70oC,
and shipped to the sites frozen.
A set of ten panels (30 total samples) was provided to each laboratory; one set

was used for each of the 5 testing days per operator. Each operator thawed one
panel set per day, spiked the samples and Negative Control with the Internal
Control, and performed nucleic acid extraction using either the bioMérieux
NucliSENS easyMAG (Sites 1 and 2) or the Roche MagNA Pure LC (Site 3). A
Negative Control, Extraction Control (a well characterized human parainfluenza 3
virus) and the Parainfluenza Positive RNA Control were included with each panel
run. Extracted nucleic acids were tested with the ProParaflu+ Assay on the
Cepheid SmartCycler II. Each of two operators performed these activities on five
days for a total of 10 supplemental reproducibility runs per site. A single lot of
ProParaflu+ reagents was used. A total of 180 data points were included in the
supplemental reproducibility study data analysis (6 samples and controls/run X 1
run/day/operator X 2 operators X 5 days X 3 sites = 180). The supplemental
reproducibility study data is presented in the following table and are the total
number of test results that agree with the expected results and the percent (%)
agreement. Although some fractions of the intermediate samples were anticipated
to be negative since the concentration was below the LoD, the % agreement was
calculated for an “expected” positive outcome:

*Agreement with Negative result
The percent positive for the “intermediate samples” across all sites was 56.7% for
HPIV-1 (mean Ct = 35.1), 86.7% for HPIV-2 (mean Ct = 33.0), and 30.0% for
HPIV-3 (mean Ct = 37.1). This result was expected as the “intermediate
concentration” should be positive between 5% - 95% (the “intermediate samples”
were of lower concentration than the LoD concentration (defined as ≥ 95%
positive) and higher than the High Negative concentration (defined as < 5%
positive)). This supplemental reproducibility data demonstrated that as expected
with all real-time PCR assays, the ProParaflu+ Assay may not generate
reproducibly positive results when testing samples that have analyte
concentrations lower than the LoD concentration, but higher than the assay cutoff
concentration. This limitation should be addressed by including the following
statement in the Limitation section of the ProParaflu+ Assay Instructions for Use:
“The ProParaflu+ Assay may not generate reproducibly positive results when
testing samples that have analyte concentrations lower than the LoD
concentration, but higher than the assay cutoff concentration.”
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls
The following controls are provided in the ProParaflu+ Assay kit:
Positive Control (PC): The ProParaflu+ Assay kit contains a parainfluenza
positive RNA control that consists of three RNA transcripts (specific for each
HPIV type 1, 2, and 3). These transcripts are derived from plasmids containing
the viral sequences of interest and are not intact virus particles. The Parainfluenza
PC contains unequal amounts of HPIV-1, HPIV-2 and HPIV-3. The approximate
concentration of each transcript was 5x104 copies/µl, 2.5 x 104 copies/µl and 2.5 x
103 copies/µl for HPIV-1, HPIV-2 and HPIV-3, respectively. The PC does not go
through nucleic acid isolation and purification, but is included during set-up of the
RT-PCR reaction. The PC in conjunction with the IC is used to verify reagent and
system performance. The PC is meant to be a control for global failure of the
assay (missing reaction component, instrument failure, etc.). Because the PC is
assessing global failure and the customer variance components were to be
determined during the clinical trial, a broad Ct range was desired. The acceptable
range was set to 20.0 to 40.0 in the Clinical Trial Protocol for all HPIV targets to
allow for dilution variability (e.g., pipetting) of the PC by the end users. Of a total
of 94 PC tested by the ProParaflu+ Assay during the clinical trial, 100% (94/94) of
these controls gave correct results. The average Ct of the PCs tested was 27.1
(Min 23.7- Max 30.0), with 1.22 Standard Deviation (STDEV) and 4.50% CV;
28.3 (Min 25.1- Max 30.6), with 1.08 Standard Deviation (STDEV) and 3.83%;
12

--- Page 13 ---
and 29.2 (Min 26.1- Max 31.7), with 1.05 Standard Deviation (STDEV) and 3.60
% CV for HPIV-1, HPIV-2, and HPIV-3 respectively. The pivotal clinical study
data validated the pre-determined PC Ct acceptance range of 20.0 to 40.0.
Internal Control (IC): An Internal RNA Control, a non-infectious RNA transcript,
is incorporated into every sample and is carried through all steps of the procedure
from nucleic acid isolation and purification through amplification to monitor for
inhibitors present in the specimen or reaction tube. The IC also serves as a general
process control ensuring that each step of the procedure was performed correctly,
assay and instrument parameters were set correctly, and that general reagents were
working. The IC is meant to assess global failure (reagent or process) and monitor
for PCR inhibition. Because the IC is assessing global failure and the customer
variance components were to be determined during the clinical trial, a broad Ct
range was desired. The acceptable range for the Internal Control (IC) was set to 15
- 50 Ct in the Clinical Trial Protocol to accommodate for dilution variability (e.g.
pipetting) by the user in spiking the IC, and also accommodate slight inhibition.
The average Ct of all eligible prospective ProParaflu+ Assay negative clinical
specimens was 27.8 (Min 24.5- Max 36.8), with 1.41 Standard Deviation
(STDEV) and 5.07 % CV. The average Ct of all eligible ProParaflu+ Assay
Negative Control was 27.4 (Min 24.8- Max 30.4), with 1.16 Standard Deviation
(STDEV) and 4.24% CV. The pivotal clinical study data validated the pre-
determined IC Ct acceptance range of 15.0 to 50.0.
These RNA transcripts (PC and IC) were serially diluted in molecular grade water
containing RNase Inhibitor at 1U/µL and made into the manufactured product
included in the ProParaflu+ Assay kit. They were tested for final release by
performing a prescribed dilution and using the ProParaflu+ Assay to ascertain the
cycles at which these dilutions cross the threshold (cutoff). The specifications for
final release are acceptable ranges of cycles at which the RNA control dilution can
cross the threshold. Final release specifications were formally established using
Test Method Characterization (TMC) then validated against the appropriate
analytical performance characteristics. Final release specifications were developed
to ensure First Pass Acceptance (FPA) rates of ≥ 99% at lot release and customer
rejection rate of ≤ 1% for a lot released at Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) (i.e.
95% probability of QC lot acceptance at lot release). For customer specifications,
the maximum allowable customer lot rejection rate at the Rejectable Quality Level
(RQL) Limit (i.e., 10% probability of QC acceptance at lot release) is 1%. A false
valid risk of ≤ 5% was used to determine the validity specifications.
QC release specification ranges were set using Operator Characteristics (OC)
curve analysis. Lot, technician, instrument, run, and replicate variance components
were obtained during test method characterization. Observed Ct means were
adjusted for stability effects and specifications determined to meet the validity and
the above mentioned specification requirements.
The sponsor proposed to revise the customer Ct specification range for the PC and

IC based on the clinical trial control data. For both controls, a two sided prediction
interval was determined using the observed clinical trial data, an alpha error of 1%
and 10,000 customer runs. For the PC and IC, the customer specifications were
modified per the prediction interval and adjusted to maintain internal process
capabilities:

The following controls are not provided in the ProParaflu+ Assay kit, but are
required or recommended and described in the ProParaflu+ Assay Instructions for
Use:
Negative Control (NC): A Negative Control (NC) is not provided with the kit, but
is required and described in the ProParaflu+ Assay Instructions for Use. Viral
transport media spiked with the IC is to be used as the negative control and
processed starting from nucleic acid isolation. The negative control serves to
monitor for contamination. Of a total of 95 NC tested by the ProParaflu+ Assay
during the clinical trial, 100% (95/95) of these controls gave correct results. The
average Ct of the IC in tested NC was 27.4 (Min 24.8- Max 30.4), with 1.16
Standard Deviation (STDEV) and 4.24% CV.
Extraction Control (EC): An Extraction Control (EC) is not provided with the kit,
however, during the clinical trial, a well characterized human parainfluenza 3
virus, was spiked with the IC and included with each nucleic acid isolation run as
EC. The EC serves to monitor for lysis and contamination during nucleic acid
isolation. Of a total of 133 EC tested by the ProParaflu+ Assay during the clinical
trial, 97.0% (129/133) of these controls gave correct results (3 HPIV-1 bleed-over,
and 1 HPIV-2 contamination). The average Ct of the EC (HPIV-3) tested was 27.8
(Min 24.8 - Max 30.6), with 1.16 Standard Deviation (STDEV) and 4.18 % CV.
The sponsor is recommending an extraction control in each nucleic acid
extraction run to the end users in the package insert.
Freeze/Thaw and Stability
Reagents and Controls stability
An Accelerated Stability study concluded that the ProParaflu+ Mix and controls
(closed and open tubes) can be stored at ≤ -70oC for up to 18 months.
A Freeze/Thaw Study demonstrated that the ProParaflu+ Mix can undergo up to 5

freeze-thaws. The Controls (Positive and Internal Control) can undergo up to 2
freeze-thaws. For the Controls, the ProParaflu+ Assay Package Insert specifies
that controls should not undergo more than 1 freeze-thaw cycle. Although internal
studies demonstrated that up to 2 freeze-thaws of controls would not adversely
affect performance. To mitigate risk it is recommended that they not undergo
more than 1 freeze-thaw.
Specimen stability
The ProParaflu+ Assay recommends that samples be stored refrigerated (2oC –
8oC) for up to 72 hours prior to processing the samples. This recommendation is
supported by a) The ProFlu+ Assay (detection of Influenza A, Influenza B and
RSV nucleic acid) and the Pro hMPV+ Assay (detection of human
Metapneumovirus (hMPV) nucleic acid) recommended that samples be stored
refrigerated (2oC – 8oC) for up to 72 hours prior to processing the samples.
Human parainfluenza viruses are members of the paramyxoviridae family along
with RSV and hMPV. It is reasonable to assume that the same sample stability
conditions that are recommended and used for culture as well as those used for
similar devices (ProFlu+ and Pro hMPV+) are applicable to human Parainfluenza
viruses and the ProParaflu+ Assay; b) A 72 hour timeframe is widely
recommended and used (CLSI Guidance M41 Viral Culture) for viral culture; c)
The viral transport medium that nasopharyngeal swab samples are collected in
also serves to further “preserve” and “stabilize” viruses, specifically influenza,
RSV and parainfluenza viruses to maintain their viability for culture and NAAT;
d) The CLSI Guidance: Collection, Transport, Preparation and Storage of
Specimens for Molecular Methods (MM13) does not specify requirements for
nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, but does recommend that bronchioalveolar lavage
samples be refrigerated for up to 72 hours or frozen (at -70oC) for longer periods
prior to processing for molecular methods.
Furthermore, the average time to extraction was 44 hours (Min. 17 hours to Max.
76 hours during the clinical trial. Site 1 has the longest average time to extraction
(48.2 hours) while Site 3 has the shortest time (35.9 hours). There was no
observed impact of times to extraction on HPIV-2 and HPIV-3 Ct values
generated from testing prospective clinical specimens.
The ProParaflu+ Assay also recommends that extracted nucleic acids that are not
run immediately after extraction may be stored at -70oC until RT-PCR testing, and
they should be tested after no more than one freeze-thaw cycle. This
recommendation is supported by a) Both CLSI guidance documents MM13
(Collection, Transport, Preparation and Storage of Specimens for Molecular
Methods) and MM17 (Verification and Validation of Multiplex Nucleic Acid
Assays) recommend storage of isolated RNA at -80oC and limiting the number of
freeze-thaw cycles before testing; b) Human parainfluenza viruses are members of
the paramyxoviridae family along with RSV and hMPV. It is reasonable to
assume that the same nucleic acids storage conditions that are recommended and
used for similar devices (ProFlu+ and Pro hMPV+) are applicable to human
15

Parainfluenza viruses and the ProParaflu+ Assay. In the Pro hMPV+ assay 510k
submission (k082688), the sponsor conducted the following two studies to support
the nucleic acids storage condition recommendations: 1) A study that compared
the extracted nucleic acid isolated from the Extraction Control (EC) during the
clinical trial being tested “fresh” or after undergoing one freeze-thaw cycle was
conducted. Sites 1 and 2 ran both “fresh” and “frozen” EC nucleic acids and t-test
analysis demonstrated that there is no significant difference between the two
conditions (p > 0.05 for each site); 2) A subset of hMPV positive samples from
the clinical trial were re-run from the purified nucleic acid at the same time the
reference assays were being set up. All of the samples in the subset were initially
run as “fresh” nucleic acids and the repeat testing was indicative of 1 freeze-thaw
cycle. Although a paired t-test analysis indicates that the mean Ct values of
hMPV-positive sample nucleic acids that have undergone one freeze-thaw cycle
are statistically different (p<0.05) than the mean Ct values of “fresh” hMPV-
positive sample nucleic acids, the mean Ct difference is clinically insignificant
(mean = 0.22; range = 0 – 1.5 Ct); c) Stability data for the ProParaflu+ Positive
RNA Control also supports the storage of RNA at ultralow temperature. The table
below compares the extracted nucleic acid isolated from the Extraction Control
(EC) during the Clinical and Reproducibility Studies. For the Reproducibility
Study the EC nucleic acid was run “fresh” for each run at all sites (n=60). During
the Clinical Study, Sites 1 and 2 ran all nucleic acids frozen (n = 36 and 39
respectively). There were 23 EC nucleic acid samples run “fresh” at Site 3
(frozen; n=9) and 3 at Site 4 (frozen; n=23). Comparing the two data sets by
student t-test indicates a statistically significant difference in mean Ct (p < 0.03).
However, as shown in the table below the mean Ct difference is only 0.53,
representing a theoretical 1.4-fold concentration difference, and the range of the
fresh Ct’s lies within the range of frozen Ct’s. So while the data are statistically
different, the difference is thought to be clinically insignificant.

The analytical sensitivity (limit of detection or LoD) of the ProParaflu+ Assay
was estimated using quantified (TCID /mL) cultures of viral strains of human
50
Parainfluenza virus (HPIV) types 1, 2 and 3 (HPIV-1 Strain C35, ATCC VR-94;
HPIV-2 Strain Greer, ATCC VR-92; and HPIV-3 Strain C243, ATCC VR-93)
serially diluted in negative nasopharyngeal (NP) pools prepared from leftover NP
swab clinical samples. Each viral strain was previously cultured and titered to
determine its stock concentration in TCID /mL. Each viral stock was spiked into
50
negative NP swab pools at concentrations of 1 log above, 1 log below, and at the
estimated LoD for that virus (based on preliminary studies). Two dilution series
were prepared for each viral stock by two operators for a total of 4 dilution series
per virus. An Internal RNA Control (IC) was spiked into all dilution series
samples prior to nucleic acid isolation. The IC monitors for PCR inhibition as
well as any reagent, procedural or instrumentation failure. Each dilution series
was extracted on the Roche MagNA Pure LC and tested in quintuplicate reactions
using two lots of ProParaflu+ reagents on multiple (4) Cepheid SmartCycler II
instruments. This resulted in a total of 20 data points (20 RT-PCR replicates per
concentration, not 20 individual nucleic acid extractions per concentration) per
viral strain dilution. A negative control, which consisted of negative NP swab
matrix spiked with IC was included with each set of dilution series. Nucleic acid
isolation of the negative control was performed along with the viral strain dilution
series. The negative control served to monitor for contamination during the
testing procedure or the presence of inhibitors in the sample matrix. The
Parainfluenza Positive RNA Control, non-infectious in vitro transcribed RNA of
specific HPIV-1, HPIV-2 and HPIV-3 viral sequences, was included with each
RT-PCR run to test for procedural errors (absence of reagent, instrument failure,
etc.).
Analytical sensitivity was estimated for each virus strain. The LoD was estimated
as the lowest concentration that was detected ≥95% of the time (i.e. concentration
at which at least 19 out of 20 replicates were determined to be positive). The data
are presented in the following table:

LoD confirmation studies using the Roche MagNA Pure LC
The estimated analytical sensitivity (limit of detection or LoD) of the ProParaflu+
Assay was confirmed/determined using quantified (TCID /mL) cultures of viral
50
strains of human Parainfluenza virus (HPIV) types 1, 2 and 3 (HPIV-1 Strain C35,
ATCC VR-94; HPIV-2 Strain Greer, ATCC VR-92; and HPIV-3 Strain C243,
ATCC VR-93) diluted in negative nasopharyngeal (NP) pools prepared from
leftover NP swab clinical samples. Each viral strain was previously cultured and
titered to determine its stock concentration in TCID /mL. Each viral stock was
50
spiked into negative NP swab pools at concentrations of the estimated LoD for
that virus (based on LoD estimation studies). The spiked pools were then divided
into 20 individual aliquots. An Internal RNA Control (IC) was spiked into all
samples prior to nucleic acid isolation. The IC monitors for PCR inhibition as
well as any reagent, procedural or instrumentation failure. Each aliquot was
extracted on the Roche MagNA Pure LC and tested in single RT-PCR reactions
using a single lot of ProParaflu+ reagents on multiple Cepheid SmartCycler II
instruments. This resulted in a total of 20 data points (20 individual nucleic acid
extractions) per viral strain dilution. A negative control, which consisted of
negative NP swab matrix spiked with IC was included with each set of dilution
series. Nucleic acid isolation of the negative control was performed along with the
viral strain dilution series. The negative control served to monitor for
contamination during the testing procedure or the presence of inhibitors in the
sample matrix. The Parainfluenza Positive RNA Control, non-infectious in vitro
transcribed RNA of specific HPIV-1, HPIV-2 and HPIV-3 viral sequences, was
included with each RT-PCR run to test for procedural errors (absence of reagent,
instrument failure, etc.).
Analytical sensitivity was determined/confirmed for each virus strain. The LoD
was confirmed as the lowest concentration that was detected ≥95% of the time
(i.e. concentration at which at least 19 out of 20 replicates were determined to be
positive). For HPIV-3 a ≥95% detection rate was not achieved at 1 x 101
TCID /mL, thus a 5 x 101 TCID /mL dilution of HPIV-3 was generated and a
50 50
total of 20 samples at that concentration were tested. The data are presented in the

Extraction Equivalency Study
To evaluate the equivalency of nucleic acid extraction using the Roche MagNA
Pure LC (used throughout ProParaflu+ Assay development and Analytical
Studies, Clinical Trials and Reproducibility) and the bioMérieux NucliSens
easyMAG automated extraction instruments (used in Clinical Trials and
Reproducibility) for use with the ProParaflu+ Assay, an extraction equivalency
study was carried out to determine and compare the Limit of Detection (LoD) for
human Parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV-3) on each automated extractor.
The Roche MagNA Pure LC is an automated nucleic acid isolation and
purification system based upon binding of nucleic acids to glass particles and has
the capability to process a total of 32 reactions within one run. Nucleic acid is
purified in multiple plastic reaction tips and cartridges by several steps that
include cell lysis and binding of nucleic acid to magnetic glass particles, wash
steps, and a heated elution to unbind the nucleic acid from the glass particles.
The bioMérieux NucliSens easyMAG is an automated nucleic acid isolation and
purification system that is based upon the same silica extraction technology as the
MagNA Pure. The easyMAG is capable of processing a total of 24 reactions with
variable sample types, sample volumes, and elution volumes within a single run.
Nucleic acid is purified within a single cartridge by several steps that include lysis
and binding of nucleic acid to high affinity magnetic silica beads, a series of wash
steps and heated elution of purified nucleic acid from the silica beads.
For the Extraction Equivalency LoD Study, HPIV-3 (Strain C 243,ATCC VR-93;
1x107.2 TCID /ml) was spiked (along with an IC) into individual aliquots of
50
negative nasopharyngeal swab (NP) matrix pools at concentrations of 1 log above,
at, and 1 log below the preliminary limit of detection (LoD) (as determined by a
preliminary Analytical Sensitivity Study). Each viral strain dilution was extracted
in replicates of 10 on each automated extractor. An Extraction Control and a
Negative Control (NP spiked with Internal Control - NPIC) were included in each
run on each extractor.
The 10 extractions of each of the three concentrations from both extraction
instruments (total of 30 samples) for a specific virus were tested using the
ProParaflu+ Assay (a single ProParaflu+ mastermix). Included with each run was
the Parainfluenza RNA Positive Control and the relevant NPICs from each
automated extraction run for the specific samples being tested. A total of 10 data
points were generated at each virus dilution per extraction instrument. Results
were analyzed as specified in the ProParaflu+ Instructions for Use. This study
was limited to one operator, one extraction instrument (one easyMAG and one
MagNA Pure LC), and one lot of instrument specific extraction reagents per
19

--- Page 20 ---
instrument, one lot of ProParaflu+ reagents.
LoD for each extractor was determined by ≥95% positivity at a specific
concentration and are presented in the following table:

The mean Ct values for the easyMAG were slightly lower than the MagNA Pure
at each HPIV-3 concentration tested. The average Ct values between the
extractors differed by 1.1 (102 TCID /mL) and 0.3 (101 TCID /mL) Ct’s which
50 50
represent less than a half-log change in concentration. These differences are
statistically significant at 102 TCID /ml (p=0.004) but not statistically significant
50
at 101 TCID /ml (p=0.494). The values at both concentrations are not clinically
50
significant given the theoretical change in concentration is less than a log.
This limited study demonstrated that the easyMAG may have some
performance advantage over the MagNA Pure in regards to Analytical
Sensitivity of HPIV-3. Moreover, it is reasonable to assume any performance
claims made using the MagNA Pure with the ProParaflu+ Assay should be
achievable using the easyMAG. Clinical trial and reproducibility studies also
support comparable performance of both automated extraction systems.
e. Analytical Reactivity:
Due to minimal genetic or antigenic variability over the years and the fact that
only single strains of HPIV 1-3 are commercially available, a Ubiquity/Reactivity
study was not performed for the ProParaflu+ Assay. It is acceptable.
f. Analytical specificity:
The analytical specificity of the ProParaflu+ Assay was determined with a panel
of 52 viral, bacterial and yeast (27 viruses, 24 bacteria, and 1 yeast) strains of
common respiratory pathogens or flora commonly present in the nasopharynx. All

the viral strains were obtained from ATCC or University of Iowa and cultured and
titered by Tricore Reference Laboratories (Albuquerque, NM) except for human
Metapneumovirus (hMPV) which was cultured and titered by ZeptoMetrics
(Buffalo, NY). The majority of cultured and titered bacterial and yeast strains
were obtained from MicroBioLogics, Inc. (St. Cloud, MN). A few others were
obtained from ATCC and cultured and titered by the Clinical Microbiology
Laboratory at Resurrection Medical Center (Chicago, IL) or Waukesha Memorial
Hospital (Waukesha, WI). None of the facilities listed above were able to provide
fresh cultured and titered stocks of C. pneumoniae or C. trachomatis. Additional
laboratories (commercial and private) were contacted, but none were able to
provide titered cultures at a reasonable cost and timeframe. Thus, ATCC frozen
cultures were used and ATCC supplied titers were used for C. pneumoniae and C.
trachomatis.
Aliquots of a negative nasopharygeal (NP) swab pool matrix were spiked with the
analytical specificity organisms at concentrations of 103 TCID /ml – 106
50
TCID /ml for viruses and 106 CFU/ml – 7.4 x 107 CFU/ml for the bacterial and
50
yeast strains. The ProParaflu+ Internal Control (IC) was spiked into all samples
prior to nucleic acid isolation. A Negative Control, which consisted of the M4 viral
transport media spiked with the IC, was included and nucleic acid isolation of the
negative control was performed along with Analytical Specificity Panel samples.
The Parainfluenza Positive Control and was included with each detection run to
test for global failure. The Analytical Specificity Panel samples and the Negative
Control were extracted on the Roche MagNA Pure LC and tested in triplicate on a
Cepheid SmartCycler II using one lot of ProParaflu+ reagents.

* A few laboratories (commercial and private) were contacted, but none were able to provide
titered cultures at a reasonable cost and timeframe. Thus, ATCC frozen cultures were used and
ATCC supplied titers were used for C. pneumoniae and C. trachomatis.
g. Assay cut-off:
The “cutoff value” represents the fluorescent intensity signal level (reported in
Relative Fluorescent Units) at which a “positive” reaction reaches a relative
fluorescent intensity above the background or baseline of a “negative” reaction.

If a sample exceeds the threshold in a detection channel during PCR, the sample
is considered positive for that channel. If the sample does not exceed the
threshold for a detection channel by the last PCR cycle, the sample is considered
negative for that channel.
Cutoff Determination and Confirmation studies were conducted with two
operators and two reagent lots.
Cutoff values (RFUs) were determined upon completion of the Cutoff
Determination Study which included a training set of 58 negative and simulated
positive samples prepared from individual NP swab clinical samples. Specifically,
individual samples (n = 6) were spiked with each type of HPIV (1, 2 and 3) at 3
logs above Limit of Detection (LoD) representing high positive NP swab samples.
Individual samples (n = 18) were spiked with each type of HPIV (1, 2 and 3) at 2
times LoD representing low positive NP swab samples. 34 samples were left
unspiked. The high and low positive samples, as well as 30 negative samples
were spiked with the Internal Control. Four (4) negative samples were not spiked
with the Internal Control. Each series was extracted using the Roche MagNA Pure
LC. A negative viral transport media control spiked with IC was included with
each extraction run. The extracted nucleic acids and the Parainfluenza Positive
RNA Control and the IC diluted in water were run on the Cepheid SmartCycler II.
The cutoff values were then verified in the Cutoff Confirmation Study against a
set of clinical samples and controls (32 HPIV-1 positive, 32 HPIV-2 positive, 48
HPIV-3 positive, 36 HPIV negative NP swab samples and controls). The
determined cutoff was confirmed if ≥90% sensitivity and specificity was attained
for each channel with the above mentioned set of clinical samples and controls. In
addition, 18 Parainfluenza RNA Controls, 16 ICs in TM and 4 Negative Controls
were also tested in the Cutoff Confirmation Study.
In the FAM, TET, TxR and Cy5 channels, the final RFUs for all samples of the
positives and negatives demonstrated minimal overlap. For a given detection, a
range of possible cutoffs was generated by determining robust lower and upper
boundaries of the threshold, based on final RFU that would minimize false
positives and false negatives. A Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC) analysis
was performed for HPIV-1, HPIV-2, HPIV-3 and Internal Control threshold
settings. In addition, population distribution statistics were analyzed to aid in
selecting a cutoff threshold.
Acceptable ranges for the potential cutoff were generated in the following
manners: 1) ROC curves for HPIV-1, HPIV-2, HPIV-3 and Internal Control
cutoffs were generated. The threshold range that yielded the maximum accuracy
was identified. 2) The distributions of the negatives and positives were first
assessed for normality. a) If normal, the averages and standard deviations of the
final RFU were calculated. For the lower limit of the acceptable range of cutoff,
negative samples were analyzed. The lower threshold was defined as the average
23

--- Page 24 ---
final RFU plus three standard deviations of the negatives, that is, the point at
which greater than 99% of true negatives are expected to fall below assuming
normality. Similarly, the upper limit of the acceptable range of cutoff threshold
was determined using positives and was defined as the average final RFU minus
three standard deviations. This is the point at which at least 99% of true positives
are expected to be greater than, assuming normality. b) If the distribution was not
normal, for the negatives the lower limit of the cutoff threshold range was defined
minimally as the 97.5% percentile. For the positives the upper limit of the cutoff
threshold range was defined maximally as the 2.5% percentile. 3) After settings
were finalized the clinical samples were evaluated for sensitivity and specificity.
The cutoffs used in the Cutoff Determination and Confirmation Studies are
presented in the following table:

Analysis settings and threshold settings were determined for FAM (60), TET
(40), Texas Red (50), and Cy5 (40). These settings produced ≥90% sensitivity
and specificity in the original set of samples used during Cutoff Determination
and met all acceptance criteria for the subsequent Cutoff Confirmation study,
achieving 96.9-100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Therefore, cutoff values
were confirmed as acceptable for use during the clinical trials and all subsequent
analytical studies

i. Interfering Substances:
An interfering substances study was carried out to examine whether a panel of
endogenous and exogenous potential RT-PCR inhibitors affected the
performance of the ProParaflu+ Assay. Blood, mucin, or medications
(prescription and over-the-counter) for relief of congestion, sore throat, allergy
and asthma symptoms were spiked into simulated human Parainfluenza
(HPIV) positive NP samples. A single strain of HPIV-3 (Strain C 243 (ATCC
VR-93); 1x107.2 TCID /ml) was used and spiked into NP pools at 2X Limit of
50
Detection (LoD) and 1 log above LoD. (Note: The LoD had only been
estimated in an Analytical Sensitivity Estimation Study. The LoD for HPIV-3
was later established and confirmed in the Analytical Sensitivity Confirmation
Study to be 5x101 TCID /ml.) High clinically relevant amounts of the
50
potential inhibiting substances were added to spiked samples. An Internal
Control (IC) was added to each sample. Nucleic acid from the samples was
extracted with the Roche MagNA Pure LC. ProParaflu+ Assay was performed
in triplicate reactions for each sample on the Cepheid SmartCycler II. Any
substance in which detection of HPIV-3 at 10X LoD was not observed was
considered an inhibitor of PCR. A Negative Control, which consisted of M4
viral transport media spiked with an IC, was included with Interfering
Substances Panel samples. The Parainfluenza Positive Control and was
included with each detection run to test for global errors.
The following table shows the interfering substances used for this study. As
described in the justification column, the concentrations spiked directly into

TCID /ml), although the LoD for HPIV-3 was later established and confirmed in
50
the Analytical Sensitivity Confirmation Study to be 5x101 TCID /ml. All three
50
replicates were not detected for the sample containing the Chloraseptic® sore
throat lozenge, two of three replicates were not detected for the sample containing
Relenza, and 1 of three replicates was not detected for sample containing Rebitol.
None of the potential interferants inhibited detection of HPIV-3 at 1 log above
LoD in all replicates. As the low concentration of HPIV-3 used may have a lower
than 95% detection rate, it cannot be ruled out that HPIV-3 was not detected due
to testing at just below the Assay LoD rather than an effect of the substances
present. (No inhibition was observed at the 102 TCID /ml HPIV-3 concentration
50
for samples containing Chloraseptic® sore throat lozenge, Relenza and Rebitol.)
The Interfering Substances Study results demonstrated that there are no interfering
substances that significantly inhibit the detection of HPIV-3 nucleic acid using the
ProParaflu+ Assay (per the pre-determined study acceptance criteria). Interfering

was assessed. Simulated samples were tested with and without IC to determine
if the presence of the IC inhibited the reaction. Two sets of IC Interference
Panel members were prepared by spiking serial dilutions of cultured and titered
(TCID /mL) strains of human Parainfluenza virus (HPIV) types 1, 2 and 3 into
50
individual aliquots of negative nasopharyngeal (NP) swab pools at
concentrations of 1 log below and at the preliminary Limit of Detection (LoD)
(as estimated in the Analytical Sensitivity Estimation Study). The IC was added
to one set of IC Interference Panel samples prior to nucleic acid isolation; the
second set did not contain the IC. Two negative controls were generated which
consisted of negative NP swab matrix with or without the Internal Control.
Nucleic acid isolation of the negative controls was performed along with the IC
Interference Panel samples. The negative control served to monitor for
contamination during the testing procedure or in the case of negative control
spiked with IC, also served to monitor for the presence of inhibitors in the
sample matrix. The Parainfluenza Positive RNA Control was included with each
RT-PCR run to test for global errors (absence of reagent, instrument failure,
etc.). The Positive Control does not require nucleic acid isolation and was
diluted just prior to set up of RT-PCR reactions.
Each virus dilution was split into two aliquots and extracted on the Roche
MagNA Pure LC. The purified nucleic acids from each duplicate extraction
were combined (100 µL total volume) and tested with the ProParaflu+ Assay in
10 replicate RT-PCR reactions using 1 lot of ProParaflu+ reagents on the
Cepheid Smartcycler II. This resulted in a total of 10 data points for each viral
strain at each concentration spiked with IC and 10 data points for each viral
strain at each concentration without the IC. Note: Since greater than 95% of the
replicates at 1 log below LoD were positive for HPIV-2, an additional dilution
series was generated using concentrations of 1 log below and 2 logs below the
estimated LoD for HPIV-2. Nucleic acid extraction and RT-PCR testing were
repeated on these new dilutions.
Competitive inhibition of the IC was assessed by comparing the percent of
samples detected at concentrations of 1 log below and at the LoD of each viral
strain when spiked with or without the IC. Competitive inhibition was to be
considered if the presence of the IC decreased the sensitivity (LoD) of the
ProParaflu+ Assay.

LoD
* = Repeat testing summary results
Note: The differences in detection at 1 or 2 logs below LoD analyte
concentrations are not necessarily attributable to the presence or absence of the
IC as variable detection rates of HPIV are expected below the assay’s LoD and
confirmed by the Analytical Sensitivity Study.
No competitive inhibition at the assay LoD was observed for detection of
HPIV-1, -2 or -3 in the presence IC using the ProParaflu+ Assay.
k. Competitive Inhibition Study
Effects of competitive inhibition on the ProParaflu+ Assay when two of the
Assay’s target organisms are present in a single sample were evaluated in the
Competitive Inhibition Study. The competition between HPIV types was
examined at varying concentrations of HPIV in combinations of high/high and
high/low concentrations. Samples containing only one HPIV type were run at
both concentrations to act as controls. Each HPIV type was spiked into negative
NP pools at final concentrations of two (HPIV-1 and HPIV-2) or three (HPIV-3)
logs above LoD and at 2X LoD (HPIV-1 and HPIV-2) and 10X LoD (HPIV-3)
(preliminary LoD as determined by a preliminary Analytical Sensitivity Study).
An Internal RNA Control (IC) was spiked into all panel samples prior to nucleic
acid isolation. The IC monitors for PCR inhibition as well as any reagent,
procedural or instrumentation failure. Each sample in the Dual Positive Panel
was extracted on the Roche MagNA Pure LC and tested in triplicate RT-PCR
reactions with one lot of ProParaflu+ reagents. A negative control, which
consists of negative NP swab matrix spiked with IC, was included in the Panel
testing. Nucleic acid isolation of the negative control was performed along with
panel samples. The negative control serves to monitor for contamination during
the testing procedure or the presence of inhibitors in the sample matrix. The
Parainfluenza Positive RNA Control was included with each RT-PCR run to test
for procedural errors (absence of reagent, instrument failure, etc.).

l. Carry-Over Contamination:
To evaluate the degree of carry-over/cross-contamination that occurs with the
use of the ProParaflu+ Assay in association with nucleic acid extraction on the
Roche MagNA Pure LC and the bioMérieux NucliSens easyMAG instruments
and PCR on the Cepheid SmartCycler II thermocycler, an internal Carry-Over
study was carried out by testing simulated human Parainfluenza type 2 (HPIV-2)
high positive samples run in series with HPIV-2 high negative samples over 5
runs. The High Positive samples consisted of negative nasopharyngeal (NP)
swab matrix spiked with a high concentration of HPIV-2, strain Greer at 2 logs
above the Limit of Detection (LoD). High Positive samples represented the
upper range of Ct values (~23 - 25 Ct) obtained in the ProParaflu+ clinical trials
(The Ct range of the true positives for HPIV-2 in the clinical trials was 23.9 –
34.4). High Negative samples consisted of negative NP swab matrix spiked
with a concentration of HPIV-2 below but near the analytical LoD concentration
(3 logs below LoD) such that > 95% of samples should be negative. The
samples were processed and extracted in a “High Positive/High Negative”
alternating fashion (i.e. checkerboard pattern) on the bioMérieux NucliSENS
easyMAG and likewise processed on the Roche MagNA Pure LC and run on the
Cepheid SmartCycler II instrument in an alternating fashion. A negative control
(viral transport medium) spiked with the IC was also included with each

however this was not consistent by extraction instrument or by extraction run.
As repeat testing starting from the purified nucleic acid demonstrated negative
results, potential contamination could have occurred when transferring the
purified nucleic acid samples from the sample cartridge to microfuge tubes or
during the RT-PCR set-up. However, the possibility that these samples fall into
the 5% category of High Negatives could not be ruled out. HPIV-1 and -3
positives were also found in both positive (3) and negative (1) samples, which
may indicate contamination from the positive control or from the environment
due to the high volume of Parainfluenza testing that occurred prior to and during
performance of the Carryover Study. Repeat ProParaflu+ results of these
samples were negative for HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 when the purified nucleic acid
was retested.
This ProParaflu+ Carryover Study demonstrated that low level carry-over/cross
contamination with the ProParaflu+ Assay using either the Roche MagNA Pure
LC or the bioMériuex NucliSens easyMAG automated nucleic acid extraction
instruments and the Cepheid Smartcycler II could happen. Therefore, the
following statements were included in the Limitations section to address the
potential of cross-contamination when performing the assay: “The detection of
viral nucleic acid is dependent upon proper specimen collection, handling,
transportation, storage, and preparation (including extraction). Failure to
observe proper procedures in any one of these steps can lead to incorrect
results.”; “There is a risk of false positive values resulting from cross-
contamination by target organisms, their nucleic acids or amplified
product, or from non-specific signals in the assay.”
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable.
b. Matrix Description and Comparison:
Analytical performance of the ProParaflu+ Assay using six different viral
transport media (VTM) was evaluated. Analytical sensitivity was determined
using cultured and titered strains of human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV-1 C35,
HPIV-2 Greer, and HPIV-3 C243) spiked into each of the different VTMs. The
VTM were considered “equivalent” if similar Limits of Detection (LoD) were
achieved for each.
The intended use of Remel M4, M5, and M6, Copan Universal Transport
Medium (UTM), and Becton Dickinson Universal Viral Transport (UVT) is for
the transport of clinical specimens containing viruses, chlamydiae, mycoplasma,
and ureaplasma from the collection site to the laboratory for microbiological

procedures. Remel M4RT VTM is for the transport of clinical specimens
containing viruses or chlamydiae, but is not recommended for the transport of
mycoplasmas and ureaplasmas. The VTMs have essentially the same
components as shown in the table below:

Cultured and titered viruses were spiked at one log above, at, and one log below
their limit of detection (as determined in the ProParaflu+ Analytical Sensitivity
Study using M4) along with an Internal RNA Control into each of the media.
Samples were extracted using the bioMerieux NucliSens easyMAG and tested in
triplicate RT-PCR reactions on the Cepheid Smartcycler II using one lot of
ProParaflu+ reagents. Negative Controls consisted of each of the six different
VTM spiked with IC. Nucleic acid isolation of the Negative Controls was
performed along with the VTM study samples. The Negative Controls serve to
monitor for contamination or the presence of inhibitors. A ProParaflu+ Positive
Control was included with each run to test for global errors (absence of reagents,
instrument failure, etc.). The Positive Control did not require nucleic acid
isolation and was diluted just prior to set up of RT-PCR reactions.
Media were considered “equivalent” to Remel M4 (the reference standard) if:
a) for each virus and strain, all three replicates for at least one concentration
was positive and within one log of the lowest concentration in which all 3
replicates of M4 are positive, and
b) the average C values at all concentrations in which 3 of 3 replicates were
T
positive for each virus did not differ by more than 3 C s from the average C
T T
of that virus diluted in M4.
Each of the VTM performed “equivalently” to Remel M4 as they all met the

3. Clinical studies:
a. Prospective Clinical studies
The clinical performance of the ProParaflu+ Assay was established during
prospective studies at 4 U.S. clinical laboratories during May 2008 to September
2009. All specimens used in the study meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria
represented excess, remnants of nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens that were
prospectively collected from symptomatic individuals suspected of respiratory
infection, and were submitted for routine care or analysis by each site, and that
otherwise would have been discarded. Individual specimens were delinked from all
patient identifiers and given a study sample code. All clinical sites were granted
waivers of informed consent by their IRBs for this study. Inclusion criteria included,
but were not limited to: the specimen was from a symptomatic patient (for
respiratory infection) that was submitted for routine respiratory pathogen testing; the
specimen was a NP swab in appropriate viral transport media (i.e. Remel M4 or M5
viral transport medium); the specimen contained adequate volume for performing
the culture and the ProParaflu+ Assay; age and gender information were available;
specimen was stored properly (refrigerated at 2oC – 8oC); and initiation of the
culture and the ProParaflu+ Assay (nucleic acid extraction) took place within 72
hours of sample collection.

Performance of the ProParaflu+ Assay was assessed and compared to the reference
method of culture followed by direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) for differentiation
of HPIV types. For site 1 and 3, the reference method consisted of traditional cell
culture using Rhesus Monkey Kidney (RMK) cells (Viromed, Minnetonka, MN)
followed by hemadsorption (HAd) using guinea pig red blood cells. Samples
determined to be positive by HAd were then stained for HPIV typing using DFA
and the Parainfluenza Virus Screening and Identification Kit (Light Diagnostics,
Temecula, CA). One HPIV positive and one negative (uninoculated tube) was run
with each set of samples. Samples were determined to be negative if there was no
HAd observed after 10 days or if the DFA was negative for HPIV. Samples were
determined to be positive if the HAd test was positive and the HPIV DFA was
positive for either HPIV-1, -2 or -3. For site 2 and 4, the reference method consisted
of rapid cell culture using Mv1Lu/A549 cells (R-Mix, Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc,
Athens, OH). Shell vials were set up in duplicate and one vial was stained after 48
hours with a mixture of monoclonal antibodies (Influenza A, Influenza B, RSV,
Parainfluenza 1, Parainfluenza 2, Parainfluenza 3, and Adenovirus) using the
Respiratory Panel 1 Virus Screening and Identification Kit (Light Diagnostics,
Temecula, CA). If the screen was positive, an 8 well slide was prepared using the
second well and the cells were tested with individual monoclonal antibodies for
each of the above 7 viruses. One positive (rotating among Influenza A, Influenza B,
RSV, Parainfluenza 1, Parainfluenza 2, Parainfluenza 3 and Adenovirus) and one
negative (uninoculated well) was run with each set of samples. A control slide
containing wells with cell culture derived positive and negative control cells
(provided with the Respiratory Panel 1 Screening Kit) was also run each time the
staining procedure was performed. Samples were determined to be positive if bright
green fluorescence was observed in cells, negative if no staining was observed in
cells, and invalid or toxic if non-specific staining or dead cells were observed.
A total of 857 eligible prospective NP swab samples (407 from female patients and
450 from male patients) were tested with the ProParaflu+ Assay and with the
reference method at the 4 clinical sites. The NP swab specimens underwent nucleic
acid extraction using either the Roche MagNA Pure Total Nucleic Acid Isolation
Kit on the MagNA Pure LC Instrument (Site 4) or using the bioMérieux NucliSENS
easyMAG instrument with Automated Magnetic Extraction Reagents (Sites 1, 2, 3).
An Internal RNA Control (IC) was added to every NP swab sample. A Negative
Control which consisted of viral transport medium and an Extraction Control (a well
characterized human parainfluenza 3 virus) were included with each extraction run.
Purified nucleic acids were further processed immediately following extraction or
were stored frozen (≤-70oC) and thawed prior to ProParaflu+ Assay set-up. Nucleic
acid detection was performed using the ProParaflu+ Assay on the Cepheid
SmartCycler II.
The overall assay failure rate of the ProParaflu+ Assay during the clinical trials due
to failure of positive, negative or extraction controls not related to procedural errors
was 0.9% (total of 1 of 113 runs across all 4 sites). In this run the NC failed due to
36

--- Page 37 ---
no detection of the IC. Upon repeat testing starting from the purified nucleic acid
from the NC and all samples the NC was Valid and the repeat run results accepted
and used in final analysis.
A total of 1015 prospective respiratory specimens were initially included in the
clinical trial. One hundred thirty eight (138) samples (56 samples from Site 1, 60
samples from Site 2, 17 samples from Site 3, and 5 samples from Site 4) were
excluded from the clinical study due to >72 hours from time of collection to
ProParaflu+ Assay testing and/or culture testing. Five (5) specimens (all from Site
1) were excluded because of improper sample type. Twelve (12) samples (all from
Site 1) were excluded because they had data from only one method (ProParaflu+ or
culture). One (1) sample was excluded because it had too few cells to culture (from
Site 1). And 2 samples (1 from Site 2 and 1 from Site 4) were excluded because they
remained “Unresolved” after repeat testing. Of the ProParaflu+ Assay run on all
eligible specimens, 99.2% (852/857) of these specimens were successful on the first
attempt (Site 1: 124/126 = 98.4%; Site 2: 455/456 = 99.8%; Site 3: 182/182 =
100.0%; Site 4: 91/93 = 97.8%). The remaining 5 gave “Unresolved” results on the
first attempt (2 from Site 1, 1 from Site 2, none from Site 3, and 2 from Site 4).
Unresolved results occur when the sample is negative for all three HPIVs and the
Internal Control, indicating potentially PCR-inhibiting samples. Of the 5
“Unresolved” specimens on the first attempt with sufficient sample for retest, only
60.0% (3/5) gave a valid result on the second attempt (2 from Site 1 and 1 from Site
4). The remaining 2 were “Unresolved” on the second attempt (both were tested
negative by the culture reference method), therefore, were not eligible for inclusion
in the data analysis.
Site poolability of performance data was determined based on the fact that similar
ProParaflu+ performance were obtained from the 4 clinical sites:

Samples that did not yield the same results between ProParaflu+ and viral culture
were considered “discrepant”. The ProParaflu+ Clinical Trial Discrepant Analysis
was designed to study these discrepancies by performing RT-PCR on the original
purified nucleic acids followed by bi-directional sequencing of the resultant PCR
product to determine the presence or absence of ProParaflu+ Assay target viruses
(HPIV-1, -2, or -3). Oligonucleotide primer sets used were derived from literature
and were specific for each HPIV type (1, 2 and 3). The gene target was the
hemagglutinin gene, but primers targeted a different region than the ProParaflu+
Assay. Samples were sequenced using both the forward or reverse PCR primers
used in the PCR reaction.
The performance data from all study sites combined with discrepant analysis results
as footnotes are presented in the following table:

b. Retrospective Clinical studies
Throughout the course of the study, only 17 prospective HPIV-1 positive samples as
determined by the ProParaflu+ Assay were found at any of the four clinical sites. A
total of 91 retrospective samples that included 29 HPIV-1 positive and 62 HPIV-1
negative NP swab samples were tested at Sites 2, 3 and 4. These samples (obtained
from Sites 2 and 3) had been previously determined to be HPIV-1 positive or
negative by direct DFA testing on fresh specimens and were then subsequently
frozen at –70oC. These data were analyzed separately from the prospective samples
and are summarized in the following table:

NucliSENS® easyMAG™ System (bioMérieux)
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Cepheid Smart Cycler II Real Time instrument with Dx software version 1.7b
or 3.0a is used to perform real time reverse transcription, PCR amplification and
detection of nucleic acid. Five other nucleic acid amplification tests that use the
Smart Cycler II instrument have received 510(k) clearance: Prodesse’s ProhMPV+
Assay (K082688) and ProFlu+ Assay (K081030), IDI-MRSA test (K033415), the
IDI-Strep B Assay (K022504), and the Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Virus
Real-Time RT-PCR Primer and Probe Set (K060159). The Cepheid SmartCycler
instrument is an integrated nucleic acid amplification and detection instrument
system based on Cepheid’s proprietary microprocessor-controlled I-CORE
module. For purified RNA samples, the SmartCycler instrument enables reverse-
transcriptase (RT) to transcribe target viral RNA into cDNA, polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) for the amplification of cDNA, and hybridization of fluorogenic
target-specific probes for the detection of the amplified cDNA.
The Roche MagNA Pure LC is an automated nucleic acid isolation and
purification system based upon binding of nucleic acids to glass particles and has
the capability to process a total of 32 reactions within one run. Nucleic acid is
purified in multiple plastic reaction tips and cartridges by several steps that
include cell lysis and binding of nucleic acid to magnetic glass particles, wash
steps, and a heated elution to unbind the nucleic acid from the glass particles. Four
other tests that use the Roche MagNA Pure LC system have received 510(k)
clearance: Prodesse’s ProhMPV+ Assay (K082688) and ProFlu+ Assay
(K081030), Roche Factor V Leiden Kit (K033607) and the Roche Factor II
(Prothrombin) G20210A Kit (K033612).
The bioMérieux NucliSens easyMAG is an automated nucleic acid isolation and
purification system that is based upon the same silica extraction technology as the
MagNA Pure. The easyMAG is capable of processing a total of 24 reactions with
variable sample types, sample volumes, and elution volumes within a single run.
Nucleic acid is purified within a single cartridge by several steps that include lysis
and binding of nucleic acid to high affinity magnetic silica beads, a series of wash
steps and heated elution of purified nucleic acid from the silica beads. Prodesse’s
ProFlu+ Assay (K081030) that received Special 510(k) clearance and Prodesse’s
ProhMPV+ Assay (K082688) also use the easyMAG system for automated
nucleic acid extraction.

User enters Patient ID/Sample ID by typing it in.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Not applicable
5. Calibration:
Not applicable
6. Quality Control:
The following controls are provided in the ProParaflu+ Assay kit:
Positive Control (PC): The ProParaflu+ Assay kit contains a parainfluenza
positive RNA control that consists of three RNA transcripts (specific for each
HPIV type 1, 2, and 3). These transcripts are derived from plasmids containing
the viral sequences of interest and are not intact virus particles. The Parainfluenza
PC contains unequal amounts of HPIV-1, HPIV-2 and HPIV-3. The approximate
concentration of each transcript was 5x104 copies/µl, 2.5 x 104 copies/µl and 2.5 x
103 copies/µl for HPIV-1, HPIV-2 and HPIV-3, respectively. The PC does not go
through nucleic acid isolation and purification, but is included during set-up of the
RT-PCR reaction. The PC in conjunction with the IC is used to verify reagent and
system performance.
An Internal RNA Control, a non-infectious RNA transcript, is incorporated into
every sample and is carried through all steps of the procedure from nucleic acid
isolation and purification through amplification to monitor for inhibitors present in
the specimen or reaction tube. The IC also serves as a general process control
ensuring that each step of the procedure was performed correctly, assay and
instrument parameters were set correctly, and that general reagents were working.
The following controls are not provided in the ProParaflu+ Assay kit, but are
required or recommended and described in the ProParaflu+ Assay Instructions for
Use:
Negative Control (NC): A Negative Control (NC) is not provided with the kit, but
is required and described in the ProParaflu+ Assay Instructions for Use. Viral
transport media spiked with the IC is to be used as the negative control and
processed starting from nucleic acid isolation. The negative control serves to
monitor for contamination.

Extraction Control (EC): An Extraction Control (EC) is not provided with the kit,
however, during the clinical trial, a well characterized human parainfluenza 3
virus, was spiked with the IC and included with each nucleic acid isolation run as
EC. The EC serves to monitor for lysis and contamination during nucleic acid
isolation. The sponsor is recommending an extraction control in each nucleic
acid extraction run to the end users in the package insert.
