L. Test Principle:
The sample (whole blood) is drawn by capillary action at the tip of the test strip. Glucose in
the sample reacts with glucose oxidase (GOD) and Hexaammineruthenium (III) chloride in
the test strip. This produces Hexaammineruthenium (II) chloride. Hexaammineruthenium (II)
chloride is produced in proportion to the glucose concentration of the blood sample.
Oxidation of the Hexaammineruthenium (II) chloride produces an electric current. The meter
converts the current to the glucose concentration and displays it as the test result:
β-D-glucose + Hexammineruthenium (III) chloride GOD
D-Glucono-δLactone + Hexammineruthenium (II) chloride
Hexammineruthenium (II) chloride → Hexammineruthenium (III) chloride + e-
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-Day precision testing was performed using fresh venous whole blood obtained
from several non-diabetic volunteers and adjusted to a pO2 of 60 to 80 mm Hg and
hematocrit of 42%. The whole blood was spiked to obtain 5 glucose concentrations
ranging from 44.1 – 306 mg/dL. Within-Day precision tests consisted of 10
measurements of each of the five spiked whole blood glucose samples using 10
meters for each sample for a total of 500 measurements. The within-run precision for
all meters and concentrations tested was as follows:
Glucose Conc. Standard Deviation Coefficient of

131.3 4.10 2.84
181.9 5.65 2.87
306.0 8.24 2.51
The Day to Day precision testing was performed using three glucose levels of control
solutions; ten individual users performed this evaluation using ten meters over a
period of 10 days, for a total of 100 measurements per level. This was repeated with
three lots of test strips.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The measuring range of the device is 20-600 mg/dL. A linearity study was conducted
consistent with CLSI EP6-A using venous whole blood collected in a 10 mL vacuum
sample tube. Glucose was adjusted to 11 concentration levels ranging from 13.5 to
699.4 mg/dL (The Lo and Hi detection was disabled for this testing). Ten
GLUCOCARD® Vital™ meter measurements were taken at each glucose
concentration. The linear regression line for three lots was: y = 0.9976x + 0.1441, r2 =
0.997.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The control solutions used in this device have been previously cleared (k063068).
Shelf life studies show that the unopened test strips have a twenty-four month life-
span and a three month shelf-life once a vial of strips is opened. The recommended
storage temperature is 39° F - 86° F (4° C - 30° C).
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit is 20 mg/dL. See linearity/assay reportable range above.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor evaluated the interference from different concentrations of the
substances listed below. Three glucose levels were tested for each interferent
including a low (50 – 80 mg/dL range), medium (120 – 160 mg/dL range), and high
(302 – 382 mg/dL range). A total of 15 readings were taken for each glucose level
and concentration of interferent (5 meters per each of 3 test strip lots).
Studies demonstrated that all the interfering substances listed below did not
significantly interfere with the glucose readings.
Acetaminophen up to 20 mg/dL
Acetyl-Salicylic Acid up to 65 mg/dL
Ascorbic acid up to 6 mg/dL
Bilirubin (unconjugated) up to 33 mg/dL
Bilirubin (conjugated) up to 67 mg/dL

Altitude Study
A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of altitude on the GLUCOCARD®
Vital™ Glucose Meter using the new glucose strips. Venous blood collected from a
donor was allowed to undergo glycolysis at room temperature to lower the
endogenous glucose to approximately 40 mg/dL. The sample was separated into 4
aliquots and spiked with glucose to levels of approximately 60, 125, 300 and 480
mg/dL. These glucose values were confirmed with the YSI glucose analyzer. The
tests were performed at approximately 900 feet and at 10,500 feet. At each altitude,
venous blood at each of the 4 levels of glucose was tested on the same test strip lot
with 10 replicates. The meter readings obtained at 10,500 feet were compared to the
meter readings at sea level and the % bias was determined at each level. Results
recovered within 3.3% when compared to the readings near sea level. The labeling
states that the GLUCOCARD® Vital™-V1 strips can be used at elevations up to
10,000 feet above sea level.
Hematocrit Study
The sponsor performed hematocrit studies comparing the GLUCOCARD® Vital™
result at various hematocrit levels across the glucose measuring range to the normal
Page 6 of 9

--- Page 7 ---
hematocrit level and to a reference analyzer. Hematocrit levels tested were 30, 33, 35,
37, 40, 42, 45, 50, 51, 52, 53, and 55% and glucose levels tested were approximately
40, 120, 250, and 450 mg/dL. Testing was performed on two lots of test strips. Based
on the comparisons to the reference analyzer and to normal hematocrit (42%), the
results for hematocrit levels between 33-52% showed a bias of less than ±15 mg/dL at
glucose concentrations less than 75mg/dL or less than ±15% at glucose
concentrations ≥75 mg/dL.

N. Instrument Name:
GLUCOCARD™ Vital Blood Glucose Meter
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for each additional
reading.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X___ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger and palm
only. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip, there are no
special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
No calibration is required from the user. The meter accommodates auto-coding, in that
each strip is designed and manufactured to code the meter appropriately when the strip is
inserted.
6. Quality Control:
Two levels of control are supplied with the device. Users are instructed to test control
solutions when the meter is first used in order to verify that they can use the meter
correctly. In addition they are instructed to run a control when a new vial of test strips is
opened, when they suspect the meter or strips are not working correctly, if test results
appear to be abnormally high or low, or are not consistent with the patient's symptoms, if
the meter is dropped, to check their technique, if the test strip bottle had been left open or
stored outside its recommended temperature range, and each time the batteries are
changed.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
The sponsor performed a readability assessment of the labeling and states that the lay user
instructions in the user manual, strip insert, and control insert are at 8.0, 7.5, and 7.5 grade
level, respectively.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
