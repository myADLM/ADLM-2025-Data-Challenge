Cepheid GeneXpert® Dx System
I. Device Description:
The GeneXpert Dx System automates and integrates sample purification, nucleic acid
amplification, and detection of the target sequence in simple or complex samples using
real-time PCR and RT-PCR assays. The system consists of an instrument, personal
computer, and preloaded software for running tests and viewing the results. The system
requires the use of single-use disposable cartridges that hold the PCR reagents and host
the PCR process. Because the cartridges are self-contained, cross-contamination between
samples is eliminated. For a full description of the system, see the GeneXpert Dx System
Operator Manual.
The Xpert C. difficile Assay includes reagents for the detection of toxigenic C. difficile, as
well as a Sample Processing Control (SPC). The SPC is present to control for adequate
processing of the target bacteria and to monitor the presence of inhibitors in the PCR

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
N/A
L. Test Principle:
The assay is a rapid, automated in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative detection of C.
difficile directly from unformed (liquid or soft) stool specimens of patients suspected of
having C. difficile infection (CDI). The assay detects the following three elements: toxin B
gene (tcdB), binary toxin gene (CDT), and the single-base-pair deletion at nucleotide 117
within the gene encoding a negative regulator of toxin production (tcdCΔ117). The assay is
performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert Dx System. This is the same instrument system that is
used with the Cepheid Xpert MRSA [510(k) #K070462], Xpert MRSA/SA SSTI [510(k)
#K080837], and Xpert MRSA Blood Culture [510(k) #K082140] as well as the Cepheid
Xpert GBS and Xpert EV Assays.
The assay uses real-time PCR amplification and fluorogenic target-specific hybridization
detection. An important aspect of this submission is that the assay intends to detect toxigenic
C. difficile and presumptive identification of an epidemic strain of C. difficile known as
027/NAP1/BI strain (Note: this strain designation terminology refers to designations given to
this strain based on PCR ribotyping, Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) and restriction
endonuclease analysis (REA), respectively).
This strain has been described as having a single-base-pair deletion at nucleotide 117 within
the gene encoding a negative regulator of toxin production (tcdCΔ117). Cepheid selected
primers and probes to identify the single-base- pair deletion at position 117 of the tcdC gene
to detect and differentiate the 027/NAP1/BI hypervirulent C. difficile strains from other
isolates.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Performance characteristics of the Xpert C. difficile Assay were determined in a multi-site
prospective investigation study at seven US and Canadian institutions by comparing the
Xpert C. difficile Assay to reference culture followed by cell cytotoxicity testing on the
isolates
Subjects included individuals whose routine care called for C. difficile testing. A portion of
the leftover unformed stool specimens were obtained for testing by the Xpert C. difficile
Assay. The remaining excess specimen was sent to a central laboratory for reference culture
and cytotoxin B isolate testing. Each stool specimen was inoculated onto pre-reduced
cycloserine-cefoxitin-fructose agar –direct plate (CCFA-D) and cycloserine cefoxitin
mannitol broth with taurocholate lysozyme cysteine (CCMB-TAL). After 24 hours the

CCMBTAL was subcultured on to a second CCFA-E plate (CCFA- Enriched). This direct-
enriched culture method is referred to hereafter as “reference culture”. If C. difficile was
isolated from the CCFA-D plate and the isolate was positive by cell cyotoxicity assay, the
specimen was classified as “toxigenic C. difficile positive” and CCFA-E plate was not further
analyzed. If no C. difficile was isolated from the CCFA-D plate or if the isolate was negative
by cell cytotoxicity assay, the CCFA-E plate was further analyzed. If CCFA-E was positive
for C. difficile and the isolate was positive for cell cytotoxicity assay, the specimen was
classified as “toxigenic C. difficile positive”. The specimen was reported as “negative” if
CCFA-E is negative for C. difficile or the isolate was tested negative by cell cytotoxicity
assay.
Performance of the Xpert C. difficile Assay was calculated relative to the results of direct
culture and reference culture.
Overall Results
A total of 2296 specimens were tested by Xpert C. difficile Assay and culture.
Performance vs. Direct Culture
Relative to direct culture with, the Xpert C. difficile Assay demonstrated a sensitivity and
specificity for toxigenic C. difficile of 98.79% and 90.82%, respectively.

Antibiotic Usage
Among the 2296 cases included in the main dataset, antibiotic use within the 2 months prior to
sample collection was reported for 1633 and no antibiotic use was confirmed for 570; for 93
cases, antibiotic status was unknown. Antibiotic use did not cause a statistically significant
difference in assay performance
Analytical Specificity
Fifty-five (55) strains were collected, quantitated and tested using the Xpert C. difficile Assay.
The strains originated from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Culture Collection
University of Göteborg (CCUG), German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures
(DSMZ), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Institute of Public Health,
Maribor, Slovenia and Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control (SMI).
Of the tested species, ten (10) non-toxigenic C. difficile strains and eleven (11) non C. difficile
Clostridium species were included. The organisms tested were identified as either Gram-positive
(37) or Gram negative (18). The organisms were further classified as aerobic (24), anaerobic (29)
or microaerophilic (2).
8 10
Each strain was tested in triplicate at concentrations ranging from 1.1×10 to 2.2×10
CFU/swab. Positive and negative controls were included in the study. Under the conditions of
the study, all isolates were reported “Toxigenic C. diff NEGATIVE”. The analytical specificity
was 100%.
Analytical Sensitivity
Studies were consisted of human liquid feces (C. difficile negative by Xpert C. difficile Assay)
diluted in PBS with 15% glycerol. The LoD is defined as the lowest number of colony forming
units (CFU) per swab that can be reproducibly

Studies were performed to determine the 95% confidence intervals for the analytical limit of
detection (LoD) of C. difficile diluted into a fecal matrix of human origin that can be detected by
the Xpert C. difficile Assay. The fecal matrix consisted of human liquid feces (C. difficile
negative by Xpert C. difficile Assay) diluted in PBS with 15% glycerol. The LoD is defined as
the lowest number of colony forming units (CFU) per swab that can be reproducibly
distinguished from negative samples with 95% confidence.
Replicates of 20 were evaluated at each C. difficile concentration tested (CFU/swab) for 7
different C. difficile strains representing toxinotypes 0 (two strains), III (two strains), IV, V and
VIII (one of each strain).

--- Page 8 ---
The estimate and confidence intervals were determined using logistic regression with data
(number of positive results per number of replicates at each level) over the range of CFUs tested.
The confidence intervals were determined using maximum likelihood estimates on the logistic
model parameters using the large sample variance-covariance matrix. The LoD point estimates
and 95% upper and lower confidence intervals for each C. difficile toxinotype tested are
summarized in Table 4.

The results of this study indicate that the Xpert C. difficile Assay will produce a positive C.
difficile result 95% of the time with 95% confidence for a fecal sample containing 460 CFU.
In addition to the LoD determination, eighteen C. difficile strains representing 12 variant
toxinotypes, including four 027/NAP1/BI toxinotype III isolates, were tested using the Xpert C.
difficile Assay. C. difficile strains were selected to broadly represent the majority of C. difficile
toxinotypes encountered in practice. Stock cultures were prepared by suspending the bacterial
growth from agar plates in PBS buffer containing 15% glycerol. The concentration of each stock
was adjusted to 1.4-5.9 McFarland units. All strains were serially diluted to approximately 900
CFU/swab and tested in triplicate.
Under the conditions of this study, the Xpert C. difficile Assay correctly identified all 18
toxinotypes tested as “Toxigenic C. diff POSITIVE”. Included in the panel were 8 toxinotypes
reported to be positive for binary toxin (CDT) production as well. All were CDT positive using
the Xpert C. difficile Assay. All four 027/NAP1/BI isolates representing toxinotype III were
correctly identified as “Toxigenic C. diff POSITIVE”.
Interfering Substances
Twenty-one (21) biological and chemical substances occasionally used or found in stool
specimens were tested for interference with the Xpert C. difficile Assay. Potentially interfering
substances include, but are not limited to, Vagisil cream and zinc oxide paste. The 19 substances
listed in Table 5 showed no detectable interference with the Xpert C. difficile Assay
