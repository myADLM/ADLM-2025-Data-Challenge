L. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”; CLSI M7 (M100-S19) “Methods for
Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;
Approved Standard”.
M. Test Principle:
Optics systems use visible light to directly measure organism growth. These
transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before significant
growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same well measure
organism growth by how much light is prevented from going through the well. An
interpretive call is made between 4 and 16 hours for a “rapid” read but may be extended
to 18 hours in some instances. The VITEK®2 Susceptibility Card test is based on the
microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration technique with concentrations
equivalent to standard method concentrations. Several parameters based on the growth
characteristics observed are used to provide appropriate input for the MIC calculations.
Discriminate analysis is used to develop the algorithm that determines the susceptibility
result for all antimicrobials on the VITEK®2 system. The MIC result must be linked to
organism identification in order to determine a category interpretation. A category
interpretation (SIR) will be reported along with a MIC.
N. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Ten gram-positive on-scale organisms were evaluated for site to
site and inter site reproducibility demonstrating >95%

reproducibility. The ten isolates study described in the guidance
document was used (10 organisms tested 3 times on 3 days at 3
sites).
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
The recommended QC isolates were tested on every test occasion
with the reference method and the VITEK®2. The reference
method QC results were in range for every day tested. The
VITEK®2 was tested a sufficient number of times to demonstrate
that the system can produce QC results in the recommended range.
Quality Control was performed during the studies using both the
auto-dilution and the manual method of diluting the organisms.
Results demonstrated that methods were comparable with the same
mode.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A clinical study was conducted at three sites using the VITEK®2
gram positive cards with daptomycin and the broth microdilution
method using Mueller Hinton (MH) broth (cation adjusted)
supplemented with 50 μg/mL calcium. The MH broth was
incubated at 35°C in ambient air at 16 – 20h. The Inoculum was
prepared with direct colony suspension. The testing included both
fresh clinical isolates and stock isolates along with a challenge set
with known results. Two methods of inoculation (manual and
automated) were evaluated. Clinical testing was performed using
the automated method of inoculation and the challenge set was
tested using both the manual and the automated method. The test
device had a growth rate of >90%. A comparison was provided to
the reference method with the following agreement.

EA-Essential Agreement CA-Category Agreement
NS-not susceptible
Essential agreement (EA) is when the VITEK®2 panels agree with the reference test
panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference method. Category
agreement (CA) is when the VITEK®2 panel result interpretation agrees exactly with the
reference panel result interpretation. Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for
both the VITEK®2 and the reference and have on-scale EA.
There appears to be a trend where the test device is slightly more resistant than the
reference method as demonstrated in the Accuracy studies however results are still within
essential agreement.
Manual Dilution:
The challenge set of organisms was also tested at one site using the manual method of
inoculation with the following performance that demonstrated that there is minimal
difference between the two inoculation methods.

5. Expected values:
Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains) ≤1
Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible strains only) ≤4
The current absence of data for resistant strains precludes defining any results
other than “Susceptible”. Strains yielding MIC results suggestive of a “non-
susceptible” category should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further
testing.
