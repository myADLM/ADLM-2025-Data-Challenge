Guideline – Second Edition (CLSI C28-A2)
L. Test Principle:
The SYNCHRON Systems CO2E assay is an enzymatic method utilizing
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) and a stabilized NADH analog in two coupled
enzymatic reactions. In the first reaction, PEPC catalyzes the reaction between the
phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and HCO - to yield oxaloacetate and inorganic phosphate. In the
3
second step, oxaloacetate is reduced by a stable NADH analog to malate in the presence of
malate dehydrogenase (MDH). The resulting decrease in absorbance at 410 nm is
spectrophotometrically measured and is directly proportional to the CO2 concentration in the
test sample via measurement of bicarbonate ions (HCO -).

The chemical reaction scheme follows:
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed precision studies in accordance with the CLSI EP5-A2
guideline. One serum pool and three serum controls were used to evaluate the within-
run and total imprecision. Samples were analyzed in duplicate, twice a day, for 20
days. Results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor performed linearity studies in accordance with the CLSI EP6-A
guideline. The study protocol utilized inter-dilutions of a patient serum specimen with
a zero-level (saline) sample. A high CO2 level was prepared by spiking with
bicarbonate solution. Seven different levels of CO2 concentrations (ranging 5 to 47
mmol/L) were tested in triplicate on the DxC 800 analyzer. The recovered CO2
values were plotted against the expected values and an appropriate line fitted by
standard linear regression resulting in: y = 0.9979x + 1.121; R2 = 0.9967.
The claimed measuring range of this device is 5.0 to 45.0 mmol/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The enzymatic CO2 assay is traceable to NIST SRM 351.
AQUA CAL 1 and 3 calibrators were previously cleared under k965240.
The sponsor states that the unopened CO2E reagent is stable until the expiration date
when stored at 2 to 8°C, and for 14 days at 2 to 8°C once opened. The calibrators are
stable unopened until the expiration date when stored at 2 to 8°C, and for 30 days at
room temperature after opening unless the expiration date is exceeded.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor determined the limit of detection (LoD) according to the CLSI EP-17-A
guideline. LoD is defined as the actual concentration at which an observed test result
is very likely to exceed the limit of blank (LoB) and may therefore be declared as
“detected”.
The limit of the blank (LoB) was determined by analyzing a blank sample (deionized
water) 20 times on a DxC 800 analyzer. To determine the LoD an aqueous CO2
standard at 5 mmol/L was used as the 100% sample, while 80% and 60% samples
were prepared by diluting the standard with deionized water. These 3 low
concentration standards were analyzed 20 times each. The results demonstrated that
the LoD is 5.0 mmol/L.
The claimed measuring range of this assay is 5.0 to 45.0 mmol/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed interference studies according to the EP7-A2 guideline.
Patient sample pools representing low (~20 mmol/L), mid (22 to 28 mmol/L) and
high (35 mmol/L) analytes levels were used. Five levels of each interferent were
5

--- Page 6 ---
tested in replicates of four on a DxC 800 analyzer. The level of interference was
considered not significant if there was no more than 2 mmol/L or 6% difference
between the interferent result and the reference result.
No significant interferences were found for bilirubin (unconjugated) up to 40 mg/dL,
hemoglobin up to 500 mg/dL, acetoacetic acid up to 250 mg/dL, lipemia up to 500
mg/dL of Intralipid or up to a serum index of 6.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparisons to the predicate device were performed in accordance with the
CLSI EP9-A2 guideline using the DxC 800 analyzer. A total of 99 serum samples
were used, some samples were spiked and diluted to fully span the claimed measuring
range. The range of the samples tested was 5 to 44 mmol/L. The CO2E recovery
results (Y) were compared to the corresponding CO2 ISE recovery results (X) and
Deming regression analysis was performed resulting in: y = 0.978x + 0.35; r = 0.996.
b. Matrix comparison:
The sponsor performed matrix comparisons using 59 apparently health subjects.
Serum samples and plasma samples (lithium heparin, sodium heparin, and potassium
oxalate/sodium fluoride) were drawn from the same donor. CO2 samples ranging
from 25 to 32 mmol/L were analyzed on the DxC 800. The plasma results (Y) were
compared to the corresponding serum results (X) for the same donor and Deming
regression analysis was performed. The sponsor claimed that lithium heparin, sodium
heparin, and potassium oxalate/sodium fluoride are acceptable anticoagulants to be
used. Results are summarized below.
