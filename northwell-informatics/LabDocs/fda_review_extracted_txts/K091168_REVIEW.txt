L. Test Principle:
The principle of the test relies on glucose in the blood sample to react with the electrodes in
the test strip. The test strip employs an electrochemical signal generating an electrical current
that will stimulate a chemical reaction. This reaction is measured by a glucose meter
integrated in the battery pack of the cell phone and the results of the blood glucose are
displayed on the cell phone.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within run precision was performed using venous blood samples spiked with glucose
to achieve higher glucose concentrations or allowed to age and undergo glycolysis to
achieve lower blood concentrations. The samples tested ranged from 40 to 315
mg/dL. Ten GlucoPhone glucose meters were each used to test each sample 10 times
(n=100 total). The mean values and coefficients of variation were calculated for each
sample and are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The claimed reportable range for the Glucophone is from 20 mg/dL to 600 mg/dL.
Linearity was evaluated by adjusting a blood sample to a high and a low
concentration. The two concentrations were mixed to form 14 glucose concentrations
between 10.8 to 599.2 mg/dL. These samples were then tested with the GlucoPhone
and YSI analyzer. Each glucose level was measured 5 times by the GlucoPhone and
in duplicate by YSI. Linear regression analysis was performed and calculated the
following result: y=0.9965x + 0.2585, R2=1.00.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The glucose controls were previously cleared in 510(k) submission k051285. Shelf-life
studies show that the unopened controls have a 26 month shelf life and are stable for 3
months after opening.
Stability testing demonstrated that the test strips were stable until the expiration date
when stored as directed and for 3 months after the test strip vial was opened.
d. Detection limit:
The lower end of the measuring range is 20 mg/dL and was verified in the linearity
study above.
e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was conducted to determine the effect of common interfering
substances based on the CLSI EP07-A guideline. Common interferences were evaluated
by spiking venous blood with different glucose concentrations. Each of these
concentrations was then spiked with the interfering compound at concentrations ranging
from zero to the maximum concentration recommended in CLSI EP07-A to make the
interference samples. Three levels of glucose concentrations (<60, 150, and 240 mg/dL)
were tested. The % bias was calculated based on the differences between the spiked
sample and the control sample. The results were all within ± 10 mg/dL of the reference
sample for glucose values < 75 mg/dL and within ± 10% for glucose values > 75 mg/dL.

The product labeling states the following: Acetaminophen, uric acid, ascorbic acid
(vitamin C), and other reducing substances (when occurring in normal blood or
normal therapeutic concentration) do not significantly affect results. However,
abnormally high concentration in blood may cause inaccurately high results.
Lipidemic samples; cholesterol up to 500mg/dL or triglyceride up to 3000 mg/dL do
not significantly affect the results.

System accuracy was evaluated by comparing the fingertip results of 160 samples that
spanned the claimed assay range to the results obtained on a Hitachi747. Samples ranged
from 31 to 589 mg/dL. For levels less than 50 mg/dL and greater than 400 mg/dL,
pooled anti-coagulated capillary whole blood specimens were allowed to glycolize or
were spiked to the desired glucose levels. Regression analysis calculated a slope of 1.011,
a y-intercept of 0.5426, and R2was 0.988. The accuracy of the GlucoPhone vs. a

The sponsor conducted a user study at three clinical sites (minimum of 50 users per site)
where the lay-user and healthcare professional measured blood glucose levels from both
fingerstick and alternative sites. English speaking participants, were instructed to read
the manual and perform testing on their finger and then the alternative sites. The results
were compared to results from a laboratory reference analyzer. At each clinical site, the
lay-user tested themselves first by fingerstick then by using alternative sites with the
GlucoPhone and recorded their results. A healthcare professional then measured blood
samples from fingerstick and alternative sites with the GlucoPhone, and a venous sample
with the reference method. The lay user then completed a questionnaire to cover

GlucoPhone™ meter when the strip is inserted.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor has three levels of control solutions available for this meter with all levels
coming with the kit and also being available through the distributor. When a test strip is
inserted into the meter, a control can be run. An acceptable range for each control level is
printed on the test strip vial label. The user is instructed when to perform quality control
testing and referred to a troubleshooting section at the end of the control test instructions
of the owner’s manual to identify possible reasons control results fall outside these
ranges. The user is instructed to contact customer support if the QC fails a second time.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
EMC testing was performed according to IEC/EN 60601-1
The sponsor evaluated the effects of hematocrit on whole blood samples adjusted to 5 hematocrit
levels between 30% and55% at eight glucose concentrations between 30 mg/dL and 549 mg/dL.
The results from each sample were compared to mean values from the same sample tested on the
YSI analyzer. All of the samples tested had results within +/- 10 mg/dL of YSI results for values
under 75 mg/dL. For samples over 75 mg/dL, 97% of the results were within +/- 10% of YSI
results and 100% of the results were within +/-15% of YSI results. These results support the
sponsor’s claimed hematocrit range of 30% to 55%.
Altitude testing
Glucose values of venous blood with adjusted partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) were
measured by GlucoPhone in an altitude chamber at sea level and 10,000 feet. These values
were compared to YSI 2300 reference values. Samples with glucose levels of 68 mg/dL,
299 mg/dL, and 468 mg/dL showed differences of less than 3 mg/dL or 2% compared to YSI
at sea level and at 10,000 feet. The sponsor stated in their labeling that the Glucophone can
be used up to altitudes of 10,000 feet without affecting the results.

Temperature and humidity studies were performed using three glucose controls at low,
middle, and high concentrations. To evaluate the effect of temperature on performance, five
GlucoPhone meters and test strips were placed into a temperature programmable incubator
and tested at 10°C, 23°C, and 40°C with constant humidity and allowed to equilibrate to the
incubator temperature. The control results at 10°C and 40°C were compared to those at 23°C
and all results were within ±5.7%, demonstrating that temperatures ranging from 10°C to
40°C did not affect the meter’s performance. To evaluate the effect of humidity on
performance, five glucose meters and test strips were tested at 10%, 37%, and 90% humidity
with constant temperature and allowed to equilibrate to the incubator temperature and
humidity. The control results at 10% and 90% humidity were compared to those at 37%
humidity and all results were within ±3.2%, demonstrating that humidity ranging from 10%
to 90% did not affect the meter’s performance.
The sponsor assessed ease of understanding of the labeling by the lay users. Participants varied in
age, education, country of origin and gender. The overall survey indicated that 100% of the users
rated the ease of use of the instructions as either Very Good (89%) or Good (11%). The
readability for the user manual, strip manual and control solution labeling are grades 6.7, 6.4 and
5.7, respectively.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
