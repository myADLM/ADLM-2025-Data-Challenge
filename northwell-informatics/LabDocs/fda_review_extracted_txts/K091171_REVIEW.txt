H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc. device, D3 FastPoint L-DFA Respiratory Virus
Identification Kit is intended for the qualitative identification of influenza A virus,
influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus
and to screen for the presence of parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3 in nasal and
nasopharyngeal swabs and aspirates/washes specimens from patients with signs and
symptoms of respiratory infection by direct detection of immunofluorescence using
monoclonal antibodies (MAbs).
It is recommended that specimens found to be negative for influenza A virus,
influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus or parainfluenza viruses after
examination of the direct specimen result be confirmed by cell culture. Specimens
found to be negative for human metapneumovirus after examination of the direct
specimen results should be confirmed by an FDA cleared human metapneumovirus
molecular assay. Negative results do not preclude respiratory virus infection and
should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other management
decisions.
Performance characteristics for influenza A virus detection and identification were
established when influenza A (H3N2) and influenza A (H1N1) were the predominant
influenza A strains circulating in the United States. Since influenza strains display
antigenic drift and shift from year to year, performance characteristics may vary. If
infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected, based on clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria communicated by public health authorities, collect
specimens following appropriate infection control precautions and submit to state or
local health departments, for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these
cases unless a BSL 3+ facility1 is available to receive and culture specimens.2

I. Device Description:
The D3 FastPoint L-DFA Respiratory Virus Identification Kit uses three blends (each
called a “L-DFA Reagent”) of viral antigen-specific murine monoclonal antibodies
that are directly labeled with either R-PE (influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial
virus, and parainfluenza virus) or fluorescein (influenza B virus, human
metapneumovirus, and adenovirus) for the rapid identification of respiratory viruses in
nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs and aspirates/washes from patients with signs and
symptoms of respiratory infection.
Kit Components:
1. Influenza A/Influenza B D3 FastPoint L-DFA Reagent, 4.0-mL. One dropper bottle
containing a mixture of PE-labeled murine monoclonal antibodies directed against
influenza A virus antigens and FITC-labeled murine monoclonal antibodies directed
against influenza B virus antigens. The buffered, stabilized, aqueous solution contains
Evans Blue and propidium iodide as counter-stains and 0.1% sodium azide as
preservative.
2. RSV/hMPV D3 FastPoint L-DFA Reagent, 4.0-mL. One dropper bottle containing a
mixture of PE-labeled murine monoclonal antibodies directed against respiratory
syncytial virus antigens and FITC-labeled murine monoclonal antibodies directed
against human metapneumovirus antigens. The buffered, stabilized, aqueous solution
contains Evans Blue and propidium iodide as counter-stains and 0.1% sodium azide as
preservative.
3. HPIV/Adenovirus D3 FastPoint L-DFA Reagent, 4.0-mL. One dropper bottle
containing a mixture of PE-labeled murine monoclonal antibodies directed against
parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, or 3 antigens and FITC-labeled murine monoclonal
antibodies directed against adenovirus antigens. The buffered, stabilized, aqueous
solution contains Evans Blue and propidium iodide as counter-stains and 0.1% sodium
azide as preservative.
4. 40X PBS Concentrate, 25-mL. One bottle of 40X PBS concentrate containing 4%
sodium azide (0.1% sodium azide after dilution to 1X using de-mineralized water).
5. Re-suspension Buffer, 6.0-mL. One bottle of a buffered glycerol solution and 0.1%
sodium azide.
6. D3 FastPoint L-DFA Respiratory Virus Antigen Control Slides, 5-slides. Five
individually packaged control slides containing 6 wells with cell culture derived
3

--- Page 4 ---
positive and negative control cells. Each positive well is identified as to the virus
infected cells present, i.e., influenza A virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial
virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, and adenovirus. The negative
wells contain non-infected cells. Each slide is intended to be stained only one time.
An overview of the procedure is as follows:
The cells to be tested are derived from respiratory specimens from patients with signs
and symptoms of respiratory infection. The cells are permeablized and stained
concurrently in a liquid suspension format in 3 separate vials, each containing one of
the 3 “DFA Reagents”. After incubating at 35ºC to 37ºC for 5 minutes, the stained cell
suspensions are rinsed with PBS. The rinsed cells are pelleted by centrifugation and
then re-suspended with the re-suspension buffer and loaded onto a specimen slide
well. The cells are examined using a fluorescence microscope. Cells infected with
influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus, or parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3
will exhibit golden yellow fluorescence due to the PE. Cells infected with influenza B
virus, human metapneumovirus or adenovirus will exhibit apple-green fluorescence
due to the FITC. Non-infected cells will exhibit red fluorescence due to the Evans
Blue counter-stain. Nuclei of intact cells will exhibit orange-red fluorescence due to
the propidium iodide.

L. Test Principle:
The D3 FastPoint L-DFA Respiratory Virus Identification Kit uses three blends (each
called a “L-DFA Reagent”) of viral antigen-specific murine monoclonal antibodies that
are directly labeled with either R-PE (influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and
parainfluenza virus) or fluorescein (influenza B virus, human metapneumovirus, and
adenovirus) for the rapid identification of respiratory viruses in nasal and nasopharyngeal
swabs and aspirates/washes from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory
infection.
The cells to be tested are derived from respiratory specimens from patients with signs and
symptoms of respiratory infection. The cells are permeablized and stained concurrently in
a liquid suspension format in 3 separate vials, each containing one of the 3 “DFA
Reagents.” After incubating at 35ºC to 37ºC for 5 minutes, the stained cell suspensions
are rinsed with PBS. The rinsed cells are pelleted by centrifugation and then re-suspended
with the re-suspension buffer and loaded onto a specimen slide well. The cells are
examined using a fluorescence microscope. Cells infected with influenza A virus,
respiratory syncytial virus, or parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3 will exhibit golden
yellow fluorescence due to the PE. Cells infected with influenza B virus, human
metapneumovirus or adenovirus will exhibit apple-green fluorescence due to the FITC.
Non-infected cells will exhibit red fluorescence due to the Evans Blue counter-stain.
Nuclei of intact cells will exhibit orange-red fluorescence due to the propidium iodide.

It is recommended that results for specimens found to contain no fluorescent cells after
examination of the direct specimen result be confirmed by cell culture. In the case of
hMPV, it is recommended that specimens found to contain no fluorescent cells after
examination of the direct specimen be confirmed by an FDA cleared hMPV molecular
assay.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Assay precision, intra-assay variability and inter assay variability were assessed
with 3 panels of proficiency-level antigen control slides. Each of the 3
reproducibility panels consisted of 5 randomized panel members.
The Influenza A/B panel consisted of the following:
a. Low level influenza A (Victoria strain) infected cells.
b. Low level influenza B (Taiwan strain) infected cells.
c. Low level influenza A (Victoria strain) infected cells mixed with
mid level influenza B (Taiwan strain) infected cells.
d. Low level influenza B (Victoria strain) infected cells mixed with
mid level influenza A (Victoria strain) infected cells.
e. Mid level non-infected (negative) cells.
The RSV/hMPV panel consisted of the following:
a. Low level RSV (Washington strain) infected cells.
b. Low level hMPV (A1 subtype) infected cells.
c. Low level RSV (Washington strain) infected cells mixed with mid
level hMPV (A1 subtype) infected cells.
d. Low level hMPV (A1 subtype) infected cells mixed with mid level
RSV (Washington strain) infected cells.
e. Mid level non-infected (negative) cells.
The HPIV/Adenovirus panel consisted of the following:
a. Low level Para 1 (C-35 strain) infected cells.
b. Low level Adenovirus (ATCC type 1) infected cells.
c. Low level Para 1 (C-35 strain) infected cells mixed with mid level
Adenovirus (ATCC type 1) infected cells.
d. Low Adenovirus (ATCC type 1) infected cells mixed with mid
level Para 1 (C-35 strain) infected cells.
e. Mid level non-infected (negative) cells.
The low level is estimated to contain between 4 to 10% infected cells in the
sample. The mid level is estimated to contain between 20 to 25% infected cells in
the sample. Each sample contains 2.5 x105 to 3.5 x105total cells.

Each panel was tested daily in two separate runs for 5-days by four different
laboratories (40 total runs). The following results were recorded:
a. Presence or absence of golden-yellow fluorescence.
b. Percent of cells exhibiting golden-yellow fluorescence.
c. Presence or absence of apple-green fluorescence.
d. Percent of cells exhibiting apple-green fluorescence.
Note: “Processing of specimen”, although a source of variability, was done
according to each laboratory’s established practices. The product insert for this
device instructs the laboratory to process a specimen according to Clinical
Microbiology Handbook (H.D. Isenberg, 2004, publ. by ASM; sections 10.7.1-
10.7.10). As such, testing reproducibility of “processing of specimen” is beyond
the scope of this reproducibility study. This study accessed reproducibility of the
test alone, i.e., “chemistry of assay” (DFA staining) and “interpretation of result”.
“Interpretation of result” is considered to be the largest source for variability for
this test. Interpretation of test is subjective, according to potential variability in an
individual technician’s competence, experience, and/or diligence in microscopic
evaluations of stained cells.
A total of 840 data points were included in the reproducibility study data analysis
(3 panels X 7 analytes/run X 2 runs/day X 5 days X 4 sites = 840).
For the Influenza A/Influenza B D3 FastPoint L-DFA Reagent, the combined data
from the four Study Sites demonstrated reproducible detection of influenza A
virus by the R-PE labeled MAbs and reproducible detection of influenza B virus
by the FITC-labeled MAbs. The presence of influenza A virus infected cells was
reported in 100% (120/120) of the wells in which the infected cells were expected.
The presence of influenza B virus infected cells was reported in 100% (120/120)
of the wells in which the infected cells were expected. The absence of infected
cells was reported in 95% (38/40) of the wells in which infected cells were not
present. The total percent agreement for the Influenza A/Influenza B D3 FastPoint
L-DFA Reagent was 99.3% (278/280):

Performance Evaluation of PE-labeled MAbs
Reactivity of PE-labeled MAbs with Acetone-Fixed Infected Model Cells
(Model Cells are A549 cell cultures infected with known isolates of influenza A
virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus,
parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3, or adenovirus at a high (0.1) MOI. These
cultures are incubated for 20 to 22 hours at 35°C to 37°C, then processed by
scraping the monolayers and resuspending the cells in a viral transport medium.)
An antibody may exhibit high affinity for its target antigen until labeled with a
reporter moiety such as PE due to blocking or modification of the antigen-binding
site. Each of the two influenza A virus MAbs, the two respiratory syncytial virus
MAbs, and the six parainfluenza virus (2 for each parainfluenza virus types 1, 2
and 3) MAbs were labeled with PE. The individual PE-labeled MAbs were used to
stain acetone-fixed influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and
parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3 model cells (respectively) in order to verify
that each of the MAbs remains reactive with its target after labeling with PE. The
same model cells were stained concurrently with FITC-labeled MAbs for
comparison. This comparison of the reactivity is summarized in the following

Reactivity of FITC-labeled MAbs with Permeablized Infected Model Cells

Studies were conducted to demonstrate that the FITC-labeled MAbs would stain
infected cells in solution that have been permeablized. The individual FITC-
labeled MAbs were used to stain influenza B virus, human metapneumovirus,
adenovirus model cells (respectively) that had been permeablized in order to
verify that each of the FITC-labeled MAbs remains reactive with its target. All
FITC-labeled MAbs reacted with the appropriate permeablized model cells as
expected, and similar to acetone-fixed cells.
Concentration of FITC-labeled MAbs
Final blended solutions of the 2 influenza B virus MAbs, the 3 human
metapneumovirus MAbs and the 3 adenovirus MAbs were formulated to yield
optimal fluorescence intensity and lowest background on their respectively
infected cells, permeablized and stained in suspension.
Cell Permeablization and Counterstaining
Selection of Permeablization Reagent
The D3 FastPoint L-DFA Respiratory Virus Identification Kit uses Sapogenin to
permeablize the cell membrane instead of acetone to allow the MAbs to react with
their respective antigens. Permeablization involves treatment of cells with a mild
surfactant. This treatment will dissolve portions of the cell membranes and allow
larger dye molecules and antibodies access to the cell's interior. This allows the
cells to maintain their three dimensional structure while being stained with labeled
antibodies and counter-stain. By doing this, cells can remain in liquid suspension.
Studies were conducted to compare performance using acetone (with that using
another permeablizing reagent, Sapogenin. Sapogenins are the aglycones, or non-
saccharide portions of the family of natural products known as saponins. The
amphipathic nature of saponins gives them activity as surfactants that can be used
to enhance penetration of macromolecules such as proteins through cell
membranes. Using influenza A virus, influenza B virus and respiratory syncytial
virus model cells, acetone and Sapogenin were tested at various concentrations.
Acetone was tested at concentrations from 20% to 100%. Sapogenin was used at
0.1% based on what has been published in the literature. Data generated from the
study indicated that at all acetone concentrations Sapogenin had greater numbers
of infected cells in the liquid format. Based on these studies, Sapogenin was
chosen as the Permeablization reagent in the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Reagents.
13

--- Page 14 ---
Determination of Sapogenin Concentration
Experiments were conducted to optimize the concentration of Sapogenin in the D3
FastPoint L-DFA Respiratory Virus Identification Kit. Non-infected model cells
were treated with different concentrations of Sapogenin and counter-stain for 5-
minutes. The cells were then counted, and the values compared. Data generated
from the study indicated that there was no difference in numbers of cells when
Sapogenin concentrations at 0.1% to 0.025% were used. When 0.2% Sapogenin
was used, reduced numbers of cells were noted, which was an indication that
Sapogenin at that concentration may cause cell disruption. The 0.1% level was
chosen to be used in the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Reagents to better ensure adequate
Permeablization of clinical nasal pharyngeal cells.
Propidium Iodide Counter-stain
To assist the end user in the use of the D3Ultra Duet Kits, improvement to the
counter-staining of cells was developed. Propidium Iodide was added to the three
D3 FastPoint L-DFA Reagents. The stained cell’s nuclei fluoresce red. This
improves the ability to assess specimen quality compared to standard acetone
fixation, Evans Blue stained DSFA specimens. Subjective studies were conducted
to determine the optimal concentration of Propidium Iodide. Higher
concentrations of Propidium Iodide (16-μg/mL or higher) began interfering with
the ability to see low level fluorescence generated by either the PE- or FITC-
stained cells. Lower levels of Propidium Iodide (4-μg/mL or lower) made it
difficult to see the stained nuclei. 8-μg/mL was the optimal concentration to allow
easy identification of cells with no quenching of PE or FITC fluorescence. A low
level of Evans Blue (25-μg/mL compared to 250-μg/mL in each of the predicate
respiratory devices) is also included to help reduce background of non-specific
antibody staining sometimes seen in clinical specimens.
Reagent Interference Studies of MAbs
Studies were conducted to demonstrate that the final blend of PE- and FITC-
labeled MAbs in each D3 FastPoint L-DFA Reagent did not affect the ability to
detect low level positive infected cells that are stained by one fluor when they are
in the same sample, with a high level of positive infected cells which are stained
by the other fluor in the same well. The following cell preparations were
permeablized and stained with the appropriate reagent.
1. For the Influenza A/ Influenza B Reagent:
a. Low level (~25 or lower infected cells) infected influenza A virus model cells
were spiked into non-infected cells.
b. Low level influenza A virus model cells were spiked into high level (4 +)
influenza B virus model cells.
c. Low level (~25 or lower infected cells) infected influenza B virus model cells
were spiked into non-infected cells.

model cells were spiked into non-infected cells.
b. Low level respiratory syncytial virus model cells were spiked into high level

c. Low level (~25 or lower infected cells) metapneumovirus model cells were

3. For the PIV/Adenovirus Reagent:
a. Low level (~25 or lower infected cells) parainfluenza virus type model cells
were spiked into non-infected cells.
b. Low level parainfluenza viruses model cells were spiked into high level (4 +)
adenovirus model cells.
c. Low level (~25 or lower infected cells) adenovirus model cells were spiked

The Influenza A/Influenza B L-DFA Reagent contains 2 influenza A virus MAbs
and 2 influenza B virus MAbs. The RSV/hMPV L-DFA Reagent contains 2
respiratory syncytial virus MAbs and three metapneumovirus MAbs. The
PIV/Adenovirus L-DFA Reagent contains 2 parainfluenza virus type 1 MAbs, 2
parainfluenza virus type 2 MAbs, 2 parainfluenza virus type 3 MAbs and 3
adenovirus MAbs. The purpose of combining either two or three MAbs specific
per virus is to ensure that all strains will be detected. Studies were conducted to
determine if the individual MAbs compete with one another for the same binding
sites since originally, the clones were selected for their individual and highest
level of staining intensity of the respective virus antigens.
Model cells of influenza A virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus,
adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3
were permeablized. Cells were stained with each unlabeled clone of the
appropriate virus. The cells were then stained with the PE- or FITC-labeled MAbs
for each pair (a combination of 3 for hMPV and adenovirus). Labeled MAbs were
used individually, each at their standard concentrations used in the assay.
Results of the initial study indicated that there was no evidence of self or cross
epitope blocking for all the pairs (a combination of 3 for hMPV and adenovirus)
of MAbs, except for the two influenza A and the two parainfluenza type 3 MAbs.
The two influenza A and two parainfluenza type 3 MAbs were labeled with FITC
and tested using the same protocol. The MAbs again blocked each other. This
suggested that the blocking is unrelated to the labeling chemistry. The testing was
repeated using acetone fixation of the model cells in place of the permeablization.
The MAbs again blocked each other. This suggested that the blocking is unrelated
to the fixation chemistry.
It is unknown if this blocking of the parainfluenza virus type 3 MAbs is related to
the model cell system being used for the studies, or if blocking also occurs on
clinical nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. For the influenza A virus MAbs, blocking
of the epitopes is strain dependant. Even though these clones appear to bind to the
same epitope for parainfluenza virus type 3 and for influenza A virus using the
H3N2 virus strain, they are still used because of an “additive” effect on the
brightness of fluorescent cells, i.e. doubling the concentration of one clone and
using it alone is not as bright as using the two clones with the same final
concentration.
Stability Studies
16

--- Page 17 ---
Shelf life for the complete kit
Kits were tested at time intervals during storage according to the study plan.
Characteristics monitored were performance, as well as pH, color and clarity.
Among the acceptance criteria was fluorescence (as opposed to no fluorescence)
observed in processed, infected model cells at a high level of infection (2+ to 4+)
for each of the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Reagents at 1:16 dilution. This dilution was
what was used for both the D3Ultra and D3MPV Reagents in their respective
devices. Stability studies have been conducted in two phases: (1) using kits
produced during the development phase according to draft written procedures, and
(2) using kits produced according to established procedures by manufacturing staff
(both phases are on-going). An initial indication of the shelf life of the device D3
FastPoint L-DFA Respiratory Virus Identification Kit is currently being
determined using accelerated storage at 35°C to 37°C. As of April 2009, stability
as demonstrated by the accelerated studies is 8 months. To establish the final shelf
life of the device, real-time testing (under labeled storage conditions of 2°C to
8°C) is also being conducted. As of April 2009, stability has been demonstrated to
2 months.
Shelf life for the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Respiratory Virus Identification Kit
antigen control slides
The D3 FastPoint L-DFA Respiratory Virus Identification Kit Antigen Control
Slides are prepared by combining infected cells (influenza A virus and influenza B
virus in one well, RSV and hMPV in another well, and parainfluenza virus types
1, 2, and 3 and adenovirus in another well). Non-infected cells are spotted onto 3
wells for a negative control for each reagent. Stability studies are currently being
conducted for the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Respiratory Virus Identification Kit
Antigen Control Slides; however, since they are prepared using the same
procedure and same infected cell cultures as the control slides in the D3Ultra Kit
and D3MPV Kit, a shelf life of 18 months is anticipated. Stability studies have
been conducted in two phases: (1) using slides produced during the development
phase according to draft written procedures, and (2) using slides produced
according to established procedures by manufacturing staff (both phases are on-
going). An initial indication of the shelf life of the D3Ultra Duet Antigen Control
Slides is currently being determined using accelerated storage at 35°C to 37°C. As
of April 2009, stability as demonstrated by the accelerated studies is 8 months. To
establish shelf life of the device, real-time testing (under labeled storage
conditions of 2°C to 8°C) is also being conducted. As of April 2009, stability has
been demonstrated to 2 months.
d. Analytical Sensitivity (Detection limit):
Analytical Limit of Detections of the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Reagents were
addressed using dilution series of infected model cells. Model cells for 8
characterized respiratory virus isolates; influenza A virus (ATCC Victoria strain),
17

--- Page 18 ---
influenza B virus (ATCC Taiwan strain), respiratory syncytial virus (ATCC
Washington strain), adenovirus (ATCC type 1), human metapneumovirus subtype
A1 (clinical strain), parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3 (ATCC strains C-35,
Greer, and C243 respectively) were diluted with non-infected cells to produce a
suspension equivalent to 1,000 infected cells per milliliter. This level theoretically
yields approximately 25 infected cells per 25-μL of suspension. This suspension
was then serially diluted to a theoretical level of less than 1 cell per milliliter.
(NOTE: This level was the target to begin with a low positive level. Actual
starting levels vary, however, and are within 1 dilution of the 25 infected cell
target level). 25-µL aliquots from each dilution level were spotted onto 10
replicate microscope slides, and then stained according to the instructions for use
described in this product insert. Each cell spot was examined at 200x
magnification. Results were reported as numbers of positive replicates for each
set of 10. Analytical detection limits for each of the 8 analytes were defined as the
lowest dilutions at which at least 9 out of 10 replicates were detected. Results are
summarized in the table below:

*Although the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Influenza A/Influenza B DFA Reagent has been shown to
detect the 2009 H1N1 virus in two culture isolates provided by the CDC, and well-
characterized by the CDC rRT-PCR Swine Flu Detection Panel (under an EUA), the
performance characteristics of this device with clinical specimens that are positive for the
2009 H1N1 influenza virus have not been established. The D3 FastPoint L-DFA Influenza
A/Influenza B DFA Reagent can distinguish between influenza A and B viruses, but it can
not differentiate influenza subtypes.
Analytical reactivity (inclusivity) of the D3 FastPoint L-DFA RSV/hMPV DFA Reagent was
evaluated using 3 RSV virus and 4 hMPV virus strains. Low concentration infected cell

f. Analytical Specificity:
D3 FastPoint L-DFA Respiratory Virus Identification Kit was tested for cross-
reactivity against a variety of microorganisms. Stringent conditions for cross-
reactivity testing were achieved by using both the 1.5 X concentration of
MAbs and relatively high titers of microorganisms. No cross-reactivity was
observed for 59 virus strains. Twenty-two (22) bacterial strains, one yeast, and
one Chlamydia sp. were also evaluated for cross-reactivity, including
Staphylococcus aureus, a protein-A-producing bacterium. Except for
Staphylococcus aureus, which was cross reactive with the D3 FastPoint L-
DFA Respiratory Virus Identification Kit, all other microorganisms tested
negative.
Staining of S. aureus appeared as small points of fluorescence. The Protein A
produced by the bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus, may bind the Fc portion of
some fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibodies. Such binding can be
distinguished from viral antigen binding on the basis of morphology, i.e., S.
aureus-bound fluorescence appears as small (~1-micron diameter), bright dots.

Results from testing direct respiratory specimens with bacterial contamination
must be interpreted with caution. The following language was added to the
“Limitations of Procedure” section of the product insert to address this issue:
“Light background staining may occur with specimens contaminated with
Staphylococcus aureus strains containing large amounts of protein A.
Protein A will bind to the Fc portions of conjugated antibodies. Such
binding can be distinguished from viral antigen binding on the basis of
morphology, for example, S. aureus-bound fluorescence appears as small
(~1 micron diameter), bright dots. Therefore, results from testing direct
respiratory specimens with bacterial contamination must be interpreted
with caution.”
• Fifty-nine (59) virus strains were tested for cross reactivity.
Depending on the particular virus, 1.4 x 104 to 1.4 x 105 TCID viruses
50
were inoculated into multi-well plate cultures and incubated for 24 to
72 hours to yield a 1+ to 4+ cytopathic effect. For each virus, a
confirmation stain was done with the appropriate MAb to ensure the
desired titer was achieved. These cells were then prepared as Model
Cells (scraped and resuspended in UTM). Each cell suspension of
infected Model Cells was processed according to the D3 FastPoint L-
DFA Respiratory Virus Identification Kit protocol, using 2X MAb and
was examined at 200X magnification. No cross reactivity was observed
for the viruses listed below:

At the time of the DHI the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Respiratory Virus Identification
Kit clinical studies, there were no standard or FDA cleared molecular methods
to detect hMPV in nasopharyngeal aspirates or washes from patients with signs
and symptoms of acute respiratory infection. For purposes of the clinical studies,
Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc. (DHI) established and validated a real-time Reverse
Transcriptase (RT-PCR) procedure for use as a comparative test method to
detect hMPV RNA in a clinical specimen. This real time RT-PCR assay was
developed by DHI using a primer set and TaqMan probe as described in the
publication: Maertzdorf, J., CK Wang, JB Brown, JD Quinto, M Chu, M de
Graff, BG van den Hoogen, R Spaete, ADME Osterhaus, and RAM Fouchier.
“Real-time Reverse Transcriptase PCR Assay for Detection of Human
Metapneumoviruses from All Known Lineages” J. Clin. Microbiol.
2004:42:981-986. A nucleic acid (RNA) extraction procedure was also
developed and validated, as was the RT-PCR reaction,including primer sets, and
gel electrophoresis. Detection of an amplicon in the PCR end-product is
presumptive evidence of hMPV RNA presence in a specimen. The amplicons
were sequenced by a third party (Agencourt). DHI then compared these
sequences against an established/published set of hMPV sequences.
Confirmation of the hMPV RNA sequences in the amplicon was interpreted as
verification of hMPV RNA in the specimen.
Extraction of RNA from specimens is performed with Qiagen QIAamp Viral
RNA Mini Kit according to the manufacturer’s suggested protocol (section
12.4). Briefly, the sample is lysed under highly denaturing conditions to
inactivate RNase. RNA is then bound to the QIAamp membrane, washed several
times to remove contaminants, and eluted in 60 uL RNase-free buffer. The
Human Metapneumovirus Real-Time Reverse Transcription PCR Comparator
Assay master mix contains oligonucleotide primers and target specific
oligonucleotide probes. The primers are complementary to highly conserved
sequences within the nucleocapsid gene of hMPV. Reverse transcription of the
RNA in the sample into complementary DNA (cDNA) and subsequent
amplification of DNA is performed in a Stratagene Mx3000p instrument. In this
process, the probe anneals specifically to the template followed by primer
extension and amplification. The hMPV real-time RT-PCR Comparator Assay is
based on TaqMan chemistry, which utilizes the 5' - 3' exonuclease activity of the
Taq polymerase to cleave the probe thus separating the reporter dye from the
quencher. This generates an increase in fluorescent signal upon excitation from a
light source. With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved
from their respective probes, further increasing fluorescent signal. The amount
of fluorescence at any given cycle is dependent on the amount of amplification
products present at that time. Fluorescent intensity is monitored during each
PCR cycle by the Stratagene Mx3000p instrument.
Analytical Sensitivity
The analytical sensitivity of the hMPV real-time RT-PCR/Sequencing
Comparator Assay was determined for 4 hMPV strains (subtypes A1, A2, B1
25

--- Page 26 ---
and B2). Viral stocks of 4 hMPV strains (subtypes A1, A2, B1 and B2) were
generated in LLC-MK cultured cells. The viral stocks were frozen at -70° C.
2
The TCID /mL of each stock was determined by cell culture with monoclonal
50
antibody detection. A nasopharyngeal clinical matrix was created from
nasopharyngeal swabs placed in transport medium obtained from patients with
signs and symptoms of acute respiratory infection. The matrix was tested for the
presence of hMPV RNA using the hMPV real-time RT-PCR Comparator Assay.
Patient specimens found to be negative were pooled to create sufficient material
for all of the dilutions. The quantified viral stocks were diluted with the pooled
nasopharyngeal clinical matrix to produce a suspension equivalent to the
following TCID /mL levels: 1000, 500, 250, 100, 50, 10, 1, and 0.1. Each
50
TCID /mL level dilution was extracted 10 times (80 per hMPV strain) using the
50
Qiagen Viral RNA Mini Kit. The hMPV real-time RT-PCR/Sequencing
Comparator Assay was performed in singlet using 20-µL volumes of each
extraction. Analytical detection limits for each of the 4 hMPV genetic
sublineages were defined as the lowest dilutions at which at least 9 out of 10
replicates were detected. Detailed analytical sensitivity data for the hMPV real-
time RT-PCR/Sequencing Comparator Assay are presented in the following

Extraction Efficiency
The QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit extraction efficiency was determined by
extracting serial 10-fold dilutions of cRNA and comparing the actual copies of
cRNA in the eluate versus the calculated copies if 100% recovery. The actual
copies of cRNA were obtained from the qRT-PCR standard curve constructed
by a serial dilution of un-extracted cRNA standards. The extraction efficiency
ranges from 25 to 40%. The range was obtained from triplicate extractions
repeated over 3 days. Duplicate PCR reactions were performed on each dilution.
Detailed results of this study are presented in the following table:

Sample Freeze and Thaw Study
A study was performed to demonstrate that freezing the specimens would not
alter the performance of the hMPV real-time RT-PCR Comparator Assay.
Characterized hMPV isolates (subtypes A1, A2, B1, and B2) were spiked
separately into fresh nasopharyngeal swab and nasopharyngeal aspirate
specimens at known concentrations. The specimens were split into two aliquots:
one was extracted and tested using the hMPV real-time RT-PCR Comparator
Assay, the other was frozen at -70°C overnight and then extracted and tested
using the hMPV real-time RT-PCR Comparator Assay.

The data indicates that freezing and thawing nasopharyngeal swab and
nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens does not alter the performance of the hMPV
real-time RT-PCR Comparator Assay significantly.
Based on thorough analytical validations, the hMPV real-time RT-PCR
Comparator Assay is an acceptable method to be used to confirm all hMPV
negative samples as determined by the FDA cleared comparator DSFA
device (D Metapneumovirus DFA Reagent) in the DHI D3 FastPoint L-
3
DFA Respiratory Virus Identification Kit Clinical Trial.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Prospective Clinical Studies Testing Direct Respiratory Specimens
Performance of the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Respiratory Virus Identification Kit testing
direct respiratory specimens were established during prospective studies at 4
geographically diverse U.S. clinical laboratories during the 2008/2009 respiratory
virus seasons (January 2008 – March 2009). All specimens used in the studies
meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria represented excess, remnants of
respiratory specimens that were prospectively collected from symptomatic
individuals suspected of respiratory infection, and were submitted for routine care or
analysis by each site, and that otherwise would have been discarded. Individual
specimens were delinked from all patient identifiers and given a study sample code.
All clinical sites were granted waivers of informed consent by their IRBs for this
study.
Performance of the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Respiratory Virus Identification Kit
detecting influenza A, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus,
and adenovirus from direct specimens was assessed and compared to DSFA testing
using FDA cleared comparator DSFA devices (D3Ultra DFA Respiratory Virus
Screening & ID Kit or D3Duet DFA RSV/Respiratory Virus Screening Kit),
followed by viral culture confirmation of all negative specimens (as determined by
the FDA cleared DSFA comparator devices), using FDA cleared DFA reagents.
Performance of the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Respiratory Virus Identification Kit
detecting human metapneumovirus from direct specimens was assessed and
compared to DSFA testing using FDA cleared comparator DSFA device (D3
Metapneumovirus DFA Reagent), followed by confirmation of all frozen negative
specimens (as determined by the FDA cleared DSFA comparator device), using a
validated hMPV real-time RT-PCR followed by bi-directional sequencing analysis
comparator assay. The hMPV real-time RT-PCR comparator assay targets the
hMPV Nucleocapsid gene. “True” hMPV positive was defined as any sample that
either tested positive by the FDA cleared DSFA comparator device, or had bi-
directional sequencing data meeting pre-defined quality acceptance criteria that
matched hMPV sequences deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) GenBank database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), with acceptable E-
30

--- Page 31 ---
values. “True” hMPV negative was defined as any sample that tested negative by
both the FDA cleared DSFA comparator device and the hMPV real-time RT-PCR
comparator assay.
The E-values generated from the clinical trials range from a low of 5e-78 to a high
of 1e-20. The E-Value from NCBI BLAST Alignment indicates the statistical
significance of a given pair-wise alignment and reflects the size of the database and
the scoring system used. The lower the E-Value, the more significant the hit. A
sequence alignment that has an E-Value of 1e-3 means that this similarity has a 1 in
1000 chance of occurring by chance alone.
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=handbook.section.614).
Therefore an E-Value ranging from 1e-20 to 5e-78 has a very low probability of
occurring purely by chance.
Study Site 1 evaluated a total of 323 fresh respiratory specimens submitted, January
2009 through March 2009, to the laboratory for respiratory virus testing. Slides were
prepared from Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)-washed cells from the fresh
specimens and processed according to the prescribed protocol. The slides were
stained in accordance with the procedure in the product insert.

Of the 323 fresh respiratory specimens tested, all were nasal wash/nasopharyngeal
aspirate specimens. Of the 323 fresh nasal wash/nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens
tested, 2 nasal wash/nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens were excluded from the
performance analysis due to insufficient sample volume for the investigational
device testing. 70 specimens for Flu A, 79 specimens for Flu B, 37 specimens for
RSV, 75 specimens for adenovirus, 79 specimens for HPIV, and 3 specimens for
hMPV, were excluded from the respective performance analysis due to insufficient
sample volume for the comparator methods, resulting in a total of 251 fresh nasal

Of the 105 fresh respiratory specimens tested, 86 were nasal wash/nasopharyngeal
aspirate specimens. Due to insufficient sample numbers to establish performance of
the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Respiratory Virus Identification Kit, 19 other types of
respiratory specimens were removed from performance analysis. None of the nasal
wash/nasopharyngeal aspirate samples for Flu A, Flu B, RSV, Adenovirus and
HPIV were excluded from the respective performance analysis due to insufficient
sample volume for the comparator methods, resulting in a total of 86 fresh nasal
wash/nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens for Flu A, Flu B, RSV, Adenovirus and
HPIV to be included in the respective performance analysis. 10 specimens for
hMPV were excluded from the respective performance analysis due to insufficient
sample volume for the comparator methods, resulting in a total of 76 fresh nasal
wash/nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens for hMPV to be included in the
performance analysis. The tables below summarized the study results of the claimed

Of the 443 fresh respiratory specimens tested, 301 were nasal wash/nasopharyngeal
aspirate specimens, and 140 were nasal/nasopharyngeal swab specimens. One (1)
nasal wash/nasopharyngeal aspirate specimen was excluded from the performance
analysis due to the fact that the sample was tested by the investigational device greater
than 48 hours post sample collection. Due to insufficient sample numbers to establish
performance of the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Respiratory Virus Identification Kit, 2 other
types of respiratory specimens were further removed from performance analysis.

In the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Respiratory Virus Identification Kit multicenter
prospective clinical study testing direct respiratory specimens, a total of 1519
eligible respiratory specimens were tested using the D3 FastPoint L-DFA
Respiratory Virus Identification Kit from four U.S. clinical laboratories across the
United States during the 2008/2009 respiratory virus seasons (January 2008 –
March 2009). Prevalence for each analyte (i.e., Flu A, Flu B, RSV, hMPV,
Adenovirus, HPIV) as determined by the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Respiratory Virus
Identification Kit direct specimen testing varied from 7.1% to 8.8% by site and
averaged 7.6% for Flu A; varied from 0.6% to 31.2% by site and averaged 14.0%
for Flu B; varied from 4.5% to 31.0% by site and averaged 13.4% for RSV; varied
from 2.2% to 8.4% by site and averaged 5.1% for hMPV; varied from 0% to 2.5%
by site and averaged 0.9% for Adenovirus; and varied from 0.9% to 5.2% by site
and averaged 2.6% for HPIV. The number and percentage of positive cases
determined by the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Respiratory Virus Identification Kit direct
specimen testing, calculated by age group, are presented in the following tables:
