H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indication(s) for use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Clinitek Status®+ Urine Chemistry Analyzer is a portable analyzer. It is
designed to read only Siemens Reagent Strips for Urinalysis and Clinitest® hCG
tests.
This analyzer is intended for the measurement of the following in urine: Albumin,
Bilirubin, Blood (Occult), Creatinine, Glucose, Ketone, Leukocytes, Nitrite, pH,
Protein, Protein-to-Creatinine Ratio, Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio, Specific
Gravity, Urobilinogen, and human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG).
These measurements are used to assist diagnosis in the following areas:
· Kidney Function
· Urinary tract infections
· Metabolic disorders (e.g. diabetes mellitus)
· Liver Function
· Pregnancy
Tests performed using the Clinitek Status®+ Analyzer are intended for in vitro
diagnostic use only.
The Clinitek Status®+ Analyzer is intended for near patient (point-of-care)
facilities and centralized laboratory locations.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription use
4. Special instrument requirements:
Clinitek Status+Analyzer or Clinitek Status Connect System
I. Device Description:
The Clinitek Status®+ Analyzer, a device modification/enhancement to the current
Clinitek Status®, is a portable analyzer. It is designed to read only Siemens Reagent
Strips for Urinalysis and Clinitest® hCG tests.
Identical to the Clinitek Status Analyzer, the Clinitek Status+ analyzer is intended for
2 of 18

--- Page 3 ---
the measurement of the following in urine: Albumin, Bilirubin, Blood (Occult),
Creatinine, Glucose, Ketone, Leukocytes, Nitrite, pH, Protein, Protein-to-Creatinine
Ratio, Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio, Specific Gravity, Urobilinogen, and human
Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG). There are no changes in reporting ranges as a result
of this design improvement.
As with the current analyzer, the Clinitek Status®+ is intended for use in a
physician’s office or hospital laboratory. Tests performed using the Clinitek Status®+
analyzer are intended for in vitro diagnostic use.
The Clinitek Status®+ analyzer optical system, urinalysis strip analytical method,
immunoassay cassette analytical method, and main test steps remain the same as
Clinitek Status®. They are not impacted by this design upgrade.
Since the SPlus and SConnect (SPlus instrument with LIS connection) are instrument
upgrades only, the reagents used on SPlus and SConnect are the same as the existing
reagents used on the Status (predicate instrument). No changes were made to the
reagents used with the Clinitek Status, nor were changes made to the instruments
optics, reagent handling system, control system, or assay timing.

differ by ± 1 color block are highlighted in blue.
• For each cell in the tabular summary the exact % agreement
(test/predicate*100) between the test and predicate device is shown in
percent form below as the frequency for each analyte/color block.
% Exact Agreement = sum of specimens where color block response for the
test device agrees exactly with the color block response for the predicate
device divided by the total number of specimens (x100).
% Within One Block Agreement = (sum of cases where color block response
for the test device agrees exactly with the color block response for the
predicate device) + (the sum of the cases where the color block response for
the test condition are ± 1 color block relative the predicate condition) divided
