I. Device Description:
VALIDATE GC1 Calibration Verification/Linearity Test Set is in a human serum matrix
that is compatible with chemistry systems for measuring albumin (ALB), blood urea
nitrogen (BUN), calcium (CA), cholesterol (CHOL), chloride (CL), creatinine (CREA),
glucose (GLU), potassium (K), lactate (LAC), lithium (LITH), magnesium (MG), sodium
(NA), phosphorous (PHOS), total protein (TP), triglycerides (TRIG), and uric acid (UA).
This test set includes 5 levels that have a linear relationship. Each bottle contains 4.0 mL of
solution.
VALIDATE GC2 Calibration Verification/Linearity Test Set solutions is in an aqueous
matrix that is compatible with chemistry systems for measuring carbon dioxide (CO2), ethyl
alcohol (ETOH), ammonia (NH3), and Iron (FE). This test set includes 5 levels that have a
linear relationship and a base matrix. Each bottle contains 3.0 mL of solution.
VALIDATE GC3 Calibration Verification/Linearity Test Set is in a human serum matrix
that is compatible with chemistry systems for measuring alkaline phosphatase (ALP),
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), amylase (AMY), aspartate aminotransferase (AST),
creatine kinase (CK), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), lactate dehydrogenase (LD), and

that is compatible with chemistry systems for measuring total bilirubin (TBIL) and direct
bilirubin (DBIL). This test set includes 5 levels that have a linear relationship and a base
matrix. Each bottle contains 3.0 mL of solution.
Each lot of the VALIDATE GC test set is manufactured such that a linear relationship exists
among the Levels 1 through 5. Therefore, the actual recovered values are used to calculate
the target values. The expected value of the Base Matrix is zero; however, in some
instances a non-zero result may be obtained.
VALIDATE GC1, GC3 and GC4 Calibration Verification/Linearity Test Sets contain
human source material and include the following warning in the insert: Human source
material is considered potentially biohazardous. Material of human origin used in the
manufacture of this test set was tested using FDA approved methods and found to be non-
reactive for HBsAg and to antibodies to HCV and HIV-1/2. Because no test method can
offer complete assurance that infectious agents are absent, these specimens should be
handled and treated as potentially infectious.
VALIDATE GC2 Calibration Verification/Linearity Test Set is in an aqueous matrix and
contains no human source material.

Not Applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
For VALIDATE GC1, GC2, and GC4 Calibration Verification/Linearity Test Sets
the sponsor states that solutions are tested during manufacturing with standards
traceable to National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard
Reference Material (SRM), where available. For analytes where NIST materials
are not available, primary analytical standards are used.
VALIDATE GC3 Calibration Verification/Linearity Test Set: No traceability
claims were made.
Stability:
Real-time, open bottle, stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were
reviewed and found to be acceptable. GC2 is held at 2 to 8°C whereas GC1, GC3
and GC4 were held at -10 to -20°C for up to 13 months (one month beyond the
claimed shelf life). Test sets are stable until the expiration date printed on the
bottle when stored according to instructions at -10 to -20°C for GC1, GC3, and
GC4 and 2 to 8°C for GC2. A maximum of four (4) freeze-thaw cycles are
recommended for GC1, GC3, and GC4 and it is recommended not to freeze GC2.
Value Assignment:
Levels 1 and 5 are spiked with the required raw materials and intermediate levels
(2-4) are made by following EP6-A by equal part dilutions. For value assignment
samples are tested, in triplicate, at three stages of manufacturing: in process (level
1 and 5), secondary (all levels) and final product in bottles (all levels). Each
determination must fall within the cited acceptance range. Appropriate controls
are run with each determination. The analyzer used for analysis depends on the
