Each test-set consisted of randomly selecting one of the ten glucose meters
and conducting data transmission. The process was repeated until all the
glucose meters were tested. All stored test results in glucose meters were
recorded before conducting the data transmission. Acceptance criteria
were that the transmitted data will not be different from the previous
recorded data.
To determine the repeatability of data transmission from the meter to PC,
the sponsor demonstrated the performance of the GlucoManager Data
Management Software to meet the evaluation protocol and acceptance
criteria stated below.
One glucose meter with 480 stored test results transmitted complete data
set 100 times. Acceptance criteria were that the transmitted data will not
be different from the previous recorded data. This protocol did not have
any incorrect data.
A User acceptance Study using 106 subjects was conducted to evaluate the
GlucoManager Data Management Software with the following objectives:
• To evaluate design and ease-of-use
• To document participant feedback on the features / functions
• To document Observer feedback on participant performance
• To validate that the user instructions are accurate and easy to follow
• To evaluate participant ratings with respect to features / functions
• To report any discrepancies (bugs/error messages) found during the
evaluation
The subjects (Users) were required to have a minimum of basic computer
skills and feel comfortable using a Windows-based Operating System.
Conclusions were based on the subjects’ ability to demonstrate by usage
and evaluation (rating) of features/functions (recorded as responses to 19
feature/function tests), their understanding of the applications of the
software, their understanding of how to use the software, their
comprehension of the contents of the instructions for use, as well as user
assessment of ease-of-use based on a separate questionnaire.
Performance of each User was recorded and evaluated by EPS study
administrators (Observers), who are familiar with proper use of
GlucoManager Data Management Software. Observers rated each
subject’s performance using four general questions.
K. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
