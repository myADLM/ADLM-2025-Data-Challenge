L. Test Principle:
The RAMP® RSV Assay is a qualitative immunochromatographic test that utilizes the
RAMP® 200 Reader for the identification of the presence of RSV F-protein antigens
in nasal wash/aspirate, nasopharyngeal aspirate (NP aspirate) and nasopharyngeal
swab (NP swab) samples.
A wash/aspirate or swab sample is added to the Sample Buffer. This sample is then
mixed with the Assay Tip containing fluorescent-dyed particles conjugated to RSV
specific antibodies and applied into the sample well of the Test Cartridge. The sample
migrates along the strip.
Fluorescent-dyed particles coated with anti-RSV antibodies bind to RSV F-protein
antigens, if present in the sample. As the sample migrates along the strip, RSV-bound
particles are captured at the detection zone which is coated with monoclonal
antibodies anti RSV-F. Excess fluorescent-dyed particles are captured at the internal
standard zone which is coated with goat anti-mouse IgG.
The Reader then measures the amount of fluorescence emitted by the complexes at
the detection zone and at the internal standard zone. The instrument calculates a ratio
(RAMP® Ratio) of the detection zone fluorescence reading to the internal standard
zone fluorescence reading. The Reader then compares these ratios to pre-defined
threshold limits to determine a positive or negative result for RSV in the tested
sample. The RAMP® 200 is a general use fluorometer that analyzes results produced
by immunoassays that use a fluorophore having an excitation wavelength of 560 nm
and an emission wavelength of 610 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision and reproducibility of the RAMP RSV Assay was evaluated
using a panel consisting of a high negative RSV sample, a limit of detection
(LoD) RSV sample (low positive), and a 2x LoD RSV sample (moderate
positive). The RSV strain used to prepare the samples was RSV A (A-2)

(ATCC VR-1540) following viral titer determinations. To evaluate
reproducibility, multiple operators at multiple sites tested each of the three
precision samples on 5 different days. Testing at Site 2 was performed in a
point-of-care (POC) setting (pediatric clinic, under CLIA umbrella of the
hospital). At one site (Site 3), to evaluate precision, operators tested each of
the three precision samples an additional 7 days for a total of 12 days. There
was 99.2% agreement (393/396) with the expected test results for all
specimens tested, with no significant differences within run (same operator on
same day) between run, operators or sites. The RAMP RSV Assay is a
qualitative assay based on numerical RAMP Ratio values.

f. Assay cut-off:
The kit lot threshold is determined by applying a standard factor to the
difference in the mean RAMP Ratios between the negative and the QC
standard. This estimated range of the factor was determined though pre-
clinical testing with retrospective positive and negative clinical samples. The
value of the factor was found to be optimized at 0.7 and validated by Receiver
Operator Curve (ROC) analysis. This lot-specific threshold is then
programmed into the lot cards and must be uploaded to the reader when a new
kit lot is opened in order to run a test. This factor was then applied to the
clinical trial lots to determine the clinical results and will be the standard
factor used to generate the lot-specific Ratio Threshold for all manufacturing
lots.

present), an RSV LoD positive sample and an RSV 2x LoD positive
sample in the RSV test. The RSV strain used to prepare the samples was
RSV A (A-2) following titer determination. Each swab was dosed with
the appropriate sample and extracted into Copan Universal Transport
Media prior to testing in the RAMP RSV Assay. The RAMP RSV Assay
is a qualitative assay based on numerical RAMP Ratio values. The %CVs
were calculated for the RAMP Ratios. The negative sample (swab alone)
tested negative and all 2x LoD samples tested positive. None of the swabs
tested interfered with the performance of the RAMP RSV Assay. Note: In
general, calcium alginate swabs are not recommended because they may
be cytotoxic to cells and cause viral culture assay inhibition.

Prospective Clinical Studies:
The performance of the RAMP RSV Assay was compared to cell culture and
DSFA in a prospective study conducted as part of a multi-center trial during
the 2008-2009 RSV season. Eight (8) independent laboratories located in
distinct geographical regions across the United States (NY, MO(2), MD,
OH(2), MA, AR) evaluated the RAMP RSV Assay in parallel with cell culture
/ DSFA. Testing staff included both laboratory and non-laboratory personnel,
and two sites (MO, AR) also performed testing in point-of-care settings (near
patient). The sites included an Emergency Department and Pediatric Testing
Unit (both under CLIA umbrella of the individual hospital). One thousand,
two hundred and seventy nine (1279) fresh specimens were collected from
pediatric patients 21 years of age and younger. Of these specimens, valid
results were obtained from 1140, with an approximately equal mix of male
and female patients. During the clinical study, if either the cell culture or
DSFA result was positive for a patient sample, it was determined to be a
positive reference result. A reference result was deemed negative only if both,
culture and DSFA, were negative

The prevalence of RSV varies each year with epidemics occurring during the fall
and winter months in the US. Variables that affect the rate of positivity observed
in respiratory testing include: the efficiency and timing of specimen collection,
handling and transport of the specimen, the time of year, age of the patient, and
local disease prevalence.
The prevalence observed with culture and DSFA during the clinical study
(November 2008 – February 2009) was 33.9% (443/1306). During the previous
U.S. respiratory season (October 2007 – March 2008), the prevalence of RSV was
15.9%8.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
