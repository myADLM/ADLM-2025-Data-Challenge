L. Test Principle:
Diluted samples are incubated in wells coated with EBV Early Antigen D.
Antibodies directed against the antigen (if present) are bound to the EA-D antigen
and immobilized on the wells. Residual sample is eliminated by washing and
draining, and conjugate (enzyme-labeled goat antibodies to human IgG) is added and
incubated. If IgG antibodies to EBV Early Antigen D are present, the conjugate will
be immobilized on the wells. Residual conjugate is eliminated by washing and
draining, and the enzyme substrate is added and incubated. In the presence of the
enzyme, the substrate is converted to a yellow end-product which is read
photometrically at 405 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility panel of six (6) members was prepared by the Quest
International laboratory. One (1) of the six panel members was negative for
EBV EA-D IgG. One (1) of the six panel members had levels of EBV EA-D
IgG near the assay cut-off that was considered a high negative to equivocal
sample. Four (4) of the six panel members were positive for EBV EA-D IgG.
All panel members were prepared from patient samples. This panel was split
into aliquots and tested at three (3) different clinical sites. In addition, one (1)
SeraQuest human Anti-EA-D IgG positive serum control and one (1)
SeraQuest human Anti-EA-D IgG negative serum control were also tested.
Each of the six (6) panel members and the SeraQuest positive and negative
controls were tested three times (x3) on each day in one run for 3 days at each
of the three (3) US testing sites (3 times x 3 days x 3 sites = 27 replicates per
panel member and SeraQuest control). The data was analyzed for intra-assay,
inter-assay and between-site reproducibility. The standard deviation (SD) and
percent coefficient of variation (%CV) were calculated. Results can be found
in Table 1.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrator index is traced to the in-house secondary standard for the
SeraQuest EBV EA-D IgG test. The SeraQuest EBV EA-D IgG Secondary
Standard was originally established in assays using the Trinity Biotech EBV
EA-D IgG Calibrator with the SeraQuest EBV EA-D IgG Test reagents. A
positive serum sample was adjusted by dilution to give an index value of 1.0
relative to the Trinity Calibrator. This became the first SeraQuest EBV EA-D
IgG Calibrator, and aliquots were set aside as the in-house secondary
standard.
d. Detection limit: Not applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
The cross-reactivity studies were designed to determine if samples from
various disease states and other potentially interfering factors interfere with
test results when tested with the SeraQuest EBV EA-D IgG Test. Specimens
that were positive for various infectious diseases, heterophilic antibodies,

Calibrator, with the SeraQuest EBV EA-D reagents. A positive serum sample
was adjusted by dilution to give an index value of 1.0 relative to the Trinity
Calibrator. This became the first SeraQuest EBV EA-D IgG Calibrator, and
aliquots were set aside as the in-house secondary standard. The Calibrator /
Secondary standard was then challenged in comparisons using the SeraQuest
test and the Trinity test. The equivocal zone ( ≥0.9 to < 1.1) was set 10%
above, and 10% below, the cut-off value of 1.0.
The test cut-off was confirmed using a negative population for EBV EA-D
IgG. The SeraQuest EBV EA-D IgG Test results were determined for this
negative population, and the cut-off was confirmed at approximately the mean
of the negative results plus two times the standard deviation (SD).
g. Interfering Substances:
The possible effects of icterus, hemolysis, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and
hyperproteinemia, on the results of the SeraQuest EBV EA-D IgG test, were
examined. A sample panel consisted of one weak positive serum sample
(close to the assay cut-off) and one negative sample was prepared. Each
serum specimen was first tested without any of the additive. This served as
the control representing the normal physiological concentration of each of the
potential interfering substances. In addition, aliquots of each serum specimen
were supplemented with 8 times the normal level of each potential interferent.
These levels were selected to exceed the levels that could be present in disease
state sera. The normal and the “enriched” serum specimens with bilirubin,
hemoglobin, glucose, cholesterol, and gamma globulin were tested following
the SeraQuest EBV EA-D IgG Instructions for Use. Results can be found in
Table 3.

No significant interference was observed in the presence of up to eight times
the normal physiological concentration of each of the potential interfering
substances tested with the SeraQuest EBV EA-D IgG Test. There were no
false negative results for the weak positive specimen and no false positive
results for the negative specimens that were encountered in the presence of
each of the potential interferents. However, the possibilities of interferences
by the substances tested above can not be definitively ruled out. They have
been addressed in the product package insert as limitations and warnings.
h. Reaction Stability:
A full SeraQuest ELISA plate containing ninety-one (91) samples was read
immediately after the final reaction was stopped, and again after being
allowed to stand at room temperature overnight, for 19 hours. No qualitative
differences in the results were observed between the two readings. This data
supports the statement in the “test procedure” section of the product package
insert that states “Readings should be made within 2 hours after the reactions
have been stopped at room temperature.”

Performance Characteristics
Performance of the SeraQuest EBV EA-D IgG Test was evaluated against
another FDA cleared EBV EA-D IgG ELISA test according to the EBV
serological characterization of the specimens as determined by other EBV
serological reagents. For purposes of classifying the EBV serological state,
specimens were tested by reference EBV serology assays for EBV VCA IgG,
EBV VCA IgM, and EBV EBNA-1 IgG. The EBV EA-D IgG result
8

--- Page 9 ---
generated by the FDA cleared comparator EBV EA-D IgG ELISA test was
not considered for purposes of characterizing the EBV serological state of the
specimen. A total of 542 serum samples for which EBV serology tests were
ordered was tested at 3 U.S. clinical testing sites. Of the 542 specimens, 477
were prospectively collected and prospectively tested specimens, and 65 were
prospectively collected but retrospectively tested specimens to supplement the
prospective study data. Of the 65 prospectively collected but retrospectively
tested specimens, 50 were acute specimens and 15 were EBV seronegative
specimens characterized by reference EBV serology assays for EBV VCA
IgG, EBV VCA IgM, and EBV EBNA-1 IgG. Based upon the results of the
three reference EBV serology tests, the specimens were categorized into one
of four EBV serological state groups as indicated in Table 4 below.

Using Table 4 as a guideline, testing results were analyzed by the SeraQuest
EBV EA-D IgG Test and corresponding comparative EBV EA-D IgG ELISA
test according to EBV serological characterization based on EBV serology
reference assays results. For the purpose of percent agreement calculations,
SeraQuest EBV EA-D IgG Test equivocal results were assigned to the
opposite test result interpretation than that of the corresponding comparative
test results. Likewise, the comparative test equivocal results were assigned to
the opposite test result interpretation than that of the corresponding SeraQuest
EBV EA-D IgG Test results.
Prospectively collected and prospectively tested 50 sample results from Site A

See assay cut-off previously described in this document
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The clinical study included a total of 477 prospectively collected and
prospectively tested specimens. The specimens were tested at three sites: Quest
International, Inc. (Laboratory A) and two other clinical laboratories; one located
in Midwestern U.S. (Laboratory B) and one located in the Southeastern region
(Laboratory C). Of the 477 prospectively collected and prospectively tested
specimens, patient demographic information were available for 153 samples that
were tested at Laboratory C. This particular patient cohort was comprised of 63%
females and 37% males. Their ages ranged from 3 to 88 years, with an average
age of 37.9 years. All serum samples in this patient cohort originated in Florida,
Georgia and Alabama. Expected values for the SeraQuest EBV EA-D IgG Kit are
presented by age and gender in Table 19 for serum samples from this particular
patient cohort (N=153).
