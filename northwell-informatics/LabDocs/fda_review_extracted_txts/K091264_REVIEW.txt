H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
For use with MicroScan® Dried Gram Positive MIC/Combo, Dried Gram
Positive Breakpoint Combo and Dried Gram Positive ID Type 2 panels.
MicroScan® Positive panels are designed for use in determining antimicrobial
agent susceptibility and/or identification to the species level of rapidly growing
aerobic and facultative gram-positive cocci and Listeria monocytogenes. Refer to
Limitations of Procedures section of the package insert for use with fastidious
streptococci.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The MicroScan® Dried Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panel is used to determine
quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies
grown on solid media of rapidly growing aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-
positive cocci. After inoculation, panels are incubated for 16-24 hours at 35ºC +/-
1ºC in a non-CO2 incubator, and read either visually or with MicroScan
instrumentation, according to the package insert.
This particular submission is for the evaluation of antimicrobial agent
Vancomycin on the MicroScan Dried Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panels utilizing
the updated Staphylococcus aureus interpretative criteria (S<2, I = 4-8, R>16).

--- Page 3 ---
The gram positive organisms which may be used for Vancomycin susceptibility
testing in this panel are:
Enterococcus spp. (e.g., Enterococcus faecalis)
Staphylococcus spp. (including Staphylococcus aureus)
Staphylococcus epidermidis (including methicillin-resistant strains)
Streptococcus agalactiae
Streptococcus bovis
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
The Prompt™ method of inoculation is an alternate method of inoculum
preparation that is supported in the methodology along with the turbidity method.
The stationary and log inoculum methods should not be used with this antibiotic.
4. Special instrument requirements:
These panels can be read at >16 hours of incubation either manually,
automatically on the autoSCAN® 4, or with the WalkAway® instrument system.
For best detection of VRSA, vancomycin results with staphylococci should be
read/interpreted after 18 hours, especially when using the autoSCAN® 4
instrument to read results.
I. Device Description:
The MicroScan® Dried Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panel contains microdilutions of
each antimicrobial agent in various concentrations with Mueller Hinton Broth and
various nutrients which are dehydrated and dried in panels. Each panel contains two
control wells; a no-growth control well (contains water only/no nutrients or broth),
and a growth control well (contains test medium without antibiotic). The panel is
rehydrated and inoculated at the same time with 0.1 ml of suspension prepared by the
turbidity method (i.e., inoculum prepared in water, then 0.1ml transferred to 25 ml of
inoculum water containing Pluronic-D/F – a wetting solution) for a final inoculum
concentration of 3 – 7X105 CFU/ml. The Prompt™ method of inoculation is also
recommended as an alternate means of preparing the inoculum. The panels are
incubated at 35ºC in a non-CO2 environment, for 16-24 hours. The panels are then
read by visual observation of growth. Panels may also be read automatically with the
autoSCAN® or the WalkAway® instruments.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA;
CLSI M7 (M100-S19) Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility
Testing; Nineteenth Informational Supplement
L. Test Principle:
After incubation in a non-CO2 incubator for 16-24 hours, the minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) for the test organism is read by determining the lowest
antimicrobial concentration showing inhibition of growth. The panels are read either
manually using a touchSCAN® SR, or using either the WalkAway® or autoSCAN®
instruments. The WalkAway® and autoSCAN® instruments both use an optics
system in conjunction with growth algorithms to directly measure organism growth.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The scope of this particular submission is the evaluation of the antimicrobial
agent vancomycin on the MicroScan Dried Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panels
utilizing the new, FDA approved, vancomycin breakpoint interpretative
criteria (S<2, I = 4-8, R>16) for Staphylococcus aureus. Efficacy studies of
both clinical and challenge isolates from the original 510(k), K051202, were
re-evaluated using the new breakpoint interpretive criteria in order to assess
device performance. No new clinical or analytical studies were conducted in
support of this submission.
The reproducibility studies of the original 510(k) submission for the device,
for all methods, was found to be >95% reproducible.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The FDA and CLSI recommends the testing of Quality Control (QC) isolate,
S.aureus ATCC 29213 to monitor and ensure the accuracy, precision and
integrity of the supplies, reagents and drug used in the assay system, as well as
the techniques of the individuals performing the test.

--- Page 6 ---
The quality control results of the original 510(k), K051202, are listed in the
table to follow. All results were read at 18 and 24 hours. The Prompt™
inoculation method in conjunction with the 24 hour readings for the S.aureus
ATCC 29213, fall out-of-range on the high end, on several occasions. There
was a recommendation made at that time that QC be read at 16-20 hours. This
was mentioned as one reason why MicroScan® does not want to have all
isolates read at 24 hours.
This 510(k) submission is for the evaluation of the antimicrobial agent
vancomycin on the MicroScan Dried Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panels using
the new, FDA approved, vancomycin breakpoint interpretative criteria
(S<2, I = 4-8, R>16) for Staphylococcus aureus. The expected range of S.
aureus ATCC 29213 when tested in conjunction with vancomycin has not
changed, therefore, a re-evaluation of the quality control data would provide
no new information and is therefore not needed.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
This 510(k) application was submitted for the evaluation of vancomycin on
the MicroScan Dried Gram Positive MIC/Combo Panel using the new FDA
approved breakpoint interpretive criteria (S<2, I=4-8, R>16).
Performance data specific for the isolates of S.aureus from the original 510(k)
submission, K051202, have been re-evaluated using the new interpretive
criteria.
A total of 51 clinical isolates and 43 challenge isolates of S.aureus,
representing MRSA, MSSA, and VRSA were re-evaluated. The results were
compared to the reference method or expected results.
Table A below demonstrates the performance based on essential agreement
and category agreement for the overall performance of the clinical and
challenge isolates in combination with the turbidity method of inoculation and
manual readings. Similar calculations for the different inoculation and
reading methods were performed and show very little difference. These data
are included in Tables B – F.

EA = Essential Agreement CA = Category Agreement
R = Resistant Isolates min = minor discrepancies
maj = major discrepancies vmj = very major discrepancies
Evaluable results are those that fall within the test range of the reference method
and could also be on-scale with the new device if within plus/minus one dilution.
Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the result of the
reference method and that of MicroScan® within plus or minus one serial two-fold
dilution of the antibiotic. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the
interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees exactly with the
interpretation of the MicroScan® result.
Specifically related to the data of the challenge isolates tested, the percent Category
Agreement (CA) falls consistently below the acceptance criteria of greater than or
equal to 90%, as outlined in the Class II Special Controls Guidance Document:
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems Guidance. This is due to the low
number of challenge isolates tested in conjunction with the occurrence of a number
of minor discrepancies, due to the change in the breakpoint interpretive criteria. In
each instance (with only one exception), the minor discrepancy fell within Essential
Agreement (EA) of the reference method result. In each instance, if the minor
discrepancies that fall within Essential Agreement are removed, the percent
Category Agreement of the challenge data would fall well within the acceptance
criteria of greater than or equal to 90%.
