antibody is labeled with alkaline phosphatase. The use of an amino acid co-polymer
amplifies the amount of allergen that the matrix can support. The chemiluminiscent
detection system is a phosphatase ester of stabilized dioxatane. Cleavage of the
phosphate ester by alkaline phosphatase results in the decomposition of dioxatane and
the emission of photons, which are quantified by a luminometer.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility of the assay was assessed by testing three positive samples
and one negative control sample of each allergen (Sunflower Seed,
Aspergillus niger, Cephalosporium acremonium, Poplar, Careless Weed,
Saltbush) in duplicate twice a day for 20 different days (n = 80).
The sponsor’s criterion for the negative sample was the average dose must be
<0.10 kU/L; all negative sample results were within the acceptance criterion.
The sponsor’s acceptance criterion for the positive samples was ≤15% CV for
both within-run and total precision. Three allergen lots were tested for each
allergen; representative data from one lot is shown below for the positive
samples. The intra-assay and inter-assay %CV ranges were from 2.74% to
6.07% and 4.05% to 9.82%, respectively (see tables below).

Lot to lot reproducibility:
Each of the six allergens was tested as above with three positive samples
using three different lots (n=240). Within run imprecision for the
sample/allergen combinations ranged from 2.39% to 4.38%; total imprecision
of the sample/allergen combinations ranged from 3.78% to 6.08%. All three
lots for the six allergens were within the acceptable criterion of ≤ 20%
variability.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies: For each allergen, two samples were diluted in 2-fold serial
dilutions to 5 levels. The undiluted (neat) and diluted samples were tested
with the specific allergen to demonstrate linearity at concentrations within the
assay limits. Regression statistics for each allergen comparing the observed
results to expected results are presented below.

Assay working ranges: 0.1 – 100 kU/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The calibrators and controls are traceable to the WHO 2nd IRP
75/502 reference standard for human IgE.
Stability: Accelerated allergen stability testing (15-28ºC for 57 days; assay
kits stored at recommended temperature 2-8ºC). The accelerated study
supports a two year shelf-life stability claim.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB): Three runs assaying the blank sample (zero calibrator)
were performed to estimate the Limit of Blank (LoB). A total of three
instruments were used per run. The maximum dose of the LoB was selected as
the most conservative LoB: LoB = 0.026. The claimed LoB is 0.1 kU/L.
MAX
Limit of Detection (LoD): Five samples were used to estimate the Limit of
Detection (LoD). Sixty replicates of each sample were assayed per run. A total
of 2 runs were completed with testing performed on 2 different instruments.
The LoD was calculated for each sample using the formula: LoD = LoB +
MAX
(1.65 * SD ) The claimed LoD is 0.1 kU/L
LOD .
e. Analytical specificity:
Inhibition studies: Specificity of each allergen was verified through
competitive inhibition testing using a single serum sample or a serum pool. A
negative sample was used to measure the background response.
To initiate the inhibition experiment, 70 µL of undiluted and 4 levels of 5-fold
serially diluted inhibitor extract were mixed with 250 µL of sample or pool.
This mixture was incubated at room temperature (15-28°C) for 1 hour
allowing the immunological reaction to occur. Each sample mixture
containing the inhibitor extract and the appropriate controls was assayed with
one lot of each allergen. The percent (%) inhibition was calculated according
to the following formula:
(Response of pos. control – sample response with inhibitor extract)
(pos. sample – neg. sample) X 100
(Response of pos. control )
(pos. sample – neg. sample)
The inhibition study demonstrated that the allergens tested are inhibited by the
relevant inhibitor extract in a concentration dependent fashion. Summary
inhibition table is presented below.

Clinical performance of the IMMULITE® 2000 3gAllergy Specific IgE assay
for Sunflower Seed, Aspergillus niger, Cephalosporium acremonium, Poplar,
Careless Weed, Saltbush allergens was demonstrated by testing samples from
non-atopic and atopic individuals. Atopic patients were selected from patients
who had documented history of allergies to mold and/or pollen and/or skin
prick tested. Information on the skin test allergen extracts (crude or purified)
was not documented. Non-atopic patients were clinically known non-
allergenic or total IgE <130 ng/mL or 54 IU/mL (2.4 ng = 1 IU). Testing was
performed on 145 samples for Sunflower Seed; 144 samples for Aspergillus
niger; 166 samples for Cephalosporium acremonium; 160 samples for Poplar;
155 samples for Careless Weed and 158 samples for Saltbush. Based on
