I. Device Description:
The BD Vacutainer® Rapid Serum Tube Plus Blood Collection Tube (BD RST) a 13 x 100
mm, 4.0 mL, plastic evacuated tube with an orange conventional stopper. The interior of the
tube wall is coated with thrombin to promote rapid clotting. The tube contains a gel barrier
polymer at the tube bottom. The density of this material causes it to move upward during
centrifugation to the serum-clot interface, where it forms a barrier separating serum from the
clot. Serum may be aspirated directly from the collection tube, eliminating the need to
transfer to another container. The tube interior is sterile and the product is for single use
only.

L. Test Principle:
The BD Vacutainer® Rapid Serum Tube (RST) is intended to be placed inside either a holder
or an adapter of a blood collection system. Once the vein of the patient has been penetrated
using a standard needle, the tube is pushed fully into the needle holder so that the non-
patient’s end of the needle pierces the rubber septum of the stopper of the tube. The tube uses
a controlled vacuum to pull a specific volume of blood into the sterile interior of the tube.
The pressure differential caused the venous blood to flow into the tube. Once pressure is
equalized, the blood flow ceases and the tube is withdrawn from the needle holder or needle.
After blood has been drawn, the tube shall be immediately inverted gently for 5 to 6 times to
mix the blood with the additives, and then allowed to clot and stand for 5 minutes. Once
clotting is complete, the tube is to be centrifuged for 10 minutes, at a minimum g force of
1500g to initiate movement of gel and to obtain separation of serum.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision/repeatability studies were performed using fifty-three apparently healthy
subjects in an internal testing site. Each subject has a venous blood collection into six
blood collection tubes: 3 BD SST tubes (predicate device) with three different lot
numbers and 3 BD RST tubes (candidate device) with three different lot numbers.
Each tube was tested in duplicates for each of the 12 analytes and on multiple different
instrument platforms. Results are summarized in the tables below:
Table 1 through Table 6 give the estimates from the variance components analysis for
the BD RST tube type: the within-tube, within-lot, between-lot and total coefficient of
variation (%CV) or standard deviation (SD) along with 95% confidence limits.

Results of the predicate tube type, BD SST, were very similar to the candidate tube type,
BD RST. Calculated SD for the BD SST tube was <1 U/L for ALT and <0.6 mg/dL for
T.Bili. and % CVs for all other analytes are <10% .
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Real Time stability testing of the BD Rapid Serum Tubes showed that the tube is stable
for 12 months when stored at 4o to 25oC.
To demonstrate analyte stability in the BD RST tubes at room temperature, analyte
stability studies were performed at 0 hrs and 24 hrs after collecting blood into the BD
RST and SST tubes. Studies are summarized below:
1. Study 1: 35 apparently healthy adults were enrolled internally at the manufacturer
facility. Testing was performed internally on-site and at a reference laboratory.

A. 31 analytes (ALB, ALK, ALT, AST, Amy, BUN, Ca, Chol, Cl, CK, CO2, Creat,
DBIL, Fe, Ferritin, GGT, Gluc, HDL, K, LD, LDL, Lip, Mg, Na, Phos, TBIL,
TP, Transferrin, TRIG, UA, UIBC) were tested on the Roche Cobas Integra
800.
B. 12 analytes (Cortisol, Ferritin, Folate, FSH, Free T3, Free T4, LH, TSH,
Testosterone, Total T3, Total T4, and Vitamin B12) were tested on the Bayer
ADVIA Centaur.
2. Study 2: 84 adult subjects (43 for cardiac marker and 41 for female hormone) were
recruited and tested in a hospital in New York. 6 analytes (hCG, Estradiol,
Progesterone, CKMB, Myoglobin, and Troponin I) were tested on the Beckman
Coulter Access 2.
3. Study 3: 78 adult patients were enrolled in an external hospital. A total of 8 analytes
were tested. C3, C4, CRP, IgG, IgM, and RF were tested on Beckman Coulter
UniCel DxC 800 analyzer. Anti-CMV IgG and Anti-CMV IgM were tested on the
Biomerieux VIDAS analyzer.
4. Study 4: 42 healthy adult patients were tested internally for LDL, Triglycerides, and
Rheumatoid factor for additional time-points stability study. Testing was
performed at 0, 6, 12 and 24 hours after blood have been collected and separated
from the centrifuge.
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed that the BD RST tubes have
analyte stability for 24 hours at room temperature except for LDL (19 hours) and
triglycerides (5 hours). This information is provided in the sponsor’s package insert.
Acceptance criteria for analyte stability on a representative platform was provided and found to
be acceptable.

--- Page 9 ---
To demonstrate comparable performance with the predicate device, apparently healthy
subjects and patients admitted into hospitals with various diseases were used. Testing
was performed both internally and externally at 4 different clinical sites. All subjects in
the comparative studies have blood samples collected into the BD RST (candidate
device) and the BD SST (predicate tubes) at the same time. The specimens were allowed
to clot, and the serum was removed for testing immediately after centrifugation according
to the instructions provided in the labeling. Evaluations were performed on a selective
common chemistry analytes, immunology analytes, and serological analytes on certain
instrument platforms. A total of fifty-seven analytes were evaluated and demonstrated
comparable results between the BD RST tubes and the BD SST tubes. A small number
of spiked samples were used to supplement the analyte ranges. Summary of the results of
one representative study on one representative platform with the analytes and instruments
evaluated are provided in the tables below:

Study 4: 84 adults’ subjects (43 for cardiac marker and 41 for female hormone) were
recruited and tested in a hospital setting. Testing was performed in that hospital
laboratory. Chemistry results were generated for 3 female hormones on a Beckman
Coulter Access 2 instrument and an Ortho clinical Diagnostics VITROS ECi instrument.
3 cardiac markers results were generated on a Beckman Coulter Access 2 instrument and
on an Abbott Axsym instrument.
Study 5: 86 adults’ subjects were enrolled in a hospital setting with various diagnoses and
disease states to cover a wide range for the analytes to be tested. 10 chemistry analytes
(ALT, calcium, creatinine, glucose, potassium, LDL cholesterol, magnesium,
phosphorus, total bilirubin, and total protein) were tested on the Roche Modular analyzer.
Study 6: 78 adults’ subjects were enrolled in a hospital setting with various diagnoses and
disease states to cover a wide range for the analytes to be tested. Two serological
analytes (anti-CNV IgG and IgM) were tested on the BioMerieux and Dynex DS2
analyzers. Two immunoassay analytes (TSH and Troponin) were tested on the Abbott
Axsym and Beckman Access analyzers. Six immunological analytes (C3, C4, CRP, IgG,
IgM, and RF) were tested on the Beckman UniCel DxC 800 analyzer.
Study 7: 82 adults’ subjects were enrolled in a hospital setting and 19 adults’ subjects
were enrolled in a different hospital setting with various diagnoses and disease states to
cover a wide range for the analytes to be tested. Six immunological analytes and 10
general chemistry analytes were tested on the Ortho-Diagnostics Vitros analyzer.
