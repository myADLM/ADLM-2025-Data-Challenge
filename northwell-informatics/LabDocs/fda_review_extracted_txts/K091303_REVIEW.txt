The use of quality control materials is indicated as an objective assessment of the
precision of methods and techniques in use and is an integral part of good laboratory
practices. Three levels of control are available to allow monitoring of performance.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Each level of control was tested two times per day, in duplicate, for 20 days as
outlined in the CSLI EP5-A2 guideline. The total precision standard deviations
for Liquichek Hematology-16 Control LV (Table 1) were compared to the
instrument manufacturer precision standard deviation (Table 2) and the statistical
p-values were calculated utilizing a chi-square test. The observed differences
between the study precision results and the instrument manufacturer precision
claims are considered statistically significant when the p-values are < 0.05. The
p-values obtained from this study are > 0.05 (Table 3), which indicates that the
observed differences are not statistically significant.

stability for the Liquichek Hematology-16 Control LV. Two lots of data are
provided for each study. These studies are performed in such a manner as to
mimic the handling of product in the customer’s hands following opening of
these products and their preparation for use. The open vial study time is
typically defined to be at least 20% longer than the claimed open vial stability
for the product and tested at least at four time points: at the beginning at the
end and two time points during the middle of the study (T-zero, T- M1, T-M2
and T-Final + 20%). The acceptance criterion is generally defined as the T-
Final + 20% being within the expected ranges.
Open Vial Stability: All parameters are stable for 21 days when stored at 2°-
8°C.
Shelf life stability: All parameters are stable for 160 days at 2 -8° C.
The review of the data was within acceptable limits.
Value Assignment: The mean values printed in the Liquichek Hematology-16
Control LV package insert are derived from replicate analyses and are specific
for each lot of product. The tests listed are performed by manufacturer or
independent laboratories using a representative sampling of each product.
Laboratory results may vary from the listed values. Variations over time and
between laboratories may be caused by differences in laboratory technique,
instrumentation calibrating methods, reagents or by any stated limitations for
this product. It is recommended that each laboratory establish its own means
and acceptable ranges with each lot of Liquichek Hematology-16 Control LV.
