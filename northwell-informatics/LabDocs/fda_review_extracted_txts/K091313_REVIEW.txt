E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The XT-4000i is the same as the XT-2000i which is part of the XT-Series and has
a body Fluid mode the same as the XE-5000. It is an automated hematology
analyzer which consists of four principle units: (1) Main Unit which aspirates,
dilutes, mixes, and analyzes whole blood and body fluid samples; (2) Sampler
Unit which supplies samples to the Main Unit automatically; (3) IPU (Information
Processing Unit) which processes data from the Main Unit and provides the
operator interface with the system; (4) Pneumatic Unit which supplies pressure
and vacuum from the Main Unit.
The Body Fluid (BF) analysis mode of the XT-4000i uses the 4DIFF scattergram
and the RBC distribution obtained from a specialized analysis sequence to
calculate and display the WBC (WBC-BF) counts, mononuclear cell (MN) /
polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) counts and percentages, TC-BF (Total Count) &
RBC (RBC-BF) counts found in the body fluid.
2. Principles of Operation:
Performs hematology analyses according to the Hydro Dynamic Focusing (DC
Detection), flow cytometry method (using a semiconductor laser), and SLS-
hemoglobin method.
3. Modes of Operation:
(1) Manual Mode: the caps of the sample tubes are manually removed and each
sample is aspirated via the whole blood aspiration pipette.
(2) Sampler Mode: The sampler automatically mixes, aspirates and analyzes
samples without removing their caps. Up to 50 samples can be loaded at a time
and analyzed automatically.
(3) Manual Closed Mode: The sampler is used to aspirate the sample without
opening the cap of the sample tube. This mode is basically the same as the
manual mode; mixing and continuous analysis cannot be performed
1

--- Page 2 ---
automatically.
(4) Capillary Mode: an analysis is performed after diluting the sampe to 1:5 ratio.
This mode is used in analyzing a minute amount of blood collected from the
earlobe or fingertip. The method used to aspirate the sample is the same as that
used in manual and body fluid modes.
(5) Body Fluid Mode: The body fluid mode is used exclusively for measuring the
number of blood cells contained in body fluid. Sample aspiration is performed in
the same method as for the manual mode.
4. Specimen Identification:
Specimen information is managed by four menu lists and specimen identification
input is manual (operator entered) or by barcode reader.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimens are processed manually.
6. Calibration:
Calibration is carried out by entering calibration values into the unit. This
calibration is performed for the WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, PLT and PLT-O
parameters. WBC Diff parameters are factory calibrated prior to shipment and
verified by Sysmex technical representative on installation. The instrument does
not need to be calibrated in the laboratory.

1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy:
Accuracy studies were performed on 389 samples at three sites and run on the
XE-5000 and the XT-4000i for the WBC-BF, RBC-BF, TC-BF, MN%/# and
PMN%/# parameters. Unselected residual body fluid specimens were
collected and consisted of 100 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), 70 synovial fluid, 85
pleural fluid and 134 peritoneal fluid specimens. Each body fluid specimen
was run once on the XE-5000 and then the XT-4000i according to CLSI
EP09-A2.
Conclusion: Method comparison testing for all parameters met manufacturer’s
specifications. Regression analysis demonstrated that WBC-BF, RBC-BF,
TC-BF, MN# and PMN# slopes were within 1.01 – 1.05, intercepts were
within -0.01 – 0.01, and correlation coefficients >0.990. MN% and PMN%
slopes were within 0.98 – 0.99, intercepts were within -1.1 – 2.6, and
correlation coefficients >0.93.

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability Testing
Residual body fluids that covered the whole measuring range for each of the body
fluid types for the WBC-BF, RBC-BF and TC-BF parameters were assayed 10
consecutive times at the upper and lower range. The mean, standard deviation
and coefficient variance were calculated. Specimen with clots or that had
insufficient volume were rejected. The specimens were comprised of CSF (N=4),
Synovial fluid (N=4), Pleural fluid (N=5) and Peritoneal fluid (N=4) specimens.
Each body fluid specimen was run 10 consecutive times on the XT-4000i. Studies
were performed in accordance with CLSI EP10-A3, Preliminary Evaluation of
Quantitative Clinical Laboratory Measurement Procedures; Approved Guideline
3rd Edition. Acceptance criteria for each parameter are listed in the tables below

c. Linearity:
Linearity testing was performed at two sites, using serial dilutions of body fluid
samples made to represent the full range of linearity. The expected values were
plotted against obtained results and both low and high values were calculated.
Specimens that represented the high end of the reportable range and had sufficient
volume were selected for testing. Specimens with clots or insufficient volume
were rejected. For WBC-BF, RBC-BF, TC-BF, the following specimen types
were included in the study: CSF (N=2), Synovial fluid (N=3), Pleural fluid (N=2)

d. Carryover:
Body fluid counts (WBC, RBC and TC) with High to Low carryover were
measured at two sites. Three (3) body fluid samples with a high cell count were
analyzed three consecutive times (H1, H2, H3) followed immediately by testing a
sample with a low cell count consecutively three times (L1, L2, L3) for each body
fluid type. Specimens that represented the high and low end of the reportable
range and had sufficient volume were selected. Specimen with clots or had
insufficient volume were rejected. Carryover studies were performed using the
following specimen types: CSF (N=3), Synovial fluid (N=3), Pleural fluid (N=2)
and Peritoneal fluid (N=1).
The studies indicate that the device met the manufacturer’s acceptance criteria for
each parameter as listed below.
WBC-BF: <0.3%, or 0.001 x103/uL
RBC-BF: <0.3%, or 0.003 x106/uL
TC-BF#: <0.3%, or 0.001 x103/uL
e. Interfering Substances:
The sponsor provided reference publications to support claims of interfering
substances. Fat globules, crystals and high viscous synovial fluids may cause
erroneous or misleading results. (Source: Kjeldsberg C. and Knight J. Body
Fluids: Laboratory Examination of Cerebrospinal, Seminal, Serous &
Synovial Fluids. 3rd Ed. Chicago, IL: ASCP Press, 1993. Pages 266-270.)
2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
Limit of Blank
The instrument diluent (Cellpack) was used as a blank and run 60 consecutive
times in the body fluid analysis mode. Samples with target concentrations were
run 60 consecutive times. Limits of Blank (LoB) and Limits of Detection (LoD)
were determined using a protocol based on CLSI EP17-A. Specimens containing
clots or insufficient volume were rejected. The LoB studies were performed with
the following specimen types: CSF fluids (N=3), Synovial (N=3), Serous fluid
(N=3). Sixty replicates were tested for each LoB and LoD at a single site.
The Mean, SD and LoB were calculated from the WBC-BF, TC-BF, RBC-BF,
MN# and PMN# results. The LoB was calculated as: LoB = Mean + (1.645 x
SD). Results for LoB studies are found in the table below.

Limit of Detection and Limit of Quantitation
The data in the Limit of Detection (LoD) table was obtained from running
samples with the target WBC-BF and TC-BF values of 3, 5 and 10 cells/µL and
target RBC-BF values of 2 and 5 cells x 10³/µL, MN# target values of 1 and 5
cells/µL and PMN# target values of 3 and 5 cells/µL. Specimens were analyzed
60 consecutive times in the Body Fluid Mode. The Mean, SD and limit of
detection were calculated from the WBC-BF, TC-BF, RBC-BF, MN# and PMN#
results. The limit of detection was calculated as: LoD=LoB + (1.645 x SD). The
estimate of bias and imprecision was determined using the mean and standard
deviation results from the LoD study. The estimate of total error was less than
the manufacturer’s goal of 5 cells/µL for the WBC-BF, TC-BF, RBC-BF, MN#
and PMN# and therefore the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) is equal to the LoD.
