L. Test Principle:
The Tosoh AIA-PACK RBC folate is a competitive enzyme immunoassay which, after
sample hemolysis and sample pretreatment, is performed entirely within the AIA-PACK.
First, sample hemolysis is performed to achieve complete hemolysis of erythrocytes and
deconjugation to monoglutamate in the whole blood sample using sample hemolyzing
reagents (containing ascorbic acid). After sample hemolysis, sample pretreatment is
performed to release folate from endogenous binding proteins in the hemolysate sample
using sample pretreatment reagents (containing sodium hydroxide and dithiothreitol).
Folate present in the pretreated test sample competes with enzyme-labeled folate for a limited
number of binding sites on a fluorescein labeled bovine folate binding protein which then
binds to anti-FITC antibody immobilized on magnetic beads. The beads are washed to
remove the unbound enzyme-labeled folate and are then incubated with a fluorogenic
substrate, 4-methylumbeliferyl phosphate (4MUP). The amount of enzyme labeled folate
that binds to the beads is inversely proportional to the folate concentration in the test sample.
A standard curve using a range of known standard concentrations is constructed and
unknown folate concentrations are calculated using this curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All the performance characteristics were performed using the TOSOH AIA-1800
analyzer.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were evaluated using CLSI EP5-A2 as a guideline. The sponsor
conducted within-run precision and total precision with one human whole blood
sample (EDTA) and three commercially available whole blood controls. All samples
were tested twice daily, in duplicate over 20 days (n=80). Results of the precision
studies are shown below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies were evaluated using the CLSI EP6-A as a guideline. A low and a
high folate sample were prepared by adding a spiking solution containing folate to
achieve the target folate concentrations (0.43 and 43 ng/mL). Inter-dilutions of the
low and high samples were used to prepare nine levels of folate samples for the
linearity study. All samples were tested in triplicate on the AIA-18000 analyzer. The
recovered folate values were plotted against the expected values and an appropriate
line fitted by standard linear regression was performed. The percent recovery of all
the samples ranged from 97.5% to 104.8%. The linear equation generated is
Y=1.0062X + 0.0342 with regression coefficient (R2) of 0.999. The results of the
study support the sponsor’s claim that the assay is linear from 0.62 to 24.0 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: There is no reference material available for traceability.
The AIA-PACK RBC folate calibrator set contains 6 levels of different
concentrations of folate, which are prepared gravimetrically and compared to an
internal standard material.
The folate calibrator has a shelf-life stability of 12 months when stored at 2-8oC and an
open-vial stability of 1 day when stored at 2-8oC.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor determined the Detection limits according to the CLSI EP 17-A
guideline. The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined by assaying one blank
sample 60 times and six low samples in replicates of ten. The Limit of Quantitation
(LoQ) was determined by assaying 10 low samples 10 times each with a target CV of
20%. The sponsor determined that the LoB for folate is 0.19 ng/mL, LoD is 0.43
ng/mL and the LoQ is 0.62 ng/mL.
The AIA-PACK folate assay has a linearity range of 0.62 to 24.0 ng/mL.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were evaluated according to the CLSI EP7-A2 guideline. Two
controls and two whole blood samples (EDTA) were spiked with increasing amounts
of the potential interferants. The spiked samples and unspiked samples were assayed
in triplicate and the mean concentration was used to calculate the recovery. The
sponsor defined non-interference as <10% deviation from the un-spiked samples.
Based on the data, the sponsor claims no interference for the substances and
concentrations listed in the table below:
Substance Concentration
Ascorbic acid 20 mg/dL
Bilirubin (uncojugated): 18 mg/dL
Bilirubin (conjugated): 19 mg/dL
EDTA 10 mg/mL
Heparin 100 U/mL
Hemoglobin 470 mg/dL
Lipemia (triglyceride): 1600 mg/dL
Rheumatoid factor 500 IU/mL
Trisodium citrate 20 mg/mL
Cross-reactivity: Two drugs, Amethopterin and Leucovorin, were evaluated for
potential cross-reactivity similar to the interference study protocol evaluated above.
The sponsor defined no cross-reactivity as <2% deviation from the un-spiked
samples. Based on the data, the sponsor claims no cross-reactivity for the substances
and concentrations listed in the table below:
Substance Concentration
Amethopterin 2,518 ng/mL
Leucovorin 5,231 ng/mL

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A comparison study was performed between the AIA-PACK folate assay (candidate
method) and the ADVIA Centaur® FOL Lite Reagent assay (predicate method)
according to the CLSI EP9-A2 guideline. 101 whole blood (EDTA) samples were
assayed on the AIA-1800 analyzer and the ADVIA Centaur analyzer. Hemolysis and
pre-treatment of the samples were carried out according to each manufacturer’s

instruction. Dilution correction and hemocrit factors were used with the folate results
to calculate the final RBC folate results:
RBC folate = (Hemolysate folate value (ng/mL)) × dilution factor × 100
Hematocrit (%)
The final calculated RBC folate results ranged from 185 to 1333 ng/mL. The resulting
Deming regression equation is Y = 1.00X – 26.60 with a correlation coefficient (R) of
0.86.
b. Matrix comparison:
Fifty paired EDTA and heparin whole blood samples spanning the folate range were
assayed on the TOSOH AIA- 1800 analyzer. The final calculated RBC folate results
ranged from 151.6 to 1404.7 ng/mL. The resulting Deming regression equation is Y =
0.955X – 9.144 with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.99.
The sponsor concluded that heparin is an acceptable anticoagulan for this assay.
