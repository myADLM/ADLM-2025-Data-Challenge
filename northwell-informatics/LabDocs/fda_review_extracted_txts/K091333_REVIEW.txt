L. Test Principle:
The single-use LDL reagent plastic container is composed of a bi-reagent cartridge
holding two stable reagents, a reaction cavity, and a bar code label. The test is based
on a photometric measurement of the amount of LDL present after other non-LDL
cholesterol is solubilized by a detergent and then consumed by cholesterol esterase
and cholesterol oxidase in a non-color forming reaction. LDL is then solubilized by a
second detergent in the presence of a chromogenic peroxidase substrate to form a
purple-red color. The amount of color formed, determined by measuring the increase
in absorbance bichromatically at 546/660 nm on the S40 Clinical Analyzer, is directly
proportional to the LDL cholesterol concentration.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Commercial linearity standards at 11 different levels with values ranging from
11 to 396 mg/dL were used to determine linearity across the assay range. The
mean value of each set of quadruplicate determinations was determined.
Percent recoveries ranged from 90-102%. The linear regression equation
obtained for the study was y = 1.011x – 4.25, r2 = 0.9996.
The LDL assay reportable range using the S-Test LDL Cholesterol reagent
cartridge on the S40 Clinical Analyzer is 11 to 396 mg/dL. If a sample is less
than 11 mg/dL, the result is flagged by the analyzer as < 11 mg/dL-Range. If
a sample result exceeds 396 mg/dL, the result is flagged by the analyzer as >
396 mg/dL-Range.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Each lot of S-Test LDL Cholesterol reagent cartridges is factory calibrated
and traceable to the β-Quantification Reference Method. The 2-D barcode
printed on each cartridge provides the S-40 Clinical Analyzer with lot-specific
calibration data. This method has not been tested or certified by the
Cholesterol Reference Method Laboratory Network.
Stability of reagent cartridges was determined at 2-10°C using real-time
studies. Accuracy and precision data substantiate the stability claim of 12
months when stored at 2-8°C.

The limit of detection was determined by assaying five low samples (serum
samples) and five true blanks (human serum albumin in saline). Testing was
carried out over three days on two S40 Clinical Analyzers. Both, the low
samples and true blanks, were run every day for a total of replicates n=60.
The limit of detection was determined to be 1 mg/dL. The assay reportable
range is 11 to 396 mg/dL on the S40 Clinical Analyzer. If a sample is less
than 11 mg/dL, the result is flagged by the analyzer as < 11 mg/dL-Range.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies to determine the effect of Ascorbic Acid, Unconjugated
Bilirubin, Hemolysis, and Triglycerides were performed. Serum pools
containing normal and abnormal LDL cholesterol were spiked with various
concentrations of ascorbic acid, unconjugated bilirubin, and hemoglobin as
described in table below.
Interference Normal LDL-C Abnormal LDL-C
(mg/L) (mg/L)
Ascorbic Acid 39 140
(serum: 1.6 – 50 mg/dL)
Unconjugated Bilirubin 120 142
(serum: 1.6 – 50 mg/dL)
Hemoglobin 120 142
(serum: 31 – 1000 mg/dL).
Triglycerides (300 – 1170 mg/dL) were evaluated using four lipemic serum
samples. All samples were tested in triplicate on the S40 Clinical Analyzer.
Results from interference studies are described in the device labeling as
follows. Ascorbic Acid and Bilirubin showed no significant interference at
the tested conditions. No significant interference from hemolysis was
detected for the normal sample. Hemoglobin concentrations greater than 500
mg/dL may cause interference. Negative interference occurred at 1000 mg/dL
on the abnormal sample. Triglycerides showed no significant interference
below 589 mg/dL. Triglyceride concentrations greater than 589 mg/dL may
cause interference. Negative interference occurred at 1170 mg/dL
triglycerides.
