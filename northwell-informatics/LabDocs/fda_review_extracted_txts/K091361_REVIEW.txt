L. Test Principle:
Immulite 2000 Syphilis Screen is a solid-phase, one-step chemiluminescent
enzyme immunoassay. The solid phase (beads) is coated with purified
recombinant Treponema pallidum p17 (Tp17) antigen. The liquid phase
consists of alkaline phosphatase (bovine calf intestine) conjugated to
purified recombinant Treponema pallidum p17 (Tp17) antigen.
Patient sample and the reagent are incubated together with the coated beads
for 30 minutes. During this time, total antibody to Treponema pallidum in
the sample forms the antigen sandwich complex with purified recombinant
Treponema pallidum p17 (Tp17) antigen on the bead and enzyme
conjugated purified recombinant Treponema pallidum p17 (Tp17) antigen
in the reagent. Unbound patient sample and enzyme conjugate are then
removed by centrifugal washes. Finally, chemiluminescent substrate is
added to the reaction tube containing the bead and the signal is generated in
proportion to the bound enzyme.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing was performed using two different reagent lots at
all testing sites for five days, twice each day. There were 4 replicates of
each sample, quality control materials that are routinely provided with
the kit (positive / negative controls) and 5 endogenous samples (low
negative, high negative, low positive, high positive, and a sample around
the cutoff) from pooled serum. Additionally, the assay adjustor was run
as an unknown. This resulted in a yield of 40 replicates of each sample
per lot at each site. Reproducibility of the Immulite syphilis screen as
measured by between-site CV ranged from 7.1 % to 22.6% for Lot 1 and
from 6.1% to 29.7% for Lot 2.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
Not applicable.
d. Detection limit:
The Master Cutoff of the assay was determined from representative
samples to achieve optimal sensitivity and specificity for the assay. The
cutoff is set equal to the average counts per second of the Adjustor
multiplied by the Curve Parameter 1. The result for a sample is reported
as “Reactive” if the sample’s counts are above the indeterminate range,
and “Nonreactive” if below this range. The result is reported as
“Indeterminate” if the counts per sec. for that sample fall within + 10%
of the cut off.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference Study: Interference testing was conducted using serum and
plasma per CLSI EP7A, Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry. The
following results were obtained:
o Hemoglobin: No effect was observed up to 592.6 mg/dL of
hemoglobin;
o Bilirubin: no effect was observed up to 20 mg/dL of
conjugated or unconjugated bilirubin;
o Triglycerides: No effect was observed up to 3000 mg/dL of
triglycerides.
Cross-Reactivity Study: To test for possible cross-reactivity, multiple
patient samples containing different concentrations of potentially cross-
reactive antibodies were analyzed with the Immulite 2000 Syphilis
Screen test.

There were two samples that were nonreactive with the Immulite 2000
assay but positive with the predicate assay. These samples were
further tested with another Treponema Assay and both were negative
by this assay.

Alternate Sample Types
In order to assess the effect of alternate sample types, blood was
collected from 88 volunteers into plain, heparin, EDTA and Becton
Dickinson SST® Vacutainer tubes. Forty eight of 88 samples were
spiked with antibodies positive to T. pallidum to obtain positive and
cut-off levels. All samples were assayed by the Immulite 2000
Syphilis Screen assay. The results were subjected to linear regression
analysis.
