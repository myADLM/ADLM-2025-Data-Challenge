L. Test Principle:
Cholesterol
The cholesterol in the sample is classified into cholesterol esters and free
cholesterol. The cholesterol esters become free cholesterol through the action
of cholesterol esterase (CE).
The free cholesterol is oxidized by cholesterol oxidase (COD) to produce
hydrogen peroxide, esters and free cholesterol. The cholesterol esters become
free cholesterol through the action of cholesterol esterase (CE).
The hydrogen peroxide oxidizes and condenses 4-aminoaminoantipyrine and
N-ethyl-N-sulfobutyl-m-toluidine (ESBmT) under the influence of peroxidase
(POD) to produce a reddish-purple pigment.
Total cholesterol concentration is determined by measuring the absorbance of
this reddish-purple pigment. The difference in absorbance, monitored
bichromatically at 600 nm/800 nm is directly proportional to the cholesterol
concentration in the sample.
HDL Cholesterol
By using a special surface-active agent that preferentially solubilizes HDL and
not other lipoproteins (LDL, VLDL, and chylomicrons), the HDL cholesterol
8

--- Page 9 ---
is measured via a quickly initiated enzymatic reaction. Therefore, only HDL
cholesterol is specifically measured.
The hydrogen peroxide oxidizes and condenses 4-aminoaminoantipyrine and
N,N'-bis(4-sulfobutyl)-m-toluidine disodium salt (DSBmT) in the presence of
peroxidase (POD) to produce a reddish-purple pigment.
HDL cholesterol concentration is determined by measuring the absorbance of
this reddish-purple pigment. The difference in absorbance, monitored
bichromatically at 600 nm/700 nm is directly proportional to the HDL
concentration in the sample.
Triglyceride
Free glycerol in the sample is converted to glycerol-3-phosphoric acid through
the action of glycerol kinase (GK) and the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
substrate. Glycerol-3-phosphoric acid is converted to hydrogen peroxide via
the action of glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase (GPO); peroxide is then
decomposed into water and oxygen via the action of catalase.
The neutral fat in the sample is quickly hydrolyzed into glycerol and fatty acid
by the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) contained in the second reagent.
The glycerol product is converted to glycerol-3-phosphoric acid via the action
of GK and the ATP substrate which in turn produces hydrogen peroxide via
the action of GPO. The hydrogen peroxide oxidizes/condenses 4-
aminoantipyrine and N-ethyl-N-sulfobutyl-m-toluidine (ESBmT), via the
action of peroxidase (POD) to produce a reddish purple pigment. The original
neutral fat concentration (triglyceride) is determined by measuring the
absorbance of the reddish purple pigment produced.
The difference in absorbance between the final reading and the blank,
monitored bichromatically at 600 nm/800 nm, is directly proportional to the
triglyceride concentration in the sample.

Commercial linearity standards were assayed to test that results obtained
across the measuring range were linear. The mean value of each set of
quadruplicate determinations was determined.
Cholesterol
Percent recoveries ranged from 98% – 100% when testing samples from 2 –
370 mg/dL. The linear regression equation obtained for the study was y =
1.005x – 3.00, r2 = 0.9995. The claimed measuring range is 7 – 370 mg/dL.
HDL Cholesterol
Percent recoveries ranged from 100% – 103% when testing samples from 14 –
140 mg/dL. The linear regression equation obtained for the study was y =
1.002x + 0.70, r2 = 0.9993. The claimed measuring range is 14 – 125 mg/dL.
Triglyceride
Percent recoveries ranged from 95% – 100% when testing samples from 13 –
746 mg/dL. The linear regression equation obtained for the study was y =

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Cholesterol - Each lot is calibrated by the manufacturer prior to shipment
using material traceable to NIST Standard Reference Material 911.
HDL Cholesterol and Triglyceride - Each lot is calibrated by the manufacturer
prior to shipment using material traceable to Reference Material Institute for
Clinical Chemistry Standards JCCRM223
The 2-D barcode printed on each cartridge provides the S-40 Clinical
Analyzer with lot-specific calibration data.
These methods for cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride have not
been tested or certified by the Cholesterol Reference Method Laboratory
Network (CRMLN). This information about the CRMLN certification is
stated in the labeling.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection was determined by assaying five low samples (serum
samples) and five true blanks (human serum albumin in saline). Testing was
carried out over three days on two S40 Clinical Analyzers. Serum samples
and true blanks were assayed every day for a total of 60 measurements. The
limit of detection was determined to be 7 mg/dL for cholesterol, 6 mg/dL for
HDL cholesterol, and 12 mg/dL for triglyceride.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor investigated the possibility of interference from ascorbic acid,
unconjugated bilirubin, hemolysis, and lipemia. The concentrations of

The sponsor defined interference as a change greater than 10% or the lowest
reportable concentration of the assay. Based on these criteria, the sponsor
states the following in the package inserts:
Cholesterol:
No significant interference from ascorbic acid, unconjugated bilirubin,
hemolysis, or lipemia.
HDL Cholesterol:
Ascorbic Acid: No significant interference below 25 mg/dL. Ascorbic acid
concentrations greater than 25 mg/dL may cause interference. Negative
interference (>10%) occurred at 50 mg/dL.
