PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY (HPLC) OR LIQUID
CHROMATOGRAPHY / TANDEM MASS SPECTROMETRY (LC/MS/MS)
ARE THE PREFERRED CONFIRMATORY METHODS. CLINICAL
CONSIDERATION AND PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT SHOULD BE
APPLIED TO ANY DRUG OF ABUSE TEST RESULT, PARTICULARLY
WHEN PRELIMINARY POSITIVE RESULTS ARE OBTAINED.
The MEDTOXScan® Reader includes a Positive QC Test Device, a Negative QC
Test Device and a Cleaning Cassette. The MEDTOXScan ® Positive and Negative
QC Test Devices are intended to detect errors associated with the MEDTOXScan®
Reader and a contaminated contact imaging sensor (CIS), and to verify that the CIS
cleaning procedure using the MEDTOXScan® Cleaning Cassette effectively
removed any contamination.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The device is for in vitro diagnostic prescription use.
The assay is not designated for use in point-of-care settings.
The PROFILE®-V MEDTOXScan® Test Devices cannot be visually read.
The PROFILE®-V MEDTOXScan® Drugs of Abuse Test System provides only a
preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must
be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry (GC/MS), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or liquid
chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) are the preferred
confirmatory methods. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be
applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive

I. Device Description:
The PROFILE®-V MEDTOXScan® Drugs of Abuse Test System includes an
instrument and drugs of abuse cassettes that detect specific drugs in urine. The
PROFILE®-V MEDTOXScan® Test Device includes antibody-colloidal gold, drug-
conjugates and a control line. A test line will form when drug in the sample is below
the detection threshold (negative result). The MEDTOXScan® Reader scans the test
device and utilizes a contact imaging sensor (CIS) to capture relative line intensities.
Software algorithms and barcodes are used to identify the test device, the drug tests
associated with the test device and whether the presence or absence of a line is
associated with a negative or positive result, respectively.
The MEDTOXScan® Reader includes a Positive QC Test Device, a Negative QC Test
Device and a Cleaning Cassette. The MEDTOXScan® Positive and Negative QC Test.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
The sponsor references the following guidance document in their submission:
CLSI Guidance EP-12A User Protocol for the Evaluation of Qualitative Test
Performance.
L. Test Principle:
The PROFILE®-V MEDTOXScan® Drugs of Abuse Test System includes a
competitive, membrane-based immunochromatographic PROFILE®-V
MEDTOXScan® Test Device and the MEDTOXScan® Reader.
Antibody-Colloidal Gold: Mouse monoclonal antibodies bind to the drug being tested.
Drug-Conjugates: Each drug to be tested was individually conjugated to bovine serum
albumin (BSA) or IgG. Each drug conjugate is immobilized on a test line at a
designated position on the membrane strip.
Control Line: Each test strip has anti-mouse antibody immobilized at the Control (C)
position of the membrane strip. The anti-mouse antibody will bind excess antibody-
colloidal gold, indicating that the reagents are migrating properly. When the urine
sample is placed in the sample well of a test strip, the dried antibody-colloidal gold
under the sample pad dissolves and the urine wicks up the white strips carrying the
reddish-purple antibody-colloidal gold with it.
Negative Samples
When no drug(s) is present in the urine sample, the reddish purple antibody-colloidal
gold solutions migrate along the strip and bind to the respective drug conjugate(s)
immobilized on the membrane. Each strip has up to 4 drug test lines labeled T1 – T4.
The binding of the antibody-colloidal gold to the drug conjugate generates a line at the
corresponding test (T) position on the strip. The MEDTOXScan® Reader will scan
each test position and if a line is detected it will return “NEG” on the display screen (or
print out) next to the abbreviation for the drug test, indicating a negative result.
Positive Samples
When drug(s) is present in the urine sample the antibody-colloidal gold binds to the
drug(s) before it migrates along the strip. When the antibody colloidal gold binds to the
drug(s) in the urine, it cannot bind to the drug conjugate immobilized on the membrane
and no line is generated at the drug specific position in the result window. The
MEDTOXScan® Reader will scan each test position and if no line is detected it will
return “POS” on the display screen (or print out) next to the abbreviation for the drug
test, indicating a preliminary positive result.
Control Line (Valid or Invalid results)
Each test strip has an internal procedural control. A line must form at the Control (C)
5

--- Page 6 ---
position in the result window to indicate that sufficient sample was applied and that the
reagents are migrating properly. If a Control line does not form, the test is invalid. The
MEDTOXScan® Reader scans each control line and returns “VALID” to the right of
the drug test result to confirm that the control line was detected. If no control line is
detected it will return “INVALID” on the display screen next to the abbreviation for the
invalid drug test, and no result will be given for the drug test.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Urine stock solutions were prepared for each of the test compounds by spiking
standard solution of known concentrations into a commercially available
negative pool of urine (pH range of 6-7 and Specific Gravity range of 1.012 -
1.018). Each stock solution was assayed by GC/MS or LC/MS/MS. The 150%
cutoff sample was serially diluted to form the next lower level in the study. The
prepared diluted samples were re-checked additionally by GC/MS or
LC/MS/MS to confirm concentrations. A total of 45 results (3 readers x 3
aliquots for 5 days) were obtained for each level.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. This assay is intended for qualitative use.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Profile V quality control materials were previously cleared and are sold
separately. The sponsor specifies the quality control product in the “materials
required but not provided” section of the labeling.
No calibrators are required. The device is calibrated during the manufacturing
process.
d. Detection limit:
Sensitivity of qualitative assays may be characterized by validating performance
around the claimed cutoff concentration of the assay, and demonstrating the
lowest concentration of drug that is capable of or consistently producing a
positive result. This information appears in the precision section, 1.a., above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was established by spiking various concentrations of similarly
structured drug compounds into drug-free urine. The tables below summarize
the results of cross-reactivity studies using various common and structurally
similar compounds. Results are expressed as a minimum concentration of
metabolite or compound required to produce a response approximately
equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the assay. (or, if no cross-reactivity was
observed, then “none detected” is reported).
