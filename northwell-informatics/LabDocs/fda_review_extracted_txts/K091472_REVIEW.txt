K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI EP10-A2: “Preliminary Evaluation of Quantitative Clinical Laboratory Methods”
L. Test Principle:
Uritest 50 and Uritest 500 urine analyzers:
These analyzers are reflectance photometers that analyze the intensity and color of light
reflected from the reagent areas of a urinalysis reagent strip. Using a light emitting diode
(LED) as the light source and a photodiode as a light sensor, the optical system reads the
color change in the urine strips after a sample is applied.
Uritest 10 reagent strips:
For the detection of urobilinogen, the device employs a modified Ehrlich’s reaction.
Urobilinogen reacts with Ehrlich’s reagent to form a red-colored compound. Color changes
from light orange-pink to dark pink.
For the detection of glucose, the device employs glucose oxidase to catalyze the oxidation of
glucose to form hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide thus formed then oxidizes a
chromogen on the reaction pad by the action of peroxidase.
For the detection of bilirubin, bilirubin reacts with a dichlorobenzene diazonium salt in acid
media to produce a colored product vie an azo coupling. Bilirubin concentration is
proportional to the intensity or the resulting purple color.
The device uses Legal’s test-nitroprusside reaction for the detection of ketones. Acetoacetic
acid in an alkaline medium reacts with nitroferricyanide to produce a color change from
beige to purple.
The device uses a correlation between the concentration of ionic species and the sample’s
specific gravity to report an estimated specific gravity. Electrolyte (M+ X-) in the form of
salt in urine reacts with poly-methyl vinyl ether and maleic acid which is a weak acid ionic
exchanger. The reaction produces hydrogen ions which react with a pH indicator that causes
a color change.
To detect blood, the device exploits the pseudo-peroxidase activity of the haem moiety of
hemoglobin and myoglobin. A chromogen is oxidized by a hydroperoxide in the presence of
haem and produces a green color.
To qualitatively estimate protein concentration, the device uses the “error of indicators”
principle. Proteins interact with an ionizable electrolyte driving the release of protons which
in turn interact with a spectator indicator. The color change in the indicator is correlated with
the protein concentration.
The device detects nitrite through a reaction with an aromatic amino sulphanilamide
to form a diazonium compound. The diazonium compound reacting with tetrahydro
benzo(h)quinolin-3-phenol causes the color change.
One location on the strip contains an indoxyl ester and diazonium salt. Leukocytes contain an
esterase that hydrolyzes the indoxyl ester. The liberated compound reacts with the diazonium
salt on the strip to generate a purple compound. The concentration of leukocytes is correlated
with the production of a purple color.
The device used two indicators to measure pH in a broad range of urinary pHs.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor evaluated precision of the devices using a protocol based on the CLSI
EP10-A2, Preliminary Evaluation of Quantitative Clinical Laboratory Measurement
Procedures: Analysis of the data for imprecision. Two levels of control materials
(Bio-Rad Urinalysis Control, Level 1 and Level 2) were used to establish precision of
the assay. Precision was performed at three point of care sites, with one strip lot,
twice a day, for 20 non-consecutive days on both analyzers and by three operators for
a total of 240 measurements. The results are summarized in the following tables:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The company validated their claims for the concentration divisions by testing pooled,
negative urine spiked to specific target concentrations. Each concentration of analyte
was tested 20 times, across 3 lots of strips for a total of 60 measurements at each
concentration. The company used Uritest 50 and Uritest 500 Urine analyzers to
perform these measurements.
For glucose, the company challenged their device with samples spiked to 50, 80, and 100
mg/dL. Glucose concentrations were independently determined using a commercial test

d. Detection limit:
The sensitivity of the assay when read by Uritest 50 and Uritest 500 analyzers was
validated by spiking positive urine samples of known concentrations for each analyte
please see M.1.b. above). The minimum sensitivity level for each analyte of the
Uritest 10 strips when read by the Uritest 50 and Uritest 500 analyzers is defined by
the sponsor as the concentration at which at least 50% of the results are positive for
that concentration. These positive samples of each analyte were then diluted to the
lowest positive concentration on the Uritest color chart. Each urine sample was tested
with three lots of the Uritest 10 strips in 20 replicates. The results of each analyte
sensitivity pad are summarized in the table below:

The lower limits of detection for pH and SG are as follows:

e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor tested a variety of endogenous and exogenous compounds for interference in
negative and positive urine samples on the Uritest 50 analyzer. Fresh negative urine was
spiked with the analyte of interest and the interfering analyte. The following analytes at
the specified concentrations did not impact the results of the device:

The sponsor found that high levels of ketones (> 10 mgdL) and ascorbic acid (>8.8
mg/dL) would interfere with the measurements of glucose in urine using this device. The
sponsor noted this interference in their product insert.
The sponsor also noted that ascorbic acid at concentrations of 45 mg/dL or higher
interfered with the device’s detection of glucose, nitrate and bilirubin. Furthermore,
ascorbic acid at concentrations of 100 mg/dL or higher interfered with the device’s
detection of blood, pH, leukocytes, specific gravity, protein, urobilinogen and ketone.
Hemoglobin at concentrations of 50 mg/dL and higher interfered with the device’s
detection of blood. Glucose at concentrations of 2000 mg/dL or higher interfered with the
device’s detection of leukocytes. The sponsor noted those interferences in their product
insert.
A relationship is found between the Mesna concentration and the urinary test-strip
reaction. The uroprotective drug mesna (sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate) and other
free-sulfhydryl compounds produce false-positive results in ketone methods that are
based on the Legal reaction (alkaline sodium nitroprusside). The sponsor noted this
interference in the product insert.
f. Assay cut-off:
Please see the Detection Limit section 1.d. above
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The company performed a direct comparison using clinical samples at three point of care
sites. The company compared the performance of their devices (Uritest 50 and Uritest
500 with the Uritest 10 strips) to their predicate devices (Clinitek 50 and Clinitek 500
with the Uritest 10 strips). Each sample was measured by three operators per site, for a
total of 901 measurements. The company made measurements over 3 different
manufacturing lots of the Uritest 10 strips. The results of each analyte on all four
analyzers are summarized below:
