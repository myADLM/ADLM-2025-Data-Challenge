L. Test Principle:
To perform the test, Reagent 1 (R1) is added to the extraction tube, which is coated
with a mixture of conjugate antibodies and a lytic enzyme extraction reagent. The
lytic enzyme is mixed with colloidal gold conjugated to rabbit anti-Strep A and a
second colloidal gold control conjugate antibody. The reagents are dried onto the
bottom of an extraction tube forming a red spot. The extraction/conjugate pellet is
resuspended with R1 and the throat swab is added to the extraction tube. The Strep A
antigen is extracted from the sample and the swab is removed. The test strip is
immediately placed in the extracted sample. If Group A Streptococcus is present in
the sample, it will react with the anti-Strep A antibody conjugated to the gold particle.
The complex will then be bound by the anti-Strep A capture antibody and a visible
red test line will appear, indicating a positive result. To serve as an on-board
procedural control, the blue line observed at the control site prior to running the assay
will turn red, indicating that the test has been performed properly. If Strep A antigen
is not present or present at very low levels, only a red control line will appear. If the
red control line does not appear, or remains blue, the test result is invalid.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Binax, Inc. conducted a masked reproducibility study of the Clearview
Advanced™ Strep A test at three separate sites to demonstrate inter-site and
intra-site reproducibility of test results obtained by six trained lab technicians
Each technician was provided with masked coded panels and tested six
replicates of true negative samples (diluent only), moderate positive samples
(positive 100% of the time), Limit of Detection (LoD) samples (C
95
concentration, positive 95% of the time); and samples near the cut-off (C
50
concentration, positive 50% of the time) per day on 5 different days. Each
operator performed positive and negative control testing each day that sample
panels were tested. The results of the reproducibility study were as follows:

50
Concentration)
*2 invalid results excluded from the data analysis
Samples around the cut-off produce positive results sometimes and negative
results sometimes. This variability is not necessarily due to site or operator
disparities.
The specimens (samples) used to study variability consisted of a dilution
series prepared from a 1x109 organisms/mL stock of Streptococcus pyogenes.
10µl of solution at various concentrations were inoculated onto sterile foam
tipped swabs and dried for > 3 hours in a humidity-controlled environment.
Each swab was individually pouched and assembled into blind panels. LoD
studies were used to derive the sample concentrations tested.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Sample storage and transport media (Amies and Stuart media) studies were
conducted to support the storage conditions (time and temperature) of swabs
prior to testing, and to support use of swabs stored in various types of
transport media for testing in the Clearview Advanced Strep A assay Swabs
were inoculated at three concentrations of bacterial load, 5x108, 1x 105 and
1x104 organisms/test. Five swabs for each concentration per time point and
temperature were evaluated in the assay with and without transport media. For
blank swabs (no bacterial inoculation), two replicates were evaluated. All
results were interpreted by 2 operators.
The swabs were stored at either 4oC or 30oC and tested at 4 hours, 24 hours,
and 48 hours. Additionally, all swabs were tested immediately (within 15
minutes) of returning the swab to media or sheath. Positive and negative
controls were run on each day of testing and yielded expected results.
Results showed that all swabs not inoculated (no bacteria) tested negative in
the Clearview Advanced™ Strep A test while all positive swabs generated a
positive result. Thus tested media does not appear to interfere with the
Clearview Advanced™ Strep A test performance and is appropriate for
transport and storage of throat swab specimens intended for use with the
Clearview Advanced™ Strep A test. Expected results were obtained at all
temperatures and time points tested. The results indicate that Clearview
Advanced™ Strep A Test performance is not impacted by the storage
conditions tested in this study and recommended in the “Specimen Collection
and Handling” section of the package insert.
d. Detection limit:
A concentrated stock (1x109 organisms/mL) of inactivated Streptococcus
pyogenes (ATCC #19615) was spiked onto sterile foam swabs. Following
coating, the swabs were dried in humidity controlled conditions and then run
in the assay. Ten operators each interpreted two devices per dilution for 20
interpretations per dilution. The LoD of the Clearview Advanced Strep A test
was determined to be 1x104 organisms per test.

Interfering Substances
In this study, the sponsor measured and diluted each potentially interfering
substance and split into aliquots. One aliquot was spiked with S. pyogenes to
a final concentration of 2.5 x 104 organisms/test. The second aliquot
contained no bacteria. Sterile foam swabs were dipped into each aliquot and
allowed to absorb the liquid for up to 5 minutes prior to evaluation in the
Clearview Advanced™ Strep A test. All aliquots were run in triplicate in the
Clearview Advanced™ Strep A test. If interference was observed, testing was
repeated at a reduced concentration to determine the highest concentration at
which there was no interference. Positive and negative controls were run each
day of testing and yielded the expected results. The results were as follows:

4. Clinical cut-off:
N/A
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor states that approximately 15% of pharyngitis in children ages 3
months to 5 years is caused by Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus. In school-
aged children and adults, the incidence of Strep throat infection is about 40%.
This disease usually occurs in the winter and early spring in temperate climates.
Sponsor indicated that the expected range was established in the literature, and
provided copies of supporting references.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
