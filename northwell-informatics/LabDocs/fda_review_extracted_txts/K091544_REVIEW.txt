L. Test Principle:
LD in the sample catalyzes the conversion of L-lactate to pyruvate. Nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) acts as an acceptor for the hydrogen ions released from
the L-lactate substrate and is converted to reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NADH).
Lactic acid + NAD+ → pyruvic acid + NADH + H+
The rate of increase in absorbance, monitored bichromatically at 340/405 nm, is
directly proportional to the LD activity in the sample.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the LD assay on the S40 Clinical Analyzer was evaluated
using a method based on CLSI EP5-A2 at an external site. Three commercial
control samples with normal, intermediate and elevated levels of LD activity
were assayed on two S40 Clinical Analyzers two times per run, two runs per
day, for a total of 22 days. All three samples were tested on both analyzers.
Approximately 50% of the data was collected on each of the analyzers. The
mean, standard deviations (SD) and % coefficient of variation (CV) were
calculated for each sample. The results are summarized below:
Mean Within run Between run Between day Total

3 280 4.2 1.5 16.1 5.8 8.8 3.1 18.8 6.7
To establish the precision of the LD assay on the S40 Clinical Analyzer using
physical office lab (POL) personnel, three serum samples with normal,
intermediate and elevated levels of LD activity were assayed on four S40
Clinical Analyzers (one at each of three POLs and one in-house) three times
per run, one run per day, for a total of five days. The low sample was an
unaltered human serum pool. For the two higher levels, the serum samples
were spiked with LD from a commercial source. The mean, SD and % CV
were calculated for each sample. The results are summarized below:

The linearity of the LD assay on the S40 Clinical Analyzer was evaluated
using a method based on CLSI EP6-A. Commercial linearity standards with
known ratios of enzymatic activity for LD (11 level) were used. The assigned
value of the highest sample (11) was set to its mean value. The assigned
values of the other levels were calculated by multiplying the mean value by
the ratios obtained from the manufacturer of the standards.
The mean value of each set of quadruplicate measurements was calculated.
The % recovery was calculated for each sample. The results are summarized
below:
Assigned Value Measured Value
Sample % Recovery
(U/L LD) (U/L LD)
1 10 10 99 %
2 53 58 109 %
3 96 106 110 %
4 144 157 109 %
5 192 207 108 %
6 288 294 102 %
7 384 395 103 %

9 480 490 102 %
10 576 572 99 %
11 672 672 100 % (assigned)
The results from linear regression analysis of the assigned value (x-axis)
versus measured value (y-axis) are y = 0.990x + 9.3, r2 = 0.9992.
The S-Test LD assay demonstrates acceptable linearity from 10 to 672 U/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The S-Test LD cartridges are factory calibrated and traceable to the Japanese
Certified Enzyme Reference Materials (JC ERM 20327). The 2-D barcode
printed on each cartridge provides the analyzer with lot-specific calibration
data.
Real time stability studies for the assay reagents have been conducted.
Protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable.
When stored at 2 - 8 ºC the assay reagents are stable for 12 months.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) studies were performed
in accordance to CLSI EP17-A. These determinations were performed using
60 replicates of a true blank (BSA, 7.5% solution in saline) for the LoB and
60 replicates of five low level sample values for the LoD. The true blank
results were ranked from lowest to highest. The LoB was calculated as the
mean of the 57th and 58th highest values for the true blank. The standard

deviation of the 60 results for the low samples was calculated. The LoD was
calculated using the following equation:
LoD = LoB + (1.645 * SD low samples)
The estimate for LoB is 6.5 U/L
The estimate for LoD is 9 U/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
The interference studies were performed in accordance to CLSI EP7-A2.
Various concentrations of the potential interfering compounds were added to
aliquots of normal (approximately 100 U/L LD) and abnormal (approximately
400 U/L LD) serum pools. The control samples consisted of aliquots of the
same serum pools diluted with an equivalent volume of diluent containing no
interfering compound. All samples were tested in triplicate on the S40
Clinical Analyzer. The following interference studies were performed:
Study Compound Used Concentrations tested (mg/dL)
Bilirubin Unconjugated bilirubin up to 50
Hemolysis Hemoglobin up to 1000
Lipemia Intralipid up to 2000
Interference was considered significant if the analyte recovery changed by
more than ± 10%. Analysis of the data demonstrated:
Bilirubin: No significant interference.
Hemolysis: Positive interference (≥ 20%) occurred at all levels tested.
Lipemia (Intralipid): No significant interference below 750 mg/dL.
Interference occurred (absorbance exceeds reaction limit) at 1000 mg/dL.
Other limitations:
• The product insert states that hemolyzed samples should not be used.
• The product insert refers to literature for a comprehensive list of drugs
and other substances that can affect LD concentrations in serum.
Carryover: The sponsor evaluated the carryover characteristics of the
proposed assay at three POLs and in-house using three serum samples (with
normal, intermediate and elevated levels of LD). The % carryover and t-
statistic were calculated for each lab. The carryover specifications for all four
labs were met.
