L. Test Principle:
Glucose measurement is based on electrochemical biosensor technology using the
enzyme glucose oxidase. The glucose in the sample is oxidized to produce gluconic
acid. The electrical current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is measured and
correlated to glucose concentration by the meter. The magnitude of the current is
proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample. The test strip is calibrated
to display the equivalent of plasma glucose values to allow comparison of results with
laboratory methods. Using the same technology, β-hydroxybutyrate (β- ketone) is
converted by β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and the magnitude of electrical
current resulting from this enzymatic reaction is proportional to the amount of β-
hydroxybutyrate present in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing for β-ketone was performed on three levels of control
solutions and five venous blood samples spiked with various concentrations of
β-ketone. Sixty samples were assayed for the venous blood samples and
thirty-six samples were assayed for the control solutions. Three lots of test
strips were tested using the venous blood samples and the control solutions.
Samples were assayed in replicates of four on each of five monitors. The
sponsor conducted day-to-day precision studies using three levels of three
levels of control solutions. Results are summarized in the tables below.

The precision studies for blood glucose measurement were addressed in the
sponsor’s predicate device (Nova Max Blood Glucose Monitor –k070255) that uses
the same glucose test strips. However, the sponsor conducted additional precision
studies to demonstrate the precision for glucose measurements are maintained in the
new device.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was conducted using venous blood samples with β-ketone
concentrations of 0.07, 0.28, 1.5, 2.42, 3.48, 4.61, 5.24, 7.13, 8.13 mM. Samples
were tested 10 times on 5 meters using 3 lots. The samples were prepared by
spiking blood with ketone. Samples were also assayed using a reference reagent.
The summary of linear regression analyses of data generated based on the lot
number is given in the table below. Based on the linearity studies, the sponsor
claimed the ketone measuring range of the device is 0.1 – 8.0 mmol/L.

The linearity studies for blood glucose measurement were addressed in the
sponsor’s predicate device (Nova Max Blood Glucose Monitor –k070255) that uses
the same glucose test strips.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
To demonstrate the shelf-life stability of the Nova Max Plus Ketone Test Strips, the
sponsor conducted real time testing at 250C and accelerated testing at 300C, 400C
and 500C using 3 lots of test strips and three Nova Max Plus meters. Based on the
current accelerated stability testing, ketone test strips are stable up to 9 months in a
real time environment. Real time shelf life stability testing is ongoing. To
demonstrate the shelf-life stability of the Nova Max Plus Ketone control solutions,
the sponsor conducted real time testing at 250C and accelerated testing at 400C and
500C using one lot of strips and 3 levels of ketone control solutions. Based on the
sponsor’s acceptance criteria, the control solutions are stable up to 2 years.
The sponsor provided the value assignment protocols for ketone control solutions.
Values are assigned by assaying the control materials multiple times on multiple
meters. The mean values are obtained and ranges are assigned based upon the
results obtained. Target values are provided in the labeling.
The shelf life and traceability studies for blood glucose measurement for strips and
controls were addressed in the sponsor’s predicate device (Nova Max Blood
Glucose Monitor –k070255) that uses the same glucose test strips.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor conducted Limit of Detection (LOD) studies following CLSI EP-17-A
(Protocols for Determination of Limit of Detection and limit of Quantitation,
Approved Guideline). Five samples containing no ketones were tested 100 times to
determine the limit of blank. Non-parametric analysis yielded a limit of blank of
0.06. To determine the LOD, a low sample (0.20) was tested 100 times. The
equation, LOD = LOB + 1.6494*SD yielded a LOD of 0.093.
The limit of detection for blood glucose measurement was addressed in the
sponsor’s predicate device (Nova Max Blood Glucose Monitor –k070255) that uses
the same glucose test strips.
e. Analytical specificity:
Following CLSI EP7 guidelines, the sponsor tested a total of 21 substances that
may interfere with β-ketone measurements. Three ketone spiked blood samples
were prepared (ketone concentrations 0-0.8mM, 2.0-3.5mM and 5.0-7.0mM) for
each potentially interfering substance. The concentrations of the potential
interference compounds spiked into samples covered the low and high end of
therapeutic range and the toxic range. One sample was assayed for each
concentration using five monitors. The sponsor concluded that the results
demonstrated no significant interference from the substances tested. The results for
each interfering substance are given in the table below:

The interference studies for blood glucose measurement were addressed in the
sponsor’s predicate device (Nova Max Blood Glucose Monitor –k070255) that uses
the same glucose test strips.
The sponsor evaluated the effect of hematocrit between 20% and 64% in whole
blood samples at 4 levels of ketones (0.1-0.8, 2-3, 4-5, and 6-8). Duplicates of
each were assayed on five Nova Max Plus monitors using two lots of test strips.
A reference value was assayed on a plasma sample remaining from each blood
sample using reference laboratory reagents. The bias for all samples tested was
less than 11%. The claimed hematocrit range is 25% to 60% for both glucose
and ketones.
The interference studies for blood glucose measurement were addressed in the
sponsor’s predicate device (Nova Max Blood Glucose Monitor –k070255) that
uses the same glucose test strips.
The altitude studies for blood glucose measurement were addressed in the
sponsor’s predicate device (Nova Max Blood Glucose Monitor –k070255) that
uses the same glucose test strips.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor conducted accuracy studies to assess the performance of Nova Max
Plus Blood Glucose and β-Ketone Monitor system in the hands of the consumer
(subject) and a trained laboratorian relative to a standard measurement using an
enzymatic spectroscopy reference method. Three lots of Nova Max Blood
ketone strips were randomized across 182 (sample range: 0.1 – 7.5 mmol/L)
subjects with Type1 and Type 2 diabetes. Testing was done by the users using
finger tip lancing only. Results of the linear regression analysis in reference to
the user results are summarized in the table below.

The sponsor’s alternative site testing (palm and forearm) is limited to the
glucose measurement only. The accuracy studies for blood glucose
measurement were addressed in the sponsor’s predicate device (Nova Max
Blood Glucose Monitor –k070255) that uses the same glucose test strips.
However, the sponsor conducted additional method comparison studies using

The expected value for ketones is less than 0.6 mmol/L. (American journal of
Clinical pathology 107: 333-358. 1997).
N. Instrument Name:
Nova Max Plus Blood Glucose and β-Ketone Monitoring System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional
readings.
2. Software:
FDA reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes
for glucose measurement in k070255. Additionally, in this submission, the
sponsor provided data to support the added new features for ketone measurements.
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied
directly to the test strip as they are collected.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger for
ketone measurement and finger, the palm, and the forearm for glucose measurement
only. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip, there are no
special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
A single calibration code is programmed into the meters at the time of
manufacturing and no user Input is required
6. Quality Control:
Three glucose control solutions and three ketone control solutions at three different
concentrations to be run with this device are available. The user is referred to the
troubleshooting section of the owner’s manual if control results fall outside these
ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Not applicable
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
