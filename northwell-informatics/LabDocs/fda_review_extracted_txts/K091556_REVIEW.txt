L. Test Principle:
The devices are chemiluminescent two-step immunoassays consisting of magnetic
particles coated with human purified β2GPI which capture, if present, the anti-β2GPI
antiphospholipid antibodies from the sample. After incubation, magnetic separation,
and a wash step, a tracer consisting of an isoluminol-labeled anti-human IgG or IgM
antibody is added and may bind with the captured anti-β2GPI IgG or IgM on the
particles. After a second incubation, magnetic separation, and wash step, reagents
that trigger the luminescent reaction are added, and the emitted light is measured as
relative light units (RLUs) by the ACL AcuStar optical system. The RLUs are
directly proportional to the anti-β2GPI IgG or IgM concentration in the sample.
The ACL AcuStar anti-β2GPI IgG and IgM assays utilize a 4 Parameter Logistic
Curve (4PLC) fit data reduction method to generate a Master Curve. The Master
Curve is predefined and lot dependent and it is stored in the instrument through the
cartridge barcode. With the measurement of calibrators, the predefined Master Curve
is transformed to a new, instrument specific 4PLC Working Curve. The
concentration values of the calibrators are included in the calibrator tube barcodes.

performed with two different lots of reagents; results were comparable for
both lots. Results from one lot are shown below:
Assay Sample Regression r2 Dilution Range (U/mL)
1 y = 0.92x + 3.8 0.986 7.2 – 47.0
IgG 2 y = 1.04x – 16.5 0.996 21.4 – 469.7
3 y = 0.995x – 36.9 0.996 417 – 5632.0

IgM 2 y = 0.98x + 1.6 0.992 5.3 – 105.8
3 y = 1.05x – 33.5 0.990 23.4 – 727.3
The sponsor has established the linear range of the assays as 6.4 – 6100 U/mL
for the anti- β2-GPI IgG assay and 1.1 – 841 U/mL for the anti- β2-GPI IgM
assay.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
An international reference material for anti-β2-GPI antibodies is not available.
The assay is calibrated in relative arbitrary units (U/mL).
The two calibrator values are assigned using in-house standards and a four-
parameter Master Curve. The assignment values of the two calibrators are
used to create a lot-specific four-parameter logistic curve, using two stored
parameters from the Master Curve and two lot-specific parameters based on
the calibrator values.
Control values are assigned by analyzing the material with previous batches of
reagents on two different ACL AcuStar instruments. The controls are
analyzed in replicates of 10 on both instruments, then the batches of reagent
are switched between instruments and the controls are re-analyzed.
Stability studies were performed that support a shelf-life of 15 months at 2-
8°C storage for the HemosIL AcuStar Anti- β2-GPI IgG and the HemosIL
AcuStar Anti- β2-GPI IgM reagent cartridges, as well as calibrators and
controls for both assays.
The on-board stability of the reagent cartridge after opening on the AcuStar
System was demonstrated to be at least 6 weeks. On-board stability of
calibrators was shown to be 3.5h.
The sponsor recommends following the recommendations for storage
conditions for samples in CLSI H18-A3 “Procedures for the Handling and
Processing of Blood Specimens: Third Edition”.

d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined to be 6.4 U/mL for the anti-β2-
GPI IgG assay and 1.1 U/mL for the anti-β2-GPI IgM assay. The LoB and
LoD were determined using the procedure described in CLSI EP17-A. Briefly,
LoB was determined by performing 60 replicates of saline buffer. The results
were ordered according to their value and the mean of position 57 and 58
(representing the 95th percentile) was determined as the LoB. The LoD was
determined by reading 60 replicates of two low concentration samples and
determining the standard deviation. LoD was calculated as LoD = LoB + 1.65
SD where SD is the pooled standard deviation of the two low positive sample
readings.
e. Analytical specificity:
Both the IgG and the IgM assays were tested with the following endogenous
interferents at two levels and showed less than ± 10% interference at the
concentration noted: Hemoglobin, 500 mg/dL: Bilirubin, 18 mg/dL:
Triglycerides, 1250 mg/dL: Heparin, 2 IU/mL: Rheumatoid Factor (RF), 500
IU/mL.
Cross-reactivity: 10 samples positive for RF, 10 samples positive for
antinuclear (ANA) antibodies, and 10 samples positive for rapid plasma
reagin test (RPR, a form of syphilis antibody test) were tested with the
HemosIL anti-β2 GPI IgG and the IgM assays. None of the RF or RPR
samples tested positive by the HemosIL anti-β2 GPI assays. Two ANA
samples (# 6 and #7) tested positive by the IgG assay and one sample (#7)
tested positive by the IgM assay. Sample #7 tested positive by another anti-β2
GPI commercial assay.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-offs were determined to be 20 U/mL in a reference range study
described in the clinical cut-off section below.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
HemoSIL AcuStar anti-β2GPI IgG: 150 clinically defined patient samples

b. Matrix comparison:

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
321 frozen citrated plasmas were tested with the AcuStar anti-β2GPI IgG and
IgM assays. These plasmas were from individuals diagnosed as primary APS
(PAPS), secondary APS (SAPS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) without
APS and SLE-like by standard objective tests. Another group was patients
with cardiovascular disorders but not classified in the previous four groups. A
group of apparently healthy people was also included. The results
summarized below are based on a cut-off of 20 U/mL:

4. Clinical cut-off:
The upper limits of normal (and cut-off) of the HemosIL anti-β2 GPI IgG and
IgM assays were determined by assaying 262 citrated plasma samples from
apparently healthy blood bank volunteers. Following the recommendations of the
international consensus statement on an update of the classification criteria for
definite antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)1 the threshold for positive anti- β2 GPI
antibodies was set at the 99th percentile of the tested population. This was
determined to be 20 U/mL for both assays.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
See Clinical cut-off discussion above.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
