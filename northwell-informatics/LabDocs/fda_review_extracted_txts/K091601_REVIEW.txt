I. Device Description:
The Elecsys Anti-CCP CalCheck is a lyophilized product consisting of human
antibodies to CCP (derived from human serum) in a human serum matrix containing
preservatives. During manufacture, the analyte is spiked into the matrix at the desired
concentration levels. Each Elecsys Anti-CCP CalCheck is calibrated against master
calibrators standardized against a commercially available FDA-cleared second-
generation Anti-CCP assay.
All human source materials used in the preparation of the proposed device were
tested using FDA-approved methods and shown to be free from Hepatitis B Surface
Antigen, and antibodies to Hepatitis C and HIV.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not Applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: There is no recognized standard for CCP. Therefore, the CCP
CalCheck material is traceable to a commercially available FDA-cleared
second-generation Anti-CCP assay.
Value assignment: Each of the three CalCheck levels is value assigned using
a minimum of three Elecsys 2010/cobas e411 analyzers and three MODULAR
ANALYTICS E140/cobas e 601 analyzers. A minimum of six independent
series of analyses are performed on each instrument platform. Each sample is
tested in duplicate. The target value is then calculated as the median of the
determined values. The target values are given in the table below:
Anti-CCP CalCheck Level Anti-CCP Target Values (U/mL)
Check 1 (low) 20
Check 2 (medium) 300
Check 3 (high) 375
Stability: The unopened stability of the CalChecks was determined using
accelerated studies. Based on the accelerated studies, the unopened shelf-life
was estimated to be 24 months. The sponsor is currently performing real-time
studies to support the unopened stability claim predicted from accelerated
studies.
The open vial stability was determined using real-time studies. The data
supports the claim that the reconstituted product is stable up to 4 hours when
stored at 20 to 25 °C.
