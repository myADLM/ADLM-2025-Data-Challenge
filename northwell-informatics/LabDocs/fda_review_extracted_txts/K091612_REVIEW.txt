H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See the Indications for Use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
The UCP Drug Screening Buprenorphine, Amphetamine 300, Methaphetamine
500, Cocaine 150 Tests are rapid, qualitative, competitive binding immunoassays
for the detection the following drug in human urine:
Test Calibrator Cut-off
Buprenorphine Buprenorphine 10 ng/mL
Amphetamine D-Amphetamine 300 ng/mL
Methamphetamine D-Methamphetamine 500 ng/mL
Cocaine Benzoylecgonine 150 ng/mL
The tests contain three formats:1) Test Card/Strip, 2) Test Device, 3) Test Cup.
The test configuration comes with single drug screening test or any combinations
of multiple drug screening tests. The test is intended for in vitro diagnostics use.
This assay provides only preliminary results. A more specific alternate chemical
method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) or Liquid chromatography/mass
spectrometry (LC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical
consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse
test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The device is for in vitro diagnostic prescription use.
This device is indicated for use in point-of-care settings.
This assay provides only preliminary results. A more specific alternate chemical
method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) or Liquid chromatography/mass
spectrometry (LC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical
consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse
test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable, as the device is a visually-read single-use device.

I. Device Description:
The UCP Drug Screening Amphetamine, Buprenorphine, Cocaine and
Methamphetamine are test strips contained within the following formats; dipstick
(dip card), cassette (test device) and test cup. Each device can contain from 1 to 4
drug test strips. The strips contain a membrane coated with drug-protein
conjugates (purified bovine albumin) on the T zone, goat polyclonal antibody
against gold-protein conjugate at the C zone and a dye pad which contains
colloidal gold particles coated with mouse monoclonal antibodies specific against
the drug being tested.
Controls are recommended but not provided

L. Test Principle:
UCP Drug Screening devices are a one-step lateral flow immunoassay containing a
purple-colored conjugate pad with colloidal gold conjugate with anti-drug antibodies,
a nitrocellulose membrane with a test line (T) and a control line (C). The T line is
coated with the drug antigen and the C line is coated with goat anti-mouse IgG
antibodies. The test is a competitive binding immunoassay in which drugs and drug
metabolites in a urine sample compete with immobilized drug conjugate for limited
labeled antibody binding sites. When a sufficient amount of sample is applied the
sample migrates through the test device by capillary action. If the concentration of
drug is below the cutoff level, the anti-drug antibodies in the colloidal gold particles
will bind to the drug antigens coated in the test zone producing a band which
indicates a negative result. If the drug concentration is at the cutoff level or higher no
band will form in the test zone indicating a preliminary positive. A band should form
in the control region regardless of the presence of drug or drug metabolite in the
sample.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was evaluated by spiking drug free negative urine to the
following concentrations (Negative, 50%, 75%, 125%, 150% and 200% of the
cutoff) for each analyte. Testing was performed at three Point-of-Care sites
three operators/site each testing one of three formats. Each sample, at each
concentrations of each drug, was blind labeled and tested 1 to 2 times a day, for
10 non-consecutive days. A total of 30 determinations, at each concentration,
were made. Results are presented in the tables below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. This is a qualitative test.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This device has internal process controls. A colored line appearing in the control
region confirms that sufficient sample volume has been applied and that the
sample has migrated correctly on the test strip. Users are informed that the test is
invalid if a line fails to appear in the control region. External controls are not
supplied with this device.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical performance of the device around the cutoff is described in the
precision section 1.a above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was established by spiking various concentrations of similarly
structured drug compounds into drug free urine. The concentration of the drug
that produced a response equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the assay
was determined. Results are in the tables below:

There is the possibility that other substances and/or factors not listed above
may interfere with the test and cause false results.
pH and Specific Gravity
To test for possible positive and/or negative interference a negative urine
sample and a positive, 50% above the cutoff for each drug urine sample were
divided into six aliquots and adjusted to the following pH concentrations 4.5,
5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0 and 9.0. No interference due to pH was observed.
To test for possible positive and/or negative interference from specific gravity,
distilled water or sodium chloride was added to negative urine samples or
150% cutoff urine samples to obtain samples having specific gravity of 1.002,
1.020, 1.025, 1.030 and 1.035. No interference due to specific gravity was
observed.
