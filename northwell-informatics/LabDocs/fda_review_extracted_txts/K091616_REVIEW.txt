L. Test Principle:
The BioPlex 2200 MMRV IgG kit employs a panel of four antigen-coated
fluoromagnetic beads with unique fluorescent signatures to identify the presence of IgG
class antibodies to Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and VZV antigens in a two step assay
format.
Step 1: The system combines an aliquot of patient sample with sample diluent and bead
reagent then agitates the mixture at 37°C.
Step 2: Immobilized IgG antibodies are bound to a phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled antihuman
IgG conjugate and detected by flow cytometry.
The fluorescence of the dyes determines the identity of the beads and the fluorescence of
the PE label determines the amount of antibody captured by the antigen. The device
calculates the results in relative fluorescence intensity (RFI). Additionally, the ISB beads,
SVB beads and a RBB beads are present in each reaction mixture to verify detector
response, the addition of serum or plasma to the reaction vessel and the absence of
significant non-specific binding in serum or plasma.
The BioPlex 2200 MMRV IgG Calibrator Set calibrates the instrument. The BioPlex
2200 MMRV IgG Reagent Pack is calibrated using a set of three (3) distinct serum based
calibrators. Calibrators are used in a test system to establish points of reference that are
used in the determination of qualitative numeric measurement of IgG antibodies to
Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in human serum and EDTA
or heparinized plasma. The MMRV IgG Calibrator Set should be loaded and assayed at
minimum in duplicate every 30 days or with each new Re-agent Pack lot.
The BioPlex 2200 MMRV IgG Control Set includes a negative control as well as a
positive control containing antibodies present for analytes within the BioPlex 2200
8

--- Page 9 ---
MMRV IgG Reagent Pack. The positive control is manufactured to give positive results
for antibodies to Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and VZV with values above the cut-off for
each specific assay. The negative control is manufactured to give negative results, with
values below the cut-off for each specific assay. The mean values were derived from
replicate analyses and should fall within the corresponding standard deviation. A BioPlex
2200 MMRV IgG Control Lot Data disk is available to load the necessary value
assignment data into the instrument. The result for each of the tested antibodies is
expressed as an antibody index (AI). For Mumps, Measles, and VZV, an AI of ≤ 0.8
indicates a negative result. An equivocal result is reported for an AI of either 0.9 or 1.0.
AI results ≥1.1 are reported as positive. For Rubella, an AI of ≤ 0.7 indicates a negative
result. An equivocal result is reported for an AI of either 0.8 or 0.9. AI results ≥1.0 are
reported as positive.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Separate internal and external studies were conducted to evaluate the precision
of the BioPlex 2200 MMRV IgG kit assays on the BioPlex 2200 Multi-
Analyte Detection System. The internal precision study was conducted in-
house by Bio-Rad Laboratories in accordance with CLSI EP5-A2. The
internal Precision Study of the BioPlex 2200 MMRV IgG assay was assessed
using serum, EDTA plasma and heparin plasma samples containing IgG class
antibodies to Measles, Mumps, Rubella and (or) VZV. Reproducibility was
determined by calculating the within-run (intra-assay), between-run (inter-
assay), between day (inter-assay) and total precision using a reproducibility
panel prepared at Bio-Rad Laboratories (Benicia, CA) consisting of analyte
positive patient samples. Testing was conducted internally at Bio-Rad
Laboratories. Twenty days of precision data were collected for the reagent set.
Two runs were performed each day spaced by at least two hours. Assay
calibration was conducted at the start of the study and all samples were
randomized for each run. Controls were run daily to qualify the run. Each
sample was run in duplicate per run for a total of eighty data points per sample
for the twenty day analysis (forty data points for the ten day analysis). Data
analysis was based on CLSI EP5-A2 (Evaluation of Precision Performance of
Clinical Chemistry Devices). The reproducibility panel of patient samples
included at least one high negative sample near the assay decision point, two
low positive samples and two high positive samples (see Table 1.) Each
sample was prepared by blending serum or plasma with like matrix to obtain
the target analyte concentration. Multiple serum or plasma samples were used
to make the panels. The BioPlex 2200 MMRV IgG reagent kit demonstrated
acceptable precision and met the manufacturing design inputs, when tested
against a precision sample set containing samples below, near or above the
assay cut-off with the exception of one VZV sample with an AI value of 0.3
9

--- Page 10 ---
AI, which gave a within run CV of 14.4%. The within run imprecision for
samples with AI >0.5 in all sample matrices ranged from 3.2% to 10.1% for
Measles, 2.4% to 6.4% for Mumps, 2.9% to 7.2% for Rubella and 2.7% to
6.8% for VZV IgG. Total run imprecision for samples with AI >0.5 in all
sample matrices ranged from 3.2% to 10.3% for Measles, 1.8% to 7.5% for
Mumps, 3.9% to 7.6% for Rubella and 2.7% to 8.4% for VZV IgG.
The external reproducibility study was conducted in accordance with CLSI
EP15-A2 during the external clinical evaluation at each of three clinical study
sites. The reproducibility of each of the assays in the BioPlex 2200 MMRV
IgG kit was assessed using three sample panels of different matrices (serum,
EDTA plasma, and sodium heparin plasma). The positive samples of the
panels were prepared at Bio-Rad Laboratories by pooling one or more
antibody positive patient samples for one or more of the analytes in the
BioPlex 2200 MMRV IgG Test. The panel consisted of members with varying
levels of antibodies to the analytes in the BioPlex 2200 MMRV IgG kit, and a
positive control (antibody positive for all analytes). Reproducibility testing
was performed at 3 U.S. clinical trial sites using three reagent lots of BioPlex
2200 MMRV IgG Reagent Packs, BioPlex 2200 MMRV IgG Calibrator Set
and the BioPlex 2200 MMRV IgG Control Set. Each site evaluated 1 lot of
the BioPlex 2200 MMRV IgG kit. Each of the panel members and a positive
and negative control was tested in quadruplicate on 1 run per day over 5 days
at each of 3 sites (4 replicates x 1 run x 5 days = 20 replicates per panel
member per site = 60 total replicates for 3 sites). The data were analyzed for
intra-assay and inter-assay reproducibility according to the Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidance EP15-A2 (Vol. 25, No. 17).
The mean Antibody Index (AI), standard deviation (SD), and percent
coefficient of variation (%CV) for each panel member were calculated. The

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The test is a qualitative assay and linearity data is not required. However, for
Rubella the lower range of the assay and the range around the cut-off (0 – 18
IU/ml) is quantitative. The company demonstrated the linearity for this assay
range using a titration of the World Health Organization (WHO) anti-Rubella
immunoglobulin, 1st International Standard, 1996 (RUBI-1-94). Dilution
linearity was assessed in the range of 0 - 18 IU/mL (0 - 1.8 AI). The results
were analyzed based on the recommendations in CLSI protocol EP6-A (Vol.
23, No. 16) and are shown in the figure below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The test is a qualitative assay. However, for Rubella the lower range of the
assay and the range around the cut-off (0 – 20 IU/ml) and the MMRV IgG
calibrators are traceable to the World Health Organization (WHO) anti-
Rubella immunoglobulin, 1st International Standard, 1996. The percent
recovery for the international standard is represented in the table below.

Cross-Reactivity
A cross-reactivity study was performed to determine if samples from various
disease states and other potentially cross-reacting agents interfere with test
results when tested with the BioPlex 2200 MMRV IgG kit. Samples known to
be high positive samples for each of 13 potentially cross reactive antibodies
listed in the table below were evaluated with the BioPlex 2200 MMRV IgG
assays. Due to the high prevalence of IgG antibodies to Measles, Mumps,
Rubella, and VZV in the population as a result of vaccination, and in order to
properly evaluate the potential cross-reactivity, all samples were pre-tested by
commercially available Measles, Mumps, Rubella and VZV assays. The
samples which were negative by the commercially available assay were
further tested by the BioPlex 2200 MMRV IgG kit. The following table
summarizes negative agreement between the BioPlex 2200 MMRV IgG
assays and the corresponding commercially available Measles, Mumps,
Rubella and VZV assays within each of the thirteen cross-reactant panels. The
results demonstrate that the various disease state samples evaluated do not
cross-react with the 4 antigens in the BioPlex 2200 MMRV IgG kit. The
potential cross reactivity with ANA IgG antibodies and HCV antibodies was
not fully evaluated due to limitations of the sample size tested.

Interfering Substances
Testing for interfering substances was conducted according to CLSI Protocol
EP7-A2 (Vol. 25, No. 27). No significant interference was observed in any of
the substances tested. Serum component interference ranged from a -7.1% to
3.8% difference relative to non-spiked controls. Exogenous substance
interference ranged from a -4.0% to 4.2% difference relative to non-spiked
controls. The following substances, listed in the table below, were tested at the
corresponding concentrations. Test and control samples were evaluated in
alternating order in replicates of five each using the BioPlex 2200 MMRV
IgG Kit. This sequence was repeated twice for a total of ten replicates per
interferent and calculations were made based on EP7-A2 guidelines. Serum
components were considered interfering if sample results deviated by more
than ± 20% (± two standard deviations of the minimal within run precision
criterion of 10% C.V.) relative to the value determined in the absence of the
interferent. CLSI guidelines (EP7-A2) define interference as an effect that
exceeds the normal assay variability and where incremental error caused by
the substance is large enough to affect clinical decision making.

f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off values and assignment of the calibrators are determined by
performing concordance and Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC)
analysis, using predicate results as the standard. This analysis was used to
assist in optimizing negative and positive agreement (relative sensitivity and
specificity). Based on the results, calibrator values were adjusted such that the
cut-off values equal to 1.0 AI for Measles, Mumps, Rubella and VZV IgG
assays. The calibration for Rubella was set based on calibration to the WHO
RUBI-1-94 Rubella standard. Testing was conducted internally at Bio-Rad
Laboratories. An equivocal zone of approximately +/- 10% was applied to the
BioPlex 2200 MMRV IgG assays based on a separate analysis of assay
precision at the established cut-off.
A total of 842 samples were evaluated to confirm cut-off values. Predicate
testing for Measles, Mumps and VZV was performed at Bio-Rad Quality
Systems Division (Irvine, CA) using VIDAS assay kits manufactured by
BioMérieux (Durham, NC). Predicate testing for Rubella was performed at
Bio-Rad BioPlex Division (Benicia, CA) using the Bio-Rad (Sera Quest) EIA
kits manufactured by Quest International (Miami, FL). ROC Analysis was
performed for each analyte using this population of samples. For the purpose
of establishing a cut-off, predicate equivocal samples were not used during
ROC analysis.
BioPlex 2200 MMRV IgG assays met or exceeded the concordance
specifications established as Design Inputs of ≥ 95% positive agreement as
well as ≥ 96% negative agreement for all analytes. The results of concordance
testing and ROC analysis validate the cut-off that was established for each of
the analytes in the BioPlex 2200 MMRV IgG assays.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Comparative Testing: Prospective
Performance of the MMRV IgG kit was evaluated against corresponding
commercially available Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and VZV immunoassays.
Serum samples from pregnant women (N = 396) and serum samples with a
Measles, Mumps, Rubella, or VZV IgG test ordered (N = 1183) were tested at
3 U.S. clinical trial sites. Serum samples with a Measles, Mumps, Rubella, or
VZV IgG test ordered included serum samples submitted for routine testing
(N = 790) and serum samples for pre-employment evaluation (N = 393).
Results for all populations are shown in the tables below. Equivocal results
obtained for Mumps and Measles on the commercially available EIAs were
further tested on two additional commercially available EIAs to obtain a final
16

result. The consensus results of two out of the three comparator tests are
presented in the tables for Mumps and Measles, below. Equivocal results
obtained for Rubella on the commercially available EIA were re-tested on the
commercially available EIA, following the manufacturer's recommendations,
and the re-test results are presented in the tables below for Rubella, below.

Comparative Testing: Retrospective
Performance of the MMRV IgG kit was evaluated against corresponding
commercially available Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and VZV immunoassays
using retrospective serum samples negative for antibodies to Measles (N =
93), Mumps (N = 96), Rubella (N = 268), or VZV (N = 143). The negative
samples for Measles and Mumps were selected using a consensus of two out
of three commercially available EIAs. Negative samples for Rubella and VZV
were selected using the corresponding predicate device. The results are
presented below.

CDC Rubella Low Positive Control Testing
A lyophilized CDC low positive control serum was prepared by and tested at
one clinical trial site. The control was tested neat and diluted 1/2. Each
dilution was run in duplicate. The results are presented below.
Dilution Mean (AI)
Neat – Prepared per package insert 2.3
1/2 Dilution 1.4
b. Matrix comparison:
The following three studies were conducted to demonstrate agreement and
precision for each matrix as well as specimen transport conditions and analyte
stability
- BioPlex 2200 MMRV IgG Matrix comparison study: this study was
conducted in accordance with CLSI EP9-A2 and demonstrates that there is no
or minimal assay effect when EDTA and heparinized plasma are compared to
serum.
- BioPlex 2200 MMRV IgG Sample Stability Study: this study provides the
basis for fresh and frozen sample storage recommendations as well as the
maximum number of freeze/thaw cycles.
- BioPlex 2200 MMRV IgG Sample Stability (Special Study) Report: this
study provides additional validation of the prospectively collected serum
samples used during the clinical trial, on the BioPlex 2200 MMRV IgG and
predicate assays. The clinical samples were collected prospectively and frozen
at -20C for testing at a future date. This study validates this storage practice
for the BioPlex 2200 MMRV IgG and predicate assays.
In the matrix comparison study, matched serum and plasma (EDTA and
heparin) samples drawn from 50 individual donors were acquired from
commercial sources. All samples were evaluated in replicates of two. Plasma
AI values were compared to matched serum AI values. All assays in the
MMRV IgG kit and all lots pass the slope specification of 1.0 ± 0.2; intercept
specification of ±0.2, and correlation (r) of ≥0.98. The S.E.E (standard
estimate of error) was less than 0.22 for all assays. The data has demonstrated
that both EDTA and heparin plasma are acceptable matrices for the MMRV
IgG assay3.
