Lidocaine assay for the quantitative determination of lidocaine in human serum on
automated clinical chemistry analyzers. The QMS Lidocaine Calibrator set is a six-
level set (0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10 µg/mL) of single analyte (lidocaine) calibrators.
This product contains human sourced and/or potentially infectious components.
Components sourced from human blood have been tested by FDA-approved methods
and found to be nonreactive for HBsAg, anti-HIV 1/2, and anti-HCV.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not Applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The QMS Lidocaine Calibrators are traceable to United States Pharmacopeia
(USP) lidocaine gravimetrically spiked into human serum.
Stability:
The stability of the calibrators is established through real time data. Testing is
conducted at multiple time points and must pass pre-defined acceptance
criteria. The sponsor’s protocol and acceptance criteria are found to be
acceptable. The unopened product refrigerated at 2 – 8 oC is stable for 12
months. The opened product is also stable for 12 months, refrigerated at 2 – 8
oC.
Value assignment:
Value assignments are based on an internal protocol using Master calibrators
that have been validated by the predicate calibrators. The final bottle
assignments are based on 25-50 replicates of each of the calibrator using the
QMS lidocaine regents on the Hitachi 917 analyzer.
d. Detection limit:
Not Applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
Not Applicable
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable
2. Comparison studies:
