L. Test Principle:
The ARK Levetiracetam Assay is a homogeneous immunoassay based on competition
between drug in the specimen and levetiracetam labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for binding to the antibody reagent. As the latter
binds antibody, enzyme activity decreases. In the presence of drug from the specimen,
enzyme activity increases and is directly proportional to the drug concentration. Active
enzyme converts the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH that
is measured spectrophotometrically as a rate of change in absorbance. Endogenous serum
G6PDH does not interfere with the results because the co-enzyme NAD functions only
with the bacterial enzyme used in the assay.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable): Performance was validated on
the Hitachi 917 instrument.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision
Samples evaluated included the ARK Levetiracetam Control and three pooled human
serum samples. Data were collected on a single analyzer over twenty non-consecutive
days. Five calibrations were performed (Days 1, 5, 10, 12 and 17) during this interval to
provide variation (calibration was performing in a stable manner). Each sample was
assayed in quadruplicate twice a day, with each run separated by at least two hours.
Calculations were conducted according to CLSI Guideline EP5-A2. Results are
summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The manufacturer’s claimed assay reportable range is from 2.0 to 100 μg/mL, based on
linearity, recovery, lower limit of quantitation and method comparison results submitted
in the 510(k). (See respective sections below for specific information on performance).
Linearity:
Samples ranging from 2 to 100 μg/mL were prepared from a gravimetrically prepared
levetiracetam stock solution and levetiracetam-free serum pools. The dilutions were
prepared so that levetiracetam concentrations varied in increments of 1 ug/mL within the
range 2-10 μg/mL; and in increments of 10 ug/mL within the range of 10 μg/mL - 100
μg/mL. The averaged results of multiple runs and replicates (n=6) for each sample using
the ARK assay were used in the calculations. Regression analyses were performed
between the measured mean levetiracetam and the nominal values for each dilution, using
first order and second order polynomial determinations according to CLSI/NCCLS EP6-
A. In the range from 7-100 ug/mL deviations from linearity were < 2%. In the range
from 4-7 μg/mL, deviations were less than 5%, and in the range from 2-3 μg/mL,
deviations ranged from 8 -13%. Regression equation was:
(measured) = 1.0309(gravimetrically determined) + 0.0264, r² = 0.9996
Trueness/Recovery:
Serum samples across the assay range were prepared containing pure levetiracetam
(USP). The results of the six replicates were averaged and compared to the theoretical
target concentration and the percentage recovery was calculated.
Results are shown below. Percent Recovery = 100 x Mean recovered concentration

Dilution of high samples:
The package insert recommends that patient samples with concentrations above the assay
range may be diluted with zero calibrator. To support this, both spiked samples, and high
patient samples were diluted 4-fold with zero calibrator (calibrator A) before pipetting the
sample into the sample cup. The average of multiple measurements was used to
determine recovery (relative to gravimetric concentration) for spiked samples and
(relative to LC/MS/MS) for patient samples. Results are shown below.

Stability is evaluated using both accelerated and real-time protocols. For real-time stability
testing, performance of materials refrigerated at 2-8 degrees C are compared to a reference set of
materials that are stored frozen. Results are evaluated at multiple time points during the
expiration dating period for accuracy and precision in measuring levetiracetam controls. No
change in recovery or precision was observed in the real-time studies submitted in the 510(k).
Real time studies (to support the expiration dating of 25 months) are ongoing.
Calibrator value assignment:
Stock solutions of pure levetiracetam (USP) were prepared and then added to both the
synthetic calibrator/control matrix (calibrator A) to achieve the calibrator concentrations
of 4.0 µg/mL, 10.0 µg/mL, 20.0 µg/mL, 45.0 µg/mL and 80.0 µg/mL levels. Samples
were assayed by the ARK™ Levetiracetam Assay. Multiple runs and replicates were
evaluated to determine recovery in the two matrices. The same spiking was performed
with serum, so that any matrix effects may be detected. Analytical recoveries observed
were 92-98% in the calibrator/control matrix and 95-100% in the serum matrix.
Control value assignment:
Quality control (QC) ranges were established using three runs with four replicates tested
per run (n=12 for each control level) and the mean levetiracetam level of each control
was calculated. Control ranges were set at ± 15% around the mean level tested. The
package insert notes that each laboratory should establish its own ranges for each new lot
of controls.
d. Detection limit:
Accuracy and precision studies near the low range of the assay were conducted to
determine the manufacturer’s claimed lower limit of quantitation (LOQ). Studies
generally followed CLSI Guideline EP-17 guideline. Three levetiracetam levels were
tested below the lowest positive calibrator concentration (5.0 μg/mL). Samples were
prepared by gravimetric addition of pure levetiracetam (USP) to stock solution, and
addition of this stock solution to pooled human serum negative for levetiracetam.
Concentrations included 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 μg/mL. Eight replicates of each sample were
tested in each of five runs to give 40 replicates of each sample. Testing was performed on
a total of 3 lots. Each run was performed on a separate day, with a separate calibration to
enhance variability (i.e., challenge the assay). Results for all lots supported that
performance met the manufacturer’s acceptance criteria of the LOQ of 2.0 μg/mL having
CV within 20% and recovery within +/-15%.
e. Analytical specificity:
Studies included testing for interference from endogenous compounds, metabolite, and
commonly co-administered, and other anti-epileptic drugs.
Serum samples with clinically high concentrations of the potential interfering substances
were tested by the assay in the presence of varying amounts of levetiracetam.

Specifically, serum samples tested contained levetiracetam at concentrations of 50
ug/mL, 15 ug/mL, and in some cases also 6 ug/mL. In addition, metabolite cross-
reactivity was also tested in the absence of levetiracetam. Each sample containing
interferent was assayed, along with a serum control of levetiracetam. Results for
endogenous compounds and the metabolite ucb L057 are shown below. The complete
list of interferents tested and results are included in the package insert.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were performed using banked samples obtained from two
laboratories. Specimens were mostly derived from a wide geographic area in the U.S.,
from patients across a wide range of ages, including both male and female. Samples
were selected to be within the assay concentration range. No other selection criteria were
applied.
Results of samples obtained with the ARK assay were compared to those obtained with
three different reference methods. Assay descriptions and summary validation
information for the comparator methods were included in the 510(k). In the largest of the
three evaluations (n=305) results were compared to those of an LC/MS/MS assay.
Results of Passing-Bablok regression analysis for this study are shown below:

In addition there were smaller method comparison studies with two additional reference
methods. The averaged bias (reference minus ARK) was within 10%. Additional testing
of patient samples, with levetiracetam concentrations close to 100 ug/mL, by the ARK
assay and the reference method demonstrated agreement. Differences were all within +/-
10%.
b. Matrix comparison:
Assay recovery, as well as precision (within one run) was evaluated for levetiracetam
spiked into the following plasma types: Lithium heparin, Potassium, EDTA, Sodium
heparin and serum. Matched specimens for serum and plasma were collected from eight
subjects. Five samples spiked with levetiracetam (2, 10, 20, 40, 80 μg/mL) were
prepared from each specimen (for a total of 40 samples per anticoagulant). Replicate
measurements for each of the forty samples were averaged. Percent recoveries for all
forty samples ranged from 95.3% to 109.6% relative to nominal spiked values; and from
95.0 to 107.2 for plasma relative to serum values. For the large majority of samples
recoveries well-within these ranges were observed, and no specific trends (of differences
in recovery relative to concentration) were observed.
In addition, the sponsor submitted a summary of literature suggesting equivalence
between serum and heparinized plasma for measuring levetiracetam in patient samples, as

well as literature cautioning that levetiracetam is hydrolyzed in blood (Patsalos et al,
Epilepsia 47 1818-21, 2006). To address this, the package insert advises users to process
the blood as soon as possible after collection to prepare serum or plasma, since hydrolysis
of levetiracetam may occur in the prolonged presence of whole blood.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity: NA. Not typically submitted for this type of assay.
b. Clinical specificity: NA. Not typical for this type of assay.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): The
sponsor provided a discussion with balanced and representative literature
discussing clinical use of levetiracetam measurements.
4. Clinical cut-off: see expected values.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The following is included in the package insert:
A reference range for levetiracetam has not been well established. Tentative reference
ranges for seizure control have been proposed, which include concentrations from 6 to 46
μg/mL (35 to 270 μmol/L; trough samples). However, these ranges have not been
validated by adequate controlled trials, and in general the relationship between these
serum concentrations and clinical effect has not been well-defined. Levetiracetam drug
concentrations should be used in conjunction with information available from clinical
evaluations and other diagnostic procedures. Circulating levels of levetiracetam (serum
blood concentrations) may be affected by compliance, renal function, pregnancy, drug-
drug interactions and timing of the sample draw. Furthermore, the clinical effect of these
serum blood concentrations may be further altered by changes in progression in the
severity of the disease and the addition or withdrawal of concomitant drugs which may
interact pharmacodynamically with circulating levels of levetiracetam.
The reference range of drug concentrations which is quoted should only imply a lower
limit below which a therapeutic response is relatively unlikely to occur, and an upper
limit above which toxicity is relatively likely to occur in the specific patient populations
studied. Generally, clinicians using reference ranges such as these should be aware that,
because of individual variation, patients may achieve therapeutic benefit with serum drug
concentrations outside of these ranges and may experience toxicity with levels below the
lower limit of the reference range. Sampling time should be standardized such that trough
serum concentrations are measured just before the next dosage, preferably in the
morning.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports
substantial equivalence decision.
