K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None provided
L. Test Principle:
The Immunoscan CCPlus® test kit is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) for detection and semi-quantitation of IgG antibodies to CCP in human sera.
The test utilizes microtiter plate wells coated with citrullinated synthetic peptides
(antigen). Diluted patient serum is applied to the wells and incubated. If specific
antibodies are present, they will bind to the antigen in the wells. Unbound material is
washed away and any bound antibody is detected by adding horse radish peroxidase
(HRP) labelled anti-human IgG, followed by a second washing step then incubation
with substrate. The presence of reacting antibodies will result in the development of
colour, which is proportional to the quantity of bound antibody, and this is
determined photometrically.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Intra-assay precision was determined by testing six different samples
across the measuring range (two high eight times each). The results are
summarized in the table below:
High Medium Low
Mean (U/mL). 2672 2685 1150 239 56 60

% C.V. 5.2 7.6 4.8 1.0 3.8 1.9
Two additional samples were run (8 replicates each) – a weak positive
sample and one just below the cut off of 25 U/ml. The results are
summarized in the table below:
< 25 U/ml Weak positive

summarized below:
< 25 U/ml Weak positive
Mean (U/mL) 19 28
S.D. (U/mL) 0.5 0.5
% C.V. 2.6 1.8
Lot to lot variation was determined by testing six different samples eight
replicates each. Results were obtained for three different lots. The results
are summarized below:
High Medium Low
Mean (U/mL) 2896 2870 1530 259 60 62
S.D. (U/mL) 405 335 260.4 21.8 4.2 6.6
% C.V. 14.0 11.7 17.0 8.4 6.9 10.8
Reproducibility: The reproducibility of the qualitative protocol around the
assay cut-off was determined by testing two samples eight times each on
three different days (n = 24). All results were negative for the sample with
19 Units/ml concentration and all results were positive for the sample with
28 Units/ml.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Dilution recovery of three high concentration samples was determined by
testing five serial dilutions of each sample. The results are summarized in the
table below:

Four additional samples were tested with concentrations 164, 180, 321 and
395 U/mL. The results are shown in the table below:

MK-RA 169 1/50 – 1/3200 7.8 – 395 6.5 – 395 98 – 120
The measuring assay range is 25-2962 U/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There is no widely accepted reference standard for anti-CCP. The calibrators
and controls (positive and negative) are prepared in-house and arbitrary units
are assigned during the development process.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB) was determined by running the zero standard 14
times on three different lots. The LoB of 1.6 U/mL was calculated by finding
the mean plus two standard deviations.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference Study/Endogenous compounds: Three low positive samples were
spiked with bilirubin at 0.2 mg/mL, hemoglobin at 400 mg/dL, lipid at 15
mg/mL and rheumatoid factor at 200 IU/mL. The data indicates that the
assayed concentrations do not interfere with the anti-CCP results. Please refer
to the predicate (k052133) for more details on the studies conducted for the
device.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off of 25 U/mL was established in the predicate assay. The proposed
modification did not alter the cut-off.
Semi-Quantitative protocol:
Samples with results < 25 U/mL are defined as negative.
Samples ≥25 U/mL are defined as positive.
Qualitative protocol:
Euro-Diagnostica recommends the following cut-off:
