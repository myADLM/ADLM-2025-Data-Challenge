E. Applicant: Luminex Molecular Diagnostics Inc.
F. Proprietary and Established Names: xTAG™ Respiratory Viral Panel
Common Name: Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) Multiplex Nucleic Acid Detection Assay
G. Regulatory Information:
1. Regulation section: 21 CFR 866.3980, Respiratory viral panel multiplex nucleic acid assay
2. Classification: Class II
3. Product code: OCC, OEM, OEP
4. Panel: Microbiology (83)
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The xTAG™ Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) is a qualitative nucleic acid multiplex test intended
for the simultaneous detection and identification of multiple respiratory virus nucleic acids in
nasopharyngeal swabs from individuals suspected of respiratory tract infections. The following
virus types and subtypes are identified using RVP: Influenza A, Influenza A subtype H1,
Influenza A subtype H3, Influenza B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus subtype A, Respiratory
Syncytial Virus subtype B, Parainfluenza 1, Parainfluenza 2, and Parainfluenza 3 virus, Human
Metapneumovirus, Rhinovirus, and Adenovirus. The detection and identification of specific viral
nucleic acids from individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of respiratory infection aids in the
diagnosis of respiratory viral infection if used in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory
findings. It is recommended that specimens found to be negative for Influenza B, Respiratory
Syncytial Virus subtype A and B, Parainfluenza 1, Parainfluenza 2, Parainfluenza 3 and
Adenovirus, after examination using RVP be confirmed by cell culture.
Negative results do not preclude respiratory virus infection and should not be used as the sole
basis for diagnosis, treatment or other management decisions. Positive results do not rule out
bacterial infection, or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite
cause of disease. The use of additional laboratory testing (e.g. bacterial culture,
immunofluorescence, radiography) and clinical presentation must be taken into consideration in
order to obtain the final diagnosis of respiratory viral infection.

Due to seasonal prevalence, performance characteristics for Influenza A/H1 were established
primarily with retrospective specimens.
The RVP assay cannot adequately detect Adenovirus species C, or serotypes 7a and 41. The RVP
primers for detection of rhinovirus cross-react with enterovirus. A rhinovirus reactive result
should be confirmed by an alternate method (e.g. cell culture).
Performance characteristics for Influenza A Virus were established when Influenza A/H3 and
A/H1 were the predominant Influenza A viruses in circulation. When other Influenza A viruses
are emerging, performance characteristics may vary. If infections with a novel Influenza A virus
is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by
public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control
precautions for novel virulent Influenza viruses and sent to a state or local health department for
testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available
to receive and culture specimens.
2. Indication(s) for use: Same as Intended Use

The xTAG RVP can detect the matrix gene of 2009 H1N1 influenza virus but can not
identify the hemagglutinin gene of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus in clinical specimens.
The paragraphs below summarize two studies by Dr. Christine Ginocchio, Director of
Microbiology, Virology and Molecular Diagnostics at North Shore-LIJ Health System
Laboratories (Ginocchio & George, 2009; Ginocchio et al. 2009):
In a study carried out during the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak in New York (Ginocchio
& George, 2009), a total of 1,382 patient nasopharyngeal swab samples were initially
tested with a variety of method including rapid antigen tests (n=1095), direct
immunofluorescence (n=1164), and rapid virus culture (n=1140). Samples that tested
positive for Influenza A with any of these methods, or derived from patients with a high
potential to be infected with the 2009 H1N1 influenza strain, were further tested with
xTAG RVP (n=375). A total of 201 of these samples were identified as Influenza A
positive by the RVP assay, two samples contained Influenza B, and other respiratory
viruses in 58 samples (adenovirus, metapneumovirus, Parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, RSV, and
rhinovirus). Sixty of the 201 Influenza A positive samples were identified by xTAG RVP
as seasonal strains (2 as H1 and 58 as H3). The remaining 141 Influenza A positive
samples were negative for both H1 and H3 by xTAG RVP (unsubtypeable). Frozen
residual portions of 101 of the 141 unsubtypeable samples were forwarded to the
Laboratory of Viral Diseases (Albany, NY) for further testing with the CDC rRT-PCR
assay for 2009 H1N1 influenza). A total of 99 of the 101 specimens tested with the CDC
assay were identified as positive for the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus (CT<37). The two
remaining specimens produced weak positive signals (CT>37) on one or more of the
influenza targets and could not be classified as positive for the 2009 H1N1 influenza
strain. These two samples also produced weak positive signals in the RVP assay.
A study by Ginocchio et al. (2009) evaluated the performance of a variety of diagnostic
assays, including the xTAG RVP, for the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus surveillance. In this
study, a total of 2,715 patient nasopharyngeal swab samples were tested by xTAG RVP
and 1265 of these were positive for influenza A. Of the 1265, 1108 were “flu A
unsubtypeable”, 151 were seasonal H3N2 and 6 were seasonal H1N1. Of the 1108
Influenza A unsubtypeable with the xTAG RVP, all were confirmed to be 2009 H1N1
influenza with the CDC rRT-PCR assay.
