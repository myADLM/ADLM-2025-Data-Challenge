This test is intended for use in clinical laboratories or physician office
laboratories. For in vitro diagnostic use only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
S40 Clinical Analyzer
I. Device Description:
The S-Test Hemoglobin A1c reagent cartridges used with the S40 Clinical Analyzer
are intended for quantitative in vitro diagnostic determination of % HbA1c in EDTA
whole blood. The assay uses two bi-reagent single-use cartridges, which are plastic
containers consisting of liquid stable reagents and reaction cavities, together with 2-D
bar code labels. The two bi-reagent cartridges consist of a pre-treatment cartridge
containing protease and N-ethylmaleimide and a measuring cartridge containing N-
(carboxymethylaminocarbonyl) 4-4 ́-bis (dimethylamino) diphenylamine sodium salt,
peroxidase and fructosyl peptide oxidase (FPOX). The bar codes contain all
chemistry parameters, calibration factors, and other information.

L. Test Principle:
In the first reaction, a glycosylated dipeptide is cleaved from the ß-chain N-terminus
of HbA1c by a protease, and the level of total hemoglobin (Hb) is determined using a
bi-chromatic absorbance reading at 600/800 nm. In the second reaction, the
glycosylated dipeptide is treated with fructosyl peptide oxidase (FPOX) to yield
hydrogen peroxide and then, in the presence of peroxidase, (POD), the resulting

hydrogen peroxide is reacted with N-(carboxymethylaminocarbonyl) 4-4 ́-bis
(dimethylamino) diphenylamine sodium salt (color coupler) to form a colored
product. The level of HbA1C is determined by measuring the absorbance of the
colored product bichromatically at 700/800 nm. Percentage (%) of HbA1c is
calculated from the measured levels of total Hb and HbA1c.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Studies were carried out consistent with CLSI EP5-A2. Precision was
determined on the S40 Clinical Analyzer at three % HbA1c levels using
commercially available control material containing intact red blood cells. The
three levels were assayed 2 times per run, 2 runs per day, for a total of 20
days. The mean, standard deviations, and % coefficients of variation (CV)
were calculated for each sample.

Further precision studies were conducted at three separate physician’s office
laboratory (POL) sites using the S40 analyzer. One operator at each site
performed the testing. Studies were carried out in accordance with CLSI EP
10-A3 testing commercially available control material containing intact red
blood cells at three levels. The samples were run three times a day for five
days using one instrument. The results are presented in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The reportable range is 3.8 to 14.0 % HbA1c.
Linearity across the assay range was confirmed by testing commercial
linearity standards with known ratios of HbA1c at 8 levels. Each level was
tested in replicates of four. The percent recoveries ranged from 98 to 104 %.
The linear regression equation obtained for the study was y = 1.001x – 0.025,
r2 = 0.9995.
An additional linearity study was conducted using EDTA whole blood
samples according to CLSI EP6-A, Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative
Measurement Procedures. Two EDTA whole blood samples were mixed in six
different proportions of HbA1c. Each level was tested in replicates of four.
The percent recoveries ranged from 93.7 to 100.0 %. The linear regression
equation obtained for the study was y = 0.9658 + 0.11, r2 = 0.9895. The
samples tested for the studies had values ranging from 3.8 % HbA1c to 15.7
% HbA1c.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The S Test-HbA1c cartridges are factory calibrated and traceable to IFCC
certified standard material. The S test-HbA1c cartridge assay has met the
requirements of the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program
(NGSP). The NGSP certification requires annual renewal. The current list of
NGSP certified methods is available on the NGSP website at:
http://www.ngsp.org/prog/index.html
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range is 3.8 to 14.0 % HbA1c (see linearity section above).

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed according to CLSI guideline EP7-A2 to
determine the effects of bilirubin, triglyceride, ascorbic acid, labile HbA1c
(glucose), acetaldehyde, acetylsalicylic acid, sodium cyanate, and hemoglobin
variants (Hb C, Hb D-Los Angeles, HbE and HbS). Two whole blood samples
with levels of HbA1c ranging from 5.2 to 11.0 % HbA1c were tested for each
interferent.
Bilirubin: No significant interference (≤10%) up to 40 mg/dL
Triglyceride: No significant interference up to 750 mg/dL
Ascorbic acid: No significant interference up to 100 mg/dL
Labile HbA1c (glucose): No significant interference up to 1000 mg/dL
Acetaldehyde hemoglobin: No significant interference up to100 mg/dL
Acetylsalicylic acid: No significant interference up to 100 mg/dL
Sodium cyanate: No significant interference up to 100 mg/dL
Hemoglobin variants (Hb C, Hb D-Los Angeles, HbE and HbS): 16 %
negative interference as stated in labeling
The labeling contains a statement that triglyceride concentrations greater than
750 mg/dL may cause interference.
Studies demonstrated that the HbA1c assay yields accurate results over the
range of 6 to 23 g/dL total Hb. For samples with total Hb results outside this
range, the results will be flagged with a “CALC” error. Samples with normal
and elevated HbA1c values and total hemoglobin concentrations ranging from
4.0 to 25.3 were tested and compared to control samples with known HbA1c
values. Recoveries for samples with total Hb between 6 and 23 g/dL ranged
from 99 to 100%.
