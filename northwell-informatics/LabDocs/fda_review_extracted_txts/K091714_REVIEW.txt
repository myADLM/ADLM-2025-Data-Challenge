510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
k091714
B. Purpose for Submission:
New devices
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Skyfine Incorporated Alcodigital Breathalyzer Models AT576, AT577, AT578, and
AT579
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Quantitative (electrochemical fuel cell sensor)
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The AT576, AT577, AT578, and AT579 models are self-contained units with a
mouthpiece at the top of the device for breath sampling. The AT576 has SET,
TEST, and PRINT buttons. Models AT577, AT578, and AT579 have TEST and
MEMORY buttons. All models have an LCD display that shows the breath
alcohol concentration (BAC) to three decimal places.
2. Principle of Operation:
The electrochemical fuel cell alcohol sensor in this device reacts with exhaled
alcohol from the breath. As the alcohol gas passes through the cell, it initiates a
chemical reaction resulting in a voltage change. This voltage change can then be
converted to a breath alcohol concentration which in turn is converted to a blood
alcohol concentration.
3. Modes of Operation:
This device has only one mode of operation. See section 2 above.
4. Specimen Identification:
There is no mechanism to identify the specimen.

5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The user provides a breath sample by exhaling into the device.
6. Calibration:
The device is calibrated at the factory and sent directly to the end user. The
sponsor recommends a recalibration interval of every 500 tests or every twelve
months. These intervals are based on calibration stability data collected
internally. The unit must be sent back to the factory for calibration.
Traceability:
These devices are traceable to a commercially available certified ethyl alcohol
reference solution.

L. Test Principle:
The electrochemical fuel cell alcohol sensor in this device reacts with exhaled alcohol
from the breath. As the alcohol gas passes through the cell, it initiates a chemical
reaction resulting in a voltage change. This voltage change can then be converted to a
breath alcohol concentration which in turn is converted to a blood alcohol
concentration.
J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
All four models have met the US Department of Transportation/ National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration (NHT SA) requirements for breath alcohol screening
devices.
a. Accuracy:
The sponsor performed a consumer study using model AT579 to determine if
consumers could correctly use and interpret the device using only the
operation manual, and to compare the results to the predicate device. There
were 40 paired comparisons, and the volunteers ranged in age from 21 to 69
years of age. Each participant took their breath alcohol reading with the
model AT579 and recorded the result. Immediately afterward, the participants
were administered a breath alcohol test using the predicate device operated by
a trained individual. The breath alcohol concentrations ranged from BAC of
0.000 % to 0.092 % (by the predicate). Linear regression analysis of the data
showed a slope of 1.0298, a y-intercept of 0.0018 and a correlation coefficient
of 0.9989. After the study, participants were asked questions about ease of use
and interpretation. Participant demographics and responses to the survey are

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
This device was not tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA). Instead, he sponsor performed their own testing on
all four models (AT576, AT577, AT578, and AT579) and collected
performance data using the NHTSA requirements for precision and accuracy
as a guide. For precision and accuracy, these requirements (referred to as
Model Specifications) consist of 20 trials at a Blood Alcohol Concentration
(BAC) of 0.008, 20 trials at a BAC of 0.032, and 20 trials at a BAC of 0.000.
Blood Alcohol Concentrations are simulated in breath by a Breath Alcohol
Sample Simulator (BASS), which provides an alcohol-in-air test sample with
known alcohol concentrations, flow rate, and air composition. The acceptance
criteria for the Model Specifications are: not more than one negative result at
0.032 BAC, not more than one positive result at 0.008 BAC, and not more
than one negative greater than zero and no positives at 0.000 BAC. NOTE: for
the purposes of this study, a BAC of 0.020 is used to distinguish a positive
from a negative result.
The four Alcodigital models met all of the applicable NHTSA requirements
for precision and accuracy.

c. Linearity:
This device will report concentrations from 0.00 to 0.200% BAC for the
AT577, AT578, and AT579 models and from 0.00 to 0.300% BAC for the
AT576 model. However, the DOT Model Specifications require accuracy and
precision testing up to a concentration of 0.032 only; therefore, true linearity
over the entire measuring range of the device was not evaluated. These
devices met all of the applicable NHTSA requirements for precision and
accuracy as described above.
d. Carryover:
Carryover studies are not required by NHTSA and were not performed using
these devices.
e. Interfering Substances:
The DOT Model Specifications require testing with cigarette smoke to assess
any possible interference. Five trials are required at 0.000 BAC. An alcohol
free individual who smokes cigarettes is appropriate for this trial. The subject
is asked to smoke approximately one half of a cigarette. Within one minute
after smoking, or after a waiting period specified in the manufacturer’s
instructions, the subject performs the breath alcohol test according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The subject is then asked to smoke another
inhalation and repeat the test to produce a total of five trials. The acceptance
criterion for this trial is: no positive results. The four Alcodigital models had
no positive results.
Other potential interferents were not evaluated with this device.
2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
a. Limit of Detection
The DOT Model Specifications do not specifically address the detection
limit of breath alcohol devices. However, the devices must be tested at a
BAC of zero (blank reading) to assess the possibility of false positives.
This consists of 20 trials under normal laboratory conditions at a BAC of
0.000. Non-alcoholic human breath is to be used as the sample. For
devices capable of providing a reading of greater than 0.000 BAC and less
than 0.020 BAC, the acceptance criterion is: not more than one such
result. These devices had no false positives in this trial.

--- Page 8 ---
b. Temperature
The DOT Model Specifications require testing 10 and 40o C to assess any
possible effects of temperature. At 10o C, 20 trials are required at 0.008
BAC and 20 trials are required at 0.032 BAC. Acceptance criteria are: not
more than one positive result at 0.008 BAC, and not more than one non-
positive result at 0.032 BAC. The devices had no positive results at 0.008
BAC and no non-positive results at 0.032 BAC. At 40o C, the
requirements are identical. Again the devices had no positive results at
0.008 BAC and no non-positive results at 0.032 BAC.
c. Vibration
The DOT Model Specifications require vibration testing to assess any
possible vibrational effects. Twenty trials are required at 0.008 BAC and
0.032 BAC. Acceptance criteria are: not more than one positive result at
0.008 BAC, and not more than one non-positive result at 0.032 BAC.
These devices had no positive results at 0.008 BAC and no non-positive
results at 0.032 BAC.
d. Cutoff
For the purposes of performance testing, a BAC cutoff of 0.020 was used
to distinguish positive from negative samples.
K. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
L. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports
a substantial equivalence decision.
