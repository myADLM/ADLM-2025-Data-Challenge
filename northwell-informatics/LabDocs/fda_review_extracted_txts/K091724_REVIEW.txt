I. Device Description:
The BD ProbeTecCT Qx Amplified DNA Assay is based on the simultaneous
amplification and detection of target DNA using amplification primers and a
fluorescently-labeled detector probe. The reagents for SDA are dried in two
separate disposable microwells: the Priming Microwell contains the amplification
primers, fluorescently-labeled detector probe, nucleotides and other reagents
necessary for amplification, while the Amplification Microwell contains the two
enzymes (a DNA polymerase and a restriction endonuclease) that are required for
SDA. The BD Viper System pipettes a portion of the purified DNA solution from
each Extraction Tube into a Priming Microwell to rehydrate the contents. After a
brief incubation, the reaction mixture is transferred to a corresponding, pre-
warmed Amplification Microwell which is sealed to prevent contamination and
then incubated in one of the two thermally-controlled fluorescent readers. The
presence or absence of C. trachomatis DNA is determined by calculating the peak
fluorescence (Maximum Relative Fluorescent Units (MaxRFU)) over the course
of the amplification process and by comparing this measurement to a
predetermined threshold value.
In addition to the fluorescent probe used to detect amplified C. trachomatis target
DNA, a second fluorescently-labeled oligonucleotide is incorporated in each
reaction. The Extraction Control (EC) oligonucleotide is labeled with a different
dye than that used for detection of the C. trachomatis-specific target and is used
to confirm the validity of the extraction process. The EC is dried in the Extraction
Tubes and is re-hydrated upon addition of the specimen and extraction reagents.
At the end of the extraction process, the EC fluorescence is monitored by the BD
Viper instrument and an automated algorithm is applied to both the EC and C.
trachomatis-specific signals to report specimen results as positive, negative, or
EC failure.

L. Test Principle:
The BD ProbeTecCT Qx Amplified DNA Assay is based on the simultaneous
amplification and detection of target DNA using amplification primers and a
fluorescently-labeled detector probe (8, 9). The reagents for SDA are dried in two
separate disposable microwells: the Priming Microwell contains the amplification
primers, fluorescently-labeled detector probe, nucleotides and other reagents
necessary for amplification, while the Amplification Microwell contains the two
enzymes (a DNA polymerase and a restriction endonuclease) that are required for

a. Precision/Reproducibility
Reproducibility of the BD Viper System using the BD ProbeTec CT Qx Assay
was evaluated at three clinical sites on one BD Viper System per site. A panel
of simulated specimens was tested that comprised CT and GC organisms
seeded into swab diluent for the BD ProbeTec CT Qx Assay. Simulated
endocervical and urethral specimens contained a clean endocervical swab
whereas the simulated urine and vaginal swab specimens did not. Uninoculated
swab diluent for the BD ProbeTec CT Qx Assay was used for the CT negative
samples. Nine replicates of each panel member were tested every day for five
days on each BD Viper System. The data are summarized on page 20 Table 9.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
Control Set for the BD ProbeTec CT/GC Qx Amplified DNA Assays: 24
CT/GC Qx Positive Control Tubes containing approximately 2400 copies each
of pCTB4 and pGCint3 linearized plasmids in carrier nucleic acid, and 24
CT/GC Qx Negative Controls Tubes containing carrier nucleic acid alone. The
concentrations of the pCTB4 and pGCint3 plasmids are determined by UV
spectrophotometry.
d. Detection limit:
CT QX Assay Analytical Sensitivity:
The Limits of Detection (LODs) for the CT QX Assay with C. trachomatis
serovar H in urine and swab specimens when extracted on the BD Viper
System were determined to be < 15 CT elementary bodies (EB) per mL for
neat and Qx UPT urine and < 30 CT EB per mL for expressed vaginal,
endocervical swab, and BD SurePath specimens. A correlation of EB to
Inclusion-forming units (IFU) suggests that the CT QX assay LODs with
serovar H in urine and swab specimens correspond to < 1 IFU per mL (15).
The CT QX Assay on the BD Viper System in extracted mode was able to
detect 16 isolates representing 15 CT serovars (A, B, Ba, C, D, E (2)*, F, G, H,
I, J, K, LGV1, LGV2, and LGV3) with ≥ 95% proportion positive at a
concentration of 15 EB per mL in CT/GC QX Swab Diluent.
* Testing with CT serovar E included both the type strain and the nvCT strain,
a new variant with a deletion in the cryptic plasmid.
e. Analytical specificity:
DNA from 141 organisms listed in Table 1 was extracted on the BD Viper
System and tested with the BD ProbeTec CT Qx Amplified DNA Assay. All
potential cross-reactive species were tested at > 1x108 cells/mL except where
noted. The CT Qx Assay did not cross-react with any of the organisms tested.

The presence or absence of C. trachomatis DNA is determined by calculating
the peak fluorescence (MaxRFU) over the course of the amplification process
and by comparing this measurement to a predetermined threshold value. The
magnitude of the MaxRFU score is not indicative of the level of organism in
the specimen. If the C. trachomatis-specific signal is greater than or equal to a
threshold of 125 MaxRFU, the EC fluorescence is ignored by the algorithm. If
the C. trachomatis-specific signal is less than a threshold of 125 MaxRFU, the
EC fluorescence is utilized by the algorithm in the interpretationof the result.
If assay control results are not as expected, patient results are not reported.
CT Qx Interfering Substances
The performance of the BD ProbeTec CT Qx Assay on the BD Viper System in
extracted mode was evaluated in the presence of potential interfering substances
which may be encountered in swab, urine and/or BD SurePath specimens.
Potential interfering substances were spiked into Qx UPT urine and vaginal
swab specimen matrices as well as BD SurePath specimens in LBC Specimen
Dilution Tubes, in both the presence and the absence of CT elementary bodies
(30 CT EB/mL in urine matrix and 90 CT EB/mL in swab/LBC Specimen
Dilution Tube matrix). Results are summarized in Table 2.

3. Clinical studies:
Swab and Urine Specimen Clinical Study
Clinician-collected endocervical and male urethral swab specimens, patient-collected
vaginal swab specimens (in a clinical setting), and male and female Qx UPT and neat
urine specimens were collected from 1059 female subjects and 479 male subjects
attending OB/GYN, sexually transmitted disease (STD) and family planning clinics at
seven geographically diverse clinical sites in North America. Subjects were classified
as symptomatic if they reported symptoms such as dysuria, urethral discharge, coital
pain/difficulty/bleeding, testicular or scrotum pain/swelling, abnormal vaginal
discharge, or pelvic/uterine/adnexal pain. Subjects were classified as asymptomatic if
they did not report symptoms. Sixty five female subjects and 7 male subjects were
excluded from the data analysis due to age requirement violations, antibiotic treatment
in the last 21 days, opting to withdraw from the study after initially consenting, failure
to obtain paired swab and urine specimens, urine quantity less than 20 mL, or
transport and storage errors related to specimen collection. Therefore, the final data
analysis included 994 compliant female subjects and 472 compliant male subjects.
Five specimens were collected from each of the 994 eligible female subjects. A urine
specimen was collected and split into Qx UPT, neat urine and the two reference urine
specimen collection devices followed by a vaginal swab specimen and three
randomized endocervical swab specimens. Up to four specimens were collected from
each of the 472 eligible male subjects. Up to three randomized urethral swab
specimens were collected followed by a urine specimen that was split into Qx UPT,
neat urine and the two reference urine specimen collection devices. BD ProbeTec CT
Qx assay results were generated from the Qx UPT and neat urine specimens, the
vaginal swab specimen, one endocervical swab specimen and one male urethral swab
specimen. The remaining two endocervical swab specimens, up to two male urethral
swab specimens, and the two reference urine specimens for each male and female
subject were tested using two reference methods: the BD ProbeTec ET CT/AC assay
and another commercially available NAAT (Nucleic Acid Amplification Test).
Specimen testing was conducted either at the site of specimen collection or at a
designated BD Viper testing site. All performance calculations were based on the total
number of BD ProbeTec CT Qx assays results for endocervical, vaginal and male
urethral swab specimens, and male and female Qx UPT and neat urine specimens
compared to a patient infected status (PIS) algorithm for each gender. In the algorithm,
the designation of a subject as being infected with CT or not was based on
endocervical swab and urine specimen results from the commercially available BD
ProbeTec ET CT/AC assay and the other commercially available NAAT. Subjects
were considered infected with CT if two of the four endocervical swab and urine
8

specimens (or two of the three or four urethral swab and urine specimens) tested
positive in the BD ProbeTec ET CT/AC assay and the other reference NAAT (one
specimen testing positive in each NAAT). Subjects were considered non-infected if
less than two reference NAAT results were positive. A total of 5388 BD ProbeTec CT
Qx assay results was used to calculate sensitivity and specificity. Performance of the
assay with endocervical swabs, patient collected vaginal swab specimens (in a clinical
setting), female UPT and neat urine was assessed in the clinical study. Separate
performance was calculated for specimens collected from pregnant females. For the
latter, sensitivity compared to patient infected status for FS was 62.5% (5/8): the test
and reference NAAT swab specimens were negative; the test and reference NAAT
urine specimens were positive yielding a PIS positive result. FV sensitivity was 75%
(6/8): the test and reference NAAT swab specimens were negative; the test and
reference NAAT urine specimens were positive yielding a PIS positive result. FNU
and FUPT sensitivity were 100% (8/8). Specificity was 94.7% (18/19) for FS, FV,
FNU, and FUPT separately.
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Sensitivity compared to patient infected status for FS was 62.5%(5/8): the test and
reference NAAT swab specimens were negative; the test and reference NAAT urine
specimens werepositive yielding a PIS positive result. FV sensitivity was 75% (6/8):
the test and reference NAAT swab specimens werenegative; the test and reference
NAAT urine specimens were positive yielding a PIS positive result. FNU and FUPT
sensitivity were 100% (8/8).
Neat and Qx UPT Urine Stability
Pools of CT negative male and female urine specimens were used in analytical
experiments to support the urine storage and transport stability claims.
For neat urine, pools were co-spiked with CT serovar H and GC strain ATCC 19424 at
45 EB per mL and 150 cells per mL, respectively. Neat urine specimens were stored
at either 2-8oC for 1, 3 or 7 days; or at 30oC for 8, 24 or 30 h; or at -20oC for 180 days.
At each time point, samples were removed from storage and tested with the BD
ProbeTec CT Qx Assay on the BD Viper System in extracted mode. Thirty-two assay
replicates were generated for each condition (sample type/temperature/duration). The
expected results were obtained with the CT Qx assay under all conditions tested.
For Qx UPT urine, pooled specimens were co-spiked with CT serovar H and GC strain
ATCC 19424 at 45 EB per mL and 150 cells per mL, respectively. The spiked urine
specimen pools were then stored at either 2-8oC for 24 h or 30oC for 8 h prior to
transfer into Qx UPT tubes. The Qx UPT specimen pools were then stored either at 2-
8oC for 14, 21 or 30 days; or at 30oC for 14, 21 or 30 days; or at -20oC for 180 days.
At each time point Qx UPT specimens were removed from storage and tested with the
BD ProbeTec CT Qx Assay on the BD Viper System in extracted mode. Thirty-two
assay replicates were generated for each condition (sample type/temperature/duration).
The expected results were obtained with the CT Qx assay under all conditions tested.

Vaginal Dry and Expressed Swab Stability
Pools of CT negative vaginal swab matrix were used in analytical experiments to
support the storage and transport stability claims for dry vaginal swab specimens.
Pools were co-spiked with CT serovar H and GC strain ATCC 19424 to achieve 90
EB per mL and 300 cells per mL, respectively, when seeded onto swabs and expressed
in CT/GC Qx Swab Diluent. Seeded dry swabs were stored at 2-8oC for 3, 7, or 14
days; or at 30oC for 3, 7 or 14 days; or at -20oC for 30, 60, or 180 days. At each time
point, dry swabs were removed from storage and expressed into 2 mL of CT/GC Qx
Swab Diluent and evaluated with the BD ProbeTec CT Qx Assay on the BD Viper
System in extracted mode. Thirty-two assay replicates were generated for each
condition (sample type/temperature/duration). The expected results were obtained with
the CT Qx assay under all conditions tested.
Pools of CT negative vaginal swab matrix were used in analytical experiments to
support the storage and transport stability claims for expressed vaginal swab
specimens. Pools were spiked with CT serovar H and GC strain ATCC 19424 to
achieve 90 EB per mL and 300 cells per mL, respectively. The spiked swab matrix
was stored at 2-8oC for 7, 14 or 30 days; or at 30oC for 7, 14 or 30 days; or at -20oC
for 30, 60, or 180 days. At each time point, samples were removed from storage and
tested with the BD ProbeTec CT Qx Assay on the BD Viper System in extracted
mode. Thirty-two assay replicates were generated for each condition (sample
type/temperature/duration). The expected results were obtained with the CT Qx assay
under all conditions tested.
Endocervical and Urethral Swab Specimen Stability
Pools of CT negative endocervical swab matrix were used in analytical experiments to
support the storage and transport stability claims for endocervical and urethral swab
specimens. Pools of swab matrix were spiked with CT serovar H and GC strain
ATCC 19424 at 90 EB per mL and 300 cells per mL, respectively. The pools were
dispensed in 2 mL volumes into BD sample tubes to simulate “wet” endocervical
specimens and stored at either 2-8oC for 7, 14 or 30 days; or at 30oC for 7, 14 or 30
days; or at -20oC for 30, 60, or 180 days. At each time point, samples were removed
from storage and tested with the BD ProbeTec CT Qx Assay on the BD Viper System
in extracted mode. Thirty-two assay replicates were generated for each condition
(sample type/temperature/duration). The expected results were obtained with the CT
Qx assay under all conditions tested.
Post Pre-warm Specimen Stability
Pools of male and female CT negative neat urine were used in analytical experiments
to support the storage stability claims for pre-warmed neat and Qx UPT urine
specimens. Pooled specimens were spiked with CT serovar H and GC strain ATCC
19424 at 45 EB per mL and 150 cells per mL, respectively and either added to Qx UPT
tubes or left untreated as neat urine. Both specimen types were pre-warmed at 114°C
for 15 min, and cooled for 15 min. After the pre-warm process, specimen tubes were
stored at either 2-8oC for 1, 3 or 7 days; or at 30oC for 1, 3 or 7 days; or at -20oC for
30 or 180 days. At each time point samples were removed from storage and tested

with the BD ProbeTec CT Qx Assay on the BD Viper System in extracted mode.
Thirty-two assay replicates were generated for each condition (sample
type/temperature/duration). The expected results were obtained with the CT Qx assay
under all conditions tested.
Pools of CT negative vaginal and endocervical swab specimen matrices in CT/GC Qx
Swab Diluent were used in analytical experiments to support the storage stability
claims for pre-warmed expressed vaginal, endocervical, and male urethral swab
specimens. For both types of matrix, pooled specimens were spiked with CT serovar H
and GC strain ATCC 19424 at 90 EB per mL and 300 cells per mL, respectively and
aliquotted into 2 mL volumes in BD specimen tubes. The tubes were pre-warmed at
114°C for 15 min and cooled for 15 min. After the pre-warm process, the specimen
tubes were stored either at 2-8oC for 3 or 7 days; or at 30oC for 3 or 7 days; or at -20oC
for 30 or 180 days. At each time point, samples were removed from storage and tested
with the BD ProbeTec CT Qx Assay on the BD Viper System in extracted mode.
Thirty-two assay replicates were generated for each condition (sample
type/temperature/duration). The expected results were obtained with the CT Qx assay
under all conditions tested.
BD SurePath Specimen Stability
Pools of CT and GC negative BD SurePath clinical specimens were used in analytical
experiments to support the storage and stability claims. Pools were co-spiked with CT
serovar H and GC strain ATCC 19424 to achieve 90 EB per mL and 300 cells per mL,
respectively. The pools were dispensed in 10 mL volumes in BD SurePath vials and
stored at either 2-8oC or 30oC. After 30 days, 0.5 mL from each vial was removed and
added to an LBC Specimen Dilution Tube. The specimens in the LBC Specimen
Dilution Tube were then stored at 2-8oC for 30 or 90 days; or at 30oC for 30 or 90
days; or at -20oC for 90 days. At each time point, samples were removed from storage
and tested with the BD ProbeTec CT Qx Assay on the BD Viper System in extracted
mode. Twenty-four assay replicates were generated for each condition
(temperature/duration). The expected results were obtained with the CT Qx assay
under all conditions tested.
Hypothetical positive and negative predictive values (PPV & NPV) for the CT Qx
Assay with swab and urine specimens are shown in Table 3A. Hypothetical positive
and negative predictive values (PPV & NPV) for the CT Qx Assay from the multi-
center clinical trial for BD SurePath specimens are shown in Table 3B. Hypothetical
positive and negative predictive values (PPV & NPV) for the CT Qx Assay from the
multi-center clinical trial for PreservCyt specimens are shown in Table 3C. These
calculations are based on hypothetical prevalence and overall sensitivity and
specificity (compared to the patient infected status) of 94.5% and 98.9% for swab and
urine specimens, of 95.0% and 99.7% for BD SurePath specimens, and of 94.1% and
99.8% for PreservCyt specimens.

Swab and Urine Specimen Clinical Study
Clinician-collected endocervical and male urethral swab specimens, patient-
collected vaginal swab specimens (in a clinical setting), and male and female
Qx UPT and neat urine specimens were collected from 1059 female subjects
and 479 male subjects attending OB/GYN, sexually transmitted disease (STD)
and family planning clinics at seven geographically diverse clinical sites in
North America. Subjects were classified as symptomatic if they reported
symptoms such as dysuria, urethral discharge, coital pain/difficulty/bleeding,
testicular or scrotum pain/swelling, abnormal vaginal discharge, or
pelvic/uterine/adnexal pain. Subjects were classified as asymptomatic if they
did not report symptoms. Sixty five female subjects and 7 male subjects were
excluded from the data analysis due to age requirement violations, antibiotic
treatment in the last 21 days, opting to withdraw from the study after initially
consenting, failure to obtain paired swab and urine specimens, urine quantity
less than 20 mL, or transport and storage errors related to specimen collection.

Therefore, the final data analysis included 994 compliant female subjects and
472 compliant male subjects.
Five specimens were collected from each of the 994 eligible female subjects.
A urine specimen was collected and split into Qx UPT, neat urine and the two
reference urine specimen collection devices followed by a vaginal swab
specimen and three randomized endocervical swab specimens. Up to four
specimens were collected from each of the 472 eligible male subjects. Up to
three randomized urethral swab specimens were collected followed by a urine
specimen that was split into Qx UPT, neat urine and the two reference urine
specimen collection devices. BD ProbeTec CT Qx assay results were
generated from the Qx UPT and neat urine specimens, the vaginal swab
specimen, one endocervical swab specimen and one male urethral swab
specimen. The remaining two endocervical swab specimens, up to two male
urethral swab specimens, and the two reference urine specimens for each male
and female subject were tested using two reference methods: the BD ProbeTec
ET CT/AC assay and another commercially available NAAT (Nucleic Acid
Amplification Test). Specimen testing was conducted either at the site of
specimen collection or at a designated BD Viper testing site.
All performance calculations were based on the total number of BD ProbeTec
CT Qx assays results for endocervical, vaginal and male urethral swab
specimens, and male and female Qx UPT and neat urine specimens compared
to a patient infected status (PIS) algorithm for each gender. In the algorithm,
the designation of a subject as being infected with CT or not was based on
endocervical swab and urine specimen results from the commercially available
BD ProbeTec ET CT/GC/AC assay and the other commercially available
NAAT. Subjects were considered infected with CT if two of the four
endocervical swab and urine specimens (or two of the three or four urethral
swab and urine specimens) tested positive in the BD ProbeTec ET CT/AC
assay and the other reference NAAT (one specimen testing positive in each
NAAT). Subjects were considered non-infected if less than two reference
NAAT results were positive. A total of 5388 BD ProbeTec CT Qx assay results
was used to calculate sensitivity and specificity.
Performance of the assay with endocervical swabs, patient collected vaginal
swab specimens (in a clinical setting), female UPT and neat urine was assessed
in the clinical study. Separate performance was calculated for specimens
collected from pregnant females. Sensitivity compared to patient infected
status for FS was 62.5% (5/8): the test and reference NAAT swab specimens
were negative; the test and reference NAAT urine specimens were positive
yielding a PIS positive result. FV sensitivity was 75% (6/8): the test and
reference NAAT swab specimens were negative; the test and reference NAAT
urine specimens were positive yielding a PIS positive result. FNU and FUPT
sensitivity were 100% (8/8). Specificity was 94.7% (18/19) for FS, FV, FNU,
and FUPT separately.

BD SurePath Specimen Clinical Study
Endocervical swab specimens and BD SurePath specimens were collected
from 1728 compliant female subjects attending family planning, OB/GYN, and
sexually transmitted disease clinics at eleven geographically diverse clinical
sites in North America. Subjects were classified as symptomatic if they
reported symptoms such as dysuria, coital pain/difficulty/bleeding, abnormal
vaginal discharge, or pelvic/uterine/adnexal pain. Subjects were classified as
asymptomatic if they did not report symptoms.
Three randomized endocervical swab specimens and a BD SurePath specimen
were collected from each female subject. The three reference endocervical
swabs were tested with the BD ProbeTec ET CT/GC/AC assay, the BD
ProbeTec CT Qx assay, and another commercially available NAAT (Nucleic
Acid Amplification Test). Sensitivity and specificity for BD SurePath
specimens were calculated by comparing results to a patient infected status
(PIS) algorithm. The designation of positive or negative PIS was based on the
endocervical swab specimen results from the three reference methods. At least
two positive reference results were required to establish a subject as PIS-
positive. At least two negative reference results were required to establish a
subject as PIS-negative.
The distribution of cervical sampling devices used in the clinical study
according to clinical collection site is summarized in Table 6.
Table 7 summarizes the number of results from symptomatic and
asymptomatic subjects designated as infected or non-infected with CT
according to the PIS algorithm.

Note: For female subjects, infections localized to the endocervix or urethra have been reported in the literature (16-20).
Analyses were performed on the endocervical swab specimens and female UPT and neat urine specimens to further
characterize the ten negative female endocervical swabs (105/115) and the eight negative female UPT and neat urine
specimens (107/115).
• Of the 115 female subjects defined as positive by the PIS algorithm, ten had infections localized to the urethra as
indicated by the urine reference result (i.e, BD ProbeTec ET CT/AC assay and other NAAT endocervical swab
specimens were negative, BD ProbeTec ET CT/AC assay and other NAAT urine specimens were positive.) The BD
ProbeTec CT Qx assay was negative for nine of the ten endocervical swab specimens from these subjects.
• Of the 115 female subjects defined as positive by the PIS algorithm, three had infections localized to the endocervix
as indicated by the endocervical reference result (i.e, BD ProbeTec ET CT/AC assay and other NAAT urine
specimens were negative, BD ProbeTec ET CT/AC assay and other NAAT endocervical swab specimens were
positive.) The BD ProbeTec CT Qx assay was negative for UPT and neat urine for these three subjects.

Reproducibility
Reproducibility of the BD Viper System using the BD ProbeTec CT Qx Assay was evaluated at three
clinical sites on one BD Viper System per site. A panel of simulated specimens was tested that
comprised CT and GC organisms seeded into swab diluent for the BD ProbeTec CT Qx Assay.
Simulated endocervical and urethral specimens contained a clean endocervical swab whereas the
1 Of the 1728 compliant female subjects, 14 subjects did not have a CT Qx assay result for the BD SurePath specimen, therefore the final data analysis included 1714
compliant female subjects.

A second study was conducted internally to characterize the reproducibility of test results (i.e., proportion positive or
negative) at target levels below the analytical Limit of Detection (LOD) of the BD ProbeTec CT Qx Assay. A panel of
simulated specimens was tested that comprised CT and GC organisms seeded into swab diluent at two different levels
(1:10, 1:100) each of which was below the analytical LOD for the respective organism. These levels were selected to fall
within the dynamic range of the analytical LOD curve for this assay. Fifteen replicates of each panel member were tested
every day for five days across three BD Viper Systems. The data are summarized in Table 10.

System. The data are summarized in Table 13. Two additional target levels were included in the panels to characterize
the reproducibility of test results (i.e., proportion positive or negative) at target levels below the analytical Limit of
Detection (LOD) of the BD ProbeTec CT Qx Assay. These additional specimens comprised CT and GC organisms
seeded into LBC Specimen Dilution Tubes containing LBC medium at dilutions of 1:10 and 1:100 of the respective
analytical LODs of each analyte. These levels were selected to fall within the dynamic range of the analytical LOD
curves for the BD ProbeTec CT Qx and GC Qx assays. Nine replicates of each panel member were tested every day for
five days across the three BD Viper Systems. The data are summarized in Tables 11 and 12.

System Cross Contamination and Carryover
An internal study was conducted to evaluate the risk of producing a false positive
result in either the same run on the BD Viper System in extracted mode (within run
cross-contamination) or in a subsequent run (between run carryover). Testing was
conducted using negative and positive samples on three BD Viper Systems. Negative
samples consisted of CT/GC Qx Swab Diluent/LBC Specimen Dilution Tube with
PreservCyt Solution. Positive samples consisted of a representative analyte (at 105 CT
EB/mL) spiked into CT/GC Qx Swab Diluent/LBC Specimen Dilution Tube with
PreservCyt Solution. The overall rate of cross-contamination (i.e., with alternating
columns of positive and negative samples and a prevalence of 50%) was 0.41%
(9/2208) for the CT/GC Qx Swab diluent and 0.45% (5/1104) for the LBC Specimen
Dilution Tube with PreservCyt Solution. The overall rate of carryover contamination
(i.e., carryover between successive runs when the prevalence was 50% in the previous
run) was 0.36% (8/2208) for the CT/GC Qx Swab diluent and 0.54% (6/1104) for the
LBC Specimen Dilution Tube with PreservCyt Solution. Cross-contamination and
carryover rates across the three BD Viper Systems are summarized in Tables 13 and
14.
