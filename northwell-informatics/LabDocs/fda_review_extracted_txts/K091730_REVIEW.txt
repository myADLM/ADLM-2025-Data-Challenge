I. Device Description:
x
The BD ProbeTec GC Q Amplified DNA Assay is based on the simultaneous
amplification and detection of target DNA using amplification primers and a
fluorescently-labeled detector probe. The reagents for SDA are dried in two separate
disposable microwells: the Priming Microwell contains the amplification primers,
fluorescently-labeled detector probe, nucleotides and other reagents necessary for
amplification, while the Amplification Microwell contains the two enzymes (a DNA
polymerase and a restriction endonuclease) that are required for SDA. The BD
ViperTMSystem pipettes a portion of the purified DNA solution from each Extraction
Tube into a Priming Microwell to rehydrate the contents. After a brief incubation, the
reaction mixture is transferred to a corresponding, pre-warmed Amplification
Microwell which is sealed to prevent contamination and then incubated in one of the
two thermally-controlled fluorescent readers. The presence or absence of N.
gonorrhoeae DNA is determined by calculating the peak fluorescence (Maximum
Relative Fluorescent Units (MaxRFU)) over the course of the amplification process
and by comparing this measurement to a predetermined threshold value. In addition
to the fluorescent probe used to detect amplified N. gonorrhoeae target DNA, a
second labeled oligonucleotide is incorporated in each reaction. The Extraction
Control (EC) oligonucleotide is labeled with a different dye than that used for
detection of the N. gonorrhoeae -specific target and is used to confirm the validity of
the extraction process. The EC is dried in the Extraction Tubes and is rehydrated
upon addition of the specimen and extraction reagents. At the end of the extraction
process, the EC fluorescence is monitored by the BD Viper System and an automated
algorithm is applied to both the EC and N. gonorrhoeae -specific signals to report
results as positive, negative, or EC failure.

L. Test Principle:
When used with the BD Viper System, the BD ProbeTec GC Qx Amplified DNA
Assay involves automated extraction of DNA from clinical specimens through the
chemical lysis of cells, followed by binding of DNA to para-magnetic particles,
washing of the bound nucleic acid and elution in an amplification-compatible buffer.
When present, N. gonorrhoeae DNA is then detected by Strand Displacement
Amplification (SDA) of a specific target sequence in the presence of a fluorescently
labeled detector probe.

pain/difficulty/bleeding, testicular or scrotum pain/swelling, abnormal vaginal
discharge, or pelvic/uterine/adnexal pain. Subjects were classified as asymptomatic if
they did not report symptoms. Sixty five female subjects and 13 male subjects were
excluded from the data analysis due to age requirement violations, antibiotic
treatment in the last 21 days, opting to withdraw from the study after initially
consenting, failure to obtain paired swab and urine specimens, urine quantity less than
20 mL, or transport and storage errors related to specimen collection. Therefore, the
final data analysis included 994 compliant female subjects and 774 compliant male
subjects.
Five specimens were collected from each of the 994 eligible female subjects. A urine
specimen was collected and split into Qx UPT, neat urine and the two reference urine
specimen collection devices followed by a vaginal swab specimen and three
randomized endocervical swab specimens. Up to four specimens were collected from
each of the 774 eligible male subjects. Up to three randomized urethral swab
specimens were collected followed by a urine specimen that was split into Qx UPT,
neat urine and the two reference urine specimen collection devices. BD ProbeTec
GC Qx assay results were generated from the Qx UPT and neat urine specimens, the
vaginal swab specimen, one endocervical swab specimen and one male urethral swab
specimen. The remaining two endocervical swab specimens, up to two male urethral
swab specimens, and the two reference urine specimens for each male and female
subject were tested using two reference methods: the BD ProbeTec ET CT/GC/AC
assay and another commercially available NAAT (Nucleic Acid Amplification Test).
Specimen testing was conducted either at the site of collection or at a designated BD
Viper testing site.
All performance calculations were based on the total number of BD ProbeTec GC Qx
assays results for endocervical, vaginal and male urethral swab specimens, and male
and female Qx UPT and neat urine specimens compared to a patient infected status
(PIS) algorithm for each gender. In the algorithm, the designation of a subject as
being infected with GC or not was based on endocervical swab and urine specimen
results from the commercially available BD ProbeTec ET CT/GC/AC assay and the
other commercially available NAAT. Subjects were considered infected with GC if
two of the four endocervical swab and urine specimens (or two of the three or four
urethral swab and urine specimens) tested positive in the BD ProbeTec ET GC/AC
assay and the other reference NAAT (one specimen testing positive in each NAAT).
Subjects were considered non-infected if less than two reference NAAT results were
positive. A total of 6284 BD ProbeTec GC Qx assay results from symptomatic and
asymptomatic female and male subjects was used to calculate sensitivity and
specificity. Sensitivity and specificity by specimen type and symptomatic status are
presented in Table 6A.
Performance of the assay with endocervical swabs, patient collected vaginal swabs
specimens (in a clinical setting), female UPT and neat urine was assessed in the
clinical study. Separate performance was calculated for specimens collected from
pregnant females. Sensitivity compared to patient infected status for FS, FV, FNU,
9

--- Page 10 ---
and FUPT was 100% (3/3). In each case, specificity was 100% (24/24) for FS, FV,
FNU, and FUPT separately.
Table 9A summarizes the number of results from symptomatic and asymptomatic
female subjects for swabs and urine specimens designated as infected or non-infected
with GC according to the PIS algorithm. Table 9B summarizes the number of results
from symptomatic and asymptomatic male subjects for swab and urine specimens
designated as infected or non-infected with GC according to the PIS algorithm. Table
9C summarizes the number of results from symptomatic and asymptomatic female
subjects for BD SurePath specimens designated as infected or non-infected with GC
according to the PIS algorithm.
BD SurePath Specimen Clinical Study:
Endocervical swab specimens and BD SurePath specimens were collected from 1728
compliant female subjects attending family planning, OB/GYN, and sexually
transmitted disease clinics at eleven geographically diverse clinical sites in North
America. Subjects were classified as symptomatic if they reported symptoms such as
dysuria, coital pain/difficulty/bleeding, abnormal vaginal discharge, or
pelvic/uterine/adnexal pain. Subjects were classified as asymptomatic if they did not
report symptoms.
Three randomized endocervical swab specimens and a BD SurePath specimen were
collected from each female subject. The three reference endocervical swabs were
tested with the BD ProbeTec ET CT/GC/AC assay, the BD ProbeTec GC Qx assay,
and another commercially available NAAT (Nucleic Acid Amplification Test).
Sensitivity and specificity for BD SurePath specimens were calculated by comparing
results to a patient infected status (PIS) algorithm. The designation of positive or
negative PIS was based on the endocervical swab specimen results from the three
reference methods. At least two positive reference results were required to establish a
subject as PIS-positive. At least two negative reference results were required to
establish a subject as PIS-negative. Sensitivity and specificity by symptomatic status
are presented in Table 6B.
The distribution of cervical sampling devices used in the clinical study according to
clinical collection site is summarized in Table 5.
Table 8 summarizes the GC Qx assay performance for BD SurePath specimens
compared to PIS by clinic type.
Table 9C summarizes the number of results from symptomatic and asymptomatic
subjects designated as infected or non-infected with GC according to the PIS
algorithm.

GC QX Assay Analytical Sensitivity:
The Limits of Detection (LODs) for the GC Qx Assay with Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain
ATCC 19424 in urine and swab specimens when extracted on the BD Viper System were
determined to be < 50 cells per mL for neat and Qx UPT urine and < 100 GC cells per mL
for expressed vaginal, endocervical swab, and BD SurePath specimens.
The GC Qx Assay on the BD Viper System in extracted mode was able to detect 17 GC
strains (ATCC 19424, 27628, 27629, 27630, 27632, 27633, 27631, 21823, 51803, 23051,
31407, 31953, 35201, 31397, 31151, 43785, 51804) with ≥ 95% proportion positive at a
concentration of 50 cells per mL in CT/GC Qx Swab Diluent.
GC QX Assay Analytical Specificity:
DNA from 141 organisms listed in Table 10 was extracted on the BD Viper System and
tested with the BD ProbeTec GC Qx Amplified DNA Assay. All potential cross-reactive
species were tested at > 1x108 cells/mL except where noted. Two N. cinerea and two N.
lactamica strains were shown to cross-react in the GC Qx assay.

GC Qx Interfering Substances:
The performance of the BD ProbeTec GC Qx Assay on the BD Viper System in extracted
mode was evaluated in the presence of potential interfering substances which may be
encountered in swab, urine, and/or BD SurePath specimens. Potential interfering
substances were spiked into UPT urine and vaginal swab specimen matrices as well as
BD SurePath specimens in LBC Specimen Dilution Tubes, in both the presence and the
absence of GC organisms (150 GC cells/mL in urine matrix and 300 GC cells/mL in
swab/LBC Specimen Dilution Tube matrix). Results are summarized in Table 11.

Neat and Qx UPT Urine Stability:
Pools of GC negative male and female urine specimens were used in analytical
experiments to support the urine storage and transport stability claims. For neat urine,
pools were co-spiked with CT serovar H and GC strain ATCC 19424 at 45 EB per mL
and 150 cells per mL, respectively. Neat urine specimens were stored at either 2-8oC for
1, 3 or 7 days; or at 30oC for 8, 24 or 30 h; or at -20oC for 180 days. At each time point,
samples were removed from storage and tested with the BD ProbeTec GC Qx Assay on
the BD Viper System in extracted mode. Thirty-two assay replicates were generated for
each condition (sample type/temperature/duration). The expected results were obtained
with the GC Qx assay under all conditions tested.
For Qx UPT urine, pooled specimens were co-spiked with CT serovar H and GC strain
ATCC 19424 at 45 EB per mL and 150 cells per mL, respectively. The spiked urine
specimen pools were then stored at either 2-8oC for 24 h or 30oC for 8 h prior to transfer
into Qx UPT tubes. The Qx UPT specimens were then stored either at 2-8oC for 14, 21 or
30 days; or at 30oC for 14, 21 or 30 days; or at -20oC for 180 days. At each time point Qx
UPT specimens were removed from storage and tested with the BD ProbeTec GC Qx

were obtained with the GC Qx assay under all conditions tested.
Vaginal Dry and Expressed Swab Stability:
Pools of GC negative vaginal swab matrix were used in analytical experiments to
support the storage and transport stability claims for dry vaginal swab specimens. Pools
were co-spiked with CT serovar H and GC strain ATCC 19424 to achieve 90 EB per mL
and 300 cells per mL, respectively, when seeded onto swabs and expressed in CT/GC Qx
Swab Diluent. Seeded dry swabs were stored at 2-8oC for 3, 7, or 14 days; or at 30oC for
3, 7 or 14 days; or at -20oC for 30, 60, or 180 days. At each time point, dry swabs were
removed from storage and expressed into 2 mL of CT/GC Qx Swab Diluent and evaluated
with the BD ProbeTec GC Qx Assay on the BD Viper System in extracted mode. Thirty-
two assay replicates were generated for each condition (sample
type/temperature/duration). The expected results were obtained with the GC Qx assay
under all conditions tested.
Pools of GC negative vaginal swab matrix were used in analytical experiments to support
the storage and transport stability claims for expressed vaginal swab specimens. Pools
were spiked with CT serovar H and GC strain ATCC 19424 to achieve 90 EB per mL and
300 cells per mL, respectively. The spiked swab matrix was stored at 2-8oC for 7, 14 or
30 days; or at 30oC for 7, 14 or 30 days; or at -20oC for 30, 60, or 180 days. At each time
point, samples were removed from storage and tested with the BD ProbeTec GC Qx
Assay on the BD Viper System in extracted mode. Thirty-two assay replicates were
generated for each condition (sample type/temperature/duration). The expected results
were obtained with the GC Qx assay under all conditions tested.
Endocervical and Urethral Swab Specimen Stability:
Pools of GC negative endocervical swab matrix were used in analytical experiments to
support the storage and transport stability claims for endocervical and urethral swab
specimens. Pools of swab matrix were spiked with CT serovar H and GC strain ATCC
19424 at 90 EB per mL and 300 cells per mL, respectively. The pools were dispensed in
2 mL volumes into BD sample tubes to simulate “wet” endocervical specimens and
stored at either 2-8oC for 7, 14 or 30 days; or at 30oC for 7, 14 or 30 days; or at -20oC for
30, 60, or 180 days. At each time point, samples were removed from storage and tested
with the BD ProbeTec GC Qx Assay on the BD Viper System in extracted mode. Thirty-
two assay replicates were generated for each condition (sample type/temperature/
duration). The expected results were obtained with the GC Qx assay under all conditions
tested.
Post Pre-warm Specimen Stability:
Pools of male and female GC negative neat urine specimens were used in analytical
experiments to support the storage stability claims for pre-warmed neat and Qx UPT urine
specimens. Pooled specimens were spiked with CT serovar H and GC strain ATCC
19424 at 45 EB per mL and 150 cells per mL, respectively and either added to Qx UPT
22

tubes or left untreated as neat urine. Both specimen types were pre-warmed at 114°C for
15 min, and cooled for 15 min. After the pre-warm process, specimen tubes were stored
at either 2-8oC for 1, 3 or 7 days; or at 30oC for 1, 3 or 7 days; or at -20oC for 30 or 180
days. At each time point samples were removed from storage and tested with the BD
ProbeTec GC Qx Assay on the BD Viper System in extracted mode. Thirty-two assay
replicates were generated for each condition (sample type/temperature/duration). The
expected results were obtained with the GC Qx assay under all conditions tested.
Pools of GC negative vaginal and endocervical swab specimen matrices in CT/GC Qx
Swab Diluent were used in analytical experiments to support the storage stability claims
for pre-warmed expressed vaginal, endocervical, and male urethral swab specimens. For
both types of matrix, pooled specimens were spiked with CT serovar H and GC strain
ATCC 19424 at 90 EB per mL and 300 cells per mL, respectively and aliquotted into 2
mL volumes in BD specimen tubes. The tubes were pre-warmed at 114°C for 15 min and
cooled for 15 min. After the pre-warm process, the specimen tubes were stored either at
2-8oC for 3 or 7 days; or at 30oC for 3 or 7 days; or at -20oC for 30 or 180 days. At each
time point, samples were removed from storage and tested with the BD ProbeTec GC Qx
Assay on the BD Viper System in extracted mode. Thirty-two assay replicates were
generated for each condition (sample type/temperature/duration). The expected results
were obtained with the GC Qx assay under all conditions tested.
BD SurePath Specimen Stability:
Pools of CT and GC negative BD SurePath clinical specimens were used in analytical
experiments to support the storage and stability claims. Pools were co-spiked with CT
serovar H and GC strain ATCC 19424 to achieve 90 EB per mL and 300 cells per mL,
respectively. The pools were dispensed in 10 mL volumes in BD SurePath vials and
stored at either 2-8oC or 30oC. After 30 days, 0.5 mL from each vial was removed and
added to an LBC Specimen Dilution Tube The specimens in the LBC Dilution Tube
were then stored at 2-8oC for 30 or 90 days; or at 30oC for 30 or 90 days; or at -20oC for
90 days. At each time point, samples were removed from storage and tested with the BD
ProbeTec GC Qx Assay on the BD Viper System in extracted mode. Twenty-four assay
replicates were generated for each condition (temperature/duration). The expected results
were obtained with the GC Qx assay under all conditions tested.
Reproducibility:
Reproducibility of the BD Viper System using the BD ProbeTec GC Qx Assay was
evaluated at three clinical sites on one BD Viper System per site. A panel of simulated
specimens was tested that comprised CT and GC organisms seeded into swab diluent for
the BD ProbeTec GC Qx Assay. Simulated endocervical and urethral specimens
contained a clean endocervical swab whereas the simulated urine and vaginal swab
specimens did not. Uninoculated swab diluent for the BD ProbeTec GC Qx Assay was
used for the GC negative samples. Nine replicates of each panel member were tested
every day for five days on each BD Viper System. The data are summarized in Table
12A.

A second study was conducted internally to characterize the reproducibility of test results
(i.e., proportion positive or negative) at target levels below the analytical Limit of
Detection (LOD) of the BD ProbeTec GC Qx Assay. A panel of simulated specimens
was tested that comprised GC and CT organisms seeded into Qx swab diluent at two
different levels each of which was below the respective analytical LOD for the organisms
(1:10, 1:100). These levels were selected to fall within the dynamic range of the
analytical LOD curve of the assay. Fifteen replicates of each panel member were tested
every day for five days across three BD Viper Systems. The data are summarized in
Table 12B.

A reproducibility study of the BD Viper System using the BD ProbeTec GC Qx Assay
was also evaluated for Liquid Based Cytology (LBC) specimens at three clinical sites on
one BD Viper System per site. A panel of simulated specimens comprising CT and GC
organisms seeded into LBC Specimen Dilution Tubes containing LBC medium was
tested with the BD ProbeTec GC Qx Assay. Uninoculated LBC Specimen Dilution
Tubes containing LBC medium were used for the GC negative samples. Nine replicates
of each panel member were tested every day for five days on each BD Viper System.
The data are summarized in Table 16C. Two additional levels were included in the panels
to characterize the reproducibility of test results (i.e., proportion positive or negative) at
target levels below the analytical Limit of Detection (LOD) of the BD ProbeTec GC Qx
Assay. These additional specimens comprised CT and GC organisms seeded into LBC
Specimen Dilution Tubes containing LBC medium at dilutions of 1:10 and 1:100 of the
respective analytical LODs of each analyte. These levels were selected to fall within the
dynamic range of the analytical LOD curves for the BD ProbeTec CT Qx and GC Qx
assays. Nine replicates of each panel member were tested every day for five days across
the three BD Viper Systems. The data are summarized in Table 12D.

System Cross Contamination and Carryover:
An internal study was conducted to evaluate the risk of producing a false positive result
in either the same run on the BD Viper System in extracted mode (within run cross-
contamination) or in a subsequent run (between run carryover). Testing was conducted
using negative and positive samples on three BD Viper Systems. Negative samples
consisted of CT/GC Qx Swab Diluent/LBC Specimen Dilution Tube with PreservCyt
Solution. Positive samples consisted of a representative analyte (105 CT EB/mL) spiked
into CT/GC Qx Swab Diluent/LBC Specimen Dilution Tube with PreservCyt Solution.
The overall rate of cross-contamination (i.e., with alternating columns of positive and
negative samples and a prevalence of 50%) was 0.41% (9/2208) for the CT/GC Qx Swab
Diluent and 0.45% (5/1104) for the LBC Specimen Dilution Tube with PreservCyt
Solution. The overall rate of carryover contamination (i.e., carryover between successive
runs when the prevalence was 50% in the previous run) was 0.36% (8/2208) for the
CT/GC Qx Swab diluent and 0.54% (6/1104) for the LBC Specimen Dilution Tube with
PreservCyt Solution. Cross-contamination and carryover rates across the three BD Viper
Systems are summarized in Tables 13 and 14.

N. Instrument:
BD Viper™ System in extracted mode with the addition of the CTQ and GCQ Assays:
The BD Viper System with the capability of automated nucleic acid extraction is the third
generation of the BD Viper robotic platform for amplified DNA analysis. The system
builds upon its predecessors, the BD Viper Instrument (K023955) and the BD Viper
System (K052481).
O. System Descriptions:
Viewing the BD Viper System from the perspective of assay workflow, the level of
automation added to enable automated nucleic acid extraction on the existing BD Viper
System includes the following:
(1) Chemical lysis of organisms in clinical specimens,
(2) Chemical extraction and purification of DNA using paramagnetic particles
facilitated by employment of an extractor block containing a movable magnet
assembly;
(3) Elution of extracted DNA into SDA-compatible buffer; and
(4) Transfer of the eluate from the extraction tube to the assay priming
microwells.

Beyond these additions to the existing BD Viper System’s workflow, the following
processing functions are common to both systems (extracted and non-extracted):
(5) Priming microwell heat spike;
(6) Transfer of sample from priming microwells to prewarmed amplification
microwells located directly on the reader stage/heater;
(7) Amplification microwell plate sealing and movement of the sealed
amplification microwells into the fluorescent reader;
(8) Amplification temperature control and fluorescent photodetection; and
(9) Calculation and result interpretation.
