L. Test Principle:
The Tina-Quant Ceruloplasmin assay employs an immunoturbidimetric method in
which anti-ceruloplasmin antibodies react with antigen in the sample to form
antigen/antibody complexes which, following agglutination, can be determined
turbidimetrically.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the Tina-Quant Ceruloplasmin on the Roche/Hitachi 917 was
analyzed according to CLSI EP5-A2 guideline using pooled human sera
assayed in duplicate with 2 runs per day for 21 days. Repeatability is
comparable to formerly used intra-assay or within-run precision. Intermediate
precision describes within device day-to-day and run-to-run precision
formerly referred to as within-lab or total precision. The specifications were
≤30.0 mg/dL: SD ≤2 mg/dL and >30 mg/dL: CV ≤6%. Five samples (low and
high control, low medium and high serum) were used to acquire n=84.

Results are acceptable within specifications.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity of the Tina-Quant Ceruloplasmin on the Roche/Hitachi 917 was
evaluated by preparing two dilution series using high analyte level native
human serum samples. Series one covered theoretical values from 0 to 46
mg/dL and contained 10 dilutions steps. Series two covered theoretical values
from 0 to 251 mg/dL. Samples in both series were diluted with saline.
Ceruloplasmin values were measured and the recovered value was compared
to the theoretical value. Diluted samples were run in triplicate with median
measured values reported. The theoretical values were generated by applying
the dilution factors to the undiluted patient sample concentration. The
acceptance criteria for linearity are measured recovery ± 5% of theoretical
values for samples 10-140 mg/dL and ±2SD for samples up to 10 mg/dL. The
regression equations of the two series are as follows:
Passing-Bablok
Series 1 (low) y = 1.00x + 0.00 (95%CI for slope 0.988 to 1.009 and for
intercept -0.126 to 0.242)
Series 2 (high) y = 0.96x + 2.70 (95% CI for slope 0.92 to 0.98 and for
intercept 0.75 to 7.77)
Linear regression:
Series 1 (low) y = 0.993x + 0.357 (95% CI for slope 0.973 to 1.012 and
for intercept -0.172 to 0.885)
Series 2 (high) y = 0.999x + 0.303 (95% CI for slope 0.975 to 1.022 and
for intercept -1.46 to 2.067)
The recommended measuring range is defined as the limit of detection to the
upper limit of linearity. The recommended measuring range is 3-140 mg/dL.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Calibration method has been standardized against the reference
preparation CRM 470 (RPPHS – Reference Preparation for Proteins in Human
Serum). All calibrators and controls have been previously cleared. The
C.f.a.s. PAC calibrator was cleared in k040245. The
Prealbumin/Ceruloplasmin Control set was cleared in k062379. The adjusted
concentration of the control components are usually in the normal range or at
the normal/pathological threshold.
Unopened kit components are stable up to the expiration date at 2-8°C.
Reagents R1 and R2 are both stable for 90 days opened and refrigerated on the
analyzer.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) of the Tina-Quant
Ceruloplasmin on the Roche/Hitachi 917 were determined in accordance with
the CLSI EP17-A requirements. For LoB, one analyte free sample was
analyzed in five-fold determinations over three days, two runs per day, for a
total of n=60. For LoD, five human serum samples with low analyte
concentration were analyzed in one-fold determination over three days, two
runs per day. Two lots of reagents were used for testing.
The LoB is 2 mg/dL and the LoD is 3 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of endogenous interfering
substances using the Tina-Quant Ceruloplasmin assay on the Roche/Hitachi
917 was determined by using pooled human serum samples spiked with
varying levels of interferent, including bilirubin (conjugated and
unconjugated), hemoglobin, lipemia, and rheumatoid factors. The resulting
sample series (ten dilution steps per sample) were tested in triplicate and the
median values were used to calculate recovery. The specifications were ≤±3
mg/dL or ≤±10% for I index (bilirubin) ≤60; ≤±3 mg/dL or ≤±10% for L
index (intralipid) ≤400; ≤±3 mg/dL or ≤±10% for H index (hemoglobin)
≤350; and <76 IU/mL (<+0.03 g/L or <+10%) for rheumatoid factor.
The assay is unaffected by:
• Bilirubin: approximate conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin
concentration: 60 mg/dL
• Hemoglobin: approximate hemoglobin concentration: 350 mg/dL
• Intralipid: 400 mg/dL
• Rheumatoid Factors: < 76 IU/mL
Eighteen commonly used pharmaceuticals were added to native patient
samples and tested for interference on the Roche/Hitachi 917. Significant
interference was defined as a ± 10% deviation from the reference value. No
pharmaceuticals tested showed significant interference.
Hook effect:

No hook effect was detected up to 5 g/L.
f. Assay cut-off:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed to compare the Roche Tina-Quant
Ceruloplasmin on the Roche/Hitachi 917 and Roche Ceruloplasmin assay on
cobas c501. Eighty-two native human samples from multiple donors
including hospitalized patients and healthy blood donors were analyzed. In a
second study, an additional 15 samples were included to fully span the
measuring range. Sample concentrations were between 4.7-138 mg/dL. In
all, n=97 and the following correlation was obtained using Passing/Bablok:
y=1.012x-1.04
95% CI Slope: 0.99 to1.03
95% CI Intercept: -1.79 to -0.44
τ=0.945
b. Matrix comparison:
To validate the use of the lithium heparin sample type on the Tina-Quant
Ceruloplasmin assay on the Roche/Hitachi 917, parallel samples were
collected in serum and lithium heparin plasma for 58 samples. Each plasma
sample was compared to the respective serum sample result and percent
recovery was determined. The acceptance criteria were that plasma results
=had to be within ± 10% of the serum result or for serum results of ≤30.0
mg/dL, a recovery of ≤±3.0 mg/dL. The experiment allowed for 20% of
samples to be within 10% and 15% recovery. Later, four additional lithium
heparin plasma samples were tested to fully span the measuring range. The
data have been combined for n=62, and all recoveries except one were within
10% or ±3.0 mg/dL (as applicable). The following correlation was obtained
using Passing/Bablok:
y=0.99x+0.144
95% CI Slope: 0.97 to 1.00
95% CI Intercept: -0.54 to 0.81
τ=0.937
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical sensitivity and specificity:
Not applicable
b. Other clinical supportive data (when a. is not applicable):

total) who were resting, fasting, healthy volunteers between 20-70 years old.
Male: 15-30 mg/dL
