Guideline (EP9-A 1995)
How to Define and Determine Reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory;
Approved Guideline, Second edition (C28-A2)
L. Test Principle:
Creatinine amidohydrolase hydrolyzes creatinine in a sample to creatine. Creatine is
hydrolyzed by Creatinine amidohydrolase to sarcosine and urea. Sarcosine from this
reaction is oxidized by sarcosine oxidase to glycine and formaldehyde and hydrogen
peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide reacts with 4-aminoantipyrine and an acid in the
presence of peroxidase to yield a quinoneimine chromogen. The resulting change in
absorbance at 560 nm is proportional to the creatinine concentration in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies for serum and urine samples were evaluated using CLSI
EP5-A2 as a guideline. The sponsor conducted within run precision and total
precision with one human serum pool, three serum controls and two urine
controls. All samples were tested twice daily, in duplicate over 20 days
(n=80). Results of the precision studies are shown below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Serum and urine linearity studies were designed based on EP6-A guideline.
Serum
Serum pool samples were used for the linearity study. A low creatinine level
serum pool was prepared by diluting an aliquot of the serum pool with saline
to achieve the target low concentration. A high creatinine level serum pool
was prepared by spiking an aliquot of the serum pool with a spiking solution
to achieve the target high concentration. Inter-dilutions of the low and high
serum pools were used to prepare seven level of serum for the linearity study.
All serum samples were tested in replicates of three on SYNCHRON CX7
PRO system and UniCel DxC 800 system. The recovered creatinine values
were plotted against the expected values and an appropriate line fitted by
standard linear regression.
Serum samples concentrations tested ranged from 0.15 to 31.16 mg/dL and
the serum linear equation is y = 0.9984x- 0.0636 for SYNCHRON CX7 PRO
system. Serum samples concentrations tested ranged from 0.14 to 31.06
mg/dL and the serum linear equation is y = 1.0013x- 0.0445 for UniCel DxC
800 system.
The enzymatic creatinine assay has a serum linearity range of 0.20 to 25.0
mg/dL.

Urine
Urine pool samples were prepared by following the same procedures as
described above for serum linearity samples. Urine samples concentrations
tested ranged from 3.0 to 500 mg/dL. The urine linear equation is y = 1.0045x
- 1.758 for UniCel DxC 800 system.
The enzymatic creatinine assay has a urine linearity range of 10 to 400 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The SYNCHRON CX systems utilize a two-level calibrator, the SYNCHRON
CX calibrator, for the candidate enzymatic creatinine (CR-E) assay. The
SYNCHRON CX calibrator has been previously cleared in k942676.
The SYNCHRON LX and UniCel DxC systems utilize a two-level calibrator,
the Beckman Coulter AQUA calibrator, for the candidate enzymatic creatinine
(CR-E) assay. The Beckman Coulter AQUA calibrator has been previously
cleared in k965240.
Both calibrators are traceable to the NIST 912a SRM Creatinine standard
reference material. The set point values for creatinine were established by
human sample correlation to isotope dilution mass spectroscopy.
The CR-E reagent has a shelf-life stability of 18 months when stored at 2-8oC and
an open-vial stability of 30 days when stored at 2-8oC.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor determined the Limit of Detection (LoD) according to the CLSI
EP 17-A guideline. The LoD was determined by assaying one blank sample
(saline) and one low sample (with concentrations close to 4 times the LoB) in
replicates of twenty. The serum samples were assayed on both SYNCHRON
CX 7 PRO system and the UniCel DxC 800 system. The urine samples were
assayed on the UniCel DxC 800 system. The sponsor concluded that the LoD
for serum is 0.02 mg/dL and for urine is 10.0 mg/dL.
The enzymatic creatinine assay has a serum linearity range of 0.20 to 25.0
mg/dL and urine linearity range of 10 to 500 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were designed according to CLSI EP7-A2 guideline.
Three sample pools which represent low, mid, and high creatinine levels were
tested at different levels of the potential interferants. The sponsor states that
6

--- Page 7 ---
interferences are considered to be non-significant if the bias between the test
and control samples are within ±6% or ±0.2 mg/dL.
Results of the interferences studies on SYNCHRON CX 7 PRO and UniCel
DxC 800 systems are shown below:
Acetoacetate: Not-significant up to 500 mg/dL tested
Lipemia (intralipid): Not-significant up to 500 mg/dL tested
Lipemia (Serum index): Not-significant up to 8 tested
Ascorbic acid: Not-significant up to 20 mg/dL tested
Glucose: Not-significant up to 2000 mg/dL tested
Bilirubin (uncojugated): Not-significant up to 30 mg/dL tested
Bilirubin (conjugated): Not-significant up to 15 mg/dL tested
Hemoglobin: Not-significant up to 500 mg/dL tested
Dopamine: Not-significant up to 15 µmol/L tested
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A comparison study was performed between the enzymatic creatinine assay
(candidate method) and the CRE-S assay (predicate method) according to the
CLSI EP9-A2 guideline.
Eighty serum samples that ranged from 0.55- 24.0 mg/dL were assayed on the
SYCHRON CX 7 PRO system and the UniCel DxC 800 system. Some
samples are spiked in order to cover the hard-to-find range. The resulting
linear regression equation is y = 0.997x - 0.002 with a correlation coefficient
of 1.00, N= 78, for the SYCHRON CX 7 PRO system and y = 0.991x + 0.012
with a correlation coefficient of 1.00, N=80, for the UniCel DxC 800 system.
Y= candidate method and X= predicate method.
Sixty six urine samples that ranged from 12 to 382 mg/dL were assayed on the
UniCel DxC 800 system. Some samples are spiked in order to cover the hard-
to-find range. The resulting linear regression equation is y = 0.988x – 3.096
with a correlation coefficient of 0.998. Y= candidate method and X=
predicate method.
b. Matrix comparison:
Fifty-two paired serum and plasma samples (sodium heparin and lithium
7

--- Page 8 ---
heparin) ranging from 0.5 to 25 mg/dL were run with both SYNCHRON CX 7
PRO system and UniCel DxC 800 system. The following tables show the
linear regression results from the comparison of serum to the plasma tested.

anticoagulants for samples.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The serum reference range that the sponsor claimed was based on the predicate
device and the transferability of the reference range based on the comparability of
the analytical systems according to the CLSI C28-A2 guideline. A reference
range confirmation study was performed using 20 subjects (male and female) and
95% of the results fell within the predicate’s reference range.
In the labeling, the sponsor’s serum reference ranges are:
For SYNCHRON CX PRO system: 0.42-1.09 mg/dL (female), 0.62-1.28 mg/dL
(male)
