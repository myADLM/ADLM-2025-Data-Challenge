I. Device Description:
The ELVIS®HSV ID and D3 Typing Test System (D3 ELVIS) is comprised of Cells,
Replacement Medium and Test Reagents for the culture, qualitative identification and
typing of HSV isolated from cutaneous or mucocutaneous specimens collected from
patients with clinical suspicion of HSV infection. ELVIS®HSV Cells are genetically
engineered Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK) cells, which, when infected with either
HSV-1 or HSV-2, are induced to generate and accumulate an endogenous,
intracellular bacterial enzyme, β-galactosidase. Other viruses within the
herpesviridae family (e.g., Varicellazoster) are not capable of inducing the formation
of this enzyme. HSV infection of the ELVIS®HSV Cells also results in the formation
of HSV-type-specific proteins. The presence of these proteins can be detected
microscopically when fluorescent labeled HSV-type-specific antibodies are used.

L. Test Principle:
Specimens are inoculated onto the ELVIS®HSV Cells. After an overnight incubation
period (17- to 24-hours), the inoculated monolayers are fixed using the supplied
ELVIS®HSV Solution 1. The cells are then stained with the supplied ELVIS®HSV
Solution 2T, which contains the chromogenic substrate for the induced β-
galactosidase enzyme and the MAbs for typing isolates as HSV-1 or HSV-2. Those
cells infected with HSV develop an indigo-blue precipitate, while non-infected cells
remain colorless. Only monolayers containing the blue precipitate are examined for
the presence of fluorescent cells. Monolayers containing fluorescent cells are
reported as positive for HSV-2. Monolayers containing no fluorescent cells are rinsed
and stained with the supplied ELVIS®HSV Solution 3. After a brief rinse step, the
monolayers are examined for fluorescent cells. Monolayers containing fluorescent
cells are reported as positive for HSV-1. Monolayers containing no fluorescent cells
after staining with ELVIS®HSV Solution 3 are reported as positive for HSV, but not
typeable.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A study was undertaken to demonstrate the reproducibility of HSV
identification and typing results obtained with the ELVIS HSV ID and D3
Typing Test System.
A. Study Design
Ten panels of frozen virus suspensions were created for each testing site to
stain and interpret. The vial number of each panel member was staggered for
each scheduled run, such that the end-user did not come to expect a certain
result for each vial number after the first run. Each panel was inoculated and
stained once according to the ELVIS® HSV ID and D3 Typing Test System
instructions for use. Two panels per day were tested on separate plates for 5-
days (10 total runs). Testing was completed at each site on non-consecutive
days over a 10-day period. Positive and negative control wells were

Panel members were manufactured by diluting high-titered master stocks. The
dilutions were made with the same lot of EMEM with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum
used as the negative control. These dilutions were frozen at -70°C and sent to the
testing labs. The dilution’s titer was confirmed pre- and post freezing and found
to fall within the expected infectivity range for the study: low level should exhibit
less than 10% of the cells showing fluorescence; high level should exhibit greater
than 10% but less than 50% of the cells showing fluorescence.

Summary:
The presence of HSV was reported in 100% (120/120) of the wells in which
infected cells were present and the expected type was reported 100% (60/60)
for HSV-1 and 100% (60/60) for HSV-2. The absence of HSV was reported
in 100% (30/30) of the vials in which no virus was present. Controls
performed as expected during each run
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Shelf-life was determined for the device as a complete kit. The shelf-life of
the device ELVIS® HSV ID and D3 Typing Test System was targeted at 6
months. Kits were stored at 2°C to 8°C and tested at the indicated time
intervals. Characteristics monitored were performance, as well as pH, color
and clarity. Acceptance criterion was “bright fluorescence” (as opposed to
“dim fluorescence” or “no fluorescence”) observed in fixed, stained, infected
cells [infected to a level of 2+ to 4+ (30-100%) cytopathic effect] using
ELVIS®HSV Solution 2T reagent at 1/16 dilution. The table below
summarizes the real-time stability testing results.
d. Detection limit:
Detection limit of the subject and predicate devices were determined using the
ELVIS®HSV cell culture system. Analytical detection limits for HSV-1 and
HSV-2 are reported in the table below as numbers of blue staining cells per
cell monolayer. Each master stock (~1e7-TCID per mL) virus preparation
50
underwent a series of ten-fold dilutions, which were subsequently inoculated
into a 96-well ELVIS®HSV cell culture plate. The plates were centrifuged at
700 x g for 60 minutes, and then incubated at 35°C to 37°C for 17-hours.
Each well was stained with the subject and predicate devices then examined at

Light background fluorescent staining may occur with specimens contaminated with
Staphylococcus aureus strains containing large amounts of protein A. Protein A binds to the
Fc portions of the conjugated antibodies. Such binding can be distinguished from viral

Shell Vial versus Multi-Well Plate Method Comparison Data for the ELVIS®
HSV ID and D3 Typing System:
Each master stock (~5e6-TCID per mL) virus preparation was diluted to an
50
inoculum titer of ~100-TCID per mL. Three wells of a 24-well
50
ELVIS®HSV cell culture plate and three shell vials with coverslips were
inoculated with 1-mL inoculum per isolate. The cultures were centrifuged at
700 xg for 60 minutes, and then incubated at 35°C to 37°C for 17-hours. Each
well was stained with the subject device then examined at 200X magnification
and the number of blue staining cells and fluorescent plaques counted. The
table below lists the virus along with each well’s counts.
