L. Test Principle:
The eBcarryon Blood Glucose Monitoring System is based on an electrochemical
biosensor technology and the principle of capillary action. The glucose in the sample
is oxidized by the enzyme glucose oxidase, and the magnitude of the resulting
electrical current generated, which is proportional to the concentration of glucose in
the specimen, is converted into a readout that is displayed on the meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed precision studies in accordance with the ISO 15197 guideline.
Adjusted venous whole blood samples at 5 glucose levels (hematocrit range 35 to
50%) were used for within-day precision studies. Each concentration was tested 10
times each on 10 meters, each with 3 test strip lots, for a total of 300 tests per blood
glucose level. The reference value was determined by the YSI 2300 glucose
analyzer. Results are summarized below:

The sponsor also evaluated the day-to-day precision of the device using replicate
measurements of glucose control solutions (low, normal, and high). Three different
concentrations, using the same lot of control solutions, were tested on 10 meters, each
tested once per day for 10 days with 3 strip lots, for a total of 300 tests per blood
glucose level. Results are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor performed linearity studies using adjusted whole blood samples with 10
different glucose concentration ranges from 21 to 647 mg/dL. Each sample was
tested 60 times with the eBcarryon System and the results compared to those obtained
using YSI 2300. The results demonstrate less than ± 9 mg/dL difference for samples
with glucose concentrations <75 mg/dL and less than 8% bias for those >75 mg/dL
glucose. Linear regression analysis resulted in: y = 0.9859x - 1.6836; r2 = 0.996.
The claimed reportable range of the device is 30 to 600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The device is traceable to a laboratory analyzer which is calibrated to a glucose
standard (NIST SRM 965a).
The eBsensor control solutions, normal (100 mg/dL) and high (300 mg/dL) were
previously cleared in k062555.
c. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the device is 30-600 mg/dL. This range was validated via the
linearity study (see section M.1.b.).

d. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed interference studies with spiked venous blood samples at five
concentrations of glucose (30 to 50, 51 to 110, 111 to 150, 150 to 250, and 251 to 400
mg/dL) that were prepared and divided into a test pool and a control pool. The
potential interferents listed in the table below were added to the sample and each
sample was analyzed 20 times. The sponsor defines interference as a change in
glucose value relative to the control of greater >10%. Interference was observed for
L-Dopa at concentrations ≥1.25 mg/dL and for Dopamine at concentrations ≥ 3
mg/dL. The sponsor states in the labeling that therapeutic concentrations of L-dopa
and dopamine may affect test results. The table below list the substances tested and
the concentrations at which no significant interference was observed:
Substance Concentration at which no
Interference was observed
Acetominophen < 10 mg/dL
L-Dopa < 1.1 mg/dL
Tolbutamide < 100 mg/dL
Dopamine < 2 mg/dL
Ibuprofen < 20 mg/dL
Salicylic acid < 50 mg/dL
Methy-Dopa < 3 mg/dL
Tetracycline < 10 mg/dL
Glibenclimide < 1 mg/dL
Ketoprofen < 20 mg/dL
Diclofenac < 20 mg/dL
Indomethacin < 20 mg/dL
Amiloride < 20 mg/dL
Colchicine < 20 mg/dL
Atenolol < 20 mg/dL
Ascorbic Acid < 3 mg/dL
Creatinine < 5 mg/dL
Uric acid < 15 mg/dL
Cholesterol < 500 mg/dL
Bilirubin < 10 mg/dL
Triglyceride < 3000 mg/dL
Hematocrit Study:
The effect of different hematocrit levels on the accuracy of the device was evaluated
on the eBcarryon Blood Glucose Monitoring System with 5 meters. Blood samples at
8 hematocrit levels from 25% to 60% (25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60) were
adjusted to 9 concentrations of glucose (28, 66, 105, 148, 260, 372, 476, 581, 663
mg/dL). In total, 40 measurements were made at each of the glucose levels and the
bias was calculated relative to the YSI values and to the glucose values at 40%
hematocrit. The results support the claims for use with hematocrit of 30 to 55% with

biases due to hematocrit that did not exceed ±15 mg/dL for glucose values <75 mg/dL
or 15% for glucose values ≥75 mg/dL.
Altitude study:
An altitude study was performed at 8125 feet with 50 tests each of 5 different
concentrations of glucose spiked whole blood spanning 22 to 661 mg/dL (22, 33, 289,
575, and 661 mg/dL). The eBcarryon Blood Glucose Monitoring System results were
compared to YSI values and resulted in a % bias < 9% for all samples tested with
glucose >75 mg/dL and no greater than ±8 mg/dL for samples with <75 mg/dL
glucose. The results support the claims that altitudes up to 8000 ft have no significant
effect on eBcarryon blood glucose measurements.
Temperature and humidity studies:
The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies that demonstrated that the
eBcarryon Blood Glucose Monitoring System can be used at temperatures of 10 to
40°C and at a relative humidity <85%, and stored at temperatures of 0 to 50°C and at
a relative humidity <95%.

System Accuracy:
The sponsor performed an accuracy study to demonstrate that the eBcarryon Blood
Glucose Monitoring System is equivalent to the predicate (eBsensor) and YSI 2300.
Fingerstick samples, with glucose values of 43 to 452 mg/dL, were collected by a
technician from 100 subjects (with hematocrit of 30 to 55%). Results were obtained
by a technician using the eBcarryon meter and the eBsensor meter (predicate) and
were compared to the values obtained from YSI.
