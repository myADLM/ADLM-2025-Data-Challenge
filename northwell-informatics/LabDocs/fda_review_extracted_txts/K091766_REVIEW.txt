bacterial isolates. These antibodies and a control antibody are immobilized onto a
nitrocellulose membrane as two distinct lines and combined with a sample pad, a blue
conjugate pad, and an absorption pad to form a test strip.

L. Test Principle:
The Clearview® Exact PBP2a Test is a qualitative, in vitro immunochromatographic
assay. The procedure involves adding bacterial colonies to Reagent 1 to lyse the
bacterial cell walls and expose the PBP2a protein. Subsequently, Reagent 2 is added
to neutralize the sample. Once the test strips is placed in the extraction solution, the
extraction solution is absorbed by the sample pad through to the conjugate pad by
capillary action. The conjugate pad contains dried blue latex particles sensitized with
mouse anti-PBP2a monoclonal antibody. When the sample reaches the conjugate
pad, the sensitized latex is dissolved into the sample where an immune complex is
formed if PBP2a protein is present in the sample. This mixture then flows into the
nitrocellulose membrane. The nitrocellulose membrane is coated with two lines: one
of which is mouse anti-PBP2a (the test line) and the other is anti-mouse
immunoglobulin (the control line). As the sample moves over the nitrocellulose

antibodies creates a blue test line in positive samples. Excess conjugate is trapped on
the control line. This indicates that the test results are valid.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility study was done at three sites. Testing was done at three sites,
using 18-24 hrs isolates that have been sub-cultured, by two operators in
duplicates for five days. The reproducibility panel consists of six MRSA, and
four MSSA; 10 x (2) duplicates x 2 operators x 5 days x 3 sites= 600
Overall reproducibility was >95%.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Storage and Stability
Product Stability Studies were performed to generate real time and accelerated
stability data to support the expiration date of each lot under stated conditions,
(i.e., Clearview® Exact PBP2a Test kits should be stored at room
temperature or under refrigeration (2-30 ºC). Reagent 1 and Reagent 2 must
be stored refrigerated (2-8 ºC)).
Stability conditions were set up as follows:
1. Accelerated - Clearview® Exact PBP2a devices and Clearview® Exact
PBP2a Reagent 1* at 45°C & Clearview® Exact PBP2a Reagent 2 at 22°C
2. Real-time, room temperature- Clearview® Exact PBP2a devices and
Clearview® Exact PBP2a Reagent 1* at 30°C & Clearview® Exact
PBP2a Reagent 2 at 4°C
3. Real-time, refrigerated - Clearview® Exact PBP2a devices and
Clearview® Exact PBP2a Reagent 1 & Clearview® Exact PBP2a Reagent
2 at 4°C
Three device lots were used to test all test samples and controls using the
Control Assay Procedure in the package insert. (The same lot of devices,
liquid controls, and kit reagents are being used for the duration of the

devices were interpreted at 5 and 10 minutes. All samples were run in
triplicate using the same plate. Results are outlined in the table below:
