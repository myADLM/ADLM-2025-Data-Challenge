L. Test Principle:
The test is based on the measurement of electrical current generated by the reaction of
glucose with the reagent of the strip. The meter measures the current and displays the
corresponding blood glucose level. The strength of the current produced by the reaction
depends on the amount of glucose in the blood sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies to determine repeatability and intermediate precision were based on
ISO 15197 standard. A repeatability study was conducted using blood samples at five
different levels of glucose ranging from 49 to 391 mg/dL on three different reagent
system lots, four packages per lot. Ten replicate measurements were obtained for each
concentration and for each of twelve meters. An intermediate precision study was
conducted using control material at three different glucose levels ranging from 46 to
366 mg/dL on three different reagent system lots, four packages per lot.
Measurements were obtained for each concentration and for each of twelve meters for
a period of ten days. The mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficients of variation
(CV) were determined for each sample, see results below:

Pooled CV 1.41% 1.04% 0.96%
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study based on CLSI EP6-A standard was conducted on whole blood
samples at twelve different glucose levels ranging from 20 to 605 mg/dL. Duplicate
measurements for each glucose level were conducted on each of ten meters, three
strip lots, and 10 vials per strip lot. Regression analysis showed a linear relationship
between the SuperCheck 1 glucose monitoring system and the YSI-2300 reference
method. The linear regression was as follows: Y=1.0034X + 7.958, r2=0.9981, n=360.
The reportable range of the SuperCheck 1 glucose monitoring system was confirmed
to be 20 to 600 mg/dL. If a sample is less than 20 mg/dL, the result is flagged by the
meter as LO. If a sample result exceeds 600 mg/dL, the result is flagged by the meter
as HI.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The stability of the SuperCheck 1 test strips was demonstrated by real-time stability
studies. The unopened shelf life is 11 months and the open-vial stability is 3 months
at the recommended storage temperatures of 8°C to 30°C.
Value assignment for use of the control solutions with the SuperCheck1 test strips is
based on measurements using the YSI-2300 reference method after calibration with
YSI 2747 calibrator solution (NIST SRM #917A Clinical Dextrose). The control
solutions were previously cleared under k032029.
The acceptable ranges are printed on the test strip vial labels.
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the SuperCheck 1 glucose monitoring system is 20 to 600
mg/dL. This range was verified by the linearity study (see section M.1.b of this
decision summary).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interferences Study: A study was performed based on the CLSI EP7-A standard to
test for possible interference due to a number of endogenous and exogenous
substances. Control samples spiked at glucose levels of 80 and 120 mg/dL were tested
in five replicates with the SuperCheck 1 glucose monitoring system and in singlicate
with the YSI-2300 reference method. Each potential interfering substance was
evaluated using samples containing a low (80 mg/dL) and a high (120 mg/dL)
glucose level and compared against a control pool after measurements on the
SuperCheck 1 glucose monitoring system and the YSI-2300 reference method. The
table below shows the levels with no interference when testing for glucose with the
SuperCheck 1 glucose monitoring system:

The sponsor included the following limitation in the label:
Interference was observed for therapeutic level of L-Dopa. Uric acid, acetaminophen,
ascorbic acid, and ibuprofen have no significant interference in normal therapeutic
levels. However, the concentration in blood beyond the following levels may cause
inaccurate results: uric acid (10.9 mg/dL), acetaminophen (6.2 mg/dL), ascorbic acid
(4.5 mg/dL), and ibuprofen (37.5 mg/dL).
Hematocrit Study: A study was performed to evaluate the blood hematocrit (HCT)
effect on the performance of the SuperCheck 1 glucose monitoring system across the
measuring range of the assay. Whole blood samples were tested in duplicate with the
SuperCheck 1 glucose monitoring system using three lots of strips/twelve vials per lot
and eighteen meters. Glucose concentrations at each HCT level (30%, 32%, 35%,
40%, 46%, 50%, 56%, and 60%) were compared with results obtained with the YSI-
2300 reference method. The data were within ± 10 mg/dL for glucose levels < 75
mg/dL and within ± 15% for glucose levels ≥ 75 mg/dL for the claimed HCT range.
The sponsor included the following limitation in the label: Hematocrit in the range of
32-56% has been shown not to affect the glucose results. If you do not know your
hematocrit level, consult with your healthcare professional.

Altitude Study: The effect of altitude was evaluated by testing whole blood samples
at 120 and 240 mg/dL on the SuperCheck 1 glucose monitoring system using three
lots of strips/ten vials per lot and ten meters. Glucose concentrations at different
altitude levels were compared with results obtained with the Hemocue Glucose
Analyzer reference method. The measurements were acceptable when compared to
the reference method results. The sponsor included the following limitation in the
label: The test strips may be used at altitudes up to 5,280 feet without an effect on test
results.
Humidity Study: The effect of humidity on the performance of the SuperCheck 1
glucose monitoring system was evaluated at three glucose levels (Low-76.5-79.4
mg/dL; Medium-136-144 mg/dL; and High-329-338 mg/dL) using whole blood
samples. Ten replicates were tested at each glucose level with the SuperCheck 1
glucose monitoring system using three lots of strip/ten vials per lot and ten meters.
Glucose concentrations at each humidity level (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 95% R.H.)
were compared with results obtained with the YSI-2300 reference method. The study
results demonstrated that humidity between 20% R.H. and 95% R.H. did not affect
glucose measurements. Results fell within ± 7%.
Temperature Study: A study was performed to evaluate the effect of temperature on
the performance of the SuperCheck 1 glucose monitoring at three glucose levels
(Low-77.8-79 mg/dL; Medium-137-142 mg/dL; and High-325-335 mg/dL) using
whole blood samples. Ten replicates were tested at each glucose level with the
SuperCheck 1 glucose monitoring system using three lots of strip/ten vials per lot and
ten meters. Glucose concentrations at each temperature level (10, 20, 30, and 40°C)
were compared with results obtained with the YSI-2300 reference method. The study
results demonstrated that temperatures between 10°C and 40°C did not affect glucose
measurements. Results fell within ± 7%.

Visually Impaired User Study: Fifty subjects with visual impairment were enrolled
and user performance testing was performed using the SuperCheck 1 glucose
monitoring system and the YSI-2300 reference method. The subjects in this test
included those with vision category from 1 to 5, diagnosed per WHO Guidelines as
ICD Version 2007. User performance was evaluated with subjects using the device
with audible English language instructions. Subjects tested themselves on one meter
and then were tested by healthcare professionals. Usability of the device was
evaluated by users with a questionnaire.
