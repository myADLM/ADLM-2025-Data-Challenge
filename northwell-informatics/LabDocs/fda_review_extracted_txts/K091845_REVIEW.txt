The EliA test wells are coated with bovine cardiolipin antigen and bovine β2-
glycoprotein I as co-factor or with human ß2-Glycoprotein I. If present in the patient's
specimen, antibodies to cardiolipin or ß2-glycoprotein I bind to their specific antigen.
After washing away non-bound antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against human
IgG or IgM antibodies, are added to form an antibody-conjugate complex (EliA ß-
Galactosidase anti - IgG/IgM mouse monoclonal antibodies). After incubation, non-
bound conjugate is washed away and the bound complex is incubated with a
Development Solution. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the reaction
mixture is measured. The higher the value, the more IgG or IgM is present in the
specimen. To evaluate test results, the signal response for patient samples is compared
directly to the signal response for calibrators of defined value.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To determine the precision of the assays on the Phadia 100 and Phadia 250
instrument, the variability was assessed on 6 samples. Each sample was run on 3
instruments x 6 runs each over 6 days (equal to 108 replicate determinations per
sample) with a calibration curve in each run. Additional 2-4 samples were run on
the analytes that showed >10% CV. The statistical evaluation was performed by
Analysis of Variance. The results are summarized in the tables below:

Values below detection limit are reported as < x.x GPL-, MPL or EliA U/mL
depending on the analyte.
High Dose Hook Effect:
IgG method: High dose hook effect was analyzed by using dilutions from high
positive serum samples with an estimated concentration higher than the calibrator
600 (containing 600 µg/L of IgG). The sample dilutions were measured in 4
replicates.
EliA Cardiolipin IgG: A hook effect was not observed when analyzing a high
positive sample that had a concentration up to 6.5 times above the upper limit of
the measuring range. The upper limit of the measuring range was set to 418 GPL-
U/mL.
EliA β2-Glycoprotein I Ig: A hook effect was not observed when analyzing a high
positive sample that had a concentration up to 6.4 times above the upper limit of
the measuring range. The upper limit of the measuring range was set to 532
U/mL.
IgM method: High dose hook effect was analyzed by using dilutions from high
positive serum samples with an estimated concentration higher than the calibrator
1000 (containing 1000 µg/L of IgM). The sample dilutions were measured in 4
replicates.
EliA Cardiolipin IgM: A hook effect was not observed when analyzing a high
positive sample that had a concentration up to 5.85 times above the upper limit of
the measuring range. The upper limit of the measuring range was set to 466 MPL-
U/mL.
EliA β2-Glycoprotein I IgM: A hook effect was not observed when analyzing a
high positive sample that had a concentration up to 8.1 times above the upper
limit of the measuring range. The upper limit of the measuring range was set to
500 U/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The EliA IgG system reagents and EliA Negative Control are cleared under the
k061165 for the EliA IgG system; k072149/k072393 for EliA Negative Control.
The IgG and IgM calibrators are traceable (via an unbroken chain of calibrations)
to the International Reference Preparation (IRP) 67/86 of Human Serum
Immunoglobulins A, G and M from WHO. New batches of IgG and IgM
Calibrators are compared to a secondary standard (standardized with the IRP) or
the IRP directly and adjusted accordingly to meet the correct concentration.
The instrument measures specific IgG/IgM concentrations in μg/L. By using a
conversion factor given by the lot-specific code of the EliA Cardiolipin IgG and
IgM Well, the results are automatically converted to GPL-U/mL or MPL-U/mL,
respectively.

Shelf Life of test components:
Three batches of EliA Cardiolipin IgG/IgM or β2-Glycoprotein I IgG/IgM wells
were tested in real time stability studies to support the claimed shelf life at 2-8°C
up to 18 months.
EliA APS Positive Control stability:
Shelf of the EliA APS positive control is summarized below:
Open stability:
Open stability is not tested as the EliA APS Positive Control and Negative
Control are packaged in single use vials.
Closed stability:
A study was done to investigate the accelerated stability of the EliA APS Positive
Control. A preliminary shelf life of 18 months was given for the EliA APS
Positive Control. Real time studies are being done alongside the accelerated
studies.
d. Detection limit:
The purpose of this study was to verify the lower limit of the measuring ranges
for EliA Cardiolipin IgG and EliA β2-Glycoprotein I IgG (detection limit) by
providing the ability of the new device to differentiate between the background
sample diluent) and a 1/8 dilution of the lowest calibrator point.
Detection limit (LoD) IgG method:
Calibrator 4.0 (containing 4 µg/L of IgG) was diluted 1:2 (i.e. 2 µg/L), 1:4 (i.e. 1
µg/L) and 1:8 (i.e. 0.5 µg/L) in EliA sample diluent and run on EliA IgG
Calibrator wells. EliA Sample diluent was run on the different EliA Cardiolipin
IgG and EliA ß2-Glycoprotein I IgG wells. EliA sample diluent results were
compared with the Calibrator results.
Detection limit (LoD) IgM method:
Calibrator 10.0 (containing 10 µg/L of IgM) was diluted 1:2 (i.e. 5 µg/L), 1:4 (i.e.
2.5 µg/L) and 1:8 (i.e. 1.25 µg/L) in EliA sample diluent and run on EliA IgM
Calibrator wells. EliA Sample diluent was run on the different EliA Cardiolipin
IgM and EliA ß2-Glycoprotein I IgM wells. EliA sample diluent results were
compared with the Calibrator results.
Results are summarized below:
EliA Cardiolipin IgG: LoD was set to 0.5 GPL-U/mL.
EliA β2-Glycoprotein I IgG: LoD was set to 0.6 U/mL.
EliA Cardiolipin IgM: LoD was set to 0.8 MPL-U/mL.
EliA β2-Glycoprotein I IgM: LoD was set to 0.9 U/mL.
f. Analytical specificity/Interference:
The purpose of this study was to investigate whether high concentrations of
potentially interfering substances in serum, like bilirubin, hemoglobin, chyle and
rheumatoid factor adversely affect the results of EliA assays. Two positive serum
samples with concentration levels around the cut-off and one high positive serum
sample with concentration level around calibrator 5 were spiked with the
interfering substances bilirubin C, bilirubin F, hemoglobin, chyle or rheumatoid
10

--- Page 11 ---
factor. The same samples were also spiked with substance specific blanks. The
samples were tested in 3 replicates. A calibration curve in two replicates was run
in each assay. The runs were repeated twice. The table below shows the end
concentration of the interference substances spiked into the 1:10 diluted serum
samples:
Substance Concentration in the
1:10 Diluted Serum sample
Bilirubin C 20.6 µg/mL
Bilirubin F 21.1 µg/mL
Hemoglobin 519 µg/mL
Chyle 1570 Units/dl
Rheumatoid factor 55 IU/mL*
Bilirubin C, bilirubin F, chyle and hemoglobin did not adversely affect the results.
*Increased levels of rheumatoid factor may have an effect on the response on EliA
Cardiolipin IgM Well and can influence the β2-Glycoprotein I IgM test result
when the patient sample contains β2-Glycoprotein I IgG antibodies.
Generally, the use of sera containing lipemic, hemolized or microbial
contaminations is not recommended as stated in the package inserts.
Carry over study:
A sample with a specific anti-Cardiolipin IgM titer above the measuring range
was first pipetted on EliA Dummy wells (wells which are not coated with
Cardiolipin antigen). The pipette then was washed by the ordinary washing
routine of the instrument. Thereafter pure diluent was pipetted on EliA
Cardiolipin IgM wells. If there remained any of the sample with high specific
anti-Cardiolipin IgM titer on the pipette surface it would increase the signal
compared to the basic signal normally obtained when measuring pure diluent on
EliA Cardiolipin IgM wells. This was repeated five times. The study has been
performed on three instruments. Signal level for pure diluent on EliA Cardiolipin
well IgM was around 18 relative fluorescence units (RU). The carry over could
hardly be expressed in U/mL since the lowest calibration point 0 U/mL is
normally found around 19 RU.
A difference between instrument dilution 1:2 and manual dilution 1:2 could
hardly be detected. Therefore after pipetting the sample with the high titer of
specific anti-Cardiolipin antibodies, only a few RUs difference compared to the
prediluted sample pipetting could be seen, which is too low to be expressed in
U/mL.
g. Assay cut-off:
A study was done on 400 apparently healthy Blood Donor samples from
Caucasian individuals equally distributed by sex and age. The 95th percentile
should be calculated and should be taken into account for setting of the cut-off.
The results are summarized below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
289 serum samples were collected from the serum bank at Phadia GmbH. In this
study 64 samples from patients who had been clinically defined as suffering from
Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS) were included. Each sample was analyzed in
duplicates in EliA Cardiolipin IgG kits. The study was evaluated by excluding
the clinical samples below the limit of detection and above the measuring range.
All method comparison studies were run on ImmunoCAP 250 instruments. The
results are summarized below:
EliA Cardiolipin tests, in contrast to the Varelisa Cardiolipin tests, do not yield
equivocal, but weak positive results. When evaluating the method comparison the
area between 10 and 40 GPL- / MPL-U/ml were considered only as positive ( >
10 GPL-U/mL or MPL-U/mL).

The expected value in the normal population is negative. The sponsor states that a
low percentage (up to 5 %) of apparently healthy, asymptomatic individuals have
been reported to be positive for Anti-Cardiolipin Antibody. Their proportion may
increase with age. Expected values may vary depending on the population tested.
β2-Glycoprotein I IgG/IgM:
The expected value in the normal population is negative. The sponsor states that up
to 3% of apparently healthy, asymptomatic individuals may have increased levels of
β2-glycoprotein I antibodies. Expected values may vary depending on the population
tested.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion: SE
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
