K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None utilized.
L. Test Principle:
The assay is an indirect noncompetitive enzyme immunoassay. The wells of a
microtiter plate are coated with purified human PR3 antigen. Antibodies specific for
PR3 present in the patient samples bind to the antigen. In a second step, the enzyme
labeled second antibody (conjugate) binds to the antigen-antibody complex leading to
the formation of an enzyme labeled conjugate-antibody-antigen complex. The
enzyme labeled antigen-antibody complex converts the added substrate to form a
colored solution. The rate of color formation from the chromogen is a function of the
amount of conjugate complexed with the bound antibody and thus is proportional to
the initial concentration of antibodies in the patient sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the assay was assessed using a total of eight serum samples with
mean values ranging from 6.8 U/mL to 260.7 U/mL. Experiment 1 was
performed using three separate runs with eight replicates each. Experiment 2
was performed using five separate runs with eight replicates each:

Because the AESKULISA PR3 assay can be used in either a semi-quantitative
or qualitative mode, a separate qualitative analysis was performed on intra-
and inter-assay data from experiment 2. Following the package insert
directions for determining qualitative results, the absorbance values of each
sample replicate were divided by the absorbance the cut-off calibrator on the
same plate and the resulting ratio was used to determine if the sample was
positive or negative. The data are summarized in the table below:

and further diluted to a total dilution of 1:200, 1:400, and 1:800. Percent
recovery (percent observed/expected ratios) of each sample was in the range
92 - 107%. The linearity experiment encompassed samples in the range 4.2 –
278 U/mL. A linear regression of the measured vs. expected data in this table
produced slope = 0.94, intercept = 2.48, r2 = 0.998.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
An international reference material for anti-PR3 antibodies is not available.
The assay is calibrated in relative arbitrary units (U/mL). Stability testing
data was provided demonstrating that the AESKULISA PR3 kit is stable for at
least 24 months when stored at 4°C.
Opened and reconstituted kits are claimed to be stable for one month when
stored at 4°C. Serum sample stability claims and storage recommendations in
the package insert are based on CLSI H18-A3 “Procedures for the Handling
and Processing of Blood Specimens; Approved Guideline — Third Edition”.
d. Detection limit:
Thirty determinations of sample buffer were used to determine the limit of
blank (LoB). LoB of the AESKULISA PR3 assay is 0.28 U/mL.
To determine the Limit of Detection (LoD) eight low samples were tested
eight times each (a total of 64 determinations). These samples were used to
calculate LoD according to CLSI EP17-A. The LoD of the assay is 1.38 U/ml.
e. Analytical specificity:
The following substances were spiked into serum in order to test for
interference: hemoglobin (800 mg/dL), bilirubin (20 mg/dL), and triglyceride

(3000 mg/dL). Three samples were evaluated for interference—a high
negative, a low positive, and a strongly positive sample. Recoveries were all
in the range 89-110%.
The analytical specificity of the AESKULISA PR3 assay was partially
addressed in the clinical study by testing 69 samples from patients that were
positive for anti-MPO antibodies. Two of these samples were positive for
both anti-MPO and anti-PR3 antibodies. These two samples were from a
patient diagnosed with SLE and a patient diagnosed with acute hearing loss.
The analytical specificity of the AESKULISA PR3 assay was also addressed
by testing 21 samples from patients with reactive arthritis that were positive
for rheumatoid factor, antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptides (CCP) and/or
antinuclear antibodies (ANA). All were negative in the AESKULISA PR3
assay.
f. Assay cut-off:
A study was performed to confirm the defined cut-off by measuring serum
samples from 80 apparently health donors as well as samples from 27 patients
with Crohn’s disease, reactive arthritis, or ulcerative colitis that should all be
expected to be negative for anti-PR3 antibodies. The cut-off of 15 U/mL was
determined from the mean plus 3 standard deviations of this population.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
139 sera of patients suffering from Wegener’s granulomatosis, microscopic
polyangiitis and other autoimmune diseases have been tested on the
AESKULISA PR3 and a predicate device. Of these, 69 sera lay in range of the
assay and were used for a comparison study versus a predicate device:
