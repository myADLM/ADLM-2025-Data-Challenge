L. Test Principle:
The ADVIA Centaur SHBG assay is a quantitative antibody sandwich immunoassay
intended for use as an aid in the differential diagnosis of hirsutism and other adrenal
abnormalities. The SHBG assay consists of streptavidin magnetic latex particles as the solid
phase, biotin labeled anti-SHBG antibody as the capture conjugate, and an acridinium
labeled anti-SHBG conjugate as the Lite reagent. An antibody sandwich is formed when
SHBG in the patient sample or calibrator is captured by the anti-SHBG on the solid phase
which then binds the anti-SHBG antibody acridinium ester (AE) conjugate.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed Within Run and Total precision studies according to the CLSI
EP5-A2 guideline. Seven samples at various levels of SHBG were evaluated: five
samples were pooled human serum samples at levels 9.04, 37.89, 72.84, 116.92 and
142.87 nmol/L, and two samples were human serum based control material at levels
21.42 and 39.87 nmol/L.
Five of the samples (1-5 below) were assayed 2 times, in 2 runs, on 1 ADVIA
Centaur analyzer, (n = 80 for each sample), over a period of 20 days (n=80). Two
additional serum samples (samples 6 and 7) were assayed 2 times, in 2 runs, on 1
ADVIA Centaur analyzer (n=40), over a period of 10 days. One trained operator
performed the study.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed using a high pool and a low pool samples.
Intermediate 10 levels were prepared from these two pool samples. A total of 12
samples ranging from 0.16 to 189.89 nmol/L which encompasses the claimed
reportable range of 0.35 to 180 nmol/L were tested in triplicate. The measured values
were plotted against the expected values and an appropriate line fitted by standard
linear regression resulting in : y=1.011x+0.3897. The recovery results are presented
below:

12 Low Sample 0.16 0.16 100.0
In addition, the sponsor performed a dilution study to demonstrate the ability of the
ADVIA Centaur analyzer to recovery accurately from a diluted sample using a 1:2
dilution. Thirteen human patient samples with high SHBG concentrations (140.3 to
306.8 nmol/L) near or above the assay upper limit of 180 nmol/L were diluted both
manually and onboard the ADVIA Centaur analyzer and assayed using the ADVIA
Centaur SHBG assay. One trained operator performed the study and the percent
recovery calculated by comparing the observed onboard diluted results to the
manually diluted results. The mean recovery results are within 98.86 and 118.72 %.
High-dose hook effect: The potential for a high-dose hook effect was evaluated for
this assay. SHBG was spiked into negative pool (equine serum) and into 2 different
serum samples to achieve SHBG concentrations ranging from 888 to 11,100 nmol/L.
The samples were analyzed in triplicate on one ADVIA Centaur analyzer using 2
reagent lots. Based on the results, the sponsor concluded that SHBG levels < 1000
nmol/L did not exhibit any high dose effect.

Traceability:
The ADVIA Centaur SHBG assay is traceable to World Health Organization (WHO)
standard (95/560). Assigned values of calibrators and ranges of controls are traceable
to this standardization.
The ADVIA Centaur SHBG Calibrators, low and high: A set of internal SHBG
standards were manufactured and value assigned using a SHBG WHO standard
(NIBSC Code: 95/960). SHBG master lot calibrators are then value assigned against
these standards by pooling the results using multiple ADVIA Centaur analyzers,
multiple reagent lots and multiple runs. Productions lots are value assigned against
Master lots by assaying replicate samples alternating between the “master lot”
calibrator and the production lot (test lot) calibrator.
The SHBG Calibrator insert refers to the Calibrator Assigned Value card to facilitate
entering the calibrator values on the system. Values for the Low (~10 nmol/L) and
High (~160 nmol/L) calibrators are provided on the SHBG calibrator card.
The ADVIA SHBG Master Curve Material (MCM) is value assigned against an
existing MCM reference lot that is traceable to a WHO SHBG standard (NIBSC
Code: 95/960). Assigned values were established using the ADVIA Centaur SHBG
assay and ADVIA Centaur analyzer. The target values for the 5 MCM solutions,
MCM1 to MCM5 are 0, 10, 50, 100, and 200 nmol/L. Test lots are value assigned
against the reference lot by assaying replicate samples alternating between the
“reference lot” and the test lot. SHBG Master Curve Material product insert refers to
the SHBG MCM lot specific target value sheet for the actual ranges.
Stability:
Real time shelf life and open vial stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria for
the ADVIA Centaur SHBG Calibrators were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
The product insert recommends storing the lyophilized calibrators at 2 to 8°C until
expiration date on the vial label. The sponsor recommends a 39 week stability. It is
recommended by the sponsor that the reconstituted calibrators be stored at -20°C for
60 days and to freeze-thaw once.
Real time shelf life stability protocols and acceptance criteria for the ADVIA SHBG
Master Curve Material were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor
recommends in the insert to store unopened MCM material at 2 to 8°C until the
expiration date on the vial. The sponsor is recommends a 39 week stability. Once
reconstituted the material should be used immediately and any remaining material
discarded.

d. Detection limit:
The sponsor performed Limit of Blank (LoB) and the Limit of Detection (LoD)
studies in accordance with the CLSI EP17-A guideline. For the LoB studies 5
negative SHBG base pools (horse serum) were used as blanks and were analyzed on
two ADVIA Centaur analyzers over three days, with two replicates each, using two
reagent lots. A total of 120 results were generated. A nonparametric analysis was
employed and the LoB is reported as 0.0033 nmol/L.
For the LoD studies 5 spiked low SHBG pools with mean values ranging from 0.119
to 0.216 nmol/L were used. The pools were analyzed with 2 different reagent lots, on
2 ADVIA Centaur analyzers, over 3 days with 2 replicates/sample/run for a total of
24 replicates per sample. A total of 120 replicates were analyzed.
The mean, median and 5th percentiles were calculated for each sample by reagent lot
by system. The LoD, the lowest level material in which the 5th percentile exceeds
the Limit of Blank, was determined nonparametrically since the requirement of
normality was not met for these pools for all combinations of reagent lot and system.
The LoD was estimated to be 0.164 nmol/L.
The SHBG assay has a linearity range of 0.35 to 180 nmol/L.
c. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed interference studies according to the CLSI EP7-A guideline.
Potential cross-reactive compounds (see table below) were added to steroid-free
diluent and were evaluated in triplicate on ADVIA Centaur instrument using 2
reagent lots. Each test sample was compared to a matched unspiked control and the
% change calculated. The sponsor defines no significant cross-reactivity as <5%
difference from sample and control results and states that all the following tested
cross reactants are within these specifications:
Potential Cross-Reactive Spiking
Agent Concentration
Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) 48.4 μg/dL
Cortisol 100 μg/mL
11-Deoxycortisol 4 μg/mL

Potential interfering substances were added to three sample pools containing 10, 50,
and 80 nmol/L SHBG. The following interfering substances were added to these
sample pools and assayed on an ADVIA Centaur in replicates of six: 5 mg/dL
conjugated bilirubin and unconjugated bilirubin, 10, 30, 60 and 100 ng/dL biotin, 250
and 500 mg/dL of hemoglobin, 50 mg/mL of BSA, 50 ul/mL intralipid (equivalent to
1000 mg/dL triglyceride), and 1, 10, 100 ul/mL Silwet. The same samples pools
containing the appropriate solvent of diluent used to dissolve the interferents were
used as controls and the percent recovery between the samples and controls were
calculated. The sponsor defines no significant interference as <10% change in
results, and states that no significant interference was observed with any of the
potential interferents tested. The labeling includes the following limitation: Samples
that contain bilirubin concentrations greater than 5 mg/dL may be inaccurate due to
potential interference and should not be used.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparisons to the predicate device were performed in accordance with the
CLSI EP9-A2 guideline.
A total of 202 remnant, de-identified serum samples, ranging from 0.37 to 172.72
nmol/L SHBG were tested in duplicate at one clinical site on the ADVIA Centaur
analyzer (Y) and were compared to results of samples analyzed in duplicate on the
Roche Elecsys 2010 (the predicate) (X). Data was analyzed using a singlet set of data
from the candidate device. The analysis by least squares linear regression resulted in:
y = 0.94x +2.7; r = 0.990.
b. Matrix comparison:
The sponsor performed a matrix comparison study using a set of matched donor
samples types (Serum, Lithium heparin plasma). Fifty nine samples, ranging from
15 to 142 nmol/L of SHBG, were analyzed. Nine of the donor samples were spiked
with SHBG. Samples were measured in triplicate using one reagent lot and one
ADVIA Centaur analyzer. The results of linear regression analysis: y = 1.0331x –
0.0709; R2 = 0.9924.
