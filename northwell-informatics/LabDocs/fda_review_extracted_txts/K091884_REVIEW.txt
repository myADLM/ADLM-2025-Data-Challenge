L. Test Principle:
The ARK Zonisamide Assay is a homogeneous immunoassay based on competition
between drug in the specimen and zonisamide labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for binding to the antibody reagent. As the latter
binds antibody, enzyme activity decreases. In the presence of drug from the specimen,
enzyme activity increases and is directly proportional to the drug concentration. Active
enzyme converts the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH that
is measured spectrophotometrically as a rate of change in absorbance. Endogenous serum
G6PDH does not interfere with the results because the coenyzme NAD functions only
with the bacterial enzyme used in the assay.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable): Performance was validated on
the Hitachi 917 instrument.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision
Samples evaluated included the ARK Zonisamide Control (low, mid and high) and three
pooled human serum samples. Data were collected on a single analyzer over twenty non-
consecutive days. Five calibrations were performed (Days 1, 5, 10, 12 and 17) during
this interval to provide variation (calibration was performing in a stable manner). Each
sample was assayed in quadruplicate twice a day, with each run separated by at least two
hours. Calculations were conducted according to CLSI Guideline EP5-A2. Results are
summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The manufacturer’s claimed assay reportable range is from 2.0 to 50 μg/mL, based on
linearity, recovery, lower limit of quantitation and method comparison results submitted
in the 510(k). (See respective sections below for specific information on performance).
Linearity:
Samples ranging from below 2 to 48 μg/mL were prepared from a gravimetrically
prepared zonisamide stock solution and zonisamide-free serum pools. The dilutions were
prepared so that zonisamide concentrations varied in increments of 1 ug/mL within the
range 2-8 μg/mL; and in increments of 8 ug/mL within the range of 16 μg/mL - 48
μg/mL. The averaged results of multiple runs and replicates (n=6) for each sample using
the ARK assay were used in the calculations. Regression analyses were performed
between the measured mean zonisamide and the nominal values for each dilution, using
first order and second order polynomial determinations according to CLSI/NCCLS EP6-
A. In the range below 3 ug/mL deviations from linearity were within 15%; above 3
ug/mL the deviations from linearity observed were within 5%. Linear regression yielded
the equation: measured value = 0.97 (known gravimetric concentration) + 0.18, R² =
0.99.
Analytical recovery was performed by adding concentrated zonisamide drug (99% purity)
into human serum negative for zonisamide. A stock concentrate of highly pure
zonisamide was added volumetrically to human serum negative for zonisamide,
representing drug concentrations across the assay range. Twenty replicates of each
sample were assayed. The results were averaged and compared to the target concentration
and percent recovery calculated. Results are shown below.
% Recovery = 100 X (Mean recovered concentration/Theoretical concentration)

Dilution of high samples:
The package insert recommends that patient samples with concentrations above the assay
range of 50 ug/mL may be diluted with zero calibrator. Spiked samples with high levels
of zonisamide (100.0 μg/mL) were diluted manually with Calibrator A of the ARK
Zonisamide Calibrator. The mean result of 10 replicate measurements and recovery
versus the target level is shown below. The mean recovery (n=10) was 102%, with
percent CV = 3.8.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability:
Stability is evaluated using both accelerated and real-time protocols. For real-time
stability testing, performance of materials refrigerated at 2-8 degrees C are compared to
a reference set of materials that are stored frozen. Results are evaluated at multiple time
points during the expiration dating period for accuracy and precision in measuring
zonisamide controls. No change in recovery or precision was observed in the real-time
studies submitted in the 510(k). Real time studies are ongoing.
Calibrator value assignment:
Stock solutions are prepared by gravimetric dilution of pure zonisamide and then added
to the synthetic calibrator/control matrix (calibrator A) to achieve the calibrator
concentrations of 2.5, 7.5, 20, 40 and 80.0 µg/mL levels. Samples were assayed by the
ARK™ Zonisamide Assay. Multiple runs and replicates were evaluated to determine
recovery in the two matrices. The same spiking was performed with serum, so that any
matrix effects may be detected. Analytical recoveries observed were 93-105% in the
calibrator/control matrix and 93-104% in the serum matrix.
Control value assignment:
Quality control (QC) ranges were established using three runs with four replicates tested
per run (n=12 for each control level) and the mean zonisamide level of each control was
calculated. Control ranges were set at ± 10% around the mean level tested. The package

insert notes that each laboratory should establish its own ranges for each new lot of
controls.
d. Detection limit:
Accuracy and precision studies near the low range of the assay were conducted to
determine the manufacturer’s claimed lower limit of quantitation (LOQ). Studies
generally followed CLSI Guideline EP-17 guideline. Three zonisamide levels were
tested below the lowest positive calibrator concentration (2.5 μg/mL). Samples were
prepared by gravimetric addition of pure zonisamide (USP) to stock solution, and
addition of this stock solution to pooled human serum negative for zonisamide.
Concentrations included 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 μg/mL. Eight replicates of each sample were
tested in each of five runs to give 40 replicates of each sample. Testing was performed on
a total of 3 lots. Each run was performed on a separate day, with a separate calibration to
enhance variability (i.e., challenge the assay). Results for all lots supported that
performance met the manufacturer’s acceptance criteria of the LOQ of 2.0 μg/mL having
CV within 20% and recovery within +/-15%.
.
e. Analytical specificity:
Studies included testing for interference from endogenous compounds, metabolite, and
commonly co-administered, and other anti-epileptic drugs.
Serum samples with clinically high concentrations of the potential interfering substances
were tested by the assay in the presence of varying amounts of zonisamide. Specifically,
serum samples tested contained zonisamide at concentrations of approximately 15 ug/mL
and 45 ug/mL. Each sample containing interferent was assayed, along with a serum
control of zonisamide. Results for endogenous compounds and the metabolites N-acetyl
zonisamide (NAZ) and non-glucuronidated 202-sulfamoylacetyl phenol (SMAP) are
shown below. The complete list of interferents tested and results are included in the
package insert.

b. Matrix comparison:
Two studies were preformed for the matrix comparison study. In study number 1, assay
recovery, as well as precision (within one run) was evaluated for zonisamide spiked into
the following plasma types: Lithium heparin, Potassium, EDTA, Sodium heparin and
serum. Matched specimens for serum and plasma were collected from eight subjects.
Four samples spiked with zonisamide (7.5, 15, 30 and 60 μg/mL) were prepared from
each specimen (for a total of 32 samples per anticoagulant). Replicate measurements for
each of the 32 samples were averaged. Percent recoveries for all samples ranged from
95% to 113..4% relative to nominal spiked values; and from 91.3 to 109.0% for plasma
relative to serum values. For the large majority of samples recoveries well-within these
ranges were observed, and no specific trends (of differences in recovery relative to
concentration) were observed.
In study number 2, matched specimens for serum and plasma were collected from four of
the original eight subjects from study #1. Each matrix per subject was spiked with
zonisamide for the target of 2.0 μg/mL. Each subject’s matched matrices were tested as a
group, performing two calibrated runs and tested in triplicate each run for a total of six
replicates per serum or plasma matrix sample per subject. Percent recoveries for all
samples ranged from 95% to 110 % relative to nominal spiked values; and from 99.2 to
109.0% for plasma relative to serum values. For the large majority of samples recoveries
well-within these ranges were observed, and no specific trends (of differences in recovery
relative to concentration) were observed.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable): The
sponsor provided a discussion with balanced and representative literature
discussing clinical use of zonisamide measurements.
4. Clinical cut-off: not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
A therapeutic range for zonisamide has not been well established. A reference range
between 10 to 40 μg/mL has been suggested. In one study, a 50% reduction in seizures
was observed at serum concentrations ranging from 7 to 40 mg/L (Mimaki et al., 1992).
Some studies indicate an increased incidence of adverse effects at serum concentrations
in excess of 30 mg/L [Wilensky et al., 1985; Berent et al., 1987; Miura et al.,1993]. In
general the relationship between these serum concentrations and clinical effect has not
been well-defined, and considerable overlap in zonisamide concentrations has been
observed between serum responders and non-responders as well as between serum levels
associated with seizure control and adverse effects. Zonisamide concentrations should
always be used in conjunction with information available from clinical evaluations and
other diagnostic procedures.
Zonisamide metabolism can be influenced by enzyme inducing co-medications and
polymorphisms. Pharmacokinetics may vary significantly, particularly with co-
medication, and based on age. The half-life of zonisamide is 50-70 hours in patients on
monotherapy and 25-35 hours in patients co-medicated with enzyme-inducing
antiepileptic drugs.
The reference range of drug concentrations which is quoted should only imply a lower
limit below which a therapeutic response is relatively unlikely and an upper limit above
which toxicity is relatively likely to occur in the specific populations studied. Clinicians
using these proposed ranges should be aware that because of individual variation patients
may achieve therapeutic benefit with serum drug concentrations outside of these ranges
or may experience toxicity with levels below the lower limit of the reference range.
The sponsor also includes the following in the limitations:
It is generally good practice to use the same method (as well as matrix) consistently for
individual patient care due to the potential for method-to-method variabilities.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports
substantial equivalence decision.
