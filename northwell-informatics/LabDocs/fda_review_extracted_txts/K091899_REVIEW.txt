H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The VITEK®2 Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test is intended for use with the
VITEK®2 Systems in clinical laboratories as an in vitro test to determine the
susceptibility of Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., and Streptococcus
agalactiae, and S. pneumoniae.
2. Indication(s) for use:
This application is indicated for the addition of Meropenem to the VITEK®2 and
VITEK®2 Compact Systems Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) System for
testing Acinetobacter baumanii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus
mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at a concentration of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 4
μg/mL, and a calling range of ≤0.12 - ≥8µg/mL.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription use only
The current absence of resistant isolates precludes defining results other than
Susceptible. Isolates yielding MIC results suggestive of Nonsusceptible category
should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable
I. Device Description:
The VITEK® 2 AST card is inoculated with a standardized organism suspension. The
card is incubated within the instrument and optically monitored throughout the incubation
cycle. Results are automatically calculated once a predetermined growth threshold is
reached and a report is generated that contains the final result.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
Predicate Device names:
VITEK® 2 Gram Negative Doripenem.

Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA"; CLSI M7 (M100-S 18) "Methods
for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;
Approved Standard".
L. Test Principle:
Optics systems use visible light to directly measure organism growth. These
transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before significant
growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same well measure
organism growth by how much light is prevented from going through the well. An
interpretive call is made between 4 and 16 hours for a "rapid" read but may be
extended to 18 hours in some instances. The VITEK®2 Susceptibility Card test is
based on the microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration technique with
concentrations equivalent to standard method concentrations. Several parameters
based on the growth characteristics observed are used to provide appropriate input for
the MIC calculations. Discriminate analysis is used to develop the algorithm that
determines the susceptibility result for all antimicrobials on the VITEK®2 system.

The MIC result must be linked to organism identification in order to determine a
category interpretation. A category interpretation (SIR) will be reported along with a
MIC.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Ten gram negative isolates were tested at three sites in triplicate for three days
using both the manual dilution and the automatic dilution method. These same
organisms were tested at one site three times to determine within site
reproducibility of >95% also. This testing was performed using both the manual
dilution of the inoculum and also the automatic dilution method.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The FDA recommended quality control (QC) isolates P. aeruginosa
ATCC 27853 and E. coli ATCC 25922 were tested at each study site by the
reference method and the VITEK®2. The reference method QC results were
in range for every day tested. The VITEK®2 was tested a sufficient number of
times to demonstrate that the system can produce QC results in the
recommended range.
Quality Control was performed during the studies using both autodilution and
the manual dilution method.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A clinical study was conducted at three external sites. bioMerieux, Inc served
as a fourth trial site using theVITEK®2 gram negative meropenem and the
broth microdilution method as recommended by CLSI. Inoculumn was
prepared with direct colony suspension and incubated in ambient air at 35 ±2
0C for 16 20 hours. The testing included both fresh clinical isolates and stock
-
isolates along with a challenge set with known results. Two methods of
inoculation (manual and automated) were evaluated. Clinical testing was
performed using the automated method of inoculation and the challenge set
was tested using both the manual and the automated method. The test device
had a growth rate of >90%. A comparison was provided to the reference
method with the following agreement.
One very major discrepancy is indicated for Enterobacteriaceae and two for
P. aeruginosa which is within the specified limits for acceptance according to
the Guidance Document criteria.

EA is when there is agreement between the reference method and the new
method is within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of antibiotic.
Category agreement (CA) is when the new method result interpretation agrees
exactly with the reference panel result interpretation. Evaluable EA is when
the MIC result is on scale for both the new method and the reference method
and have on-scale EA.
Manual Dilution:
The challenge set of organisms was also tested at one site using the manual
method of inoculation with the following performance that demonstrated a
minimal difference between the two inoculation methods.
