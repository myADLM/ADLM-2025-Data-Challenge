0120).
L. Test Principle:
Polystyrene particles covalently coated with a monoclonal antibody (8D3) are
aggregated when mixed with samples containing D-dimer. The D-dimer cross-linkage
region has a stereo-symmetrical structure, i.e., the epitope for the monoclonal
antibody occurs twice. Consequently, one antibody suffices in order to trigger an
aggregation reaction, which is then detected turbidimetrically via the increase in
turbidity.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance: Refer to original 510(k) submissions (k081732) for
analytical performance data (precision/reproducibility, linearity/assay reportable
range, traceability, detection limit, analytical specificity, assay cut-off, stability
and expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods)):
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device: Frozen aliquots of 265 de-
identified citrate plasma samples were analyzed with the INNOVANCE® D-
Dimer assay and the VIDAS D-Dimer Exclusion assay. The range of D-dimer
values in the correlation studies was 0.17 to 4.17 mg/L FEU.

Comparison of BCS® and BCS® XP
BCS® and BCS® XP are members of the same instrument family. A
comparison study was performed using 116 samples. The overall Pearson
correlation coefficient was 0.993 (r2=0.983) in all samples (n=116) including
samples above the measurable range. For all samples that were within the
measurable range (i.e., 0.17 - 4.4 mg/L FEU; n=65), the Pearson correlation

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
The INNOVANCE® D-Dimer assay was evaluated on the BCS® / BCS® XP
System in a multi-center study to validate the exclusion of PE using fresh
specimens collected from 701 consecutive patients presenting to the
emergency department with suspected PE. Of these 701 patients, 54 were
excluded for a total of 647 patients available for final analysis.
All patients were evaluated using the Wells’ rules to estimate a high, moderate
or low pre-test probability (PTP) of PE. Patient specimens were tested with
the INNOVANCE® D-Dimer assay and results were compared to a cutoff
value of 0.5 mg/L (FEU) that had been established previously (k081732). A
D-dimer result <0.5 mg/L (FEU) was considered negative and a D-dimer
result ≥0.5 mg/L (FEU) was considered positive.
Patients with a positive D-dimer result and/or a high PTP were evaluated by
imaging methods, e.g. spiral CT and/or VQ scan. Patients with a negative D-
dimer result and a low or moderate PTP (these patients underwent imaging at
the physician’s discretion), and patients with negative imaging results, were
followed for three months to evaluate potential development of PE.
The overall prevalence of PE in those patients available for final analysis was
13.8% (89/647). The following instrument-specific sensitivity, specificity and
negative predictive value (NPV) with upper and lower 95% confidence limits
(CL) were obtained with the INNOVANCE® D-Dimer clinical cutoff of 0.5
mg/L (FEU).
