SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification
ODE Review Memorandum (Decision Making Document is Attached)
To: THE FILE RE: DOCUMENT NUMBER K091949
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the
SUBMITTER’S own Class II, Class III or Class I devices requiring 510(k). The following
items are present and acceptable (delete/add items as necessary):
1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device.
MicroScan MICroSTREP plus® Panel Penicillin (0.015 -16mcg/ml) - K062773
(WalkAway)
MicroScan MICroSTREP plus® Panel Penicillin (0.015 -16mcg/ml) - K020626
(Manual)
2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as
described in its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which
includes instructions for use, package labeling, and, if available, advertisements or
promotional materials (labeling changes are permitted as long as they do not affect the
intended use).
The Indication/Intended Use Statement has not changed.
3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S), including clearly labeled diagrams,
engineering drawings, photographs, user’s and/or service manuals in sufficient detail to
demonstrate that the FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified
device has not changed.
The modifications were:
In January 2008 the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) modified the MIC
breakpoint interpretive criteria for Penicillin, specific for S. pneumoniae. These modified
criteria were approved by the FDA for the drug manufacturer, Baxter Healthcare, Inc., in
February 2008. The previous and current drug interpretive criteria are illustrated in Table
1.

Subsequently, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Inc. made the following device
modifications:
●Change in the device Penicillin drug interpretive criteria for S. pneumoniae such that the
criteria are consistent with the modifications approved by the FDA in February 2008.
More specifically, the pre-approval drug interpretive criteria for S. pneumoniae of S<0.06,
I=0.12, R>2 was changed to the post-approval drug interpretive criteria for S.
pneumoniae (non-meningiditis) of S<2, I=4, R>8, and S. pneumoniae (meningiditis) of
S<2, R>0.12.
●Change in device labeling to update the Penicillin drug interpretive criteria for S.
pneumoniae to reflect the modifications as a result of the February 2008 FDA (CDER)
approval.

5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification
on the device and its components, and the results of the analysis
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation
activities required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be
applied
c) A declaration of conformity with design controls. The declaration of conformity should
include:
i) A statement signed by the individual responsible, that, as required by the risk
analysis, all verification and validation activities were performed by the designated
individual(s) and the results demonstrated that the predetermined acceptance
criteria were met, and
ii) A statement signed by the individual responsible, that the manufacturing facility is
in conformance with design control procedure requirements as specified in 21
CFR 820.30 and the records are available for review.
The design control activities summary:
A risk analysis study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the MICroSTREP
plus Panel – Penicillin in conjunction with the new Penicillin breakpoint interpretive criteria
for S. pneumoniae. Performance data specific for the isolates of S.pneumoniae from the
original 510(k) submissions (K020626 – Manual Read Method; K062773 – WalkAway®
Instrument Read), have been reevaluated using the new drug interpretive criteria.

A total of 53 challenge and 243 clinical S.pneumoniae isolates were reevaluated for the
Manual Read Method. A total of 53 challenge S.pneumoniae isolates were reevaluated
for the Walkaway® Instrument Read method. The results were compared to that of the
reference method.
Tables 1-3 below demonstrate the performance based on essential agreement and
category agreement for clinical and challenge isolates in combination with the turbidity
method of inoculation for the Manual Read method. Table 4 below demonstrates the
performance based on essential and category agreement for challenge isolates in
combination with the turbidity method of inoculation for the Walkaway® Instrument Read
method.

Specifically related to the data of the challenge isolates tested in Table 4, it is noted that the
percent category agreement falls below the acceptance criteria of greater than or equal to
90%, as outlined in the Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial
Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems Guidance. This is due to the low number of challenge
isolates tested in conjunction with the occurrence of 8 minor discrepancies. Further
evaluation revealed that the 8 minor discrepancies are due to the change in the SIR
categories with the new Penicillin breakpoint interpretive criteria, and all fall within essential
agreement.
Tables 1-4 reveal the occurrence of major discrepancies and one instance of a very major
discrepancy which exceeds the acceptance criteria as outline in the Class II Special Control
Guidance Document:: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems Guidance. This is

due to a lack of an Intermediate category for the new Penicillin breakpoint interpretive criteria
for S.pneumoniae, meningiditis. Because there was only one occurrence of a very major
error out of all the data which underwent reevaluation, it can be attributed to random error.
The potential increased occurrence of major discrepancies (i.e. the device yielding a result of
resistant (R) when the reference method result is susceptible (S)) specific to the Penicillin
meningiditis interpretive criteria with S.pneumoniae, is addressed in the form of a limitation in
the device labeling.
6. A Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary or Statement and the
Indications for
Use Enclosure (and Class III Summary for Class III devices).
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the
indication/intended use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the
submitter’s description of the particular modification(s) and the comparative information
between the modified and unmodified devices demonstrate that the fundamental scientific
technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the design control information as
specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the device be
determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.
