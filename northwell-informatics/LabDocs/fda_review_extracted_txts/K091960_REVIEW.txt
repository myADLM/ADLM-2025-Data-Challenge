L. Test Principle:
Deletion of chromosome 5q as detected by cytogenetics is a recurring abnormality in
AML. The early growth response 1 (EGR1) gene is among the genes in a commonly
deleted segment on chromosome band 5q31. The Vysis EGR1 FISH Probe Kit uses
FISH DNA probe technology to determine the deletion status of probe targets in
AML bone marrow specimens for LSI EGR1, D5S23 and D5S721 on chromosome 5.
Bone marrow specimens from AML patients are attached to microscope slides using
standard cytogenetic procedures. The resulting specimen DNA is denatured to single-
stranded form and subsequently allowed to hybridize with the probes of the EGR1
FISH Probe Kit. Following hybridization, the unbound probe is removed by a series
of washes, and the nuclei are counterstained with DAPI, a DNA-specific stain that
fluoresces blue. Hybridization of the LSI EGR1 SpectrumOrange and D5S23,
D5S721 SpectrumGreen probes is viewed using a fluorescence microscope equipped
with appropriate excitation and emission filters, allow visualization of the orange and

green fluorescent signals.
In a cell with normal copy numbers of the LSI EGR1 SpectrumOrange and D5S23,
D5S721 SpectrumGreen probe targets, two SpectrumOrange signals (LSI EGR1) and
two SpectrumGreen signals (LSI D5S23, D5S721) will be expected.
In a cell with the 5q deletion, one SpectrumOrange signal (LSI EGR1) and two
SpectrumGreen signals (LSI D5S23, D5S721) will be expected. Enumeration of the
orange LSI EGR1 and green LSI D5S23, D5S721 signals provide a mechanism for
determining absolute copy number of the probe targets and the presence of the
aberration of interest.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision and Reproducibility were tested at three sites on five different days.
Two replicates of two normal specimens (patients that do not contain either -5
or 5q- based on prior karyotype or FISH results) and 4 abnormal specimens (2
low positive (12.0% of cells positive for 5q-) and 2 high positive (≥ 45.0% of
cells positive for 5q-)) were tested. Low positive specimens were targeted at
two times the normal EGR1 cutoff of 6.0%. Positive specimens were
obtained by mixing positive bone marrow cells with normal bone marrow
cells to obtain the desired levels of abnormality. The mean and the standard
deviation (SD) of the percentage of cells with the 1R2G signal pattern was
calculated.
i. Precision:
Lot-to-Lot: Using the same specimens from the site-to-site study, four
replicates of the 2 high positive, 2 low positive, and 2 normal specimens
were tested with 3 different lots of probe at a single site. All replicates
using the three probe lots for each of the 6 specimens produced agreement
with the known status of the specimens.
Within-Day and Between Day: Using the same samples from the site-to-
site study, two replicates of on the 2 high positive, 2 low positive, and 2
normal specimens were run at each site on the same day and between 5
non-consecutive days. Analysis of Variance results are presented below
for all three sites combined:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i. Real-time stability: The functionality of the Vysis EGR1 FISH Probe kit
components was evaluated based on subjective rating of the following
attributes: signal intensity, target background, cross-hybridization,
specificity and overall readability in three lots. The Vysis EGR1 FISH
Probe Kit dating is determined by the component with the shortest
expiration dating. The shelf-life of Vysis EGR1 FISH Probe Kit was

ii Freeze-thaw Stability: A series of 20 freeze-thaw cycles was performed
on the probes, hybridization buffer and DAPI II counterstain. The
functionality of these components was evaluated based on subjective
rating of the following attributes: signal intensity, target background,
cross-hybridization, specificity and overall readability in one lot. Twenty
freeze-thaw cycles were found to be acceptable for this kit.
iii. Transport and Temperature Extreme Stability. The functionality of the
Vysis EGR1 FISH Probe kit components was evaluated based on
subjective rating of the following attributes: signal intensity, target
background, cross-hybridization, specificity and overall readability in one
lot. Components were removed from -20°C and cycled for 48 hours on
dry ice, 72 hours at 25°C, 72 hours at 40°C, and -20°C for 24 hours prior
to testing. There was no change in device performance under these stress
conditions.
iv. Post-hybridization Signal Stability. A single slide from each of three bone
marrow specimens was tested at baseline and then stored at -20°C ± 10°C
while protected from light. The samples were tested at three time points
(Day 7, Day 14, and Day 25) using the following attributes: nuclear
morphology, background, signal intensity and overall readability in one
lot. The post-hybridization signal stability was found to be three weeks.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity of the Vysis LSI EGR1 SpectrumOrange D5S23,
D5S721 SpectrumGreen probes was established using interphase nuclei
prepared from 25 bone marrow specimens that were either karyotypically
normal or 5p15 and 5q31 deletion-free. The orange and green signal patterns
of nuclei for 25 specimens were evaluated by two technologists. Each
technologist evaluated 100 nuclei per specimen for a total of 200 nuclei per
specimen and 5000 scoreable nuclei from normal specimens. The analytical
sensitivity was calculated as the percentage of scoreable interphase nuclei
with the expected 2 red/2 green signal pattern.

e. Analytical specificity:
The analytical specificity of the Vysis LSI EGR1 SpectrumOrange and
D5S23, D5S721 SpectrumGreen probes for their respective chromosome
target loci was established using metaphase chromosomes prepared from
peripheral blood cultures of five karyotypically normal males that were pooled
prior to dropping on microscope slides. The hybridization location of each
FISH signal on chromosomes of 100 consecutive metaphase nuclei was
evaluated by one technologist for a total of 200 target loci. For each probe
and sample, the number of metaphase chromosome FISH signals hybridized

f. Assay cut-off:
The normal cut-off value is defined as the maximum quantity of scoreable
interphase nuclei with an abnormal signal pattern at which a specimen is
considered normal for that signal pattern. The normal cut-off value is
expressed in terms of a percentage of the actual number of nuclei with a
specific abnormal FISH signal pattern per the standard number of nuclei
tested.
The normal cut-off value for this assay is 6% or 12 1red/2green (1R2G)
patterns per 200 scoreable interphase nuclei. Specimens exceeding 12 1R2G
patterns per 200 scoreable nuclei are considered abnormal for deletion of the
Vysis LSI EGR1 probe target. This 6% normal cut-off value was adopted
from the publication Vance et al3 who utilized the Vysis LSI
EGR1/D5S23,D5S721 probe set in a study that established agreement
between cytogenetics and FISH in 183 bone marrow specimens.
In order to validate the 6% normal cut-off of the Vysis EGR1 FISH Probe Kit,
the assay was performed on interphase nuclei from 25 bone marrow
specimens from either karyotypically normal specimens or 5p15.2 and 5q31
deletion-free specimens. The signal patterns of 200 nuclei were evaluated by
each of two technologists who evaluated 100 nuclei per specimen. Among the
25 normal specimens, none produced 1R2G signals at or above the 6% normal
cut-off.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
The clinical utility of the cytogenetic detection of the deletion of chromosome
5q is correlated with reduced 5-year overall survival in studies by Byrd et al1
and Grimwade et al2. The Byrd publication demonstrated the prognostic
value in 86 patients with a -5/5q- abnormality by a median overall survival
(OS) of 0.3 years compared to the median OS of 1.3 years associated with
patients exhibiting a normal karyotype. Patients with a -5/5q- abnormality
had a 5-year OS of 6% compared to a 5-year OS of 24% associated with
patients exhibiting a normal karyotype. Patients with a -5/5q- abnormality
also had a significantly lower complete remission (CR) rate of 31% than the
normal karyotype, which resulted in a CR of 68% with a p<0.001. For
del(5q), 42 patients had a 5-year OS of 5%, 95% CI (2-13%) and median
overall survival of 0.3 years.
Grimwade et al, showed prognostic value in 28 patients for 5q-. Cytogenetic
abnormalities in the Medical Research Council (MRC) AML 10 clinical trial
for del(5q) patients showed 5-year OS of 11% and CR of 57% in the adverse
risk group. These values varied significantly from the no abnormality, or
normal karyotype group, which had 5-year OS of 42% and CR of 88% (p<0.001).
The publication “Utility of interphase FISH to stratify patients into
cytogenetic risk categories at diagnosis of AML in an Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) clinical trial (E1900)” by Vance et al3, establishes
linkage between cytogenetic results and the Vysis EGR1 FISH Probe kit.
When 183 bone marrow specimens were compared to cytogenetic results at
the >6% cut-off, there was overall agreement of 98.91% (95% CI-96.%-
99.70%), negative percent agreement of 100% (95% CI- 97.83%-100.00%)
and positive percent agreement of 80% (95% CI-49.02%-94.34%). Results
