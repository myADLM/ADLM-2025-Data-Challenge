K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced.
L. Test Principle:
Calibrators, controls, or diluted patient samples are added to the wells and
autoantibodies recognizing the antigen bind during the first incubation. After washing
the wells to remove all unbound proteins, conjugate is added. The conjugate binds to
the captured human autoantibody. Excess unbound conjugate is removed by another
wash step. The bound conjugate is visualized with 3,3’,5,5’ tetramethylbenzidine
(TMB) substrate. The intensity of color development is proportional to the
concentration of autoantibody in the sample. Microtiter plates are read at 450 nm and
a reference wavelength of 620 to 650 nm. The controls and patient results are
interpreted by comparing them as a ratio of one of the calibrators (for a qualitative
claim), or to a 3 point calibration curve (for the semi-quantitative claim).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the tests were assessed by determining the intra- and inter-
assay coefficients of variation (CV) of several sera with values across the
claimed assay ranges. The intra-assay %CVs are based on 20 determinations
and the inter-assay %CVs on 16 determinations (2 runs on 8 different days) or
24 determinations (4 runs on 6 different days).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Serial dilutions of six positive patient sera (per assay) showed the assay was
linear across the claimed measurement range of 2 – 200 RU/mL. Ordinary
least squares linear regression of obtained values (y-axis) against expected
values (x-axis) was performed for each sample and the coefficients of
determination (R2) calculated. Values above or below the measurement range
were excluded from the calculation. Mean percent recovery with the Anti-
Desmoglein 1 ELISA was 99% (range: 70 – 121%) and with the Anti-
Desmoglein 3 ELISA 101% (range: 71 – 129%). In both assays, the samples
that were outside of ± 10% of the expected values were highly diluted samples
(1:800 or higher).

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There are no international standards for desmoglein antibodies. The results are
expressed as either relative units (RU/mL) using the three-point calibration, or
as a ratio using the single calibrator 2.
Stability studies are conducted in accordance to the international standard DIN
EN 13640:2002: Stability testing of in vitro diagnostics reagents. Three
production lots of all kit reagents are tested. Real-time stability studies (+2°C
to +8°C ) are underway; current data supports at least a six month unopened
stability claim. A preliminary stability claim of 10 months is supported by
means of an accelerated stability test.
Opened reagents are stable until the expiration date if stored as directed in the
instructions (+2°C to +8°C ). Diluted (ready-to-use) wash buffer is stable for
up to 28 days.
The sponsor recommends following the guidelines in CLSI H18-A3 for
sample storage.
d. Detection limit:
Claimed assay range is 2 -200 RU/mL. The limit of detection (LoD) of the
assays as determined by repeated measurement of the blank plus two times
their standard deviations were well below 2 RU/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity of the assays was tested with a panel of 20 bullous
pemphigoid samples and 20 linear IgA dermatosis samples. All samples were
negative by the anti-desmoglein 1 and the anti-desmoglein 3 assays. Cross-
reactivity between anti-Desmoglein 1 and anti-Desmoglein 3 is shown in the
clinical sensitivity and specificity section below.

To investigate the influence of potentially interfering substances, aliquots of
three samples of differing concentrations were spiked with different
concentrations hemoglobin, triglycerides and bilirubin. The spiked samples
were measured using the Anti-Desmoglein 1 and Anti-Desmoglein 3 ELISA
(IgG) according to the package insert and the results expressed in RU/ml. No
significant interference was observed with hemolytic, lipemic or icteric
samples for concentrations of up to 1000 mg/dl for hemoglobin, 2000 mg/dl
for triglyceride and 40 mg/dl for bilirubin.
f. Assay cut-off:
The defined cut-off of 20 RU/mL was evaluated in the normal range study
(see below). The average value plus 3 standard deviations was below 20
RU/mL in both assays.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A study was performed in cooperation with the dermatological reference
center of the university hospital Lübeck, Germany. In total, 190 samples (50
from PF patients, 71 from PV patients, 48 from BP patients and 21 from LAD
patients) were tested with the EUROIMMUN Anti-Desmoglein 1 and Anti-
Desmoglein 3 ELISA (IgG) and the predicate assays using the cut-offs
recommended by the respective test instructions. The results are shown in the
tables below. 95% C.I. are calculated by the exact method. Samples exceeding
the assay range of 2 – 200 RU/mL were excluded from the calculations: 66
anti-Desmoglein 1 samples remained and 54 anti-Desmoglein 3 samples
remained:

b. Matrix comparison:
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that recovery of analyte from
lithium heparin plasma, citrate plasma and EDTA plasma collection tubes was
equivalent to the analyte recovered from serum collection tubes. Samples
from the same patient were collected in all four collection tubes and tested
according to the directions for use. Samples spanned the diagnostically
important range, i.e. the lower half of the calibration curve and the cut-off area
measuring range of both assays; anti-Desmoglein 1 samples ranged from 7 –
107 RU/mL and anti-Desmoglein 3 samples ranged from 7 – 131 RU/mL.
12 samples were tested for both assays. Regression analysis was performed
using serum as the comparator; results are shown in the table below:

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical sensitivity and specificity:
An external clinical laboratory study was performed in cooperation with the
dermatological reference center of the university hospital in Lübeck,
Germany. In total, 190 samples [50 from PF patients, 71 from PV patients, 48
from Bullous Pemphigoid (BP) patients and 21 from Linear IgA-Dermatosis
(LAD) patients] were tested with the EUROIMMUN Anti-Desmoglein 1 and
Anti-Desmoglein 3 ELISA (IgG). Results of both assays were compared to the
clinical diagnosis:

Of the 71 PV samples tested, 33 were positive for anti-Desmoglein 1 and anti-
Desmoglein 3. In the mucosal variant of pemphigus vulgaris, autoantibodies
exclusively react with desmoglein 3 whereas patients with the mucocutaneous
subtype raise antibodies against both desmoglein 3 and 1. Clinical information
was not available to determine which variant of PV the patients that provided
the samples suffered from.
In the absence of this information, we analyzed the data without including the

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The frequency distribution for anti-desmoglein 1 antibodies was analyzed with the
EUROIMMUN Anti-Desmoglein 1 in a panel of 251 apparently healthy blood
donors. The panel for anti-desmoglein 1 consisted of 123 men and 71 women with
an age range of 18 – 66 years (average age: 39 years).
The frequency distribution for anti-desmoglein 1 antibodies was analyzed with the
EUROIMMUN Anti-Desmoglein 3 in a panel of 251 apparently healthy blood
donors. The panel for anti-desmoglein 3 consisted of 153 men and 98 women with
an age range of 18 – 68 years (average age: 38 years).
