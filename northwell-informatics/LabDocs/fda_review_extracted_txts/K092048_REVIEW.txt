dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP), an inactive metabolite of methadone,
at a designates cutoff concentration of 300 ng/mL. This product is used to obtain a
visual, qualitative result and is intended for professional use and professionals at
point of care sites.
This assay provides only preliminary results. A more specific alternate chemical
method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory
method.
Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of
abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated.

For Professional prescription use and point-of-care use
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable, as the devices are visually-read single-use devices.

L. Test Principle:
The One Step EDDP (Methadone Metabolite) Test Strip is an immunoassay based on
the principle of competitive binding. Drugs which may be present in the urine
specimen compete against the drug conjugate for binding sites on the antibody.
During testing, a urine sample migrates upward by capillary action. EDDP, if present
in the urine sample below 300 ng/mL, will not saturate the binding sites of antibody-
coated particles in the test strip. The antibody-coated particles will then be captured
by immobilized EDDP conjugate and a visible colored line will show up in the test
region. The colored line will not form in the test region if the EDDP levels exceed
300 ng/mL because it will saturate all the binding sites of anti-EDDP antibodies.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed at three Physician’s office laboratories using
drug free urine spiked to the following concentrations: 0, 150, 225, 375 and
450 ng/mL. The samples were aliquots, coded, randomized and blinded, than
given to each site. A total of 45 determinations were made at each
concentration. Testing was performed once a day for three days by three
operators (1 per site). Three different lot numbers for each device were used
for the study. Sample concentrations were confirmed by GC/MS. The results
are displayed in the tables below:

Reading time:
The sponsor conducted a reading time study to validate the optimal reading
time and stability of the test result for both devices. Drug-free urine
specimens were spiked with commercially available EDDP to achieve three
GC/MS confirmed concentration levels (+/-50% and a negative).
The samples were tested at 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes,

30 minutes, 60 minutes, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours and 24 hours. The results
support the sponsors reading time of 5 minutes and the stability of the results
up to 8 hours for both formats.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable, the device is intended for qualitative use.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Procedural controls are included in the test strip and device. A colored line
appearing in the control zone is considered as an internal procedural control. It
confirms sufficient specimen volume and adequate membrane wicking. Users
are informed not to interpret the test if no red line appears in the control zone.
Control standards are not supplied with these tests; however it is
recommended that positive and negative controls be tested as a good
laboratory practice to confirm the test procedure and to verify proper test
performance. User should follow local, state and federal guidelines for testing
QC material.
d. Detection limit:
To test the analytical sensitivity for EDDP seven different urine samples
containing drug concentrations from negative to 3X the cutoff were tested; 30
devices, on three lots for each format were tested. Drug concentrations were
confirmed by GC/MS:

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was established by spiking similarly structured drug
compounds to a concentration of 100 µg/mL into urine having concentrations
of EDDP at -25% of the cutoff and +25% of the cutoff. These solutions were
tested with both devices. The table below summarizes the results:
Compound Concentration Test Results

EDDP Test Strip
-25% CO +25% CO
EDDP 0 µg/mL Negative Positive
EDDP 100 µg/mL Positive Positive
Doxylamine 100 µg/mL Negative Positive
EMDP 100 µg/mL Negative Positive
LAAM HCL 100 µg/mL Negative Positive
Nor-LAAM HCL 100 µg/mL Negative Positive
MDP 100 µg/mL Negative Positive
(-) alpha methadol 100 µg/mL Negative Positive
Methadone 100 µg/mL Negative Positive
Interfering substances to a final concentration of 100 µg/mL for each
compound were spiked into a low negative urine and positive urine. The
samples were tested with device and showed no interference at the
concentration tested. The complete list of the compounds can be found in the
package insert.
pH and Specific Gravity:
To test for possible positive and/or negative interference drug free urine were
adjusted to the following pH concentrations 4.0, 5.0. 6.0, 7.0, 8.0 and 9.0.
Each of these samples were divided into three aliquots: drug free urine, EDDP
was spiked to -25% of the cutoff and EDDP was spiked to 25% of the cutoff.
Each sample was assayed in duplicate. No negative or positive interference
due to pH was observed.
To test for possible positive and/or negative interference from specific gravity 15
drug free urine samples having specific gravity from 1.000-1.034 were used.
Each of these samples were divided into three aliquots: drug free urine, EDDP
was spiked to -25% of the cutoff and EDDP was spiked to 25% of the cutoff.
Each sample was assayed in duplicate. No negative or positive interference
due to specific gravity was observed.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Performance for the EDDP One Step Methadone Metabolite Test Strip was
evaluated at two Physician Office Laboratories and one clinical laboratory
