IgE in the patient sample. After washing away non-specific IgE, enzyme –labeled
antibodies against IgE are added to form a complex. After incubation, unbound
enzyme-anti-IgE is washed away and the bound complex is then incubated with a
developing agent. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence of the eluate is
measured. The higher the response value the more specific IgE is present in the
specimen. To evaluate the test results, the response for the patient samples are
transformed to concentrations with the use of a calibration curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To demonstrate lot-to-lot reproducibility of the ImmunoCAP Allergen d201,
House dust mite, three lots of ImmunoCAP Allergen from routine production
were tested using two positive and one negative control samples (stored
human plasma). The samples were tested in duplicates in one assay run.
Mean concentration values, concentration quotients, and %CV were
calculated.
The concentration quotients between lots based on uptake of positive sample
were between 0.99 – 1.09, the concentrations of the negative samples were
<0.35 kU /L, and all %CV were less than 4%.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not provided (see k962274)
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
A stability study was performed to demonstrate 24 months real time stability
(at recommended storage temperature of 2-8°C) of ImmunoCAP Allergen
d201, House dust mite. The study was planned in accordance with CEN
13640, Stability Testing of In Vitro Diagnostic Reagents. Three lots of
ImmunoCAP Allergen were stored at 2-8°C. Two positive and one negative
control samples (stored human plasma) were tested in duplicates in one assay
at monthly intervals. The mean concentrations were calculated for each
sample and occasion. Concentration quotients were calculated for the positive
samples. The sample concentration at a specific month is divided with the
start value, (month x)/(month 0). The concentration quotients ranged from 0.8
– 1.3 kU /L of the starting value for the positive samples while the value for
A
the negative sample remained at <0.1 kU /L demonstrating at least 24 months

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity/Clinical specificity:
To demonstrate the presence of specific IgE to Blomia tropicalis in the
serum/plasma samples of patients with diagnosed or suspected allergy to the
allergen and healthy, non-sensitized donors with no reported clinical reaction,
66 positive and 100 negative samples were tested with the ImmunoCAP
Allergen d201. The positive samples consisted of 3 clinical, 37 positive, and
another 26 patients with allergic asthma and exhibited positive reactions to either
conjunctival and/or bronchial challenge with B. tropicalis. A clinical sample
was defined as a sample from an individual with a clinical history of allergy-
like symptoms upon exposure to the specific allergen, as diagnosed by a
physician. A positive sample was defined as a sample from an individual with
a relevant suspected allergy and with measurable levels of IgE antibodies.
Negative samples were collected from healthy non-atopic donors.
The 26 patients were from a published studya of 42 patients from Spain with
allergic asthma and/or rhinoconjunctivitis sensitized to house dust mites. 26
patients had positive reactions to conjunctival and/or bronchial challenge with
freeze-dried extracts of Blomia tropicalis and D. pteronyssinus, 23 of these
were positive by ImmunoCAP Allergen d201, House dust mite (Blomia
tropicalis). For the purposes of the clinical study, the clinical results used to
define the subjects were a clinical history, clinical symptoms compatible with
mite sensitization, and/or a positive result from either bronchial and/or
conjunctival challenge, irrespective of skin prick test results. For this study
values below 0.35 kU /L were reported as negative.

The study was designed to verify the immunological specificity of Blomia
tropicalis allergen solution as bound to ImmunoCAP Allergen d201, House
dust mite. The study was planned in accordance with appendix D
(“Specificity Analysis of Allergen-Containing Reagents”) in the CLSI
standard I/LA20-A2, “Analytical Performance Characteristics and Clinical
Utility of Immunological Assays for Human Immunoglobulin E (IgE)
Antibodies and Defined Allergen Specificities.” To establish the theoretical
response level for 100% inhibition, (“100%”), 90 µL of negative sample was
premixed with 90 µl of buffer. This is done to mimic the state where all IgE
antibodies are bound by the added soluble inhibitor (allergen) and thus leaving
no available IgE antibodies that may be bound to the ImmunoCAP Allergen
d201, House dust mite solid phase.
To establish the maximum response level for 0% inhibition, (“0%”), 90 µL of
positive sample was premixed with 90 µL buffer. To show an overall dose
dependent inhibition, 90 µL of positive sample was premixed with varying
dilutions of allergen solution (inhibitor). The allergen solution was serially
diluted with buffer in a 1/10-dilution sequence. The initial allergen solution
dilution factor is dependent on the concentration of the allergen solution at
hand. Subsequent dilutions were then adjusted to the 1/10-dilution sequence.
The unrelated allergen solutions were not further diluted. Only concentrated
solutions are used for the inhibition studies. The mixture was incubated in a
sample tube at 2-8°C for 16-24 hours before being analyzed with
ImmunoCAP Allergen d201, House dust mite on ImmunoCAP 100E
instrument according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The testing was
performed in duplicates in one assay run. Mean values were calculated. The
results are shown in Table 2 and Figures 1 and 2, below.
