L. Test Principle:
The Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System, Model GM550 uses electrochemical
methodologies. The system quantitatively measures blood glucose levels using an
amperometric method, which involves detecting the current produced from glucose
oxidation. The electrons generated during this reaction are transferred from the blood to the
electrodes. The magnitude of the resultant current is proportional to the concentration of
glucose in the specimen and the signal is converted into a readout displayed on the meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The within-run precision was tested using venous blood samples spiked to three
different glucose concentrations. Each sample was tested in ten replicates with two
test strip lots and five glucose meters, for a total of 50 measurements per meter, per
level. Results are summarized in the following tables:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To determine the linearity of the candidate device, venous blood samples with
fourteen different blood glucose levels, including samples below and above
measuring range, with the hematocrit between 35% and 50%, were tested with two
lots of test strips (lot #1 and lot #2), on the Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring
System, Model GM550 glucose meter in replicates of four. The YSI 2300 glucose
analyzer was used as the reference method. The measuring range of the device is 20
to 600 mg/dL.
Linear Regression Analysis:
Lot 1: y = 1.0036x – 1.2669, r2= 0.9993
Lot 2: y = 1.0044x – 1.6563, r2= 0.9992
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The method comparison was performed using the proposed device and a laboratory
analyzer.
The stability of the Rightest GS550 blood glucose test strips was demonstrated by
real-time stability studies. The YSI 2300 was used as a reference method. The
unopened shelf life, currently in progress, is 12 months and the open-vial stability is 6
months at the recommended storage temperatures of 39°F to 86°F.
Value assignment for use of the control solutions with the Rightest GS550 blood
glucose test strips is based on measurements using the YSI 2300 reference method
after calibration with YSI 2747 calibrator solution (NIST SRM #917b Clinical
Dextrose). The values for the Control Solutions are assigned by repeat analysis using
three different lots of GS550 test strips and ten Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring
Systems, Model GM550 meters. The mean and standard deviation are used to
establish the acceptable range for the strips. The range for each control solution is
provided in the labeling.
Stability characteristics of the Rightest Control Solutions were determined using real-
time studies. The unopened shelf-life is 24 months and the open vial stability is 90
days at the recommended storage of 39°F to 86°F.
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the system is 20 to 600 mg/dL. This range was verified by
the linearity study above. For values below 20 mg/dL the meter reads ‘LO”. For
values above 600 mg/dL the meter reads ‘HI”.
e. Analytical specificity:
A blood sample was collected from a volunteer and separated into aliquots. The
glucose levels were adjusted to low, normal and high concentrations by
supplementing each sample with a glucose solution. Each potential interfering
substance was added to aliquots of the low, normal and high glucose blood samples and
6

compared to the same sample without the potential interfering substance (control). The
following substances were evaluated: a) exogenous: acetaminophen, ascorbic acid,
dopamine, ibuprofen, L-dopa, methyldopa, salicylic acid, tetracycline, tolbutamide; b)
endogenous: bilirubin-conjugated, cholesterol, creatinine HCl, triglycerides, uric acid;
c) saccharide: maltose, xylose, galactose, lactose. All these compounds at the

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method Comparison:
A consumer study was performed with 114 lay-users and a technician to see if glucose
readings from the forearm, palm and fingertip were comparable to a laboratory glucose
method (Olympus 2700). The lay user population ranged in age, education, and was
about equally divided between males and females. The blood samples with glucose
concentrations ranging from 40 to 491 mg/dL were tested on two Rightest Blood
Glucose Monitoring Systems, Model GM550 glucose meters (the proposed device).
Five percent of the samples below 50 mg/mL were glycolyzed by allowing samples to
stay at room temperature and then tested. These measurements were compared to the
measurements obtained with the laboratory analyzer method. Distribution of blood
glucose concentration across the samples tested was in accordance with the
ISO15197. The studies met the ISO 15197 accuracy criteria where ninety-five percent
(95%) of the individual glucose results shall fall within ±15mg/dL of the results at
glucose concentrations <75mg/dL and within ±20% at glucose concentrations
≥75mg/dL. Results are summarized in the following tables:

2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes __x______ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, palm,
and forearm. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip there are no
special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
A single calibration code is programmed into the meters (software) at the time of
manufacturing and no user input is required for calibration.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor has two levels of controls available for this meter and the labeling provides
recommendations on when to test, such as before using the meter, when an new vial of
strips are opened, if the meter is dropped, damaged or exposed to liquids, when the
results are suspected to be inaccurate. An acceptable range for each control level is printed
in the control labeling. The user is referred to the troubleshooting section of the User’s
Manual if control results fall outside these ranges.
Customer service is available from Monday through Friday 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM PST.
Toll free phone number is 1-888-481-8485 for customer support. The user is instructed to
contact the Customer service line during the operational times or a healthcare provider
outside the operational times if the control results fall outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Altitude study:
An altitude study was performed to evaluate the altitude effect on venous blood samples.
The venous blood samples containing low, medium and high glucose concentration (30-
50 mg/mL, 80-120 mg/mL and 240-360 mg/mL) were tested at 0, 1000, 2000 and 3000m.
The YSI 2300 was used as a reference. Results of these studies are summarized below:
Bias
Venous blood - low glucose (30-50 mg/mL) - 5.5% -
6.2%
Venous blood - medium glucose (80-120 -3.1% - 3.2%
mg/mL)
Venous blood - high glucose (240-360 mg/mL) -5.7% - 4.4%

[Table 1 on page 10]
	Bias
Venous blood - low glucose (30-50 mg/mL)	- 5.5% -
6.2%
Venous blood - medium glucose (80-120
mg/mL)	-3.1% - 3.2%
Venous blood - high glucose (240-360 mg/mL)	-5.7% - 4.4%

The sponsor included the following warning in the label:
“Incorrect test results may be obtained at high altitude more than about 3048 meters
(10000 feet) above sea level.”
Hematocrit study: To study the effect of hematocrit, venous blood samples at three
glucose concentrations (40-70 mg/dL, 110-200 mg/dL and 300-450 mg/dL) and
hematocrit adjusted to 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 55, 60, and 70 were evaluated on the Rightest
Blood Glucose Monitoring System, Model GM550 and compared to the YSI values
obtained on the YSI 2300D STAT glucose analyzer.
The sponsor included the following warning in the label:
”Hematocrits below 30% may cause higher results, and hematocrits above 60% may
cause lower results.”
Temperature and humidity study: Studies were performed to demonstrate that this
device can be used at temperatures from 10 to 40 °C and at relative humidity ranging
from 10 to 90 %. Glucose control solutions with two glucose concentrations
(approximately 100 and 300 mg/dL) were used for the studies. The YSI 2300 was used
as a reference method. The results were reviewed and found to be acceptable (bias less
than ±10%).
A usability study was performed to assess the readability of the labeling. Flesch-Kincaid
readability assessment was conducted and the sponsor concluded that the 8 grader would
h
be able to read the entire labeling material.
Lay user questionnaire: 114 lay users evaluated the ease of use of the device and the
presentation of the labeling. All users thought that the device was easy to use and most
answer good and very good that the user manual was written to make it easy to use.
A time function study was performed to confirm that the performance of the Rightest
Blood Glucose Monitoring System, Model GM550 occurs within 5 seconds.
A specimen volume study was performed to demonstrate that the 1μl volume provides
accurate reading.
Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing was performed/passed and a certificate
to Bionime was provided.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
