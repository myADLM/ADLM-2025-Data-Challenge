510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
k092116
B. Purpose for Submission:
New device
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Medica Corporation
EasyCell Cell Locator
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
White blood cells (WBC) differential, red blood cell (RBC) characterization and
platelet estimation
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The EasyCell Cell Locator (EasyCell) automatically locates and presents images
of blood cells on peripheral smears. The operator reviews the suggested
classification of each white cell according to type and may manually change the
suggested classification of any cell. The operator can characterize red cell
morphology and estimate platelets based on observed images. The EasyCell is
intended to be used by skilled operators, trained in the use of the device and in the
identification of blood cells.
The major components of the EasyCell include two microscopes with 10X and
100X magnification, a 30-position slide carousel, a slide gripper and a positioning
system, and pattern recognition software. Each of the two microscopes is fitted
with a CCD camera to allow digital image capture.
2. Principles of Operation:
The EasyCell automatically scans the slide and captures images of white blood
cells, red blood cells and platelets. The images are preclassified by the
instrument’s ASSIST function and are displayed on the screen by cell type. Cell
images are grouped into eight categories: Neutrophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes,
Eosinophils, Basophils, Nucleated Red Blood Cells (NRBC), Smudge cells and
Other, which is intended to hold morphologically abnormal cells.
Preclassification is accomplished using a neural-network classifier. A trained
technologist then reviews the suggested classification of the cells. For each cell
the technologist can either accept the EasyCell recommended classification or
manually change the suggested classification to another cell type from an
expanded list that includes the more frequently encountered abnormal cell types.
The trained technologist can also review and report red blood cell morphology
and can review the numbers of platelets observed and report a platelet estimate.
Results are saved on the dedicated computer and can be reviewed, exported to a
laboratory information system, or printed. The EasyCell is network ready and can
be integrated into a laboratory computer network.
3. Modes of Operation:
Fully Automated Scan and Image Acquisition
4. Specimen Identification:
1

--- Page 2 ---
Glass microscope slides are labeled with barcodes. Up to thirty oiled slides can
be placed in a carousel.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
EasyCell scans oiled peripheral blood smears on glass microscope slides.
6. Calibration:
Calibration of the system is a two-step operation consisting of target location (for
positional calibration) and white balancing (for optical calibration). The built-in
target is used for both functions, so there are no additional external calibrators.
The user performs the positional calibration by choosing “Target Locator” from
the setup menu within the EasyCell software, and performs the optical calibration
by choosing “Calibration” from the setup menu.
The “Target Locator” function is recommended for daily use, and helps the user
set three critical stage locations within the EasyCell system: 10X Target Location,
100X Target Location and 10X Slide Focal Plane Location. “Calibration”
function is recommended for weekly use, and it automatically adjusts and records
the white balance settings for the target under both the 10x and 100x microscopes.
7. Quality Control:
One normal slide and one abnormal slide should be selected from the standard
workflow and processed using the EasyCell locating 200 cells for Quality Control
(QC) testing each day that slides are processed. The QC procedure controls for
slide preparation (both smearing and staining) and EasyCell performance. If the
QC procedure does not pass, the operator must resolve the problem and rerun the
QC before processing samples.

examination. A total of 304 specimens, including 155 specimens from normal
(healthy) subjects and 149 from subjects with specific disease conditions,
were collected and analyzed at three sites. Slides were prepared from each
specimen. The slides were randomly selected, blinded and read by two
technologists at each site. A total of 200 cells were counted for manual WBC
differential and by EasyCell.
i. WBC Differential: Results from Deming regression analyses on readings
with EasyCell and manual WBC differential are as follows:
Correlation
Cell Type Slope Intercept
Coefficient (r)
Neutrophil 0.99 1.00 0.39
Lymphocyte 0.98 1.00 0.88
Monocyte 0.93 0.85 0.59
Eosinophil 0.97 0.95 0.07
Clinical sensitivity and specificity of the EasyCell in identification of
morphological and distributional abnormalities were determined based on
the results of the manual WBC differential as either normal (i.e.
containing no abnormal cells or having normal distributions of normal
cells) or abnormal (i.e. containing morphologically abnormal cells or
having abnormal distributions of normal cells).
Morphological Distributional
Overall
Abnormality Abnormality
% agreement 82% 89% 84%
Sensitivity 84% 92% 91%
Specificity 82% 87% 72%
ii. Platelet Estimate Accuracy: Platelet counts were estimated by each
method as decreased (100,000 to 149,000 platelets), normal (150,000 to
400,000 platelets), or increased (401,000 to 499,000 platelets). A Cohen’s
kappa statistic was calculated to demonstrate the agreement between the
manual microscopy and EasyCell methods for each technologist. The data
show a good agreement between platelet estimates using the manual
microscopy and using EasyCell with a kappa score of 0.7 for each
technologist.
iii. RBC Morphology Accuracy: For each slide, the technologists classified
the red blood cells according to morphology with the manual microscopy
and EasyCell methods. The results showed >90% agreement between the
two methods.
b. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision/reproducibility study was performed at three different sites. Each
site prepared 20 slides from a different normal patient sample and used one
slide a day to perform a 200-cell differential count with both the manual WBC
differential and the EasyCell for a total of 20 days. The data show that

2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
a. Skip Rate
A study was performed to determine the rate of cells that were skipped when
moving from one field of view to the next. A total of 40 slides from 40
unique donors (20 normal, 20 abnormal) and a total of 11,151 WBC
candidates were examined. A total of 74 cells were skipped, for a skip rate of
0.66%, which was considered and deemed acceptable in the hazard analysis.
b. Reproducibility of Pre-Classification
A total of 20 slides from 10 normal and 10 abnormal samples were run on
three different EasyCell units for 5 consecutive days. Each slide was re-
blinded and re-randomized each day for reading. Overall imprecision of pre-
classification results from these repeated readings of the same 20 slides was
estimated as follows:

100 cell counts. The 100 cell count results were compared to the 200 cell
count by manual WBC differential.

As compared to the 200-cell count manual WBC differential, EasyCell with
100 cell counts showed similar clinical sensitivity and specificity as EasyCell
with 100 cell counts in identifying morphological and distributional
abnormalities based on the results of the manual WBC differential as either
normal (i.e. containing no abnormal cells or having normal distributions of
normal cells) or abnormal (i.e. containing morphologically abnormal cells or
having abnormal distributions of normal cells).
