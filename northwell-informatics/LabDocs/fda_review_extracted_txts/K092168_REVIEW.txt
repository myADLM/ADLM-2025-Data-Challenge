4. Special instrument requirements:
The labeling states that the CalChecks are for use with the Elecsys HCG+β
reagent on the Elecsys 2010/cobas e411 and Modular Analytics E170/cobas e601
test systems.
I. Device Description:
The Elecsys HCG+β CalCheck 5 is a lyophilized product consisting of human
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) purified from human urine in human serum matrix.
During manufacture, the hCG is spiked into the matrix at the target concentrations
listed below. CalCheck Level 1 contains no analyte.
Elecsys HCG+β Target Value (mIU/mL)
CalCheck level
Level 1 ≤ 0.2
Level 2 5
Level 3 5,000
Level 4 8,000
Level 5 10,000
The human source materials were prepared exclusively from the blood of donors
tested individually and shown to be free from HBsAg and antibodies to HCV and
HIV. The testing methods applied were FDA-approved or cleared in compliance with
the European Directive 98/79/EC, Annex II, List A.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and value assignment
Elecsys HCG+β CalCheck 5 is standardized using internally produced master
calibrators which are traceable to the 4 International Standard for HCG
th
(NIBSC) 75/589.
Each of the five CalCheck levels is value assigned using a minimum of three
Elecsys 2010/cobas e411 analyzers and four MODULAR ANALYTICS
E140/cobas e 601 analyzers. Each sample is tested in duplicate. The target
value for each CalCheck is the median of the observed values.
The labeling states that laboratories should establish appropriate acceptance
criteria when using this product for its intended use.
Stability
Real time and accelerated stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were
described and found to be adequate. CalCheck 5 is stable until the expiration date
printed on the vial when stored unopened at 2 – 8° C. The reconstituted vials are
stable for four hours at 20-25°C.
