I. Device Description:
HemoSIL AcuStar Anti-Cardiolipin (aCL) IgG is a chemiluminescent two-step
immunoassay consisting of magnetic particles coated with cardiolipin and human
purified β2GPI which capture, if present, the aCL antiphospholipid antibodies from
the sample. After incubation, magnetic separation and a wash step, a tracer consisting
of an isoluminol-labeled anti-human IgG antibody is added and may bind with the
captured aCL IgG on the particles. After a second incubation, magnetic separation,
and wash step, reagents that trigger the luminescent reaction are added, and the
emitted light is measured as relative light units (RLUs) by the ACL AcuStar optical
system. The RLUs are directly proportional to the aCL IgG concentration in the
sample.
The ACL AcuStar aCL IgG assay utilizes a 4 Parameter Logistic Curve (4PLC) fit
data reduction method to generate a Master Curve. The Master Curve is predefined
and lot dependent and it is stored in the instrument through the cartridge barcode.
With the measurement of calibrators, the predefined Master Curve is transformed to a
new, instrument specific 4PLC Working Curve. The concentration values of the
calibrators are included in the calibrator tube barcodes.
The aCL IgG kit consists of:
• aCL IgG Cartridge for 50 determinations: 1 cartridge containing 1 vial of
magnetic particle suspension coated with bovine cardiolipin and human purified
β2GPI, 1 vial of assay buffer, 1 vial of tracer consisting of an anti-human IgG
antibody labeled with isoluminol, and 1 vial of sample diluent used for regular
predilution of the sample and automated dilution in the rerun. The reagents are in
a phosphate or borate buffer containing bovine serum albumin, bovine cardiolipin,
human β2GPI, mouse monoclonal IgG, stabilizers, and preservative.
• aCL IgG Calibrator 1: 1 x 1 mL barcoded tube of a solution with aCL IgG in
saline solution containing bovine fetal serum, stabilizers and preservative.
• aCL IgG Calibrator 2: 1 x 1 mL barcoded tube of a solution with aCL IgG in
saline solution containing bovine fetal serum, stabilizers and preservative.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
When the rerun capability of the instrument is activated, the instrument makes
an automatic dilution and corrects the final result for the dilution factor (20x),
thereby expanding the test range 20-fold.

Value
Linearity (Rerun Off) 2.6 – 2024 U/mL

Value
Linearity (Rerun Off) 1.0 – 774 U/mL
Linearity (Rerun On) 1.0 – 15,480 U/mL
Linearity of both the HemoSIL aCL IgG and IgM assays was assessed by
preparing a series of dilutions of three different samples to cover the
reportable range. The linearity tests were performed with two different lots of
reagents. Overall, slope = 0.99-1.00 and r2 >0.99 for both assays over this
range.

The two calibrator values are assigned using in-house standards and a four-
parameter Master Curve. The assignment values of the two calibrators are
used to create a lot-specific four-parameter logistic curve, using two stored
parameters from the Master Curve and two lot-specific parameters based on
the calibrator values.
Control values assignments are performed using two QC approved batches of
reagents (with corresponding calibrators) and two different ACL AcuStar
instruments. The controls are analyzed in replicates of 10 on both instruments,
then the batches of reagent are switched between instruments and the controls
are re-analyzed.
Stability studies were performed that support a shelf-life of 15 months at 2-
8oC storage for the HemosIL AcuStar Anti-Cardiolipin IgG and the HemosIL
AcuStar Anti-Cardiolipin IgM reagent cartridges, as well as calibrators and
controls for both assays.
The on-board stability of the reagent cartridge after opening on the AcuStar
System was demonstrated to be at least 6 weeks. On-board stability of
calibrators was shown to be 3.5h. A comparison of fresh and frozen samples
showed no difference in the performance of these samples in the assay.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Detection (LOD) was determined to be 2.6 U/mL for the aCL
IgG assay and 1.0 U/mL for the aCL IgM assay. The LOD was determined
using the procedure described in CLSI EP17-A.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed using negative and positive samples, as
well as a sample with results close to the assay cutoff. No significant
interference was observed for either the HemoSIL AcuStar aCL IgG or IgM
assay with hemoglobin (up to 500 mg/dL), bilirubin (complexed and free, 18
mg/dL), triglycerides (1250 mg/dL), rheumatoid factor (800 IU/mL), LMW
heparin (2 IU/mL), and unfractionated heparin (2 IU/mL). Recoveries were
all in the range 96-103%.
The analytical specificities of the two kits were also evaluated by testing 30
defined serum samples, 10 positive for Rheumatoid Factor (RF), 10 positive
for Antinuclear Antibodies (ANA) and 10 positive for Syphilis by the rapid
plasma reagin test (RPR). One ANA sample gave a positive result on both the
HemoSIL AcuStar aCL IgG and IgM test. None of the RF or RPR samples
were positive on the AcuStar aCL tests.
f. Assay cut-off:
252 citrated plasma samples obtained from apparently healthy blood donors
were tested in the HemoSIL AcuStar Anti-Cardiolipin IgG and IgM assays.
Based on the recommendations of the International Committee in Sydney, the
threshold for positive aCL IgG and IgM antibodies was established in the 99th
percentile. The cut-off for both assays was set at 20 U/mL.
