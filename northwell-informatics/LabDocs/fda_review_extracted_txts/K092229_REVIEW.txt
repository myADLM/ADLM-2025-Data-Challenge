K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Not applicable.
L. Test Principle:
In this assay, patient sera, reference control, positive and normal controls are added to
the genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells which express
chimeric form of the human TSHR and a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)
induced luciferase reporter gene. The cells are seeded and grown for 15-18 hours to a
confluent monolayer in a 96-well plate prior to the addition of the samples. CHO cell
monolayer is incubated with patient serum for 3 hours to allow the binding of TSI
immunoglobulin to the chimeric human TSHR on the cell surface. This binding
induces a signaling cascade resulting in increased production of intra-cellular cAMP
which induces the production of luciferase. After incubation, the cells are lysed and
luciferase levels are measured with a luminometer. A significant increase in
luminescence over the Reference Control indicates the presence of TSI antibodies in
the sample. Patient samples are tested in duplicate and averaged.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A set of serum samples for testing was manufactured by diluting a single TSI
positive sample into normal human serum that had been previously screened
with the Thyretain bioassay. The sample set consisted of a sample that tests
above 300%, one that tests near 200%, one that tests positive near 140%, one
that tests near 100% (high normal) and one that tests near the limit of
detection. Each sample was tested in three duplicate runs per plate on two
assay plates per day for a total of 15 days:

over an eight day period. The total number of replicates for each sample is
180 (2x2x8x4 – 3x2x2x1). The data was summarized in the following table:

Specimen G Specimen G

Each site’s data were analyzed cumulatively to determine the reproducibility
of the panel samples when duplicate wells 1 and 2 were used. Sample E had a
positive ratio (Number Positive/Total Number Tested) of 55/60 and Samples F
and G had negative ratios (Number Negative/Total Number Tested) of 55/60
and 56/60, respectively. The overall co-efficient of variation (CV) % for
Samples E, F and G were 14.8%, 20.7%, and 21.0%, respectively.
Performance of the assay around the assay cut-off of 140% using duplicate
samples rather than triplicate samples was assessed by testing 20 samples
within ± 25% of the cut-off (10 above, 10 below) in quintuplicate. The first
three readings were averaged to replicate the original assay format results
while the fourth and fifth replicates were averaged to replicate the proposed
assay format. The difference between triplicate and duplicate results ranged
from 2 – 13%; the %CV between all five replicates ranged from 1.2% to
6.4%. Nineteen (19) of the 20 specimens (95%) had positive and negative
agreement between the two methods of calculation.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The traceability and stability of this assay were discussed in k083391.
d. Detection limit:

e. Analytical specificity:
The analytical specificity of this assay was determined in k083391.
f. Assay cut-off:

is considered positive for the presence of TSI if the SRR% measured ≥140%
over the Reference Control.

the Instructions for Use for TSI Reporter and the comparator device Product
Insert.
Comparison to Original Predicate:
As described in k083391, an initial study was performed at two testing sites

An additional study was performed at a third testing (Study Site 3) using 247
specimens evaluated by both the subject and comparator devices. All
specimens were handled in accordance with the procedure in the Instructions
for Use for TSI Reporter and the comparator device Product Insert. Sixteen
(16) of these specimens were excluded from statistical analysis due to
indeterminate results on the comparator device. Twenty-four (24) of the
remaining specimens were excluded from statistical analysis due to invalid

Comparison to Original Device:
The performance of the duplicate wells was compared to the triplicate wells
for all study sites. There was 100% agreement between the result obtained by
the original triplicate method and the result obtained by proposed duplicate
method at all sites. However, the number of null (invalid) samples was
different between the methods at Site 3 where there were 20 null results by the
triplicate method and 26 null results by the duplicate method. A null value is
defined as a CV greater than 15% between the replicates; the directions for
use caution not to report the assay results and suggest repeating the assay.
