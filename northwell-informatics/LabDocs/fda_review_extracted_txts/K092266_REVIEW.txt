2. Indication(s) for use:
Randox Methamphetamine Assay
The Randox Laboratories Ltd. Methamphetamine Assay is an in vitro diagnostic
test for the qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of Methamphetamine in
human urine at the cutoff of 1000 ng/mL. The assay is calibrated against
methamphetamine. Qualitative and semi-quantitative results can be utilized in the
diagnosis and treatment of Methamphetamine use or overdose. The Randox
Methamphetamine Assay has been developed for use on the RXseries analyzers,
which includes the Rx Daytona and the Rx Imola analyzers. This in vitro
diagnostic device is intended for prescription use only.
The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of
(1) enabling laboratories to determine an appropriate dilution of the
specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as GCMS
or
(2) permitting laboratories to establish quality control procedures.
This assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific
alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed
analytical result. Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) is the
preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment
should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the
preliminary result is positive.
Randox Multidrug Calibrator Set
The Randox Multidrug Calibrator Set consists of liquid calibrators containing
Methamphetamine, Oxazepam and Methadone. There are 5 levels of calibrator.
They have been developed for use in the calibration of Methamphetamine
Benzodiazepines and Methadone assays for use on the RXseries analyzers, which
includes the RX Daytona and the RX Imola analyzers. This in vitro diagnostic
device is intended for prescription use only.
Randox Multidrug Controls, Level 1 & 2
The Randox Multidrug Controls level 1 and 2 are liquid controls containing
Methamphetamine, Oxazepam and Methadone. There are 2 levels of controls.
They have been developed for use in the quality control of Methamphetamines,
Benzodiazepines and Methadone assays for use on the RXseries analyzers, which
includes the RX Daytona and the RX Imola analyzers. This in vitro diagnostic
device is intended for prescription use only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription use only

4. Special instrument requirements:
The studies were performed on the X Daytona and the X Imola analyzers.
I. Device Description:
The assay consists of ready-to-use liquid reagents. Reagent 1 contains mouse
monoclonal methamphetamine antibodies, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD), stabilizers and sodium azide <0.1% w/v. Reagent 2
contains amphetamine- labeled glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in
buffer and sodium azide <0.1% w/v. The calibrators and controls are ready to use
human urine-based liquid. The calibrators and controls are sold separately and
previously cleared for benzodiazepine and methadone.

L. Test Principle:
The Randox Methamphetamine assay is based on competition between drug in the
sample and drug labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PDH) for a fixed amount of antibody in the reagent. In the absence of drug in the
sample, the drug-labeled G6PDH conjugate is bound to antibody, thus the enzyme
activity id inhibited. When free drug is present in the sample, the antibody will bind
to the free drug and the unbound amphetamine-labeled G6PDH exhibits its maximal
enzyme activity. The G6PDH activity is measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm
because of conversion of NAD to NADH.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed by spiking a d-methamphetamine into
negative urine at various concentrations (-75%, -50%, -25%, +25% and 50%,
75% and 200% of the cutoff and negative). Concentrations were confirmed by
GC-MS. Studies were performed on 2 RX Daytona systems and 2 RX Imola
systems. Testing was performed twice a day for 20 non-consecutive days for
all concentrations.
During the study, a calibration was performed twice on each of 4 analyzers
and there were two operators. The results are presented in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity across the range was confirmed by spiking a drug free urine pool
with drug and serially diluting the sample into 20 additional concentrations.
Each sample was assayed on both the Daytona and Imola analyzers in the
semi-quantitative mode. The dilutions were assayed in triplicate then averaged
and compared to the expected result and the percent recovery was calculated.
Results are presented in the table below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators and controls for are traceable to Cerilliant Reference Standards and
confirmed by GC/MS.
An intermediate concentration of calibrators (designated as master calibrator) was
made by adding Methamphetamine Standard to buffered human urine matrix.
This master calibrator was value-assigned by GC/MS. The master calibrators are
then gravimetrically diluted using synthetic urine to various concentration levels.
The concentration values of diluted calibrators/controls are assigned using
GC/MS. These calibrators/controls become internal reference standards.
These internal reference standards are aliquoted and stored at below -80°C
environments and are used only for testing working calibrators (i.e. calibrators
used to produce products). The production protocol for internal reference
standards and working calibrators are identical except that the working calibrators
are tested against the internal reference standards.
Stability: Shelf-life and open-vial stability studies were performed for the
calibrators and controls using both accelerated and on-going real-time studies.
The protocols were found to be adequate. The Randox Methamphetamine
assay reagents, controls and calibrators are stable for 18 months when stored
unopened at +2 to 8°C and for 28 days once opened and stored at +2 to 8°C.

Calibrators and controls are sold separately. In the labeling the sponsor
recommends that users follow federal, state and local guidelines for testing
external quality control materials.
d. Detection limit:
Performance at low drug concentrations in the semi-quantitative assay was
characterized by the determination of recovery (see section b above).
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was established by spiking various concentrations of
structurally related into drug-free urine. Results are expressed as a minimum
concentration of metabolite or compound required to produce a response
approximately equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the assay. The percent
cross-reactivity of those compounds are presented below:

Endogenous Compounds:
The sponsor prepared urine-free samples spiked with d-methamphetamine at
concentration levels (±25% of the cutoff) and evaluated the possible interference
the following endogenous compounds; Total Bilirubin, Direct Bilirubin,
Creatinine, Urea, Glucose, H.S.A., Ethanol, Acetone, Gamma globulin, Oxalic
acid, Riboflavin, sodium Chloride, Boric acid, Sodium azide, Sodium fluoride.
No positive or negative interference was seen.
To test for possible positive and/or negative interference from specific gravity,
the sponsor prepared samples containing d-methamphetamine at concentration
levels (±25% of the cutoff) with specific gravities ranging from 1.000 to
10

1.030. No positive or negative interference due to specific gravity was
observed.
To test for potential positive or negative interference from pH the sponsor
prepared samples containing d-methamphetamine at concentration levels
(±25% of the cutoff) with pH values of 3, 4.5, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 11. No negative
or positive interference due to pH was observed.
f. Assay cut-off:
Analytical performance of the device around the claimed cutoff is described
in the precision section (1 a.) above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor conducted a method comparison study to evaluate the performance
of the device for detection of methamphetamine. In, the method comparison
study, 91 unaltered clinical samples (45 negative and 46 positive) were tested
with the Randox Methamphetamine assay and compared against the results
obtained with GC/MS. The results of the studies are presented below:
