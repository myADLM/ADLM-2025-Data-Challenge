2. Indication(s) for use:
The Randox Laboratories Ltd. Methadone Assay is an in vitro diagnostic test for
the qualitative and semi-quantitative detection of Methadone in human urine. The
cut off for both the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes of the assay is 300
ng/mL for methadone. The Randox Methadone Assay has been developed for use
on the Rx series analyzers, which includes the Rx Daytona and Rx Imola. This in
vitro diagnostic device is intended for prescription use only. The semi-
quantitative mode is for purposes of
1) enabling laboratories to determine an appropriate dilution of the
specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as GC/MS,
or,
2) permitting laboratories to establish quality control procedures.
This assay provides only a preliminary analytical result. A more specific
alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed
analytical result. Gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the
preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment
should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the
preliminary result is positive.
Randox Multidrug Calibrator Set
The Randox Multidrug Calibrator Set consists of liquid calibrators containing
Oxazepam and Methadone. There are 5 levels of calibrator. They have been
developed for use in the calibration of Benzodiazepine (Oxazepam) and
Methadone assays on the Rx series analyzers, which includes the Rx Daytona and
the Rx Imola. This in vitro diagnostic device is intended for prescription use only.
Randox Multidrug Controls, Level 1 and 2
The Randox Multidrug Controls, level 1 and 2 are liquid controls containing
Oxazepam and Methadone. There are 2 levels of controls. They have been
developed for use in the quality control of Benzodiazepine and Methadone assays
on the Rx series analyzers, which includes the Rx Daytona and the Rx Imola. This
in vitro diagnostic device is intended for prescription use only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription use only
This assay provides only a preliminary analytical result. A more specific
alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed
analytical result. Gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the
preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment
should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the
preliminary result is positive.

The Rx Daytona and Rx Imola analyzers were used to conduct performance
studies below.
I. Device Description:
The Randox Methadone assay is calibrated against methadone. The assay is a two
reagent system consisting of a murine monoclonal antibody/substrate reagent and the
enzyme-drug conjugate reagent. The Randox Multidrug Calibrator Set consists of 5
calibrators with methadone concentrations from 0 to 1,000 ng/mL in human urine.
They are ready to use. The Randox Methadone Controls, Level 1 and Level 2, are
derived from human urine and are ready to use. The control values are set at
approximately ± 25% of cutoff (300 ng/mL).

In the absence of drug in the sample, methadone-labeled G6PDH conjugate is bound
to antibody, and the enzyme activity is inhibited. However, when free drug is present
in the sample, antibody would bind to free drug; the unbound methadone-labeled
G6PDH then exhibits its maximal enzyme activity. Active enzyme converts
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH, resulting in an absorbance
change that can be measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A methadone negative urine pool was spiked with methadone to
concentrations of ± 25%, ± 50%, ± 75% and ± 100% of the cutoff of 300
ng/mL as confirmed by GC/MS. Samples were tested on two RX Daytona
and two RX Imola systems twice per day for 20 non-consecutive days (n=80)

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and Value Assignment: The Randox Methadone assay has 5
calibrator materials and two control materials that are traceable to master lots
that have been GC/MS quantified. The master calibrator and control stock
solutions are gravimetrically prepared using methadone from an outside
supplier who confirmed the purity of their material by GC/FID, HPLC and
NMR. The methadone concentration for the master lot is determined by
GC/MS. Value assignment for control materials and calibrator materials is
determined against the current master lot by performing nested testing of the
new control materials and the new calibrator materials. The new lots are
analyzed in replicates of 10. Results need to meet the sponsor’s pre-
determined acceptance criteria %CV and % recovery against the current
master lot.

Calibrator materials and control materials are sold separately.
Stability: Accelerated and Real-time stability studies were performed with the
control and calibrator materials at 2-8° C, 25° C and 37° C on the Rx Imola
and Rx Daytona. Methadone recoveries from the stressed material were
compared to fresh controls or calibrators stored at 2-8° C. Based on the real
time studies, the sponsor determined that calibrators and controls are stable for
12 months at 2-8° C. Open vials of calibrators and controls were stored at 2-
8° C and analyzed daily on the Rx Imola and Rx Daytona until the methadone
recovery exceeded the pre-determined acceptance criteria, which were found
to be adequate. Open vials of control materials and calibrator materials are
stable for 28 days at 2-8° C.
d. Detection limit:
Performance at low drug concentrations in the semi-quantitative assay was
characterized by the determination of recovery (see section b above).
e. Analytical specificity:
The cross-reactivity of the parent drug with endogenous compounds,
structurally related, and structurally unrelated compounds was evaluated by
adding known amounts of each potential interferent to drug-free urine spiked
with methadone to ± 25% of the cutoff (300 ng/mL). Samples were assayed
in quintuplets for the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes on the Rx
Daytona and Rx Imola for endogenous and structurally unrelated compounds
and in triplicate for structurally related compounds. The results were
compared to the appropriate sample containing no interferent. Interference
was defined as the concentration of each compound that had a response
approximately equal to that of the cutoff calibrator (as positive), or the
maximum concentration of the compound tested that remained negative. Any
compounds demonstrating interference were retested at lower concentrations
of the interferent to determine where interference began.
The interfering concentrations of endogenous, structurally unrelated, and
structurally related compounds that were equivalent to the cutoff (300 ng/mL)
were determined by comparing the absorbance readings of the samples
containing the interferent(s) to the absorbance of the calibrator at the cutoff
(300 ng/mL). Results are summarized below:

chloride added to achieve specific gravities of 1.000 (water blank), 1.010,
1.020, 1.030. Specific gravities were confirmed by a commercial method.
Each sample was analyzed in replicates of 10 in the semi-quantitative and
qualitative modes. Recoveries were compared to the spiked target samples
and were expected to be ≤ 10%. Specific gravity from 1.000-1.030 had no
significant (≤10%) effect on EDDP results for the Rx Daytona or Rx Imola.
pH studies were performed by spiking methadone into drug free negative
urine to achieve methadone concentrations at ± 25% cutoff. pH was adjusted
by adding either 1M HCl or 1M NaOH to obtain samples with pH levels of 3,
5, 7, 9, 11. pH was confirmed by a pH meter. Each sample was analyzed in
replicates of 10 in the semi-quantitative and qualitative modes. Recoveries
were compared to the pH 7 sample and were expected to be ≤ 10% of the
target values. pH from 3-11 had no significant (≤10%) effect on methadone
results for the Rx Daytona or Rx Imola.

Analytical performance of the device around the claimed cutoff is described
in precision section (1 a.) above.
