L. Test Principle:
The RANDOX ethanol assay is a ready-to-use liquid reagent. The assay is based on
the oxidation of ethyl alcohol to acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and
NAD to NADH, resulting in an absorbance change measured spectrophotometrically
at 340 nm. The concentration of ethanol alcohol is directly proportional to the ADH
activity, measured at 340 nm wavelength.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility studies were conducted by spiking serum or urine to the
following concentrations; 20 mg/dL, 50 mg/dL, 150 mg/dL, 300 mg/dL and
475 mg/dL. Testing was performed over 20 non-consecutive, two runs/day
and two replicates /run, 2 operators and 5 calibrations on the Imola and 6 on
the Daytona instruments for a total of 80 runs/concentration. The results are in
the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity samples for serum and urine were prepared from two pools of each
sample type with ethanol concentrations near the extremes of the assay range
(low pool and high pool). The two pools were mixed to create 9 additional
pools of intermediate concentrations. Five determinations of each pool were
tested on each instrument and a linear regression analysis was performed by
the method of least squares. The data provided in the tables below supports
the claimed measuring range for Imola serum and urine 3-500 mg/dL and
Daytona serum 8-500 mg/dL and urine 20-500 mg/dL.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrator and controls are prepared by spiking ethanol (supplied by Sigma-
Aldrich) into inorganic buffer. Value assignment is performed by testing new
lots of calibrator and control against the master lot.
Stability of the calibrators and controls was demonstrated by real-time
stability studies. Calibrators and controls come ready to use. The calibrator is
stable up to the expiry date (12 months) when capped and the open vial is
stable for 27 days stored at 2-8º C.
d. Detection limit:
The method to determine detection limit is based upon the CLSI document
EP17-A3. The study assayed 60 replicates of blank and 6 low positives
samples on both instruments for the LoB and LoD. The LoQ was determined
by assaying 200 replicates of each of 4 additional low positive samples on
both instruments. The results are presented in the Table below.

e. Analytical specificity:
The Randox ethanol assay was evaluated for interference. The interfernet was
spiked into serum and urine samples having ethyl alcohol concentrations of 10
and 100 mg/dL. The following substances at the tested concentration
demonstrated no significant bias (defined as < 10 %).

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Unaltered clinical 50 serum and 60 urine samples were used in the method
comparison study. All the samples were measured in singlet and only one
specimen per patient was obtained. Samples within the measurement range
were used in the data analysis. The correlation study between the device and
the predicate for urine and serum yielded the following results.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Ethyl alcohol is not present in detectable concentrations in healthy adults who
have not consumed ethanol.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
