Randox Benzodiazepine Assay has been developed for use on the Rx
series analyzers, which includes the Rx Daytona and the Rx Imola. This in
vitro diagnostic device is intended for prescription use only.
The semi-quantitative mode is for purpose of
(1) enabling laboratories to determine an appropriate dilution of the
specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as GCMS
Or
(2) permitting laboratories to establish quality control procedures.
The assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more
specific alternative chemical method must be used to obtain a
confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography /mass spectrometry
(GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical
consideration and professional judgment should be exercised to any
drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is
positive.
The Randox Multidrug Calibrator Set consists of liquid calibrators
containing Oxazepam. There are 5 levels of calibrator. They have been
developed for use in the calibration of Benzodiazepines (Oxazepam)
assays on the RX series analyzers, which includes the Rx Daytona and Rx
Imola. This in vitro diagnostic device is intended for prescription use only.
The Randox Multidrug Controls, level 1 and 2 are liquid controls
containing Oxazepam. There are 2 levels of controls. They have been
developed for use in the quality control of Benzodiazepine assays, on the
RX series analyzers, which includes the Rx Daytona and the Rx Imola.
This in vitro diagnostic device is intended for prescription use only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The assay is for in vitro prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The Rx Daytona and Rx Imola analyzers were used to conduct performance
studies below.
I. Device Description:
The assay consists of ready-to-use liquid reagents. Reagent 1 contains mouse
monoclonal anti-oxazepam antibody, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD), stabilizers and Sodium Azide <0.1%w/v). Reagent 2
contains oxazepam-labeled glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in buffer
with Sodium Azide <0.1% w/v.
The calibrators and controls are ready to use human urine-based liquid.

L. Test Principle:
The Randox Laboratory Ltd. Benzodiazepine Assay is an immunoassay with ready-
to-use liquid reagent. The assay is based on competition between drug in the sample
and drug labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for
a fixed amount of antibody in the reagent. In the absence of drug in the sample, the
antibody binds the conjugated oxazepam-labeled G6PDH thus the enzyme activity is
inhibited. When free drug is present on the sample, the antibody will bind to the free
drug and the unbound oxazepam-labeled G6PDH exhibits its maximal enzyme
activity. The G6PDH activity is measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm because
of conversion of NAD to NADH.

Precision was determined by spiking oxazepam into drug free urine at various
concentrations (-100%, -75%, -50%, -25%, +25%, at cutoff, +50%, +75% and
+100% of the cut-off). Concentrations were confirmed by GC/MS. Testing for the
intra-assay was performed once a day for 20 days. The between run testing was
performed in replicate twice a day for 20 days. The qualitative and semi-quantitative
results are presented below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The assay linearity was determined by testing the recoveries of a series of samples
diluted from a high concentration oxazepam sample. A high urine sample
containing around 1000 ng/mL oxazepam was serially diluted with analyte-free
urine and tested by 3 replicates in semi-quantitative mode. The results were
averaged and compared to the expected result and the percent recovery was
calculated. Results are presented in the tables below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and value assignment
The 5 levels calibrator (~0 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, 200 ng/mL, 300 ng/mL, 1000
ng/mL) and 2 levels control (150 ng/mL and 250 ng/mL) materials are both
traceable to master lots that have been GC/MS quantified. The master lots were
made by spiking oxazepam into a human urine matrix. Oxazepam is supplied by
Cerilliant Corporation, the accuracy of which is ensured by purity determination
(GC/FID, HPLC and NMR) and gravimetric preparation using balances calibrated
with NIST traceable standards. Each of the Randox calibrator/control level is
value assigned using Rx Daytona and Rx Imola. The target value for each level is
the median of the observed values.
Stability
Real time stability testing including shelf-life and on-board stability studies were
performed for the assay, controls and calibrators. The acceptance criteria were
found to be adequate. The Randox Benzodiazepine assay reagents, controls and
calibrators are stable for 12 months when stored unopened at 2 – 8° C and 28 days
on-board at approximately 100C.
d. Detection limit:
Performance at low drug concentrations in the semi-quantitative assay was
characterized by determination of recovery (see section b above).
e. Analytical specificity:
The Randox Laboratory Ltd. Benzodiazepine Assay was evaluated for
interference according to the CLSI Guideline EP7-A2 recommendations. These
studies were performed by spiking structurally related and unrelated compounds
into drug-free and drug-containing urine samples. Drug-containing urine samples
were tested at two different concentrations, +25% and -25% of the cut-off
concentration of 200 ng/mL. Drug-free urine samples were used as controls. %
cross-reactivity was calculated using the cross-reactant concentration that gives a
reaction absorbance which matches the reaction absorbance obtained by the cut-
off calibrator. The cut-off calibrator concentration divided by the cross-reactant
concentration that achieved the matching reactant absorbance x 100% gives the %
cross reactivity These studies were performed on both, the Rx Daytona and Rx
Imola analyzers. Similar results were obtained with both analyzers and in both
qualitative and semi-quantitative modes. The percent cross-reactivity of the tested
compounds are presented below:

In addition, the performance of the assay was evaluated under varying pH levels
of: 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11, which also had no effect on results. Further, variations in
specific gravity between 1.00 and 1.03 had no effect on results.

Not applicable. Not reviewed for this device type.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable. Not reviewed for this device type.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable; the device is for determining presumptive positive or negative
based on the analytical cutoff of 200 ng/mL.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Not applicable. The test is not intended for quantifying benzodiazepine; the semi-
quantitative mode is for purposes of (1) enabling laboratories to determine an
appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method
such as GCMS and (2) permitting laboratories to establish quality control
procedures.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
