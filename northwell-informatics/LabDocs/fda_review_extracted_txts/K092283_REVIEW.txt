Proteins contained in human body fluids form immune complexes in an immunochemical
reaction with specific antibodies. These complexes scatter a beam of light passed through
the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the concentration of the
respective protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison with a standard of
known concentration.
Dimension Vista® IGG 3 and 4
Polystyrene particles coated with antibodies specific to human IGG3 or 4 are aggregated
when mixed with samples containing IGG3 or 4. These aggregates scatter a beam of light
passed through the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to the
concentration of the respective protein in the sample. The result is evaluated by comparison
with a standard of known concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing for the IGG1-4 methods were performed over 20 days according to
CLSI EP5-A2, at a single site. A single instrument, a single reagent lot and two
operators were used. On each day of testing, each sample was run in duplicate, in
two separate runs. The test samples consisted of 3 levels of Dimension Vista®
Protein 1 Control, 2 serum samples and 2 plasma samples.
Serum and plasma pools for all methods were established at levels that encompassed
the analytical measuring range for each method. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
used to evaluate the data consistent with the recommendations of EP5-A2.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity
The linearity for the IGG1-4 methods was determined according to the CLSI EP-6-A.
One serum sample was serially diluted with System Diluent, and run in replicates of
five. The observed value represents the mean of the five replicates. The bias was
determined at each level. The acceptance criteria were defined as: the absolute value
for the Difference (g/L) [G] must not exceed the Limit (g/L) [H] or the absolute value
for the Relative Difference (%) [I] must not exceed the Limit (%) [J]. The Limit
(g/L) [H] is defined as 15% of Expected value [D] at Dilution factor level 0.075. For
all of the assays, the acceptance criteria were met.
IgG1
Testing was performed using a human serum sample (26.29 g/L) that was serially
diluted ten times. Expected concentrations vs. observed concentrations were plotted.
Regression analysis showed a slope of 0.996 and y intercept of -0.027. The linear
range was determined to be 2.34-26.29 g/L. The analytical measuring range was
established from the linear range and the results of the Limit of Quantitation study
and determined to be 2.20-23.40 g/L.
IgG2
Testing was performed using a human serum sample (9.9 g/L) that was serially
diluted eleven times. Measured concentrations vs. observed concentrations were
plotted. Regression analysis showed a slope: 0.993 and y intercept of 0.0098. The
linear range was determined to be 0.50-9.91 g/L. The analytical measuring range was

established from the linear range and the results of the Limit of Quantitation study
and determined to be 0.44-8.30 g/L.
IgG3
Testing was performed using a human serum sample (2.27 g/L) that was serially
diluted eleven times. Measured concentrations vs. observed concentrations were
plotted. Regression analysis showed a slope of 1.04 and y intercept of -0.0086. The
linear range was determined to be 0.057-2.55 g/L. The analytical measuring range
was established from the linear range and the results of the Limit of Quantitation
study and determined to be 0.035-1.57 g/L.
IgG4
Testing was performed using a human serum sample (2.833 g/L) that was serially
diluted ten times. Measured concentrations vs. observed concentrations were plotted.
Regression analysis showed a slope of 0.961 and y intercept of 0.017. The linear
range was determined to be 0.045- 2.833 g/L. The analytical measuring range was
established from the linear range and the results of the Limit of Quantitation study
and determined to be 0.057-2.55 g/L.
Recovery
A recovery study was performed by mixing equal volumes of two patient samples of
known quantity for each of the IGG 1-4 assays.
For IgG1, recovery ranged from 93-100% with a mean of 96%
For IgG2, recovery ranged from 91.2-96.2%, with a mean of 93.2%
For IgG3, recovery ranged from 91-105%, with a mean of 99%.
For IgG4, recovery ranged from 99-105%, with a mean of 102%.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There are no reference standards for IgG1 to IgG 4. IGG1-4 calibrator and control
value assignment and stability data were provided in k071980. The calibrator master
lot values for IgG 1-4 are assigned versus ERM-DA 470 (CR 470) using
independently determined values for subclasses compared to total IgG value of the
reference material.
d. Detection limit:
For each of the IgG subclasses, three serum samples with known concentrations of
the IgG subclass were spiked with ERM®-DA 470 – a reference material certified for
the mass concentration of 12 serum proteins (diluted with system diluent). For each
IgG subclass, two concentrations were tested, both chosen to challenge the low end of
the analytical measuring range and the extended low end. At each concentration,
three samples were tested; three replicates per sample per run, for each of 5 runs.
Testing was performed in one day with a single reagent lot, calibrator lot, instrument
and operator and the mean and SD for the 15 replicates of each sample was
calculated. The per sample bias (Bias = Mean - sample concentration) and the
average bias, across the three samples, were calculated. The pooled SD across the
three samples per the formula in Appendix B of CLSI EP17-A was calculated. The
observed Total Analytical Error was calculated as Average Bias +2*Pooled SD.
Based on the calculated Total Analytical Error, the LOQ was determined. The
6

--- Page 7 ---
extended low range was calculated to measure low concentrations, such as those seen
in children, for each of the IgG subclasses.
IgG1
Concentrations tested were 2.2 g/L (initial assay range) and 0.44 g/L (extended low
assay range). These levels were chosen to challenge the low end of the analytical
measuring range (1:400 dilution) and the extended low range (1:20 dilution). The
limit of quantitation (LoQ) was determined to be 2.2 g/L. The extended limit of
quantitation for IgG1 was determined to be 0.44 g/L.
IgG2
Concentrations tested were 0.44 g/L (initial assay range) and 0.11 g/L (extended low
assay range). These levels were chosen to challenge the low end of the analytical
measuring range (1:100 dilution) and the extended low range (1:5 dilution). The
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for IgG2 was determined to be 0.44 g/L. The extended
low range was determined to be 0.11 g/L.
IgG3
Two concentrations were tested, 0.04 g/L (initial assay range) and 0.002 g/L
(extended low assay range). These levels were chosen to challenge the low end of the
analytical measuring range (1:2000 dilution) and the extended low range (1:20
dilution). The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for IgG3 was determined to be 0.04 g/L.
The extended low range was determined to be 0.002 g/L.
IgG4
Two concentrations were tested, 0.06 g/L (initial assay range) and 0.003 g/L
(extended low assay range). These levels were chosen to challenge the low end of the
analytical measuring range (1:200 dilution) and the extended low range (1:20
dilution). The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for IgG4 was determined to be 0.06 mg/L.
The extended low range was determined to be 0.003 g/L.
Hook effect
The possibility of a hook effect occurring when using the IGG1-4 assays was
evaluated. No hook effect was seen in concentrations up to: 78.6 g/L for IgG1; 51.9
g/L for IgG2; 35.7 g/L for IgG3; and 35.1 g/L for IgG4.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed according to CLSI/NCCLS EP7-A2 to determine
the effect of various endogenous and exogenous substances on the Dimension Vista
IGG1-4 assays. For all interferents except rheumatoid factors (RF), the percent bias
was determined by testing a control sample without the interferent and comparing it
to the value obtained from a test sample to which the potential interferent had been
added. Test samples were prepared by spiking the potential interferent into serum.
IgG1 concentrations ranged from 4.79 - 12.8 g/L
IgG2 concentrations ranged from 1.48 - 7.31 g/L
IgG3 concentrations ranged from 0.225 - 0.781 g/L
IgG4 concentrations ranged from 0.471 - 1.892 g/L
7

--- Page 8 ---
To evaluate interference from rheumatoid factors, samples with known levels of IgG
subclasses 1-4, which had elevated RF concentrations and samples with no detectable
RF concentration, were used to prepare samples for the study. One to one mixtures of
samples of non-detectable levels of RF with samples with high concentrations of RF
were prepared and the IGG1-4 assays concentrations determined in replicates of five
on the Dimension® Vista System. For lipemic samples: special handling instructions
include clarification by centrifugation (10 min at approximately 15,000 xg) prior to
testing. Since specimens should be free of particulate matter, lipemic or turbid
samples, which cannot be clarified by centrifugation, must not be used. Recovery for
the IGG1-4 were tested and met the acceptance criteria of bias <10%.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The new assays (Dimension Vista IGG 1-4) were compared to the predicate assays (N
Antiserum to Human IgG subclasses 1 and 2 and the N Latex IgG3 and IgG4 on the
BN Prospec System). Single determinations from 129-150 serum and plasma
(lithium and sodium heparin) samples were run according to EP9-A2 on both the new
and predicate assays for both the reportable and extended range. Passing-Bablok
regression analysis was used to analyze the data for the initial measuring range.

(0.062 – 2.50) (1.004, 1.035) (-0.015, -0.004)
The performance of the low and high samples run with a new dilution was
demonstrated by running a method comparison study versus the BN Prospec in the
extended range low and high. The low extended range was validated by evaluating
serum samples at a lower dilution. The high extended range was validated by
evaluating serum samples at a higher dilution.

b. Matrix comparison:
A separate study was performed using matched serum and plasma samples on the
Dimension Vista® System. In this study, matched samples of serum, lithium heparin,
sodium heparin and EDTA were tested on the Dimension Vista® System. For each
plasma type, the % recovery and regression analyses compared to serum were
performed. The acceptance criteria: a correlation coefficient of ≥ 0.950 and a mean
of % differences in recovery versus serum of ≤ 7%. All samples met the acceptance
criterion.

The expected values were confirmed by running a reference interval transference study
following the NCCLS/CLSI Guideline C28-A2. Twenty normal clinical samples were
run in triplicate, and the mean of the three runs was calculated. The acceptance criterion
for this study was that not more than two of twenty (10%) values could be outside the
published range. The acceptance criterion was met for all of the assays within the adult
and pediatric reference ranges.
