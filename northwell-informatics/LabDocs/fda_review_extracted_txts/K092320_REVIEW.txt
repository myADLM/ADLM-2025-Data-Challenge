I. Device Description:
The Elecsys PreciControl ThyroAB is a lyophilized product consisting of human
serum with added anti-TSHR antibody (human), anti-TPO antibody (sheep) and anti-
TG antibody (sheep) in two level ranges each. During manufacture, the antibodies are
spiked into the matrix at the desired concentration levels.
Reagents - working solutions
• PC Thyro1: 2 bottles for 2 x 2.0 mL of control serum (human)
• PC Thyro2: 2 bottles for 2 x 2.0 mL of control serum (human)
Safety data sheet available for professional user on request.
All products derived from human blood are prepared exclusively from the blood of
donors tested individually and shown to be free from HBsAg and antibodies to HCV
and HIV. The testing methods applied were FDA-approved or cleared in compliance
with the European Directive 98/79/EC, Annex II, List A. Disposal of all waste
material should be in accordance with local guidelines.

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Roche Diagnostics maintains a set of master calibrators for each assay that
have values assigned that are traceable to the National Institute of Biological
Standard and Control (NIBSC) standards. The Elecsys PreciControl products
are assayed and compared to these reference preparations and target values
and ranges are assigned. Anti-TSHR is standardized against NIBSC 1st IS
60/972 Standard. Anti-TPO is standardized against the NIBSC 66/387
Standard. Anti-TG is standardized against the NIBSC 65/93 Standard.
The protocols for establishing shelf-life and open-vial stability were reviewed
and adequate. An accelerated stability study was performed to simulate a shelf
life of 15 months at normal storage conditions of 2-8°C. Reconstituted
Elecsys PreciControl ThyroAB for anti-TPO and anti-TG is stable: one month
at -20°C, 3 days at 2-8°C and up to 5 hours at 20-25°C. Reconstituted Elecsys
PreciControl ThyroAB for anti-TSHR is stable: one month at -20oC and up to
5 hrs at 20-25oC. Protocol for real time stability and 15 month data are
provided. Shelf life will be increased to 18, 21 and 24 months after stability
data at additional time points is available.
Each control level was tested on a total of twelve Elecsys immunoassay
analyzers (4 Elecsys 1010 analyzers, 4 Elecsys 2010/cobas e 411 analyzers,
and 4 Elecsys MODULAR ANALYTICS E170/cobas e 601 analyzers) using
Elecsys reagents.
Samples were assayed in two independent series using duplicate testing on
each analyzer for each analyte. The target value for each analyte in the
