diagnosis of an acute or recent rubella infection, including in women of
childbearing age.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Previously cleared with: K961481 (Elecsys 2010 and E170); K060373 (cobas
e601). Inclusion of the cobas e analyzers in the labeling has been accepted
previously for K072617 and K073501 after review by FDA on Dec. 10, 2008.
I. Device Description:
Samples are incubated with biotinylated monoclonal anti-human IgM-specific
antibodies and rubella-specific recombinant antigens, forming a complex with the
anti-rubella IgM antibodies present in the sample. The addition of ruthenium-labeled
rubella specific antibodies and streptavidin-coated microparticles forms a sandwich
complex via biotin-streptavidin interaction. The reaction mixture is aspirated into the
measuring cell where the microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of
the electrode, and unbound substances are then removed with ProCell. Voltage
application to the electrode induces chemiluminescent emission, which is then
measured by a photomultiplier. Results are determined via a calibration curve
generated by 2-point calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent barcode.

streptavidin microparticles and electrochemiluminescence detection. The Rubella
IgM is composed of a biotin-labeled monoclonal antibody against human IgM, a
Rubella-like particle and a ruthenium-labeled anti-Rubella antibody. A relationship
exists between the concentration of the IgM antibody targets present in a patient
sample and the level of signal count detected by the system. The IgM assay is a
qualitative test based on a cut-off formula dependent on the negative and positive
calibrators. Cut-off index (COI) is based on the ratio of assay signal to cut-off signal
(also abbreviated s/co). COI values equal to or greater than 1.0 are considered
positive for the presence of anti-Rubella IgM antibody. Results are determined using
a 2 point calibration. The test system contains the human serum-based calibrators
intended for use with the system. The Elecsys Precicontrol Rubella IgM contains two
levels of human serum. The positive control contains native, inactivated Rubella IgM
antibodies.
The Elexsys PreciControl Rubella IgM contains two levels of human serum. The
positive control contains native, inactivated Rubella IgM antibodies.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was determined at three different external sites (Site A, B, and
C) using Elecsys reagents, human sera, and controls in a modified protocol
(EP5-A2) of the CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute): 6 times
daily for 10 days (n = 60). Precision was determined at one internal site (Site
D), where the samples were run 20 times for repeatability and tested twice a
day for 10 days (n=100) for intermediate precision. Note that the site C
intermediate precision %CV values (using the Elecsys 2010 and cobas e 411
analyzer) are significantly higher than those from sites A and B (using the
Modular Analytics E170 and cobas e 601). The following results were

Note: the panels used for the precision/reproducibility studies presented here
have suboptimal samples regarding the cutoff. Such a panel configuration was
acceptable at the time of the original submission. Going forward, newer and
current recommendations reflected in published FDA guidelines establish the
need for evaluation of samples with values very close to the cutoff (low
positive, high negative) for the precision/reproducibility studies. See
appropriate FDA guidance documents.
Quality Control:
Quality control is done using the Elecsys PreciControl Rubella IgM. The
controls 1 and 2 should be run as single determinations at least once every 24
hours when the test is in use, once per reagent kit, and after every calibration.
The control intervals and limits should be adapted to each laboratory’s
individual requirements. Results must be within the defined limits. If control
values fall outside of the expected range(s), patient results should not be
reported and samples and controls should be retested. The recommended
quality control material is serum based. The user is responsible for providing
alternate control material for plasma samples when necessary. Applicable
government regulations and local guidelines for quality control should be
followed.

Samples:
The potential influence of frozen human serum samples after storage at -20C
for 3 months was evaluated using recovery of 3 negative, one low positive,
and 3 positive samples vs. a fresh reference, and deemed satisfactory.
Similarly, studies of 6 freeze thaw cycles, sample stability for 3 weeks at 4 C,
and sample stability at 25 C for 3 days resulted in satisfactory recovery within
the specified acceptance criteria.
d. Detection limits:
Range for the electrochemiluminescence signals (counts) for the calibrators:
Negative calibrator (Cal1): 500-2700 (Elecsys 2010, MODULAR
ANALYTICS E170 and cobas e analyzers).
Positive calibrator (Cal2): 5500-30000 (Elecsys 2010, MODULAR
ANALYTICS E170 and cobas e analyzers).
The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined on Elecsys 2010 Immunoassay
Analyzer as the 95th percentile of measurements of blank samples. 5 samples
were measured 12 times with single determination. The measurements were
then ordered according to their values and the 95th percentile was determined,
interpolating between the results of 57th and 58th ranked samples as follows:
LoB = (Conc. Sample 57 + Conc. Sample 58)/2.
The LoB was: 955 counts (corresponding to concentration of ~54.24 U/mL).
Limit of detection (LoD) was evaluated on Elecsys 2010 Immunoassay
Analyzer according to the guidelines of CLSI EP 17-A.The LoD was
determined as the lowest amount of Analyte in a sample that can be detected
with 95% probability. 5 samples with low concentration were measured 12

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity:
The specificity of the Elecsys Rubella IgM was evaluated by testing a total of
60 specimens representing a variety of disease states (ANA, CMV, EBV,
FTA, HBV, HCV, HIV 1/2, HSV, Mumps, Parv B19, RH, VZV). The testing
results are summarized in the table below. For all analytical specificity
categories tested, 77.6 % overall agreement was observed between the Elecsys
immunoassay and an FDA-cleared reference method.

observed to cause any consistent bias, but RF factor levels > 1650 IU/mL may
lead to erroneous results in some instances. Elevated levels of unspecific
human IgM may cause interference.
In vitro tests were performed on 18 commonly used pharmaceuticals
(Acetylcysteine, Ampicillin-Na, Ascorbic acid, Ca-Dobesilate, Ciclosporine,
Cefoxitin, Heparin, Intralipid, Levodopa, Methyldopa, Metronidazole,
Phenylbutazone, Doxycycline, Acetylsalicylic acid, Rifampicin,
Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen, and Theophylline) and in addition on folic acid.
No interference with the assay was found.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cutoff for the Elecsys Rubella IgM assay was initially established by
measuring 162 positive rubella samples from 18 commercially available
seroconversion panels; and 298 negative samples collected from blood donors.
The distribution of positive, equivocal and negative results was compared to
results from various reference assays and the cutoffs were set as noted below.
This setting revealed an excellent separation of negative and positive samples
exhibiting only 2 equivocal results out of 460. The resulting cutoff was
verified using another reagent kit lot; and was then applied to the performance
evaluation studies described below. The result of a sample is given either as
reactive or non-reactive as well as in the form of a cutoff index (signal
sample/cutoff). Results obtained with the Elecsys Rubella IgM assay can be
interpreted as follows:
Non-reactive: < 0.8 COI; Indeterminate: ≥ 0.8 - < 1.0 COI; Reactive: ≥ 1.0
COI
Samples with a cutoff index < 0.8 are non-reactive in the Elecsys Rubella IgM
assay. Samples with a cutoff index between ≥ 0.8 and < 1.0 are considered
indeterminate. The sample should be retested. In case the result is still
indeterminate, a second sample should be collected e.g. within 1 week. A
significant increase of the Rubella IgG antibody titer from a first to a second
sample supports the diagnosis of acute Rubella infection. Samples with a
cutoff index ≥ 1.0 are reactive in the Elecsys Rubella IgM assay.
The magnitude of the measured result above the cutoff is not indicative of the
total amount of antibody present in the sample. The anti-Rubella IgM results
in a given specimen, as determined by assays from different manufacturers,
can vary due to differences in assay and reagent methods.
Calculation
The analyzer automatically calculates the cutoff based on the measurement of
Cal1 and Cal2.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:

--- Page 10 ---
The performance of the Elecsys Rubella IgM assay was determined by percent
agreement among negative samples and percent agreement among positive
samples, against a consensus comparator method, in specific populations.
For the clinical routine and the banked positive cohorts, a consensus
comparator method was defined using a total of three FDA-cleared predicate
devices and a two out of three consensus result approach as described in the
following table:
Predicate Test Results (In Any Order) Final Reference
Result A Result B Result C Result
+ + (- , Equ, or + ) +
- - (-, Equ, or +) -
Equ Equ (-, Equ, or +) Equ
+ - Equ Equ
All specimens were tested according to the respective package inserts of the
FDA-cleared Rubella IgM assays. The three FDA-cleared devices used were
the Zeus Scientific Rubella IgM ELISA Test System, the Abbott Labs.
AxSYM Rubella IgM Antibody Assay and the DPC Immulite IgM test.
Equivocal results that remained equivocal after being retested were considered
equivocal for the performance analysis. Any consensus equivocal result
discordant with the Elecsys Rubella IgM test result was tallied against the
Elecsys in the calculation of performance.
For the vaccine follow up cohort, the Zeus Rubella IgM device was used as
the sole comparator.
b. Matrix comparison:
The effect of analyte detection in the presence of anticoagulants with the
Elecsys Rubella IgM was determined on Elecsys 2010 Immunoassay Analyzer
by comparing values obtained from samples drawn into Serum-gel
Separation-, Li-Heparing-, Citrate-Plasma-, K -EDTA Plasma-, and Plasma
3
Separation tubes. Reference was normal Serum tube without gel. Acceptance
criterion for all measurements concerning Serum/Plasma interferences is
recovery ≤ 0.5 S/CO +/- 0.25 S/CO, > 0.5 S/CO mean recovery 80-120%.
The following tables summarize the results for the comparison between serum
and 3 plasma matrices.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity: N/A
b. Clinical specificity: N/A
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Percent positive and percent negative agreement with a consensus comparator
method was determined as specified under Comparison Studies (see above).
Studies were carried out in three independent testing sites (two sites within the
US, one in Germany).
Prospective US clinical study cohort:
501 samples were obtained from a US reference laboratory; representing
subjects for whom anti-Rubella testing had been ordered per clinical routine.
All samples were frozen sera which had been banked consecutively from the
routine collective. 438 were from females (132 of whom were pregnant) and
63 were from males; ages ranged from 18-76 years. Samples were tested on
the Elecsys 2010 analyzer and on three FDA-cleared devices, which were
used to define a consensus comparator algorithm result using a two-out-of-
three approach.

Preselected positive samples cohort:
Due to the extremely low prevalence of IgM positive subjects, 100 additional
preselected samples from commercial sources were tested. 100 samples which
had tested positive for Rubella IgM were purchased from a US commercial
source. All samples were frozen sera. 50 were from females (2 of whom were
pregnant) and 50 were from males; ages ranged from 24 - 51 years. Samples
were tested in a blinded fashion (together with negative samples).

Vaccination follow up cohort:
Commercially available vaccination follow-up panels comprising 144 samples
from 12 subjects (4 male, 8 unknown) were tested to evaluate detection of
IgM after vaccination. The first positive bleed of the test was compared to the
first positive bleed of the predicate assay, yielding 100 % agreement between
the two methods, with 12/12 positive test results.
Instrument comparison:
Approach to the validation of the different instruments was addressed in a
previous FDA decision, see file k072617 for additional details. A total of 313
samples, obtained from blood donors or purchased from commercial sources,
were tested on both the Elecsys 2010 and cobas e 411 analyzers and the
MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 and cobas e 601 analyzers. Samples had
anti-Rubella IgM values ranging from 0.15 - 14.0 COI. The positive
agreement was 102/103 or 99.0 % (95 % CI: 95 % - 100 %). The negative
agreement was 207/208 or 99.5 % (95 % CI: 97 % - 100 %).
4. Clinical cut-off:
