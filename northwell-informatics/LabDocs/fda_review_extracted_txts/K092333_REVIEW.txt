PATHIAMTM System with iScan for p53 and Ki-67
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Computer-assisted image analyzer for Ki-67 and p53 nuclear proteins detected by
immunohistochemistry
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The PATHIAMTM System with iScan is a complete system for image acquisition and
image analysis by assessment of shape, size, and density of a digital image of a
specimen.
In the current application, the system provides a quantitative assessment of p53 or Ki-
67 staining intensity in the fields chosen by a pathologist, and displays a score, which
can be reviewed by the pathologist as he/she views the digital image of the selected
field. The system software makes no independent interpretations of the data.
PATHIAMTM employs several quality assurance algorithms to assure that only
readable images are processed by the software.
Samples are obtained as formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks. Histologic
sections are prepared and mounted onto glass slides. Slides are reacted with either Ki-
67 or p53 primary antibodies, using validated methods. Slides are visualized using
diaminobenzidine (DAB), again using validated methods. Prepared slides are loaded
into the iScan scanner and scanned. The resulting digital images are reviewed by the
pathologist on a computer monitor, and appropriate fields of view (FOVs) are then
selected for analysis by the PATHIAMTM software. The PATHIAMTM software
produces a “percent positive” result for the specific immunohistochemical study (Ki-
67 or p53), and the pathologist has the choice of accepting the result or entering
his/her own score.
2. Principles of Operation:
A. System Overview:
The PATHIAM™ System is an instrument and software system designed to
assist the qualified pathologist in the consistent quantitative assessment of
protein expression in immunohistochemically stained histologic sections from
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded normal and neoplastic tissues. The system
consists of a slide scanner (iScan), computer, monitor, keyboard, mouse,
image analysis algorithms for specific immunohistochemical markers, and
software with a Windows web browser-based user interface. PATHIAMTM is
a web-based, end-to-end digital pathology software solution that allows
pathology labs to acquire, manage, view, analyze, share, and report on digital
images of pathology specimens. Using the PATHIAMTM software, the
pathologist can view digital images at various magnifications, add
1

--- Page 2 ---
annotations, make measurements, perform image analysis, and generate
reports.
B. Hardware: The iScan slide scanning device captures digital images of
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues that are suitable for storage and
viewing. The device includes a digital slide scanner, racks for loading glass
slides, computer, scanner software, keyboard, mouse and monitor.
C. Software: The PATHIAMTM software is designed to complement the routine
workflow of a qualified pathologist in the review of immunohistochemically
stained histologic slides. It allows the user to select fields of view (FOVs) in
the digital image for analysis and provides quantitative data on these FOVs to
assist with interpretation. The software makes no independent interpretations
of the data and requires competent human intervention at all steps in the
analysis process.
D. Assay specific Overview:
PATHIAMTM employs image analysis techniques to obtain Ki-67 or p53
scores. Pre-defined parameters are used to obtain Ki-67 or p53 scores. The
identification of the nucleus is carried out automatically by the image analysis
algorithms. The steps involved in the analysis algorithms are:
a. Enhancing the image. This process increases the contrast to make the
image more suitable for analysis.
b. Identifying the epithelial area. The epithelial area is the region of the
image where there is the possibility of epithelial cells being present.
c. Identifying the nucleus.
d. Classifying the cells based on extent, intensity, and thickness of nuclear
staining.
e. Computing the score.
E. Principal of Operation
After the initial image quality check, the algorithm goes through the following
steps before generating the analysis results:
1. Field of View (FOV) identification: The algorithm separates the tissue area
from the background such that only the tissue area is processed in the
following steps.
2. Preprocessing: The algorithm generates two images after preprocessing. One
of them is a contrast stretched image, and the other is an image with each of
the tissue areas of interest (AOI) pixels classified as stained or non-stained.
3. Segmentation: This processing step consists of extracting the objects of
interest from the image. In the current applications, the objects of interest are
epithelial cell nuclei. These are separated out from the rest of the identified
objects using morphological properties, such as size and shape.
4. Classification: The segmented nuclei are classified as stained cells or non-
stained cells based on the percentage of stained pixels within them.
5. Scoring / Grading: Based on the classification, an overall score for the
image is computed using the numbers of stained cells, non-stained cells and
total cells for the calculations.
3. Modes of Operation:
Semi-automated computer-assisted interpretation
2

--- Page 3 ---
4. Specimen Identification:
Specimens are identified by barcode read or through manual entry into
automation software.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimens are prepared microscope slides. The device scans the slides and takes a
digital image of these. Slides can be scanned individually or placed in racks and
up to 160 may be scanned automatically. Areas of the slide to be analyzed
(sampling) are suggested by software algorithm and the subset of these to actually
be measured is determined by the user.
6. Calibration:
The instrument does not have calibrators for the assay. Typically, calibration is
done on an image capture device through white and black balance.
7. Quality Control:
The quality of results depends on the laboratory following the quality control
instructions recommended in the labeling of the immunohistochemistry (IHC)
reagents. The software also performs a quality check on the digital images to
determine if they are suitable for further analysis using “Image Quality
Assessment” algorithms.

FDA’s “Guidance for the Content of Premarket Submissions for Software Contained
in Medical Devices”, May 11, 2005
J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
Data represented for System Precision involved studies using Tissue micro-arrays
(TMAs), rather than whole pathological sections. TMAs were prepared and
stained by Ohio State University Medical Center. The final test sets consisted of
188 sample cores placed on 5 slides. As some cores were excluded from one
antibody study or the other, the final number of specimens used for testing was
reduced to 120 for each antibody. Each tissue core was approximately 2 mm in
diameter, which represents approximately 16 fields of View (FOV) with a 40x
objective of 4 fields of view with a 20x objective.
a. Accuracy (Comparison to Manual Method):
Between-Pathologists Agreement: A single pathologist at three sites evaluated
120 cases each for p53 or Ki-67 staining on glass slides. This data is presented in
the tables below as Manual vs. Manual scoring. These studies met the minimum
criteria of 75% concordance for each clinical cut-off value used.

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
Intra-Pathologist Precision: The slides were scanned by BioImagene and the
digital images were presented to a single pathologist for evaluation using
PATHIAM™ software. This independent pathologist scored a subset of 20
cases (out of the complete 120 TMA sets) 3 times over a minimum of 10 days.
The study met the minimum criteria of 75% concordance for each clinical cut-
off value used.

Intra-Instrument and Instrument-to-Instrument Precision: Eight single cores
from a total of four TMA slides were scanned five times on three systems at
BioImagene. The three systems included matching computers, monitors and
iScan slide scanners.
The Intra-Instrument precision of automated signal detection for each system
was measured when the slides were stained with either p53 or Ki-67. The raw
data recordings from each machine were at or below 2.67 %CV for p53 and at
or below 2.9% for Ki-67. All of these values are similar to those achieved
with the predicate device and were considered acceptable.
The data from precision testing on the individual PATHIAMTM with iScan
systems was compared to provide Instrument-to-Instrument precision. This
was calculated to be 4.55 %CV or lower for p53 and 2.14% or lower for Ki-
67. All of these values are similar to those achieved with the predicate device
and were considered acceptable.

monoclonal antibody and DAB detection and for the identification of Ki-67
protein using Dako clone MIB1 monoclonal antibody and DAB detection.
The glass slides required for the study were scanned at each study site to score
by one pathologist.
The following two rounds of study were executed, and a minimum of one
week was allowed between the two reads for each pathologist.
Round 1 Manual Scoring: Slides were scored by a qualified pathologist at
each site using manual microscopy. Each pathologist read the same set of test
samples for p53 and Ki-67 on a manual microscope. Each pathologist then
assigned a score each test sample, according to the scoring categories.
Round 2 PATHIAM™-Assisted Scoring following digital scanning: The same
slides were randomized and presented to the pathologists’ laboratories in a
different order from Round 1 above.
The individual laboratories scanned the slides using iScan and three
pathologists from Round 1 reviewed the digital images presented by the
PATHIAM™ software on the computer monitor.
The pathologist had the ability to navigate freely around the images at various
magnifications, select fields of views for scoring. With the assistance of the
PATHIAM™ system, each pathologist then assigned a score to each test
sample, according to the scoring categories.
Agreement (concordance) percentages were calculated at two clinically
accepted standards for positivity, the >1% cutoff and the >5% cutoff. These
are shown below as point estimates and exact 95% confidence intervals. Each
of the point estimates are at or above the acceptance limit set for the study
(60% concordance).
