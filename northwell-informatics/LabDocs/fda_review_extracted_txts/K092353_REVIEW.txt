• Wash Solution Concentrate – Tris NaCl buffer, ProClin, Tween 20
• Negative Control – Human serum negative for anti-HAV IgM and total antibodies
• Positive Control – Human serum positive for anti-HAV IgM antibodies
• Calibrator – Human serum positive for anti-HAV IgM antibodies
• Sample Diluent – Tris buffer containing protein and sample indicator dye
• HAV Viral antigen – inactivated HAV virus in Tris buffer and ProClin

The EVOLIS Automated Microplate System is an automated microplate analyzer that
performs all functions necessary for processing microplate assays. Functions include:
barcode scanning, sample pre-dilutions, sample and reagent dispensing, plate incubations,
plate wash cycles, photometric measurement of completed assay plates and results
evaluation. The analyzer instrument is controlled via the EVOLIS software, a Windows 2000
application running on a separate dedicated PC. An operator loads the appropriate
microplates, assay reagents, and patient and control samples, then selects assay parameters,
loads sample information, initiates instrument processing, and generates results reports.

L. Test Principle:
Patient specimens, a calibrator, and controls are incubated with anti-human IgM antibodies
coated on the microwells. If IgM antibodies to HAV are present in a specimen or control, they
bind to the antibody. Excess sample is removed by a wash step. The HAV Viral Antigen and the
Conjugate (containing horseradish peroxidase - labeled mouse monoclonal antibody to HAV) are
successively added to the microwells and allowed to incubate. The presence of anti-HAV IgM in
the sample enables the HAV Viral Antigen and the Conjugate to bind to the solid phase. Excess
Conjugate and HAV Viral Antigen are removed by a wash step, and a TMB Chromogen
/Substrate solution is added to the microwells and allowed to incubate. If a sample contains
anti-HAV IgM, the bound enzyme (HRP) causes the colorless tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in
the Chromogen solution to change to blue. The blue color turns yellow after the addition of a
Stopping Solution. If a sample does not contain anti-HAV IgM, the Chromogen/Substrate
solution in the well remains colorless during the substrate incubation, and after the addition of
the Stopping Solution. The color intensity is measured spectrophotometrically. Absorbance value
readings for patient specimens are compared to the cutoff value.

A 21-member panel consisting of the following was tested: three (3) serum samples with
six (6) corresponding plasma samples (EDTA K2, EDTA K3, Sodium Citrate, Sodium
Heparin, Lithium Heparin, ACD) at three (3) different levels [1 low positive near the
cutoff (Panel Set 1), 1 negative near the cutoff (Panel Set 2) and 1 negative (Panel Set
3)]. Two replicates each of the twenty-four (24) member panel were assayed twice a day
for 20 days. The data were analyzed following the CLSI guidance EP5A2. The mean
ratio, the Standard Deviation (SD) and percent coefficient of variation (%CV) were
calculated for each panel member.

N. Instrument Name:
EVOLIS Automated Microplate System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The EVOLIS Automated Microplate System is an open tube, batch mode analyzer with a
continuous load option. The reagent bottles used from the test kit are placed on the
instrument with the caps removed. The sample tubes can be the primary tubes with
stoppers removed or the serum/plasma can be poured off into identified test tubes.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ____X___ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Specimen information may be entered either by EVOLIS system barcode reading directly
off the specimen tube or entered manually by the user.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The system can store and distribute samples from different types of vessels into dilution
vessels and microplates. The samples can be accessed in any order. Sample addition is
via a 300 μL disposable tip. The system can load and unload samples and assay reagents
while it is operating.

The pipetting system utilizes a liquid syringe pump and system fluid. The system uses
disposable tips (300 μL and 1100 μL), and can aspirate and dispense fluids from a variety
of different vessels. Key functions of the system are liquid level detection, using
capacitive sensing, verification of fluid distribution, and the detection of clots and
blocked tips. If the pipettor does not detect a sufficient volume an error is displayed. The
pipettor automatically flushes with system fluid between each aspirate/dispense cycle of
samples and reagent during a pipetting sequence. Mixing occurs during the transfer of
sample, addition of diluents, and other reagents.
Intermediate vessels are used to dilute samples when the level of dilution exceeds the
volume available in the final reaction vessel. Mixing is utilized to obtain a homogeneous
mixture after preparing the dilution. The instrument has space for at least one microplate
to be used as a dilution position.
5. Calibration:
The system performs a self-test each time EVOLIS software is launched. During the self-
test the instrument hardware is initialized and the status of all instrument modules is
verified. The self-test evaluates the following systems: Pipettor, washer, photometer,
plate transport, incubators, system communications, and other user-defined maintenance.
Users are instructed in the Operator’s Manual to perform the following Performance
Evaluation Procedures monthly: Plate Transport Check, Photometer Verification Check,
Fluidics Panel Check.
6. Quality Control:
Assay includes positive and negative controls that are run with each batch.
