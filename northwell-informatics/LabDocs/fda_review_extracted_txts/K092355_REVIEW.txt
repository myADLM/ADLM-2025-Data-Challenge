• Negative Control – Human serum negative for total anti-HAV antibodies
• Positive Control – Human serum positive for anti-HAV antibodies
• Calibrator – Human serum positive for anti-HAV antibodies
• HAV Viral antigen – inactivated HAV virus in Tris buffer and ProClin
• Conjugate – Peroxidase labeled mouse monoclonal antibody to HAV in Tris buffer
• Substrate buffer – H O , buffer, DMSO
2 2
• Chromogen - TMB
• Stopping solution – 1N H SO

The EVOLIS Automated Microplate System is an automated microplate analyzer that
performs all functions necessary for processing microplate assays. Functions include:
barcode scanning, sample pre-dilutions, sample and reagent dispensing, plate incubations,
plate wash cycles, photometric measurement of completed assay plates and results
evaluation. The analyzer instrument is controlled via the EVOLIS software, a Windows 2000
application running on a separate dedicated PC. An operator loads the appropriate
microplates, assay reagents, and patient and control samples, then selects assay parameters,
loads sample information, initiates instrument processing, and generates results reports.

L. Test Principle:
Patient specimens, a Calibrator and controls are incubated with HAV antigen in microwells
that have been coated with mouse monoclonal anti-hepatitis A antibodies. Antibodies to
HAV present in a specimen or control will complex with the HAV antigen reagent and with
antibodies coated on the microwells. Excess sample and HAV Viral Antigen reagent are
removed by a wash step. The Conjugate (containing horseradish peroxidase-labeled mouse
monoclonal antibody to HAV) is subsequently added to the microwells and incubated. The
Conjugate binds to the HAV antigen bound to the microwell, in the absence of antibodies to
HAV from the specimen. Excess Conjugate is removed by a wash step, and a TMB
Chromogen/Substrate solution is added to the microwells and allowed to incubate. If a
sample does not contain anti-HAV antibodies, the bound enzyme (HRP) causes the colorless
tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in the Chromogen solution to change to blue. The blue color
turns yellow after the addition of a Stopping Solution. If a sample contains anti-HAV
antibodies, the Chromogen/Substrate solution in the well remains colorless during the
substrate incubation, and after the addition of the Stopping Solution. The color intensity is
measured spectrophotometrically. Absorbance value readings for patient specimens are
compared to the Cutoff value determined by the mean of the Calibrator absorbance values.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A 21-member panel consisting of the following was tested: three (3) serum samples with
six (6) corresponding plasma samples (EDTA K2, EDTA K3, Sodium Citrate, Sodium
Heparin, Lithium Heparin, ACD) at three (3) different levels [1 low positive near the
cutoff (Panel Set 1), 1 negative near the cutoff (Panel Set 2) and 1 negative (Panel Set
3)]. The kit controls and calibrator were also tested for a total of 24 samples. Two
replicates each of the twenty-four (24) samples were assayed twice a day for 20 days. The
data were analyzed per CLSI guidance EP5A2. The mean ratio, the Standard Deviation
(SD) and percent coefficient of variation (%CV) were calculated for each panel member.

Six-hundred eighty-eight retrospective samples were tested on the MONOLISA Anti-
HAV assay, using a total of four (4) EVOLIS instruments at three sites. The same
samples were tested manually (reference method) on the MONOLISA Anti-HAV assay.
Specimens that were borderline with the reference assay and negative with EVOLIS were
considered as false negative for the EVOLIS; specimens that were borderline with the
reference assay and reactive with EVOLIS were considered as false positive for the
EVOLIS.

The positive percent agreement with the reference method, manual testing, is 98.8%

of 95.2 – 98.6%.
The EVOLIS was also evaluated by performing a combination of 2 assays on the same
plate frame. In this study 315 samples were tested with the MONOLISA Anti-HAV assay
on a combination plate on the EVOLIS (both the MONOLISA Anti-HAV EIA and
MONOLISA Anti-HAV IgM EIA assays were run in a single microplate frame). Results
were compared to the same samples tested manually (the reference method, individual
plate format) on the MONOLISA Anti-HAV assay. Specimens that were borderline with
the reference assay (manual individual plate) and negative with EVOLIS (combination
plate) were considered as false negative for the EVOLIS (combination plate).

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The system can store and distribute samples from different types of vessels into dilution
vessels and microplates. The samples can be accessed in any order. Sample addition is
via a 300 μL disposable tip. The system can load and unload samples and assay reagents
while it is operating.
The pipetting system utilizes a liquid syringe pump and system fluid. The system uses
disposable tips (300 μL and 1100 μL), and can aspirate and dispense fluids from a variety
of different vessels. Key functions of the system are liquid level detection, using
capacitive sensing, verification of fluid distribution, and the detection of clots and
blocked tips. If the pipettor does not detect a sufficient volume an error is displayed. The
pipettor automatically flushes with system fluid between each aspirate/dispense cycle of
samples and reagent during a pipetting sequence. Mixing occurs during the transfer of
sample, addition of diluents, and other reagents.
Intermediate vessels are used to dilute samples when the level of dilution exceeds the
volume available in the final reaction vessel. Mixing is utilized to obtain a homogeneous
mixture after preparing the dilution. The instrument has space for at least one microplate
to be used as a dilution position.
5. Calibration:
The system performs a self-test each time EVOLIS software is launched. During the self-
test the instrument hardware is initialized and the status of all instrument modules is
verified. The self-test evaluates the following systems: Pipettor, washer, photometer,
plate transport, incubators, system communications, and other user-defined maintenance.
Users are instructed in the Operator’s Manual to perform the following Performance
Evaluation Procedures monthly: Plate Transport Check, Photometer Verification Check,
Fluidics Panel Check.
6. Quality Control:
Assay includes positive and negative controls that are run with each batch.
