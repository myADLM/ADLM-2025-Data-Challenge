K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Not applicable
L. Test Principle:
Anti-MCV® IgG EIA is an indirect solid phase enzyme immunoassay. Mutated
citrullinated vimentin (MCV) is bound to microwells. Antibodies against this
antigen, if present in diluted serum or plasma, bind to the respective antigen.
Washing of the micro- wells removes unspecific serum and plasma components.
Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated anti-human IgG immunologically
detects the bound patient antibodies forming a conjugate/antibody/antigen
complex. Washing of the microwells removes unbound conjugate. An enzyme
substrate in the presence of bound conjugate hydrolyzes to form a blue color. The
addition of an acid stops the reaction forming a yellow end-product. The intensity
of this yellow color is measured photometrically at 450 nm. The amount of color
is directly proportional to the concentration of IgG antibodies present in the
original sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Statistics for Coefficients of Variation (CV) were calculated for each of seven
samples from the results of 16 determinations in a single run for Intra-Assay
precision. The set of same 7 specimens were used for the intra- and inter-
assay imprecision studies. Run-to-run precision was calculated from the
results obtained by one operator for 5 different runs performed on 5 different
days with single determinations of each sample. The acceptance criteria are
the imprecision should be less than 15%.

The specification for acceptance is CV = <15%. The specification was met.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Four patient samples containing high levels of antibody were serially diluted
6-9 times in buffer throughout the dynamic range of the assay to demonstrate
the upper end of linearity. Specifications are that linear regression coefficient
(R²) should be > 0.990 and recovery is 100%±20%. Results met the criteria
and were considered linear. The calculated values together with the recovery
and the linear regression coefficient (R²) are shown in the table below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
There is no reference standard for anti-MCV. The values for calibrators (A-F)
and controls (C1 and C2) are arbitrary units.
Reagent stability
Each kit lot produced by ORGENTEC is tested throughout its complete shelf
life. The data presented in the stability studies derives from the stability
testing of three random kit lots. The assay kit was stable for 18 months under
2-8ºC. The diluted sample buffer and wash buffer are stable for at least 30
days when stored at 2-8ºC.
Sample stability
Twelve samples with anti-MCV concentrations ranging from 17.6 to 959.7
U/mL were tested in duplicate to determine stability of storage at 2-8°C for 5
days. Results met acceptance criteria with % recovery ranged from 94% to
5

d. Detection limit:
i. Limit of Blank (loB)
Sample Buffer was diluted according to instructions for use and measured
32 times on one plate. Calibrators and Controls were analyzed in
duplicate. The detection limit was calculated as the mean of the optical
densities (OD) of the Sample Buffer plus 3 SD and expressed in U/mL.
Acceptance Criteria: The analytical sensitivity has to be < 1 U/mL. The
(mean + 3 SD) was 0.044 OD for the Sample Buffer, which corresponded
to an analytical sensitivity of 0.6 U/mL.
ii. Limit of Detection (LoD)
The limit of detection was calculated from LoB and LoQ using the
following formula LoD = μB + 1.645 δB + 1.645 δS. (Note: B = Blank; S
= Lowest Sample).
The LOD = 0.032OD Mean of Blank + 1.645x 0.007OD (0.012OD) =
0.044OD = 3.0 U/mL.
iii. Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
Limit of quantitation was determined from the coefficient of variation of
four very low serum samples run in replicates of 16 in three assay runs.
The lowest concentration which could be measured with a coefficient of
variation below 20% is 3.2 U/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
i. Interference
Interference due to bilirubin, hemoglobin and lipemia was evaluated
using a negative serum, a low positive serum and a high positive serum
spiked with the respective interfering substance in increasing
concentrations. Hemoglobin up to 1000 mg/dL, bilirubin up to 40
mg/dL, and lipemia (i.e. triglyceride concentration) up to 3000 mg/dL in
human serum do not interfere with Anti-MCV® ELISA results.
ii. Cross reactivity
A series of patient samples from other potentially cross-reacting and
similar symptoms to Rheumatoid Arthritis were evaluated for reactivity in
the Anti-MCV® assay. No positive results were found in these samples.
The results of the testing are summarized below.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Five hundred and fifty five (555) sera with concentrations ranged from Anti
MCV IgG 1.5 - 900 U/mL were tested by the ORGENTEC Anti-MCV®
ELISA in single measurement and by the Immunoscan Anti-CCP IgG ELISA.
The quantitative results were calculated from a calibration curve on the basis
of tested calibrators. In the ORGENTEC Anti-MCV® assay quantitative
values above or equal to 20 U/mL were considered positive, values below 20
U/mL were considered negative. In the Immunoscan Anti-CCP IgG assay
quantitative values above or equal 25 U/mL were considered positive, values
below 25 U/mL were considered negative.
A summary analysis of the results are shown in the following Tables:

a. Clinical Sensitivity and Clinical specificity
Studies were performed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the Anti-
MCV® (ELISA) test when compared to the predicate assay Anti-CCP IgG assay
(Immunoscan, Eurodiagnostica) using a mix of clinically diagnosed Rheumatoid
Arthritis disease state samples and a presumed normal asymptomatic blood bank
population and other arthritic and autoimmune patient samples obtained from
hospital labs and autoimmune clinics.
The sensitivity performance of the ORGENTEC Anti-MCV® assay was
established using four hundred and ninety (n=490) samples from clinically
diagnosed patients as having Rheumatoid Arthritis disease that were obtained
from a variety of clinical sources (hospitals and autoimmune clinics). The
patients collectively included 124 males and 366 females. The age ranged from 19
to 92 years. The specificity performance of the ORGENTEC Anti-MCV® assay
was established using 234 “presumed normal” sera obtained from blood donor
centers age 24 to 82 years, 522 other samples from patients with arthritic and
autoimmune disease conditions, obtained from a variety of clinical sources

(hospitals and autoimmune clinics) age 2 to 92 years. The samples collectively
included 166 males and 590 females.
Based on clinical diagnosis, three hundred ninety-eight of the 490 Rheumatoid
Arthritis disease diagnosed sera were positive in the ORGENTEC Anti-MCV®
assay and ninety-two tested as negative, thus yielding a clinical diagnostic
sensitivity of 81.2% (95% CI 77.8 – 84.7%). This data is consistent with reported
data of sensitivities ranging from 69 % to 82 % for commercial Anti-MCV IgG
assay for the diagnosis and follow up of RA Disease patients (Table in Egerer et
al., Deutsches Ärzteblatt International(cid:31)(cid:31) Dtsch Arztebl Int 2009; 106 (10):159–63).
The specificity of the ORGENTEC Anti-MCV® assay was 98% (95% CI 96.7 –
98.9%)

5. Expected values/Reference range:
A series of 209 assumed normal blood donor samples ages 18 to 69 years were
collected from various blood banks. These 209 samples were tested in the
ORGENTEC Anti-MCV® assay to determine a normal range and cut-off for the
assay.
The combined mean concentration of Anti-MCV® antibodies was 5.6 U/ml. The
mean+2SD was 12.8 U/mL, and.mean+3SD = 16.5 U/mL.
Based on these results the cut-off was determined to be > 20 U/ml.
At a cut-off of > 20 U/ml, 1 sample was positive for a specificity of 99.5%.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
