4. Panel:
83-Microbiology
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Remel Spectra™ MRSA is a selective and differential chromogenic medium
recommended for use in the qualitative detection of nasal colonization of
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to aid in the prevention and
control of MRSA in healthcare settings. The test is performed with anterior nares
swab specimens from patients and healthcare workers to screen for MRSA
colonization. Spectra™ MRSA is not intended to diagnose MRSA infection or to
guide or monitor treatment for infections.
Spectra™ MRSA is also intended for use in the qualitative detection of MRSA
from positive blood cultures demonstrating Gram-positive cocci on Gram stain.
Spectra™ MRSA is indicated for use in conjunction with other laboratory tests
and clinical data available to the clinician as an aid in the detection of MRSA
from patient positive blood cultures. Spectra™ MRSA is not intended to monitor
treatment for MRSA infections, or provide results of susceptibility to methicillin.
All positive blood bottles should be sub-cultured for further microbiological/
susceptibility testing.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable
I. Device Description:
Remel Spectra™ MRSA is an opaque medium, which uses a novel chromogen
that yields a denim-blue color as a result of phosphatase activity. This enzyme is
present in Staphylococcus aureus, including MRSA. To allow the medium to
differentiate MRSA accurately, it contains a combination of antibacterial
compounds designed to inhibit the growth of a wide variety of competitor
organisms. Also included are compounds that encourage the production of
MRSA pathogenicity marker, ensuring expression of the phosphatase enzyme and
so providing enhanced sensitivity and specificity.

L. Test Principle:
Remel Spectra™ MRSA is an opaque medium, which uses a novel chromogen that
yields a denim-blue color as a result of phosphatase activity. This enzyme is present
in all Staphylococcus aureus, including MRSA. To allow the medium to differentiate
MRSA accurately, it contains a combination of antibacterial compounds designed to
inhibit the growth of a wide variety of competitor organisms. Also included are
compounds that encourage the production of MRSA pathogenicity marker, ensuring
expression of the phosphatase enzyme and so providing enhanced sensitivity and
specificity.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated at six sites using a panel of 20 S. aureus
strains including thirteen MRSA, six MSSA, and one borderline oxacillin-
resistant S. aureus (BORSA) isolates. Each isolate was tested once on each of
three days at each site resulting in 360 data points. All were in agreement with
expected values at 24 hours. The BORSA strain included in this evaluation at
four sites is considered variable and produced a positive test result for 7/12
data points at 24 hours.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended quality control (QC) organisms, S. aureus ATCC 43300 as
positive control, and S. aureus ATCC 25923 as negative control were used.
The clinical trial was conducted at four independent trial sites from July 31,
2007 through February 16, 2009. Weekly QC testing was conducted each
week of testing clinical specimens utilizing CLSI interpretive criteria where
applicable. All QC results obtained were acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity
Although cross reactivity studies were conducted as part of the anterior nares
culture submission (k073027), additional studies were conducted to test for
cross-reactivity with organisms that may be isolated from blood cultures
because of the indication for use with blood culture bottles. In total, two
hundred ninety-seven isolates were tested as part of this submission and 280
were tested as part of the earlier k073027 submission) microorganisms
representing gram-negative rods, yeast, streptococci, enterococci,
staphylococci and related organisms were evaluated with Spectra™ MRSA at
105–106 colony-forming units per ml concentration. No cross-reactivity
(denim blue colonies) was observed following 24 hours incubation.
Supplemental cross reactivity studies were added as part of this submission.
This included oxacillin MIC values against 97 coagulase negative
staphylococci (27 isolates were resistant to oxacillin). No cross reactivity
(denim blue colonies) was seen with any of these organisms following 24
hours incubation.
Interfering Substances
Interfering substances studies were conducted as part of the anterior nares
culture submission (k073027). Nine commonly used medicinal substances,
human blood, mucous, and six types of transport media were evaluated for
potential interference of the chromogenic reaction on the Spectra™ MRSA
medium. No interference was observed except for human blood which grew
pinpoint denim blue colonies.
f. Analytical sensitivity
Recovery study
A study was conducted to evaluate the recovery of methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) on Remel Spectra™ MRSA subcultured from
positive blood cultures that also contain organisms that could potentially be
co-present in the positive blood culture. The following organisms were
evaluated: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRCoNS).
Blood culture bottles were spiked with blood and various concentrations of
MRSA, MSSA and MRCoNS. Post-spiking, each bottle was incubated at 35-
37°C for 6 hours.
This study was designed based on the limit of detection (LoD) of 104 CFU/mL
5

--- Page 6 ---
determined from pilot spiking studies in various blood culture bottle types.
The recovery of MRSA (at 104 CFU/mL) was challenged with MSSA and
MRCoNS at LoD and higher concentrations of 106 and 108 CFU/mL, in order
to determine the impact of interfering organism on the detection of the target.
As shown in Table 1, the results from this study indicated that Spectra™
MRSA is capable of detection of MRSA ATCC 43300 from various blood
culture bottles whether MRSA was alone or mixed with a heavy inoculum of
MSSA and/or MRCoNS after 6 hours of incubation. Although similar results
were seen with MRSA ATCC® 43300, a heteroresistant isolate, recovery of
this strain was generally low and especially on the VersaTrek REDOX 2
(anaerobic) blood culture bottle.
Overall results from this recovery study demonstrated the ability of Spectra
MRSA to support growth of MRSA within the confines of a six hour
incubation limit when the organism was either alone or mixed with competing
Staphylococci (MSSA or MRCoNS).

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The performance of Spectra™ MRSA was evaluated at four geographically
diverse regions of the United States. Results from the Spectra™ MRSA at 24
hours incubation were compared to results obtained from traditional
subculture on Tryptic Soy Agar with 5% Sheep Blood (Blood Agar) after 48
hours incubation. Suspect isolates of S. aureus were identified using a latex
agglutination test or a biochemical identification system. Susceptibility testing
was performed using an antibiotic gradient method for oxacillin and the Oxoid
PBP2’ test was used for the detection of the penicillin-binding protein 2a.
A total of six hundred twenty eight (628) positive blood cultures exhibiting
gram-positive cocci on initial microscopic examination were tested. Upon
evaluation of the data submitted, a total of 81 Spectra™ MRSA results
obtained from subculture of the following blood culture bottles were excluded
from the primary analysis for the reasons stated:
1. BACTEC Lytic/10 Anaerobic/F and Standard/10 Aerobic/F because of the
inability to separate the data for each bottle type
2. BACTEC Ped Plus because none were positive for MRSA
Because of these exclusions, the total blood cultures considered for evaluation
of the performance of Spectra™ MRSA at 24 hours was reduced from 628 to
547 (158 MRSA and 389 non-MRSA).
The overall recovery of MRSA on Spectra™ MRSA at 24 hours was 96.2%
(152/158) compared to recovery of 100% (158/158) on Blood Agar at 48
hours. The positive and negative predictive values for Spectra™ MRSA
compared to the Oxoid PBP2’ test were 97.4% and 99.0% respectively as
shown in Table 2. Overall Performance vs. Traditional Culture and/or
Oxacillin MIC is shown in Table 3 and Overall Performance vs. PBP2 is
shown in Table 4. Detailed performance is provided in Tables 5 and 6.
