This 510(k) is for addition of Minocycline in the dilution range of 0.03-32μg/mL
for testing gram negative and gram positive isolates on the Sensititre® 18-24 hour
Susceptibility system. The approved primary “Indications for Use” and clinical

Aerobic and facultative Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms:
E.coli
Klebsiella spp.
Enterobacter aerogenes
Acinetobacter spp.
Staphylococcus aureus
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of
staphylococcal infection.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Use Sensititre AutoInoculator for inoculation
I. Device Description:
The Sensititre Susceptibility System is a micro-version of the classic broth dilutions
method and can provide both qualitative and quantitative susceptibility results in a
dried microtitre plate format. Each micro-broth dilution plate is dosed with
antimicrobial agents at specific dilutions and then dried.

--- Page 3 ---
The organism to be tested must be in pure culture and identified as Gram negative or
Gram positive. Colonies are then suspended in broth and brought to a turbidity of 0.5
McFarland, with the recommendation to use the Sensititre nephelometer. The
organism suspension is diluted using Mueller-Hinton broth to a final inoculum
concentration of 1 X 105 CFU/mL. A volume of 50μl of broth suspension is
transferred to each well of the microtitre plate by the Sensititre AutoInoculator. After
inoculation, plates are sealed with an adhesive seal, incubated at 34-36ºC for 18 to 24
hours and examined for bacterial growth. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing results
may be read automatically using the Sensititre® AutoReader® or manually using the
Sensititre® manual viewer or SensiTouch®.

L. Test Principle:
The Sensititre® AutoRead® System utilizes fluorescence technology to read the
micro broth dilution plates after 18 to 24 hour incubation. The technology involves
the detection of bacterial growth by monitoring the activity of specific surface
enzymes produced by the test organism. Growth is determined by generating a
fluorescent product from a non-fluorescent (fluorogenic) substrate. The non-
fluorescent substrate is prepared by conjugating a fluorescent compound to the
specific enzyme substrates with a bond which prevents fluorescence. The enzymatic
action of the bacterial surface enzymes on the bound non-fluorescent substrate
cleaves the bond releasing the fluorescence. The amount of fluorescence detected is
directly related to the activity of bacterial growth. The MIC is determined by
observing the lowest dilution of antimicrobial agent that inhibits growth of the
organism. The non-fluorescent (fluorogenic) substrate can be added to the inoculum
broth which is dispensed into the test plate at the same time as the test organism, or,
the plates can be prepared with the substrate already added to each micro-well.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing was performed using 25 Gram negative and 25 Gram
positive isolates. The isolates were tested one time at each of three sites for
each reading method (Manual, AutoRead®). The testing resulted in overall
reproducibility results of greater than 95% for both the Manual and
AutoRead® methods.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Isolates recommended by both the FDA(CDER) and the CLSI, namely
S.aureus ATCC 29213, E.faecalis ATCC 29212, and E.coli ATCC 25922
were tested against Minocycline. Quality control was performed at all sites
using both Manual and AutoRead® methods. All results were in acceptable
range which demonstrates that the Sensititre Susceptibility System can
consistently produce quality control results in the recommended range for
Minocycline, for both the Manual and AutoRead® methods.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The CLSI micro-broth dilution panel was prepared according to the CLSI
recommendation and used as the reference method.
Clinical testing was performed at three sites using 255 Gram negative and 179
Gram positives totaling 434 isolates tested. Of the 434 isolates, 356 were
fresh clinical isolates and 78 were stock challenge strains.
The growth rate for both the Manual and AutoRead® methods was greater
than 90%.
Tables A-D demonstrate performance based on essential agreement and
category agreement of both clinical and challenge isolates. The data is
stratified by isolate Gram reaction and method of plate read (Manual or
AutoRead®).

EA = Essential Agreement CA = Category Agreement
R = Resistant Isolates min = minor discrepancies
maj = major discrepancies vmj = very major discrepancies
Evaluable results are those that fall within the test range of the reference
method and could also be on-scale with the new device if within plus/minus
one dilution. Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement
between the result of the reference method and that of Sensititre® panel
within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the antibiotic. Category
Agreement (CA) occurs when the interpretation of the result of the reference
method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the Sensititre® panel result.
In each instance, both the percent Category Agreement (CA) and percent
Essential Agreement (EA) consistently fall above 90%, and are therefore
acceptable as described in the “Class II Special Controls guidance Document:
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and
FDA, August 2009”. A comparative evaluation of performance data of the
Manual and AutoRead methods revealed very little difference. No very
major or major discrepancies occurred. A total of nine minor discrepancies
occurred and all fell within Essential Agreement of the reference method
result.
