and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) nucleic acids purified from nasopharyngeal swab
specimens obtained from patients symptomatic for viral upper respiratory infection. The test
is intended to be used on the Verigene® System as an aid in the differential diagnosis of
Influenza A, Influenza B, and RSV infections. The test is not intended to detect influenza C
virus.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus or RSV infection and should not be used

as the sole basis for treatment or other management decisions. It is recommended that
negative test results be confirmed by culture.
Performance characteristics for Influenza A Virus were established when Influenza A/H3
and A/H1 were the predominant Influenza A viruses in circulation. When other Influenza
A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.
If infections with a novel Influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent
Influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture
should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and
culture specimens.
2. Indication(s) for use: Same as Intended Use
3) Special conditions for use statement(s): For Prescription use only
4) Special instrument requirements: Verigene® System consisting of the Verigene
Processor (software version 2.0) and the Verigene Reader (software version 1.5.6).
I. Device Description:
The Verigene SP consists of two core instruments, the Verigene Reader and the Verigene
SP that offers ‘sample-to-result’ testing capability. The Verigene SP System utilizes
single-use disposable test units. Up to 32 SP units may be connected to a single Verigene
Reader. Each SP unit can be independently accessed through the Reader to run different
tests. The Verigene Reader in the Verigene SP is the same as in the cleared system
(K083088).
The SP unit is a reconfiguration of the Processor within the cleared Verigene System to
allow on-board Sample Extraction and Target Amplification – steps that were previously
performed externally. Added in the SP’s package are an Extraction Module to extract
nucleic acids from clinical samples and an Amplification Module to amplify the extracted
nucleic acids. The amplified target is then detected in the Verigene Test as in the cleared
Verigene System. All fluid transfers and mixing operations in the SP are performed by an
automated pipettor.
Assay technology is same as described below in K083088: Magnetic bead-based isolation
technology for sample preparation, multiplex RT-PCR for target amplification, gold
nanoparticle probe technology for the Verigene test. The VRNAT also includes control
materials as described in K083088.
The Verigene® Respiratory Virus Nucleic Acid Test (VRNAT) is a set of reagents and
supplies designed to be utilized in RT-PCR and hybridization assay using the Verigene®
instrument SP system for detection and identification of human influenza A, influenza B,
and RSV viral RNA. The VRNAT primers target matrix (M) gene of influenza A, non
2

structural (NS) and M genes of influenza B, and L gene and F gene of RSV. The
amplicons are hybridized to gold nanoparticle probes through a mediator oligonucleotide
and target-specific capture oligonucleotides on a microarray-based chip in a disposable
test cartridge. The signal enhanced with elemental silver at the test site is detected using
the Verigene Processor.

Limit of Detection (Analytical Sensitivity)
The analytical sensitivity of the RVNAT was compared to the cleared VRNAT
SP
(K083088) by determining the Limit of Detection (LoD) of Influenza A, Influenza B,
RSV A, and RSV B viruses. Strains with established titers were used for each virus.
Each virus stock was serially diluted into a sample matrix (Universal Transport Media,
Copan), and each concentration was tested in quadruplicate using the RVNAT . The
SP
LoD was confirmed by performing an additional 20 replicates for each strain in order to
demonstrate that the virus was detected ≥95% of the time. The LoD for each virus was
identical to the LoD observed with the same strains on the cleared VRNAT (K083088)

Carry-over contamination studies: High positive samples of Influenza A, Influenza B,
RSV A, and RSV B were alternated with high negative samples for all four viruses.
Based on the collective data, there was no evidence of cross-contamination from any of
the test steps including sample preparation, multiplex RT-PCR step, and the Verigene
Hybridization Test.
A. Precision/Reproducibility Studies Comparison between the RVNAT and the cleared
SP
VRNAT (K083088)
The Precision/Reproducibility Studies were performed at each of three sites. At Site
1, the reproducibility study was part of a larger precision study.
Precision/Reproducibility Studies for the RVNAT were conducted exactly as for the
SP
previously cleared VRNAT (K083088) to allow equivalency comparisons. As before,
eight unique samples were created by diluting known concentrations of viral particles
with Viral Transport Medium. Since the Analytical Sensitivity of the RVNAT was
SP
identical to the cleared VRNAT, the same strains and levels were used in the studies.
Each strain was represented at 3 distinct concentrations: high negative, low positive,
and moderate positive.
Sample panel for the Precision/Reproducibility Studies.

Viral Strains and Levels
Samples
1 Influenza A - High Negative; Influenza B - High Negative
2 RSV A - High Negative; RSV B – High Negative
3 Influenza A - Low Positive
4 Influenza B - Low Positive
5 RSV A - Low Positive
6 RSV B - Low Positive
7 Influenza A - Moderate Positive; RSV A - Moderate Positive
8 Influenza B - Moderate Positive; RSV B - Moderate Positive
The Precision Study (Site 1) tested the sample set over 12 non-consecutive days. On
each test day, two operators performed the RVNAT in duplicate for each sample
SP
(i.e., 4 sample sets per day total). In the reproducibility study performed by sites 2
and 3, the sample set was tested in triplicate daily by 2 operators on each of five non-
consecutive days.
Performance characteristics of the RVNAT in the Precision/Reproducibility Studies
SP
were equivalent to those for the cleared VRNAT as shown in the following table.

SP
A sample set representing Influenza A, Influenza B, and RSV was prepared by diluting
culture positive nasopharyngeal swab samples with negative samples. Dilutions were
aimed to yield viral load levels close to the low positive levels for each virus type. A total
of 62 unique samples were diluted, aliquoted, and frozen. The sample set was tested at the
internal site (Site 1) using the cleared VRNAT,and at all three sites using the RVNAT .
SP
This sample testing yielded a total of 62 x 4=248 unique tests.
Each sample set yielded a total of 186 decisions from 62 unique samples as each test
provides a decision of ‘Detected’ or ‘Not Detected’ for each of the 3 viruses, Influenza A,
Influenza B, and RSV. Of the 62 samples, 3 samples had dual infections where 2 viruses
were present.
