L. Test Principle:
“Calibration verification is the assaying of calibration materials in the same manner
as patient samples to confirm that the calibration of the instrument or test system has
remained stable throughout the laboratory’s reportable range for patient test results.”
(42 Code of U.S. Federal Regulations. Part 493.1217. Standard; Calibration and
calibration verification procedures.) (sic.)
Calibration verification is not a requirement of the Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay
systems based on the manufacturer’s recommendations. However, CalCheck
solutions can be used in instances where such a test procedure is required by
certification agencies, or where the user wishes to document calibration verification.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay range:
Verification of Assay Range: To demonstrate that after dilution of Rubella
IgG CalCheck 1 and 5 values are within the assay’s measuring range of 0.21 -
500 IU/mL, the following dilution study was performed:

CalCheck 1 & CalCheck 2, CalCheck 4 & CalCheck 5, and CalCheck 5 &
CalCheck 3 were mixed in a 1:1 ratio and measured in two-fold
determination. Then the average was calculated.
Result: Both CalCheck 1 & CalCheck 2 and CalCheck 3 & CalCheck 5
dilution values are within the assay’s measuring range after dilution.
CalCheck 4 & CalCheck 5 dilution values were outside of the assay’s
measuring range, however, CalCheck 3 & CalCheck 5 dilution was within the
assay’s measuring range.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Elecsys Rubella IgG CalCheck 5 is standardized against the NIBSC 1st
International Standard for Anti-Rubella Immunoglobulin, Human. The NIBSC
standard is reconstituted and a serial dilution set is created from it. A master
curve is derived using the NIBSC dilution set. The master calibrators are assigned
values using the master curve. From the master calibrators a master curve is
derived. In turn the CalChecks are assigned values using the master curve based
on the master calibrators. Values are assigned using a minimum of,
• 4 Elecsys2010/cobas e 411 analyzers,
• 4 MODULAR ANALYTICS E170/ cobas e 601 analyzers.
Six independent series of analyses are performed on each instrument. Each
sample is tested in duplicate. The target value is then calculated as the median of
the determined values. Approximate target values are given in the table below.
Lot-specific target values may differ slightly after value assignment.

Stability:
Two studies were performed in order to verify the stability claims for the Elecsys
Rubella IgG CalCheck. The data was generated using Rubella IgG master
calibrators, which have the same composition and target values as Rubella IgG
CalCheck 5. The acceptance criterion was recovery of 90-110 % of the reference
value, which was accomplished. The reconstituted Elecsys Rubella IgG CalCheck
5 is stable up to 4 hours at 20-25°C.
Expected Range:
The approximate target ranges were included in the Package Insert as given
below in the table. It was recommended to refer to the value sheet on www.
