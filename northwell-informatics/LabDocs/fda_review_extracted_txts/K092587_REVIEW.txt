L. Test Principle:
The BioPlex™ 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM kit uses multiplex flow immunoassay, a
methodology that greatly resembles traditional EIA, but permits simultaneous detection
and identification of many antibodies in a single tube.
The kit employs a panel of two different populations of dyed beads coated with cell
lysates bearing Rubella or CMV antigens to identify the presence of IgM antibodies to
Rubella, and CMV antigens as follows.
The BioPlex 2200 System combines an aliquot of patient sample, sample diluent, and
bead reagent into a reaction vessel; the mixture is incubated at 37°C. After a wash cycle,
anti-human IgM antibody, conjugated to phycoerythrin (PE), is added to the dyed beads,
and this mixture is incubated at 37°C. The excess conjugate is removed in another wash
cycle, and the beads are re-suspended in wash buffer. The bead mixture then passes
through the detector. The identity of the dyed beads is determined by the fluorescence of
the dyes, and the amount of antibody captured by the antigen is determined by the

fluorescence of the attached PE. Raw data are reported as relative fluorescence intensity
(RFI). Additionally, the ISB beads, SVB beads and a RBB beads are present in each
reaction mixture to verify detector response, the addition of serum or plasma to the
reaction vessel and the absence of significant non-specific binding in serum or plasma.
The BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM Calibrator Set calibrates the instrument using a
set of three distinct serum based calibrators. Calibrators are used in a test system to
establish points of reference that are used in the determination of qualitative numeric
measurement of IgM antibodies to Rubella, and CMV in human serum and EDTA or
heparinized plasma. The Calibrator Set should be loaded and assayed at minimum in
duplicate every 30 days or with each new Re-agent Pack lot.
The BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM Control Set includes a negative control as well
as a CMV IgM positive control and a Rubella IgM positive control. The BioPlex Rubella
and CMV IgM Positive Controls are manufactured to give positive results, with values
above the cut-off for each specific analyte. The BioPlex Rubella and CMV IgM Negative
Control are manufactured to give negative results, with values below the cut-off for each
specific analyte. The recommended frequency for performing quality control is once
every 24-hour testing period. Performing quality control is also necessary after each new
assay calibration and certain service procedures. A BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM
Control Lot Data disk is available to load the necessary value assignment data into the
instrument. The result for each of the tested antibodies is expressed as an antibody index
(AI). For Rubella and CMV, results of ≤ 0.8 AI are negative, 0.9 and 1.0 AI are equivocal
and results of ≥ 1.1 AI are reported as positive.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Separate internal and external reproducibility studies were conducted to
evaluate the reproducibility of the BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM kit on
the BioPlex 2200 instrument.
The internal precision study was conducted in-house by Bio-Rad Laboratories
in accordance with CLSI EP5-A2, Evaluation of Precision Performance of
Quantitative Measurement Methods.
For the internal reproducibility study, three (3) panels made from serum and
plasma (EDTA and heparinized) were assayed two (2) times in two (2)
separate daily runs over 20 days (n=80).
The data were analyzed for within-run, between-run, between-day, and total
precision and the standard deviation (SD) and percent coefficient of variation
(% CV) were calculated.
7

--- Page 8 ---
The within-run precision for rubella IgM samples ranged from 4.3% to 5.5%
in a serum matrix, 6.3% to 6.9% for EDTA and 4.8% to 9.5% for heparin
plasma matrices. The within-run precision for CMV IgM samples ranged from
5.3% to 9.2% in a serum matrix, 4.9% to 11.8% for EDTA and 5.2% to 12.8%
for heparin plasma matrices.
The external reproducibility study was conducted in accordance with CLSI
EP15-A2 during the external clinical evaluation at each of three clinical study
sites. Three lots of reagent packs, three lots of the BioPlex 2200 Rubella and
CMV IgM Calibrator Set and three lots of BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV
IgM Control Set were evaluated. The sample panels made from serum and
plasma (EDTA and heparinized) at varying levels of analytes, were tested in
quadruplicate over five (5) days (4 replicates x 1 run x 5 days x 3 testing sites
= 60 replicates per panel member).
The data were analyzed for within-run, between-run, between-day, between-
site, and total precision and the standard deviation (SD) and percent
coefficient of variation (% CV) were calculated.
The within run precision for positive samples greater than or equal to the cut-
off (≥ 1.1 AI) in all sample matrices ranged from 2.7% to 13.3% for Rubella
IgM and 2.8% to 13.5% for CMV IgM. The total precision for positive
samples greater than or equal to the cut-off (≥1.1 AI) ranged from 2.3% to
13.5% for Rubella IgM and 3.0% to 14.2% for CMV IgM.
The mean Antibody Index (AI), standard deviation (SD), and percent
coefficient of variation (%CV) for each panel member were calculated. The

achieve values of 1.7 to 2.3 AI for Rubella and 1.7 to 2.3 AI for CMV.
Interferent or solvent (negative control) was added exogenously at levels
indicated in Table H below. Test and control samples were evaluated in
replicates of ten. Changes in results ranged from -13.6 to 10.0%. No
significant interference was observed in any of the substances tested.

f. Assay cut-off:
The BioPlex 2200 Rubella and CMV IgM assays report results as an antibody
index, (AI). AI values are calculated by using linear regression analysis of a
two point assay calibration curve. The cut-off value and assignment of the
calibrators are determined by performing concordance and Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) analysis, using predicate results as the standard.
Analyze-it software is used for the ROC analysis. This software does not
employ an equivocal range for the on-test condition. Therefore, predicate
equivocal results are not included in the calculations for establishing cut-off.
After establishment of the cut-off, an equivocal range is set bracketing the cut-
off value. Based on the results, calibrator values were adjusted such that the
cut-off values equal to 1.1 AI for Rubella and CMV IgM assays.
A total of 586 and 593 patient samples were evaluated to confirm rubella and
CMV IgM cut-off values, respectively. ROC Analysis was performed for each
analyte using this population of samples.
Results obtained using a cut-off of 1.0 AI in the BioPlex Rubella and CMV IgM
assay ROC analyses demonstrated >98% negative agreement and >98% positive

Comparative Testing: Prospective
Performance of the Rubella and CMV IgM kit was evaluated against
corresponding commercially available Rubella and CMV IgM immunoassays.
Three clinical sites tested 700 prospective samples submitted for : Rubella
IgM (300 - U.S.), and CMV IgM testing (400; 300 U.S. + 100 Europe). Of the
300 samples submitted for Rubella IgM testing, 71 females were pregnant
women. Results are shown in the Table below.
Equivocal results obtained on the predicate devices were re-tested on two
other commercially available EIA and the consensus result of 2 out of the 3
tests was used in the analysis.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The observed prevalence for the Rubella and CMV IgM using the BioPlex 2200 Rubella and
CMV IgM assay was determined using samples submitted for Rubella (300, US) or CMV
IgM (400; 300 US +100 Europe) testing. The results are presented in the tables below. The
predictive values of the test are dependent on the prevalence. As rubella incidence
decreases, the predicative positive value of rubella IgM results decreases.
Note: Each laboratory should establish frequency distributions for their specific patient
populations.
