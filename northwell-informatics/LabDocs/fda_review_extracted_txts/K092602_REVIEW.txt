(cid:131) FDA Guideline, Review criteria for assessment of portable blood glucose monitoring in
vitro diagnostic devices using glucose oxidase, dehydrogenase or hexokinase
methodology.
L. Test Principle:
The FreeStyle Lite and FreeStyle Freedom Lite glucose meters, in conjunction with the
Freestyle Lite test strips, utilize coulometric biosensor technology to quantitatively measure
the glucose concentration in whole blood samples and in control solutions. The glucose
biosensors recognize the glucose present in whole blood or control solutions by virtue if the
specificity of the enzyme FAD dependent glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) present on the test
strip. The electrons liberated by this reaction are transferred via a co-factor and mediator to
the meter where they are read as a small electrical current. The magnitude of the charge
measured over reaction time is directly proportional to the level of glucose in the applied
sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed precision studies in accordance with the ISO 15197 guideline.
Adjusted venous whole blood samples at 5 glucose levels (hematocrit range 35 to
50%) were used for within-day precision studies. Each concentration was tested 10
times each on 10 meters, using 3 test strip lots, for a total of 300 tests per blood
glucose level. The reference value was determined by the YSI 2300 glucose
analyzer. Results are summarized below:
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3

3 202.6 3.4 1.7 283.8 6.8 2.4
The sponsor also evaluated the day-to-day precision of the device using replicate
measurements of glucose control solutions (low, normal, and high). Three different
concentrations, using the same lot of control solutions, were tested on 10 meters, each
tested in duplicate over 20 days with 3 strip lots. Results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor performed linearity studies using adjusted whole blood samples with 9
different glucose concentration ranges from 20 to 500 mg/dL. Duplicate
measurements were made with each concentration on 6 meters and the results
compared to those obtained using YSI 2300. Linear regression analysis resulted in: y
= 0.97x + 10.7; r2 = 0.996.
The claimed reportable range of the device is 20 to 500 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The method comparison was performed using the proposed device and YSI 2300
glucose analyzer.
Test strip stability was assessed in real-time and accelerated studies. The testing
supported the claimed shelf life of 12 months when stored at 4-30°C with relative
humidity of 5-90%.
The FreeStyle Control Solutions, Levels 1, 2, and 3 were previously cleared in
k070850.
c. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the device is 20-500 mg/dL. This range was validated via the
linearity study (see section M.1.b.).
d. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed interference studies with spiked venous blood samples at two
glucose concentrations (100 and 300 mg/dL) that were prepared and divided into a
test (dosed) pool and a control pool. The interferents were added to the sample and
each sample was analyzed in duplicate using 3 test strip lots on six meters. The bias
between control and dosed samples were calculated for each substance as well as the
bias of the dosed sample from the control for each substance tested. With the
exception of xylose, all biases (control to dosed sample and dosed sample to YSI)
were within + 10%. For xylose, a dose response study was conducted on 5 xylose
levels (0-25 mg/dL) at two glucose concentrations (100 and 300 mg/dL). It was
determined that the highest level of xylose at which no significant interference occurs
is 6 mg/dL. A warning statement is included in the test strip insert that this device
should not be used during xylose absorption testing. The table below lists all
substances tested at concentrations with insignificant (<10%) interference:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor conducted a combined accuracy and consumer study. Testing was
conducted at 3 sites, with trained operators and a total of 179 lay-users. Each lay user
participant performed their own fingerstick and tested their blood on the FreeStyle
Lite meter using only the instructions in the user’s manual and test strip insert. A
trained operator then performed a second fingerstick and tested the blood on the same
meter. Blood was also collected and measured on an YSI analyzer. The total range of
samples tested was 33-492 mg/dL, with a hematocrit range of 27-58%. A total of 36
samples <50 mg/dL and >395 mg/dL were glycolyzed or spiked, respectively and
tested by trained operators only. Linear regression results are presented below:

The sponsor conducted alternative site studies on the palm and upper arm at 2
clinical sites with a total of 151 lay users. Each participant obtained samples from
either their palm or upper arm and tested these samples on the FreeStyle Lite meter
using only the instructions in the user’s manual and test strip insert. A trained
operator then obtained palm and upper arm samples from each participant and tested
these samples on the same meter. Venous blood was also collected and measured on
an YSI analyzer. Linear regression results are presented below:
palm trained operator y = 1.03 + 4.6, r2 = 0.994, x = 74
lay user y = 1.03 + 4.5, r2 = 0.990, x = 74

lay user y = 1.00 + 6.4, r2 = 0.974, x = 77
Both the palm and upper arm alternative site results met the ISO 15197 accuracy
criteria where ninety-five percent (95%) of the individual glucose results fell within
±15mg/dL of the YSI results at glucose concentrations <75mg/dL and within ±20% at

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Hematocrit Study:
A study to evaluate the effect of hematocrit was conducted on samples with 5 glucose
concentrations (36-44, 81-99, 162-198, 253-297, 324-396, and 400-500 mg/dL) at 7
hematocrit levels (15, 20, 25, 40, 55, 60, and 65%). Each glucose level/hematocrit
combination was tested in duplicate on 6 meters using 3 lots of test strips. Results of
samples at each hematocrit level were compared to samples with the same glucose
concentration at normal (40%) hematocrit as well as to the corresponding YSI value.
All results met the acceptance criteria of + 15% which supports the claimed
hematocrit range of 15-65%.
Altitude study:
An altitude study was performed at elevations up to 10,000 feet with 60 tests each of 3
different concentrations of glucose spiked whole blood spanning 36 to 440 mg/dL.
Sea level results were compared to results at higher elevations and to YSI values, with
all results meeting the sponsor’s acceptance criteria of +10%
