L. Test Principle:
The FreeStyle 3, 5, Freedom, and Flash glucose meters, in conjunction with the Freestyle test
strips, utilize coulometric biosensor technology to quantitatively measure the glucose
concentration in whole blood samples and in control solutions. The glucose biosensors
recognize the glucose present in whole blood or control solutions by virtue if the specificity
of the enzyme FAD dependent glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) present on the test strip. The
electrons liberated by this reaction are transferred via a co-factor and mediator to the meter
where they are read as a small electrical current. The magnitude of the charge measured over
reaction time is directly proportional to the level of glucose in the applied sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed precision studies in accordance with the ISO 15197 guideline.
Venous whole blood was adjusted to 5 glucose levels (hematocrit range 43 to 46%)
were used for within-day precision studies. Each concentration was tested 10 times
each on 10 meters, using 3 test strip lots, for a total of 300 tests per blood glucose
level. The reference value was determined by the YSI 2300 glucose analyzer.

Freedom, and FreeStyle Flash. Duplicate measurements were made with each
concentration on 6 meters and 3 lots of test strips and the results compared to those
obtained using YSI 2300. Resulting linear regression analyses were as follows:
FreeStyle 3 Lot 1 y = 0.91x + 3.4, r2 = 0.998
Lot 2 y = 0.90x + 1.6, r2 = 0.998
Lot 3 y = 0.93x + 3.5, r2 = 0.998
FreeStyle 5 Lot 1 y = 0.93x + 0.6, r2 = 0.995
Lot 2 y = 0.95x - 2.0, r2 = 0.994
Lot 3 y = 0.97x + 1.1, r2 = 0.995
FreeStyle Freedom Lot 1 y = 0.91x + 7.4, r2 = 0.994
Lot 2 y = 0.93x + 7.4, r2 = 0.993
Lot 3 y = 0.93x + 12.2, r2 = 0.994
FreeStyle Flash Lot 1 y = 0.93x + 1.4, r2 = 0.995
Lot 2 y = 0.92x + 4.5, r2 = 0.995
Lot 3 y = 0.90x + 0.8, r2 = 0.994
The claimed reportable range of the device is 20 to 500 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The method comparison was performed using the proposed device and YSI 2300
glucose analyzer.
Test strip stability was assessed in real-time and accelerated studies. The testing
supported the claimed shelf life of 12 months when stored at 4-30°C with relative
humidity of 5-90%.
The FreeStyle Control Solutions, Levels 1, 2, and 3 were previously cleared in
k070850. Ranges for each control level are on the test strip vial labels.
c. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the device is 20-500 mg/dL. This range was validated via the
linearity study (see section M.1.b.).
d. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed interference studies with spiked venous blood samples at two
glucose concentrations (100 and 300 mg/dL) that were prepared and divided into a
test (dosed) pool and a control pool. The interferents were added to the sample and
each sample was analyzed in duplicate using 3 test strip lots on six of each type of
meter (FreeStyle 3, FreeStyle 5, FreeSyle Freedom, and FreeStyle Flash). The bias
between control and dosed samples were calculated for each substance as well as the
bias of the dosed sample from the control for each substance tested. With the
exception of xylose, all biases (control to dosed sample and dosed sample to YSI)
were within + 10%. For xylose, a dose response study was conducted on 5 xylose
levels (0-25 mg/dL) at two glucose concentrations (100 and 300 mg/dL). It was
determined that the highest level of xylose at which no significant interference occurs
is 6 mg/dL. A warning statement is included in the test strip insert that this device

FreeStyle 3
The sponsor conducted a combined accuracy and consumer study. Testing was
conducted at 3 sites, with trained operators and a total of 178 lay-users. Each lay user
participant performed their own fingerstick and tested their blood on the FreeStyle 3
meter using only the instructions in the user’s manual and test strip insert. A trained
operator then performed a second fingerstick and tested the blood on the same meter.
Blood was also collected and measured on an YSI analyzer. The total range of
samples tested was 32-492 mg/dL, with a hematocrit range of 29-59%. A total of 36
samples <50 mg/dL and >398 mg/dL were glycolyzed or spiked, respectively and
tested by trained operators only. Linear regression results are presented below:

N. Instrument Name:
FreeStyle 3 Blood Glucose Meter
FreeStyle 5 Blood Glucose Meter
FreeStyle Freedom Blood Glucose Meter
FreeStyel Flash Blood Glucose Meter
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings.
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,
or mobile device?:
Yes or No X .
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?:
Yes or No X .
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X___ or No ________
The applicant has provided documentation that indicates the device was designed and
developed under good software life-cycle processes.
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood, which can be applied
directly to the test strip.
5. Calibration:
The FreeStyle 3, 5, Freedom and Flash Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems require
coding by the user by matching the number on the meter display to that printed on the test
strip vial.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor provides a normal control solution with the device and instructions when to
test. Two other levels (low and high) are available for purchase from the sponsor). An

acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is
referred to the troubleshooting section of the owner’s manual if control results fall
outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Hematocrit Study:
A study to evaluate the effect of hematocrit was conducted on samples with 6 glucose
concentrations (36-44, 81-99, 162-198, 253-297, 324-396, and 400-500 mg/dL) at 7
hematocrit levels (15, 20, 25, 40, 55, 60, and 65%). Each glucose level/hematocrit
combination was tested in duplicate on 6 of each type of meter (FreeStyle 3, FreeStyle 5,
FreeStyle Freedom, and FreeStyle Flash) using 3 lots of test strips. Results of samples at
each hematocrit level were compared to samples with the same glucose concentration at
normal (40%) hematocrit as well as to the corresponding YSI value. All results for each
meter type met the acceptance criteria of + 15% which supports the claimed hematocrit
range of 15-65%.
Altitude study:
An altitude study was performed at elevations up to 10,000 feet with 60 tests each of 3
different concentrations of glucose spiked whole blood spanning 36 to 440 mg/dL. Sea
level results were compared to results at higher elevations and to YSI values, with all
results on each type of meter meeting the sponsor’s acceptance criteria of +10%
Temperature and humidity studies:
Temperature and humidity studies were conducted on each type of meter that
demonstrated that the devices can be used at temperatures of 4 to 40°C and at a relative
humidity of 5 to 90%, and stored at temperatures of 4 to 30°C with a relative humidity of
5 to 90%.
The sponsor provided a readability study and obtained Flesch-Kincaid grade level scores
of 8 or lower for the User’s Manual and test strip insert.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
