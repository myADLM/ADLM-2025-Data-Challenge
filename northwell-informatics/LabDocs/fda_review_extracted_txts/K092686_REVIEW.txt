H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indication(s) for use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
The ABL90 FLEX is a portable, automated analyzer that measures pH, blood
gases, electrolytes, glucose, lactate and oximetry in heparinized whole blood. The
ABL90 FLEX is intended for use by trained technologists, nurses, physicians and
therapists. It is intended for use in a laboratory environment, near patient or point-
of-care setting.
These tests are only performed under a physician's order:
pH, pO2 and pCO2 : pH, pCO2 and pO2 measurements are used in the diagnosis
and treatment of life-threatening acid-base disturbances.
Potassium (cK+): potassium measurements are used to monitor electrolyte
balance in the diagnosis and treatment of disease conditions characterized by low
or high blood potassium levels.
Sodium (cNa+): sodium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of
aldosteronism, diabetes insipidus, adrenal hypertension, Addison's disease,
dehydration, inappropriate antidiuretic secretion, or other diseases involving
electrolyte imbalance.
Calcium (cCa2+): calcium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment
of parathyroid disease, a variety of bone diseases, chronic renal disease and
tetany.
Chloride (cCl-): chloride measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of
electrolyte and metabolic disorders such a cystic fibrosis and diabetic acidosis.
2 of 22

--- Page 3 ---
Glucose (cGlu): glucose measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of
carbohydrate metabolism disorders including diabetes mellitus and idiopathic
hypoglycemia, and of pancreatic islet cell carcinoma.
Lactate (cLac): The lactate measurements measure the concentration of lactate in
plasma. Lactate measurements are used to evaluate the acid-base status and are
used in the diagnosis and treatment of lactic acidosis (abnormally high acidity of
the blood.)
Total Hemoglobin (ctHb): total hemoglobin measurements are used to measure
the hemoglobin content of whole blood for the detection of anemia.
sO2: oxygen saturation, more specifically the ratio between the concentration of
oxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin plus reduced hemoglobin.
FO2Hb: oxyhemoglobin as a fraction of total hemoglobin.
FCOHb: carboxyhemoglobin measurements are used to determine the
carboxyhemoglobin content of human blood as an aid in the diagnosis of carbon
monoxide poisoning.
FMetHb: methemoglobin as a fraction of total hemoglobin.
FHHb: reduced hemoglobin as a fraction of total hemoglobin.
Fraction of Fetal Hemoglobin (FHbF): FHbF indicates the amount of fetal
hemoglobin. FHbF is seldom used clinically.

There are four different measuring principles employed in the sensors in the ABL90
FLEX analyzer.
• Potentiometry: The potential of a sensor chain is recorded using a voltmeter, and
related to the concentration of the sample (the Nernst equation). The
potentiometric measuring principle is applied in the pH, pCO2, K+, Na+, Ca2+
and Cl- sensors.
• Amperometry: The magnitude of an electrical current flowing through a sensor
chain is proportional to the concentration of the substance being oxidized or
reduced at an electrode in the chain. The Amperometric measuring principle is
applied in the cGlu and cLac sensors.
• Optical pO2: The optical system for pO2 is based on the ability of O2 to reduce
the intensity and time constant of the phosphorescence from a phosphorescent dye
that is in contact with the sample. This measuring principle is applied in the pO2
sensor.
• Spectrophotometry: Light passes through a cuvette containing a hemolyzed blood
sample. The specific wavelengths absorbed and their intensity generates an
absorption spectrum used to calculate oximetry parameters. This measuring
principle is used for measuring ctHb, sO2, FO2Hb, FCOHb, FHHb, FMetHb, and
FHbF
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Study design
A Point-of-care (POC) precision study was performed using NCCLS
"Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods;
Approved Guideline - Second Edition", NCCLS EP5-A2, 2004 as guidance.
The study was performed at 3 POC sites. Each site used one ABL90FLEX for
precision evaluation of syringe mode, one ABL90FLEX for precision
evaluation of capillary mode and one ABL735 for reference purposes.
The test material was prepared samples of heparinized whole blood. Samples
for all parameters were prepared to simulate high, medium and low
physiological levels. In each study multiple POC staff members performed
sample handling and sample transfer.
Each study ran over 20 test days. On each test day, each parameter and level
were tested in duplicate per run, two runs per day. The testing was performed
in both syringe and capillary mode.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity Study - Study design
The linearity study was performed according to CSLI “Evaluation of the
Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical
Approach; Approved Guideline. CSLI document EP6, 2003.
Each parameter was tested with one analyzer, one day, at least 7 levels
(except for the parameter calcium where only 6 levels were available) and
2 replicates per level.
The study was an in-house study.
Test material was:
- whole blood for pH, blood gases, pCO2, pO2, Na, K, Cl and co-
oximetry parameters
- standards for calcium
- serum pools for glucose and lactate.
Where whole blood was used as test material, the true values of the test
material were established from measurements with a secondary instrument
(predicate ABL735). Reference verified by making verification against
primary reference.
Linearity Study - Results
For each parameter the ABL90FLEX results were analyzed for linearity.

e. Analytical specificity:
a. Study design
Radiometer has defined interference limits parameters that are analyte
specific to determine whether a suspected interferent is considered an
interferent or not. The difference between test results for a sample with
and without suspected interferent was compared to the target and the
parameters were tested at their normal physiological levels. Radiometer
tested levels of interferents that are close to the required levels provided
by the standard EP7-A2.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were performed at four user sites. The purpose
was to evaluate whether the ABL90 FLEX is equivalent to a current test
method for each of the parameters measured by the ABL90FLEX analyzer
(pH, pCO2, pO2, Ca, Cl, K, Na, Glu, Lac, tHb, sO2, FO2Hb, FHHb, FCOHb,
FMetHb, FHbF). The studies were conducted in a point-of-care setting and
were using methods described in CLSI. “Method Comparison and Bias
Estimation Using Patient Samples; Approved Guideline – Second Edition”,
CLSI EP9-A2.
The material used was random patient samples and spiked blood samples.
Spiked samples were needed in order to support the full reportable range.
In each study sample handling and sample transfer were performed by
multiple POC staff members.
The studies were performed in both syringe mode and capillary mode of the
ABL90FLEX.
