L. Test Principle:
The test strips used in this device employ electrochemical biosensor technology and feature
an electrode containing the glucose dehydrogenase in the presence of the coenzyme Flavin
Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD). The chemical reaction utilizes GDH-FAD to catalyze the
formation of gluconic acid from the oxidation of glucose whereby two electrons are
produced. Through the mechanism of the mediator, electrical current is generated and it is
proportional to the quantity of glucose in the sample.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was conducted using venous whole blood incubated for 16 hours at
room temperature to deplete glucose in the sample. Glucose was adjusted to 11
concentration levels ranging from 11-773 mg/dL. Five measurements were performed
at each glucose concentration with one lot of test strips on the FORA POCT S10 test
system. For the study, the upper and lower flags for less than 20 mg/dL and greater
than 600 mg/dL were disabled. All samples were also tested on the YSI 2300
analyzer to generate the expected values. The observed values were plotted against
the expected values and an appropriate line fitted by standard linear regression
analysis.
The analysis yielded this result: y = 1.0071x – 1.7997, r2 = 0.999.
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claim that the test system is linear from
20-600 mg/dL.
Results below 20 mg/dL and results greater than 600 mg/dL are flagged by the test
system and reported only as “Less than 20 mg/dL” or “More than 600 mg/dL.”
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The unopened vials of test strips are stable for 24 months when stored at 2 - 32°C.
Once opened, they are stable for 90 days when stored at 2 – 32 °C.

The FORA Control Solutions were cleared under k093724. Value assignment was
validated with 25 FORA POCT S10 glucose meters, one lot of test strips, and 25
measurements per level. Test results must fall within the range printed on the test
strip vial.
Control Solutions are stable for twenty-four (24) months from the date of
manufacture when stored at 36°-86°F (2°-30°C) unopened. Each bottle of control is
stable for three months (90 days) after opening, if tightly closed after each use and
within the labeled expiration date of the product.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit is 20 mg/dL. See linearity/assay reportable range above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was conducted to determine the effect of selected endogenous and
exogenous substances on the test system. The potential interferants were tested at
therapeutic or normal ranges and also at above therapeutic and toxic ranges. Venous
blood samples at two glucose concentrations, 60-70 mg/dL and 150-160 mg/dL, were
prepared and divided into a test (dosed) pool and a control pool. Paired differences of
glucose measurements between test samples and control samples were calculated to
determine the bias. There was less than +/10% bias for the substances listed below at
the listed concentrations.

The test strip labeling contains the following warnings for these compounds:
Mannitol: Falsely elevated blood glucose levels may be seen with high blood
concentrations of mannitol >5,000 mg/dL as may occur with high dose mannitol
administration, obesity (when dosed on a per kilogram basis), and or delayed
renal clearance. Test results should be confirmed with a laboratory method for
patients that fit any of these clinical situations or if results do not correlate with
clinical symptoms.
Xylose: Do not test blood glucose during or soon after a xylose absorption test.
Xylose in the blood will give falsely elevated blood glucose results.
Pralidoxime containing compounds:
Do not use this test system with any patients being treated with pralidoxime
containing compounds.
Mannose: Large quantities of food and dietary supplements containing mannose
in high doses may interfere with this test.
Acetaminophen (>10 mg/dL), dopamine (>1.25 mg/dL), methyl-dopa (>1.25
mg/dL) and L-dopa (>0.7 mg/dL) at concentrations in excess of therapeutic levels
may produce falsely elevated glucose results. Uric acid at physiological
concentrations > 10 mg/dL may produce falsely elevated glucose results.
Hematocrit:
The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated using blood samples at
nine glucose concentrations spanning the range of the device (20-600 mg/dL).
The glucose samples were prepared from whole blood at twelve different
hematocrit levels ranging from 15-65%. Glucose results for each concentration
and hematocrit level were compared to the same samples tested on the YSI
reference method. The data supports the sponsor’s claim that hematocrit 20%-
60% does not significantly interfere (more than ± 15%) with glucose
measurements using the test system.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor performed combined accuracy and point-of-care studies and according to
the requirements of ISO 15197. Testing was conducted at 3 sites with seven (7)
operators reflective of the intended users of the device. Fresh capillary blood samples
from the finger-tip were obtained from a total of 300 subjects, 100 subjects at each
site, and tested on both the FORA POCT S10 BGMS test system and a reference
method, Yellow Springs Instrument (YSI-2300). Additionally, a venous whole blood
sample was obtained from the same subjects and tested on each method.
Glucose samples spanned the reportable range of the device. Of the 100 specimens at
each site, 5 specimens >400 mg/dL were spiked (15 total) and 7 specimens in total
were allowed to glycolyze to obtain a low glucose value <40 mg/dL. The results are
summarized below:

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger and venous
whole blood. Samples are applied directly to the test strip.
5. Calibration:
Operators are required to code the meter when using the system for the first time or when
using a using new vial of test strips. This is accomplished by scanning the test strip vial
barcode with the barcode reader.
6. Quality Control:
One level of control solution (Level 2) is supplied with the device. Additional control
solutions (Levels 1 and 3) may be purchased separately. Recommendations on when to
test the control materials are provided in the labeling. The labeling also states that users
should follow local, state, and federal regulations for quality control testing.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. An altitude effect study was performed by testing nine different venous samples with
glucose values from 40-658 mg/dL (upper meter limit disabled) using the FORA POCT
S10 Blood Glucose Monitoring System in an altitude simulation chamber. Testing was
performed at sea level, 5,000, 11,500, and 15,000 feet using four meters.
At each simulated altitude tested, results using the FORA POCT S10 test system were
compared to results using the YSI glucose analyzer.
At altitudes up to 15,000 feet, overall results were within +/-10% of YSI values.
2. Temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated for temperatures ranging
from 10oC to 40oC and relative humidity from 10% to 85%. Protocol and acceptance
criteria were provided and found to be acceptable. The results supported the Sponsor’s
claimed operating temperature from 10oC to 40oC (50oF to 104oF) and relative humidity
below 85%.

3. EMC testing was evaluated and certified by an external company and a letter of
attestation was issued to TaiDoc on April 2, 2009.
4. The device is intended for multiple patient use by health care professionals. Micro-Kill+
cleaner disinfectant towels (EPA registration # 59894-10-37549) were validated for use
with the meter whereby complete inactivation of live virus was demonstrated. The
sponsor also demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the external
materials of the meter after 10,000 cleaning and disinfection cycles designed to simulate
3 years of device use. Labeling has been reviewed for adequate instructions on the
validated cleaning and disinfection procedures. The sponsor does not market a lancing
device for use with the device. Auto-disabling, single use lancing devices need to be
purchased separately.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
