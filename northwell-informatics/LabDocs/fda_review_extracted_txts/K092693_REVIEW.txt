H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Viramed Biotech AG Borrelia B31 IgG ViraStripe® is an in vitro qualitative
assay for the detection of IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi in human serum.
It is intended for use in the testing of human serum samples which have been
found positive or equivocal using an EIA or IFA test procedure for B. burgdorferi
antibodies. Positive results from this line blot assay are supportive evidence of
infection with B. burgdorferi, the causative agent for Lyme disease. The Viramed
Biotech AG Borrelia B31 IgG ViraStripe® can be used anytime after onset
provided the EIA or IFA are positive or equivocal. It should also be used for
follow-up when: 1) Only IgM antibodies were found positive in a line blot assay
or Western blot, 2) IgG antibodies were found by line blot or Western blot but
were not considered significant by the CDC criteria for a positive IgG Western
blot, 3) previously tested sero-negative individuals are shown to develop
antibodies by an EIA or IFA test.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Viramed Biotech AG Borrelia B31 IgG ViraStripe® is an in vitro qualitative
assay for the detection of IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi in human serum.
It is intended for use in the testing of human serum samples which have been
found positive or equivocal using an EIA or IFA test procedure for B. burgdorferi

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use
4. Special instrument requirements:
None
I. Device Description:
This is a line blot assay to detect IgG to individual B. burgdorferi antigens.
B. burgdorferi antigens from a B31 passage tick strain are purified by
2

--- Page 3 ---
electrophoretic and chromatographic methodologies and line striped on a
nitrocellulose membrane. B. burgdorferi antigens are bound and fixed to the
solid phase nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane is blocked, dried and
cut into individual test strips.
For each test to be performed, the line blot strip and diluted test serum is added to
a line blot strip well. If specific antibodies that recognize an antigen are present,
they will bind to the specific antigens on the strip. After incubation the line blot
strip is washed to remove unbound antibodies. Alkaline-phosphatase anti-human
IgG conjugate is then added to each strip and incubated. If antibody is present, the
conjugate will bind to the antibody attached to the specific antigens. The strip is
washed to remove unbound conjugate and the substrate solution is added. If the
enzyme/antibody complex is present, the substrate will undergo a precipitation
and color change. After an incubation period, the reaction is stopped and the
presence of precipitated substrate is visualized at specific locations on the strip.
The presence of a colored precipitation at various locations on the line blot strip is
an indirect measurement of Borrelia burgdorferi specific antibodies in the patient
specimen. A uniform band locator is given on the evaluation protocol and used to
locate and identify specific Borrelia burgdorferi B31 antibodies on the line blot
test strip. Every strip has an integrated control system including function control
and conjugate control. Visualized bands from the reaction are compared for
intensity with a separate strip containing the Cut-off control band for evaluation.
Any band found having a visual intensity equal to or greater than the Cut-off
control band intensity is considered as a significant band.
Positivity: The criteria for a positive Western blot result defined by the CDC
are followed. For B. burgdorferi IgG positivity, the blot should be positive
for at least 5 of 10 bands: 93, 66, 58, 45, 41, 39, 30, 28, 23, and 18kDa

by separate technicians at a single site (Viramed Biotech AG) using one
lot. The serum panel specimens were selected to represent negative to
high-positive immune-reactivity levels. For this study, two different
readers within the three different laboratories assessed the band
identification for each sample on the same blot. There was identical
testing of all bands by each reporter for each sample.

INTERFERING SUBSTANCES
There is no discussion regarding interfering substances in the submission. The
proposed package insert contains the following:
“Haemolysed, lipemic, or icteric sera should not be used for testing, in
addition sera with elevated bilirubin, and triglycerides were not tested. The
performance of this assay when testing sera from patients with any
immune-deficient diseases such as HIV, HTLV, etc. and sera from
patients that have had immune-suppressive therapy with drugs or
medications is not known because no studies were conducted to assess the
performance. Do not use heat-inactivated sera.”
