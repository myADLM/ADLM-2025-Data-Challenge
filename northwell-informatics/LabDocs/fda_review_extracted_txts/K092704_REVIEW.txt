4. Special instrument requirements:
Abbott m2000 System
I. Device Description:
Abbott RealTime CT/NG consists of two reagent kits:
• Abbott RealTime CT/NG Amplification Reagent Kit
• Abbott RealTime CT/NG Control Kit
The Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay uses PCR technology with homogenous real-
time fluorescence detection on the m2000 System. The Abbott m2000 System
consists of the Abbott m2000sp and Abbott m2000rt instruments. The Abbott
m2000 System integrates sample preparation with nucleic acid amplification and
detection to generate assay results. The Abbott m2000sp is used for processing
samples and the Abbott m2000rt is used for amplification and detection.
The Abbott multi-Collect Specimen Collection Kit can be used to collect either a
swab or a urine specimen. Each Abbott multi -Collect Specimen Collection Kit
contains:
• One Transport Tube containing 1.2 mL Specimen Transport Buffer
• One Individually Packaged Sterile Specimen Collection Swab (Part No. CD650)
• One disposable transfer pipette.
The Specimen Transport Buffer consists of guanidine thiocyanate, a chaotropic
salt, in Tris buffer and is used to stabilize DNA until sample preparation. The
individually packaged sterile Specimen Collection Swab is used for swab sample
collection and placed directly into the Transport Tube. The transfer pipette is used
to add approximately 3 mL of urine to the Transport Tube. The Abbott multi -
Collect Specimen Collection Kit is for single use only.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
Analytical Sensitivity
The Limit of Detection (LOD) claim for the RealTime CT/NG assay is 320 copies
of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) target DNA and 320 copies of Neisseria
gonorrhoeae (NG) target DNA per assay. The assay targets the Chlamydia
trachomatis cryptic plasmid (present at approximately 7 to 10 copies per
Chlamydia organism) and the multicopy opacity gene of Neisseria gonorrhoeae
(repeated up to 11 times per organism). Thus, 320 copies of target DNA is
equivalent to approximately 30 to 40 organisms per assay. The LOD of the Abbott
RealTime CT/NG assay is defined as CT and NG target DNA concentration
detected with a probability of 95% or greater. The CT and NG DNA
concentrations detected with 95% probability were determined by testing
dilutions of CT and NG target DNA. Probit analysis of the data determined that
the concentration of CT DNA detected with 95% probability was 21 copies/
assay (95% CI 18 - 28), the concentration of nvCT DNA detected with 95%
probability was 29 copies/assay (95% CI 24 - 41), and the concentration of NG
DNA detected with 95% probability was 149 copies/assay (95% CI 130 - 176).
The claimed assay LOD was confirmed by testing samples that contained 320
copies of CT, nvCT and NG target DNA per assay. The detection rate was 100%
(405/405) for CT, 100% (403/403) for nvCT, and 99.5% (403/405) for NG in the
assay. An additional study was conducted to challenge the performance of the
Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay in samples containing high target numbers of CT,
nvCT, or NG in the presence of low target numbers of the opposite analyte.
Samples were prepared to contain 320 CT or nvCT target DNA copies and 1 x
107 NG target DNA copies per assay, or 1 x 107 CT or nvCT target DNA copies
and 320 NG target DNA copies per assay. The detection rate of 320 copies of CT
or nvCT DNA in the presence of high NG target was 100% (405/405). The
4

Page 5 of 20
detection rate of 320 copies of NG DNA in the presence of high CT or nvCT
target was 100% (405/405). The analytical sensitivity of the Abbott RealTime
CT/NG assay for detecting Chlamydia trachomatis serovars A through L was
determined by testing dilutions of each serovar. Serovars A through K and L1
through L3 were detected at less than 1 Inclusion Forming Units (IFU) per assay.
Additionally, nvCT was diluted and was also detected at less than 1 IFU per
assay. The analytical sensitivity of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay for
detecting 28 different isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae was determined by
testing dilutions of each isolate. All isolates were detected at less than 1 Colony
Forming Unit (CFU)/assay.
Evaluation of Potential Cross-Reactants
A total of 111 strains of bacteria, viruses, parasites, yeast, and fungi were tested
for potential cross reactivity in the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay (table below).
These included organisms that are phylogenetically related to CT and NG, and
those that can be found in the urogenital tract. Purified DNA or RNA was diluted
to a final concentration of 1 x 107copies/assay. HBV DNA and HCV RNA were
added directly into the PCR reaction at approximately 3 x 105and 9 x 106copies
per reaction, respectively. All results were negative for both CT and NG.
A total of 32 culture isolates were tested for potential cross reactivity in the
Abbott RealTime assay. These included 27 organisms listed in table below, and
Neisseria cinerea, Neisseria lactamica, Neisseria sicca, Ca Ski cells containing
HPV 16, and Hela cells containing HPV 18. Ca Ski cells containing HPV 16 and
Hela cells containing HPV 18 were tested at 105cells per assay, C. pneumoniae
and C. psittaci were tested at 106EB per assay, HSV-1 and HSV-2 were tested at
106genomes per assay, and the rest of the organisms were tested at 106Colony
Forming Units (CFU) per assay. All results were negative for both CT and NG.

Precision
A precision study was performed at three sites, two external and one internal.
Each site was provided a fifteen-member panel. Nine panel members targeted
different combinations of CT and NG concentrations and six panel members
targeted different combinations of nvCT and NG concentrations. The source
material for CT was Vero/LGV-II, strain 434. The source material for nvCT was

Page 7 of 20
strain 68226. The source material for NG was ATCC isolate 27628 and 31426.
Five replicates of each panel member were tested in each run. Thirty runs (10 per
site) were performed for a total of 150 replicates of each panel member. The study
included three amplification reagent lots. Each site tested two amplification
reagent lots. A variance components analysis for a nested model was performed
on delta cycle (DC) values, and the results are summarized in Tables 3 and 4.
