L. Test Principle:
Patient samples are diluted 1:101 in sample buffer, 100 µL of each diluted patient
sample and pre-diluted controls and calibrators are added to the antigen coated
microtiter wells and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. After incubation
the microtiter well strips are washed with wash buffer to remove unbound antibodies
and 100 µL of the anti-human IgG enzyme conjugate reagent is added to each
microtiter well. After an additional 30-minutes incubation at room temperature, the
microtiter wells are again washed 3 times with 300 µL of wash buffer to remove any
unbound enzyme conjugate and 100 µL of the chromogen substrate is added. The
strips are incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature and 100 µL stop solution is
added. The microtiter plates are placed in an ELISA reader and read at a wavelength
of 450 nm and a reference wavelength of between 620 nm and 650 nm within 30
minutes.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the test was investigated by determining the intra- and
inter-assay coefficients of variation (CV) using sera with values at different
points on the calibration curve. The intra-assay CVs are based on 20
determinations and the inter-assay CVs on 4 determinations performed on 6
different days. All CVs were < 12%. The following results were obtained:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the test was investigated using serial dilutions of five different
patient sera with high antibody concentrations. Each patient serum was
diluted up to 1/32 with low-activity serum. The dilutions were measured with
the Anti-M2-3E ELISA (IgG) according to the package insert in single
determinations and the results calculated in RU/ml. With the exception of two
diluted samples, observed/expected (O/E) values in the area of the cut-off
were within the specifications (0.8 > O/E > 1.2). In one of the cases where
O/E was low (0.7) the activity of the sample was close to the Limit of
Quantitation.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: There are no reference standards for these analytes.
Stability: Reagents were shown to be stable for up to four weeks under
accelerated conditions (room temperature). Original sealed kits were
demonstrated to be stable for 12 months when stored at 2-8oC. Opened kits
were demonstrated to be stable for up to 12 months when stored at 2-8oC.
Reconstituted wash buffer was shown to be stable for up to 28 days.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Detection was determined to be 0.90 RU/mL based on a formula
from the ICH Q2B guideline. The Limit of Quantitation is defined as the
lowest calibrator used in the assay (2 RU/mL).
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity: Cross reactivity was investigated using a panel of 29 sera
serologically positive for antibodies against parietal cells (PCA, n = 10),
glomerular basement membrane (GBM, n = 10) and liver-kidney microsomes

(LKM, n = 9). All 29 sera were negative in the Anti-M2-3E ELISA (IgG), so
no cross reactivity is expected for these three autoantibodies.
Interferences: Interference testing was performed at five different anti-M2-3E
levels ranging 4-186 RU/mL. No significant interference was observed for
concentrations up to 1000 mg/dL hemoglobin, 2000 mg/dL triglycerides, and
40 mg/dL bilirubin. Recovery values ranged 94-123%. Only one of the five
samples showed a recovery value over 110%, and only with triglycerides
added.
f. Assay cut-off:
The levels of anti-mitochondrial antibodies (IgG) were analyzed with the
EUROIMMUN Anti-M2-3E ELISA (IgG) in a panel of 400 apparently
healthy blood donors, consisting of 251 men and 149 women with an age
range of 19-69 years (average age: 40 years). With a cut-off of 20 RU/mL, all
blood donors were found negative.
Lowest value 0.35 RU/mL
Highest value 14.50 RU/mL
Mean value 3.81 RU/mL
Std dev. (SD) 2.944 RU/mL
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 48 samples with anti-M2-3E (IgG) results within the reportable
range of the EUROIMMUN Anti-M2-3E ELISA device (2-200 RU/mL) were
evaluated and results were compared to the results for the predicate device.
The results and the positive and negative agreement between the device and
the predicate are shown below.
At time of presentation, most (>90%) patients with primary biliary cirrhosis
are characterized by extremely high titers of anti-M2-3E1, well above the
upper end of the reportable range of the EUROIMMUN assay (200 RU/mL).
These samples are not included in the analysis below. Most of the patient
samples with anti-M2-3E results in the range 20-200 RU/mL were patients
with autoimmune hepatitis/PBC overlap syndrome. In order to cover the
assay measuring range, 7 artificial samples (created by mixing high and low
samples) were also considered in the analysis below.
