Treatment Reagent 2 (Dithiothreitol or DTT) are aspirated and dispensed into a
reaction vessel (RV). In Pre-Treatment Step 2, an aliquot of sample/ Pre-Treatment
Reagent 2 mixture is aspirated and dispensed into a second RV. Pre-Treatment
Reagent1 (potassium hydroxide or KOH) is then added. An aliquot of the pre-treated
sample is transferred into a third RV, followed by the addition of Folate Binding
Protein (FBP) coated paramagnetic microparticles and assay specific diluent. Folate
present in the sample binds to the FBP coated microparticles. After washing, pteroic
acid-acridinium labeled conjugate is added and binds to unoccupied sites on the FBP-
coated microparticles. Pre-Trigger and Trigger Solutions are then added to the
reaction mixture; the resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light
units (RLUs). An inverse relationship exists between the amount of folate in the
sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT i optical system.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All performance characteristics were done on the Architect i 2000 SR analyzer.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were evaluated using CLSI EP5-A2 as a guideline. The
sponsor conducted within-run, between-run, between-day, and total precision
with three serum controls and three serum panels. All samples were tested in
replicates of 3, in two runs per day, for a minimum of 20 days. Two lots of
reagents were used and results are shown below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies were evaluated using the CLSI EP6-A as a guideline. A low
serum pool sample and a high serum pool sample were mixed to create inter-
dilutions of 11 mixed serum samples for the linearity study. All samples were
tested in duplicates on the Architect i 2000SR analyzer. The recovered folate
values were plotted against the expected values and an appropriate line fitted
by standard linear regression was performed. The percent recovery of all the
samples ranged from 97.5% to 104.8%. The linear equation generated is
Y=1.0062X + 0.0342 with regression coefficient (R2) of 0.999.
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed that the assay is linear
from 1.6 to 20.0 ng/mL.
Extended dilution study:
If serum folate is greater than 20 ng/mL, the analyzer can perform an auto-
dilution of 1:2. To demonstrate the recovery of the auto-dilution capability of
the analyzer, a dilution recover study was performed to evaluate the auto-
dilution capability. 18 serum samples with folate values ranging from 20 to
40 ng/mL were automatically diluted by 1:2 and results were compared with
the manual dilution of 1:2 and 1:4. All samples were tested in triplicate. The
percent recovery of all the samples ranged from 98.5% to 119.6% when auto-
dilution of 1:2 was compared to manual-dilution of 1:2. Based on the data,
the sponsor concluded that when results are greater than 20 ng/mL, the user
can either perform a manual 1:2 or a 1:4 dilution or use the analyzer to
automatically dilute the sample by 1:2 to get the final results.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
6

--- Page 7 ---
ARCHITECT Folate assay is traceable to the WHO serum folate International
Standard 03/178.
Value assignment:
Architect folate assay calibrators and controls are manufactured using
pteroylglutamic acid (PGA or folic acid) and the concentration values are
assigned against internal reference standards. The internal reference standards
are assigned against the WHO serum folate International standard 03/178.
The concentration values of the working reference calibrators and controls
were assigned by testing multiple times on three instruments using two lots of
reagents. The sponsor’s protocol and acceptance criteria was reviewed and
found to be acceptable.
Stability:
ARCHITECT Folate assay utilize a six-level calibrators, calibrators A to F
with assigned target values. Calibrators must be stored in the carton box to
protect them from light. Stability of the calibrators is determined by the real-
time stability study and is still on-going. The sponsor determined that the
calibrators have a shelf-life stability of 10 months when stored at ≤-10oC and
an open-vial stability of 3 months when stored at ≤-10oC. Calibrators must be
discarded after 3 freeze-thaw cycle.
ARCHITECT Folate controls contain 3 levels of control materials, low,
medium, and high. Controls must be stored in the carton box to protect them
from light. Stability of the calibrators is determined by accelerated life testing
and the real-time stability study is still on-going. The sponsor determined that
the controls has a shelf-life stability of 18 months when stored at 2-8oC and an
open-vial stability of 3 months when stored at 2-8oC.
The sponsor’s protocol and acceptance criteria was reviewed and found to be
acceptable.
Recommendations in the labeling for preparation of calibrator and control
materials include the following: calibrators and controls must be completely
thawed before use at room temperature for at least 45 minutes and mixed
gently before use.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor determined the detection limits according to the CLSI EP 17-A
guideline. Limit of detection is defined as the lowest amount of analyte that
can be detected. Limit of Quantitation is defined as the lowest concentration
at which the analyte is reliably detected and at which the uncertainty of the
observed test result is less than or equal to the goal set. The LoB, LoD, and
7

--- Page 8 ---
LoQ were determined by assaying one blank sample 80 times and five low
folate samples in replicates of 80 on two instruments over 3 days. All the
samples were assayed on the ARCHITECT i 2000SR analyzer. The sponsor
determined that the LoB is 0.3 ng/mL, LoD is 0.6 ng/mL and LoQ is 2.0
ng/dL at the observed total error of 20%.
The ARCHITECT folate assay has a linearity range of 1.6 to 20.0 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were evaluated according to the CLSI EP7-A2 guideline.
Two different levels of folate samples were spiked with one level of potential
interferants. The test (spiked) samples and reference (unspiked) samples were
assayed in replicates of 38 on the ARCHITECT i 2000SR analyzer. The
differences between the spiked and unspiked samples were calculated and the
sponsor defined no significant interference as differences of <10% with folate
levels >3.5 ng/mL and ≤ 0.4 ng/mL for folate levels ≤ 3.5 ng/mL. Based on
the data, the sponsor claims no significant interference for the substances and
concentrations listed in the table below:

It is well-known that hemolysis falsely elevated the serum folate results;
therefore, the sponsor has the following limitation in their package insert:
“Do not use hemolyzed specimens. Serum or plasma specimens that are
hemolyzed will give falsely elevated folate levels.”
Cross-reactivity: Aminopterin, Folinic acid, and Methotrexate are
chemotherapeutic agents whose structures are similar to folate and will cross-
react with the folate assay and patients who are using these drugs should not
have their folate tested with Architect folate assay. Therefore, the sponsor has
the following limitation in their package insert:
“Methotrexate, aminopterin, and folinic acid (Leucovorin) are

These agents cross react with folate binding protein in folate assays. Do not
use the Architect folate assay for patients using these drugs”.
Cross-reactivity studies were performed and the results are listed below.

Methotrexate 2.7 ≥ 100 ng/mL 2.1
Methotrexate 7.6 ≥ 100 ng/mL 1.4
Additionally, the sponsor has the following statements in the limitation
section of their labeling:
“Specimens from patients who have received preparations of mouse
monoclonal antibodies for diagnosis or therapy may contain human anti-
mouse antibodies (HAMA). Such specimens may show either falsely elevated
or depressed values when tested with assay kits that employ mouse
monoclonal antibodies.”
“Heterophilic antibodies in human serum can react with reagent
immunoglobulins, interfering with in vitro immunoassays. Patients routinely
exposed to animals or to animal serum products can be prone to this
interference and anomalous values may be observed.”
“Serum and plasma specimens from patients with renal impairment or failure
(including dialysis patients) may exhibit varying degrees of falsely depressed
folate values. Therefore, to evaluate patients with renal impairment or failure
who also exhibit low folate levels, it is recommended that low ARCHITECT
folate values be confirmed by an alternate folate method.”

according to the CLSI EP9-A2 guideline. 137 serum samples were assayed
on the Architect i 2000SR analyzer (Y) and the AxSYM analyzer (X). The
serum folate Deming regression equation is Y = 1.06X – 2.77 (95% CI for
slope is 0.98, 1.15 and 95% CI for intercept is -3.86, -1.67) with a correlation
coefficient (R) of 0.90. The results ranged from 1.6 to 19.9 ng/mL.
b. Matrix comparison:
i.) Twenty-seven paired serum samples with 5 different types of blood
collection tubes (plain glass serum, plain plastic serum, plastic serum with
separator, lithium heparin plasma, and lithium heparin plasma with gel
separator) spanning the folate range from 6.3 to 19.8 ng/mL were assayed
on the Architect i2000SR analyzer. Summary of the Deming regression
analysis is shown in the table below:
Slope with CI Intercept with CI R N
