4. Panel:
Microbiology
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
BBL™ CHROMagar™ MRSA II is a selective and differential chromogenic medium
for the qualitative direct detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) to aid in the prevention and control of MRSA infections in healthcare
settings. The test is performed on anterior nares swab specimens from patients to
screen for MRSA colonization.
BBL™ CHROMagar™ MRSA II is not intended to diagnose MRSA infection, guide
or monitor treatment for MRSA infections. A negative result does not preclude
MRSA nasal colonization. Concomitant cultures are necessary to recover organism
for organism identification, susceptibility testing or epidemiological typing.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable
I. Device Description:
BBL™ CHROMagar™ MRSA II medium permits the direct detection and
identification of MRSA through the incorporation of specific chromogenic substrates
and the antibiotic cefoxitin. MRSA strains will grow in the presence of cefoxitin and
produce mauve-colored colonies resulting from hydrolysis of the chromogenic

substrate. Selective agents are incorporated for the suppression of gram-negative
organisms, yeast and enterococci and some other gram-positive cocci. Bacteria other
than MRSA may utilize other chromogenic substrates in the medium resulting in the
growth of colonies that are not mauve.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility study included seven MRSA (6 heterozygous and 1
homozygous MRSA isolates), three Methicillin-Susceptible S. aureus
(MSSA), tested in triplicates, on three separate days, at three clinical sites.
All results were as expected.
10 x 3 operators x 3 days x 3 sites= 270
Reproducibility was >95%.
The precision study was performed using three different lots over three days
by three independent readers. There were nine MRSA, two Borderline
Oxacillin Resistant S. aureus (BORSA), and nine non-MRSA.
All results were as expected.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended quality control (QC) organisms, S. aureus ATCC 43300 as
positive control, and S. aureus ATCC 29213 as negative control were used.
Quality control data were compiled across all three sites and all QC results
were acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable
e. Analytical sensitivity:
Analytical reactivity (sensitivity) study was performed on archived
collection of 292 MRSA (including USA 100, 300, 400, 500, 700, 800)
isolates. Each MRSA isolate was inoculated using a suspension of 105
CFU/mL on two CMRSA II plates and read by at least two readers. Three
different lots were used in the analytical sensitivity study. The table below
demonstrates the analytical sensitivity of CMRSA II with MRSA strains.

2 584 546 93.49% 91.18% - 95.35%
There were 25 false negatives with lot 1. Five MRSA strains did not grow on
the CMRSA II and 20 MRSA strains produced non-mauve colonies on the
CMRSA II.
There were also 25 false negatives with lot 2. Five MRSA strains did not grow
on the CMRSA II and 20 MRSA strains produced non-mauve colonies on the
CMRSA II.
There were 23 false negatives with lot 3. Three 3 MRSA strains did not grow
on the CMRSA II and 20 MRSA strains produced non-mauve colonies on the
CMRSA II.
There were a total of 27 discrepant results in the analytical reactivity study.
These discrepant results were further evaluated on the CMRSA II using a
suspension of 106 CFU/mL. Ten µl of this suspension was then inoculated on
to CMRSA II. Twenty-five of the twenty-seven isolates evaluated produced
mauve colonies on CMRSA II at 24 h at this concentration.
Recovery Study (Limit of Detection (LoD))
The recovery study included two well characterized and recognized MRSA
strains (ATCC 33592 and ATCC 43300) and two in house strains. Analytical
studies such as incubation time, analytical reactivity or sensitivity, interfering
substances and reproducibility study were all performed using MRSA
concentration of 1x105 CFU/mL. Challenge testing was performed at a final
concentration 107to 108CFU/mL.

f. Analytical specificity:
Analytical specificity was performed on archived collection of 275 non-
MRSA (including 96 Methicillin Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA),
88 Coagulase negative Staphylococci and 91 miscellaneous) isolates. Each
isolate was inoculated on two CMRSA II plates and read by at least two
readers. Three different lots were used in the analytical specificity study. The

Interference Study
Interfering substances, such as, human blood, over-the -counter (OTC) nasal
sprays, antihistamines, steroids, mucous, and menthol were evaluated for potential
interference of growth of MRSA on BBL™ CHROMagar™ MRSA II (CMRSA
II) medium. Nasal sprays containing azelastine hydrochloride, fluticasone
propionate, oxymetazoline hydrochloride and OTC throat drops containing
menthol were found to have an inhibitory effect on the growth of MRSA. These
substances will be listed in the proposed package insert as potentially interfering
substances.
Additionally, five transport devices were evaluated for their impact on the
recovery of MRSA on the CMRSA II medium. All five transport devices were
found to have no effect on MRSA recovery.
Incubation Time
An Incubation Time study was performed on 50 MRSA and 50 non-MRSA to
determine the performance of CMRSA II at specified incubation times. A
recommendation of 24- hour read (20 – 26 hours incubation) will be included in
the package insert. A limitation statement will be included that incubation shorter
than 20 hours may reduce the sensitivity of CMRSA II.
Additional Tests
One hundred and sixty five characterized isolates were evaluated to determine
whether coagulase and Staphylococcus latex agglutination testing could be
performed directly from the CMRSA II plate. Each isolate was inoculated onto a
blood agar plate and then onto CMRSA II. Tube coagulase and Staphylococcus
latex agglutination testing was then performed from each plate and compared to
the expected result. Both the blood agar plate and CMRSA II plates demonstrate
expected results.

plates and each site’s routine procedure for identification of S. aureus , i.e.,
(Traditional Culture) to CMRSA II plates. The traditional culture method
included Staphylococcal latex agglutination testing for two sites and the third
site included coagulase testing. All S. aureus recovered were tested for mec-A
mediated oxacillin resistance by the cefoxitin disk diffusion test. Cefoxitin
disk (30µg) diffusion test results followed CLSI methods and interpretive
criteria. The CMRSA II was interpreted as positive for MRSA at 20-26 hours
based on detection of mauve colonies. The performance of CMRSA II vs
Cefoxitin Disk is demonstrated in the table below.
