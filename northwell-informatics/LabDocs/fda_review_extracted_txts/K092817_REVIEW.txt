I. Device Description:
The POCone Infrared Spectrophotometer is a compact analyzer designed for on-site
performance of the 13CO -urea breath test. For the test the patient provides an initial breath
2
sample (reference or baseline) by blowing into an Otsuka breath collection bag. After
ingestion of 13C-labeled urea and after a specified period of time, another breath sample is
provided (test or post dose) by blowing into a second breath collection bag. The bag includes
a mouthpiece and port compatible with the inlet ports of the POCone. The mouthpiece end of
the bag has a one way valve which prevents loss of breath sample. The POCone has 2 ports
for attaching the breath collection bags. After attachment, the reference and test breath
samples are automatically injected and measurements are performed by the POCone for
approximately 2 minutes. User interface with the POCone is by means of a keypad and LCD
screen on the front panel. An internal printer is provided to allow subject information and test
results to be printed.
The POC-AS10 Auto sampler is an optional accessory that expands the number of breath
collection bags that can be set and analyzed by the POCone Infrared Spectrophotometer. By
connecting the POC-AS10 Auto sampler to the POCone Infrared Spectrophotometer, up to
ten pairs of breath collection bags can be set up at one time.

removes moisture from the breath and meters the samples into the measurement cell. Light
from a temperature-stabilized infrared light source passes through a mechanical chopper and
then through each gas sample. The intensity of the transmitted signal is measured by a cooled
infrared detector. The instrument measures absorption of breath gas by calculating the ratios
of 13CO /12CO for the reference breath gas and sample breath gas. The difference between

M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was performed to assess the within-run precision of the
POCone with the POC-AS10 connected by replicate measurements of standard gas
samples. Four standard gas samples with different 13CO /12CO ratios containing 3%
2 2
CO were used in the study. The values for the standard gas samples were determined
2
by the conventional GIRMS method. Among these standard gas samples, the one
having the lowest δ13C value (-32.7‰) was used as the reference gas and the Δ13C
values were calculated for the other 3 standard gas samples (Δ1.7‰, Δ13.7‰,
Δ26.7‰) in addition to Δ0‰ gas for zero balance check. Measurements on each of
the gases were performed using three different sets of POCone with POC-AS10,
paired with reference gas sample.
The standard deviation for the four gas values measured ranged from 0.06‰ to
0.17‰. No significant difference in the standard deviations among the three devices
or the gas values was evident.

Linearity established in K041148. This modification did not affect Linearity or

Yes ____X___ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Patient ID can be input by key operation or ID read by barcode reader.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Patient provides breath samples by blowing into breath collection bags. Two samples are
provided namely the initial reference sample and after ingestion of C-urea, the post dose
sample. Breath collection bags are manually placed on the inlet ports of the POCone or in
the POC-AS10 Auto sampler for gas measurement analysis.
5. Calibration:
The instrument self-calibrates.
6. Quality Control:
The POCone automatically performs self-diagnostic instrument checks. It is also
recommended that the precision of the instrument be checked regularly, at least once a
month. Additionally each laboratory should follow procedures it has established for
internal quality control
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Testing for carry-over was performed on the POCone alone and with the POCone connected
to the POC-AS10.
Results of carry-over testing with individual POCone devices alone as well as with the POC-
AS10 demonstrated negligible carry-over and inter-device variability.
