H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
The epoc Blood Analysis System is intended for use by trained medical
professionals as an in vitro diagnostic device for the quantitative testing of
samples of heparinized or un-anticoagulated arterial, venous or capillary whole
blood in the laboratory or at the point of care in hospitals, nursing homes or other
clinical care institutions.
Care-Fill Capillary Tubes are intended for use with the epoc Blood Analysis
system and are used for the collection and dispensing of capillary blood samples
with epoc Test Cards.
The Blood Gas Electrolyte (BGE) test card panel configuration includes sensors
for Sodium - Na, Potassium - K, Calcium - iCa, pH, pCO2, pO2 and Hematocrit -
Hct.
The Blood Gas Electrolyte (BGEM) test card panel configuration includes sensors
for Sodium - Na, Potassium - K, Calcium - iCa, pH, pCO2, pO2, Hematocrit - Hct
and Glucose - Glu.
Measurement of sodium is used in diagnosis and treatment of diseases involving
electrolyte imbalance.
Measurement of potassium is used in diagnosis and treatment of diseases
involving electrolyte imbalance.
Measurement of Ionized Calcium is used in diagnosis and treatment of
parathyroid disease, a variety of bone diseases, chronic renal disease and tetany.
Measurement of pH, pCO2, pO2 (blood gases) is used in the diagnosis and
treatment of life-threatening acid-base disturbances.
Measurement of Hct distinguishes normal from abnormal states of blood volume,
such as anemia and erythrocytosis.
Glucose measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of carbohydrate
metabolism disorders including diabetes mellitus, idiopathic hypoglycemia, and
of pancreatic islet cell tumors.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use
4. Special instrument requirements:
epoc Card Reader, epoc Host, epoc BGE and epoc BGEM
2 of 9

--- Page 3 ---
I. Device Description:
The epoc Care-Fill Capillary Tubes are finished components that are packaged and
labeled for use and general sale as an accessory to the epoc Blood Analysis System.
The Care-Fill Capillary Tube adds a new sample type to the epoc Blood Analysis
System, which is reflected in the changes to the epoc System indications for use.
The epoc Blood Analysis System was originally cleared on 510k number k061597
with the Blood Gases (pCO2, pO2) and blood pH test system panel incorporated into
the BGE (Blood Gas & Electrolyte) Test Card. A Glucose test was subsequently
added to the epoc System on k090109. The addition of Glucose to the epoc System
also introduced the BGEM (Blood Gas, Electrolyte and Metabolite) test card, which
is currently comprised of all tests on the BGE Test Card plus Glucose.

L. Test Principle:
The Care-Fill Capillary Tube’s first function is as a sample collection device. It is
used to collect a blood sample from a skin puncture. The tube fills with a blood
sample through a combination of capillary action and gravity flow. The tube fills
readily when presented with sufficient blood and preserves the integrity of the blood
sample until it can be tested, i.e. prevents clotting and post-collection alteration of
analyte concentrations. To achieve its first function, the Care-Fill tube comprises a
Mylar-wrapped glass tube coated internally with heparin.
A Care-Fill tube’s second function is as a sample delivery device for the epoc test
card. It mates with epoc test cards in a manner similar to a syringe and requires
manual pressure to be applied to a plunger to inject blood into the test card. Just like a
syringe, pressure is applied in order to push the calibration fluid, which is present
within the card’s sample channel over the working sensors, into the waste chamber of
the card leaving the blood sample over the working sensors to be analyzed. To
achieve its second function, Care-Fill tube also comprises a plastic adapter and a
plastic air plunger and rubber seal.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The applicant performed six (6) precision studies in two (2) POC locations
having six (6) different operators testing from three (3) different pools of
blood, using Care-Fill capillary tubes, with n=10 replicates per study.
A summary of the results is presented in the table below.

The method comparison studies were performed in a field trial at a hospital on
patient samples of whole blood at the point of care in four (4) locations:
NICU, Well-baby Nursery and two (2) different outpatients drawing areas.
The testing was performed by five (5) phlebotomists in the outpatient drawing
areas, three (3) registered nurses (RN) in the Well-baby Nursery and five (5)

registered nurses in the NICU. Patient specimens were 12 adult capillary
blood samples and 36 neonatal capillary blood samples. The comparative
method was the predicate device. Results of the study were summarized

Additional studies were performed in house to demonstrate that the collection
and delivery method using Care-Fill cap tubes yields test results equivalent
with those where a syringe is used as a sample delivery method. This study
was also used as the only opportunity to test the capillary delivery over
extended ranges of the various analytes, as capillary samples are difficult to
modify.
The table below shows the results of a method comparison between the two
means of sample delivery: X-syringe and Y-Care-Fill capillary tube.
