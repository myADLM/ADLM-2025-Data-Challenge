H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc. device, D3 FastPoint L-DFA Influenza A/Influenza B
Virus Identification Kit is intended for the qualitative identification of influenza A
virus and influenza B virus in nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs and aspirates/washes
specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection by direct
detection of immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs).
It is recommended that specimens found to be negative for influenza A or influenza B
virus after examination of the direct specimen result be confirmed by cell culture.
Negative results do not preclude influenza A or influenza B virus infection and should
not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other management decisions.
Performance characteristics for influenza A virus detection and identification were
established when influenza A (H3N2) and influenza A (H1N1) were the predominant
influenza A strains circulating in the United States. Since influenza strains display
antigenic drift and shift from year to year, performance characteristics may vary. If
infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected, based on clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria communicated by public health authorities, collect
specimens following appropriate infection control precautions and submit to state or
local health departments, for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these
cases unless a BSL 3+ facility1 is available to receive and culture specimens.2
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as intended use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Fluorescence microscope with the appropriate filter combination for FITC (excitation

I. Device Description:
The D3 FastPoint L-DFA Influenza A/Influenza B Virus Identification Kit uses a
blend (called a “L-DFA Reagent”) of viral antigen-specific murine monoclonal
antibodies that are directly labeled with either R-PE (influenza A virus) or fluorescein
(influenza B virus) for the rapid identification of influenza A virus and influenza B
virus in nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs and aspirates/washes from patients with
signs and symptoms of respiratory infection.
Kit Components:
1. D3 FastPoint L-DFA Influenza A/Influenza B Reagent, 4.0-mL. One dropper
bottle containing a mixture of PE-labeled murine monoclonal antibodies directed
against influenza A virus antigens and FITC-labeled murine monoclonal antibodies
directed against influenza B virus antigens. The buffered, stabilized, aqueous solution
contains Evans Blue and propidium iodide as counter-stains and 0.1% sodium azide as
preservative.
2. 40X PBS Concentrate, 25-mL. One bottle of 40X PBS concentrate containing 4%
sodium azide (0.1% sodium azide after dilution to 1X using de-mineralized water).
3. Re-suspension Buffer, 6.0-mL. One bottle of a buffered glycerol solution and
0.1% sodium azide.
4. D3 FastPoint L-DFA Influenza A/Influenza B Antigen Control Slides, 5-slides.
Five individually packaged control slides containing 2 wells with cell culture-derived
positive and negative control cells. Each positive well contains cells infected with
either influenza A virus, or influenza B virus. The negative wells contain non-infected
cells. Each slide is intended to be stained only one time.
An overview of the procedure is as follows:
The cells to be tested are derived from respiratory specimens from patients with signs
and symptoms of respiratory infection. The cells are permeablized and stained
concurrently in a liquid suspension format with the L-DFA Reagent. After incubating
at 35ºC to 37ºC for 5 minutes, the stained cell suspensions are rinsed with PBS. The
rinsed cells are pelleted by centrifugation and then re-suspended with the re-
suspension buffer and loaded onto a specimen slide well. The cells are examined
using a fluorescence microscope. Cells infected with influenza A virus will exhibit
golden yellow fluorescence due to the PE. Cells infected with influenza B virus will
exhibit apple-green fluorescence due to the FITC. Non-infected cells will exhibit red
fluorescence due to the Evans Blue counter-stain. Nuclei of intact cells will exhibit
orange-red fluorescence due to the propidium iodide.

5 minutes, the stained cell suspensions are rinsed with PBS. The rinsed cells are pelleted
by centrifugation and then re-suspended with the re-suspension buffer and loaded onto a
specimen slide well. The cells are examined using a fluorescence microscope. Cells
infected with influenza A virus will exhibit golden yellow fluorescence due to the PE.
Cells infected with influenza B virus will exhibit apple-green fluorescence due to the
FITC. Non-infected cells will exhibit red fluorescence due to the Evans Blue counter-
stain. Nuclei of intact cells will exhibit orange-red fluorescence due to the propidium
iodide.
It is recommended that results for specimens found to contain no fluorescent cells after
examination of the direct specimen result be confirmed by cell culture.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Assay precision, intra-assay variability and inter assay variability were assessed
with a reproducibility panel of proficiency-level antigen control slides. The
reproducibility panel consisted of 5 randomized panel members.
The Influenza A/B panel consisted of the following:
a. Low level influenza A (Victoria strain) infected cells.
b. Low level influenza B (Taiwan strain) infected cells.
c. Low level influenza A (Victoria strain) infected cells mixed with
mid level influenza B (Taiwan strain) infected cells.
d. Low level influenza B (Victoria strain) infected cells mixed with
mid level influenza A (Victoria strain) infected cells.
e. Mid level non-infected (negative) cells.
The low level is estimated to contain between 4 to 10% infected cells in the
sample. The mid level is estimated to contain between 20 to 25% infected cells in
the sample. Each sample contains 2.5 x105 to 3.5 x105total cells.
The panel was tested daily in two separate runs for 5-days by four different
laboratories (40 total runs). The following results were recorded:
a. Presence or absence of golden-yellow fluorescence.
b. Percent of cells exhibiting golden-yellow fluorescence.
c. Presence or absence of apple-green fluorescence.
d. Percent of cells exhibiting apple-green fluorescence.
Note: “Processing of specimen”, although a source of variability, was done
according to each laboratory’s established practices. The product insert for this
device instructs the laboratory to process a specimen according to Clinical
Microbiology Handbook (H.D. Isenberg, 2004, publ. by ASM; sections 10.7.1-
10.7.10). As such, testing reproducibility of “processing of specimen” is beyond
6

--- Page 7 ---
the scope of this reproducibility study. This study accessed reproducibility of the
test alone, i.e., “chemistry of assay” (DFA staining) and “interpretation of result”.
“Interpretation of result” is considered to be the largest source for variability for
this test. Interpretation of test is subjective, according to potential variability in an
individual technician’s competence, experience, and/or diligence in microscopic
evaluations of stained cells.
A total of 280 data points were included in the reproducibility study data analysis
(1 panel X 7 members/run X 2 runs/day X 5 days X 4 sites = 280).
For the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Influenza A/Influenza B Reagent, the combined data
from the four Study Sites demonstrated reproducible detection of influenza A
virus by the R-PE labeled MAbs and reproducible detection of influenza B virus
by the FITC-labeled MAbs. The presence of influenza A virus infected cells was
reported in 100% (120/120) of the wells in which the infected cells were expected.
The presence of influenza B virus infected cells was reported in 100% (120/120)
of the wells in which the infected cells were expected. The absence of infected
cells was reported in 95% (38/40) of the wells in which infected cells were not
present. The total percent agreement for the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Influenza
A/Influenza B Reagent was 99.3% (278/280):

Performance Evaluation of PE-labeled MAbs
Reactivity of PE-labeled MAbs with Acetone-Fixed Infected Model Cells
(Model Cells are A549 cell cultures infected with known isolates of influenza A
virus or influenza B virus, at a high (0.1) MOI. These cultures are incubated for 20
to 22 hours at 35°C to 37°C, and then processed by scraping the monolayers and
resuspending the cells in a viral transport medium.)
An antibody may exhibit high affinity for its target antigen until labeled with a
reporter moiety such as PE due to blocking or modification of the antigen-binding
site. Each of the two influenza A virus MAbs were labeled with PE. The
individual PE-labeled MAbs were used to stain acetone-fixed influenza A virus in
order to verify that each of the MAbs remains reactive with its target after labeling
with PE. The same model cells were stained concurrently with FITC-labeled
MAbs for comparison. This comparison of the reactivity is summarized in the

Cell Permeablization and Counterstaining
Selection of Permeablization Reagent
The D3 FastPoint L-DFA Influenza A/Influenza B Virus Identification Kit uses
Sapogenin to permeablize the cell membrane instead of acetone to allow the
MAbs to react with their respective antigens. Permeablization involves treatment
of cells with a mild surfactant. This treatment will dissolve portions of the cell
membranes and allow larger dye molecules and antibodies access to the cell's
interior. This allows the cells to maintain their three dimensional structure while
being stained with labeled antibodies and counter-stain. By doing this, cells can
remain in liquid suspension. Studies were conducted to compare performance
using acetone with that using another permeablizing reagent, Sapogenin.
Sapogenins are the aglycones, or non-saccharide portions of the family of natural
products known as saponins. The amphipathic nature of saponins gives them
activity as surfactants that can be used to enhance penetration of macromolecules
such as proteins through cell membranes. Using influenza A virus and influenza B
virus and respiratory syncytial virus model cells, acetone and Sapogenin were
tested at various concentrations. Acetone was tested at concentrations from 20% to
100%. Sapogenin was used at 0.1% based on what has been published in the
literature. Data generated from the study indicated that at all acetone
concentrations Sapogenin had greater numbers of infected cells in the liquid
format. Based on these studies, Sapogenin was chosen as the Permeablization
reagent in the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Reagents.
Determination of Sapogenin Concentration
Experiments were conducted to optimize the concentration of Sapogenin in the D3
FastPoint L-DFA Influenza A/Influenza B Virus Identification Kit. Non-infected
model cells were treated with different concentrations of Sapogenin and counter-
stain for 5-minutes. The cells were then counted, and the values compared. Data
generated from the study indicated that there was no difference in numbers of cells
when Sapogenin concentrations at 0.1% to 0.025% were used. When 0.2%
Sapogenin was used, reduced numbers of cells were noted, which was an
indication that Sapogenin at that concentration may cause cell disruption. The
0.1% level was chosen to be used in the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Reagents to better
ensure adequate Permeablization of clinical nasal pharyngeal cells.
Propidium Iodide Counter-stain
10

--- Page 11 ---
To assist the end user in the use of the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Reagent Kits,
improvement to the counter-staining of cells was developed. Propidium Iodide
was added to the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Flu A/B Reagent. The stained cell’s nuclei
fluoresce red. This improves the ability to assess specimen quality compared to
standard acetone fixation, Evans Blue stained DSFA specimens. Subjective
studies were conducted to determine the optimal concentration of Propidium
Iodide. Higher concentrations of Propidium Iodide (16-μg/mL or higher) began
interfering with the ability to see low level fluorescence generated by either the
PE- or FITC-stained cells. Lower levels of Propidium Iodide (4-μg/mL or lower)
made it difficult to see the stained nuclei. 8-μg/mL was the optimal concentration
to allow easy identification of cells with no quenching of PE or FITC
fluorescence. A low level of Evans Blue (25-μg/mL compared to 250-μg/mL in
each of the predicate respiratory devices) is also included to help reduce
background of non-specific antibody staining sometimes seen in clinical
specimens.
Reagent Interference Studies of MAbs
Studies were conducted to demonstrate that the final blend of PE- and FITC-
labeled MAbs in the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Influenza A/Influenza B Reagent did
not affect the ability to detect low level positive infected cells that are stained by
one fluor when they are in the same sample, with a high level of positive infected
cells which are stained by the other fluor in the same well. The following cell
preparations were permeablized and stained with the appropriate reagent.
For the Influenza A/ Influenza B Reagent:
a. Low level (~25 or lower infected cells) infected influenza A virus model cells
were spiked into non-infected cells.
b. Low level influenza A virus model cells were spiked into high level (4 +)
influenza B virus model cells.
c. Low level (~25 or lower infected cells) infected influenza B virus model cells
were spiked into non-infected cells.
d. Low level influenza B virus model cells were spiked into high level (4+) of
influenza A virus model cells.
The following table summarizes the study data for the DFA Reagent:

For each combination of low level infected cells spiked into high level of infected
cells, there was not a significant difference in detection compared to the low level
positive cells spiked into non-infected cells (control).
Binding Competition Studies of MAbs
The Influenza A/Influenza B L-DFA Reagent contains 2 influenza A virus MAbs
and 2 influenza B virus MAbs. The purpose of combining two MAbs specific per
virus is to ensure that all strains will be detected. Studies were conducted to
determine if the individual MAbs compete with one another for the same binding
sites since originally, the clones were selected for their individual and highest
level of staining intensity of the respective virus antigens.
Model cells of influenza A virus and influenza B virus were permeablized. Cells
were stained with each unlabeled clone of the appropriate virus. The cells were
then stained with the PE- or FITC-labeled MAbs for each pair. Labeled MAbs
were used individually, each at their standard concentrations used in the assay.
Results of the initial study indicated that there was no evidence of self or cross
epitope blocking for all the pairs of MAbs, except for the two influenza A MAbs.
The two influenza A MAbs were labeled with FITC and tested using the same
protocol. The MAbs again blocked each other. This suggested that the blocking is
unrelated to the labeling chemistry. The testing was repeated using acetone
fixation of the model cells in place of the permeablization. The MAbs again
blocked each other. This suggested that the blocking is unrelated to the fixation
chemistry.
For the influenza A virus MAbs, blocking of the epitopes is strain dependant.
Even though these clones appear to bind to the same epitope for influenza A virus
using the H3N2 virus strain, they are still used because of an “additive” effect on
the brightness of fluorescent cells, i.e. doubling the concentration of one clone and
using it alone is not as bright as using the two clones with the same final
concentration.
Stability Studies
Shelf life for the complete kit
Kits were tested at time intervals during storage according to the study plan.
Characteristics monitored were performance, as well as pH, color and clarity.
Among the acceptance criteria was fluorescence (as opposed to no fluorescence)
observed in processed, infected model cells at a high level of infection (2+ to 4+)
for the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Influenza A/Influenza B Reagent at 1:16 dilution.
Stability studies have been conducted in two phases: (1) using kits produced
during the development phase according to draft written procedures, and (2) using
kits produced according to established procedures by manufacturing staff (both
phases are on-going). To establish the final shelf life of the device, real-time
12

--- Page 13 ---
testing (under labeled storage conditions of 2°C to 8°C) is also being conducted.
As of August 2009, stability has been demonstrated to 9 months. Additional
stability studies are currently being conducted to establish a 20°C to 25°C storage
shelf-life claim for the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Influenza A/Influenza B Reagent.
Shelf life for the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Influenza A/Influenza B Kit antigen
control slides
The D3 FastPoint L-DFA Influenza A/Influenza B Virus Identification Kit Antigen
Control Slides are prepared by combining infected cells (influenza A virus and
influenza B virus in one well). Non-infected cells are spotted onto an additional
well for a negative control for the reagent. Stability studies are currently being
conducted for the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Flu A/B Identification Kit Antigen Control
Slides; however, since they are prepared using the same procedure and same
infected cell cultures as the control slides in the D3Ultra Kit, a shelf life of 18
months is anticipated. Stability studies have been conducted in two phases: (1)
using slides produced during the development phase according to draft written
procedures, and (2) using slides produced according to established procedures by
manufacturing staff (both phases are on-going). To establish shelf life of the
device, real-time testing (under labeled storage conditions of 2°C to 8°C) is also
being conducted. As of August 2009, stability has been demonstrated to 9 months.
d. Analytical Sensitivity (Detection limit):
Analytical Limit of Detections of the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Flu A/B Reagent Kit
was addressed using dilution series of infected model cells. Model cells for
influenza A virus (ATCC Victoria strain) and influenza B virus (ATCC Taiwan
strain) were diluted with non-infected cells to produce a suspension equivalent to
1,000 infected cells per milliliter. This level theoretically yields approximately 25
infected cells per 25-μL of suspension. This suspension was then serially diluted
to a theoretical level of less than 1 cell per milliliter. (NOTE: This level was the
target to begin with a low positive level. Actual starting levels vary, however, and
are within 1 dilution of the 25 infected cells target level). 25-µL aliquots from
each dilution level were spotted onto 10 replicate microscope slides, and then
stained according to the instructions for use described in the product insert. Each
cell spot was examined at 200x magnification. Results were reported as numbers
of positive replicates for each set of 10. Analytical detection limits for each of the
2 analytes were defined as the lowest dilutions at which at least 9 out of 10
replicates were detected. Results are summarized in the table below:

*Although the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Influenza A/Influenza B Reagent has been
shown to detect the 2009 H1N1 virus in two culture isolates provided by the CDC,
and well-characterized by the CDC rRT-PCR Swine Flu Detection Panel (under
an EUA), the performance characteristics of this device with clinical specimens
that are positive for the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus have not been established. The
D3 FastPoint L-DFA Influenza A/Influenza B Reagent can distinguish between
influenza A and B viruses, but it can not differentiate influenza subtypes.
f. Analytical Specificity:
D3 FastPoint L-DFA Influenza A/Influenza B Virus Identification Kit was
tested for cross-reactivity against a variety of microorganisms. Stringent
conditions for cross-reactivity testing were achieved by using both the 1.5 X
concentration of MAbs and relatively high titers of microorganisms. No cross-
reactivity was observed for 59 virus strains. Twenty-two (22) bacterial strains,
one yeast, and one Chlamydia sp. were also evaluated for cross-reactivity,
including Staphylococcus aureus, a protein-A-producing bacterium. Except
for Staphylococcus aureus, which was cross reactive with the D3 FastPoint L-
DFA Influenza A/Influenza B Virus Identification Kit, all other
microorganisms tested negative.
Staining of S. aureus appeared as small points of fluorescence. The Protein A
produced by the bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus, may bind the Fc portion of
some fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibodies. Such binding can be
distinguished from viral antigen binding on the basis of morphology, i.e., S.
aureus-bound fluorescence appears as small (~1-micron diameter), bright dots.
Results from testing direct respiratory specimens with bacterial contamination
must be interpreted with caution. The following language was added to the
“Limitations of Procedure” section of the product insert to address this issue:
“Light background staining may occur with specimens contaminated with
Staphylococcus aureus strains containing large amounts of protein A.
Protein A will bind to the Fc portions of conjugated antibodies. Such
binding can be distinguished from viral antigen binding on the basis of
morphology, for example, S. aureus-bound fluorescence appears as small
(~1 micron diameter), bright dots. Therefore, results from testing direct
respiratory specimens with bacterial contamination must be interpreted
with caution.”

• Fifty-nine (59) virus strains were tested for cross reactivity.
Depending on the particular virus, 1.4 x 104 to 1.4 x 105 TCID viruses
50
were inoculated into multi-well plate cultures and incubated for 24 to
72 hours to yield a 1+ to 4+ cytopathic effect. For each virus, a
confirmation stain was done with the appropriate MAb to ensure the
desired titer was achieved. These cells were then prepared as Model
Cells (scraped and resuspended in UTM). Each cell suspension of
infected Model Cells was processed according to the D3 FastPoint L-
DFA Influenza A/Influenza B Virus Identification Kit protocol, using
2X MAb and was examined at 200X magnification. No cross reactivity

• Twenty four (24) microorganisms, including 22 bacterial, 1 yeast, and
1 Chlamydia sp. were tested for cross-reactivity. Bacteria were
cultured, processed as suspensions, then spiked into non-infected
Model Cells suspensions at levels (as CFUs, colony-forming units)
ranging from 1.6 x 109 to 3.5 x 1010 CFUs depending on the bacterium.
These suspensions of Model Cells with bacteria were then processed
according to the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Influenza A/Influenza B Virus
Identification Kit protocol, using 2X MAb reagents. Except for
Staphylococcus aureus, which was cross reactive with the D3 FastPoint
L-DFA Influenza A/Influenza B Virus Identification Kit, all other
microorganisms tested negative. Reactivity with Staphylococcus
aureus is more than likely due to binding the protein A produced by
Staphylococcus aureus. Microorganisms tested are listed in the table

3. Clinical studies:
a. Prospective Clinical Studies Testing Direct Respiratory Specimens
Performance of the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Influenza A/Influenza B Virus
Identification Kit testing direct respiratory specimens were established during
prospective studies at 4 geographically diverse U.S. clinical laboratories during the
2008/2009 respiratory virus seasons (January 2008 – March 2009). All specimens
used in the studies meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria represented excess,
remnants of respiratory specimens that were prospectively collected from
symptomatic individuals suspected of respiratory infection, and were submitted for
routine care or analysis by each site, and that otherwise would have been discarded.
Individual specimens were delinked from all patient identifiers and given a study
sample code. All clinical sites were granted waivers of informed consent by their
IRBs for this study.
Performance of the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Influenza A/Influenza B Virus
Identification Kit detecting influenza A and influenza B from direct specimens was
assessed and compared to DSFA testing using FDA cleared comparator DSFA
devices (D3Ultra DFA Respiratory Virus Screening & ID Kit or D3Duet DFA
RSV/Respiratory Virus Screening Kit), followed by viral culture confirmation of all
negative specimens (as determined by the FDA cleared DSFA comparator devices),
using FDA cleared DFA reagents.
Study Site 1 evaluated a total of 323 fresh respiratory specimens submitted, January
2009 through March 2009, to the laboratory for respiratory virus testing. Slides were
prepared from Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)-washed cells from the fresh
specimens and processed according to the prescribed protocol. The slides were
stained in accordance with the procedure in the product insert.

Of the 323 fresh respiratory specimens tested, all were nasal wash/nasopharyngeal
aspirate specimens. Of the 323 fresh nasal wash/nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens
tested, 2 nasal wash/nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens were excluded from the
performance analysis due to insufficient sample volume for the investigational
device testing (0.62%). 70 specimens for Flu A and 79 specimens for Flu B were
excluded from the respective performance analysis due to insufficient sample
volume for the comparator culture method, resulting in a total of 251 fresh nasal
wash/nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens for Flu A and 242 fresh nasal

Of the 648 fresh respiratory specimens tested, all were nasal/nasopharyngeal swab
specimens. Three (3) nasal/nasopharyngeal swab specimens were excluded from the
performance analysis due to insufficient sample volume for both the investigational
device and the comparator DSFA device testing (0.46%). One (1) additional
nasal/nasopharyngeal swab specimen was excluded from the performance analysis
due to insufficient sample volume for the investigational device testing (0.15%). One
(1) nasal/nasopharyngeal swab specimen was also excluded from the performance
analysis due to un-interpretable result generated by the investigational device because
of high background. 93 samples for Flu A and 72 samples for Flu B were excluded
from the respective performance analysis due to insufficient sample volume for the
comparator culture method, resulting in a total of 549 fresh nasal
wash/nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens for Flu A, 570 fresh nasal

In the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Influenza A/Influenza B Virus Identification Kit
multicenter prospective clinical study testing direct respiratory specimens, a total
of 1519 eligible respiratory specimens were tested using the D3 FastPoint L-DFA
Influenza A/Influenza B Virus Identification Kit from four U.S. clinical
laboratories across the United States during the 2008/2009 respiratory virus
seasons (January 2008 – March 2009). Prevalence for each analyte (i.e., Flu A
and Flu B) as determined by the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Influenza A/Influenza B
Virus Identification Kit direct specimen testing varied from 7.1% to 8.8% by site
and averaged 7.6% for Flu A; varied from 0.6% to 31.2% by site and averaged
14.0% for Flu B. The number and percentage of positive cases determined by the
D3 FastPoint L-DFA Influenza A/Influenza B Virus Identification Kit direct
specimen testing, calculated by age group, are presented in the following tables:
