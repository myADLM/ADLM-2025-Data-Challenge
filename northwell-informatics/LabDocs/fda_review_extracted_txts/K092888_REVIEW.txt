To verify the reportable range of the Elecsys 2010, MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 or cobas
e analyzers using Elecsys Toxo IgG CalCheck 5, a dilution study was performed using the
Elecsys Toxo IgG CalCheck Levels 1 and 5.
Dilution Study
CalCheck 1,CalCheck 2, CalCheck 4 and CalCheck 5 were mixed in a 1:1 ratio and measured
in two-fold determination. The average was then calculated. The predetermined specification
was that the diluted value had to fall within the measuring range.
Results showed that CalCheck dilution values were within the assay‘s measuring range after
dilution, as follows:
Value after 1:1 Average 1:1
Dilution [IU/mL] Dilution [IU/mL]
Sample
CalCheck 1 + CalCheck 2 1.72
1.68
CalCheck 1 + CalCheck 2 1.64
CalCheck 4 + CalCheck 5 545
527.5
CalCheck 4 + CalCheck 5 510
Both CalCheck dilution values are within the assay‘s measuring range after dilution.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods)
The Elecsys Toxo IgG CalCheck is standardized against the same master calibration curve as
the calibrators used for the Elecsys Toxo IgG test system (Elecsys Toxo IgG Reagent and
Calibrators, k073501). Serum/plasma comparisons performed demonstrate equivalency of the
specimen types. Please refer to pages 62-71 of the original Elecsys Toxo IgG Test System
submission, K073501, for this information.
Analyte Value Assignment
Values for Toxo IgG CalCheck 5 were calibrated against the WHO anti-Toxoplasma
serum (TOXM), 3rd International Standard for T. gondii from the National Institute for
Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC), UK. Values are assigned using a minimum
of four Elecsys 2010/ cobas e 411 analyzers and four MODULAR ANALYTICS E170/
cobas e601 analyzers. Two independent series of analyses are performed for each
instrument. The target value of each CalCheck is the median over 6 -8 series (i.e., 0.175 -
650 IU/mL) of the respective CalCheck.
Stability
Open Vial Stability and Accelerated stability studies were performed in order to verify
the stability claims for the Elecsys Toxo IgG CalCheck 5. The data was generated using
Toxo IgG master calibrators, which have the same composition and target values as Toxo
IgG CalCheck 5.
Open Vial Stability:
The Elecsys Toxo IgG CalCheck 5 test material and reference material were tested in
duplicate. The test material was reconstituted and stored for 5 hours at 25ºC (in an

open vial). The reference material was a freshly reconstituted set of Elecsys Toxo IgG
CalCheck 5. The recovery was calculated as a percent of the reference value.
The acceptance criterion is recovery of 90-110% of the reference material value.

The data support the package insert claims that reconstituted Elecsys Toxo IgG
CalCheck 5 is stable up to 4 hours at 20-25°C.
Accelerated Stability
The Elecsys Toxi IgG CalCheck 5 test material was stored at 35°C for 3 weeks. The
reference material was a freshly reconstituted set of CalChecks stored at 2-8°C. After
3 weeks, the test and reference materials were tested in duplicate. The recovery was
calculated as a percent of the reference value. The acceptance criterion was recovery
of 90-110% of the reference material value.

e. Analytical specificity:
Not applicable.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-off was determined using master calibrators for the assay that has values
assigned that are traceable to the World Health Organizations (WHO) standards. The sponsor
used the WHO anti-Toxoplasma serum (TOXM), 3rd International Standard for T. gondii
from NIBSC, UK. Two independent series of analyzes were performed on the Elecsys 2010,
cobas e 411, and the MODULAR ANALYTICS E170/ cobas e601 analyzers. The samples
were run in duplicate and the target values were calculated as the median of the determined
values. This fulfils the requirements of demonstrating a target values for the Toxo IgG
CalCheck levels calibrators.
