L. Test Principle:
The SMART HbAlc test is an enzymatic assay in which lysed whole blood samples are
subjected to extensive protease digestion with Bacillus sp protease. This process releases
amino acids including glycated valines from the hemoglobin beta chains. Glycated valines
then serve as substrates for specific recombinant fructosyl valine oxidase (FVO) enzyme,
produced in E. coli. The recombinant FVO specifically cleaves N-terminal valines and
produces hydrogen peroxide. This, in turn, is measured using a horseradish peroxidase
(POD) catalyzed reaction and a suitable chromagen. The HbAlc concentration is expressed
directly as %HbAlc by use of a lot-specific calibration curve that is stored in an RFID card
provided with each SMART test kit.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the SMART HbA1c Assay was evaluated according to the CLSI
Guideline EP5-A: Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement
Methods with modifications. In the study (performed internally), two whole blood
specimens containing 5.6% and 7.4% HbA1c and one whole blood HbA1c control
containing 11.5% HbA1c were tested during 2 runs per day and with two replicates
per run over 10 working days. Reagent Lot 1 was used over the first 5 days and
Reagent Lot 2 was used over the remaining 5 days. Both lots of reagents were used
on three different SMART analyzers.

The precision of the Diazyme SMART HbA1c assay was also evaluated in three
physician office laboratories (POL) by nurses and assistants to test systemic and
random error on three different SMART HbA1c AssayHbA1c analyzers. Two
unaltered EDTA whole blood HbA1c specimens containing 5.4%, 7.7% HbA1c and
one whole blood HbA1c control containing 11.5% HbA1c were used. At each POL
site, the samples were run in duplicates in two runs per day over 5 days (Sites 1 and 2
used two SMART analyzers; Site 3 used one analyzer). One lot of assay reagents was
used at all three sites.

• Lot-to-lot variation
A panel of 10 blood samples with HbA1c values spanning 5.2 – 11.3% was used in
addition to SMART HbA1c Control Set level 1 and Control Set level 2 for lot-to-lot
variation study. The blood samples and controls were analyzed in duplicates using
three lots of the SMART HbA1c Assay reagents on one single SMART analyzer.
During the study, CVs ranged from 1.1-4.3% indicating lot-to-lot consistency.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Five samples used to obtain linearity data were prepared by dilution of two whole
blood samples, DZ Linearity Level 1 and Level 2 with known HbA1c contents of
4.25% and 12.1% respectively. The linearity set was made according to CLSI
Guideline EP6-A: Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement
Procedures: A Statistical Approach and each sample run in duplicate. One reagent
lot and one analyzer were used.
The results of analysis of the data by linear regression are:
R2 = 0.9947, slope = 1.0113, and y-intercept = -0.2981.
The claimed measuring range is 4 – 12% HbA1c for the SMART HbA1c assay.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The SMART HbA1c assay has met the requirements of the National
Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP). The NGSP certification requires
annual renewal. The current list of NGSP certified methods is available on the NGSP
website at: http://www.ngsp.org/prog/index.html

specific calibration curve and is supplied in each kit. When RFID card is inserted
into SMART analyzer slot (assay procedure step), the lot specific calibration curve is
automatically utilized for assay test. RFID cards are programmed at manufacturer
site. The assay lot specific calibration curve is generated by experimental data
generation using human whole blood calibrator set traced to reference calibrators.
RFID calibration curve generation is described in the following steps.
1) Two level human whole blood hemolysates are tested with the Tosoh G7 HPLC
method to determine initial %HbA1c values. The Tosoh G7 HbA1c HPLC method is
certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP,
University of Missouri School of Medicine).
2) Lot specific SMART HbA1c assay reagents are used with the bi-level calibration
material, to test > 30 fresh human whole blood samples and quality control materials.
The human whole blood samples are previously tested with the Tosoh’s G7 HbA1c
HPLC method and other assay methods. Three different instruments are used in the
analysis.
3) Calibrator values are adjusted to meet the acceptance criteria and final calibration
curve with a point-to-point least squares fit equation. Calibration curve values
representing change in absorbance slope versus HbA1c% levels are programmed into
cards with the use of a card writer. RFID cards are subject to the same quality
system checks as reagents and controls. Values are given in NGSP/DCCT value
system. The IFCC values corresponding to NGSP/DCCT values of samples can be
determined by use of published conversion formula: NGSP = 0.915 × (IFCC) +2.15
SMART HbA1c Control set
The controls are made of human whole blood and are in a lyophilized (freeze-dried)
state. The control set are value assigned as follows.
1) Two level human whole blood hemolysates are tested with the Tosoh G7 HPLC
method to determine initial %HbA1c values. The Tosoh G7 HbA1c HPLC method is
certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP,
University of Missouri School of Medicine).
2) With a reference lot of SMART HbA1c Assay Reagent Kits, the bi-level control
material (target ranges are 5.5 – 6.5% for the low control and 7.5 - 9.5% for the high
control) is then subjected to extensive replicate analysis using one SMART analyzer
to obtain mean values and a range. Range criteria: Deviation from the target value of
< 20% for control level 1 (normal) and control level 2 (high). Values are given in
NGSP/DCCT value system. The IFCC values corresponding to NGSP/DCCT values
of samples can be determined by use of published conversion formula: NGSP = 0.915
× (IFCC) + 2.15
Stability
Real time stability studies have been conducted. Protocols and acceptance criteria
were described and found to be acceptable. When stored unopened at 2-80C, the
7

--- Page 8 ---
SMART HbA1c assay kit is valid for 6 months and the SMART HbA1c control set is
valid for 12 months. Reconstituted controls are stable for 14 days when capped
tightly and stored at 2-8˚C.
d. Detection limit:
To establish the limit of detection for the SMART assay, a modified protocol was
used. The SMART HbA1c Assay measures HbA1c normalized to hemoglobin and
the reagents are comprised of redox balanced agents. Sample dilution with water or
saline is not acceptable. Therefore, additional simple precision studies were
conducted at the lower end of the measuring range (4-12%). In one experiment, a
whole blood sample containing 6% HbA1c was diluted by half with redox balanced
buffer to 3% HbA1c and tested on SMART analyzer in 12 replicates.
The limit of detection is calculated to be the mean + 3SD = 3.92% HbA1c which is
below the measuring range (4-12%). Samples below the measuring range are
reported as <4% by the SMART Analyzer.
To further verify the precision of the SMART HbA1c Assay at the lower end of the
measuring range, a blood sample containing 4% HbA1c was tested on SMART
analyzer in 10 replicates in a simple precision test.
Mean 4.02
SD 0.18
CV 4.51%
e. Analytical specificity:
To determine the level of interference from the substances normally present in whole
blood, SMART HbA1c Assay was used to test 5.5% and 11.0% HbA1C whole blood
samples spiked with various concentrations of substances following CLSI Guideline
EP7-A: Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry dose-response guidelines.
The following substances normally present in the blood produced less than 10%
deviation when tested at levels equal to the concentrations listed below:
Interference Concentration
Ascorbic Acid 30 mg/dL
Bilirubin 15 mg/dL
Bilirubin Conjugate 5 mg/dL

In order to evaluate whether SMART HbA1c Assay is interfered by Hemoglobin AD,
AE, AS, AC, and AF variants, samples with hemoglobin variants (AD, AE, AS, AC,
AF) were obtained from an NGSP reference lab. Expected HbA1c values for these
samples were obtained by standard reference methods known to yield true %HbA1c
values that are unaffected by the variant. Samples were run in duplicate with the

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Non-diabetic individuals have HbA1c values in the range of 4-6% using a DCCT based
assay.1 The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that the primary
treatment goal in diabetes should be glycemic control equal to that achieved during the
DCCT.1 ADA states that lowering HbA1c to below or around 7% has been shown to
reduce microvascular and neuropathic complications of type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

Therefore, for microvascular disease prevention, the HbA1c goal for nonpregnant adults
in general is <7% HbA1c.1 However, each laboratory must establish its own normal
range in their country of business taking into account sex, age and ethnicity. ADA
recommends that glycemic control goals should be individualized based on duration of
diabetes, age/life expectancy, comorbid conditions, known CVD or advanced
microvascular complications, hypoglycemia unawareness and individual patient
considerations.1

N. Instrument Name:
SMART Analyzer
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Smart Analyzer is operated exclusively using the Touch Display. All steps necessary
for operation are displayed as symbols. To activate the symbols they have to be touched
with the fingers or finger nail.
To process a test, insert the provided RFID card into the analyzer. This card contains all
data necessary to perform the routine tests. No measurement can be started without the
RFID test card.
The DRS (Diazyme Reagent System) cartridge is inserted in the door that opens
automatically upon touch screen input. After input of all requested data and activating the
START button on the Touch Display, the lid is automatically closed, and the testing
procedure is started. The closed door avoids the intrusion of ambient light, dust, dirt and
humidity in the laboratory photometer while the instrument is measuring and when it is
not in use.
The analyzing process is fully automated after inserting the cartridge into the analyzer;
the process starts by closing the analyzer door. Only one cartridge can be run at a time.
Once inside the analyzer, the sample and reagent are mixed automatically. As the
reaction starts, changes in absorbance are measured at the correct wavelength and
referenced to the calibration data preprogrammed in the RFID card. All assay and lot
specific information necessary for the analyzer to process a test is read from the RFID
card.
After the measurement is completed, the door opens automatically, and the test cartridge
can now be removed. All SMART HbA1c DRS test cartridge are single use and are
designed to be disposed after use.

3. Specimen Identification:
Samples are identified by manually labeling and by logging the patient ID into the
analyzer prior to inserting the cartridge into the analyzer, or during the analyzing process.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
A specimen in a single use capped DRS cuvette is inserted into the analyzer and read by
the spectrophotometer with no liquid/specimen carryover within the analyzer. Once
sample is read, cuvette is removed from the analyzer and disposed of.
5. Calibration:
Calibration Radio Frequency Identification Card (RFID card)
SMART HbA1c Assay utilizes a RFID card that is preprogrammed with a reagent lot
specific calibration curve and is supplied in each kit. When RFID card is inserted into
SMART analyzer slot (assay procedure step), the lot specific calibration curve is
automatically utilized for assay test. RFID cards are programmed at manufacturer site.
The assay lot specific calibration curve is generated by experimental data generation
using human whole blood calibrator set
6. Quality Control:
The user should perform quality control testing to confirm that the SMART HbA1c
Analyzer System is working properly and providing reliable results using the SMART
HbA1c control set. Additionally, the instrument contains internal checks for detecting
electronic, mechanical, and sample problems.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
