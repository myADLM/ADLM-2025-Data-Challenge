a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the
device and its components, and the results of the analysis
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities required,
including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied
c) A declaration of conformity with design controls. The declaration of conformity should include:
i) A statement signed by the individual responsible, that, as required by the risk analysis, all
verification and validation activities were performed by the designated individual(s) and the
results demonstrated that the predetermined acceptance criteria were met, and
ii) A statement signed by the individual responsible, that the manufacturing facility is in
conformance with design control procedure requirements as specified in 21 CFR 820.30 and
the records are available for review.
The design control activities performed
Vancomycin, on MicroScan® Synergies plus™ Gram-Positive Panels, was evaluated and
cleared (K060312) with three read methods Rapid (WalkAway® SI, <16 hours), Overnight
Instrument (WalkAway® SI, 16/18 hours) and Overnight Manual (manual/visual read, 16-20
hours), by comparing Dried panel performance with frozen Reference Panels using stock and
fresh isolates (Efficacy phase), challenge strains (Challenge phase), and QC strains (QC
testing). Challenge strains were compared to Expected Results determined prior to the
evaluation.
Data collected from the external validation of vancomycin (K060312) was processed using the
modified S. aureus interpretive criteria (S ≤ 2, I = 4 -8, R ≥ 16). The Microdilution Inhibitory
Concentration (MIC) interpretive standards for vancomycin were modified by the Clinical
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) in January 2006. Reference CLSI Document M100 – S16
(Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing; Sixteenth Informational
Supplement). These revised interpretive criteria were approved by the FDA for drug
manufacturer, Baxter Healthcare, Inc., in April of 2008.
The gram-positive Vancomycin Efficacy phase was conducted with a total of five hundred and
forty nine (549) isolates, including seventy three (73) stock and four hundred and seventy six
(476) fresh clinical isolates. The Challenge phase was conducted with 78 challenge isolates. The
combined Rapid Read results, from the Efficacy and Challenge studies, demonstrated overall
Essential Agreement of 97.6% (565/579) and Categorical Agreement of 97.9% (567/579) when
processed using the modified S. aureus interpretive criteria (S ≤ 2, I = 4 -8, R ≥ 16).
Below is a summary of the performance of S. aureus with the new interpretive criteria using the
different read methods

NOTE: Efficacy and Challenge total for the Rapid Instrument Read Method equaled 579 isolates. Results
for 42 Efficacy isolates and 6 Challenge isolates were not reported due to read times ≥16 hours. The 3
VRSA isolates are included in the Combined Efficacy and Challenge data.

There were more minor errors observed with the new interpretive criteria for S. aureus, specifically, there
were 2 minor errors with the Rapid read method(<16 hours), 3 minor errors with the dried overnight
instrument method, and 2 minor errors with the dried overnight manual method. However, the number of
minor errors is within the acceptable limits as recommended in the Class II Special Controls Guidance
Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems. There were no minor errors observed with
S. aureus using the old interpretive criteria. The number of major errors did not change when either the
old or new interpretive criteria were used with all read methods. Considering the EA and CA of >97%, the
overall performance of S. aureus with the new interpretive criteria is acceptable.

6. A Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary or Statement and the Indications for
Use Enclosure (and Class III Summary for Class III devices).
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use
for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular
modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices
demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the
design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the
device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared (or their preamendment) device.
