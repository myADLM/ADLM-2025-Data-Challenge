L. Test Principle:
The STA® - Hybrid Hep Calibrator is designed to operate utilizing the STA® product
line of IVD coagulation analyzers for the purpose of creating calibration curves for
assays of heparin by measuring the anti-Xa activity based on a chromogenic method.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Two samples containing different levels of heparin were tested using two
different lots of STA® - Hybrid Hep Calibrator for the calibration. Each
sample was tested for 22 operating days in two different laboratories. During
each of the testing days, two separate runs were performed with alternatively
two lots of STA® - Rotachrom® Heparin kit, on two analyzers, by a minimum
of two operators.
Precision was estimated separately for each sample using the five components
of precision described by the CLSI guidance: repeatability, between-run
precision, within-day precision, between-day precision and within-laboratory
precision (see results in tables 1-3 provided below).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The entire range claimed for the assay kit is 0.1 to 2.0 IU/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The UFH levels are determined against the 97/578 International
Standard for UFH established in 1998. The LMWH levels are determined
against the 01/608 International Standard for LMWH established in 2003.
Stability: Closed vial: In the lyophilized state the STA® - Hybrid Hep
Calibrator plasmas remain stable until the expiration date printed on the box
when stored at 2-8°C. This corresponds to 24 months after the date of
manufacture.
Open vial: After reconstitution with distilled water, STA® - Hybrid Hep
Calibrator reagents are stable for 4 hours on board the STA Satellite®
(k082248), STA Compact® (k961579) and STA-R® (k983460) analyzers.
The acceptance criteria for the 5 calibrator reagents are as follows:
Reagent 1: ≤0.10 IU/mL
Reagent 2: 0.20 – 0.35 IU/mL
Reagent 1: 0.40 – 0.60 IU/mL
Reagent 1: 0.70 - 1.10 anti-Xa IU/mL
Reagent 1: 1.60 – 2.00 anti-Xa IU/mL
Calibrator Value Assignment:
For each level of calibrator the heparin (UFH or LMWH) value corresponds to the
mean of a minimum of four determinations performed with four instruments,
using at least two (2) different lots of STA®-Rotachrom® Heparin (K010455). The
determinations are carried out by a minimum of two (2) laboratory technicians.
The assay calibration is carried out with a pool of plasmas supplemented with the
International standard for UFH or LMWH and/or other lots of STA® - Hybrid
Hep Calibrator.
