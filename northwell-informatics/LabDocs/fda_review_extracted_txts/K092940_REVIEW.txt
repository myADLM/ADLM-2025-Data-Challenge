I. Device Description:
The CoaguChek® XS Plus for Patient Self-Testing is a portable coagulation monitoring
system to monitor prothrombin time (PT) in patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy.
The system uses the amperometric detection of thrombin in the blood sample. A test strip is
used to determine a PT value from 10µL of whole blood. The system features onboard
quality control on every test strip as well as optional external quality control material.
The test strip incorporates quality control material that assesses strip integrity. The system
also features a QC lockout feature which prevents the operator from performing a test if the
QC results fail.

Hardware No handheld base unit Handheld base unit
K. Standard/Guidance Document referenced (if applicable):
None
L. Test Principle:
When a blood sample is applied to the test strip, thromboplastin activates the coagulation
cascade which leads to the formation of thrombin. Thrombin cleaves the thrombin substrate
creating an electrochemically active peptide, which generates an electrical signal. The signal
is converted to an INR value and displayed by the CoaguChek XS System.
The on-board quality control is a bi-level control that assesses test strip integrity. The
prothrombin time (PT) test and quality control (QC) testing are performed simultaneously.
The test system determines whether the quality control is within preset limits. If it is, the
meter displays a short term “QC(cid:51)”, and then the PT test result. If the QC is not within
limits, the meter displays “error QC”, and no PT test result will be displayed.

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
At each study site, enrolled patients and the healthcare professionals performed
duplicate measurements. The precision of duplicates was calculated for both the
subjects and healthcare professionals, and the data presented by site as well as
overall. The acceptance criterion was set as ≤ 10% INR mean bias between the
patients and healthcare professional. Mean bias was calculated using the first patient
and the first healthcare professional result. All visits met the acceptance criteria.

When compared to the lab reference:
Venous - N=811, y = 1.090X – 0.2, r = 0.974
Capillary – N = 822, y = 1.075X – 0.1, r = 0.972

3. Clinical studies:
A three site user study was conducted comparing test results obtained by trained users
with those obtained by healthcare professionals. Both groups used the CoaguChek XS
Plus System. Following face-to-face training, 103 subjects were sent home to self-test,
for up to 8 weeks. Three study site visits were scheduled to collect user vs technician
data. Regression analysis was performed for visits 2, 3, 4, and overall. Results
demonstrated acceptable correlation.

interface and to configure the device, storage of patient results, transfer of measurement
results using serial infrared communication in an open mode, transfer of production and
calibration results using serial infrared communication in a protected mode, reading and
storage of specific information for strip LOT from code key, calculation of PT time based

malfunctions of the measurement electronics or malfunctions within the strip used for
testing.
The applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this device
were reviewed under K060978.
Yes ___(cid:51)__ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Date and time of testing along with patient identifier information is recorded by the
CoaguChek XS meter.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Whole blood is manually applied to the target area of the test strip either from the top or
side of the strip.
5. Calibration:
The CoaguChek XS Test strips are calibrated to a master reagent lot which has in turn

been calibrated to a WHO International Reference Preparations (rTF/95) using the
manual tilt tube method.
6. Quality Control:
The CoaguChek XS System incorporates a bi-level on-board quality control (OBC)
within the CoaguChek XS test strip that monitors test strip integrity. Level 1 OBC
detects strip defects such as reagent defects, capillary compression and electrode defects.
Level 2 OBC directly measures strip damage due to such things as exposure to increased
humidity, light, and temperature.
The pre-determined OBC ranges are programmed into the lot specific code chip that is
packaged with the matching test strip lot.
Acceptable data was presented validating the OBC.

Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
