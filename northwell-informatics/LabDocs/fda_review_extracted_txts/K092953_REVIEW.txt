H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Cepheid Xpert® vanA Assay performed in the GeneXpert® Dx System is a
qualitative in vitro diagnostic test designed for rapid detection of the vanA gene sequence
associated with vancomycin resistance in bacteria obtained from rectal swab specimens
from patients at risk for intestinal colonization with vancomycin-resistant bacteria. The
test utilizes automated real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the vanA gene
that is frequently associated with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). The Xpert
vanA Assay is intended to aid in the recognition, prevention, and control of vancomycin
resistant organisms that colonize patients in healthcare settings. The Xpert vanA Assay is
not intended to diagnose infections caused by vancomycin-resistant bacteria nor to guide
or monitor treatment for vancomycin-resistant bacterial infections. Concomitant cultures
are necessary to recover organisms for confirmatory identification of vancomycin-
resistant bacteria, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and for epidemiological typing.

I. Device Description:
The Cepheid Xpert vanA Assay is a rapid, automated in vitro diagnostic test for qualitative
detection of the vanA gene sequence associated with vancomycin resistance in bacteria
obtained directly from rectal swab specimens. The Xpert vanA Assay system performs real-

--- Page 3 ---
time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of DNA after an initial sample
processing step. The assay is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert® Dx System.
The specimen is collected on a double swab, one of which is placed in a tube containing
elution reagent. Following brief vortexing, the eluted material and two single-use reagents
(Reagent 1 and Reagent 2) that are provided with the assay are transferred to different,
uniquely-labeled chambers of the disposable fluidic cartridge (the Xpert vanA cartridge). The
user initiates a test from the system user interface and places the cartridge into the
GeneXpert® Dx System instrument platform, which performs hands-off realtime, multiplex
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of DNA. In this platform, additional sample
preparation, amplification, and real-time detection are all fully automated and completely
integrated.
The GeneXpert® System consists of a GeneXpert instrument, personal computer, and the
multi-chambered fluidic cartridges that are designed to complete sample preparation and
real-time PCR for detection of the vanA gene that is associated with vancomycin-resistant
enterococci (VRE) in less than 45 minutes. Each instrument system has 1 to 16 randomly
accessible modules that are each capable of performing separate sample preparation and
real-time PCR tests. Each module contains a syringe drive for dispensing fluids, an ultrasonic
horn for lysing cells or spores, and a proprietary I-CORE® thermocycler for performing real-
time PCR and detection.
The Xpert vanA Assay includes reagents for the detection of the vanA resistant gene as well
as an internal sample processing control (SPC) to control for adequate processing of the
target bacteria and to monitor the presence of inhibitor(s) in the PCR assay. The SPC also
ensures the PCR conditions (temperature and time) are appropriate for the amplification
reaction and that the PCR reagents are functional. The Probe Check Control (PCC) verifies
reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe integrity, and dye stability.

L. Test Principle:
The primers and probes in the Xpert vanA Assay detect the presence of unique sequences for
vanA resistance gene. Rectal swabs are collected and transported to the GeneXpert® System
area. The swab is placed in a tube containing 1.7 mL Sample Reagent. Following a brief
vortex, the eluted material and two other liquid reagents are transferred to different chambers
of the cartridge. The user initiates a test from the system user interface, the instrument signals
the user where to place the cartridge by flashing a green light, and the cartridge is placed into
the indicated module in the GeneXpert® Dx System instrument. The instrument moves the
sample and reagents to and from different chambers within the Xpert vanA Assay cartridge.
The GeneXpert® Dx System performs sample preparation by mixing the eluted sample with
the Sample Preparation Control (Bacillus globigii in the form of a dry spore cake within the
cartridge, is used as the SPC) and treatment reagents, capturing the bacterial cells on a filter,
lysing the cells using glass beads and an ultrasonic horn, then eluting the released DNA. The
DNA solution is then mixed with dry PCR reagents and transferred into the PCR tube for
real-time PCR and detection. The Xpert vanA Assay completes sample preparation and real-
time PCR in less than 45 minutes. Internal controls in Xpert vanA Assay check key
automated steps.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility study was performed using a panel of 4 specimens with varying
concentrations of vanA on 10 different days at each of the three sites (4 specimens x 2
operators/ day x 10 days x 3 sites). One lot of Xpert vanA assay was used at each of
the 3 testing sites.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using Enterococcus faecium (vanA) cells serially diluted
over 6 logs and processed using the Xpert vanA Assay. The diluted cells resulted
in a cell concentration dose range of 50 CFU/test to 5x107 CFU/test. Replicates of
four (4) were tested at each concentration. For enterococci cells, under the
conditions of this study, the Xpert vanA Assay responds linearly (r2 = 0.994) with
respect to vanA detection as a function of Enterococcus faecium cell input over 6
logs (50 – 5x107 CFU/test). The reportable Ct range is 12.1 to 35.3 (cutoff Ct =
40.0). PCR efficiency for the vanA reaction is 87.7 %.

Limit of Detection
Limit of Detection (LoD) studies were performed using Enterococcus faecium (vanA)
diluted into a fecal matrix of human origin that can be detected by the Xpert vanA
Assay. The fecal matrix consisted of autoclaved human liquid feces (vanA negative)
diluted 1:10 in Tris buffer.
The analytical LoD was estimated using 4 to 10 replicates at each dilution. The LoD
was confirmed by running a total of 20 replicates at the estimated LoD concentration.
Under the conditions of this study, the limit of detection for the Xpert vanA Assay on
a simulated rectal swab specimen is 37 CFU.

Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity) / Challenge Panel
Challenge panel included thirty vancomycin-resistant enterococci strains and 20
vancomycin sensitive enterococci strains, provided by the CDC, and tested using the
Xpert vanA Assay. Of the 30 vancomycin-resistant enterococci strains, 10 were
identified as vanA positive. Enterococci strains were selected to broadly represent the
genetic diversity found in enterococci. Stock cultures were prepared by suspending
the bacterial growth from agar plates in PBS buffer containing 15% glycerol. The
concentration of each stock was adjusted to 5.6x109 to 2.1x1010 CFU/mL. All strains
were serially diluted to approximately 360 CFU/swab and tested in triplicate.
All 20 vancomycin sensitive strains were reported as “vanA NEGATIVE”. Among
the 10 vanA positive vancomycin-resistant enterococci strains tested, one strain was
reported as “vanA NEGATIVE.” When this strain was sequenced, it was reported to
be a vanB. The remaining 9 vanA positive vancomycin resistant enterococci strains
were correctly reported as “vanA POSITIVE.”. Among the 20 non-vanA vancomycin
resistant enterococci strains, all were reported as “vanA NEGATIVE.”

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross Reactivity
Forty-two bacterial and fungal strains were collected, quantitated and tested using the
Xpert vanA Assay. The strains originated from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC), Culture Collection University of Göteborg (CCUG), German Collection of
Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ), and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC).
The organisms tested were identified as Gram-positive (22), Gram-negative (18),
including antibiotic-resistant strains of Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp., and
yeast (2). The organisms were further classified as aerobic (24), anaerobic (14) or
microaerophillic (2). Of the species tested, 2 vancomycin-sensitive strains of E. faecalis
and E. faecium were included.
Each strain was tested in triplicate at concentrations ranging from 8.5x108 to 2.3x1010
CFU/swab. Positive and negative controls were included in the study. Under the
conditions of the study, all isolates were reported “vanA NEGATIVE”.
Interference Study
Sixteen exogenous substances occasionally used or found in stool were tested for
interference with the Xpert vanA Assay. These potentially interfering substances
in rectal swab specimens include, but are not limited to, blood, mucus, fecal fats,
laxatives, stool softeners, anti-diarrhea medications, anti-itch creams, lubricants,
antibiotics and hemorrhoid ointments. The substances were tested at levels representing
approximately 1 – 25% (v/v or w/v) final concentrations. Two (2) of the sixteen (16)
exogenous substances tested in this study gave a slightly higher Ct relative to the buffer
control (hydrocortisone cream and Pepto-Bismol®).

Carry-Over Contamination study consisted of a negative sample (no enterococci
present) processed in the same GeneXpert module immediately following a very high
positive sample made up of 106 CFU Enterococcus faecium (vanA) spiked into the
elution buffer. This was repeated 20 times between two GeneXpert modules for a total of
40 runs. All 20 negative samples were correctly reported “vanA NEGATIVE.” All 20
high positive samples were correctly reported “vanA POSITIVE.”
f. Assay cut-off:
Lot Specific Parameters and Assay Settings
Lot specific assay settings are generated for every lot manufactured to account for slight
variations in reagent production. The lot specific assay settings (LSP file) are
incorporated into the 2-D barcode on each cartridge label and are transferred to the
GeneXpert® Dx system via a hand-held barcode scanner prior to initiating the Xpert
vanA Assay.
General Assay Settings
General assay settings are used for all reagent lots. They are fixed and not part of the LSP
process. The following table lists general assay settings:
Attribute Setting
Background Subtraction Always ON
Background Minimum Cycle Default setting = 5
Background Maximum Cycle Manual setting = 30
Manual Threshold (vanA and SPC) Manual setting = 30
Curve Analysis Primary
Boxcar Average Cycles Zero (Off)
Valid Minimum Ct (vanA) Default setting = 5
Valid Minimum Ct (SPC) Manual setting = 25
Valid Maximum Ct (SPC and vanA) Manual setting = 40
The valid cycle range for the vanA target is 5 to 40 cycles based upon pre-clinical results
to maximize percent sensitivity and percent specificity. The valid cycle range for the
SPC is 25 to 40 cycles. The SPC ensures the PCR conditions (temperature and time) are
appropriate for the amplification reaction and that the PCR reagents are functional. SPC
performance is designed to respond to the presence of potentially inhibitory conditions
and provide an invalid test result in lieu of a believable but erroneous test result.
To obtain a valid positive test result, the vanA Ct value must be reported within the valid
cycle range. To obtain a valid negative test result, the SPC Ct must be reported within its
14

valid cycle range. If the SPC falls outside the valid cycle range, the test result is “Invalid”
and must be repeated.
Valid minimum and maximum Ct settings (25 to 40 cycles) for the SPC were derived
from analytical data (vanA lot specific parameter (LSP) testing of three production lots),
inhibitory studies with potentially interfering substances (IS), and pre-clinical true
negative vanA samples collected during the design and development phase.
A valid maximum SPC Ct of 40 cycles was used to differentiate between valid negative
results and invalid results in the clinical study. The SPC was designed to be sensitive to
the presence of inhibition, while at the same time limiting the number of invalid test
results.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Performance characteristics of the Xpert vanA Assay were determined in a multi-site
prospective investigation study at three US sites by comparing the Xpert vanA Assay
to reference culture followed by bi-directional sequencing for confirmation on
vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus isolates.
Subjects included individuals whose routine care called for VRE testing. One swab
from a double swab set was used for patient management; the other swab was used for
the Xpert vanA Assay testing. The leftover swab designated for patient management
was sent to a central laboratory for reference culture.
Leftover specimen swabs designated for culture testing were stored at 2-8°C and
shipped on ice packs to the central culture laboratory within 48 hours of collection.
Reference culture was initiated within 16 hours of receipt or within 5 days of swab
collection.
Each swab was subsequently placed into an enrichment broth. The plates were
incubated at 35°C and examined at 48 and 72 hours. The broth was also incubated at
35°C for 48 hours and subcultured to a bile esculin azide agar with 6 μg/ml of
vancomycin.
Small, gray colonies with a black halo were considered suspicious for VRE.
Presumptive identification was accomplished by performing a Gram stain, catalase and
PYR disc (L-pyrrolidonyl-beta-naphthylamide) test. Presumptive VRE specimens were
Gram-positive cocci or coccobacilli and PYR positive. Presumptive VRE was
definitively identified using the API20S strip (BioMérieux, France). Finally, VRE
isolates were tested for their susceptibility to glycopeptides using vancomycin E-test
strips (AB Biodisk, Sweden). Susceptibility to teicoplanin for the isolates was
determined by agar dilution.
15

--- Page 16 ---
Following reference culture testing, DNA was prepared from vancomycin-resistant
Enterococcus isolates, and sent to a second reference laboratory for bi-directional
sequencing using alternative vanA specific primers (i.e., different from those used in the
Xpert vanA Assay).
Performance of the Xpert vanA Assay was calculated relative to the results of direct
culture with bi-directional sequencing, and enriched culture with bi-directional
sequencing.
Overall Results
A total of 1231 specimens were tested by Xpert vanA Assay, culture and bi-directional
sequencing.

• Operator Manual
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The GeneXpert Dx System automates and integrates sample preparation, nucleic acid
®
amplification, and detection of the target DNA sequence in patient specimens using
realtime Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).
Each GeneXpert instrument is similar in that the GeneXpert I (GX I), GeneXpert IV (GX
IV) and GeneXpert XVI (GX XVI) all contain the same modules. The difference
between the GeneXpert models is that the GX I contains one module, the GX IV can hold
up to four modules, and the GX XVI can hold up to sixteen modules, each of which
processes one sample at a time. Once the cartridge is loaded in the instrument, all fluids
are completely contained within the disposable, single-use plastic Xpert™ Assay
cartridges throughout the sample handling, amplification and detection processes.

Components
Valve Drive Rotates the cartridge valve body to address the different cartridge chambers.
Syringe Pump drive Dispenses fluids to and from the different cartridge chambers.
Ultrasonic horn Lyses the bacterial cells and sample prep control.
I-CORE® module Performs PCR amplification and detection. As the user inserts the cartridge
into the system, the reaction tube component of the cartridge is inserted into
the I-CORE module. After sample preparation within the cartridge, the sample
and reagent mixture is transferred from the cartridge chamber into the reaction
tube. During the amplification process, the I-CORE heater heats up and the
fan cools down the reaction tube contents. Two optical blocks positioned
within the ICORE excite the dye molecules that make up the probes and detect
the fluorescence emitted. The system uses calibration and data analysis
algorithms to determine a relative fluorescence value for each reporter dye
after each thermal cycle.
Hand-held Barcode Scans cartridge barcode and optional Patient or Sample ID barcode into
Scanner the GeneXpert Dx System.
5. Calibration:
Optical and thermal calibration of the GeneXpert Dx System is performed by Cepheid at
the time of manufacture prior to installation and once yearly or after 1000 runs per
module. The user does not calibrate or perform any serviceable functions on the
instrument. The normalization function compensates for any optical degradation between
calibrations.
The thermal reaction chamber thermistors are calibrated to ± 0.50ºC using National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-traceable standards. During the
manufacturing process, the temperature of the heating system is measured at two
temperatures: 60ºC and 95ºC. Calibration coefficients that correct for small errors in the
raw thermistor readings of the heaters are stored in the memory of each I-CORE module.
The optical system is calibrated using standard concentrations of individual unquenched
fluorescent dye-oligos. For each optical channel, the signal produced by a tube alone
(the blank signal) is subtracted from the raw signal produced by the dye-oligo standard
to determine the spectral characteristics. Using the individual spectral characteristics of
the pure dye-oligos, signals from an unknown mixture of dye-oligos can be resolved
into corrected signals for the individual dye-oligos in the mixture.

6. Quality Control:
The Xpert vanA Assay includes a system control, referred to as the Probe
Check Control (PCC), and an internal control, referred to as the Sample Processing
Control (SPC). These internal controls are contained within the Xpert vanA cartridge.
An additional control is the System Control Check for Temperature. This check ensures
that the GeneXpert Dx Instrument is operating within validated heating and cooling
®
specifications.
The Probe Check Control (PCC) verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling in the
cartridge, probe integrity, and dye stability. The PCC is considered to PASS if the
fluorescence generated meets the validated acceptance criteria. If the PCC fails for vanA
target or SPC, a probe check error is reported and the test will not continue.
The SPC verifies that conditions adequate for processing the target bacteria containing
the vanA gene have occurred. It consists of Bacillus globigii spores formulated into a dry
reagent bead included in each Xpert vanA cartridge. In addition, the SPC verifies the
effectiveness of each sample preparation step, including reaction tube filling, that all
reaction components are present and functioning, and monitoring for the presence of
potential inhibitor(s) in the PCR Assay.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Failure Modes Testing was performed to determine the effect of failure modes that might
occur with the vanA Assay. Assay failures may be attributed to operator error,
manufacturing error, or instrument malfunction.
Operator error may include failing to add a liquid reagent to the cartridge or adding a liquid
reagent to the wrong chamber. The following table includes results of the study describing
possible operator errors

A manufacturing error may result in beads being loaded incorrectly into the cartridge before
packaging (missing beads or double beads), or a cartridge being assembled incorrectly
(missing the filter required for cell capture). Results of the manufacturing error study is
presented in the table below

Some examples of instrument malfunctions include ultrasonic horn failure, motion of the
syringe drive not detected, syringe pressure reading exceeds protocol limit, the system failed
to find the plunger home position, a valve positioning error was detected, digital temperature
reading of thermistor(s) not within acceptable range, and the optical signal from the
detector(s) did not reach the expected value. Because the software performs self-check
procedures prior to the start of each test, if any of the instrument malfunctions described
above occur the test is aborted; no assay results are reported. Operation-terminated error
messages are stored for each test and appear in the View Results screen. Instrument
malfunctions are not part of this failure mode effect and criticality testing. However, failure
mode effect and criticality analysis (FMECA) and hazard analysis has been completed on the
GeneXpert Dx system.
Thermal Calibration Study was performed to determine if the thermal calibration is stable
for 2,000 runs regardless of the time period of instrument use. The data from the study
reported that a 2,000 run thermal stability claim can be supported with a predicted failure rate
of 0.7%. The current labeling for the GeneXpert Dx System is 1 year or 1000 runs/module,
whichever comes first.
Calibrator Variation Study was conducted to quantify possible effects of degradation of
GeneXpert optical calibrations on assay performance. At 95% confidence, the data from the
altered calibrations are the same as the data from the nominal calibration. These data provide
evidence that the Xpert assays will continue to function effectively even when the instrument
calibrations are off by as much as ±50%.
Decay of GeneXpert Optical Calibration study was performed to determine the rate of
degradation of the GeneXpert optical calibration. Based on the average measured rate of
optical calibration decay following 2000 runs and the demonstrated effectiveness of probe
check normalization to mitigate optical calibration decay, Xpert assays will meet
specifications for optical performance with 99% confidence. No adverse impact on assay
performance is expected. If assay-specific probe check acceptance criteria are not met, Xpert
tests are aborted prior to initiation of PCR.
