H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Pathwork® Tissue of Origin Test is an in vitro diagnostic intended to measure the
degree of similarity between the RNA expression patterns in a patient’s formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor and the RNA expression patterns in a database of
fifteen tumor types (poorly differentiated, undifferentiated and metastatic cases) that were
diagnosed according to then current clinical and pathological practice. This test should
be evaluated by a qualified physician in the context of the patient’s clinical history and
other diagnostic test results.
Limitations: The Pathwork® Tissue of Origin Test is not intended to establish the origin
of tumors (e.g. cancer of unknown primary) that cannot be diagnosed according to
current clinical and pathological practice. It is not intended to subclassify or modify the
classification of tumors that can be diagnosed by current clinical and pathological
practice, nor to predict disease course or survival or treatment efficacy, nor to distinguish
primary from metastatic tumor. Tumor types not in the Pathwork® Tissue of Origin Test
database may have RNA expression patterns that are similar to patterns in the database.
Therefore, results cannot be used to distinguish tumor types in the database from tumor
types not in the database.

I. Device Description:
The Pathwork® Tissue of Origin Test Kit-FFPE (Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded) is a
modification of the Tissue of Origin Test kit (k080896) which was FDA cleared on
7/30/2008. Differences between the modified product and the original test system are in the
specimen assessed, the method of preparation of the specimen for hybridization to the chip,
the algorithm employed to convert the expression data to a diagnostics report, and the guide
to report interpretation.
The Pathwork® Tissue of Origin Test is a test kit consists of the Pathchip microarray,
reagents, software, Pathwork Specimen Processing Guide and Guide to Report Interpretation
(GRI). The Pathchip microarray employed in Origin Test Kit-FFPE test is the same one as
employed in the predicate Pathwork Tissue of Origin Test (k080896). As with the original
test kit cleared by k080896, the specimen processing up to chip hybridization will be done at
the clinical laboratory.
Pathwork Diagnostics, in its labeling for the Origin Test Kit-FFPE test, recommends
Pathwork reagents for RNA extraction, in vitro transcription (IVT), biotinylated cDNA
synthesis, and array preparation. These reagents are manufactured for Pathwork and are
controlled under Pathwork’s Quality System.
The Pathwork FFPE Specimen Processing Guide (SPG) provides instructions to enable the
user to process FFPE tissue specimens.
Software for the Origin Test Kit-FFPE product is composed of transmission software and
analytical software. Transmission software is provided to the laboratory processing the
specimen on the Pathchip. Analytic software is not provided to the laboratory, but remains at
Pathwork. The transmission software allows the user to upload the CEL file to Pathwork,
where it is analyzed, and allows reverse transmission of a report from Pathwork to the user
laboratory. This software is unchanged from k080896. The Pathwork analytical software
converts the CEL file to gene expression measurements, performs data verification,
standardizes the data to correct for lab-to-lab variation, converts the gene expression values
to Similarity Scores, stores the results and produces a report (pdf file) summarizing these
results. This software employs an algorithm different from the one employed for frozen
tissue and reported in k080896.
The algorithm was built upon the earlier algorithm for the predicate device, and was adapted
for use with FFPE specimens. The test development used a machine learning approach based
on marker selection and a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to build a predictive
model. The model consists of a list of markers, a set of reference (support) samples, and a
set of coefficients. These components are combined to produce 15 probabilities (Similarity
Scores), each corresponding to likelihood that the input specimen has a molecular signature
of the corresponding tissue of origin.
As with the predicate, report presents, in a graphical format, 15 computed Similarity Scores
(SS), one for each tissue on the test panel. The 15 tumor types evaluated are bladder (BL),
breast (BR), colorectal (CO), gastric (GA), testicular germ cell (GC), hepatocellular (LI),
kidney (KI), non-small cell lung (LU), non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (LY), melanoma (ME),
ovarian (OV), pancreatic (PA), prostate (PR), sarcoma (SC), and thyroid (TH).

L. Test Principle:
The specimen used for this assay is a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue block.
The test uses curls from a formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) block. The Origin
Test Kit-FFPE test can be performed on a single 10-μm-thick curl cut from the block, or on
up to five curls. It is not recommended to assess more than five curls per microarray.
Routine histological sectioning and H&E staining should be performed to determine percent
tumor (includes tumor, hyper- and hypocellular stroma). The specimen must contain at least
60% viable tumor. The tissue must be de-paraffinized and total RNA must be isolated per
the Pathwork Specimen Processing Guide (SPG). Thirty (30) nanograms of total RNA are
required to perform the test.
The procedural steps after isolation of total RNA from the specimen begin with a two-cycle
RNA amplification: 1) round 1 reverse transcription (RT) of total RNA with dT and random
RT primers; 2) purification of round 1 cDNA; 3) tailing of first-strand cDNA with terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase; 4) synthesis of T7/T3 promoter sequence; 5) T7 in vitro
transcription 6) round 2 RT of sense RNA with a dT and random primers; 7) T3 in vitro
transcription (linear amplification); 8) purification of round 2 sense RNA; 9) RT of round 2
sense RNA with random primers; and 10) purification and fragmentation of biotinylated
DNA. This is followed by hybridization of the biotin-labeled cDNA target to the Pathchip
microarray; washing and scanning of the hybridized Pathchip microarray; data acquisition
(signal intensity per feature; CEL file), data verification, standardization of the signal

intensities; determination of similarity to 15 tissues of origin and generation of the Report.
The CEL file from each laboratory is transported from the Affymetrix Workstation with
GeneChip® Operating System (GCOSDx) using the Pathwork File Transfer Software
(PFTS) through a secure FTP transfer protocol to Pathwork Diagnostics for analysis. The
Pathwork System Software (PSS) then converts the CEL file to gene expression
measurements, performs data verification, normalizes (standardizes) the data to correct for
technical sources of variation, performs a series of multiplex statistical tests, and produces a
report summarizing these results. Each specimen analyzed will produce 15 Similarity
Scores, one for each tissue on the panel. Each Similarity Score is a measure of the similarity
of the gene expression profile of the specimen to the profile of the indicated tissue, ranging
from 0 (very low similarity) to 100 (very high similarity). Similarity Scores for all 15 tissues
sum to 100. For each Origin Test Kit–FFPE test performed, a test report is generated that
quantifies the similarity of the RNA expression pattern found in a tumor specimen (poorly or
un-differentiated primary tumors, as well as metastatic tumors) to expression patterns found
in tumor specimens from 15 known tissues of origin and provided back to the laboratory over
a secure internet connection in pdf format.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Inter-laboratory reproducibility study:
Replicate samples from 60 individual tumors were distributed among the three
laboratories for a total of 177 tissue samples (Site 1 did not receive two specimens
and Site 3 did not receive one specimen due to insufficient stocks at the time
specimen processing began). Of the 60 specimens, 27 (45%) were metastases and 33
(55%) were primaries classified as poorly differentiated to undifferentiated. This
study required each laboratory to perform the full protocol from FFPE curls. Each of
the 15 tissues in the Origin Test Kit-FFPE test panel was represented by four
specimens. Each curl was processed at three different laboratories. The methods for
RNA extraction amplification and purification, target preparation, cDNA labeling and
hybridization, array washing, staining and scanning were according to the procedure
in the Pathwork Specimen Processing Guide (SPG) for Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-
Embedded Tissues. Array CEL files were transferred to Pathwork for analysis with
Pathwork System Software. Pathwork’s predetermined acceptance criteria were that
(i) at least 85% concordance must be observed between the tissue of origin
predictions when an overall pairwise comparison is made and (ii) that there is no
evidence for differences across sites.

Pathwork has determined that Origin-FFPE SE regressions demonstrate more scatter
than Origin-Frozen SE regressions. This is ostensibly due to the lower signal that is
produced on Origin-FFPE microarrays. This lower signal is, in turn, due to the more
challenging nature of gene expression profiling of FFPE total RNA. However,
Similarity Score (SS) is considered as the primary analytical output of the test.
Similarity Score
Matched pairs of specimens which were successfully processed at both laboratories
were evaluated using linear regression and correlation analysis to evaluate the
reproducibility of Similarity Score values. Across all three laboratories, three pair-
wise comparisons showed slopes of 0.93 to 0.97 and “r” of 0.92 to 0.93.

specimen, an average of the similarity scores associated with the actual tissue of
origin (Available Diagnosis) was calculated, along with standard deviation (SD) and
percent coefficient of variation (% CV).

2) Amount of fragmented, labeled cDNA used for hybridization to Pathchip
microarrays: 3.0 (± 0.5) μg.
To ensure that a sufficient quantity of high quality labeled cDNA is obtained for
hybridization to Pathchip microarrays, it is recommended that:
1) All procedures in the Pathwork Specimen Processing Guide are followed
efficiently to reduce RNase degradation.
2) FFPE block size is sufficient to take a 5 μm section for H&E staining and a 10 μm
± 1 μm section (curl) with a minimum tissue area of at least 25 mm2 or equivalent
for the test.
3) Specimen contain at least 60% viable tumor.
4) Absorbance measurements of total RNA give an A260/A280 ratio of greater than
1.0 (typically 1.0 to 2.2).
5) The minimum amount of labeled cDNA used for fragmentation is 2.5 μg.
Endogenous Pathchip Controls:
In addition to these external controls, the Origin Test Kit–FFPE test utilizes
endogenous mRNA markers that are found in human tissue specimens and are
captured on the Pathchip microarray to perform a series of data verifications that
detect laboratory processing anomalies found to unfavorably influence the accuracy
of the Origin Test Kit – FFPE test. These data verifications include the detection of
regional discontinuities and low overall signal. When a submitted file fails one or
more of the data verifications, the system software will return an Origin Test Kit –
FFPE Report flagged as “Unacceptable”, with caution messages appropriate for the
specific type of failure that occurred.
Device stability:
Storage conditions for the Origin Test Kit - FFPE reagents range from -20°C to
ambient temperature.
d. Detection limit:
Dilution study – Labeled cDNA:
A dilution study was performed to demonstrate that the Origin Test Kit – FFPE test is
robust against reasonable variations in the amount of labeled cDNA used in
hybridization. The study used three different FFPE specimens. RNA was extracted
and processed to the point of labeled cDNA. For each specimen, Pathchip arrays
were hybridized in triplicate with each of the five dilutions (1, 2, 4, 6 and 7.5 μg) of
labeled cDNA. Subsequent processing of all 3 specimens x 5 dilutions x triplicates (=
45 arrays) was performed per the recommended protocol. One Pathchip array failed
the percent present requirement, thus 44 arrays were used for further analysis. The
data was analyzed using linear regression and correlation analysis to assess
equivalence. Based on the data, the Pathwork® Tissue of Origin Test Kit–FFPE User
Guide specifies 3.0 ± 0.5 μg labeled cDNA.
e. Analytical specificity:
Several potential interfering substances in tumor biopsies were evaluated for potential
8

--- Page 9 ---
adverse effects.
RNases: Performance of the test using specimens derived from biopsies of the
pancreas, a tissue known to contain high levels of endogenous ribonuclease (RNase),
was equivalent to performance of the test for specimens derived from other tissue
types. Nonetheless, Pathwork recommends that care be taken to limit specimen
exposure to RNases during storage, extraction and processing of specimens.
Necrotic tissue: To examine whether necrotic tissue produce adverse effects in use of
the Origin Test Kit-FFPE, the results from the FFPE specimens used in the clinical
validation study were stratified by percent necrosis. Based on the % agreement, the
Origin Test Kit-FFPE demonstrates adequate performance with up to 40% necrotic
tissue in the sample.
Adipose Tissue: To examine whether the adipose tissue in breast tumors is a
potential interferrent and produce adverse effects in the Tissue of Origin test, the
results from 58 breast-related specimens included in the clinical validation were
compared to its available clinical diagnosis. Available clinical diagnoses from
Breast-related specimens were in 96.6% agreement with PGC, compared to all
specimens which had 88.5% agreement.
Fibrous material: To examine whether fibrous material in skin-related specimens,
produce adverse effects in the Tissue of Origin Test, the results from 27 skin-related
specimens included in the clinical validation were compared to its available clinical
diagnosis. Available clinical diagnoses from skin-related specimens were in 85.2%
agreement with PGC, compared to all specimens which had 88.5% agreement.
Tissue of Origin Test does not demonstrate apparent adverse effects with this
interfering substance.
f. Assay cut-off:
The Similarity Score (SS) is a measure of the similarity of the RNA expression
pattern of the specimen to the RNA expression pattern of the indicated tissue.
Similarity Scores range from 0 (very low similarity) to 100 (very high similarity) and
sum to 100 across all 15 tissues on the panel.
• The highest Similarity Score indicates the likely tissue of origin.
• A Similarity Score less than or equal to 5 rules out that tissue type as the
likely tissue of origin.
• Performance has not been established for results where the highest Similarity
Score is less than 20.
The TOO Test Kit - FFPE does not produce an indeterminate result. The highest
Similarity Score (SS) indicates the likely tissue of origin, unless it is <20. When the
highest SS is <20, the accuracy or reproducibility of the top score is not assured,
hence the statement in the Guide to Report Interpretation that “Performance has not
been established for results where the highest Similarity Score is less than 20.”
9

--- Page 10 ---
In the predicate device (TOO Test with frozen specimens), the entire assay was
indeterminate if there were no SS >30. This is not the case with the TOO Test Kit –
FFPE, which uses different reagents and a different algorithm than the predicate
device.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with available diagnosis:
The clinical validation studies were performed to assess the predictive capability of
the Pathwork Origin-FFPE test in determining the tissue of origin of poorly
differentiated, undifferentiated and metastatic FFPE tumor specimens with tissue of
origin within the 15-tissue panel. The study was performed at three different
processing sites. For each specimen, an H&E slide was received at Pathwork and a
Pathwork pathologist examined it for % tumor before accepting the specimen into
final analysis. Only specimens with >60% tumor were analyzed. The sites received
the curls, processed the specimens per the Specimen processing Guide, and sent the
scanned CEL files to Pathwork for analysis. Primary end-point was overall %
agreement of Test result with available diagnosis. Each laboratory was expected to
achieve the overall acceptance criteria of at least 80% agreement with the available
diagnosis, with no more than 20% non-agreement.
The acceptance criterion for the primary endpoint specified that the lower bound of
the 95% confidence interval of the overall percent agreement with available diagnosis
shall be ≥75%).
The study included 25 to 57 specimens per tissue on the panel. Of the total 598 tumor
specimens processed in this study, 462 specimens met the labeling limitations for
tumor grade and available diagnosis and passed the data verification quality tests. To
assess the accuracy of the results reported by each laboratory, the Origin Test Kit–
FFPE results were compared to available diagnosis established for each specimen.
For individual tumors, average % agreement ranged from 72 % (gastric) to 96.5% (breast).
Overall agreement with Available Diagnosis was 88.5%, with the lower and upper bounds of
the 95% CI as 85.3 and 91.3 respectively. Any tissue type with a Similarity Score less
than or equal to 5 had a 99.8%, 95% CI [99.7, 99.9] probability of not being the tissue
of origin.
The detailed results are presented in the following Tables.
Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) –100*TP/POS, where TP is the number of test results that
match the available diagnoses for the given tissue of origin and POS is the total number of
positive specimens as per available diagnosis for the given tissue of origin.
Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) – 100*(1-(FP/NEG)), where FP is the number of test
results that are false positive (as per the available diagnoses) for the given tissue of origin and
NEG is the number of negative specimens as per the available diagnosis for the given tissue of
origin.
Non-Agreement (%) – the percent of POS specimens in which the Pathwork test result does not
10

agree with the available diagnosis.

The majority of specimens are on the diagonal, as is expected from the 88.5% overall
agreement with available diagnosis. Diagnostic Odds Ratio was calculated for each
individual tissue in the Origin test. DOR was significantly greater than 1 for all 15
tissues, indicating that all 15 tests are informative.
The Off-Panel Specimen Study was to assess off-panel specimen “cross-reactivity” in
the Origin test Kit-FFPE test for tumor specimens that do not originate from one of
the 15 tissues on the Origin Test Kit – FFPE panel.
Tissue specimens that are off-panel (i.e. not one of the fifteen tissues on the Tissue of
Origin Test panel) were assessed for similarity in RNA expression pattern with one of
the 15 tissues on the panel. A review of published sources and interviews with
practitioners were conducted to identify the cancers not included in the 15 tissues on
the Origin Test Kit–FFPE test panel that should be evaluated in this study. Criteria for
selection included:
• Commonly known to metastasize

• Challenging or difficult to diagnose
• Likely to present as an uncertain primary cancer
This review selected the following: cancer of the uterine cervix, endometrium,
esophagus, small cell lung, and squamous cell carcinoma of the head & neck. The
study involved 101 off-panel tissue specimens from tissues from tumors of CNS
origin, adult (CN, n = 13), endometrium (EN, n = 12), esophagus (ES, n = 11), head
and neck, squamous, (HN, n = 10), mesothelioma (MT, n = 10), neuroendocrine (NE,
n =12), ovarian germ cell (OG, n=11), small cell lung (SL, n = 11), and uterine
cervix (UC, n =11), of which 82/101 (81.2%) yielded Origin Test Kit – FFPE results.
Table 8 below shows off-panel specimen results and how highest Similarity Scores
are distributed across the 15 tissues on the Origin Test Kit–FFPE panel. For off-panel
tissue specimens, this indicates a false positive association with that cancer. For each
off panel tissue type, a high false positive percentage was observed, especially for
several cancers (CN, EN, MT, OG) with ovarian and HN and SL with non-small cell
lung. The table indicates that the Pathwork Origin-FFPE Test, when applied to
tumors having origins not included in the panel, will give a result indicating one of
the tissues on the panel. Therefore, no conclusion can be drawn about the presence of
absence of off-panel tissues from the results of this test. This limitation will be noted
on the labeling of the product.
