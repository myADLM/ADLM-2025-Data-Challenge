510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
k092978
B. Purpose for Submission:
Device modification to k081830. New imaging aid to the existing device.
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Phadia AB, ImmunoCAP® Rapid Reader
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Semi-quantitative, lateral flow immunoassay
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The ImmunoCAP® Rapid Reader is part of ImmunoCAP® Rapid System, which
is a combination of lateral flow immunoassay reagents and instrument/software
for semi-quantitative determination of IgE antibodies in human capillary whole
blood, heparinized venous whole blood or heparinized plasma.
The Rapid Reader is a stand alone instrument to be used with ImmunoCAP Rapid
Assay Device. It consists of the Rapid Reader instrument and associated software.
The user interface consists of a LCD display with a touch screen and a slot for
insertion of the ImmunoCAP Rapid Assay Device. The Reader includes functions
for photometric reading and scoring of the test results. The Assay Device is
illuminated with white color spectrum LED’s. A sensor records an image of the
Assay Device including Test and Control Windows, and reads the color saturation
(Color Units).
Software: The built in software performs the control checks and the necessary
calculations to convert Color Units to Class scores. Patient or external control
results are displayed and printed only if internal Reader controls and Assay
Device controls are valid.
Assay Device docking system: The slot for the ImmunoCAP Rapid Assay Device
has one optical switch for interaction with the Assay Device to initiate reading
and system checks.
Camera, optics, and light source: The camera is a CMOS camera with a pixel
resolution of 2048 x 1536. The light source consists of four, white color spectrum
LEDs placed behind four diffusers, to ensure even illumination of the reading area
on the Assay Device.
Computer system and power supply: Integrated microprocessor with a 45W input
100-240V ~ 1.2A 50-60 Hz power supply.

Display and touch screen: The user interface consists of a LCD panel with 480 x
272 pixel resolution, with included touch interface functionality.
Printer: Built in thermal printer for automatic printing of assay results.
2. Principles of Operation:
The Reader includes functions for photometric reading and scoring of the test
results. The Assay Device is illuminated with white color spectrum LED’s. A
sensor records an image of the Assay Device including Test and Control
Windows, and reads the color saturation (Color Units). The built in software
performs the control checks and the necessary calculations to convert Color Units
to Class scores. Patient or external control results will be displayed and printed
only if internal Reader controls and Assay Device controls are valid.
The ImmunoCAP Rapid Reader quantitatively measures the color saturation and
converts the signal into Color Units (CU). The higher the concentration of IgE
antibodies in the sample the stronger the color of the red lines, i.e. higher CU
values. CU values are then categorized semiquantitatively into Class 1, 2 or 3.
The user performs the Rapid assay according to the instructions for use and
inserts the Assay Device into the Rapid Reader as shown on the screen of the
Reader. If the necessary control conditions are met, assay results will be displayed
on the screen and automatically printed. If the Reader does not detect the blood
sample or the assay control lines are missing, the Rapid Reader will not report or
print any results. The Reader displays results as Class 1, 2 or 3 for each allergen.
3. Modes of Operation:
Semi-automated. No change from the predicate device.
4. Specimen Identification:
Manual input by user.. No changes from the Predicate Device.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Samples should be obtained and handled according to the laboratory’s standard
operating procedures and following the protocol described in the package insert.
No changes from the Predicate Device.
6. Calibration:
ImmunoCAP Rapid Reader is calibrated at manufacturing and does not require
any user calibration. No changes from the Predicate Device.
7. Quality Control:
The performance of ImmunoCAP Rapid Reader is verified at regular intervals
through the use of the Check Device. No changes from the Predicate Device
.

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed a precision study using a special pre-prepared Assay
Device to estimate the variation within and between Readers. The Assay Device
was constructed using the same plastic housing device as in ImmunoCAP Rapid
Inhalant Profile 1, but replacing the allergen strips with pre-prepared strips with 5
defined colored areas. The same pre-prepared Assay Device was read by 3
different Readers in 30 replicates. The Color Units (CU) values were recorded for
each reading and the variation within and between Readers was estimated using a
one-way analysis of variance model and the estimated components expressed as
CV%.
Table below show the Coefficients Variance (CV%) for a pre-colored Assay
Device read in 3 different Readers in 30 replicates and measured as Color Units
(CU). As shown in the table below, % CV between readers varied from 0.46 to
2.69 and within readers varied from 0.3 to 2.43. The total CV% varied from 0.59
to 3.63.
