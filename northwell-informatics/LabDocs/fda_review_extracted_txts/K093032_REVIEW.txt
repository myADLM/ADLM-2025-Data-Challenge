a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The within run precision (CV) of the CK-MB, Troponin, and BNP assay was
performed by assaying the Total 3 Controls (low and high levels) for 20 days. This
testing was considered to be representative of the Triage® Total 3 Calibration
Verification Set. The controls were tested as they represent samples with CK-MB,
Troponin I, and BNP concentrations near the clinical decision points and within the
affected ranges. CLSI guideline EP5A, Evaluation of Precision Performance of
Quantitative Measurement Methods was used as a guideline in performing and
evaluating these studies,

Calibration Verification set by assaying multiple vials of Triage® Total 3 Controls (TC3)
and Triage® Total 3 Calibration Verification on 20 days using multiple Triage test
devices. The observed mean is used to establish the expected value range which is the
mean ±3 SD. The expected values of the Triage® Total 3 Controls (TC3) and Triage®
Total 3 Calibration Verification Set are lot dependent and are listed on the Expected
Values (EV) card for each level
In the labeling, the sponsor recommends that each laboratory establish their own
acceptable ranges.
