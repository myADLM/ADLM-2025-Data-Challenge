Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, and S. pneumoniae.
The VITEK® 2 Gram Positive Susceptibility Card is designed for antimicrobial
susceptibility testing of Gram positive microorganisms and is intended for use
with the VITEK® 2 and VITEK® 2 Compact Systems as a laboratory aid in the
determination of in vitro susceptibility of Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus spp.,
and Streptococcus agalactiae to antimicrobial agents when used as instructed in
the Online Product Information.
2. Indication(s) for use:
VITEK® 2 Gram Positive Doxycycline is designed for antimicrobial susceptibility
testing of Gram positive microorganisms and is intended for use with the VITEK®
2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems as a laboratory aid in the determination of in
vitro susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. VITEK 2 Gram Positive Doxycycline
is a qualitative test. Doxycycline has been shown to be active against the
microorganisms listed below according to the FDA label for the antimicrobial.
Active in vitro and in clinical infections:
Staphylococcus aureus
The VITEK® 2 Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) is intended to be used
with the VITEK® 2 and VITEK® 2 Compact Systems for the automated
quantitative or qualitative susceptibility testing of isolated colonies for the most
clinically significant aerobic gram negative bacilli, Staphylococcus spp.,
Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, and S. pneumoniae.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
For use with the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems
I. Device Description:
VITEK 2 AST card containing the test is inoculated with a standardized suspension of
the organism to be tested. The VITEK 2 System automatically fills, seals, and places
the card into the incubator/reader while the VITEK 2 Compact System has manual
filling, sealing and loading operation. The incubated card is optically monitored by
the VITEK 2 Systems for growth within each well in the card throughout the
incubation cycle. At the completion of incubation, results are automatically calculated
once a predetermined growth threshold is reached. A report is then generated that
2

contains the MIC value and the interpretive category result (S.I.R) for each antibiotic
contained on the card.
The MIC ranges, interpretive criteria and equivalent concentrations are as follows:
Equivalent MIC Ranges and FDA/CLSI Categories
VITEK 2 Standard Method MIC* in µg/mL:
AST-GP Concentration by
Efficacy in µg/mL S I R
Doxycycline 0.25, 1, 2, 4 ≤ 4 8 > 16
S = Susceptible: Attainable levels in blood or tissue on usual usage, including oral
administration when applicable.
I = Intermediate: The intermediate category implies clinical efficacy in body sites
where the drugs are physiologically concentrated (e.g. quinolones and B-lactams in
urine), or when a higher than normal dosage of drug can be used (e.g. B-lactams).
The “intermediate” category also includes a “buffer zone” which should prevent
small, uncontrolled, technical factors from causing major discrepancies in
interpretations, especially for drugs with narrow pharmacotoxicity margins.
R = Resistant to usually achievable systemic concentrations.

L. Test Principle:
Automated growth based detection using attenuation of light measured by an optical
scanner. The optics used in the systems use visible light to directly measure organism
growth. Transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before
significant growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same
well measure organism growth by how much light is prevented from going through
the well. The VITEK 2 System monitors the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period of time. An interpretive call is made between 4 and 16 hours for a
“rapid” read but may be extended to 18 hours in some instances. At the completion of
the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the
interpretive category result for each antibiotic on the card. The VITEK 2 Gram
Positive Doxycycline will have the following concentrations: 0.25, 1, 2, and 4 µg/mL.
The VITEK 2 Gram Positive Doxycycline provides MIC results ranging from ≤4 -
≥16 µg/mL.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was conducted at three study sites. Ten Gram positive isolates
were tested at each site and testing was performed in triplicate over three days
with the VITEK 2 AST Gram positive Doxycycline. The testing was
performed using both the manual dilution method and the automated dilution
mode. Testing was conducted on the VITEK 2 instrument.
For the sake of reproducibility calculations, off-scale values are handled in
two ways; “best case” and “worst case” scenarios. Best case calculation for
reproducibility assumes the off-scale result is within one well from the mode
MIC value. Worst case calculation for reproducibility assuming the off-scale
result is greater than one well from the mode MIC value.
The overall reproducibility was >95% with +/- one dilution observation. For
Automatic Dilution, the VITEK 2 AST Gram positive Doxycycline gave
overall reproducibility values of 100% and 98.9% based on best case and
worst case calculations, respectively. Identical overall results were obtained
by Manual Dilution.
A similar reproducibility study was conducted by testing on the VITEK 2
Compact instrument. The VITEK 2 AST Gram positive Doxycycline card
gave a best case and worst case between site reproducibility of 100% by
Manual Dilution. Only Manual Dilution testing was conducted since the
VITEK 2 Compact system does not have a functionality to support automatic
dilution to inoculate the card.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended QC isolates were tested on every test occasion with the
reference method and the VITEK 2 System. The reference method QC results
were in range for every day that they were tested. The VITEK 2 was tested a
sufficient number of times to demonstrate that the system can produce QC
results in the recommended range.
Quality Control was performed during the studies using both the auto-dilution
and the manual method of diluting the organisms on the VITEK 2 System.
Results demonstrated that methods were comparable with the same mode.

expected quality control results.
A similar QC study was conducted to evaluate the VITEK 2 Compact System.
Results were compared to the expected CLSI QC results. All results for the
Vitek 2 Compact System were within the expected QC ranges 100% of the
time. However, all values for The VITEK 2 were at 0.5 µg/mL, the top of the
QC range.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Performance was established through an initial clinical study which was
conducted initially at four sites (three external and one internal). In addition,
another clinical study was conducted at one external site to include additional
fresh isolates of S. aureus.
Testing was done using the VITEK 2 Gram positive cards with Doxycycline
and the broth microdilution method using Mueller Hinton (MH) broth (cation
adjusted) supplemented with 50 μg/mL calcium. The MH broth was incubated
at 35°C in ambient air for up to 18 hours. The inoculum was prepared with
direct colony suspension. The testing included both fresh clinical isolates and
stock isolates along with a challenge set with known results. Two methods of
inoculation (manual and auto dilution) were evaluated. Clinical testing was
performed using the automated method of inoculation and the challenge set
was tested using both the manual and the auto dilution method. A comparison
was provided to the reference method with the following agreement.

EA-Essential Agreement CA-Category Agreement
NS-not susceptible
Essential agreement (EA) is when the VITEK 2 panels agree with the
reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the
reference method. Category agreement (CA) is when the VITEK 2 panel
result interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result
interpretation. Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the
VITEK 2 and the reference and have on-scale EA.
A CA of 88.4% observed for challenge isolates is slightly lower than the 90%
recommended in the FDA guidance. However, this is acceptable since a high
