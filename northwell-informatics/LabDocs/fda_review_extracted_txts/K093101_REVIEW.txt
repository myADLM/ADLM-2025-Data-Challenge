510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number: K093101
B. Purpose for Submission: Assessment of new instrument for cleared assay.
C. Measurand: Rubella-specific IgG in human serum
D. Type of Test: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
E. Applicant: Diamedix Corporation
F. Proprietary and Established Names: Diamedix Immunosimplicity® (Is) Rubella
IgG EIA Test Kit
G. Regulatory Information:
1. Regulation section: 21 CFR §866.3510, Rubella virus serological reagents
2. Classification: Class II
3. Product code: LFX (Enzyme Linked Immunoabsorbent Assay, Rubella), JJF
4. Panel: Virology (81)
Note: The Diamedix Immunosimplicity® (Is) Rubella IgG EIA Test Kit was
cleared as K981729. The subject of the current review is the assessment of
the previously cleared Diamedix Immunosimplicity® (Is) Rubella IgG EIA
Test Kit when used in conjunction with automated EIA processors
(MAGO 4S Automated EIA and IFA Processor). This review serves as an
assessment of the application of the MAGO 4S instrumentation and it
DOES NOT CONSTITUTE ANY ASSESSMENT FOR A NEW
CLEARANCE OF A RUBELLA IGG OR OTHER ASSAY. Clearance of
the Rubella IgG EIA assay is based on the original submission, K981729.
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
For the qualitative, semi-quantitative and quantitative detection of IgG antibodies
to rubella in human serum by indirect enzyme immunoassay to aid in the
assessment of the patient’s immunological response to rubella and in the
determination of the immune status of individuals, including females of child-
bearing age. The evaluation of acute and convalescent sera can aid in the
diagnosis of current or recent infection with rubella.

The Mago 4S Automated EIA and IFA Processor is a pipetting, diluting,
incubating, and color intensity analyzing system for in vitro diagnostic clinical
use for the processing of FDA-cleared enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays
(EIA) through result generation. In addition, it processes immunofluorescence
assay (IFA) slides for off-platform detection and result generation.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Diamedix Immunosimplicity® (Is) Rubella IgG EIA Test Kit can be used as
an aid in the assessment of the patient’s immunological response to rubella and in
the determination of the immune status of individuals, including females of child-
bearing age.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
The device can be used either manually or with automated EIA processor: MAGO
4S Automated EIA and IFA Processor.
I. Device Description:
The Diamedix Immunosimplicity® (Is) Rubella IgG Test Kit is an enzyme
immunoassay (EIA) procedure intended for the qualitative and quantitative detection
of antibodies to rubella antigen. The results are reported in IU/ml, which are traceable
to the WHO 1st International Standard for Anti-Rubella Immunoglobulin, Human,
1996.
The MAGO 4S Automated EIA and IFA Processor is a design enhancement to the
existing MAGO Plus Automated EIA Processor, legally marketed under K973177.
MAGO 4S, the Diamedix Automated EIA and IFA Processor has been designed to
work specifically with Diamedix Immunosimplicity® Test Kits. The MAGO 4S is
designed to minimize manual operations associated with performing routine
laboratory analysis by mechanizing and computerizing the test process.
For IFA sessions, the MAGO 4S prepares the slide; however, the reading activity is
undertaken outside of the instrument, by a qualified Operator with the aid of a
fluorescence microscope and/or digital camera.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:

1. Predicate device name(s):
The Diamedix Immunosimplicity® (Is) Rubella IgG EIA Test Kit was previously
cleared within K981729. The subject of the current review is the assessment of
the MAGO 4S Automated EIA and IFA Processor when used in conjunction with
the Rubella IgG EIA Test Kit. For comparative purposes, the Rubella IgG EIA
Test Kit used with the automatic EIA processor MAGO 4S system was compared
to the previously cleared manual-use version of the device (K981729).
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):
See K981729
3. Comparison with predicate:
See K981729 and below, under “Additional studies performed to assess the
MAGO 4S instrumentation”.
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

L. Test Principle:
Diluted samples are incubated with rubella antigen bound to the solid surface of a
microtiter well. If IgG antibodies against rubella are present in the patient sample they
will bind to the antigen on the well forming antigen-antibody complexes. Residual
sample is eliminated by aspirating and washing. Conjugate (horse-radish peroxidase-
labeled anti-human IgG) is added and will bind to these complexes. Unbound
conjugate is removed by aspiration and washing. Substrate is then added and
incubated. In the presence of bound enzyme the substrate is converted to an end
product. The absorbance of this end product can be read spectrophotometrically at
450 nm (reference 600-630 nm) and is directly proportional to the concentration of
IgG antibodies to rubella antigen present in the sample. Three standard and three
control reagents, all provided within the test, are used to calibrate and measure the
assay results.

Positive and negative agreement with comparator:
A total of 208 sera, including at least 50 samples with Rubella IgG on the 10-
20 IU/mL concentration range, 50 samples with a >20 IU/mL concentration,
and 80 with <9 IU/mL, were tested with the Diamedix Is Rubella IgG Test Kit
once manually and once on the Mago 4S instrument.

Positive Percent Agreement*: 97% (98/101) 95% CI: 92%-99%
Negative Percent Agreement*: 84.2% (80/95) 95% CI: 75%-90%
* Equivocal results are counted against the Mago 4S in the calculations.
Assessment of equivocal zone results:
To assess the variability due to equivocal results, a total of 20 patient samples
identified in a requested (retest) zone that tested manually between 7 and 13
IU/mL, were re-tested twice for the presence of rubella IgG antibodies using
the Diamedix Is Rubella IgG Test Kit at Diamedix Corp., Miami, FL. The 20
samples included within the 7-13 IU/ml range were selected based on the
largest difference/changed status between manual and MAGO 4S testing.
Testing was performed on the MAGO 4S Automated EIA Processor and
manually. The mean of the 3 total (quantitative) results for the manual test and
the mean of the total 3 (quantitative) results for the MAGO 4S were
calculated, and PPA and NPA results were evaluated.

CDC Performance Panel Results
A serum panel provided by the CDC containing 100 samples was tested for
the presence of rubella IgG antibodies using the Diamedix Is-Rubella IgG
Test Kit at Diamedix Corp., Miami, FL. Testing was performed on the MAGO
4S Automated EIA Processor. The subsequent data was sent to the CDC for
evaluation, and the results of this evaluation are summarized below. The panel
includes 9 negative sera resulting in 18 negative specimens and 41 positive
sera resulting in 82 positive specimens. The assay run on this sera panel
resulted in satisfactory results of 82/82 positive tests on 82 positive sera and
18/18 negative tests on18 negative sera.
CDC Biological Standard Results
The CDC Low-Titer Anti Rubella Human Reference Serum, CDC Biological
Standard was used to verify the Diamedix Rubella IgG assay performance.
The CDC standard is set at a neat concentration of 21.0 IU/mL of Rubella IgG
antibody. A dilution series (1:2, 1:4, and 1:8) was performed in duplicate. The
mean result of the two-fold diluted standard was 14.1 IU/mL, which is in
reasonable agreement with the CDC immunity cut-off reference level.

5. Calibration:
The dispense probe calibration is to be done every three months. The MAGO
Calibration Check Kit is used to verify the precision and repeatability of the
dispense probe. A p-nitrophenol (pNP) calibration dye is diluted into each ofthe
96 wells, with the optical density (OD) subsequently measured by the plate
reader. The mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) of
the OD measurements are provided.
Field service personnel calibrate the plate reader every six months.
6. Quality Control:
Quality control is addressed for each separately cleared specific assay to be run on
the instrument.
