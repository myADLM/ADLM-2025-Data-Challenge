4. Panel:
91 (Toxicology)
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The DRI® Amphetamines Assay is intended for the qualitative or
semiquantitative determination of amphetamine and methamphetamine in human
urine. The assay has cutoff levels of 500 and 1000 ng/mL. The assay provides a
simple and rapid analytical screening procedure for detecting amphetamine and
methamphetamine in urine on automated clinical analyzers. The assay is
calibrated with methamphetamine.
This assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific
alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a con firmed
analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the
preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment
should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary
positive results are used.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
This assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific
alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed
analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the
preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment
should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary
positive results are used.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The studies in the submission were performed on the Olympus AU680.
I. Device Description:
The DRI Amphetamines Assay is a liquid ready-to-use homogeneous enzyme
immunoassay. The assay uses specific antibodies, which can detect amphetamine
and/or methamphetamine in urine with minimal cross-reactivity to various over-the-
counter structurally unrelated compounds.

L. Test Principle:
The assay is based on the competition of an enzyme glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PDH) labeled drug and the drug from the urine sample for a fixed
amount of specific antibody binding sites. In the absence of free drug from the
sample, the specific antibody binds the drug labeled with G6PDH and causes a
decrease in enzyme activity. In the presence of free drug, the free drug occupies the
antibody binding sites, allowing the drug-labeled G6PDH to interact with the
substrate, resulting in enzyme activity. This phenomenon creates a direct relationship
between drug concentration in urine and the enzyme activity. The enzyme activity is

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Drug free urine was spiked to 2000 ng/mL with methamphetamine, then
diluted in 10% increments with drug free urine and analyzed using the semi-
quantitative DRI Amphetamines assay. The measured results were within
±4% of the expected values for all concentrations tested. A linear regression
calculation was performed and resulted in a slope of 0.984, a y-intercept of
13.87 ng/mL, and a correlation coefficient of 0.999. The results are
summarized below.

The assay is calibrated to methamphetamine and five level calibrators were
cleared under 510(k) number k983159. All calibrators can be used to generate
a semi-quantitative result, or either the 500 ng/mL or 1000 ng/mL calibrator

negative samples.
Controls were previously cleared under 510(k) number k040758.
The sponsor provided the stability study protocols for reagent stability studies
conducted at 2-8°C. On-board stability studies demonstrated that the reagents are
stable for 60 days when stored on the analyzer as claimed in the package insert.
d. Detection limit:
Performance at low drug concentrations in the semi-quantitative assay was
characterized by determination of recovery (see section b above).
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity was evaluated by spiking compounds into drug free urine and
tested in the qualitative and semi quantitative assays. The compounds,
concentrations tested, and results are summarized below.
The following compounds produced a positive result at the concentrations
shown in the table.

f. Assay cut-off:
There are two cutoff concentrations claimed for both amphetamine and
methamphetamine: 500 ng/mL and 1000 ng/mL.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor conducted a method comparison study to evaluate the performance
of the device for d-amphetamine and d-methamphetamine. The DRI
amphetamines assay recognizes both amphetamine and methamphetamine
equivalently and does not discriminate between the two drugs. This study
evaluated 160 unaltered clinical samples by the DRI amphetamines assay and
compared the results separately to GC/MS results for amphetamine and
methamphetamine. The agreement between amphetamine GC/MS results and
methamphetamine GC/MS results and the new device results for both qualitative
and semi-quantitative modes of the device are listed in the tables below.

samples with a d-amphetamine GC/MS concentration below the cutoff, in
which the observed result on the DRI amphetamines assay was positive.

The method comparison samples were categorized based upon the d-
methamphetamine GC/MS concentration only. The table below identifies
those samples with a d-methamphetamine GC/MS concentration below the
cutoff, in which the observed result on the DRI amphetamines assay was
positive.
