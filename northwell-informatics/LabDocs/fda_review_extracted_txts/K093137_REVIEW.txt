L. Test Principle:
Human serum or plasma is mixed with a suspension of latex particles coated with
purified goat anti-human cystatin C polyclonal antibodies. The resulting immune
complexes are measured by turbidimetry. The signal generated is correlated with the
concentration of cystatin C in the sample. By interpolation on a standard curve, the
concentration of cystatin C in the sample is calculated. The K-ASSAY Cystatin C
assay is analyzed using a two-reagent clinical chemistry analyzer.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were conducted using the Roche/Hitachi 917 chemistry
analyzer following CLSI EP5-A2 guidelines. Three control samples and one
human serum specimen containing cystatin C at various levels were evaluated
in duplicate twice a day for twenty days. Calculated means, standard
deviations, and coefficients of variation (CV) are shown below:

human serum. The linearity test was performed following CLSI EP6-A
guidelines. The calculated cystatin C concentrations ranged from 0.05 to 8.0
mg/L. Samples were measured in quadruplicate on the Roche/Hitachi 917
chemistry analyzer using one reagent lot. Least-square regression analysis
resulted in a linear correlation of Y=1.017X - 0.008 and a correlation
coefficient (r) of 1.0. Nonlinearity was further assessed based on CLSI EP6-A
guidelines by comparison to a pre-defined goal of 10% deviation. The K-
ASSAY Cystatin C assay was demonstrated to be linear throughout the
claimed measuring range of 0.4-8.0 mg/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There is no internationally recognized reference standard for cystatin C. The
K-ASSAY Cystatin C assay is traceable to an in-house standard that was
developed from purified human recombinant cystatin C. The cystatin C
concentration of this standard was determined by its optical density at 280 nm
and its individual extinction coefficient. The cystatin C value assignment for
the calibrators is performed by testing serial dilutions of source material and
evaluating linearity and recovery against the in-house standard. The cystatin C
value assignment for the controls is carried out using the K-ASSAY Cystatin
C reagent and calibrators using the Roche/Hitachi 917 chemistry analyzer.
After calibration, controls are assayed in two runs per day on two separate
days. The levels of cystatin C are assigned to each control based on the
average of all runs.
The stability of the K-ASSAY Cystatin C reagent, calibrator, and control were
demonstrated with real-time stability studies. The unopened shelf life is
twelve months for the reagent, twelve months for the calibrator, and twelve
months for the controls when stored at the recommended temperature of 2 to
8°C. The open-vial stability is one month for the reagent, two weeks for the
calibrator, and two weeks for the controls when stored at the recommended
temperature of 2 to 8°C. An on-board stability study confirmed that the
reagent is stable for thirty days on-board the Roche/Hitachi 917 analyzer.
d. Detection limit:
Limits of Blank (LoB) and Limits of Detection (LoD) for the K-ASSAY
Cystatin C assay were evaluated using CLSI EP17-A guideline. Studies were
performed on the Roche/Hitachi 917 analyzer.

e. Analytical specificity:
Two serum samples containing cystatin C at concentrations of 0.8 and 2.2
mg/L were evaluated with the K-ASSAY Cystatin C assay on the
Roche/Hitachi 917 analyzer for the effect of interferences based on CLSI
EP7-A2 guidelines. The following substances demonstrated no significant
interference based on acceptance criteria: ± 10% deviation from control value:

A matrix comparison study was performed by splitting 57 human samples
containing cystatin C concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 7.9 mg/L into three
aliquots (serum, EDTA plasma, lithium-heparinized plasma) and testing with
the K-ASSAY Cystatin C assay on the Roche/Hitachi 917 analyzer. A total of
7 samples were diluted or spiked to obtain low and high cystatin C
concentrations. Results from the EDTA plasma and lithium-heparin plasma
aliquots were individually compared to the results obtained with the serum
aliquot. Least-square regression analysis yielded the following results:
