I. Device Description:
The Breath Alcohol Detector is a visually read semi-quantitative test for the
detection of alcohol in exhaled breath. It indicates relative Blood Alcohol
Concentration (BAC) at six different cut-off levels. The device consists of a
plastic tube, a glass vial encased with reaction crystals (glass ampoule containing
reaction granules), two plastic plugs, a blow bag (optional) and a tube label. The
tube label indicates the specific cut-off level for each detector. Results are
obtained by comparing majority of the color of the crystals with a color block
printed on the tube label. The tubes are disposable and intended for one-time use.
The Breath Alcohol Detector is available with or without blow bags. The blow
bag is an optional item that may be inserted into one end of the device to provide
visual confirmation that the user has blown adequate amount of air into the
detector.

L. Test Principle:
The Breath Alcohol Detector consists of crystals that employ a solid-phase chemistry
system based on a chromogenic chemical reaction. Alcohol, if present in the exhaled
breath, reacts with the coated crystals to produce a color change. This color change is
proportional to the concentration of alcohol in the breath, which is an approximation
of relative Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC). The light yellow crystals produce a
color change when alcohol vapors are oxidized to acid and the indicator chemical
changes to chromic ion. Results are interpreted as positive when the majority of the
crystals change from yellow to green. This indicates that alcohol vapors are present
at a concentration greater than or equal to the cut-off indicated on the detector.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The Mission Breath Alcohol Detectors were not eligible for testing by the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) (Department of Transportation
(DOT)). The sponsor performed DOT-like testing using the guidelines found in the
August 2, 1994 and March 3, 2008 NHTSA/DOT Model Specifications for Alcohol
Screening Devices.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed precision and accuracy testing for each of the six cutoffs
using a Breath Alcohol Sample Simulator (BASS), which provides an alcohol-in-
air test sample with known alcohol concentrations, flow rate and air composition.
Testing was performed by twelve individuals under five different lighting sources
using three lots over three days. The concentrations used were 0% BAC, 50%
below the cut-off concentration and 50% above the cut-off concentration. The
table below lists the number of devices that resulted in the expected outcome
(positive or negative) of the number of devices evaluated.

Not applicable. The assay is semi-quantitative and does not report a numerical
concentration.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
These devices are traceable to a commercially available certified alcohol

d. Detection limit:
The NHTSA guidelines do not specifically address the detection limit of
breath alcohol devices but require testing at a % BAC of zero (blank reading)
to assess the possibility of false positives. The sponsor included a zero
concentration samples in their precision study above and no false positive
results were produced.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cigarette Smoke. The effect of cigarette smoke study on the device was
evaluated with and without blow bags by testing 5 participants per cutoff level
who have smoked ½ to 1 cigarette and have not had an alcoholic drink for the
last 24 hours. Each participant waited 15 minutes after smoking, then
performed the test themselves according to the package insert for each cut-off
level in 4 replicates. The devices produced no false positive results under
these conditions.
Temperature. The temperature effect on the device was evaluated with and
without blow bag using simulated breath sample at +/-50% of the cut-off
levels at 5o and 40o C. The BAC breath alcohol concentration in the simulated
breath (control air) was verified by an evidential-type breath alcohol detector.
The alcohol control gas was introduced into the detector until the blow bag
had inflated completely or the sample had been introduced for 12 seconds.
The results were then read under fluorescent lighting at 2 minutes according to
the package insert. All the samples were tested in 20 replicates. The table
below summarizes the results using the blow bag:
Mission Breath Alcohol Detector Results with blow bag

0.10% 20/20 Negative 20/20 Positive 20/20 Negative 20/20 Positive
The results were identical when the study was repeated using testers without
blow bags.
Vibration. The effect of vibration on the device was evaluated with and
without blow bags using a shake table with a vibration time of 2.5 minutes.
After vibration, performance was tested using simulated breath samples at +/-
50% of the cut-off levels. The BAC breath alcohol concentration was verified

f. Assay cut-off:
Each device will produce a green color at or above the cut-off concentrations
of 0.02%, 0.04%, 0.05%, 0.06%, 0.08% or 0.10% BAC.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor conducted a consumer study comparing the Mission Breath
Alcohol Detector at 0.04% BAC to a quantitative comparator device. Results
were collected with and without blow bags. The purpose of the study was to
determine if consumers could correctly perform and interpret the test
according to the package insert. There were 32 participants who consumed
alcohol as part of the study paired with 32 non-drinkers who read the results.
Each drinker provided four breath samples over the course of the study for a
total of 128 comparisons. There were 30 males and 34 females who
participated in the trial. Educational background is as follows:
Middle High
Elementary College
Education School School
2 1 11 50
The non-drinker administered the test to the drinker and then read the results.
The drinker then provided another breath sample, which was analyzed using
the quantitative device operated by a trained individual. The breath alcohol
concentrations ranged from a BAC of 0.000% to 0.127% by the comparator
device.
Results using the blowbag and read by laypersons were as follows:
