3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The devices are for prescription use.
The Wondfo One Step Buprenorphine, Oxycodone, and Propoxyphene Urine
Tests provide only preliminary analytical test results. A more specific alternative
chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Liquid
chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) or gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry (GC/MS) are the preferred confirmatory methods. Other chemical
confirmation methods are available. Clinical consideration and professional
judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when
preliminary positive results are used.
These devices are designated for central laboratory use only.
Tests for buprenorphine cannot distinguish between abused drugs and certain
prescribed medications.
4. Special instrument requirements:
There are no instrument requirements. The devices are visually read single-use
devices.
I. Device Description:
The devices are for use in human urine. The Wondfo Buprenorphine, Oxycodone,
and Propoxyphene assays are single-test test strips.
For the test strips, users dip the strip into the urine and the reaction is initiated by
movement of the sample through the test strip.
The test strips include a procedural control for each test to indicate that the assay is
working correctly. Negative and positive results are determined by the presence or
absence of a line in the test portion of the device. Users read the results at a specified
time after the addition of the urine sample to the device.

L. Test Principle:
Each assay (buprenorphine, oxycodone, propoxyphene) employs lateral flow
immunochromatographic technology.
Buprenorphine, oxycodone, or propoxyphene are detected in human urine by
competitive binding between mouse monoclonal antibodies to one of its respective
drug and drug-labeled conjugate (containing a chromagen). Binding of the drug in
the sample causes the absence of a line at the test area, i.e., a positive result. When
drug is not present in the sample, the drug-labeled conjugate binds at the test line,
resulting in formation of a line, i.e., a negative result. The absence or presence of the
line is determined visually by the operator.
The device also has an internal process control (mouse monoclonal anti-IgG) which
indicates that an adequate volume of sample has been added and that the
immunochromatographic strip is intact.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was assessed with three lots of Wondfo test strips tested by three
users over five consecutive days. Seven separate normal urine samples were
spiked with the target drug at concentrations of 0, -50% cutoff, -25% cutoff,
cutoff, + 25% cutoff, +50% cutoff and +200% cutoff. Target levels were
confirmed by GC/MS. All samples were blinded to the users and tested
randomly. Each operator performed a total of 75 samples for each
concentration for each of the three drugs. Results were as follows:

d. Detection limit:
Analytical performance of the device around the cutoff is described in the
precision section See 1.a. above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Structurally-related compounds:
Buprenorphine, Oxycodone and Propoxyphene were each tested in duplicate
for structurally related compounds using 3 lots of test strips. Structurally
related compounds at 100,000 ng/mL were added to drug-free urine. Any
compounds demonstrating interference were serially diluted and tested to
determine the lowest concentration that produced a positive result. Cross-
reactivity was calculated by dividing the concentration at which the compound
yielded a positive result by the designated cut-off concentration and
multiplying by 100%. Other drugs or drug metabolites not listed may
interfere with Buprenorphine, Oxycodone or Propoxyphene assays and cause
false results. The results are summarized below:

The effect of pH on the Wondfo One-Step Buprenorphine, Oxycodone and
Propoxyphene devices was determined by spiking a negative urine pool with
the target drugs at 50% below the cutoffs and 50% above the cutoffs. pH was
adjusted in increments of 1 pH unit across the range from 3.0-10.0 and each
urine was tested in duplicate with three lots of test strips. No interference
from pH was observed at pH levels of 4.0 to 9.0.
f. Assay cut-off:
Cutoff concentrations are:
Device Cut-off Concentration
Wondfo One-Step Buprenorphine 10 ng/mL
Wondfo One-Step Oxycodone 100 ng/mL
Wondfo One-Step Propoxyphene 300 ng/mL
Cutoff studies were performed for buprenorphine, oxycodone and
propoxyphene using a combination of clinical and spiked samples for each
drug (n=150 per drug). The testing protocol was identical for each drug.
25 clinical samples were collected for each of the three drugs. Concentrations
of buprenorphine, oxycodone or propoxyphene in the samples were
determined by GC/MS. An additional 125 drug free negative samples were
obtained for each drug and spiked with either buprenorphine, oxycodone or
propoxyphene at -50% cutoff, -25% cutoff, cutoff, +25% cutoff, and +50 %
cutoff. Absence of any drugs in the negative urines and concentrations after
spiking were confirmed by GC/MS.
5 clinical samples and 25 spiked samples were tested at each concentration for
each drug in replicates of 30 using three strip lots (n=90) and 3 operators.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies for buprenorphine, oxycodone and propoxyphene
were evaluated in the same manner using all natural urine samples using one
lot of test strips and three operators. 10 samples were negative for all three
drugs. 40 samples ranging from less than 50% cutoff to the cutoff and 40
samples ranging from cutoff to greater than 50% cutoff were evaluated. The
test strip results were compared to GC/MS.
Discrepant samples were analyzed by GC/MS. Metabolites detected for
buprenorphine were buprenorphine and nor-buprenorphine. Oxycodone
detected only oxycodone, and propoxyphene detected both d-propoxyphene
and d nor-propoxyphene. The results obtained by each user with the Wondfo
One-Step devices, including discrepant results compared to GC/MS are
below.
