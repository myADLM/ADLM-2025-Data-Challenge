It is recommended that specimens found to be negative for respiratory syncytial virus
after examination of the direct specimen result be confirmed by cell culture.
Specimens found to be negative for human metapneumovirus after examination of the
direct specimen results should be confirmed by an FDA-cleared human
metapneumovirus molecular assay. Negative results do not preclude respiratory
syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus infection and should not be used as the
sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other management decisions.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Fluorescence microscope with the appropriate filter combination for FITC (excitation
peak = 490 nm, emission peak = 520 nm) and for R-PE; magnification 200-400X.
I. Device Description:
The D3 FastPoint L-DFA RSV/MPV Identification Kit uses a blend (called a “L-DFA
Reagent”) of viral antigen-specific murine monoclonal antibodies that are directly
labeled with either R-PE (respiratory syncytial virus) or fluorescein (human
metapneumovirus) for the rapid identification of respiratory syncytial virus and
human metapneumovirus in nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs and aspirates/washes
from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection.
Kit Components:
2

--- Page 3 ---
1. D3 FastPoint L-DFA RSV/MPV Reagent, 4.0-mL. One dropper bottle containing
a mixture of PE-labeled murine monoclonal antibodies directed against respiratory
syncytial virus antigens and FITC-labeled murine monoclonal antibodies directed
against human metapneumovirus antigens. The buffered, stabilized, aqueous solution
contains Evans Blue and propidium iodide as counter-stains and 0.1% sodium azide as
preservative.
2. 40X PBS Concentrate, 25-mL. One bottle of 40X PBS concentrate containing 4%
sodium azide (0.1% sodium azide after dilution to 1X using de-mineralized water).
3. Re-suspension Buffer, 6.0-mL. One bottle of a buffered glycerol solution and
0.1% sodium azide.
4. D3 FastPoint L-DFA RSV/MPV Antigen Control Slides, 5-slides. Five
individually packaged control slides containing 2 wells with cell culture-derived
positive and negative control cells. Each positive well contains cells infected with
either respiratory syncytial virus, or human metapneumovirus. The negative wells
contain non-infected cells. Each slide is intended to be stained only one time.
5. D3FastPoint L-DFA Specimen Slides and Coverslips, 50-slides with coverslips.
Fifty pack of 3-well specimen slides.
An overview of the procedure is as follows:
The cells to be tested are derived from respiratory specimens from patients with signs
and symptoms of respiratory infection. The cells are permeablized and stained
concurrently in a liquid suspension format with the L-DFA Reagent. After incubating
at 35ºC to 37ºC for 5 minutes, the stained cell suspensions are rinsed with 1 X PBS.
The rinsed cells are pelleted by centrifugation and then re-suspended with the Re-
Suspension Buffer and loaded onto a specimen slide well. The cells are examined
using a fluorescence microscope. Cells infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
will exhibit golden yellow fluorescence due to the PE. Cells infected with human
metapneumovirus (hMPV) will exhibit apple-green fluorescence due to the FITC.
Non-infected cells will exhibit red fluorescence due to the Evans Blue counter-stain.
Nuclei of intact cells will exhibit orange-red fluorescence due to the propidium iodide.

with either R-PE (respiratory syncytial virus) or fluorescein (human metapneumovirus)
for the rapid identification of respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus in
nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs and aspirates/washes from patients with signs and
symptoms of respiratory infection.
The cells to be tested are derived from respiratory specimens from patients with signs and
symptoms of respiratory infection. The cells are permeablized and stained concurrently in
a liquid suspension format with the L-DFA Reagent. After incubating at 35ºC to 37ºC for
5 minutes, the stained cell suspensions are rinsed with 1 X PBS. The rinsed cells are
pelleted by centrifugation and then re-suspended with the Re-Suspension Buffer and
loaded onto a specimen slide well. The cells are examined using a fluorescence
microscope. Cells infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) will exhibit golden
yellow fluorescence due to the PE. Cells infected with human metapneumovirus (hMPV)
will exhibit apple-green fluorescence due to the FITC. Non-infected cells will exhibit red
fluorescence due to the Evans Blue counter-stain. Nuclei of intact cells will exhibit
orange-red fluorescence due to the propidium iodide.
It is recommended that specimens found to be negative for respiratory syncytial virus
after examination of the direct specimen result be confirmed by cell culture. Specimens
found to be negative for human metapneumovirus after examination of the direct
specimen results should be confirmed by an FDA-cleared human metapneumovirus
molecular assay.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Assay precision, intra-assay variability and inter assay variability were assessed
with a reproducibility panel of proficiency-level antigen control slides. The
reproducibility panel consisted of 5 randomized panel members.
The RSV/hMPV panel consisted of the following:
a. Low level RSV (Washington strain) infected cells.
b. Low level hMPV (A1 subtype) infected cells.
c. Low level RSV (Washington strain) infected cells mixed with mid
level hMPV (A1 subtype) infected cells.
d. Low level hMPV (A1 subtype) infected cells mixed with mid level
RSV (Washington strain) infected cells.
e. Mid level non-infected (negative) cells.
The low level is estimated to contain between 4 to 10% infected cells in the
sample. The mid level is estimated to contain between 20 to 25% infected cells in
the sample. Each sample contains 2.5 x105 to 3.5 x105total cells.
6

--- Page 7 ---
The panel was tested daily in two separate runs for 5-days by four different
laboratories (40 total runs). The following results were recorded:
a. Presence or absence of golden-yellow fluorescence.
b. Percent of cells exhibiting golden-yellow fluorescence.
c. Presence or absence of apple-green fluorescence.
d. Percent of cells exhibiting apple-green fluorescence.
Note: “Processing of specimen”, although a source of variability, was done
according to each laboratory’s established practices. The product insert for this
device instructs the laboratory to process a specimen according to Clinical
Microbiology Handbook (H.D. Isenberg, 2004, publ. by ASM; sections 10.7.1-
10.7.10). As such, testing reproducibility of “processing of specimen” is beyond
the scope of this reproducibility study. This study accessed reproducibility of the
test alone, i.e., “chemistry of assay” (DFA staining) and “interpretation of result”.
“Interpretation of result” is considered to be the largest source for variability for
this test. Interpretation of test is subjective, according to potential variability in an
individual technician’s competence, experience, and/or diligence in microscopic
evaluations of stained cells.
A total of 280 data points were included in the reproducibility study data analysis
(1 panel X 7 members/run X 2 runs/day X 5 days X 4 sites = 280).
For the D3 FastPoint L-DFA RTSV/MPV Reagent, the combined data from the
four Study Sites demonstrated reproducible detection of RSV by the R-PE labeled
MAbs and reproducible detection of hMPV by the FITC-labeled MAbs. The
presence of RSV infected cells was reported in 100% (120/120) of the wells in
which the infected cells were expected. The presence of hMPV infected cells was
reported in 100% (120/120) of the wells in which the infected cells were expected.
The absence of infected cells was reported in 100% (40/40) of the wells in which
infected cells were not present. The total percent agreement for the D3 FastPoint
L-DFA RSV/MPV Reagent was 100% (280/280):

An antibody may exhibit high affinity for its target antigen until labeled with a
reporter moiety such as PE due to blocking or modification of the antigen-binding
site. Each of the two RSV MAbs were labeled with PE. The individual PE-labeled
MAbs were used to stain acetone-fixed RSV in order to verify that each of the
MAbs remains reactive with its target after labeling with PE. The same model
cells were stained concurrently with FITC-labeled MAbs for comparison. This

Cell Permeablization and Counterstaining
Selection of Permeablization Reagent
The D3 FastPoint L-DFA RSV/MPV Identification Kit uses Sapogenin to
permeablize the cell membrane instead of acetone to allow the MAbs to react with
their respective antigens. Permeablization involves treatment of cells with a mild
surfactant. This treatment will dissolve portions of the cell membranes and allow
larger dye molecules and antibodies access to the cell's interior. This allows the
cells to maintain their three dimensional structure while being stained with labeled
antibodies and counter-stain. By doing this, cells can remain in liquid suspension.
Studies were conducted to compare performance using acetone with that using
another permeablizing reagent, Sapogenin. Sapogenins are the aglycones, or non-
saccharide portions of the family of natural products known as saponins. The
amphipathic nature of saponins gives them activity as surfactants that can be used
to enhance penetration of macromolecules such as proteins through cell
membranes. Using influenza A virus and influenza B virus and respiratory
10

--- Page 11 ---
syncytial virus model cells, acetone and Sapogenin were tested at various
concentrations. Acetone was tested at concentrations from 20% to 100%.
Sapogenin was used at 0.1% based on what has been published in the literature.
Data generated from the study indicated that at all acetone concentrations
Sapogenin had greater numbers of infected cells in the liquid format. Based on
these studies, Sapogenin was chosen as the Permeablization reagent in the D3
FastPoint L-DFA RSV/MPV kit.
Determination of Sapogenin Concentration
Experiments were conducted to optimize the concentration of Sapogenin in the D3
FastPoint L-DFA RSV/MPV Identification Kit. Non-infected model cells were
treated with different concentrations of Sapogenin and counter-stain for 5-minutes.
The cells were then counted, and the values compared. Data generated from the
study indicated that there was no difference in numbers of cells when Sapogenin
concentrations at 0.1% to 0.025% were used. When 0.2% Sapogenin was used,
reduced numbers of cells were noted, which was an indication that Sapogenin at
that concentration may cause cell disruption. The 0.1% level was chosen to be
used in the D3 FastPoint L-DFA RSV/MPV kit to better ensure adequate
Permeablization of clinical nasal pharyngeal cells.
Propidium Iodide Counter-stain
To assist the end user in the use of the D3 FastPoint L-DFA RSV/MPV kit,
improvement to the counter-staining of cells was developed. Propidium Iodide
was added to the D3 FastPoint L-DFA RSV/MPV Reagent. The stained cell’s
nuclei fluoresce red. This improves the ability to assess specimen quality
compared to standard acetone fixation, Evans Blue stained DSFA specimens.
Subjective studies were conducted to determine the optimal concentration of
Propidium Iodide. Higher concentrations of Propidium Iodide (16-μg/mL or
higher) began interfering with the ability to see low level fluorescence generated
by either the PE- or FITC-stained cells. Lower levels of Propidium Iodide (4-
μg/mL or lower) made it difficult to see the stained nuclei. 8-μg/mL was the
optimal concentration to allow easy identification of cells with no quenching of
PE or FITC fluorescence. A low level of Evans Blue (25-μg/mL compared to 250-
μg/mL in each of the predicate respiratory devices) is also included to help reduce
background of non-specific antibody staining sometimes seen in clinical
specimens.
Reagent Interference Studies of MAbs
Studies were conducted to demonstrate that the final blend of PE- and FITC-
labeled MAbs in the D3 FastPoint L-DFA RSV/MPV kit did not affect the ability
to detect low level positive infected cells that are stained by one fluor when they
are in the same sample, with a high level of positive infected cells which are
11

--- Page 12 ---
stained by the other fluor in the same well. The following cell preparations were
permeablized and stained with the appropriate reagent.
For the RSV/ MPV Reagent:
a. Low level (~25 or lower infected cells) infected RSV model cells were spiked
into non-infected cells.
b. Low level RSV model cells were spiked into high level (4 +) hMPV model
cells.
c. Low level (~25 or lower infected cells) infected hMPV model cells were
spiked into non-infected cells.
d. Low level hMPV model cells were spiked into high level (4+) of RSV model
cells.
The following table summarizes the study data for the D3 FastPoint L-DFA
RSV/MPV kit:
Staining Interference of High Level Infected Model Cells
Infected Cell Average Infected
Test Condition Counts of Low Cell Counts of Low
Level Model Cells Level Model Cells
Low RSV model cells in non-infected cells 28,12,12 17.3
Low RSV in High hMPV model cells 14,12,8 11.3
Low hMPV virus model cells in non-infected 5,1,5 3.6
cells
Low hMPV virus in High RSV model cells 4,0,3 2.3
For each combination of low level infected cells spiked into high level of infected
cells, there was not a significant difference in detection compared to the low level
positive cells spiked into non-infected cells (control).
Binding Competition Studies of MAbs
The D3 FastPoint L-DFA RSV/MPV kit contains 2 RSV MAbs and 3 hMPV
MAbs. The purpose of combining two or three MAbs specific per virus is to
ensure that all strains will be detected. Studies were conducted to determine if the
individual MAbs compete with one another for the same binding sites since
originally, the clones were selected for their individual and highest level of
staining intensity of the respective virus antigens.
Model cells of RSV and hMPV were permeablized. Cells were stained with each
unlabeled clone of the appropriate virus. The cells were then stained with the PE-
or FITC-labeled MAbs for each pair. Labeled MAbs were used individually, each
at their standard concentrations used in the assay.

Results of the study indicated that there was no evidence of self or cross epitope
blocking for all the pairs of MAbs.
Stability Studies
Shelf life for the complete kit
Kits were tested at time intervals during storage according to the study plan.
Characteristics monitored were performance, as well as pH, color and clarity.
Among the acceptance criteria was fluorescence (as opposed to no fluorescence)
observed in processed, infected model cells at a high level of infection (2+ to 4+)
for each of the D3 FastPoint L-DFA RSV/MPV Kit Reagents at 1:16 dilution.
Stability studies have been conducted in two phases: (1) using kits produced
during the development phase according to draft written procedures, and (2) using
kits produced according to established procedures by manufacturing staff (both
phases are on-going). To establish the final shelf life of the device, real-time
testing (under labeled storage conditions of 2°C to 8°C) is also being conducted.
As of August 2009, stability has been demonstrated to 9 months. Additional
stability studies are currently being conducted to establish a 20°C to 25°C storage
shelf-life claim for the D3 FastPoint L-DFA RSV/MPV Reagents.
Shelf life for the D3 FastPoint L-DFA RSV/MPV Kit antigen control slides
The D3 FastPoint L-DFA RSV/MPV Identification Kit Antigen Control Slides are
prepared by combining infected cells (RSV and hMPV in one well). Non-infected
cells are spotted onto an additional well for a negative control for the reagent.
Stability studies are currently being conducted for the D3 FastPoint L-DFA
RSV/MPV Identification Kit Antigen Control Slides; however, since they are
prepared using the same procedure and same infected cell cultures as the control
slides in the D3Ultra Kit, a shelf life of 18 months is anticipated. Stability studies
have been conducted in two phases: (1) using slides produced during the
development phase according to draft written procedures, and (2) using slides
produced according to established procedures by manufacturing staff (both phases
are on-going). To establish shelf life of the device, real-time testing (under labeled
storage conditions of 2°C to 8°C) is also being conducted. As of August 2009,
stability has been demonstrated to 9 months. Additional real-time stability studies
are currently being conducted to establish a 20°C to 25°C storage shelf-life claim
for all L-DFA Reagents. As of August 2009, stability has also been demonstrated
to 9 months for the 20°C to 25°C storage shelf-life claim.
d. Analytical Sensitivity (Detection limit):
Analytical Limit of Detections of the D3 FastPoint L-DFA RSV/MPV Kit was
addressed using dilution series of infected model cells. Model cells for RSV
(ATCC Washington strain) and hMPV A1 (clinical strain) were diluted with non-
13

--- Page 14 ---
infected cells to produce a suspension equivalent to 1,000 infected cells per
milliliter. This level theoretically yields approximately 25 infected cells per 25-μL
of suspension. This suspension was then serially diluted to a theoretical level of
less than 1 cell per milliliter. (NOTE: This level was the target to begin with a
low positive level. Actual starting levels vary, however, and are within 1 dilution
of the 25 infected cells target level). 25-µL aliquots from each dilution level were
spotted onto 10 replicate microscope slides, and then stained according to the
instructions for use described in the product insert. Each cell spot was examined
at 200x magnification. Results were reported as numbers of positive replicates for
each set of 10. Analytical detection limits for each of the 2 analytes were defined
as the lowest dilutions at which at least 9 out of 10 replicates were detected.
Results are summarized in the table below:

evaluated using 3 RSV and 4 hMPV strains. Low concentration infected cell
suspensions (approximately 4% cells infected, 25-50 infected cells) were prepared
for each viral strain. The suspensions were stained with the D3 FastPoint L-DFA

f. Analytical Specificity:
D3 FastPoint L-DFA RSV/MPV Identification Kit was tested for cross-
reactivity against a variety of microorganisms. Stringent conditions for cross-
reactivity testing were achieved by using both the 1.5 X concentration of
MAbs and relatively high titers of microorganisms. No cross-reactivity was
observed for 59 virus strains. Twenty-two (22) bacterial strains, one yeast, and
one Chlamydia sp. were also evaluated for cross-reactivity, including
Staphylococcus aureus, a protein-A-producing bacterium. Except for
Staphylococcus aureus, which was cross reactive with the D3 FastPoint L-
DFA RSV/MPV Kit, all other microorganisms tested negative.
Staining of S. aureus appeared as small points of fluorescence. The Protein A
produced by the bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus, may bind the Fc portion of
some fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibodies. Such binding can be
distinguished from viral antigen binding on the basis of morphology, i.e., S.
aureus-bound fluorescence appears as small (~1-micron diameter), bright dots.
Results from testing direct respiratory specimens with bacterial contamination
must be interpreted with caution. The following language was added to the
“Limitations of Procedure” section of the product insert to address this issue:
“Light background staining may occur with specimens contaminated with
Staphylococcus aureus strains containing large amounts of protein A.
Protein A will bind to the Fc portions of conjugated antibodies. Such
binding can be distinguished from viral antigen binding on the basis of
morphology, for example, S. aureus-bound fluorescence appears as small
(~1 micron diameter), bright dots. Therefore, results from testing direct
respiratory specimens with bacterial contamination must be interpreted
with caution.”
• Fifty-nine (59) virus strains were tested for cross reactivity.
Depending on the particular virus, 1.4 x 104 to 1.4 x 105 TCID viruses

were inoculated into multi-well plate cultures and incubated for 24 to
72 hours to yield a 1+ to 4+ cytopathic effect. For each virus, a
confirmation stain was done with the appropriate MAb to ensure the
desired titer was achieved. These cells were then prepared as Model
Cells (scraped and resuspended in UTM). Each cell suspension of
infected Model Cells was processed according to the D3 FastPoint L-
DFA RSV/MPV Identification Kit protocol, using 2X MAb and was
examined at 200X magnification. No cross reactivity was observed for

• Twenty four (24) microorganisms, including 22 bacterial, 1 yeast, and
1 Chlamydia sp. were tested for cross-reactivity. Bacteria were
cultured, processed as suspensions, then spiked into non-infected
Model Cells suspensions at levels (as CFUs, colony-forming units)
ranging from 1.6 x 109 to 3.5 x 1010 CFUs depending on the bacterium.
These suspensions of Model Cells with bacteria were then processed
according to the D3 FastPoint L-DFA RSV/MPV Identification Kit
protocol, using 2X MAb reagents. Except for Staphylococcus aureus,
which was cross reactive with the D3 FastPoint L-DFA RSV/MPV

detect hMPV RNA in a clinical specimen. This real time RT-PCR assay was
developed by DHI using a primer set and TaqMan probe as described in the
publication: Maertzdorf, J., CK Wang, JB Brown, JD Quinto, M Chu, M de
Graff, BG van den Hoogen, R Spaete, ADME Osterhaus, and RAM Fouchier.
“Real-time Reverse Transcriptase PCR Assay for Detection of Human
Metapneumoviruses from All Known Lineages” J. Clin. Microbiol.
2004:42:981-986. A nucleic acid (RNA) extraction procedure was also
developed and validated, as was the RT-PCR reaction,including primer sets, and
gel electrophoresis. Detection of an amplicon in the PCR end-product is
presumptive evidence of hMPV RNA presence in a specimen. The amplicons
were sequenced by a third party (Agencourt). DHI then compared these
sequences against an established/published set of hMPV sequences.
Confirmation of the hMPV RNA sequences in the amplicon was interpreted as
verification of hMPV RNA in the specimen.
Extraction of RNA from specimens is performed with Qiagen QIAamp Viral
RNA Mini Kit according to the manufacturer’s suggested protocol (section
12.4). Briefly, the sample is lysed under highly denaturing conditions to
inactivate RNase. RNA is then bound to the QIAamp membrane, washed several
times to remove contaminants, and eluted in 60 uL RNase-free buffer. The
Human Metapneumovirus Real-Time Reverse Transcription PCR Comparator
Assay master mix contains oligonucleotide primers and target specific
oligonucleotide probes. The primers are complementary to highly conserved
sequences within the nucleocapsid gene of hMPV. Reverse transcription of the
RNA in the sample into complementary DNA (cDNA) and subsequent
amplification of DNA is performed in a Stratagene Mx3000p instrument. In this
process, the probe anneals specifically to the template followed by primer
extension and amplification. The hMPV real-time RT-PCR Comparator Assay is
based on TaqMan chemistry, which utilizes the 5' - 3' exonuclease activity of the
Taq polymerase to cleave the probe thus separating the reporter dye from the
quencher. This generates an increase in fluorescent signal upon excitation from a
light source. With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved
from their respective probes, further increasing fluorescent signal. The amount
of fluorescence at any given cycle is dependent on the amount of amplification
products present at that time. Fluorescent intensity is monitored during each
PCR cycle by the Stratagene Mx3000p instrument.
Analytical Sensitivity
The analytical sensitivity of the hMPV real-time RT-PCR/Sequencing
Comparator Assay was determined for 4 hMPV strains (subtypes A1, A2, B1
and B2). Viral stocks of 4 hMPV strains (subtypes A1, A2, B1 and B2) were
generated in LLC-MK cultured cells. The viral stocks were frozen at -70° C.

--- Page 20 ---
The TCID /mL of each stock was determined by cell culture with monoclonal
50
antibody detection. A nasopharyngeal clinical matrix was created from
nasopharyngeal swabs placed in transport medium obtained from patients with
signs and symptoms of acute respiratory infection. The matrix was tested for the
presence of hMPV RNA using the hMPV real-time RT-PCR Comparator Assay.
Patient specimens found to be negative were pooled to create sufficient material
for all of the dilutions. The quantified viral stocks were diluted with the pooled
nasopharyngeal clinical matrix to produce a suspension equivalent to the
following TCID /mL levels: 1000, 500, 250, 100, 50, 10, 1, and 0.1. Each
50
TCID /mL level dilution was extracted 10 times (80 per hMPV strain) using the
50
Qiagen Viral RNA Mini Kit. The hMPV real-time RT-PCR/Sequencing
Comparator Assay was performed in singlet using 20-µL volumes of each
extraction. Analytical detection limits for each of the 4 hMPV genetic
sublineages were defined as the lowest dilutions at which at least 9 out of 10
replicates were detected. Detailed analytical sensitivity data for the hMPV real-
time RT-PCR/Sequencing Comparator Assay are presented in the following

Extraction Efficiency
The QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit extraction efficiency was determined by
extracting serial 10-fold dilutions of cRNA and comparing the actual copies of
cRNA in the eluate versus the calculated copies if 100% recovery. The actual
copies of cRNA were obtained from the qRT-PCR standard curve constructed
by a serial dilution of un-extracted cRNA standards. The extraction efficiency
ranges from 25 to 40%. The range was obtained from triplicate extractions
repeated over 3 days. Duplicate PCR reactions were performed on each dilution.
Detailed results of this study are presented in the following table:

Sample Freeze and Thaw Study
A study was performed to demonstrate that freezing the specimens would not
alter the performance of the hMPV real-time RT-PCR Comparator Assay.
Characterized hMPV isolates (subtypes A1, A2, B1, and B2) were spiked
separately into fresh nasopharyngeal swab and nasopharyngeal aspirate
specimens at known concentrations. The specimens were split into two aliquots:

Based on thorough analytical validations, the hMPV real-time RT-PCR
Comparator Assay is an acceptable method to be used to confirm all hMPV
negative samples as determined by the FDA cleared comparator DSFA
device (D Metapneumovirus DFA Reagent) in the DHI D3 FastPoint L-
3
DFA RSV/MPV Identification Kit Clinical Trial.
j. Bridging Study Comparing the Use of a Disposable Transfer Pipette to an
Adjustable Pipette
A limited bridging study of 20-specimens was performed comparing the use of a
disposable transfer pipette to an adjustable pipette. The specimens were split and
processed concurrently using both a disposable transfer pipette and an adjustable
pipette. The number of cells present for interpretation was equivalent for both
pipettes. Each pipette yielded sufficient cells to meet the requirement for
interpretation (a minimum of 20 columnar epithelia cells).

b. Matrix Description and Comparison:

3. Clinical studies:
a. Prospective Clinical Studies Testing Direct Respiratory Specimens
Performance of the D3 FastPoint L-DFA RSV/MPV Identification Kit testing direct
respiratory specimens were established during prospective studies at 4
geographically diverse U.S. clinical laboratories during the 2009 respiratory virus
season (January 2009 – March 2009). All specimens used in the studies meeting the
inclusion and exclusion criteria represented excess, remnants of respiratory
specimens that were prospectively collected from symptomatic individuals
suspected of respiratory infection, and were submitted for routine care or analysis by
each site, and that otherwise would have been discarded. Individual specimens were
delinked from all patient identifiers and given a study sample code. All clinical sites
were granted waivers of informed consent by their IRBs for this study.
Performance of the D3 FastPoint L-DFA RSV/MPV Kit detecting respiratory
syncytial virus from direct specimens was assessed and compared to DSFA testing
using FDA cleared comparator DSFA devices (D3Ultra DFA Respiratory Virus
Screening & ID Kit or D3Duet DFA RSV/Respiratory Virus Screening Kit),
followed by viral culture confirmation of all negative specimens (as determined by
24

--- Page 25 ---
the FDA cleared DSFA comparator devices), using FDA cleared DFA reagents.
“True” RSV positive was defined as any sample that either tested positive by the
comparator DSFA device or viral culture. “True” RSV negative was defined as any
sample that tested negative by both the comparator DSFA test and viral culture.
Performance of the D3 FastPoint L-DFA RSV/MPV Kit detecting human
metapneumovirus from direct specimens was assessed and compared to DSFA
testing using FDA cleared comparator DSFA device (D3Metapneumovirus DFA
Reagent), followed by confirmation of all frozen negative specimens (as determined
by the FDA cleared DSFA comparator device), using a validated hMPV real-time
RT-PCR followed by bi-directional sequencing analysis comparator assay. The
hMPV real-time RT-PCR comparator assay targets the hMPV Nucleocapsid gene.
“True” hMPV positive was defined as any sample that either tested positive by the
FDA cleared DSFA comparator device, or had bi-directional sequencing data
meeting pre-defined quality acceptance criteria that matched hMPV sequences
deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank
database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), with acceptable E-values. “True” hMPV
negative was defined as any sample that tested negative by both the FDA cleared
DSFA comparator device and the hMPV real-time RT-PCR comparator assay.
The E-values generated from the clinical trials range from a low of 5e-78 to a high
of 1e-20. The E-Value from NCBI BLAST Alignment indicates the statistical
significance of a given pair-wise alignment and reflects the size of the database and
the scoring system used. The lower the E-Value, the more significant the hit. A
sequence alignment that has an E-Value of 1e-3 means that this similarity has a 1 in
1000 chance of occurring by chance alone.
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=handbook.section.614).
Therefore an E-Value ranging from 1e-20 to 5e-78 has a very low probability of
occurring purely by chance.
Study Site 1 evaluated a total of 323 fresh respiratory specimens submitted, January
2009 through March 2009, to the laboratory for respiratory virus testing. Slides were
prepared from Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)-washed cells from the fresh
specimens and processed according to the prescribed protocol. The slides were
stained in accordance with the procedure in the product insert.

Of the 323 fresh respiratory specimens tested, all were nasal wash/nasopharyngeal
aspirate specimens. Of the 323 fresh nasal wash/nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens
tested, 2 nasal wash/nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens were excluded from the
performance analysis due to insufficient sample volume for the investigational
device testing (0.62%). Thirty-seven (37) specimens for RSV and 3 specimens for
hMPV were also excluded from the respective performance analysis due to
insufficient sample volume for the comparator culture or real-time RT-PCR method,
respectively, resulting in a total of 284 fresh nasal wash/nasopharyngeal aspirate

5. Expected values/Reference range:
In the D3 FastPoint L-DFA RSV/MPV Identification Kit multicenter prospective
clinical study testing direct respiratory specimens, a total of 1519 eligible
respiratory specimens were tested using the D3 FastPoint L-DFA RSV/MPV
Identification Kit from four U.S. clinical laboratories across the United States
during the 2009 respiratory virus seasons (January 2009 – March 2009).
Prevalence for each analyte (i.e., RSV and hMPV) as determined by the D3
FastPoint L-DFA RSV/MPV Identification Kit direct specimen testing varied
from 4.5% to 31.0% by site and averaged 13.4% for RSV; varied from 2.2% to
8.4% by site and averaged 5.1% for hMPV. The number and percentage of
positive cases determined by the D3 FastPoint L-DFA RSV/MPV Identification
Kit direct specimen testing, calculated by age group, are presented in the
following table:
