• ISO15197:2003- In vitro diagnostic test systems – Requirements for blood-glucose
monitoring systems for self-testing in managing diabetes mellitus.
L. Test Principle:
The test is based on electrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of capillary
action. The electrical current generated by the reaction of glucose with the reagent of the
strip is measured by the meter and is displayed as the corresponding blood glucose level.
The strength of the current produced by the reaction depends on the amount of glucose in
the blood sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-day precision studies were performed using venous whole blood samples
spiked with five different glucose concentrations, three different test strip lots, 10
AG-608 meters and 10 AG-610 meters. Each level was analyzed 10 times for a total
of 100 tests per each glucose level for each type of meter. Results are summarized

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using 11spiked whole blood samples ranging in glucose
concentrations from 18 to 605 mg/dL (18, 41, 72, 164, 221, 268, 332, 402, 503, 557,
605 mg/dL) as measured by YSI. Each level was measured 5 times and the values
from the AG-608 meter were compared with those obtained from YSI-2300. The
same evaluation was performed with the AG-610 meter with samples ranging from 17
to 613 mg/dL glucose (17, 56, 114, 168, 257, 346, 419, 472, 534, 581, 613 mg/dL) as
measured by YSI. Results from regression analysis:
AG-608 meter: y = 1.0265x - 4.916; R2 = 0.9946
AG-610 meter: y = 0.9772x + 7.2978; R2 = 0.9985.
The claimed range of measurement for this device is 20 to 600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor claims that the system accuracy of the AG-608 and AG-610 meters is
calibrated to a laboratory analyzer, YSI 2300.
Two levels of control material, Level II (96 to 144 mg/dL) and Level III (250 to 420
mg/dL) are available for use with this test system.
The controls are prepared in an aqueous matrix. The reference values are determined
using YSI 2300 then each control solution is tested 100 times using meter and test
strip combinations and the mean value, SD and CV calculated. The control solution
range is then determined for each manufactured lot and printed on the corresponding
test strip vial label.

Control solution stability was assessed with accelerated studies and on-going real-
time studies. Testing supports the claimed shelf life of 18 month shelf-life when
stored at 4-30°C (39 to 86°F) with relative humidity of <80% and a 90 day stability
after opening when stored at 4-30°C with relative humidity of <80 %.
c. Detection limit:
The reportable range for the AG-608 and AG-610 Blood Glucose Monitoring
Systems is 20 to 600 mg/dL. This range was verified by the linearity study (M.1.b).
d. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor spiked venous whole blood samples with glucose to obtain concentrations
of 80, 120, and 350 mg/dL. Each of these samples was divided into a test pool and a
control pool and each potential interfering substance was added to the test pool.
Each level was analyzed 5 times total with two AG-608 meters and 5 times total with
two AG-610 meters with 3 lots of glucose test strips. The % difference between the
interference containing sample and the control sample calculated. The sponsor
defines no significant interference as ≤10% difference. Results are presented in the
table below:
Potential Concentration Potential Concentration

The user manual and test strip insert state that the following substances at levels
greater than normal or therapeutic levels may cause significant interference:
acetaminophen, ascorbic acid, uric acid, dopamine and L-dopa. Do not use icterus
samples or high lipemia samples.
Hematocrit study:
The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated using whole blood samples
with hematocrit levels 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 and 55% spiked with glucose to achieve 7
concentrations ranging from 21 to 597 mg/dL. Each sample was then tested 4 times
using the AG-608 Blood Glucose meter and 3 times using the AG-610 meter. The

Altitude study:
Capillary whole blood samples from 20 volunteers with glucose concentrations
ranging from 66 to 403 mg/dL for the AG-608 meter and 62 to 422 mg/dL for the AG-
610 meter were tested at 11,975 feet (3650 meters). Results were compared to YSI
values and resulted in a % bias < 10% for all samples tested. The results support the
claims in the labeling that altitudes up to 11,975 feet have no significant effect on
blood glucose measurements from the AG-608 and AG-610 meters.
Temperature and humidity studies:
The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies using the AG-608 and the
AG-610 meter with low (40 mg/dL), normal (120 mg/dL) and high (350 mg/dL)
glucose level control solutions. Results demonstrated that both systems (meters and
test strips) can be used in conditions of 50 to 104°F (10 to 40°C) with relative
humidity < 80% and stored under conditions of 39 to 86°F and relative humidity of
<80%. The test strip labeling states to store the test strips in a cool dry place between
39 to 86°F.

User Performance Study:
To demonstrate the accuracy of the AG-608 and AG-610 blood glucose monitoring
systems the sponsor performed a study for each of the meters with 100 lay user
participants and one technician at two different hospitals . The participants, who
were able to read the User’s Manual in English were instructed to read the manual,
obtain their own finger stick sample and perform testing using the meter (AG-608 or
AG-610). The technician then performed the testing on an additional fingerstick
sample from the user. The samples ranged from 51.6 to 356 mg/dL for the AG-608
and 53.4 to 347 mg/dL for the AG-610. A sample was then taken from each
participant by the technician and measured by YSI-2300. The results are summarized
in the tables below:

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip.
Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip there are no special
handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
The meter uses a code bottle. To code the meter the code bottle, which is the test
strip vial, is plugged into the back of the meter. Once the “OK” appears on the
screen, the meter is coded. The same code bottle is used for both the AG-608 and
AG-610 meters. The user is instructed to compare the code number that appears on
the display with that printed on the test strip vial to confirm that the meter has been
coded properly.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor provides one level of glucose control solution, Level II, with this kit. An
additional Level III is available for purchase separately, as stated in the labeling. To
perform a control test the user is instructed to press the S button in step 5. Once the
“CTL” appears on the screen the control results will be prevented from being stored
in the memory. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip
vial label. If the control values fall outside these ranges, the user is referred to
customer support for problems and more information.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
None
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
