H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use statements below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The OPTI CCA-TS B-Lac cassette is intended to be used for in vitro
measurements of pH, PCO , PO , lactate (lactic acid), total hemoglobin (tHb),
2 2
and oxygen saturation (SO ), in heparinized whole blood samples (either arterial
2
or venous) on the OPTI CCA-TS system, in either a clinical setting or point-of-
care locations.
Measurements of blood gases (PCO , PO ) and blood pH are used in the
2 2
diagnosis and treatment of life-threatening acid-base disturbances. Lactate (lactic
acid) measurements that evaluate the acid-base status are used in the diagnosis
and treatment of lactic acidosis (abnormally high acidity of the blood). Total
hemoglobin measurement is used to determine the hemoglobin content of human
blood. Oxygen saturation measurements in conjunction with total hemoglobin
measurement helps distinguish normal from abnormal states of blood volume in
the detection of anemia and erythrocytosis.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only; for use in Point-of-Care settings; not for use with
sodium flouride.
4. Special instrument requirements:
OPTI CCA-TS Analyzer
I. Device Description:
The OPTI CCA-TS system is a portable [4.7 x 14.2 x 9.1 inches, 12 pounds],
microprocessor-based instrument using optical fluorescence for the measurement
blood gases, electrolytes and enzymes and utilizes a graphical touch screen interface.
There is an additional laser based measurement of total hemoglobin (tHb) and SO
2
capability available with any cassette that contains a pO sensor.

The OPTI CCA-TS B-Lac cassette is a disposable, single use cassette that contains
four (4) sensors for in vitro measurements of pH, PCO , PO , and Lactate. The B-Lac
2 2
cassette is sealed in a foil pouch along with a desiccant and is marked with a barcode
label that includes a lot identification number, calibration information, and expiration
date. The pH, pCO2, and pO2 are modified sensors from previously cleared wet
storage type to dry storage type sensors. Total hemoglobin and oxygen saturation are
the same as previously cleared in k984299.
The B-Lac cassette must be used in conjunctions with the OPTI CCA-TS analyzer.

L. Test Principle:
The single use B-Lac cassette contains a port that allows the introduction of a sample to an
array of sensors sealed inside the cassette. The OPTI CCA-TS analyzer aspirates the sample
from a capillary tube or syringe. The sensors use fluorescence optodes to measure the
intensity of light emitted from fluorescent dyes exposed to specific analytes. The
concentration of the analyte (pH, pCO2, pO2 and lactate) is determined by the calculation of
the difference in fluorescence measured at a defined calibration point and that measured with
the unknown concentration of analyte.
The lactate measurement is based on the enzymatic oxidation of lactate.
L-Lactate + O Pyruvate + H O
2 2 2
Lactate Oxidase
The sensor is constructed of an enzyme layer over an oxygen sensor. As a sample containing
lactate contacts the sensor this enzymatic oxidation of the lactate consumes the oxygen
locally present in the sensor. This decrease in oxygen is detected by the oxygen sensor. The
amount of lactate is determined to be proportional to the rate at which the oxygen is
consumed.

whole blood was tonometered using different gas levels to give three different
levels of measurements. For tHb, plasma was used to dilute the tHb
measurement to achieve three different levels of tHb and samples were
tonometered. Lactate blood samples were tonometered for 10 minutes using
6% CO2 / 12% O2 gas. A 500mM Sodium Lactate spike solution was
prepared and used to increase the lactate values and produce three levels of
lactate measurements. When testing precision in whole blood, two different

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
In-house linearity studies were performed in whole blood for the pH, PCO ,
2
PO , lactate, tHb and SO measurements on the candidate device and on a
2 2
FDA cleared method.
For the pH, PCO and PO study, whole blood specimens from three different
2 2
donors were tonometered with different %CO /%O gas mixtures to generate
2 2
samples with a range of values. Additional low pH sample points were
generated by spiking whole blood with 0. 1 M HCl. For the tHb and SO
2
study, whole blood specimens were spun down to separate the plasma from
the red blood cells. A range of tHb samples were then created by adding the
plasma to the separated red blood cells in different volume combinations.
These manipulated samples were tonometered with a 6% CO2 / 12% O2 gas
mixture before measurement.
For lactate study, whole blood samples with concentrations distributed across
a 0 to 20 mmol/L range were prepared and tested. Blank “blood” samples
with no lactate were prepared by spinning down whole blood, removing the
plasma fraction, washing the cells several times with isotonic buffer and then
re-suspending the blood in the same buffer. Low lactate levels in blood were
generated by addition of lactate oxidase to whole blood samples. Elevated
levels of lactate were generated by spiking with either a 100 mM or 500 mM
Lactate solution. A total of 13 different concentrations of lactate were tested
with 4 replicates on the candidate device and duplicate on the predicate
device.
The measured values are plotted against the expected values and linear
regressions are generated and shown below with the sponsor’s claimed
measuring ranges:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The OPTI CCA-TS system is calibrated with methods traceable to NIST
standards. Each lot of OPTI CCA-TS B-Lac cassettes is calibrated with
standard solutions and gravimetrically-prepared gas mixtures traceable to
NIST standards. Blood gas (PO and PCO ) calibration uses multiple blood
2 2
samples prepared by tonometry with certified gas mixtures traceable to NIST.
pH calibration uses gravimetrically prepared standards measured on a
reference instrument used as a secondary standard which is traceable to NIST
standards. Lactate calibration uses gravimetrically prepared solutions verified
with a legally marketed device since no NIST standard is available.
Real-time shelf life stability studies were performed on the B-Lac cassette
design to demonstrate a maximum shelf life of 12 months at storage
temperatures between 2 and 8 degrees C (refrigerated conditions) in unopened
foil pouches. Stability after removal from storage at 2-8oC and stored at room
temperature up to 31oC in sealed pouches was determined to be 14 days.
Protocols and acceptance criteria were provided and found to be acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor determined that the detection limit was defined by the linear
range study. The minimum detection limit is defined as the lowest analyte
concentrations over the range that the assay has been shown to be acceptably
linear. Please see linearity study in section M.1.b. above.
In addition, a limit of detection study was performed to evaluate the limit of
detection for lactate according to CLSI EP17-A guideline. The lactate limit of
detection evaluation was performed in whole blood. Whole blood “blank”
samples were prepared by spinning down whole blood, removing the plasma
fraction, washing the cells several times with isotonic buffer and then re-
suspending the blood in the same buffer. Low level samples with lactate
concentrations were prepared from whole blood by diluting the plasma
fraction with isotonic buffer. Testing was carried out on three different lots of
B-Lac cassettes. The calculated LoB = 0.0 mmol/L and LoD = 0.17 mmol/L.
The sponsor claimed that lactate has a measuring range of 0.3 to 17.5 mmol/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference study was designed according to CLSI EP7-A2 guideline to
evaluate 15 different endogenous and exogenous substances. The study used
human whole blood as the test material and was conducted for all the analytes
at two concentration levels (normal and abnormal). For pH, pCO2, pO2, tHb
and SO2 two different analyte levels were generated by tonometering with
different gas mixtures. For lactate, the elevated level was generated by spiking
with a lactate solution. All the samples were spiked with the potential
9

--- Page 10 ---
interferents (test samples) and were measured against the samples that were
not spiked (control samples). The sponsor states that interferences are
considered to be non-significant if the bias between the test and control
samples are within ±10% for lactate, ± 4% for pCO2, ± 5% for O2, ±0.02
units for pH, ±0.6 g/dL for tHb, and ±3% for SO2. The tables below
summarize the results of the interference testing performed. “No” significant
interference is defined using the criteria listed above.

The substances that were found to have significant interference were listed in
the Operator’s manual.
In addition, sodium fluoride blood collection tubes were also tested and
showed to interfere with the lactate sensor. Therefore, sodium fluoride is an
unacceptable anti-coagulant to be used for the device. This limitation is stated
in the Operator’s manual.
