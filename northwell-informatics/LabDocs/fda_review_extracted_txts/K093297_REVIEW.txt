The Lactate test, as part of the epoc Blood Analysis System, is intended for use by
trained medical professionals as an in vitro diagnostic device for the quantitative
testing of samples of heparinized or un-anticoagulated arterial, venous or capillary
whole blood in the laboratory or at the point of care in hospitals, nursing homes or
other clinical institutions.
Lactate measurements from the epoc Blood Analysis System are used to evaluate
the acid-base status and are used in the diagnosis and treatment of lactic acidosis
(abnormally high acidity of the blood.)

L. Test Principle:
Lactate is measured by amperometry. The sensor comprises an immobilized enzyme
first layer coated onto a gold electrode of the electrode module, with a diffusion
barrier second layer. The lactate oxidase enzyme is employed to convert lactate to
hydrogen peroxide. An amperometric sensor is used to detect the enzymatically
produced hydrogen peroxide. Peroxide detection is by redox mediated (ABTS (2,2’-
azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt), horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) catalyzed, reduction on a gold electrode. The reduction current is
proportional to the concentration of lactate in the test fluid.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The reportable range is 0.3 to 20.0 mmol/L.
A linearity study was conducted based on CLSI EP6-A using whole blood
samples collected from a fasting donor. Two (2) tubes were pooled and
dialyzed in Ringer’s buffer containing no lactate or glucose to produce low
lactate (<0.3 mM) blood. This sample was then spiked to 0.3 mM lactate
using 1 M sodium lactate stock solution. The remaining two (2) tubes were
pooled and spiked with 1 M sodium lactate stock solution to a level over 20
mM. The concentration of lactate in the two pools of blood was confirmed
using an ABL instrument.
Seven (7) samples of blood were prepared by mixing known volumes of low
lactate specimen with high lactate with values ranging from 0.3 to 24 mM.
Seven (7) lots of epoc cards were included in the study. Regression analysis
was performed as per CLSI EP6-A recommendations. Linear regression of
first, second and third order was carried out. The non-linear terms were
statistically insignificant over the range 0.3 to 20 mmol/L. Regression
analysis for the sponsor’s claimed range is y = 1.0014x + 0.2705. The studies
supported the sponsor’s claimed range of 0.3 to 20 mmol/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The epoc System is calibrated is against methods traceable to NIST standards.
The epoc System’s test card comprises an on-board calibration material,
prepared gravimetrically and assayed on reference systems calibrated with
traceability to NIST standards.
d. Detection limit:
The low end of the reportable range for the EPOC lactate test is 0.3 mmol/L.
The determination of Limit of Blank (LOB) and the verification of the
claimed low end range using Limit of Detection confirmation (LoD) studies
were performed according to CLSI EP17-A, Protocols for Determination of
Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantification.

The LoB determination was performed on an aqueous sample with known
zero lactate. Sixty (60) cards from 3 lots were tested. The LoB was
determined to be 0.084 mmol/L. For the LoD study, two matrices were
compared, an aqueous buffer and a whole blood sample adjusted to 0.3
mmol/L. The concentration of the sample was confirmed using an ABL
instrument. The aqueous sample was tested on a single occasion on 3 test card
lots. Three whole blood samples were tested on 3 occasions using 6 test card
lots. The LoD was verified as 0.3 mmol/L, which also is supported by the
linearity studies in which the lowest level sample tested was 0.3 mmol/L. The
% CV at 0.3 mmol/L lactate measured in whole blood is approximately 20 %.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed in-house using samples at two levels of
lactate, 0.7 and 2.6 mmol/L as recommended by CLSI guideline EP7-A2.
Samples were prepared in freshly drawn heparinized whole blood and plasma
was added or removed from the samples to decrease or increase the hematocrit
for the hematocrit studies.
Clinically significant interfering substances are listed below and in the
labeling:
• Acetaminophen will have no significant effect (defined as less than or
equal to 5% bias between control and test samples) up to 0.81 mM after
which it will increase the lactate reading up to 306 μM/mM Tylenol.
• Iodide will decrease the lactate reading up to -1.2mM/mM of Iodide up to
an Iodide concentration of 0.67 mM.
• Bromide will have no significant effect up to 25.4 mM after which it will
decrease the lactate reading up to 14.6 μM/mM Bromide.
• Thiocyanate will have no significant effect up to 2.7 mM after which it
will decrease the lactate reading by up to 96.6 μM/mM thiocyanate.
• N-Acetylcysteine will have no significant effect up to 3.7 mM after which
it will decrease the lactate reading by up to 96.3 μM/mM N-
Acetylcysteine.
• Ethylene glycol ingestion and metabolism has been shown to produce
falsely elevated lactate measurements. Ethylene glycol plus three
metabolism products - Glycolic Acid, Glyoxylic Acid and Oxalic Acid -
were tested for interference. Ethylene Glycol and Oxalic Acid do not
interfere significantly.
• Glycolic Acid will have no significant effect up to 0.87 mM after which it
will increase the lactate reading up to 142 μM/mM glycolic acid.
• Glyoxylic Acid will have no significant effect up to 0.85 mM after which
it will increase the lactate reading up to 373 μM/mM glyoxylic acid.
The following levels of endogenous interferences were tested and showed no
significant interference defined as less than or equal to 5% bias between

control and test samples: 20.1 mg/dL unconjugated bilirubin, 29.0 mg/dL
conjugated bilirubin, 503 mg/dL cholesterol and 1430 mg/dL triglycerides.
