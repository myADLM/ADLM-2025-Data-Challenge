O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The ACCELERATOR APS (Automated Processing Systems) workcell is a
modular system designed to automate pre-analytical processing, sample handling,
and processing in the clinical laboratory. The system consolidates multiple
analytical instruments into a unified workstation by employing a common sample
processing capability. The workcell software provides for workload management,
sample order management, and instrument operational status monitoring. This is
accomplished through communication connections between the workcell,
analyzers, and LIS (laboratory information systems) or middleware.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this line of product types:
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
The applicant provided software documentation that supports the device was
designed and developed under good software LifeCycle processes.
3. Specimen Identification:
Sample tube bar code (identification) is read by the Architect (when tubes are
placed directly on the Architect); or sample tube bar code read by
ACCELERATOR APS and communicated electronically to the Architect (when
tubes are loaded onto ACCELERATOR APS).
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The analyzer Interface module provides the path required to move sample tubes to
the analyzer. If a sample tube has test requests for an analyzer, the tube carrier is
moved to the analyzer for sample aspiration and processing. After sample
aspiration, the sample tube is returned to the main lane of the workcell.
5. Calibration:
Provided in k980367
6. Quality Control:
Provided in k980367
