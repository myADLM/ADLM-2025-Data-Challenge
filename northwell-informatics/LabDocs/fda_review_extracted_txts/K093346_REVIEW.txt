I. Device Description:
The lysis of bacterial cells in nasal swab specimens is performed using the BD GeneOhm™
MRSA ACP Lysis kit that incorporates enzymatic Achromopeptidase (ACP) lysis technology
for sample preparation of nasal swab specimens used with the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP
Assay. Lysis Reagent is reconstituted with Lysis Diluent and aliquoted into single use lysis

tubes. A nasal swab specimen is collected and transported to the laboratory using the
recommended swab collection/transport device. The nasal swab is introduced and broken into a
Sample Buffer tube. An aliquot of the liquid sample suspension is then transferred into the tube
containing the Lysis Reagent and incubated to break the bacterial cell wall and release the
genetic material.
An aliquot of the lysed sample is then processed with the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay.
An aliquot of the lysate is added to prepared PCR reagents which contain MRSA-specific
primers that will amplify in the presence of specific genetic target. The assay also includes an
Internal Control (IC) to monitor for the presence of inhibitors in the PCR reaction and to
confirm the integrity of assay reagents. Controls and specimen lysates are added to disposable
reaction tubes and placed in the SmartCycler II instrument. The amplification, detection and
results interpretation are automatically performed by the SmartCycler II software.
The primers (1 forward primer and 5 reverse primers) and probes (2 molecular beacon probes)
in the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay detect a proprietary sequence of the junction area of
the staphylococcal chromosomal cassette (SCCmec) adjacent to the integration site, called
MREJ for Mec Right Extremity Junction, indicating the presence of MRSA DNA.
Amplification of IC and MRSA DNA are detected using specific hybridization probes that bind
to a specific sequence of the amplified target. Differentiation of MRSA DNA and IC is done
using molecular beacon probes which contain different fluorometric properties. The molecular
beacon-target hybrid fluoresces at a different wavelength for MRSA and IC and the emitted
light from this reaction is measured by the SmartCycler II instrument. MRSA and/or IC
specific amplicons are detected simultaneously in two different fluorescence channels on the
SmartCycler II and can therefore be differentiated. The operation of the SmartCycler II
instrument is based on the proprietary microprocessor-controlled I-CORE® (Intelligent
Cooling/Heating Optical Reaction) module.

L. Test Principle:
The lysis of bacterial cells in nasal swab specimens is performed using the BD GeneOhm™
MRSA ACP Lysis kit that incorporates enzymatic Achromopeptidase (ACP) lysis technology
for sample preparation of nasal swab specimens used with the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP
Assay. Lysis Reagent is reconstituted with Lysis Diluent and aliquoted into single use lysis
tubes. A nasal swab specimen is collected and transported to the laboratory using the
recommended swab collection/transport device. The nasal swab is introduced and broken into a
Sample Buffer tube. An aliquot of the liquid sample suspension is then transferred into the tube
containing the Lysis Reagent and incubated to break the bacterial cell wall and release the
genetic material.
An aliquot of the lysed sample is then processed with the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay.
An aliquot of the lysate is added to prepared PCR reagents which contain MRSA-specific
primers that will amplify in the presence of specific genetic target. The assay also includes an
Internal Control (IC) to monitor for the presence of inhibitors in the PCR reaction and to
confirm the integrity of assay reagents. Controls and specimen lysates are added to disposable
reaction tubes and placed in the SmartCycler II instrument. The amplification, detection and
results interpretation are automatically performed by the SmartCycler II software.
The primers (1 forward primer and 5 reverse primers) and probes (2 molecular beacon probes)
in the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay detect a proprietary sequence of the junction area of
the staphylococcal chromosomal cassette (SCCmec) adjacent to the integration site, called
MREJ for Mec Right Extremity Junction, indicating the presence of MRSA DNA.
Amplification of IC and MRSA DNA are detected using specific hybridization probes that bind
to a specific sequence of the amplified target. Differentiation of MRSA DNA and IC is done
using molecular beacon probes which contain different fluorometric properties. The molecular
beacon-target hybrid fluoresces at a different wavelength for MRSA and IC and the emitted
light from this reaction is measured by the SmartCycler II instrument. MRSA and/or IC
specific amplicons are detected simultaneously in two different fluorescence channels on the
SmartCycler II and can therefore be differentiated. The operation of the SmartCycler II

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility and Precision of the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay using
simulated nasal specimens and the recommended processing techniques described in
the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Lysis Kit and BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay
package inserts were evaluated in three studies: lot-to-lot (LTL) reproducibility, site-to-
site (STS) reproducibility, and assay precision.
The MRSA strains used in the precision/reproducibility panels were Staphylococcus
aureus ATCC 43300 (MREJ type ii) and IDI-19 (MREJ type vii). Assuming that a
McFarland 5 corresponds to 1.5E+09 CFU/mL, serial dilutions were prepared from a
semi-logarithmic broth culture in TE 1X (Tris10mM, EDTA 1mM) supplemented with
glycerol (10%) to obtain the required bacterial concentrations. Cell numbers in bacterial
suspensions were verified by colony counts. A bacterial suspension of Staphylococcus
epidermidis (ATCC 14990) was used to simulate the flora present in the nose
(simulated negative nasal matrix). The S. epidermidis bacterial suspension was
prepared in the same manner as described for the MRSA suspensions. Final
concentrations of S. epidermidis for the negative nasal matrix were between 1.25+E3
and 2.07+E3 CFU/PCR reaction. Description of the panel members and their respective
concentrations were summarized in the following table:
Panel Member MRSA Concentration (multiples of LoD)
MRSA MREJ type ii High Negative 100 HN100 type ii 0.01 X LoD
MRSA MREJ type vii High Negative 100 HN100 type vii 0.01 X LoD

MRSA MREJ type vii Low Positive LP type vii 1 to <2 X LoD
MRSA MREJ type ii Moderate Positive MP type ii 2 to 5 X LoD
MRSA MREJ type vii Moderate Positive MP type vii 2 to 5 X LoD
MRSA Negative with S. epidermidis only TN 0 X LoD
Panels of 27 tubes (labeled 01R to 27R) were prepared for the reproducibility studies.
Panels of 18 tubes (labeled 01R to 08R, and 14R to 23R) were prepared for the
precision study. The tubes for the precision study contain the same MRSA target
concentration as the corresponding tubes for the reproducibility studies (Table 5.1-2).
All positive and high negative samples were prepared with 50 µL of a MRSA
suspension and 50µL of a S. epidermidis suspension. Negative samples were prepared
with 100µL of a S. epidermidis suspension. All aliquots were frozen at -80°C prior
to testing. Detailed tube descriptions for panel members are presented in the following
table:

Lot-to-Lot (LTL) Reproducibility Study
Three BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Lysis kit lots, 09T09003, 09T09004, and
09T09005, and three BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay kit lots, 03T09120z,
03T09121z, and 03T09122z, were used for the LTL Reproducibility Study. The LTL
Reproducibility Study was performed in- house at BD Diagnostics GeneOhm (GSCI).
Thirty pre-labeled reproducibility panels were used in the study. Each panel consisted
of 27 tubes labeled 01R to 27R as described previously. The study was performed on
15 distinct days (consecutive or not), wherein each day two panels were tested, one by
each of the two technologists. Individual boxes containing the required quantity of
frozen specimens for a single day’s testing were provided, i.e. 2 series of 27 tubes in
each box. Specimens were thawed on a cooling block, vortexed, and spun at low speed.
The contents (100 µL) of each tube were completely absorbed onto a sterile rayon-
tipped swab. The swab was then transferred directly into a labeled Sample Preparation
Buffer tube and processed according to the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Lysis Kit and
the BD GeneOhmTM MRSA ACP Assay package inserts. Appropriate run controls as
well as SPCs were processed with each run.

Site-to-Site (STS) Reproducibility Study
One BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Lysis kit lot, 09T09003, and one BD GeneOhm™
MRSA ACP Assay kit lot, 03T09120z, were used for the STS Reproducibility Study.
The lot tested during the STS Reproducibility study was the same as the first lot tested
in the LTL Reproducibility Study. Three sites were chosen to conduct the study:
• NorthShore University Health System (EVAN), Site 1
• BD Diagnostics GeneOhm (GSCI), Site 2
• Medical College of Wisconsin (WISC), Site 3
Each site was provided with a total of 10 pre-labeled test panels. Each panel consisted
of 27 tubes labeled 01R to 27R as described previously. Each site was asked to perform
the study on five distinct days (consecutive or not), wherein each day, two panels were
tested, one by each of the two technologists. Of note, data obtained from GSCI as part
of the LTL Reproducibility were used to represent the GSCI data for the STS
Reproducibility study. For EVAN and WISC, individual boxes containing the required
quantity of frozen specimens for a single day’s testing were provided, i.e. two series of
27 tubes. All boxes were shipped frozen on dry ice. At GSCI, all panel member tubes
were frozen at -80°C until tested. For testing, specimens were thawed on a cooling
block, vortexed, and spun at low speed. The contents (100 µL) of each tube were
completely absorbed onto a sterile rayon-tipped swab. The swab was then transferred
directly into a labeled Sample Preparation Buffer tube and processed according to the
BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Lysis Kit and the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay
package inserts. Appropriate run controls as well as SPCs were processed with each
run.
The qualitative STS reproducibility summary data are shown for each MREJ type for
all Sites (pooled Days, Runs (Technologists) and Replicates) in the following table:

Precision Study
One BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Lysis kit lot, 09T09003, and one BD GeneOhm™
MRSA ACP Assay kit lot, 03T09120z, were used for the Precision Study. The lot
tested during the Precision was the same as the first lot tested in the LTL
Reproducibility Study. The Precision Study was performed in-house at BD Diagnostics
GeneOhm (GSCI). Twenty-four pre-labeled test panels were used for the study. Each
panel consisted of 18 tubes labeled 01R to 08R and 14R to 23R as described
previously. The study was performed on 12 distinct days (consecutive or not), wherein
each day two panels were tested, one by each of the two technologists. Of note, data
from the first five days of the LTL Reproducibility Study were used to represent the
first five days of the Precision Study. Individual boxes containing the required quantity
of frozen specimens for a single day’s testing were provided, i.e. two series of 18 tubes
in each box. Specimens were thawed on a cooling block, vortexed, and spun at low
speed. The contents (100 µL) of each tube were completely absorbed onto a sterile
rayon-tipped swab. The swab was then transferred directly into a labeled Sample
Preparation Buffer tube and processed according to the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP
Lysis Kit and the BD GeneOhmTM MRSA ACP Assay package inserts. Appropriate
run controls as well as SPCs were processed with each run.
The qualitative Precision Study summary data are shown for each MREJ type (pooled
Days, Runs (Technologists) and Replicates) in the following table:

1For the Neg category, CT values reported are for the internal control. For other categories, CT values reported are for the MRSA target.
2 For the High Negative categories, the expected assay result was deemed to be negative. Therefore, percent agreement was calculated for
negative results.
Cycle threshold (Ct), an internal criteria used to determine a final assay result, was
selected as an additional means of assessing assay reproducibility. Overall mean Ct
values with variance components (SD and %CV) are shown in Tables 1 and 2.
In conclusion, the qualitative data generated during the LTL and STS Reproducibility
Studies of the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay for the low and moderate positive,
and true negative panel categories met the acceptance criteria. No qualitative
acceptance criteria were defined for the high negative panel categories. No quantitative
PCR parameter acceptance criteria were defined for any categories in either the LTL or
STS reproducibility studies.

The qualitative data generated during the Precision Study of the BD GeneOhm™
MRSA ACP Assay for the low and moderate positive and true negative panel
categories met the acceptance criteria. No acceptance criteria were defined for the high
negative panel categories. The coefficient of variation of the quantitative PCR
parameter data generated during the Precision Study of the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA
ACP Assay for the low and moderate positive, and true negative panel categories met
the acceptance criteria. No acceptance criteria were defined for the high negative panel
categories.
This precision/reproducibility data also demonstrated that as expected with all real-time
PCR assays, the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay may not generate reproducibly
positive results when testing samples that have analyte concentrations lower than the
LoD concentration, but higher than the assay cutoff concentration. This limitation
should be addressed by including the following statement in the Limitation section of
the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay Instructions for Use: “As with all PCR based
in vitro diagnostic tests, extremely low levels of target below the LoD of the assay may
be detected, but results may not be reproducible.”
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls
Internal Control (IC)
The BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay includes an internal control (IC). The purpose
of the IC in the BD GeneOhmTM MRSA ACP Assay is to monitor the presence of PCR
inhibitors in clinical samples as part of a comprehensive control scheme. The strategy
takes advantage of the NC IC % feature of the SmartCycler® software. This feature
allows the identification of an unresolved result when the internal control signal does
not reach a preset threshold. The NC IC % value is defined as the EP value of the
internal control (IC) in a given assay tube expressed as a percentage of the EP value of
the IC of the negative control (NC) of the same run. It is used to determine the level of
signal reduction of the internal control that is associated with the loss of a weak positive
signal due to the presence of PCR inhibitors. To avoid false-negative results from
possibly inhibited clinical specimens, the NC IC % cut-off of the BD
GeneOhm™MRSA ACP Assay algorithm was set to 36%. A verification study with
specimens from clinical studies validated the NC IC % cut-off. (Refer to section M (j)
of this review).
Positive and Negative Controls
The BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay includes a positive control and negative
control. The positive control is purified full length double stranded genomic DNA

--- Page 16 ---
from Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 43300 (66 equivalent genome copies per PCR
reaction). The negative control is purified full length double stranded genomic DNA
from Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990 (2,720 equivalent genome copies per
PCR reaction). S. aureus ATCC 43300 is a well characterized type strain. It is a MREJ
genotype ii. It represents the most frequent MREJ type observed in clinical specimens.
It yields the longest amplicon of the assay, thus presumably the most sensitive to any
stress. S. epidermidis ATCC 14990 is a coagulase negative staphylococci that does not
carry the mecA gene and is a species closely related to S. aureus. A verification study
with specimens from clinical studies validated the PC and NC cut-offs. (Refer to
section M (j) of this review).
Positive and negative controls are assay controls, as they go through the lysis step. Thus
they control the DNA integrity from sample preparation to the PCR assay. They are
used to monitor assay performance and validate PCR runs. The positive control is an
assay run control. An invalid control invalidates the run. It is used in combination with
the internal control to verify reagent and system functionality. The negative control is
also an assay run control. An invalid control invalidates the run. The negative control is
used to detect reagent or environmental contamination.
Specimen Processing Controls
During the clinical trial, in addition to the assay positive and negative controls,
Specimen Processing Controls (SPCs) were tested in each run in which specimens were
processed through the lysis step.
Since the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay is a multiplex assay with several primers
and probes, not all of them are directly controlled by the IC. In the BD GeneOhm™
MRSA ACP assay, two beacon probes (XSau-B5-A0 and XSau-B8-A0) and four
primers (XSau325, mecII579, mecIII519, and mecVII560) are not directly
controlled by the IC. However, XSau-B5-A0, mecII579 and XSau325 are directly
controlled by the assay positive control. Indeed, Control DNA consists of genomic
DNA from MRSA MREJ type ii that is amplified with XSau325 and mecII579 and
detected by the beacon probe XSauB5-A0. This leaves XSau-B8-A0, mecIII519 and
mecVII560 not controlled directly in the BD GeneOhm™MRSA ACP assay. Primer
mecIII519 is designed to amplify MRSA type iii, primer mecVII560 and probe X-Sau-
B8-A0 are designed to ensure amplification and detection of MRSA type vii.
The following language should be included in the product package insert to address this
issue: “A reference MRSA strain (e.g. ATCC 43300) or a well characterized MRSA
clinical isolate may be used as a positive SPC; MRSA MREJ type iii and vii strains, if
available, may be used as additional positive SPC, to monitor assay probes and
primers not directly controlled in the assay. A strain of methicillin susceptible
Staphylococcus aureus (e.g. ATCC 25923) or any other non-aureus Staphylococci (e.g.
Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990) may be used as a negative SPC.”

Recovery of Methicillin-resistant S. aureus Cells from Collection Device
An analytical study was carried out to demonstrate viability of MRSA when low
bacterial loads are present in collection devices under varying storage conditions. Nasal
swabs obtained from patients were characterized with the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP
Assay as described in the package insert. Negative samples were pooled and used as
negative nasal matrix to prepare study samples. The following 3 MRSA reference
strains were used in this study to take into account intra-species variability:
ATCC43300 (MREJ type ii), CCRI-9773 (MREJ type vii), and NRS384 (MREJ type
ii/PFGE USA300).
Cultures were prepared and used to obtain bacterial suspensions of various
concentrations. Twenty-five microliters (25 µL) of these suspensions were used to
spike 50 µL of negative nasal matrix. This produced study samples with volumes of 75
µL. The study samples that correspond to target concentrations consistent with 2-5 X
LoD were used to determine the viability of MRSA when low bacterial loads are
present in the collection device.
Three collection devices were tested, including Liquid Stuart (LS), Liquid Amies (LA)
and Amies Gel w/o charcoal (AG). For each collection device, study samples were
tested in triplicate for each storage condition. Collection devices were used to absorb
the 75 µL study samples. After complete absorption, the swabs were inserted into their
respective transport tube and stored under the 7 following conditions:
• At 4 °C for 0, 24, 48 hours and 5 days
• At 25 °C for 0, 24, 48 hours
After storage, the swab was removed from the transport tube, inserted and broken in a
tube containing 600 µL of ID Broth and discharged (vortex-mixing for 60 seconds).
Then, 100 µL of the eluted sample suspension were spread on BBL™ CHROMagar™
MRSA plates. The plates were incubated at 35°C for 24 to 48 hours and mauve-colored
colonies, corresponding to MRSA, were counted.
Results of cultures performed after storage of the study samples are shown in the
following tables:

In conclusion, all collection devices tested exhibited preservation of viable MRSA for
all strains tested at 2-5 X LoD under all seven storage conditions.
ACP Lysis Compatibility with PCR
An analytical study was carried out to demonstrate that lysis using the BD GeneOhm™
MRSA ACP lysis kit does not interfere with the PCR reaction of the BD GeneOhm™
MRSA ACP Assay. Positive Controls and Negative Controls were prepared following
the instructions in the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay package insert.
Reconstitution of ACP was prepared following the instructions in the BD GeneOhm™
MRSA ACP Lysis Kit package insert. Master Mix was prepared following the
instructions in the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay package insert. Positive and
Negative controls were tested using three lots of ACP and three lots of Sample Buffer.
ACP lysis compatibility with PCR was demonstrated when specimens submitted to the
lysis with ACP displayed the expected assay result and the appropriate CT relative
value (95%-105%) when compared to specimens not submitted to the lysis. The
formula used to calculate the relative CT value was the following:
200 - (average CT ÷ average CT (reference) x 100).
The following table shows the CT values recorded in the FAM channel (target) for both
conditions (PC with Sample Buffer (1 x TE) or PC submitted to lysis process (ACP)).
No significant change in relative CT value for processed PC was observed in the FAM
channel in comparison with non processed PC. In addition, all PC results were valid.

In conclusion, comparison of data of the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP assay performed
using processed and unprocessed PC and NC demonstrated that there is no inhibitory
effect of the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Lysis kit sample preparation components on
positive and negative controls. In addition, no unexpected positive signal was obtained
during testing which revealed the absence of contaminants in the BD GeneOhm™
MRSA ACP Lysis kit components.
Lysis Efficiency Study
An analytical study was carried out to determine the lysis efficiency of ACP for MRSA
strains following the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Lysis kit procedures.
Three (3) MRSA reference strains listed in the following table were used in this study
to take into account intra-species variability

Cultures were prepared and used to obtain bacterial suspensions at a theoretical
concentration of 6.50E+07 CFU/mL for each strain. Actual concentrations were then
determined by colony count and were used to calculate the lysis efficiency of the ACP
for each MRSA strain tested. The Collection Devices tested in this study were: Liquid
Stuart, Liquid Amies and Amies Gel w/o charcoal. Eighteen replicates of each
collection device were tested with each MRSA strain. An aliquot of 75 µL of the
6.50E+07 CFU/mL suspension of MRSA was absorbed by each swab and inserted into
their respective transport tubes for a minimum of 30 minutes. Following the 30 minute
incubation period, each swab was discharged by vortexing for 60 seconds in 600 µL of
Sample Buffer. Then, 90 µL of the cell suspension were transferred to a lysis tube
containing 20 µL of ACP. The tubes were incubated at 37°C for 20 minutes. After the
20-minute incubation at 37°C, 890 µL of trypticase soy broth (TSB) were added to each
lysis tube. Tubes were centrifuged at 10000 × g for 5 minutes. The supernatant was
removed and the pellet was re-suspended in 50 µL of TSB. Then all 50 µL of the

suspension was spread on a Blood Agar Plate (BAP). The plates were incubated at
35°C for 18-24 hours and CFU were counted.
The highest percentage and the lowest percentage of lysis were calculated. The highest
percentage was calculated as:
[(the highest initial CFU count observed before lysis - the lowest count after lysis)/the
highest initial CFU count observed before lysis] x100
The lowest percentage was calculated as:
[(the lowest initial CFU count observed before lysis - the highest count after lysis)/the
lowest initial CFU count observed before lysis] x100
The collection swabs (LS, LA and AG transport media) were spiked with a MRSA load
of 5.81E+06 ± 9.68E+05, 4.46E+06 ± 8.18E+05 and 7.05E+06 ± 8.85E+05 CFU for
MRSA strains ATCC 43300, CCRI-9773 and NRS384, respectively. Assuming a 100%
swab discharge in the 600µL of Sample Buffer, the estimated CFU loads, in the 90µL
volumes transferred in lysis tubes are of 8.71E+05 ± 1.45E+05, 6.69E+05 ± 1.23E+05
and 1.06E+06 ± 1.33E+05, respectively.
The lysates were plated on BAP and incubated at 35°C for 18-24 h and colonies were
counted. A range of counts from 0 to 1900 CFU/plates was obtained. Two plates could
not be counted because growth was confluent. Counts of plates containing more than
400 CFU were estimated. A summary of results obtained for all collection devices used
with the three strains tested are presented in the following table:

Preservation of DNA on Collection Device
The preservation of amplifiable DNA on collection devices was evaluated in an
analytical study.
Twenty seven Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains and 27 Methicillin-
susceptible Staphylococcus sp. (MSSSp) strains were used in this study. The MRSA
strains were of diverse geographical origin and included MREJ types i, ii, iii, iv, v, and
vii. For MRSA strains, 75µL of a bacterial suspension corresponding to a target
concentration of 2-3X LOD was used to determine the preservation of amplifiable
DNA on collection devices. For MSSSp strains, 75µL of a bacterial suspension
corresponding to a theoretical concentration of 1.00E+07 CFU/mL was used to
determine the preservation of amplifiable DNA on collection devices.
Each collection device was tested in triplicate with nine MRSA and nine MSSSp strains
at baseline and under 4 different storage conditions. Collection Devices tested in this
study were: Liquid Stuart, Liquid Amies and Amies Gel w/o charcoal.
The collection device swabs were used to completely absorb 75 µL of the relevant
bacterial suspension, and then the swabs were inserted into their respective transport
tube and stored under the following conditions:
• room temperature for 30 minutes (T=0)
• 25 ± 2°C for 24 hours
• 25 ± 2°C for 48 hours
• 2-8°C for 48 hours
• 2-8°C for 5 days
After incubation, study samples were prepared and analyzed according to the BD
GeneOhm™ MRSA Lysis Kit package insert and the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP
Assay package insert, respectively. To be considered acceptable, the percentage of
conforming results had to be equal to or greater than 95%. Results were calculated for
each collection device separately.
Summary results obtained for Liquid Stuart collection device with MRSA strains are

In conclusion, DNA from MRSA strains absorbed on swabs is stable up to 48
hours at 25 ± 2°C (96%-100%) and up to 5 days at 2-8°C (100%) for the 3
collection devices tested. DNA from MSSSp strains absorbed on swabs gave the
expected negative result up to 48 hours at 25 ± 2°C (96%-100%) and up to 5 days
at 2-8°C (100%) for the 3 collection devices tested.
Stability of Crude DNA
The stability of crude DNA lysates after processing according to the BD GeneOhm™
MRSA ACP Lysis Kit package insert procedures and storage under varying conditions
was evaluated in an analytical study.
Twenty seven (27) Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains and 27 Methicillin-
susceptible Staphylococcus sp. (MSSSp) strains were used in this study. The MRSA
strains were of diverse geographical origin and included MREJ types i, ii, iii, iv, v, and
vii. For each MRSA strain, 25 µL of the bacterial suspension at 2-3X LOD and 65 µL
of negative nasal matrix for a total volume of 90 µL were transferred into a lysis tube
containing 20 µL of reconstituted lysis reagent (ACP). For each MSSSp strain, 25µL of
the bacterial suspension at a theoretical concentration of 1.00E+07 CFU/mL and 65 µL

of negative nasal matrix for a total volume of 90 µL were transferred into a lysis tube
containing 20 µL of ACP. The tubes were incubated at 37°C for 20 minutes followed
by an incubation of 5 minutes at 99°C per the specimen lysis procedure in the BD
GeneOhm™ ACP Lysis Kit package insert. The tubes were then stored under the
following conditions:
• Baseline, no storage (T= 0)
• 2-8°C for 4 hours with septum cap
• 2-8°C for 72 hours with screw cap
• 2-8°C for 8 days with screw cap
• -20°C for 18 – 19 hours with screw cap (For the MSSSp arm, storage was for 18
– 21 hours). They were subsequent tested after 2 and 5 freeze-thaw cycles,
respectively.
• -20°C for 72 hours with screw cap
• -20°C for 8 days with screw cap
For each of the storage conditions, strains were tested in triplicate. At baseline or after
storage, study samples were prepared and analyzed according to the BD GeneOhm™
MRSA ACP Assay package insert. For a storage condition to be considered acceptable,
the percentage of conforming results had to be equal to or greater than 95%.

1 For 3 strains at T=0 and 4 h of storage at 2 -8°C was retested due to IC contamination. Results from the first tests were excluded from the calculation.
2 Results from strain IDI-2254 for 4 h of storage at 2 -8°C were not obtained
3An atypical PCR curve was obtained for one replicate and the result was excluded from calculations.
In conclusion, lysates of MRSA strains were demonstrated to be stable up to 4 hours at
2-8°C with septum cap and up to 8 days at -20°C (including 2 and 5 freeze-thaw cycles)
with screw cap. Lysates of MRSA strains did not appear to be stable after storage at 2-
8°C for 72 hours or 8 days with a screw cap. Lysates of MSSSp strains stored up to 4
hours at 2-8°C with septum cap and up to 8 days at -20°C (including 2 and 5 freeze-
thaw cycles) with screw cap demonstrated the expected negative results with the BD
GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay.
d. Detection limits:
LoD determination using genomic DNA
The analytical sensitivity (limits of detection or LoDs) of the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP
Assay testing genomic DNA were determined using decreasing amount of quantified
(copies/PCR reaction) genomic DNA from cultures of 6 MRSA strains that represent 6
MREJ genotypes (i, ii, iii, iv, v, and vii) and 4 SCCmec types(I, II, III, IV). The list of
MRSA strains used in the study is provided in the following table:
MRSA Strains MREJ type SCCmec type
CCRI-8894 type i I
ATCC 43300 type ii II
CCRI-1262 type iii III
ATCC 33592 type iv III
CCRI-2025 type v IV
CCRI-9773 type vii II
Dilutions of MRSA genomic DNA (20, 15, 10, 5, 2.5, 1 and 0 copies/PCR reaction) were
tested with the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay. To increase variability, 3 different lots
of lyophilized BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay Master Mixes were tested for each
strain. Each lot of lyophilized Master Mix was reconstituted with 225 μL of Diluent, and 25
μL aliquots were distributed in SmartCycler® tubes as instructed in the BD GeneOhm™
MRSA ACP Assay package insert. Then, 3 μL of each MRSA genomic DNA dilution were
added as specimens in 4 replicates per Master Mix lot (a total of 12 replicates per dilution).
PC and NC were included with each PCR run as described in the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA
ACP Assay package insert. This protocol was repeated 3 more times generating a total of
48 results for each DNA dilution. Two (2) different operators conducted the study in order
to further increase the variability.
Analytical sensitivity testing MRSA genomic DNA was determined for each MRSA strain.

The sponsor demonstrated that LoD testing MRSA MREJ Type i, ii, iii, iv, and vii
genomic DNA is 5 genomic DNA copies/PCR reaction (approximately 1,250
CFU/swab1). LoD testing MRSA MREJ Type v genomic DNA is 2.5 genomic DNA
copies/PCR reaction (approximately 625 CFU/swab).
LoD determination using viable bacteria with or without the clinical nasal matrix
The analytical sensitivity (limits of detection or LoDs) of the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP
Assay testing viable MRSA strains with or without clinical nasal matrix were determined
using simulated positive swabs that were prepared by soaking swabs in a wide range of
MRSA bacterial suspensions, and then discharged/eluted in either pooled negative clinical
nasal matrix or Sample Buffer.
Cultures were prepared and concentrations were determined by colony count. The
quantified (CFU/mL) cultures were used to obtain bacterial suspensions at a theoretical
concentration of 1.25E+02 to 1.00E+08 CFU/mL. The list of MRSA strains used in the
study is provided in the following table:

CCRI-9773 type vii II 3.86E + 08
The bacterial suspensions prepared above were used to simulate positive samples with a
wide range of MRSA loads. Swabs were soaked with bacterial suspensions at different
concentrations. A total of 6 swabs were soaked with each bacterial suspension (3 were used

To convert between CFU/swab and genomic DNA copies/PCR reaction (cp/rxn), the sample preparation process for the BD GeneOhmTM MRSA
ACP Assay must be considered, taking into account the dilution factor: For each PCR reaction, a swab is discharged in 600 µL of sample buffer; 90
µL (90/600) of the buffer is added to 20 µL of lysis reagent (90 + 20 = 110); 3 µL (3/110) of the lysis reagent is added to a tube for the PCR reaction;
The conversion factor is calculated as follows:
(1 swab) x ( 90 µL sample buffer ) x ( 3 µL lysis reagent ) = 0.004 swab
(rxn) (600 µL sample buffer) (110 µL lysis reagent) rxn
Conversion Factor = 0.004 swab/rxn
5 cp/rxn x 1 CFU/1 cp x rxn/0.004 swab = 1.25 x 103 CFU/swab

to determine LoD in negative nasal matrix and 3 in Sample Buffer). After the bacterial
suspensions were absorbed by the swabs, samples were further prepared in either pooled
negative clinical nasal matrix or Sample Buffer as the following: Swabs soaked with
bacterial suspension were placed in tubes containing either 600 μL of Sample Buffer or 600
μL of negative nasal matrix, the stem was then broken and the swab discharged by
vortexing for 1 minute.
Note: To prepare negative clinical nasal matrix, nasal swabs obtained from patients were
characterized with the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay following instructions in the
package insert. Negative samples were pooled to create the negative nasal matrix.
Next, 90 μL of the swab discharge/cell suspension were transferred to lysis tubes
containing 20 μL of reconstituted ACP Lysis Reagent. The tubes were incubated at 37°C
for 20 minutes and then at 99°C for 5 minutes. The samples were then stored between 2-
8°C, until they were used in testing. Two (2) series of lysates with negative nasal matrix
and 2 series without negative nasal matrix (in Sample Buffer) were prepared for each
MRSA strain per concentration.
A total of 6 processed samples representing decreasing bacterial concentrations per MRSA
strain per sample matrix (with or without nasal matrix) were tested with the BD
GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay. To increase variability, 3 different lyophilized BD
GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Master Mix lots were tested with each MRSA strain per
concentration per sample matrix (with or without nasal matrix). Each lyophilized Master
Mix was reconstituted with 225 μL of Diluent, and 25 μL aliquots were distributed in
SmartCycler® tubes as instructed in the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay package
insert. Then, 3 μL of each processed samples were added as specimen in 4 replicates per
Master Mix lot (a total of 12 replicates with negative nasal matrix and 12 replicates without
nasal matrix per MRSA strain per concentration per lysate). PC and NC were added as
controls for each PCR run as described in the package insert. This protocol was repeated
once generating a total of 24 results for each DNA dilution. Two (2) different operators
conducted the study in order to further increase the variability.
Analytical sensitivity testing viable MRSA was determined for each MRSA strain with or
without clinical nasal matrix. The LoD was determined as the lowest concentration that
was detected ≥95% of the time (i.e. concentration at which at least 23 out of 24 replicates
were determined to be positive). The data are presented in the following tables:

The sponsor demonstrated that LoDs testing viable MRSA MREJ Type i, ii, iii, iv, v, and
vii with clinical nasal matrix are 207 CFU/swab, 576 CFU/swab, 256 CFU/swab, 245
CFU/swab, 130 CFU/swab, and 386 CFU/swab, respectively. LoDs testing viable MRSA
MREJ Type i, ii, iii, iv, v, and vii without clinical nasal matrix are 207 CFU/swab, 288
CFU/swab, 1025 CFU/swab, 245 CFU/swab, 130 CFU/swab, and 386 CFU/swab,
respectively.
In conclusion, with clinical nasal matrix, LoDs testing viable MRSA MREJ Type i, ii,
iii, iv, v, and vii range between 130 and 576 CFU/swab with an average value of 300
CFU/swab. Without clinical nasal matrix, LoDs testing viable MRSA MREJ Type i, ii,
iii, iv, v, and vii range between 130 and 1025 CFU/swab with an average value of 380
CFU/swab.
In addition, it appears that clinical nasal matrix has minimal impact on the BD
GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay’s LoD.
e. Analytical inclusivity:
Analytical ubiquity of the BD GeneOhmTM MRSA ACP assay was evaluated in the
analytical inclusivity study. A variety of Staphylococcus aureus strains were included in
the study taking into account geographic origin, MREJ genotype, SCCmec type, pulse field
gel electrophoresis (PFGE) type, temporal diversity and susceptibility pattern. One-
hundred-forty (140) strains from 31 countries were tested in this analytical inclusivity
study, including 52 from public collections and 88 from well-characterized clinical isolates,
including Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) and Vancomycin-
intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) strains.
Isolated colonies from BAP of all Staphylococcus aureus strains tested in the study,
excluding those known to be VRSA and VISA, were subcultured on BBL™
CHROMagar™ MRSA plates for confirmation as MRSA.
Bacterial lysates tested were obtained from an internal BD Diagnostics bank of lysates and
were tested with the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay as the following: Lysates for each
strain were prepared to be tested at both a relevant clinical load (roughly 100 genome

copies/μL) and at roughly 2-3x LoD concentration.
BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay lyophilized Master Mix were reconstituted with 225
μL of BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Diluent and 25 μL of reconstituted Master Mix were
distributed into assay and control tubes as described in the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP
Assay package insert. Three (3) μL of sample were added to each assay tube. For PCR
controls, three (3) μL of Control DNA (reconstituted with 225 μL of Sample Buffer) were
added into the PC tube, while 3 μL of Sample Buffer were added into the NC tube. At the
end, all assay tubes were centrifuged and amplification was performed using the
SmartCycler II instrument. One (1) replicate was tested at the relevant clinical load dilution
and 3 replicates were tested at the 2-3X LoD concentration. At the end of the amplification
protocol, assay tubes amplified by using the relevant clinical load dilution were analyzed
by agarose gel electrophoresis to further assess if the expected amplicon had been
produced.
When the lysates of the analytical inclusivity panel were tested at the relevant clinical load
(roughly 100 genome copies/μL), 139 out of 140 MRSA strains tested gave a positive
result. One false negative result was obtained with the IDI-3368 strain, which is known to
be a MREJ type ii, SCCmec type III. No MREJ amplicon was produced on the gel
corresponding to IDI-3368; however, the IC amplicon was produced. Other MRSA strains
of MREJ type ii and SCCmec type III tested in this study were all detected by the BD
GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP assay. In addition, all MREJ genotypes tested in this study were
detected. All MRSA SCCmec types (I to VI), PFGE MRSA USA 100 to 800, 1000 and
1100 as well as VRSA and VISA tested in this study were also detected by the BD
GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP assay.
When the lysates of the analytical inclusivity panel were tested at the 2-3X LoD
concentration with three (3) replicates, 2 assay results were discarded due to an electrical
malfunction in the I-CORE®. A total of 116 strains (83%) gave 3 out of 3 positive assay
results (or 2 out of 2 for both strains that experienced an I-CORE® malfunction with the
third replicate). For the other 24 MRSA strains, 23 strains had 1 or 2 out of 3 positive assay
results. The FAM CT range obtained among these 23 strains was between 38.0 and 41.6.
Since the FAM CT range at the LoD concentration is 38.4 to 40.7, it is likely that the 23
strains noted above were actually tested at concentrations lower than the targeted 2-3X
LoD concentration in this study. For this reason, detection rates of less than 100% are not
unexpected. IDI-3368 was the only strain that exhibited a false negative assay result (all 3
replicates) at the 2-3X LoD concentration. Note: IDI-3368 also had a false negative assay
result when tested at the relevant clinical load.
In conclusion, 140 MRSA strains from 31 countries were tested with the BD
GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay. When tested at the relevant clinical load (roughly
100 genome copies/μL), 99% of all the strains were detected. The BD GeneOhm™
MRSA ACP assay detected all of the MREJ wild types i, ii, iii, iv, v and vii tested, as
well as MREJ mutant types ii mut16, ii mut25 and iii mut25. The BD GeneOhm™
MRSA ACP Assay detected MRSA SCCmec types I to VI and PFGE MRSA USA 100
to 800, 1000 and 1100. Staphylococcus aureus strains displaying additional resistance
to vancomycin (VRSA and VISA) were also detected. When the same strains were
tested in triplicate at 2-3X LoD concentration, 83% were detected in all three
replicates and 99% were detected in at least one out of three replicates.

f. Evaluation of Empty Cassette Variants:
Staphylococcus aureus isolates identified as “empty cassette variants” were not tested using
the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay. Since the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay
targets the SCCmec/orfX junction area of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, not
the actual mecA gene, it will very likely to report a false positive MRSA result for an
empty cassette variant. The following language should be included in the “Limitations”
section of the product package insert to address this issue: “The BD GeneOhm™ MRSA
ACP Assay does not detect the mecA gene directly nor the penicillin binding protein
(PBP2a) encoded by this gene. A false positive result may occur if an empty cassette S.
aureus variant is present.”
g. Evaluation of a well characterized challenge strain panel:
An additional analytical study was carried out to evaluate the analytical performance of the
BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay by testing a well characterized challenge strain panel
containing MRSA strains with high and low oxacillin MICs, including PFGE types USA
100, 300, and 400 (with emphasis on USA 300), borderline oxacillin-resistant S. aureus
(BORSA) (BORSA strains are mecA negative, but usually exhibit an oxacillin minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) >= 2 and <= 8 ug/ml by a mechanism not completely
understood), MSSA and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) strains.
The challenge strain panel used in this study was composed of 15 MRSA, 4 BORSA, 1
MRSE and 5 MSSA strains. All MRSA strains tested belong to MREJ type ii, with the
exception of strain IDI-5064, which belongs to MREJ type iii. These strains have
previously been shown to display a broad range of oxacillin and cefoxitin MICs. All these
strains were tested with FDA-cleared broth dilution susceptibility tests (BD Phoenix Broth
Microdilution System) using Oxacillin (k023301) and Cefoxitin (k053241) for
determination of the MIC values.
For the MRSA strains, cultures were prepared and used to obtain a bacterial suspension
adjusted to the turbidity of a 0.5 McFarland standard. This suspension was used to perform
serial dilutions to obtain suspensions with theoretical concentrations ranging between
1.00E+02 and 6.40E+04 CFU/mL. Fifty microliters (50 μL) of the suspensions containing
1.00E+02, 1.00E+03 and 8.00E+03 CFU/mL (theoretical concentrations) were spread on
BAP and incubated at 35°C (5 or 6 replicate plates per concentration). After an 18h-24h
incubation, colonies were counted for each replicate plate and an average was calculated
for each dilution. The results were used to determine the dilution corresponding to 2-3X
LoD. For each MRSA strain as well as for the positive SPC, 3 aliquots of 75 μL from 6
dilutions ranging between theoretical concentrations of 2.00E+03 and 6.40E+04 CFU/mL
were each absorbed onto a swab and discharged in a Sample Buffer tube (600 μL) by
vortexing for 60 seconds. Then, 90 μL of the discharge were transferred to a Lysis tube
containing 20 μL of ACP. The tube was incubated at 37°C for 20 minutes and then for 5
minutes at 99°C to inactivate the enzyme. The samples were stored between 2-8°C for at
least 10 minutes until they were added to the PCR tubes.
For the non-MRSA strains, BAPs were inoculated from frozen stock cultures. A second set
of BAPs were inoculated from the first set and incubated for 18-24h at 35°C to obtain fresh
cultures. Isolated colonies from plates prepared as described above were used to prepare a

--- Page 34 ---
bacterial suspension adjusted to the turbidity of a 0.5 McFarland standard. This suspension
was used to perform serial dilutions to obtain suspensions with theoretical concentrations
ranging between 1.00E+02 and 1.00E+06 CFU/mL. Fifty microliters (50 μL) of the
suspensions containing 1.00E+02, 1.00E+03 and 1.00E+04 CFU/mL (theoretical
concentrations) were spread on BAPs and incubated at 35°C (6 replicate plates per
concentration). After a 18h-24h incubation, colonies were counted for each replicate plate
and an average was calculated for each dilution. The results were used to determine the
concentration of the suspension used. For each MSSA, BORSA and MRSE strain as well as
for negative SPCs, 3 swabs were dipped into a suspension with a theoretical concentration
of 1.00E+06 CFU/mL and were pressed against the tube wall to remove excess fluid. The
bacteria were then discharged into Sample Buffer tubes (600 μL) by vortexing for 60
seconds. Then, 90 μL of the discharge were transferred to a Lysis tube containing 20 μL of
ACP. The tubes were incubated at 37°C for 20 minutes and then for 5 minutes at 99°C to
inactivate the enzyme. The samples were stored between 2°C and 8°C for at least 10
minutes until they were added to the PCR tubes.
Lyophilized Master Mix was reconstituted with 225 μL of Diluent per tube. Then, 3 μL of
each sample were transferred into SmartCycler® tubes containing 25 μL of reconstituted
Master Mix. Three (3) μL of Control DNA (PC), 3 μL of Sample Buffer (NC) and 3 μL of
positive and negative SPCs were also added into SmartCycler® tubes containing
reconstituted Master Mix. The analysis was performed with the SmartCycler II instrument.
In conclusion, all the MRSA strains tested as part of this analytical study testing
challenge strains with the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay (including PFGE types
USA 100, 300 and 400) exhibited positive results when tested at 2-3X LoD
concentration. All BORSA, MSSA and MRSE strains tested exhibited negative results
when tested at high concentrations.
h. Analytical specificity:
The analytical specificity of the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay was evaluated by
testing a panel consisting of well-characterized isolates of methicillin-sensitive
Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), coagulase negative Staphylococci (CNS), closely related
genera and other pathogenic and commensal flora found in the nares. Forty-two (42) non-
staphylococcal strains from 39 species, 36 coagulase-negative staphylococci strains
representing 25 species and 111 MSSA strains were tested in the cross-reactivity study. All
these species are phylogenetically related to Staphylococcus aureus or commonly found in
the human nares. For 13 out of the 42 non-staphylococci strains, purified DNA was
tested. All DNA were provided by the CRI (Centre de recherché en infectiologie du
CHUL, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Québec) at a concentration of approximately
100 ng/µL. Purified DNA was tested at roughly 1 x 105 genome copies/µL (≈ 1 x 108
genome copies/mL) in a single PCR reaction, corresponding to roughly 3 x 105 genome
copies/PCR reaction. For all the other isolates/strains, bacterial lysates were tested. Lysates
were obtained from an internal BD Diagnostics bank of well characterized lysates and were
tested also at approximately 1 x 105 genome copies/µL (≈ 1 x 108 genome copies/mL) in
single PCR reaction per strain, corresponding to roughly 3 x 105 genome copies/PCR
reaction. Analysis was performed using the SmartCycler IIinstrument in accordance with

--- Page 35 ---
the package insert. At the end of the amplification protocol, all assay tubes were
analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to further assess whether amplicons had been
produced. PCR reaction controls were also loaded on each gel.
Forty one (41) out of 42 non-staphylococci strains of various species exhibited
negative results with the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay. The lack of non specific
amplification of MRSA-specific amplicons was confirmed by gel electrophoresis
analysis for all species tested. Although some faint non-specific bands were observed for
the following species: K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, C. genitalium, E. coli, C. flavescens,
H. influenzae, P. aerogenes, N. gonorrhoeae, E. cloacae, M. catarrhalis, and Homo sapiens
DNA, because the sequence of the molecular beacon is in a highly conserved and specific
region of S. aureus, there was no hybridization of the molecular beacon with any of non-
specific amplified product from the species noted above. One (1) strain out of 42,
Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 14028) gave an initial positive result with the BD
GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay. Repeat testing in triplet PCR reactions using a fresh
lysate of Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 14028) at roughly 3 x 105 genome copies/PCR
reaction and repeat testing in duplicate PCR reactions using the original lysate material at
roughly 3 x 105 genome copies/PCR reaction all produced negative results. It was therefore
determined that the positive PCR result initially obtained for Salmonella typhimurium
(ATCC 14028) was very likely due to carry-over contamination by MRSA DNA, and the
BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay did not cross react with Salmonella typhimurium
(ATCC 14028).
Nineteen (19) Methicillin-sensitive coagulase negative Staphylococci (MSCNS) strains, 15
Methicillin-resistant coagulase negative Staphylococci (MRCNS) strains and 2 coagulase
negative Staphylococci (CNS) strains with unknown susceptibility status were also tested in
the analytical specificity study. Thirty-five of the 36 strains tested with the BD
GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay exhibited negative results. The absence of non specific
amplification was confirmed by gel electrophoresis analysis for all strains tested except for
Staphylococcus pulvereri, Staphylococcus epidermidis (IDI-564) and Staphylococcus
auricularis where non specific bands were observed. However, because the sequence of the
molecular beacon is in a highly specific region of S. aureus, the molecular beacon did not
hybridize with these non specific amplification products and thus gave negative real-time
PCR results. A fresh lysate of S. epidermidis (IDI-564) at roughly 3 x 105 genome
copies/PCR reaction was prepared and tested in triplicate. Negative results were obtained
by PCR with the fresh lysate, but 1 replicate out of 3 exhibited an amplification product of
280 bp, similar to what had previously been observed with the original lysate. However,
there was no hybridization of the molecular beacon with this non specific amplified
product. These results confirm that Staphylococcus pulvereri, Staphylococcus epidermidis
(IDI-564) and Staphylococcus auricularis were not detected by the BD GeneOhm™
MRSA ACP Assay.
Staphylococcus chromogenes (ATCC 43764) initially exhibited an unresolved result.
Repeat testing in triplet PCR reactions using a fresh lysate of Staphylococcus chromogenes
(ATCC 43764) at roughly 3 x 105 genome copies/PCR reaction and repeat testing in
triplicate PCR reactions using the original lysate material at roughly 3 x 105 genome
copies/PCR reaction all produced negative results. Therefore, it was determined that the
unresolved result obtained initially was very likely due to an inhibitor introduced into the

--- Page 36 ---
PCR tube during the preparation of this specific tube, and the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP
Assay did not cross react with Staphylococcus chromogenes (ATCC 43764).
In conclusion, 41 out of 42 strains of various non-staphylococcal species exhibited
negative results with the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay and 1 strain, Salmonella
typhimurium (ATCC 14028) was detected by the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay
initially. However, an investigation demonstrated that the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP
Assay did not detect Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 14028) and the initial positive result
obtained was due to contamination.
Ninteen (19) MSCNS strains, 15 MRCNS strains and 2 CNS strains tested with the BD
GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay exhibited negative results, except for Staphylococcus
chromogenes (ATCC 43764) for which had an unresolved result. Investigational tests were
performed on Staphylococcus chromogenes (ATCC 43764) demonstrating that PCR
inhibitory substances were initially present and repeat testing negative results were
observed. Therefore, the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay did not cross react with
Staphylococcus chromogenes (ATCC 43764).
Even though non specific amplification was visible on gel electrophoresis for some species,
these amplicons were not detected by the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay. Therefore,
the analytical specificity of the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay with closely related
organisms, including CNS, normal nasal flora and pathogenic nasal flora, was 100%
(78/78).
Out of a total of 111 MSSA strains isolated from 16 different countries tested in the
analytical specificity study, 103 exhibited negative results with the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA
ACP Assay. Of the 103 strains that exhibited negative results, the lack of amplification
was confirmed by gel electrophoresis analysis. For some MSSA strains, faint bands were
observed but were not detected by the assay.
For the remaining 8 strains that did not exhibit a negative result initially, 7 were positive
and one was unresolved on initial testing. One (1) MSSA strain generated an unresolved
result at roughly 3 x 105 genome copies/PCR reaction (IDI-1603). Repeat testing of this
strain result at roughly 3 x 105 genome copies/PCR reaction after freezing and repeat
testing at roughly 3 x 104 genome copies/PCR reaction without freezing was performed in
triplicate. In all cases, negative results were obtained for all replicates, and on gel a normal
amplification level of the IC was visible. Therefore, IDI-1603 was considered as generating
a negative result with the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay at a concentration of
roughly 3 x 105 genome copies/PCR reaction.
Seven MSSA strains generated false positive results with the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP
Assay initially. For MSSA strain IDI-2236, contamination with an MRSA strain was
suspected due to a high detection signal (CT of 34.2) and an amplicon consistent in size
with MRSA MREJ type i of 178 bp on gel. A fresh lysate was prepared and tested in
triplicate. Negative results were obtained and on gel no MRSA amplicon or any other non
specific amplicon was visible, indicating that the positive result initially obtained was not
due to the strain itself, but due to contamination. In order to confirm that the original lysate
was indeed contaminated by an MRSA strain, another PCR test was performed in triplicate
with the original lysate. PCR results were positive upon retesting and amplicons of the size

--- Page 37 ---
of MRSA MREJ type i were again visible, confirming that the original lysate was indeed
contaminated. The remaining six MSSA strains (IDI-183, IDI-184, IDI-188, IDI-214,
IDI-187, IDI-193) generated false positive results at roughly 3 x 105 genome copies/PCR
reaction. Five (5) of the 6 MSSA strains with false positive results had evidence of
amplicons on gel that could explain the assay result. IDI-188 did not have MRSA
amplicon or non specific amplicons on gel which could explain the initial positive result
obtained. Additional investigation was conducted with MSSA strain IDI-188 which
included repeat testing from the original lysate at roughly 3 x 105 genome copies/PCR
reaction in triplicate as well as at roughly 3 x 104 genome copies/PCR reaction. These tests
all yielded negative assay results and on gel no amplicon except the IC was visible.
Therefore, root cause for the false positive result could not be determined; however, the
investigation confirmed that the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay did not cross-react
with MSSA IDI-188.
The fve remaining MSSA strains (IDI-183, IDI-184, IDI-214, IDI-187 and IDI-193)
exhibited negative results when tested at roughly 3 x 104 genome copies/PCR reaction. For
1 strain, IDI-193, 1 replicate out of 3 was unresolved. This replicate was retested from
frozen lysate at roughly 3 x 104 genome copies/PCR reaction and exhibited a negative
result. So, overall, 5 MSSA strains generated false-positive results at a concentration of
roughly 3 x 105 genome copies/PCR reaction. This concentration is believed to exceed the
concentrations seen in clinical specimens by the sponsor. When tested at roughly 3 x 104
genome copies/PCR reaction, which the sponsor believes is more consistent with a clinical
relevant MSSA load, these 5 MSSA strains all generated negative results.
In conclusion, 106 out of 111 MSSA strains were not detected by the assay at
roughly 3 x 105 genome copies/PCR reaction in the analytical specificity study. The
remaining 5 MSSA strains were all positive at approximately 3 x 105 genome
copies/PCR reaction, but were all negative at approximately 3 x 104 genome
copies/PCR reaction. Therefore, the analytical specificity of the BD GeneOhm™
MRSA ACP Assay with MSSA was 100% (111/111) at approximately 3 x 104 genome
copies/PCR reaction, and was 95.5% (106/111) at approximately 3 x 105 genome
copies/PCR reaction.
The following limitation language should be included in the “limitation” section of
the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay product insert: “The BD GeneOhm™ MRSA
ACP Assay may cross-react with certain strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus
aureus (MSSA) when they are present at extremely high concentrations. The BD
GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay generated 5 false positive results during an analytical
specificity study testing a total of 111 well characterized MSSA strains at approximately
3 x 105 genome copies/PCR reaction (~ 7 x 107 CFU/swab).”
Overall, the analytical specificity of the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay
determined in the analytical specificity study was 100% (189/189) at approximately 3
x 104 genome copies/PCR reaction, and was 97.4% (184/189) at approximately 3 x 105
genome copies/PCR reaction.
i. Assay cut-offs:
There are 5 PCR parameter cut-offs (acceptance criteria) used by the SmartCycler II

--- Page 38 ---
instrument and software to determine the results of clinical specimens and the validity of
controls for the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay. They are:
• Endpoint threshold (EP): the minimum endpoint that must be reached for the
assay to be positive or the Internal Control (IC) to pass;
• IC% endpoint threshold: the minimum IC% endpoint of the assay IC calculated
as a percentage of the IC endpoint of the NC;
• 2nd derivative threshold value (SDP): the minimum 2nd derivative peak value
that must be reached in order for a cycle threshold (CT) to be determined;
• Valid minimum and maximum cycle thresholds (CTs): range within which the
CT must be found for the assay to be positive or the IC to pass;
NOTES: Data acquired for the IC are only considered for specimens that are recorded
negative. For data to be interpreted as a positive result, criteria for EP, SDP, and valid CTs
for the assay must be met simultaneously. For data to be interpreted as a negative result,
criteria for EP, SDP, IC% endpoint and valid CTs for the IC must be met simultaneously.
The following table summarizes these PCR parameter cut-offs that had been
determined/established in pre-clinical validation studies:

Clinical specimens Positive control (PC) Negative control (NC)
PCR parameter Assay (FAM) IC (TET) Assay (FAM) Assay (FAM) IC (TET)

Minimum cycle threshold 15 30 30 151 31
(CT)
Maximum cycle 45 40 40 451 39
threshold (CT)
IC% endpoint threshold N/A 36% N/A N/A N/A
1Note: An assay cycle threshold value between 15 and 45, combined with assay endpoint and 2nd derivative thresholds
exceeding the specified values, invalidate a negative control.
Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis was performed using the clinical
data to verify/validate the cut-offs used in the clinical study. The data collected during
the clinical performance study (samples and controls) validated the established PCR
parameter cut-offs for the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay for nasal swab
specimens and controls appropriately.
j. Interfering Substances:
The potential inhibitory effect of biological and chemical materials that may be
present on nasal swab specimens on the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay was
assessed. Substances used in bacterial culture, transport media, as well as biological
and chemical substances occasionally used in the nares or found on nasal swab
specimens, were tested. The amount of each compound to be tested was
determined, and these values were considered as the highest amount likely to be
found at the sampling site or on the nasal swabs specimen. All substances were
tested in triplicate. The experiment was performed over 5 days. The inhibition level
was measured on positive and negative samples. Reference samples without inhibitor
were also tested. Negative tests were performed using 75µL of Sample Buffer.
Positive tests were performed by using MRSA ATCC 43300 at 2 different

concentrations: 3X LoD and at typical clinical concentration (CT values in the FAM
channel between 30.0 and 35.0).
Different sample preparation methods were used for samples containing liquid,
solid or gel substances. For liquid substances, the required volume was dispensed
directly in the Sample Buffer tube. Each sample (75 µL of bacterial suspension or
Sample Buffer) was absorbed on a swab. The swab stem was then broken in the
Sample Buffer tube containing the substance to test. The tubes were then vortexed for
60 seconds at maximum speed. For solid substances, a swab was rubbed on the
substance before absorbing the 75 µL of sample. The swab stem was broken in the
Sample Buffer tube. The tubes were then vortexed for 60 seconds at maximum speed.
For gel substances, each sample (75 µL of bacteria suspension or Sample Buffer) was
absorbed on a swab. Each swab stem was broken in a Sample Buffer tube. The
tubes were then vortexed for 60 seconds at maximum speed. The eluted sample
suspensions were transferred in the previously prepared 2 mL tubes containing the
substance, and the tubes were vortexed 5 seconds at maximum speed to solubilize
the substance.
Control DNA was reconstituted with 225 µL of Sample Buffer. Ninety (90) µL of
sample, Control DNA and Sample Buffer were subjected to the sample lysis process
as indicated in the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA Lysis kit package insert. Three (3) ACP
Lysis Reagent lots were tested,
Master Mix was reconstituted with 225 µL of Diluent. Twenty-five (25) µL of
Master Mix were distributed in SmartCycler® tubes. Three (3) µL of sample were
added to PCR tubes. For PCR controls, 3 µL of lysed Control DNA were added into
one PC tube while 3 µL of lysed Sample Buffer were added into one NC tube for
each PCR run. PCR analysis was performed on the SmartCycler II instrument.
The acceptance criteria is defined as specimens with potential inhibitor display the
expected assay result and the appropriate CT relative value (95%-105%) when
compared to specimens without potential inhibitor. The formula used to calculate the
relative CT value was the following:
200 - (average CT ÷ average CT (reference) x 100)
All samples had acceptable expected results except for blood (in an excessive amount),
which exhibited inhibition. It is noteworthy that the volume of blood tested was not
representative of what is observed with clinical samples where only traces of blood are
usually seen on swabs. Slight inhibition was noted for Rhinaris® and Secaris® based
on the relative CT values observed, however, the expected positive and negative assay
results were obtained.

In conclusion, no inhibition was observed with 17 out of 18 substances tested with
the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay. Inhibition was observed, for both positive
(at the 2 tested loads) and for negative samples, when an excess of blood was
present in specimens. Rhinaris® and Secaris® provoked slight inhibition, as
measured by the relative CT value. Despite the slight inhibition noted with these
substances, the expected positive and negative assay results were obtained.
The following limitation language should be included in the “limitation” section of the
BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay product insert: “An excess amount of blood in a
specimen may inhibit the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay. Rhinaris® and Secaris®
at high concentrations may cause slight inhibition in the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP
Assay.”
k. Carry-Over Contamination:
To evaluate the risk of carry-over while processing specimens with high MRSA
bacterial load in the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay, an analytical study was
carried out to evaluate the entire process from sample preparation (including
utilization of septum and screw caps on lysis tubes) to PCR result. Two (2) MRSA
strains (MREJ type ii and vii) were used as the high positive MRSA panel members
4 4
(1.4 X 10 genome copies/PCR reaction and 5.1 X 10 genome copies/PCR reaction
respectively). Negative members were prepared with Sample Buffer. Three (3)
replicates of each high positive panel member (a total of 6 high positives) and 6
replicates of the negative panel member were tested by alternating negative and
positive samples. Each run contained positive and negative controls prepared
according to the package insert. All panel members and controls were processed
following the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay package insert. The same
experiment was performed by 4 operators with each of the two types of lysis tube cap
(septum and screw caps). The experiment was performed a second time 72 hours
later using the original run controls from the first experiment to assess for possible
contamination during storage.
Pooled results of the carry-over study are presented in the following table:
FAM channel results Control validity
Sample Buffer Positive Negative
MRSA type ii MRSA type vii
(TE) control Control
First experiment 24/24 24/24 0/48 8/8 8/8
Second experiment (Same
PC/NC 72 hrs at 4oC) 24/24 24/24 1/481 8/8 8/8
1
The positive sample showed no target amplicon in the gel electrophoresis analysis. Therefore it was likely
not due to carry-over contamination.

--- Page 43 ---
For 95 out of 96 negative panel members tested, negative results were observed as
expected. One false positive result was obtained. However, gel electrophoresis analysis
demonstrated no target amplicon.
In conclusion, no false positive result due to carry-over contamination was
observed during a total of 16 runs (8 with septum caps tubes and 8 with screw
caps tubes by 4 operators). Storage of the PC and NC tubes at 4oC for 72 hours
and the subsequent use in retesting did not lead to invalid runs or carry-over
contamination.
l. Molecular Beacon Probe Cross-hybridization Study
A study was conducted to demonstrate the specificity of each molecular beacon
probe for its respective target of the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay. Specific
molecular beacon probes were designed using DNA sequence databases and
sequence alignments. Briefly, probe XSauB5A0 targets MRSA MREJ types i, ii, iii,
iv, and v. Probe XSauB8A0 differs from XSauB5A0 by a single base and targets
MRSA MREJ type vii. Probe SignB4B0 targets the internal control (IC). In order to
assess the specificity of each beacon, a matrix of Master Mix formulations was
created allowing selective inclusion of the molecular beacons. The experimental
conditions created in order to assess each beacon individually are outlined in the
following table:
Molecular Beacons and IC presence in Master Mix
XSauB5A0 XSauB8A0 SignB4B0 IC (pSarmf)
Master Mix a - - + -
Master Mix b - - +
+
(2,000 cp/rxn)
Master Mix c + - -
+
(200,000 cp/rxn)
Master Mix d + - - -
Master Mix e - + -
+
(200,000 cp/rxn)
Master Mix f - + - -
Each Master Mix was made of different stock solutions to increase possible
variability. As a result, 3 different lots of Master Mix components were used allowing
for testing of beacon specificity in triplicate. High concentrations of DNA (MREJ
types or IC) were added in order to challenge cross-reactivity. At the end of the
amplification protocol, all assay tubes were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis in
order to verify that the expected amplicon had been produced.
This study demonstrated that each molecular beacon of the BD GeneOhm™
MRSA ACP Assay is specific to its respective target. No evidence of cross-
hybridization between the XSauB5A0 or XSauB8A0 beacon and the IC
amplification product was observed even in the presence of high concentrations
of IC. No evidence of cross-hybridization between the IC beacon (SignB4B0)
and MRSA MREJ type i, ii, iii, iv, v and vii amplification products was observed,

3. Clinical studies:
a. Prospective Clinical studies
Performance characteristics of the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay were determined
in a multi-site prospective investigational study. Three geographically diverse U.S. clinical
sites having Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) culture-based methods
already in place participated in the study. Patients were included in the study only if they
were eligible for MRSA testing according to institutional policies. All specimens in the
study meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria represented excess, de-identified left
over material from normal standard of care laboratory testing. All clinical sites were
granted waivers of informed consent by their IRB for this study. Eligibility requirements
for targeted screening as per clinical sites policies included, but were not limited to: all
patients admitted into the particular healthcare system; patients admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit; patients transferred to the Intensive Care Unit; pre-elective surgery
patients; and patients being admitted from long term care facilities. Patients previously
enrolled in the study were denied repeat entry.
All clinical sites used the same culture media and procedure for S. aureus recovery,
confirmation that conformed to CLSI M47-A was used as comparative reference method
for assessing the performance of the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay. The culture
method consisted of an initial analysis on BBL™ CHROMagar™ Staph aureus selective
chromogenic media (Class I exempt) followed by subculture on Blood Agar (BA) of
presumptive S. aureus colonies. S. aureus identification was confirmed with an
agglutination test, the BBL™ Staphyloslide™ agglutination latex test (k940557), from
the subcultured BA plate. Susceptibility testing was performed on all confirmed
Staphylococcus aureus colonies at all study sites in accordance with the CLSI documents
M2-A9 and M100-S17, using the Cefoxitin disc testing to detect methicillin/oxacillin
resistance (<= 21 mm = resistant; >= 22 mm = susceptible). Enrichment in Trypticase Soy
Broth (TSB) (BBLTM TrypticaseTM Soy Broth with 6.5% Sodium Chloride, Class I
exempt) was completed in the event that methicillin-resistant S. aureus was not
confirmed by the initial method. The TSB was used to inoculate additional BBL™
CHROMagar™ Staph aureus selective chromogenic media (Class I exempt) and BA
plates, and MRSA confirmation was performed as described above.

--- Page 45 ---
The BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay procedure was performed according to the
BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Lysis kit and BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay
Package Inserts. The BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay positive (PC) and
negative (NC) controls were tested with each batch of samples analyzed in a
®
SmartCycler run to monitor Assay performance. For each run in which samples
were processed through the lysis step, appropriate positive and negative SPCs (A
reference MRSA strain ATCC 43300 was used as a positive SPC and a reference strain
of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus ATCC 25923 was used as a negative SPC) were
tested in addition to the Assay positive and negative controls.
There were 1296 specimens enrolled for this clinical study. Of those, 80 specimens
were found to be non-compliant and were excluded from performance analysis. See the

A total of 1228 nasal swab specimens were tested with both the comparative reference
method and the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP Assay, producing 1216 reportable
results. Of these, 12 nasal swab specimens were excluded from performance analysis
due to not following the appropriate control strategy specified in the clinical study
protocol (refer to the table above). Out of the 1216 nasal swab specimens in
compliance with the clinical study protocol that were tested with the BD GeneOhm™
MRSA ACP Assay, 12 (1.0%) were initially reported as unresolved. Upon repeat
testing from the frozen lysates per the product package insert, all 12 had reportable
results. The following table summarized the initial “unresolved” rates and the
“unresolved” rates after retest:

In comparison to the comparative reference method, the BD GeneOhm™ MRSA ACP
Assay identified 92.0% of the MRSA positive specimens and 94.6% of the negative
specimens. For the combined population tested at the three clinical sites, this resulted in
a Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of 98.5% and a Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of
75.4%.
