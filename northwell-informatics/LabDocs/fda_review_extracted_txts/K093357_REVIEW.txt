Value Assignment
Commercially available salts/chemical constituents are gravimetrically weighed and
added to Type 1 deionized water to yield the desired concentrations. To ensure that
target values are met, multiple replicates of test samples are measured at the
beginning and end of the production run on multiple analyzers. Values are determined
by taking the mean of multiple determinations performed on randomly selected
samples from each lot. Samples are then tested against previous lots normalized to
either an aqueous standard made with corresponding analyte NIST (National Institute
of Standards and Technology) material or a known calibrator.
Stability
Accelerated stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were described and
found to be adequate. Calibrant A has an estimated shelf life of 30 months when
stored at 18-25˚C. Calibrant B has an estimated shelf life of 28 months when stored in
the dark at 18-25˚C. On Board stability for Calibrant A is 30 days. On-Board stability
for Calibrant B, after pipetting into a sample cup, is 1 hour. Real time stability testing
is ongoing.
