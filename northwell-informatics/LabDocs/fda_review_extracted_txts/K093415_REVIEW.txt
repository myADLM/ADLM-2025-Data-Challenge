I. Device Description:
The D3 FastPoint L-DFA Parainfluenza Virus/Adenovirus Identification Kit uses a
blend (called a “L-DFA Reagent”) of viral antigen-specific murine monoclonal
antibodies that are directly labeled with either R-PE (parainfluenza virus) or
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (adenovirus) for the rapid identification of
parainfluenza virus and adenovirus in nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs and
aspirates/washes from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection.
Kit Components:

--- Page 3 ---
1. D3 FastPoint L-DFA Parainfluenza Virus/Adenovirus Reagent, 4.0-mL. One
dropper bottle containing a mixture of PE-labeled murine monoclonal antibodies
directed against parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, or 3 antigens and FITC-labeled murine
monoclonal antibodies directed against adenovirus antigens. The buffered, stabilized,
aqueous solution contains Evans Blue and propidium iodide as counter-stains and
0.1% sodium azide as preservative.
2. 40X PBS Concentrate, 25-mL. One bottle of 40X PBS concentrate containing 4%
sodium azide (0.1% sodium azide after dilution to 1X using de-mineralized water).
3. Re-suspension Buffer, 6.0-mL. One bottle of a buffered glycerol solution and
0.1% sodium azide.
4. D3 FastPoint L-DFA Parainfluenza Virus/Adenovirus Antigen Control Slides,
5-slides. Five individually packaged control slides containing 2 wells with cell culture
derived positive and negative control cells. Each positive well contains cells infected
with either parainfluenza virus type 3 or adenovirus. The negative wells contain non-
infected cells. Each slide is intended to be stained only one time.
5. D3 FastPoint L-DFA Specimen Slides and Coverslips, 50-slides with coverslips.
Fifty pack of 3-well specimen slides.
An overview of the procedure is as follows:
The cells to be tested are derived from respiratory specimens from patients with signs
and symptoms of respiratory infection. The cells are permeablized and stained
concurrently in a liquid suspension format with the L-DFA Reagent. After incubating
at 35ºC to 37ºC for 5 minutes, the stained cell suspensions are rinsed with PBS. The
rinsed cells are pelleted by centrifugation and then re-suspended with the re-
suspension buffer and loaded onto a specimen slide well. The cells are examined
using a fluorescence microscope. Cells infected with parainfluenza virus types 1, 2
and 3 will exhibit golden yellow fluorescence due to the PE. Cells infected with
adenovirus will exhibit apple-green fluorescence due to the FITC. Non-infected cells
will exhibit red fluorescence due to the Evans Blue counter-stain. Nuclei of intact
cells will exhibit orange-red fluorescence due to the propidium iodide.

specimen slide well. The cells are examined using a fluorescence microscope. Cells
infected with parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3 will exhibit golden yellow fluorescence
due to the PE. Cells infected with adenovirus will exhibit apple-green fluorescence due to
the FITC. Non-infected cells will exhibit red fluorescence due to the Evans Blue counter-
stain. Nuclei of intact cells will exhibit orange-red fluorescence due to the propidium
iodide.
It is recommended that results for specimens found to contain no fluorescent cells after
examination of the direct specimen result be confirmed by cell culture.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Assay precision, intra-assay variability and inter assay variability were assessed
with a reproducibility panel of proficiency-level antigen control slides. Each of
the reproducibility panel consisted of 5 randomized panel members.
The HPIV/Adenovirus panel consisted of the following:
a. Low level Para 1 (C-35 strain) infected cells.
b. Low level Adenovirus (ATCC type 1) infected cells.
c. Low level Para 1 (C-35 strain) infected cells mixed with mid level
Adenovirus (ATCC type 1) infected cells.
d. Low Adenovirus (ATCC type 1) infected cells mixed with mid
level Para 1 (C-35 strain) infected cells.
e. Mid level non-infected (negative) cells.
The low level is estimated to contain between 4 to 10% infected cells in the
sample. The mid level is estimated to contain between 20 to 25% infected cells in
the sample. Each sample contains 2.5 x105 to 3.5 x105total cells.
Each panel was tested daily in two separate runs for 5-days by four different
laboratories (40 total runs). The following results were recorded:
a. Presence or absence of golden-yellow fluorescence.
b. Percent of cells exhibiting golden-yellow fluorescence.
c. Presence or absence of apple-green fluorescence.
d. Percent of cells exhibiting apple-green fluorescence.
Note: “Processing of specimen”, although a source of variability, was done
according to each laboratory’s established practices. The product insert for this
device instructs the laboratory to process a specimen according to Clinical
Microbiology Handbook (H.D. Isenberg, 2004, publ. by ASM; sections 10.7.1-
10.7.10). As such, testing reproducibility of “processing of specimen” is beyond
the scope of this reproducibility study. This study accessed reproducibility of the
6

--- Page 7 ---
test alone, i.e., “chemistry of assay” (DFA staining) and “interpretation of result”.
“Interpretation of result” is considered to be the largest source for variability for
this test. Interpretation of test is subjective, according to potential variability in an
individual technician’s competence, experience, and/or diligence in microscopic
evaluations of stained cells.
A total of 280 data points were included in the reproducibility study data analysis
(1 panel X 7 members/run X 2 runs/day X 5 days X 4 sites = 280).
For the D3 FastPoint L-DFA HPIV/Adenovirus Reagent, the combined data from
the four Study Sites demonstrated reproducible detection of HPIV-1 by the R-PE
labeled MAbs and reproducible detection of Adenovirus by the FITC-labeled
MAbs. The presence of HPIV-1 infected cells was reported in 100% (120/120) of
the wells in which the infected cells were expected. The presence of Adenovirus
infected cells was reported in 100% (120/120) of the wells in which the infected
cells were expected. The absence of infected cells was reported in 100% (40/40)
of the wells in which infected cells were not present. The total percent agreement
for the D3 FastPoint L-DFA HPIV/Adenovirus Reagent was 100% (280/280):

Performance Evaluation of PE-labeled MAbs
Reactivity of PE-labeled MAbs with Acetone-Fixed Infected Model Cells
(Model Cells are A549 cell cultures infected with known isolates of parainfluenza
virus types 1, 2 and 3 or adenovirus at a high (0.1) MOI. These cultures are
incubated for 20 to 22 hours at 35°C to 37°C, and then processed by scraping the
monolayers and resuspending the cells in a viral transport medium.)
An antibody may exhibit high affinity for its target antigen until labeled with a
reporter moiety such as PE due to blocking or modification of the antigen-binding
site. Each of the six parainfluenza virus (2 for each parainfluenza virus types 1, 2
and 3) MAbs were labeled with PE. The individual PE-labeled MAbs were used to
stain acetone-fixed parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3 model cells (respectively)
in order to verify that each of the MAbs remains reactive with its target after
labeling with PE. The same model cells were stained concurrently with FITC-
labeled MAbs for comparison. This comparison of the reactivity is summarized in
the following table:

The 3 adenovirus FITC-labeled MAbs used in the D3 FastPoint L-DFA
Parainfluenza Virus/Adenovirus Identification Kit have all previously been FDA
cleared for use with acetone-fixed cells. No additional testing was performed.
Reactivity of FITC-labeled MAbs with Permeablized Infected Model Cells
(Model Cells are A549 cell cultures infected with known isolates of parainfluenza

Studies were conducted to demonstrate that the FITC-labeled MAbs would stain
infected cells in solution that have been permeablized. The individual FITC-
labeled MAbs were used to stain adenovirus model cells that had been
permeablized in order to verify that each of the FITC-labeled MAbs remains
reactive with its target. All FITC-labeled MAbs reacted with the appropriate
permeablized model cells as expected, and similar to acetone-fixed cells.

optimal fluorescence intensity and lowest background on their respectively
infected cells, permeablized and stained in suspension.
Cell Permeablization and Counterstaining
Selection of Permeablization Reagent
The D3 FastPoint L-DFA Parainfluenza Virus/Adenovirus Identification Kit uses
Sapogenin to permeablize the cell membrane instead of acetone to allow the
MAbs to react with their respective antigens. Permeablization involves treatment
of cells with a mild surfactant. This treatment will dissolve portions of the cell
membranes and allow larger dye molecules and antibodies access to the cell's
interior. This allows the cells to maintain their three dimensional structure while
being stained with labeled antibodies and counter-stain. By doing this, cells can
remain in liquid suspension. Studies were conducted to compare performance
using acetone with that using another permeablizing reagent, Sapogenin.
Sapogenins are the aglycones, or non-saccharide portions of the family of natural
products known as saponins. The amphipathic nature of saponins gives them
activity as surfactants that can be used to enhance penetration of macromolecules
such as proteins through cell membranes. Using influenza A virus, influenza B
virus and respiratory syncytial virus model cells, acetone and Sapogenin were
tested at various concentrations. Acetone was tested at concentrations from 20% to
100%. Sapogenin was used at 0.1% based on what has been published in the
literature. Data generated from the study indicated that at all acetone
concentrations Sapogenin had greater numbers of infected cells in the liquid
10

format. Based on these studies, Sapogenin was chosen as the Permeablization
reagent in the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Parainfluenza Virus/Adenovirus Reagent.
Determination of Sapogenin Concentration
Experiments were conducted to optimize the concentration of Sapogenin in the D3
FastPoint L-DFA Parainfluenza Virus/Adenovirus Identification Kit. Non-infected
model cells were treated with different concentrations of Sapogenin and counter-
stain for 5-minutes. The cells were then counted, and the values compared. Data
generated from the study indicated that there was no difference in numbers of cells
when Sapogenin concentrations at 0.1% to 0.025% were used. When 0.2%
Sapogenin was used, reduced numbers of cells were noted, which was an
indication that Sapogenin at that concentration may cause cell disruption. The
0.1% level was chosen to be used in the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Parainfluenza
Virus/Adenovirus Reagent to better ensure adequate Permeablization of clinical
nasal pharyngeal cells.
Propidium Iodide Counter-stain
To assist the end user in the use of the D3 FastPoint L-DFA HPIV/Adenovirus kit,
improvement to the counter-staining of cells was developed. Propidium Iodide
was added to the D3 FastPoint L-DFA HPIV/Adenovirus kit. The stained cell’s
nuclei fluoresce red. This improves the ability to assess specimen quality
compared to standard acetone fixation, Evans Blue stained DSFA specimens.
Subjective studies were conducted to determine the optimal concentration of
Propidium Iodide. Higher concentrations of Propidium Iodide (16-μg/mL or
higher) began interfering with the ability to see low level fluorescence generated
by either the PE- or FITC-stained cells. Lower levels of Propidium Iodide (4-
μg/mL or lower) made it difficult to see the stained nuclei. 8-μg/mL was the
optimal concentration to allow easy identification of cells with no quenching of
PE or FITC fluorescence. A low level of Evans Blue (25-μg/mL compared to 250-
μg/mL in each of the predicate respiratory devices) is also included to help reduce
background of non-specific antibody staining sometimes seen in clinical
specimens.
Reagent Interference Studies of MAbs
Studies were conducted to demonstrate that the final blend of PE- and FITC-
labeled MAbs in each D3 FastPoint L-DFA HPIV/Adenovirus Reagent did not
affect the ability to detect low level positive infected cells that are stained by one
fluor when they are in the same sample, with a high level of positive infected cells
which are stained by the other fluor in the same well. The following cell
preparations were permeablized and stained with the appropriate reagent.
For the HPIV/Adenovirus Reagent:

a. Low level (~25 or lower infected cells) parainfluenza virus type model cells
were spiked into non-infected cells.
b. Low level parainfluenza viruses model cells were spiked into high level (4 +)
adenovirus model cells.
c. Low level (~25 or lower infected cells) adenovirus model cells were spiked
into non-infected cells.
d. Low level adenovirus model cells were spiked into high level (4+)
parainfluenza virus model cells.
The following table summarizes the study data for the three DFA Reagents:

For each combination of low level infected cells spiked into high level of infected
cells, there was not a significant difference in detection compared to the low level
positive cells spiked into non-infected cells (control).
Binding Competition Studies of MAbs
The three D3 FastPoint L-DFA HPIV/Adenovirus Reagent contains 2
parainfluenza virus type 1 MAbs, 2 parainfluenza virus type 2 MAbs, 2
parainfluenza virus type 3 MAbs and 3 adenovirus MAbs. The purpose of
combining either two or three MAbs specific per virus is to ensure that all strains
will be detected. Studies were conducted to determine if the individual MAbs
compete with one another for the same binding sites since originally, the clones
were selected for their individual and highest level of staining intensity of the
respective virus antigens.
Model cells of adenovirus parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3 were
permeablized. Cells were stained with each unlabeled clone of the appropriate
virus. The cells were then stained with the PE- or FITC-labeled MAbs for each
pair. Labeled MAbs were used individually, each at their standard concentrations
used in the assay.

Results of the study indicated that there was no evidence of self or cross epitope
blocking for all the pairs of MAbs.
Stability Studies
Shelf life for the complete kit
Kits were tested at time intervals during storage according to the study plan.
Characteristics monitored were performance, as well as pH, color and clarity.
Among the acceptance criteria was fluorescence (as opposed to no fluorescence)
observed in processed, infected model cells at a high level of infection (2+ to 4+)
for each of the D3 FastPoint L-DFA HPIV/Adenovirus Reagent at 1:16 dilution.
This dilution was what was used for the D3Ultra Reagents. Stability studies have
been conducted in two phases: (1) using kits produced during the development
phase according to draft written procedures, and (2) using kits produced according
to established procedures by manufacturing staff (both phases are on-going). To
establish the final shelf life of the device, real-time testing (under labeled storage
conditions of 2°C to 8°C) is also being conducted. As of September 2009, stability
has been demonstrated to 10 months. Additional real-time stability studies are
currently being conducted to establish a 20°C to 25°C storage shelf-life claim for
all L-DFA Reagents. As of September 2009, stability has also been demonstrated
to 10 months for the 20°C to 25°C storage shelf-life claim.
Shelf life for the D3 FastPoint L-DFA Respiratory Virus Identification Kit
antigen control slides
The D3 FastPoint L-DFA HPIV/Adenovirus Identification Kit Antigen Control
Slides are prepared by combining infected cells (parainfluenza virus and
adenovirus in one well). Non-infected cells are spotted onto an additional well for
a negative control for each reagent. Stability studies are currently being conducted
for the D3 FastPoint L-DFA HPIV/Adenovirus Identification Kit Antigen Control
Slides; however, since they are prepared using the same procedure and same
infected cell cultures as the control slides in the D3Ultra Kit, a shelf life of 18
months is anticipated. Stability studies have been conducted in two phases: (1)
using slides produced during the development phase according to draft written
procedures, and (2) using slides produced according to established procedures by
manufacturing staff (both phases are on-going). To establish shelf life of the
device, real-time testing (under labeled storage conditions of 2°C to 8°C) is also
being conducted. As of September 2009, stability has been demonstrated to 10
months. Additional real-time stability studies are currently being conducted to
establish a 20°C to 25°C storage shelf-life claim for all L-DFA Reagents. As of
September 2009, stability has also been demonstrated to 10 months for the 20°C
to 25°C storage shelf-life claim.

d. Analytical Sensitivity (Detection limit):
Analytical Limit of Detections of the D3 FastPoint L-DFA HPIV/Adenovirus Kit
were addressed using dilution series of infected model cells. Model cells for
adenovirus (ATCC type 1) and parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3 (ATCC
strains C-35, Greer, and C243 respectively) were diluted with non-infected cells to
produce a suspension equivalent to 1,000 infected cells per milliliter. This level
theoretically yields approximately 25 infected cells per 25-μL of suspension. This
suspension was then serially diluted to a theoretical level of less than 1 cell per
milliliter. (NOTE: This level was the target to begin with a low positive level.
Actual starting levels vary, however, and are within 1 dilution of the 25 infected
cell target level). 25-µL aliquots from each dilution level were spotted onto 10
replicate microscope slides, and then stained according to the instructions for use
described in this product insert. Each cell spot was examined at 200x
magnification. Results were reported as numbers of positive replicates for each
set of 10. Analytical detection limits for each of the 4 analytes were defined as the
lowest dilutions at which at least 9 out of 10 replicates were detected. Results are
summarized in the table below:

f. Analytical Specificity:
D3 FastPoint L-DFA HPIV/Adenovirus Identification Kit was tested for cross-
reactivity against a variety of microorganisms. Stringent conditions for cross-
reactivity testing were achieved by using both the 1.5 X concentration of
MAbs and relatively high titers of microorganisms. No cross-reactivity was
observed for 59 virus strains. Twenty-two (22) bacterial strains, one yeast, and
one Chlamydia sp. were also evaluated for cross-reactivity, including

Staphylococcus aureus, a protein-A-producing bacterium. Except for
Staphylococcus aureus, which was cross reactive with the D3 FastPoint L-
DFA HPIV/Adenovirus Identification Kit, all other microorganisms tested
negative.
Staining of S. aureus appeared as small points of fluorescence. The Protein A
produced by the bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus, may bind the Fc portion of
some fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibodies. Such binding can be
distinguished from viral antigen binding on the basis of morphology, i.e., S.
aureus-bound fluorescence appears as small (~1-micron diameter), bright dots.
Results from testing direct respiratory specimens with bacterial contamination
must be interpreted with caution. The following language was added to the
“Limitations of Procedure” section of the product insert to address this issue:
“Light background staining may occur with specimens contaminated with
Staphylococcus aureus strains containing large amounts of protein A.
Protein A will bind to the Fc portions of conjugated antibodies. Such
binding can be distinguished from viral antigen binding on the basis of
morphology, for example, S. aureus-bound fluorescence appears as small
(~1 micron diameter), bright dots. Therefore, results from testing direct
respiratory specimens with bacterial contamination must be interpreted
with caution.”
• Fifty-nine (59) virus strains were tested for cross reactivity.
Depending on the particular virus, 1.4 x 104 to 1.4 x 105 TCID viruses
50
were inoculated into multi-well plate cultures and incubated for 24 to
72 hours to yield a 1+ to 4+ cytopathic effect. For each virus, a
confirmation stain was done with the appropriate MAb to ensure the
desired titer was achieved. These cells were then prepared as Model
Cells (scraped and resuspended in UTM). Each cell suspension of
infected Model Cells was processed according to the D3 FastPoint L-
DFA HPIV/Adenovirus Identification Kit protocol, using 2X MAb and
was examined at 200X magnification. No cross reactivity was observed
for the viruses listed below:

• Twenty four (24) microorganisms, including 22 bacterial, 1 yeast, and
1 Chlamydia sp. were tested for cross-reactivity. Bacteria were
cultured, processed as suspensions, then spiked into non-infected
Model Cells suspensions at levels (as CFUs, colony-forming units)
ranging from 1.6 x 109 to 3.5 x 1010 CFUs depending on the bacterium.
These suspensions of Model Cells with bacteria were then processed
according to the D3 FastPoint L-DFA HPIV/Adenovirus Identification
Kit protocol, using 2X MAb reagents. Except for Staphylococcus
aureus, which was cross reactive with the D3 FastPoint L-DFA
HPIV/Adenovirus Identification Kit, all other microorganisms tested
negative. Reactivity with Staphylococcus aureus is more than likely
due to binding the protein A produced by Staphylococcus aureus.
Microorganisms tested are listed in the table below:

Performance of the D3 FastPoint L-DFA HPIV/Adenovirus Identification Kit testing
direct respiratory specimens were established during prospective studies at 4
geographically diverse U.S. clinical laboratories during the 2009 respiratory virus
season (January 2009 – March 2009). All specimens used in the studies meeting the
inclusion and exclusion criteria represented excess, remnants of respiratory
specimens that were prospectively collected from symptomatic individuals
suspected of respiratory infection, and were submitted for routine care or analysis by
each site, and that otherwise would have been discarded. Individual specimens were
delinked from all patient identifiers and given a study sample code. All clinical sites
were granted waivers of informed consent by their IRBs for this study.

Ultra DFA Respiratory Virus Screening & ID Kit or D3Duet DFA RSV/Respiratory
Virus Screening Kit), followed by viral culture confirmation of all negative
specimens (as determined by the FDA cleared DSFA comparator devices), using
FDA cleared DFA reagents. “True” parainfluenza virus or adenovirus positive was
defined as any sample that either tested positive by the comparator DSFA device or
viral culture. “True” parainfluenza virus or adenovirus negative was defined as any
sample that tested negative by both the comparator DSFA test and viral culture.
Study Site 1 evaluated a total of 323 fresh respiratory specimens submitted, January
2009 through March 2009, to the laboratory for respiratory virus testing. Slides were
prepared from Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)-washed cells from the fresh
specimens and processed according to the prescribed protocol. The slides were
stained in accordance with the procedure in the product insert.

Of the 648 fresh respiratory specimens tested, all were nasal/nasopharyngeal swab
specimens. Three (3) nasal/nasopharyngeal swab specimens were excluded from the
performance analysis due to insufficient sample volume for both the investigational
device and the comparator DSFA device testing (0.46%). One (1) additional
nasal/nasopharyngeal swab specimen was excluded from the performance analysis
due to insufficient sample volume for the investigational device testing (0.15%). One
(1) nasal/nasopharyngeal swab specimen was also excluded from the performance
analysis due to un-interpretable result generated by the investigational device because
of high background. One hundred and two (102) samples for adenovirus and 101
samples for HPIV were excluded from the respective performance analysis due to
insufficient sample volume for the comparator methods, resulting in a total of 541
fresh nasal wash/nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens for adenovirus and 542 fresh

In the D3 FastPoint L-DFA HPIV/Adenovirus Identification Kit multicenter
prospective clinical study testing direct respiratory specimens, a total of 1519
eligible respiratory specimens were tested using the D3 FastPoint L-DFA
HPIV/Adenovirus Identification Kit from four U.S. clinical laboratories across the
United States during the 2009 respiratory virus season (January 2009 – March
2009). Prevalence for Adenovirus and HPIV as determined by the D3 FastPoint L-
DFA HPIV/Adenovirus Identification Kit direct specimen testing varied from
