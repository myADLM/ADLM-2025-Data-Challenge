L. Test Principle:
For each genomic sample being tested, two separate PCR reactions are performed.
PCR-A produces an alpha fragment used to detect the mutations in the table below, as
well as a duplication amplimer which indicates the presence of the duplication
genotype. PCR-B produces a beta fragment used to detect the mutations in the table
below, as well as a deletion amplimer indicative of the deletion genotype.
Following PCR amplification, the two reactions (PCR-A and PCR-B) are pooled. To
enable efficient incorporation of biotin-dCTP during the ASPE reaction, the pooled
PCR product is treated with Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase to dephosphorylate any
remaining nucleotides (particularly dCTP), and with Exonuclease I to degrade any
primers left over from the PCR reaction.
ASPE is then carried out using universally-tagged primers supplied in the ASPE
primer mix. An aliquot of the ASPE reaction is hybridized with the universal array
(Bead Mix) in the presence of the hybridization buffer and incubated with
Streptavidin, R-Phycoerythrin conjugate (reporter solution).
Samples are read on the Luminex 100 IS or 200 IS instrument and a signal is
generated for each of the loci as well as for the duplication and deletion amplimers, if
present. These fluorescence values are then analyzed to determine whether the wild-
type/mutant allele for each of the loci has been detected, or whether the samples carry
an allele(s) with the deletion or duplication.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility of the xTAG® CYP2D6 Kit v3 was assessed using a
multiple-center, multiple-operator, multiple-lot, blinded study design. A
subset of samples was extracted at each site with a different extraction
method, therefore three different DNA extraction methods were included in
the study. Reproducibility of the complete assay, including the extraction
step, was assessed on 8 EDTA anticoagulated whole blood samples
(genotypes provided in table below). Evaluation of the reproducibility of the
analytical (post-extraction) steps of the assay was further assessed with testing
of 5 purified genomic DNA samples.
This study was designed to distinguish between Site-to-Site, Lot-to-Lot and
Operator-to-Operator reproducibility in the CYP2D6 assay. There were 2
operators per site, each performing one run per day across 3 non-consecutive
days (3 runs per operator or 6 runs per site). Thus the number of replicates
per sample for this study was:
(3 sites) x (2 operators/site) x (3 runs/operator) x (2 replicates/run) = 36
replicates.

Overall percent agreement after the first test was 94.44% with a 95% lower
bound confidence interval of 91.97%.
At Site 1, one replicate of one sample required two re-tests to resolve the No
Call. The root cause was identified to be extraction failure. All other No Calls
were resolved after one re-test. All Site 3 No Calls were resolved after one re-
test.

states that previously characterized clinical samples or commercially available
2D6 controls are recommended for quality control testing. All quality control
requirements and testing should be performed in conformance with local, state
and/or federal regulations or requirements.
Stability: The stability performance of the xTAG® CYP2D6 Kit v3 was
evaluated using three kit lots. The stability protocol includes testing under
real-time and accelerated conditions. Real-time data is based on kit
components stored at the recommended temperature of -20˚C. Accelerated
data is based on stressed conditions where components are stored at 25˚C. The
current claimed shelf-life for the xTAG® CYP2D6 Kit v3 is 12 months.
Real-time stability testing is on-going. In addition, repeated freeze-thaw
cycles (up to 6) of the xTAG CYP2D6 Kit v3 are acceptable; stability testing
protocols, acceptance criteria and summary of the data was reviewed and
found to be acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) and range of the xTAG® CYP2D6 Kit v3 was
assessed by analyzing serial dilutions of genomic DNA samples from cell
lines and whole blood samples containing one or more mutations or
polymorphisms analyzed by the assay. DNA concentrations tested ranged

from 0.1 – 300 ng/uL. Determination of the DNA range of the assay was
performed at 1 site, with 3 operators running a total of five samples across
three consecutive days, 2 lots of reagents, and 3 different sets of equipment.
Genotypes for all samples were established by bi-directional DNA
sequencing.
Five samples used in the study had the following genotypes: *1/*41, *1/*5,
*35/*41, *17/*29, and *2/*4 DUP.

1The highest DNA concentration extracted from the whole blood sample was
82.5 ng/μL.
2For one replicate, the *1/*5 sample was incorrectly called as *1/*1.
The recommended DNA concentration for this assay is 10 ng/μL and the
lowest level of DNA that should be used is 2 ng/μL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Six patient blood samples were tested in this study. The genotypes of the
samples were: *1/*1, *1/*5, *2/*2, *1/*10, *2/*17 and *10/*17. A given
blood sample was split into 6 equivalent parts. One part was bi-directionally
sequenced. One part was left as a control. The other parts of the blood sample
were mixed, respectively, with hemoglobin, albumin, bilirubin, or
triglycerides. Each was then split into three, and underwent DNA extraction
by one of three different DNA extraction methods. The following potential
interferents and the levels tested were: 500 mg/dL hemoglobin, 20 mg/dL
bilirubin, 3000 mg/dL albumin and 2000 mg/dL triglycerides. Genotypes for
all samples were established by bi-directional DNA sequencing.
None of the substances tested interfered with the assay, since test results of all
samples that had added compounds were 100% in agreement with the
expected genotype determined by sequencing.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Four hundred and fifty-nine clinical samples were analyzed in the method
comparison study. Samples were either EDTA or citrate whole blood
samples. Results using the xTAG® CYP2D6 Kit v3 was compared to
bidirectional dideoxy sequencing. The percent agreement for genotype
detection of the xTAG® CYP2D6 Kit v3 was calculated by determining the
percentage of tested samples with the correct genotype assigned, compared to
the total number of samples tested of that genotype.

For rare alleles, the performance of the xTAG® CYP2D6 Kit v3 was
evaluated by blending plasmids with mutations for rare alleles with
homozygous genomic DNA. Plasmid clones for the *8 allele were created by
blending plasmids harboring mutations for rare alleles with genomic DNA. A
total of 5 blends of genomic DNA and plasmid were tested. Four replicates of
each blend were amplified (total of 20 samples) and assayed by xTAG®
CYP2D6 Kit v3. Genotype results using plasmid clone-genomic DNA blends
are shown in the table below. The CYP2D6 genotype call rate was 100% for
plasmid clone genomic DNA blends.
