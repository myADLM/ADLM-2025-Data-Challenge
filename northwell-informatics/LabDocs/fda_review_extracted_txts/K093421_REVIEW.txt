“In patients receiving therapy with high biotin doses (i.e. > 5mg/day), no sample
should be taken until at least 8 hours after the last biotin administration.”
“In isolated cases, elevated testosterone levels can be seen in samples from
female patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD).”
“In rare cases, interference due to extremely high titers of antibodies to analyte-
specific antibodies, streptavidin or ruthenium can occur. These effects have been
minimized by suitable test design.”
“Implausible elevated testosterone values in women should be verified by an
extraction method or a validated LC-MS/MS tandem method.”
4. Special instrument requirements:

L. Test Principle:
The Elecsys Testosterone II immunoassay is based on a competitive test principle
with streptavidin-coated microparticles and electrochemiluminescence detection.
Results are determined using a calibration curve that is generated specifically on each
instrument by a 2-point calibration and a master curve provided with the reagent bar
code.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Following CLSI EP5-A, the sponsor evaluated the precision using seven
human serum (HS) specimens and two controls, at the concentrations listed in
the table below. Precision was evaluated in duplicate, 2 runs per day for 21
days (n=84) using Elecsys 2010 analyzer. The results are tabulated below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor performed linearity studies in accordance with the CLSI EP6-A
guideline. Seventeen levels of samples were prepared by diluting a high
spiked serum pool sample with a low serum pool sample. The linearity
samples were tested in triplicate on the Elecsys 2010 analyzer over the range
of 0.5 to 1535.8 ng/dL. The observed values were plotted against the expected
values and an appropriate line fitted by standard linear regression resulting in:
y = 1.0122x - 0.0299; R=0.9996.
The data support the sponsor’s claim that the measuring range of this device is
2.5 to 1500 ng/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators used with this device have been previously cleared in k003411.
Control materials have been previously cleared in k090541. The sponsor
provided the stability study protocols for reagent stability. Based on the real-
time stability studies, the reagent kit is stable up to 12 weeks. The on-board
stability for open vials is 56 days.
d. Limit of Detection:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of
Quantitation (LoQ) were determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A
document. LoB were conducted using a blank sample tested five times on 2
Elecsys 2010 analyzers over 3 days using 2 runs, and 2 reagent lots (N=60).
For LoD, five serum samples were selected and diluted to obtain lower
concentrations. The samples were run over 3 days with 2 runs per day using 2
reagent lots (N=60). For LoQ, 7 serum samples were tested once per run, 2
runs per day for over 5 days (N=70). LoB was determined to be 1.2 ng/dL
and LoD was determined to be 2.5 ng/dL. The LoQ was calculated as the
lowest concentration for which the CV is less than 20%. The results
demonstrated that the LoQ is 12.0 ng/dL
The claimed measuring range of the device is 2.5 to 1500 ng/dL.

Interference studies were performed using four different levels of testosterone
samples spiked with 5 endogenous substances, using the same protocol as
follows: One aliquot of each serum sample was spiked with the interfering
substance; another aliquot was spiked with the same volume of the solvent
(control sample). The interfering pool was then diluted into the dilution pool
in 10% increments, generating a total of 11 different concentrations of
interference substances. Results of the spiked samples were compared with
the control samples and % recovery was calculated. Non- significant
interference was defined as recovery of ±10% (for concentration range of
>100 ng/dL), ±15% (for concentration range of >50 to 100 ng/dL), and ±7.5
ng/dL (for concentration range of 15 to 50 ng/dL). Based on the data, the
sponsor claims no significant interference for the substances and
concentrations listed below:
Icterus (bilirubin up to 30 mg/dL),
Hemolysis (Hemoglobin up to 600 mg/dL),
Lipemia (Intralipid up to 1000 mg/dL),
Biotin: up to 30 ng/mL,
Rheumatoid Factor: up to 1000 IU/mL.
In addition, common pharmaceutical compounds were spiked into native
human serum samples and tested with Testosterone II assay. Two serum
samples pools containing approximately 60 ng/dL and 500 ng/dL testosterone
were spiked with potential interferents (multiples of maximal daily doses).
The reference sample (control) without interferent was spiked with the
respective amount of solvent. Based on the sponsor’s definition of non-
significant interference (greater than ± 10% of control value), the sponsor
claims no interference for the compounds and concentrations listed in the
table below:
Compound Concentration
Acetylcystein 150 mg/L
Ampicillin 1000 mg/L
Ascorbic acid 300 mg/L
Ca-Dobesilate 200 mg/L

Nandrolone was tested and was considered as interference substance;
therefore, the sponsor has the following limitations in the labeling:
“Do not use samples from patients under Nandrolone treatment”
Cross-reactivity study was performed using native human serum samples
spiked with potential cross-reactant compounds. The spiked and non-spiked
samples were tested in duplicates on the Elecsys 2010 analyzer. Results are

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparisons between the candidate device and the predicate device
were performed according to the CLSI EP9-A guideline. A total of 387 serum
samples (239 males and 148 females) ranging from 2.5-1400 ng/dL were used
in the study. The candidate device results on the Elecsys 2010 (Y) were
compared to the corresponding predicate results on the Elecsys 2010 (X).
Deming regression analysis resulted in: Y = 0.989X – 2.87; R = 0.992.
An additional method comparison study using 123 pediatric samples (69
males age 7-18 years old and 54 females’ age 8-18 years old) was performed.
Samples ranging from 2.74 to 1048.2 ng/dL. Deming regression analysis
resulted in: Y= 1.06X – 2.79; R= 0.93.
b. Matrix comparison:
The sponsor performed a matrix comparison study using 45 unaltered paired
serum, K2-EDTA plasma, K3-EDTA plasma and Lithium Heparin plasma
samples. Samples ranging from 10 to 1460 ng/dL were analyzed on the
Elecsys 2010 analyzer. The plasma results (Y) were compared to the
corresponding serum results (X) and the Passing/Bablok regression analysis
results are summarized in the table below:
