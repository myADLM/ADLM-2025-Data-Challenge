reagents and a biotinylated F(ab′)2 fragment of an anti-digoxin mouse monoclonal
antibody. The first bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with ouabain, a weaker
binding analog of digoxin, and contains a photosensitizer dye. In a first step, sample
is incubated with biotinylated F(ab′)2 which allows digoxin from the sample to
saturate a fraction of the biotinylated F(ab′)2 that is directly related to the digoxin
concentration. In a second step, ouabain chemibeads are added and form
bead/biotinylated F(ab′)2 immunocomplexes with the nonsaturated fraction of the
biotinylated F(ab′)2. Sensibeads are then added and bind to the biotin to form bead
pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at 680 nm generates singlet
oxygen from Sensibeads which diffuses into the Chemibeads, triggering a
chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at 612 nm and is an
inverse function of the digoxin concentration in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision
Precision was evaluated for (i) human serum samples containing 0.92 ng/mL
and 2.44 ng/mL digoxin and (ii) commercial serum-based QC products.
Testing was performed daily for 20 days. During each day of testing, 2 test
samples of each test materials were analyzed in two separate runs. The
evaluation was performed with one reagent lot, one instrument and one
calibration.
The standard deviations (SD) and percent coefficient of variation (% CV)
shown in the table below were calculated by the analysis of variance
(ANOVA) method in accordance with CLSI Guideline EP5-A2.

An additional (20 day) precision evaluation was performed for samples spiked
at 0.10 ng/mL digoxin. Estimated within-lab CV in this evaluation was 7%.
Precision at the upper end of the range was assessed using a 4.5 ng/mL
digoxin sample, over 5 days. On each day, there was one run per day and 5

replicates per run. In this evaluation the within–lab CV estimate at this
concentration was 1.1%.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor’s claimed analytical measuring range of the Dimension Vista®
LOCI DIGXN Flex® reagent cartridge assay is 0.06 – 5 ng/mL. This is
supported by the linearity evaluation as well as performance at the assay lower
limits (see detection limit, below). Linearity was confirmed by testing 9
levels of serum pools and comparing observed versus expected values. The
study design followed CLSI Guideline EP-6. The high pool was prepared
gravimetrically using USP material; intermediate dilutions were prepared by
combining high and low pools. The pools were assayed using the LOCI
DIGXN method. The means (N=5) of the observed values for each sample
were plotted versus the expected values. Linear regression yielded: y=
0.98X+0.03, R2=0.998. Results in terms of recovery are shown in the table
below:
Observed digoxin value Expected Difference Percent
(ng/mL) digoxin value difference

0.03 0.00 0.03 N/A
0.71 0.71 -0.02 -3.0

3.55 3.55 0.05 1.3
4.27 4.27 0.01 0.3
4.98 4.98 -0.19 -3.9
The package insert recommends that samples above the measuring range may
be diluted with zero calibrator. To evaluate recovery using this procedure
spiked sample, and native patient samples were diluted using this. Results are
shown below. Measurements of all diluted samples showed recovery within
+/- 10% of the expected value, and no significant trends were observed.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrator value assignment and estimation of uncertainty:
Values are assigned to new lots from a master pool that is referenced to the
United States Pharmacopoeia material for digoxin. The estimates of
uncertainty for calibrator value assignment were described in the 510(k)
taking into account the uncertainty of the USP digoxin, the gravimetric and
volumetric processes, and the variability of the value assignment process used
to assign the product calibrators. The statistical approach followed
EUROCHEM/CITAC Guide to Measurement Uncertainty and the Guide to

Uncertainty of Measurement prepared by ISO. The uncertainty of the product
calibrator described in the 510(k) is ≤ 2%.
Stability:
Target shelf life for the Dimension Vista Drug 4 Calibrator is determined by
comparing results of test product stored at recommended conditions with
control samples stored at -20 and -70 degrees C. Recovery is monitored for
trends at multiple time points across the expiration dating period, and percent
change over time is determined. No significant drift was observed in
calibration for the 30 day open vial stability study. The manufacturer’s
acceptance criteria for is ≤ 4% for shelf life stability and ≤ 5% for open vial
stability for levels B-E. The criterion for level A is < 0.06 ng/mL.
d. Detection limit:
The manufacturer’s claimed limit of detection (LoD) for the Dimension®
Vista LOCI Digoxin (DIGXN) method is 0.06 ng/mL. This was determined
consistent with CLSI guideline EP17, and with false positives (α) and false
negatives (β) less than 5%, based upon 240 determinations with 120 blank and
120 low level samples. The low concentration patient samples used for the
LoD study were unaltered (native) human serum samples. Values for
individual samples were determined using a DIGXN Flex® lot. Results
support the LoD of 0.06 ng/mL.
To determine total analytical error at the limit of detection, three low level
(0.06 ng/mL) serum samples were prepared by spiking normal human serum
with digoxin master pool prepared from USP material to 0.06 ng/mL digoxin
(determined gravimetrically). Samples were tested on two different
Dimension Vista® instruments using two different DIGXN Flex® reagent
lots, over 3 runs, with three replicates per run. A total of 54 measurements
were performed.
The standard deviations for a sample with concentration 0.06 ng/mL
(gravimetrically determined) ranged from 0.006 to 0.008 (0.0068 average)
ng/mL. Bias ranged from 0.006 to 0.009 (0.0075 average) at this level. Total
analytical error was estimated as 0.021 at 0.06 ng/mL or 30%.
e. Analytical specificity:
To evaluate interference test samples were prepared by spiking each potential
interferent into aliquots of serum sample pools at digoxin concentrations of
0.40 ng/mL and 2.00 ng/mL. The test samples were analyzed as patient
samples and the results were compared to control samples (containing only
digoxin without the potential interfering substances.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A split sample method comparison study between the Dimension® DGNA
Digoxin Flex® reagent cartridge, (predicate) method and the Dimension
Vista® LOCI DIGXN method was performed following CLSI Approved
Guideline EP9-A2. De-identified, banked serum and lithium heparin plasma
remnant samples within the assay range were selected from patients
previously tested. No other selection criteria were applied.
The overall sample concentration range was 0.08 - 4.45 ng/mL. Regression
statistics for combined serum and plasma samples (based on single
measurements of each method) are:
Slope: 1.02 [0.98 to 1.06]
Intercept: -0.04 [-0.12 to 0.04]
R=0.98
Sy/x = 0.20 ng/mL
Similar results were obtained for both serum and plasma samples. The
method comparison graph is shown below.

4. Clinical cut-off:
See expected values below.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The manufacturer includes the following in the package insert, with literature
citations:
The therapeutic range of 0.80 – 2.00 ng/mL [1.02 – 2.56 nmol/L] includes
effective serum concentrations for a wide range of patient populations, although
lower concentrations of 0.5 – 1.2 ng/mL [0.64 – 1.54 nmol/L] have been found to
be more appropriate in certain populations such as chronic heart failure patients.
Digoxin toxicity is commonly associated with serum levels > 2.0 ng/mL [2.6
nmol/L] but may occur with lower digoxin levels. Significant overlap of toxic and
nontoxic values has been reported. Consequently, analysis of serum
concentrations alone is not efficient for optimization of digoxin therapy.
Additional factors such as age, thyroid condition, electrolyte balance, hepatic and
renal functions, and other clinical symptoms must be considered. Each laboratory
should determine the appropriateness of this range for the diagnostic evaluation of
patient results.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports
substantial equivalence decision.
