L. Test Principle:
The EliA Gliadin IgG and IgA Wells are coated with synthetic deamidated gliadin
peptides. If present in the patient's specimen, antibodies to gliadin peptides bind to
their specific antigen. After washing away non-bound antibodies, enzyme-labeled
antibodies against human IgG or IgA antibodies, respectively (EliA IgG Conjugate /
EliA IgA conjugate) are added to form an antibody-conjugate complex. After
incubation, non-bound conjugate is washed away and the bound complex is incubated
with a Development Solution. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the
reaction mixture is measured. The higher the response value, the more specific IgG or
IgA is present in the specimen. To evaluate test results, the response for patient
samples is compared directly to the response for calibrators.
The total IgG and IgA calibration is based on a set of six WHO-standardized IgG and
IgA Calibrators, respectively, derived from human serum. They are used to establish

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Six patient samples were diluted between 8 and 11 times. Each dilution was
tested in triplicate, each replicate representing the mean of two sample wells
as per the assay instructions. A regression analysis and a calculation of the
percent recovery were performed on the results. Of note, the samples with > ±
10% recovery from the expected value were typically highly diluted samples;
absolute differences in concentration were small.
EliA Gliadin IgG linearity results:
The measuring range (detection limit, upper limit) for EliA Gliadin IgG is
from 0.4 to ≥ 302 EliA U/mL.

Hook Effect EliA IgG: Hook effect was analyzed by using dilutions from high
positive serum samples with an estimated concentration well above the
highest calibrator. A hook effect was not observed when analyzing a high
positive sample that had a concentration up to 1.7 times above the upper limit
of the measuring range.
Hook Effect EliA IgA: Hook effect was analyzed by using dilutions from
high positive serum samples with an estimated concentration well above the
highest calibrator. A hook effect was not observed when analyzing a high
positive sample that had a concentration up to 60 times above the upper limit
of the measuring range.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The IgG and IgA Calibrators are traceable via an unbroken chain of
calibrations to the International Reference Preparation (IRP) 67/86 of Human
Serum Immunoglobulins A, G and M from the World Health Organization
(WHO). There are no international standards for Gliadin antibodies. Results
are given in arbitrary EliA Units/mL.
EliA Celiac Positive Control is prepared from selected pooled human sera and
contains IgG and IgA antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and gliadin.
The controls are pre-diluted and ready for use. This material was previously
reviewed in k062583.
EliA IgG/IgM/IgA Negative Control is prepared from normal human serum
and is ready-to-use. This material was previously reviewed in k072393. The
acceptance criterion for the Gliadin IgG and the Gliadin IgA assays is that the
mean of the negative value is below the lower limit of the assays’ equivocal
values (7 U/mL).
Stability:An accelerated stability study set the shelf-life of the EliA Gliadin
IgG and IgA Wells at 24 months. Other required components (previously
reviewed) of the assay method have a shelf life of 18 to 24 months. It is
important to store the wells in dry conditions at 2-8°C. A real-time stability
study was presented that supported the sponsor’s claim that opened EliA
Gliadin IgG and IgA Wells are stable for up to 9 months if not limited by
expiry date stated on the carrier and foil bag and if stored according to the
instructions for use.
The sponsor recommends following the guidelines in CLSI H18-A3 for
sample storage.
d. Detection limit:
The lower limit of the measuring range of both assays was established by
showing that the each assay could differentiate between the background
(sample buffer) and a 1/8 dilution of the lowest calibrator point. The results in
Response Units (RU) were compared with the result of the sample diluent on
EliA Gliadin Wells. The discrimination ability (D) of the assay is the ability of
8

--- Page 9 ---
the assay to discriminate a reading from background at a given concentration;
the value should be >2.0. EliA Gliadin IgG was able to discriminate samples
containing 0.5 μg/L IgG (Cal 4.0, 1:8) from the background. The
corresponding detection limit was 0.4 EliA U/mL when using 0.63 as
conversion factor (to convert μg/L to U/mL). EliA Gliadin IgA was able to
discriminate samples containing 0.038 μg/L IgA (Cal 0.3, 1:8) from the
background. The corresponding detection limit was 0.1 EliA U/mL: when
using 2.23 as conversion factor (to convert μg/L to U/mL).
e. Analytical specificity:
The analytical specificity of the EliA Gliadin IgG and IgA assays were partly
addressed by testing samples from patients with Crohn’s Disease, ulcerative
colitis (UC), and H. pylori infection. The expected result for these samples is
typically negative (< 1% of the population is positive, see Section M.3.5
below for additional discussion). The results are shown in the table below:
Assay Disease n = negative equivocal positive
Crohn’s 50 48 1 1
Gliadin IgG UC 42 41 1 0
H. pylori 14 14 0 0
n = negative equivocal positive
Gliadin IgA Crohn’s 50 47 3 0
UC 42 41 0 1
H. pylori 14 14 0 0
The sponsor examined the specificity of the EliA Gliadin IgG and IgA assays
further by comparing test results to the consensus results from a panel of five
samples from the College of American Pathologists (CAP) and one sample
from the National External Quality Assessment Service (NEQAS). The test
samples were diluted according to the assay instructions and the assays were
performed as per the instructions. Results are shown in the table below:

Interference:
The purpose of this study was to investigate whether high concentrations of
potentially interfering substances in serum, like Bilirubin, Hemoglobin, chyle
and Rheumatoid Factor (RF) adversely affect the results of the EliA Gliadin
IgG and IgA assays. Two positive serum samples with concentration levels
around the cut-off and one high positive serum sample were spiked with
bilirubin C, bilirubin F, hemoglobin, chyle or RF. The same samples were also
spiked with substance specific blanks. The samples were tested in 3 replicates
and the runs were repeated twice (n = 6). The %CV for each sample and
interferent combination was less than 12%. The samples containing the
interferents at the concentrations in the table below interfered with the non-
spiked samples ≤ ± 12%; the majority of the interferents interfered with the
assay results ≤ ± 10%:
Concentration in Test Sample (µg/mL)
Substance Gliadin IgG Assay Gliadin IgA Assay
Bilirubin C 20.6 412
Bilirubin F 19.1 382
Hemoglobin 49.9 98.8
Chyle 15.9 FTU 31.8 FTU
Rheumatoid Factor 550 IU/mL 1100 IU/mL
f. Assay cut-off:
Based on the results of the expected values/reference range study described
below in Section M.5 and the results with defined reference sera and the
correlation study, the assay cutoffs were set as follows (all units EliA U/mL) :
Negative Equivocal Positive
EliA Gliadin IgG < 7 7 – 10 > 10
EliA Gliadin IgA < 7 7 – 10 > 10
In case of equivocal results, it is recommended to retest the patient after 4-6
weeks. Good laboratory practice requires that each laboratory establishes its
own range of expected values.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
EliA Gliadin IgA:
309 serum samples that tested within the measuring range of both assays were
collected from the serum bank at Phadia GmbH; these samples included 64
samples from patients who had been clinically defined as suffering from
celiac disease (CD). 21 samples from IgA deficient patients were tested with
both methods; as expected, all were negative and are not included in this
analysis:

from the same patient were collected in all four collection tubes and tested
according to the directions for use. Samples spanned the measuring range of
both assays; 39 samples were tested using the EliA Gliadin IgG assay and 50
samples were tested using the EliA Gliadin IgA assay. Regression analysis
was performed using serum as the comparator; results are shown in the table
below:

In the EliA Gliadin IgG study no negative samples changed to equivocal or
positive and all equivocal and all but two positive samples were ≤ ±10% of
the serum value. In the EliA Gliadin IgA study no negative samples changed
to equivocal or positive and all equivocal and positive samples were ≤ ±10%
of the serum value.

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The frequency distribution for Gliadin antibodies was investigated in a group of
apparently healthy subjects equally distributed by age and gender, using sera from
a Caucasian population obtained from a blood bank. The results are given in the
table below:
Test n = Mean 95th 99th
(EliA U/mL) percentile percentile
EliA Gliadin IgG Phadia 100 400 1.4 3.7 14.2
EliA Gliadin IgG Phadia 250 400 1.3 4.1 12.7
EliA Gliadin IgA Phadia 100 400 1.7 3.5 10.4
EliA Gliadin IgA Phadia 250 400 1.7 3.9 11.4
Antibody prevalence in autoimmune patients varies widely depending on disease
area. The proportion of sera from a normal population found positive for gliadin
antibodies covered by the EliA GliadinDP IgG and IgA tests is below 1 %.
Expected values may vary depending on the population tested.
