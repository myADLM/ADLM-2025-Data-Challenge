Mission Clinicheck Assayed Chemistry Control
Target values for each analyte were obtained by analyzing multiple replicates of each
analyte over several days. Multiple replicates of each analyte were tested daily. An
average of the values obtained was used to establish the target concentration. Range is
assigned based upon pre-determined intervals. Value assignment for the Mission
Clinicheck controls is lot specific. Lot to lot variation is determined by testing new lot
versus previous lot normalized to either a serum standard made with corresponding
analyte NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) material or
predetermined intervals.
Shelf-Life, Open Vial and Accelerated Stability testing protocols and acceptance
criteria were described and found to be adequate. The Mission Clinicheck Assayed
Chemistry controls have an estimated shelf life of 24 months when stored at 2-8˚C.
The Mission Clinicheck Assayed Chemistry controls are stable for 7 days when
stored at 2-8˚C with the following exception: Acid Phosphatase will be stable for 3
days when stored tightly capped at 2-8˚C. The labeling states that the Mission

Clinicheck Assayed Chemistry controls are stable up to 20 days after reconstitution
when stored tightly capped at -10 to -20˚C. The labeling states that the control
material should not be refrozen. Once thawed the remaining material should be
discarded. Real time stability testing is ongoing.
Mission CliniCAL Calibrator
The mean values listed in the package insert were derived from multiple
determinations performed on randomly selected samples from that particular lot.
Multiple replicates of test samples and a master calibrator lot were measured for the
analytes on consecutive days. The mean analyte values were calculated using the
master lot of calibrator and target values assigned. To substantiate the new values
created, the new lots of Mission CliniCAL calibrator were tested against
predetermined intervals on selected chemistry analyzers using 2 levels of
commercially available quality control material.
Shelf-Life, Open Vial, and Accelerated Stability testing protocols and acceptance
criteria were described and found to be adequate. The Mission CliniCAL calibrator
has an estimated shelf life of 24 months when stored at 2-8˚C. Once reconstituted,
with the diluent provided, the Mission CliniCAL is stable for 72 hours at 2-8˚C with
the following exception: Total Alkaline Phosphatase is stable for at least one day
when stored tightly capped at 2-8˚C. The labeling states that the Mission ClinCAL
calibrator is stable for at least 20 days after reconstitution when stored tightly capped
at -20˚C. The labeling also states that the control material should not be refrozen.
Once thawed the remaining material should be discarded. Real time stability testing is
ongoing.
