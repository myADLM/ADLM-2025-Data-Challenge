4. Special instrument requirements:
DiaSorin LIASION® Analyzer. Included in cleared assays: k033426, k081685, k082050.
I. Device Description:
The DiaSorin LIAISON® N-TACT® PTH calibration Verifiers consist of four levels (20,
150, 350 and 1500 pg/mL). Each vial contains lyophilized pooled human plasma with
preservatives, stabilizer and spiked with PTH.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A twenty day reproducibility/precision study was performed. One lot of LIAISON®
N-TACT® PTH Controls (KC 1 and KC 2) and one lot of Calibration Verifiers A-D
were tested in two replicates per day, for 20 operating days on two LIAISON®
analyzers for a total of 80 replicate results per sample. One kit lot of LIAISON® N-
TACT® PTH Assay was used throughout the study. The CLSI document EP5-A2,
Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods, was
consulted for this study design.
A five day reproducibility/precision study was conducted to verify the results of the
twenty day study. The CLSI document EP15-A2, User Verification of Performance
for Precision and Trueness, was consulted in the preparation of the testing protocol.
This study included one lot of LIAISON® N-TACT® PTH Assay and LIAISON® N-
TACT® PTH Control Set, and 3 lots of LIAISON® N-TACT® PTH Calibration

Verifiers. Testing was performed on three LIAISON® analyzers; one lot of
calibration verifiers per LIAISON® analyzer. The calibration verifier samples were
analyzed daily in quadruplicate, the assay controls were analyzed daily in duplicate
for five days. The results of the five day precision study were provided and found to
be sufficient.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The LIAISON® N-TACT® PTH Calibration Verifier concentrations are referenced
to standard in-house materials containing a pure preparation of synthetic human PTH.
The Calibration Verifiers are composed of the reference material added to a human
plasma-based matrix.
Value-Assignment
A minimum of 10 vials of each level of calibration verifier are used in the final range
assignment. The LIAISON® N-TACT® PTH Calibration Verifiers are tested on
multiple LIAISON® Analyzers, using multiple LIAISON® N-TACT® PTH assay kit
lots, on multiple assay runs. A range of two standard deviations is assigned for each
level of calibration verifier.
Stability
Stability characteristics of the LIAISON® N-TACT® PTH Calibration Verifiers were
determined using real time stability, open vial, and freeze thaw stability studies. An
unopened shelf-life of 3 months is expected at the recommended storage temperature
of 2-8˚C. Open vial and freeze thaw studies determined that LIAISON® N-TACT®
