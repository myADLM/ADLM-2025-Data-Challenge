the red blood cells which allows both the A1c and total hemoglobin analytes to be measured
at their own distinct wavelengths. Hemoglobin from the lysed cells is converted to met-
hemoglobin and is read at 420 nm. The concentration of hemoglobin is directly proportional
to the intensity of methemoglobin concentration. The A1c hemoglobin combines with any-
hemoglobin antibodies conjugated to colored microparticles. After a predetermined time, the
microparticle mixture is automatically released onto a reagent strip where the reacted and
unreacted microparticles are separated and read optically. %A1c = (A1c⁄Total Hb) x 100.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Two natural whole blood samples with values of 13-14% HbA1C and 4.5-5.5%
HbA1C were mixed in varying proportions to make 11 test samples spanning the
measuring range of the device. Testing was performed in quintuplicate on one Avie
A1c Test System with one lot of test cartridges. HbA1c recoveries of the observed
versus the expected concentrations were 98-104% across the measuring range. Linear
regression is:
y=0.9757x + 0.2261, r2 = 0.9963
Based on the data in this study, the measuring range of the Avie A1c is 5-14%
HbA1c.

Cartridge Stability:
Open and closed vial cartridge stability was tested at specified time intervals in real
time at 2-8° C, 21-25° C and 36-38° C. Studies support the labeling for six month
open cartridge vial stability at 21-25°C and closed vial cartridge stability for one year
at 21-25°C. Humidity studies were performed from 10-80% RH and support storage
of open and closed vials between 10-80% relative humidity. Shipping studies were
performed where cartridges were stored at 37° C for three days and then stored at 2-
8° C and 25° C for up to six months. Variable storage conditions were also tested
where cartridges were moved from room temperature storage to 2-8° C and back
again. Performance supported the expiration dating in the labeling.
Diluent Stability:
Closed vial and open diluent stability was tested at specified time intervals in real
time at 2-8° C, 18-25° C, 36-38° C and 44-46° C with three diluent lots. Studies
support the labeling for closed vial stability for 12 months at 18-25° C and open vial
stability for 6 months at 18-25° C. Humidity were performed from 10-80% RH.
Studies support storage of open and closed vials between 10-80% relative humidity.
Studies support six months stability for open vials at 18-25° C. Shipping studies were
performed where cartridges were stored at 45° C for three days and then stored at 25°
C for up to 12 months. Variable storage conditions were also tested where cartridges
were moved from room temperature storage to 2-8° C and back again. Both the
shipping and variable storage condition performance supported the expiration dating
in the labeling.
Traceability:
The sponsor has documented traceablility to the NGSP’s recommended accuracy base
for HbA1c by performing a direct comparison with a Secondary Reference
Laboratory (SRL) using 40 fresh human specimens. The assay is NGSP certified for
2011. However, NGSP certification expires at the end of one year. For current
certifications, see the NGSP website at: http://www.ngsp.org/docs/methods.pdf
d. Detection limit:
See item M.1.b., Linearity, above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Studies were performed to assess common or known substances that could interfere
with the assay using multiple meters (3) and lots of diluent (2). Potential interferents
were tested at their highest therapeutic levels. Whole blood samples with A1c%
concentrations of 5-7% and 9-12% were evaluated in quintuplicate for each
interferent. All samples had total hemoglobins within the reference range. Observed
A1c% values were compared to the control samples whose A1c% was determined by
6

Hb
The effect of total hemoglobin concentrations on the ability of the Avie A1c Test
System to measure hemoglobin A1c was evaluated by using 3 whole blood pools with
A1c concentrations of approximately 5-6%, 6.5-7%, and 9-11%. The pools were
divided into 4 aliquots. The total hemoglobin for each aliquot was adjusted to
approximately 5.0, 10, 15 and 21 g/dL total hemoglobin. Total hemoglobin
concentrations were confirmed on a commercially available hematology device and
the A1c concentrations were confirmed on a NGSP certified device. HbA1c recovery
on the Avie Test System needed to be within ± 10% of the target value for each total
hemoglobin concentration. Each sample was analyzed 5 times on one meter and one
lot of cartridges. Recoveries ranged from 98-104%. No significant ( no more than ±
10%) effect from total hemoglobin between 5 and 21 g/dL was observed.
To evaluate the effect of labile glycated hemoglobin, two whole blood samples
representing normal and diabetic A1C concentrations were incubated at 37° C for 4
hours in the presence of 1,100 mM glucose. Recoveries were compared to non-
incubated aliquots of the non-incubated whole blood samples. Interference is defined
as recovery >10% of the non-incubated samples. No significant effect from labile
A1c was observed (see results above).
Hemoglobin variants Hb S, C, F, D and E were evaluated on 15 fresh whole blood
samples with total hemoglobin concentrations of 8.1-21.6% and HbA1c levels of 5.1-
14.5%. Recoveries were compared to the NGSP reference laboratory. Interference
was defined as recovery >10%. Samples containing HbF showed no significant
interference up to 20.5% HbF. No significant interference was observed for HbS or
E. Hemoglobins C and D had recoveries > 10%.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A lay-user study was performed at four Point-of-Care sites with a total of 174 lay-
users and four POC health care professionals using 6 test cartridge lots and12 Avie
A1c readers. The lay-users ranged in age, education and were equally divided
between males and females. Type-I diabetics, type-2 diabetics or non-diabetics
participated in the study. Each participant performed a finger stick and tested their
blood using only the labeling instructions. A trained professional then performed
another finger stick, and a venipuncture to test both samples. Lay user fingerstick
results from the Avie A1C were compared to another NGSP certified fingerstick
system and to the venous blood, which was analyzed in a NGSP laboratory
(Columbus, MO). %A1c concentrations ranged from 5.0% to 14.0%.
An additional 126 banked and fresh venous samples were obtained and distributed
among two sites. These samples were analyzed by healthcare professionals at each
site. All venous sample results were compared to a NGSP laboratory (Columbus,
MO). The results are presented below:

O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The reagent test cartridges are single use and must be replaced in order to perform a new
test. The diluent vial is for use with multiple cartridges.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes __X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test cartridge as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

from the finger or vial to the cartridge test port. The cartridge is inserted into the reader
and diluent is added to the test port at the prompt.
10

--- Page 11 ---
5. Calibration:
The Avie A1c reader is factory calibrated and is not field or user adjustable. Strip lot
numbers are scanned into the Avie A1c reader via RFID.
6. Quality Control:
The Avie A1c Reader has an internal control system that performs operational self-
checks (optics and software) when the device is turned on. If a malfunction is detected
the reader will display an error message. The sponsor recommends that 2 levels of
external controls be tested prior to running the first patient of the day, at least monthly if
the device has not been used, every 3 months to check storage conditions, to become
familiar with the testing process, to perform training or retraining of testing personnel,
and whenever Avie A1c results do not match other clinical findings or symptoms. The
sponsor recommends that the user contact them for recommendations on the external QC
materials to use.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Studies were performed to examine the effects of variable whole blood sample size
on the accuracy of the Avie A1c Test System. One lot of test cartridges and one lot
of diluent were used on one meter. Samples ranging from 10-20 g/dL of total
hemoglobin were tested using blood volumes between 0.5-6.0 micL. Samples were
analyzed in quintuplicate. Results needed to be within ± 10% of the A1c
concentration as determined by an NGSP certified method. Data demonstrated that 5-
6 micL of blood were acceptable. Labeling recommends the cartridges are wiped of
excess blood prior to testing. The cartridges are designed to hold 6 micL of blood.
2. Studies were performed to examine the effects of variable diluent amounts on the
accuracy of the Avie A1c Test System. Two lots of cartridges, two lots of diluent and
one meter were used. Samples ranging from 10-20 g/dL of total hemoglobin were
tested with 1-4 drops of diluent at one HbA1c concentration. Samples were analyzed
in quintuplicate for each amount of diluent. Results needed to be within ± 10% of the
A1c concentration as determined by an NGSP certified method. Data demonstrated
that 2, 3 or 4 drops of diluent were acceptable. One drop of diluent gave an error
message on the device. Labeling recommends 2 drops of diluent.
3. Studies were performed to examine the effects of variable timing between collecting
the blood on the test cartridge and adding the diluent. Labeling recommends
collecting the blood on the test cartridge and immediately inserting the cartridge into
the meter. The meter display prompts the user to “Add Diluent”. The protocol was
performed using one cartridge lot, one diluent lot and one meter. Samples ranging
from 10-20 g/dL of total hemoglobin at one HbA1c concentration were used in the
study. Samples were analyzed in quintuplicate for each time interval. Blood was
collected onto the test cartridge according to the labeling instructions and allowed to

4. The device is intended for point-of-care or physician directed home use. Disinfection
studies were performed on the Avie A1C meter by an outside commercial testing
service to determine the robustness of the meter to the recommended cleaning and
disinfection protocol, and its effectiveness in preventing the spread of bloodborne
pathogens, particularly hepatitis B virus (HBV). Fresh 10% bleach solution (EPA
Reg. No: 5813-50) were validated, demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus
for use with the meter. The sponsor also demonstrated that there was no change in
performance or in the external materials of the meter after 650 disinfection and 650
cleaning cycles designed to simulate 3 years of healthcare professional and home use.
5. Demographic and usability questionnaires were completed by the 188 lay users.
Based on the information provided, the sponsor concluded that the lay users were
representative of the US population and 89% found the device very usable, 1% found
the device difficult/somewhat difficult and 10% did not respond to the survey
6. The Avie A1c reader demonstrated the appropriate error codes in the following
software verification and validation activities:
• operation was outside of the recommended temperatures of 18-30° C,
• inserting a used cartridge into the device.
• sample total hemoglobin concentrations were above 20 g/dL or below 9 g/dL
• A1c% >14%, A1c% < 5%A1c% results were synchronized between the reader
display and the printer
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
