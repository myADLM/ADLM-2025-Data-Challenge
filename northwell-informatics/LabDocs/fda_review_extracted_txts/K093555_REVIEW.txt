EN ISO 14971 Medical devices-Application of risk management to medical devices
(ISO14971:2007)
L. Test Principle:
Several light emitting diodes (LEDs) use a light pipe to transmit light of a defined
wavelength onto the surface of all test pads. The light that hits the test pad is reflected with
an intensity that is dependent upon the color of the test pads. A photodiode detector
positioned directly above the test pad receives the reflected light. The photodiode detector
transmits an analog electrical signal to the analog-to digital convertor, which changes the
analog signal to a digital value. The computer then converts the digital value into the
semiquantitative result.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability (within run) precision of the cobas u 411 analyzer was evaluated at 3
clinical sites using two commercially available urine controls over various days. The
controls, which were comprised of a normal and an elevated analyte sample, were
tested in three individual runs. Each run was comprised of 21 replicates. The samples
were split into seven aliquots with 3 measurements. In total, there were 48 runs
performed and three analyzers were used in the testing.
Example: 3 runs x 21 replicates (7 aliquots/3 measurements per aliquot) x 3
analyzers= 189 replicates.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Please see the method comparison section 2.a below and detection limit section 1.d.
below.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor recommends using commercially available control materials for use on
the cobas u 411 urine analyzer.
Calibration verification is performed using a Calibration Strip which is included with
the analyzer. This is a gray strip which checks the reflectance values for each test.
The reflectance values are compared with the previous user calibration values and the
values of the internal Calibration Strip. Recommendations for calibration verification
are included in the operator’s manual.
d. Detection limit:
The sensitivity of the Chemstrip 10UA Urine Test Strip on the cobas u411 was
evaluated by spiking negative pooled human urine with the appropriate substance to
obtain the desired concentrations. Multiple samples were tested for each
concentration. The prepared samples were then assayed on the cobas u 411 analyzer.
Sensitivity was defined as the cutoff in which 90% of the contrived pooled
measurements were positive.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
Expected values/Reference range:
Complete details of the expected analyte values are provided in the labeling.
The labeling states that each laboratory should investigate the transferability of the
expected values to its own patient population and if necessary determine its own
reference range.
N. Instrument Name:
Cobas u411 Urinalysis Test System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Cobas Urinalysis Test system is an automated urine analyzer using reflectance
photometry for the semi quantitative determination of Specific Gravity, pH, Leukocyte
esterase, Nitrite, Protein, Glucose, Ketones, Urobilinogen, Bilirubin and Erythrocytes.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes _____X___ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Numerical specimen identification information can be entered manually via the touch
screen keyboard on the analyzer. The analyzer is also available for use with a bar code
scanner using the BC scanner interface located in the back of the instrument.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Cobas u 411 Urinalysis Test system can analyze multiple strips. The user dips the test
strip into the urine sample and places it on a sample tray. The test strip is then drawn
inside the analyzer to begin timing and analysis.

--- Page 14 ---
5. Calibration:
Calibration is based on the analysis of a calibration strip with known reflectance values.
The calibration strip is initially provided with the device and may also be purchased
separately. This internal calibration strip must be replaced at least once a year or in the
event that the cobas u 411 analyzer cannot be calibrated. This must only be performed
using the Control-Test M calibration strip manufactured by Roche Diagnostics. The
calibration strip is made of gray plastic material of constant reflectance characteristics.
Labeling recommends that the cobas u411 analyzer be calibrated once every four weeks.
6. Quality Control:
Quality Control is analyzed like the patient samples. The labeling recommends that a
positive and a negative external control be assayed daily according to state, federal and
local guidelines and 1) when starting a new lot of test strips 2) when starting a new
container of test strips 3) when there are questionable results 4) every 30 days to check
the storage conditions of the test strips 5) after using the calibration strip 6) after
maintenance or service and 7) when changing operators.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
