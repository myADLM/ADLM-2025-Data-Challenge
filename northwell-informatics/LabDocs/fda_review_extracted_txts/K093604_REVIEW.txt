H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Etest® is a quantitative technique for determination of antimicrobial susceptibility
of both non-fastidious Gram-negative and Gram positive aerobic bacteria such as
Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus and Enterococcus species and
fastidious bacteria, such as anaerobes, N. gonorrhoeae, S. pneumoniae,
Streptococcus and Haemophilus species. The system comprises a predefined
antibiotic gradient which is used to determine the Minimum Inhibitory
Concentration (MIC) in µg/mL of different antimicrobial agents against
microorganisms as tested on agar media using overnight incubation.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Etest® is a quantitative technique for determination of antimicrobial susceptibility
of both non-fastidious Gram-negative and Gram positive aerobic bacteria such as
Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus and Enterococcus species and
fastidious bacteria, such as anaerobes, N. gonorrhoeae, S. pneumoniae,
Streptococcus and Haemophilus species. The system comprises a predefined
antibiotic gradient which is used to determine the Minimum Inhibitory
Concentration (MIC) in µg/mL of different antimicrobial agents against
microorganisms as tested on agar media using overnight incubation.
This 510(k) submission is for the addition of the antibiotic moxifloxacin at
concentrations of 0.002 – 32 µg/mL to the Etest® strip for testing of Bacteroides
fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Clostridium perfringens, and
Peptostreptococcus spp.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use
4. Special instrument requirements:
Manual readings only
I. Device Description:
Etest® consists of a thin, inert and non-porous plastic strip, 5mm wide and 60 mm

--- Page 3 ---
long. One side of the strip carries a two-letter code designating the identity of the
antibiotic and is calibrated with MIC values in terms of µg/mL. A predefined
exponential gradient of the dried and stabilized antibiotic covers a continuous
concentration range across 15 two-fold dilutions of a conventional MIC method.
For anaerobic bacteria, the MIC interpretive criteria for moxifloxacin are as follows:
MIC (µg/mL) Interpretation*
≤ 2 Susceptible (S)
4 Intermediate (I)
≥ 8 Resistant (R)
*S = Susceptible: Attainable levels in blood or tissue on usual usage, including oral
administration when applicable.
I = Intermediate: The intermediate category implies clinical efficacy in body sites
where the drugs are physiologically concentrated (e.g. quinolones and B-lactams in
urine), or when a higher than normal dosage of drug can be used (e.g. B-lactams).
The “intermediate” category also includes a “buffer zone” which should prevent
small, uncontrolled, technical factors from causing major discrepancies in
interpretations, especially for drugs with narrow pharmacotoxicity margins.
R = Resistant to usually achievable systemic concentrations.

2. Methods for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing of Anaerobic Bacteria, Approved
Standard - 7th Edition, Document M11-A7
L. Test Principle:
The Etest® gradient technology is based on a combination of the concepts of dilution
and diffusion test methods for susceptibility testing. Etest® directly quantifies
antimicrobial susceptibility in terms of discrete MIC values. When the Etest® strip is
applied to an inoculated agar plate, the antibiotic is immediately released from the
plastic surface into the agar. A predefined, continuous gradient of antibiotic
concentrations is created and maintained directly underneath the strip. After
incubation whereby bacterial growth becomes visible, a symmetrical inhibition ellipse
centered along the strip will be seen. The MIC value in ug/mL is read where the
ellipse edge intersects the strip. Since Etest® generates MIC values which fall
between two-fold dilutions for interpretation; the MIC value read must be recorded to
the next two-fold dilution.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three study sites. Twenty seven
anaerobic organisms (11 B. fragilis, 10 B. thetaiotaomicrons, 3 C. perfringens,
and 3 Peptostreptococcus species) were tested at each site. Reference method
plates were read visually in accordance with CLSI standard. Reproducibility
was calculated as the percent of results for the combined sites which were
within +/- one doubling dilution of the mode MIC value for all sites.
For the sake of reproducibility calculations, off-scale values are handled in
two ways; “best case” and “worst case” scenarios. Best case calculation for
reproducibility assumes the off-scale result is within one well from the mode

[Table 1 on page 4]

MIC value. Worst case calculation for reproducibility assuming the off-scale
result is greater than one well from the mode MIC value. There were no off-
scale results in this study. So, only one value for overall reproducibility is
reported.
The overall reproducibility was 100% for 27 organisms with on-scale results
tested by Etest at 3 sites.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended QC isolates were tested a sufficient number of times with
acceptable results with the reference method. The Etest® results demonstrate
that the system can produce QC results in the recommended range.
Moxifloxacin quality control data for anaerobic bacteria from combined sites
is shown below. At least 20 test results per organism at each site were
available.

All QC values were in the expected range. Etest results with B. fragilis tended
towards a one doubling dilution higher than the reference standard.
A 0.5 McFarland was used to prepare inoculum for reference agar dilution
method. A 1.0 McFarland standard was prepared for the Etest inoculum.
Colony count was performed periodically at each site to verify that the
inoculum density was in the expected CFU/mL.
Inoculum density control for QC organisms ranged between
0.7X108 CFU/mL and 2.7 X 108 CFU/mL for direct inoculum E-test and
between 0.7X108 CFU/mL and 1.6 X108 CFU/mL for the reference agar

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The CLSI recommended agar dilution was used as the reference method to
determine susceptibility. Clinical testing was performed at three sites. Etest
and reference agar dilution were set up on Brucella blood agar (Brucella agar
with 5% blood and 1% hemin and vitamin k).
Clinical testing was performed on 418 anaerobic stock and fresh clinical
isolates (207 B. fragilis, 116 B. thetaiotaomicrons, 61 C. perfringens, and 34
Peptostreptococcus species). In total, 213 isolates were freshly collected
clinical isolates representing 51% of the total.
In addition, a set of 53 challenge isolates was tested (25 B. fragilis, 21 B.
thetaiotaomicron, 4 C. perfringens, and 3 Peptostreptococcus species).
Performance was compared to the CLSI agar dilution reference method. The
performance evaluations are shown in the tables below.

For 418 fresh clinical/stock isolates, the EA/CA for Etest were 96.7%, and 92.7%,
respectively.
For 53 challenge organisms, the EA /CA for Etest were 92.5%, and 88.7%,
respectively. The CA of 88.7% is acceptable in light of a very good EA and the
occurrence of only minor discrepancies (i.e. no maj or vmj discrepancies).
For 471 clinical and challenge organisms combined, the EA /CA for Etest were
96.2%, and 92.2%, respectively.
A total of 26 organisms were classified as resistant to moxifloxacin and there
were no maj or vmj errors seen.
