L. Test Principle:
The VITROS CO DT Slide method is performed using the VITROS CO DT Slides and
2 2
the VITROS Chemistry Products DT Calibrator Kit on VITROS DT60/DT60 II Chemistry
Systems. The VITROS CO DT Slide is a multilayered, analytical element coated on a
2
polyester support that uses direct potentiometry for measurement of ionic carbon dioxide.
The slide consists of two ion-selective electrodes, each containing a buffer layer, an ion
selective membrane layer, a reference layer, and a silver and a silver chloride layer coated
on a polyester support. The buffer layer adjusts the sample pH to 8.4 and maintains CO ,
2
HCO3-, and CO3-2 in proper equilibrium. The ion-selective membrane layer contains an
ion exchanger trioctylpropylammonium chloride (TOPA Cl) and a CO3-2 ionophore
decyltrifluoroacetophenone (DTFA). A drop of patient sample and a drop of VITROS DT
Reference Fluid on separate halves of the slide results in migration of both fluids toward
the center of the paper bridge. A stable liquid junction is formed connecting the reference
electrode to the sample indicator electrode. Each electrode produces an electrical potential
in response to the concentration of carbon dioxide applied to it. The potential difference
poised between the two electrodes is proportional to the carbon dioxide concentration in the
sample.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision study was performed using two quality control fluids and two levels
of calibrator fluids. Samples were analyzed in duplicate, twice a day for 21 days.
One VITROS DT 60 II instrument was used to collect the data. Results are
summarized below:
Concentration Within Within Within Within
n
(mmol/L) Day SD Day CV% Lab SD Lab CV%
10 0.2 2.0 0.2 2.0 84
20 0.6 3.0 0.6 3.0 84
25 0.6 2.4 0.7 2.8 84
36 0.7 1.9 0.9 2.5 84
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The measuring range of the CO assay is 5 – 50 mmol/L. A linearity study was
2
performed as follows. Two serum pools were prepared with total carbon dioxide
concentrations near the extremes of the calibration range. The high pool was 7%
BSA with an approximate CO concentration of 62.7 mmol/L. The low pool was
2
7% BSA with an approximate CO concentration of 0.5 mmol/L. The low and high
2
pools were mixed to obtain six admixtures of intermediate concentrations. Two to
four determinations of the six admixtures were tested on the VITROS DT60 II
Chemistry System. The experiment was performed three times, each test using one
reagent lot of CO slides. The measured CO values were plotted as the dependent
2 2
variable against the % high pool values as the independent variable. Linear
regression produced the following:
Lot 1 y = 0.94x + 3 r = 0.999
Lot 2 y = 0.96x + 3 r = 0.999
Lot 3 y = 0.94x + 4 r = 0.999
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Unopened VITROS CO DT Slides are stable until the expiration date on the carton
2
when stored refrigerated (2-8 °C) or frozen (≤-18 °C), and for less than 48 hours
when stored at room temperature (18–28 °C). Once opened, the VITROS CO
2
Slides are stable at room temperature (18–28 °C) for up to 15 minutes.
d. Detection limit:

The sponsor performed Limit of Blank (LOB), Limit of Detection (LOD) and Limit
of Quantitation (LOQ) studies based on the CLSI EP17-A guideline.
LOB determinations were made using an ultra filtered plasma sample devoid of
analyte on four reagent lots of VITROS CO DT Slides. Sample was assayed in 20
2
replicates per day for five test days on one VITROS DT60II Chemistry System for
a total of 100 replicates for each lot. LOB was determined to be 5.0 mmol/L.
LOD and LOQ was determined for four reagent lots of VITROS CO2 DT Slides by
evaluation of three low plasma samples having concentrations near or greater than
the LOB by increments of approximately two standard deviations. Samples were
assayed 10 replicates per day over five days on two VITROS DT60 II Chemistry
Systems for a total of 50 replicates. LOD and LOQ were determined to be 5.0
mmol/L.
The claimed measuring range of the candidate device is 5 to 50 mmol/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed using clinical serum samples to determine the
effect of various endogenous and exogenous substances using VITROS DT 60 II
analyzer. The following equations were used by the sponsor to calculate bias:
For exogenous substances: Bias = (“spike”: mean concentration of interfering
substance pool) – (“blank”: mean concentration of “control” pool).
For endogenous substances: Bias = (mean concentration of VITROS method) –
(mean concentration of reference method).
The following substances were tested with the VITROS CO DT Slides at a carbon
2
dioxide concentration of 28 mmol/L and found to cause a bias of ≤ 2 mmol/L at the
concentration shown.

b. Matrix comparison:
The assay may be performed using serum, lithium heparin plasma, or sodium
heparin plasma. To demonstrate this, the sponsor performed a study in which five
tube types (plain serum red top, serum separator tubes (SST), LiHep tubes, NaHep
tubes, and LiHep plasma separator tubes (PST)) were collected from each of 10
individual donors. Serum or plasma was separated from the cells. The bias for each
tube type was calculated using the plain serum red top as the reference when
analyzed using the VITROS DT 60 II analyzer. Across all tube types, 63% of the
comparisons to the reference red top tube were with ± 1 mmol/L, 89% were ± 2
mmol/L, and 100% were within ± 3 mmol/L.
