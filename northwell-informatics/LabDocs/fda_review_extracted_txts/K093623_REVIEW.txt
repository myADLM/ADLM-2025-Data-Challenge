H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The GEM Premier 4000 with iQM is a portable critical care system for use by
healthcare professionals to rapidly analyze whole blood samples at the point of health
care delivery in a clinical setting and in a central laboratory. The instrument provides
quantitative measurements of pH, pCO2, pO2, Na+, K+, CL_, Ca++, glucose, lactate,
hematocrit, total bilirubin, and CO-Oximetry (tHb, O2Hb, COHb, MetHb, HHb)
parameters. These parameters, along with derived parameters, aid in the diagnosis of a
patient’s acid/base status, electrolyte and metabolite balance and oxygen delivery
capacity. Total bilirubin measurements are used in the diagnosis and management of
biliary tract obstructions, liver disease and various hemolytic diseases and disorders
involving the metabolism of bilirubin. In neonates, the level of total bilirubin is used to
aid in assessing the risk of kernicterus.
Intelligent Quality Management (iQM) is used as the quality control and assessment
system for the GEM Premier 4000 system. iQM is an active quality process control
program designed to provide continuous monitoring of the analytical process with real-
time, automatic error detection, automatic correction of the system and automatic
documentation of all corrective actions, replacing the use of traditional external quality
controls. Facilities should follow local, state and federal regulatory guidelines to ensure
that a total quality management system is followed.
As part of this program, GEM CVP (Calibration Valuation Product) with CO-Ox, GEM
CVP tBili and GEM CVP Hematocrit are external solutions intended to complete the
calibration process and final accuracy assessment of the iQM cartridge calibration after
initial warm-up. The reported values for GEM CVP (two levels for pH, blood gases,
electrolytes, metabolites, total bilirubin, CO-Oximetry and hematocrit) must meet IL’s
specifications before the iQM cartridge can be used for patient sample measurements.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced
L. Test Principle:
Total bilirubin (tBili) measurement with whole blood and heparinized plasma is performed using
spectrophotometric multi-component analysis through the instrument’s existing CO-Oximetry
module. Following the electrochemical measurements for blood gases, electrolytes and
metabolites, a portion of the sample is chemically hemolyzed and brought into an optical cell
for the measurements.
The automated fetal hemoglobin (HbF) feature consisted of adding fetal-OxyHb (O2HbF) as a
factor to the existing multivariate analysis of O2Hb, COHb, HHb, turbidity and scatter performed
for CO-Oximetry analytes. This addition of the O2HbF spectra to the existing multivariate
analysis directly accounted for O2HbF impact without requiring an additional compensation step
by manual entry.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All the performance characteristics were performed using the GEM Premier 4000
analyzer.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
i.) A precision study was performed to verify the performance of the GEM Premier
4000 analyzer with the new total bilirubin parameter and the extended range for
total hemoglobin parameter. Precision testing was performed in-house on 5
different analyzers. Blood samples were collected from healthy adult volunteer
into heparinized tubes to generate whole blood and plasma samples for the
precision evaluations. Samples were altered with various levels of analytes to
span the claimed measuring ranges. Additional precision testing with tBili for 3
whole blood samples prepared each day at low levels (0.5, 1.0, and 2.5 mg/dL)
were evaluated in replicates of 10, twice a day for 5 consecutive days on 3 GEM
4000 analyzer. Within-run imprecisions with SD and %CV are shown in the
tables below:

4000 analyzers. The measured values were plotted against the expected values
and an appropriate line fitted by standard linear regression was performed. Eight
samples range from 0.0 to 40 mg/dL (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40 mg/dL) were tested.
The linear equation generated is Y=1.0517X - 0.0541 with regression coefficient
(R2) of 0.9999.
In addition, a linearity study was performed by using heparinized plasma samples
using protocol similar to the whole blood bilirubin linearity study performed
above. Eight samples range from 0.0 to 40 mg/dL (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40 mg/dL)
were tested. The linear equation generated is Y=1.0183X + 0.0385 with
regression coefficient (R2) of 0.9989.
The results of the linearity study and detection limits study support the sponsor’s
claimed that the total bilirubin assay is linear from 0.3 to 40 mg/dL for both whole
blood samples and heparinized plasma samples.
ii) Linearity for total hemoglobin measurement:
A linearity study was performed by using whole blood samples collected from a
healthy donor. The whole blood samples were pooled and the plasma red blood
cell ratio was modified to prepare a stock solution containing 25.5 g/dL total
hemoglobin. Different tHb levels were then prepared by serial diluting the stock
solution with a 50/50 of plasma and heparinized plasmalyte. Seven samples
containing different levels of tHb were tested in triplicate on four different GEM
Premier 4000 analyzers. The measured values were plotted against the expected
values and an appropriate line fitted by standard linear regression was performed.
Seven samples range from 2 to 25.5 g/dL (2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25.5 mg/dL) were
tested. The linear equation generated is Y=0.9697X + 0.2561 with regression
coefficient (R2) of 0.9997.

Level 2	42.14	0.2	0.2
Level 3	67.00	0.1	0.1

The results of the linearity study support the sponsor’s claimed that the total
bilirubin assay is linear from 3 to 23 g/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Total Bilirubin method is traceable to the NIST #916 reference materials, based on
the modified Jendrassik-Grof method.
Stability:
GEM CVP 2 with CO-Ox and GEM CVP 5 tBili are the same materials as previously cleared
CVP materials in k061974 and k861901.
GEM System Evaluator: Shelf-life stability was evaluated using real-time stability studies
and is still on-going. Protocols and acceptance criteria has been provided and found to be
acceptable. Unopened ampoules are stable until the expiration date shown on the label
when stored at 2-8oC and stable up to 4 months when stored at room temperature (15-
25oC).
GEM System Hematocrit Evaluator: Shelf-life stability was evaluated using real-time
stability studies and is still on-going. Protocols and acceptance criteria has been provided
and found to be acceptable. Unopened ampoules are stable until the expiration date
shown on the label when stored at 15-25 oC.
d. Detection limit:
The functional sensitivity was defined as the lowest concentration of an analyte at
which quantitative information is available and when a CV of ≤ 20% is obtained. A
whole blood sample contains low levels of total bilirubin and hemoglobin was tested
in 10 replicates on 5 different GEM Premier 4000 analyzers. The sponsor determined
that the functional sensitivity of total bilirubin is 0.3 mg/dL and 3.0 g/dL for total
hemoglobin.
The claimed measuring range of the total bilirubin test is 0.3 to 40 mg/dL and the
claimed measuring range of the total hemoglobin is 3.0 to 23 g/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was performed to evaluate the substances that may have
potential to interfere with the total bilirubin measurement. The following substances
were tested on the GEM Premier 4000 analyzer with the concentrations of the
interferents listed. Blood samples were first spiked with pooled clinical plasma
(containing high bilirubin levels) prior to spiking the interfering substances. One
level of bilirubin concentration was tested (10 mg/dL), except for Fetal hemoglobin
11

--- Page 12 ---
(tbili. tested at 5.0, 10.0 and 18.6 mg/dL). Interference testing was performed in
duplicate on multiple GEM Premier 4000 instruments. For fetal hemoglobin: Pooled
cord blood samples were used. Since these samples have different total hemoglobin
and total bilirubin levels, interference was assessed based on the deviation from the
predicate device (Radiometer ABL 735). The sponsor defined non-significant
interference as ± 0.4 mg/dL or < 10% difference between the spiked samples and the
un-spiked samples (between candidate device and predicate device for fetal Hb).
Based on the data, the sponsor claims no significant interference for the substances
and concentrations listed in the table below:

ii) Additional method comparison study was performed to demonstrate that the 100
µL sample port obtained equivalent results as the original 150 µL sample port.
Testing was performed using whole blood samples collected from a healthy donor
using heparinized tubes. Whole blood samples were modified to different levels
of Hb and tested in triplicate on 3 to 4 different GEM 4000 analyzers. The CO-
Oximetry parameters (analytes) obtained from 100 µL sample port was as follow:
O2Hb, COHb, tHb, Met Hb, and HHb. Linear regressions were calculated for the
100 µL sample port against the 150 µL sample port. Results are summarized
below:

heparinized plasma is an acceptable anticoagulant to use.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Automation of fetal hemoglobin correction for CO-Oximetry: The new software
applies the correction automatically based on the presence of fetal hemoglobin in the
sample without user input. This is a new feature and method comparison studies using
neonates had demonstrated that this feature is working properly (see M.2.a. above).
In addition, the impact of auto-HbF correction was assessed by comparing the results
of samples ranging from 0 – 85% HbF (674 adult donors + 235 cord blood samples
obtained through a commercial vendor). Samples were tested on five GEM analyzers
and the results compared to an IL 682 CO-Oximeter with fetal Hb correction mode.
The linear regression generated a slope of 0.9312 and a R2 of 0.9546.
CO-Oximetry measurements using 100 µL sample port was performed to verify the
precision of the CO-Oximetry parameters/analytes against the original 150 µL sample
port (normal sampling) Each day, two whole blood sample preparations (Level 1
and Level 2) were tested in triplicate twice per day in each sample modes for 5 days
on each of five different GEM 4000 analyzers for a total of 30 samples per instrument
and a pooled total of N=150 per level. With-run pooled variance of the 100 µL
sample port is within the sponsor’s acceptance criteria and all results (<1.0 SD) are
very similar to the original 150 µL sample port.
