L. Test Principle:
Polystyrene particles covalently coated with a monoclonal antibody (8D3) are
aggregated when mixed with samples containing D-dimer. The D-dimer cross-
linkage region has a stereosymmetrical structure, i.e., the epitope for the monoclonal
antibody occurs twice, one antibody suffices in order to trigger an aggregation
reaction. The reaction is then detected turbidimetrically via an increase in turbidity.
M. Performance Characteristics :
1. Analytical performance: Refer to original 510(k) submission (k081732) for
analytical performance data (precision/reproducibility, linearity/assay reportable
range, detection limit, analytical specificity, assay cut-off, traceability, stability,
expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods).
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 265 citrated samples were analyzed with the INNOVANCE® D-
Dimer assay and the VIDAS® D-Dimer Exclusion assay. The range of D-
dimer values in the correlation studies was 0.17 to 4.17 mg/L FEU.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
The INNOVANCE® D-Dimer assay was evaluated on the BCS ® / BCS® XP
System in a multi-center study to validate the exclusion of DVT using fresh
specimens collected from 455 consecutive patients presenting to the
emergency department with suspected DVT. Of these 455 patients, 29 were
excluded for a total of 426 patients available for final analysis.
All patients were evaluated using the Wells’ rules to estimate a likely or
unlikely pre-test probability (PTP) of DVT. Patient specimens were tested
with the INNOVANCE® D-Dimer assay and results were compared to a
cutoff value of 0.50 mg/L (FEU). A D-dimer result <0.50 mg/L (FEU) was
considered negative and a D-dimer result ≥0.50 mg/L (FEU) was considered
positive.
Patients with a positive D-dimer result were evaluated by imaging methods,
e.g. compression ultrasound and/or venography. Patients with a negative D-
dimer, as well as those with negative imaging results, were followed for three
months to evaluate potential development of DVT. All patients were subject
to imaging at the physician’s discretion. The overall prevalence of DVT in

those patients available for final analysis was 21.8 % (93/426). The following
instrument-specific sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value
(NPV) with upper and lower 95 % confidence limits (CL) were obtained with
the INNOVANCE ® D-Dimer clinical cutoff of 0.50 mg/L (FEU). All studies
demonstrated acceptable performance.
