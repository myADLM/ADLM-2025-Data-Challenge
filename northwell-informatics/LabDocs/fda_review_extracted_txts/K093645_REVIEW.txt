I. Device Description:
Dimension EXL™ Anemia Calibrator is a multi-analyte, liquid, frozen bovine serum
albumin based product containing ferritin from human liver, Vitamin B12 and Folate. The kit
consists of ten vials, two each of five levels containing 2.0 mL per vial for Level A, B, C, D,
& E.
All human source materials used to produce this product have been tested for HbsAg, anti-
HCV, HIV-1 and HIV-2 and found to be non-reactive by FDA licensed tests.

assay range.
Standard values are assigned to a master calibrator lot using USP grade B12 and
Folate into a bovine serum albumin matrix. Values are them assigned to the
commercial calibrator (bovine serum albumin matrix at target concentration) verses
master calibrator using chemistry analyzers calibrated with the master pool. Each
level is tested on multiple analyzers multiple times. Acceptance criteria and protocol
for assigning the value were provided and found to be acceptable.
The sponsor provided protocols and acceptance criteria to establish the stability of the
product, closed and open vial. Un-open calibrators stored frozen at -25 to -15˚C are
stable for 12 months. Un-open thawed calibrators stored at 2-8˚C are stable for 30
days. Open vial stability is 30 days when recapped immediately after use and stored
at 2-8˚C.
