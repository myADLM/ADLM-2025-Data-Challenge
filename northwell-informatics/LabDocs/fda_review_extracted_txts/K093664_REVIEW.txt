H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
Amphetamines II (AMPII) is an in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative and
semiquantitative detection of amphetamines and methamphetamines on COBAS
INTEGRA systems at cutoff concentrations of 300 ng/mL, 500 ng/mL and 1000
ng/mL when calibrated with d-methamphetamine. Semiquantitative test results
may be obtained that permit laboratories to assess assay performance as part of a
quality control program. Semiquantitative assays are intended to determine an
appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method
such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS).
Amphetamines II provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more
specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a
confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
(GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and
professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result,
particularly when preliminary positive results are used.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
a. Prescription use
b. Amphetamines II provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more
specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a

I. Device Description:
The Amphetamines II test is an immunoassay for use on automated clinical
chemistry analyzers. The device consists of two wet reagents; an antibody
working solution, and a drug-microparticle conjugate. During the assay, in the
absence of sample drug in urine, free antibody binds to the drug-microparticle
conjugates causing the formation of particle aggregates. When a urine sample
contains the drug in question, this drug competes with the particle-bound drug
derivative for free antibody. Antibody bound to sample drug is no longer
available to promote particle aggregation, and subsequent particle lattice
formation is inhibited. The rate of absorbance change is proportional to the
concentration of drug in the sample. Calibrators, ranging in concentration from 0-
5000 ng/mL depending on cutoff and test mode, are run with the assay.
Concentrations of controls and unknowns are calculated from the standard curve
in semi-quantitative mode. Results for controls or calibrators are determined as
preliminary positive or negative relative to the cutoff in qualitative mode.
C.f.a.s. DAT Qualitative Clinical, C.f.a.s. DAT Qualitative Plus, C.f.a.s. DAT
Qualitative Plus Clinical, Preciset DAT Plus I Calibrators, and Preciset DAT Plus
II Calibrators are ready to use, multianalyte calibrators prepared by the
quantitative addition of drug or drug metabolite to drug-free human urine and are
available separately from the reagent.
Control Set DAT I, II, and III, and Control Set DAT Clinical are ready to use
multianalyte controls prepared by the quantitative addition of drug or drug
metabolite to drug-free urine and are available separately from the reagent.

L. Test Principle:
The Amphetamines II assay is based on the kinetic interaction of microparticles in a
solution (KIMS) as measured by changes in light transmission. In the absence of sample
drug, soluble drug-polymer conjugates bind to antibody-bound microparticles, causing
the formation of particle aggregates. As the aggregation reaction proceeds in the absence
of sample, the absorbance increases. When a urine sample contains the drug in question,
this drug competes with the conjugate-bound drug derivative for microparticle-bound
antibody. Antibody bound to sample drug is no longer available to promote particle
aggregation, and subsequent particle lattice formation is inhibited. The presence of
sample drug diminishes the increasing absorbance in proportion to the concentration of
drug in the sample. Sample drug content is determined relative to the value obtained for a
known cutoff concentration of drug.

Precision studies were performed according to CLSI EP5-A2. Two separate
studies were conducted for d-methamphetamine and d-amphetamine for both
the qualitative and semi-quantitative assays for each cutoff (300 ng/mL, 500
ng/mL, 1,000 ng/mL). Samples were prepared by spiking a negative human
urine pool with the analyte of interest (d-methamphetamine or d-
amphetamine) at the following concentrations: zero drug, -75%, -50%, and -
25% below the cutoff, cutoff, and +25%, +50%, +75%, and +100% above the
cutoff. Samples were tested using one reagent lot, in 2 replicates per run, 2
runs per day for 21 days, total n=84 using one reagent lot. For the d-
amphetamine study, 10 calibrations were performed. For the d-
methamphetamine study, 8 calibrations were performed.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Recovery across the range was confirmed by serially diluting a spiked urine
pool containing drug in desired levels listed in the tables below to cover their
measuring ranges of 0-2,000 ng/mL and 0-5,000 ng/mL for both drugs. Each
sample was assayed on Integra 800 analyzer in the semi-quantitative mode.
The results were averaged and compared to the expected result and the percent
recovery was calculated. Sponsor calculated the % recovery by dividing the
recovered result by the target concentration and then multiplying by 100.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The assay is calibrated using d-methamphetamine. Calibrators for cutoff levels
(300 ng/mL, 500 ng/mL, 1000 ng/mL) included in this device have been
previously cleared in k060645. Control materials for three cutoff levels have been
previously cleared in k080183, k090939.
The sponsor performed both real time and accelerated stability studies for
shipping, open and closed vial reagent stability, and calibration stability. The
closed reagent stability at 2-8oC is one year, on-board stability is 56 days. The on-
board stability for open vials is 56 days. The sponsor recommends that users
should not freeze the reagents.
On board calibration stability testing was performed on the Integra 800.
Calibration is stable for 28 days.
d. Detection limit:
Performance at low drug concentrations in the semi-quantitative assay was
characterized by determination of recovery (see section b above).
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous Interfering Substances: Potential interference from substances
endogenous to urine were tested in both semi-quantitative and qualitative

mode by spiking the potentially interfering compound into human urine
samples containing either d-methamphetamine or d-amphetamine at
concentrations roughly equivalent to the ±25% cutoff concentration. The
stock solutions had an analytically confirmed concentration of 1 mg/mL based
upon their Certificates of Analysis. The median of triplicate observed values
for samples containing potentially interfering compounds were compared to
the median of triplicate values for control urine not spiked with potentially
interfering compounds. The percent recovery was calculated by dividing the
median concentration of the sample containing the potentially interfering
compound by the median concentration of the control and multiplying by
100. If interference was observed, the concentration of the interferent was
lowered and retested until no interference was observed.
Interferent concentrations were determined independently for
methamphetamines and amphetamines for both the semi-quantitative and
qualitative modes. Interfering substances were added to urine containing d-
methamphetamine (MAMP) or d-amphetamine (AMP) at - 25 % (Neg. Level)
and + 25 %(Pos. Level) of the cutoff level at the concentration listed in the
Cmpd. Conc. column. All samples were tested and the following results
were obtained on a COBAS INTEGRA 800 analyzer.
For the interference study for d-methamphetamine, 1 calibration was
performed during the study. For the interference study for d-amphetamine, 2
calibrations were performed during the study.

pH: To test for potential negative interference from pH, the sponsor prepared
samples containing target drug at levels ±25% of each cutoff concentration
with pH ranging from 4.5 to 8.0. Interference due to pH was ≤ 5% for the
semi-quantitative or qualitative modes for each cutoff for amphetamine or
methamphetamine from pH 4.5 to 8.0.
Specific Gravity: Urine specific gravity samples were prepared by an outside
laboratory to concentrations ranging from 1.001-1.034. Samples were
analyzed in both the semiquantitative and qualitative modes for amphetamine
and methamphetamine at ±25% of each cutoff concentration. Twenty
replicates were tested in both the semi-quantitative and qualitative modes at
each specific gravity level. The mean, standard deviation, and %CV were
calculated as well as number of crossovers. Interference due to specific
gravity was ≤ 5% in the semi-quantitative or qualitative modes for each cutoff
for amphetamine or methamphetamine between 1.001-1.034.
Cross Reactivity: Structurally Related: Cross-reactivity to structurally
related compounds was determined by spiking related compounds into drug
free human urine samples to produce assay results above and below the assay
cutoff. The samples were run in triplicate in both the semi-quantitative and
qualitative modes to determine the approximate quantity of each compound
that is equivalent in assay reactivity to the 300, 500, and 1,000 ng/mL assay
cutoff. One calibration was performed during structurally related cross
reactivity testing. The table below shows the semi-quantitative and qualitative
results of the study for each assay cutoff.

Cross Reactivity: Structurally Unrelated: Potential interference from structurally
unrelated compounds was tested in both semi-quantitative and qualitative mode by
spiking the potentially interfering compound into human urine samples containing
either d- amphetamine or d-methamphetamine at concentrations roughly equivalent to
±25% cutoff concentrations for each of the three cut-offs: 300 ng/mL, 500 ng/mL and
1,000 ng/mL for the semi-quantitative and qualitative modes. For both amphetamine
and methamphetamine, the interfering compounds were tested initially at 100,000
ng/mL. The d-methamphetamine and d-amphetamine stock solutions had analytically
confirmed concentrations of 1 mg/mL based upon Certificates of Analysis. If cross-
over of the cutoff occurred at this 100,000 ng/mL level, the concentration of the cross
reactant was reduced to determine the drug level at which the compound did not
cause cross-over of the cutoff. Concentrations were decreased for aspartame (40,000

ng/mL), methaqualone (75,000 ng/mL), phencyclidine (40,000 ng/mL), 9-THC
(10,000 ng/mL). None of these compounds gave values in the assay that were equal
to or greater than 0.19 % cross-reactivity and no results were greater than the assay
cutoffs (300 ng/mL, 500 ng/mL, and 1000 ng/mL), with the following exception:
The cross-reactivity for LSD was tested at a concentration of 2500 ng/mL.
The results obtained were 0.32 %, and 0.71 %, for the 300 ng/mL and 1000
ng/mL assay cutoffs respectively. One calibration was performed during the
structurally unrelated cross reactivity testing.
The control level samples recovered properly for the 300, 500, and 1000
ng/mL cutoffs in both semiquantitative and qualitative modes. The results
indicated that each compound listed below did not interfere with the
measurements of the device. The list of compounds tested is below.
Acetominophen Diphenhydramine Morphine
Acetylsalicylic acid Diphenylhydantoin Naloxone
Amitriptlyine Doxepin Naltrexone
Ascorbic acid Ecgonine Naproxen

Special Wash Programming:
There may be interference between certain combinations of Roche assays and
the AMPII assay. The sponsor maintains a master list of all special wash
programming instructions for the INTEGRA 800 analyzer which is accessible
to the user online. The master list recommends the specific order the AMPII
assay is to be analyzed in combination with other assays and when cleaning
steps are to be taken.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The accuracy of amphetamine and methamphetamine was determined against
GC/MS results for each cutoff concentration of 300 ng/mL, 500 ng/mL and
1,000 ng/mL. The sponsor used 36 unaltered negative urine samples and 36
unaltered positive samples for each drug. Further evaluation was performed
with 4 urines at concentrations from -50% of the cutoff to the cutoff, and from
the cutoff to +50% of the cutoff for each of the respective drugs (N=80). An
additional 4 samples were evaluated at the 500 ng/mL cutoff for
methamphetamine (N=84). Near cutoff samples are categorized based on the
d-amphetamine concentration only. A positive result would be expected
based upon the cross reactivity of the device, Amphetamines II, towards d-
amphetamine and d-methamphetamine. The positive and negative agreement
between the semi-quantitative results and GC/MS and the qualitative results
and GC/MS were identical for the 300 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL cutoffs for AMP
and for all MAMP cutoffs. Therefore, they are represented in one table for
agreement and discrepant results rather than two tables, respectively.
