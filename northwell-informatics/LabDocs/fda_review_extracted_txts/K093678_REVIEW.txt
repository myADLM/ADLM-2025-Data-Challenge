L. Test Principle:
The PlateliaTM Aspergillus EIA is a one-stage immunoenzymatic sandwich microplate
assay that detects galactomannan in human serum. The assay uses rat EBA-2 monoclonal
antibodies, which are directed against Aspergillus galactomannan, and have been
characterized in previous studies. The monoclonal antibodies are used to coat the wells of
the microplate and bind the antigen and to detect the antigen bound to the sensitized
microplate (conjugate reagent: peroxidase-linked monoclonal antibodies). Serum samples
are heat-treated in the presence of EDTA in order to dissociate immune complexes and to
precipitate serum proteins that could possibly interfere with the test. The treated serum
samples and conjugate are added to the wells coated with monoclonal antibodies, and
incubated. A monoclonal antibody-galactomannan monoclonal antibody/peroxidase
complex is formed in the presence of galactomannan antigen. The strips are washed to
remove any unbound material. Next, the substrate solution is added, which will react with
the complexes bound to the well to form a blue color reaction. The enzyme reaction is
stopped by the addition of acid, which changes the blue color to yellow. The absorbance
(optical density) of specimens and controls is determined with a spectrophotometer set at
450 and 620/630 nm wavelength.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
I. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility Studies in BAL
Inter and Intra-Assay variability was determined using a panel of four pooled patient
BAL fluid samples spiked with purified galactomannan (one negative, one high
negative, one low positive and one medium positive) at two external clinical sites (US)
and one internal site (France). Platelia™ Aspergillus EIA positive and negative kit
controls were included as panel members. Each of the four panel members and two
controls were tested in duplicate on two runs per day on five different days, on one lot,
(total replicates at each site =120). Two operators performed all the precision testing at
each site. The total number of replicates combining all three sites was 60 per panel
member and 360 total test results.
Intra-assay reproducibility was defined by the within-run variance of the mean optical
density (OD) and Index. Inter-assay reproducibility was defined by the total variance of
the mean optical density (OD) and Index. Total variance in this design will be the sum
of the between-day, between-run, between operator, between-site and within-run
variance components. The percent coefficient of variation (CV %) was defined as the
standard deviation divided by the mean concentration.

--- Page 5 ---
The sample size (n), mean optical density (OD) and Index, standard deviation (SD) and
percent coefficient of variation (CV %) for each panel member were calculated
according to the recommendations described in the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI) EP15-A2 Evaluation Protocol and the ISO/TR 22971 Technical Report
Site
Results were as follows:
*One statistical outlier was removed from the analysis.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
N/A
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Quality Control
Cut-off Control: The OD of each Cut-off Control Serum must be:
≥ 0.300 and ≤ 0.800
Positive Control: The index of the Positive Control Serum must be greater than 2.00.
I = OD. Positive Control (R5) > 2.00
Mean Cut-off Control OD
Negative Control: The index of the Negative Control Serum must be less than 0.40.
I = OD. Negative Control (R3) < 0.40
Mean Cut-off Control OD
Failure of any of the controls to meet the validity criteria described above renders the
assay invalid, and patient specimen results should not be reported. The operator may
decide to repeat the assay, after reviewing the procedure, or may contact the
manufacturer for assistance. If a repeat assay is performed, then a new aliquot of the
same sample should be used in the repeat assay.

--- Page 6 ---
Stability
Freeze/thaw studies were performed with this assay to validate four freeze/thaw cycles
for Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) fluid samples.
Three Aspergillus Galactomannan antigen negative [Low Negative (<0.1 Index),
Negative (0.1-0.2 Index) and High Negative (0.2-0.4 Index)] and two Aspergillus
Galactomannan antigen positive [(low positive (0.5-1.5 Index), and high positive (> 2.5
Index)] patient BAL fluid samples were tested based on results from testing after
thawing the selected BAL samples.
The index values of the BAL patient samples after the initial thawing above were used
as reference results for the freeze/thaw study comparison. Three further freeze/thaw
cycles were studied. Upon testing after thawing, the results were slightly lower than the
original test results. This is not unusual in that the original results were tested at a
different time and different kit lot and index values (not quantitative) can change.
Therefore, the method was revised on testing the BAL samples after the first thaw.
The revised sample ranges were low negative, negative, high negative, positive and high
positive. Each BAL sample was aliquotted and labeled in eight tubes, each at 300 μL per
tube (two tubes for each of 4 time points) and subjected to freeze-thaw treatment.
Results showed that the mean index values and the percent recovery for each sample
and freeze/thaw tested compared well to the mean of the four reference (first thaw)
results. In addition, the three negative samples remained negative throughout the study
and there was no significant change in the index value for each of them. The two
positive samples had percent recovery values that were within the acceptance criteria for
the study protocol (reference index +20%).
In conclusion, freeze/thaw cycles do not appear to have any adverse affect on the
Aspergillus galactomannan samples.
Expected Values
The expected prevalence of Invasive Aspergillosis varies with the patient population;
rates from 5-20% have been reported. The following results have been obtained from
clinical studies conducted on pediatric (age ≤ 21 years) patients in the United States and
on adult patients in North America.
BAL Samples
Two US studies were conducted on a total of 449 BAL samples from 178 Solid Organ
transplant (SOT) and lung transplant recipients with and without invasive aspergillosis
to determine the performance characteristics of the Platelia™ Aspergillus EIA kit with
Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid samples. Of these, there were 403 BAL samples from
167 solid organ and lung transplant recipients without invasive aspergillosis. Results
were as follows:

N/A
e. Analytical specificity:
A study to evaluate the effect of potentially interfering medical conditions unrelated to
Invasive Aspergillosis was performed with one lot of the Platelia™ Aspergillus EIA
kit. The following serum samples were tested for cross-reactivity with the Platelia™
Aspergillus EIA. A total of 151 sera were tested. Results were as follows:
BAL
Cross-reactivity studies using BAL fluid were not performed for this assay. The
EDTA/heat treatment of the samples precipitates the proteins and only the supernatant
is used for testing. Galactomannan is not affected in this process since it is heat-
resistant.
A limitation has been added to the Package Insert as follows:
“Cross-reactivity of BAL fluid samples with Mycoplasma or anaesthetic
drugs/lubricants used to numb the neck/throat area for the aspiration process has not
been evaluated.”
f. Assay cut-off
The cut-off studies for this assay with BAL fluid have not been performed for this
assay. The clinical studies included in this submission were conducted using the 0.5
cut-off recommended in the package insert for the current product.
