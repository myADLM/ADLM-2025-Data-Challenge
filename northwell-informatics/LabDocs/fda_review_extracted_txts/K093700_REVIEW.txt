M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and value assignment
Elecys HCG STAT CalCheck5 is standardized using internally produced master
calibrators which are traceable to the 4th International Standard for HCG (NIBSC)
75/589.
Each of the five CalCheck levels is value assigned using four Elecys 2010/cobas e411
and e601 analyzers. Each sample is tested in duplicate. The target value of each
CalCheck is the median of the observed values.
The labeling states that laboratories should establish appropriate acceptance criteria
when using the CalCheck for its intended use.
Stability
The Elecys HCG STAT CalCheck 5 formulation is identical to the Elecys HCG+β
CalCheck 5, the stability studies presented and cleared in the HCG+β CalCheck 5
submission, k092168, apply. The Elecys HCG STAT CalCheck 5 is stable until the
expiration date printed on the vial when stored unopened at 2-8˚C. The reconstituted
vials are stable for four hours at 20-25˚C.
