I. Device Description:
ADVIA Chemistry TDM DRUG Calibrator I is a liquid, human serum based product
containing multiple drugs, provided as ready to use. Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, and
Theophylline are value assigned for ADVIA Chemistry Systems.
Assigned analyte concentrations are shown below:
Analyte Concentration (µg/mL)
Analyte Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 4 Level 5
Phenobarbital 0.0 10.0 20.0 40.0 80.0
Phenytoin 0.0 4.5 9.0 18.0 36.0
Theophylline 0.0 5.0 10.0 20.0 40.0
The manufacturer includes the following as a caution in the product insert:
POTENTIAL BIOHAZARD: Contains human source material. While each human
serum or plasma donor unit used in the manufacture of this product was tested by
FDA-approved methods and found nonreactive for hepatitis B surface antigen
(HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis C (HCV), and antibody to HIV-1/2, all products
manufactured using human source material should be handled as potentially
infectious. Because no test method can offer complete assurance that hepatitis B or C
viruses, HIV, or other infectious agents are absent, these products should be handled
according to established good laboratory practices.

J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
Dade Behring Dimension Drug Calibrator
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):
k011035
3. Comparison with predicate:
The new device is physically the same as the predicate device. However the two
devices are for use on two different instrument systems. In addition the predicate
device has assigned values for lithium and digoxin (as well as phenobarbital,
phenytoin, and theophylline; the new device does not.

Traceability and value assignment
The calibrator value is described as traceable to USP materials. The process for
value assignment, and the uncertainty in measurement, was described in the
510(k). Initial value assignments involve alignment with a master lot of a
previously cleared Siemens calibrator, and confirmation by method comparisons
using patient samples.
The table below shows results for USP reference materials and Siemens Master
Lot calibrators measured as test samples after calibration with a representative lot
of ADVIA Chemistry DRUG Cal I .
