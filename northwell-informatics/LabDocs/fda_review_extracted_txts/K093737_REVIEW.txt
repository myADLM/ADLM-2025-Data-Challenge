b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
Validation was performed by bidirectional sequencing of HemosIL FII & FV
DNA Control.
Stability
Upon receipt and after opening, the material should be stored at 2° - 8°C.
HemosIL FII & FV DNA Control material is shipped with a "Do not freeze"
warning in the device labeling.
Unopened HemosIL FII & FV DNA Control material is stable for 18 months
when stored refrigerated (2° - 8°C). Opened material returned to the
refrigerator (2° - 8°C) shortly after use is stable for thirty (30) days from the
date of opening.
Real-Time Stability Study
Three different lots of HemosIL FII & FV DNA Control were tested at
defined time intervals for up to 570 days, 565 days and 64 days, respectively,
using the Xpert HemosIL Factor II & Factor V Assay. Data from this on-
going real-time stability study supports a shelf-life of 18 months.
Open-Vial Stability Study
Vials from two different lots of HemosIL FII & FV DNA Control were
opened, tested in duplicate at Day 0 and stored at 2-8°C for 34 days. Normal
laboratory use was simulated over the test period by periodically warming the
vials to room temperature and pipetting the control material, but then
returning it to the vial. At Day 34, the open vials were tested in duplicate and
the Ct (Crossing Threshold) results compared to the Ct results from time zero.
The study demonstrated no loss of signal when used in Xpert HemosIL Factor
II & Factor V Assay performed on the GeneXpert Dx Systemassay at the end
of the test period.
Stress Testing Study
Shipping Study:
Two different lots of HemosIL FII & FV DNA Control were shipped in
March via US Postal Service across the U.S. from Maine to California
without ice packs. After receipt in California, the controls were left at
room temperature for 3 days before being shipped back to Maine, again

without ice packs. The total transit time was 13 days. The returned
controls were tested using Xpert HemosIL Factor II & Factor V Assay on
the GeneXpert Dx System. The data demonstrates product stability during
prolonged shipping without refrigeration.
Freeze/Thaw Study:
Two different lots of HemosIL FII & FV DNA Control were frozen at -
20ºC for 48 hours and then thawed for testing using Xpert HemosIL
Factor II & Factor V Assay on the GeneXpert Dx System. The data
demonstrates one freeze/thaw cycle will not degrade the product.
Expected values
The expected results with the HemosIL FII & FV DNA Control using the
FDA-cleared Xpert HemosIL FII & FV genotyping assay on the GeneXpert
Dx System are heterozygous genotype for both Factor II 20210G>A and
Factor V 1691G>A (Leiden) mutations.
