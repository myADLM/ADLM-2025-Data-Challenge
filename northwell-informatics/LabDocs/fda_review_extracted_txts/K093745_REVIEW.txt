M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run precision was measured by using heparinized anti-coagulated
whole blood at five different glucose concentrations. Each sample was tested
on 3 lots of test strips on 30 meters (10 meters per test strip lot). Ten
replicates were tested per meter, test strip lot, and glucose concentration,
(N=100 per test strip). Results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity study was designed based on CLSI EP6-A guideline. Nine human
whole blood samples were drawn into heparinized tubes and spiked to the
target analyte levels. 7 target levels were prepared with glucose
concentrations ranging from 20 to 600 mg/dL (20, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500,
and 600 mg/dL). All samples were tested on 3 lots of test strips in duplicate
on the OneTouch Verio meter. All samples were also tested on the YSI 2300
analyzer to generate the expected values. The observed values were plotted
against the expected values and an appropriate line fitted by standard linear
regression was generated with results summarized below:
Strip Lot Slope 95% CI slope Intercept 95% CI R2
intercept
1 0.947 0.945, 0.95 1.866 1.457, 2.274 0.998

3 0.949 0.947, 0.952 1.924 1.531, 2.318 0.999
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claim that the glucose assay is
linear from 20-600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: OneTouch Verio Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable
to the NIST SRM 917b reference material.
Value assignment:
The value assignment of the OneTouch Verio control solutions were
determined by an in-house procedure. The control solutions were prepared by
gravimetric addition of glucose to achieve target values of 120 ± 5 mg/dL for
level 1 and 350 ± 15 mg/dL for level 2 and values were confirmed by a
laboratory method. Verification of the control solutions were tested with 100

test strips and 10 meters with each level and the target ranges were set at the
following:
Glucose control solution Target Acceptable range
concentration
Level 1 (medium) 120 mg/dL 120 ± 15% (102-138 mg/dL)
Level 2 (high) 350 mg/dL 350 ± 15% (298-403 mg/dL)
Stability:
Real time stability was performed to assess the shelf-life and open-vial
stability of the control solutions and test strips. Stability studies protocol and
acceptance criteria were provided and found to be adequate. Unopened
control solutions have a 15 month shelf life and are stable for 3 months after
first use when stored at 5-30oC (41-86 oF) . The sponsor claimed that the
unopened test strips have a 12 month shelf-life and are stable for 3 months
after first use when stored at 5-30oC (41-86 oF). This information is provided
in the labeling of the test strips and control materials.
d. Detection limit:
See linearity study above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference study was designed according to CLSI EP7-A2 guideline. 23
common endogenous and exogenous interference substances were evaluated
by spiking venous blood with two levels of glucose concentrations (60 mg/dL
and 240 mg/dL). The glucose samples were spiked with the potentially
interfering compounds and tested on 3 lots of test strips. Bias was calculated
as the mean percent difference in glucose reading between the test and control
concentration groups. All samples tested showed % bias within ± 10%
between the test and the control groups. The sponsor claims no significant
interference (≤ 10% difference) for the substances and concentrations shown
in the table below:

The sponsor has the following limitations in their labeling:
“Acetaminophen, uric acid and ascorbic acid (vitamin C) (when occurring in
blood at normal or at high therapeutic concentration) do not significantly
affect results. However, abnormally high concentration in blood may cause
inaccurately low results.”
“The OneTouch Verio Blood Glucose Monitoring System should not be used
by patients within 24 hours of receiving a D-xylose absorption test as it may
cause inaccurately high results.”
“Critically ill patients should not be tested with blood glucose meters. Test
results can be falsely low if the patients is severely dehydrated, in shock, or in
hyper-osmolar state (with or without ketosis).”
Hematocrit Study - The sponsor performed hematocrit studies using five
different hematocrits (Hct) (19, 30, 40, 50 and 61%) levels across the glucose
measuring range (20-600 mg/dL). At each hematocrit level, 4 samples at
glucose concentration of 30, 65, 240, and 450 mg/dL were tested against the
YSI method. 3 lots of test strips were tested on 12 meters and the values were
compared to the YSI method and the nominal hematocrit level (40%). Results
are summarized below:

The sponsor claimed that hematocrit values between 20% to 60% do not
significantly affect the glucose results.
Altitude Study - A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of altitude on
the OneTouch Verio BGMS. 3 lots of test strips were tested on 16 meters
using blood from three donors at three glucose concentrations (70, 240, and
450 mg/dL) at three altitude levels (3000, 6000, and 10,000 feet), and sea
level (0 feet) as a control. Testing was performed in a hyperbaric chamber.
Each venous blood sample was also tested by the YSI 2300 analyzer. The
meter readings obtained were compared to the YSI method and the percent
bias was determined at each level against the YSI results. Bias was within ±
10% for all three altitude levels tested. Based on the data, the sponsor claims
that the OneTouch Verio BMGS can be used at altitude up to 10,000 feet.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
System accuracy study was performed according to the ISO 15197 document
using 100 participants from a diabetic clinic. A trained healthcare
professional (HCP) collected fingersticks on each participant. Capillary
samples were collected and measured on the YSI 2300 analyzer (reference
method) and from the same fingersticks, the OneTouch Verio BGMS was
tested in duplicate with 3 lots of test strips. The range of glucose values for the
fingerstick samples was 36-465 mg/dL. In order to obtain sufficient samples
in the lowest and highest concentration intervals, 22 capillary samples were
altered. Samples that were <80 mg/dL and >321 mg/dL were contrived
samples and samples between 80 to 321 mg/dL were natural samples.
Regressions analysis results are summarized below:

A user performance study was performed to compare the lay user self-test
results (with fingertip) and the YSI method. Study was performed in two
clinical sites with 156 subjects, including 51% male and 49% female. 3 lots
of test strips were used and each lay user tested two lots of strips randomly.
Only the first test strip results were used for the data analysis. The range of
glucose values for the fingerstick samples was 37.7-443.3 mg/dL. Linear
regressions analysis results are summarized below:

Total accuracy agreement: 100% (156/156) of all the individual glucose
results fall within ±15 mg/dL of the YSI results of glucose concentration
<75 mg/dL and within ±20% of the YSI results of glucose concentration

Alterative testing sites (AST) for blood glucose measurement were evaluated
with 164 layusers during a user performance study. Testing was performed
by the lay user using the forearm and palm (thenar and hypothenar regions) to
show comparable performance at times of steady state conditions with the
fingertip glucose results measured with the YSI method. The range of glucose
values for these samples was 48.9-443.5 mg/dL (by the finger). Two subjects
did not obtain a palm result and 12 subjects did not obtain a forearm result due
to error messages or insufficient blood. One result from the forearm was
excluded because the result was marked as a control result. The linear
regressions were summarized below:

solutions to prevent control results from being stored in the internal memory as
patient result. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are
provided in the labeling. The control solution readings are not included in the
average of the patient results. An acceptable range for each control level is printed
on the control solutions vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the
control result falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. A usability study was performed to assess the readability of the labeling by
recruiting 100 lay users (aged 18-70 yrs old) who were provided with the test kit
containing labeling for the US market. Participants varied in age, education,
country of origin, and were about evenly divided between men and women. These
lay users also completed a questionnaire to response to whether the device is easy
to use and the Instructions for use were written in a way that makes it easy to use.
The majority of the users responded that the device is very easy to use.
2. Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the results showed that
the labeling (User Guide, test strip package insert and control solution package
insert) were written at the 8th grade level.
3. Customer service is available 24/7, 365 days a year. Toll free phone number is 1-
800-227-8862 for customer support.
4. A sample volume study was performed to verify the test strip sample volume
requirement and the test strip fill error requirement established for the OneTouch
Verio BGMS. Three lots of test strips were tested using blood from three donors,
each adjusted to a glucose concentration of 65 and 450 mg/dL. Blood at each
concentration was applied to strips at five target sample volumes of 0.25, 0.3,
0.35, 0.4 and 0.45 µL. Protocols and acceptance criteria were provided and found
to be acceptable. The sponsor concluded that sample volume of ≥0.4 µL
produced accurate results and samples <0.4 µL give an error code.
5. Temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated for temperatures
ranging from 5oC to 45oC and relative humidity from 10% to 90%. Protocol and
15

--- Page 16 ---
acceptance criteria were provided and found to be acceptable. The results
supported the sponsor’s claimed operating temperature from 6oC to 44oC(43oF to
111oF) and relative humidity range from 10% to 90%.
6. EMC testing was evaluated and certified by CSA International and a letter of
attestation was issued to LifeScan on December 3, 2008.
7. The device is intended for single-patient use only. Clorox Germicidal Wipes with
EPA registration # 67619-12 was validated demonstrating complete inactivation
of live virus for use with the meter and lancing device. The sponsor also
demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the external materials
of the meter and lancing device after 2879 cleaning cycles and 412 disinfection
cycles designed to simulate 4 years of device use.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
