K. Standard/ Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
• ISO15197:2003- In vitro diagnostic test systems – Requirements for blood-glucose
monitoring systems for self-testing in managing diabetes mellitus.
L. Test Principle:
The test is based on electrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of capillary
action. The electrical current generated by the reaction of glucose with the reagent of the
strip is measured by the meter and is displayed as the corresponding blood glucose level.
The strength of the current produced by the reaction depends on the amount of glucose in
the blood sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The AG-695 Single and AG-695 Multi are the same meters and the AG-696 Single
and AG-696 Multi are the same meters. All four meters use the same test strip;
however they have separate names due to single patient use and multi-patient use.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-day precision studies were performed using venous whole blood samples
spiked with five different glucose concentrations, three different test strip lots, 10
different AG-695, and 10 AG-696 blood glucose meters. Each glucose level was
evaluated 10 times for a total of 100 tests per each glucose level for each type of
meter (AG-695 and AG-696). Results are summarized below:

614 mg/dL) as measured by YSI. Each level was measured 5 times and the values
from the AG-695 meter were compared with those obtained from YSI-2300. The
same evaluation was performed with the AG-696 meter with samples ranging from 19
to 607 mg/dL glucose (19, 38, 91, 146, 214, 262, 321, 400, 493, 570, 607 mg/dL) as
measured by YSI. Results from regression analysis:

The sponsor claims that the system accuracy of the AG-695 and AG-696 meters is
calibrated to a laboratory analyzer, YSI 2300. A method comparison was performed
using the YSI 2300 as the comparative method. See Comparison studies in 2 a below.
Two levels of control material, Level II (96 to 144 mg/dL) and Level III (250 to 420
mg/dL) are available for use with this test system. These control solutions were
previously cleared under k093262. The meters in the current submission use the
same test strip as was previously cleared (k093262). For the current submission,
value assignment was performed by testing each level of control solution 100 times
using 5 of each of the meters in this submission (AG-695 and AG-696).
c. Detection limit:
The reportable range for the both the AG-695 and AG-696 Blood Glucose Monitoring
Systems is 20 to 600 mg/dL. This range was verified by the linearity study (M.1.b)
above.
d. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor spiked venous whole blood samples with glucose to obtain concentrations
of 80, 120, and 350 mg/dL. Each of these samples was divided into a test pool and a
control pool and each potential interfering substance was added to the test pool.
Each level was analyzed 5 times total with two AG-695 meters and 5 times total with
two AG-696 meters with 3 lots of glucose strips. The % difference between the
sample containing interfering substance and the control sample was calculated. The
sponsor defines no significant interference as ≤10% difference. Results are presented
in the table below:
Potential Concentration Potential Concentration

Substance Significant Substance Significant

Higher levels of the following substances were tested and found to interfere; therefore,
the following are included in the user manual and test strip insert: “the following
substances at levels greater than normal or therapeutic levels may cause significant
interference: acetaminophen, ascorbic acid, uric acid, dopamine and L-dopa” and “do
not use icterus samples”.

Hematocrit study:
The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated using whole blood samples
with hematocrit levels of 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 and 55% spiked with glucose to achieve 7
concentrations ranging from 21 to 598 mg/dL. Each sample was then tested in
triplicate using the AG-695 meter and in triplicate using the AG-696 meter. For each
sample the value obtained from the meter was compared with that obtained from the
YSI-2300 analyzer. The % biases to YSI for both meters were ≤ 15% for samples
within the claimed range of 30 to 55% hematocrit.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
System Accuracy:
The sponsor performed accuracy studies to demonstrate that the AG-695 and AG-696
blood glucose monitoring systems are equivalent to the reference method, YSI 2300.
Capillary samples from 100 volunteers were evaluated. The samples used for the
AG-695 had glucose concentrations, according to YSI, ranging from 21.6 to 504
mg/dL and those used for the AG-696 ranged from 23.4 to 467 mg/dL. To obtain
blood glucose concentrations <50 and > 400 mg/dL, samples were allowed to
glycolize or were spiked to achieve the desired glucose concentration. The results
relative to YSI are summarized in the tables below:

users performed their own finger sticks and performed the test by following a large
print user’s manual in English for the meter (AG-695 or AG-696). The technician
then performed the testing on an additional fingerstick sample from each user. A
sample was then taken from each participant by the technician and measured by YSI-
2300. The samples ranged from 53.9 to 324 mg/dL glucose as measured by YSI.
Labeling states that this system contains a speaking function that provides audible test
results for users with impaired vision and the audible function does not provide

2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes
for this line of product types:
Yes X or No .
The applicant has provided documentation that indicates the device was designed and
developed under good software life-cycle processes.
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied
directly to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip.
Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip there are no special
handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
The meter uses a code strip. To code the meter the code strip is inserted into the
meter. Once the “OK” appears on the screen, the meter is coded and the code strip
can be removed.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor provides one level of glucose control solution, Level II (cleared under
k093262), with this kit. Additional (Level III) control solution (also cleared under
k093262), is also available for purchase separately, as stated in the labeling. The
labeling provides recommendations on when to test control materials. To perform a
control test the user is instructed to press the S button in step 5. Once the “CTL”
appears on the screen the control results will be prevented from being stored in the
memory. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial
label. If the control values fall outside these ranges, the user is referred to customer
support for problems and more information.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Altitude Studies: Capillary whole blood samples from 20 volunteers with glucose
concentrations, according to YSI, ranging from 70 to 415 mg/dL for the AG-695 meter
and 68 to 395 mg/dL for the AG-696 meter were measured at 11,975 feet (3650 meters).
All individual measurements resulted in % biases less than +/-10% relative to the YSI
value. The results support the claims in the labeling that altitudes up to 11,975 feet have
no significant effect (relative to YSI) on blood glucose measurements from the AG-695
and AG-696 meters.

2. Temperature and humidity studies: The sponsor performed temperature and humidity
studies using venous blood samples (with glucose concentrations of 52, 168 and 418
mg/dL) and 3 of each meter (AG-695 and the AG-696). Several temperatures ranging
from 50 to 104°F (10 to 40°C) to and relative humidity of 10 to 90% were tested and
meter results compared to YSI values. Six temperature and humidity combination were
tested including low temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity, high
temperature/low humidity, and high temperature/high humidity. Results demonstrated
that both devices can be used in conditions of 50 to 104°F (10 to 40°C) with relative
humidity below 90% and stored at 39 to 86°F and relative humidity below 85%. No
significant effect (relative to YSI) was observed at the temperature and humidity
combinations tested. The results support the claims in the labeling that the system can be
used can be used in conditions of 50 to 104°F (10 to 40°C) with relative humidity of 10
to 90%.
3. Insufficient and excessive sample volume studies were performed using venous blood
samples (approximately 45, 55, 115, 140, 230, 376, and 453 mg/dL) and 3 of each meter
(AG-695 and AG-696). Five were tested (0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 1.0 and 1.5 μL) were tested
around the recommended sample volume of 0.7 μL. Seven glucose concentrations were
tested ranging from approximately 45-450 mg/dL, as determined by the YSI. Results
support the claimed sample volume of 0.7 μL.
4. Infection Control Studies: The devices are intended for single-patient use (AG-695 Single
and AG-696 Single) or multiple-patient use (AG-695 Multi and AG-696 Multi).
Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meters and
lancing device by an outside commercial testing demonstrating complete inactivation of
hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, CaviWipes (EPA Registration #
46781-8). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that
there was no change in performance or external materials for each of the meters and
lancing device after 11,000 cleanings and 11,000 disinfection steps with CaviWipes. The
robustness studies were designed to simulate 3 years of multiple-patient use and 5 years
of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated
cleaning and disinfection procedures.
5. The sponsor provided a readability study and obtained SMOG Grade Level Scores of 8
for the User’s Manual, test strip insert and control solution insert.
6. The sponsors provided the appropriate documentation certifying that electromagnetic
testing (EMC) had been performed and the AG-695 and AG-696 were found compliant
(IEC 61326, IEC 61010).
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
