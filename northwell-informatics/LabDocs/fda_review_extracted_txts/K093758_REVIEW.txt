L. Test Principle:
BGM Galectin-3 is a microtiter plate-based ELISA for the quantitative determination
of galectin-3 levels in human serum and plasma. The Galectin-3 Assay utilizes two
monoclonal antibodies against galectin-3. One rat monoclonal anti-mouse galectin-3
antibody is coated onto the surface of the wells in a microtiter plate and serves as the
capture antibody to bind galectin-3 molecules in samples, while the other mouse
monoclonal anti-human galectin-3 antibody is provided in solution and functions as
the tracer antibody for detecting galectin-3 molecules bound to the capture antibody.
The microtiter plate is ready to use.
Standards, quality control materials, and patient samples are introduced into the wells
and incubated for 60 minutes. During this incubation, the galectin-3 present in the
standards and samples is bound to the capture antibody coated onto the well surface.
A subsequent wash step removes any unbound galectin-3.
The tracer antibody, a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeled anti-galectin-3 antibody,
is then introduced into the well and incubated for 60 minutes. During this time, an
antibody-antigen-antibody complex is formed.
After a wash step to remove any unbound tracer antibody, the tetramethyl benzidine
substrate is added, yielding a blue color in the presence of HRP. The color
development is stopped after 20 minutes by the addition of sulfuric acid, changing the
color to yellow that can be read at an absorbance of 450 nm. The test results of the
samples are read from the calibration curve. The absorbance is proportional to the
galectin-3 levels in the samples.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the Galectin-3 Asay was assessed in an evaluation according to
CLSI EP5-A2 Guidelines. EDTA plasma pools spanning a range of galectin-3
concentrations were analyzed in duplicate with 2 runs per day over 20 days
using one reagent lot, two operators and one microtiter plate reader. Estimates
of within-run, run-to-run, day-to-day and total precision were calculated. The
results are summarized in the table below:

Additional precision studies were performed at three CLIA-certified clinical
laboratories. Three EDTA plasma pools spanning a range of galectin-3
concentrations were analyzed in quadruplicate with 2 runs over 20 days for
Site 1, 17 days for Site 2 and 18 days for Site 3 using two reagent lots and 3
different microtiter plate readers (one at each site) and a total of four
operators. Pooled human plasma was divided and spiked to yield 3
concentrations spanning the measurement range. The results are summarized

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was calculated based on CLSI guideline EP6-A, Evaluation of
Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures, A Statistical Approach.
The claimed measurement range of the assay is 1.4 to 94.8 ng/mL. Low and
high serum samples were mixed in different fractional parts to create an 11-
level dilution series of samples with equally spaced concentrations of galectin-
3 ranging from 1.4 to 94.8 ng/mL. Samples were tested in duplicate. Linearity
of BGM Galectin-3 was demonstrated and supported the claimed
measurement range. The regression equation for the linear regression studies
is y = 0.9905x – 0.41. The percent recoveries for each dilution level ranged
from 95.5 to 101.5 %.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Galectin-3 kit includes two lyophilized quality control materials (C1 and
C2). The controls are assayed materials that are supplied with target values
and QC ranges. Lot-specific target values and ranges have been assigned with
multiple operators over multiple days. The lower control (C1) is formulated
with a target galectin-3 concentration of 18.4 ng/mL and is designed to
monitor the performance of patient specimens near the clinical cutoff level of
17.8 ng/mL and specimens in the lower or normal range corresponding to the
lower end of the standard curve. The higher control (C2) is formulated with
approximately 69 ng/mL galectin-3 and is designed to monitor the
performance of the assay for patient specimens with higher galectin-3 values
and the upper end of the standard curve. The controls are comprised of
recombinant galectin-3 in a protein matrix. The controls are stable for 12
months. After use, remaining reconstituted controls may be stored for a
maximum of 10 days at 2-8°C.
Galectin-3 is calibrated with a set of seven standards that are prepared by the
user by serially diluting a reconstituted vial of the standard (S1). The seven
standards once prepared are stable for a maximum of 10 days at 2-8°C . Two
vials of lyophilized standard (S1) are supplied with each kit. The calibrators
(standard S1) are stable for 12 months un-opened. After reconstitution,
remaining standard may be stored for a maximum of 10 days at 2-8°C.
The calibrator (SI) is prepared from recombinant human galectin-3 protein
expressed in E. coli. A stock solution of galectin-3 is prepared and the
concentration is determined spectrophotometrically in-house. From the stock
solution, 10 working calibrators are prepared and used to derive a calibration
curve for value assignment of the lyophilized calibrator materials (standard
S1) which are supplied with assay kit.

d. Detection limit:
LoB, LoD and LoQ were determined according to the CLSI guideline EP 17-
A. The limit of blank (LoB) was determined as the 95th percentile value of
forty-eight (48) replicate measurements of the BGM Galectin-3 Assay Buffer.
The limit of detection (LoD) was determined as LoD = LoB + cβ SDs, where
SDs is the pooled standard deviation from four (4) serum samples with
different levels of galectin-3, each of which was measured in thirty-two (32)
replicates and ß is the 95th percentile of the standard Gaussian distribution
corrected for the degree of freedom. The Limit of quantitation (LoQ) was
specified as the lowest galectin-3 concentration that is above the LoD and
corresponds to a coefficient of variation (CV) of no more than 10.4% in the
four serum samples.
Limit of Blank (LoB): LoB = 0.86 ng/mL
Limit of Detection (LoD): LoD = 1.13 ng/mL
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ): LoQ = 1.32 ng/mL
The lower limit of the measuring range was set at 1.4 ng/mL based on the
linearity studies (see section M[b] above).
e. Analytical specificity:
Galectin-3 was evaluated for the effects of potential interfering substances,
both endogenous and exogenous, according to the recommendations of the
CLSI EP7-A guideline. In the studies, potential interferents were added to
EDTA plasma samples with levels of galectin-3 at approximately 12, 22 and
40 ng/mL. Conjugated bilirubin (up to 16.8 mg/dL), unconjugated bilirubin
(up to 40.3 mg/dL), albumin (BSA, up to 12 g/dL), triglycerides (up to 3000
mg/dL), cholesterol (up to 747 mg/dL), and creatinine (up to 5 mg/dL) do not
show any significant interference with the assay (defined by the sponsor as
≥10 % interference). Purified hemoglobin (up to 500 mg/dL) does not show
significant interference in BGM Galectin-3; however, packed blood cell lysate
does show interference ≥ 10%. Human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) and
rheumatoid factor (RF) above 50 IU/mL cause significant positive
interference with BGM Galectin-3. High levels of gamma globulins (> 2.5
g/dL) may cause false elevation in galectin-3 levels. The following table is
included in the labeling:
7

--- Page 8 ---
BGM Galectin-3 measurements were not significantly affected (defined by the
sponsor as ≥10 % interference) when tested in the presence of 34 common
pharmaceutical substances; including heart failure drugs.
Common Drugs That Did Not Show Significant Interference with BGM
Galectin-3:
Studies were performed which demonstrated that there is no high dose hook
effect at galectin-3 levels up to 500 ng/mL. High concentrations of galectin-3
were spiked into different matrices (serum and EDTA plasma) and analyzed
in duplicate. At spiked concentrations of 250 and 500 ng/mL, readings were
outside the optical range of the plate reader indicating values greater than the
measuring range of the assay.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
See clinical studies in M (3) and M (4) below
b. Matrix comparison:
The BGM Galectin-3 assay has been validated for use with EDTA plasma or
serum samples. The equivalence of these sample matrices were demonstrated in a
study of forty-nine (49) matched natural serum and EDTA-plasma samples with
values spanning the measurement range. The samples had values ranging from
5.45 to 90.61 ng/mL. The regression equation for the study was y = 0.96x + 0.72.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
See 3(c) below
b. Clinical specificity:
See 3(c) below
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Cutoff values were determined in an independent, controlled multi-center
clinical study in Europe enrolling NYHA I, II, III and IV subjects (see section
M [4] Clinical Cutoff below for further details).
To validate the clinical effectiveness of the cut-off values for the BGM
Galectin-3 assay, galectin-3 levels were measured in a set of 895 banked
EDTA-plasma samples from chronic heart failure participants in the United
States and Canada in a controlled multi-center clinical study, the Heart
Failure: A Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exercise Training (HF-
ACTION) study. The HF-ACTION study involved 2,331 chronic HF patients
with left ventricular dysfunction and with NYHA class II, III or IV symptoms.
The average age of the 895 participants whose galectin-3 levels were assessed
in the clinical validation study was 58 years, 29% were female, and 36% were
non-white. A statistical analysis (sensitivity analysis) was performed
comparing the set of 895 HF-ACTION subjects having evaluable galectin-3
values with all other HF-ACTION participants (1436), and it was found that
9

--- Page 10 ---
the clinical validation results based on the evaluable set of 895 subjects were
robust and representative of the larger study population. In this sensitivity
analysis, galectin-3 values were imputed conservatively for the 1436
remaining patients in the dataset based on the probability of the assay
categorizing a patient into a high or low risk group. The difference in survival
curves for the risk groups remained statistically significant, indicating that the
results on the evaluable subset (895) were robust and representative of the
entire study population. The median follow-up time was approximately 30
months. Chronic heart failure participants were categorized based on galectin-
3 risk categories defined below:
The derived galectin-3-dependent risk categories are as follows:
• galectin-3 greater than 25.9 ng/mL
• galectin-3 between 17.8 and 25.9 ng/mL
• galectin-3 less than or equal to 17.8 ng/mL
For the clinical validation study, Cox regression models were used to evaluate
the association of baseline galectin-3 levels in 895 chronic HF patients with
the endpoints of: (i) composite of all-cause mortality and all-cause
hospitalization, (ii) cardiovascular mortality, (iii) composite of cardiovascular
mortality and heart failure-related hospitalization, and (iv) all-cause mortality.
Galectin-3 levels were found to be significantly associated with increased risk
of each of these endpoints in Cox regression models. Galectin-3 remained
significantly associated with increased risk upon adjustment for baseline risk
factors of age, gender, NYHA functional classification, left ventricular
ejection fraction, diabetes status, and smoking status. The following figures
and tables display Kaplan Meier curves for the composite endpoint of all-
cause mortality or all-cause hospitalization, by baseline galectin-3 category
and cumulative probabilities for events for the endpoints of the composite of
all-cause mortality and all-cause hospitalization, cardiovascular mortality, and
the composite of cardiovascular mortality and heart failure-related
hospitalization in the clinical validation study, by baseline galectin-3 category
at time points of 6, 12, 24 and 36 months after baseline.

4. Clinical cut-off:
To determine cutoff values for the BGM Galectin-3 assay in HF, galectin-3 levels
were measured in 582 banked EDTA-plasma samples from an independent,
controlled multi-center clinical study conducted in Europe enrolling NYHA class II,
III and IV subjects. The average age of patients was 71 years, and 38% were female.
The median follow-up time was greater than 18 months, and the primary end point
was the composite of all-cause mortality and hospitalization for HF. Two cutoff
values were derived that in turn defined three ordered galectin-3 categories.
The derived galectin-3-dependent risk categories are as follows:
• galectin-3 greater than 25.9 ng/mL
• galectin-3 between 17.8 and 25.9 ng/mL
• galectin-3 less than or equal to 17.8 ng/mL
Galectin-3 and natriuretic peptides are measures of separate and distinct
biological processes. Each marker provides independent and complementary
information on the prognosis of patients with chronic heart failure.
The following additional interpretive information is provided in the labeling
which provides information on the use of galectin-3 and NT-proBNP together.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Subjects included in the reference range study were drawn from a large ongoing
prospective observational study recruiting subjects without previous cardiac disease.
Galectin-3 levels were measured in 1,099 banked plasma samples (EDTA) from the
population of apparently healthy subjects without known heart disease but that
otherwise resemble, by age and gender distribution, the HF patient population.
Specimens were from women between the ages of 60 and 80 years (n=575) and men
between the ages of 55 and 80 (n=524). This reference population comprised
individuals of different ethnic background, as follows: Black or African-American
(n=307, 27.9%), Caucasian (n=691, 62.9%), Hispanic (n=42, 3.8%), Asian or Pacific
Islander (n=30, 2.7%), and not specified (n=29, 2.6%). All subjects had detectable
galectin-3 levels (min-max, 3.2 - 94.6 ng/mL) within the measuring range of BGM
Galectin-3 (1.4 to 94.8 ng/mL). The table below summarizes the galectin-3
th
distribution results. The 97.5 percentile of the galectin-3 distribution from this
reference population is 26.2 ng/mL. Samples with values above 26.2 ng/mL were in
the upper 2.5th percentile.
