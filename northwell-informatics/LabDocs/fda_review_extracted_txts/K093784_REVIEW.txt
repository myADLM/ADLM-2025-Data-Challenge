L. Test Principle:
The Zeus Scientific, Inc. AtheNA Multi-Lyte ToRCH IgG Plus test procedure
involves two incubation steps:
1. Patient sera are diluted and the diluted test sera are incubated in a vessel containing
a multiplexed mixture of the bead suspension. The multiplexed bead suspension
contains a mixture of distinguishable sets of polystyrene microspheres. Conjugated to
the primary sets of microspheres are Toxoplasma, Rubella, CMV and HSV 1 & 2
antigens. The bead mix also contains one bead set designed to detect non-specific
antibodies in the patient sample (if present) and four separate bead sets used for assay
calibration. If present in patient sera, the individual antibodies will bind to the

corresponding immobilized antigen bead set. The microspheres are rinsed to remove
non-reactive serum proteins.
2. Phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Fc specific) is added to the vessel
and the plate is incubated. The conjugate will react with IgG antibody immobilized on
the beads in step 1. The bead suspension is then analyzed by the AtheNA Multi-Lyte
instrument. The bead set(s) are sorted and the amount of reporter molecule (PE
conjugate) is determined for each bead set. Using the Intra-Well Calibration
Technology®, internal calibration bead sets are used to establish the assay’s cutoff.
Raw fluorescence from the distinct antigen bead is measured and compared against
the cut-off calibrator
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Assay precision and reproducibility was evaluated internally and at two
external clinical sites. The study was conducted as follows: Six samples were
identified and/or prepared (by Zeus Scientific, Inc.) for use in the study based
upon their activity on the AtheNA Multi-Lyte assay. Two samples was
selected that were clearly negative, two that were clearly positive and two
samples that were near the assay cut off. To assess reproducibility, on each
day of testing, each sample was diluted twice and each dilution was run in
triplicate. This resulted in six results per day. This was repeated for three days
at each site and the resulting data used to assess precision at each facility. The
studies are summarized in the table below:

The test is a qualitative assay and linearity data is not required. However, for
Rubella the lower range of the assay and the range around the cut-off (0 – 20
IU/ml) is quantitative. The company demonstrated the linearity for this assay
range using a titration of the World Health Organization (WHO) anti-Rubella
immunoglobulin, 1st International Standard, 1996.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The test is a qualitative assay. However, for Rubella the lower range of the
assay, the range around the cut-off (0 – 20 IU/ml) is traceable to the World
Health Organization (WHO) anti-Rubella immunoglobulin, 1st International
Standard, 1996. The percent recovery for the international standard is

were sero-positive to Measles, Mumps, Rubella, VZV, EBV VCA IgG,
EBNA-1, HSV-1, HSV-2, CMV, Syphilis, Toxoplasma and ANA and Rf IgM.
Micro-particle and ELISA immunoassay test systems manufactured for
commercial distribution were used to determine the sero-positivity of the
samples. Ten samples minimally for each possible cross-reactant were tested.
The results presented were obtained by testing the analytes against high
concentrations of possible cross reactants.

Interfering Substances
The effect of potential interfering substances on sample results generated
using the AtheNA Multi-Lyte test system was evaluated with the following
possible interfering substances based on the guidelines established in CLSI
EP7-A2 (39): albumin, bilirubin, cholesterol, hemoglobin, triglycerides and
intralipids.
The quantity of analyte in each interfering substance is as follows:
Bilirubin: 1mg/dL (low), 15 mg/dL (high)
Albumin: 3.5 g/dL (low), 5 g/dL (high)
Cholesterol: 150 mg/dL (low), 250 mg/dL (high)
Triglycerides: 150 mg/dL (low), 500 mg/dL (high)
Hemoglobin: 20 g/dL (low), 20 g/dL (high)

Intralipid: 300 mg/dL (low), 750 mg/dL (high)
Three samples each for Toxo, Rubella, CMV, HSV 1 and 2 IgG were chosen
based on their performance on the AtheNA Multi-Lyte test system: positive,
borderline and negative. The samples were diluted to concentrations around
the cut off, and tested with the possible interfering substances at the specified
high and low concentrations. All samples showed less than a 20% change in
signal with the exceptions presented in table 13. The use of samples which
contain elevated levels of bilirubin, albumin, cholesterol, triglycerides,
hemoglobin or intralipid should thus be avoided. The use of such samples may
interfere with the outcome of the sample’s result.

f. Assay cut-off:
A minimum of 25 samples were tested using the predicate ELISA test systems
and confirmed as negative and then tested with the investigational device.
Using the mean and standard deviations of this negative population for T.
gondii, Rubella, CMV, HSV1 and HSV2, theoretical cut-off was calculated.
Known positive samples, selected for their reactivity with the predicate
devices, were tested with the investigational device and checked to ascertain
that the results fell above the theoretical cut-off.

The cut-off values were verified using data obtained from clinical specimens
381 negative T. gondii samples, 22 negative Rubella samples, 212 negative
CMV samples, 176 negative HSV1 samples and 304 negative HSV2 samples
(the reactivity of the samples based upon results obtained from an alternate
FDA cleared test system approved for commercial distribution), the mean was
calculated and multiplied by the correction factor obtained in establishment of
the cut-off. The values obtained approximate the assay cut-off, thus verifying
that the method used to establish the cut-off for the AtheNA ToRCH IgG Plus
Test System is valid.

Comparative Testing: Prospective
Performance of the Athena Multi- Lyte ToRCH IgG system was evaluated
against commercially available assays for Toxoplasma, Rubella, CMV, HSV1
and HSV 2 assays using prospectively collected frozen remnant serum
samples from a total of 651 individuals for which ToRCH IgG panel or testing
for each of the individual analytes was ordered. Two outside investigators
tested 300 and 351 samples respectively. Results of this comparative study
are summarized in the table below.

Correlation with CDC Rubella Evaluation Serum Panel:
The performance of the AtheNA Multi-Lyte ToRCH IgG Plus test system was
assessed using masked, well characterized serum panel from the CDC. The
panels consist of:
1. 70% Toxo positive and 30% Toxo negative samples.
2. 80% Rubella positive and 20% Rubella negative samples.
3. 54% CMV positive and 46% CMV negative samples.
4. 24% HSV1 and HSV2 dual-positive samples, 50% HSV1 positive and
50% HSV1 negative samples and 48% HSV2 positive and 52% HSV2
negative samples.
The results are presented to convey further information on the performance of
the test kit and do not imply endorsement of the assay by the CDC. The results

CDC Rubella Low Positive Control Testing:
Rubella performance was assessed with the CDC low titer sample (21 IU/mL).
The sample was aliquoted, diluted in duplicate and tested by three technicians.
Percent recovery was calculated for both neat and diluted samples.

4. Clinical cut-off:
See section (1f).
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Observed prevalence was evaluated at three sites in a prospective study including
individuals and pregnant women undergoing ToRCH testing.
1. 651 masked samples prospectively collected from individuals between the
ages of <1 and 89 were tested at two external sites. 300 samples were submitted
for ToRCH antibody assessment. 351 samples were submitted for testing of one
or more of the anlytes in the ToRCH panel. Testing was performed on all five
markers on all samples. Results from a subset of 596/651 individuals between the
ages of 17 and 69 were used to calculate HSV 1 and HSV 2 prevalence. Site 1, a
hospital laboratory located in the Mid-Atlantic region tested 300 samples. Site 2, a
hospital laboratory in the Northeast tested 351 samples.
2. 200 masked samples prospectively collected from pregnant women for
