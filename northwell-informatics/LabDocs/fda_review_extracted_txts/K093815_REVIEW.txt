4. Special instrument requirements:
The instrument used is a general laboratory use instrument. The instrument
required for this device is a fluorescence microscope with 100 watt mercury or
halogen lamp, appropriate filter combination for FITC (excitation peak at 490 nm,
emission peak at 520nm); and 100X, 200X, and 400X (optional) magnification
(dry objective).
I. Device Description:
Light Diagnostics™ hMPV Direct Immunofluorescence Assay is a qualitative test
that uses a specific typing reagent and FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) filter
fluorescence microscope to detect and identify human metapneumovirus (hMPV) in
direct specimens from symptomatic patients with respiratory illness.
The kit consists of one vial hMPV Reagent, two hMPV Control Slides, a Phosphate-
Buffered Saline Packet, a Tween 20/Sodium Azide Solution (100X) vial, and a
Mounting Fluid vial. The kit utilizes a specific reagent for the detection and
identification of hMPV. One specimen cell spot on a slide is necessary to perform the
test. Unbound reagent is removed by rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
Illumination allows visualization of the antigen-antibody complexes by fluorescence
microscopy. hMPV-infected cells will exhibit apple-green fluorescence with the
specific reagent while cells stain a dull red due to the presence of Evans blue in the
reagents. The controls contained in this kit are acetone fixed slides, each with one
well hMPV, subtype A infected cells, one well with hMPV, subtype B infected cells,
and two wells of uninfected cells to verify functioning of reagents, methodology and
functioning of the microscope.
Materials Provided
1. hMPV Reagent - (Catalog No. 5091) One 2 mL dropper vial containing FITC-
labeled anti-hMPV monoclonal antibodies , protein stabilizer, Evans blue and
0.1% sodium azide as preservative.
2. hMPV Control Slides - (Catalog No. 5092). Two control slides containing two
hMPV (A and B) infected (positive) wells and two non-infected (negative) wells.
3. Phosphate Buffered Saline - (Catalog No. 5087) phosphate buffered saline salts.
4. Tween 20 / Sodium Azide Solution (100X) - (Catalog No. 5037). One 10 mL vial

Overview of the procedure:
PBS resuspended cells, derived from a clinical specimen, are placed onto a glass slide
and allowed to air dry completely. The cells are fixed in acetone for 10 minutes. After
they have been allowed to air dry, one drop of the hMPV Reagent is added to cover
the cells which are then incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes in a humidified chamber.
The stained cells are then washed with the diluted PBS/Tween 20 for 10-15 seconds
and rinsed. A drop of the Mounting Fluid is added and a cover slip is placed on the
slide. The cells are examined using a fluorescence microscope. The hMPV infected
cells will exhibit an apple-green fluorescence. Uninfected cells will stain a dull red
due to the presence of Evans blue in the reagent.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
During the study no FDA cleared predicate device was available. The
performance characteristics of the Light Diagnostics™ Human Metapneumovirus
DFA Assay were established by direct evaluation of clinical specimens compared
to a composite algorithm based on cell culture results and a validated RT-PCR
method followed by bidirectional sequencing for confirmation and identification
of human metapneumovirus.

--- Page 4 ---
The methods differ in that: Light Diagnostics™ Human Metapneumovirus DFA
Assay contains a single reagent which contains FITC-labeled monoclonal
antibodies directed against hMPV. This reagent detects hMPV antigens present in
the patient specimen. Slides are necessary to detect and identify the virus from
sample and yield an apple-green fluorescence color if positive. The RT-
PCR/sequencing method detects viral RNA isolated from patient specimens.
A more recently FDA cleared similar device could now serve as main predicate:
D3 DFA Metapneumovirus Identification Kit (DHI, k090073). Characteristics of
the Light Diagnostics™ Human Metapneumovirus DFA Assay are compared to
those of such predicate device in the Table below:

L. Test Principle:
Light Diagnostics Human Metapneumovirus DFA Assay utilizes a single reagent for
the detection and identification of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) in cell
preparations made from respiratory specimens. A blend of two monoclonal
antibodies, specific for hMPV is labeled with FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate)
which fluoresces apple-green. The labeled antibody will bind to viral antigen present
in the specimen in hMPV infected cells. Unbound reagent is removed by washing
with buffer. Cells in positive specimens will fluoresce apple-green while uninfected
cells will stain dull red due to the presence of Evans blue in the reagent.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Assay precision and reproducibility studies were performed at three sites (two
external and one internal site). The internal precision study was conducted
using the protocol recommended in CLSI EP15-A2, with the exceptions that
two replicate samples of each subtype were run each day, and two runs were
analyzed each day. The specific protocol was to analyze two runs per day with
two replicate samples for each of two subtypes daily for five days. All other
procedures in CLSI EP15-A2, section 8.2, were followed. In addition, the
protocol was run in duplicate by two operators (i.e., each operator analyzed
two runs per day for five days).
Because the statistical methods in CLSI EP15-A2 refer to quantitative tests
and the Light Diagnostics™ Human Metapneumovirus DFA Assay yields
qualitative results, precision study results were analyzed for accordance with
expected results. Results were 100% in accordance with expected results
(80/80 tests). There were no invalid or equivocal results.
The reproducibility study was conducted at three clinical sites (the internal
site plus the external Sites 1 and 2 from the clinical study). Each site evaluated
the Light Diagnostics™ hMPV DFA Reagent using a five day testing protocol
with two runs per day and three replicates of each panel member per test, and
two operators performing the test each day. At Site 1, each operator performed
one run per day; at Site 2, each operator performed two runs per day. The test
panel consisted of one true negative sample and samples at three levels of
viral load including a high negative (sample with an analyte concentration

--- Page 6 ---
below the LoD such that repeat testing of this sample should be negative at
least 95% of the time), a low positive sample, and a moderate positive sample.
Results were in accordance with expected results greater than 99% of the time
(438/440 tests). Precision/reproducibility results are summarized in the
following table:

Overall 438/440 99%
Quality Control:
Control slides should be stained each time the staining procedure is performed
to ensure proper test performance. The control slides supplied in the kit are
intended to demonstrate the proper function of kit components and
immunofluorescence staining procedure. The controls included in the kit are
acetone fixed slides with human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infected and
uninfected cells. Each control slide has four wells. The positive control wells
are fixed with hMPV reference strain in the two wells, one with hMPV
subtype A, one with hMPV subtype B. The negative control is fixed with
uninfected cells in two wells. Control slides should be tested with each sample
batch. The control slides supplied in the kit are intended to demonstrate the
proper function of reagents, culture methodology and functionality of the
microscope. The control slides are for one time use only and are not subjected
to open and close stability study. Control slides prepared from other reference
hMPV infected and uninfected cells may also be used to ensure proper
staining procedures during analysis. When viewed in a fluorescence
microscope an hMPV positive reaction is indicated by a bright apple-green
fluorescence in the nucleus and/or cytoplasm of the infected cells in the
appropriate well. Uninfected cells in the negative control well will exhibit dull
red fluorescence. Results for patient samples should not be reported until
controls perform as expected.

Stability:
Reagents: store at 2-8 °C up to the stated expiration date. Shelf life
recommendations based on the accelerated stability study performed
during development of the kit; with a real time stability study follow-up.
Control slides: at 2-8 °C; one time use only and are not subjected to open
and close stability study. Expiration date based on shortest dated kit
component (antibody reagent in the kit).
Samples: Specimens should not be frozen before testing. They may be
maintained at 2-8 °C for up to 72 hours without loss of viability, as per the
general protocols for clinical specimen collection and handling, such as
those outlined in CLSI M41-A: "Viral Culture; Approved Guideline."
d. Analytical Sensitivity (Detection limits):
Analytical detection limits for the Light Diagnostics™ hMPV DFA Reagent
was tested using slides made from titrated virus culture. Four strains of hMPV
were used, representing all four known subtypes of hMPV (A1, A2, B1, and
B2). Five ten-fold dilutions were made from stocks of known concentration
for each strain. Samples of virus at each dilution were dropped on slides in
duplicate, and four batches of slides were prepared from four cultures (eight
replicates at each concentration). Positive results were obtained with at least
95% of replicates using the Light Diagnostics™ hMPV DFA Reagent on
hMPV A1 infected cells down to 400 PFU/mL, 100 PFU/mL of hMPV A2
infected cells, 625 PFU/mL of hMPV B1 infected cells, and 275 PFU/mL of
hMPV B2 infected cells. Results are summarized in the following table.
Virus strain Limit of Detection
hMPV A1 4.0 x 102PFU/mL
hMPV A2 1.0 x 102PFU/mL
hMPV B1 6.25 x 102PFU/mL
hMPV B2 2.75 x 102PFU/mL
e. Analytical Reactivity:
In addition to the Analytical Sensitivity results, a study was performed to
demonstrate that the Light Diagnostics™ hMPV DFA Reagent detects virus
isolates representing each of the four known genetic sublineages of hMPV
(A1, A2, B1, B2). Positive specimens from the clinical study were genotyped
to further support this study. The Light Diagnostics™ hMPV DFA Reagent
detected hMPV in 21 clinical isolates from sublineage A2, 10 from sublineage
B1, and 32 from sublineage B2 (including positive specimens from Site 3). No
specimens from the A1 sublineage were received in the clinical study.
f. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity:
A study was performed to determine reactivity when staining slides with the
Light Diagnostics™ hMPV DFA Reagent were tested against a variety of

[Table 1 on page 7]
Virus strain	Limit of Detection
hMPV A1	4.0 x 102PFU/mL

viruses and bacteria found in the respiratory tract, and cell lines commonly
used to isolate respiratory viruses. Bacteria were grown and colonies
containing 106CFU/mL were dried onto slides. Viruses stocks with
concentrations in the order of 105PFU/mL were dropped on slides and fixed
with acetone. Cross reactivity was defined as any positive (apple-green
fluorescence) reaction in cells other than human metapneumovirus infected
cells.
Study procedure:
1. Slides were brought to room temperature
2. Slides were stained with the Light Diagnostics™ hMPV DFA Reagent. In
addition, each slide was either stained with positive control reagent, or crystal
violet (when no positive control reagent was available).
3. Slides were incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C.
4. Slides were rinsed with PBS, mounted and read at 200X magnification with
a fluorescent microscope.
The results in the table below show that there is no cross-reactivity between
the hMPV Reagent when tested with viruses, bacteria, or cell lines.

Protein A, produced by certain bacteria, will bind to the Fc portion of the
monoclonal antibodies used in the hMPV Reagent. Staining, however, can be
differentiated by size and morphology. The presence of Staphylococcus
Aureus and protein A will result in small (0.8μm) fluorescent spheres.
Interference:
A study was performed to determine potentially interfering substances with
the Light Diagnostics™ hMPV DFA Reagent. Substances considered were
those that could potentially be present in nasopharyngeal swab specimens.
Substances were added to negative samples (uninfected cultured cells), hMPV
A infected cells, and hMPV B infected cells. Interference was defined as any
negative results on hMPV infected cells in the presence of an interfering
substance. The results in the table below show that there is no interference

g. Assay cut-off:
The Light Diagnostics™ Human Metapneumovirus DFA Assay is a
qualitative test. The results are either positive or negative. Positive staining for
hMPV is indicated by the presence of two (2) or more intact cells exhibiting
specific fluorescence (bright apple green). A presumptive negative result is
indicated by the absence of fluorescence in a minimum sampling of 20
epithelial cells. All presumptive negative results should be reported as “No
virus observed” and should be confirmed using an FDA cleared hMPV
molecular assay. A sample containing fewer than 20 epithelial cells is
considered inadequate, and the test is thus invalid. A new specimen should be
obtained and tested. These cut-offs (minimum 2 positive cells for positive;
minimum 20 epithelial cells for adequate sampling) represent consensus of
general virological techniques common in the laboratories used for clinical
studies.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
At the time of the clinical studies, no FDA cleared predicate device was
available to serve as comparator method to establish test performance. In
order to establish performance characteristics, Millipore Corporation
determined a composite algorithm to compare the Light Diagnostics™ Human
Metapneumovirus DFA Assay results with.
The composite algorithm consisted of viral culture results and a validated end-
point RT-PCR method followed by bidirectional sequencing for confirmation
and identification of human metapneumovirus. Within the composite
algorithm, any sample that tested positive by viral culture, or had bidirectional
sequencing data meeting predefined quality acceptance criteria that matched
hMPV sequences deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) GenBank database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), with

acceptable E-values1, was considered a “true” hMPV positive. “True” hMPV
negatives were any sample that tested negative by both viral culture and the
RT-PCR assay.
The RT-PCR assay was standardized at St. Joseph Healthcare, Hamilton,
Canada following internal validation and characterization through reactivity
and analytical sensitivity studies. RNA was isolated using the EasyMag
(bioMerieux) instrument as per manufacturer’s instructions. Gel
electrophoresis was used to purify positive RT-PCR amplified specimens,
using the QIAquick purification kit (Qiagen), prior to performing bidirectional
sequencing with the ABI 3700 at McMaster University Sequencing Core
Facility.

1 The E-values generated from the clinical trials range from a low of 2e-60 to
a high of 2e-30. The E-Value from NCBI BLAST Alignment indicates the
statistical significance of a given pair-wise alignment and reflects the size of
the database and the scoring system used. The lower the E-Value, the more
significant the hit. A sequence alignment that has an E-Value of 1e-3 means
that this similarity has a 1 in 1000 chance of occurring by chance alone.
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=handbook.section.614).
Therefore an E-Value ranging from 2e-30 to 2e-60 has a very low probability
of occurring purely by chance.

Validation of the RT-PCR/sequencing method:
1. Analytical Sensitivity (LoD): The Reference RT-PCR Assay for hMPV
was tested with each of two strains of hMPV: A (A2 subtype), and B (B1
subtype). Control strains of virus with known starting concentration
diluted 10-fold from 10-1 to 10-8 were tested using the same protocol and
conditions used in the clinical study. Replicates of five were extracted and
tested at each dilution for each virus strain. The limit of detection was
defined at the concentration at which >95% of replicates were positive.
For the A2 strain, all replicates were positive at the 10-3 dilution. Four of
five were positive at 10-4 dilution (80%), and none were positive at 10-5
dilution. The limit was then defined as the 10-3 dilution of the stock of
1.58 x 104 TCID50/mL. For the B1 strain, all replicates were positive at
the 10-2 and 10-3 dilution. None were positive at 10-4 dilution. The limit
was then defined as the 10-3 dilution of the stock of 1.58 x 103
TCID50/mL. Following the initial five replicate testing, 30 additional
samples at the limit of detection were extracted and tested. For both
strains, 30/30 replicates at the limit of detection were positive. Results are
summarized below:
Virus strain Limit of Detection
hMPV A2 15.8 TCID /mL
50
hMPV B1 1.58 TCID /mL
50
2. Reactivity: The Reference RT-PCR Assay for hMPV was tested with
each of four known subtypes of hMPV: A1, A2, B1, B2. Control strains of
virus with known subtypes were tested using the same protocol and
conditions used in the clinical study. Positive results were obtained with
each subtype, and the resultant PCR products were bidirectionally
sequenced. The results of BLAST alignments for each of the sequences
from the PCR products show correct GenBank match, with high coverage
score, high maximum identity % and significant E values (~e-40 to e-50).
Based on these analytical validations, the hMPV RT-PCR assay is an
acceptable method to be used as a part of the composite reference
algorithm in determining “clinical diagnostic truth” for the Light
Diagnostics™ Human Metapneumovirus DFA Assay Clinical Trial.

Sensitivity and specificity relative to a consensus comparator algorithm was

The clinical study was done using prospective specimens. Specimens used in
the study were freshly collected from leftover specimens. Accurate detection
of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is dependent upon sample collection,
transport, and storage. The Manual of Clinical Microbiology, Murray, P. et al.,
eds. 8th ed. (2003) was referenced in this clinical study as guideline for proper
specimen collection. The following protocol was used for specimen
collection: Specimen swabs should be placed in viral transport medium. All
specimens should be transported on wet ice or cold pack to the testing
laboratory immediately after collection. Specimens should not be frozen
before testing. They may be maintained at 2-8°C for up to 72 hours without
loss of viability.
Studies were done at three clinical sites (two US, one Canada), all performed
between February and July, 2007. A total of four hundred eleven (411) NPS
specimens from patients from three sites were used for evaluation in this
study. One specimen was obtained per patient and 2 measurements were taken
from each qualified specimen. Measurements were taken using the new device
on direct specimens and the second measurement was taken using the
culture/RT-PCR/sequencing composite algorithm method.
Site 1:
Two hundred fifteen (215) specimens (all nasopharyngeal swabs, NPS) from
patients were collected from a hospital laboratory in the southeast of Canada
(St. Joseph’s Healthcare Hamilton, Site 1). From the 215, 7 specimens were
excluded due to insufficient number of cells available or lack of comparator
data available, leaving a total of 208 NPS specimens tested from Site 1.
hMPV was identified by RT-PCR in 20 specimens of the 208 tested for an
overall prevalence of 9.6%. Half of the patients from whom hMPV was
identified were under the age of 5 years. In addition, 7 of 20 (35%) patients
positive for hMPV were older than 60 years of age. The relative prevalence
for Site 1 of hMPV is indicated in the following tables:

Site 2:
Two hundred and two (202), including 200 NPS, and 2 broncheoalveolar
lavage (BAL), specimens from patients were collected from a clinical
diagnostic testing facility in the northeast United States (Yale University,
School of Medicine, Site 2). From these 202, one NPS specimen was excluded
for insufficient number of cells, and the 2 BALs for not being sufficient to
establish claim for this sample type, leaving a total of 199 NPS samples tested
at site 2.
hMPV was identified by RT-PCR in 43 specimens of 199 tested, for an
overall prevalence of 21.6%. All specimens included were nasopharyngeal
swabs. Forty-one (41) of the 43 (95%) patients positive for hMPV were under
the age of 5 years. The relative prevalence for Site 1 of hMPV is indicated in
the following tables:

Site 3:
Two hundred (200) specimens, including 149 nasopharyngeal wash (NPW), 4
NPS, 35 BAL, and 12 tracheal aspirates (TA) specimens were collected at a
facility in the Midwest United States (University of Iowa, Site 3). From the
200, only the 4 NPS were retained for this study, since the other sample types
did not have enough representation through the three clinical sites to establish
appropriate performance.

The 4 samples from Site 3 were all hMPV negative. The small size limits any
remarkable outcome on these specimens.
Independent performance of the Light Diagnostics™ Human

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Four hundred and seven (411) specimens were tested at 3 sites (Southeast portion
of Canada, Northeastern United States, Midwest United States) between February,
2007 and July 2007. In Southeastern Canada, hMPV was identified by the Light
Diagnostics™ Human Metapneumovirus DFA Assay in 18 specimens for a
prevalence of 8.6%. Half of the patients from whom hMPV was identified were
under the age of 5 years. In addition, 6 of 18 (33%) patients positive for hMPV
were older than 60 years of age. In the Northeastern United States, hMPV was
identified in 42 specimens (prevalence 21.1%). At this site, 40 of the 42 (95%)
patients positive for hMPV were under the age of 5 years. All samples from the
Midwest US were hMPV negative.
