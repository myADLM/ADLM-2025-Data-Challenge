4. Special instrument requirements:
The Sensititre Autoinoculator, The Sensititre AutoReader and the Sensititre

I. Device Description:
The Sensititre HP MIC Susceptibility plate is an in vitro diagnostic product for
clinical susceptibility testing of fastidious isolates.
The Sensititre 18-24 hours MIC or breakpoint Susceptibility System is an in vitro
diagnostic product for clinical susceptibility testing of non fastidious isolates. It
consists of a disposable plate containing dilutions of antimicrobials dried in
individual wells. The test plate is inoculated with a standardized suspension of the
organism to be tested. After the indicated hours of incubation, the plate is read for
growth to determine the MIC either on an AutoReader or manually using the
Sensititre manual viewer or SensiTouch.
A report is then generated that contains the MIC value and the interpretive category
result (S,I,R) for each antibiotic contained on the card.
The MIC interpretive criteria for Telavancin are as follows:
Susceptibility Interpretive Criteria
(MIC* in µg/mL):
Organism S I R
Staphylococcus aureus ≤ 1 - -
Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin- ≤ 1 - -
susceptible isolates only)
Streptococcus pyogenes
Streptococcus agalactiae ≤ 0.12 - -
Streptococcus anginosus group
*Currently there are no intermediate or resistant interpretive criteria for telavancin. The absence of
resistant strains precludes defining any results categories other than "susceptible." For strains yielding
results suggestive of a "non-susceptible" category, organism identification and antimicrobial
susceptibility test results should be confirmed. Subsequently, the isolates should be saved and
submitted to a reference laboratory that will confirm results using a reference dilution method.
S = Susceptible: Attainable levels in blood or tissue on usual usage, including oral administration when
applicable.
I = Intermediate: The intermediate category implies clinical efficacy in body sites where the drugs are
physiologically concentrated (e.g. quinolones and B-lactams in urine), or when a higher than normal
dosage of drug can be used (e.g. B-lactams). The “intermediate” category also includes a “buffer zone”
which should prevent small, uncontrolled, technical factors from causing major discrepancies in
interpretations, especially for drugs with narrow pharmacotoxicity margins.
R = Resistant to usually achievable systemic concentrations.

2. Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria that Grow
Aerobically, Approved Standard -8th Edition, Document M7-A8
3. Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing – 19th
Informational Supplement, M100-S19.
L. Test Principle:
Sensititre susceptibility plates are multi-well plastic microtiter plates that contain
doubling dilutions of antibacterial agents. Each plate is dosed with antimicrobial
agents at appropriate dilutions. Results can be read manually by visual reading of
growth or automatically on an Autoreader using fluorescence. The Sensititre
Autoreader system utilizes fluorescence technology which involves the detection of
bacterial growth by monitoring the activity of specific surface enzymes produced by
the test organism. Growth is determined by generating a fluorescent product from a
non-fluorescent (f1uorogenic) substrate. The substrate can be added to the inoculum
broth and dispensed into the test plates at the same time as the test organism or the
plates can be prepared with the substrate already added to the plate. The non-
fluorescent substrate is prepared by conjugating a fluorescent compound to the
specific enzyme substrates with a bond, which prevents fluorescence (i.e. the
f1uorophore is quenched in this state). Enzymatic action of the bacterial surface
enzymes on the specific substrates cleaves this bond releasing the fluorophore which
is now capable of fluorescence. The amount of fluorescence detected is directly
related to the activity of the bacterial surface enzymes and, therefore, to bacterial
growth.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three study sites. Twenty five Gram
positive isolates (9 S. aureus, 5 E. faecalis, 1 E. faecium, 5 group A
Streptococci, and 5 coagulase negative staphylococci) and 25 Streptococcus
sp. (10 S. pneumoniae, 5 S. viridans, 6 group A Streptococci, and 4 group B
Streptococci) were tested at each site. These were tested one time at each of the
three sites using both reading methods.
Results were read on the AutoReader and manually using the SensiTouch.
Reference method plates were read visually in accordance with CLSI M-7
standard. Reproducibility was calculated as the percent of results for the
combined sites which were within +/- one doubling dilution of the mode MIC
value for all sites.
5

--- Page 6 ---
For the sake of reproducibility calculations, off-scale values are handled in two
ways; “best case” and “worst case” scenarios. Best case calculation for
reproducibility assumes the off-scale result is within one well from the mode MIC
value. Worst case calculation for reproducibility assuming the off-scale result is
greater than one well from the mode MIC value. There were no off-scale results
in this study. So, only one value for overall reproducibility is reported for each
reading method.
For manual read by the SensiTouch, the overall reproducibility was 100% for
Gram positive organism and 97% for Streptococcus sp.
For the AutoReader, the overall reproducibility was 100% for Gram positive
organism and 99% for Streptococcus sp.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The FDA and CLSI recommended QC isolates were tested on every test
occasion with the reference method and the. The reference method QC results
were in range for every day tested. The Sensititre Susceptibility plate was
tested a sufficient number of times to demonstrate that the system can produce
QC results in the recommended range.
Quality Control was performed at all sites during the studies using both the
AutoReader and the manual reading method (SensiTouch). The mode of the
MIC obtained by the Sensititre manual read was similar to that obtained by
the AutoReader. Results obtained by Sensititre for S. aureus and E. faecalis
trended towards the low end of the acceptable MIC range and were generally
one dilution lower than was obtained with the reference method. Summary of
the results are shown in the table below.

At least one Quality control organism was in control in the reference on all days.
Quality Control results for the Sensititre Susceptibility System using either
reading methods demonstrated that the system could produce the expected quality
control results.
Inoculum density control for QC organisms ranged between a minimum of 1.0 X
105 CFU/mL and a maximum of 5.5X 105 CFU/mL. These colony count values
were the result of 33 density evaluation tests with S. aureus, 30 tests with E.
faecalis and five tests with S. pneumoniae. All were in the expected range.
If the non-fastidious Sensititre plate is utilized for testing it does not require lysed
horse blood in its testing. Therefore, S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 can not be used
as the QC organism for the Streptococcus spp. The recommended QC organism
for this non-fastidious Sensititre plate is S. aureus ATCC 29213.

susceptibility plates containing telavancin to test susceptibility of
Streptococcus spp. (Sensititre Streptococcus spp. HP MIC panel) and gram
positive isolates (Sensititre 18-24 hour susceptibility plate). The CLSI
microdilution reference methods containing the same antimicrobial in the
same dilutions were used for a comparison and evaluation of performance.
The inoculum was prepared using a Nephelometer which was calibrated at the
start of each test. Plates were inoculated and incubated at 34-36o C (in CO
2
incubator for S. pneumoniae). The reading was done on the AutoReader and
manually using the SensiTouch at 20-24 hours.
Clinical testing was performed on 666 Gram positive isolates (263
Staphylococcus spp., 70 Enterococcus spp. and 333 Streptococcus spp.). All were
freshly collected clinical isolates. In addition, testing was performed on 59 Gram
positive CDC stock challenge isolates and 61 Streptococcus spp. CDC stock
challenge isolates.
The growth rate for the manual and automated read methods was greater than
90%. The performance evaluations are shown in the table below.

Essential agreement (EA) is when the Sensititre panels agree with the reference test panel
results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference method. Category
agreement (CA) is when the Sensititre panel result interpretation agrees exactly with the
reference panel result interpretation. Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for
both the Sensititre and the reference and have on-scale EA.
The EA% is acceptable when compared to the reference method as described in the FDA
guidance document, “Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial
Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”.
Auto-read results were very similar to the manual readings. Currently, there are no
intermediate or resistance interpretive criteria for telavancin. No isolates in this study were
noted to have MICs outside the susceptible category. Therefore, there were no minor, major
or very major errors. As summarized in the table below, the combined (clinical + challenge)
EA and CA for all organisms were greater than 90%.

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not Applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
≤ 1 µg/mL (S) for Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis
(vancomycin-susceptible isolates only)
≤ 0.12 µg/mL (S) for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and
Streptococcus anginosus group
Currently, there are no intermediate (I) or resistance (R) interpretive criteria for
telavancin.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The expected value range, interpretive criteria and QC are included in the package insert.
The labeling is sufficient and satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
