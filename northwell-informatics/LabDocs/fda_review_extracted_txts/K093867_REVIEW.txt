2. Indication(s) for use
DAT Oral Fluid Opiates (OFOPI) is an in vitro diagnostic test for the
qualitative and semiquantitative detection of opiates in human oral fluid at a
cutoff concentration of 30 ng/mL in neat oral fluid. The specimen must be
collected exclusively with the Intercept® Oral Specimen Collection Device.
Semiquantitative test results may be obtained that permit laboratories to assess
assay performance as part of a quality control program and to estimate a
dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as
LC/MS/MS.
DAT Oral Fluid Opiates provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A
more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a
confirmed analytical result. Chromatography/mass spectrometry is the
preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional
judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when
preliminary positive results are used.
The Oral Fluid DAT Control Set A is for use as assayed controls with the
DAT Oral Fluid assays on automated clinical chemistry analyzers for human
oral fluid samples collected with the Intercept Oral Specimen Collection
Device.
The Oral Fluid DAT Qual Cal calibrators are designed for the calibration of
oral fluid assays for drugs of abuse on automated clinical chemistry analyzers
for human oral fluid samples collected with the Intercept Oral Specimen
Collection Device.

L. Test Principle:
The assay is based on the kinetic interaction of microparticles in a solution (KIMS) as
measured by changes in light transmission. In the absence of sample drug, soluble
drug conjugates bind to antibody-bound microparticles, causing the formation of
particle aggregates. As the aggregation reaction proceeds in the absence of sample
drug, the absorbance increases. When an oral fluid sample contains the drug in
question, this drug competes with the drug derivative conjugate for microparticle-
bound antibody. Antibody bound to sample drug is no longer available to promote
particle aggregation, and subsequent particle lattice formation is inhibited. The
presence of sample drug diminishes the increasing absorbance in proportion to the
concentration of drug in the sample.
The Intercept® Oral Specimen Collection Device contains a preservative buffer that
dilutes the neat oral fluid sample. The calibrator and control levels are set at diluted
levels so that sample absorbance values can be compared directly to the absorbance
values of the calibration curve. The assay result is reported as a positive or negative
result relative to the neat oral fluid cutoff of 30 ng/mL.
NOTE: To correlate a semi-quantitative result from the assay or the associated
LC/MS/MS confirmation result to a neat oral fluid value, the result from the assay or
the associated LC/MS/MS confirmation test should be multiplied by a factor of 3.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All analytical performance data was collected on human oral fluid samples
collected with the Intercept Oral Specimen Collection Device and analyzed on
the Roche MODULAR P analyzer. The Intercept collection device includes a
diluent that results in a dilution of approximately 1/3. The assay cannot be
used to measure undiluted (neat) samples. Analyte concentrations refer to the
neat oral fluid concentration, unless otherwise noted.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Two studies were performed with the assay to evaluate precision.
In the first study, a morphine solution was added to each of 9
samples which were obtained from a human oral fluid pool of
samples collected with the Intercept® Oral Specimen Collection
Device. The resulting concentrations were approximately -100 %, -

--- Page 6 ---
Page 6 of 18
75 %, -50 %, -25 %, 0 %, +25 %, +50 %, +75 %, and +100 % of the
cutoff calibrator value. The samples were tested in qualitative and
semiquantitative modes. Following a CLSI (EP5-A2) precision
protocol, samples were tested in 2 replicates per run, 2 runs per day
for 21 days, total n = 84. One lot each of reagent, calibrator, and
control were used and there were 19 calibrations performed during
the study.
Qualitative Mode
Note: this study was performed on samples already collected with
the Intercept collection device. Therefore the data in the table below
do not reflect any imprecision inherent in the collection process
itself. Results were as follows:

In the second study, a morphine solution was added to neat human
oral fluid sample pools at concentrations of 15, 22.5, 37.5, and 45
ng/mL. Each sample was then processed through each of 21 of the
Intercept® Oral Specimen Collection Devices to achieve final
concentrations at approximately -50 %, -25 %, +25 %, and +50 % of
the cutoff calibrator value. The intra-assay precision of the samples,
including the processing of the samples through the collection
device, was then tested in qualitative and semiquantitative modes
with the Oral Fluid Opiates assay.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To assess linearity, aliquots of a neat OF pool were spiked with
morphine at concentrations of 0, 15, 22.5, 30, 37.5, 45, 60, 120, and
240 ng/mL. Each level was processed through 2 separate Intercept
collection devices. The diluted sample from both Intercept devices
was then analyzed once in semi-quantitative mode. The data below
was analyzed with one calibration using one lot of reagent.
Results were as follows:
Spiked Neat
Recovery (%)

0 n/a
15 92.6
22.5 96.9
30 (cutoff) 98.0
37.5 95.0
45 101.5
60 100.0
120 97.1
240 101.6
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
The assay is calibrated against morphine.
Calibrators and control materials are specified in the labeling but are
supplied separately from the reagents. For the qualitative assay, only
CAL 2 (10 ng/mL) is required. For the semi-quantitative assay, six
levels of calibrator material, ranging in concentration from 0 to 80
ng/mL are required. Calibrators and controls consist of a synthetic
oral fluid matrix spiked with known concentrations of morphine.

The concentration of morphine in the calibrators and controls is
verified by LC/MS/MS.
The open vial stability claim for calibrators and controls is 20 days
after opening when stored at 2–8° C. The closed vial stability claim
for calibrators and controls is one year from the time of manufacture
when stored at 2–8° C.
The sponsor’s stability protocols were reviewed and found to be
acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
Performance at low drug concentrations in the semi-quantitative
assay was characterized by determination of recovery (see section b
above).
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed analytical specificity studies on four
categories of potential interferents: structurally related substances,
structurally unrelated substances, substances endogenous to oral
fluid, and food and dental substances.
Cross Reactivity to Structurally Related Compounds
Cross-reactivity was evaluated by spiking various concentrations of
similarly structured drug compounds into a drug-free oral fluid pool
collected with the Intercept Oral Fluid Specimen Collection Device.
By analyzing various concentration of each compound the sponsor
determined the concentration of the drug that produced a response
approximately equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the assay.

Interference from Structurally Unrelated Compounds
Potential interference from structurally unrelated compounds was
tested in both semi-quantitative and qualitative mode by spiking the
potentially interfering compound into pools of human oral fluid
collected with the Intercept Oral Fluid Specimen Collection Device.
Both a positive concentration (+50% of the cutoff) and a negative
concentration (-50% of the cutoff) of morphine were evaluated. All
were tested at a concentration of 10,000 ng/mL with the following
exceptions:
Trifluroperazine – tested at 3,000 ng/mL

No negative or positive interference was seen in this study.
Interference from Endogenous Interferents and pH
Potential interference from substances endogenous to oral fluid were
tested in both semi-quantitative and qualitative mode by spiking the
potentially interfering substance into pools of human oral fluid
collected with the Intercept Oral Fluid Specimen Collection Device.
Both a positive concentration (+50% of the cutoff) and a negative
concentration (-50% of the cutoff) of morphine were evaluated.
The following potential endogenous interferents were spiked into the
negative and positive oral fluid samples at the noted concentrations.
No negative or positive interference was seen in this study and all
negative and positive controls recovered properly in the presence of
the interfering substance in both qualitative and semi-quantitative
modes.

An additional study was performed in which samples containing
morphine at +50% and -50% of the cutoff with pH ranging from 2.0
to 8.5 were tested. All of the samples above the cutoff read positive
and all of the samples below the cutoff read negative.

The following potential interferents were evaluated by spiking into
oral fluid samples collected with the intercept device: alcohol
(ethanol), antiseptic mouthwash, baking soda, cough syrup, whole
blood, cranberry juice, hemoglobin, hydrogen peroxide, sodium
chloride, sugar, toothpaste, and water. None of these substances
caused positive or negative interference.
The effect of potential food and other oral cavity contaminants
(alcohol, antacid, baking soda, chewing tobacco, cigarettes, cola,
cough syrup, cranberry juice, gum, hard candy, milk, orange juice,
salt, sugar, toothpaste, water, and tooth whitening strips) were also
examined. No interference was observed in samples collected at
least 10 minutes after the use of the above substances.
There is the possibility that other substances and/or factors not listed
above may interfere with the test and cause false results, e.g.,
technical or procedural errors.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the
claimed cutoff concentration appears in the precision above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Two method comparison studies were performed. In the first study,
20 positive and 20 negative samples were analyzed. In order to
evaluate the performance of the entire system, three measurements
were taken on each specimen: the LC/MS/MS concentration of the
neat sample, the LC/MS/MS concentration of the diluted Intercept
sample, and the immunoassay concentration of the diluted Intercept
sample.

The LC/MS/MS values of the neat and diluted samples confirmed
the dilution ratio of approximately 1/3. When the LC/MS/MS values
of the neat oral fluid samples were compared to the immunoassay

values, the following results were obtained. Note: The values
obtained in this study were collected from samples containing
opiates prior to the collection step. Therefore the results reflect the
performance of the entire system including the collection step.

In the second study, 40 negative and 40 positive samples were
analyzed. These included four near cutoff negative samples and four
near cutoff positive samples.
Note: this study was performed on samples already collected with
the Intercept collection device. When the LC/MS/MS values of the
diluted samples were compared to the immunoassay values, the
following results were obtained. Therefore the results below do not
reflect any inaccuracy inherent in the collection process itself.
