L. Test Principle:
The Mission Saliva Alcohol Test Strip is a firm plastic strip with a reagent pad
attached at the tip that contains tetramethylbenzidine, alcohol oxidase, and
peroxidase. The test is based on two coupled enzymatic reactions. In the first
reaction step ethanol in the sample is oxidized to aldehyde by alcohol oxidase. The
second step uses the enzyme peroxidase to catalyze the oxidation of TMB, a color
indicator substrate. The color change corresponds to the amount of alcohol present.
The results are read by comparing the color of the test with the color chart printed on
the pouch.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Negative saliva samples were collected from three volunteers who provided
the sample for each day of testing. Each volunteer was instructed to abstain
from consuming alcohol for 24 hours and not to smoke or consume any food
or drink 15 minutes prior to sample collection. The alcohol test solutions
were prepared from a stock solution containing ethanol standards in an
aqueous solution (from Sigma) diluted to each of the four cut off levels and
within +/- 60% of each cut off. The concentration of the alcohol in the
solution was confirmed on the Roche C501 using alcohol test reagent ETOH
Gen. 2. The test strip was saturated with each sample and allowed to stand for
2 min and was then compared to the color chart. A total of 20 replicates were
tested for over the course of three days. Three test strip lots were tested by 3
technicians, 10 replicates of which were tested on day 1 and the 5 replicates
on days 2 and 3 for a total of 60 tests per concentration.
The study results demonstrated 100% correct results rate, see table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. The assay is semi-quantitative and does not report a
numerical concentration.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Each lot of test strips is verified during manufacturing by using control
solutions that have been prepared from purchased ethanol solutions that are
confirmed using a chemistry analyzer. The control results from the test strips
are read visually by comparing to the color chart and then the color intensity
verified using a spectrophotometer. New lots are also visually checked in
comparison to the previously released lot.
The sponsor performed a study to determine the storage conditions for the
saliva samples. Samples were prepared from a pool of negative saliva
samples collected from alcohol-free volunteers and by adding ethanol from a
stock solution to obtain 0.02% and 0.08% ethanol. Each samples was divided
into 12 aliquots and stored at room temperature (15-25oC) and refrigerated (2-
8oC) ranging from 1 to 24 hours. An aliquot of each sample was tested
immediately to serve as the 0 hour time point. A total of 20 replicates were
tested for each concentration at each temperature at each time point.

The results support the claims in the labeling that the samples can be stored
for up to 4 hours at room temperature (15-25oC) or up to 8 hours refrigerated
(2-8oC).
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor performed a study where 20 negative saliva samples obtained
from 20 non-alcoholic volunteers were tested. Each volunteer collected their
own saliva and read the results on the test strip. A total of 20 replicates were
tested for each sample using three lots of test strips. The same tests were also
read by a laboratory technician. The results demonstrated that 100% of the
negative samples were correctly identified, therefore demonstrating that this
device had no false positives in this study.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed the following studies to evaluate the effect of cigarette
smoke, volatile substances, lighting and temperature on the results of the test.
Cigarette smoke:
The effect of cigarette smoke on the Mission Saliva Alcohol Test Strip was
evaluated by selecting 10 volunteers, 5 of which were not alcohol drinkers and
5 who were designated alcohol-drinkers. On the day of testing each
participant was smoked ½ to 1 cigarette then provided saliva samples at 1
minute and 15 minutes after smoking. For the alcohol drinking participants,
saliva samples were also collected and tested 15 minutes after alcohol
consumption and prior to smoking. The non-alcohol drinkers collected saliva
from the alcohol drinking participants and performed the test in 5 replicates at
each time point. The same tests were also read by a laboratory technician for
comparison. Additionally, the technician also checked that BAC level of each
alcohol-drinker using the Alco-Sensor IV at each time point. Results from the
lay-users are as follows:

Results demonstrate a 100% correct call rate for non-alcohol drinkers 15 min
after smoking. False positive results were obtained when the test was
performed less than 1 minute following smoking. The package insert contains
the limitation that the user is instructed to wait 20 minutes after smoking
before performing the test.
Temperature:
The effect of temperature on the Mission Saliva Alcohol Test Strip was
evaluated using alcohol-free saliva from volunteers and control solutions
prepared at each cutoff level and at +/-60% of each cut off level tested at six
different temperature conditions: 2-8, 10, 15, 27, 30, and 40°C. The
concentration of the alcohol in the prepared solution was confirmed using the
Roche C501 chemistry analyzer. All samples and test strips were placed at
different temperatures and allowed to equilibrate for 2 hours prior to testing.
The test pad of each strip was saturated with each sample and allowed to stand
for 2 minutes prior to reading the result. A total of 20 replicates were tested
for each sample at each temperature.
There were no deviations from the expected results for temperatures between
15 and 40°C. The labeling instructs the user to bring all test items to room
temperature for 15 minutes before use.
Lighting:
The effect of different lighting conditions on the Mission Saliva Alcohol Test
was evaluated using alcohol-free saliva and control solutions prepared at each
cut off level and at +/-60% of each cut off level and tested under five lighting
conditions: daylight, incandescent, fluorescent, mercury vapor, sodium vapor.
The negative samples were prepared from a pool of alcohol-free saliva
samples collected form five volunteers. An alcohol control solution was used
to obtain the desired alcohol concentrations. The solutions with different
concentrations were randomly labeled and tested. A total of 20 replicates for
each sample were tested by technicians, with 5 replicates per lighting
condition. Results are provided in the following table:

The study demonstrates a 100% agreement with the expected results for all
lighting conditions except sodium vapor. The labeling contains a limitation to
not read the test under streetlights as sodium vapor from streetlights can cause
colors to appear differently and cause false results.
The effect of different lighting conditions on the Mission Saliva Alcohol Test
was also tested by ten volunteers who performed the test under the five
lighting conditions (daylight, incandescent, fluorescent, mercury vapor,
sodium vapor) using negative saliva samples and saliva containing 0.008%
and 0.032%. The samples were prepared from a pool of negative saliva
samples collected from five non-alcoholic volunteers. The volunteers was
instructed to abstain form consuming alcohol for 24 hours and not to smoke or
consume any food or drink 15 minutes prior to sample collection. The alcohol
test solutions were prepared form a stock solution. Each of the volunteers
performed the test according to the package insert under each lighting
condition. Each volunteer tested each sample using 20 strips for a total of 200
readings for each lighting condition using three lots of test strips. The results
of this study demonstrated that the volunteers were able to obtain the correct
result using the device under the different lighting conditions.
Interfering Substances:
The effect of common food and products on the Mission Saliva Alcohol Test
Strip was evaluated by selecting 10 volunteers, 5 of which were not alcohol
drinkers and 5 who were designated alcohol-drinkers. On the day of testing
each participant consumed one piece of chewing gum, mouth wash, one spray

of breath spray, and cough syrup and then provided saliva samples at 1 minute
and 15 minutes after consumption. For the alcohol drinking participants,
saliva samples were also collected and tested 15 minutes after alcohol
consumption and prior to consumption of the substances listed above. The
non-alcohol drinkers collected saliva from themselves and the alcohol
drinking participants and performed the test in 5 replicates at each time point.
Additionally, the technician also checked that BAC level of each alcohol-
drinker using the Alco-Sensor IV at each time point.
Results from these studies demonstrated a 100% correct call rate with the
samples from the non-alcohol drinkers and alcohol-drinkers at the 15 minute
time point. The results at the <1 min time point demonstrated interference
from chewing gum, mouth wash, cough syrup, and breath spray. The
labeling states that the user should wait 20 minutes after using over-the-
counter products, eating, smoking, or chewing gum before testing. Such items
may cause false positive results.
Volatile Substances:
The effect of volatile substances on the Mission Saliva Alcohol Test Strip was
evaluated by spiking negative saliva samples from 5 alcohol-free volunteers
with the following volatile substances: acetone, 2-butanol, 1-butanol, glycerol,
isopropanol and methanol at an initial concentration of 1.0%. A total of 20
replicates were tested for each substance. Volatile substances at 1.0%
resulting in a positive result were further diluted to determine the lowest level
at which the correct result is found. The substances were also tested for each
cut off level and at +/-60% of each cut off. Substances at 1.0% resulting in a
positive result were diluted further tested to determine the lowest level at
which a correct result was found. The conclusion from these studies is that
the Mission Saliva Alcohol Test Strip will generate positive results in the
presence of methanol at 0.01% and 1-butanol at 0.1% whereas substances at
the following concentrations, which are included in the labeling, do not
interfere with the testing results at each of the cut off levels:
Concentration at which no
Substance interference was observed
1-Butanol 0.05%

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor conducted a consumer study comparing the Mission Saliva
Alcohol test to results from the Alco-Sensor IV (Intoximeters Inc.) which is
an alcohol breath test which is listed on the NHTSA/DOT Conforming
Products List for Evidential Breath Testing Devices. After reading the
package insert 32 participants, designated as the alcohol-drinkers, and 32 non-
alcohol drinkers provided their own saliva to Mission saliva alcohol test strips.
The participants designated as the non-alcohol drinker and a technician then
performed the test using the alcohol-drinker’s saliva. The technician also
performed the breath alcohol test using the Alco-Sensor IV. The studies were
performed under regular incandescent light with a total of 296 test strips used
for the study. The process was repeated approximately every 15 minutes for a
total of 4 times, therefore each participant provided 4 saliva samples and 4
breath samples for a total of 128 saliva samples for the study. After the study
the participants completed a questionnaire regarding the ease of use and
interpretation of results.
The sponsor performed a separate study with 41 non-alcohol drinkers who
performed the Mission Saliva Test with their own saliva. Technicians also
tested the saliva and breath from the participants using the Mission Saliva Test
and Alco-Sensor IV, respectively. In this study 100% of the results were
negative using the Mission Saliva Test and correlated with 0.0% results from
the Alco-Sensor IV. The results are complied and presented in the following
table:
The results obtained by the lay-user compared to the Alco-Sensor IV readings
are presented in the following table:
