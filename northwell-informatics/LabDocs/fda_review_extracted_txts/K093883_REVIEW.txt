Approved guideline Second-Edition
L. Test Principle:
AST catalyzes the transfer of amino group from aspartate to oxoglutarate during the
formation of glutamate and oxaloacetate. Oxaloacetate is reduced to malate by malate
dehydrogenase (MHD). During this conversion, an equivalent amount of NADH is oxidized
to NAD. The resulting decrease in absorbance at 340 nm is directly proportional to the
activity of AST in serum.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
ELITech Clinical Systems AST/GOT 4+1 SL
Precision was evaluated with one quality control material and two adjusted human
serum pool samples. A human serum pool diluted with saline (low), a control serum
(medium), and a spiked human serum pool (high) on the Vital Scientific Selectra
Junior Analyzer following CLSI EP5-A2 guideline. Samples were analyzed in
duplicate, twice a day for 20 days. Results are summarized in the table below:
Material n Mean Within-run Total
(U/L) SD CV (%) SD CV (%)
Diluted Serum 80 21.2 0.48 2.3% 0.80 3.8%
Pool (low)
Control Serum 80 46.4 0.36 0.8% 0.56 1.2%
(medium)
Spiked Serum 80 203.4 1.04 0.5% 5.52 2.7%
Pool (high)

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
ELITech Clinical Systems AST/GOT 4+1 SL
Linearity across the assay range was determined by testing two pools of patient
serum, one at a low concentration (9.2 U/L) and one at a high concentration (272
U/L). The low sample was prepared by diluting the serum sample pool with saline
and the high sample was prepared by spiking the serum sample pool. All samples
were assayed in triplicate. Data was analyzed using 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order least square
regressions according to CLSI Protocol EP6-A. The difference in predicted values
between the first and second order models are as follows:
1st order y= 26.27x- 17.37
2nd order y=0.06x2 + 25.51x -15.72
The sponsor chose the 2nd order regression because it is significant and the results are
shown in the table below:
Based on the data, the sponsor claimed that the assay’s linearity range is 10 to 250
U/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Elical 2, Elitrol I and II are traceable to IFCC formulation (Schulman, 2002).
Elitrol I and II
Elical 2, Elitrol I & II are value assigned using two Vital Scientific Flexor Junior
Analyzers. Each sample is tested in triplicate over several days. The target value of
Level I and II are the median of the observed values range. After validation of the
target value, a confidence range (high and low values) is then calculated.
7

--- Page 8 ---
Elical 2
The calibrator is tested against predetermined intervals on multiple Vital Scientific
Selectra Junior using the AST reagent and 2 levels of quality control material. The
mean analyte value is calculated and a target value is assigned.
The ELITech Clinical Systems AST/GOT 4+1 SL is stable until the expiration date
printed on the label when stored at 2-8˚C. The on-board stability of the reagent is 28
days.
Before reconstitution, the shelf-life of the ELITech Clinical Systems Elitrol 1 and
Elitrol II is 30 months at 2-8˚C. After reconstitution the stability is 12 hours when
stored at 15-25˚C, 5 days when stored at 2-8˚C and 4 weeks (when frozen once) at -
25˚ and -15˚ C.
Elical 2 is stable until the expiration date printed on the label when stored at 2-8˚C
prior to reconstitution. After reconstitution the stability is 8 hours when stored at 15-
25˚C, 2 days at 2-8˚C and 4 weeks (when frozen once) at -25˚and -15˚C. The labeling
stated that the Elical 2 should be stored tightly capped and protected from light when
not in use.
d. Detection limit:
AST/GOT 4+1 SL
A detection limit study was evaluated according to CLSI EP17-A guideline. LoB was
determined by running a blank sample 60 times on the Vital Scientific Selectra Junior
analyzer. The limit of detection (LoD) was determined by assaying 4 low (3.6 U/L)
diluted sample pools 60 times on the Selectra Junior analyzer. Limit of Quantitation
(LoQ) was determined by running 4 low (5 U/L) diluted sample pools 60 times on the
Vital Scientific Selectra Junior analyzer.
LoB LoD LoQ
Limits 0.9 U/L 1.8 U/L 5.0 U/L
The claimed measuring range is 10-250 U/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
AST/GOT 4+1 SL
Testing for interfering substances was based on CLSI EP-7A. Testing was performed
on a minimum of five concentrations for each interfering substances. Samples with
increasing amounts of triglycerides (Intralipid®), Bilirubin, Ditaurobilirubin, Sodium
Pyruvate, and Ascorbic Acid were tested in triplicate and compared to the same
sample without the interferent.

The sponsor defined non-significant interference as the highest level tested that does
not cause >10% change between the tested samples and the control sample.

The labeling states that hemolyzed samples should not be used since significant
hemolysis may increase AST concentration because of high levels of AST in
erythrocytes.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed using the HORIBA ABX AST CP
reagent on a PENTRA 400 chemistry analyzer and the ELITech AST/GOT 4+1 SL
reagent on the Selectra Junior analyzer according to CLSI protocol EP9-A2. A total
of 70 serum samples covering the linearity of the AST/GOT 4+1 SL assay were
assayed. Of these 70 samples, 61 were native samples, and 9 were spiked samples
(sample range from 15.5-244.8 U/L). The comparison resulted in a slope of 1.016, an
intercept of -1.86, correlation coefficient of r2=0.9998. The standard error of the
estimate is equal to 3.6 U/L
b. Matrix comparison:
Thirty paired serum and plasma (lithium heparin) samples, ranging from 16.8 to 216
U/L, were tested on the Selectra Junior analyzer. 27 were native patient samples and 3
were spiked samples. The comparison resulted in a slope of 0.992, an intercept of
+0.58, correlation coefficient of r2 =0.997, The standard error of the estimate is equal
to 4.2 U/L.
Based on the data, the sponsor claims that lithium heparin is an acceptable anti-
coagulant for this assay.
