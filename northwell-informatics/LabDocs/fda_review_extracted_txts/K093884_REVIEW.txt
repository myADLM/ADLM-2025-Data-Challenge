H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
DAT Oral Fluid Methamphetamine (OFMA) is an in vitro diagnostic test for the
qualitative and semiquantitative detection of methamphetamine in human oral fluid
at a cutoff concentration of 120 ng/mL in neat oral fluid. The specimen must be
collected exclusively with the Intercept® Oral Specimen Collection Device.
Semiquantitative test results may be obtained that permit laboratories to assess
assay performance as part of a quality control program and to estimate a dilution of
the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as LC/MS/MS.
DAT Oral Fluid Methamphetamine provides only a preliminary analytical test
result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a
confirmed analytical result. Chromatography/mass spectrometry is the preferred
confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be
applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive
results are used.
The Oral Fluid DAT Control Set A is for use as assayed controls with the DAT Oral
Fluid assays on automated clinical chemistry analyzers for human oral fluid samples
collected with the Intercept Oral Specimen Collection Device.
The Oral Fluid DAT Qual Cal calibrators are designed for the calibration of oral
fluid assays for drugs of abuse on automated clinical chemistry analyzers for human
oral fluid samples collected with the Intercept Oral Specimen Collection Device.

L. Test Principle:
The assay is based on the kinetic interaction of microparticles in a solution (KIMS) as
measured by changes in light transmission. In the absence of sample drug, soluble drug
conjugates bind to antibody-bound microparticles, causing the formation of particle
aggregates. As the aggregation reaction proceeds in the absence of sample drug, the
absorbance increases. When an oral fluid sample contains the drug in question, this drug
competes with the drug derivative conjugate for microparticle-bound antibody. Antibody
bound to sample drug is no longer available to promote particle aggregation, and
subsequent particle lattice formation is inhibited. The presence of sample drug diminishes
the increasing absorbance in proportion to the concentration of drug in the sample.
The Intercept® Oral Specimen Collection Device contains a preservative buffer that
dilutes the neat oral fluid sample. The calibrator and control levels are set at diluted
levels so that sample absorbance values can be compared directly to the absorbance
values of the calibration curve. The assay result is reported as a positive or negative
result relative to the neat oral fluid cutoff of 120 ng/mL.
NOTE: To correlate a semi-quantitative Intercept® result from the assay or the
associated LC/MS/MS confirmation result to a neat oral fluid value, the result from the
Intercept sample should be multiplied by a factor of 3.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All analytical performance data was collected on human oral fluid samples
collected with the Intercept Oral Specimen Collection Device and analyzed on
the Roche MODULAR P analyzer. The Intercept collection device includes a
diluent that results in a dilution of approximately 1/3. The assay cannot be
used to measure undiluted (neat) samples. Analyte concentrations refer to the
neat oral fluid concentration, unless otherwise noted.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Two studies were performed with the assay to evaluate precision.
In the first study, a d-methamphetamine solution was added to each of 9
samples which were obtained from a human oral fluid pool of samples
collected with the Intercept® Oral Specimen Collection Device to achieve
concentrations at approximately -100 %, -75 %, -50 %, -25 %, 0 %, +25 %,
+50 %, +75 %, and +100 % of the cutoff calibrator value. The samples
5

--- Page 6 ---
were tested for precision in qualitative and semiquantitative modes.
Following a CLSI (EP5-A2) precision protocol, samples were tested in 2
replicates per run, 2 runs per day for 21 days, total n = 84. One lot each of
reagent, calibrator, and control were used during the study and there were
ten calibrations performed during the study.

In the second study, a d-methamphetamine solution was added to neat
human oral fluid sample pools at concentrations of 60, 90, 150, and 180
ng/mL. Each spiked sample pool was then processed through each of 21
Intercept® Devices to achieve final concentrations at approximately -50 %,
-25 %, +25 %, and +50 %, of the cutoff calibrator value. The intra-assay
precision of the samples, including the processing of the samples through
the collection device, was then tested in qualitative and semiquantitative
modes with the Oral Fluid Methamphetamine assay.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To assess linearity, aliquots of a neat OF pool were spiked with d-
methamphetamine at concentrations of: 0, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, 480,
and 960 ng/mL. Each level was processed through 2 separate Intercept
collection devices. The diluted sample from both Intercept devices was
then analyzed once in semi-quantitative mode. The data below was
analyzed with one calibration using one lot of reagent.
Results were as follows:
Spiked Neat
Recovery (%)
Concentration
0 n/a
60 114.0
90 113.6
120 (cutoff) 109.7
150 107.2
180 108.2
240 110.9
480 109.0
960 85.4
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
The assay is calibrated against methamphetamine.
Calibrators and control materials are specified in the labeling but are
supplied separately from the reagents. For the qualitative assay, only
CAL 2 (40 ng/mL) is required. For the semi-quantitative assay, six
levels of calibrator material, ranging in concentration from 0 to 320
ng/mL are required. Calibrators and controls consist of a synthetic oral
fluid matrix spiked with known concentrations of d-methamphetamine.
The concentration of methamphetamine in the calibrators and controls is
verified by LC/MS/MS.
The open vial stability claim for calibrators and controls is 20 days after
opening when stored at 2–8° C. The closed vial stability claim for
calibrators and controls is one year from the time of manufacture when
stored at 2–8° C.

The sponsor’s stability protocols were reviewed and found to be
acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
Performance at low drug concentrations in the semi-quantitative assay
was characterized by determination of recovery (see section b above).
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed analytical specificity studies on four categories
of potential interferents: structurally related substances, structurally
unrelated substances, substances endogenous to oral fluid, and food and
dental substances.
Cross Reactivity to Structurally Related Compounds
Cross-reactivity was evaluated by spiking various concentrations of
similarly structured drug compounds into a drug-free oral fluid pool
collected with the Intercept Oral Fluid Specimen Collection Device. By
analyzing various concentration of each compound the sponsor
determined the concentration of the drug that produced a response
approximately equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the assay.

Interference from Structurally Unrelated Compounds
Potential interference from structurally unrelated compounds was tested
in both semi-quantitative and qualitative mode by spiking the potentially
interfering compound into pools of human oral fluid collected with the
Intercept Oral Fluid Specimen Collection Device. Since the samples
were diluted as part of the collection process, the effective concentration
of potential interferent in neat oral fluid samples is approximately three
times the tested concentration. Both a positive concentration (+50% of
the cutoff) and a negative concentration (-50% of the cutoff) of d-
methamphetamine were evaluated. All were tested at a concentration of
10,000 ng/mL with the following exceptions: Loperamide was tested at
3,000 ng/mL, Procainamide was tested at 2,000 ng/mL, Procaine was
tested at 500 ng/mL, and Ranitidine was tested at 5,000 ng/mL

Interference from Endogenous Interferents and pH
Potential interference from substances endogenous to oral fluid were
tested in both semi-quantitative and qualitative mode by spiking the
potentially interfering substance into pools of human oral fluid
collected with the Intercept Oral Fluid Specimen Collection Device.
Both a positive concentration (+50% of the cutoff) and a negative
concentration (-50% of the cutoff) of d-methamphetamine were
evaluated.
The following potential endogenous interferents were spiked into the
negative and positive oral fluid samples at the noted concentrations.
No negative or positive interference was seen in this study and all
negative and positive controls recovered properly in the presence of
the interfering substance in both qualitative and semi-quantitative
modes.

An additional study was performed in which samples containing d-
methamphetamine at +50% and -50% of the cutoff with pH ranging
from 2.0 to 8.5 were tested. All of the samples above the cutoff read
positive and all of the samples below the cutoff read negative.

Interference from Food and Dental Products
The following potential interferents were evaluated by spiking into
oral fluid samples collected with the intercept device: Alcohol
(ethanol), Antiseptic Mouthwash, Baking soda, Cough Syrup, Whole
blood, Cranberry juice, Hemoglobin, Hydrogen peroxide, Sodium
chloride, Sugar, Toothpaste, and Water. None of these substances
caused positive or negative interference.
The effect of potential food and other oral cavity contaminants
(alcohol, antacid, baking soda, chewing tobacco, cigarettes, cola,
cough syrup, cranberry juice, gum, hard candy, milk, orange juice, salt,
sugar, toothpaste, water, and tooth whitening strips) were also
examined. No interference was observed in samples collected at least
10 minutes after the use of the above substances. Note: It is not
possible to document all possible effects of oral activities such as
eating food, chewing gum, drinking, and dental care activities.
Therefore, all possible activities that may affect how readily
methamphetamines are eliminated from saliva to below the cutoff
level have not been fully evaluated.
There is the possibility that other substances and/or factors not listed
above may interfere with the test and cause false results, e.g., technical
or procedural errors.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the
claimed cutoff concentration appears in the precision above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Two method comparison studies were performed. In the first study, 20
positive and 20 negative samples were analyzed. In order to evaluate
the performance of the entire system, three measurements were taken
on each specimen: the LC/MS/MS concentration of the neat sample,
the LC/MS/MS concentration of the diluted Intercept sample, and the
immunoassay concentration of the diluted Intercept sample.

Number of instruments used: one
The LC/MS/MS values of the neat and diluted samples confirmed the
dilution ratio of approximately 1/3. When the neat oral fluid values
were compared to the immunoassay values, the following results were
obtained. Note: The values obtained in this study were collected from
samples containing MAMP prior to the collection step. Therefore the
results reflect the performance of the entire system including the
collection step.

In the second study, 40 negative and 40 positive samples were
analyzed. These included four negative near cutoff samples and four
positive near cutoff samples.
Note: this study was performed on samples already collected with the
Intercept collection device. When the LC/MS/MS values of the
diluted samples were compared to the immunoassay values, the
following results were obtained. Therefore the results below do not
reflect any inaccuracy inherent in the collection process itself.
