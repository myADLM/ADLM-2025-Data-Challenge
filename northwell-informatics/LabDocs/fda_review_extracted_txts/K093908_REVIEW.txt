I. Device Description:
The CCPoint® test is a colloidal gold based lateral flow immunoassay. Reactive
cyclic citrullinated peptides are immobilized as a discrete line on a porous membrane
located in the test zone. The detection reagent, consisting of colloidal gold particles
conjugated to anti-human IgG, is deposited within the device onto the conjugate pad.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None
L. Test Principle:
In the assay procedure, a sample of blood is added to the sample port. A blood cell
separation membrane transfers the sample fluid onto the porous membrane. After a
short incubation running buffer is added to the buffer port. This buffer mobilizes the
colloidal gold particles from the conjugate pad. The gold particles and the sample
move by capillary force across the membrane. If the sample contains anti-CCP
antibodies they will bind to the peptide-antigens and a red line will appear in the test
zone (marked T). If the sample does not contain any anti-CCP antibodies no line will
appear. With any sample a red control line should appear in the control zone (marked
C). The control ensures that the coated colloidal gold is still active.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Inter-assay performance of the CCPoint assay was determined by testing 8
human serum samples: negative, low positive, and high positive for

interferents to the following concentrations: Bilirubin F at 18.8 mg/dL,
Bilirubin C at 20 mg/dL, Haemoglobin at 453 mg/dL, Chyle at 23.6 U/dL and
Rheumatoid Factor (IgM) at 55 IU/mL. No significant interference effects
were observed with any of the samples.
To assess potential cross-reactivity of CCP IgG antigen with other
autoantibodies, a total of 498 samples of different etiology were assayed.
Samples from patients diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, Colitis ulcerosa, SLE,
Sjögren’s syndrome, Osteoarthritis, Scleroderma, Multiple sclerosis, MCTD,
Inflammatory bowel disease, Polymyositis/Dermatomyositis, nonRA
autoimmune patients and samples reacting with MPO-ANCA, PR3-ANCA
and ds-DNA. Data indicates that the assayed autoantibodies show no
significant cross-reactivity.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cutoff was established by designing the CCPoint assay so that the visual
cutoff correlated with the 25 U/mL cutoff established for the predicate ELISA
assay (the Eurodiagnostica Immunoscan RA anti-CCP Test Kit). Two
preliminary studies with patient samples were performed and the cutoff was
set to minimize nonconcordant results between CCPoint and the Immunoscan
RA anti-CCP Test Kit. A total of 78 samples (39 negative and 39 positive)
were used for these studies, including several samples close to the cutoff.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 403 frozen retrospective sera samples that were within the
reportable range of the predicate device where tested with both the predicate
assay and with CCPoint. Note that very few negative samples are within the
reportable range of the predicate assay (15-1600 U/mL), because the cutoff is
very close to the lower limit of the reportable range at 25 U/mL. The results
are shown in the table below. 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated
using the exact method.

Overall Percent Agreement: 393/399 = 98.5% 95% CI = 96.8 - 99.4%
Overall, 1052 frozen retrospective serum samples (596 from RA patients and
456 from apparently healthy donors) were tested with both the predicate assay
and with CCPoint. The method comparison results with all samples included
are shown in the table below.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity
A total of 596 frozen retrospective sera from patients with clinically defined
RA were assayed. 438 of these samples were positive using the CCPoint assay
and 158 were negative. The clinical specificity of the CCPoint assay was
tested using a total of 1219 retrospective sera samples from patients
characterized as negative for RA, including 456 asymptomatic patients
(healthy blood donors) and 763 samples from non-RA diseased patients. The
results are summarized in the table below:
