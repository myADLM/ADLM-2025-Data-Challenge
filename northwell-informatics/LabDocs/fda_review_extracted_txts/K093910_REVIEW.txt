H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indication for use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
IMPROVACUTER Gel & Clot Activator Tube is a single use tube used to collect,
transport, separate, and process venous blood specimens to obtain serum for clinical
chemistry and immunology assays. It is used in settings where a venous blood sample is
collected by a trained healthcare worker. For in vitro diagnostic use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription Use only.
These blood collection tubes are not recommended for Therapeutic drug monitoring
(TDM), blood banking and infectious disease testing.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Specific analyzers used to evaluate the device are listed in the labeling and below in
section M. 2. a. method comparison.
I. Device Description:
The IMPROVACUTER Gel & Clot Activator Tube is sterile, plastic, evacuated blood
collection tube. The tube consists of (1) a closure assembly, (2) a silica clot activator, (3) a
barrier gel and (4) a plastic tube. The specimens are used for clinical laboratory assays
involving the use of patient serum.
The IMPROVACUTER Gel & Clot Activator Tube is a 13 x 100 mm, 5.0 mL, and plastic
evacuated tube with either a gold conventional closure or a gray safety cap. The interior of
the tube wall is coated with clot activator to promote rapid clotting. The tube contains a gel
barrier polymer at the tube bottom. The density of this material causes it to move upward
during centrifugation to the serum-clot interface, where it forms a barrier separating serum
from the clot. Serum may be aspirated directly from the collection tube, eliminating the need
to transfer to another container. The tube interior is sterile and the product is for single use
only.

L. Test Principle:
The IMPROVACUTER Gel & Clot Activator Tube (IMP tube) is intended to be placed
inside either a holder or an adapter of a blood collection system. Once the vein of the patient
has been penetrated using a standard needle, the tube is pushed fully into the needle holder so
that the non-patient’s end of the needle pierces the rubber septum of the stopper of the tube.
The tube uses a controlled vacuum to pull a specific volume of blood into the sterile interior
of the tube. The pressure differential caused the venous blood to flow into the tube. Once
pressure is equalized, the blood flow ceases and the tube is withdrawn from the needle holder
or needle. After blood has been drawn, the tube shall be immediately inverted gently for 5 to
8 times to mix the blood with the additives, and then allowed to clot completely. The
recommended minimum clotting time is 30 minutes. Once clotting is complete, the tube is to
be centrifuged for 10 minutes (when using a swing bucket centrifuge) or 15 minutes (when
using a fixed angle centrifuge), at RCF (g force) of 1500-2200.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed in conjunctions with the method comparison studies
at two external hospital sites. Within-lot precision study and between-lot precision
study were performed separately. Testing were performed using twenty apparently
healthy subjects per study. For within-lot precision study, each subject has a venous
blood collection into four tubes: two IMP tubes with the same lot number and two BD
tubes with the same lot number. For between-lot precision study, each subject has a
venous blood collection into four tubes: two IMP tubes with different lot numbers and
two BD tubes with different lot numbers. Each tube was tested in duplicates for each of
the 38 analytes and on multiple different instrument platforms. Results (within-lot and
between-lot precision) on one representative instrument platform are summarized in the
tables below:

Results of the predicate type tube, BD SST, were very similar to the candidate tube type.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Real time shelf life studies of the IMP tubes showed that the tube is stable for 12
months when stored at 4o to 25oC. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria and protocol was
provided and found to be acceptable.
To demonstrate analyte stability in the IMP tubes, analyte stability studies were
performed at 0 hrs (as control), 24 hrs, 48 hrs after collecting blood into the tubes and
stored at 2-8oC and at 22-25oC (in the original blood tubes). Studies were performed in
conjunctions with the method comparison studies with 40 subjects. See summary in
M.2.a. below.
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed that the IMP tubes have analyte
stability for up to 24 hours when stored at 2-8oC and at 22-25oC except for TBIL.
Additional stability study was performed to evaluate the stability of TBIL and the
results provided by the sponsor demonstrated that TBIL is stable up to 20 hours when
stored at 22-25oC. This information is provided in the sponsor’s package insert.
Acceptance criteria for analyte stability was provided and found to be acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To demonstrate comparable performance with the predicate device, apparently healthy
subjects and patients admitted into hospitals with various diseases were used. Testing
was performed at two hospital sites. All subjects in the comparative studies have blood
samples collected into the IMP tubes (candidate device) and the BD SST (predicate
tubes) at the same time. The specimens were allowed to clot, and the serum was removed
for testing immediately after centrifugation according to the instructions provided in the
labeling. Evaluations were performed on a selective common chemistry analytes,
immunology analytes, and serological analytes on multiple instrument platforms. A total
of 41 analytes were evaluated and demonstrated comparable results between the IMP
tubes and the BD SST tubes. Summary of the results (linear regressions correlations with
95% confidence intervals) on one representative platform with the analytes and instruments
evaluated are provided in the tables below:

Summary of all the method comparison studies:
Study 1: 127 adult subjects were recruited and tested in hospital site 1. Testing was
performed in that hospital laboratory. Chemistry results were generated for 31 general
chemistry analytes on a Roche PPI instrument and 5 immunoassay analytes on an Abbott
I2000 instrument. Troponin I result was generated on an Abbott AxSym instrument and
IgE result was generated on a UNICAP analyzer. Three serological analytes (CMV IgG,
IgM and VZV-IgG) were generated on an Anthos micro-plate reader.
Study 2: 125 adult subjects were recruited and tested in hospital site 2. Testing was
performed in that hospital laboratory. Chemistry results were generated for 31 general
chemistry analytes on a Beckman DxC 800 instrument and 3 immunoassay analytes on a
Bayer Centaur. Troponin I and hCG results were generated on a Beckman Access II
instrument. Ferritin and IgE results were generated on a Roche E170 analyzer. Three
