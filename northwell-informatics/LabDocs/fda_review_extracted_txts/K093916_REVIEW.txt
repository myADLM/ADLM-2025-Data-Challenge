Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures
L. Test Principle:
The measurement of amino acids, succinylacetone, free carnitine, and acylcarnitines
with the NeoBase assay involves extraction of dried blood spots from newborns with
a solution containing stable-isotope labeled internal standards and analysis using a
tandem mass spectrometry (MSMS) system. The response of each analyte relative to
their corresponding stable-isotope labeled internal standard is proportional to analyte
concentration.
In the NeoBase Non-derivatized MSMS Kit, data is acquired in the Multiple Reaction
Monitoring (MRM) mode. During this acquisition, a collisionally induced of each
analyte is measured for a set time period. Data acquisition and processing is
performed by the software package included with the system.
The triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer that is used for these measurements is a
computer-controlled device that separates and quantitates ions based on their mass to
charge (m/z) ratio. The extracted sample is delivered to the ion source of the mass
spectrometer by the liquid chromatography (LC) system consisting of the
autosampler, micro pump(s) and solvent vacuum degasser. What is reported in the
MSMS MRM spectrum is the m/z value of the precursor ions that generated a desired
product.
Analyte extraction with the NeoBase assay is accomplished for the amino acids and
carnitines by contacting the sample with the extraction solution containing the
corresponding internal standards during the incubation step. However,

succinylacetone requires a specific derivatization reaction during the incubation step
for its extraction and measurement. The derivatization and extraction of
succinylacetone takes place simultaneously with the extraction of other analytes by
addition of an aliquot of the Succinylacetone Assay Solution to the extraction mixture
containing internal standards.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Data shown are acquired using the Perkin Elmer TQD MS/MS Screening System in
the MRM mode.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Study Design:
A reproducibility study using the NeoBase Assay and the PerkinElmer TQD
MS/MS Screening System was performed across multiple instruments, operators,
kit lots and sites. The plan consisted of the analysis of dried blood spots samples
at three different analyte concentration levels. The study included three TQD
instruments (one at each of the participating sites) six different operators, three
different NeoBase kit lots (Lot # 493696, 504089, and 511546) and three different
external sites.
Each run consisted of the analysis of 6 replicates of each sample level (6 distinct
dried blood punches and sample preparations) by one operator using one kit lot on
one instrument at each site. Each day, there were two runs (two different
operators) per instrument and kit lot. The analysis was carried out for five days
for each instrument and kit lot. Overall, there were a total of 30 runs per
instrument (5 runs per operator and kit lot on each instrument). Each operator
performed a run on each of 5 distinct days (not necessarily consecutively) for an
instrument and kit lot.
The Total %CV was determined as the square root of the sum of squares of the
variation components mentioned above and according the equation below, where
Wr is the Within-Run variation, Br is the Between- Run component of variation,
Bl is the Between-Lot variation and Bi/o is the Between-Instrument and Operator
contribution to variability.
Total imprecision = [(Wr)2 + (Br)2 + (Bi/o)2 + (Bl)2 ]1/2
Results:
The overall results for the reproducibility study on the TQD platform are
summarized in the tables below. For comparison purposes, these tables also
present the original reproducibility results. Mean concentrations are in μM/L

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrator and control materials were previously cleared under the
predicate 510(k), k083130. Mean values for controls are obtained by running
replicate measurements using the Neobase Non-derivatized MSMS kit. The
package insert states that laboratories should ensure compliance with
appropriate local and national requirements.
d. Detection limit:
The evaluation consisted of excising discs from a set of blood spots that were
placed in microtiter plate wells and extracted with the NeoBase extraction
solution. Upon completion of the extraction, the extracts from each disc were
pooled by transferring 80uL from each extraction well and into a common vial
and mixed thoroughly. These solutions are referred to as “DBS extract
diluents”. Next, an aliquot of each of the pooled extracts was taken and spiked
with amino acid and acylcarnitine internal standards resulting in a high
internal standard concentration sample Level 1 which was mixed with the
DBS extract diluent in a 1:1 v/v ratio to obtain a Level 2 sample whose
internal standard concentration is expected to be one half of that present in the
Level 1 sample This procedure was followed serially until a total of 17
dilutions were accomplished from which 18 sample levels with decreasing
concentration of internal standards (Level 1 to 18) were obtained.
Three different approaches were employed for data analysis: 1) a stepwise
linear regression analysis, 2) a relative concentration response of adjacent
dilutions and 3) the precision of the replicate samples. Thresholds were
determined for each of the above parameters and the functional sensitivities
were established as the lowest concentration that met all three criteria. At
these concentrations the sponsor’s criteria for CV is less than or equal to 20%.
In addition, the ratio of measured responses between two adjacent levels in a
1:1 serial dilution was near 0.5.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interfering substances tested:
The manufacturer considered potential interferents based on whether a
substance could be found in the clinical sample and whether substances would
have molecular mass overlap with any analytes or internal standards detected
with the NeoBase assay. If the chemical structure of a substance indicated the
potential to have the same mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) as an analyte or internal
standard of interest, its structure was further examined to predict whether or
not this substance would fragment in the tandem mass spectrometry
experiment in such a way to produce the same mass transition as any of the
analytes or internal standards in the assay. Overall, 16 compounds were
identified as potential interfering candidates. These 16 substances and the
respective target analyte/internal standard with which they would interfere
(listed in the parenthesis) are Aminocaproic acid (Leu), Asparagine (Orn),
Creatine (Ala), Creatine (Leu), Dihydroxybenzoic acid (SA), Folic acid
(C18:1OH), Formiminoglutamic acid or FIGLU (Arg), Hydroxyproline ??

--- Page 15 ---
(Leu), Lidocaine (C4 IS), Malic acid (Leu IS), Methionine sulfone (Tyr),
Ornithine (Pro), Salicylic acid (Orn), Sarcosine (Ala), Penicillamine (Met),
Propranolol (C6), and Pseudoephedrine (Phe). Compounds that caused
significant affects on results included:
Asparagine interference on ornithine; creatine interference on alanine and
leucine; hydroxyproline interference on leucine; methionine sulfone
interference on tyrosine; sarcosine interference on alanine; chlorhexidine
gluconate interference on C5, C10 and other analytes. Results of these studies
are described more fully in the assay package insert together with other
reported potential interferents.
Carryover:
To evaluate carryover, six sets of borderline (i.e., within 2SD of the cutoff, or
medical decision point) samples were measured immediately after high
samples. When values remained below the established cutoff it was
determined that there is not clinically significant carry over for that analyte.
Some carryover was observed with Succinylacetone (SA). The results for the
study demonstrate that SA carryover may occur in cases where a Tyrosinemia
Type I patient with drastically elevated SA is followed by a borderline patient.
This is noted in the package insert. Carryover was not detected for other
analytes.
Drift:
This evaluation was set to run continuously for a total elapsed assay time of
approximately 24 hours to determine within-day drifting. Dried blood spots
were prepared using three enriched concentrations (Low, Mid, and High) of
amino acids, succinylacetone, free carnitine and acylcarnitines spiked into
whole blood.
Three low and three high blood spot controls were included for each run and
used as run qualifiers for this study. The time elapsed during the acquisition of
each run was 1.5 hours. The study analyzed a total of 16 runs (time points)
collected throughout one 24 hour-period. Analysis of the data indicates that
the assay variability over the 24-hour test period is well within the expected
precision of the assay as demonstrated by Between Run % CV and no trends
were detected in the mean measured concentrations for any of the analytes
studied.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.

Correlation Study:

--- Page 16 ---
The clinical correlation study to evaluate addition of the TQD instrument to
the previously cleared system was performed by evaluating paired samples
from the same specimens TQD and MS2 (predicate) platforms. The sample set
consisted of 2499 presumptive negative random neonatal samples, 19 samples
with true positive diagnoses. Eighty artificially enriched dried blood spots
were also evaluated. Clinical correlation was established by assessing whether
or not the methods were concordant in determining the paired samples to have
analyte concentration values above or below their pre-determined
corresponding cutoffs. (The predetermined cutoffs were determined based on
the 99.99th percentile of a negative sample set with removal of outliers based
on Dixon’s test (CLSI 28-A)). Percents agreement between the two methods
is shown in the able below.

b. Clinical specificity:
Not reviewed for this device type.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
See drift and carryover studies in 1. e. above.
4. Clinical cut-off:
The package insert states the following:
Each laboratory should run a pilot study to determine the distribution of the
concentrations for each analyte for their own population. From these distributions,
means and cut-off values should be determined. Cut-off values for reporting
abnormal result levels for each analyte should be established by using statistical
measurements (e.g. percentiles, means, and standard deviations) in consultation
with metabolic disease specialists who can provide additional guidance based on
incidence rates, disease severity, and typical profiles of known positive patients.
The determination of presumptive abnormal amino acid, succinylacetone, free
carnitine and acylcarnitine concentration profiles should be based on
predetermined cut-offs obtained from pilot studies performed with the NeoBase
Non-derivatized MSMS kit. If available, samples from patients with known
disorders (true positives) should be run to provide additional guidance in setting
conservative abnormal and borderline cut-off levels. As larger numbers of
samples and confirmation of presumptive positive results are obtained by each
laboratory, it is recommended that this information be used for reviewing the cut-
offs on a regular basis. The actions to be taken when specimens fall under either
of three categories – presumptive positive, borderline, and presumptive negative –
are described below.
Presumptive positives:
Results that are above (or below if it is a low cut-off) the abnormal cut-offs
should be considered presumptive positive. Retesting of the original specimen
with the original method is recommended for all specimens designated as
presumptive positive for one or more disorders or analytes. Follow local
regulations and guidelines for the handling and reporting of presumptive positive
results.
Borderline specimens:
Results that fall between the abnormal cut-off and the borderline cut-off should be
considered borderline results. Retesting of the original specimen with the origina
method is recommended for specimens whose initial results are borderline.

--- Page 23 ---
Follow local regulations and guidelines for the handling and reporting of
borderline results.
Repeat testing:
Regardless of whether retesting was initiated because of initial borderline or
presumptive positive status, if the repeat testing result is above the abnormal cut-
off (or below if it is a low cut-off) then the result should be considered
presumptive positive. Follow local regulations and guidelines for the handling and
reporting of presumptive positive results.
Regardless of whether retesting was initiated because of initial borderline or
abnormal status, if the repeat testing result falls between the abnormal and
borderline cut-offs, then all available data (initial and retesting) should be taken
into consideration to report the values according to local regulations and
guidelines.
Regardless of whether retesting was initiated because of initial borderline or
abnormal status, follow local regulations and guidelines in cases where retesting
results are below (or above if a low cut-off) the borderline cut-offs.
Presumptive negatives:
If all the initial results of any specimen, are below (or above if a low cut-off) all
the borderline and abnormal cut-offs, the result can be treated as presumptive
negative (or low risk) and reported appropriately.

N. Instrument Name:
PerkinElmer TQD MSMS Screening System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The TQ Detector used in the Perkin Elmer TQD MSMS Screening System is a
tandem quadrupole atmospheric pressure ionization (API) mass spectrometer.
2. Software:
Software (including firmware) documentation for all instrument components was
included in the 510(k).
3. Specimen Identification:
Barcodes are supplied for each plate as a whole, and each plate is scanned by the
system’s barcode reader. Scanning the plate creates a virtual 96 well map that can
be assigned samples. Operators may input the patient sample identification (used
by the laboratory) for each well in the plate either manually (by typing the
information in the plate map) or by using the barcode reader. The results are
generated according to the plate map and are thereby linked back to the sample.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The Intellistart fluidics system built into the TQ detector delivers the sample. The
extracted sample is delivered to the ion source of the mass spectrometer by the
liquid chromatography (LC) system consisting of the autosampler, micro pump(s)
and solvent vacuum degasser.
5. Calibration:
Tuning and calibration is performed from the software. Calibration files are
saved on the instrument setup parameters
6. Quality Control:
Control materials are provided by the manufacturer, and instructions for running
controls are provided in the labeling.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
the “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

The only difference between the instruments used in the predicate device (Quattro
Micro) and the TQD instruments is the architecture of the collision cell. In the
Quattro Micro the collision cell is a high efficiency hexapole, while in the TQD the
collision cell employs proprietary Travelling Wave Technology where instead of
using a hexapole as ion guide, a series of plates are stacked with concentric openings.
Voltage is applied to the plates on and off consecutively to execute the same function
of a hexapole but at faster speeds. This feature allows for the described enhanced scan
speed and sensitivity to the TQD platform. Despite this difference, the two platforms
are identical as far as the end user is concerned when employing the NeoBase
application on either platform.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
