L. Test Principle:
The Salicylate (SAL) method is based on the reaction of salicylate hydroxylase with
salicylate and NADH. Salicylate hydroxylase catalyzes the conversion of salicylate
and NADH to catechol and NAD+ in the presence of oxygen. The resulting decrease
in absorbance at 340/410 nm, due to the conversion of NADH to NAD+, is directly
proportional to the concentration of salicylate in the sample.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within run and within-lab (total) imprecision were evaluated by testing three
serum pools spiked with salicylate, two levels of a serum-based control
material and a calibrator. Concentrations ranged from a low of 6.40 mg/dL to
a high of 88.66 mg/dL. The concentrations were chosen to test the upper and
lower limits of the expected range of the assay, the medically significant cut-
off level as well as various levels throughout the assay range.
Each sample was assayed 2 times per run and 2 runs per day for 10 days, for a
total of 40 replicates per concentration. The study was run using one reagent
lot on one ADVIA 1650 Chemistry system, and one operator performed the
study.
Within-run and total run imprecision statistics were calculated and are
presented below:

Serum 3 88.66 0.21 0.2 0.18 0.2 1.01 1.1 1.05 1.2
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The claimed measuring range of the assay is 3 - 100 mg/dL
The low end of the assay range was calculated based on the Limit of Detection
studies. The assay range is based on the linearity and method comparison
studies.
To assess linearity, each of five (5) diluted serum samples was tested in
triplicate using one reagent lot on one ADVIA 1650 Chemistry system.
Results are presented below.

Linear regression of the data produced the following:
slope = 1.00
y-intercept = 0
r2 = 1.00
ADVIA Chemistry systems extend the salicylate assay measuring range by an
auto-rerun mechanism. This mechanism is triggered by a result above the
upper range of the assay. The highest reportable value using the auto-rerun
feature is 400 mg/dL.
The sponsor tested the auto-run feature as follows: a sample spiked to
approximately 400 mg/dL was analyzed using auto-rerun. The auto-rerun
feature produced a value of 391.4 mg/dL, or 98% recovery of the expected
value of 401.1 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
ADVIA Chemistry Salicylate assay is calibrated using ADVIA Chemistry
ToxAmmonia single-level calibrator cleared previously under k031683 and
available separately. Calibrator value assignment and stability were addressed
in k031683.
The sponsor does not specify the control materials, but recommends the use of
a commercially available control with at least three levels.
d. Detection limit:
The estimations of the Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD)
were performed by running 40 replicates of a blank (DI water) and 40
replicates of a low serum pool. The low serum pool was a serum based low

control with an approximate concentration of 6 mg/dL of salicylate. The
standard deviation calculated from the 40 replicates of the blank and 40
replicates of the low serum pool were then used to calculate the Limit of
Blank and Limit of Detection below.
Testing was conducted over a period of 10 days, 2 runs per day using one
ADVIA 1650 Chemistry system and one reagent lot. A total of 40 replicates
of each sample were run. One trained operator performed the testing.
The formulas described in the CLSI guideline EP17-A were used to determine
the LoB and LoD.
The LoB was calculated as 1.33 mg/dL using the formula:
LoB = Mean + 1.645 x total std dev of the blank
blank
The LoD was calculated as 2.24 mg/dL using the formula:
LoD = LoB + 1.645 x total std dev of the low sample concentration)
The sponsor selected 3 mg/dL as the lowest reportable concentration for the
assay.
e. Analytical specificity:
Analytical specificity for the salicylate method was evaluated with two serum
pools spiked with salicylate to approximately 20 and 50 mg/dL. Each of these
pools was further spiked with five different levels of hemoglobin,
unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin, or triglycerides (in the form of
Intralipid). Hemoglobin was added at concentrations up to 1000 mg/dL,
unconjugated bilirubin and conjugated bilirubin at concentrations up to 25
mg/dL, and Intralipid at concentrations up to 1000 mg/dL.
Each test sample was assayed in duplicate using one reagent lot on one
ADVIA 1650 Chemistry system. Calculations were performed by comparing
observed salicylate concentration at each level of interferent vs. observed
salicylate concentration of control (no interferent), expressed in %.
