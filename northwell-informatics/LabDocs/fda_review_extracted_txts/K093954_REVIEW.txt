The BioPlex 2200 Anti-CCP kit uses multiplex flow immunoassay, a methodology
similar to traditional EIA; however, this method permits simultaneous detection and
identification of many antibodies in a single tube. One population of fluorescent
beads is coated with streptavidin-biotinylated CCP. Three populations of fluorescent
beads function as assay controls. The system combines an aliquot of patient sample,
sample diluent, and bead reagent into a reaction vessel and incubates the mixture at
37°C. After a wash cycle to remove unbound antibody, the secondary conjugate
containing phycoerythrin conjugated murine monoclonal anti-human IgG and
phycoerythrin conjugated murine monoclonal anti-human FXIII antibody (a control)
is added and the mixture is incubated at 37°C. Excess conjugate is removed in
another wash cycle and the washed beads are re-suspended in wash buffer. The bead
mixture then passes through the detector. The identity of the assay and control beads
is determined by the fluorescence embedded in the surface of the bead and the
amount of immobilized antibody is determined by the fluorescence of the anti-IgG
reporter conjugate. The amount of immobilized analyte is determined by the median
fluorescence intensity of the phycoerythrin reporter. Raw data are calculated in
relative fluorescence intensity (RFI). The RFI is converted to U/mL using the
calibration curve established by the 6 levels of BioPlex 2200 Anti-CCP Calibrators.
Three additional dyed beads, Internal Standard Bead (ISB), Serum Verification Bead
(SVB) and Reagent Blank Bead (RBB) are present in each reaction mixture to verify
detector response, the addition of serum or plasma to the reaction and the absence of
significant non-specific binding.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Separate CLSI EP5-A2 and EP15-A2 reproducibility studies were conducted
to evaluate the performance of the BioPlex2200 Anti-CCP kit on the
BioPlex2200 Instrument. Results from the CLSI EP5-A2 study are shown
below. Multiple lots of the peptide antigen are tested to ensure consistency of
the product. To immobilize CCP, streptavidin is covalently coupled to the
bead surface using carbodiimide chemistry, and then biotinylated CCP is
immobilized to the streptavidin surface. Evaluation of a well-characterized
sample panel is employed as a functional test to verify the integrity of the
CCP antigen and functional utility of the coupled bed. Several lots of
biotinylated CCP were evaluated in order to ensure that the functionality and
stability criteria in the development phase were met consistently. An internal
reproducibility study was also performed using four development lots in order
to evaluate within run, between run, and total variation of the assay. Patient
samples were evaluated in 10 and 21 replicates, respectively, on three
instruments twice per day. Results are within acceptance criteria.
Per CLSI EP5-A2, three serum and plasma (EDTA and heparinized) panels
composed of 10 samples each spanning the measuring range were assayed in
replicate twice daily over 20 days (n=80). One positive and one negative
control were included. The data were analyzed for within-run, between-run,

U/mL were tested to evaluate linearity. These samples were diluted six times
with immunodepleted serum per CLSI EP06-A. Each sample and dilution
was evaluated in quadruplicate using one anti-CCP IgG lot on one instrument.
Linear and polynomial regression analyses of anti-CCP IgG recovery U/mL
vs. sample dilution were performed to determine if the dilution curves exhibit
statistically significant non-linearity. The regression parameters of the
observed values vs. predicted values are shown below for three of the samples
within the reportable range. The BioPlex 2200 Anti-CCP IgG assay
demonstrated linearity from 0 to 300 U/mL.

The BioPlex 2200 system also offers an on-board dilution feature for testing
over-range samples. The dilution prior to analysis was evaluated for 1:4, 1:10
and 1:100. Three different high positive anti-CCP samples for each dilution
feature were also diluted manually to compare to onboard dilution by the
BioPlex 2200. All samples were assayed in replicates of ten. Results for
samples diluted onboard the BioPlex 2200 were displayed as the sample result
multiplied by the dilution factor. Recovery of samples diluted onboard must
be within ±20% of that of the same sample diluted manually and precision
(U/mL CV) must be ≤ 10%.
The results below indicated that the onboard sample dilution feature of the
BioPlex 2200 system can be used to dilute over-range samples 1:4, 1:10 or
1:100 for the anti-CCP assay. Onboard values shown are the reported values

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
No international or certified reference material for anti-CCP IgG is available.
The BioPlex 2200 Anti-CCP Calibrators are assigned relative units from
predicate Axis-Shield DIASTAT Anti-CCP Calibrators. BioPlex 2200 Anti-
CCP Calibrators are prepared by blending defibrinated and delipidated human
plasma units with known anti-CCP IgG activity in a processed human serum
matrix made from immunodepleted, defibrinated plasma. These calibrators
are used to assay characterize patient samples with the BioPlex 2200 Anti-
CCP IgG assay. Calibrator assignment is established from replicate analyses
on multiple BioPlex 2200 instruments using a master set of calibrators and a
specific lot of BioPlex 2200 Anti-CCP IgG Reagent Pack.
Both Negative and Positive Controls were made in a human serum matrix
from defibrinated plasma. All antibodies are derived from human disease
state plasma. The value assignment of the Control Set is derived by testing
each control on three BioPlex 2200 Analyzers with at least two kit lots. For
each control level, three vials are tested in replicates of five using each of the
kit lots and each analyzer. This testing is performed on three analyzers for a
total of 45 replicates per reagent lot. The total number of replicates for each
control level is 90 when two reagent lots are used and 135 when three reagent
lots are used. The mean value of the control is calculated using data from all
reagent lots, and the sponsor’s acceptable range of ±15% is based on the inter-
assay precision specification of 15%.
Stability
Stability studies have been performed to determine the open vial and shelf life
stability for the Control and Calibrator Sets. The claims are as follows:
Open vial stability, 60 days from first opening
Shelf life stability, 24 months
Real-time stability, 9 months (current data support 9 months but testing will

Accelerated stability, 2.5 years (current data support 2.5 years but testing will
continue until all calibrator and control levels have been monitored for 30
months)
Real time and on-board kit stability of the BioPlex Anti-CCP Kit were also
conducted. The minimum real-time stability specification for the kit is one
year from the date of the manufacture, and the minimum on-board stability is
30 days.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Detection (LoD) of BioPlex 2200 Anti-CCP was determined by
assaying low positive, high negative, and blank samples in replicates of 50.
The LoD was calculated according to CLSI EP17-A. The samples were
prepared from an anti-CCP low positive control which was then diluted in
25% increments in negative serum (IgG depleted) to a concentration level
from 4.02 to 0.04 U/mL. Each dilution was assayed daily in replicates of ten
for a period of five days. The calculated LoD for the anti-CCP IgG assay is
0.2 U/mL by using the equation LoD = LoB + cBSDs. The LoB (0.0000) was
calculated at the 95th percentile of 50 negative samples. cB is the 95th
percentile of the standard Gaussian distribution with a correction factor
applied to account for the biased estimate of the population standard
deviation.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interfering Substances:
An interfering substances study was conducted to evaluate the potential
interference of specific endogenous and exogenous substances with the
BioPlex 2200 Anti-CCP assay according to CLSI EP7-A2. Samples were
prepared by blending a pool of negative human serum with samples positive
for CCP IgG to achieve low positive values of 5.0 to 15.0 U/mL. Test and
control samples were evaluated in alternating order in replicates of five each.
This sequence was repeated twice for a total of ten replicates per interferent.
Substances are considered interfering if their presence in a sample results in
more than ±20% deviation in quantitation relative to the value determined in
the absence of the substance. No interference was observed with any of the
substances tested. The substances and the maximum levels tested are shown
in the table below:

Cross-Reactivity:
A cross-reactivity study was performed to determine if samples from various
disease states and other potentially interfering factors interfere with test results
from the BioPlex 2200 Anti-CCP kit. Samples known to be positive for one of
the potential cross reactants listed in the table below were evaluated with the
BioPlex 2200 Anti-CCP assay.
A total of 163 ANA samples and 72 other samples containing potential cross
reactants were evaluated by the BioPlex Anti-CCP. The following table
summarizes the potential percent cross reactivity rate of the BioPlex 2200 Anti-
CCP kit. Of the 163 ANA samples, some samples contained more than one
analyte such as dsDNA, Chromatin, Scl-70, Sm, Centromere B, SmRNP, RiboP,
SS-B, SS-A, RNP, and Jo-1.
Possible cross reactivity at 11% was observed with ANA samples, inclusive of all
analytes. More specifically, Centromere B (23%) and SS-A (12%) appear to have
the highest potential cross reactivity rates. Samples containing Myeloma IgG
may also cross react with the BioPlex 2200 Anti-CCP kit (30%).

f. Assay cut-off:
The cutoff value and assignment of the calibrators are determined by
performing concordance testing and Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC)
analysis, using predicate results as the standard.
A total of 1394 patient samples including 177 normal patients, 504 patients
with either Rheumatoid Factor (RF) tested or positive, 82 older patients (age
>70), 287 Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) diagnosed patients and 344 non-RA
patients were evaluated to determine the anti-CCP IgG assay cutoff. All
samples were confirmed positive or negative by the Axis-Shield DIASTAT
anti-CCP predicate assay. A cutoff of 3.0 U/mL was obtained to achieve the
percent positive and negative agreement at 92.9% and 98.2%, respectively.
These patient samples were not reused for any other study.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Performance of the BioPlex 2200 Anti-CCP kit was evaluated against

b. Matrix comparison:
Testing for matrix effects was conducted in accordance with CLSI EP9-A2.
Forty-one matched sets of serum and plasma (EDTA and heparin) samples
drawn from the same donor were acquired from commercial sources. The
matched sets were spiked with high positive anti-CCP IgG serum in order to
cover the measuring range of the assay from 0.5 to 300 U/mL. All samples
were evaluated in replicates of two. Plasma U/mL values were compared to
matched serum U/mL values. Scatter plots comparing the performance of
EDTA and heparin plasma samples against serum samples along with the
corresponding slopes of regression and coefficient of determination (r2) are
shown below comparing the first replicate values only.
