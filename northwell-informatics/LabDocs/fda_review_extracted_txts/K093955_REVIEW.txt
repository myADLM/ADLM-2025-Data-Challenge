I. Device Description:
The Roche Elecsys Anti-HAV IgM immunoassay is the electrochemi-
luminescence immunoassay “ECLIA” intended for use on Elecsys and cobas e
immunoassay analyzers. Samples are pretreated with anti-Fdγ reagent to block
specific IgG in the presence of monoclonal anti-HAV antibodies labeled with
ruthenium complex. After addition of biotinylated monoclonal h-IgM-specific
antibodies, HAV antigen, and streptavidin-coated microparticles in the second
incubation step, the anti-HAV IgM antibodies present in the sample form a
sandwich complex with the HAV antigen and the ruthenium-labeled anti-HAV
antibody which becomes bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and
streptavidine. The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the
microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode, and
unbound substances are then removed with ProCell. Voltage application to the
electrode induces chemiluminescent emission, which is then measured by a
photomultiplier. Results are determined automatically by the Elecsys and cobas e
software by comparing the electrochemiluminescence signal obtained from the
reaction product of the sample with the signal of the cutoff value previously
obtained by anti-HAV IgM calibration.

L. Test Principle:
The Elecsys Anti-HAV IgM immunoassay utilizes a μ-capture test concept based on a
monoclonal h-IgM directed biotinylated antibody, cell culture derived Hepatitis A
Virus and a ruthenylated monoclonal antibody directed to HAV. Capture of formed
immune complexes from the reaction mixture is based on biotin binding to
streptavidin-coated magnetic microparticles which are collected on a measuring cell
electrode. Signal generation is triggered by the application of a voltage to the
electrode (electrochemiluminescence technology). The level of signal count detected
by the system increases as the concentration of the IgM antibody target present in a
patient sample increases.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision and Reproducibility was determined using Elecsys reagents, human
sera, and controls. Precision studies were performed at one internal site on the
Elecsys 2010 and cobas e 411 and Modular Analytics E170 and cobas e 601
analyzers using a single lot of reagents. PreciControls AHAVIGM 1 and 2 (PC1
and PC2) materials and three human serum pools (high negative HSP3, low
positive HSP1 and moderately positive HSP2) were tested in replicates of 2 in 2
runs/day for 20 days for intermediate and repeatability precision according to the
CLSI EP15-A2/EP5-A2. Precision results are presented below.
Reproducibility was performed at three external sites on three different Elecsys
2010 as well as on three Modular Analytics E170 analyzers. Three human serum
pools (high negative HSP3, low positive HSP1 and moderately positive HSP2)
were tested in replicates of 3 in 2 runs/day for 5 days according to the CLSI
EP15-A2/EP5-A2.

Samples:
Sample stability was determined using different sample materials e.g., Serum,
Serum with separating gel, K -EDTA,- Li-Heparin,- Na-Heparin and Na-Citrate
2
Plasma. Three negative, three low positive, and one positive samples were tested and
compared with fresh reference materials. The potential influence of different
frozen human samples after storage at -20°C for 3 months was evaluated and
showed satisfactory recovery. Similarly, studies of 5 freeze thaw cycles,
sample stability for 7 days at 2-8°C, and sample stability at 25°C for 2 hours
resulted in satisfactory recovery within the specified acceptance criteria.
d. Detection limits:
Limit of detection (LoD) of the Elecsys® Anti-HAV IgM assay was
determined according to CLSI EP17-A. The LoD was determined as the
lowest amount of analyte in a sample that can be detected with 95%
probability. The distribution of values for five low-level human serum
samples has been determined on two Elecsys® 2010 Analyzers over 3 days, 2
runs per day. Samples were measured in one-fold determination in each run.
In summary, 30 measuring points were collected per instrument.
LOD = LOB + 1.6529 x SD (of low analyte samples)
total
LOD was determined to be 0.268 COI, and is reported in the labeling as 0.4
COI.
Limit of Blank (LoB) of the Elecsys® Anti-HAV IgM assay was determined
according to CLSI EP17-A. Limit of Blank determines the highest observed
measurement values for samples free of analyte. The LoB was determined as
the 95th percentile of measurements of blank samples. The distribution of
values for five zero-level human serum and plasma samples has been
determined on two Elecsys® 2010 Analyzers over 3 days, 2 runs per day. The
LoB claim in the package insert will be set to 0.3 COI.
Calibrators: Range for the electrochemiluminescence signals (counts) for the
calibrators:
Negative calibrator (Cal1): 100 - 2000 (Elecsys 2010, MODULAR
ANALYTICS E170 and cobas e analyzers).
Positive calibrator (Cal2): 5000 - 30000 (Elecsys 2010, MODULAR

Elecsys® 2010 Immunoassay Analyzer.
The assay is unaffected by icterus (bilirubin < 855 µmol/L or < 50 mg/dL),
hemolysis (Hb < 0.623 mmol/L or < 1.0 g/dL), lipemia (Intralipid
< 2000 mg/dL), and biotin < 205 nmol/L or < 50 ng/mL. Serum pools (high
negative, low positive, and high positive) were used to spike with the
intereferent. One aliquot of each serum sample was spiked with the interfering
substance, another aliquot was spiked with the same volume of isotonic NaCl
solution (dilution pool). The interfering pool was then diluted into the dilution
pool in 10% increments. The % recovery (COI) was determined by dividing the
mean value of the measured concentration by the expected concentration.
Criterion: Recovery of positive samples within ± 20 % of initial value.
In patients receiving therapy with high biotin doses (i.e. > 5 mg/day), no
sample should be taken until at least 8 hours after the last biotin
administration.
In vitro tests were performed on 18 commonly used pharmaceuticals

No interference with the assay was found.
f. Assay cut-off: The cutoff for the Elecsys anti-HAV IgM assay was initially
established by measuring a total of 1004 samples including 575 negative from
post acute, dialysis, hospitalized, routine samples with request for anti-HAV-
IgM testing, samples from blood donors and 429 positive samples from
seroconverters < 90 days (commercial sources), HAV follow ups after
infection < 90 days and samples suspected for HAV- obtained from several
European sites. The distribution of positive, equivocal and negative results
was compared with the predicate assay AxSym HAV AB M-2.0 and the
cutoffs were set as noted below. The result of a sample is given in the form of
a cutoff index (signal sample/cutoff). Results obtained with the Elecsys
Rubella IgM assay can be interpreted as follows:
Non-reactive: ≥ 0.90 COI; Border: ≥ 0.90 - < 1.10 COI; Reactive: ≥ 1.0 COI
Samples with a COI < 0.90 are considered non-reactive in the Elecsys Anti-
HAV IgM assay and no further testing is necessary. Samples with a COI ≥
1.10 are considered reactive in the Elecsys Anti-HAV IgM assay. Samples
with a COI between 0.90 and < 1.10 are considered border (borderline). The
sample should be retested in duplicate.
• If 2 of the 3 results have a COI < 0.90, the result is interpreted as non-
reactive and no further testing is necessary.
10

--- Page 11 ---
• If 2 of the 3 results have a COI between 0.90 and < 1.10, the result is
interpreted as borderline. It is recommended that a specimen be drawn in
two weeks and retested.
• If 2 of the 3 results have a COI ≥ 1.10, the result is interpreted as reactive.
Calculation
The analyzer automatically calculates the cutoff based on the measurement of Cal1 and
Cal2.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The performance of the Elecsys anti-HAV IgM assay was determined by
percent agreement among negative samples and percent agreement among
positive samples, against a consensus comparator method, in specific
populations. The main predicate (Abbott AxSym HAV AB-M 2.0) was used
as sole comparator/reference.
b. Matrix comparison:
The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of anticoagulants with the
Elecsys® Anti-HAV IgM Immunoassay was determined on Elecsys® 2010
Immunoassay Analyzer by comparing values obtained from native samples
(single donors) drawn into Serum, Li- and Na-Heparin Plasma, Citrate- and K -
2
EDTA plasma and Serum-gel primary tubes. Reference for all sample types was
serum drawn into Serum primary tubes (without Gel).
Acceptance criterion for single pairs are:
• Samples ≤ 0.5 COI: recovery ± 0.3 COI
• Samples > 0.5 COI: recovery 80-120 %

Clinical Performance
Clinical Study Cohorts:
A multi-center study was conducted in the U.S. to characterize the
performance of the Elecsys Anti-HAV IgM immunoassay. All subjects were
tested with the Elecsys Anti-HAV IgM assay on the Elecsys 2010 analyzer
and with an FDA-cleared reference method in strict accordance with the
manufacturer’s package insert instructions.
A total of 1087 samples were obtained from multiple specimen sources,
representing subjects for whom routine hepatitis A testing had been ordered,
hospitalized patients, subjects at increased risk for hepatitis, subjects with
signs and symptoms of hepatitis, subjects characterized with acute hepatitis A,
and subjects below the age of 21 years (pediatric/adolescents). All samples
(prospective and retrospective) are stored frozen before shipment to Roche
and to the respective sites for testing.

the fifteen non-reactive and reactive concordant specimens that were also tested.
Prevalence Studies:
The Elecsys Anti-HAV IgM assay was used to evaluate the prevalence of HAV
IgM antibodies in an apparently healthy population (normal, healthy individuals
without symptoms). The prospective study population for the Elecsys Anti-HAV
IgM assay consisted of 602 patients. Of these 602 patients, 300 patients were
from the high prevalence region, Western states of the U.S. (New Mexico) and
302 patients were from the low risk region Eastern states of the U.S. (Indiana).
The prospective study population was 208 (34.6 %) males and 394 (65.4 %)
females (total n = 602) including 493 (81.9 %) Caucasian + 32 (5.3 %) African
American + 6 (1.0 %) Asian + 69 (11.5 %) American Indian + 2 (0.3 %). The
results of prevalence population are summarized according to age groups in
decades, gender, geographical area and the number of reactive, non-reactive and
equivocal results.

HAV Vaccination:
Fifty-four non-HAV-vaccinated, anti-HAV total non-reactive subjects
were immunized with three Hepatitis A vaccines approved for use in the United
States. Vaccine was randomly assigned to subjects as they enrolled: 20 for
HAVRIX, 18 for TWINRIX and 16 for VAQTA. Two vaccination studies are
represented: one conducted in the Eastern region of the US and the other in
Penzberg Germany. Concordant assay results were obtained with all pre- and
post-vaccination specimens. There was no IgM response observed in post-

equivocal/borderline and just reactive (repeat testing generated equivocal/
borderline results), respectively.
Seroconversion Sensitivity:
Seroconversion sensitivity of the Elecsys anti-HAV IgM assay was shown by
testing 3 seroconversion panels in comparison to that of the comparator assay
(Abbott AxSym HAV AB-M 2.0). Seroconversion panel results were also
compared with the data provided by the vendor for the Abbott HAV AB-M 2.0
assay. The results are summarized in the following table:

The panel was not tested with the reference assay (AxSym HAV AB-M 2.0) due to the limited sample
volume.
Method Comparison studies on two instruments:
The method comparison for the Elecsys anti-HAV IgM assay between the two
platforms E2010 and E170 was demonstrated by testing the prevalence and other
clinical cohort specimens on three external MODULAR Analytics E170 and
cobas e 601modules and three external Elecsys 2010 and cobas e 411 analyzers.
There were a total of 602 specimens from the Prevalence cohort and 1084
specimens from the clinical cohorts which had evaluable results from both
instruments. The samples were distributed across the six analyzers such that each
sample was analyzed on one E170 and one E2010. The regression analyses for
the comparisons using the prevalence cohort and the combined clinical cohorts
were carried out using the least squares and Passing-Bablok regression methods.
Prevalence: The Pearson’s regression correlation for the 602 data pairs from the
Prevalence cohort was 0.9935. The Positive percent agreement was 1/1 = 100.0
(95% Exact confidence limits of 2.50 to 100.0). The Negative percent agreement

Clinical Cohort: The Pearson’s regression correlation for the 1084 data pairs
from the non-prevalence clinical cohorts was 0.9925. Positive percent agreement
was 123/126 = 97.62 (95% Exact confidence limits of 93.20 to 99.51). Negative
percent agreement was 957/958 = 99.90 (95% Exact confidence limits of 99.42 to

4. Clinical cut-off:
Refer to assay cutoff section above for the additional details. There are no
Internationally Standards for anti-HAV IgM.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The Elecsys anti-HAV IgM assay was used to evaluate the prevalence of HAV
IgM antibodies in an apparently healthy population (normal, healthy
individuals without symptoms). A statistically significant number of subjects
were prospectively collected in a “high prevalence” region, the Western states,
and a “low prevalence” region, the Eastern states and were tested using only the
Elecsys anti-HAV IgM assay and were not compared with the predicate device.
Expected Results from low and high Prevalence based on the test device are
presented under the prevalence study section. Prevalence rate for reactive anti-
HAV IgM antibody in specimens collected in a high prevalence region, Western
states of the US (New Mexico), was 0.33 %. Prevalence rate for reactive anti-
HAV IgM antibody in specimens collected in a low prevalence region, Eastern
states of the US (Indiana), was 0.00 %.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
