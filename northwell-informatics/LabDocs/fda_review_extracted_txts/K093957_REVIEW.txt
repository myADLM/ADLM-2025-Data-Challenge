L. Test Principle:
The ARCHITECT HE4 assay is a two-step immunoassay for the quantitative
determination of HE4 antigen in human serum using chemiluminescent microparticle
immunoassay (CMIA) technology with flexible assay protocols, referred to as Chemiflex.
In the first step, sample and anti-HE4 coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined.
HE4 antigen present in the sample binds to the anti-HE4 coated microparticles. After
washing, acridinium-labeled anti-HE4 conjugate is added. Following another wash cycle,
pre-trigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting
chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). A direct
relationship exists between the amount of HE4 antigen in the sample and the RLUs
detected by the ARCHITECT i System optics.
The ARCHITECT HE4 Calibrators are for the calibration of the ARCHITECT i System
when used for the quantitative determination of HE4 antigen in human serum. The
ARCHITECT HE4 Controls are used for the verification of the accuracy and precision of
the ARCHITECT i System when used for the quantitative determination of HE4 antigen
in human serum.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the ARCHITECT HE4 assay was assessed at three (3) different
sites. These studies were modeled after CLSI guideline EP5-A2 (“Evaluation of
Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved
Guideline – Second Edition, 2004”). At each site, 2 lots of reagent kit, calibrator
kit, and control kit were utilized. At one site and 1 lot, the ARCHITECT i2000
instrument system was used while the other sites used the ARCHITECT i2000
SR
instrument system. Only the ARCHITECT i2000 System data will be used to
SR
communicate performance claims in the proposed ARCHITECT HE4 package
insert.
Six samples were tested in 2 replicates using 2 lots of reagents, at 2 separate runs
per day, for 20 days (not necessarily consecutive) on 1 ARCHITECT i2000
SR
System or 1 ARCHITECT i2000 System. A single calibration curve was used
throughout the study. The kit controls were tested and evaluated for each run to
determine assay validity. The 6 samples were the following:
Panel 1: pooled human serum - HE4 concentration is approximately 40 pmol/L
Page 4 of 40

--- Page 5 ---
K093957 Decision Summary
Panel 2: pooled human serum spiked with native HE4 antigen - HE4
concentration is approximately 200 pmol/L
Panel 3: pooled human serum spiked with recombinant HE4 Antigen (kit
Calibrator/Control antigen) - HE4 concentration is approximately 1000 pmol/L
Low Control: recombinant HE4 Antigen spiked into PBS buffer with a protein
(bovine) stabilizer - HE4 concentration is approximately 50 pmol/L
Medium Control: recombinant HE4 Antigen spiked into PBS buffer with a protein
(bovine) stabilizer - HE4 concentration is approximately 175 pmol/L
High Control: recombinant HE4 Antigen spiked into PBS buffer with a protein
(bovine) stabilizer - HE4 concentration is approximately 700 pmol/L
Human pool 1 was a specimen containing HE4 concentration levels that could be
deemed as natural. However, it is difficult to obtain samples at higher HE4
concentration levels due to the infrequent prevalence of ovarian cancer in young
healthy women. So the use of spiked samples is sufficient.
Within-run, between-run, between-day, and total imprecision, expressed as
standard deviation and %coefficient of variation (%CV) for both lots and for each
lot separately, was calculated. The following table summarizes data for both
combined lots:

The upper 95% confidence limit for total imprecision for all samples is less than or
equal to 6.1%CV. The ARCHITECT HE4 assay meets the predetermined acceptance
criteria of ≤ 10% total CV.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The assay measures concentrations between 20 and 1500 pM. To assess the
linearity of the assay in the reportable range, CLSI guidance EP6-A, entitled
“Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A
Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline”, was used to design the linearity
experiment. Four concentration levels ranging from 200 to 1500 pmol/L were
prepared from a panel of ovarian cancer patients prior to dilution. A fifth panel
was prepared from normal female serum supplemented with native HE4 (derived
from cell culture). A series of 10 dilutions was prepared from these 5 starting
pools. The un-diluted and diluted series were tested in 4 replicates using the assay
on the ARCHITECT i2000 System. A single calibration curve was used
SR
throughout the study. The assay kit controls were tested and evaluated for each
run to determine assay validity. The expected concentration value at each dilution

K093957 Decision Summary
was calculated for each sample using the dilution factor and the initial
concentration of the undiluted sample pool. The mean observed HE4
concentration of 4 replicates at each dilution was calculated from the assay
results. A polynomial regression analysis of observed and expected HE4
concentration was performed for first-, second-, and third-order polynomials
using a weighted regression method. If the non-linear coefficients of the second or
third order polynomial are statistically significant then the deviation from linearity
was investigated. For 2 of the 5 specimen pools, significant non-linearity was
observed. Deviation from linearity was investigated. The assay met the bias
allowance for deviation from linearity defined as ± 10% for concentration levels
above 20 pmol/L and ± 2 pmol/L for samples at or below 20 pmol/L. The assay
meets the requirements of the CLSI Guideline EP6A for linearity from 20 to 1500
pmol/L.
Analysis of the sponsor’s data was performed without using weighted regression
analysis. For all specimen pools with expected HE4 concentrations ranging from
20 pmol/L to 1400 pmol/L, the second and third order polynomials were
significant. The deviation from linearity, expressed as a percentage deviation of
the non-linear model, for all samples ranged from -2.9% to 7.3% deviation from
linearity. The mean percentage deviation from linearity compared with the
expected HE4 concentration was -0.043%. The deviation from linearity met the
sponsor’s specification of ± 10% for HE4 concentrations above 20 pmol/L. The
following graph illustrates this analysis.

linearity. The graph shows that the individual datapoints of the dilution series of
all 5 specimen pools, though not statistically linear, are sufficiently close to the
line of linearity and the sponsor’s specification for deviation from linearity. The
data is acceptable and indicates sufficient linearity in the assay range of 20 to
1500 pmol/L.
High Sample Dilution Study
To evaluate the recommended dilution procedure of 1:10 for out of range samples
(1500 – 15,000 pmol/L) as described in the package insert for the assay,
recombinant HE4 antigen was added to 6 serum samples to create out-of-range
conditions. The final HE4 concentrations before automatic dilution were
approximately 2100, 4300, 6500, 8600, 10,800, and 14,000 pmol/L. The expected
value for each sample was determined from the concentration and volume of HE4
antigen added and the endogenous concentration and volume of serum sample.
Samples were tested undiluted and diluted using the auto-dilution function (1:10
dilution) on the ARCHITECT i2000 instrument in 2 replicates. A single
SR
calibration curve was used throughout the study. The kit Controls were tested and
evaluated for each run to determine assay validity. The mean concentration value
was calculated for each sample. The percent recovery of observed HE4
concentration relative to the expected concentration was calculated. The mean
recoveries for the six (6) individual samples ranged from 91 to 106%. The mean
percent recovery for samples was 99%. The assay meets the predetermined
acceptance criteria of 100 ± 15% for individual sample recoveries and 100 ± 10%
for the mean recovery of all samples.
There is a slight proportional bias in observed HE4 and Expected HE4 for the
samples tested. %recovery increased with increasing expected HE4
concentrations, though the mean %recovery is within the acceptance criteria.
From the data it is possible to calculate the %bias between observed and expected
HE4 concentration. The %recoveries and calculated %bias are as follows:
Measured Measured
Expected Value Value x 10 Percent

High Dose hook effect
To determine the effect of extreme levels of analyte in the assay, one pooled
serum sample (un-spiked) and two normal sera were supplemented with
recombinant HE4 antigen. These samples were then serially diluted in Wash
Buffer such that one or more of the dilutions fell within the reportable range of
the assay but above the B calibrator (30 pmol/L). All samples were run in 2

replicates using the assay on the ARCHITECT i2000 System. A single
SR
calibration curve was used throughout the study. The kit controls were tested and
evaluated for each run to determine assay validity. The instrument response
values (i.e., Relative Light Units) of the neat and diluted samples were plotted
against their respective calculated HE4 value. For each sample and its
corresponding dilutions, the calculated HE4 value was determined by multiplying
the mean value of the samples by their respective dilution factor when the HE4
concentration was within the range of the assay. The values of sample dilutions
within the standard curve but above the B calibrator were used to calculate the
neat sample concentration.
The results are graphically summarized by the sponsor as follows:
The data in the figure shows that increasing levels of analyte increases the
response of the assay to a plateau level of approximately 2,000,000 RLU’s. The
RLU values of the samples did not diminish with increasing antigen concentration
as would be expected with high dose hook (prozone) effect but maintained a
response level in excess of the RLU value of the F Calibrator.

There is currently no known internationally recognized consensus reference
method or reference material for standardization. Calibrator value is related to a
sponsor maintained reference preparation. The calibrators are manufactured
volumetrically and are referenced to this standard. HE4 assay values are
expressed as pmol/L.
The material used to standardize the assay is recombinant Ig-HE4 fusion protein
consisting of a Human Fc antibody fragment and Human Epidydimis protein
(HE4). The material was produced in a stably transfected Chinese Hamster Ovary
(CHO) cell line. The cell line was grown in serum free medium. The cell culture
supernatant was purified by Protein A affinity chromatography. The concentration
of the resulting material was determined by MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry
This material is the primary source material from which secondary and bulk kit
calibrators are prepared. Bulk testing is performed by measuring the Relative
Light Unit (RLU) of each calibrator as compared to the RLU of the reference
calibrators when tested on the ARCHITECT System. When the bulk calibrators
are within specifications, they are aseptically filtered and filled into their final
containers. Quality Control testing of the filled calibrators as bottled components
is performed followed by finished goods testing of the packed Calibrator Kit
using packaged Reagent Kits. The calibrator curve and controls must meet
predetermined acceptance criteria.
Kit controls
The control kit contains 3 Bottles (8.0 mL each) of ARCHITECT HE4 Controls.
The Low, Medium, and High Controls are prepared in PBS buffer with a protein
(bovine) stabilizer. Preservative: ProClin 300. The controls are at the following
concentrations:
Control Target Range
Concentration
(pmol/L)
Low 50 35-65
Medium 175 122.5 – 227.5
High 700 490 – 910
The Controls are prepared by adding HE4 Antigen to a diluent to achieve the
desired concentrations. After passing Quality Control testing the bulk material is
then used to prepare the Low, Medium and High Controls. Each control is
prepared by diluting the bulk material with the diluent. After mixing and
equilibration, the controls are tested by measuring the RLU of each control as
compared to the RLU of the reference controls. Adjustments are made if
necessary. When the bulk controls are within specifications, they are aseptically
filtered and filled into their final containers. Quality Control testing of the filled

ARCHITECT HE4 Calibrator and Control Stability Studies
A study was conducted to evaluate the stability of the ARCHITECT HE4
Calibrator and Control Kits when all bottled components are manually opened
and closed. The study was performed to support the package insert claim
instructing the end user to tightly close the caps on the bottles after each use and
return to 2-8°C storage. The stability studies for the ARCHITECT HE4 Calibrator
and Control material are performed in compliance to the CEN standard, 13640 –
Stability Testing of In Vitro Diagnostic Reagents. Three (3) lots of kit Calibrators
and Controls were set up for the study. Sufficient kit Calibrators and Controls are
stored at 2-8°C and used to evaluate three (3) panels, described below, at monthly
time points. All of the bottles were opened and closed at time 0. One calibrator lot
is stored inverted. The panels (Panel 1, Panel 2, and Panel 3) consist of 3 HE4
concentrations spanning the calibration range of the Assay. The Panels are pooled
serum samples containing either recombinant or native HE4 antigen. The Panels
are stored at ≤ -60°C. At time zero and each subsequent time point the following
run was or will be performed:
Run 1 – A calibration curve using calibrators in duplicate with 1 replicate of
HE4 controls and 2 replicates of samples from panels.
Run 2 – HE4 controls in single replicates and panels in 2 replicates.
At each time point, all runs are required to meet predetermined acceptance criteria
for the calibration curve, control recovery, and panel recovery. Intended storage
data currently supports 9 months dating for kit Calibrators and Controls. This
study is ongoing and will be supplemented with additional timepoints.
Sample stability - fresh serum samples
A study was conducted to determine the stability of HE4 antigen in fresh serum
samples stored at 2-8°C. Serum samples from 10 healthy volunteers were
collected. The samples were stored continuously at 2-8°C. Each sample was

i2000 System and tested at Day 0 (within 8 hours of draw), Day 2, Day 3, Day
SR
4, and Day 5. A single calibration curve was used throughout the study. The
ARCHITECT HE4 Controls were tested and evaluated for each run to determine
assay validity. The mean concentration obtained from the 2 replicates of each
sample tested at Day 2, Day 3, Day 4, and Day 5 was compared to the
corresponding mean concentration at Day 0 (control).
The mean of daily percent recoveries across the 10 samples was within 100 ±
10% for the study period. As a result, the ARCHITECT HE4 assay meets the
predetermined acceptance criteria of 100 ± 10% of Day 0 value for the daily mean
and supports the package insert sample storage claim of up to 4 days at 2-8°C.

Sample Stability – Frozen samples
A study was conducted to determine the stability of HE4 antigen in frozen serum
samples. Serum samples from 11 healthy volunteers were collected. Each sample
was aliquoted into a minimum of 4 tubes and frozen at ≤ -10°C. One (1)
fresh/unfrozen aliquot was retained as the control (Day 0). The Day 0 control was
tested 3 in replicates using the ARCHITECT HE4 assay on 1 ARCHITECT
i2000 System within 8 hours of draw. The remaining aliquots were stored
SR
continuously at ≤ -10°C and tested in 3 replicates using the ARCHITECT HE4
assay on the same ARCHITECT i2000 System at Day 4 and Day 5. A single
SR
calibration curve was used throughout the study. The ARCHITECT HE4 Controls
were tested and evaluated for each run to determine assay validity. The mean
concentration obtained from the 3 replicates of each sample tested at Day 4 and
Day 5 was compared to the corresponding mean concentration at Day 0 (control).
All samples recovered within 100 +/-15% of Day 0 on Day 4, 5, 6, and 7. Testing
supports the package insert recommendations.
Sample Stability - Room Temperature Sample
A study was conducted to characterize the stability of HE4 antigen in fresh serum
samples at room temperature and to support the ARCHITECT HE4 package insert
claim for room temperature storage. Serum samples from 10 healthy volunteers
were collected. Each sample was tested in 2 replicates using the ARCHITECT
HE4 assay on the ARCHITECT i2000 System. The samples were stored
SR
continuously at 25 ± 2°C and run at Time 0 (within 8 hours of draw), 24 ± 2 hours
and 48 ± 2 hours. A single calibration curve was used throughout the study. The
ARCHITECT HE4 Controls were tested and evaluated for each run to determine
assay validity. The mean concentration obtained from the 2 replicates of each
sample tested at Time 0 (control) was compared to the corresponding mean
concentration at 24 hours and 48 hours.
The range of percent recoveries for each individual sample was between 97% -
113% for 24 hours and 97% - 114% for 48 hours. The percent recovery for the
mean of all samples was 105% for 24 hours and 106% for 48 hours. As a result,
the ARCHITECT HE4 assay meets the predetermined acceptance criteria of 100
± 10% of Time 0 value and supports the package insert sample storage claim of
up to 24 hours at room temperature.
Sample Stability - Freeze / Thaw
A study was conducted to determine the effects of multiple freeze/thaw cycles on
serum samples analyzed with the ARCHITECT HE4 assay. Twelve (12) fresh
(less than 36 hours from the time of the draw) serum samples were spiked with
native HE4 antigen to values between 125 and 1100 pmol/L and used for this
study. Each sample was aliquoted into 12 tubes. One aliquot was retained as the
unfrozen control and the remaining aliquots were subjected to repeated
freeze/thaw cycles. The samples were frozen at ≤ -20°C for a minimum of 30
minutes followed by thawing them at room temperature. At the end of each cycle
one vial from each set was removed and stored at 2-8°C until the assay was ready

K093957 Decision Summary
to run. A total of ten (10) freeze/thaw cycles were completed for each serum
sample. For each aliquot, the control and the test sample sets were tested in 2
replicates using the ARCHITECT HE4 assay on the ARCHITECT i2000
SR
System. A single calibration curve was used throughout the study. The
ARCHITECT HE4 Controls were tested and evaluated for each run to determine
assay validity. The recovery of the cycle was determined by comparing the mean
test sample value tested against the unfrozen control sample mean value.
The average recovery per cycle for the 12 samples ranged from 93% to 128%.
The percent recoveries for individual results were within +/-15% of the unfrozen
control through cycle 6. The data supports a conclusion that samples can be
frozen and thawed six (6) times for the ARCHITECT HE4 assay without
compromising the assay.
d. Detection limit:
To characterize the Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of
Quantitation (LoQ) of the ARCHITECT HE4 assay, an experimental protocol was
utilized modeled after CLSI guideline EP17-A (“Protocols for Determination of
Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline – 2004”).
A Low Level Sample Set was prepared by diluting 2 normal human serum
samples in kit calibrator A (0 pmol/L HE4) to obtain HE4 concentrations as
shown in the table below.

Calibrator A and Low Level Sample Set were tested in 5 replicates, once per day
for three (3) days on 2 ARCHITECT i2000 Systems with 3 kit reagent lots (N=
SR
5x3x2x3 = 90). Each of the 3 reagent lots were run on both ARCHITECT i2000
SR
Systems. One lot of kit calibrators and controls was used per instrument system.
A single calibration curve was used throughout the study. The ARCHITECT HE4
Controls were tested and evaluated for each run to determine assay validity.
To determine the Limit of Blank (LoB), the mean and standard deviation (SD)
were calculated for each of the runs of the Calibrator A. The total mean and
average SD for the Calibrator A is -0.10 ± 0.09 pmol/L. The LoB was 0.05
pmol/L based on equation: LoB = Mean + 1.645*SD .

To determine the Limit of Detection (LoD), the individual total means and SDs,

SDSample Set
To determine the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ), the mean of the differences
between the expected values and measured values was calculated for each
replicate of each member of the Low Level Sample Set to determine the total
error. The average individual biases and SDs of each member of the Low Level
Sample Set were calculated by run. The average bias and average SD for all
concentrations in the Low Level Sample set was -0.15 +/- 0.08 pmol/L. The Total
Error is 0.31 pmol/L (28% of the mean expected value) based on the following
equation: Total Error = | Bias | + 2*SD = |- 0.15| + (2 * 0.08). The LoQ claimed
S
was 0.18 pmol/L.
Since the %CV and %bias are a function of the expected concentration, the
calculated LoQ should not base on the average total error for the 4 samples. The
observed and expected HE4 concentrations with the total biases and %CV of
variation should be individually calculated for the 4 panel set. The following table
summarizes the %CV of variation for each individual expected HE4
concentration, the %bias from expected HE4 concentration, and the calculated
total allowable error for each expected HE4 concentration:

Extrapolating from the smoothed model of the total allowable error for the chosen
total error of 30%, the HE4 concentration is 1.0 pmol/L. At this HE4
concentration the observed bias of the observed HE4 concentration from the
expected concentration was -17.6% and the %CV of the observed HE4 was 7%.
Therefore, the LoQ estimate is 1 pmol/L with 30% total allowable error. This
value is less than the acceptance criteria (< 20 pmol/L).
The LoD (0.2 pmol/L), and LoQ (1.0 pmol/L) meet the sponsor predetermined
acceptance criteria of LoD < 15 pmol/L and LoQ < 20 pmol/L. These data support
the performance claims of the assay.

Lipid interference
To evaluate the potential interference from lipids in the assay, CLSI guideline
EP7-A (“Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry, Approved Guideline”) was
used to design the interference experiments. Six (6) human serum samples were
used in this study. The endogenous HE4 concentrations of samples 3 through 6
were augmented by the addition of HE4 antigen (recombinant) prepared from a
stock solution. Samples 1 and 2 were not spiked with additional HE4 antigen.
Each HE4 serum sample was split into 2 aliquots. One aliquot was spiked with a
lipids solution to achieve 3000 mg/dL lipid. One aliquot was spiked with an equal
volume of phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) for use as a control sample. Serum
samples were not diluted more than 20%. The control and the lipid supplemented
samples were tested in 2 replicates using the assay on the ARCHITECT i2000
SR
analyzer. A single calibration curve was used throughout the study. The kit
Controls were tested and evaluated for each run to determine assay validity. The
mean concentration obtained from the 2 replicates of each sample with the added
lipids was compared to the mean value of the corresponding control sample
without lipids to calculate the percent recovery. The average recovery was 98%

K093957 Decision Summary
ranging from 94% to 104% for samples with a 3000 mg/dL lipid concentration.
Less than 10% average interference was observed in the assay with specimens
containing an elevated level of lipids. Testing meets the predetermined acceptance
criteria of 100 ± 15% for individual sample recoveries and 100 ± 10% for the
mean recovery of all samples. These data support the performance claims of the
assay.
Bilirubin interference
Interference from bilirubin was assessed in a manner similar to lipid interference.
Twelve (12) human serum samples with HE4 values distributed across the assay
range were supplemented with bilirubin as a potential interfering substance. Each
HE4 serum sample was split into 2 aliquots. One aliquot was spiked with a
bilirubin solution (unconjugated bilirubin in 10 mM NaOH) to achieve 20 mg/dL
bilirubin. One aliquot was spiked with an equal volume of 10 mM NaOH for use
as a control sample. Serum samples were not diluted more than 5%. The control
and the bilirubin supplemented samples were tested in 2 replicates using the assay
on the ARCHITECT i2000 analyzer. A single calibration curve was used
SR
throughout the study. The kit Controls were tested and evaluated for each run to
determine assay validity. Percent recoveries were calculated as in lipid
interference evaluation. The average recovery was 98% ranging from 92% to
103% for samples with a 20 mg/dL bilirubin concentration. Less than 15%
individual interference and less than 10% average interference was observed in
the assay with specimens containing an elevated level of bilirubin. Testing meets
the predetermined acceptance criteria of 100 ± 15% for individual sample
recoveries and 100 ± 10% for the mean recovery of all samples. These data
support the performance claims of the assay.
Hemoglobin interference
Interference from hemoglobin was assessed in a manner similar to lipid
interference. Six (6) human serum samples with HE4 values distributed across the
assay range were supplemented with hemoglobin as a potential interfering
substance. Each HE4 serum sample was split into two (2) aliquots. One aliquot
was spiked with a hemoglobin solution to achieve 500 mg/dL hemoglobin. One
aliquot was spiked with an equal volume of PBS for use as a control sample.
Serum samples were not diluted more than 5%. The control and the hemoglobin
supplemented samples were tested in 2 replicates using the assay on the
ARCHITECT i2000 analyzer. A single calibration curve was used throughout
SR
the study. The kit Controls were tested and evaluated for each run to determine
assay validity. Percent recoveries were calculated as in lipid interference
evaluation. The average recovery was 108% ranging from 104% to 113% for
samples with a 500 mg/dL hemoglobin concentration. Less than 15% individual
interference and less than 10% average interference was observed in the assay
with specimens containing an elevated level of bilirubin. Testing meets the
predetermined acceptance criteria of 100 ± 15% for individual sample recoveries
and 100 ± 10% for the mean recovery of all samples. These data support the

Low and High Protein interference
Interference from high protein concentrations was assessed in a manner similar to
lipid interference. Six (6) serum samples were split into four (4) equal aliquots,
one (1) aliquot was used as the control and one (1) aliquot was used to measure
the protein concentration of the samples. Based on the measured protein
concentration for each of the six (6) serum samples, one (1) aliquot was diluted
with PBS to obtain 3 g/dL total protein, and one (1) aliquot was spiked with
human serum albumin protein to obtain 12 g/dL final protein concentration. HE4
was also supplemented to achieve different HE4 concentrations. Serum samples
were not diluted more than 5% by addition of HE4. The control and the protein
supplemented samples were tested in 2 replicates using the assay on the
ARCHITECT i2000 analyzer. A single calibration curve was used throughout
SR
the study. The kit Controls were tested and evaluated for each run to determine
assay validity. Percent recoveries were calculated as in lipid interference
evaluation. The average recovery was 103% ranging from 101% to 107% for
samples with a 3 g/dL protein concentration. The average recovery was 103%
ranging from 101% to 108% for samples with a 12 g/dL protein concentration.
Less than 15% individual interference and less than 10% average interference was
observed in the assay with specimens containing an elevated level or lowered
level of protein. Testing meets the predetermined acceptance criteria of 100 ±
15% for individual sample recoveries and 100 ± 10% for the mean recovery of all
samples. These data support the performance claims of the assay.
Human anti-mouse antibody interference
To evaluate the potential interference from Human Anti-Mouse Antibodies
(HAMA) in the assay, CLSI guideline, EP7-A was used to design the interference
experiments. Preparation of Test Samples using six (6) HAMA positive human
serum samples was as follows:
1. Each HAMA serum sample was split into three (3) equal aliquots.
2. One (1) aliquot was spiked with approximately 90 pmol/L of recombinant
HE4 antigen (spike 1) prepared from a stock solution. No sample was diluted
more than 5% through spiking of the HE4 antigen.
3. One (1) aliquot was spiked with approximately 450 pmol/L of recombinant
HE4 antigen (spike 2) prepared from a stock solution. No sample was diluted
more than 5% through spiking of the HE4 antigen.
4. One (1) aliquot was the unaltered control used to determine the endogenous
HE4 concentration in each HAMA sample.
The Expected HE4 Concentrations of HAMA samples spiked with HE4 Antigen
were calculated as follows:
[(V0 x C0) + (VS x CS)] / (V0 + VS) Where:
V0 = Volume of unspiked sample
C0 = Concentration of unspiked sample (control)
VS = Volume of spiking solution
CS = Concentration of spiking solution
The control and the HAMA samples were tested in 2 replicates using the assay on
the ARCHITECT i2000 analyzer. A single calibration curve was used
SR
throughout the study. The kit Controls were tested and evaluated for each run to

determine assay validity. The percent recovery was calculated from the mean
Observed HE4 Concentration obtained for each HAMA sample compared to the
Expected HE4 Concentration of that sample.
The range of recoveries for the individual samples (HAMA values ranging from
45.4 to 154.6 ng/mL) was from 91% to 108%, the average recovery was 102%.
The range of recoveries for each HAMA level tested was from 95 to 106%. Less
than 15% interference for each individual sample tested and less than 10%
average interference for each HAMA level tested was observed in the
ARCHITECT HE4 assay. As a result, the testing meets the sponsor’s
predetermined acceptance criteria of 100 ± 15% for individual sample recoveries
and 100 ± 10% for the mean recoveries of each HAMA level. These data support
the performance claims of the assay.
Rheumatoid arthritis interference
To evaluate the potential interference from rheumatoid factor (RF) antibodies in
the assay, a design similar to the HAMA interference was performed. Preparation
of Test Samples using six (6) HAMA positive human serum samples was as
follows:
1. Each RF serum sample was split into three (3) equal aliquots.
2. One (1) aliquot was spiked with approximately 90 (spike 1) pmol/L of
HE4 antigen (recombinant) prepared from a stock solution. No sample
was diluted more than 5% through spiking of the HE4 antigen.
3. One (1) aliquot was spiked with approximately 450 (spike 2) pmol/L of
HE4 antigen (recombinant) prepared from a stock solution. No sample
was diluted more than 5% through spiking of the HE4 antigen.
4. One (1) aliquot was the unaltered control used to determine the
endogenous HE4 concentration in each RF sample.
The Expected HE4 Concentrations of RF samples spiked with HE4 Antigen were
calculated similarly to the calculation for HAMA interference. The control and
the RF samples were tested in 2 replicates using the assay on the ARCHITECT
i2000 analyzer. A single calibration curve was used throughout the study. The
SR
ARCHITECT HE4 Controls were tested and evaluated for each run to determine
assay validity. The percent recovery was calculated from the mean Observed HE4
Concentration obtained from each RF sample supplemented with HE4 antigen
compared to the Expected HE4 Concentration of that sample.
The range of recoveries for the individual samples (RF values ranging from 21 to
445 IU/mL) was from 98% to 111%; the average recovery was 103%. The range
of recoveries for each RF level tested was from 100 to 108%. Less than 15%
interference for each individual sample tested and less than 10% average
interference for each RF level tested was observed in the assay. As a result, the
testing meets the sponsor’s predetermined acceptance criteria of 100 ± 15% for
individual sample recoveries and 100 ± 10% for the mean recoveries of each RF
level. These data support the performance claims of the assay.

Interference from various chemotherapeutic agents
To evaluate the potential interference from several chemotherapeutic agents in the
assay, CLSI guideline EP7-A was used to design the interference experiments.
Two (2) levels of human serum supplemented with native HE4 antigen were
spiked with each chemotherapeutic agent listed below as a potential interfering
substance. The various chemotherapeutic substances were prepared for spiking
using a particular solvent. Control samples were spiked with an equal volume of
each respective solvent without the agent. The control samples and the samples
supplemented with chemotherapeutic substances were tested in 2 replicates using
the assay on the ARCHITECT i2000 System analyzer. A single calibration
SR
curve was used throughout the study. The kit Controls were tested and evaluated
for each run to determine assay validity. The mean concentration obtained from
the 2 replicates of each sample with the added therapeutics was compared to the
mean value of the corresponding control sample with solvent only to calculate the
percent recovery.

Cross-reactivity from other tumor markers
To evaluate the potential interference from other known tumor markers (such as
CA125, CA15-3, CA19-9, CEA, and AFP) in the assay, semi-purified tumor
marker solutions were prepared from in-house cultures or obtained from an
outside source (CEA and AFP). 100 times, 50 times and 10 times the normal level
of the respective tumor marker were added to kit Calibrator A. The target

Serum tube type
A study was conducted to evaluate whether commonly used serum collection tubes
interfere with the ARCHITECT HE4 assay. Serum samples from 10 healthy
volunteers were collected in the following blood collection tube types (BD
vacutainer tubes) and tested within eight hours:

Each blood collection tube type for each donor sample was split into 2 aliquots. One
aliquot for each of two donor subjects was spiked with HE4 antigen (recombinant)
giving 5 different increasingly higher HE4 concentrations. The specimens were not
diluted more than 10%. One (1) aliquot was left un-spiked (neat). The spiked and

the assay on the ARCHITECT i2000 System. A single calibration curve was used
SR
throughout the study. The ARCHITECT HE4 Controls were tested and evaluated
for each run to determine assay validity. The mean concentration obtained from 2
replicates of each sample tested was compared to the corresponding spike or neat
mean concentration for the conventional serum red top tube sample (control).
The range of percent recoveries for each individual sample was between 97% -
108% for non-spiked samples and 95% - 113% for spiked samples. The percent
recovery for the mean of all samples was 105% for Red/Gray Top (SST), 101% for
Red Top Hemogard™ (Red H) and 102% for Gold Top (Gold). The assay meets the
predetermined acceptance criteria of 100 ± 15% for individual sample recoveries
and 100 ± 10% for the mean recovery of all samples. Serum collected in serum
separator tubes with a conventional or Hemogard closure will not likely cause
interference in the assay.
f. Assay cut-off:
There is no assay cut-off for monitoring the progression of epithelial ovarian
cancer using this marker.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A comparison of HE4 test results for the Architect HE4 assay and the manual
HE4 immunoassay was performed with the following objectives:
1. Provide data for method comparison for inclusion in the package insert.
2. Determine the correlation and agreement of the ARCHITECT HE4 Assay
with the HE4 EIA.
3. Verification of the performance of the quality control (QC) procedures as
stated in the proposed ARCHITECT HE4 Package Insert.
4. Verification of user testing in single replicates
Two sites provided serum specimens for the study. For each site, the minimum
number and patient groups were: 60 specimens from apparently healthy females,
60 specimens from women with benign gynecologic disease, and 60 specimens
from women with epithelial ovarian cancer. Specimens were obtained from 4
commercial serum vendors. Samples were collected under an Institutional Review
Board (IRB)-approved protocol or considered remnant samples and the IRB
concluded that informed consent was not needed. The following
inclusion/exclusion criteria were utilized for specimen collection:
Inclusion criteria:
1) Samples must be collected in red top tubes or serum separator tubes (SST)
2) Sample Information
a) Age or Date of Birth
b) Gender
c) Collection Date
d) Menopausal status
e) Ethnicity

hours
5) No sample information
6) >5 Freeze/Thaw Cycles
7) Obvious microbial contamination
To determine the statistical relationship between the ARCHITECT HE4 Assay
and the manual HE4 immunoassay, linear regression, Deming regression, and
Passing-Bablok regression analyses were performed at each of the 2 laboratory
sites. One site was the manufacturer’s site and 1 external site. A minimum of 180
serum samples were tested at each site. Both Pearson and Spearman correlation
coefficients were determined for all comparisons. Ninety-five percent (95%)
confidence intervals on the regression parameters were calculated. Outliers were
evaluated per CLSI EP9-A2.3. Bias plots were generated to assess the agreement
between the two assays as per CLSI EP9-A2.3.
The acceptance criteria for samples with HE4 EIA values from 20 to 900 pM are
as follows:
a) Passing-Bablok slope: 1.00 ± 10% (i.e., 0.90 to 1.10)
b) Correlation Coefficient ≥ 0.90
For this study, the sponsor chose to limit one comparison to the common assay
range for both assays. The ARCHITECT HE4 assay range is 20 - 1,500 pmol/L
and the HE4 EIA assay range is 15 – 900 pM. The common range for the
comparison was 20 to 900 pmol/L.
The ARCHITECT HE4 assay was performed following the instructions for use
specified in the proposed package insert. Sample testing was performed on 1 lot
of reagents using 1 ARCHITECT i2000 System per site. A single calibration
SR
curve was used throughout the study at each site. The kit controls were tested and
evaluated for each run to determine assay validity. Sample dilutions for
ARCHITECT HE4 values above the range of the assay were diluted using the on-
board dilution protocol at a dilution of 1:10.
The manual HE4 immunoassay was run according to the package insert. The
samples were tested in 2 replicates at each site. The mean of the 2 replicates was
used for the data analyses. Sample dilutions for manual HE4 immunoassay above
the range of the assay were diluted manually at a dilution of 1:10 with the
exception of 1 sample (EOC74) at the external site which was diluted at dilution
of 1:5.
At the sponsor’s testing site, the following samples were included for analysis:
65 samples from apparently healthy females
65 samples from women with benign gynecologic diseases
63 samples from women with epithelial ovarian cancer

K093957 Decision Summary
The sponsor compares assay results at each site as well as for all subjects
combined. Analysis will concentrate only on combined data from each site.
The racial composition of all study subjects was the following:
Ethnicity n Proportion
African American 8 2%
Caucasian 386 97%
Hispanic 5 1%
Unknown 1 0%
The median age for three disease groups of subjects tested are as follows:

cancer 140 56.0 52.0 59.0
normal 130 63.0 60.0 65.0
All benign disease groups were pooled into a single category.
Of all women, 64% were post-menopausal and 36% were pre-menopausal. The
median HE4 values by menopausal status are as follows:
HE4 values by Menopausal Status n Median 95% CI
ARCHITECT Post-Menopausal 255 60.40 53.40 to 66.00
HE4 Pre-Menopausal 145 42.30 38.80 to 45.10
Post-Menopausal 255 60.48 56.20 to 65.84
manual HE4
Pre-Menopausal 145 45.86 42.42 to 50.05
Note that the HE4 values for each assay are essentially identical in post-menopausal
women. The ARCHITECT HE4 values are lower than the manual HE4 values in pre-
menopausal women. It is not clear if this difference is clinically significant.
The median HE4 values by disease group are as follows:
N Median 95% CI

Among cancer and normal subjects, the median HE4 values for each assay
(Architect and manual immunoassay) are equivalent. For subjects with benign
diseases, the median ARCHITECT HE4 value is lower than the HE4 value using
the manual immunoassay. It is not clear if this difference is clinically significant.
The sponsor analyzed for both combined sites different measures of equivalent
test results for the Architect HE4 assay and the manual HE4 immunoassay. To
assess the bias between assays, the sponsor chose 3 measures of assessment

(when selecting the manual HE4 immunoassay concentration range of 20-900
pM). The 3 measures used for this evaluation were:
1. Actual concentration difference (bias) between the 2 assays (defined as bias =
ARCHITECT HE4 result – HE4 EIA result),
2. Percent difference (% bias) between the 2 assays (defined as %bias =
[(ARCHITECT HE4 result – HE4 EIA result) / HE4 EIA result] x 100%,
3. Ratio bias between the 2 assays (defined as ratio bias = (ARCHITECT HE4
value) / (HE4 EIA value).
For the concentration range of 20 to 900 pmol/L (manual HE4 assay), the mean
difference (bias) in values was determined to be 2.2 pmol/L (95% confidence
interval of the difference 0.1 to 4.3) for 390 subjects. The mean percentage bias
relative to the manual assay result was -2.3% (95% confidence interval from -
3.5% to -1.1%). The ARCHITECT HE4 assay has, on average, a higher value
than the manual HE4 assay.
A graphical plot of differences in assay result (Bland-Altman plot) is as follows:

Based on this plot for HE4 values above 300 pmol/L, the ARCHITECT HE4
assay has a proportion of differences greater than 50 pmol/L. ARCHITECT HE4
results are more frequently higher than the manual HE4 immunoassay above 300
pmol/L. This difference in HE4 concentration above 300 pmol/L is likely because
of HE4 values from ovarian cancer subjects.
The sponsor shows a figure illustrating the relationship between the ARCHITECT
HE4 assay values and the HE4 EIA values for the 20-900 pM concentration range
as determined by a Passing-Bablok regression analysis. This figure is as follows:

K093957 Decision Summary
The slope of the best fit line for 390 subjects with manual HE4 immunoassay
values between 20 and 900 pmol/L was 1.06 (95% confidence interval 1.03 to
1.08). The intercept of the best fit line was -4.4 pmol/L (95% confidence interval
-5.5 to –3.0). The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was 0.97. The slope
result met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria of a slope between 0.9 and 1.10.
Based on the relationship in the Passing-Bablok regression analysis, the %bias
between assay methods is calculated as follows:

is 6.5% or slightly above. At HE4 concentrations above 300 pmol/L, subjects in
the comparison had ovarian cancer. Therefore, it is likely that at 300 pmol/L or
higher, a subject would have ovarian cancer and likely would be undergoing serial
surveillance monitoring for cancer recurrence or would be receiving therapy.
Therefore, the difference is likely not clinically significant.
For the concentration range of >20 pmol/L (manual HE4 assay; range of values
20 to ~8000 pmol/L), the mean difference (bias) in values was determined by the
sponsor to be -4.1 pmol/L (95% confidence interval of the difference -10.1 to 1.8)
for 399 subjects. The mean percentage bias relative to the manual assay result was
-2.7% (95% confidence interval from -3.9% to -1.4%). The ARCHITECT HE4
assay has, on average, a lower value than the manual HE4 assay when the manual
assay is > 20 pmol/L. A figure is shown illustrating the relationship between the
ARCHITECT HE4 assay values and the HE4 EIA values for HE4 values > 20
pmol/L in the manual assay (n = 399) as determined by a Passing-Bablok
regression analysis. The slope of the best fit line with manual HE4 immunoassay
values > 20 pmol/L was 1.04 (95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.07). The
intercept of the best fit line was -3.7 pmol/L (95% confidence interval -5.1 to -
2.4). The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was 0.97. The slope result met the
sponsor’s acceptance criteria of a slope between 0.9 and 1.10.
The sponsor also sought to show the equivalence of replicates of the same serum
sample when tested in the Architect HE4 assay. This was assessed by comparing
replicate 1 vs. replicate 2 from the same serum sample on 195 samples less than
1500 pmol/L. The sponsor shows a figure showing the bias between the 1st
replicate value and the 2nd replicate value. The overall average bias was 0.3%
(95% Limits of Agreement: -9.0% to 9.5%). The sponsor further indicated the
relationship between the 1st replicate value and the 2nd replicate value for the 20
to 1500 pmol/L concentration range as determined by a Passing-Bablok
Regression Analysis. The slope of the best fit line was 1.01 (95% confidence
interval 1.00 to 1.02). The intercept of the line was -0.45 pmol/L (95% confidence
interval -1.05 to 0.18). The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was 0.99. The
Passing-Bablok slope and intercept indicate close agreement between replicates
since the slope is equivalent with 1.0 and the intercept is equivalent with 0. Thus
the results support testing of HE4 serum samples in single replicates.
For all the method comparison studies, the results met the sponsor’s acceptance
criteria and are acceptable.
b. Matrix comparison:
No comparison was made with other specimen testing matrices since only human
serum is the testing matrix.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
A retrospective clinical study was performed utilizing remnant serial serum
samples from 76 subjects diagnosed with Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC) after
the completion of chemotherapy. The serial serum samples (a minimum of 3
serial draws) were taken from pre- and postmenopausal women 18 years of age or
older with a diagnosis of EOC who were undergoing serial surveillance

K093957 Decision Summary
monitoring of cancer progression during clinical follow-up. Subject samples could
have been drawn either during therapy, or following the completion of therapy for
the treatment of EOC. A clinician assessment was made at each clinical follow-up
at which a sample draw from each subject was taken. At each clinical follow-up
time, a clinical assessment of each subject at that follow-up time categorized the
disease status of subjects into 1 of the following subgroups:
1. No Evidence of Disease – NED: A complete lack of clinical evidence of
disease.
2. Stable Disease: Clinical evidence that the disease has not changed since
last assessment.
3. Progressive Disease: Clinical evidence of growth in the primary tumor or
the appearance of new tumors since the last assessment.
4. Responding Disease: Clinical evidence that there is a shrinking of the
primary tumor and no evidence of new tumors
HE4 serum levels for all serum samples were measured at the sponsor’s testing
site in single replicates using several kit lots. The assay was performed following
the appropriate quality control procedures and manufacturer’s instructions for use
specified in the proposed package insert. Sample testing was performed on 1
ARCHITECT i2000 . A single calibration curve was used throughout the study.
SR
For purposes of calculating clinical sensitivity and other performance parameters,
the clinical disease status was condensed into 2 categories: progressive disease
and non-progressive disease. A percentage change in successive HE4 values
(14%) was used to categorize the HE4 readings into those that were and were not
significantly elevated. The percent change greater than or equal to 14%
categorized an HE4 reading into a positive elevation; while a percent change less
than 14% categorized an HE4 reading into a negative elevation. The two category
HE4 test results were cross-tabulated against progression or non-progression in
disease.
The clinical sensitivity of the 14% elevation in HE4 values (from the preceding
serum sample) was 53.5% (exact binomial 95% confidence interval 43.2% to
63.6%). Of 99 clinical events categorized as progressive disease, a percent
elevation at least 14% was detected by the assay in 53 events across all subjects.
Further details of the study are below.
b. Clinical specificity:
For the same clinical study summarized in the clinical sensitivity section, the
clinical specificity of the 14% elevation in HE4 values (from the preceding serum
sample) was 78.5% (exact binomial 95% confidence interval 73.7% to 82.9%). Of
331 clinical events categorized as non-progressive disease, a percent elevation
less than 14% was detected by the assay in 260 events across all subjects. Further
details of the study are below.
c. Other clinical supportive data:
The specific objectives of the study included:

No specific inclusion/exclusion criteria are listed in the clinical study summary.
However, subjects were pre- and postmenopausal women 18 years of age or older
with a diagnosis of EOC. The following inclusion/exclusion criteria are listed in a
pre-IDE clinical study outline (I090501) for this study submitted for review:
Inclusion Criteria
• Female, age ≥ 18 years
• Diagnosed with EOC
• Currently receiving or completed therapy for treatment of EOC
• A minimum of 3 serial draws available
• Appropriate clinical data
• Minimum 0.4 mL volume of serum available

Exclusion Criteria
• No diagnosis of EOC
• Did not undergo therapy for the treatment of EOC
• Less than 3 serial draws available
• Insufficient sample volume
• Multiple freeze-thaw cycles
• Icteric, lipemic, hemolytic, substantial particulates
These criteria are acceptable and represent the sponsor’s description of the study
population. All subjects providing remnant serial serum samples were from a
tertiary cancer center through a commercial vendor. Informed consent was noted
as obtained utilizing a general Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved consent
form allowing for the subjects’ samples and clinical data to be used for future
research purposes. No samples were specifically drawn for this study.
The clinical data collected for each subject included the following:
• patient ID
• date of birth
• race/ethnicity
• menopausal status
• date of EOC diagnosis
• initial diagnosis method and surgical information (if available)
For each subject sample draw, the following information was collected:
• chemotherapeutic treatment information (onset date, end date,
regimen)
• imaging information (date, type, findings)
• physical exam date and findings
• sample draw date
• Clinical Disease Status
• additional comments
Sample Size
The sample size was calculated to be approximately 89 subjects with a minimum
of 3 draws per subject. The statistical analysis of the sample size was discussed in
the clinical study outline (I090501) previously submitted for review.
Sponsor Statistical Analysis Plan
The object of the trial is to demonstrate that the performance of the ARCHITECT
HE4 assay is clinically equivalent to that of the already-cleared HE4 EIA. This
will be achieved by verifying the diagnostic performance of the ARCHITECT
HE4 assay in differentiating between visits in which patients’ disease status is
progressing vs. visits in which the disease is not progressing. The study will be
considered successful if the overall concordance is statistically significantly
higher than 62.8% using a test at the one-sided 2.5 % significance level.
Specifically, at each visit, the attending clinician will classify the patient’s status
Page 29 of 40

--- Page 30 ---
K093957 Decision Summary
into the 4 categories listed above. These four categories will be reduced to two
categories–one class indicating disease progression, and a second class of the
above remaining 3 categories indicating lack of disease progression.
The ARCHITECT HE4 will also be categorized into 2 classes. It is anticipated
that the total random variability of the assay will be a coefficient of variation of
no more than 10%. If this is the case, the total random variability of the difference
between two assays is no more than 14% corresponding to a difference that was
statistically significantly different from zero. Following this categorization, if the
assay corresponding to a visit is more than 14% higher than the assay at the
immediately preceding visit, the HE4 will be scored as statistically significantly
elevated; otherwise it will be scored as not statistically significantly higher. A 2x2
cross-tabulation of all follow-up visits will be made.
Diagnostic performance of the ARCHITECT HE4 will be assessed by its positive
and negative concordance, and the overall concordance, with clinical progression.
ARCHITECT will be considered clinically equivalent in performance to the EIA
if its overall concordance is at least 62.8%, a figure clinically compatible with that
established in the HE4 EIA submission.
Each patient will provide a profile of binary scores for HE4 elevation and clinical
progression. These profiles will be analyzed using generalized estimating
equation model. The null hypothesis to be tested will be rephrased in terms of the
log odds ratio. The target of 62.8% concordance corresponds to a log odds ratio of
0.87, and so the analysis will be in terms of a hypothesis test of the log odds ratio.
Writing θ for the log odds ratio for the association between the ARCHITECT
HE4 assay and clinical status, this leads to the statistical hypothesis
H : θ ≤ 0.87 which, for success, will have to be rejected in favor of
0
H : θ > 0.87
a
Testing will be one-sided at the 2.5% significance level. The 2x2 cross-tabulation
will be used to calculate estimates of the positive, negative and overall
concordance. Standard errors and confidence intervals for these quantities will be
calculated from the generalized linear model outputs.
Subject disposition
A total of 525 samples for 80 subjects were initially obtained. Fourteen serum
samples from 4 subjects were excluded from analysis because the diagnosis was
something other than EOC after further review of the subject’s medical chart.
Five samples from 5 subjects were excluded because the disease status was not
determined at the time of serum sampling. A total of 506 samples from 76
subjects were used for the analyses.
Subject Demographics
The mean age of subjects was 54 years old (95% confidence interval from 50.3 to
56.9). The majority of subjects were Caucasian (84.2%); 5.3% were African-
American. Only 2 (2.6%) subjects were premenopausal subjects; the remaining

There was a total of 506 serum sample draws for the 76 subjects. The mean
number of sample draws per subject was 6.7 ranging from 3 to 31 draws. The
length of time (in days) over which the subjects were monitored ranged from 36
to 2614 days (median of 368 days). The median interval (in days) between
successive visits was 83 ranging from 0 to 1120.

78.8%, standard error 1.9%, from which the False positive rate is 21.2%, standard
error 1.9%.
The difference in sensitivity and the false positive proportion was 32.2% (95%
confidence interval of the difference 22.4% to 42.0%). The difference in
sensitivity and specificity is significantly greater than zero. The difference in
specificity and 1-specificity in this analysis are equivalent. Therefore, the assay is
informative with respect to progression/non-progression status.
The sponsor examines the total concordance of progression/non-progression
status vs. %change in HE4 values to test the stated null hypothesis. The sponsor
frames the hypothesis by converting the hypothesis into the logarithm of the odds
ratio for the 2 x 2 table. A generalized linear model with a logistic link and
autoregressive error structure was created. The 95% confidence interval for the
log odds associated with elevated HE4 was determined to be 0.68 to 1.31 (mean
0.991). A test of the null hypothesis of the logarithm of the odds ratio was
significant and the sponsor concludes that the overall percent concordance being
less than or equal to 62.8% was rejected in favor of the hypothesis that the percent
concordance exceeds 62.8%. Simple examination of the lower 95% confidence
interval of the estimated overall agreement in the table above indicates that the
total agreement exceeds 62.8% (lower limit 68.3% with mean concordance
72.8%). Thus the null hypothesis can be rejected in favor of the alternative
hypothesis of total agreement greater than 62.8%.
The sponsor shows a receiver-operator characteristics (ROC) curve analysis of the
percent change in HE4. The sponsor found that the area under the ROC curve was
0.685 with standard error 0.033; this area is statistically significantly better than
the non-association area of 0.5. Analysis of the area and 95% confidence interval
was very similar (area = 0.684; 95% confidence interval 0.618 to 0.750). The
ROC curve is as follows:

%change HE4
The sponsor summarizes the analysis and suggests a series of %change in HE4
cutoff values with associated sensitivity and specificity performance values. The
following table indicates analysis at different cutoff values for %change in HE4:
Percent Change Sensitivity (%) Specificity (%) Lower CI for Upper CI for
in HE4 Specificity Specificity
0 69 / 99 = 69.7% 58% 52% 63%
5 62 / 99 = 62.6% 69% 63% 74%
10 56 / 99 = 56.6% 75% 70% 79%
14 53 / 99 = 53.5% 78% 73% 83%
20 47 / 99 = 47.5% 84% 80% 88%
25 39 / 99 = 39.4% 87% 83% 91%
50 28 / 99 = 28.3% 94% 90% 96%
75 18 / 99 = 18.2% 97% 94% 98%
100 16 / 99 = 16.2% 98% 95% 99%
Note that for increasing %change in HE4 cutoff values, the sensitivity decreases
and the specificity increases. There is currently no accepted %change in HE4
value that clinicians have decided is optimal for use. The labeling will present a
similar table of differing sensitivity and specificity values at different %change in
HE4 values so clinicians can choose a value that reflects their own preferences in
sensitivity or specificity.
The following table shows the median (and 1st and 3rd quartile values) %change in
HE4 for each clinical disease state.

K093957 Decision Summary
Disease state N Min 1st quartile Median 95% CI 3rd quartile max
NED 183 -97.3% -11.7% -1.4% -5.5% 1.4% 11.3% 3771%
Progression 99 -68.9% -5.4% 16.8% 7.9% 24.6% 53.2% 2608%
Responding 61 -93.9% -42.7% -15.6% -30.3% -9.4% -3.4% 71.6%
Stable 87 -81.7% -15.0% 2.0% -6.1% 5.5% 18.5% 8808%
The sponsor makes the following conclusions on the median values:
• The NED and Stable subjects have very similar summary statistics,
• Over 75% of visits in which the subject was responding to treatment, showed
a decrease in HE4,
• Nearly 75% of the subjects showing disease progression had an increase in
HE4.
It should also be noted that subjects with both NED and stable disease had a
median %change in HE4 equivalent with 0% change (since the 95% confidence
interval of the median includes 0%). Subjects with no evidence of disease (NED)
had a %change in HE4 between -11.7% in the first quartile and 11.3% in the third
quartile. This indicates that for 75% of subjects with NED, the %change in HE4 is
less than ± 14% and this change in HE4 will not be informative. Subjects with
responding disease had a median %change that was significantly below 0%
change (95% confidence interval does not include 0). Subjects with progression
had a median %change significantly above 0% change (confidence interval does
not include 0). This indicates that the median %change for subjects with
progression, responsive disease, and stable disease categories are related to the
disease state of the subject. This difference in median %change can be
generalized to a 3 x 3 table of subject counts for all visits where the HE4
concentration is above 140 pmol/L as follows:
HE4 > 140 pM Disease status
responsive stable Progression total

-14% ≤ x ≤ 14% 6 11 15 32
> 14% 1 18 38 57
total 17 38 59 114
The association of a percent change in HE4 in the 3 assay categories shown with
disease status is significant (p < 0.001, Chi square test). The following indicates
the sensitivity and specificity of the %change in HE4 for each disease status:
Sensitivity –
Se responding = 58.8% ± 0.119 (1-Specificity) = 43.4% From 18.9% To 67.8%
Sp responding = 84.5% ± 0.037
Sensitivity –
Se stable = 28.9% ± 0.074 (1-Specificity) = 1.3% From -16.3% To 18.9%
Sp stable = 72.4% ± 0.051

K093957 Decision Summary
The informativeness of a decreasing HE4 (< - 14% while HE4 concentration
remains above 140 pM) for responding disease status is significant since the
difference in sensitivity minus 1-specificity is greater than 0 (95% confidence
interval of the difference from 18.9% to 67.8%). The informativeness of an
increasing HE4 (>14% while HE4 concentration remains above 140 pM) for
progressive disease is significant since the difference in sensitivity minus 1-
specificity is greater than 0 (95% confidence interval of the difference from
12.3% to 47.4%).
Since 75% of subjects with NED had a %change in HE4 between -14% and 14%,
this percent change in HE4 is not informative. However, a different type of cutoff
may be informative in subjects with NED vs subjects without NED (i.e. active
disease; progression, stable disease, or responding disease statuses). The median
HE4 concentration of subjects with no evidence of disease was 49.7 pmol/L. This
median concentration is significantly lower than the median HE4 concentrations
of subjects with progressive, stable, or responding disease. Of 183 events where
the disease state was categorized as NED, 129 NED events (70.5%) had HE4
concentrations less than the overall median HE4 concentration of 71.4 pmol/L for
all 4 disease states. The median HE4 concentration and the 95% confidence
interval of the median for the 4 disease states are as follows:
Median
Clinical
No. of HE4 Lower Upper
Disease Status
events (pmol/L) 95% CI 95% CI
NED 183 49.7 45.2 53.9
Progression 99 208.8 139.5 398.2
Responding 61 75.1 63.6 104.2
Stable 87 89.2 68.4 177.4
The sponsor also notes that comparison of the NED subjects with the active
subjects shows that the HE4 level itself differs substantially between the 4 groups,
and so may be used within the cancer subject group to differentiate NED from
active cancer subjects. A ROC analysis by the sponsor of the Active and NED
groups was carried out and showed that the maximum of the sum of sensitivity
and specificity occurred if an HE4 level of 140 pmol/L was used to differentiate
between the 2 groups.
Since subjects with NED may have low HE4 concentrations, a cutoff of 140
pmol/L HE4 (the upper limit of normal HE4 values) was selected to categorize
subjects with and without elevation in HE4. Comparison of these 2 categories
with disease status NED or not NED results in the following 2 x 2 table:
NED not NED
HE4 ≤ 140 179 133 312
HE4 > 140 4 114 118
183 247 430
The sensitivity of HE4 values less than 140 pmol/L was 97.8%. This indicates
that 98% of subjects with no evidence of disease will have HE4 concentrations

K093957 Decision Summary
less than 140 pmol/L. The specificity of HE4 values at 140 pmol/L is 46.2%. For
subjects without NED, 46.2% will have HE4 values greater than 140 pmol/L. The
informativeness of HE4 concentrations for subjects with or without NED is
statistically significant. Note that of 247 events where the disease state was
categorized as not NED, 133 events (53.8%) had HE4 concentration less than 140
pmol/L. This reflects the proportion of events with a “false positive” result (i.e.
HE4 ≤ 140 pmol/L). The proportion of NED events when the HE4 concentration
is less than or equal to 140 pmol/L was 57.4% (179 of 312).
A table of the performance for distinguishing between NED and active disease for
some other HE4 cutoffs is as follows:
HE4 Sensitivity Specificity
cutoff
50 48% 88%
75 74% 66%
100 86% 57%
125 95% 52%
140 98% 49%
The implication from the table is that clinicians may choose a lower HE4
concentration. As a result, the sensitivity will decrease while the specificity will
increase. Since there is no clinically accepted HE4 concentration for subjects with
no evidence of disease, the clinician may choose from this range of HE4 in order
to choose the sensitivity or specificity important to the evaluation of subjects in
their care.
The following table combines all subject visits for all disease states and HE4
cutoff values;
NED responding stable progression total
HE4 ≤ 140 179 44 49 40 312
< -14% 0 10 9 6 25

> 14% 4 1 18 38 61
total 183 61 87 99 430
Note from the table that at the majority of subject visits, the HE4 concentration
was less than 140 pmol/L, though the 4 disease states were present. Of the 312
subject visits where the HE4 value was less than 140 pmol/L, 179 visits occurred
where the clinical state of the subject was NED (57.4%; 95% confidence interval
based on positive likelihood ratio 54.5% to 60.2%). Of 61 subject visits where the
%change in HE4 was greater than 14% and the HE4 concentration remained
above 140 pmol/L, 38 visits occurred where the clinical statue of the subject was
progression (62.3%; 95% confidence interval based on the positive likelihood
ratio from 50.9% to 72.5%). The association of disease states and changes in HE4
of elevation above or below 140 pmol/l was significantly more than random
association. Thus in the above table the HE4 result (both as a %change or
elevation above 140 pmol/L) is statistically associated with disease states.

K093957 Decision Summary
The sponsor makes the following conclusions regarding the clinical study:
1. The primary endpoint of the trial was to demonstrate that clinical disease
progression is associated with an increase in HE4 from the preceding visit of
at least 14%. The study found that a total concordance probability of at least
62.8% demonstrate that an increase in HE4 of at least 14% is significantly
associated with clinical cancer progression, the 95% confidence interval for
the total concordance being 68.9% to 76.7%. Clinicians may wish to use
other cutoffs to reflect their preferences in the tradeoff between sensitivity
and specificity; a table of the impact of different cutoffs is given.
2. The HE4 concentration itself provides an indication of whether disease is
still present compared to when no evidence of disease is clinically apparent.
Nearly all (98%) of the subjects with no evidence of disease had HE4 levels
below 140 pmol/L, as opposed to 51% of those with active disease
manifestations. From this analysis, 54% of subjects without NED (133/247)
had HE4 concentration below 140 pmol/l.
The clinical study supports the claimed indication for use of the HE4 assay.
4. Clinical cut-off:
There is currently no clinically accepted cut-off for use in monitoring cancer
progression in epithelial ovarian cancer subjects with this assay. A cut-off for use in
this situation could be a percentage change from a previously determined value and
would be expected to correlate with the clinical state at the time of assay and clinical
evaluation. The labeling contains various percentage changes in HE4 from a previous
value as determined in the clinical study. The assay performance characteristics
(sensitivity and specificity) at each cut-off are indicated for use in a serial
surveillance monitoring situation where clinical outcome is categorized as cancer
progression/non-progression.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
A total of 1626 samples were tested from which results were used to determine the
distribution of the ARCHITECT HE4 concentration values in various benign and
malignant conditions as well as in apparently healthy women. Apparently healthy
women were used to establish the normal and reference ranges for the ARCHITECT
HE4 assay. The study was performed on single-point human serum samples obtained
from commercial vendors, specimen banks or leftover specimens from a previous
sponsor study. These samples were collected under an Institutional Review Board
(IRB) approved protocol or considered remnant samples and the IRB concluded that
informed consent was not needed. The following information was collected when the
specimen was obtained:
• Age or Date of Birth
• Gender
• Collection Date
• Menopausal status
• Ethnicity
Samples were not collected when stored at 2-8°C for more than 3 days or at room
temperature for more than 24 hours; when there was no sample information; when >5

HE4 serum levels were measured in single replicates following the appropriate
quality control procedures and manufacturer’s instructions for use specified in the
proposed package insert. Sample testing was performed on 1 lot of reagents using 4
ARCHITECT i2000 Systems. One calibration curve on each instrument was used.

performed for the overall set of apparently healthy females in the study as well as by
menopausal status. The pre- and postmenopausal HE4 normal value cutoffs were
chosen based on the 95th and 97.5th percentile of the population tested. The sponsor
recommends that each laboratory establish its own reference value for the population
of interest. The summary values are as follows:

Postmenopausal 190 125.9 pmol/L 163.0 pmol/L
The sponsor has chosen 70 pmol/L as the upper limit of normal for pre-menopausal
women and 140 pmol/L for post menopausal women. The data are accurate and
appropriate.
