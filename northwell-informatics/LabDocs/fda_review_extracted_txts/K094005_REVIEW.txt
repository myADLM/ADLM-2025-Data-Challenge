L. Test Principle:
The FORA G31/TD 4256 Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems use electrochemical
methodologies. The systems quantitatively measure blood glucose levels using an
amperometric method, which involves detecting the current produced from glucose
oxidation. The electrons generated during this reaction are transferred from the blood
to the electrodes. The magnitude of the resultant current is proportional to the
concentration of glucose in the specimen and the signal is converted into a readout
displayed on the meter.

studies were performed to evaluate precision of the glucose meter with more
complex data transmission function, the FORA G31b/TD-4256B model. The
sponsor evaluated within run precision of the FORA G31b/TD-4256B using a
protocol based on ISO 15197. The within-run precision study was performed
using venous whole blood samples, with hematocrit ranging from 38% to
54%, and dextrose spiked to create 5 levels of blood glucose. Three lots of
test strips and 10 meters were used in the study, with 10 tests performed on
each meter for a total of 100 tests per blood glucose level. Results for each

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Established in the original submission (k090187)
Reference Method Comparison:
In addition, a new method comparison study was performed to demonstrate
the accuracy of the proposed devices when compared to measurements
obtained with the YSI 2300. One hundred twenty blood samples with glucose
concentrations ranging from 24.8 to 594 mg/dL and hematocrit of 38 % to
58% were tested using the FORA G31b/TD-4256B model. Fresh capillary
whole blood samples from study participants ranged from 40 mg/dL to 400
mg/dL. Samples with glucose concentrations less than 40 and greater than 400
mg/dL were obtained by spiking the samples to desired concentrations. The
study results met the ISO 15197 accuracy criteria where ninety-five percent
(95%) of the individual glucose results shall fall within ±15mg/dL of the
reference method results at glucose concentrations <75mg/dL and within
±20% at glucose concentrations ≥75mg/dL.

webserver, or mobile device?:
Yes X oor No o
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile
device using wireless transmission?:
Yes X oor No o
2. Software:
FDA reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes
for glucose measurement in k090187. Additionally, in this submission, the
sponsor provided data to support the added new features for no-coding, data
transmission and memory capacity properties.
Yes X oor No o
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied
directly to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, and
the alternative sites, such as palm, forearm, upper-arm, calf and thigh, which can
be applied directly to the test strip.
5. Calibration:
No calibration is required from the user. The software cleared in k090187 was
modified to remove the one code number selection feature and the labeling was
modified to reflect the removal of the one code feature.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor has two levels of controls (cleared under k041107), not provided
with the meters, but supplied separately. When a test strip is inserted into the
meter, each control can be measured by following the instructions for
“Performing a Control Solution Test” provided in the User’s Manuals for the
meters. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial
label. If the test results fall outside the range printed on the test strip vial, the user
is instructed to contact the Customer Care Line at 1-866-469-2632 for customer
support. The Customer Care service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,
365 days a year.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. The FORA G31a/TD-4256A and FORA G31b/TD-4256B have the same basic circuit
design. An accuracy test using the Quality Control current board (QC board) was
conducted to evaluate if equivalent accuracy can be obtained for those two models
10

--- Page 11 ---
(FORA G31a/TD-4256A and FORA G31b/TD-4256B). Specifically, the QC board
was designed to simulate 12 levels of glucose concentration: 20, 40, 60, 80,
100, 120, 160, 200, 280, 400, 550 and 700 mg/dL. The QC board connected to the
meter sends electrical current to the meter. The electrical current is equivalent to the
total amount of charge generated by the glucose oxidation reaction at a certain
glucose concentration. The meter then processes the current and displays it in mg/dL
unit. Based on this evaluation, the sponsor concluded that the accuracy of the FORA
G31a/TD-4256A Blood Glucose Monitoring System is equivalent to the FORA G31
b/TD-4256B within the specified dynamic range of 20mg/dL to 600mg/dL.
2. The modifications of the new devices when compared to the predicate (parent) device
include the addition of USB or Bluetooth mediated data transmission feature from
glucose meters to personal PCs, change in the type of coding function, an increase in
memory, a name change, and a change in size and weight. The following
documentation of these modifications related to software changes was reviewed and
found to be acceptable for both glucose meters: level of concern, software
description, device hazard analysis, software requirements specifications, software
design specification, software development environment description, and verification
and validation testing.
3. Lay-User Study for USB and Bluetooth mediated Data Transmission:
This study was performed with a total of 50 lay users with both the FORA
G31a/TD-4256A and FORA G31 b/TD-4256B glucose meters. The 50 study
participants, using the information provided in User’s manual, were able to obtain
testing results, install the PC application and transmit results from the meter to the
PC application via either the USB for the FORA G31a/TD-4256A meter or the
Bluetooth feature for the FORA G31b/TD-4256B meter. The study participants
ranged in age, education, and were about equally divided between males and
females. Those study participants also completed a questionnaire in response to
whether the data transmission feature is easy to use. The sponsor concluded that
the user’s responses indicated that data transmission function was easy to operate
by following the User’s manuals for both the USB and the Bluetooth mediated
data transmission.
4. The FORA G31/TD 4256 Blood glucose monitoring system operates at 10 to
40oC and relative humidity below 85%. Temperature exposure limits of the
system were determined to be -20oC to 60oC, and humidity exposure limits of 5 to
95% relative humidity (see previously cleared k090187). Drop tests and vibration
tests were performed on the FORA G31b/TD 4256B Blood glucose monitoring
system. These tests support an operating and limit exposure temperature and
humidity ranges.
5. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing was performed/passed and a
certificate to Taidoc Technology Corporation was provided.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
