I. Device Description:
Elecsys Folate III CalCheck 5 is a lyophilized product consisting of folic acid in
human serum buffer matrix. During manufacture, folate is spiked into the matrix at
the target concentrations listed below. CalCheck Level 1 contains no analyte.
Elecsys Folate III Target Value (ng/mL)
CalCheck Level
Level 1 0
Level 2 3.8
Level 3 10.0
Level 4 16.0
Level 5 19.0
All human source materials were prepared exclusively from the blood of donors
tested individually and found nonreactive for HBsAg, antibodies to HCV and HIV-
1/2. The testing methods were FDA approved or cleared in compliance with the
European Directive 98/79/EC.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and Value Assignment
A master calibration curve is generated on an Elecsys Modular Analytics
E170 /cobas e 601analyzer by standardizing the Folate III assay against
internal reference samples. The master calibration curve is used to calculate
ng/mL for the respective CalChecks. For each Elecsys Folate III CalCheck 5
lot manufactured, value assignment is performed as follows. Each CalCheck is
tested in duplicate using at least three Elecsys Modular Analytics E170 /cobas
e 601analyzers. The target value for each CalCheck is the median of the
observed values.
The labeling states that laboratories should establish appropriate acceptance
criteria when using this product for its intended use.
Stability
Real time and accelerated stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria
were described and found to be adequate. The current closed vial stability
claim is 18 months at 2o to 8oC. The reconstituted vials are stable for four
hours at 25 º C.
