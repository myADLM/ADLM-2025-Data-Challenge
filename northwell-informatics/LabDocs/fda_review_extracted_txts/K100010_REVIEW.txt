L. Test Principle:
The SYNCHRON® Systems HDL Cholesterol (HDLX) Reagent is a direct HDL
Cholesterol method. It is a homogeneous assay without the need for any offline
pretreatment or centrifugation steps. The method depends on a unique detergent
which solubilizes only the HDL lipoprotein particles and releases HDL cholesterol to
react with cholesterol esterase and cholesterol oxidase in the presence of chromogens,
to produce a color product. The same detergent also inhibits the reaction of the
cholesterol enzymes with LDL, VLDL, and chylomicrons lipoproteins by adsorbing
to their surfaces. A polyanion contained in the reagent enhances the selectivity for
HDL cholesterol assay by complexing LDL, VLDL, and chylomicrons lipoproteins.
This HDLX reagent is used to measure the cholesterol concentration by a timed-
endpoint method. The change in absorbance at 560 nanometers is monitored. This
change in absorbance is directly proportional to the concentration of cholesterol in the
sample and is used to calculate the HDL-cholesterol concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed a precision study designed to verify that the within-
run precision has not changed as a result of changing to the new calibrator.
Commercially available multi-level control materials were used. Each control
level was aliquoted into 4 samples and each sample was run in 5 replicates to
generate a sample number (n) of 20. The study was conducted on one UniCel
DxC 800 and one LX20 SYNCHRON Clinical System. The data is
summarized below:
Mean Within-run variation Mean Within-run variation
(mg/dL) S.D. %CV (mg/dL) S.D. %CV
Unicel DxC 800 LX20 SYNCHRON Clinical System
31.82 0.53 1.66 33.13 0.35 1.05
46.56 0.39 0.85 47.56 0.37 0.77
62.33 0.51 0.82 62.61 0.55 0.87
20.20 0.37 1.83 23.11 0.38 1.64
57.63 0.65 1.13 58.94 0.78 1.33
98.75 0.84 0.85 99.79 1.39 1.39
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The study was performed following CLSI protocol EP6-A. Commercially
available linearity standards each containing 5 levels (10 different
concentration levels in total)) of HDL spanning the reportable range of the
assay were used. Each level was run in 3 replicates. The study was conducted
on one UniCel DxC 800 and one LX20 SYNCHRON Clinical System. The
recovered HDL values were plotted against the expected values and an
appropriate line was fitted by standard linear regression. The results of the
data analysis are summarized below:

Instrument Range Linear Regression Analysis
DxC 800 5.0 – 135 mg/dL Y = 1.004x + 1.00 r = 0.9997
LX20 5.0 – 135 mg/dL Y = 1.004x – 3.3 r = 0.9998
The claimed reportable range of the assay is 5.0 to 135 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrators to be used with this assay are manufactured by Genzyme
Corporation and have been previously cleared under k971162.
Calibration Frequency: The calibration is valid for 14 days on the UniCel
DxC 800 and the LX20 SYNCHRON Clinical System.
The method has not been certified or tested by the Cholesterol Reference
Method Laboratory Network. The package insert includes the following
statement: “This method has not been certified or tested by the Cholesterol
Reference Method Laboratory Network.”
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor performed a study designed to verify that the limit of detection
(LoD) has not changed as a result of changing to the new calibrator. The
study was performed in accordance with the recommendations of CLSI EP17-
A. The limit of the blank (LoB) was calculated from data using a blank
sample (5% human serum albumin solution) run in replicates of 20. The LoD
was calculated using a low level sample (a diluted commercially available
plasma-based standard) run in replicated of 20 on one UniCel DxC 800 and
one LX20 SYNCHRON Clinical System. The sponsor stated that 100% of
the replicates of the low level sample exceeded the calculated LoB.
The claimed LoD of the assay is 5 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Established in k040767
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Studies were performed to compare the performance of the proposed device to
the predicate device using 100 serum patient samples. The samples were run
in singlet on the proposed device using the UniCel DxC 800 and the LX20
SYNCHRON Clinical System and in replicates of 2 on the predicate device.
The results of the linear regression including the 95% confidence interval (CI)
are summarized below:
