L. Test Principle:
The CLL FISH Probe Kit uses FISH DNA probe technology to determine deletion
status of probe targets using CLL specimens for LSI TP53 SO (containing tumor
protein p53 gene-location chromosome 17p), LSI ATM SGn (containing ataxia
telangiectasia mutated gene-location at chromosome 11q), and LSI D13S319 SO
(containing marker D13S319-location at chromosome 13q), as well as determining
trisomy 12 with CEP12 SGn (D12Z3 alpha satellite at location chromosome 12p11.1-
q11).
Peripheral blood cells from CLL patients are attached to microscope slides using
2

--- Page 3 ---
standard cytogenetic procedures. The resulting specimen DNA is denatured to single-
stranded form and subsequently allowed to hybridize with the probes of the CLL
FISH Probe Kit. Following hybridization, the unbound probe is removed by a series
of washes, and the nuclei are counterstained with DAPI, a DNA-specific stain that
fluoresces blue. Hybridization of the LSI TP53 SO, LSI ATM SGn, LSI D13S319
SO, LSI 13q34 SA, and CEP 12 SGn probes is viewed using a fluorescence
microscope equipped with appropriate excitation and emission filters, allowing
visualization of the orange, green, and aqua fluorescent signals.
In a cell with normal copy numbers of the LSI TP53 SO and LSI ATM SGn probe
targets, two orange signals (LSI TP53 SO) and two green signals (LSI ATM SGn)
will be expected. Since both the ATM and TP53 loci seem capable of losing only one
copy while the other copy is retained, one orange signal (LSI TP53 SO) and/or one
green signal (LSI ATM SGn) serves as an internal control of this probe set.
In a cell with normal copy numbers of LSI D13S319 SO and CEP 12 SGn probe
targets, two orange signals (LSI D13S319 SO) and two green signals (CEP 12 SGn)
will be expected. The presence (not the quantity) of aqua signals is used as an
internal control of this probe set.
Enumeration of the LSI TP53 SO, LSI ATM SGn, LSI D13S319 SO, and CEP12
SGn signals provide a mechanism for determining absolute copy numbers of the
probe targets and the presence of the aberrations of interest. Any aberrations detected
are utilized to determine Döhner Classification and subsequently the dichotomization
of prognosis.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
i. Precision:
The precision of the probes in the Vysis CLL FISH Probe Kit was
evaluated in two (2) studies. The first study used interphase nuclei
prepared from two (2) separate peripheral blood specimens lacking
del(17p13.1), del(11q22.3), del(13q14.3), and trisomy 12, and eight
additional specimens of which at least two specimens had one of the listed
abnormalities at significant levels. A total of seven (7) tests were
performed with three lots of Vysis CLL FISH Probe Kit on two days, and
with one of the three lots on a third day. The second study consisted of
nine (9) tests performed using three different lots of Vysis CLL FISH
Probe Kit on three days on a blinded panel of eight different patient
specimens with low levels of specific cytogenetic abnormalities. In both
studies, the FISH signal patterns of 200 nuclei were evaluated by two
technologists for each specimen. Percentage of cells with the signal
pattern of interest was analyzed separately for each specimen per probe.
The mean and standard deviations (SDs) of the observed percentage of
abnormal cells for each specimen in both studies are summarized as
follows:

ii. Reproducibility:
Three individual laboratories tested a blinded 20-member slide panel
consisting of specimens representing each of the five Döhner
classifications:
• 13q- (monosomy or nullisomy) as sole abnormality
• No cytogenetic abnormality
• +12 without 17p- or 11q-
• 11q- without 17p-
• 17p-
The analysis was conducted with 10 slides per day for two days for a total
of six runs across three testing sites. The same lots of the Vysis CLL
FISH Probe Kit (Vysis LSI TP53 SpectrumOrange/ATM SpectrumGreen
and LSI D13S319 SpectrumOrange/13q34 SpectrumAqua/CEP 12
SpectrumGreen Probes) were tested at each laboratory. Results show that
there was no disagreement among the three testing sites in test results from
LSI TP53 SpectrumOrange and CEP 12 SpectrumGreen probes and two
disagreements among the three testing sites in test results from the other

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i. Real-time stability: One (1) lot of the Vysis CLL FISH probes and three
(3) lots of other components of the Vysis CLL FISH Probe Kit were tested
shortly after the respective expiration dating of the components under
intended storage conditions as follows:
Components Storage Condition Shelf life

DAPI II Counterstain -20°C ±10°C 12 months
NP-40 -20°C ±10°C 36 months
20X SSC -20°C ±10°C 60 months
The functionality of the Vysis CLL FISH Probe Kit components was
evaluated based on the following attributes: signal intensity, target
background, cross-hybridization, specificity, and overall readability. The
Vysis CLL FISH Probe Kit dating is determined by the component with
the shortest expiration dating. The shelf-life of Vysis CLL FISH Probe
Kit was determined to be 12 months.
The ongoing real-time Kit Stability Study tests three (3) lots of Vysis LSI
TP53 SO/LSI ATM SG probe and three (3) lots of the Vysis LSI D13S319
SO/LSI 13q34 SA/CEP12 SG probe. The functionality of the Vysis CLL
FISH Probes was tested in triplicate at each time point using metaphase
slides prepared from normal phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated
peripheral blood lymphocytes. The interim test results have demonstrated
7-month stability at the ISC for the Vysis LSI TP53 SO/LSI ATM SG

13q34 SA/CEP12 SG probe.
ii. Freeze-thaw Stability: A series of twenty freeze-thaw cycles (equal to the
number of assays in the kit) was performed on each CLL FISH Probe Kit
and the functionality of the CLL FISH Probe Kit components was
evaluated based on the following attributes: signal intensity, target
background, cross-hybridization, specificity, and overall readability. The
stability test showed no decrease in performance.
iii. Shipping stability. The stability test showed no decrease in performance
regardless of the method of shipment, (i.e. Ambient, Wet Ice, or Dry Ice).
iv. Hybridization signal stability: The slides prepared from normal male
PHA-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes were hybridized with Vysis
LSI CLL FISH probes (Vysis LSI TP53 SO/LSI ATM SG and Vysis LSI
D13S319 SO/LSI 13q34 SA/CEP12 SG) and then stored at -20°C ± 10°C
while protected from light. The hybridized slides were evaluated at Day 1,
Day 21, and Day 42 post-hybridization with respect to signal intensity,
target background, cross hybridization, specificity, and overall readability.
The results showed that the slides can be stored with desiccant for up to
three (3) weeks after the application of DAPI II Counterstain without
significant loss in fluorescence signal intensity or the ability to count the
signal patterns of 200 nuclei per slide.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity of the probes in the Vysis CLL FISH Probe Kit for
their respective chromosome target loci was established using interphase
nuclei prepared from peripheral blood cultures of 25 karyotypically normal
patients. For each specimen, the signal patterns of 200 nuclei were evaluated
by counting the number of orange and green signals present for each probe
target. Each of the two technologists evaluated 100 nuclei per specimen for a
total of 200 nuclei per specimen and 5000 scoreable nuclei from normal
specimens.
The sensitivity (with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on binomial
distribution) was calculated as the percentage of scoreable interphase nuclei
with the expected signal pattern of two signals per nucleus as follows:
Number of Nuclei
Total Number of Sensitivity
Probe With Expected
Nuclei Scored (95% CI)

Analytical specificity is defined as the percentage of signals that hybridize to
the correct locus and no other location. This test is a visual demonstration that
each probe hybridizes specifically to the expected chromosome location. The
analytical specificity of the Vysis CLL FISH probes for their respective
chromosome target loci was established using metaphase chromosomes
prepared from peripheral blood cultures of five karyotypically normal males
on microscope slides. The hybridization location of each FISH signal on
chromosomes of 20 consecutive metaphase nuclei on each of 5 slides was
evaluated by one technologist for a total of 200 target loci.
For each probe and sample, the number of metaphase chromosome FISH
signals hybridized to the correct locus and the number of metaphase
chromosome FISH signals hybridized to the incorrect locus were enumerated.
The specificity of each probe was calculated as the percentage of metaphase
chromosome FISH signals hybridized to the correct locus as follows:
Total No of No of Metaphase

f. Assay cut-off:
The normal cut-off values of the probes in the Vysis CLL FISH Probe Kit for
their respective chromosome target loci were established using interphase
nuclei prepared from peripheral blood cultures of 25 karyotypically normal
patients. For each specimen, the signal patterns of 200 nuclei were evaluated
by counting the number of orange and green signals present for each probe
target.
The expected normal interphase signal pattern for all probes in the Vysis CLL
FISH Probe Kit was two signals per nucleus. Since the specimen population
does not fit a Gaussian distribution, the normal cut-off value was calculated
using the beta inverse function as the maximum number or percentage of
scoreable interphase nuclei with a specific abnormal signal pattern at which a
specimen is considered normal for that signal pattern. The results are
summarized as follows:

c. Method concordance bridging studies:
A total of 64 de-identified specimens with Döhner classifications as
determined previously based on results from the Reference FISH Test (RFT)
were tested with the Vysis CLL FISH Probe Kit. They represent each of the
five Döhner classifications, including no cytogenetic abnormality (n=12), 13q-
(monosomy or nullisomy) as sole abnormality (n=13), +12 without 17p- or
11q- (n=14), 11q- without 17p- (n=18) and 17p- (n=7) based on previous
results using the RFT used in the Shanafelt study[a]. For each specimen tested,
two technologists each scored 100 nuclei for each hybridization target by
counting and recording the number of orange and green signals present in
each nucleus. The results of the two technologists for each specimen were
then combined to determine the Döhner class based on the specific abnormal
signal patterns observed. The results showed that Vysis CLL FISH Probe Kit
identified 38 of 39 specimens in Intermediate/Good prognostic category and
24 of 25 specimens in Poor prognostic category. The percent agreement
between the Vysis CLL FISH Probe Kit and RFT was 97% with a lower 95%
confidence boundary of 90%.

a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
Not applicable.
b. Other clinical supportive data (when a. is not applicable):
Prognostic claim of the Vysis CLL FISH Probe Kit is supported by literature.
In a prospective study, Shanafelt et al established the relationship between
Vysis CLL FISH results and overall 5-year survival (OS) in a cohort of
untreated, predominantly early-stage patients with CLL/small lymphocytic
lymphoma (SLL). A total of 159 patients with previously untreated CLL
(83% Rai stage 0/1) were enrolled in a prospective trial evaluating clonal
evolution by interphase FISH. Patients provided baseline and follow-up
specimens for interphase FISH testing during 2 to 12 years. Chromosome
abnormalities were detected by FISH testing at study entry in 120 of the 159
patients. Sixty-one patients had a single abnormality, 52 patients had two
abnormalities, and seven patients had three or more abnormalities. All
deletions were monoallelic except for the 13q14 region. In 41 (44%) of the 93
patients who had 13q- deletions there were biallelic or concomitant
monoallelic and biallelic deletions of 13q-. Chromosomal abnormalities
detected by Vysis CLL FISH Probe at study entry predicted overall 5-year
survival. Patients with 11q- or 17p- on baseline FISH had shorter expected
OS from diagnosis or baseline FISH analysis as compared to other FISH
categories. The results showed that patients with an initial FISH diagnosis of
17p- or 11q- had a poor prognosis and those with a FISH classification of
normal, 13q-, or +12 had a good/intermediate FISH prognosis. Multivariable
Cox regression analyses showed that FISH categories associated with survival
remained associated significantly with OS (poor v good FISH, P <0.00022)
