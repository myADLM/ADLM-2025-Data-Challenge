Specific antibodies attach to the antigens. After incubation the BIOCHIP slides are
washed with PBS-Tween to remove unbound antibodies. In the meantime, 20 μL of
fluorescein–labeled anti–human IgG are added to each reaction field of a clean
reagent tray and the BIOCHIP slides placed into the recesses of the tray. After a 30
minutes incubation at room temperature, the BIOCHIP slides are again washed with
PBS-Tween to remove any unbound fluorescein-labeled reagent. 10 μL of embedding
medium are placed for each reaction field on a cover glass and the BIOCHIP slides,
with the BIOCHIPs facing downwards, placed onto the prepared cover glass.
Fluorescence is read with a fluorescence microscope.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
The analytical performance of the assay was assessed using a fluorescence intensity
level scale which measures the intensity of the specific fluorescence expressed as a
numeric value. These values can vary from “0” (no specific fluorescence) to “5”
(extremely strong specific fluorescence). The evaluation of the fluorescence intensity
is performed according to the following table:
Intensity Evaluation
0 no specific fluorescence
1 positive reaction, very weak specific reaction visible
2 positive reaction, weak specific reaction visible
3 positive reaction, specific reaction well visible
4 positive reaction, strong specific reaction visible
5 positive reaction, very strong specific reaction visible
The samples used in the analytical and clinical studies were coded. Serological
results, clinical and patient data were not known to the technician when
performing the tests.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Intra-assay reproducibility was performed by 10-fold repeated measurements
of 6 characterized positive and negative serum samples (at fluorescence
intensity levels of 0, 1, 2, and 3). The variation in fluorescence intensity was
within +1 intensity level unit for type NMDA glutamate receptor antigen.
Inter-assay reproducibility was performed by repeated measurements of 6
characterized positive and negative samples (fluorescence intensity levels of
0, 2, and 3) at five different times (2 measurements per run). The variation in
fluorescence intensity was within +1 intensity level unit type NMDA
glutamate receptor antigen.
In a second inter-assay reproducibility study, four samples with anti-glutamate
receptor (type NMDA) antibodies near the cut-off (1-2 fluorescence intensity
units) were tested at five different times (2 measurements per run). Each result

Intensity	Evaluation

was read by three different technicians independently. The variation in
fluorescence intensity was within +1 intensity level unit for type NMDA
glutamate receptor antigen.
Lot-to-lot reproducibility was determined by measurement of 3 characterized
positive and negative serum samples (fluorescence intensity levels of 0, 3, and
4) with three different kit lots. The variation in fluorescence intensity was
within +1 intensity level unit for type NMDA glutamate receptor antigen.
In a second lot-to-lot reproducibility study, four samples with anti-glutamate
receptor (type NMDA) antibodies near the cut-off (1-2 fluorescence intensity
units) were tested (in duplicate) using three different lots. Each result was read
by three different technicians independently. The variation in fluorescence
intensity was within +1 intensity level unit type NMDA glutamate receptor
antigen.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There is no recognized standard or reference material for autoantibodies
against glutamate receptor (type NMDA).
Kit stability:
Accelerated stability studies were performed by storing three different kit lots
at 37°C and -20°C for 14 days. The kits stored at -20°C were used as a
reference. The kits were tested using both positive and negative samples. The
results showed that the kits were stable for 14 days at 37°C, which translates
into 2 years of stability at 4°C (Deshpande SS (1996) Enzyme Immunoassays
from Concept to Product Development, Chapman and Hall, International
Thomson Publishing, New York, page 388).
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference:
Three different samples (one negative, one weakly positive, and one positive)
were spiked with hemoglobin (up to 500 mg/dL), triglycerides (up to 2000
mg/dL), and bilirubin (up to 40 mg/dL). The deviation in fluorescence
intensity due to these spiked samples did not exceed +1 fluorescence intensity
level unit for rat hippocampus, rat cerebellum, and type NMDA glutamate
receptor antigens.
Cross-reactivity:
To investigate the extent of cross-reactivity of the anti-glutamate receptor
(type NMDA) assay kit, the following patient samples were tested: 9
autoimmune encephalitis, 15 infectious encephalitis, 3 anti-VGKC
autoimmune encephalitis, 2 anti-Ma2 autoimmune encephalitis, and one each
anti-GluR2, anti-CV2 autoimmune encephalitis, anti-zic4 cerebellar

degeneration, and anti-recoverin retinopathy. None of these samples exhibited
characteristic reactivity against anti-glutamate receptor (type NMDA). Some
nonspecific fluorescent staining against rat cerebellum and hippocampus was
observed with anti-VGKC, anti-GluR2, and anti-zic4 samples.
f. Assay cut-off:
Cut-off was determined using 17 clinically characterized serum samples from
patients with anti-glutamate receptor (type NMDA) autoimmune encephalitis.
All samples were found positive at a titer of 1:10 or at higher dilutions. 200
blood samples from healthy blood donors were all found to be negative.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
The diagnostic criteria for anti-glutamate receptor (type NMDA) encephalitis
included encephalitic signs with psychiatric symptoms (agitation, paranoid
thoughts, irritability, or hallucinations), seizures, CSF inflammation, and
exclusion of viral/bacterial etiology.
Study 1: 47 serum samples from the US from patients diagnosed with anti-
gluatamate receptor (type NMDA) encephalitis and controls with other
encephalopathies, including anti-VGKC and AMPA receptor encephalitis,
were examined. The panel comprised samples from 7 men and 40 women
with an average age of 17 years (age range: 5 to 42 years; 1 unknown). In
addition, sera of 100 adult healthy blood donors of mixed age and sex from
Germany were analyzed. All samples from patients with anti-glutamate
receptor (type NMDA) encephalitis (29 sera) were tested positive with the
transfected cells, while all disease control samples (18 sera) and healthy blood
donors (100 sera) were negative.
Study 2: In a retrospective study, 2990 patients were screened for clinical
symptoms of encephalitis of unknown origin. 5 of 6 samples fulfilling the
criteria (6 women with an average age of 23 years, age range: 18 to 31 years;
origin: Germany) were found positive for antibodies against glutamate
receptor (type NMDA). The results support the fact that anti-glutamate
receptor (type NMDA) encephalitis is a very frequent cause among these
patients.
Study 3: 8 samples from patients with anti-glutamate receptor (type NMDA)
encephalitis (origin: Germany) were investigated. The panel comprised
samples from 3 men and 5 women with an average age of 25 years (age range:
16 to 39 years). All samples were found positive for anti-glutamate receptor
(tpye NMDA).
Study 4: 9 samples from patients with anti-glutamate receptor (type NMDA)
encephalitis and 13 samples from patients with other encephalopathies (origin:
Italy) were investigated. The panel comprised samples from 8 men and 14
women with an average age of 47 years (age range: 9 to 89 years). All

samples from patients with anti-glutamate receptor (type NMDA) encephalitis
(9 sera) were tested positive with the transfected cells, while all disease
control samples (13 sera) were negative.

Overall specificity 131 131 negative 100.0% 97.2 – 100.0%
For these selected populations, sensitivity of the test was 98.1% and
specificity was 100% for the disorder. It is expected that sensitivity and
specificity would be lower in a screening population.
b. Other clinical supportive data (when a is not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
See assay cutoff
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The reference range in the normal population is negative at a 1/10 dilution of
serum.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
