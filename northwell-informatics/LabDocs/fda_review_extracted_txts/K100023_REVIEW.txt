2. Indication(s) for use:
The PROFILE®-V MEDTOXScan® Drugs of Abuse Test System consists of the
PROFILE®-V MEDTOXScan® Test Devices and the MEDTOXScan® Reader.
The PROFILE®-V MEDTOX Scan® Test Devices are one-step
immunochromatographic tests for the rapid, qualitative detection of one or more
of the following in human urine: Amphetamines, Barbiturates, Benzodiazepines,
Buprenorphine, Cocaine, Methadone, Methamphetamine, Opiates, Oxycodone,
Phencyclidine, Propoxyphene, THC (Cannabinoids), and Tricyclic
Antidepressants or their metabolites. The PROFILE®-V MEDTOXScan® Test
Devices can only be used with the MEDTOXScan® Reader. The MEDTOX
Scan® Reader is an instrument used to interpret and report the results of the
PROFILE®-V MEDTOXScan® Test Device. PROFILE®-V MEDTOXScan®
Test Devices cannot be visually read. The PROFILE®-V MEDTOXScan® Drugs
of Abuse Test System is for in vitro diagnostic use and is intended for
professional use only. It is not intended for use in point-of-care settings. The
PROFILE®-V MEDTOXScan® Drugs of Abuse Test System detects drug classes
at the following cutoff concentrations:

PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY (HPLC) OR LIQUID
CHROMATOGRAPHY / TANDEM MASS SPECTROMETRY (LC/MS/MS)
ARE THE PREFERRED CONFIRMATORY METHODS. CLINICAL
CONSIDERATION AND PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT SHOULD BE
APPLIED TO ANY DRUG OF ABUSE TEST RESULT, PARTICULARLY
WHEN PRELIMINARY POSITIVE RESULTS ARE OBTAINED.
The MEDTOXScan® Reader includes a Positive QC Test Device, a Negative QC
Test Device and a Cleaning Cassette. The MEDTOXScan ® Positive and
Negative QC Test Devices are intended to detect errors associated with the
MEDTOXScan® Reader and a contaminated contact imaging sensor (CIS), and
to verify that the CIS cleaning procedure using the MEDTOXScan® Cleaning
Cassette effectively removed any contamination.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The device is for in vitro diagnostic prescription use.
The assay is not designated for use in the point-of-care settings.
The PROFILE®-V MEDTOXScan® Tes devices cannot be visually read.
The PROFILE®-V MEDTOXScan® Drugs of Abuse Test System provides only
a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method
must be used in order to obtain a confirmation analytical result. Gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) or liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry
(LC/MS/MS) are the preferred confirmatory methods. Clinical consideration and
professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result,
particularly when preliminary positive results are obtained.
The positive and negative QC test devices should not be used to replace
performing QC using external liquid quality control materials.
4. Special instrument requirements:

L. Test Principle:
The PROFILE®-V MEDTOXScan® Drugs of Abuse Test System includes a
competitive, membrane-based immunochromatographic PROFILE®-V
MEDTOXScan® Test Device and the MEDTOXScan® Reader.
Antibody-Colloidal Gold: Mouse monoclonal antibodies bind to the drug being
tested.
Drug-Conjugates: Each drug to be tested was individually conjugated to bovine
serum albumin (BSA) or IgG. Each drug conjugate is immobilized on a test line at a
designated position on the membrane strip.
Control Line: Each test strip has anti-mouse antibody immobilized at the Control (C)
position of the membrane strip. The anti-mouse antibody will bind excess antibody-
colloidal gold, indicating that the reagents are working properly. When the urine
sample is placed in the sample well of a test strip, the dried antibody-colloidal gold
under the sample pad dissolves and the urine wicks up the white strips carrying the
reddish-purple antibody-colloidal gold with it.
The MEDTOXScan® Reader scans the test device and utilizes a contact imaging
sensor (CIS) to capture relative line intensities. Software algorithms and barcodes are
used to identify the test device, the drug tests associated with the test device and
whether the presence or absence of a line is associated with a negative or positive
result, respectively.

Negative Samples
When no drug(s) is present in the urine sample, the reddish purple antibody-
colloidal gold solutions migrate along the strip and bind to the respective drug
conjugate(s) immobilized on the membrane. Each strip has up to 4 drug test lines.
Labeled T1-T4. The binding of the antibody-colloidal gold to the drug conjugate
generates a line at the corresponding test position on the strip. The
MEDTOXScan® Reader will scan each test position and if a line is detected it
will return “NEG” on the display screen (or print out) next to the abbreviation for
the drug test, indicating a negative result.
Positive Samples
When drug(s) is present in the urine sample the antibody-colloidal gold binds to
the drug(s) before it migrates along the strip. When the antibody-colloidal gold
binds to the drug(s) in the urine, it cannot bind to the drug conjugate immobilized
on the membrane and no line is generated at the drug specific position in the
result window. The MEDTOXScan® Reader will scan each test position and if no
line is detected it will return “POS” on the display screen (or print out) next to the
abbreviation for the drug test, indicating a preliminary positive result.
Control Line (Valid or Invalid results)
Each test strip has an internal procedural control. A line must form at the Control
(C) position in the result window to indicate that sufficient sample was applied
and that the reagents are migrating properly. If a Control line does not form, the
test is invalid. The MEDTOXScan® Reader scans each control line and returns
“VALID” to the right of the drug test result to confirm that the control line was
detected. If no control line is detected it will return “INVALID” on the display
screen (or print out) next to the abbreviation for the invalid drug test, and no result
will be given for that drug test.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Urine stock solutions were prepared for each test compound by spiking
standard solution of known concentrations into negative pool urine. Each
stock solution concentration was confirmed by GC/MS or LC/MS/MS. The
stock solution was serially diluted into negative urine to obtain concentrations
of 50%, 75%, 125% and 150% of the cutoff. The prepared sample
concentrations were confirmed by GC/MS or LC/MS/MS. A total of 45 results
(3 readers x 3 aliquots for 5 days and one strip lot) were obtained for each
level. Testing was rotate between 8 operators. The results are presented in the
tables below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. This is a qualitative test.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Profile V quality control materials were previously cleared and are sold
separately. The sponsor specifies the quality control product in the “materials
required but not provided” section of the labeling.
No calibrators are required. The device is calibrated during the manufacturing
process.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical performance of the device around the cutoff is described in the
precision section 1.a above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was established by spiking various concentrations of
similarly structured drug compounds into drug-free urine. Results are
expressed as a minimum concentration of metabolite or compound required to
produce a response approximately equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the
assay. The percent cross re-activities of those compounds are presented
below:

tested can be found in the package insert.
Common Drugs
Drug free urine samples were spiked with the Profile V targeted drugs to
the concentrations of 50% and 125% of the cutoff concentrations. An
amount of 100,000 ng/mL of each common drug was added to the
preparation and assayed. Evaluations were performed in triplicate by in-

of the cutoff and 125% of the cutoff for each drug. Each sample was
assayed in triplicate. No negative interference due to pH was observed.
To test for possible positive and/or negative interference from specific gravity
drug free urine samples having specific gravity from 1.003, 1.015 and 1.030
were used. Each of these samples were divided into two aliquots for each
drug and spiked to 50% of the cutoff and 125% of the cutoff. No negative
interference due to specific gravity was observed.
