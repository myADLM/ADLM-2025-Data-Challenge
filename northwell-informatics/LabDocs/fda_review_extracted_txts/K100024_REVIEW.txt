M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision study on the UTI Detection Strips was performed at two clinical
sites with three operators at each site. The evaluation included four replicate
assays over five days for a total of twenty assays on each of three levels of
control, for a total of forty results from each site. All sample concentrations were
masked. Three lots of strips were used with each level of control. The specified
controls values are listed in the following table:

Results of evaluations by lay users are shown below in section 2a.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. This is a qualitative test.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability Studies:
Ongoing temperature and humidity stability studies are performed on the test
strips to validate the accelerated stability studies which preliminarily support a
two year shelf life. Three strip lots are tested at intervals up to two years.
Storage conditions are 15-30 oC (out of sunlight). Criteria are that the product
must read all control results as shown below to confirm the shelf life.
The labeling emphasizes that the test should be run immediately after the foil
pouch is opened.

e. Analytical specificity:
Potentially interfering substances were added to negative urine at the
concentrations specified below. Each urine sample was tested in replicates of
five (5) with Teco Diagnostics’ UTI Detection Strips. The following
substances at the concentrations shown did not affect assay results. Testing
was performed in the presence of leukocytes at the following leukocyte

f. Assay cut-off:
A sensitivity study was performed to evaluate the lower limits of detection for
each analyte on the UTI Detection Strips. Urine samples were spiked to
known concentrations of each analyte. These samples were then diluted to the
lowest positive concentrations that are indicated on the color chart. Each
sample was tested ten times total with three lots over three days.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Patient sample testing was performed by lay users at two point of care sites.
Each site selected fifty symptomatic lay users to test their own fresh urine
using the Teco Diagnostics UTI Detection Strips according to the package
insert and to collect samples of the same urine for clinic technicians. The
symptoms included at least one of the following: burning or pain during
urination, frequent urination or cloudy urine. After the lay user’s testing, one
clinic (healthcare professional) operator tested the urine sample using the
Teco UTI Detection Strips while the other clinic (healthcare professional)
operator tested the urine sample using the predicate device (Bayer Multistix
10 SG strips). All previous sample results and sample identity were masked
from the operator. In total, one hundred (100) specimens were tested. Each
site used a different lot of Urine Reagent Strips Lay users recorded results and
the questions listed on the Patient Questionnaire. The clinic personnel
recorded the results on the separate Patient Data Forms in order to mask
results. Comparative results are shown below:
