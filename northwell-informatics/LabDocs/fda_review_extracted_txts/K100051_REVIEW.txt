2. Indication(s) for use:
The Drug of Abuse Urine (Cassette/Cup) Test is a rapid qualitative immunoassay
for the detection of potential abuse of one or more drugs: Morphine/Opiates, and
Oxycodone (see list below). The device is intended for in vitro diagnostic home
use.
Abbreviation Test Calibrator Cutoff
MOR/OPI300 Morphine/Opiates Morphine 300 ng/mL
OXY100 Oxycodone Oxycodone 100 ng/mL
OXY300 Oxycodone Oxycodone 300 ng/mL
This assay provides only preliminary results. A more specific alternate chemical
method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) or Liquid chromatography/mass
spectrometry (LC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical
consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse
test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For over the counter (OTC) use
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable
I. Device Description:
The device is available in a cup or cassette format. The device consists of any
combination between one (1) to three (3) individual test strip(s) for the drug(s) being
tested. Each test strip in the device consists of 1) a colored conjugate pad containing
colloidal gold coupled with the anti-drug antibodies and 2) nitrocellulose membrane
containing a test line (T line) coated with the conjugated drug antigen and a control
line (C line). The C line serves as an internal quality control of the system and
appears as a colored band during test regardless of the presence of the drug.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s):
Alpha Scientific INSTANT-VIEW ® Oxycodone Urine Test
Alpha Scientific INSTANT-VIEW ® Morphine (300) Urine Test
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s):

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None Referenced
L. Test Principle:
The device employs lateral flow immunochromatographic technology and is based on
the principle of competitive binding. Drugs, if present in concentrations below the
cutoff level, will not saturate the binding sites of the antibody coated particles on the
drug specific test strips. The goat-anti-rabbit IgG antibody-coated particles will then
be captured by immobilized drug-specific conjugate. If the level of drug in the urine
specimen is below the cutoff concentration, the T line appears as a visible line. If the
level of drug in the urine specimen is above the cutoff, no T line develops. The
control line (C line) serves as an internal quality control of certain testing steps. It
should always appear as a colored band regardless of the presence of the drug if
enough sample volume has been added to the test and if sample has correctly
migrated up the test strip.

OTC Accuracy study – cup format

Over the counter (OTC) accuracy studies were carried out at three
independent sites. A total of 136 OTC users participated in the study. 40-50
OTC users ranging in age from 18 to 72 with diverse educational and
professional backgrounds participated at each site. 38% of the participants
were female and 62% were male.
Urine samples were prepared at the concentrations in the table below by
spiking drug(s) into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The concentrations of
the samples were confirmed by GC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into
individual containers and blind-labeled.
Each participant was provided with the package insert and 3 blind labeled
samples and devices. Each participant tested 3 samples for the 3 drugs. There
was no significant difference between the results at the 3 sites so data were
pooled and analyzed. The results are summarized below.

All OTC study participants completed questionnaires after they performed the
test and recorded their results. The questionnaires covered evaluation of the
package insert regarding the intended user, the directions for performing the
test, the ease of performing the test, directions for interpreting the results, and
ease of interpretation of the results. These questionnaires demonstrated that
the test instructions were easy to understand and that the testing procedure
was easy to perform and the results were easy to read.

ease of interpretation of the results. These questionnaires demonstrated that
the test instructions were easy to understand and that the testing procedure
was easy to perform and the results were easy to read.
The temperature strip that is part of the test cup was evaluated by the
participants at three sites. The participants that performed the temperature
evaluation were the same participants that performed the cup format
evaluation. Water samples were adjusted to different temperatures and added
to the sample cups. Participants read the temperature on the strip on the cup
and recorded the results. The testing monitor then immediately measured and
recorded the water temperature. The results demonstrated that 95.3% of the
participants accurately identified the temperature of the water using the
temperature strip on the test cup.
