I. Device Description:
The GSP Neonatal GALT kit consists of the following reagents (to perform 1152
assays):
• Neonatal GALT calibrators: prepared from sheep blood with GALT,
phosphoglucomutase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, DTT, and ProClin
300 as preservative. The hemoglobin concentration is approximately 170 g/L
prior to dispensing onto filter paper cassettes.
The six calibrators contain GALT activities of approximately 1, 3, 6, 9, 15 and
25 U/dL.
• Neonatal GALT controls: prepared from human and sheep blood with
preservative. The hemoglobin concentration is approximately 170 g/L prior to
dispensing onto filter paper cassettes.
The two controls contain approximate GALT activities of 4 and 13 U/dL.
• GALT Substrate Reagent - ß-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate,
uridine 5’-diphosphoglucose, galactose-1-phosphate, and DTT.
• GALT Assay Buffer - a ready-for-use buffer containing magnesium sulfate,
EDTA, tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane, Triton X-100, and preservative.
This kit contains calibrators manufactured from sheep blood components and controls
manufactured from sheep and human blood components. The sheep are from a closed
herd located in the USA. The human blood has been tested using FDA approved
methods or equivalent and found to be negative for hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-
hepatitis C and anti-HIV 1 and 2 antibodies

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Whole blood samples with clinically relevant GALT activities were used to
prepare dried blood spot samples. The samples (S1-S8) were chosen to cover
the measuring range of the GSP Neonatal GALT kit, which is from 2.5 to 25.0
U/dL. Samples 1-4 (S1-S4) were chosen to cover the medical decision
making level.
The GALT activities of the series of dried blood spot samples were measured
by three laboratorians with three GSP Neonatal GALT kit lots in 27 runs over
25 operating days using three GSP instruments (9 runs per instrument). Each
sample was measured in quadruplicates.
In this study one run equals a run of two plates tested 24 hours apart on the
same instrument with stored calibration. Within a run only one reagent lot was
used in order to assess the variation between lots. Separate estimations for the
precision of GSP Neonatal GALT assays were calculated with two options: a
full calibration curve in duplicate for each plate and a full calibration curve for
every batch of two plates.

* The sponsor stated that occasionally, a sample punched from a DBS does
not sink to the bottom of the plate well, but remains floating on the liquid
surface. The GALT activity measured from a well with a floating sample disk
is not reliable and during routine use the instrument will flag the sample. The
samples having floating disks were not rerun.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity study protocol and analysis for the GSP Neonatal GALT kit was
performed in accordance with CLSI document EP6-A: Evaluation of the
Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach,
Approved Guideline.
The claimed measuring range for this device is 2.50 U/dL to 25 U/dL.
A high activity sample was prepared by diluting sheep erythrocytes to Hb 17 g/L
following addition of GALT, PGM and G6PD enzymes. The low activity sample
contained sheep red blood cells without any added enzymes. 18 samples were
prepared that spanned the claimed measuring range by mixing the high activity
and low activity samples.
The series of samples were used to prepare dried blood spot samples by
dispensing the prepared samples onto filter paper and dried overnight.
The dried blood spot samples were tested in a single run in random order on one
day with one GSP Neonatal GALT kit lot. The samples were analyzed in 10
replicates.
A polynomial evaluation of linearity was used for the data analysis. The
assumption of constant variance across all levels is not fulfilled in the GSP
Neonatal GALT kit. Rather, the variance is proportional across different
measurement levels. Therefore, weighted regression models were used.
A linear regression line and second and third order polynomials were fitted to
the data. The results of regression analyses were compared. The significance
of the second and third order polynomials were evaluated by performing a t-

test. The third order regression has statistically significant nonlinear terms
(β2, β3) at a 95% significance level (p-value <0.05).
The results of regression analyses were compared. The fitted models are:
Linear: y = -0.68 + 34x
Second order: y = -0.73 + 35x - 1x2
Third order: y = -0.21 + 28x + 22x2 - 20x3
where y = GALT activity (U/dL) and x = dilution point.

For GALT activities over 4 U/dL, the maximum observed difference (%)
between the linear and 3rd order regression models is -2.6 %. For activities ≤ 4
U/dL, the maximum observed absolute difference between the models is 0.07
U/dL.
For GSP Neonatal GALT, the method has demonstrated the claimed
measuring range of the device as 2.5 – 25.0 U/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: There is no international conventional reference material that
can be used as the primary calibrator and no reference method that can be
used to assign values. Instead the GALT activity of the kit is traceable to the
in-house primary calibrators (dried blood spots). The activity of these

calibrators is based on Galactose-1-phosphate Uridyltransferase from
galactose-adapted yeast, added to the calibrator blood matrix.
Value assignment: The in-house reference materials used in the calibration
process of GSP Neonatal GALT kit include primary, secondary and level
calibrators and controls (QA and R controls). The primary calibrators are used
to monitor the level of the secondary and level calibrators.
The secondary calibrators are routinely used to establish the master curve
from which a new batch (lot) of kit calibrators will be assigned values. (QA
controls are used to validate the run.)
To accomplish assigning reagent lot specific values, level calibrators are
measured against the reagent lot calibration curve. Based on these results, the
values assigned for the kit calibrators are modified in such manner that each
reagent kit lot will display the same result when the level calibrators are used
as samples. (QA controls are used to validate the runs.)
Stability:
Accelerated and real-time shelf-life stability: Study protocols, preliminary
data and acceptance criteria for shelf-life stability testing were provided for
the Neonatal GALT kit components at the recommended storage temperature
(calibrators and controls at -30 to -16°C and kit reagents at 2-8°C) and at
elevated temperatures (4°C for calibrators and controls; 35°C for kit reagents)
and found to be acceptable. Based on the accelerated stability data, twelve
month shelf-life stability at the recommended storage temperatures is claimed
for the calibrators, controls and kit reagents. Real-time studies will continue to
confirm and extend the dating.
In-use and on-board stability: Study protocols, preliminary data and
acceptance criteria for in-use and on-board stability were provided for the
Neonatal GALT kit and found to be acceptable. Once opened, calibrators and
controls can be stored for 16 days at +2 to +8 °C in the original bag (protected
from light and moisture), and thereafter used in the GALT assay. Stability
data supports on-board storage of reagent cassette components (reconstituted
Substrate Reagent and GALT Assay buffer) up to 48 hours. Neonatal GALT
kit calibrators and controls punched into microtiter wells and on-board in the
plate storage module of the GSP instrument are stable up to 12 hours.
d. Detection limit:
The analysis of the limits of blank, detection and quantitation were performed
in accordance with CLSI document EP17-A: Protocols for Determination of
Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation.
Limit of Blank (LoB): Three lots of a blank specimen (blood from one adult
donor who is GALT deficient (classical galactosemia)) which contains no
GALT enzyme activity were used in determination of LoB. Dried blood spot

--- Page 10 ---
samples were prepared by dispensing the blank blood preparations on filter
paper and dried. Repeated measurements (n = 90/sample) were carried out
using three analyte free dried blood spot samples. The samples were measured
with three GSP Neonatal GALT kits using three GSP instruments. Nine
separate runs of three samples with ten replicates of each were performed over
three operating days. The samples were assayed against a full calibration
curve in each run.
The LoB for each kit lot tested was calculated separately. The largest LoB of
the three kit lots is used as the estimate. LoB is estimated to be 1.6 U/dL.
Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ): To prepare the
low-level samples for LoD and LoQ study, blood drawn from four apparently
healthy adults (with normal GALT activity) and blood drawn from an adult
with GALT deficiency were used. Five low activity samples were prepared by
diluting the normal samples with the GALT deficient specimen. The low-level
samples were dispensed on filter paper and dried.
For LoD repeated measurements n=1080 (n = 216/sample) were carried out
using five low level samples (dried blood spot samples on filter paper).
Altogether 27 runs were assayed over 25 operating days using three GSP
instruments and three GSP Neonatal GALT kit lots. The samples were
assayed against a full calibration curve. Two QA controls run in quadruplicate
(n = 4) were included in each plate and used for run acceptance. The low level
samples used to define the LoD samples were also used for determining the
LoQ.
The most conservative approach was taken in reporting the result.
Accordingly the largest LoD of the three kit lots is used as the estimate. Thus,
LoD was calculated to be 2.5 U/dL.
In absence of a recognized reference method, a functional sensitivity study
was used to define LoQ. LoQ is the lowest activity of GALT that can be
measured with acceptable total variation of the assay. The specification for
total variation (CV% ≤ 20 %) is fulfilled for all samples with activities equal
or higher than 1.8 U/dL, therefore,
LoQ = LoD
Therefore LoQ is estimated to be 2.5 U/dL.
The measuring range is demonstrated to be from 2.5 to 25 U/dL based on the
Limit of Quantitation and Linearity studies. Samples that result in values
below 2.5 U/dL are reported as “<2.5 U/dL”. These results are not
recommended to be considered accurate, but the specimen can be considered
screen positive for classical galactosemia.
Samples that result in values above 25 U/dL are reported as “>25 U/dL”.
These results are not recommended to be considered accurate, but the
specimen can be considered screen negative for classical galactosemia.

e. Analytical specificity:
The effect of the most essential interfering substances, bilirubin (unconjugated
and conjugated), lipemia, total protein, glutathione, ascorbic acid, galactose
and galactose-1-phosphate were evaluated. The characterization of the
susceptibility of the GSP Neonatal GALT assay to interference was performed
in accordance with CLSI document EP7-A2, Interference Testing in Clinical
Chemistry; Approved Guideline.
The test was performed using one lot of the GSP Neonatal GALT kit. Three
whole blood samples with clinically relevant GALT activities were used for
preparing dried blood spot samples (DBS) for the study.
The interfering substances and their highest concentrations tested are
described in the table below:
Approximate
Interference Added substance concentration of
High pool
Bilirubin Unconjugated Bilirubin 40 mg/dL
Conjugated bilirubin
Bilirubin 40 mg/dL
(ditaurobilirubin)
Lipemia Intralipid 1000 mg/dL
Total protein BSA 4000 mg/dL
Total protein HSA 4000 mg/dL
Glutathione Glutathione 75 mg/dL
Ascorbic Acid Ascorbic Acid 3 mg/dL
Galactose Galacose 50 mg/dL
Galactose-1-phosphate Galactose-1-phosphate 50 mg/dL
The tested substances were added to the three samples to create test sample
pools with high concentration of the interferent. Control pools were prepared
by adding the same amount of solvent to the test samples as was added to
create the high test pools. The blood pool with high concentration of added
substance and the control pool were used for preparing a dilution series in
order to measure the effect of the concentration of the potential interfering
factor. The five-level dose-response series was prepared. The GALT
activities of the dried blood spot samples were analyzed in twelve replicates
using one GSP Neonatal GALT kit lot.
Potential interference was evaluated using the paired-difference method. If
after evaluating potential interferents with this method, it appeared that the
added substance was shown to cause interference, the dilution series of the
tested substance were analyzed and the effect of the concentration of the
interfering factor was assayed. BSA, HSA, glutathione and galactose were
found to interfere with the measurement of GALT, therefore the dose-
response method was used to test these substances further.

[Table 1 on page 11]

Bilirubin	Unconjugated Bilirubin	40 mg/dL
Bilirubin	Conjugated bilirubin
(ditaurobilirubin)	40 mg/dL

Glutathione	Glutathione	75 mg/dL
Ascorbic Acid	Ascorbic Acid	3 mg/dL
Galactose	Galacose	50 mg/dL
Galactose-1-phosphate	Galactose-1-phosphate	50 mg/dL

--- Page 12 ---
Icteric (unconjugated bilirubin (≤ 40 mg/dL), conjugated bilirubin (≤ 40
mg/dL)) and lipemic (Intralipid solution, ≤ 1000 mg/dL) samples did not
interfere with the assay.
Ascorbic acid (≤ 3 mg/dL) and galactose (≤ 50 mg/dL) did not interfere with
the assay at tested concentrations.
Glutathione did not interfere up to concentration of 18.8, 37.5 and 56.3 mg/dL
at sample GALT activities of 3, 6 and 12 U/dL, respectively. Glutathione
concentrations above these levels caused a decrease of up to 63% in GALT
activity.
Galactose-1-phosphate (GAL-1-P) had no effect on the low GALT activity
sample (3 U/dL), while a GAL-1-P concentration of 12.5 mg/dL interfered
with the result of the samples with GALT activities 6 and 12 U/dL. The
measured GALT result decreased up to 37%.
Total protein (HSA) had no effect on the high (12 U/dL) GALT activity
sample. HSA did not interfere up to added concentration of 3000 mg/dL
blood, which is approximately two times higher than the normal endogenous
concentration of normal neonates, at sample GALT activities 3 and 6 U/dL.
HSA concentrations above this level caused an increase up to 30% in GALT
activity
Hematocrit: The effect of hematocrit was tested by adjusting the amount of
red blood cells with plasma in three whole blood samples with different
GALT activities (approximately <1, 6 and 15 U/dL), and testing the samples
for GALT activity according to CLSI document EP7-A, see table below.
Hematocrit % Sample 1 Sample 2 Sample 3
(approximate value) U/dL n U/dL n U/dL n
35 0.99 12 7.3 12 13.2 12
44 0.37 12 6.5 11 14.9 12
53 0.00 12 5.6 12 15.4 10
62 0.00 11 5.0 12 15.6 12
70 0.00 12 4.6 11 15.2 12
Samples with low GALT activity might get slightly elevated or lowered
results from the GSP Neonatal GALT assay due to differences in the
hematocrit level. GALT activity is in the red blood cells and hence the GALT
activity varies based on hematocrit level.
However, hemoglobin is known to absorb part of the excitation and emission
light. In samples with normal GALT activity the change in hematocrit is
compensated with the hemoglobin effect. In samples with low GALT activity
there is not enough GALT activity to overcome the quenching effect of
hemoglobin and thus the samples with low GALT activity and low hematocrit

[Table 1 on page 12]
Hematocrit %
(approximate value)	Sample 1		Sample 2		Sample 3	
	U/dL	n	U/dL	n	U/dL	n

may result in elevated results and samples with low GALT activity and high
hematocrit may result in lower results.
The differences in hematocrit level have no effect on the screening
classification of samples that lack GALT activity (classical galactosemia).
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The comparator device is the Neonatal GALT (k950803) (formerly known as
Isolab Galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase test kit). Prospective,
leftover, routine screening samples as well as retrospective archived positive
samples were included in the study. The total number of acquired samples is
comprised of 2146 routine screening samples collected prospectively, 33
presumptive positive or borderline retrospective samples.
The clinical diagnosis for two of the retrospective presumptive positive
specimens was classical galactosemia. 32 of the retrospective presumptive
positive specimens were from newborns with Duarte galactosemia and one
specimen was from newborn carrier for Classical Galactosemia. One routine
screening specimen was confirmed to be Duarte Galactosemia.
The specimens were analyzed during 8 operating days. Each patient specimen
was analyzed in singlicate using both the GSP Neonatal GALT kit and the
predicate. The retrospective positive and borderline specimens were
dispersed throughout the multiple assay runs. One lot of each device was
used.
0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.5% percentile cut-offs were reviewed.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Screening specimens that result in values at or below cut-off should be considered
as presumptive positives for classical galactosemia and retested immediately. If
upon retest the GALT value is still at or below cut-off, the specimen should be
considered screen positive for classical galactosemia. Confirmation of screen
positives should be by a diagnostic test procedure.
If an assay is available to test for total galactose, it should also be run. If the
specimen is positive for the total galactose assay, the specimen should be
considered positive for classical galactosemia. Follow local requirements for
follow-up testing.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
GALT values by percentile from the testing completed with the Neonatal GALT
kit at a U.S. state laboratory:
Lower percentiles

GALT 24.7
(U/dL)
It should, however, be remembered that cut-off values of GALT in dry blood
spots may vary between different tests and different populations. Therefore, it is
recommended that each laboratory establishes its own reference range and cut-off
limit from a representative sample population.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
