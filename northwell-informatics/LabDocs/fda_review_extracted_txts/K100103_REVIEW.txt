K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced. (if applicable):
CLSI, EP5-A2-Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement
Methods; Approved Guidelines-Second Edition
L. Test Principle:
The control plasma may be used when performing tests on manual assays, mechanical
or photo- optical coagulation instruments in conjunction with suitable commercial
reagents.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed at Helena Laboratories with three operators,
using various reagent systems and analyzers. Duplicate determinations of all
analytes were made on five vials from four lots of control, as described in
CLSI, EP5-A2. All parameters fell within acceptance criteria (CV of ≤ 15%).
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Assays are acceptable if the mean values are as follows:
Assay Mean Value
Prothrombin Time (PT) ≥14.0 seconds
Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) >35.0 seconds
Factor Assays ≤50 %
Fibrinogen ≤ 140 mg/dL
Rocket vonWillebrand Factor Antigen ≤50%
Rocket Protein C ≤50%
Rocket Protein S ≤50%
Rocket Protein S (Free) ≤50%
Ristocetin Cofactor ≤50%
ELISA Protein C ≤50%
ELISA Protein S, S (Free), Monoclonal Free S ≤50%
ELISA vonWillebrand Factor Antigen ≤50%
Stability studies were performed on each analyte using duplicate
determinations on three vials from each of three lots of control. Each anaylte
was tested at 0 hours and at 4.5 hours with storage at 2 to 8°C. Acceptance
criteria for the studies was defined as falling within assigned range and for the
4.5 hour data point to be within 20% of the 0 hour data point. All parameters
fell within acceptable performance.
