Patient samples, whole blood or plasma, are dispensed by the operator into the
designated area on the reagent cartridge. The instrument combines the patient sample,
the antibody coated magnetic particles, and the alkaline phosphatase conjugate and
incubates the mixture for 5 minutes at 37°C. During this incubation, the analyte in
the patient sample binds to the antibody on the coated particles, and the alkaline
phosphatase conjugate binds to the analyte-antibody coated-particle.
After the incubation, the instrument performs Bound/Free (B/F) separation using
Magtration® technology to remove any excess unbound reagents. The
chemiluminescent substrate is then added. The substrate is catalyzed by the bound
alkaline phosphatase, which results in emission of photons.
The photo-multiplier tube in the PATHFAST instrument detects the photons that are
emitted during the reaction. The chemiluminescent count is converted to analyte
concentration values by the instrument based on the master calibration curve for the
reagent lot.

Point of care precision studies
Point of care precision studies were performed externally at three non-laboratory
sites by physician assistants and medical office personnel to support the device’s
point of care claim.
Testing was performed at the three sites with 6 trained users (2 different operators
for each POC site). Precision testing was conducted using 2 levels of control (n =
10 at each site) for 5 days per site. The following tables summarize the combined
day to day and site to site results.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies were conducted on both whole blood and plasma samples.
The linearity studies supported the sponsor’s claimed assay range of 0.019 to
50 ng/mL.
For the whole blood study, lithium heparin whole blood samples with low and
high values were diluted to produce 11 dilutions with values ranging from
0.013 to 50.1 ng/mL (n = 44). Slope = 1.01 (95 % CI = 1.00 – 1.02), intercept
= 0.00 (95% CI = 0.00 – 0.00). The % recoveries for all samples ranged from
92.1 to 109.2 %.
For the plasma study, lithium heparin plasma samples with low and high
values were diluted to produce 11 dilutions with values ranging from 0.0007
to 55.9 ng/mL (n = 44). Slope = 1.00 (95 % CI = 0.99 to 1.01), intercept =
0.00 (95% CI = 0.00 – 0.00). The % recoveries for all samples ranged from
92.4 to 103.1 %.
A hook effect study was conducted to assess samples above the range of the
test. Samples were prepared by spiking troponin antigen purified from human

heart muscle into a buffer solution to 44,900 ng/mL. Serial dilutions were
prepared with buffer solution. Theoretical concentrations of troponin in the
sample were calculated from the initial concentration of the spiked sample and
the dilution factor. The sponsor reports that samples between 50 ng/ml to
44,900 ng/mL return results above the range of the test.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The cTnI-II assay is traceable to NIST standard SRM 2921. The primary
calibrators are used to determine the concentration of the master calibrators
that are prepared in house. The master calibrator’s concentrations are verified
using three PATHFAST instruments calibrated with the primary calibrators.
The master calibrators are used to determine the concentration of the stock
solutions for the working calibrators. The stock solution for the working
calibrators is prepared in the same manner previously described. The working
calibrators are prepared by diluting the stock solution to six specified levels of
the test. Working calibrators are used to determine the concentration of the
product calibrators. Concentrations are verified using three PATHFAST
instruments calibrated with working calibrators. The product calibrators are
prepared in lyophilized form at two levels for each test.
Stability
The sponsor conducted studies to determine the stability of the calibrators
before reconstitution at 8º C. The stability studies support the sponsor’s
claimed stability of 12 months when stored refrigerated. The sponsor
conducted open vial studies for the calibrators after reconstitution with the
calibrator diluent. The studies supported the sponsor’s claimed stability that
reconstituted calibrators are stable for 3 days at 2-8 C and up to one month at -
20º C or lower.
d. Detection limit:
LoB/LoD/LoQ studies were conducted using both lithium heparin plasma and
whole blood samples. The study for whole blood utilized 8 PATHFAST
instruments and one reagent lot. The LoB was determined by testing 60
replicates of a blank sample. The LoD was determined by testing 5 low
samples in triplicate on 7 PATHFAST instruments. The LoQ was determined
by identifying the lowest cTnI concentration of the LoD samples that showed
less than 10 % CV. An identical study was performed using plasma samples.
The statistics are presented in the table below.
9

--- Page 10 ---
a LoB = mean + 1.645*SD
b LoD = LoB + 1.645* pooled SD
c LoQ = minimum cTnI concentration with % CV < 10 %
The measuring range of the cTnI-II assay is from 0.019 ng/mL to 50 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Samples with interfering endogenous substances at several levels in human
Li-heparinized plasma samples were combined with plasma samples at 3
levels of troponin. Troponin levels were approximately 0.9 ng/mL, 5 ng/mL
and 21 ng/mL. Samples were tested on the PATHFAST instrument. The
measurement obtained was compared to the expected value, which is the value
of the plasma samples with no interfering substances added. No significant
interference as defined by recovery of +/- 10% was observed with bilirubin-
conjugated and free (60 mg/dL), hemoglobin (1000 mg/dL), rheumatoid factor
(500 IU/mL) and triglyceride (1000 mg/dL).
Cross reactivity was studied using potentially cross-reacting substances. The
substances were added to a human normal Li-heparin plasma samples free
from cTnI. Cross–reactivity was calculated as the apparent analyte
concentrations divided by the working concentration of the cross-reactants.

f. Assay cut-off:
This assay has 2 claimed clinical cutoffs. One cutoff (0.264 ng/mL) was
determined in feasibility studies by ROC analysis and validated as described
below. The second cutoff (0.029 ng/mL) is the 99th percentile of the reference
interval for normal. See also Clinical cut-off section below.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were performed at three non-laboratory sites by
physician assistants and medical office personnel.
Testing was performed at three sites with 6 trained users (2 different operators
for each POC site). Method comparison testing was conducted with 57 lithium
heparin plasma samples previously tested with the predicate method tested
using the cTnI-II assay. Twenty samples were tested at each of the 3 sites.
Samples with values outside of the measuring range were removed from the
analysis of the data. The following table summarizes the Passing-Bablok
regression results.

b. Matrix comparison:
The sponsor conducted a matrix study to compare whole blood samples that
were collected from patients in lithium heparin, sodium heparin, EDTA-Na
and EDTA-K tubes. Plasma samples were prepared from each whole blood
samples and were tested on the PATHFAST tests. Troponin values for the
lithium heparin plasma samples (n=83) ranged from 0.020 to 46.3 ng/mL. 20
samples with values near the 99% cutoff and 10 samples with values near the
ROC cutoff were included in the studies. Passing-Bablok regression analysis
was performed with lithium heparin plasma as the reference matrix. The
results in the tables below show acceptable correlation between lithium
heparin plasma and other matrices.

performed according to ESC/ACC guidelines. Serial heparinized plasma
specimens were collected from 333 patients within 12 hours of presentation to
the ER. The blood sample collection times were at 0-2 hours, 2-6 hours and 6-
12 hours of presentation to the ER. The group consisted of 72 patients with
AMI and 261 without AMI. Clinical sensitivity and specificity were
calculated based on both the ROC cutoff (0.264 ng/mL) and the 99th % cutoff
(0.029 ng/mL) by time intervals after presentation to the ER. The results for
the two cutoffs are presented in the tables below.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
4. Clinical cut-off:
This assay has 2 claimed clinical cutoffs. One cutoff (0.264 ng/mL) was
determined in feasibility studies by ROC analysis and validated as described
below. The second cutoff (0.029 ng/mL) is the 99th percentile of the reference
interval for normal.
The ROC cutoff was pre-established in a feasibility study consisting of 250
patients. The group consisted of 65 patients with acute myocardial infarction
(AMI) and 185 patients without AMI. The value of 0.264 was selected as the
appropriate cutoff value.
See section M5 below for additional information about how the 99th percentile
reference interval cutoff was determined.
The sponsor presents the clinical performance for both the ROC cutoff and 99th%
cutoff in the labeling. In addition, the sponsor states the following in the labeling:
• when using the 99th % cut-off, the PATHFAST cTNI-II test should be
interpreted with at least 2 serial samples.
• when using the ROC cut-off, the PATHFAST cTNI-II test should be
interpreted with 3 serial samples.
• when samples are collected in the early hours, it is not advisable to use the
higher (ROC) cut-off.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor conducted a reference range study to determine the 99th percentile at
three sites within the US. Samples from 490 apparently healthy volunteers were
collected and analyzed on the PATHFAST cTn-II assay. The sponsor’s non-
parametrical analysis represents the 99th percentile of the population tested. The
upper 99th percentile of the reference interval was 0.029 ng/mL (95% confidence
interval of 0.020 to 0.056).
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
