3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use.
See expected values section, below regarding interpretation of results.
The manufacturer includes the following in the package insert:
On average, the assay is designed so that bias for patient samples relative to LC-
MS/MS systems is within 0 to ±10%. However, as with other immunosuppressant
immunoassays, caution should be exercised because results for individual patient
samples may vary (in a positive or negative direction) due to the difference in
metabolite accumulation or other errors.
The QMS Everolimus Assay is calibrated based on a training set of trough
samples from adult renal transplant patients co-administered with cyclosporine,
basiliximab induction therapy and corticosteroids. Relative to LC-MS/MS,
comparison for patients under different conditions has not been evaluated and
may be different. Comparability to LC-MS/MS has not been evaluated in
pediatric patients and may be different due to differences in metabolism.
The assay is indicated ONLY for renal transplant patients, and performance has
not been determined for any other type of patients.
The assay should not be used on patients who have recently been administered

sirolimus (until sirolimus parent compound and metabolites are fully cleared)
since the assay cross-reacts with sirolimus and its metabolites.
Certain conditions, such as hepatic impairment, that can affect the parent
compound to metabolite ratio in patient samples may affect performance (e.g. bias
relative to an LC-MS/MS assay). For such patients, consider confirming results
with an LC-MS/MS method specific for the parent compound.
Test findings should always be assessed in conjunction with the patient's medical
history, clinical examinations and other findings.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Performance was evaluated on the Roche Hitachi 917.
I. Device Description:

L. Test Principle:
The QMS Everolimus Assay is a homogeneous particle-enhanced turbidimetric
immunoassay based on competition between drug in the sample and drug coated onto
a microparticle for antibody binding sites of the everolimus antibody reagent. The
principle is based on everolimus-coated microparticle reagent agglutinating in the
presence of the anti-everolimus antibody reagent and in the absence of any competing
drug in the sample. The rate of absorbance change is measured photometrically at a
wavelength of 700 nm. When a sample containing everolimus is added, the
agglutination reaction is partially inhibited, slowing down the rate of absorbance
change. A concentration-dependent classic agglutination inhibition curve can be
obtained with maximum rate of agglutination at the lowest everolimus concentration
and the lowest agglutination rate at the highest everolimus concentration.
The approach taken by the manufacturer was that QMS Everolimus calibrators and
controls were value-assigned by using a representative set of clinical trough samples
from renal transplant patients with traceability to LC-MS/MS values. Limitations
associated with this approach are described in the package insert.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Performance was validated on the Hitachi 917.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Everolimus samples were used for precision testing, following a CLSI
protocol. A tri-level human hemolysate-based control containing Everolimus,
and 3 renal transplant patient whole blood sample pools were assayed on the
Hitachi 917 for this study at the manufacturer’s site. For 20 non-consecutive
days, each sample was run in duplicate. After a minimum of two hours within
the same day, the samples were run again in duplicate, resulting in a total of
80 replicates. Each replicate was separately extracted. Calibration was
performed initially and at intervals (n=4) throughout the precision evaluation.
Results are tabulated below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity/recovery by dilution:
Linearity was determined by diluting renal transplant patient samples
(containing near 20 ng/mL as determined by an LCMSMS method) with
hemolysate negative for everolimus, to yield 10 concentrations spanning the
assay range from < 2 to near 20 ng/mL. Each dilution was tested in triplicate
using the QMS® Everolimus Assay on two instruments using two calibration
curves per instrument (for a total n=12). Sample extractions were performed
after preparation of each dilution. The averaged percent recovery, standard
deviation, and %CV are shown below.
Within the concentration ranges of 2.36 ng/mL to 20 ng/mL, recoveries relative
to expected concentrations (based on the high sample concentration and the
dilution factor) were within +/- 10%, and no trends in recovery were observed.
At lower measured concentrations (<2 ng/mL) recoveries were near 115%.

Results shown above are based on dilution of patient samples. The
manufacturer will note in the labeling that recovery studies with gravimetrically
prepared spiked everolimus samples will under-recover significantly.
The LoQ study described below (see Detection Limit) further demonstrated that
recovery at 2.0 ng/mL was observed to be within +/-15% of the theoretical
value. The claimed measuring range is 2 to 20 ng/mL.
High sample dilution:
A manual dilution study was conducted to verify the dilution procedure
recommended in the package insert. Five patient samples containing
concentrations near the high end of the assay were diluted 1:1 using the QMS®
Everolimus Calibrator A (0.0 ng/mL Everolimus) and were then extracted. The
samples were assayed undiluted and diluted using the QMS® Everolimus
Assay. Each was run in triplicate. The recovery was calculated as follows:
(Recovered value) x (dilution factor) = Calculated value
The % difference and % Recovery were then calculated.

Calibrator and control composition:
The QMS calibrator set consists of six levels of human whole blood
hemolysate with everolimus using purified material from the drug
manufacturer. Controls are prepared from the same types of materials. Also
see device description above.
Calibrator and control value assignment and traceability:
Initially, calibrator values were assigned by comparison of results of a patient
sample set to an LCMSMS method, and adjustment of the assigned calibrator
assigned values to minimize average bias relative to LCMSMS results. The
sample set used for calibration consisted of trough samples from adult kidney
transplant patients included in the initial Everolimus drug trials. Master
calibrators values are traceable to these initially assigned values. Subsequent
calibrator preparations are value assigned on the Hitachi 917 by ratio testing
to the Master Calibrators. The ratio for the subsequent calibrator value must
be 1.00+/-0.05 ng/mL for Cal B relative to the master calibrator and 1.00 +/-
0.02 ng/mL for all other levels.
The sponsor’s estimated uncertainty of kit calibrators values used throughout
the studies in the 510(k) is 0.2 ng/mL (for lower concentration calibrators) to
< 0.7 ng/mL (for higher concentration calibrators).
The manufacturer notes in the package insert that third party control material
containing spiked values of everolimus will not give the appropriate results
when used in conjunction with the QMS Everolimus Assay, unless the values
have been defined for the QMS Everolimus Assay. In addition, using the
QMS Everolimus Assay calibrators and controls in analytical methods other
than the QMS Everolimus Assay is not appropriate, as this would result in
incorrect values being obtained.
Control materials are assigned by assaying each level on a Hitachi 917 clinical
chemistry analyzer with five replicates per run, two runs per day for four days
within a two week period. At least two operators, two lots and two
instruments are used. Manufacturer’s ranges included in the package inserts
are determined based on analyses of these results. The package insert states
that each laboratory should determine its ranges for each new lot.
Calibrator and control stability:
Results supporting the current claimed calibrator storage stability of 12
months (closed vial) at -20 degrees C were included in the 510(k). At each
time point, test calibrators stored at -20 degrees C (the test temperature) were
used to calibrate the assay and control material stored at a lower known stable
temperature (-80 degrees C) was measured. Control recovery at each time
point was compared to the zero time point. No trends in changes in recovery
were observed over this time period.
10

--- Page 11 ---
Results supporting the current claimed calibrator storage stability of six weeks
at 2-8 degrees C (opened vial) were included in the 510(k). At each time
point, test calibrators stored at 2-8 degrees (the test temperature) were used to
calibrate the assay and control material stored at a lower temperature (-20
degrees C) was measured. Control recovery at each time point was compared
to the zero time point. No trends in changes in recovery were observed.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of quantitation was evaluated using patient samples with everolimus
values known based on the LCMSMS method used in the drug clinical trials.
Three kit lots were used in this evaluation. Samples with six levels of
everolimus surrounding the estimated LoQ were measured with the QMS
assay over five days with two runs per day. Recoveries for the sample closest
to 2 ng/mL (1.8 ng/mL as determined by the LCMSMS method used during
the everolimus drug clinical trials) ranged from 89% to 109% for the three lots
measured.
Results are shown in the table below:

Lot 3 1.7 9.1 12.9 (5.9 to 95

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were conducted using CLSI protocol EP7-A2 as a guideline.
Cross-reactivity was tested for major metabolites of everolimus. Other medications
routinely administered with everolimus and endogenous substances were also
tested to determine whether these compounds affect the quantitation of everolimus
concentrations using the QMS Everolimus assay. The sponsor defined interference
or cross-reactivity as ND (not detectable) if the difference between test and control
samples was smaller than the SD of repeat control samples.
Cross-reactivity:
The cross-reactivity of the QMS Everolimus assay to everolimus metabolites was
evaluated. The compounds tested were added in two concentrations (5 ng/mL and

concentrations were based on average of 5 replicates. The results are shown below
in the table below:

Cross-reactivity with sirolimus and its metabolites was also tested. Observed
cross-reactivity ranged from 39 – 46% for parent sirolimus, 36-35% for a
mixture of 41-O-desmethyl sirolimus and 32-O-desmethyl sirolimus, 11-12%
for 11-hydroxy sirolimus and < 10% for other sirolimus metabolites. The
manufacturer notes in the labeling that the test should not be used on samples
from patients who have recently been administered sirolimus, until sirolimus
and its metabolites have been completely cleared.
Other exogenous compounds tested:
Other compounds tested for interference were spiked into normal human
hemolysate containing everolimus (at concentrations of 5 ng/mL, and in some
cases 0, and 2.6 ng/mL). Samples were assayed by QMS in triplicate and
mean results compared to control samples without the test compounds.

for everolimus use in kidney transplant patients. Samples were trough
samples from 121 adult renal transplant patients. Results below are based on
analysis of single measurements of each sample by each method. (Analyses
showed there was no significant affect of within-patient correlation on
results). Also see the site to site comparison in the Precision/Reproducibility
section above.

study.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable. The assay is intended for use with EDTA whole blood only.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable; Clinical sensitivity and specificity is not typically provided in
510(k)s for this type of assay.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Data regarding patient demographics and selection criteria were provided in
the method comparison evaluation in the 510(k).
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable; this is a quantitative assay.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The following is stated in the package insert:
The recommended everolimus therapeutic range specified in the Zortress®
package insert is 3 to 8 ng/mL for prophylaxis of organ rejection in adult patients
at low to moderate immunologic risk receiving a kidney transplant. This range is
recommended when Zortress® is administered in combination with basiliximab
induction and concurrently with reduced doses of cyclosporine and
corticosteroids. Kidney transplant patients achieving everolimus whole blood
trough concentrations less than 3.0 ng/mL (as determined by an LC-MS/MS

assay) are at increased risk for rejection.
The QMS Everolimus assay has been calibrated using a set of trough samples
from adult renal transplant patients administered everolimus in combination with
basiliximab and concurrently with reduced doses of cyclosporine and
corticosteroids, so that on average results for these specimens will be within +/-
10% of an LC-MS/MS system.
Test findings should always be assessed in conjunction with the patient's medical
history, clinical signs and symptoms, and other laboratory parameters. Everolimus
values cannot be used as the sole indicator for making changes in treatment
regimen.
Values obtained with different methods cannot be used interchangeably due to
differences in methods and cross-reactivity with metabolites, nor should
correction factors be applied. Consistent use of the same assay for individual
patients is strongly recommended.
Optimally, dose adjustments of everolimus should be based on trough
concentrations obtained 4 or 5 days after a previous dosing change. See the drug
package insert for further information, including potential drug interactions.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
