H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Focus Diagnostics Simplexa™ Influenza A H1N1 (2009) assay is intended for
use on the 3M Integrated Cycler as part of the Microfluidic Molecular System for the
in vitro qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A and 2009 H1N1
influenza viral RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), nasal swabs (NS), and
nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from human patients with signs and symptoms of
respiratory infection in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as
the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2009-2010
influenza season when 2009 H1N1 influenza was the predominant influenza A virus
in circulation. When other Influenza A viruses are emerging, performance
characteristics may vary.
If infection with a novel Influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities,
specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for
novel virulent Influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for
testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility
is available to receive and culture specimens
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as intended use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
To be used with the 3M Integrated Cycler with Integrated Cycler Studio Software
version 2.1 or higher and either a Roche MagNA Pure LC automated nucleic acid
extraction system or the Qiagen QIAamp® Viral RNA Mini Kit.
I. Device Description:
The Simplexa™ Influenza A H1N1 (2009) assay is a nucleic acid amplification test
that uses real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to
detect and differentiate influenza A and 2009 H1N1 influenza from nasopharyngeal
swab (NPS), nasal swab (NS) and nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) specimens.

--- Page 3 ---
Patient specimens are collected and placed in sterile viral transport media containing
protein stabilizer, antibiotics to inhibit bacterial and fungal growth, and buffer
solution. An extraction control (AR IC) is added to the specimen prior to nucleic acid
extraction by either the MagNA Pure Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Roche) or a
Qiagen QIAamp® Viral RNA Mini Kit.
Specific lots of the ancillary reagent of the MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid
Isolation Kit and QIAamp® Viral RNA Mini Kit will be qualified on an ongoing basis
as part of the kit release process. The list of acceptable ancillary reagents will be
maintained on the Focus Diagnostics website (www.focusdx.com).
NOTE: The SimplexaTM Influenza A H1N1 (2009) assay product performance
requires that only qualified manufacturer lots of the MagNA Pure LC Total
Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit and QIAamp® Viral RNA Mini Kit be used with the
device. Any lots not specifically qualified by Focus Diagnostics for use with the
SimplexaTM Influenza A H1N1 (2009) assay are not validated for use with this
assay, and may cause erroneous results.
A sample of the extracted nucleic acid is added to the Simplexa™ Influenza A H1N1
(2009) reagents that contain a primer and a bi-functional fluorescent probe-primer set
specific to the matrix gene of influenza A viruses and the hemagglutinin gene of 2009
H1N1 influenza, and a second primer pair specific to the SPC sequence. PCR
amplification is performed on the 3M integrated cycler. The instrument fluorescence
output is analyzed and test results are determined using Integrated Cycler Studio
Software.
Simplexa™ Influenza A H1N1 (2009) kit contains Primer Mix (PM), RNA Master
Mix (RMM), RT Mix (RT), Armored RNA Internal Control (AR IC), No Template
Control (NTC) , and H1N1 positive control (PC), Simplexa™ Influenza A H1N1
(2009) Barcode Card, and Package Insert.
Interpretation of Sample Results:
Reporting results is a three step process.
1. Determine if the run is valid by examining the H1N1 Positive Control, No
Template Control, and Armored RNA Internal Control.
Criteria for a Valid Control (Simplified)*

--- Page 4 ---
a. If the No Template Control is:
i. Positive (Ct value ≤ 40, ≠ 0 for either the H1N1 or FLUA), then this
indicates possible contamination of prepared samples. The control is
invalid and all patient specimens must be re-extracted and re-assayed.
ii. Negative for H1N1 and FLUA detector (Ct = 0), then this control is
valid and acceptable.
iii. If the AR IC is not detected in the No Template Control, the assay
run is invalid and all patient specimens must be re-extracted and re-
assayed.
iv. If the AR IC is detected for the No Template Control, the assay run
is considered valid and acceptable.
b. Positive Control
i. If the Positive Control result is a Ct = 0 for H1N1 and/or FLUA, the
assay run is considered invalid and unacceptable. All patient
specimens must be re-assayed.
ii. If the Ct values for H1N1 and FLUA are, ≤ 40, ≠ 0 the assay run is
considered valid and acceptable.
2. Examination of Patient Specimen Results
Examination of clinical specimen results should be performed after the Positive and
No Template Controls have been examined and determined to be valid and
acceptable. H1N1, FLUA and AR IC results must be examined for each patient
specimen.
Criteria for a Valid Patient Specimen (Simplified)*
Patient Specimen H1N1 Ct and FLUA Ct Amplification Plot AR IC Ct
Either detector or both detectors ≤ 40, ≠ 0 Shows exponential increase N/A
Both detectors at 0 N/A ≤ 40, ≠ 0
* See notes below for full description
a. Amplification plots should be examined for every result with a “Data
Quality” message. From the Data tab select the curve to review and click
Refresh. The software will draw the selected curves and adjust the scale of
the graph. A valid amplification curve shows a smooth, exponential increase.
An invalid amplification curve may be a non-exponential or linear curve or a
curve with data “spikes” where the curve may cross the threshold. If the
curve is valid after examination, the Ct value reported may be used to
determine if FLU A or H1N1 targets are detected.

[Table 1 on page 4]
	Patient Specimen H1N1 Ct and FLUA Ct			Amplification Plot			AR IC Ct	
Either detector or both detectors ≤ 40, ≠ 0			Shows exponential increase			N/A		
Both detectors at 0			N/A			≤ 40, ≠ 0		

--- Page 5 ---
b. If the amplification curve is valid for FLU A or H1N1, the AR IC is not
required to be detected to report a positive result for FLU A or H1N1.
3. Interpretation of Results
a. A specimen that does not contain any influenza A virus will be negative
(Ct = 0) for the FLU A and H1N1 detectors. A specimen positive for
influenza A virus other than 2009 H1N1 influenza will most likely have a
positive result (Ct ≤40, ≠0) for the FLU A detector and will be negative (Ct =
0) for H1N1 detector. A specimen that is positive for 2009 H1N1 influenza
will be positive for both the FLU A and the H1N1 detector.
b. If only the H1N1 detector is positive and not the FLU A detector, the result
is indeterminate
c. If the FLU A Ct value of a patient sample is not detected and the AR IC Ct
value falls within or below the acceptable range, the “Influenza A RNA”
result is reported as “Not Detected”.
d. If the FLU A Ct value of a patient specimen is ≤40, ≠0 and an
amplification curve is observed for the well, the “Influenza A RNA” result is
reported as “Detected”. If the Ct value for the well is ≤ 40 but no
amplification curve is observed (nonspecific fluorescence is observed in the
well), the “Influenza A RNA” result is reported as “Not Detected.”
e. If the H1N1 Ct value of a patient sample is listed as “0” and the AR IC Ct
value falls within or below the acceptable range, the “2009 H1N1 Influenza
RNA” result is reported as “Not Detected”.
f. If the H1N1 Ct value of a patient specimen is ≤40, ≠0 and an amplification
curve is observed and FLU A is also detected, the “2009 H1N1 Influenza
RNA” result is reported as “Detected”. If the H1N1 Ct value for the well is
≤40, ≠0 but no amplification curve is observed in the well (nonspecific
fluorescence is observed in the well), the “2009 H1N1 Influenza RNA” result
is reported as “Not Detected”.
g. If the FLU A and H1N1 Ct value of a patient specimen is 0 and the AR IC
Ct value is 0, the specimen must be re-assayed. If upon repeat testing, the
same situation occurs, the patient result is reported as “Indeterminate due to
possible inhibition” with the additional comment: “After repeat analysis, non-
amplification of the internal control suggests the presence of PCR inhibitors in
the patient sample. An additional sample should be submitted for testing if
clinically warranted.”
h. If upon repeat testing the result is still indeterminate for H1N1 then the
“2009 H1N1 Influenza RNA” result is reported as “Indeterminate.”

L. Test Principle:
The Simplexa™ Influenza A H1N1 (2009) test is a nucleic acid amplification assay
that uses real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
amplification to enable simultaneous and distinct detection of viral nucleic acids from
influenza A and 2009 H1N1 influenza from nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), nasal
swabs (NS) and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from human patients with signs and
symptoms of respiratory infection in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological
risk factors.
The assay combines real-time PCR amplification with fluorescent signal detection
technology. A bi-functional fluorescent probe-primer is used together with a reverse
primer to amplify a specific target (for each analyte and internal control). A
fluorescent signal is generated after the separation of the fluorophore from the
quencher as a result of the binding of a probe element to the extended RNA fragment
synthesized during amplification.

--- Page 9 ---
The 3M Integrated Cycler is a rapid real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction
thermocycler used for the identification of nucleic acid from prepared biological
samples. The instrument utilizes disk media to contain and to process samples. The
instrument uses real time flourometric detection to identify targets within the sample
wells. The instrument is controlled by an external computer running the Integrated
Cycler Studio Software. Together, the instrument, software and test kit are referred to
as the “Microfluidic Molecular System.”
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

Inter-lot Precision:
Inter-lot precision was assessed by testing nine (9) samples and a positive
control across three different lots (REPRO-FLU-1 – REPRO-FLU-9). These
samples were generated using negative swab matrix and were run in triplicate.
One operator at one study site made one extraction of each sample and tested
across lots.

The variability attributable to lot-to-lot imprecision was found by fitting the
appropriate general linear mixed model, with “lot” as a random variable, and
partitioning out the variance. Total variability was split into inter-lot
variability, and intra-lot variability (the unexplained variability, or error term
of the model). The inter-lot variability component is summarized in the tables
below. Imprecision estimates for all samples in the panel the %CV was ≤0.9.

1) For the purposes of calculating averages and variance components, samples that offered a negative result (Ct=0) were
assigned to a value of 40.0, as a value of 40.0 is more representative of negative samples which have Ct values at the upper
limit of the range.
Inter-laboratory, Inter-assay and Intra-assay Reproducibility:
Each sample (REPRO-FLU-1 – REPRO-FLU-18) was tested in triplicate at
three separate sites: one run per operator, per day, two operators per site, at
three sites for 5 days. Eighteen samples, the No Template Control, and
Positive Control were tested in this fashion. A total of 1800 samples were
tested in the reproducibility studies. Estimates of variability were determined
with a random effects model that includes run and site as predictors, with run
nested within site. This allowed for partitioning of the total variance to
provide best estimates of inter-assay, intra-assay, and inter-lab variability.
Three sites assessed the device's inter-laboratory reproducibility and
inter/intra-assay reproducibility. Site 1 and 3 performed the extraction using
the MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit; Site 2 performed the
extraction step using the Qiagen QIAamp® Viral RNA Mini Kit.
Four sample results were excluded from the analysis due to pipetting errors
reported by the laboratory. Thirty six wells, 2%, had an invalid result due to a
failed internal control (not detected) and were not used in the estimation of Ct
variability. There was no association between the failed internal control and

1) The 1st replicate of the NTC for Site 2, Day 4, Run 1, was detected in the Flu A channel with a Ct value of 39.5. This well appeared to have a valid
amplification curve. The other two replicates were negative, and the data from this run are included in the analysis.
2) The 2nd replicate of the Positive Control for Site 1, Day 4, Run 1 was invalid. The other two replicates of this run were positive, and the data from this
run are included in the analysis.
3) Well(s) had an invalid result, and is (are) not used in the estimation of Ct variability.
4) Sample results have been excluded from the analysis due to pipetting errors reported by the laboratory sites.

1) The 1st replicate of the NTC for Site 2, Day 4, Run 1, was detected in the Flu A channel with a Ct value of 39.5. This well appeared to have a valid
amplification curve. The other two replicates were negative, and the data from this run are included in the analysis.
2) The 2nd replicate of the Positive Control for Site 1, Day 4, Run 1 was invalid. The other two replicates of this run were positive, and the data from this
run are included in the analysis.
3) Well(s) had an invalid result, and is (are) not used in the estimation of Ct variability.
4) Sample results have been excluded from the analysis due to pipetting errors reported by the laboratory sites.

c. Traceability, stability, expected values (controls calibrators or methods)
Controls:
The following controls are provided in the Simplexa™ Influenza A H1N1
(2009) kit:
Positive Control (PC): Inactivated 2009 H1N1 influenza virus. The PC in
conjunction with the AR IC is used to verify reagent and system performance.
The positive control is meant to be a control for global failure of the assay
(missing reaction component, instrument failure, etc.). A positive control
should be included in each run.
Internal Control (IC): The internal control is an RNA sequence encapsidated
in protein (Armored RNA Internal Control (AR IC)). The AR IC is
incorporated into every sample and is carried through all steps of the
procedure from nucleic acid isolation and purification through amplification.
The AR IC is meant to monitor for PCR inhibition.

No Template Control (NTC): The NTC includes nuclease-free water in the
PCR reactions instead of RNA. The NTC reaction should not exhibit
fluorescence growth curves that cross the threshold line. If any of the NTC
reactions exhibit a growth curve that crosses the cycle threshold, sample
contamination may have occurred. A no template control should be included
in each run.
Quality control ranges have been established as indicated in the table below. If
the controls are not within these parameters, patient results should be
considered invalid and the assay repeated. Each laboratory should establish its
own Quality Control ranges and frequency of QC testing based on applicable
local laws, regulations and standard good laboratory practice.

d. Detection limit:
Analytical sensitivity was estimated for six strains of influenza A:
A/California/7/2009 NYMC x-179-A, A/Swine NY/02/2009 H1N1,
A/Solomon Island/03/06 H1, A/Brisbane/59/07 H1, A/Brisbane/10/07 H3
and, A/Wisconsin/67/05 H3. The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined
by limiting dilution studies using six viral stocks of the Influenza A virus.
The samples were grown, re-titered, and diluted with bulk negative matrix
(swab and aspirate). Four dilutions around the theoretical LoD were extracted
three times using Roche MagNA Pure LC System. A single extraction of
Positive Control (PC) and No Template Control (NTC) were included in each
extraction cartridge. Each extracted sample and control was assayed in a
single well. The lowest concentration at which all three replicates are positive
is treated as tentative LoD.
Confirmation of LoD was determined over multiple runs. Each strain was
spiked into negative swab and negative aspirate matrices at the concentration
of tentative LoD and extracted using both the Roche MagNA Pure LC System
and the QIAamp® Viral RNA Mini Kit. A single extraction of Positive
Control (PC) and No Template Control (NTC) was included in each run.
The LoD was estimated as the lowest concentration that was detected ≥95% of
the time (i.e. concentration at which at least 19 out of 20 replicates were
determined to be positive). The data are presented below stratified by FLUA
and H1N1 markers, swab and aspirate matrices, and either the QIAgen or
Roche extraction methods.

A panel of thirty four (34) potential cross-reactants were individually spiked
at high concentrations into a swab matrix. The concentration of the cross
reactants were determined by growing and titering the organism listed. The
unspiked matrix was also tested to serve as a baseline. Samples extracted with
the Roche MagNA Pure LC System and tested in triplicate to screen for cross
reactivity. If either the FLUA channel or 2009 H1N1 channel was detected in
any of the three replicates, an additional 5 replicates were tested for
confirmation. One extraction was used to make the original three replicates
and the confirmatory five replicates.
One of the original triplicates for adenovirus was detected in the FLUA
channel. The baseline matrix that this sample was spiked into also gave a
positive signal in the same run, indicating possible contamination. Five
additional replicates from the same extraction were tested, offering 2 detected,
one indeterminate, and 2 not detected results. In order to evaluate the
possibility of contamination of the sample during extraction versus true
reactivity of adenovirus 1, the cross reactant was spiked into fresh matrix and
a new extraction performed. Both adenovirus 1 and the baseline matrix were
not detected in all replicates.
No cross reactivity was detected for either FLUA or 2009 H1N1 channel, after
confirmatory testing. In the instances where the 2009 H1N1 channel was
detected among the screening triplicate, the FLUA channel was never detected
and hence the interpretation of the sample was indeterminate. In all these
instances the confirmatory repeat testing gave “not detected” results in the
2009 H1N1 channel. Detailed analytical specificity results are presented in
the following table:

1) One of the original triplicates for adenovirus was detected in the Influenza A channel. The baseline matrix that this sample was
spiked into also gave a positive signal in the same run, indicating possible contamination. Five additional replicates from the same
extraction were tested, offering 2 detected, one indeterminate, and 2 not detected results. In order to evaluate the possibility of
contamination of the sample during extraction versus true reactivity of adenovirus 1, the cross reactant was spiked into fresh matrix
and a new extraction performed. Both adenovirus 1 and the baseline matrix were not detected in all replicates.
2) The EBV virus is grown in a transformed cell line (marmoset leukocytes). Transformed cells are not an appropriate cell line for
quantitation using TCID /mL, instead, copies/mL is calculated using a quantitative PCR method.

In addition to laboratory testing, bioinformatics resources and computer
simulations were used to predict cross reactivity of additional influenza A
strains with the Simplexa™ Influenza A H1N1 (2009). Comparison of the
sequence of the bi-functional fluorescent probe-primer and the reverse primer
for H1N1 shows that bi-functional fluorescent probe-primer and reverse
primers designed to detect the 2009 H1N1 influenza strain have a significant
number of mismatches when compared to the sequences of all other listed
subtypes. The 2009 H1N1 influenza strain is unique, and primers directed to
the 2009 H1N1 influenza sequence would not detect the other subtypes listed
in the table below.

Reactivity:
In addition to the six influenza A strains tested for LoD, various dilutions (in
negative swab matrix) of eight additional influenza A strains were tested for
reactivity with the Simplexa™ Influenza A H1N1 (2009) assay. Four
dilutions around the theoretical LoD were extracted three times using the
Roche MagNA Pure LC instrumentation. A single extraction of Positive
Control (PC) and No Template Control (NTC) were included in each
extraction cartridge. Each extracted sample and control was assayed in a
single well. The lowest concentration at which all three replicates are positive
is treated as tentative LoD. The sequences of the two tissue culture adapted
swine strains were confirmed to match published sequences. Results of
screening with the additional strains are presented in the table below.

1) One of three replicates of A/New Caledonia/20/99 H1N1 and A/Taiwan/42/06 H1N1 and had a
positive H1N1 result (CT 39.1) at the lowest concentration tested. There were no positive 2009 H1N1
results at the higher concentration.
Additional evidence of reactivity with other influenza A strains was generated
by comparing of the sequence of the bi-functional fluorescent probe-primer
and the reverse primer for FLUA and sequences matrix gene of the influenza
A strains identified below. Sequence alignments demonstrate that the bi-
functional fluorescent probe-primer and reverse primers have a near perfect
match to all subtypes, and the forward primer has a maximum of 3
mismatches, which would theoretically enable the assay to detect all subtypes
listed.

Interference
Analysis of Clinical Dataset for Effects of Potential Interfering Medications -
Note: No interference study was performed by spiking known concentrations of potentially
interfering substances (e.g. cold medications, FluMist vaccine, blood, etc) into the sample
matrix containing the assay analytes.
Data analysis of a sub-population of patients from the prospective clinical study prescribed
various medications (i.e. anti-bacterials, anti-virals, steroids, common cold medications)
showed similar sensitivity per target compared to the population not receiving medication.
Although the concentration of the interferents in the total extracted nucleic acid preparation is
unknown, the results represent doses that are typically prescribed to the intended use
population. A complete list of medications recorded in patient charts extracted from the
clinical dataset is presented in the Table below.

Fifty cycles of amplification were performed during assay development to
allow for the appropriate determination of assay cut off. Analysis of the Limit
of Detection study shows that the average Ct value for the samples at the
Limit of Detection was <37. The Limit of Detection is defined as the lowest
concentration of sample where ≥ 95% of twenty replicates are detected. In the
table below, the Sub LoD data indicate the next dilution in the series below
the Limit of Detection where the replicates were detected <95% of the time.
A review of the Method Comparison data show that the >90% of the positive
specimens have a Ct value ≤35. Specimens which were positive for 2009
H1N1 influenza, had Ct values in the range of 16.1 to 39.0 Ct. Specimens that
were positive for influenza A, had Ct values in the range of 18.4 to 39.2 with
one sample at Ct value of 42.5. Based on the available data, the assay cut off
was set at Ct = 40 for both detectors.

g. Amplification Carry-Over Contamination:
The study was designed by alternately placing a high negative (1.0 x 10-3
TCID50/mL) and high positive (7.5 x 105 TCID /mL) samples on both the
50
MagNA Pure cartridge for extraction and the Universal disc for amplification.
A total of 180 high negative samples were tested across 5 runs. The sample
size of 180 was chosen to provide 80% power of detecting a carry
over/contamination effect of 5% or greater, with alpha = 0.05. The carryover
effect was evaluated by comparing the observed negative rate for the high
negative sample with the expected rate under normal reproducibility
conditions (i.e. 95%, the % negative rate outside of contamination). A one
sample, one sided test for a proportion (binomial) was used to test for
significance for both the FLUA and H1N1 channels.
The baseline negative sample was negative approximately 95% of the time for
both FLUA and H1N1 channels at (6.7% positive for FLUA, 4.4% positive
for H1N1, across 90 replicates). When tested with high positive samples, no
significant carry-over contamination effect was seen in either channel.

1) Only two (2) of the H1N1 results were actual H1N1 positives per the PI, as the FLUA channel was
negative for 11 of detected H1N1 samples. These results were still included in the statistical testing for
the purpose of detecting contamination of that channel.
2) One (1) of the 180 replicates of high negative came up as invalid due to a “Not Detected” AR IC
result. With this replicate excluded, the one-sided binomial test still offered a non-significant result for
both FLUA and H1N1 (p-value of 0.19 and 0.12, respectively).
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with gold standard/reference method:
Performance of the assay was evaluated in comparison to a composite
reference method for the Flu A target including the Luminex xTAG RVP Flu
A target, a validated PCR assay using primer and probe sequences published
by the CDC and a well characterized PCR followed by sequencing. The
sequencing data was used to determine the 2009 H1N1 subtype.
b. Matrix Comparison:
Not Applicable
c. Performance in Fresh vs. Frozen Clinical Specimens:
Performance of the Simplexa™ Influenza A H1N1 (2009) assay was
determined by comparing fresh (never frozen, unextracted and tested within
72 hours of collection) versus frozen (unextracted) clinical specimens. One
hundred (100) samples, consisting of both swab and nasopharyngeal aspirates,
were gathered for testing. Three aliquots of each sample were prepared,
representing fresh, short-term frozen (at least 2 hours frozen at -20ºC), and
long-term frozen (at least 7 days frozen at -70ºC) states. All testing was
performed at Focus, using one Simplexa ™ Influenza A H1N1 (2009) lot.
The plots of short term frozen Ct values and long term frozen Ct values vs.
Fresh Ct values visually show the existence of a linear relationship.
Additionally, for all comparisons, the value of coefficient of determination
(R2) is greater than 0.97, meaning that at least 97% of the variation seen in the
frozen (long term and short term) Ct values are explained by the variation
seen in fresh Ct values.

The slopes along with the 95% confidence interval and percent bias for the
above comparisons are summarized in the following table. The 95%
confidence interval includes 1.00, which shows slope estimates are not
statistically significant at 5% level of significance. This indicates that long

samples.

1) For the purposes of regression analysis, samples that offered a negative result (Ct=0) were assigned to
a value of 40.0, as a value of 40.0 is more representative of negative samples which have Ct values at
the upper limit of the range.

d. Extraction Efficiency:
Assessment of the equivalency of the extraction methods was determined
using a multifaceted approach. (1) One clinical site performed Clinical
Agreement and Reproducibility using the QIAamp® Viral RNA mini kit and
two sites used the MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation kit. (2) Limit
of detection determinations were performed using both extraction methods.
(3) In a direct comparison of the performance of Simplexa™ assay using two
extraction methods, a panel of clinical specimens was extracted with MagNA
Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation kit and QIAamp® Viral RNA mini kit,
and each extracted sample was tested with the Simplexa™ Influenza A H1N1
(2009) assay.
A panel of 139 clinical specimens, including nasal swabs (NS) and
nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), with previous results blinded to the operator,
was selected for this study. This panel contained 63 specimens previously
reported as positive for 2009 H1N1 influenza, 33 specimens previously
reported as positive for influenza A, and 43 specimens previously reported as
negative for influenza A. Each specimen was extracted with MagNA Pure LC
Total Nucleic Acid Isolation kit and QIAamp® Viral RNA mini kit, and each
extracted sample was tested in singlet with the Simplexa™ Influenza A H1N1
(2009) assay. The results of the specimens with both extraction methods were
compared for positive and negative agreements.
Based on the three studies described above, there does not appear to be any
significant difference in the performance of the Simplexa™ using either the
MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation kit or the QIAamp® Viral
RNA mini kit.

3. Clinical studies:
Specimens were prospectively collected from patients with signs and symptoms of
influenza like illness from sites in Austin, TX (September 2009) and the New South
Wales region of Australia (July – September 2009). An additional 214
nasal/nasopharyngeal swabs and two nasal washes were retrospectively collected
from the Focus Sample Bank and were remnants of samples submitted to the Focus
Reference Laboratory for influenza testing. Samples from all procurement sites were
randomly distributed to each of the testing sites.
Samples were distributed to three testing sites. Site 1, located at University of
Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, generated data using the Roche MagNA
Pure extraction method. Site 2, located at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in
Columbus, Ohio, generated data using the Qiagen extraction method. Site 3, Focus
Diagnostics, Inc., generated data using the Roche MagNA Pure extraction method.
Specimens were determined to be positive for 2009 H1N1 influenza by a composite
reference method for the Flu A target including the Luminex xTAG RVP Flu A
target, a validated PCR assay using primer and probe sequences published by the
CDC and a well characterized PCR followed by sequencing. The sequencing data was

used to determine the 2009 H1N1 subtype. Two results were generated for each
specimen, an influenza A result and a 2009 H1N1 influenza subtyping result. Both
results must be positive to determine that a specimen is 2009 H1N1 influenza
positive.
A total of 410 prospectively collected specimens (299 nasal/nasopharyngeal swabs
and 112 nasopharyngeal aspirates) were analyzed using the Simplexa™ Influenza A
H1N1 (2009) assay. The data presented below are stratified by both result and
specimen type. Fifteen (15) specimens (10 swabs and 5 aspirates) were excluded from
the analysis because there was no consensus among the reference assays for the
influenza A result. Twelve specimens (9 swabs and 3 aspirates) were excluded from
the 2009 H1N1 Influenza Clinical Agreement Summary tables as sequencing data
used to determine subtype was not available. These 12 specimens are included in the
Influenza A Clinical Agreement Summary tables. Site poolability of performance
data was determined based on the fact that similar SimplexaTM performance were
obtained from the 3 clinical sites. For the clinical studies, the initial rate of
indeterminate results was 0.16%

Due to the low prevalence of other strains of influenza A during the testing period; all FLU A responses from prospectively
collected aspirates were combined to demonstrate the performance of the FLU A bi-functional fluorescent primer-probe. Of
the 31 specimens determined to be positive for Flu A, 24 were 2009 H1N1 influenza positive, one (1) was sequenced but
the sub-type could not be determined, three (3) were not detected by the alternate PCR and could not be sequenced, three (3)
did not have sufficient volume to sequence to determine sub-type.
An additional 214 retrospectively collected nasal/nasopharyngeal swabs and two nasal
washes from the Focus Sample Bank were also tested at 3 sites. Three swab specimens
were excluded from the analysis because there was no consensus among the reference
assay results. One swab specimen was excluded from the 2009 H1N1 Influenza
Clinical Agreement Summary tables as sequencing data used to determine subtype
was not available. This specimen is included in the Influenza A Clinical Agreement
Summary tables.

Due to the low prevalence of other strains of influenza A during the testing period; all FLU A responses from retrospectively
collected samples were combined to demonstrate the performance of the FLU A bi-functional fluorescent primer-probe. Of
the 132 specimens determined to be positive for FLU A, 57 were 2009 H1N1 influenza positive, two (2) were H1N1, 59
were H3N2, one (1) was sequenced but the sub-type could not be determined, one (1) was indeterminate by Simplexa, 11
were not detected by the alternate PCR and could not be sequenced, and one (1) did not have sufficient volume to sequence
to determine sub-type.
Two retrospectively collected washes were found to be positive for influenza A by
the composite reference method and by the Simplexa assay.
4. Clinical cut-off: Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Prospective specimens used in this clinical study were obtained from the Texas region
of the United States and the New South Wales region of Australia. The prevalence of
influenza A in Texas (Region VI) ranged from 25.6 – 29.4% during the September
2009 collection period; 99% of those cases were 2009 H1N1 influenza. In New
South Wales, the prevalence during the July to September collection period ranged
from 20-42%, with 83-92% of these cases representing 2009 H1N1 influenza.

N. Instrument Name:
Integrated Cycler with Integrated Cycler Studio Software version 2.1 or higher (3M)
MagNA Pure LC Instrument (Roche)
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Microfluidic Molecular System includes the computer, related
peripherals, handheld barcode scanner, Integrated Cycler, Integrated Cycler
Studio software and operator manual. The Integrated Cycler is a rapid real-
time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) thermocycler used for identification
of nucleic acid from prepared biological samples. The instrument utilizes disc
media to contain and to process samples and real-time fluorometric detection
to identify targets within the sample wells. The instrument’s operation
parameters are controlled by the use of an external personal computer and
associated software. The disc can process up to 96 independent samples.
The Roche MagNA Pure LC is an automated nucleic acid isolation and
purification system based upon binding of nucleic acids to glass particles and
has the capability to process a total of 32 reactions within one run. Nucleic
acid is purified in multiple plastic reaction tips and cartridges by several steps
that include cell lysis and binding of nucleic acid to magnetic glass particles,
wash steps, and a heated elution to unbind the nucleic acid from the glass
particles.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this line of product types:

--- Page 30 ---
5. Calibration:
Not applicable
6. Quality Control:
The following controls are provided:
Positive Control (PC): H1N1 Positive Control Inactivated 2009 H1N1
influenza virus. The PC in conjunction with the AR IC is used to verify
reagent and system performance. The positive control is meant to be a control
for global failure of the assay (missing reaction component, instrument failure,
etc.). A positive control should be included in each run.
Internal Control (IC): The internal control is an RNA sequence encapsidated
in protein (Armored RNA Internal Control (AR IC)) The AR IC is
incorporated into every sample and is carried through all steps of the
procedure from nucleic acid isolation and purification through amplification.
The AR IC is meant to monitor for PCR inhibition.
No Template Control (NTC): The NTC includes nuclease-free water in the
PCR reactions instead of RNA. The NTC reaction should not exhibit
fluorescence growth curves that cross the threshold line. If any of the NTC
reactions exhibit a growth curve that crosses the cycle threshold, sample
contamination may have occurred. A no template control should be included
in each run.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Not applicable
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports
a substantial equivalence decision
