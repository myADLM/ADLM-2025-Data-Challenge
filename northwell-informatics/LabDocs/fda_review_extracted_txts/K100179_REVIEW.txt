L. Test Principle:
Human C3c Kit for Use on the SPA PLUSTM test is a single-step immunoturbidimetric test.
The assay determines concentration of C3c through photometric measurement of
suspension formed (insoluble antigen-antibody complex agglutination) between antibodies
to human C3c and C3c present in the sample. Concentrations are automatically calculated
by reference to a calibration curve stored with in the instrument.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision studies were performed following CLSI Evaluation of Precision
Performance of Clinical Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline
(CLSI Document EP5-A2).
The study was carried out over 21 working days, with two runs per day. One user
assessed three different samples (High, Medium and Low) using three different
reagent lots on three different analyzers.
Results are summarized in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated as per CLSI EP6-A (Evaluation of the Linearity of
Quantitative measurement procedures; A statistical approach; Approved Guideline).
Seven undiluted human serum samples (see table) previously identified as
containing high levels of C3c and stored at -20°C were pooled to form a high
linearity fluid.
This high level fluid was diluted with sample diluent (not reaction buffer) as it was
not possible to obtain sufficient samples with adequate (low) levels to produce a low
level linearity pool. Dilutions were prepared to cover the kit measuring range and
each dilution was measured three times on three different kit lots at neat and a 1/10
sample dilution.

This data confirms the linearity of the assay over the range of 0.03-3g/L across 3
different kit lots.
Measuring range (reportable range) for C3s is 0.03 - 3 g/L for initial 1:10 dilution of
samples that are automatically processed by the instrument. Samples with results in
excess of 3g/L are repeated on a higher dilution (1:20).
Auto-dilution vs. manual dilution
Studies were done to support the accuracy and the precision of the SPA PLUSTM
turbidimetric analyser automated sample dilution protocol, by comparing auto-
dilution vs. manual-dilution. Three samples of different levels were tested on the
SPA using off-line (manual) and on-line (auto) dilution method. The samples
PLUS
were all diluted in SPA instrument system diluent (SN080.S) which is the
PLUS
recommended diluent for this analyzer. Each sample dilution was tested 20 times
and the mean, standard deviation and % coefficient of variation were calculated for
each data set. In all three cases the manual (off-line) 1/20 dilution was compared to
the 1/20 on-line dilution.
The test results are summarized in the table below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls and Calibrators
The calibrators and controls are manufactured from ‘pooled human serum’. The
control serum samples were traceable to European Reference Material DA 470. The
kit C3c calibrators are assigned to an internal reference (IR) which is directly
calibrated to the external reference standard DA-470. For the IR assignment both
the IR fluid and DA-470 are tested at different dilutions across the curve (50%,
25%, 12.5% and 6.25%). All dilutions are tested in triplicate using 2 or more
different kit batches on the SPA . A second set of dilutions are made and tested
PLUS
in the same way on a different SPA analyzer. From this information the IR
PLUS
value is calculated. The IR assignment is verified by testing it against DA-470 in
triplicate using all assays that measure C3c.

months from the date of manufacture when stored at the recommended storage
temperature of 2-8°C.
On-Board stability tests were performed by storing vials 'on-board' the SPA for
PLUS
a period of at least 28 days. Open vial Stability were tested by storing reagents in
open vials for 3 months at 2 - 8°C. The results obtained from Low and High
Controls were within +15% of the assigned value.
d. Detection limit:
CLSI EPI7-A (Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of
Quantitation, Approved Guideline) were employed for determining limit of
detection. A blank, the bottom calibrator and a sample known to contain C3c,
diluted to give a value just greater than the blank, were tested 60 times on the
SPA analyzer. The standard deviation (SD) and the percentage coefficient of
PLUS
variation (%CV) were calculated in each case. The 60 blank absorbance readings
gave a mean value of 0.0027 absorbance units with an SD of 0.0008 units.
The limit of quantitation (LoQ): The bottom calibrator point was the lowest point of
the measuring range and therefore was considered as the limit of quantitation (LoQ).
The LoQ was assigned a value of 0.24g/L for kit lot N0054.
The limit of blank (LoB): Below LoQ point, samples were flagged as below the
measurable range, and no concentration value was calculated. LoB was estimated
as the mean of blank +2 SD using the blank (sample diluent) as a zero calibrator.
The results derived from 0.0027 + (0.0008 x 2) = 0.0040 abs units gave an estimated
value of 0.005g/L (LoB).
The limit of detection (LoD): The limit of detection (LoD) was estimated as the
mean value obtained for the very low level sample using the blank as a zero
calibrator. The very low level sample (diluted sample) gave a mean value of 0.0088
absorbance units giving an estimated value of 0.012g/L which was considered to be
the limit of detection (LoD).
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity with other complement components:
The IEP and ouchterlony tests were performed to demonstrate the absence of cross
reaction with other complement components including major split products (C4a
etc.) and other subunits (C Iq etc.). Western blots analysis was used to demonstrate
the absence of cross-reactivity to C3a and C3dg. Results showed the sheep anti-
human C3c serum specifically binds to human C3c.
Interference – endogenous substances
Susceptibility to interference was assessed by adding a high concentration of a
potential interferent to a test sample containing known concentrations of C3c. The
method used to check for chyle, a mixture of biological lymph and chylomicrons
(lipids and proteins), and haemoglobin was based on the Interference Check A
plus™ (Sysmex, Japan). In the same way bilirubin interference was assessed by
adding a high concentration of bilirubin to a test serum sample and comparing it to a
blank. Percentage interference was calculated from comparison with the sample
blank. Deviations less than or equal to +/-10% of the blank value were considered
to show 'no significant interference'.

No significant interference was seen when high concentrations of haemoglobin
(5g/L), bilirubin (200mg/L) and chyle (1500 FTU) were added to serum samples.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison between Binding Site's C3c SPA ™ assays to the already
PLUS
510k approved Tina-Quant C3c Test system (k012361 Roche Diagnostics Corp.)
was done by using 92 human serum retrospective samples. The clinical samples
were collected and stored at -80°C in order to preserve the complement levels as
much as possible. No validation data is available to support these storage
conditions. Thirty six normal samples and 56 clinical samples were tested on
SPA ™ and Tina-Quant C3c kit. Three of the clinical samples were diluted in
PLUS
SPA instrument system diluent to give adequate sample numbers over the
PLUS
measuring range. The samples were fairly distributed over the measuring range.
The following results were obtained for 95 samples over the range of 0.230 to
3.670g/L:
Passing and Bablok fit y=0.99x + 0.00
Linear regression y=0.9284 + 0.075 R2=0.99 r=0.993
