L. Test Principle:
The enzyme, acyl amidohydrolase, cleaves the amide bond of the acetaminophen
molecule, leaving p-aminophenol and acetate. The p-aminophenol reacts with
8-hydroxoquinoline-5-sulfonic acid in the presence of manganese ions to form a
colored compound 5-(4-iminophenol)-8-quinoline. The increased absorbance at
596/751 nm is directly proportional to the concentration of acetaminophen in the
sample.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision estimates were computed according to CLSI document EP05-A2,
Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods.
10 days of precision studies were performed. Within run and total imprecision
were evaluated by testing 3 individual, normal serum pools spiked with
acetaminophen. In addition, 2 levels of a serum-based control material and a
single-level calibrator (acetaminophen in human serum albumin) were tested.
The acetaminophen levels were chosen to challenge the upper and lower
limits of the expected range of the assay, the medically significant cut-off
level as well as various levels throughout the assay range. Each sample was
assayed 2 times per run and 2 runs per day for 10 days, totaling 40 replicates
per system. The experiment was performed using one reagent lot on one
ADVIA 1650 system. One operator performed the study.

An additional precision study was performed over a period of 10 days (2 runs
per day – total 20 runs) using 2 reagent lots on 2 ADVIA 1650 systems and
incorporating 2 calibrations on each system. Within run and total imprecision
were evaluated by testing 4 individual, normal serum pools spiked with
acetaminophen. In addition, 2 levels of a serum-based control material were
tested. Each sample was assayed 2 times per run and 2 runs per day for 10
days. The study was run using two reagent lots on two ADVIA 1650 systems
(both lots run on both instruments).

The measuring range of the assay is 0.2 – 20 mg/dL. Nine (9) diluted samples
were prepared from high and low serum samples by dilution. Fresh normal
human serum was spiked with approximately 23 mg/dL of Acetaminophen, in
order to provide a sample just above the desired upper range of the assay. The
same serum, un-spiked, which contained no acetaminophen, was used as a low
sample. The deviation was calculated as the difference of the expected value
and the mean observed result of 2 replicates. Percent deviation for all
acetaminophen-containing tested pools was less than 1.7% throughout the
range of the assay.
Linear regression: y = 1.0014 x - 0.0090
b = 1.0014 (95% Confidence interval 0.9967 - 1.0060)
a = -0.0090 (95% Confidence interval -0.0643 - 0.0462)
r = 1.000
The results of the study demonstrated that the acetaminophen assay is linear
up to the sponsor’s stated claim of 0.2 to 20 mg/dL.
Automatic rerun conditions for this method extend the analytical range to 60
mg/dL. An acetaminophen-free serum sample was spiked to approximately 60
mg/dL (3 x times the analytical range of the ADVIA assay) with purified
acetaminophen. A series of dilutions of this sample was made using an un-
spiked acetaminophen-free sample. The expected concentration of the samples
above the range of the assay was calculated based on the values within the
assay range times dilution factor. The sample was assayed with automatic
high-range rerun enabled. This data was generated using one system and one
reagent lot with each level assayed in duplicate (one operator)
The highest level tested gave an ADVIA value of 61.7 mg/dL which is
101.2% of the expected value of 61.0 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
ADVIA Chemistry Acetaminophen assay is calibrated using ADVIA
Chemistry ToxAmmonia calibrators cleared previously under k023184. The
ADVIA Chemistry Acetaminophen method is traceable to an internal standard
manufactured using purified material.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor set the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) of the assay at 0.2 mg/dL
which is consistent with the low end of the linearity and precision studies (see
1. a. above).

e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor tested potential interferents up to the indicated levels and the
results shown in the table below. The sponsor defined < 10 % interference as
not significant in this evaluation.
6

--- Page 7 ---

--- Page 8 ---
The table is included in the labeling. The sponsor states in the labeling that
visibly hemolyzed or lipemic samples should not be tested and that significant
interference may occur at very low concentrations of acetaminophen with
hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples.
Specific therapy for acetaminophen overdose is to administer N-acetylcysteine
(NAC, Mucomyst). The potential for NAC interference in the acetaminophen
assay was examined. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) at the level up to 1000 mg/L
was spiked in a serum sample pool with approximate acetaminophen
concentration of 10 mg/dL. Multiple levels of NAC were tested. The tested
samples were prepared by various dilutions of a pool with the highest
concentration of interferent with the same pool without interferent (control).
Calculations were performed by comparing observed Acetaminophen
concentration at each level of interferent vs. observed Acetaminophen
concentration of control (no interferent) expressed in %. No significant effect
of NAC, defined by the sponsor, as < 10 % interference was seen up to 800
mg/dL. A -20% effect was seen at a level of 1000 mg/dL NAC. The
following information is included in the labeling:
Interference from N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was evaluated on ADVIA
Chemistry system. Using a significance criterion of >10% variance from
control, acceptable results were obtained to a concentration of 800 mg/L
N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in a 10.2 mg/dL acetaminophen sample; this in-
vitro analysis was performed approximately two hours after the addition
of NAC to a serum pool. Note: Significantly reduced Acetaminophen
recovery has been demonstrated in situations where testing has been
performed immediately after the introduction of NAC. It is recommended
that laboratories review NAC treatment and monitoring protocols to
determine the extent of the potential interference.
The sponsor tested the effect of potentially interfering drugs using 2 human
serum pools with acetaminophen concentrations of approximately 0.5 mg/dL
and 3.0 mg/dL. A single level of interferent was tested at the concentration in
the table below. The method was considered by the sponsor to have no
significant interference (NSI) if a bias between control and observed
acetaminophen concentration is < 10%. The table below is included in the
sponsor’s labeling.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 95 serum samples were analyzed in singlicate on the ADVIA
Chemistry 1650 system using ADVIA Chemistry Acetaminophen method vs.
the Genzyme Acetaminophen method to demonstrate the equivalence of the
two methods. The study was conducted using one lot of Genzyme
Acetaminophen reagent and one lot of ADVIA Chemistry Acetaminophen
reagent. One trained operator performed the study. Serum samples ranged
from 0.4 to 19.5 mg/dL. These values span the proposed measuring range of
the assay (0.2 - 20 mg/dL). The linear regression equation from the study
yielded the following results:
Linear regression: y = 1.021x (95% confidence intervals = 1.0161 – 1.0265) +
0.18,( 95% confidence intervals = 0.13 – 0.22); r = 1.000
b. Matrix comparison:
Serum / plasma equivalency studies were performed to characterize the
correlation between serum and lithium heparin plasma samples. 24 matched
serum and plasma (Li-heparin) samples were collected in-house. The paired
9

--- Page 10 ---
serum and plasma pairs (from same donor) were spiked with identical levels
of purified acetaminophen to achieve concentrations of acetaminophen
ranging from 0.75 to 18.01 mg/dL. The samples were analyzed with the
ADVIA Chemistry Acetaminophen method on one system using one lot of
reagent, in singlicate. Results were analyzed using linear regression. The
linear regression equation from the study yielded the following result:
y + 1.01x – 0.03, r = 1.000
