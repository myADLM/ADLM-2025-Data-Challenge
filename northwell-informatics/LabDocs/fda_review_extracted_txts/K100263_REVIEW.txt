L. Test Principle:
1. The ELITech Clinical Systems PHOSPHORUS:
In the presence of sulfuric acid (acid medium), inorganic phosphate forms with
ammonium molybdate an ammonium phosphomolybdate complex.
Phosphorus
Ammonium molybdate + Sulfuric acid Phosphomolybdate complex
The concentration of phosphomolybdate formed is directly proportional to the inorganic
phosphate concentration in the sample and is measured at 340 nm.
2. The ELITech Clinical Systems URIC ACID MONO SL:
Uric acid is cleaved by uricase to form allantoine, CO and hydrogen peroxide (H O ).
2 2 2
H O reacts with 4-amino-antipyrine (4-AAP) and N-Ethyl-N-(2-Hydroxy-3-Sulfopropyl)
2 2
m-Toluidine (EHSPT) under the catalytic action of peroxidase to form a colored
quinoneimine. The absorbance of the quinoneimine at 546 nm is proportional to the
concentration of uric acid in the sample.
Uricase
Uric acid + 2H O + O Allantoin + CO + H O
2 2 2 2 2
Peroxidase
2H O + 4-AAP + EHSPT Quinoneimine + 4H O

3. The ELITech Clinical Systems UREA UV SL
11

--- Page 12 ---
Urea is hydrolyzed by urease to form ammonium and carbonate. The ammonium produce
reacts with α-Ketoglutarate and NADH under the catalytic action of Glutamate
Dehydrogenase (GlDH) to form L-Glutamate and NAD+. The decrease in absorbance of
NADH at 340 nm is proportional to the concentration of urea in the sample.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run and Total precision results for the ELITech Clinical Systems Phosphorus,
Uric Acid Mono SL, and Urea UV SL were obtained by spiking 3 serum pools to
concentrations below, within, and above the expected value ranges for each analyte.
The sponsor performed two runs per day, two measures per run, for twenty days
according to CLSI protocol EP5-A2 using one Selectra Junior and one lot of reagent.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the Phosphorus, Uric Acid Mono SL and Urea UV SL was
determined using the same protocol. Stock solutions for each device were
gravimetrically prepared from commercially available material to make a high and low
serum pools. High and low serum pools were mixed for each of the measurands to
obtain 11 samples covering the proposed measuring range of each device. One
Selectra Junior and one lot of reagent were used. Samples were tested in triplicate.
The data analysis was performed and evaluated according to CLSI EP6-A using linear
regression as well as second and third order non-linear fitted polynomial regressions.
Linearity met the 1st order polynomial for the three devices. The results are
summarized below:
Device Linear Regression R2 Measuring Range
Phosphorus y = 1.011x – 0.0947 0.9998 2.0-20.0 mg/dL
Uric Acid Mono SL y = 0.9972x +0.1347 0.9994 1.5-25 mg/dL
Urea UV SL y = 1.0177x – 0.8375 0.9985 4.7-140 mg/dL
Recovery studies were performed for Uric Acid Mono SL and Urea to demonstrate
that the analyzer can accurately measure manually or automated diluted samples. The
study protocols for both measurands were the same. Stock spiking solutions were
prepared for each analyte using commercially available dry reagents. 10 natural
samples for each test, with known concentrations of uric acid or urea, were spiked
with the stock solutions to obtain expected concentrations of 25.62-78.16 mg/dL of
uric acid or 139.7-690.2 mg/dL of urea. All samples were then diluted 1:5 with 9
gm/L saline. Samples were analyzed in duplicate on one Spectra Junior using one lot
of reagents and one calibration. The means were calculated for each sample, and
multiplied by the dilution factor. The observed values were compared to the expected
values to determine % recovery. The pre-determined acceptance criterion for
recovery was within 10% of the expected value. Results are summarized below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
ELICal 2 Calibrator for Phosphorus, Uric Acid Mono SL, and Urea UV SL are
purchased from a commercially available source and are traceable to: a NIST
traceable material, ID-MS, and SRM 909b, respectively.
Calibrator material is purchased from commercially available sources (previously
cleared under k033501). Elical 2 calibrator is value assigned using multiple runs on
two Vital Scientific Flexor Junior Analyzers. The target value of Elical 2 calibrator is
the mean of the observed values range. After validation of the target value, a
confidence range (high and low values) is calculated. Unreconstituted calibrators are
stable for 11 months at 2-8° C. Reconstituted calibrator stability for all three
analytes has been verified for the following temperatures and time limits: 12 hrs. at
15-25° C, 5 days at 2-8° C, 4 weeks at -15° C and -25° C.
Protocols and acceptance criteria were provided to support on-board calibration
stability for 28 days for phosphorus and uric acid and 7 days for urea at 15-25° C.
Control material is purchased from a commercial vendor (previously cleared under
k041227). The sponsor claimed the following for stability: before reconstitution, the
shelf-life of the ELITech Clinical Systems Elitrol 1 and Elitrol II is 30 months at 2-
8˚C. After reconstitution the stability is 12 hours when stored at 15-25˚C, 5 days
when stored at 2-8˚C or 4 weeks (when frozen once) at -25˚ and -15˚ C. Elitrol I
and II control solutions are value assigned using two Vital Scientific Flexor Junior
Analyzers. Each sample is tested in triplicate over several days. The target value of
Level I and II are the median of the observed values range. After validation of the
target value, a confidence range (high and low values) is calculated.
Reagent stability for the Phosphorus, Uric Acid Mono SL, and Urea UV SL were
evaluated on one Selectra Junior with one lot of reagent using three samples with low,
medium and high concentrations of each measurand. These samples were aliquoted

and analyzed. On board stability are 28 days for phosphorus and uric acid and 14
days for urea.
d. Detection limit:
The Limits of Blank (LoB), Detection (LoD) and Quantitation (LoQ) studies were
conducted following CLSI EP17-A for Phosphorus, Uric Acid Mono SL, and Urea
UV SL. One Selectra Junior and one lot of the respective reagents were used. The
LoBs were determined by analyzing 60 blank samples. The LoD and LoQ studies
each used 4 serum pools for the individual assays. The serum pools for the LoD had
concentrations of the individual measurands approximately 4 times the LoB. LoQs
were determined by analyzing 4 serum pools near the expected LoQ and evaluating
the Total Error. Results are summarized below:
Device LoB LoD LoQ Total Error
Phosphorus 0.01 mg/dL 0.02 mg/dL 1.00 mg/dL 11.0%
Uric Acid Mono SL 0.01 mg/dL 0.02 mg/dL 0.50 mg/dL 4.8%
Urea UV SL 0.1 mg/dL 0.3 mg/dL 2.3 mg/dL 12.4%
e. Analytical specificity:
i. Endogenous interferences of turbidity (20% Intralipid solution), triglycerides,
unconjugated bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin, hemoglobin and glucose were
investigated for the ELITech Clinical Systems PHOSPHORUS, URIC ACID
MONO SL, and UREA UV SL. Each device was tested in triplicate at two
concentrations for each of the individual measurands. Recovery was compared to
a sample with no interfering substance and significant interference was defined as
recoveries ≥ 10%. Urea was not tested for native triglycerides or glucose. The
concentrations of interferents tested for the three devices are in the table below:
Interferent Range of interferent tested
Turbidity (Intralipid®) up to 614 mg/dL
Triglycerides up to 1000 mg/dL
Unconjugated Bilirubin up to 30.0 mg/dL
Conjugated Bilirubin up to 29.5 mg/dL
Hemoglobin up to 500 mg/dL
Glucose up to 550 mg/dL
The concentrations of endogenous substances that demonstrated no significant
interference for each device are below:
Phosphorus Uric Acid Mono UV Urea UV
Turbidity (Intralipid®) See below* See below* up to 614 mg/dL
Triglycerides up to 732 mg/dL up to 1070 mg/dL Not tested

* Interference from turbidity was observed at both phosphorus concentrations and
uric acid concentrations tested across all concentrations of Intralipid® (turbidity).
Therefore, the sponsor recommends in the labeling that only clear (non-turbid)
samples should analyzed for phosphorus and uric acid.
Hemoglobin concentrations of 50 mg/dL also demonstrate interference for both
phosphorus and uric acid. Therefore, the sponsor recommends in the labeling that
no visibly hemolyzed samples should be analyzed for phosphorus and uric acid.
Conjugated bilirubin concentration of >1.5 mg/dL also demonstrated interference
for phosphorus ≥10%, therefore, the sponsor put a limitation that icteric samples
should not be used with the phosphorus assay.
Exogenous interferences were evaluated for PHOSPHORUS, URIC ACID
MONO SL and UREA UV using the same concentrations of measurands as the
endogenous interference studies. The substances were tested up to 1 mg/dL of
methyl dopa, up to 20 mg/dL of ascorbic acid, and up to 50 mg/dL of calcium
dobesilate. The concentrations of exogenous substances that demonstrated no
significant interference for each device are below:
Phosphorus Uric Acid Mono UV Urea UV
Methyl dopa Up to 1 mg/dL up to 1 mg/dL up to 1 mg/dL
Ascorbic Acid Up to 20 mg/dL See below** up to 20 mg/dL
Calcium dobesilate Not tested See below** Not tested
**Ascorbic acid and calcium dobesilate demonstrated interference at all uric
acid concentrations tested. Therefore, the sponsor has the following statement
of limitation in their labeling:
Samples with any amount of ascorbic acid or Calcium dobesilate will have
significant interference and should not be used for uric acid measurement.”
