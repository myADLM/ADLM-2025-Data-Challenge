should be in conjunction with other laboratory testing and clinical
observations for the following indications:
1. Providing epidemiological information for the surveillance of human
infection with Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) virus.
2. Identifying patients who may be infected with Influenza A/H5 (Asian
lineage) virus based on clinical and epidemiological risk factors.
Testing with the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection Kit should
not be performed unless the patient meets the most current U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services (DHHS) clinical and epidemiologic criteria for testing
suspected A/H5 specimens.
The definitive identification of influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) either directly from
patient specimens or from virus cultures requires additional laboratory testing, along
with clinical and epidemiological assessment in consultation with national influenza
surveillance experts.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used
as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.
Use is limited to laboratories with appropriate biosafety equipment and containment
procedures. It is intended for use by experienced laboratory personnel who have
training in standardized molecular testing procedures and expertise in viral diagnosis,
and have received training on the JBAIDS Instrument.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical
and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities,
specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for
novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health departments for
testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a biosafety
laboratory (BSL) 3+ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

I. Device Description:
The JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection Kit is a real time RT-PCR
assay based on the influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) assays that are part of the “CDC
Human Influenza Virus Real-time RT-PCR Detection and Characterization Panel
2

--- Page 3 ---
(rRT-PCR Flu Panel)”. These assays have been re-optimized to work with Idaho
Technology’s proprietary freeze-dried PCR reagent formulation. Purified patient
samples (using either the IT 1-2-3TM VIBE Sample Purification Kit, or the IT 1-2-
3TM Platinum Path Purification Kit) are used to reconstitute the freeze-dried
reagents which are then tested using the JBAIDS instruments.
Each JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection Kit contains sufficient
reagents for testing four specimens. There are four vacuum-sealed control pouches
of freeze-dried PCR reagents (4 reagent vials each), four vacuum-sealed sample
testing pouches of freeze-dried PCR reagents (3 reagent vials each), and four
pouches containing one tube each of reconstitution buffer and reagent grade water.
Once resuspended, each reagent vial provides enough material for two reactions,
both of which are included in the test run.
Each control pouch contains the following vials:
• One Target 1 Positive Control (+) vial. Once reconstituted, the Target 1
Positive Control vial contains all reagents necessary for Target 1 RT-PCR, in
addition to 395 copies/vial of RNA derived from a synthetic plasmid
containing the target 1 sequence (and not the target 2 sequence) from a
consensus influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) strain. The Target 1 Positive Control
is resuspended with 20 μL reconstitution buffer and 20 μL reagent grade water
before testing in parallel with patient specimens. Amplification of the Target 1
Positive Control gives assurance that kit reagents are functioning properly and
that the assay setup has been performed correctly. A Positive Target 1 Control
must be included with each JBAIDS run.
Ingredients: Each Positive Target 1 Control vial contains <0.001% DNA
polymerase complex; <0.001% Reverse Transcriptase from Moloney Murine
Leukemia Virus (MMLV- RT); <0.001% target-specific forward and reverse
primer; <0.001% target-specific hydrolysis probes; <0.05% dATP, dCTP,
dGTP, dTTP; <0.001% Influenza A/H5 Target 1 RNA; bovine serum albumin;
dithiothreitol; RNase OUT (recombinant ribonuclease inhibitor); and
carbohydrate.
Reconstituted contents: 40 µL
• One Target 2 Positive Control (+) vial. Once reconstituted, the Target 2
Positive Control vial contains all reagents necessary for Target 2 RT-PCR, in
addition to 335 copies/vial of RNA derived from a synthetic plasmid
containing the target 2 sequence (and not the target 1 sequence) from a
consensus influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) strain. The Target 2 Positive
Control is resuspended with 20 μL reconstitution buffer and 20 μL reagent
grade water before testing in parallel with patient specimens. Amplification in
the Target 2 Positive Control gives assurance that kit reagents are functioning
properly and that the assay setup has been performed correctly. A Positive
Target 2 Control must be included with each JBAIDS run.
Ingredients: Each Positive Target 2 Control vial contains <0.001%
DNA polymerase complex; <0.001% MMLV-RT; <0.001% target-
specific forward and reverse primer; <0.001% target-specific

Influenza A/H5 Target 2 RNA; bovine serum albumin; dithiothreitol;
RNase OUT; and carbohydrate.
Reconstituted contents: 40 µL
• One Target 1 Negative Control (-) vial. Once reconstituted, the Target 1
Negative Control vial contains all materials required to perform a RT-PCR
reaction except the Target 1 template, and should therefore give negative
results. The Target 1Negative Control is resuspended with 20 μL reconstitution
buffer and 20 μL reagent grade water before testing in parallel with patient
specimens to provide assurance that the setup procedure has been performed
without contamination. A Target 1 Negative Control must be included with
each JBAIDS run.
Ingredients: Each Target 1 Negative Control vial contains <0.001%
DNA polymerase complex; <0.001% MMLV-RT; <0.001% target-
specific forward and reverse primer; <0.001% target-specific
hydrolysis probes; <0.05% dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP; bovine serum
albumin; dithiothreitol; RNase OUT; and carbohydrate.
Reconstituted contents: 40 µL
• One Target 2 Negative Control (-) vial. Once reconstituted, the Target 2
Negative Control vial contains all materials required to perform a RT-PCR
reaction except the Target 2 template, and should therefore give negative
results. The Target 2 Negative Control is resuspended with 20 μL
reconstitution buffer and 20 μL reagent grade water before testing in parallel
with patient specimens to provide assurance that the setup procedure has been
performed without contamination. A Target 2 Negative Control must be
included with each JBAIDS run.
Ingredients: Each Target 1 Negative Control vial contains <0.001%
DNA polymerase complex; <0.001% MMLV-RT; <0.001% target-
specific forward and reverse primer; <0.001% target-specific
hydrolysis probes; <0.05% dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP; bovine serum
albumin; dithiothreitol; RNase OUT; and carbohydrate.
Reconstituted contents: 40 µL
Each sample testing pouch contains the following vials:
• One Sample Control vial. Once reconstituted, the Sample Control (SC) vial
contains reagents that amplify and detect the human genomic RNase P
sequence. The target sequence consists of RNase P-specific primer binding
sites and an RNase P-specific probe binding site. The Sample Control is
resuspended with 20 μL reconstitution buffer and 20 μL purified patient sample
to ensure patient nucleic acid is available in the sample, and that RT-PCR
inhibiting substances in the test specimen are detected, thereby preventing false
negative results.
Ingredients: Each Sample Control vial contains <0.001% DNA polymerase

Specific Novel Influenza A Viruses

Characteristics of In Vitro Diagnostic Devices for the Detection or Detection
and Differentiation of Influenza Viruses
L. Test Principle:
The JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection Kit is a real time RT-PCR
assay based on the influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) assays that are part of the “CDC
Human Influenza Virus Real-time RT-PCR Detection and Characterization Panel
(rRT-PCR Flu Panel)”. These assays have been re-optimized to work with Idaho
Technology’s proprietary freeze-dried PCR reagent formulation. Purified patient
samples (using either the IT 1-2-3TM VIBE Sample Purification Kit, or the IT 1-2-
3TM Platinum Path Purification Kit) are used to reconstitute the freeze-dried
reagents which are then tested using the JBAIDS instruments.
Real-time RT-PCR involves reverse transcription of specific RNA sequences into
complementary DNA sequences, followed by logarithmic amplification and
simultaneous detection of those DNA sequences. The JBAIDS Influenza A/H5
(Asian lineage) PCR primers specifically amplify conserved regions of the
hemagglutinin (HA) gene of the Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) virus. The
JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) assays use hydrolysis probes to detect
amplification of the transcribed RNA sequence of interest. Each hydrolysis probe is
labeled on 5’ end with a fluorescent reporter moiety (6-FAM) and internally with a
quencher (TAMRA), which prevents the probe from emitting fluorescent signal.
During PCR, the probe binds to a target sequence in the PCR product. When the
Taq polymerase replicates a template on which a hydrolysis probe is bound, the
exonuclease activity of the polymerase cleaves the probe, separating the fluorophore
from the quencher, and fluorescent signal is generated. This fluorescence is
measured and displayed by the JBAIDS instrument during the PCR reaction. The
fluorescent signal increases as additional template is amplified and more probe is
hydrolyzed.
The JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection Kit amplifies two target
RNA sequences within the hemagglutinin gene of Influenza A, a gene that encodes
one of two antigenic surface glycoproteins on the viral envelope. The primers and
probes for the two target sequences are specific to the H5 subtype (Asian lineage) of
the Influenza A virus. The primers and probes detect all sequenced virulent isolates
of H5 (Asian lineage) Influenza A, and no other hemagglutinin Influenza A
subtypes (as of January 2010, NCBI Influenza Virus Database). Target one is a 149
base sequence 5’ of the hemagglutinin precursor cleavage site. Target 2 is a 192
base sequence 3’ of the hemagglutinin precursor cleavage site.
The Sample Control for the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection Kit
amplifies the human gene encoding for ribonuclease P (RNase P).

--- Page 9 ---
The JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection kit can be used to test
human throat swabs and nasopharyngeal swabs. Samples must be purified prior to
testing with the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection Kit. The
purpose of sample purification is to release nucleic acid (RNA and DNA)
contained in the unknown sample and to remove extraneous materials (e.g.,
proteins and chemicals) that can damage the nucleic acid target or interfere with
the PCR reaction. The JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection Kit can
be used with either the IT 1-2-3 VIBE Sample Purification Kit or the IT 1-2-3
Platinum Path Purification Kit. The VIBE kit is based on spin column technology
while the Platinum Path kit uses magnetic bead technology. Both methods have
four basic steps; lysis to release the nucleic acids, binding of the nucleic acids to a
substrate (silica spin column or silica magnetic beads), washing away extraneous
materials and elution of the purified nucleic acid. A brief outline of the two
purification kit methods is provided below:

the nucleic acid remains bond to the magnetic
beads. The beads are washed twice (two
wells of the strip tube).
Elution of nucleic acids	An elution buffer is added to the spin column
with is then centrifuged to release the nucleic
acid from the column. The collected material
is the purified patient sample.	Using the pick-pen, the magnetic beads are
transferred to the last well of the strip tube
containing elution buffer. The nucleic acids
are released from the magnetic beads. The
beads are then removed from the sample
using the pick pen.

Control (PC) and a Negative Control (NC) for each of the two target assays. Each
sample tested requires duplicate capillaries of a Sample Control and two target
assays (Target 1 Unknown and Target 2 Unknown).
Reagents are set up in the following order:
1. Target 1 and 2 Unknowns – Reconstitute the reagent pellets in the Unknown
vials by adding 20 µL of the provided reconstitution buffer and 20 µL of the
purified sample.
2. Sample Control – Repeat the above process with a Sample Control vial.
3. Positive Control – After the Target 1 and Target 2 Unknowns and the Sample
Control are set up for each sample, set up the Target 1 and 2 Positive Controls
by reconstituting the pellet with 20 µL of the provided reconstitution buffer and
20 µL of the provided reagent-grade water.
4. Negative Control – Set up the Target 1 and 2 Negative Control last, using
reconstitution buffer and water, as described for the Positive Control.
5. For each reagent vial, transfer 19 µ L of the reconstituted reagent to each of two
capillaries following the same order used for reconstitution. Caps are placed on
the capillary tubes before proceeding to the next capillary.
6. Centrifuge the capillary tubes to ensure that the PCR reagent is in the tip of the
capillary.
Each JBAIDS test is analyzed and assigned a final result by the Detector module of
the JBAIDS Software. Possible final results are positive, negative, sample control
failure, uncertain, or invalid. To assign a final test result, Detector first analyzes the
data from each capillary independently before analyzing the sample duplicates
together. Finally, the software assigns a final result, or a combined call, based on the
results of the sample and all of its controls.
Each stage of the analysis is described below:
1. Independent Capillary Call
Detector does not rely on any single aspect of the amplification curve, but rather
integrates a number of factors, such as curve shape and signal-to-noise ratio into
a combined score. Curves scoring above a threshold are called positive, curves
scoring below a threshold are called negative, and curves scoring in a small area
in between are called uncertain. The scoring system has been carefully tuned to
match human expert calls on real amplification curve data. Detector calls differ
from expert calls about as frequently as two experts differ from each other.
A description of how Detector assigns test results is the following:
Negative – A curve is called negative if its shape can be closely approximated
by a line (or smooth curve), if it has low signal to noise, and if it shows little or
no increase in fluorescence during the PCR.
Positive – A curve is called positive if the fluorescence shows exponential
growth out of the background, if it has high signal to noise, and if the slope of
10

--- Page 11 ---
the exponential region of the amplification is consistent with a PCR efficiency
of around two.
Uncertain – For a small number of curves (about 0.2%) no clear call is possible
and the reaction is called uncertain.
In addition to the above criteria, Positive Controls must have a Cp value earlier
than an assay specific cutoff value. This cutoff value is established by
evaluating the historic variability of the Cp for the Positive Control and is used
to establish proper performance of the Positive Control.
2. Replicate Calls
Once each amplification curve is evaluated by Detector, the software evaluates
the sample duplicates according to the following rules:
Positive Control Replicates – The Positive Control is called a success only if
both capillaries are called positive.
Negative Control Replicates – The Negative Control is called a success only if
both capillaries are called negative.
Sample Control Replicates – A Sample Control is called a success only if both
capillaries are called positive.
Unknown Replicates – Unknowns are called as the following:
• Positive – An Unknown is called positive only if both capillaries are
called positive.
• Negative – An Unknown is called negative only if both capillaries are
called negative.
• Uncertain – An Unknown is called uncertain if the results of the two
capillaries do not match (e.g., positive/negative) or when both capillaries
are called uncertain.
3. Final Result for each Target Assay
The final test result is a combined call (or meta-call) based on the results of the
test sample and its associated controls. Failure of the Positive or Negative
Control results in invalid results for all associated samples. Sample Controls
with a SCFail (Sample Control Failure) result are further analyzed before a final
result is assigned. A SCFail result can indicate that the patient sample contains
substances capable of inhibiting the PCR reaction, there was inefficient sample
purification or that poor specimen collection occurred. In certain cases,
sufficient viral target may be recovered and detection of the sample control is
irrelevant. Therefore, failure of the Sample Control for a positive sample is of
no consequence because amplification of the target assays indicates that the
sample does not contain significant levels of PCR inhibitors.
Samples with SCFail (with a negative or uncertain Target assay result), invalid,
or uncertain results require follow-up testing in order to achieve a valid (positive
or negative) result.

4. JBAIDS Report
A JBAIDS report is generated automatically for each test run. When the
Diagnostic Wizard is used, reports from the instrument are identified with the
phrase “For In Vitro Diagnostic Use.”
5. Follow-up Testing
If the Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) assays both yield a negative or positive
test result, then JBAIDS testing is complete. Any other result requires follow-
up testing, as described below:
• Invalid – If either the Positive Control or Negative Control (for either
Target 1 or 2) fails to give the expected results, all Unknown samples for
that specific target assay are called invalid and must be retested using the
same purified samples.
• Inconclusive – An inconclusive result on a single sample requires
retesting with the same purified sample.
• Sample Control Failure - A failed Sample Control can occur from PCR
inhibition, inefficient sample purification, or poor specimen collection.
Any sample having a failed Sample Control assay (i.e. negative or
uncertain Sample Control assay associated with a negative or uncertain
Target assay) will be retested using the original (undiluted) purified
sample as well as a ten-fold dilution of the purified sample.
If the Sample Control Failure was due to an inhibitor present in the
sample, the repeat testing will again yield a result of inhibited for the
undiluted sample and a valid result (positive or negative) for the sample
diluted 1:10. The results from the retesting can be used for diagnostic
applications only if the diluted sample tests positive. A negative result
cannot be reported due to reduced sensitivity of the test system at the
1:10 dilution.
If the Sample Control Failure result was caused by improper technique,
or other factors, then the repeat testing for the undiluted sample may
yield a valid result (positive or negative). In this case, the result from the
retesting of the undiluted sample can be used for diagnostic applications.
If the Sample Control Failure was caused by ineffective sample
purification or an improperly collected specimen, then the repeat testing
will most likely be Sample Control Failure. In this case, residual patient
specimen can be retested (provided it was appropriately stored) or a new
specimen should be requested.

6. Result Interpretation
The JBIADS software automatically interprets the results for each of the target
assays. The results of the two target assay are used to make the final test
interpretation and based upon the final test interpretation, specific actions are
required.
• Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) RNA not detected – The JBAIDS test
results for Target 1 and Target 2 were Negative and all controls
performed as expected.
• Presumptive positive for Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) virus - The
JBAIDS test results for Target 1 and Target 2 assay were positive. Report
to established DoD reporting structure. (All suspected, presumptive
positive or confirmed cases of Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) shall be
reported to the respective military installation/command Public Health
Emergency Officer (PHEO). The PHEO will then notify, through
established reporting channels, the appropriate chain-of- command, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), state/local
government public health agencies, and host nations if outside of the
United States (OCONUS)).
• Inconclusive for Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) virus – The JBAIDS
test results for Target 1 and Target 2 are discordant (one target is positive
or uncertain and the other target is negative, uncertain, invalid or sample
control failure). Retesting of purified sample (if available) is required. If
retest is still inconclusive and sufficient sample is available, re-purify and
retest. If results remain inconclusive, it is considered a suspected case of
Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage). Report to established DoD reporting
structure. (All suspected, presumptive positive or confirmed cases of
Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) shall be reported to the respective
military installation/command Public Health Emergency Officer (PHEO).
The PHEO will then notify, through established reporting channels, the

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A multicenter reproducibility study was performed to determine the overall
system reproducibility of the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection
Kit on the JBAIDS instruments. This study was performed at Idaho Technology
Inc. (ITI) and two external sites, Naval Health Research Center (NHRC) and
Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC). The study was conducted with two
specimen types: throat swabs (TS) and nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), both
collected in viral transport medium (VTM). Both specimen types were purified
using two different Sample Purification Kits, the IT 1-2-3 VIBE and the IT 1-2-3
Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit.
A panel of eight TS specimens, spiked with an inactivated Influenza A/H5 (Asian
lineage) virus strain (Vietnam/1203/04 x PR8 strain) at three different
concentrations (LoD/15, LoD, and 3X LoD), were tested twice each day for three
consecutive days at the three testing sites. The panel was tested for an additional
day at ITI (total of 4 testing days at ITI). On each testing day, two operators at
each site purified and tested one aliquot of each specimen, 8 total specimens per
operator per day. One of the operators used the IT 1-2-3 VIBE Sample
Purification Kit and the other operator used the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path Sample
Purification Kit.

A second panel of eight NPS specimens, spiked with an inactivated Influenza
A/H5 (Asian lineage) virus strain at three different concentrations (LoD/15, LoD,
and 3X LoD), were tested twice each day for another three consecutive days at the
three testing sites. The panel was tested for an additional day at ITI (total of 4
testing days at ITI). On each testing day, two operators at each site purified and
tested one aliquot of each specimen, 8 total specimens per operator per day. One
of the operators used the IT 1-2-3 VIBE Sample Purification Kit and the other
operator used the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit.
Sample panels were prepared by spiking 8 pooled TS and 8 pooled NPS
specimens collected in viral transport medium (VTM) from normal healthy
volunteers with an inactivated Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) strain
(Vietnam/1203/04 x PR8 strain) at designated levels. The TS and NPS specimen
pools were spiked at three concentrations of the inactivated Influenza A/H5
(Asian lineage) virus, representing a high negative sample (approximately 15-fold
lower than LoD), a low positive sample (at LoD), and a medium positive sample
(3X LoD). The test system LoD using live virus was determined to be 50
EID /mL for both TS and NPS samples in the LoD study. However, in a separate
50
study, the “Template Comparison for the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage)
Detection Kit Study”, it was determined that the stock of inactivated virus used in
the reproducibility study contains nearly 15-fold less RNA as compared to the live
reassortant virus used to determine the LoD. Therefore, the equivalent LoD for the
inactivated virus is approximately 750 EID /mL.

Following spiking, each sample pool was aliquoted into several individual use
vials that were placed at 2-8°C until testing. On the day the specimen pools were
prepared, an appropriate number of single use aliquots were shipped to the two
external sites (BAMC and NHRC) and one of the aliquots was tested at ITI.
Positive Control (PC) and Negative Control (NC) reactions for both Target 1 and
Target 2 were included in all 102 JBAIDS runs performed in the reproducibility
study. Overall, 99 out of 102 (97.1%) runs had successful PCs and NCs for both
target assays. The PC results were of good run-to-run precision, with an average
Cp of 32.52 ±0.35 (1.08 % CV) for the Target 1 PC and an average Cp of 32.95 ±
0.44 (1.34% CV) for the Target 2 PC. Of the three invalid runs, two were the
result of user error (in one run, the PCs were reconstituted incorrectly and in the

failure of the Target 2 PC. Upon retesting, all controls were successful.
The Sample Control assay (human RNase P assay) was tested with each purified
sample to detect inhibition, poor sample extraction, or poor specimen collection.
A total of 364 out of 367 (99.2%) Sample Control reactions produced the
expected positive results in the reproducibility study. The Sample Control results
were of good run-to-run precision, with an average Cp of 30.11 ±1.44 (4.78 % CV)
for the TS (Platinum Path) Sample Control, an average Cp of 31.40 ± 0.73 (2.32%

CV) for the NPS (Platinum Path) Sample Control, and an average Cp of 31.04 ±
1.08 (3.48% CV) for the NPS (VIBE) Sample Control. Sample Controls for two
TS specimens purified using the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path kit and one NPS
specimen purified with IT 1-2-3 VIBE initially failed (gave negative results)
initially, however all were successful upon retesting.

For the specimens spiked at 3X LoD (medium positive) all 30 gave positive test
results for both sample types (TS and NPS) and both purification kits (VIBE and
Platinum Path). Specimens spiked at the LoD (low positive) gave positive test
results for all (30/30) specimens (TS and NPS) purified using the VIBE kit while
29/30 tested positive when purified using the Platinum Path purification kit. As
expected, specimens spiked at 1/15 LoD (high negative) gave inconclusive test
results for most specimens due to negative results for the Target 2 assay. This
finding is consistent with slight differences in sensitivity between the two target
assays when testing Vietnam/1203/04 x PR8 strain. For detection of the
Anhui/01/05 x PR8 strain, the Target 2 assay is slightly more sensitive than the
Target 1 assay (refer to the LoD study of the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5(Asian
lineage) Detection Kit). These results also confirm the estimated LoD of the
system. There were no significant differences in test system sensitivity and
reproducibility when specimens were processed using the Platinum Path
purification kit vs. the VIBE purification kit.
This reproducibility data also demonstrated that as expected with all real-time
PCR assays, the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection Test may not
generate reproducibly positive results when testing samples that have analyte
concentrations lower than the LoD concentration, but higher than the assay cutoff
concentration. This limitation should be addressed by including the following
statement in the Limitation section of the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage)
Detection Kit Instructions for Use: “The JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage)
Detection Kit may not generate reproducibly positive results when testing
samples that have analyte concentrations lower than the LoD concentration, but
higher than the assay cutoff concentration.”
The variability of the Cp value can be used as an additional measure of the
variability of JBAIDS assays. Unlike other real time PCR systems, the JBAIDS
does not employ the Cp value to determine if an amplification curve is called
positive or negative. Instead, the Detector module of the JBAIDS software
performs a series of evaluations (e.g., curve shape, signal to noise) to determine if
each amplification curve is called positive, negative, or uncertain. Only curves
with positive or uncertain results are assigned a Cp value. While the Cp result is
not used to determine the test result, samples with the same template
concentration tested with the same assay are expected to have a similar Cp.
Therefore, the average and %CV of Cp values obtained in this study were used to
further evaluate the precision/reproducibility of the test system.

Negative Control (NC)
The NC is used to detect contamination from target-specific amplified product,
synthetic RNA (as found in the PC vials), or organism. Each JBAIDS run requires
one NC (resulting in two capillaries) for the Target 1 and one for the Target 2
assays (total of 4 capillaries). For each target assay, both of the NC capillaries
must be negative, or the JBAIDS software will assign invalid results for that target
assay to all of the samples in that run, and the run must be repeated. Frequent or
repeated failures of NCs may indicate significant contamination of the work area.

Positive Control (PC)
The PC serves as an amplification and detection control. Each JBAIDS run
requires one PC (resulting in two capillaries) for the Target 1 assay and one for
the Target 2 assay (total of 4 capillaries). For each target assay, both of the PC
capillaries must be positive and have Cp results that are earlier than the assay‘s
specific cutoff value. The assay specific cutoff was initially set at less than or
equal to 40 Cp in the software. The assay specific cutoff in the final released
software will be set to the top of the manufacturing release criteria (35.23 for
Target 1 and 35.68 for Target 2) plus 3 standard deviations of the variability of the
controls observed during the clinical trial (0.63 for Target 1 and 1.21 for Target 2).
If either capillary fails (i.e. Target 1 less than or equal to 37.1 Cp, or Target 2 less
than or equal to 39.3 Cp), the JBAIDS software will assign invalid results for that
target assay to all of the associated samples, and the run must be repeated. Failure
of the PCs may indicate errors in sample setup, degradation of the reagents, or a
malfunction of the JBAIDS instrument. If the SC capillaries in the same test run
are positive, then the failure is most likely caused by an isolated error with the
setup of the PC. If the Sample Control (SC) capillaries are also negative, possible
causes for failure are 1) a systematic error in sample setup, 2) degradation of the
reagents, or 3) a malfunction of the JBAIDS instrument. The product releasing
criteria (in terms of Cp values) for the Target 1 PC is 30.73-35.23, and for Target
2 PC is 31.18-35.68.
1. Each JBAIDS run performed in the LoD study included Positive Control (PC)
and Negative Control (NC) reactions. Of the 93 runs performed in the study,
91 (97.8%) had successful PC reactions. The mean PC Cp value for Target 1
was 33.38 ± 0.36 (1.08% CV) and for Target 2 was 34.18 ± 0.42 (1.23% CV).
2. Positive Control (PC) and Negative Control (NC) reactions for both Target 1
and Target 2 were also included in all 102 JBAIDS runs performed in the
reproducibility study. Overall, 99 out of 102 (97.1%) runs had successful
PCs and for both target assays. The mean PC Cp value for Target 1 was 32.52
±0.35 (1.08 % CV) and for Target 2 was 32.95 ± 0.44 (1.34% CV).
3. Positive Control (PC) and Negative Control (NC) reactions for both Target 1
and Target 2 assays were included in every JBAIDS run during the surrogate
sample testing at the Midwest Research Institute (MRI) to estimate clinical
sensitivity. All PC and NC reactions were successful in all runs performed for
this study. The mean PC Cp value for Target 1 was 34.38 ± 0.74 (2.15 % CV)
and for Target 2 was 35.58 ± 0.92 (2.59% CV).
4. Positive Control (PC) and Negative Control (NC) reactions for both Target 1
and Target 2 assays were also included in every JBAIDS run during the
clinical study. Overall, 511 out of 519 (98.5%) runs had successful PCs for
both target assays. The mean PC Cp value for Target 1 was 33.14 ±0.63 (1.90
% CV) and for Target 2 was 33.85 ± 1.21 (3.57% CV).
Sample Control (SC)
20

--- Page 21 ---
The Sample Control assay detects the human RNase P gene. This assay is
designed to guard against false negative results caused by an improperly collected
specimen, ineffective purification of nucleic acids and or inhibition of the PCR
reaction. A properly collected throat or NPS specimen contains human cells from
which the RNase P target is recovered during sample purification. Following
purification, each sample is then tested with the two Influenza A/H5 target assays,
as well as, the Sample Control assay. If extraction and amplification were
successful, then the Sample Control Assay will give the expected positive test
result for both capillaries. The Sample Control is considered to be successful only
if both Sample Control capillaries are positive. The JBAIDS software
automatically assigned a result of sample control failure when 1) the Sample
Control is unsuccessful and 2) the target assay is negative (or uncertain). If the
target assay is positive, then the sample is positive regardless of the result of the
Sample Control assay. Because the results of the two Influenza A/H5 target
assays are interpreted separately, it is possible to have a sample control failure for
one of the target assays and a positive result of the other target.
a. A Sample Control assay (human RNase P) was tested with each purified
sample for the refined LoD estimation and the LoD confirmation study. Of
328 Sample Controls, only 11 (3.4%) tests did not produce a positive result
(i.e. were negative or uncertain):

within expectations, as samples were prepared with individually collected
throat swab and nasopharyngeal swab specimens in the LoD study.

The performance of the Sample Control for both sample types and purification
kits was similar. Because the reproducibility study used specimen pools
instead of individually prepared specimens, the observed variability of the Cp
values for the Sample Controls in this study are slightly less (standard
deviation ranging from 0.73-1.44) than that seen in other studies that used
individually prepared specimens.
c. A Sample Control assay (human RNase P assay) was tested with each purified

Extraction Control (EC)
Positive Extraction Control (PEC) was not provided with the kit, and inclusion of a
PEC with each batch of extracted samples is not a standard part of the testing
protocol recommended in the product package insert. However, during the clinical
study, a PEC and a NEC were purified with each batch of clinical samples.
Inclusion of a NEC with each batch of purified samples is a standard part of the
testing protocol recommended in the product package insert. The PEC was

successful and the associated samples were considered to have valid results. If the
retest failed, then the results for the samples extracted with that PEC or NEC were
considered invalid. Of a total of 172 PEC and NEC tested during the clinical trial,
164 of PEC (95.3%) and 167 of NEC controls (97.1%) gave correct results initially.
The mean Cp of the PEC tested for Target 1 was 31.08, with 1.85 Standard
Deviation (SD) and 5.95 % CV. The mean Cp of the PEC tested for Target 2 was
34.46, with 1.62 Standard Deviation (SD) and 4.70 % CV.
Specimen Stability
The sponsor recommends that TS and NPS specimens be collected using Dacron or
other synthetic swabs and placed into viral transport media (VTM). Once collected,
specimens may be tested immediately after collection, transported to an off-site
testing location, or temporarily stored until testing can be scheduled. Inappropriate
handling or storage may compromise the integrity of the specimens and cause
inaccurate test results. An analytical study determining the appropriate storage
times and temperatures for both unprocessed specimens (e.g., the TS and NPS
specimens) and processed samples (e.g., purified nucleic acid from TS and NPS
specimens) was carried out. The specimen transport and storage conditions that
were evaluated are based on common clinical laboratory workflows.
Results from a pilot study assessing the stability of stored specimens spiked with
inactivated Flu A/H5 virus suggested that unprocessed specimens stored under the
conditions evaluated in this study continued to give accurate test results.
For the unprocessed specimen transport and storage evaluation, both negative (i.e.,
matrix blank) and positive (i.e., spiked with reassortant Flu A/H5 virus at the
established LoD concentration) specimens were assessed. Eight positive (two full
JBAIDS runs) and four negative (one full JBAIDS run) specimens were processed
at each time point and storage condition with each purification kit (VIBE and
Platinum Path) prior to testing with the freeze-dried reagents. Both matrix types
(TS and NPS) were evaluated independently.
For the purified sample transport and storage evaluation, eight positive samples
and four negative samples that had been processed with each purification method
(VIBE and Platinum Path) were tested immediately and also aliquoted for storage
under various conditions prior to retesting with the freeze-dried reagents.
Testing of positive specimens was used to determine whether sample storage can
cause false negative results due to degradation of the virus or the purified nucleic
acid. Although an unlikely result, testing known negative specimens evaluated
whether sample storage can cause false positive test results. Testing of negative
specimens also allowed for an evaluation of the effect of storage on the result of
the Sample Control assay. The storage conditions evaluated are summarized in the
following table:
23

Day 3, refrigerated (2-8°C) Day 1, refrigerated (2-8°C)
Day 30, frozen (< -15°C) Day 30 , frozen (< -15°C)
Extended frozen (< -15°C)
The average crossing point (Cp) and relative maximum fluorescence (Fmax) values
obtained when the stored samples were tested were compared to the Day 0 results.
The Cp value depends on two factors: 1) the number of target copies in the reaction
and 2) the efficiency of the PCR reaction. A significant increase (>3 cycles) in the
average Cp value for a specific time point was suggestive of either degradation of
the template during storage or a reduction in the PCR efficiency (possibly due to
the presence of inhibitors). Significantly reduced Fmax values are usually
associated with flattening of the amplification curve and are an indication of lower
PCR efficiency. A significant decrease (>50%) in the average Fmax for a sample
set at a specific time point (e.g., Day 30) compared to the baseline (Day 0) average
is suggestive of reduced test system performance.
The results from this evaluation study demonstrated that accurate test results were
obtained when specimens and samples are handled according to the following
conditions:
Proper Storage of Specimens and Samples

Platinum Path sample purification kits.

defined as the lowest concentration of virus per mL of specimen (expressed as
EID /mL) that was detected by both A/H5 (Asian lineage) assays (Target 1 and
50
Target 2) 95% (19/20) of the time.
The LoD was initially estimated by spiking TS specimens with serial dilutions of
quantified live Influenza A/H5N1 reassortant viruses (Vietnam/1203/04 x PR8 and
Anhui/01/05 x PR8). The spiked specimens were purified using either the IT 1-2-
3™ VIBE or IT 1-2-3™ Platinum Path purification kit and then tested. The LoD
was estimated to be the lowest concentration of organism for which all or most
replicates tested positive with both of the Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) target
assays (Target 1 and Target 2). Based upon the results of the initial estimate,
refined dilution series were prepared and tested with both sample matrices (TS and
NPS) and with all three detection kit assays (Target 1, Target 2, and the Sample
Control assay). Results from the refined dilution series were used to estimate the
LoD. Once determined, the estimated LoD was confirmed by testing 20
independent TS samples and 20 independent NPS samples spiked at the specified
LoD level using both of the sample purification kits. Each LoD confirmation run
included an unspiked matrix blank (MB) that served as an external negative control
for each batch of purified specimens. The LoD was independently established
using two different reassortant virus strains (Vietnam/1203/04 x PR8 and
Anhui/01/05 x PR8).
The initial estimates of the Influenza A/H5N1 reassortant viruses were between 10
and 100 EID /mL for the Anhui/01/05 x PR8 strain and 10 and 1 EID /mL for the
50 50
Vietnam/1203/04 x PR8 strain. Confirmation testing for the Anhui/01/05 x PR8
strain was initiated at 10 EID /mL. Due to a large number of indeterminate results
50
(i.e., positive for only one of the target assays), the estimated LoD level was
increased to 50 EID /mL. At 50 EID /mL, all 20 individually spiked TS and NPS
50 50
samples purified with both the IT 1-2-3 VIBE and IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path sample
purification kits gave positive results for both assays and both viral strains
(Vietnam/1203/04 x PR8 and Anhui/01/05 x PR8).
In conclusion, for TS and NPS specimens containing live Influenza A/H5N1, the
confirmed JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection Kit system LoD is
50 EID /mL, which was detected in 80 out of 80 specimens (20 TS samples
50
purified with both kits and 20 NPS samples purified with both kits) for each strain
of Influenza A/H5N1:

e. Analytical Reactivity:
An analytical reactivity study was carried out at the Midwest Research Institute
(MRI) using surrogate samples. The avian influenza A viruses are divided between
high pathogenicity (HPAI) strains and low pathogenicity (LPAI) strains based on
their characteristic pathogenesis and genetic patterns. LPAI strains generally cause
only mild disease in birds, while HPAI strains are associated with high morbidity
and mortality. HPAI strains of the subtypes H5 and H7 (e.g. H5N1, H7N7, and
H7N3) have also been associated with human infections, causing a wide range of
disease severity from mild (H7N3 and H7N7) to sometimes fatal (H5N1 and H7N7).
The HPAI H5N1 subtype, commonly referred to as the ‘Asian lineage’, has caused
human infections in Africa, Asia, the Near East, the Pacific, and Europe. The
majority of cases have been reported by four countries: Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt,
and Thailand. Within this subtype, the viruses are further subdivided into clades (e.g.
Clade 1, Clade 2 and subclades). The subclades 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 are among those
that have been isolated from human infections.
In this analytical reactivity study, the following eight strains of HPAI/H5N1 viruses
were tested:

In accordance with the CDC approved protocol, the TCID /mL quantification was
50
confirmed by spiking a contrived sample type (A549 cells in F12K media) with
designated levels of virus. The prepared samples were then purified using the
Qiagen Viral RNA mini kit followed by testing with the appropriate FDA cleared
CDC assays (FluA/H5a, FluA/H5b and the Sample Control). The results obtained
were compared to previous lot quantification and determined to be acceptable.
Per protocol, the same prepared samples using a contrived sample matrix of A549
cells in F12K medium were also tested by the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian
lineage) Detection Kit. Poor detection of the viruses was observed at concentrations
as high as 10,000 TCID /mL for some of the virus strains. An investigation
50
revealed that the F12K medium was causing inhibition of the system. Since this
contrived sample matrix was not representative of the intended sample matrix, it
was determined that TS in VTM would be used as the sample matrix for this study.
Using the same qualified viral stocks, MRI prepared spiked simulated specimens
(TS in VTM) at concentrations of 10, 100, and 1000 TCID /mL for each of the
50
eight inclusivity panel viruses. The spiked specimens were purified using the IT 1-
2-3 Platinum Path purification kit prior to testing with the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5
(Asian lineage) Detection Kit freeze-dried reagents on the JBAIDS instrument.
In addition, performance of the two reference strains
(A/Vietnam/1203/2004(H5N1)-PR8/CDC-RG and A/Anhui/01/2005(H5N1)-PR8-
IBCDC-RG), tested in this study in units of TCID /mL, were compared to the
50
results obtained in the LoD study to determine a TCID /mL level that gave similar
50
performance to established system LoD (50 EID /mL).
50
Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity) Panel Testing using the FDA-cleared CDC
rRT-PCR Flu Panel:
Eight live Influenza A/H5N1 (HPAI) viruses were spiked into a contrived matrix
sample (A549 cells and virus in F12K medium) at concentrations of 10, 100, 1,000
and 10,000 TCID /mL. Sample purification and testing was performed according
50
the CDC assay protocol. As per the CDC protocol, amplification curves are
positive only when there is an amplification curve with a Ct value <37. The
overall test for each sample is positive when both target assays are positive,
negative when both target assays are negative and the sample control is positive
and inconclusive when the results of the two target assays are discordant.
All viral strains gave positive test results at concentrations of 10,000 and 1,000
TCID /mL. Four of the strains (A/Chicken/Yunnan/1251/2003 (H5N1),
50
A/JapaneseWhiteEye/HongKong/1038/2006,
A/ScalyBreastedMunia/HongKong/45/2006, and A/Anhui/01/2005 (H5N1)-PR8-
IBCDC-RG) gave positive results at 100 TCID /mL and no strain was positive at
50
10 TCID /mL. All results are shown in the following table:

50
All eight viruses produced positive results (detection with both Target assays)
when spiked at 100 and 1,000 TCID /mL. At 10 TCID /mL two strains
50 50
(A/Japanese white eye/Hong Kong/1038/2006 and A/Anhui/01/2005 (H5N1)-

For those samples that initially tested uncertain (typically one positive and one
negative capillary) the extracted sample was retested. Results remained the same
for both targets and the sample control, retest values are in italics. All results are
shown in the table below. Unless otherwise noted, the Cp value for each test result
is an average of the two capillaries associated with this test result. When only one
capillary gives a positive result, the test result is uncertain. In those cases, the Cp
value is for only one capillary. As opposed to the CDC test system, the Cp value is
not used to determine the test result. Instead, the Detector module of the JBAIDS
software evaluates each curve using several parameters (e.g., curve shape, signal to
noise) to determine if it should be called positive or negative. Only curves with
positive (or uncertain) results are assigned Cp values.

Comparison and Correlation of EID /mL to TCID /mL based on Cp Values
50 50
The LoD study with Vietnam/1203/04 x PR8 and Anhui/01/05 x PR8 H5N1 strains
determined that the LoD of the JBAIDS system to be 50 EID /mL. This was based
50
on the lowest concentration of virus that was successfully detected 95% (19/20) of
the time for both targets and both strains. The Cp values obtained at LoD for virus
spiked into TS in VTM and extracted using Platinum Path were as follows: Target
1 Cp=36.64±3.05 and Target 2 Cp=34.05±1.44 for Anhui/01/05 x PR8 and Target
1 Cp=31.87±1.29 and Target 2 Cp=33.56±0.58 for Vietnam/1203/04 x PR8. As
shown in the table above, the Cps obtained for the VNH5N1-PR8/CDC-RG strain
tested at 1,000 TCID /mL, Target 1 = 31.23 and Target 2 = 33.88, were very
50
similar to those obtained at a LoD of 50 EID /mL. When evaluating the data
50
reported above for the A/Anhui/01/2005 (H5N1)-PR8-IBCDC-RG strain, the Cps
obtained for both targets at 1,000 TCID /mL, Target 1 = 35.47 and Target 2 =
50
34.42, were within one standard deviation of those obtained at the LoD of
EID /mL. This data demonstrates that the performance of the JBAIDS Influenza
50
A/H5 Detection kit is roughly similar for sample spiked at roughly 500 to 1,000
TCID /mL of these live virus strains when compared to 50 EID /mL of the
50 50
reassortant viral stocks used to establish the test system LoD.
In conclusion, the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection
System detected all eight FluA/H5N1 (HPAI) virus strains included in
the inclusivity panel. All strains gave positive results (detected by both
target assays) at 1,000 and 100 TCID /mL. At 10 TCID /mL, two
50 50
strains have positive result, 3 were negative and 3 gave inconclusive test
results. These results are equivalent to those obtained with the FDA-
cleared CDC assays.
In addition, while testing with the JBAIDS system detected both target 1
and 2 for all strains at 100 TCID /mL, comparison to Cp values at LoD
50
(reported in EID /mL) indicated that some viruses were at the edge of
50
detection and therefore, the TCID /mL LoD was correlated (based on Cp)
50
to the EID /mL LoD and determined to be roughly between 500 to 1,000
50
TCID /mL.

f. Analytical Specificity/Cross-reactivity Evaluation:
The analytical specificity study involved testing a defined panel of
viruses/organisms that may be encountered in specimens collected for FluA/H5
(Asian lineage) diagnostic testing but that should not be detected by the assay by
design. The organisms/viruses making up the exclusivity panel were grown, identity
confirmed, and titered/quantified. Each organism/virus was tested once at a high
concentration; bacteria/fungi were tested as close to 106 CFU/mL as possible, while
viruses were tested as close to 105 TCID /mL or 105 EID /mL as possible
50 50
depending on the stock concentrations. The organisms/viruses stocks were directly
spiked into individually collected throat swab specimens in VTM (not pooled) and
were not diluted or manipulated in any way prior to spiking. The spiked specimens
were then processed using the IT 1-2-3 VIBE Sample Purification Kit prior to
30

--- Page 31 ---
testing with the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 Detection Kit assays. (Note: The VIBE and
Platinum Path kit were demonstrated to produce nearly identical results with the
VIBE kit occasionally appearing to be slightly more efficient at nucleic acid
extraction based on the LoD study).
A spiked positive control sample was included with each batch of organisms
purified with the VIBE kit. This spiked positive control material consisted of
pooled throat swab specimens spiked with inactivated influenza A/H5 virus
(Vietnam/1203/04 x PR8) that was aliquoted and frozen. This is the same material
that was used as a spiked positive control in the clinical (specificity) study.
Stability of this material stored at ≤ -15°C for up to 90 days has been validated in
a separate study.
Exclusivity Testing of Seasonal Influenza Viruses:
Three FluA/H3N2 viruses, five FluA/H1N1 viruses, and five FluB viruses were
each individually spiked into throat swab specimens at the highest concentration
possible using 100 µL of the Zeptometrix validated and titered stocks. The final test
concentrations ranged from 3.8 x 103 to 1.71 x 106 TCID /mL. All 13 viruses
50
produced negative results for both FluA/H5 (Asian lineage) target assays and
positive results for the Sample Control assay:

secondary infection following viral infection, the remaining four panel members can
be encountered as normal flora in the nasopharynx, throat, or other body sites. All
twelve organisms produced negative results for both FluA/H5 (Asian lineage) target
assays and positive results for the Sample Control assay. One organism, Bordetella
pertussis, initially gave an indeterminate result (Target 1 positive, Target 2
uncertain) but was negative when a second sample was prepared and tested. The
original purified sample was not retested. It is assumed that the first B. pertussis
sample became contaminated with FluA/H5 material from the spiked positive
control sample that was purified and tested directly alongside it, especially as the
positive capillaries had very low maximum fluorescence values as well as a late Cp
value for Target 1.

* The first Bordetella pertussis spiked sample gave a positive result for Target 1 and an uncertain result for Target 2.
To ascertain if these results were due to possible contamination from the neighboring FluA/H5N1-
spiked control sample, a new sample was spiked with B. pertussis and re-purified/retested. Results of
the retest were negative for both FluA/H5 (Asian lineage) target assays.
In conclusion, the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection System
correctly excluded all 45 organisms/viruses included in the exclusivity panels,
including all types and subtypes of non-H5 influenza tested. No cross-reactivity
to seasonal influenza strains, non-H5 HA type avian influenza strains that are
known to infect human either sporadically or epidemically, low pathogenicity
avian influenza (LPAI) H5N1 strains, and A/H5 North American lineage
strains, other respiratory pathogens, or normal flora was detected.
Exclusivity Testing of 2009 H1N1 Influenza:
2009 H1N1 Influenza strains were not included in the analytical crossreactivity
study. However, one of the clinical sites in the clinical study (specificity) study,
Tripler Army Medical Center (TAMC), Honolulu, Hawaii, tested residual frozen
NPS and TS specimens collected when the 2009 H1N1 Influenza was prevalent
(June 2009 to Dec. 2009). There was a total of 25 clinical specimens that were
confirmed to be positive for 2009 H1N1 Influenza by the CDC’s Swine Flu
Panel under an Emergency Use Authorization EUA from the FDA included in
the clinical testing using the JBAIDS A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection Kit at
TAMC. All 25 specimens tested negative with the JBAIDS A/H5 (Asian lineage)
Detection Kit demonstrating 100% specificity for the device testing 2009 H1N1
Influenza positive clinical specimens.
g. Assay cut-off:
Each JBAIDS test is analyzed with the data analysis module. The module is called
Detector. The module determines the outcome of the tests conducted on the samples.
The module first analyzes the data from each capillary independently. Then the
replicates of the samples are analyzed together. Finally the module interprets the
outcome of these analyses for the sample and its controls.
The analysis module algorithm consists of two basic parts. The first identifies
samples that are obviously positive or negative (Obvious Tests), and second that
computes a refined estimate of the samples status when the sample is not called an
obvious positive or obvious negative (Expert Test). The algorithms are based on an
Expert System approach to determining positive and negative samples, but the
approach is not learning after release, and is deterministic meaning that every
sample will have the same outcome every time the algorithm evaluates the sample.
The purpose of Obvious Tests is to call those samples that are clearly positive or
negative. In this way, only non-obvious samples will need to be processed by the
more computationally involved detector algorithms. Obvious tests produce internal
scores and compare them against fixed thresholds to return a
35

part

CFU/mL	Negative	Negative	31.04

--- Page 36 ---
positive/negative/uncertain call. Expert Tests algorithm is based on mathematically
modeling the expected shapes of the amplification curves of positive and negative
samples. The model itself is based on tests for nine distinct characteristics in the
amplification curves and it assigns nine test scores to each curve. After the tests are
scored, the amplification curve is scored as a weighted sum of the tests.
Thresholds for the Obvious Tests and weights in the Expert Tests for Detector were
determined using training data sets and numerical optimization to pick parameters
that ensure Detector minimizes the number of error observed in real-world data.
Validation data from JBAIDS Customer Validation Testing, and Dugway
Operational Assessment were gathered and evaluated with Detector to validate the
analysis module algorithm. These data contain samples from five separate data sets:
typical data, atypical data, negative dominated, RNA data and Dugway field data.
The data were gathered from varied sources, including a variety of assays,
instruments and users, to obtain examples of all possible JBAIDS data. There are
28,467 samples in the data sets. 99.6% of the samples were correctly called by the
Detector. 0.19% of the samples were called “Uncertain” and 0.21% of the samples
were incorrectly called.
h. Interfering Substances:
An interfering substances study was carried out to examine whether a panel of
endogenous and exogenous potential RT-PCR inhibitors and technique-specific
substances (substances that could be introduced into the PCR reaction as
contaminants during sample purification or during reaction setup) affect the
performance of the JBAIDS A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection Kit. For each
endogenous, exogenous and technique specific test substance, one TS and/or NPS
specimen containing inactivated FluA/H5 virus (Vietnam/1203/04 x PR8) at a
concentration equivalent to 3X LoD was spiked with the appropriate amount of test
substance. The LoD determined for the live reassortant viruses is 50 EID /mL. This
50
is approximately equivalent to 750 EID /mL of the inactivated reassortant virus as
50
determined in the “Template Comparison for the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 Detection
Kit”. Specimens were therefore spiked at 2,250 EID /mL with the inactivated
50
reassortant virus. In each round of purifications, one specimen was prepared that
did not contain a test substance. This sample served as a control to which the other
specimens were compared. All specimens (except those containing Platinum Path
technique specific substances) were purified with both the IT 1-2-3 VIBE Sample
Purification Kit the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit. Each purified
sample was tested with the FluA/H5 (Asian lineage) Target 1 and Target 2 assays
and the Sample Control assay.
When possible, levels of tested substances were taken from CLSI document EP7-A,
“Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry: Approved Guideline”. For those
substances not listed in document EP7-A, a level was chosen that would be above
that expected in an actual collected swab sample. As the technique-specific
substances associated with the IT 1-2-3 VIBE kit have been thoroughly assessed in
previous FDA submissions (JBAIDS Plague Detection System k072631 and the
36

--- Page 37 ---
JBAIDS Tularemia Detection System k072547), this evaluation limited technique-
specific substances to components of the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path sample purification
kit.

Additionally, the effect of different concentrations of human DNA on the assay was
also evaluated. A dilution series of commercially-prepared human DNA was
prepared and spiked into the reaction vials along with synthetic target RNA at a 3 X
nucleic acid LoD concentration. The highest DNA concentration (187 ng/µL) tested
in this study is considerably higher than what is normally achieved in a purified TS
or NPS sample (as assessed by PCR amplification Cp values).
Each of the test substances were assessed separately. Target 1, Target 2, and Sample
Control results were used to evaluate the effect that each test substance had on
amplification or detection of target sequences. Depending on the concentration,
inhibitors can cause false negative test results, delays in Cp values or reduction in
fluorescence. Substances were considered to be potential inhibitors if the result for
any of the assays (Target 1, Target 2 or Sample Control) was negative, or if the Cp
value was delayed by three or more cycles or for which the Fmax value was reduced
by 50% or more when compared to the no-test substance control in the same
JBAIDS run. These criteria allow for identification of potential PCR inhibitors
while taking into account the intrinsic system variability. Any substance that
showed evidence of interfering with PCR was retested to verify the original result
and to evaluate the effect of lower concentrations of the test substance. Samples
having uncertain results that retest uncertain were also re-evaluated.

The endogenous substances did not show inhibition for the Influenza A/H5 (Asian
lineage) detection system for either extraction kit. All substance-containing samples
gave positive test results for both target assays as well as for the Sample Control
assay. For the Target 1 assay, Cp values for the test substances ranged from being
1.22 cycles earlier to1.70 cycles later when compared to the no-substance control.
For Target 2, the ∆Cp values ranged from being 1.54 cycles earlier to 2.17 cycles
later. The Sample Control Cp value ranges were similar to those for Targets 1 and 2
(-1.87 to 1.97 cycles). For all assays, the Fmax values were similar to the no-
substance control values (80%-133%). All of these values are within the described
acceptance criteria (∆Cp <3, Fmax >50%). This data demonstrates that higher than
expected levels of blood or mucin contained in NPS or TS samples will not interfere
with obtaining accurate test results with the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage)
Detection Kit.
Exogenous Substances:
The exogenous substances did not show inhibition for the Influenza A/H5 (Asian
lineage) detection system for either extraction kit. All substance-containing samples
gave positive results for both target assays as well as for the Sample Control assay.
For the Target 1 assay, the Cp values ranged from being 1.61 cycles earlier to 0.91
cycles later when compared to the no-substance control in the same run. For the
Target 2 assay, Cp values ranged from being 2.12 cycles earlier to 2.03 cycles later.
The Sample Control Cp value ranges were similar to those for Targets 1 and 2 (-
0.93 to 0.98 cycles). For all assays, the Fmax values were similar to the no-
substance control values (62%-265%). This data demonstrates that none of the
exogenous substances tested in this study interfere with obtaining accurate test
results with the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection Kit.
Technique Specific Substances:
The technique-specific substances did not show inhibition for the Influenza A/H5
(Asian lineage) detection system for either extraction kit. All substance-containing
samples gave positive results for both Influenza A/H5 target assays as well as for
the Sample Control assay. Target 1 Cp values ranged from being 0.26 cycles earlier
to 1.16 cycles later when compared to the no- substance control in the same run.
The ∆Cp for the Target 2 assay ranged from +0.23 cycles to -1.02 cycles. The
Sample Control Cp value ranges were similar to those for Targets 1 and 2 (-1.30 to
2.13 cycles). For all assays, the Fmax values were similar to the no-substance
control values (93%-121%). This data shows that the binding buffer and wash
buffer contained in the Platinum Path do not interfere with obtaining accurate test
results with the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection Kit, even if they
are introduced to purified samples. This is contrary to the buffers used in the IT 1-2-
3 VIBE kit that are known to cause inhibition when they introduced into purified
samples.
Human Genomic DNA:
39

--- Page 40 ---
Even at the highest concentrations of genomic DNA, no inhibition was observed. A
typical TS or NPS specimen from a healthy adult has a range of Cp values from 29-
31. Therefore, the highest level of human genomic DNA tested represents
approximately 256 to 1,024-fold higher than what would be expected from a typical
healthy adult.
For the Target 1 assay, the Cp values ranged from being 0.49 cycles earlier to 2.97
cycles later when compared to the no substance control in the same run. For the
Target 2 assay, Cp values ranged from being 2.91 cycles earlier to 0.29 cycles
earlier. The Sample Control Cp value ranges were not calculated because the
variability in the number of cells collected among different swab samples does not
provide a sufficiently consistent value for comparison. For both target assays, the
Fmax values were about half of the no-substance control values (50%-67%). While
the reduction in Fmax is not below the 50% acceptance criteria, it is a very
consistent finding and suggests that very high concentrations of human genomic
DNA may cause a reduction in fluorescence for these assays. However, given that
the test results are still unaffected when extraordinarily high concentrations of
human DNA were tested in this study, this finding is unlikely to interfere with the
accuracy of the test results for authentic specimens.
In conclusion, none of the potential interfering substances tested in this study,
including high levels of human genomic DNA, or the buffers contained in the
IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path Sample Purification kit cause inhibition of the assays
contained in the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection Kit. A
reduction in fluorescence was observed for both target assays at all
concentrations of human genomic DNA tested. However, this reduction was
not sufficient to generate false negative results. A potential delay in Cp can
occur for the Target 1 assay at DNA concentrations 1,000-fold higher than
would normally be seen in these sample types. The observed delay in Cp was
insufficient to generate a false negative result.
During the execution of the “Evaluation of Inclusivity for the JBAIDS
Influenza A/H5 Detection Kit” study, F12K tissue culture media was
discovered to interfere with amplification of the Influenza A/H5 Target 1 and
Target 2 assays. There is no known situation in which this media would be
present in throat swab or nasopharyngeal swab specimens.
i. Carry-Over Contamination:
In order to achieve accurate test results, it is important that the materials (i.e.
reagent or template) and/or signal from one test do not cross-contaminate or carry
over into adjacent tests. Carryover can result in a false positive result when material
or signal from a positive test affects the outcome of an adjacent negative test. For
the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection System, carryover could
occur during sample purification, during reagent setup, or during signal acquisition
in the JBAIDS instrument. To demonstrate that there is no significant carryover
between samples in the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection System,
an analytical carry-over contamination was carried out. Previous work with the
40

--- Page 41 ---
JBAIDS Plague (k072631) and Tularemia Detection kits (k072547) has indicated
that carryover during signal acquisition does not occur and, therefore, this mode of
carryover was not evaluated in this study. This study determined if there is
significant carryover in the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection
system when it is used as instructed by the product package insert.
To assess the potential for carryover, positive throat swab samples spiked with high
(~3.2 X 104 EID /mL) levels of inactivated Flu A/H5N1 virus (Vietnam/1203/04 x
50
PR8) and negative (unspiked) throat swab samples were purified in alternating order
with the IT 1-2-3 VIBE and IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path kits and then tested with the
JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection Kit on a JBAIDS instrument. All
16 negative samples processed with the Platinum Path Kit gave the expected
negative test results. Of the 16 negative samples processed with the IT 1-2-3 VIBE
Sample Purification Kit, one sample purified with the VIBE Purification kit initially
tested uncertain for the Target 2 assay, but was negative upon retesting. (Note:
Retesting of uncertain samples is the standard procedure described in the product
package insert instructions and users are instructed to accept the results of the retest
as the final result.) Therefore, no false positive final results were seen in this study.
The results suggested that the risk for carryover may be higher when samples are
purified with the IT 1-2-3 VIBE Purification Kit (1/16, or 6.25%, of the negative
specimens were called uncertain) than when purified with the Platinum Path
Purification kit (0/16, 0%). The differences in carryover frequency between kits
may be attributed to differences in the purification procedures. The VIBE kit
requires multiple transfers of the specimens during purification and several
centrifugation steps. For the Platinum Path kit, the specimen is contained in a single
strip tube and the purification process does not require any centrifugation steps.
However, as the purified sample corresponding to the single false-positive capillary
result (uncertain assay result) retested negative, it is possible that the contamination
occurred during reaction setup or capillary loading and not during the purification
process.
The sponsor included the recommendations for carryover prevention, such as
the necessity for routine cleaning (benches, centrifuges, etc.), and thorough
cleaning after processing a specimen with a strong positive test result in the
package insert for the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection Kit to
mitigate the risk of carry-over contamination.
j. HPAI Influenza A/H5 Inactivation Study:
To determine if the lysis steps of the IT 1-2-3 VIBE and IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path
sample purification kits can effectively inactivate highly pathogenic egg grown
influenza A/H5 viruses, personnel at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) performed inactivation experiments using two highly pathogenic avian
influenza viruses (HPAI; A/Japanese white eye/Hong Kong/1038/2006 and
A/common magpie/Hong Kong/645/2006). Innocuity of treated viruses was
determined by inoculation of embryonated chicken eggs followed by a
hemagglutination assay. Eggs were candled at 3 days post-injection to determine if
41

--- Page 42 ---
the embryo was alive or dead. Healthy, live embryos should have exhibited growth,
have visible, intact blood vessels, and respond to light. Bad eggs with dead embryos
were marked with an “x” and not harvested. The embryos were killed by quick
chilling the eggs at -20°C for 30 minutes. The allantoic fluid was then harvested
and tested for Influenza Virus by a hemagglutination assay. A negative result
indicates that there is no Influenza Virus detectable and a positive result indicates
that Influenza virus is present.
The CDC had determined that VIBE Buffer 1A and Platinum Path MB Binding
Buffer were effective at inactivating these viruses when the buffer and virus sample
were combined in a 1:1 ratio.
Based upon these data, HPAI-containing throat swab and nasopharyngeal
swab specimens purified using the IT 1-2-3 VIBE and Platinum Path sample
purification kit procedures can be expected to be non-infectious. The purified
samples can therefore be handled safely outside of BSL-3 facilities; i.e. in BSL-
2 facilities.

3. Clinical studies:
Clinical Study (specificity)
Clinical Study Design:
To demonstrate that the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection Kit has a
high degree of clinical specificity, a clinical specificity study involving testing frozen
banked NPS and TS specimens with the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage)
Detection Kit (investigational device) and the influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) assays
(H5a, H5b and RNase P) from the FDA cleared Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) Human Influenza Virus Real-time RT-PCR Detection and
Characterization Panel (rRT-PCR Flu Panel) (comparator method) was conducted.
These banked specimens had been previously tested for influenza using standard
diagnostic methods, such as viral culture and direct fluorescence antibody staining
(DFA). In addition, some of the specimens had also been tested for other respiratory
pathogens, such as adenovirus, enterovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial
virus, etc. The specimens represented prospectively collected archived (frozen)
42

--- Page 43 ---
specimens1 that were obtained from existing specimen banks at three test sites: Brooke
Army Medical Center (BAMC), San Antonio, Texas; Naval Health Research Center
(NHRC), San Diego, California; and Tripler Army Medical Center (TAMC), Honolulu,
Hawaii. The study was written and conducted in accordance with the FDA guidance
document “Guidance on Informed Consent for In Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies
Using Leftover Human Specimens that are Not Individually Identifiable”. Prior to
testing, each site received approval from their local institutional review board (IRB) and
other applicable IRBs.
Specimens were included in the study if they had sufficient volume to complete the
required testing (at least 600 µL), but without bias to previous test results. Only
specimens that did not have adequate sample volume, or were not collected for
respiratory pathogen testing, were excluded from the study. Prior to testing, specimens
that met the acceptance criteria were thawed, de-identified, aliquoted for testing, and
assigned a specific study number. Specimens with sufficient volume for testing with the
JBAIDS system were tested using both the VIBE and Platinum Path purification
methods. If there was insufficient volume, then only one JBAIDS purification method
was selected. All specimens were tested using the H5a, H5b and RNase P assays of the
CDC rRT-PCR Flu Panel as a comparator to the JBAIDS Flu A/H5 test.
Specimens were purified using either or both of the IT 1-2-3 VIBE and IT 1-2-3
Platinum Path Sample Purification kits, depending on the available specimen volume.
For this study, a Positive Extraction Control (PEC) and Negative Extraction Control
(NEC) were included with each batch of purified specimens. The PEC was composed
of pooled TS specimens spiked with inactive influenza A/H5 virus at approximately 2X
LoD. The NEC consisted of nuclease-free water. Each purified specimen (including
the PEC and NEC), was used to reconstitute freeze-dried reagent vials for the Target 1
assay, the Target 2 assay, and the Sample Control assay. For each JBAIDS run, a
freeze-dried positive control (PC) vial and a negative control (NC) vial for the Target 1
and Target 2 assays (total of 4 vials) were reconstituted with water and reconstitution
buffer. The contents of each rehydrated reagent vial was transferred into two glass
capillaries and loaded in the JBAIDS carousel in a predefined loading pattern. The
loaded carousel was place on the JBAIDS instrument which automatically applied the
correct cycling and data analysis settings. Once the run was completed, the JBAIDS
software automatically interpreted the result of each PCR reaction as well as the results
of all associated controls and provided a final result for the Target 1 and Target 2 assays.
As with all JBAIDS assays, the software interprets each amplification curve and assigns
a result of positive, negative, or in rare cases (about 0.2%), uncertain. After each curve
is interpreted, the result of the duplicate capillaries and the controls are combined to
give a final result for each of the target assays. For the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian
lineage) Detection Kit, possible results are positive, negative, uncertain, and invalid or
sample control failure. Specimens with uncertain, invalid, or sample control failure test
results were retested according to the product package insert and the final test result was
1
Prospectively collected archived specimens are specimens collected sequentially from all patients meeting study inclusion
criteria and representing assay intended use population (i.e., not pre-selected specimens with known results) coming in to a
clinical testing facility between two pre-determined dates (e.g., from the beginning to the end of one flu season), so there is
no bias and prevalence is preserved. These specimens were appropriately stored (e.g., frozen at -70oC).
43

--- Page 44 ---
used in the analysis of the data. While the JBAIDS software (Detector) provides a test
result for each Target assay, the user is required to give a final interpretation. Possible
final interpretations are positive (when both targets are positive), negative (when both
targets are negative) and inconclusive (when the results of the two target assays do not
match or are not valid). Samples with inconclusive test results were retested and the
result of the retest was accepted as the final result.
In addition, a PEC and a NEC were purified with each batch of samples in this study.
The PEC was expected to provide positive results for both target assays and the sample
control assay. The NEC was expected to give a result of sample control failure for both
target assays. When these results were not obtained, the failed PEC or NEC was
retested. If the retest provided the expected result, then the control was considered
successful and the associated samples were considered to have valid results. If the retest
failed, then the results for the samples extracted with that PEC or NEC were considered
invalid. Inclusion of a PEC and a NEC with each batch of extracted samples is not a
standard recommendation in the product package insert. They were included as
additional external controls only during this clinical evaluation per FDA
recommendation.
The specimens collected at the three test sites reflect different patient populations,
influenza seasons, specimen types and methods used to perform the previous testing.
The specimen bank at BAMC was collected during the 2008/2009 respiratory season
and before the 2009 H1N1 Influenza was identified. These specimens were tested using
standard viral culture with direct fluorescence antigen (DFA) testing and had been
frozen for validation studies of a new testing platform. The age range is large (<1 year
to 80 years of age), but the average age (17) reflects a large proportion of pediatric
specimens. This is consistent with the testing patterns for a community based hospital.
Specimens from TAMC are similar to those collected at BAMC, except that these
specimens were collected when 2009 H1N1 Influenza was prevalent (June 2009 to Dec.
2009). As with BAMC, the range of ages is large (<1 to 84 years of age), and the
average age (22) reflect a larger proportion of pediatric specimens. These specimens
were tested with a variety of different methods, including rapid antigen tests, viral
culture with DFA, PCR (FDA cleared or authorized, or LDT validated at NHRC), and
heme adsorption followed by immunofluorescence assay. The specimens from NHRC
appear to be significantly different than the specimens collected at BAMC and TAMC
(BAMC and TAMC are community based hospitals that serve military personnel and
their dependents). NHRC primarily received specimens from active military personnel,
and particularly from recruit camps. This is evidenced by the fact that the patient
population is composed primarily of young males (age range of 17-41 with an average
of 21 years, 88% male). These specimens also differ from the BAMC and TAMC
specimens in that they were collected during the 2006/2007 respiratory disease season.

Clinical Study Results:
NPS Specimens
A total of 468 NPS specimens were tested in this clinical study. Three hundred and
sixty one (361) were purified with the IT 1-2-3TM VIBE Sample Purification Kit and
327 were purified using the IT 1-2-3TM Platinum Path Purification Kit. Of the 361 NPS
specimens purified with the IT 1-2-3TM VIBE Sample Purification Kit, 314 out of 361
(87.0%) provided valid test result with both the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage)
Detection Kit and CDC rRT-PCR Flu Panel Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) assays. All
314 specimens gave negative results with both the investigational device and the
comparator device. Valid JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection Kit and
CDC rRT-PCR Flu Panel Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) assays results were obtained
for 299 out of a total of 327 (91.4%) of the NPS specimens purified with IT 1-2-3TM
Platinum Path Purification Kit. All 299 gave negative results with both devices.

* Due to the lack of available specimens from individuals infected with influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage), it
was not possible to establish the positive percent agreement of the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage)
Detection Kit to the CDC rRT-PCR Flu Panel Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) assays in this study.
Of the specimens processed with the VIBE purification kit, 47 were excluded from this
statistical analysis due to lack of a valid result for the JBAIDS testing (n=23) and/or the
CDC rRT-PCR Flu Panel testing (n=32) with 8 specimens having invalid results for
both tests. JBAIDS failures occurred at BAMC (n=9) and TAMC (n=14) and included
19 specimens associated with missing or failed PEC and/or NECs and 4 specimens that
had a sample control failure results. All 32 CDC rRT- PCR Flu Panel failures occurred
with specimens from BAMC that were shipped to NHRC for testing. These included 4
that were not tested, 10 with sample control failures and 18 for which the H5a no-
template control was positive. All 10 sample control failures occurred with specimens
that had been inadvertently shipped to NHRC at ambient temperature instead of at 2-
8°C. Failure of the H5a no-template control was related to PCR amplicon contamination
at NHRC.
Of the 327 NPS specimens purified with the Platinum Path purification kit, 28 lacked a
valid result for the investigational device testing (n=8) and/or the comparator method
testing (n=21), with 1 specimen having invalid results for both tests. One (1) JBAIDS
failure occurred at BAMC and 7 occurred at TAMC. Seven (7) of the failures were
associated with a missing or invalid NEC or PEC and 1 was a sample control failure.
As with the VIBE-purified NPS specimens, all CDC rRT-PCR Flu Panel failures
occurred with specimens shipped from BAMC to NHRC for testing. This included 17
sample control failures and 7 for which the H5a no-template control was positive. These
failures are associated with improper shipping of the specimens and contamination at
NHRC.
TS Specimens
A total of 518 TS specimens were tested in this clinical study. Three hundred and three
(303) were purified with the IT 1-2-3TM VIBE Sample Purification Kit and 333 were
purified using IT 1-2-3TM Platinum Path Purification Kit. Of the 303 TS specimens
purified with the IT 1-2-3TM VIBE Sample Purification Kit, 298 (98.3%) provided valid
test results with both the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection Kit and
CDC rRT-PCR Flu Panel Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) assays. All 298 (100%)
specimens gave negative results with both the investigational device and the
comparator device. Valid JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection Kit and
CDC rRT-PCR Flu Panel Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) assays were obtained for 283
out of 333 (85.0%) of the TS specimens purified with the IT 1-2-3TM Platinum Path
Purification Kit. All 283 gave negative results with both devices.

Of the 303 TS specimens processed with the VIBE purification kit, only 5 were
excluded from the statistical analysis due to lack of a valid result for the JBAIDS
testing (n=2) and/or the CDC rRT- PCR Flu Panel (n=3). All invalid results occurred at
NHRC (n=9). The JBAIDS failures included 1 specimen associated with failed PEC
and NEC tests and 1 specimen had a sample control failure result. Three (3) specimens
were never tested with the CDC rRT-PCR Flu Panel and therefore had to be excluded
from the analysis.
Of the 333 TS specimens purified with the Platinum Path purification kit, 50 lacked a
valid result for the JBAIDS testing (n=37) and/or the CDC rRT-PCR Flu Panel testing
(n=14), with 1 specimen having invalid results for both tests. Ten (10) JBAIDS failures
occurred at NHRC and 27 occurred at TAMC. Thirty (30) of the failures were
associated with an invalid NEC or PEC, 5 were sample control failures, 1 was invalid
due to a failed PC for the Target 2 assay, and 1 gave an inconclusive result. For the
CDC rRT-PCR Flu Panel testing, 9 specimens gave inconclusive results and 5 were not
tested. The 9 specimens with inconclusive test results all occurred at NHRC and all had
a positive result with the Target 1 (or H5a) assay and a negative result with the Target 2
(H5b assay). These test results were caused by amplicon contamination at NHRC.
The sponsor included the recommendations for carryover and amplicon
contamination prevention, such as the necessity for routine cleaning (benches,
centrifuges, etc.), thorough cleaning after processing a specimen with a strong
positive test result, and decontamination immediately after capillary breakage in
the package insert for the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection Kit to
mitigate the risk of carry-over and amplicon contamination.
Results of Controls
Out of a total of 519 runs during the clinical specificity study, 511 (98.5%) runs had
successful PCs for both target assays initially, and 512 (98.7%) runs had successful PCs
for both target assays initially. The mean PC Cp value for Target 1 was 33.14 ±0.63
(1.90 % CV) and for Target 2 was 33.85 ± 1.21 (3.57% CV).

Conclusion
Three hundred fourteen (314) NPS specimens purified using the IT 1-2-3 VIBE Sample
Purification Kit and 299 NPS specimens purified using the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path
Purification kit had valid negative result for both the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian
lineage) Detection Kit and the CDC rRT Flu Panel Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage)
assays. Similarly, 298 VIBE purified and 283 Platinum Path purified TS specimens had
valid negative results with both tests. These results demonstrated that the negative
percent agreement for NPS and TS specimens purified with the IT 1-2-3 VIBE or
Platinum Path Purification Kits and tested with the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian
lineage) Detection Kit is at least 99% with 95% confidence.

Study Testing Surrogate Clinical Samples
Study Design:
True clinical specimens containing influenza A/H5N1 are not readily available for
testing. Therefore, a study was carried out at the Midwest Research Institute (MRI)
testing a panel of surrogate clinical samples consisting of 8 strains of Influenza A/H5N1
(the same strains tested in the Analytical Inclusivity Study, representing sub-clades 1.0,
2.1, 2.2, and 2.3) and 6 strains of seasonal influenza spiked into TS or NPS specimens
collected in viral transport medium (VTM). The complete panel, for both TS and NPS
specimens, consisted of the following: Influenza A/H5N1 viruses at predetermined
LoD, 5X LoD, 10X LoD, and 100X LoD (LoD for this panel was set at 500 TCID /mL
50
based on comparison and correlation of EID /mL to TCID /mL data generated from
50 50
the Analytical Inclusivity Study testing surrogate samples); seasonal influenza viruses
at LoD and 100X LoD; and 6 specimens per sample type (NPS and TS) that were not
spiked with any virus.
Overall, a total of 32 Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) positive NPS samples, 12 seasonal
Influenza A or Influenza B positive NPS samples, and 6 Influenza virus negative NPS
samples were included in the surrogate clinical NPS specimen panel, and a total of 32
Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) positive TS samples, 12 seasonal Influenza A or
Influenza B positive TS samples, and 6 Influenza virus negative TS samples were
included in the surrogate clinical TS specimen panel:

Viral RNA mini kit followed by testing with the appropriate FDA cleared CDC assays
(FluA/H5a, FluA/H5b and the Sample Control). The results obtained were compared to
previous lot quantification and determined to be acceptable.
An investigation revealed that the F12K medium was causing inhibition of the JBAIDS
system. Since this contrived sample matrix was not representative of the intended
sample matrix, it was determined that TS in VTM would be used as the sample matrix
for this study. Using the same qualified viral stocks, MRI prepared the surrogate
clinical sample panels described above. The specimens were randomized and blinded to
the operators. Each specimen was purified with the IT 1-2-3TM VIBE (VIBE) and IT 1-
2-3TM Platinum Path (PP) Sample Purification Kits, and then tested with the JBAIDS
Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection Kit at MRI.
Study Results:
NPS Surrogate Specimens
All Sample Control assays gave the expected positive results.
96.9% (31/32) of NPS samples spiked with influenza A/H5N1 virus were positive when
purified using the IT 1-2-3TM Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit and tested with the
JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection Kit. (Note: Samples were
considered positive only if both target assays were positive). One NPS sample spiked at
5X LoD gave a negative result with both the Target 1 and Target 2 assays. However
this same sample gave a positive result when purified with the IT 1-2-3TM VIBE Sample
Purification Kit.
100% (32/32) of NPS samples spiked with influenza A/H5N1 virus were positive when
purified using the IT 1-2-3TM VIBE Sample Purification Kit and tested with the
JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection Kit. (Note: Samples were
considered positive only if both target assays were positive).
100% (12/12) of NPS samples spiked with seasonal influenza A virus or influenza B
virus were negative when purified using either the IT 1-2-3TM Platinum Path Sample
Purification Kit or the IT 1-2-3TM VIBE Sample Purification Kit, and tested with the
JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection Kit.
100% (6/6) of unspiked NPS samples were negative when purified using either the IT
1-2-3TM Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit or the IT 1-2-3TM VIBE Sample
Purification Kit, and tested with the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection
Kit.
Overall, across purification kits, for individual spike levels, positive results obtained
were: 100% (16/16) at LoD, 10X LoD and 100X LoD; and 93.8% (15/16) at 5XLoD.
TS Surrogate Specimens
All Sample Control assays gave the expected positive results.

JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection Kit.
100% (6/6) of unspiked NPS samples were negative when purified using either the IT
1-2-3TM Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit or the IT 1-2-3TM VIBE Sample
Purification Kit, and tested with the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection
Kit.
Overall, across purification kits, for individual spike levels, positive results obtained
were: 93.8% (15/16) at LoD; and 100% (16/16) at 5X LoD, 10X LoD and 100X LoD.
Results of Controls
All PC and NC reactions were successful in all runs performed for this study. The mean
PC Cp value for Target 1 was 34.38 ± 0.74 (2.15 % CV) and for Target 2 was 35.58 ±
0.92 (2.59% CV).
A Sample Control assay (human RNase P assay) was tested with each purified sample
to detect inhibition or poor sample extraction during the surrogate sample testing at the
Midwest Research Institute (MRI) to estimate clinical sensitivity. All samples produced
positive Sample Control results:

These data indicated that the performance of the JBAIDS system is similar for TS and
NPS specimens processed using either the IT 1-2-3TM Platinum Path Sample
Purification Kit or the IT 1-2-3TM VIBE Sample Purification Kit.
Overall, the JBIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Detection System successfully
excluded 100% (72/72) of all Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) negative samples,
including 48 seasonal influenza spiked samples (48/48) and 24 unspiked samples
(24/24), and detected 98.4% (126/128) of all avian influenza A/H5N1 spiked samples.
One sample at 1X LoD was inconclusive after IT 1-2-3TM VIBE purification and a
second sample at 5X LoD was negative after IT 1-2-3TM Platinum Path purification:

Retesting of purified samples was minimal with only 3 out of 200 samples requiring
retest. Of these, one was a seasonal influenza spiked sample which tested uncertain for
target 2 and retesting of this sample was negative. Avian influenza A/H5N1 samples
which required re-testing included one sample that remained uncertain and would have
required re-purification, however, due to the nature of this study, sufficient sample was
not available. A second avian influenza A/H5N1 sample initially tested uncertain for
target 2 after IT 1-2-3TM Platinum path purification but retested positive.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The incidence of human infections with influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) is rare. From
1996 through 2009, 467 cases have been reported in 5 countries according to WHO,
Avian Influenza Update. http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/en/2.
Currently, influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) virus has not been detected in poultry or
humans in the United States. False-positive results are more likely to occur when
disease prevalence in the community is low. Testing with the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5
(Asian lineage) Detection Kit should not be performed unless the patient meets the most
current U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) clinical and
epidemiologic criteria for testing suspect A/H5 specimens.
N. Instrument Name:
Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) Instrument.
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The JBAIDS Instrument is used to perform real time reverse transcription, PCR
amplification and detection of nucleic acid. Three other nucleic acid amplification tests
that use the JBAIDS Instrument have received 510(k) clearance: JBAIDS Anthrax
Detection System (k051713), JBAIDS Plague Detection System (k072631) and
JBAIDS Tularemia Detection System (k072547). The JBAIDS Instrument is a
ruggedized, portable real-time PCR instrument designed to withstand the conditions of
transport and use likely to be encountered in a military field laboratory. The instrument
is composed of an air thermocycler that amplifies specific DNA sequences using PCR
and a fluorimeter that measures fluorescence signals associated with production of PCR

product (amplicon) during the course of the reaction. For thermocycling, samples
contained in glass capillaries are placed in the sample chamber where they are heated
and cooled by the JBAIDS instrument.
The JBAIDS Software is preloaded on a ruggedized laptop computer. The software
controls the instrument’s thermal cycling functions, acquires the fluorescence data from
the instrument, and displays the fluorescence data for the user during the run. When the
run is finished, the software’s Detector module analyzes the data and displays test
results. The instrument and software have the ability to perform either diagnostic (IVD)
or surveillance (environmental) testing.
The IVD software includes the following diagnostic components:
• A traceable database that limits the data that the user can change in a test run and
that requires the user to enter change notes for any changes that are allowed.
• A Diagnostic Wizard that takes the user through the process of setting up the
JBAIDS run in compliance with the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage)
Detection Kit package insert.
IVD testing is always performed using the Diagnostic Wizard and the traceable
database. The Wizard requires each run to contain a Positive Control and a Negative
Control for each target included in the run, and a Sample Control for each sample. The
Wizard also requires that duplicate capillaries be included for each Unknown, Positive
Control, Negative Control, and Sample Control. The Detector module that
automatically analyzes the fluorescence amplification curves and that displays the final
test results to the user.
The JBAIDS software was specifically modified to support the use of Influenza A/H5
(Asian lineage) assay.

The following controls are included in the JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage)
Detection Kit:
Negative Control (NC)
58

--- Page 59 ---
The NC is used to detect contamination from target-specific amplified product,
synthetic RNA (as found in the PC vials), or organism. Each JBAIDS run requires one
NC (resulting in two capillaries) for the Target 1 and one for the Target 2 assays (total
of 4 capillaries). For each target assay, both of the NC capillaries must be negative, or
the JBAIDS software will assign invalid results for that target assay to all of the
samples in that run, and the run must be repeated. Frequent or repeated failures of NCs
may indicate significant contamination of the work area.
Positive Control (PC)
The PC serves as an amplification and detection control. Each JBAIDS run requires one
PC (resulting in two capillaries) for the Target 1 assay and one for the Target 2 assay
(total of 4 capillaries). For each target assay, both of the PC capillaries must be positive
and have Cp results that are earlier than the assay‘s specific cutoff value. If either
capillary fails, the JBAIDS software will assign invalid results for that target assay to
all of the associated samples, and the run must be repeated. Failure of the PCs may
indicate errors in sample setup, degradation of the reagents, or a malfunction of the
JBAIDS instrument. If the SC capillaries in the same test run are positive, then the
failure is most likely caused by an isolated error with the setup of the PC. If the Sample
Control (SC) capillaries are also negative, possible causes for failure are 1) a systematic
error in sample setup, 2) degradation of the reagents, or 3) a malfunction of the JBAIDS
instrument.
Sample Control (SC)
The Sample Control assay detects the human RNase P gene. This assay is designed to
guard against false negative results caused by an improperly collected specimen,
ineffective purification of nucleic acids and or inhibition of the PCR reaction. A
properly collected throat or NPS specimen contains human cells from which the RNase
P target is recovered during sample purification. Following purification, each sample is
then tested with the two Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) target assays, as well as, the
Sample Control assay. If extraction and amplification were successful, then the Sample
Control Assay will give the expected positive test result for both capillaries. The
Sample Control is considered to be successful only if both Sample Control capillaries
are positive. The JBAIDS software automatically assigned a result of sample control
failure when 1) the Sample Control is unsuccessful and 2) the target assay is negative
(or uncertain). If the target assay is positive, then the sample is positive regardless of
the result of the Sample Control assay. Because the results of the two Influenza A/H5
target assays are interpreted separately, it is possible to have a sample control failure for
one of the target assays and a positive result of the other target.
