K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI document EP5-A2, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative
Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline
L. Test Principle:
The ADVIA® Chemistry Carbon Dioxide Liquid (CO2_L) Assay is based on
enzymatic reactions. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) catalyzes the first
reaction which generates oxaloacetate. In the presence of MDH, the NADH analog is
oxidized by oxaloacetate to NAD+ analog. The oxidation of NADH analog is
measured by the decreased absorbance at 410/478 nm, which is proportional to the
amount of CO in the sample.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision estimates were computed according to CLSI document EP5-A2,
Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods;
Approved Guideline. The sponsor performed a precision study that is modified
from the recommendations in CLSI Guideline EP5-A2; ten (10) days of
precision studies were performed.
Within run and total imprecision were evaluated by testing three control sera
and one normal serum sample spiked with sodium bicarbonate. Each sample
was assayed 2 times per run, 2 runs per day for 10 days, totaling 40 replicates
per system. The study was run using one reagent lot on one ADVIA 1650
system.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A high pool was prepared using a human serum pool spiked with sodium
bicarbonate. A low pool was prepared using normal saline with human serum
albumin at 5 g/dL. The high and low pools were used to prepare a series of
nine (9) samples with evenly spaced concentrations of CO2 and testing was
performed on the ADVIA 1650 analyzer. Linearity was evaluated by
calculating a linear regression comparing observed recovery versus expected
values using the 6 data points between 7.2 – 43.5 mmol/L. Expected values
were derived from the line of best fit through all data. The deviation and
percent difference from this line is then calculated for all 9 diluted samples
prepared from high and low samples. The Deviation was calculated as the
difference of the Expected Value and the Mean Observed Result of 2
replicates.

Linear regression analysis of the 7 data points between 7.3 – 43.6 mmol/L:
y = 0.9517 x + 0.9219
95% Confidence interval for slope = 0.9183 to - 0.9851
95% Confidence interval for intercept = -0.0227 to - 1.8664
r = 0.9997
The claimed measuring range of the CO assay is 10 to 40 mmol/L.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The ADVIA CO2_L method is traceable to a commercially available method
that is calibrated with NIST sodium carbonate, via patient sample correlation.
ADVIA Chemistry Carbon Dioxide Liquid assay is calibrated using ADVIA
CO2 Calibrator/Diluent cleared previously under k033643.
d. Detection limit:
The estimations of the Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD)
were performed by running 40 replicates of 0.9% Saline (Blank) and 40
replicates of a low sample (Serum Control 1, which has a target concentration
of 11.5 to 17.5 mmol/L). One lot of reagent was used. Testing was conducted
over a period of 10 days, 2 runs per day using one ADVIA 1650 analyzer and
one reagent lot.
LoB was calculated to be 0.06 mmol/L and LoD was calculated to be 1.98
mmol/L.
10.0 mmol/L was set conservatively as the Lower Limit of the assay range for
ADVIA Chemistry Carbon Dioxide Liquid method.
e. Analytical specificity:
Two serum pools containing known amounts of CO (approximately 24
2
mmol/L and 30-35 mmol/L) were spiked with hemolysate prepared with lysed
fresh human erythrocytes (to evaluate hemoglobin), Intralipid, free bilirubin
and conjugated ditaurobilirubin. Multiple levels of interfering substances
(five equally diluted levels) were tested for each interferent. The levels for
testing were prepared by diluting the pool with the highest concentration of
interferent with the same pool without interferent (control). Five equally-
spaced dilutions were tested for each interferent.
The method is considered to have no significant interference if the difference
between control (no interferent) and observed carbon dioxide concentration at
a certain level of interferent is less than 10%.
There was no interference seen with the assay at both levels of CO2 when
testing hemoglobin (500 mg/dL), Intralipid (500 mg/dL), free bilirubin (25
mg/dL) and conjugated ditaurobilirubin (25 mg/dL). Interference (10.3%)
was seen when testing a sample with CO levels of 22 mmol/L spiked with 25
2
mg/dL of free (unconjugated) bilirubin. This interference is noted in the
package insert.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed with a total of 62 serum samples.
Some samples were spiked or diluted in order to cover the hard-to-find sample
range. Testing was done using the candidate device on the ADVIA 1650
analyzer and the predicate device on the Hitachi 717 analyzer. Serum samples
tested ranged from 12.8 to 40.0 mmol/L. Linear regression and Deming
regression correlations were analyzed and the results of the study are
summarized in the table below:
Regression Regression S , r N Range,
yx
Type Equation mmol/L mmol/L
Linear Y = 1.07x + 0.75 0.52 0.995 62 12.8 - 40.0
Deming Y = 1.07x + 0.72 0.023 0.995 62 12.8 – 40.0
b. Matrix comparison:
Serum and plasma equivalency studies were performed to characterize the
correlation between serum and lithium heparin plasma samples. The results
demonstrate good agreement between serum and plasma samples.
Paired sample tubes (serum and lithium heparin plasma) from the same donor
were drawn from 59 volunteers. Serum or plasma was obtained by standard
lab procedures. The samples were analyzed with the ADVIA Chemistry
Carbon Dioxide Liquid method on one ADVIA 1650 analyzer using one lot of
reagent. Samples were assayed in singleton. Results were analyzed using
linear regression.
