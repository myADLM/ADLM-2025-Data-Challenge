I. Device Description:
The ST AIA-PACK HbA1c reagents, pretreatment solution, calibrators, and
controls are in vitro diagnostic devices for use exclusively on Tosoh AIA System
analyzers. The ST AIA-PACK HbA1c contains magnetic beads in test cups that
are coated with polyclonal sheep antibody conjugated to bovine alkaline
phosphatase. The ST AIA-PACK HbA1c CALIBRATOR SET is a set of 6
calibrators traceable to IFCC reference material. The calibrators are in ready-to-
use form.
The AIA-PACK HbA1c CONTROL SET contains two levels of HbA1c. The
control materials are lyophilized materials and should be reconstituted with the
pretreatment solution. Both the calibrators and controls are derived from human
blood. Both devices have been tested by FDA-cleared methods and found
negative for the presence of HBsAg and antibody to HIV-1 and HCV. Because no
test method can offer complete assurance that products derived from human blood
will not transmit infectious agents, it is recommended that this product be handled

L. Test Principle:
HbA1c present in the pretreated test sample is captured on the magnetic beads
along with hemoglobin and bound with enzyme-labeled sheep anti-HbA1c
polyclonal antibody in the AIA-PACK test cup. The beads are washed to remove
the unbound materials and are then incubated with a fluorogenic substrate, 4-
methylumbelliferyl phosphate (4MUP). The amount of enzyme-labeled
polyclonal antibody that binds to the beads is directly proportional to the HbA1c
concentration in the test sample. HbA1c percent concentrations are calculated
from a curve generated by using the ST AIA-PACK HbA1c Calibrator Set.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision for the ST AIA-PACK HbA1c assay was evaluated using three
AIA-1800 analyzers and three lots of reagents according to CLSI EP5-A2.
One calibration curve was used throughout the precision study. Three levels of
pooled EDTA whole blood specimens were run in duplicate twice daily for 20
days (N=80). Specimens were aliquoted and stored at -30°C and thawed
once/day. Results are below:

b. Linearity
A recovery study for linearity was performed according to CLSI Protocol
EP6-A. 11 specimens with concentrations from 2.2%-15.3% HbA1c were
assayed in triplicate using one reagent lot on one AIA 1800. The percent
recoveries between the observed values and the expected values were 97.8-
104.9%. The regression was: y = 1.024x – 0.104, r = 0.999.
The results of the study support the claimed reportable range of 3.0%-14.0%
HbA1c.
High dose hook effect was evaluated on one AIA-1800 by analyzing the
fluorescence rate of a control solution containing 25% HbA1c in triplicate
with one lot of reagents. The fluorescence rate is greater than that of the
highest calibrator (approximately 16% HbA1c). No hook effect was observed
up to 25% HbA1c.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The ST AIA-PACK HbA1c assay has met the requirements of the National
Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP). The NGSP certification
requires annual renewal. The current list of NGSP certified methods is
available on the NGSP website at: http://www.ngsp.org/prog/index.html
ST AIA-PACK, HbA1c Calibrators contain 6 levels and are traceable to IFCC
reference materials.
Assignment of control values:
AIA-PACK HbA1c Control Set contains Level 1 (approximately 5.5%) and
Level 2 (approximately 9.5%). A master pool is diluted to pre-determined
HbA1c concentrations for Level 1 and Level 2 controls. Values are assigned
by analyzing the two diluted pools using multiple reagent lots and multiple
analyzers. A grand mean, SD and CV are calculated from the data. The
control ranges are set at ± 10% of the grand mean.

Stability, closed-vial:
Real time closed vial shelf life stability study for the AIA-PACK HbA1c
assay reagents (ST AIA-PACK HbA1c, ST AIA-PACK, HbA1c Calibrator
Set, AIA-PACK HbA1c Control Set, ST AIA-PACK HbA1c Pretreatment
Solution) was conducted using a single AIA-1800 analyzer and four lots of
each reagent (four reagent sets). All reagents were stored at 8-12° C for up to
13 months. Stability was determined to be 12 months at 8-12° C.
Stability, open vial:
Real time open vial stability testing was performed for the AIA-PACK HbA1c
Control Set, Levels 1 and 2 at 10° C for 8 days and 30° C for 7 days.
Recoveries of five replicates for each control were evaluated at various time
points using one AIA-1800 and one reagent lot. Open vial control stability is
7 days at 10°C and 6 hours at 30°C.
Real time open vial recovery studies for stability were performed for the ST
AIA-PACK HbA1c Calibrator Set at 10° C for 2 days and 30° C for 7 hours.
Calibrators are stable for 1 day at 10° C and 6 hours at 30° C. Pretreated
calibrators were also evaluated at the same temperature ranges. Pretreated
calibrators are stable for up to 2 hours prior to analysis at 30° C and up to 1
day at 10° C.
Real time ST AIA-PACK HbA1c Pretreatment Solution stability was
evaluated daily for 91 days stored at 2-8° C. The Pretreatment Solution met
the sponsor’s stability criteria. Stability was determined to be 90 days at 2-8°
C.
The in-use open test cup real time stability study was conducted by opening
the ST AIA-PACK and storing the individual test cups at 10° C for 8 days and
30° C for 2 days. At each stability time point, five replicates of three unaltered
EDTA whole blood specimens and AIA-PACK HbA1c CONTROL Level 1
and Level 2 were assayed for % HbA1c using a single set of reagents on the
AIA-1800. The AIA-1800 was calibrated on Day 0. Recovery data supports
the sponsor’s claims that reagent packs are stable for 1 day at 30° C and 7
days at 10° C.
Recovery studies were performed for sample stability before pretreatment
using 3 EDTA whole blood samples stored at 30°C for 2 days, 10°C for 8
days and -20°C for 197 days. Samples are stable before pretreatment for 1
day at 30°C, 7 days at 10°C and 60 days at -20°C.

Endogenous and Exogenous Interference:
Interference was evaluated on the AIA-1800 using three whole blood samples
with HbA1c concentrations of approximately 5.3%, 8.0%, and 13%. Each
sample was spiked with various concentrations of interfering substance and
evaluated against a sample with no interferences added. Samples were run in
triplicate. Interference was defined as >10% difference in recovery between
the spiked sample and the non-spiked sample. Results were as follows:
Interfering Substance Conclusion
Bilirubin, conjugated No interference up to 18 mg/dL conjugated bilirubin
Bilirubin, free No interference up to 16 mg/dL free bilirubin
Lipemia No interference up to 1666 mg/dL triglyceride
Albumin No interference up to 50 mg/mL albumin
Ascorbic Acid No interference up to 20 mg/mL ascorbic acid
Trisodium citrate No interference up to 20 mg/mL trisodium citrate
EDTA – 2K No interference up to 10 mg/mL EDTA-K2
Rheumatoid Factor No interference up to 550 IU/mL Rh Factor
Hemoglobin Variant Interference:
Cross-reactivity to Hemoglobin Variant F was studied on ST AIA-PACK
HbA1c. Specimens at varying HbF levels were prepared by mixing high
(14.7% HbF) and low (0.3% HbF) l EDTA whole blood specimens to prepare
a eleven samples containing 0.3 – 14.7% HbF as measured on the predicate,
the Tosoh Automated Glycohemoglobin Analyzer HLC-723G7 (G-7) Variant
Analysis Mode. Samples were tested in singlicate on the AIA-1800 and the
G-7. Recoveries were calculated against the predicate. Recoveries ranged
from (96%-104%). Interference was defined as % HbA1c recovery >10%.
Up to 10% Hemoglobin F does not significantly interfere with the assay result
of ST AIA-HbA1c. More than 10% Hemoglobin F does interfere with the ST
AIA-HbA1c result.
EDTA whole blood specimens containing hemoglobin variants C, D, E and S
were obtained from an outside NGSP certified laboratory. All specimens
were analyzed for %HbA1c using the ST AIA-PACK HbA1c assay on the
AIA-1800 analyzer. Samples were tested in singlicate for all of the Hb
variants. The % HbA1c value from the NGSP laboratory’s boronate affinity
method was used as the reference and the % recovery was calculated for each
specimen. Recovery of the Variant Hemoglobin C, D, S and E specimens
should be within 100 ± 10 %. All interference study results are included in
the labeling.
The results are summarized below.
