L. Test Principle:
The LOCI CA 125 II™ method is a homogeneous, sandwich chemiluminescent
immunoassay based on LOCI® technology. The LOCI® reagents include two
synthetic bead reagents and a biotinylated anti-CA 125 monoclonal antibody (M11)
fragment. The first bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with an anti-CA 125
monoclonal antibody (OC 125) and contains a chemiluminescent dye. The use of the
M11 antibody in combination with OC 125 defines this method as a second
generation CA 125 assay. The second bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with
streptavidin and contains a photosensitizer dye. Sample is incubated with
biotinylated antibody and Chemibeads to form bead-CA 125-biotinylated antibody
sandwiches. Sensibeads are added and bind to the biotin to form bead-pair
immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at 680 nm generates singlet oxygen
from Sensibeads which diffuses into the Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent
reaction. The resulting signal is measured at 612 nm and is a direct function of the

CA 125 concentration in the sample when measured against a calibration curve.
The Dimension Vista® LOCI 6 Calibrator (KC604) is a multi-analyte frozen liquid
product packaged as two vials for each of five levels. The matrix is 6% bovine
albumin with buffer and preservatives. The calibrator level A is zero, while levels B
to E contain purified CA 125 antigen. Measuring these values on the Dimension
Vista® allows for a calibration curve to be established. Patients CA 125
measurements are then compared to the calibration curve to determine serum or
plasma CA 125 concentrations.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
i) Assay
Precision testing for the LOCI CA 125 method was performed over twenty
days according to CLSI/NCCLS EP5-A2. Data from 2 Flex® lots, 2
calibrator lots and 2 Dimension Vista® 1500 model instruments are
included. The test samples consisted of three levels of Bio-Rad Liquichek
Tumor Marker control, three serum pools and one to two plasma pools
depending on the study. Two of the serum samples and one of the plasma
pools (Lithium heparin) were spiked with CA 125 antigen. On each day
of testing, each sample was run in duplicate, in two separate runs (N=80).
The duplicates were run with two separate sample cups. One site used
instrument 238, reagent lot09268AE, calibrator lot 9ED083, and QC lot
19830. The second site used instrument 190, reagent lot 09196AD,
calibrator lot 9DD099, and QC lot 19830.
The range of samples tested encompassed the analytical measuring range.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the data consistent
with the recommendations of EP5-A2. This experiment allowed a
determination of within-run precision (repeatability), within-day, between
days, between runs (within lab) precision for each site and a determination
of between site precision.

Data was collected for twenty days, one run per day, two replicates per run, on three separate instruments,
using three different calibrator lots on each instrument.
The data was merged to form one data set for analysis and a variance component analysis using the REML
method was performed.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
i) The linear range was determined according to CLSI EP06-A. Based on
the results of this testing and that from the Limit of Detection Study, the
analytical measuring range was established in three matrices: serum,
Lithium Heparin plasma, and EDTA plasma.
a. Serum
A study covering the whole assay range was performed using two
natural serum samples. One sample with a low CA 125 concentration
(3.3 U/mL) and one with a high CA 125 concentration (1376.2 U/mL),
were mixed in varying proportions distributed over the measurement
range. Each dilution was tested five times. Dimension Vista Flex assay
data correlated with expected sample concentration according to the
weighted linear regression formula (y=0.99x + 0.07, R2=1.00).
A low-end linearity studies were performed by diluting mid-level
patient samples with water in varying proportions covering the range
from 1-280.8 U/mL. Dimension Vista Flex assay data correlated with
expected sample concentration according to the linear regression formula
(y=0.9494x + 1.5508, R2=0.9991).
b. Lithium Heparin Plasma
A study covering the whole assay range was performed using two
natural serum samples. One sample with a low CA 125 concentration
(3.2 U/mL) and one with a high CA 125 concentration (1578.5 U/mL),
were mixed in varying proportions distributed over the measurement
range. Samples were measured in triplicate. When data was limited to
plus or minus 30% of the measuring range, as per CLSI guidelines,
Dimension Vista Flex assay data correlated with expected sample
7

concentration according to the weighted linear regression formula
(y=1.00x – 0.1, R2=1.00).
c. EDTA Plasma
A study covering the whole assay range was performed using two
natural EDTA plasma pools. One sample with a low CA 125
concentration (7.1 U/mL) and a separate sample spike with CA 125
antigen to a high concentration (1562.8 U/mL), were mixed in varying
proportions distributed over the measurement range. Samples were
measured in triplicate. When data was limited to plus or minus 30% of
the measuring range, as per CLSI guidelines, Dimension Vista Flex assay
data correlated with expected sample concentration according to the
weighted linear regression formula (y=1.00x - 0.1, R2=0.999).
ii) Spiking and Dilutional Recovery was evaluated.
a. Spiking Recovery
Known amounts of CA 125, approximately 35, 70, 140, 560 and 840
U/mL, were added to serum samples with baseline CA 125 values of
5.4 U/mL or 44.4 U/mL) and to plasma samples with a baseline CA
125 value of 16.7 U/mL. The CA 125 concentrations were measured
and the percent recovery ranged from 77.9 - 104% for serum and 89.2-
100.7% for EDTA plasma.

a. Value Assignment
An anchor pool of CA 125 is made from highly purified, cell culture
derived CA 125 material. Value is assigned to the Anchor pool by
comparing it to patient samples assayed by the predicate device. The
anchor pool is then diluted into a series of 5 Master pools whose
values are determined on the Dimension® Vista System. The Master
pool materials are then aliquoted into the commercial product whose
values are confirmed on the Dimension® Vista System. The five-level
calibrators are then used to calibrate the CA 125II method.
b. Stability
Frozen liquid calibrator stability is 12 months from the date of
manufacture when stored unopened at -20ºC. Thawed liquid calibrator
stability is 30 days when stored unopened at 2-8ºC. Once the vial stopper
is punctured, the assigned calibrator values are stable for 30 days on
board the Dimension Vista System. LOCI 7 calibrators should not be
used on board the instrument once the cap is removed. One lot of control
calibrator (reference material stored at -70ºC) and three production lots of
calibrator were tested. The acceptance criterion was <5% deviation from
reference concentration for levels B-E
iii) Kit Stability
Refer to carton for expiration date of individual unopened reagent cartridges.
Sealed wells on the instrument are stable for 30 days. Once opened, reagents
are stable for 7 days on-board the instrument.
Shelf-life stability (expiration) dating assignment at commercialization
reflects the real time stability data on file at Siemens Healthcare
Diagnostics. LOCI CA125II assay cartridges are stable for 12 months
from the date of manufacture when stored at 2-8ºC.
d. Detection limit:
Limits of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) were determined using 2 kit
lots on 2 instruments (one per lot) using CLSI protocol EP17-A.
i) Serum: Five low CA 125 serum samples were tested using two lots of LOCI
CA 125 reagents on two Vista instruments. Tested CA 125 values in Blank
serum samples ranged from approximately -1.260 to -0.365U/mL with
standard deviation (SD) of 239. Samples ranging from 0.710 to 4.507 U/mL
were used to estimate LoD.
ii) Plasma: Three low CA 125 Lithium Heparin Plasma samples or three EDTA
plasma samples were tested using two lots of LOCI CA 125 reagents on two
Vista instruments. Tested CA 125 values in Blank plasma samples ranged
from approximately -1.3 to -0.0 U/mL with SD of 0.302. Lithium Heparin
plasma samples ranging from -0.9 to 2.0 U/mL with SD=0.590 or EDTA
plasma samples ranging from -0.6 to 3.6 U/mL with SD=0.578 were used to
estimate LoD.
iii) Acceptance criteria for the LoB, LoD, and Limit of quantitation (LoQ), were
described as follows:
LoB – highest measurement result which has a 95% probability to be
observed for a blank sample. It is the 95th percentile of a blank
distribution. Where Blank values are negative, this is estimated as
11

--- Page 12 ---
1.645 x SD of blank values. The data generated here give the highest
value of LoB=1.645x 0.302=0.497 which was rounded to LoB=0.5
U/mL.
LoD – lowest amount of analyte that can be detected with 95% probability,
though not quantified at an exact value. LoD=LoB+ SD x C or 0.5 +
β
0.590 x 1.653=1.475 which was rounded to LoD=1.5 U/mL.
LoQ – lowest actual amount of analyte that can be reliably detected and at
which total error meets lab requirements for accuracy. LoQ was
not claimed for the Dimension Vista CA 125 assay.
The results are noted to support a claim for LoB and LoD of less
than 1.5 U/mL. Therefore, the lowest value for the range of the
assay is 1.5 U/mL, based upon Lithium Heparin data.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed according to CLSI/NCCLS EP7-A2 to
determine the effect of various endogenous and exogenous substances on the
Dimension Vista® CA 125 assays. For all interferents the percent bias was
determined by testing a control serum sample without the interferent and
comparing it to the value obtained from a test sample to which the potential
interferent had been added.
Testing was performed with one lot of Flex® reagents. Hemolytic and icteric
interference was tested with two lots of Flex® reagents.
i) Endogenous Substance Interference
Testing was performed at two CA 125 concentrations: 45 ± 5 U/mL and
970 ± 50 U/mL (45 ± 5 and 500-1000 U/mL for Lipemia, Hemoglobin and
Bilirubin testing).
Hemoglobin, triglyceride, bilirubin: The CA 125 method was evaluated
for interference according to CLSI/NCCLS EP7-A2.25. Bias is the
difference in the results between the control sample (without the
interferent) and the test sample (contains the interferent) expressed in
percent. Bias exceeding 10% is considered interference.

tested with bias <10%.
ii) Exogenous Substance Interference
61 additional endogenous and exogenous substances were tested for
interference including common over-the-counter drugs and cancer drugs. All
recorded biases were less than the 10% acceptance criteria.
iii) HAMA interference
A number of optimized concentrations of HAMA blockers are employed
in the reaction, as well as reagents designed to minimize non-specific
binding (NSB) interference. Interference from HAMA was evaluated by
testing commercially available sera (three replicates) containing up to
327.1 mg/mL HAMA. All of the CA 125 results from the 10 samples
evaluated were within 10% of control values or showed <1 U/mL
difference from control.
f. Assay cut-off:
The sponsor defined a >70.1% percentage change in CA 125 values as
significant. This significant change is the calculated Reference Change Value
for the assay. This is a statistical calculation that considers the analytical
imprecision of the CA 125 assay on the Dimension Vista instrument as well as
the intra-individual biological variation noted for CA 125 levels in a study of
healthy females determined by reference. The sponsor chose this value to
ensure that the change in CA 125 value is not attributed to assay variation or
normal variation. The RCV value also considers a z value for significant
change (p,0.05), so that assay results that change by RCV should be within the
95% confidence interval.
The RCV was derived by taking into account the published biological variation
and total imprecision for the Dimension Vista® LOCI CA 125 assay. In
determining the RCV, the analytical variation used was 5.2% (which is the
reported total variability (Within laboratory Total %CV at 11.2 U/mL). The
within-subject biological variation (24.7%) was obtained from the literature.
The RCV for the Dimension Vista® LOCI CA 125 method was calculated to
be 70.1%.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
One serum sample randomly chosen from each of the 75 women with cervical
cancer who were tested for the monitoring of their disease status were combined
with 77 excess de-identified serum samples containing measureable CA 125.
Each sample was assayed for the observed values (154 samples) using the
Dimension Vista® CA 125 (Y) assay and compared with the expected values
using the ADVIA Centaur® CA 125 (X). Because the Advia device has a
different measuring range than the Vista, the results limited to the measuring
range of both devices (139 samples) are presented below (Passing & Bablock).
The equation represents the relationship between the two techniques.

b. Matrix comparison:
The Dimension Vista Flex Assay for CA 125 was evaluated in Serum,
LiHeparin Plasma, and EDTA plasma.
i. Serum samples (1.8-1268.3 U/mL) were evaluated with matched samples
of Lithium Heparin plasma (2.4-1264.9 U/mL). The two methods were
evaluated with 90 samples over the measuring range of the device (linear
regression line y=0.93x - 0.93 and R=0.999).
ii. Serum samples were evaluated with matched samples of EDTA plasma.
The two methods were evaluated with 68 samples over the measuring
range of the device (linear regression line y=1.00x - 0.29 and R=0.999).

3. Clinical studies:
In a study of frozen specimens from 75 subjects with at least 3 serum samples
collected during the course of follow-up surveillance for ovarian cancer
progression, 255 visits for each of these 75 patients, following their initial
evaluation (330 total CA 125 determinations) were cross-tabulated with a change
in Dimension Vista CA 125 concentration of ≥70.1% at each surveillance visit.
Clinical information that details the status of the subject’s disease was required
for inclusion of samples in the study.
Patient CA 125 values were compared to disease state on a per visit basis.
Patients were categorized as Active/Progressive, Responding, Stable, or No
Evidence of Disease (NED) by the attending physician based on the clinical
information (medical imaging, physical examination, and other clinical
investigations). All 75 patient sets were analyzed to determine the change in
disease status per sequential pair (n=255). Table below shows the distribution of
results when compared to the disease status.
A >70.1% rise in CA 125 value correlated with clinical progression in 62.12% of
cases. No significant change in CA 125 values correlated with stable disease or
no evidence of disease in 66% of cases. A >70.1% decrease in CA 125 value
correlated with clinical response or no evidence of disease in 58.9% of cases.
Overall expected changes in clinical status corresponded with CA 125 changes in

Per patient visit clinical performance results for the Dimension Vista® LOCI CA
125 II™ test and predicate devices are given in the following two tables. In this
evaluation, disease status was classified as “Progression” and “No Progression”
with “No Progression” consisting of responding, stable, and no evidence of
disease.
Using a cut-off of >70.1% rise in CA 125 value, 56.8% of subject visits (95%
confidence interval 44.7% to 68.2%) had a rise in CA 125 value when the
patient’s disease status was classified as progression. This value represents the
positive percent agreement of significant CA 125 rise with a progression disease
status.

Using a cut-off of a >70.1% rise in CA 125 value, 86.7% of subject visits (95%
confidence interval 89.9% to 91.3%) had no rise in CA 125 value when the
patient’s disease status was classified as no progression. This value represents the
negative percent agreement of CA 125 rises with a progressive disease status.
The positive and negative agreement for the LOCI CA125II method, when taken
together, show similar performance to the predicate method (below):

4. Clinical cut-off:
Clinical Cut-off is based upon a 70.1% reference change value (RCV). When the
measurement of CA 125 varies by 70.1.8% of the baseline (either positive or
negative) the change is considered significant. The RCV was used to ensure that
the change in CA 125 value is not attributed to assay variation or biological variation.
This percent variation represents values within the 95% confidence interval for real
alteration in CA 125 values above system noise.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The distribution of CA 125 values was determined in specimens from healthy
individuals (n= 198; females) and from patients with nonmalignant or malignant
diseases. 96.5% of 198 samples from apparently healthy adult females (age 18-64
years) had CA 125 levels less than or equal to 35 U/mL.
Each laboratory should establish its own reference values for healthy patients’ CA
125 levels as performed on the Dimension Vista® System.
Expected values of CA 125 measurements are dependent upon the individual
patient’s baseline reading for CA 125. Decreases from baseline value of 70.1% or
more in any subsequent repeated measurements are indicative of response to
therapy or remission. Increases of 70.1% or more suggest no response to therapy
and correlate with progression of disease.
Estimation and empirical distributions of CA 125 II values in various populations
of subjects was performed. The distribution of CA 125 values in 198 healthy
individuals, 198 patients with nonmalignant and 370 patients with malignant
disease is shown in the attached tables.
