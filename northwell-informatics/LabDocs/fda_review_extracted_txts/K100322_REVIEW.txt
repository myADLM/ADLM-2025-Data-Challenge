L. Test Principle:
Glucose dehydrogenase assay and amperometric technology is used. The reaction
utilizes the enzyme glucose dehydrogenase to catalyze the formation of
gluconolactone from the oxidation of glucose whereby two electrons are produced.
Through the mechanism of the mediator, electrical current is generated and it is
proportional to the quantity of glucose in the sample.

precision, three level glucose control solutions were used instead of blood
specimen to prevent glucose degradation effect (glycolysis), and this
evaluation was performed for ten days. Repeatability was performed at 5
levels with spiked venous blood samples as short a period of time (30
minutes) as possible to minimize the effect of glycolysis.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Testing was conducted using venous blood spiked with D-glucose to provide
11 samples spaced across the range of <20 mg/dL to >700 mg/dL. Testing
was conducted using TD-4277 meter with TD-4277 test strips, and YSI-2300
glucose analyzer as the reference method.

--- Page 6 ---
Samples were divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was used to perform on
the TD-4277 meter and the second aliquot was analyzed on the YSI. For each
level solution, 5 consecutive tests were performed by TD-4277 and YSI each.
Regression analysis calculated in the range 16.8-669 mg/dL is:
Y = 1.0268x - 6.8852
R2 0.9977
The applicant is using this study to support the claimed measuring range of
20-600 mg/dL
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Control solutions are prepared to fall within each of three levels 35 – 65,
112-168 and 224 -336 and then check against YSI-2300. Acceptance Criteria
is if the coefficient of variation (CV%) of each level of control solution is less
than 5% in both measurement results by glucose meter, and YSI-2300, and the
mean values of the measurement results by a glucose meter is within the
specified range of values.
Control open/closed stability claimed is based on real time studies, based on
the coefficient of variation (C.V %) for each level of the control solution is
less than 5% in measurement results by YSI-2300 and the mean values of the
measurement results by a glucose meter is within the specified range of
values.
The results demonstrated that the Control Solution (Level 1, 2, 3) are stable
for 90 days after opening, and have a shelf-life of 24 months by meeting the
acceptance criteria when stored at 36oF to 86oF (2 - 32oC).
The strip storage claims are: 90 days for open vial of strips stored at 2 – 32 °C
and 24 months for unopened vials of strips stored at 2 - 32°C.
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the system is 20 - 600 mg/dL. This range was verified
by the linearity study in section M.1.b above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Seven volunteer subjects were healthy and had not taken medications prior to
blood donation. Blood was obtained from the forearm of fasting volunteers
and collected in 5-mL lithium EDTA Vacutainers. The high glucose level
(300mg/dL) was achieved by adding 10% dextrose solution to the blood pool.

The above table lists the drug concentrations at which interference with
glucose measurements was greater than ±10%. Most of the concentrations are
higher than therapeutic or physiological levels.
There were no significant interferences observed for galactose, maltose and
fructose, however, xylose showed a significant interference for concentrations
above 50mg/dL in both high and low glucose levels.
No interference was observed in the rest of the interfering substances at
therapeutic or physiological levels either at low or high glucose levels.

A survey for the ease of use of the TD-4277 meter was carried out by
providing subjects with questionnaires for rating the ease of understanding of
the instructions and overall ease of use of the device after they finished the
blood glucose tests. 100% of the users had above 3 (neutral) in average rating
with a scale of 1-5 for ease of use of the device.
b. Matrix comparison:
The blood glucose measurement accuracy of the proposed device with venous
samples was evaluated. Fresh venous whole blood samples were tested using
both TD-4277 and the reference method, YSI-2300 glucose analyzer.
One hundred (100) samples from 24.5-579 mg/dL were included. The fresh
venous whole blood samples were from different individuals except those
with blood glucose concentration less than 40 mg/dL and greater than 400
mg/dL. For those samples less than 40 mg/dL and greater than 400 mg/dL, a
pooled venous whole blood sample was used instead and spiked to the desired
level as in the above matrix comparison distribution of samples.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
The data management software used to acquire the data from the proposed device was
cleared, under k070941. Ease of use in data transmission from a blood glucose meter
to a PC has been validated in both the submissions of the data management software
and the predicate device, FORA G30 BLOOD GLUCOSE MONITORING SYSTEM
(K090187) and the method of setting up and transmission in the subject device are the
same as the predicate device. The sponsor provided an acceptable report for the data
accuracy for change from RS-232 to USB connection.
The sponsor conducted the FleschKincaid readability assessment of the User Manual
and obtained a grade level score equivalent to an average student in 8th grade reading
level. The test strip and control solution package inserts have a 7th grade reading
level.
Hematocrit Study:
To test accuracy due to the hematocrit effect, venous blood samples were collected in
an anti-coagulant (Li-EDTA) vacuum tube, and glucose levels were adjusted to the
following ranges; 10-20 mg/dL, 20-50 mg/dL, 50-100 mg/dL, 100-200 mg/dL, 200-
350 mg/dL, 350-450 mg/dL, 450-550 mg/dL, and 600-700 mg/dL. Samples were
then adjusted to hematocrit levels of 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%,
55%, 60%, and 65%. The YSI 2300 was used as the reference method. The results
of the hematocrit study were reviewed and found to be acceptable for 20% to 60%
hematocrit.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
