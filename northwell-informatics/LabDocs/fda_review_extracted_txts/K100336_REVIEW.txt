I. Device Description:
The EraGen MultiCode®-RTx Herpes Simplex Virus 1 & 2 kit is a polymerase
chain reaction (PCR)-based qualitative in vitro diagnostic test for the detection
and typing of herpes simplex virus 1 & 2 (HSV 1 & 2) DNA using vaginal swab
specimens.
Patient vaginal swab specimens are collected in Copan Universal Transport
Medium, or identical Copan manufactured media formulations (Becton
Dickinson Universal Viral Transport Media, Copan branded Universal
Transport Medium for LabCorp, and the Quest Viral Culture Media) and
transported to the laboratory. An extractable sample processing control (SPC)
target is added to the specimen prior to lysis. The SPC controls for specimen
lysis, for recovery of extracted nucleic acid, for inhibitory substances and for
PCR reagent and instrument integrity. The specimen is lysed and nucleic acid is
extracted using the Roche MagNA Pure LC instrument using the Roche MagNA
Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit.
A sample of the extracted nucleic acid is added to the MultiCode®-RTx Herpes
Simplex Virus 1 & 2 Kit reagents that contain a primer pair specific to HSV-1
and HSV-2 and a second primer pair specific to the SPC sequence. The two
specific primer pairs are labeled with distinct fluorophore labels. PCR
amplification is performed and assay fluorescence is monitored using the Roche
LightCycler 1.2 real-time PCR instrument. Incorporation of the quencher-
labeled nucleotide causes a decrease in assay fluorescence. Following
amplification, the reaction is slowly heated and fluorescence is monitored. The
strands of the amplification products will separate at a specific melting
temperature (T ) that is determined by an increase in fluorescence as the strands
m
are separated. The instrument fluorescence output is analyzed and test results
are determined using the MultiCode®-RTx Herpes Simplex Virus 1 & 2 Kit
Analysis Software. A printed results report is generated.
MultiCode®-RTx HSV 1&2 Kit contains HSV-1&2 Primer Mix, HSV-1&2

L. Test Principle:
Following nucleic acid extraction from a patient swab specimen, a fluorophore-
labeled PCR primer pair amplifies a segment of the glycoprotein B gene of
HSV-1 and HSV-2. The sample processing control (SPC) will also be amplified
by a distinct fluorophore-labeled PCR primer pair unless there are sample
processing errors, inhibitory substances in the PCR reaction, reagent failure, or
instrument malfunction.
The MultiCode®-RTx system is based on an expanded genetic alphabet
technology, consisting of 2’-deoxy-5-methyl-isocytidine (iC) and 2’-deoxy-
isoguanosine (iG) nucleotide bases also known as isobases. The isobases pair
specifically with each other and not with natural nucleotides. In addition
isobases are efficiently incorporated during PCR. The isobase pair allows site-
specific incorporation of a dabcyl quencher directly adjacent to a fluorophore-
labeled primer. During PCR amplification, a quencher-modified iGTP is
incorporated by the polymerase opposite an iC and a fluorophore reporter
attached to a PCR primer. If target is present and is amplified, assay
fluorescence decreases with every cycle as amplification product accumulates.
The decrease in assay fluorescence is monitored in real time using the Roche
LightCycler 1.2 instrument. Following PCR, the amplification products are
thermally denatured and assay fluorescence is monitored. The strands of the

determining the melting temperature (T ) profile of the amplicon. The
m
sequences between the PCR primer binding sites of the HSV-1 and HSV-2
amplicons have different base compositions that are distinguished by their
different melting temperatures using the MultiCode®-RTx HSV 1&2 Analysis
Software.

The Precision/Reproducibility of the MultiCode®-RTx HSV 1&2 Kit was
evaluated at 3 U.S. clinical laboratories. A panel was prepared containing 6
simulated HSV-1 and HSV-2 samples that included High Negative, Low
Positive (near the assay limit of detection) and Moderate Positive samples.
The panel along with the external HSV-1 and HSV-2 positive and negative
controls (Cytomegalovirus) was assayed in triplicate. The external Controls
were included to monitor the study site DNA extraction and amplification
processes during each assay run. Kit positive and negative controls were
included with each assay run. Panels and controls were tested at each site by
2 operators, 1 time each per day for 5 days (N = 900). Results of the
Precision/Reproducibility studies for the MultiCode®-RTx HSV 1&2 assay
are presented from three sites in the tables below.

Note: The LOD value for HSV-1 was shown higher than HSV-2. This could
be due to mismatch in the forward primer because a single set of forward
and reverse HSV primers was used to amplify the target region from HSV-1
and HSV-2. The HSV Forward primer is a perfect match with the HSV-2
glycoprotein B sequence but contains a one base mismatch with the HSV-1
glycoprotein B sequence. The mismatch is in the center of the primer with
10 bases 3’ to the mismatch. The predicted T for the forward primer to
m
HSV-1 is 57.4°C; the predicted T for the forward primer to HSV-2 is
m

59.8°C. It is likely that in the initial rounds of PCR, HSV-2 is amplified
more efficiently than HSV-1 which could result in a small increase in
analytical sensitivity for HSV-2.
e. Analytical specificity:
Analytical Specificity/Cross Reactivity of the MultiCode®-RTx HSV 1&2
Kit was evaluated at EraGen Biosciences. A panel was prepared containing
22 different organisms representing near-neighbors to the HSV-1 and HSV-
2 virus and organisms reasonably expected to be present in vaginal swab
specimens.
The cross-reactivity panel was tested in a background of Copan Universal
Transport Media at the concentration indicated in the table below. No HSV
positive results were observed for any of the organisms tested and the DNA
SPC was detected in all cases. The organism panel was also spiked into
HSV-1 and HSV-2 near the device’s Limit of Detection (LoD) and tested.
No interference was observed from any of the tested organisms, and all the
results were positive for HSV-1 or HSV-2 as expected.

f. Interfering Substances:
An Interfering Substance study was performed at EraGen Biosciences to
evaluate the effects of potential interfering substances on the MultiCode®-
RTx HSV 1&2 Kit. A panel was prepared containing 6 substances and was
tested at two different concentrations that could reasonably be expected to
be present in vaginal swab specimens. The substance panel was tested near
the device’s Limit of Detection (LoD) for HSV-1 and HSV-2. No
interference was observed in the presence of exogenous and endogenous
substances in an extractable sample.

g. Carry-over/Cross-Contamination
Carry-over/Contamination studies were done only with HSV-1 target,
since both HSV-1 and HSV-2 share a single set of primers. The
MultiCode®-RTx HSV 1&2 Kit was evaluated internally using simulated
samples at the LoB and High Positive HSV-1 (1700X LoD) samples. Ten
sets of samples in a sequence pattern of High Positive-LoB-LoB were
aliquoted into a 32-well sample plate and extracted using the Roche
MagNA Pure LC instrument. The high positive sample was positive for
HSV-1 in all cases and all LoB samples were negative for HSV-1
indicating that there was no carry-over/cross-contamination of HSV-1 in
the LoB samples.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The clinical performance evaluation was done against a gold
standard/reference method i.e., Cell Culture using an enzyme linked virus
inducible system.

Clinical Performance
Performance characteristics of the MultiCode®-RTx HSV 1&2 assay were
established during a prospective study performed at 3 U.S. clinical
laboratories from 2008-2009. A total of 1041 vaginal swab specimens were
tested by the MultiCode®-RTx HSV 1&2 Kit and by the reference method.
The swab specimens were collected from lesions in Copan Universal
Transport Medium from the patient population ranged from 18 to 85 years.
One swab specimen was collected from each patient in Copan Universal
Transport Medium and was tested for HSV-1 and HSV-2 using both the
Diagnostics Hybrids, In. ELVIS culture and typing test and the EraGen
MultiCode-RTx test.
A total of 1041 swab specimens were tested using the MultiCode®-RTx
HSV 1&2 assay at three sites. Results from Prospective Study are shown in

Competitive Inhibition
Competitive Inhibition of the MultiCode®-RTx HSV 1&2 Kit was
evaluated internally using simulated samples with varying concentrations
of HSV-1 virus (1X LoD to 1000X LoD) and HSV-2 virus (1X LoD to
1000X LoD). Competitive inhibition was observed. The highest
concentration of co-infecting target that can be present while maintaining
95% detection of the 3X LoD target for HSV-1 was 1X LoD for HSV-2.
The highest concentration of co-infecting target that can be present while
maintaining 95% detection of the 3X LoD target for HSV-2 was 1X LoD
for HSV-1.
Competitive Inhibition was also evaluated internally using simulated
samples with equal concentrations of HSV-1 virus and HSV-2 virus (5X
LoD to 500X LoD). Competitive inhibition was not observed at any of the
concentrations tested when the concentrations of HSV-1 and HSV-2 were
equal.
4. Clinical cut-off: N/A
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The prevalence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 during the 2008 - 2009 multi-site clinical
study (n=1041 specimens collected December 2008 - June 2009) was estimated
using the MultiCode®-RTx test. Geographical distribution of study population
included in the study consisted of 74 Midwest (12 States), 813 South (16
States), 153 West (13 States), and 1 Northeast (9 States). The combined
prevalence was used to calculate the positive predictive values (PPV) and
negative predictive values (NPV) of the MultiCode®-RTx test. The calculations
are based on the sensitivity and specificity values obtained from the clinical
studies: sensitivity of 92.4% and specificity of 98.3% for HSV-1; sensitivity of
95.2% and specificity of 93.6% for HSV-2. The MultiCode®-RTx HSV 1 & 2
assay results are summarized in the following tables:
