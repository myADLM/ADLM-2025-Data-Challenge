L. Test Principle:
SpermCheck® Fertility test is a rapid qualitative test detecting the presence of sperm
in human semen at 20,000,000 sperm/mL and above. The test employs solid-phase
chromatographic immunoassay technology and sperm are detected using antibodies
against sperm acrosome-specific protein analyte SP10. This protein is a post meiotic
gene product expressed selectively in spermatids. In the test procedure, a semen
sample mixed with a test solution is dispensed into the sample well, the sample
migrates into the pads containing lyophilized detector antibody that is conjugated to
gold dye. If the sample contains sperm, upon hydration by the applied sample,
complexes are formed consisting of antibody-dye + antigen (SP10). The complexes
and excess hydrated antibodies migrate forward via capillary action on the
nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane serves as a solid support upon which
capture antibody (test band) and anti-species IgG antibodies (control band) are
immobilized. The immobilization of these reagents on the nitrocellulose membrane,

in defined areas, allows for the formation of distinct colored bands that can be read
visually. The complex of antibody-dye + antigen is captured by antibody on the
membrane and a red line appears at the test band on the membrane. If the sample
contains sperm below the detection level, no line appears at the test band.
Anti-species IgG antibodies are immobilized at the control band. These antibodies
will bind to unreacted/excess antibody-gold conjugates, resulting in the formation of a
distinct line at the control band. Line formation serves as a control to demonstrate that
lyophilized antibodies in the dye pad have been hydrated and that sufficient sample
has been applied to allow for migration to the test band and beyond. If a control line
does not appear within the designated incubation time, the test is invalid and should
be repeated.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was performed by carrying out the test for two days by three
different operators with two lots of devices. The semen samples were prepared
by diluting the pooled normal semen to the appropriate sperm concentrations.
The samples were randomly distributed. The tested concentrations were
30,200,000, 21,600,000, 10,100,000, 5,200,000, 3,000,000, 980,000
sperm/mL. The test results agreed 100% with the expected results. No
significant difference in the performance was found between lots, days, and
operators.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability
Real time stability testing was performed. At each test time point, negative,
very low positive (approximately the level of sensitivity), and medium
positive (2 times the level of sensitivity) controls were tested in triplicate for
each sample level Three lots of test devices have been tested and the test
results are acceptable up to 16 months at ambient temperature.
d. Detection limit:
A pooled semen sample from normal men was diluted with a pooled semen
sample from vasectomized male donors to sperm concentrations of
21,300,000, 15,500,000 and 10,700,000 sperm/mL. Each concentration was
tested in eight (8) replicates with SpermCheck® Fertility test. The results
support the 20,000,000 sperm/mL (i.e., 20M/mL) Sensitivity level of the
SpermCheck® Fertility test as follows.
Sperm Concentration Percent Positive Percent Negative
(x106 Sperm/mL) (Positive/Total) (Negative/Total)
10.7 0 (0/8) 100 (8/8)
15.5 62.5 (5/8) 37.5 (3/8)
21.3 100 (8/8) 0 (0/8)

d. Analytical specificity:
The cross-reactivity and potential interference of various substances on the
SpermCheck® Fertility test were tested using substance-spiked semen
samples. Each substance was spiked into 20M sperm/mL samples and also
into vasectomized semen samples (no sperm in the semen) to obtain the
desired concentrations. All tested substances showed no cross-reactivity or
potential interference on the SpermCheck® Fertility test at the level tested as
follows.
Substances Test Concentration
Escherichia coli 1 x 107/mL
Corynebacterium diptheria 1 x 107/mL
Neisseria gonorrhea 1 x 107/mL
Chlamydia trachomatis 3.1 x 105/mL

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The WHO standard procedure of determining sperm concentration with a
hemacytometer was used as a reference method to establish the performance
of the SpermCheck® Fertility test. Semen samples were either collected from
194 men who participated in the study or obtained as de-identified post-
vasectomy clinical specimens (n=33). Two of the samples collected from the
study participants were excluded from the analysis either because the subject
did not observe the required 48 hour abstinence period (n=1) or because the
volume of the ejaculate was insufficient for testing (n=1). A total of 225
samples were counted with a hemacytometer following a standard operating
procedure and tested with SpermCheck® Fertility test by a laboratory
professional. Since the detection level of SpermCheck® Fertility test is
20,000,000 sperm/mL, the data comparison was made with this concentration
as a decision level between positive and negative as follows.

(i). Consumer Use Study: A consumer use study was conducted to
determine the test performance when used by unassisted lay users
following the instructions in the package insert. The study was
conducted in two ways: 1) Performance of the consumer at home with
his own semen sample; 2) Performance of the consumer with provided
semen samples.
In the study of the consumer at home with his own semen sample, 61
participants in this study obtained 52 positive and 8 negative
SpermCheck® Fertility test results. One test was invalid. There was
95.1% (58/61) agreement between the results obtained by the home
users and those obtained by laboratory professionals reading the same
test device.
In the study of consumers provided with semen samples, 41 people (38
male and 30 female) participated. All results showed 100% agreement.

Total 82 82 0 164 100
(ii). High Dose Hook Effect Study: To assess whether the SpermCheck®
Fertility test device would give false negative results with very high
concentrations of sperm due to the hook effect, semen samples of
various sperm concentrations of up to 254 million sperm/mL were
tested. The results were read by an optical density reader. The signal
intensity increased as the sperm concentration increased and no signal
reduction was observed. In a separate study, a total of 21 clinical
samples with sperm concentrations ranging from 22.2 million sperm/mL
to 741 million sperm/mL were tested with SpermCheck® Fertility test.
All samples showed positive test results, and no false negative result due
to the hook effect.
