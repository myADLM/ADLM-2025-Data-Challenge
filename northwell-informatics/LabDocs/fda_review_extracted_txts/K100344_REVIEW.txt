L. Test Principle:
The LOCI CA 15-3 method is a homogeneous, sandwich chemiluminescent
immunoassay based on LOCI® technology. The LOCI® reagents include two synthetic
bead reagents and a biotinylated anti-CA 15-3 monoclonal antibody (DF3) fragment.
The first bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with an anti-CA 15-3 monoclonal antibody
(115D8) and contains a chemiluminescent dye. The second bead reagent (Sensibeads) is
coated with streptavidin and contains a photosensitizer dye. Sample is incubated with
biotinylated antibody and Chemibeads to form bead-CA 15-3-biotinylated antibody
sandwiches. Sensibeads are added and bind to the biotin to form bead-pair
immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex at 680 nm generates singlet oxygen
from Sensibeads which diffuses into the Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent
reaction. The resulting signal is measured at 612 nm and is a direct function of the CA
15-3 concentration in the sample when measured against a calibration curve.

lots.
The test samples consisted of three levels of Bio-Rad LiquichekTM Tumor
Marker control (Level-1, 2 and 3), three serum and two plasma pools. One of
the serum samples was in the lower portion of the normal range, one
approximately at the medical decision level and one at the upper end of the
assay range. Two of the serum pools (spiked pool-B and high-spiked pool-E)
and one of the plasma pools (Lithium heparin pool-C) were spiked with CA
15-3 antigen.
The range of samples tested encompassed the analytical measuring range.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the data consistent with
the recommendations of EP5-A2. This experiment allowed a determination of
within-run precision (repeatability), within-day, between days, between runs
(within lab) precision for each site and a determination of between site
precision.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
i) The linear range was determined according to CLSI EP06-A. Based on the results
of linearity range testing and that from the Limit of Detection Study, the
analytical measuring range of 1 – 300 U/mL was established in three matrices:
serum, Lithium Heparin plasma, and EDTA plasma.
a) Serum
Linearity study of serum was completed over a range that is 20 to 30% wider
than the anticipated measuring range for both the full assay range and the low
end. The full assay range included serum as diluent, the low-end linearity
which extends to 1 U/mL has water as diluent (as no samples were available
with CA 15-3 values close to 0). The observed values in each case represent
the mean of 3 replicates. Both studies indicate that the assay is linear over the
assay range.
The mean concentration value was calculated for each sample. The percent
recovery of observed CA 15-3 concentration relative to expected
concentration was calculated. The mean recoveries for the three individual
samples in the high-end range (serum diluent in serum weighted) shows
acceptable linearity up to 366 U/mL using weighted linear regression model
assuming constant CV. Weighted linear regression analysis was performed on
the observed versus expected CA 15-3 assay results. The regression analysis
yielded a slope of 1.005 and a y-intercept of -0.02 U/mL.
For the low end of the assay range, linearity testing was performed on a serum
sample with dilutions ranging from 0 – 35 U/mL. All levels meet the
acceptance criteria and that the method can be accepted as linear across the
tested range; the analysis yielded R2=0.999 with 95% CI for the slope of 0.98
to 0.99 and for the intercept of 0 to 0.
b) Lithium Heparin and EDTA Plasma
Linearity of Lithium Heparin plasma shows acceptable linearity up to 363
U/mL, yielding a slope of 1.00 and a y-intercept of 0.02 U/mL. EDTA plasma
demonstrates acceptable linearity up to 360 U/mL using weighted data,
yielding a slope of 1.00 and a y-intercept of 0.01 U/mL.
ii) Spiking and Dilution Recovery Studies:
a) Spiking Recovery: Known amounts of CA 15-3 at concentrations between
10.3 and 235.5 U/mL were added to human serum with baseline CA 15-3
values of 4.3 and 4.7 U/mL. The recovered CA 15-3 concentrations on these
samples were then measured and the calculated percent recovery ranged from
96.3 to 105.1%.

iii) High Dose Hook-effect
Hook effect was evaluated using samples prepared by adding commercial CA 15-
3 antigen to calibrator matrix. The Dimension Vista® instrument reports an error
message “Above Assay range” when the result is above the assay range of 300
U/mL. Users are instructed in the labeling (Limitations of procedure) that
samples having this error code should be repeated with dilution. Based on this
procedure, the data shows that CA 15-3 method shows no hook effect up to
20,000 U/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i) Traceability:
There is no recognized standard or reference material for assay calibration. The
LOCI 7 calibrator is a liquid, frozen, bovine serum albumin based product
containing CA 15-3 from human tissue culture.

ii) Calibrator:
The Dimension Vista® LOCI 7 Calibrator (KC605) is an in-vitro diagnostic
product intended to be used to calibrate the Vista® CA 15-3 method. It is a
multi-analyte frozen liquid product consists of ten vials, packaged as two vials for
each of five levels (A-E), 2.0 mL per vial. The matrix is 6% bovine albumin with
buffer and preservatives; level A is zero, while levels B to E contain purified CA
15-3 antigen. Target values for CA 15-3 are 0, 20, 60, 150 and 315 U/mL. The
master pool is a frozen liquid five-level material, with composition identical to the
calibrator, held in reserve.
a) Value assignment:
An anchor pool of purified CA 15-3 is prepared and a value is assigned by
comparing to patient samples assayed by the predicate device. Values are
assigned to each lot of calibrator from the master pool using the Dimension
Vista® System, through a patient sample comparison to the predicate ADVIA®
Centaur CA 15-3 assay.
b) Stability:
Frozen liquid calibrator stability is 12 months from the date of manufacture
when stored unopened at -20ºC. Thawed liquid calibrator stability is 30 days
when stored unopened at 2-8ºC. Once the vial stopper is punctured, the
assigned calibrator values are stable for 30 days on board the Dimension Vista
System. LOCI 7 calibrators are not to be used on board the instrument once
the cap is removed.
iii) Kit Stability:
Unopened flexes were stored at 4°C as control condition and on board a
Dimension Vista instrument for 15 and 33 days. After 15 days and 33 days, the
instrument was calibrated and the recovery of calibrators and QC materials with
an on-board stored flex was compared to recovery with a control flex. The losses
as a result of storage were within acceptable limits of ± 5%, indicating Sealed
wells on the instrument are stable for 30 days.
Open vial stability: CA 15-3 flexes were tested for open well stability by using a
linear depletion approach. The lot was calibrated on Day 0 and then tested on
Day 0, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. Two flex well sets were used per sample. All wells were
opened on day 0. For each well set, 5 tests were run on Day 0, and 3 on each of
the other test days, for a total of 20 tests. Samples were calibrator level A and E,
and a serum pool between 30 and 40 U/mL. The testing time for day 7 was at
least 2 hours later than on day 0, to ensure the tested interval was wider than the
claim of 7 days open-well stability. The losses as a result of storage were within
acceptable limits of ± 5%, indicating Open wells are stable for 7 days.
d. Detection limit:
CLSI/NCCLS EP 17-A, Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and
Limits of Quantitation, were followed to determine the lowest concentration of CA
15-3 that can be detected with at least 95% probability; that is, with proportions of
false positives (α) less than 5% and false negatives (β) less than 5%; based on 120

--- Page 11 ---
11
determinations, with 5 blank and 5 low level samples. Five CA 15-3 free test samples
and five non-zero samples were tested for three days, one run per day, 2 replicates per
run, with two reagent (Flex®) lots, on two instruments. Testing was performed using
the same lot of calibrator, by the same operator, instrument and operator.
LOB – Highest measurement result which has a 95% probability to be observed for a
blank sample. It is the 95th percentile of a blank distribution. CA 15-3
negative sera were not available. Therefore, five lots of LOCI-7 calibrator A
(0 level calibrator) were tested; the calibrator matrix has a 6% BSA base. The
Limit of Blank (LoB) calculated was 0.31 U/mL (claimed 0.3 U/mL).
LOD – No serum samples in the concentration range of the expected LoD were
available. Five serum samples with concentrations in the range of 3-6 U/mL
were diluted between 4-fold and 10-fold with calibrator A (0 level calibrator)
to concentrations covering the range where LoD was expected to fall. The
Limit of Detection (LoD) for CA 15-3 calculated was 1.0 U/mL.
LOQ – Lowest actual amount of analyte that can be reliably detected and at which
total error meets lab requirements for accuracy. LOQ was not claimed for the
Dimension Vista CA 15-3 assay.
The results are noted to support a claim for LOB of 0.3 U/mL and of LOD of 1.0
U/mL. Therefore, the lowest value for the range of the assay is 1.0 U/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed according to CLSI/NCCLS EP7-A2 to determine
the effect of various endogenous and exogenous substances on the Dimension Vista®
CA 15-3 assays. For all interferents the percent bias was determined by testing a
control sample without the interferent and comparing it to the value obtained from a
test sample to which the potential interferent had been added.
i) Endogenous Substance Interference:
Testing was performed at two CA 15-3 concentrations: 30 ± 6 U/mL and 130 ± 25
U/mL using two lots of Flex® reagents. Test samples were prepared by spiking
the potential interferent into serum. Bias exceeding 10% was considered
interference. Results for hemoglobin, bilirubin and intralipid are summarized
below:

Seven additional endogenous substances, including Uric acid, Urea, Creatinine,
Cholesterol, IgG and serum proteins, were also tested with bias <10%.
ii) Exogenous Substance Interference:
Fifty two exogenous substances were tested for interference including common
over-the-counter drugs and cancer drugs. The substances did not interfere with
the LOCI CA 15-3 method when present in serum and plasma (lithium heparin,
EDTA). Inaccuracies (biases) due to these substances were less than 10% at CA
15-3 concentrations of 30 ± 6 U/mL and 130±25 U/mL.
iii) HAMA interference:
A number of optimized concentrations of HAMA blockers were employed in the
reaction, as well as reagents designed to minimize non specific binding (NSB)
interference. Interference from HAMA was evaluated by testing commercially
available and in-house sera containing HAMA or heterophilic antibodies. Results
from samples to which 10% of a blocker cocktail was added served as controls
and were compared to the same samples without blocker cocktail. The blocker
cocktail consisted of several commercially available HAMA/ heterophilic
blocking substances from multiple vendors. Thirty-six in-house HAMA/NSB
sera and 19 commercial HAMA sera were tested by processing two replicates for
each sample and control. All samples recovered within ± 10% of their controls.
iv) Method Cross-Reactivity:
Interference/ cross-reactivity of cancer marker antigens in the LOCI CA 15-3
assay was tested by spiking the tumor marker antigens into two sera and
comparing the recovery of the spiked sample to control samples spiked with
Phosphate Buffered Saline. No cross-reactivity was observed for the tested
cancer marker antigens.

f. Assay cut-off:
For the Dimension Vista® LOCI CA 15-3 assay, the reference change value (RCV)
was used to determine if a significant change occurred. The RCV is a percentage
change in measured CA 15-3 values when compared to a baseline value. The RCV
takes into account the maximum imprecision of the assay within the reportable range,
the intra-individual biological variation, and the 95% confidence interval (z value for
p<0.05). The RCV was derived by taking into account the published biological
variation; within-subject biological variation (6.2%) was obtained from the literature.
In determining the RCV, the analytical variation used was 7.9% (which is the
reported multi-instrument/ multi-Flex®-lot variability (Multi-Instrument/ Multi-
Flex® lot study) at 35.5 U/mL. The RCV for the Dimension Vista® LOCI CA 15-3
method was calculated to be 27.9%.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The predicate device CA 15-3 Assay for the ADVIA Centaur® System was used
to demonstrate substantial equivalence to the LOCI CA 15-3 Flex® Reagent
Cartridge according to EP9-A2. One serum sample randomly chosen from each
of the 75 female patients who were tested for the monitoring of their disease
status were combined with 248 excess, de-identified serum samples containing
measurable amounts of CA 15-3. Each sample was assayed for the observed
values (323 samples) using the Dimension Vista® CA 15-3 (Y) assay and
compared with the expected values using the Advia Centaur® CA 15-3 (X).
There were no missing responses or invalid results. Samples above the assay
range were re-tested to confirm the results; the repeat tests were not included in
any analysis. Using least squares regression, four (4) statistical outliers were
identified. These 4 samples and 18 samples that were outside the range of the
assay were excluded from the data analysis. Using a Passing Bablok regression,
all results were included in the analysis. CA 15-3 values on the Dimension
Vista® spanned 4.7 - 4814.1 U/mL across the samples tested; values from 4.7 -
264.4 U/mL (301 samples) were included in the analysis.

b. Matrix comparison:
The Dimension Vista Flex Assay for CA 15-3 was evaluated in serum, LiHeparin
plasma, and EDTA plasma.
i) Serum samples were evaluated with matched samples of Lithium Heparin
plasma. The two matrices were evaluated using 68 samples over the
measuring range of the device (linear regression line y=0.98x + 0.4 and
R2=1.000).

3. Clinical studies:
Serial samples from 75 female patients were obtained from a supplier of stored
retrospective samples to the medical device industry. Samples were selected for age
(range 21.8 years old to 75.9 years old), ethnicity and stage of disease (stage 1
through IV). A minimum of 3 serial samples were obtained for each of the 75
patients. Clinical information that details the status of the subject’s disease was
required for inclusion of samples in the study. Changes in CA 15-3 concentrations
and in disease status were analyzed on a per visit basis. Patients were categorized as
Active/Progressive, Responding, Stable, or No Evidence of Disease (NED) by the
attending physician based on the clinical information (medical imaging, physical
examination, and other clinical investigations). All 75 patient sets were analyzed to
determine the change in disease status per sequential pair (n=258). Table below
shows the distribution of results when compared to the disease status

For the Dimension Vista® LOCI CA 15-3 assay, the reference change value (RCV)
was used to determine if a significant change occurred. A change of 21% was
considered to be significant for the predicate method (AVDIA Centaur® CA 15-3
assay). This value was obtained from the manufacturer’s published insert sheet. Per
patient visit clinical performance results for the Dimension Vista® LOCI CA 15-3
test and predicate devices are given in following two tables. In this evaluation,
disease status was classified as “Progression” and “No Progression” with “No
Progression” consisting of responding, stable, and no evidence of disease. Using a
cut-off of >27.9% rise in CA 15-3 value, 66.7% of subject visits (95% confidence
interval 56.3 % - 76.0 %) had a rise in CA 15-3 value when the patient’s disease

status was classified as progression. This value represents the positive percent
agreement of significant CA 15-3 rise with a clinical disease status classified as
progression. Using a cut-off of a >27.9% rise in CA 15-3 value, 79.0% of subject
visits (95% confidence interval 71.9 % - 85.0 %) had no rise in CA 15-3 value when
the patient’s disease status was classified as no progression. This value represents the
negative percent agreement of CA 15-3 rises with a progressive disease status.

4. Clinical cut-off:
Clinical Cut-off is based upon a 27.9% reference change value (RCV). When the
measurement of CA 15-3 varies by >27.9% of the baseline measurement (either
positive or negative) the change is considered significant. The RCV was used to
ensure that the change in CA 15-3 value is not attributed to assay variation or
biological variation. This percent variation represents values within the 95%
confidence interval for real alteration in CA 15-3 values above system noise.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The distribution of CA 15-3 values determined in specimens from patients with
nonmalignant or malignant disease are shown in the two tables below. The
distribution of CA 15-3 values was determined in specimens from healthy individuals
(n = 350; 150 males and 200 females) and from patients with nonmalignant or
malignant diseases. From apparently healthy adult females (age 18-64 years), 99.0 %
of 200 samples had CA 15-3 levels of less than or equal to 35 U/mL. Each laboratory
should establish its own expected values for CA 15-3 as performed on the Dimension
Vista® System. Expected values of CA 15-3 measurements are dependent upon the
individual patient’s baseline reading for CA 15-3. Decreases from baseline value of
27.9% or more in subsequent repeated measurements are indicative of response to
therapy or remission. Increases of 27.9% or more suggest no response to therapy and
are weakly correlated with progression of disease. Estimation and empirical
distributions of CA 15-3 values in various populations of subjects was performed.
The distribution of CA 15-3 values in 350 apparently healthy individuals, 200
patients with nonmalignant and 398 patients with malignant disease is shown in the
tables below.
