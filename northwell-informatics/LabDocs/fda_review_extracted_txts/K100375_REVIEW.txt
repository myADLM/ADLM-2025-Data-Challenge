L. Test Principle:
The LOCI CA19-9 method is a homogeneous, sandwich chemiluminescent
immunoassay based on LOCI® technology. The LOCI® reagents include two
synthetic bead reagents and a biotinylated anti-CA 19-9 monoclonal antibody 116-
NS-19-9 fragment. The first bead reagent (Chemibeads) is coated with an anti-CA 19-
9 monoclonal antibody (1116-NS-19-9) and contains a chemiluminescent dye. The
second bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with streptavidin and contains a
photosensitizer dye. Sample is incubated with biotinylated antibody and Chemibeads
to form bead-CA 19-9-biotinylated antibody sandwiches. Sensibeads are added and
bind to the biotin to form bead-pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of the complex
at 680 nm generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads which diffuses into the
Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is
measured at 612 nm and is a direct function of the CA 19-9 concentration in the
sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
i) Assay-Precision testing for the CA 19-9 method was performed over
twenty days according to CLSI/NCCLS EP5-A2. Data from 2 Flex® lots,
2 calibrator lots and 2 Dimension Vista® 1500 model instruments are
included. The test samples consisted of three levels of Bio-Rad Liquichek
Tumor Marker control, three serum pools and one to two plasma pools
depending on the study site. Two of the serum samples and one of the
plasma pools (Lithium heparin) were spiked with CA19-9 antigen. On

each day of testing, each sample was run in duplicate, in two separate runs
(N=80). The duplicates were run with two separate sample cups. One site
used instrument 41 and reagent lot 09260AD. The second site used
instrument 190 and reagent lot 09198AC.
The range of samples tested encompassed the analytical measuring range.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the data consistent
with the recommendations of EP5-A2. This experiment allowed a
determination of within-run precision (repeatability), within-day, between
days, between runs (within lab) precision for each site and a determination
of between site precision.

Data was collected for twenty days, one run per day, two replicates per run, on three separate instruments,
using three different calibrator lots on each instrument.
The data was merged to form one data set for analysis and a variance component analysis using the REML
method was performed.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
i) The linear range was determined according to CLSI EP06-A. Based on
the results of this testing and that from the Limit of Detection Study, the
analytical measuring range was established in serum.
A study covering the whole assay range was performed using two natural
serum samples. One sample with a low concentration (3.9 U/mL) and one
with a high concentration (1198.3 U/mL), were mixed in varying
proportions distributed over the measurement range. Each dilution was
tested 5 times. Dimension Vista Flex assay data showed good correlation
(R2>0.999) to sample concentration when evaluated using a weighted
linear regression model. It was linear over the measured range, showing
little constant or proportional bias, with linear regression analysis giving

y=1.026x +0.9
Additional patient samples within the assay range with CA 19-9
concentrations of 188 U/mL and 102 U/mL were diluted to evaluate low
end linearity. Based upon measuring 5 replicates of the 188 U/mL sample
diluted with water, the data provide a linear regression line of
y=1.026x+1.1 and R2=0.997 with 95% CI for the slope of 1.006 to 1.046
and for the intercept of -0.1 to 2.2.
ii) Spiking and Dilutional Recovery Studies
a. Spiking Recovery: Known amounts of CA19-9, approximately 37, 73,
165, 620 and 970 U/mL, were added to serum samples with baseline
CA19-9 values of 6.7 U/mL or 49.3 U/mL) and to plasma samples with
baseline CA19-9 values of 2.8 U/mL (EDTA) or 3.3 U/mL (LiHeparin).
The CA19-9 concentrations were measured and the percent recovery
ranged from 92-114.3% for serum, 91.8-105.8 for EDTA plasma, and
99.3-115.5% for LiHeparin plasma. The highest biases in recovered
values for LiHeparin Plasma were observed for measurements near the
cut-off value.

iii) High Dose Hook Effect: Specimens were prepared by diluting two high
CA19-9 human serum patient sample with deionized water to
concentrations ranging from 95 to 1,230,509.5 U/mL for 1 sample and
89.1-1,152,955.2 U/mL for the second. The samples represented a large
measurement range. The specimens were tested with one lot each of flex
reagents on two different Vista instruments. No hook effect was observed
for CA19-9 concentrations up to 1,230,509.5 U/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i) Traceability
There is no recognized standard for CA19-9.
ii) Calibrator
The Dimension Vista® LOCI 7 Calibrator (KC605) is a frozen multi-
analyte liquid containing Cancer Antigen19-9 purified from human colon
adenocarcinoma tissue culture in 6% bovine albumin with buffer and
preservatives. There are five levels (A-E) with target values of 0, 30, 131,
525 and 1050 U/mL.
a) Value assignment
An anchor pool of purified CA19-9 is prepared and a value is assigned
by comparing to patient samples assayed by the predicate device. The
anchor pool is then diluted into a series of 5 Master pools whose
values are determined on the Dimension Vista® system. The Master
pool materials are then aliquoted into the commercial product whose
values are confirmed using the Dimension Vista® System. The 5-
level calibrators are then used to calibrate the Flex CA19-9 method.
b) Stability
Frozen liquid calibrator stability is 12 months from the date of
manufacture when stored unopened at -20ºC. Thawed liquid calibrator
stability is 30 days when stored unopened at 2-8ºC. Once the vial stopper
is punctured, the assigned calibrator values are stable for 30 days on
board the Dimension Vista System. LOCI 7 calibrators should not be used
on board the instrument once the cap is removed. One lot of control
calibrator (reference material stored at -70ºC) and three production lots of
calibrator were tested. The acceptance criterion was <5% deviation from
reference concentration for levels B-E.
iii) Kit Stability
Shelf-life stability (expiration) dating assignment at commercialization
reflects the real time stability data on file at Siemens Healthcare
Diagnostics.
d. Detection limit:
Limits of blank (LOB) and limit of detection (LOD) were determined using 2 kit
lots on 2 instruments (one per lot) using CLSI protocol EP17-A. Five low CA19-
9 samples were tested using two lots on two Vista instruments. CA19-9 values in
tested blank samples ranged from approximately -1.2 to 1.6 U/mL and standard
deviation (SD) of 0.634. Samples with CA19-9 values ranging from 0.1.4 to 4.6
9

--- Page 10 ---
U/mL were used to estimate the limit of detection. Acceptance criteria for the
LOB, LOD, and limit of quantitation (LOQ) were described as follows:
LOB – highest measurement result which has a 95% probability to be observed
for a blank sample. It is the 95th percentile of a blank distribution. Where
blank values are negative, this is estimated as 1.645 x SD of blank values.
The data generated here give LoB=1.645x 0.589=0.968 which was
rounded to LoB=1.0 U/mL.
LOD – lowest amount of analyte that can be detected with 95% probability,
though not quantified at an exact value. LoD=LoB+ SD x Cp or 1.00 +
0.589 x 1.653=1.974 which was rounded to LoD=2.0 U/mL
LOQ – lowest actual amount of analyte that can be reliably detected and at
which total error meets lab requirements for accuracy. LOQ was not
claimed for the Dimension Vista CA19-9 assay.
The results are noted to support a claim for LOB of less than 1.0 U/mL and
of LOD of less than 2.0 U/mL. Therefore, the lowest value for the range of
the assay is 2.0 U/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed according to CLSI/NCCLS EP7-A2 to
determine the effect of various endogenous and exogenous substances on the
Dimension Vista® CA19-9 assays. For all interferents the percent bias was
determined by testing a control serum sample without the interferent and
compared to the value obtained from a test sample to which the potential
interferent had been added.
i) Endogenous Substance Interference
Testing was performed at two CA19-9 concentrations: 40 U/mL and 110
U/mL with two lots of Flex® reagents. Bias exceeding 10% is considered
interference. Results for hemoglobin, triglyceride, bilirubin and intralipid
are summarized below:

ii) Exogenous Substance Interference
62 exogenous substances were tested for interference including common
over-the-counter drugs and cancer drugs. All recorded biases were less than
the 10% acceptance criteria.
iii) HAMA interference
A number of optimized concentrations of HAMA blockers are employed
in the reaction, as well as reagents designed to minimize non-specific
binding (NSB) interference. Interference from HAMA was evaluated by
testing commercially available sera (three replicates) containing up to
327.1 mg/mL HAMA. All of the CA19-9 results from the 10 samples
evaluated were within 10% of control values or showed <1 U/mL
difference from control.
iv) Method Cross-Reactivity
Five tumor-marker proteins were added to two human serum samples
containing 38 or 100 U/mL CA19-9.
Bias (%) Bias (%)

PSA 100 μg/L 100 μg/L 1.4% 0.4%
f. Assay cut-off:
For the Dimension Vista® LOCI CA 19-9 assay, the reference change value
(RCV) was used to determine if a significant change occurred. The RCV was
chosen to ensure that the change in CA19-9 value is not attributed to assay
variation or normal biological variation. The RCV value also considers a z
value for significant change (p,0.05), so that assay results that change by more
than the RCV should be within the 95% confidence interval of significant
changes in CA19-9 levels.
The RCV was derived by taking into account the published biological
variation19 and total imprecision for the Dimension Vista® LOCI CA 19-9
assay. In determining the RCV, the analytical variation used was 13.8%
(which is the reported total variability (Within laboratory Total %CV) at 13.9
U/mL). The within-subject biological variation (27.2%) was obtained from the
literature. The RCV for the Dimension Vista® LOCI CA 19-9 method was
calculated to be 84.7%.

combined with 218 excess de-identified serum samples containing measureable
CA19-9. Each sample was assayed for the observed values (293 samples) using
the Dimension Vista® CA 19-9 (Y) assay and compared with the expected values
using the Advia Centaur® CA19-9 (X). The results obtained are presented below
(Passing & Bablock). The equation represents the relationship between the two

b. Matrix comparison: The Dimension Vista Flex Assay for CA19-9 was
evaluated in serum, LiHeparin plasma, and EDTA plasma.
i. Serum samples were evaluated with matched samples of Lithium Heparin
plasma. The two matrices were evaluated with 60 samples over the
measuring range of the device (linear regression line y=1.013x – 1.649
and R2=0.989).
ii. Serum samples were evaluated with matched samples of EDTA plasma.
The two matrices were evaluated with 63 samples over the measuring
range of the device (linear regression line y=0.9754x + 0.4812 and
R2=0.997).
3. Clinical studies:
For the clinical evaluation, thirty eight (38) retrospective and thirty four (34)
prospectively collected serial serum sample sets from pancreatic cancer patients
purchased from two sample banks, were tested. Samples were selected for age
(range 45.4 years old to 69.5 years old), ethnicity and stage of disease (stage 1
through IV). For each patient, at least 3 serum samples were collected during the
course of follow-up surveillance for pancreatic cancer progression. Clinical
information that details the status of the subject’s disease was required for
inclusion of samples in the study.
Changes in CA 19-9 concentrations and in disease status were analyzed on a per
visit basis. Patients were categorized as Active/Progressive, Responding, Stable,
or No Evidence of Disease (NED) by the attending physician based on the clinical
information (medical imaging, physical examination, and other clinical
investigations). All 72 patient sets were analyzed to determine the change in
disease status per sequential pair (n = 189). Table below shows the distribution of
results when compared to the disease status.

For the Dimension Vista® LOCI CA 19-9 assay, the reference change value
(RCV) was used to determine if a significant change occurred. A change of 15%
was considered to be significant for the predicate method (ADVIA Centaur®
CA19-9 assay). This value was obtained from the manufacturer’s published insert
sheet.
Per patient visit clinical performance results for the Dimension Vista® LOCI CA
19-9 test and predicate devices are given in the following two tables. In this
evaluation, disease status was classified as “Progression” and “No Progression”
with “No Progression” consisting of responding, stable, and no evidence of
disease. Using a cut-off of >84.7% rise in CA19-9 value, 19.2% of subject visits
(95% confidence interval 10.9% to 30.1%) had a rise in CA19-9 value when the
patient’s disease status was classified as progression. This value represents the
positive percent agreement of significant CA19-9 rise with a clinical disease
status classified as progression. Using a cut-off of a >84.7% rise in CA19-9
value, 88.8% of subject visits (95% confidence interval 81.6% to 93.6%) had no
rise in CA19-9 value when the patient’s disease status was classified as no
progression. This value represents the negative percent agreement of CA19-9
rises with a progressive disease status.

4. Clinical cut-off:
Clinical Cut-off is based upon a 84.7% reference change value (RCV). When the
measurement of CA19-9 varies by >84.7% of the baseline measurement (either
positive or negative) the change is considered significant. The RCV was used to
ensure that the change in CA19-9 value is not attributed to assay variation or
biological variation. This percent variation represents values within the 95%
confidence interval for real alteration in CA19-9 values above system noise.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The distribution of CA19-9 values was determined in specimens from healthy
individuals (n= 300; males and females) and from patients with nonmalignant or
malignant diseases. 98.7 % of 300 samples from apparently healthy adults (age
45.4 to 69.5 years) had CA19-9 levels less than or equal to 37 U/mL. Each
laboratory should establish its own reference values for healthy patients’ CA19-9
levels as performed on the Dimension Vista® System.
Expected values of CA19-9 measurements are dependent upon the individual
patient’s baseline reading for CA19-9. Decreases from baseline value of 84.7%
or more in subsequent repeated measurements are indicative of response to
therapy or remission. Increases of 84.7% or more suggest no response to therapy
and are weakly correlated with progression of disease.
Estimation and empirical distributions of CA19-9 values in various populations of
subjects was performed. The distribution of CA19-9 values in 300 apparently
healthy individuals, 200 patients with nonmalignant and 398 patients with
malignant disease is shown in the tables below.
