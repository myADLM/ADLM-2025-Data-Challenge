L. Test Principle:
IMMULITE 2000 CMV IgM is a solid-phase, enzyme-labeled chemiluminescent three-
step immunoassay. The solid phase (bead) is coated with inactivated, purified CMV
antigen (strain AD-169 from infected cell lysates). The liquid phase consists of two
reagents: 1) polyclonal goat anti-human IgG antibody in buffer and 2) alkaline
phosphatase (bovine calf intestine) conjugated to polyclonal goat anti-human IgM
antibody in buffer.
In the first cycle, the patient sample and polyclonal goat anti-human IgG antibody are
incubated together without the bead for 30 minutes. During this time, anti-IgG antibodies
block IgG present in the patient’s sample.
In the second cycle, the pretreated sample and polyclonal goat anti-human IgG antibody
are transferred to the second reaction tube. Anti-IgG antibodies block the remaining IgG
from the patient’s sample from binding to the CMV antigen on the bead. During this
time, CMV IgM in the patient sample binds to CMV antigen on the bead. Unbound
sample and reagent are then removed by centrifugal washes.
In the third cycle, the enzyme conjugated polyclonal goat anti-human IgM antibody is
added to the second reaction tube. The enzyme conjugate binds to immobilized IgM to
form the antibody sandwich complex. The unbound enzyme conjugate is removed by
centrifugal washes. Finally, chemiluminescent substrate is added to the reaction tube and
the signal is generated in proportion to the bound enzyme.

External Reproducibility Study: a reproducibility study was conducted at two
external sites and the Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics in-house laboratory.
The study was designed to test serum pools using one kit lot of the
IMMULITE® 2000 CMV IgM assay. Reproducibility was evaluated using
three serum pools with target S/CO ratios in the high nonreactive, cut-off and
medium/high reactive ranges. Two runs were conducted per day over 5 days
(not necessarily consecutive) at each site. Each run included 4 replicates of
each serum pool tested. Reproducibility was conducted at one site with a
different lot than that used at the other two sites. Pooled results across the sites
are provided in the following table:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability, Stability: As there is no internationally recognized standard for
CMV IgM assays, standard industry practice was followed in order to
establish the concentration of the initial CMV IgM Adjustor (calibrator) and
subsequent lots of the adjustor. Stability information is provided and study
plans were evaluated.
Expected values (controls, calibrators): The IMMULITE® 2000 CMV IgM is
a qualitative assay reporting results as reactive, nonreactive and indeterminate,
although the sample to cutoff ratio of a test sample is also reported on the
instrument output. Each kit contains a positive and negative control and the
expected ranges are provided on lot-specific insert sheets.
Calibrators: Each kit contains one vial of CMV IgM Adjustor. The Adjustor is
used to establish the assay cutoff. The cutoff is equal to the average counts per
second (mean cps) of the Adjustor from the most recent adjustment,
multiplied by a curve parameter assigned to and provided with each CMV
IgM kit lot number. The Master Cutoff of the assay was determined from
representative samples to achieve optimal performance for the IMMULITE
assay versus reference methods. Titration of subsequent Adjustor lots is
performed according to in-house procedures that link the new CMV IgM
Adjustor lot to the previous lot and ultimately to the Master Cutoff. This is
done so that if the same patient sample is tested across different kit lots, the
ratio is similar and also the reactive or non-reactive interpretation for a given
sample is the same. The Adjustor is prepared by spiking positive serum into a
negative serum matrix according to established manufacturing procedures.
The calculation itself and the reporting of qualitative results are performed
automatically by the IMMULITE® 2000 analyzer. The recommended
Adjustment Interval is two weeks, i.e., the user should perform the adjustment
process every two weeks the test system is in use, as verified by Siemens in-
house performance testing.
d. Detection limit:
Not Applicable, the test is a qualitative test
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity:
The specificity of the IMMULITE 2000 CMV IgM assay was evaluated for a
number of potential cross reactive agents; antinuclear antibodies (ANA),
syphilis, rheumatoid factor (RF), and IgM antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), rubella virus, Toxoplasma gondii and
varicella zoster virus (VZV). The study was performed using samples
determined to be positive for the specific analytes by approved vendors, using
6

--- Page 7 ---
FDA-cleared assays. The results demonstrated potential cross reactivity with
RF and the number of samples tested for HSV was not sufficient to evaluate
the potential cross reactivity. The results are presented in the table below.
n n Reactive or
Total Indeterminate
Tested
ANA 57 0
EBV 32 0
HSV 3 0
RF 34 2
Rubella 35 0
Syphilis 8 0
Toxo 19 0
VZV 9 0
Interference:
Six serum samples, representing nonreactive, near cutoff, and reactive levels
of CMV IgM were spiked with various levels of hemoglobin, triglycerides,
and bilirubin at known concentrations to simulate various degrees of
hemolysis, lipemia and icterus. Both neat and spiked samples were assayed in
duplicate with the percent recovery of observed versus expected mean results
and change in qualitative interpretation used to determined presence of
interference.
Bilirubin: Presence of bilirubin in concentrations up to 200 mg/L has no effect
on results, within the precision of the assay.
Hemolysis: Presence of hemoglobin in concentrations up to 522 mg/dL has no
effect on results, within the precision of the assay.
Lipemia: Presence of triglycerides in concentrations up to 3,000 mg/dL has no
effect on results, within the precision of the assay.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-off was evaluated using a total of 102 samples. The samples
were assayed with the IMMULITE® CMV IgM assay. The counts (Kcps)
reading from the IMMULITE® 2000 analyzer were compared to the results
obtained with the predicate device. The data were analyzed by a Receiver
Operating Characteristics (ROC) program in order to choose the optimal
cutoff for agreement between IMMULITE® CMV IgM and the predicate

device. The selected cutoff was subsequently verified with use of the first lot
of Adjustor set at the cutoff and compared to qualitative results from predicate
assay. An "indeterminate zone" has been established for the CMV IgM assay
(ratio results between 0.9 and <1.1) where the results cannot be confidently
reported to be reactive or nonreactive.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The assay was compared to a commercially available assay for CMV IgM (Kit
A) on 400 preselected banked samples at the manufacturer’s facility. The
results are presented below.

b. Matrix comparison:
The IMMULITE® 2000 CMV IgM assay is indicated for use with serum or
plasma samples. A matrix comparison study assessed the degree of
equivalence among sample types. Forty matched sets of samples that included
serum (red top), SST (gel barrier), sodium heparin and EDTA tubes were
tested. Ten (10) of the matched sets were further spiked with various levels of
CMV IgM positive serum to obtain values with various reactivity of the
analyte. Testing was done and regression analysis of data indicated
equivalence among sample tube types. The results are summarized below.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Prospective Clinical Study:
The performance of the IMMULITE 2000 CMV IgM assay was evaluated
using a total of 527 serum samples prospectively collected at four U.S. sites
and three commercial suppliers. The samples were collected from individuals
in whom CMV IgM test was required from different target enrollment groups.
Each sample was tested with the IMMULITE 2000 CMV IgM assay and with
a commercially available CMV IgM assay (Kit A) at three US sites, two
external sites and one internal site. The results are presented below.

*Note: The number of positive samples was not sufficient to evaluate the
positive percent agreement with the predicate device.
Retrospective Clinical Study:
Due to the low prevalence of CMV IgM positive individuals the performance
of the IMMULITE 2000 CMV IgM assay was evaluated in 109 retrospective
samples in which the CMV IgM positive status was determined by an FDA
cleared assay. The samples were from a variety of target populations for CMV
IgM testing. Each sample was tested with the IMMULITE 2000 CMV IgM
