The AP‐1000multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of three main products: the
meter, test strip, and control solutions. These products have been designed, tested, and
proven to work together as a system accurate blood glucose test results. Use only
AP‐1000multi test strips and MAJOR control solution with the AP‐1000multi Blood Glucose
Monitoring System.
Both systems (AP-1000 and AP-1000multi) utilize an electrochemical method‐based meter
and dry reagent biosensor (test strips) for blood glucose testing. The size of the current is
proportional to the amount of glucose present in the sample, providing a quantitative
measurement of glucose in fresh whole blood and control solutions. The control solutions
and the test strips were previously cleared under k090389. The systems allow the palm,
forearm, upper arm, calf, and thigh to be used as alternative testing sites.

ISO 15197. In vitro diagnostic test systems. Requirements for blood-glucose monitoring
systems for self-testing in managing diabetes mellitus.
L. Test Principle:
The AP-1000/AP‐1000multi Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems use electrochemical
methodologies. The system quantitatively measures blood glucose levels using an
amperometric method, which involves detecting the current produced from glucose
oxidation. The electrons generated during this reaction are transferred from the blood to the
electrodes. The magnitude of the resultant current is proportional to the concentration of
glucose in the specimen and the signal is converted into a readout displayed on the meter.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Refer to the analytical performance characteristics described in the 510(k) Substantial
Equivalence Determination Decision Summary for k090389 for evaluation of system
accuracy and lay-user performance.
To demonstrate performance of the new device when testing alternative sites, the
sponsor conducted a new user performance evaluation including the following testing
sites: finger, palm, forearm, upper arm, calf, and thigh. One set of performance data
was evaluated since the AP-1000 and AP-1000multi systems use the same test strips
and are identical with the exception of their names and indications for use (single- vs.
multiple-patient use). Results were compared to a reference method (YSI-2300) and
subjected to acceptance criteria described in the ISO 15197 standard.
User Performance Evaluation of Alternative Site Testing:
In the user performance study, 100 subjects measured their own blood glucose on the
AP-1000 glucose monitoring system using samples from the finger and the following
alternative testing sites: palm, forearm, upper arm, calf, and thigh. Healthcare
professionals then tested these samples using the YSI-2300 reference method. The
study was performed with five AP-1000 glucose monitoring systems throughout a
glucose concentration range of 41.5 to 452 mg/dL. The regression statistics and
accuracy data are summarized in tables below.
