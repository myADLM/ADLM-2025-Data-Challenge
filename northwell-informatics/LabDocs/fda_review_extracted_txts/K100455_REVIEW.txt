CLSI EP05-A2, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement
Methods; Approved Guideline.

CLSI EP17-A, Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of
Quantitation.
L. Test Principle:
Human C4 Kit for Use on the SPA PLUSTM test is a single-step immunoturbidimetric test. The
determination of soluble antigen concentration by turbidimetric methods involves the
reaction with specific antiserum to form insoluble complexes. When light is passed through
the suspension formed, a portion of the light is transmitted and focused onto a photodiode
by an optical lens system. The amount of transmitted light is indirectly proportional to the
specific protein concentration (C4) in the test sample. Concentrations are automatically
calculated by reference to a calibration curve stored within the instrument.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision studies were performed following CLSI Evaluation of Precision
Performance of Clinical Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline
(CLSI Document EP5-A2).
The study was performed over 21 working days, with two runs per day. One user
assessed three different samples, High level (towards the upper limit of the
measuring range), Medium level (close to the bottom of the normal range) and Low
level (between 140% and 180% of the lower limit of the measuring range),.using
three different reagent lots on three analyzers.
Results are summarized in the table below:

All within-run, between-run and between day precision coefficients of variation are
below 7%. The total precision for Sample 2 has the highest coefficient of variation
at 7.8%. The total precision %CV for the high level (Sample 1) is 4.7% and 7.5 %
for Sample 3 at the bottom end of the calibration curve. The overall precision is
within the acceptance criteria.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated as per CLSI EP6-A (Evaluation of the Linearity of
Quantitative measurement procedures; A statistical approach; Approved Guideline).
Serum samples (see table) previously identified as containing high levels of C4 and
stored at -20°C were pooled to form a high linearity fluid.
The high pool of samples for the linearity study was diluted in sample diluent
(saline). Saline is the specified SPA PLUSTM instrument system diluent; low pool
samples with undetectable levels of C4 were not available. The diluent does not
correct for matrix effects; this is in accordance with the CLSI EP6-A section 4.3.2 (a
patient-sample pool diluted in the recommended diluent constitutes the second most
desirable situation if a low pool is not available). Dilutions were prepared to cover
the kit measuring range and each dilution was measured three times on three
different kit lots.

The data confirms the linearity of the assay over the measuring range of 0.06 -
1.14g/L at the standard sample dilution (1:10) and 0.008 -0.12g/L the minimum
sample dilution of 1:1 (neat).
The claimed reportable range for C4 is 0.064 – 0.9 g/L for initial 1:10 dilution of
samples that are automatically processed by the instrument. Samples higher than
the initial measuring range will automatically re-dilute using a 1:20 dilution, which
allows samples up to 1.8g/L to be measured.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls and Calibrators
The calibrators and controls are manufactured from ‘pooled human serum’, and
processed to stabilize C4. The control serum samples were traced to European
Reference Material DA 470. The kit C4 calibrators are assigned to an internal
reference (IR) which is directly calibrated to the external reference standard DA470.
For the IR assignment both the IR fluid and DA470 are tested at different dilutions
across the curve (33%, 16.5%, 8.3% and 4.2%). All dilutions are tested in triplicate
using 2 or more different kit batches on the SPA PLUSTM. A second set of dilutions are
made and tested in the same way on a different SPA PLUSTM analyzer. From this
information the IR value is calculated. The IR assignment is verified by testing it
against DA470 in triplicate using all assays that measure C4.
The assayed controls have assigned values with a ±10% in-house tolerance and
target values for the low control and for the high control. The controls are assigned
on calibration curves validated with the internal reference standard which is directly
assigned to the international reference standard DA470. The controls supplied with
each lot are assayed on the kit and information on the values obtained, including the
±15% customer range, are found in the lot specific quality control certificate.
Stability
Three kit lots of C4, with each reagent originating from different batches, were
tested after storage at 22°C for 1 week to simulate shipping conditions. The kits
were tested at Time 0 and 3 months after storage at the recommended temperature
of 2-8°C. At each stage a calibration curve was run together with the two kit
controls and an internal reference (IR) standard.

The control and internal reference results obtained were well within the acceptable
control result range of ±15% of the assigned value (±8.5% at time 0), showing
stability of the Kits reagents for at least 3 months from the date of manufacture
when stored at the recommended storage temperature of 2-8°C.
On-Board stability tests were performed by storing vials 'on-board' the SPA PLUSTM
for a period of at least 30 days. Open vial Stability were tested by storing reagents
in open vials for 3 months at 2 - 8°C. The results obtained from Low and High
Controls were within ±15% of the assigned value.
d. Detection limit:
CLSI EPI7-A (Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of
Quantitation, Approved Guideline) were employed for determining limit of
detection. A blank, the lowest level calibrator and a sample with a known C4
concentration, diluted to give a value just greater than the blank, were tested 60
times on the SPA PLUSTM analyzer. The standard deviation (SD) and the percentage
coefficient of variation (%CV) were calculated in each case. The 60 blank
absorbance readings gave a mean value of 0.0106 absorbance units with an SD of
0.0005 units.
The limit of quantitation (LoQ): The limit of quantitation for the assay was the
lowest point of the calibration curve; LoQ was assigned a value of 0.006 g/L based
upon a 1/1 sample dilution. Below LoQ point, samples are flagged as below the
measurable range, and no concentration value is calculated
The limit of blank (LoB): The limit of blank was estimated as the mean of blank +
2 SD using the blank as a zero calibrator. The LoB was derived from the mean of
the blank +2 SD = 0.0106 + (0.0005 x 2) = 0.0116 abs units giving an estimated
value of 0.0003g/L.

The limit of detection (LoD): The limit of detection was estimated as the lowest
measurable analyte level that can be distinguished from zero. The very low level
sample (diluted sample) gave a mean value of 0.018 absorbance units giving an
estimated value of 0.003g/L which is considered to be the LoD.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity with other complement components:
The IEP and ouchterlony tests were performed against deep frozen normal human
serum to demonstrate absence of any significant cross reaction with other
complement components including major split products and other subunits (C1q
etc.). Western blots analysis was used to demonstrate the absence of cross-
reactivity to C3 and C3-components like C3a, iC3b, C3c and C3dg. Results showed
the sheep anti-human C4 serum specifically binds to human C4.
Interference – endogenous substances
Susceptibility to interference was assessed by adding a high concentration of a
potential interferent to a test sample containing known concentrations of C4. The
method used to check for chyle, a mixture of biological lymph and chylomicrons
(lipids and proteins), and hemoglobin was based on the Interference Check A plus™
(Sysmex, Japan). In the same way bilirubin interference was assessed by adding a
high concentration of bilirubin to a test serum sample and comparing it to a blank.
Percentage interference was calculated from comparison with the sample blank.
Deviations less than or equal to ±10% of the blank value were considered to show
'no significant interference'.

No significant interference was seen when high concentrations of hemoglobin (5

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison between Binding Site's C4 SPA PLUSTM assays to the already
510k-cleared Tina-Quant complement C4 Test system (k953239 Roche Diagnostics
Corp.) was done by using 101 retrospective human serum samples. The clinical
samples were collected and stored at -80°C in order to preserve the complement
levels as much as possible. No validation data is available to support these storage
conditions. Thirty one normal samples and 70 clinical samples were tested on
SPA PLUS™ and Roche/Hitachi Modular P analyzer C4 kit. Kit controls were included
with each assay run. The samples were fairly distributed over the measuring range.
