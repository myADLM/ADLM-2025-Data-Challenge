Peak analysis and Calculation
AFP-L3%: The μTASWako AFP-L3 assay is a system with all reagents in a single cartridge
and each assay performed in a single, disposable “chip” using microfluidic electrophoretic
separation. After placing sample, reagent cartridge, wash solution and chip cassette on the
instrument, the buffers, antibody solutions and sample are automatically dispensed into
appropriate chip wells. The sample and Dye-Fab’ solution are dispensed and form the
primary immunocomplex (Dye-Fab’ – AFP) in the well. Each solution is loaded into the
microfluidic channel by vacuum. Voltage is applied to the chip and DNA-Fab’ moves to
anode and is concentrated. The concentrated DNA-Fab’ reacts with the primary
immunocomplex and forms the secondary immunocomplex (Dye-Fab’ – AFP – DNA-Fab’).
The secondary immunocomplex is further concentrated during isotachophoresis to the anode
and is thereby separated from unbound Dye-Fab’. The concentrated secondary
immunocomplexes of L3 and L1 are separated from unbound Dye-Fab’ and from each other
by electrophoresis into a matrix containing LCA. The LCA effects the separation of L1 and
6

L3 by binding to L3 and altering its mobility. The two populations of Dye-Fab’-labeled AFP
are detected by laser-induced fluorescence. The concentration of L1 and L3 is proportional
to the fluorescence. All reactions, separations, and detection occur on a microfluidic chip.
DCP: The μTASWako DCP assay is a system with all reagents in a single cartridge and each
assay performed on a single, disposable “chip” using microfluidic electrophoretic separation.
After placing sample, reagent cartridge, wash solution and chip cassette in the instrument, the
buffers, antibody solutions and sample are automatically dispensed into appropriate chip
wells. The sample and Dye-Fab’ solution are dispensed and form the primary
immunocomplex (Dye-Fab’ – DCP) in the well. Each solution is loaded into the microfluidic
channel by vacuum. Voltage is applied to the chip and DNA-Fab’ moves to anode and is
concentrated by isotachophoresis. The concentrated DNA-Fab’ reacts with the primary
immunocomplex and forms the secondary immunocomplex (Dye-Fab’ – DCP – DNA-Fab’).
The secondary immunocomplex is further concentrated during to the anode and is thereby
separated from unbound Dye-Fab’. The concentrated secondary immunocomplexes are
separated from unbound Dye-Fab’ by capillary gel electrophoresis. The Dye-Fab’-labeled
DCP is detected by laser-induced fluorescence. The concentration is proportional to the
fluorescence. All reactions, separations and detection occur on a microfluidic chip.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
i) Precision AFP-L3%: Precision was performed using 4 samples made from
purified AFP-L1 and AFP-L3 spiked into pooled serum and two levels of controls
prepared with AFP-L1 and AFP-L3 spiked into phosphate buffer with BSA
(Samples 1-4). An additional set of 3 pooled serum samples without spiking
using concentrations near the cut-off, were also evaluated (samples 5, 6 and 7).
Each sample was measured for 21 days, 2 runs per day, and 2 replicates per run.
Sample concentrations ranged from 8.8 to 947.5 ng/mL. Acceptance criteria were
within 10% for all samples. The results of total %CVfor each sample ranged

between instruments, one reagent lot, one calibrator set and one control lot were
used.
AFP-L3%: Two levels of controls were prepared with purified AFP-L1 and
AFP-L3 spiked into phosphate buffer plus BSA and measured in 4 replicates on
24 instruments. The pre-defined acceptance criteria of ≤ 10% for all samples
were met. The % CV for Control L and Control H of Total AFP was 2.4% and
2.7%, respectively, and the % CV for Control L and Control H of AFP-L3% was
1.6% and 2.3%, respectively.
DCP: Two levels of controls were prepared with purified DCP spiked into
phosphate buffer plus BSA and measured in 4 replicates on 24 instruments. The
pre-defined acceptance criteria of ≤ 10% for all samples were met. The % CV for
Control L and Control H of DCP was 5.6% and 4.9%, respectively.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
AFP-L3%: The claimed assay measuring range is 0.3 to 1000 ng/mL.
Total AFP: One reagent lot and two calibrator lots were used for this study. For the
linearity study of Total AFP, six samples were prepared with purified analytes spiked
into either Sample Dilution Buffer (SDB; Sample 1) or into pooled serum (samples 2-
6). These 6 samples were sequentially diluted into SDB to obtain 6 independent
dilution series ranging from 0-1300 ng/mL. Each of these 6 dilution series yielded up
to 11 points analyzed in duplicate with constant AFP-L3% value. Predefined
acceptance criteria were 15% for Total AFP ≥ 2 ng/mL and for AFP-l3% (0-100%).
AFP-L3%: One reagent lot and two calibrator lots were used for this study. Three
concentrations were prepared with purified AFP-L1 or AFP-L3 and spiked into SDB
(approximately 20, 200 and 900 ng/mL). Then, mixtures of these concentrations in
various ratios were made in order to obtain three AFP-L3% sample dilution series
(AFP-L3 / AFP-L1 + AFP-L3) ranging from 0 to 100%. Each of these dilution series
yielded eleven points analyzed in duplicate with constant Total AFP concentration.

--- Page 11 ---
The pre-defined acceptance criteria for the absolute difference (ng/mL) was set
“within 0.3 ng/mL” for concentrations <2 ng/mL of Total AFP and within 15% for
concentrations ≥ 2ng/mL of Total AFP. Linearity was evaluated using a linear
regression analysis of each individual dilution series. Recovery ranged between
93.2% and 104.8% for Total AFP and between 94.2% and 113% for AFP-L3%.

DCP: The claimed measuring range is 0.1 to 950 ng/mL. One reagent lot, and one
calibrator set lot were used for this study. Six sample series was created from pooled
serum spiked with DCP at different concentrations. Each sample was then diluted
with a negative sample mixture to form a dilution series spanning the measuring
range 0.53 to 1396 ng/mL (11 dilutions in duplicate per sample). The predefined
acceptance criteria for the recovery of DCP was set within 15% for concentrations ≥ 1
ng/mL and within 20% for concentrations < 1 ng/mL. Linearity was evaluated using
linear regression analysis of each individual sample series. Recovery ranged between
92.2% and 109.1%.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: AFP levels in the calibrator are traceable to the 1st international standard
for alpha-fetoprotein from NIBSC. The DCP reference standard is the Wako 1st DCP
standard.
To support labeling with 12 month shelf life when stored at 2-10°C, testing was
carried out at 0, 3, 6, 7, 9, 12 and 13 months. Samples spanning the measuring range
were used to determine the stability based on three tests: fluorescence intensity,
accuracy, and reproducibility across the time points. Pre-specified criteria were met.
AFP-L3%: Stability data supported a 12 month shelf life for assay reagents,
calibrators and controls when opened once and stored at 11°C. Calibration is stable
for 4 weeks after a reagent is placed on the i30 instrument. Opened reagents can be
13

--- Page 14 ---
used for 30 days on the μTASWako i30.
Calibration is required when reagent cartridge is opened. Calibration curve is
automatically produced in the μTASWako i30 by plotting fluorescence intensity of
the immunocomplex peak area vs. AFP concentrations of the calibrators. The
calibration curve is stable for 30 days.
DCP: Stability data supported a 13 month shelf life for assay reagents, 12 months for
calibrators and controls when opened once and stored at 11°C. Calibration is stable
for 4 weeks after a reagent is placed on the i30 instrument. Opened reagents can be
used for 30 days on the μTASWako i30.
d. Detection limit AFP-L1, AFP-L3, and DCP:
Limit of Blank (LoB): One sample was prepared with bovine serum albumin spiked
into phosphate buffer and measured 60 times. The LoB was determined as the 95th
percentile of the non-Gaussian distribution of the data: AFP-L1 and AFP-L3 = 0.00
ng/mL; DCP = 0.027 ng/mL.
Limit of Detection (LoD): Four low level samples were prepared using a human
serum sample diluted sequentially with sample dilution buffer spiked into phosphate
buffer and bovine serum albumin. Each sample was measured 15 times for a total of
60 measurements. A total of 24 measurements were obtained by using 2 reagent lots
and 2 instruments. Measurements were carried out for 5 days. The following LoDs
were obtained: AFP-L1 = 0.030 ng/mL; AFP-L3 = 0.028 ng/mL; DCP = 0.042
ng/mL.
Limit of Quantification (LoQ): The measurement results used for calculating the LoD
were used. Total Error (= Bias +2SDs as described in Section 5.1 of CLSI EP17-A)
for AFP-L1 and AFP-L3 and DCP were calculated. Since the Total error was less
than the defined error, the LoQ was determined to be the same as the LoD. The LoQ
was determined to be 0.30 ng/mL and 0.28 ng/mL for AFP-L1 and AFP-L3,
respectively. DCP = 0.42 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference AFP-L3%: Interference was evaluated using pooled serum samples
spiked with purified AFP-L1 and AFP-L3 so that the final Total AFP concentration
was ~ 20 ng/mL and AFP-L3% was ~ 10%. Five or six different concentrations of
interferent were evaluated in duplicate. The concentrations of interferent and the
range of recovery are shown below.

(without interferent and with approximately 6 ng/mL DCP) was prepared with
purified DCP spiked into pooled serum. Secondly, another sample “Serum B” (with
interferent) was prepared with the maximum concentration of interferent spiked into
an aliquot of the Serum A. Then Serum A and Serum B were mixed in various ratios
in order to obtain five to six concentrations of interferents for each series. The %
recovery of all samples ranged from 86.8 to 109.2% for DCP.

High dose hook effect
AFP-L3%: For the evaluation of high dose effect for the AFP-L3 assay, one very
high native human serum sample (1, 272, 000 ng/mL of total AFP) was used. The
sample was diluted sequentially with pooled native human serum to obtain nine
samples. Each was measured in triplicate. No high dose effect was seen.
DCP: For the evaluation of high does effect of DCO, one very high concentration of
sample (23,000 ng/mL of DCP) was prepared with DCP spiked into pooled serum.
The sample was sequentially diluted with pooled serum to obtain 10 samples. Each
was measured in triplicate. No high dose effect was seen.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
AFP-L3%:
Method comparison studies were conducted to compare performance between the
μTASWako AFP-L3%, and Total AFP, and the predicate LiBASys AFP-L3%, and
Total AFP. Samples were obtained from the original studies used in the evaluation of
the LiBASys system performance, as well as an additional 40 spiked samples to cover
the reportable range. A sample collection protocol was used to select samples
without bias. The 200 sample represented 2 blood draws from 100 patients, 25 from
each of the 4 groups evaluated in the original study: (1) Patients previously diagnosed
with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), (2) developed HCC during the study with
lesions at least 0.5 cm in diameter, (3) suspected of possible HCC with lesions at least
0.3 cm in diameter and high total AFP results, and (4) did not have HCC but had a
complete workup. Measurements were carried out in singlicate and Deming
regression analysis was performed. (r2 calculated from least squares regression).
There were 6 outliers deleted from the analysis. Further analysis determined the
original samples were false positives in the original LiBASys analysis due to
interference and that the μTASWako i30 results were correct. For the Total AFP
sample values outside the measuring range were excluded.

DCP:
A method comparison study was conducted to demonstrate equivalent performance
between the μTASWako DCP assay and the predicate LiBASys system. A total of
220 samples were evaluated; 200 samples were from the original LiBASys study and
an additional 20 spiked samples to cover the reportable range. The four patient
categories were: HCC at onset of the study, patients who developed confirmed HCC
during the study, patients who were “suspicious” of possibly having HCC and
patients who did not have HCC. The 25 patients in each group, 100 patients in total,
2 samples from each patient, were collected from 441 patients by a process designed
to select without bias. First, the entire samples were divided into 4 groups. Secondly,
the samples in each group were divided into site where collected approximately half
number of the patient samples and other sites. The samples were selected alternately

AFP-L3%. For the calculation of relative risk (RR), the original 437 samples used to
determine RR in the original submission were tested on the μTASWako i30.
Relative Risk was calculated using group 2 and 4. The following table summarizes
the distribution of patients with AFP-L3% ≥ 10 and those with AFP-L3% < 10 in
these groups for the μTASWako i30 system and the previous results obtained on the
predicate LiBASys test system:
μTASWako i30:
LiBASys:
Groups 2 and 4 Only Risk (95% CI) Risk (95% CI)
μTAS Wako i30 LiBASys
Relative Risk 10.6 (5.4 to 20.6) 7.0 (4.1 to 12.0)
Risk of HCC given AFP-L3% 43.3% (31.4 to 48.8 (33.4 to 64.1)
positive 55.1)
Risk of HCC given AFP-L3% 4.1 % (1.6 to 6.6) 7.0 (4.0 to 10.0)
negative
The patients categorized as “Suspicious” were treated as a separate group because no
definitive diagnosis could be obtained from physicians and therefore was not included
in the above risk calculation. To consider the possibility of spectrum bias by
excluding this Group from the risk analysis, the following tables showed the worst
case and best case scenarios to determine the effect of this group in risk estimation:
Best case: Risk (95% CI) Risk (95% CI)

The results showed that the μTASWako i30 has a greater sensitivity while the
LiBASys has slightly higher specificity.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Same as assay cut-off.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Expected value range for AFP in healthy adults is 0.1 to 5.8 ng/mL according
to published literature (Masseyeff R., et al. N. Engl. J. Med. 291 (1974), 532).
Normal reference value for AFP-L3% is not detectable.
In normal subjects, DCP is not detectable but can be found in patients who are vitamin K
deficient or taking vitamin K antagonists such as Warfarin.
N. Instrument Name:
μTASWako i30 Fully Automated Immunoanalyzer
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The μTASWako i30 system employs Liquid-phase Binding Assay (LBA) as the assay
principle, which relies on liquid-phase binding reactions between antibody and antigen.
The assay is performed in five steps:
Step 1: A liquid-phase binding reaction where a ternary immunocomplex is formed
between an Anionic conjugate (antibody conjugated to an anionic polymer such as
DNA), a fluorescent conjugate (antibody conjugated with fluorescent dye) and the target
analyte.
Step 2: An isotachophoresis (ITP) stacking step where the ternary immunocomplex is
migrated to the anode and concentrated.
Step 3: The mode of operation is switched from ITP to zone electrophoresis.
Step 4: Zone electrophoresis is applied to separate the immunocomplex from
contaminants. If lectin is added to the separation medium, the glycol-isoforms of analytes
can be resolved.
Step 5: A detection step where the immunocomplex labeled with fluorescent dye is
measured by Laser-Induced Fluorescence.

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types: Yes
2. Specimen Identification:
The μTASWako i30 system can be used with eight different types of blood collection
tubes or sample cups. Barcode labels are placed onto specified areas of blood collection
tubes. If the barcode is placed into an incorrect area, the barcode data cannot be read, and
an error message will be generated. There is functionality in the system to order
operations manually if necessary.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
If there is insufficient sample, the system will not be able to aspirate the sample and will
generate an error message. Each sample rack contains an identifying number. STAT
samples can be run by interrupting the normal operations. When the STAT operation is
completed, the analyzer will restart the interrupted standard operation automatically.
4. Calibration:
There are two methods of calibration, automatic and manual:
a) Automatic calibration: any non-calibrated bottles will be automatically calibrated.
The system can identify reagents that have not yet been calibrated.
b) Manual calibration: any particular reagent bottle can be manually calibrated by
selecting that particular bottle.
Calibration can be done using either barcoded or non-barcoded calibrators. After
calibrations are properly completed, the calibration curve factors are printed out. Past
calibration results can be checked.
5. Quality Control: QC operations can be performed automatically on barcoded control
samples. QC operations can also be performed manually by selecting the control reagent
bottles from the menu. The analyzer can display past QC data. The Acceptable Range
for Quality Control needs to be set for every new lot of controls.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Cross-over contamination: The possibility of cross-over contamination for the instrument
was evaluated using one very high concentration of serum sample (137,000 ng/mL of Total
AFP and 9750 ng/mL DCP) was prepared. Blank samples were measured after the serum
sample. The results indicate no evidence of carry over contamination.
Sample stability: Samples from the original clinical submission were used to support the
substantial equivalence of the μTASWako i30 assays to the predicate. In order to ensure that
storage conditions did not impact the assay values submitted for the subject device, a total of
200 samples were re-evaluated on the LiBASys predicate instrument and compared to the
original values. Deming regression analysis of the data was conducted.
