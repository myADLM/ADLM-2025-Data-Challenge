E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
DxH™ 300 and DxH™ 300C COULTER® Cellular Analysis Analyzers are
intended for In Vitro Diagnostic Use in clinical laboratories. The DxH 300C has
the capability to process samples in an open and close vial mode of operation; the
DxH 300 only operates in an open vial mode. The DxH 300 Systems provide
automated complete blood count and leukocyte differentials.
The instrument system is comprised of the analyzer and a suite of analytical
reagents that allow for simultaneous quantitative determination of hematological
parameters through the use of impedance and colorimetric method. Additional
reagents provide system cleaning and quality control and calibration.
The system has two counting modes, whole blood and predilute mode. The
difference in the two modes is the amount of sample aspirated and the amount of
reagents added for the final dilution to be analyzed. The aspiration pathway and
testing principle are the same.
2. Principles of Operation:
The DxH 300 Systems use the Coulter principle of impedance along with a
colorimetric method for hemoglobin to determine quantitative and qualitative
measurements of biological and physical properties of cells. The Coulter principle
accurately counts and sizes cells by detecting and measuring changes in electrical
resistance when a particle (such as a cell) in a conductive liquid passes through a
small aperture. Each cell suspended in a conductive liquid (diluent) acts as an
insulator. As each cell goes through the aperture it momentarily increases the
resistance of the electrical path between two submerged electrodes, one located on
either side of the aperture. This causes an electrical pulse that can be counted and
sized. For counting, the vacuum used to pull the diluted suspension of cells
through the aperture must be at a regulated volume. While the number of pulses
indicates particle count, the size of the electrical pulse is proportional to the cell
volume.
3. Modes of Operation:
DxH™ 300 only operates in an open vial mode.
1

DxH™ 300C operates in an open and closed vial mode of operation.
4. Specimen Identification:
Patient sample ID (manual entry) and auto-numbering (auto-sequencing) or
optional Bar-Code Scanner
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The specimen is mixed by inversion and run in the either whole-blood or the
predilute mode.
6. Calibration:
Calibration and verification of calibration with the use of COULTER S-CAL
calibrator and COULTER LIN-X Linearity Control respectively, are performed
based on the performance of the quality control program, and according to
laboratory procedures and local or national regulations.
7. Quality Control:
Beckman Coulter recommends that quality control checks be performed using
commercial controls at intervals established by the laboratory or as required by
laboratory accreditation, licensing, or regulatory agencies.
Three levels of varying component concentrations (Abnormal Low, Abnormal
High, and Normal) of the Coulter 4C-EX 300 Cell Control are offered.
8. Software:
The software is used to operate the system which features sample management,
sample processing, data acquisition, data processing, result management, patient
data management, and instrument management. The system is comprised of the
DxH 300 analyzer (Closed Vial configuration or Open Vial configuration) with
touch screen and an electronic keyboard. The software system consists of a Main
Control Processor component (including algorithm), Application Processor
component (including data management), Print Processor and CD Burning
Processor.

To demonstrate sample results are repeatable at both the upper and lower
ends of the device’s measuring range, concentrations that span a
significant portion of the measuring range were selected inclusive of
representative samples within the medical decision levels. Repeatability
was evaluated based on ten consecutive runs (n=10) for each sample for a
total of 5780 runs. Repeatability was estimated as the coefficient of
variation (CV%) or the standard deviation (SD) of the ten runs. The values
of CV% and SD for each sample were within specifications.
c. Linearity:
WBC and Platelet linearity were performed using dilutions prepared from
WBC monologs and Platelet analogs respectively. RBC and Hemoglobin
linearity were performed using dilutions prepared from fresh whole blood.
The whole blood was concentrated to obtain specimens to test the high
linearity limit. Serial dilutions using the whole blood plasma for RBC and
Hemoglobin and 4C media for WBC and Platelet were then prepared to
create 10 subsequent dilutions. The mean of multiple measurements, 5
(five), from each of the 10 dilutions across the linearity range were used.
Acceptable performance is indicated by the data fitting a linear regression
line with a coefficient of determination (R²) of >0.95 and the parameters
measured recovering within the bias limits. Based on CLSI EP06-A, the
DxH 300 systems demonstrated acceptable linearity results.
Summary of the recovered linearity specification and the R2 values for
each parameter are displayed in the table below.

d. Carryover:
Carryover was determined for WBC, RBC, Hemoglobin and Platelet.
Testing was performed in the analytical cycle combinations of within
mode for whole blood, within mode for predilute and mode to mode.
For each analytical cycle combination, triplicate sampling from a patient
whole blood with extremely elevated blood components (high sample)
was followed by triplicate blank samples (diluent) regarded as background
level or zero carry-over with each test performed three times.
For whole blood and predilute sampling, within mode and mode to mode
for sampling carryover were calculated for both the DxH 300 and DxH
300C and results were within specifications (≤ 0.5) for WBC, RBC and
Hemoglobin and (≤ 1.0) for Platelets.
e. Interfering Substances:
The accuracy studies performed on the DxH 300 and DxH 300C included
samples with the known interfering substances listed in the table below.
Parameter flagging was observed when the interference impacted the
results. Samples that did not flag achieved the accurate results for each
parameter when compared to the reference.
Interfering Substances

2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
Based on CLSI H3-A6, Procedures for the Collection of Diagnostic Blood
Specimens by Venipuncture; Approved Standard-Sixth Edition, studies were
designed and conducted to support claims and attributes for whole blood
sampling. They were designed to evaluate the following:
a. Comparison of Venous and Capillary Blood:
Specimens were collected from normal donors by capillary method
according to the manufacturers recommended volume and venous
collection tube in a 50/50 mix of K2 and K3 EDTA anticoagulants. One
replicate of each specimen was analyzed due to volume constraints (when
possible, two replicates were analyzed). This testing demonstrated venous
blood presented in a standard collection tube when compared to venous

blood presented in a micro collection device, the performance
characteristics of the two specimen types are comparable.
b. Comparison of Open and Closed vial sampling:
Specimens from normal donors were analyzed cap-off in open vial
sampling mode and compared to cap on from the closed vial sampling
mode results on the DxH 300C. Samples were collected in K3 EDTA
anticoagulant and analyzed in duplicate. The testing demonstrated that the
DxH 300C will process the specimen in the same manner regardless of the
method of sample presentation.
c. Comparison of Whole Blood Mode and Predilute Mode:
Specimens from normal donors collected in a 50/50 mix of K2 and K3
EDTA anticoagulants were processed in both modes and analyzed in
duplicate. The predilute sample was prepared by the user dispensing
0.38ml of diluent from the analyzer into an empty tube or receptacle and
adding 20 μL of whole blood then mixing the blood/diluent mixture
consistent with the instructions for use provided in the proposed labeling.
The testing demonstrated that the DxH 300 and DxH 300C analyzers will
process the specimen in the same manner regardless of the method of
sampling mode.
d. Sample Stability and Storage:
Whole blood and Pre-dilute whole blood stability studies were performed.
Specimens were collected in a 50/50 mix of K2 EDTA and K3 EDTA
anticoagulants with stability measured using non-flagged, morphologically
normal samples. Ten donors were analyzed in duplicate for each study.
When samples are stored for the durations defined at controlled room
temperature [64-79° F (18-26° C)] or at refrigerated temperature [35.6-
46.4° F (2-8° C)] the instrument results met the acceptance criteria. Whole
blood stability is 24 hours at refrigerated temperature and 12 hours at
room temperature. Pre-dilute whole blood stability is 30 minutes for CBC
parameters and 10 minutes for Differential parameters.
e. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity: The results of studies from 3 sites
were combined. The clinical sensitivity and specificity for the DxH 300
Systems and the AcT Diff 2 predicate instrument as compared with the
manual differential for the same population of samples is shown below.

f. Reference Range
A study was conducted to assess the Adult Reference Ranges for the both
DxH 300 and DxH 300C systems using whole blood samples collected
from 246 donors from the Beckman Coulter in-house blood donor
program. In the study 121 male donors between the ages of 20-73 years
old and 125 female donors between the ages of 19-73 were included. The
non-parametric method and 95% confidence were used to calculate the
lower and upper limits of the reference range with the priori direct
sampling technique utilized.
It is recommended that laboratories establish their own ranges based on
their current patient population.
K. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
L. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
