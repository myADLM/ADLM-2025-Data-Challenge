I. Device Description:
The kit contains
• a divisible microplate consisting of 12 modules of 8 wells each, with coated
Fc fragments of highly purified human Immunoglobulin G.
• 5 vials, (1.5 mL each) of calibrators (with human IgG for RF IgG, or IgM for
RF IgM, or IgA for RF IgA, or combined calibrator with IgG, IgM and IgA
for the RF Total) class rheumatoid factor antibodies (AE) in a serum/buffer
matrix containing: 0; 15; 50; 150; 500 U/mL.
• 2 vials, (1.5 mL each) Rheumatoid factor positive and negative controls in a
serum/buffer matrix.
• 1 vial, (20 mL, 5x concentration) of Sample buffer.
• Antibody is provided as 1 vial, (15 mL) Enzyme conjugate solution (PBS,
Proclin 300 <0.5% (v/v)), (light red) containing polyclonal rabbit anti-human
antibody; labelled with horseradish peroxidase.
• TMB substrate solution, 1 vial, (15 mL)
• Stop solution (contains hydrochloric acid), 1 vial, (15 mL)
• Wash solution (1 vial, 20 mL)
Components containing human serum were tested and found negative for HBsAg,
HCV, HIV1 and HIV2 by FDA approved methods. No test can guarantee the absence
of HBsAg, HCV, HIV1 or HIV2, and so all human serum based reagents in this kit
must be handled as though capable of transmitting infection.
Some kit components (i.e. Controls, Sample buffer and Buffered Wash Solution)
contain Sodium Azide as preservative. Sodium Azide (NaN3) is highly toxic and
reactive in pure form. Despite the classification as non-hazardous, at the provided
concentration of 0.9%, it is strongly recommended prudent laboratory practices be
used.

L. Test Principle:
Rheumatoid Factor IgA/IgG/IgM/RF Total is an indirect solid phase enzyme
immunoassay (ELISA). Fc fragments of highly purified human Immunoglobulin G
are bound to microwells. Antibodies against this antigen, if present in diluted serum
or plasma, bind to the respective antigen. Washing of the microwells removes
unspecific serum and plasma components. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated
anti-human IgG (for RF IgG), or anti-human IgA (for RF IgA), or anti-human IgM
(for RF IgM), or containing all 3 anti-human IgG, anti-human IgA, anti-human IgM
(for RF Total) immunologically detects the bound patient antibodies forming a
conjugate/antibody/antigen complex. Washing of the microwells removes unbound
conjugate. An enzyme substrate in the presence of bound conjugate hydrolyzes to
form a blue colour. The addition of an acid stops the reaction forming a yellow end-
product.
The intensity of this yellow colour is measured photometrically at 450 nm. The
amount of colour is directly proportional to the concentration of antibodies present in
the original sample.
M. Performance Characteristics):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Inter-Assay, Inter-Lot and Intra-Assay reproducibility studies were performed for
ORGENTEC RF IgG, IgA, IgM and RF Total assays. Coefficients of variation
(CV) were calculated for each of ten samples from the results of 20
determinations in a single run for Intra-Assay precision. Run-to-run precision
was calculated from the results of 20 different runs with double determinations of
each sample. Inter-Lot precision was calculated from the results of three different
kit lots with double determinations using seven samples. Results are shown in the
below tables.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
For each of the assays, namely, ORGENTEC RF IgG, IgA, IgM and RF Total
assays, a series of three patient samples containing high levels of antibody
were serially diluted in buffer from 1:1.2 up to 1:128 to demonstrate the upper
end of linearity and throughout the dynamic range of the assay.
From these dilutions, the concentration of the samples was calculated from
Calibrator curves. Claimed range for RF IgG is 3.4 U/mL to 500 U/m; for RF
IgA is 2.5 U/mL to 500 U/mL; for RF IgM is .2.0 U/mL to 500 U/mL and for
RF Total is 3.0 to 500 U/mL.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators: The external calibrators (standards) are a series of four patient
samples that were diluted in buffer from 1:2 to 1:32. Kit Calibrators are
calibrated against WHO International Reference Preparation Rheumatoid
Arthritis Serum 64/2, 1st Brit. Std., established 1965 for IgM, IgA and IgG.
Stability of open kit calibrators and controls is at least 30 days when stored at
2-8 °C.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank:
IgG:
Limit of Blank - LoB
Sample Buffer was diluted and measured 40 times on one plate.
Calibrators and Controls were analyzed in duplicate. The detection limit was
calculated as the (mean + 3 SD) was 0.025 OD for the Sample Buffer, which
corresponded to an analytical sensitivity of 0.6 U/mL.
Limit of Quantitation - LoQ
Functional sensitivity was determined from the coefficient of variation of four
very low serum samples run in replicates of 16 in three assay runs. The
lowest concentration which could be measured with a coefficient of variation
below 20% is 5.9 U/mL
IgA:
Limit of Blank - LoB
Sample Buffer was diluted according to instructions for use and measured 40
times on one plate. Calibrators and Controls were analyzed in duplicate. The
detection limit was calculated as the mean + 3 SD was 0.026 OD for the
Sample Buffer, which corresponded to an analytical sensitivity of 0.1 U/mL.
Limit of Quantitation - LoQ

Functional sensitivity was determined from the coefficient of variation of four
very low serum samples run in replicates of 16 in three assay runs. The
lowest concentration which could be measured with a coefficient of variation
below 20% is 3.2 U/mL
RF Total:
Limit of Blank - LOB
Sample Buffer was diluted according to instructions for use and measured 20
times on one plate. Calibrators and Controls were analyzed in duplicate. The
detection limit was calculated as the mean + 3 SD was 0.024 OD for the
Sample Buffer, which corresponded to an analytical sensitivity of 0.4 U/mL.
Limit of Quantitation - LOQ
Functional sensitivity was determined from the coefficient of variation of four
very low serum samples run in replicates of 16 in three assay runs. The
lowest concentration which could be measured with a coefficient of variation
below 20% is 8.4 U/mL
e. Analytical specificity:
Interferences studies for IgG, IgA and IgM:
Interference due to unconjugated bilirubin, hemolysis and lipemia (Glycerl
Trioleate) was evaluated using a negative serum, a low positive serum and a
high positive serum spiked with the respective interfering substance in
increasing concentrations. Hemolysis up to 1000 mg/dL, bilirubin up to 40
mg/dL, and lipemia (i.e. triglyceride concentration) up to 3000 mg/dL in
human serum do not interfere with RF IgG or IgA or IgM or the combined RF
Total ELISA results.
Potentially cross-reacting diseases: A series of 68 samples obtained from adult
and juvenile patients diagnosed with various other arthritic and autoimmune
disease conditions were collected from hospitals sent for routine testing.
These 68 samples were tested in the Orgentec Rheumatoid Factor IgG or IgA
or IgM or RF Total assay to identify RF positivity in these populations.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
233 patient samples were analyzed on an Orgentec RF ELISA and compared
to a corresponding commercially available RF IgG or IgA or IgM ELISA.
The quantitative results were calculated from a calibration curve on the basis
of tested calibrators. Following are the tabulated results of percent positive
and negative agreement between Orgentec RF assay and the predicate Hycor
RF assay for each of the Immunoglobulins – IgG, IgA and IgM.
For the Orgentec RF Total assay, 233 samples were compared to
commercially available (Hycor) RF IgG, IgA and IgM ELISA assays. The
results are tabulated below.

b. Matrix comparison:
In order to demonstrate that the test system gives the same results for serum,
separate tubes of Na-heparin plasma, citrate plasma and EDTA plasma were
drawn from the same patient and tested in the various RF Ig assays (G/A/M)
and RF Total antibody test. Thirteen samples ranging from serum
concentrations 12. 5 U/mL to 350 U/mL were tested. Acceptance criteria for
this study were that the percent deviation between serum and plasma results
should not be greater than ±25 %. The slopes and R2 values obtained are
tabulated below.

3. Clinical studies:
Studies were performed to establish the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the
Orgentec RF Assays, which detect RF IgG, RF IgA, and RF IgM in serum and
plasma samples. The clinical sensitivity and specificity were calculated by
comparing the Orgentec RF Ig Assay result interpretations to the clinical
diagnosis of RA patients, presumptive normal samples and patients with other
diseases both autoimmune and non-autoimmune. The available clinical diagnosis
for the RA patients was defined by ACR criteria.
Four hundred and seventy-one (471) sera were tested by the ORGENTEC RF IgG
or IgA or IgM or 469 samples by the ORGENTEC RF Total ELISA to determine
clinical diagnostic agreement. Based on clinical diagnosis, the following tables
list the results of patients seropositive or negative for IgG, or IgA or IgM or RF
Total with the calculated clinical diagnostic sensitivity and specificity values
respectively.

4. Clinical cut-off:
Rheumatoid Factor IgG, IgA and IgM ≥ 20 U/mL
Rheumatoid Factor Total ≥ 25 U/mL
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The cut-off was determined by measuring a total of 200 samples, for each of the
IgG, IgM, IgA and RF Total assays, from apparently healthy blood donors equally
distributed by sex and age from blood banks and hospital labs.
The mean concentration plus 3 S.D. of RF IgG antibodies was 7.7 U/mL, and a 3
S.D. and 98 percentile values of 17.2 U/mL. Three patients were positive yielding

a 1% positive rate. This is consistent with published rates for a normal
population.
The mean concentration of RF IgM antibodies plus 3 S.D. and 98 percentile
values of 15.9 U/mL. One patient was positive yielding a 0.5% positive rate.
The mean concentration plus 3 S.D and 98 percentile values of RF IgA were 13.9
U/mL and 15.4 U/mL respectively.
Based on these results the cut-off for IgG, IgM and IgA was determined to be ≥20
U/mL.
The mean concentration of RF Total antibodies was 11.3 U/mL and mean plus 3
S.D. and 98 percentile values were 23.0 U/mL and 21.0 U/mL respectively. Two
patients were positive yielding a 1% positive rate. Based on these results the cut-
off for RF Total was determined to be ≥ 25 U/mL
