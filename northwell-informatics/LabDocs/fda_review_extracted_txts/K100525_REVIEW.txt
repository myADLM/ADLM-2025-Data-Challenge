L. Test Principle:
For Glucose PAP SL reagent, gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide (H O ) are
2 2
formed when glucose oxidase enzymatically oxidizes glucose. H O reacts with 4-
2 2
aminoantipyrine (4-AAP) and phenol under the catalytic action of peroxidase to form
a colored quinoneimine. The absorbance of the quinoneimine at 505 nanometers is
proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Glucose PAP SL reagent: Within-run and Total precision results were
obtained by performing two runs per day, two measures per run, on sera at
low, medium and high concentrations on the Vital Scientific Selectra Junior
Analyzer during twenty days according to CLSI protocol EP5-A2. The results
are presented in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
For Glucose PAP SL reagent, a linearity study was performed using ten
samples ranging from 18.0 to 400 mg/dL, which were prepared by dilution of
spiked high and low combination serum samples. All samples were assayed in
triplicate. Data was analyzed using 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order least square
regressions according to CLSI Protocol EP6-A. The sponsor selected a first
order model since it demonstrated linearity; 1st order: y = x + 2e-13, r2 = 0.999.
Based on the data, the sponsor claimed a linearity range from 20.0 to 400.0
mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Control material was purchased from commercial available sources. Elitrol I
and II control solutions are value assigned using two Vital Scientific Flexor
Junior Analyzers. Each sample is tested in triplicate over several days. The
target value of Level I and II are the median of the observed values range (n
=36). After validation of the target value, a confidence range (high and low
values) is calculated. The sponsor claimed an open vial stability of 12 hours at
15 to 25oC, 5 days at 2 to 8oC or 4 weeks at -15 to -25oC.
Calibrator material was purchased from commercial available sources. Elical
2 calibrator is value assigned using multiple runs on two Vital Scientific
Flexor Junior Analyzers. The target value of Elical 2 calibrator is the mean of
the observed values range (n = 42). After validation of the target value, a
confidence range (high and low values) is calculated. The sponsor claimed an
open vial stability of 8 hours at 15 to 25oC, 2 days at 2 to 8oC or 4 weeks at -
15 to -25oC.
Real-time and on-board stability studies for the Glucose PAP SL reagent were
conducted. The sponsor claims a shelf life of 27 months and on-board stability
of 28 days.
d. Detection limit:
For Glucose PAP SL reagent, a detection limit study was evaluated according
to CLSI EP17-A guideline. The limit of blank (LoB) was determined by
running a blank sample 60 times on the Vital Scientific Selectra Junior
analyzer. The limit of detection (LoD) was determined by 15 measurements of
four low analyte samples (~0.30 mg/dL) on the Selectra Junior analyzer. Limit
of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined by 15 measurements of four analyte
samples (~10 mg/dL) on the Selectra Junior analyzer. Based on the data, the
sponsor claimed the following LoB, LoD and LoQ.
