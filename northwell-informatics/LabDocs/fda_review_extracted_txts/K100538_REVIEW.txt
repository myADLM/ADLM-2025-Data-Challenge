L. Test Principle:
Tina-Quant Ferritin Assay is an immunoturbidimetric test for the quantitative
determination of ferritin in human serum and plasma. During the reaction, anti-
ferritin antibodies coupled with latex microparticles react with ferritin in the sample
to form an antigen-antibody complex. Following agglutination, the precipitate is
measured turbidimetrically. Ferritin concentration is proportional to the amount of
turbidity formed.

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
i. Hitachi 917: Precision study was performed on Hitachi 917 using two
controls and five pooled serum samples. Two controls were prepared with
Precinorm Protein (PNP) and Precipath Protein (PPP) at 128 ng/mL and
332 ng/mL, respectively. The pooled serum samples were prepared at the
following levels: 8.48 ng/mL, 25.5 ng/mL, 235 ng/mL, 618.6 ng/mL, and
820 ng/mL. Samples were tested in duplicate, twice a day for 21 days on
Rochi/Hitachi 917, yielding 84 observations for each sample. Results
were acceptable within Roche’s assay specification.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
i. Hitachi 917: To determine the linearity, the dilution series were prepared
using the high concentration levels of human serum patient samples. The
diluted samples covered the concentration range of 0-1229 ng/mL. Each
dilution was tested in triplicate. The results were pooled for the regression
analyses. The reagent was determined to be linear for the claimed
measuring range for Hitachi 917, i.e., 5 - 1000 ng/mL. The provided
regression equations are as follows:

ii. Hitachi 902: A similar protocol was used to prepare the sample for testing
the linearity on Hitachi 902. The concentrations of diluted samples were
ranging from 0 - 1385 ng/mL. The provided regression equations are as
follows:
Passing-Bablok:

The final claimed reportable range for Hitachi 902 is 5 - 800 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Tina-Quant Ferritin Gen. 4 assay has been standardized against the Roche
Elecsys Ferritin Assay which is traceable to WHO reference materials IS
94/572, 80/578, 80/602. The recommended controls and calibrator for use
have been previously cleared. The calibrator, C.f.a.s. Proteins, was cleared in
k080607. The controls, Precinorm Protein and Precipath Protein were cleared
in k012371.
The real time and on-board stability studies were done on Roche/Hitachi 917.
Three lots and two controls were tested in triplicate. For real time stability,
data were collected at point 0, 6 months, 13 months, 19 months, and 25
months at 2-8°C. The reagent was stable up to 25 months. For on-board
stability, data were collected after being stressed for 5 days at 35°C and then
at 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks at 5-15°C. The reagents were stable up to 12
weeks opened and refrigerated on the analyzer.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) of the Tina-Quant
Ferritin Gen. 4 were determined on Roche/Hitachi 917 in accordance with the
CLSI EP17-A requirements. For LoB, one analyte free sample was analyzed
in five-fold determinations on two Roche/Hitachi analyzer systems over three
days, two runs per day, for a total of N=60 determinations. Two lots of
reagent were used for testing. For LoD, five human serum samples with low
analyte concentration were analyzed in one-fold determination on two
Roche/Hitachi analyzers over three days, two runs per day. Two lots of
reagents were used for testing. For LoQ, five human serum samples with
concentration ranging from 3.20 ng/mL to 9.65 ng/mL were tested once per
day, for 10 days. The LoQ was determined as the lowest analyte
concentration that can be reproducibly measured with a between-run %CV ≤
20%. The LoB is 3 ng/mL, LoD is 5 ng/mL, and LoQ is 7 ng/mL.

e. Analytical specificity:
i. Endogenous interference: Effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence
of endogenous interfering substances using the Tina-Quant Ferritin Gen. 4
assay was determined by using two levels (33.2-37.4 µg/L and 163-192
µg/L) of pooled human serum samples spiked with varying levels of
interferent, including bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated),
hemoglobin, lipemia, and rheumatoid factors. The resulting samples
series (ten levels of interferent per sample) were tested in triplicate and the
mean values were used to calculate recovery. The provided acceptance
criteria for this assay were: within ±4 ng/mL for sample ≤40 ng/mL or
within ±10% from sample >40 ng/mL. No significant interference was
noted for samples containing less than: Bilirubin (conjugated and
unconjugated bilirubin) (60 mg/dL); hemoglobin (500 mg/dL); Lipemia
(Intralipid) (1000 mg/dL on Roche/Hitachi 917, 800 mg/dL on
Roche/Hitachi 902); and rheumatoid factors (1200 IU/mL).
ii. Drug interferences: Eighteen commonly used drugs were added to native
patient samples (see table below) and examined for potential interference
on ferritin determination by the Tina-Quant Ferritin Gen. 4 test system.
Significant interference was defined as ±10% deviation from the reference
value. No significant interference was found at therapeutic concentrations
of tested drugs.

iii. Hook effect: The possibility of a high-dose hook effect was examined for
the Tina-Quant Ferritin Gen. 4 assay using two human serum samples
spiked to a theoretical concentration of 100,000 ng/mL. The dilution
series were prepared using saline and analyzed. The Hook limit
concentration is the maximal concentration giving a signal above the
Hook decision limit. No hook effect was detected up to 80,000 ng/mL.
