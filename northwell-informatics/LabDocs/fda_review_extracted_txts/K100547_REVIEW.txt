All performance was evaluated on the Vital Scientific Selectra Junior Analyzer
which is also trademarked as the Vital Scientific Flexor Junior Analyzer.
I. Device Description:
The ELITech Clinical Systems HbA1c reagent is available only as a kit that
consists of 3 reagents: Reagent R1 is ready to use and contains suspended latex
particles (0.13%) in a buffer with stabilizers and sodium azide (<0.1%); Reagent
R2a and Reagent R2b are mixed to prepare a working reagent, Reagent 2. This
mixture contains mouse anti-human HbA1c monoclonal antibody and goat anti-
mouse IgG polyclonal antibody in a buffer containing stabilizers and sodium
azide (<0.1%); Reagent R3 is a ready to use hemolysis reagent in an aqueous
solution containing a stabilizer and sodium azide (<0.1%).
The ELITech Clinical Systems HbA1c Calibrators Set consists of 4 levels of
calibrators (Cal 1, Cal 2, Cal 3, Cal 4) containing approximately 5.0%, 7.9%,
10.9%, and 13.7% HbA1c. Each level consists of lyophilized hemolysates
prepared from human erythrocytes to yield 0.5 mL each after reconstitution.
The ELITech Clinical Systems HbA1c Control L+H is a 2 level quality control
product consisting of lyophilized hemolysates prepared form human erythrocytes
containing HbA1c levels of 4.1-6.1% and 10.2-13.2 %.
The calibrators and controls are listed in the reagent labeling as required but not
provided.
The following is included in the labeling for both the calibrators and controls: All
human material should be considered as potentially infectious. All products
derived from blood are prepared exclusively from the blood of donors tested
individually by FDA-approved methods and found to be negative for HbsAg and
antibodies to HCV and HIV1/HIV2. However, as no test method can rule out the
potential risk of infection with absolute certainty, handle cautiously as potentially
infectious.

L. Test Principle:
The ELITech Clinical Systems HbA1c assay is an immuno-turbidimetry methodology
enhanced by latex particles using a two-reagent reaction sequence.
1st reaction: The sample is mixed with reagent R1. Total hemoglobin and HbA1c
have the same absorption affinity for these particles, the %HbA1c present in the
sample is proportional to latex-bound HbA1c.
2nd reaction: Addition of the working Reagent R2 leads to agglutination complexes,
formed from the interaction between latex-bound HbA1c and the corresponding

latex-bound HbA1c and therefore is proportional to the %HbA1c in the samples. A
non-linear calibration curve is used to obtain the %HbA1c.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed precision studies in accordance with the CLSI EP5-A2
(Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods;
Approved Guideline – Second Edition) guideline. Three levels of human
patient sample pools (whole blood collected on EDTA) at a low, medium and
high level of HbA1c were analyzed in duplicate with 2 runs per day over 20
days on the Vital Scientific Selectra Junior analyzer. The results are presented
in the table below:
Sample N Mean Within Run Total Imprecision
(% A1c) SD %CV SD %CV
Low Level 80 4.4 0.05 1.1 0.10 2.3
Medium Level 80 6.7 0.06 0.9 0.13 1.9
High Level 80 9.5 0.10 1.0 0.28 2.9
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity across the assay range was assessed by testing two levels of
marketed whole blood based control samples at low (2.3%) and high (16%)
HbA1c concentrations. Ten test samples with equidistant concentrations were
prepared by mixing the two level samples. Each sample was tested in
triplicate on the Vital Scientific Selectra Junior analyzer. Data was analyzed
using 1st, 2nd and 3rd order least square regression analysis in accordance with
the CLSI EP6-A (Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measuring
Procedures: A Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline) guideline. The
difference in predicted values between the first and second order models are
as follows:
1st order: y = 1.53x + 1.10
2nd order: y= -0.04x2 + 1.94x + 0.29
The sponsor chose the 2nd order regression because it is significant and the
results are shown in the table below:

a: Percentage not calculated since the acceptance for very low concentration is
given in units (+/- 0.4% HbA1c standardized against NGSP/DCCT reference
method).
Based on the data, the sponsor claimed that the assay’s linearity range is 2.5 to
16.0% HbA1c.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The sponsor supplied a “Certificate of Traceability” from the National
Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) demonstrating that the
ELITech Clinical Systems HbA1c assay on the Vital Scientific Selectra Junior
with ELITech Clinical Systems HbA1c Calibrators (Cal 1, Cal 2, Cal 3, Cal 4)
has met NGSP requirements. The NGSP certification requires annual
renewal. The current list of NGSP certified methods is available on the
following website: http://www.ngsp.org/prog/index.html

Systems HbA1c assay and the Vital Scientific Selectra/Flexor Junior
Analyzer. The mean values are used to assess the adequacy of recovery. The
observed mean must be within the target range provided on the commercial
product.
ELITech Clinical Systems HbA1c Control L+H target ranges included in the
labeling are those provided by commercial vendor. SEPPIM verifies the
target ranges through their own Quality control procedure by testing in
triplicate using the ELITech Clinical Systems HbA1c assay and the Vital
Scientific Selectra/Flexor Junior. The mean values are used to assess the
adequacy of recovery. The observed mean must be within the target range
provided on the commercial product.
Stability
Calibrator material (Cal 1, Cal 2, Cal 3, Cal 4) is purchased from a
commercial vendor (previously cleared under k033501). The sponsor claims
that when stored at 2-8°C and protected from light, the calibrators, prior to
reconstitution, are stable until the expiration date printed on the label. After
reconstitution, the calibrators are stable for 30 days when stored at 2-8°C.
The labeling states that the open vials should be stored tightly capped and
should not be frozen.
Control material (Control L+H) is purchased from a commercial vendor
(previously cleared under k041227). The sponsor claims that when stored at
2-8°C and protected from light, the calibrators, prior to reconstitution, are
stable until the expiration date printed on the label. After reconstitution, the
calibrators are stable for 30 days when stored at 2-8°C. The labeling states
that the open vials should be stored tightly capped and should not be frozen.
On-board stability for the ELITech Clinical Systems HbA1c assay was
established by real time studies on the Vital Scientific Selectra/Flexor Junior
and demonstrated on-board reagent stability of 14 days. The ELITech
Clinical Systems HbA1c is stable until the expiration date printed on the label
when stored at 2 to 8°C.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor performed a limit of detection (LoD) study according to the CLSI
EP-17-A guideline. The limit of the blank (LoB) was determined by analyzing
a blank sample 60 times on a Vital Scientific Selectra Junior Analyzer. The
results demonstrated that the LoB is 0.6%. The LoD was determined by
analyzing 4 low level HbA1c diluted samples (2.4%) 15 times each on a Vital
Scientific Selectra/Flexor Junior analyzer. The LoD of 0.7% was determined
using the median minus the 5th percentile plus the LoB value.
The claimed measuring range, 2.5% to 16% HbA1c, is based on the linearity
study summarized in M.1.b above.

e. Analytical specificity:
Studies were performed to assess common or known substances that could
interfere with the ELITech Clinical Systems HbA1c Reagent on the Vital
Scientific Selectra Junior analyzer. Two patient blood sample pools with 7.0%
and 10% HbA1c were spiked with multiple concentrations of potential
interfering substances. Samples containing various concentrations of potential
interferents were tested and the results compared to those obtained from
control samples containing no potential interferent. The percent difference
between the control sample and the sample spiked with the potential
interferent was no greater than +/-10% for concentrations at or below those
listed in the following table:
Potential interfering Concentration at which no
substance significant interference
(≤10%) was observed
Bilirubin (conjugated) ≤29.5 mg/dL
Bilirubin (unconjugated) ≤30 mg/dL
Triglyceride ≤2035 mg/dL
Acetylsalicylic acid(Aspirin) ≤200 mg/dL
Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) ≤20.0 mg/dL
Rheumatoid Factor ≤1008 IU/mL
Hemoglobin Variants HbS, HbC, HbD, HbE, HbF and HbA2:
Potential cross-reactivity to hemoglobin variants was examined using patient
samples containing known concentrations of HbA1c and the variants (HbS,
HbC, HbD, HbE, HbF and HbA2). Each sample was tested in duplicate, and
the difference between the known concentration (from the European Primary
Reference laboratory, a member of the NGSP network) and the values
obtained with the candidate assay on the Vital Scientific Selectra/Flexor
Junior were calculated.
No significant bias of greater than ±10% was observed in the presence of
HbS, HbC, HbD, HbE or HbA2.
Samples with HbF concentrations >9% demonstrated significant bias
(>±10%). The labeling states that high concentrations of HbF up to 9%
showed no significant interference. The presence of 20% HbF produced a
negative bias of -21.5%.
Carbamylated, Acetylated and Labile HbA1c:
Pooled patient blood samples with HbA1c concentrations of 6% and 9.0%
were spiked with sodium cyanate (used to carbamylate), aspirin (used to
acetylate) and glucose (labile HbA1c). Samples were measured in triplicate
