The intensity of the quinone imine dye produced in the reaction is directly
proportional to the cholesterol concentration when measured at 600 nm.
Direct LDL-Cholesterol:
The assay consists of 2 distinct reaction steps:
1. Elimination of chylomicron, VLDL-Cholesterol and HDL-Cholesterol by
cholesterol esterase, cholesterol oxidase and subsequently catalase.
2. Specific measurement of LDL-Cholesterol after release of LDL Cholesterol by
detergents in Reagent 2.
The intensity of quinone imine dye produced in the reaction is directly proportional to
the cholesterol concentration when measured at 600 nm.
Cholesterol:
The cholesterol is determined after enzymatic hydrolysis and oxidation. The indicator
quinoneimine is formed from hydrogen peroxide and 4-aminoantipyrine in the
presence of phenol and peroxidase.
Triglyceride:
The triglycerides are determined after enzymatic hydrolysis with lipases. The
indicator is a quinoneimine formed from hydrogen-peroxide, 4-aminophenazone and
4-chlorophenol under the catalytic influence of peroxidase.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed at three levels of each test on two separate
instruments over 10 days. Samples were tested in duplicate twice a day with n
= 80 for each level tested for each analyte.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of each analyte on the Poly-Chem 90 system was tested by
mixing human serum with human serum containing the analyte to several
levels of the test to obtain 7 concentration levels for each analyte (HDL
cholesterol 5 -115 mg/dL; LDL cholesterol 1.7 to 883 mg/dL; Cholesterol 7-
716 mg/dL; Triglycerides 5 - 1049 mg/dL). Recoveries ranged from 94.6 to
108.7% for Direct HDL; from 90.1 to 104.2 % for Direct LDL; from 97.2 to
108.9 % for Cholesterol and from 96.2 to 105.4 % for Triglycerides. The
summary of linear regression analysis of data is given in the table below.
The linearity studies support the sponsor’s claimed measuring ranges as
follows:
Direct HDL: 5 -115 mg/dL
Direct LDL: 9.2 – 883 mg/dL
Cholesterol: 8 – 716 mg/dL
Triglyceride: 5 -1049 mg/dL
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The tests are traceable through the appropriate recommended calibrator to the
Reference material/methods listed in the table below:

The calibrators and controls are not included with the reagent kits, however
the labeling recommends using Polymedco Calibration Serum (k955489),
Polymedco Lipid Control for Direct HDL and LDL cholesterol (k022591) and
Polymedco Assayed Multisera for Cholesterol and Triglycerides (k942458),
which are sold separately. The calibrator set points and control ranges are
provided for the Poly-Chem 90 analyzer.
The reagent systems have not been tested or certified by the Cholesterol
Reference Method Laboratory Network (CRMLN). The labeling for Direct
HDL, Direct LDL and Cholesterol contains language that the reagent systems
have not been tested or certified by the CRMLN.

Five serum samples containing very low levels of the analyte (serum samples
diluted with 0.9% saline) were tested in replicates of three over four days. The
results were evaluated to determine the limit of detection for the assay.

e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor conducted interference studies to evaluate the interference from
hemoglobin, bilirubin, triglyceride and ascorbic acid for Direct HDL-
cholesterol, Direct LDL-cholesterol and Cholesterol. Interference studies for
triglyceride tested hemoglobin, bilirubin and ascorbic acid. Samples
containing 2 levels of each analyte were used to spike the interfering
substances at different concentrations to evaluate the bias in reference to the
unspiked samples. Following are the levels of analyte in the un-spiked
samples:
