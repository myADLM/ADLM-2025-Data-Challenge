H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
MRSASelect™ is a selective and differential chromogenic medium for the
qualitative detection of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) from
skin and soft-tissue wound specimens. The medium is indicated for use in
conjunction with other laboratory tests and clinical data available to aid in the
identification and diagnosis of MRSA from patients with skin and soft-tissue
infections. Concomitant cultures and susceptibility testing are necessary for all
skin and soft-tissue wound specimens. MRSASelect™ is not intended to guide, or
monitor treatment for MRSA infection, or provides results of susceptibility to
methicillin. Results can be interpreted after 18 to 28 hours incubation.
2. Indication(s) for use:

skin and soft-tissue wound specimens. The medium is indicated for use in
conjunction with other laboratory tests and clinical data available to aid in the
identification and diagnosis of MRSA from patients with skin and soft-tissue
infections. Concomitant cultures and susceptibility testing are necessary for all
skin and soft-tissue wound specimens. MRSASelect™ is not intended to guide, or

methicillin. Results can be interpreted after 18 to 28 hours incubation.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable
I. Device Description:
MRSASelect is a selective and differential chromogenic medium for the qualitative
detection of MRSA from skin and soft-tissue wound specimens. Selective
antifungal/antibiotics mixture is incorporated in the medium to inhibit the growth of
yeasts, Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria except MRSA. Identification is
based on the cleavage of a chromogenic substrate by a specific enzymatic activity of
Staphylococcus aureus, leading to a strong pink coloration of the Staphylococcus

L. Test Principle:
MRSASelect is a selective medium for the detection and direct identification of
MRSA. The selectivity of this medium is based on the presence of an
antibiotic/antifungal mixture and an optimized salt concentration that inhibits the
growth of yeast and the majority of Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria with
the exception of methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Identification is based on the
cleavage of a chromogenic substrate by a specific enzymatic activity of

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility Testing was done at three sites in triplicates for three days
with three lots. The study included two strains each for MRSA, MSSA and S.
epidermidis. S. aureus ATCC 43300 was also tested. It was performed at
concentrations of 106 CFU/mL for MRSA, and 108 CFU/mL for non-MRSA.
Reproducibility was >95%.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Negative Control
S. aureus ATCC 25923 at a concentration of 104 – 105 CFU/plate
Positive Control
S. aureus ATCC 43300 at a concentration of 103 – 104 CFU/plate
Test Strain Expected Results after 24 hours at 35-37°C
S. aureus ATCC 25923 No Growth
S. aureus ATCC 43300 Growth – small pink colonies
QC was performed at each testing site on more than three lots. The testing
followed the recommendations of the QC strains listed in the package insert
and there were no product failures.
d. Detection limit:
The LoD study was performed on two well characterized MRSA strains, at six
serial dilutions, per strain, per dilution, on two MRSASelect plates and by two
operators. The results demonstrated the LoD of 103 CFU/mL.

Analytical reactivity
The study included 102 well characterized MRSA from the Network on
Antimicrobial Resistance in Staph aureus (NARSA) collection, tested at
concentrations 103 -104 CFU/mL. They were USA100, 200, 300, 500, 600,
700, 800, and 1000. The USA300-0114 (NRS 384) was also tested.
Results demonstrated that strains NRS722, 727, and 730 produce white
colonies at 18hrs, but pink colonies at 24 hrs; NRS676, and 745 produce pink
colonies at ≥105 CFU/mL, higher than the LoD of 103 CFU/mL.

Interference Study
The interference study included blood, pus and non-prescription debriding
agents. The debriding agents tested were 1U/g fibrinolysin and 666U/g
desoxyribobnuclease, Papain+urea (1%), and Papain+urea (5%). No

Cross Reactivity Study
There were 35 non-staphylococcal isolates tested at concentration of ≥106
CFU/mL in the SSTI premarket application. No pink colonies observed.
The isolates whose performance resulted in a limitation statement for the
nasal submission was also included in this submission (i.e. faint pink colonies
for some S. epidermidis, pink coloration for some Gram negative rods, and
Acinetobacter); pinpoint white colonies were observed for Corynebacterium
jeikeium and Candida tropicalis.
Mixed infection study
A mixed infection study was performed to demonstrate the performance of the
MRSASelect if mixed infection was encountered in wound or SSTI samples.
S. aureus ATCC43300 at LoD (i.e. 103 CFU/mL), oxacillin resistant S.
epidermidis and K. pneumoniae at increasing concentrations up to 106
CFU/mL each were tested. No interference was observed.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
The MRSASelect™ culture media was evaluated at four clinical sites which
included testing of 943 specimens. All the samples were inoculated directly
onto the following media:
• Trypticase Soy Agar (TSA) with 5% Sheep Blood
• MRSASelect
• Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) with 6.5% NaCl
MRSASelect plates, TSA, and TSB were incubated at 35- 37ºC in ambient air.
Positive TSBs were subcultured to a TSA, and negative TSB were incubated
for a total of 48 hrs. Suspected Staph aureus colonies from TSA were
identified by Gram stain, catalase, Pastorex Staph Plus, and mecA mediated
oxacillin resistance by using cefoxitin (30µg) disk.
Pink colonies of any intensity on MRSASelect between 18- 28 hrs of
incubation indicated the presence of MRSA. The tables below are the
performance summary of the clinical studies:
