Refer to indications for use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Elecsys Troponin I CalCheck 5 is an assayed control for use in calibration
verification and for use in the verification of the assay range established by the
Elecsys Troponin I reagent on the indicated Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay
analyzers.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For in vitro diagnostic use. For prescription use only. The Elecsys Troponin I Cal
Check 5 is not intended to be used as a primary calibrator or routine control
material.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The labeling states that the CalChecks are for use with the Elecsys Troponin I
reagent on the Elecsys 2010/cobas e411 and Modular Analytics E170/cobas e601
test systems.
I. Device Description:
The Elecsys Troponin I CalCheck 5 is a lyophilized product consisting of
recombinant human Troponin I in human serum matrix. During manufacture, the
analyte is spiked into the matrix at the desired concentration levels. CalCheck Level 1
contains no analyte.
Elecsys Troponin I CalCheck Target Value (ng/mL)
Level 1 < 0.3
Level 2 0.8
Level 3 5.0
Level 4 20.0
Level 5 25.0
The human source materials were prepared exclusively from the blood of donors
tested individually and shown to be free from HBsAg and antibodies to HCV and
HIV. The testing methods applied were FDA-approved or cleared in compliance with
the European Directive 98/79/EC, Annex II, List A.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The Troponin I used in the Elecsys Troponin I CalCheck 5 is traceable to an
internal reference material assayed with a commercially available Troponin I
assay. The Elecsys Troponin I CalCheck 5 material is analyzed on the
sponsor’s reference analyzers and recovered values must fall within pre-
determined acceptance criteria.
Expected Values and Value Ranges
Expected values for the Elecsys Troponin I CalCheck 5 are determined by
duplicate analyses of levels 1 to 5 using N ≥ 3 analyzers (i.e. Elecsys 2010,
E170, and cobas e 601). Pre-determined acceptance criteria for Troponin I
recovery must be met for each control lot. The target value for each CalCheck
is the median of the observed values. Troponin I expected values and value
ranges are lot dependent and are listed in the lot-specific value sheet. Test
results must fall within the range printed on the lot-specific value sheet. The
labeling states that laboratories should establish appropriate acceptance
criteria when using this product for its intended use.
Stability
The manufacturer claims CalCheck 5 is stable until the expiration date printed
on the vial when stored unopened at 2-8°C. Accelerated stability testing
supports the target shelf life claim of 18 months. The reconstituted vials are
stable for four hours at 20-25°C.
