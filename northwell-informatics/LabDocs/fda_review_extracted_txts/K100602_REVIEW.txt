b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
.
The sponsor performed linearity studies using adjusted whole blood samples with 9
different lactate concentration ranges from 0.2 to 21 mM. Duplicate measurements
were made with each concentration on 5 meters and three test strip lots. The results
were compared to those obtained using the Nova CCX laboratory analyzer as the
reference measurement. Linear regression analyses for each test strip lot were as
follows:
Lot Numbers Slope Y-Intercept R2
1 0.9937 0.0415 0.997
2 0.9809 0.0588 0.9981
3 0.9909 0.0061 0.9979
The claimed reportable range of the device is 0.7 to 20mM.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Value assignment of the Lactate Control Solution was determined from the mean and
standard deviation calculations from a study using 3 lots of test strips and 5 meters.
Each lot of test strips was tested 10 times per day over 5 days.
Lactate Control Solution stability was assessed in real time and accelerated studies.
The testing supported the claimed closed vial shelf life of 2 years and open vial
stability of 90 days when stored at 25-50°C.
Lactate Linearity Solution stability was assessed in real time and accelerated studies.
The testing supported the claimed closed vial shelf life of 2 years and open vial
stability of 90 days when stored at 25-50°C.

Test strip stability was assessed in real-time and accelerated studies. The testing
supported the claimed closed vial shelf life of 2 years and open vial stability of 48
weeks when stored at 25-40°C.
c. Detection limit:
The sponsor followed CLSI Guideline EP-17A for determining the limit of detection
LOD). First the limit of the blank (LOB) was determined by preparing 5 blank
control solution samples and testing each 20 times for a total of 100 measurements.
Four low level lactate samples were prepared based on the LOB. The concentration
of the samples was 4xLOB. The samples were tested 100 times to calculate the limit
of detection (LOD), where LOD = LOB + 1.6494*SD. The calculated LOD for this
assay was determined to be 0.12mM. The LOQ was calculated to be 0.32mM.
d. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed interference studies with spiked venous blood samples at
three lactate concentrations (1-3 mM, 4-8 mM, and 12-16 mM) that were prepared
and divided into a test (dosed) pool and a control pool. The concentrations of the
potential interference compounds spiked into the samples covered the low end of the
therapeutic range, high end of therapeutic range and toxic range. The interferents
were added to the samples and analyzed using one test strip lot on five meters. The
bias between control and dosed samples were calculated for each substance as well as
the bias of the dosed sample from the reference for each substance tested. All biases
(control to dosed sample and dosed sample to CCX) were within + 10%, indicating
no significant interference for any of the substances tested.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Hematocrit Study:
A study to evaluate the effect of hematocrit was conducted on samples with 4 lactate
concentrations (0.5-1.5, 2.5-3.5, 8-10, and 14-18mM) at 4 hematocrit levels (24, 40, 50,
and 65%). Each lactate level/hematocrit combination was tested 10 times on 5 meters.
Results of samples at each hematocrit level were compared to samples with the same
lactate concentration at normal (40%) hematocrit as well as to the corresponding value
from the laboratory assay. All results were within + 15% of the reference which supports
the claimed hematocrit range of 24-65%.
Oxygen/Altitude study:
To evaluate the effect of oxygen on the lactate measurement and to validate that the
device can work at altitude up to 15,000 feet, four levels of oxygen concentrations of
blood samples (20 -40 mmHg, 80 -100 mmHg, 130-160 mmHg and 190-220 mmHg),
were each tested with four concentration levels of lactate (0.3-1.0, 2.5-3.5, 9-11, and 15-
18 mM) on five meters with three lots of test strips. All results were within + 10% of the
laboratory assay result. The normal pO of capillary blood at altitude of 15,000 ft is about
2
32 mmHg while pO range at sea level is between 90 to 120 mmHg. The constant lactate
2
results measured at 20-200 mmHg indicate the suitability of the device for measurement
up to 15,000 ft.
Temperature and humidity studies:
Temperature and humidity studies were conducted that demonstrated that the devices can
be used at temperatures of 5 to 40°C and at a relative humidity of 10 to 90%.
Disinfection and Robustness studies: The Nova StatStrip Lactate Hospital Meter System
is intended for multiple patient use. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the
meter materials by an outside commercial testing service demonstrating complete
inactivation of live Hepatitis B virus with Clorox Germicidal Wipes (EPA Reg. No:
67619-12. The sponsor also demonstrated that there was no change in device
performance or in the external materials of the meter after 10,950 cleaning and
disinfection cycles with the Clorox Germicidal Wipes. This testing was designed to
simulate 3 years of usage at 10 patient samples per day. Labeling has been reviewed for
adequate instructions in validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
