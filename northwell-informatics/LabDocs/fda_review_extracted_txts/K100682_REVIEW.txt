from the binding proteins. A second antibody, directed against rabbit IgG, is coated
to the solid phase, giving convenient separation of the antibody-bound and free
antigen.
DELFIA Inducer dissociates europium ions from the labeled antigen into solution
where they form highly fluorescent chelates with components of the DELFIA
Inducer. The fluorescence in each well is then measured. The fluorescence of each
sample is inversely proportional to the concentration of 17-OHP in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the GSP Neonatal 17-OHP Kit was evaluated following the
recommendations in the CLSI EP5-A2 guideline. Eight whole blood
specimens were obtained from adults, the hematocrit was adjusted to 50-55 %
and spiked with 17-OHP at concentrations across the reportable range of the
test. The samples were then dispensed onto filter paper and dried at room
temperature overnight. The samples were tested over 28 days using three kit
lots and three GSP analyzers, for a total of 216 measurements per sample.
The sponsor also calculated the within run SD and within run CV % for each
sample measured using the same lot and the same instrument. Each sample
was measured 24 times (on 3 different runs) using the same lot/instrument
combination. The sponsor reported the “range” which is the minimum and
maximum within run SDs observed for samples ≤ 4 ng/mL serum and the
minimum and maximum within run CVs % observed for samples > 4 ng/mL
serum. The results are summarized below:

to create a sample with high 17-OHP concentration (approximately 250
ng/mL serum). The high and low pools were mixed in varying proportions to
create a dilution series of varying 17-OHP concentrations ranging from 0.9 to
213 ng/mL serum for kit lot 1 and 0.84 to 245 ng/mL serum for kit lot 2. The
samples were spotted on filter paper and dried overnight. The 17-OHP
concentrations of the series of dried blood spot samples were measured in
replicates of four with two kit lots and two instruments in random order.
The data was analyzed using linear regression as well as second and third
order non-linear fitted polynomial regression. The third order model fit the
data better than the linear model. However, for dilution points greater than 4
ng/mL, the maximum observed difference (%) between the models was 8.7 %
(kit lot 1) and 9.3 % (kit lot 2). For concentrations ≤ 4 ng/mL, the observed
absolute difference between the models was 0.18 ng/mL (kit lot 1) and 0.22
ng/mL (kit lot 2). The observed difference between the models was within the
sponsor’s pre-determined acceptance criteria for linearity.
The sponsor concluded that the assay is linear from 1.4 to 229 ng/mL serum.
The reportable range of the assay is 1.4 to 220 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There is no international reference preparation or reference method for 17-
OHP. The GSP Neonatal 17-OHP kits are traceable to commercially available
purified 17-OHP.
Six calibrator and three control materials are supplied with the kit as dried
blood spots on Whatman 903 filter paper. They are prepared from human
blood with a hematocrit value of 50 to 55 % and purified 17-OHP and
calibrated using gravimetric methods. The values for the calibrators and
controls are assigned using multiple replicates on GSP instruments and
provided on lot specific quality control certificates. The calibrator and control
materials to be used with this assay have been previously cleared under
k081922.
Real-time stability including shelf-life, transport, and in-use stability studies
for the entire kit were performed, including the controls and calibrators. The
sponsor has demonstrated a shelf life for all reagents of 12 months when
stored at 2 to 8 ºC. Once opened, calibrators, controls and plates are stable for
14 days when stored at 2 to 8 ºC. The on-board stability of the tracer,
antiserum and assay buffer is 5 days.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) studies were performed
following the recommendations in CLSI EP17-A. The LoB was calculated
from data using two kit lots and two instruments over 4 testing days and a
total of 120 measurements of blank (analyte free) dried blood spot samples on
7

--- Page 8 ---
filter paper. Statistical analysis yielded a LoB of 0.42 ng/mL serum.
To estimate the LoD, five low level samples (dried blood spot samples on
filter paper) were prepared from heparinized whole blood. Repeated
measurements of each sample (n = 216) were carried out using the proposed
device. Statistical analysis yielded a LoD of 1.4 ng/mL serum.
The package insert states that values below 1.4 ng/mL serum should be
reported as “<1.4 ng/mL serum.”
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference from various compounds was evaluated at 17-OHP
concentrations of approximately 30, 80 and 150 ng/mL serum. The potential
interferent was added to whole blood specimens containing 17-OHP, spotted
onto filter paper, dried, and tested. Specimens without added interferent
(solvent alone) were also tested (control). The sponsor concluded that a
potential interferent did not interfere with the assay when the observed effect
with 95% confidence was < 15% in the clinically relevant range (i.e. 10 to 150
ng/mL serum 17-OHP).
Compound Concentration added to samples
Bilirubin (conjugated) 20 mg/dL
Bilirubin (unconjugated) 20 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 0.5 g/dL
Triglycerides (Intralipid) 3000 mg/dL (30 and 80 ng/mL serum 17-OHP) and
750 mg/dL (150 ng/mL serum 17-OHP)
The sponsor concluded that none of the compounds at the tested levels
interfered with the assay.
Compounds whose structures are similar to 17-OHP were evaluated for
potential cross-reactivity using a published method. The lists of compounds
tested and results are summarized below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The study was performed in a routine newborn screening laboratory following
the recommendations in CLSI EP9-A2. The concentration of 17-OHP was
measured in a total of 2589 infants representing the US population. The
specimens were routine and retrospective screening specimens. The results
were analyzed and classified according to the birth weights of the infants and
are summarized in the tables below:

A regression analysis was performed to compare the proposed device to the
predicate. The specimens (n = 2567) within the measuring range of the
proposed device (1.4 to 220 ng/mL serum) were analyzed. A weighted
regression analysis was performed and the regression analysis results are
summarized below:

Screening Performance (Screening results and true diagnosis of the proposed
device):
Using the data from non-CAH samples, the cut-offs were determined by
calculating the 17-OHP concentrations corresponding to the 90th, 95th and 99th
population percentiles. The results for the screening performance of the
proposed device including 23 confirmed retrospective CAH diagnosed
specimens are summarized in the tables below:

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
The package insert states “the concentration of 17-OHP in newborns depends on
demographic variations, age, weight, prematurity and twinning. Birth weight or
gestational age, or both, are the most common categories in screening programs.
The laboratory needs to establish its own cut-off values, which can be based on a
percentile, or on the basis of a normal range. Cut-off levels related to e.g.
gestational age, infant age and birth weight need to be validated for each
screening population.”
The product insert recommends the follow-up algorithm for CAH screening
described by the American College of Medical Genetics at:
http://www.acmg.net/resources/policies/ACT/Visio-NBS_Elevated-17OHP_4-18-
06.pdf
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The distribution of 17-OHP concentration of a normal newborn population (USA)
was established using the proposed device by measuring the concentration of 17-
OHP in a total of 2566 infants representing the US population. The specimens
were routine and retrospective screening specimens. The following descriptive
statistics and percentile cut-offs are included in the package insert:
Birth weight 17-OHP (ng/mL serum) Percentile (ng/mL serum)
N
(g) Mean Median 90th 95th 99th
≥ 2250 1820 6.9 6.0 11.3 13.8 23.4
1250–2249 438 17.5 11.0 40.0 47.5 70.7
<1250 308 38.6 31.0 78.9 94.1 150.2
The package insert includes precautionary language that each laboratory should
establish its own reference range and cut-off values and that cut-offs from another
17-OHP screening test should not be used.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
