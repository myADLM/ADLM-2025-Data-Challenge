510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
k100684
B. Purpose for Submission:
Modification of the CellTracks® AutoPrep® System to include: new make and model
of waste bottle accessory and labeling changes associated with the accessory waste
bottle handling procedure.
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Veridex, LLC
CellTracks® AutoPrep® System
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
The device is an automated sample processing instrument that captures and enriches
target cells from whole blood samples by immunomagnetic separation, labels cells
with fluorescence-labeled monoclonal antibodies and transfers the processed sample
to analysis cartridges to be analyzed.
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The CellTracks® AutoPrep® System is a general purpose laboratory instrument
used with immunomagnetic reagents that capture and enrich target cells, and
labeling reagents that differentiate cells in whole blood. The CellTracks®
AutoPrep® System processes up to 8 samples in a batch, performing all required
process steps, including red cell detection, plasma aspiration and final transfer to
the analysis cartridge. The user is prompted to perform various pre-processing
operations such as dilution and centrifugation. Cell analyzers such as the
CellTracks Analyzer II®, CellSpotter® System, flow cytometers or microscopes
may be used for cell identification and enumeration following processing. The
AutoPrep® system uses a series of immunomagnetic separation procedures to
isolate the cells of interest and to stain the cells with fluorescence-labeled
monoclonal antibodies.
2. Principles of Operation:
The CellTracks® AutoPrep® system uses a series of immunomagnetic separation
procedures to isolate the cells of interest and to stain the cells with fluorescence-
labeled monoclonal antibodies. During sample processing, the AutoPrep®
system performs the following tasks:
• Adds ferrofluid to the sample and incubates the mixture. Ferrofluid is a
colloidal mixture of particles with a magnetic core surrounded by a polymeric
layer coated with monoclonal antibodies. During the incubation, antibodies in
the ferrofluid bind to antigens on the target cells.
• Places the ferrofluid/sample mixture in a strong magnetic field, which causes
the labeled cells to move to the side of the tube.
• Aspirates the blood, removes the magnetic field, and resuspends the cells in a
small volume of buffer.

• Washes the cells with buffer and uses a strong magnetic field to separate the
bound cells during aspiration of the wash solution.
• Adds fluorescent reagents to the sample and incubates the mixture. The
fluorescent reagents are fluorescence-labeled monoclonal antibodies that
uniquely identify the target cells. During the incubation, the fluorescence-
labeled antibodies bind to antigens on the target cells.
• Performs another magnetic separation of the cells.
• Aspirates the unbound fluorescent reagents, removes the magnetic field, and
resuspends the cells.
• Washes the cells with buffer and uses a strong magnetic field to separate the
bound cells during aspiration of the wash solution.
• Adds cell fixative and transfers the processed sample to a cartridge inside the
MagNest®, a specialized cell presentation fixture used with the cell analyzer.
The strong magnetic field of the MagNest® attracts the magnetically labeled
target cells to the surface of the cartridge, preparing the sample for scanning.
The operator can then load the MagNest® into the cell analyzer, which
identifies the unique staining patterns of the fluorescent reagents, enabling
identification and enumeration of the target cells.

Waste Bottle Handling Procedure Verification and Validation
Due to defect of the original waste bottles, the sponsor changed waste bottles
from Nalgene to Kautex bottles and implemented a new waste bottle handling
procedure. This new waste handling procedure was validated by Veridex
employees at six internal Veridex laboratories. A total of 66 test runs (waste
handling events) were conducted using different volumes of waste in the waste
bottle. Decontamination of the waste material was confirmed by visual
inspection: the color of the contents changed from red to white (clear). The

testers assessed pressure build-up in the bottle by listening for audible sounds of
pressure release when removing the solid cap from the bottle.
Bulk Fluid Module (BFM) Verification and Validation
In addition to the labeling changes Veridex is sourcing a new bottle for use on the
CellTracks® AutoPrep® System in response to the field action Z-1734-09. The
new Kautex bottle will replace all Nalgene bottles on the CellTracks® AutoPrep®
system. The new bottles have different dimensions and shape than the predicate
bottles; as a result, it was necessary to modify the plastic base and tray that hold
the bottles when on the system.
Functional testing was performed to ensure that the modifications made to the
BFM do not adversely affect the functionality of the BFM module. The Bulk
Fluid Module (BFM) consists of the following components: the 4 bottles used on
the system (Waste Bottle, Instrument Buffer Bottle, DI Water Bottle and the
Cleaning Solution Bottle) the base (tray support), three bottle trays, and the bottle
sensors. In addition, system performance testing was conducted using the
CellSearch® Circulating Tumor Cell Control kit. A detailed description of this
testing and the results were provided in the test report D17487 CellTracks®
AutoPrep® System Bulk Fluid Module Bottle Upgrade System Verification Test
Report.
Functional Testing:
Functional testing demonstrated that the new BFM parts assembled and fit as
expected, and could be properly calibrated when the new Kautex bottles were
used on the system.
Performance Testing:
The second part of the testing verified system performance of the modified
device. Two predicate CellTracks® AutoPrep® Systems equipped with the
predicate BFM and bottle were tested. The same two instruments were then
equipped with modified BFM’s using the modified bottle. Testing was performed
on each instrument configuration using the CellSearch® Circulating Tumor Cell
Control cells and the Cellsearch® Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) reagent kits.
The acceptance criteria for this testing were for the control cells to fall within the
expected ranges established for each lot (as indicated in the product labeling). All
control results for all runs fell within the accepted ranges.
K. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
L. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
