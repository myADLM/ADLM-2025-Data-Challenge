H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indication for use, below
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Audit™ MicroCV™ Homocysteine Linearity Set is assayed quality control
material consisting of five levels human based serum. Each level contains
Homocysteine analyte. The five levels demonstrate a linear relationship to each
other for Homocysteine analyte. It is intended to simulate human patient serum
samples for purpose of determining linearity, calibration verification and
verification of reportable range for Homocysteine. The product is intended for use
with quantitative assays on the indicated analyzer provided in the labeling. The
Audit™ MicroCV™ Homocysteine Linearity Set should not be used for
calibration or standardization of the Homocysteine assay. The Audit™
MicroCV™ Homocysteine Linearity Set is “For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only”.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The Audit™ MicroCV™ Homocysteine Linearity Set should not be used for
calibration or standardization of the Homocysteine assay.
3. Special instrument requirements:
The performance was established on the Siemens Centaur XP analyzer.
I. Device Description:
The Audit™ MicroCV™ Homocysteine Linearity Set is an in vitro diagnostic device
consisting of five levels of liquid linearity materials containing hs-CRP and additives
in human serum. There are 5 vials labeled A, B, C, D, and E, and contain 1 mL for
each level.
Material of human origin used in the manufacture of this test set has been tested using
FDA approved methods and found to be non-reactive for HBsAg and antibodies to
HCV and HIV-1/2.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not Applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and Value assignment
Component is obtained from an approved vendor and inspected by the sponsor
in house.
Value Assignment was performed on one Centaur instrument with one lot of
Homocysteine reagent. Value assignment for each level was based on five
results. Target values were calculated from mean values of the five results for
each level. The target ranges were calculated as ± 10% of the target value. The
mean concentration values of each level were plotted (concentration value vs.
assigned level) and a linear regression values were obtained and evaluated.
Stability studies:
Open-Vial Stability:
The protocol, data and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
adequate. The data supported the package insert claims that the analyte is
stable after opening the vial when stored at 2 – 8º C for 10 days.
Accelerated Stability:
The protocol, data and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
adequate. Accelerated stability studies are supported by an on-going real-time
stability study. The shelf life claim is 24 months. This is based on the
accelerated stability results and on-going real-time stability studies.
