The manufacturer included the following statement in the product package insert:
“Each human donor unit used to manufacture this control was tested by FDA
accepted methods and found non-reactive for Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg),
antibody to Hepatitis C (HCV), and antibody to HIV-1/HIV-2. This product may also
contain other human source material for which there are no approved tests. In
accordance with good laboratory practice, all human source material should be
considered potentially infectious and handled with the same precautions used with
patient specimens.”

L. Test Principle:
Not applicable
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Liquid Assayed Multiqual is prepared from human serum to which purified
biochemical material (tissue extracts of human and animal origin), chemicals,
drugs, preservatives, and stabilizers have been added.
Expected Values and Value Ranges
Expected values for the Liquid Assayed Multiqual are determined by
duplicate analyses of levels 1 to 3 using Siemens Dimension Vista analyzers
by the analyzer manufacturer. Pre-determined acceptance criteria for analyte
recovery must be met for each control lot. The target value for each CalCheck
is the mean of the observed values. Assigned values and value ranges are lot
dependent and are listed in the lot-specific value sheet. Test results should fall
within the corresponding ±3SD range printed on the lot-specific value sheet.
The labeling states that laboratories should establish their own means and
acceptable ranges.
Stability
Stability testing data support the manufacturer claims that the Liquid Assayed
Multiqual is stable until the expiration date printed on the vial when stored
unopened at -20 to -50°C. Accelerated stability testing supports the target
shelf life claim of three years. The manufacturer has an on-going real-time
stability study design to support the recommended storage conditions for the
life of the product. The unopened-thawed vials are stable for thirty days at 2-
8°C with the following exceptions: Direct Bilirubin-11 days; Triglycerides,
HDL, Cholinesterase, Phosphorus-7 days. The following statement has been

added to the label: Total Bilirubin and Direct Bilirubin values may decrease;
Alkaline Phosphatase activity may rise under these storage conditions. The
opened vials (on-board) are stable for five days at 2-8°C.
