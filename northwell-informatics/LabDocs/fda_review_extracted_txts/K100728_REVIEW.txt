I. Device Description:
The Zeus Scientific, Inc. AtheNA Multi-Lyte Borrelia VlsE-1/pepC10 Plus Test System
is designed to detect IgG class antibodies in human sera to VlsE-1 antigen and IgM class
antibodies to pepC10 antigen. The test procedure involves four incubation steps.
1. Test sera (properly diluted) are incubated in a filter plate well containing a
multiplexed mixture of Bead Suspension-1. The multiplexed Bead Suspension-1
contains a mixture of distinguishable sets of polystyrene microspheres; one of
these bead sets is conjugated with the VlsE-1 antigen. The bead mix also contains
one bead set designed to detect non-specific binding and four separate bead sets
used for assay calibration. If present in patient sera, specific antibodies will bind
to the immobilized antigen on one or more of the bead sets. The microspheres are
rinsed to remove non-reactive serum proteins.
2. Conjugate-1 is added to the microtiter well and the plate is incubated. The
conjugate will react with IgG antibody immobilized on the solid phase in step 1.
The microspheres are rinsed to remove unbound conjugate.
3. Bead Suspension-2 is added to the wells. The bead set contains beads conjugated
with pepC10 and VlsE-1 antigens. A second aliquot of test sera at the same
dilution as in step 1 is added to the well and mixed. The bead and specimen
suspension is incubated. Following incubation the microspheres are rinsed to
remove the non-reacting serum proteins.
4. Conjugate 2 is added to the microtiter well and the plate is incubated. The
conjugate will react with IgM antibody immobilized on the solid phase in step 1
and step 3.
5. The entire bead suspension is then analyzed by the AtheNA Multi-Lyte
instrument. The bead set(s) are sorted (identified) and the amount of reporter
molecule (PE conjugate) is determined for each bead set. Using the Intra-Well
Calibration Technology™, internal calibration bead sets are used to convert raw
fluorescence into outcome (AtheNA Score).
Detection of antigen specific IgG and IgM antibodies: After the bead set mix is
allowed to react with human serum as described in steps 1 through 4, human
antibodies if present, will bind to the bead sets and then will be analyzed. The
amount of reporter is a direct measurement of IgM, IgG or both IgM and IgG if a
patient has both IgG and IgM to the same antigen. The amount of IgG in such an
instance can be determined by a mathematical formula of like-coated bead set results
using a sequence of measurements patented by Zeus Scientific, Inc.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision: Assay repeatability was evaluated at the manufacturer site. The study
was conducted as follows: six samples were identified and/or prepared (by Zeus
Scientific, Inc.) for use in the study based upon their activity on the AtheNA
Multi-Lyte assay. Selected samples were negative, high negative, near cut-off,
low positive, and moderate and high positive. On each day of testing, the samples
were diluted twice and tested. This was repeated in a second run on the same day
by a different technologist for a total of twelve days.

Specimens known to contain potentially cross reactive antibodies to B.burgdorferi
with infections to tick-borne relapsing fever, rickettsial diseases, ehrlichiosis,
babesiosis, and leptospirosis have not been tested with this device, therefore the
performance of this device is unknown if there is any cross-reactivity with these
antibodies. This is indicated in the limitation section of the package insert.
Interfering Substances: The effect of potential interfering substances on sample
results generated using the AtheNA Multi-Lyte VlsE-1/pepC10 Plus test system
was evaluated with the following possible interfering substances: albumin,
bilirubin, cholesterol, hemoglobin, triglycerides and intralipids.
The quantity of analyte in each interfering substance is as follows:
Bilirubin: 1mg/dL (low), 15 mg/dL (high)
Albumin: 3.5 g/dL (low), 5 g/dL (high)
Cholesterol: 150 mg/dL (low), 250 mg/dL (high)
Triglycerides: 150 mg/dL (low), 500 mg/dL (high)
Hemoglobin: 20 g/dL (low), 20 g/dL (high)
Intralipid: 300 mg/dL (low), 750 mg/dL (high)
Three samples each for VlsE-1 and pepC10 were chosen based on their
performance on the AtheNA Multi-Lyte Borrelia VlsE-1/pepC10 Plus test system:
(strongly reactive, weakly reactive and negative). The samples were exposed to
the possible interfering substance, tested in duplicate and mean was determined.
All samples showed less than a 20% change in signal in the Vlse-1 study with the
exception of the borderline VlsE-1 sample which exhibited an increase in signal
of 32% with the high spike of bilirubin and an increase in signal of 27% with the
high spike of cholesterol. All samples showed less than a 20% change in signal in
the pepC10 study with the exception of the borderline pepC10 sample which
exhibited a reduction in signal of 24% with the high spike of hemoglobin and an
increase in signal of 28% with the low spike of triglyceride.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cut off for this assay was established using 25 negative control specimens as
well as 5 clinically characterized specimens for each antigen. The mean and
standard deviation was established for the negative population; using a
mathematical calculation involving this data, a theoretical cut-off is established
and validated with the characterized specimens. Based upon the results of this
testing, the manufacturer has established the following guidelines for
interpretation of patient samples.

--- Page 7 ---
AtheNA Result Interpretation
Score
< 1 Negative An AtheNA Multi-Lyte® score of < 1indicates no antibodies to
VlsE1 and pepC10 detected. If exposure to B. burgdorferi is
suspected, a second sample should be collected and tested two to
four weeks later.
≥1 Positive An AtheNA Multi-Lyte® score of ≥ 1 indicates that antibodies
specific to B.burgdoferi were detected. This indicates presumptive
evidence of probable exposure.

If available, western blot testing was performed on the discrepant results. 12/31 samples were negative by blot and 9/31 samples
were positive by blot for sera which tested negative on the AtheNA Multi-lyte test system and positive by ELISA (10/31) samples
had no blot data provided). The 3 equivocal samples by the predicate would be considered for second step Western blot testing
along with positives.
7/45 samples tested positive and 5/45 samples tested negative by blot for the discrepant samples that were positive on the
AtheNA Multi-Lyte test system and negative by ELISA (33 samples had no blot data available).

Western blot testing was done on discrepant results. 2/37 samples were negative by blot and 37/39 samples were positive by blot
for sera which tested negative on the AtheNA Multi-lyte test system and positive by ELISA. 4/4 samples tested positive by blot for
the discrepant samples that were positive on the AtheNA Multi-Lyte test system and negative by ELISA.
*Statistical significance evaluation can not be made on limited number of samples.
CDC Characterized Lyme Panel: 40 samples of various reactivity were acquired from
the CDC and evaluated internally at the manufacturer’ site. 5 samples were from normal
blood donors. 35 samples were from patients diagnosed with Borreliosis. The results of
the testing are presented here as a means of conveying further information on the
performance of this assay with a characterized serum panel. This does not imply an
endorsement of the assay by the CDC.

Demographics and Age Distribution in a Prospective Population: Internal and
external investigators assessed the device’s performance with 756 masked
samples prospectively collected from patients between the ages of 1 and 94 which
were submitted for Lyme antibody testing. Site 1, a hospital laboratory located in
the northeast tested 107 samples. Site 2, a hospital laboratory in the northeast
tested 103 samples. The third clinical site was a state Department of Health
located in the northeast. This facility tested 446 samples collected in the northeast.
Demographics for 346 of the 756 samples were unavailable. Site 4, the
manufacturer’s research facility tested 100 samples collected in Connecticut. The
available patient demographics and age distribution for 410 of the 756 samples
are summarized below followed by expected results in the prospective population.
