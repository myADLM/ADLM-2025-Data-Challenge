The sponsor claims traceability of the D-glucose used in this control to the
Glucose Standard Set NERL 1343: 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg/dL.
Expected Values
Glucose control expected values were determined by repeat analyses using the
GlucoSure STAR meter, one lot of Contrex Plus Low Control Solution, and
80 GlucoSure STAR test strips. The mean value was 55 mg/dL glucose and a
+ 15 mg/dL range was assigned. Value assignment was validated with two
GlucoSure STAR meters, one lot of GlucoSure STAR test strips, over 10 days
using two strips per test run. Test results must fall within the range printed on
the test strip vial. The expected results may change with each new lot. However,
the control range is listed on the test strip vial. In the package insert, the user is
directed to compare their control result with the range printed on the test strip
vial.
The applicant also provides values for the Gluco Track system since this is the
same device as the GlucoSure STAR (k073648) except for alternate site
testing (AST) claim.
Stability
Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to
be acceptable. Stability characteristics of the Contrex Plus Low Control
Solution were determined using real time un-opened and opened vial studies.
An unopened shelf-life of 2 years (24 months) is expected at the
recommended storage temperature (59°F-86°F). Open vial stability of 90 days
(3 months) was demonstrated at the recommended storage temperature of
59°F-86°F. The recommendations in the labeling are to store control
solutions at room temperature and additional warnings are given to not freeze
or refrigerate control solutions.
