L. Test Principle:
The pH in Pleural fluid is measured by potentiometry. The potential of an electrode
chain is recorded using a voltmeter, and related to the concentration of the sample, as
described by the Nernst equation. An electrode chain describes an electrical circuit
consisting of a sample, electrode, reference electrode, voltmeter, membranes and
electrolyte solutions. The reference electrode maintains a stable, fixed potential
against which other potential differences can be measured. The potential is not altered
by sample composition.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The evaluation of precision for the pleural fluid on the ABL837 FLEX
analyzer was conducted using pooled human pleural fluid samples adjusted to
three different pH levels (7.1, 7.3 and 7.5). The pH adjusted pleural fluid
samples were frozen and thawed prior to testing. Each pH adjusted pleural
fluid sample was analyzed on three ABL837 FLEX analyzers, 2 runs per day,
and 2 aliquots per run for 20 days. The precision studies were performed
according to CLSI EP5-A2.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity data for pleural fluid collected in the comparison study (see Section
M2a below) was used to demonstrate linearity on the ABL837 FLEX
analyzer. Linear regression analysis of the results yielded the following:
y = 1.056x – 0.393, r² = 0.993.
The measuring range for pleural fluid samples is pH 7.0 to 7.5.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The traceability, stability and expected value of pH calibration solutions
(Calibration Solution 1 and 2) and pH control solution kit (AutoCheck 6+)
was previously cleared under k041874. The traceability, stability and expected
value of the pH control solution kit (Range+ Qualicheck) were previously
cleared under k980135.

Detection limit for pleural fluid pH was established in the method comparison
study M. 2 a. below and for whole blood pH in the previously cleared
submission (k041874).

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A correlation study was performed between the proposed device (ABL837
analyzer) and the predicate device (Roche Omni C which is currently
marketed as Roche Cobas b221) according to CLSI protocol EP9-A2. This
study was performed using 58 pleural fluid samples, pH ranged from 6.93 to
7.57, obtained from 29 patients. Some of the samples were spiked with either
NaOH or acetic acid to adjust the pH, so that the samples were evenly
distributed in the pH range 7.0 to 7.5. All pleural fluid samples were frozen
and thawed prior to testing. Eight samples were tested per day on two
analyzers per day over a span of eight days. A single measurement obtained
on an ABL837 analyzer was compared to a single measurement obtained on
the predicate device. Linear regression analysis of the results yielded the
following:
y = 1.056x – 0.393, r² = 0.993.
A bias plot of individual data points showed that all values were within ±0.1
pH unit of the predicate device. At medical decision points of pH 7.2 and 7.3,
the bias was 0.010 and 0.0159, respectively.
