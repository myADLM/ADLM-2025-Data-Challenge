2. Indication(s) for use:
The LOCI Thyroid Calibrator is an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of the
LOCI Free Triiodothyronine (FT3L), LOCI Free Thyroxine (FT4L) and LOCI Thyroid
Stimulating hormone (TSHL) methods on the Dimension® EXL™ integrated chemistry
system with LOCI® Module.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use
4. Special instrument requirements:
For use with the Dimension® EXL™ integrated chemistry system with LOCI® Module
I. Device Description:
The LOCI Thyroid Calibrator is a multi-analyte, liquid, bovine serum albumin based product
containing triiodothyronine (FT3), thyroxine (FT4) and human thyroid stimulating hormone
(TSH). The kit consists of ten vials with two vials per level containing 2.0 mL per vial.
The calibrator levels and their assigned values are:
Level 2 Level 3 Level 4 Level 5 Level 6
FT4L ----- 0.80 ng/mL 1.60 ng/mL 4.00 ng/mL 8.40 ng/mL
TSHL 0.00 µIU/mL 4.00 µIU/mL 20.00 µIU/mL 50.00 µIU/mL 105.00 µIU/mL
FT3L 0 pg/mL 2 pg/mL 6 pg/mL 15 pg/mL 31.5 pg/mL
*Level 1 is not included in the LOCI Thyroid Calibrator carton. Reagent grade water must be
used as the Level 1 calibrator for the FT4L method.
All human source materials used to produce this product have been tested for HbsAg, anti-
HCV, HIV-1 and HIV-2 and found to be non-reactive by FDA licensed tests.

Traceability and value assignment for free thyroxine (FT4) and thyroid stimulating
hormone (TSH) in the calibrator were previously described in k073604 and k081103
respectively and has not been modified.
Traceability and value assignment for triiodothyronine (FT3) involves preparation of
anchor and pools and master pools. The anchor pool is prepared from USP grade 3,
3’, 5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) spiked in a human serum matrix. Seven levels of
anchor pool are prepared. A Master Pool is developed from a bovine albumin based
matrix to which different concentrations of 3, 3’, 5-triiodo-L-thyronine have been
added. Values for the Master Pool are derived by multiple analyses against the
Anchor Pool calibration curve. The LOCI Thyroid Calibrator value assignment is
established by measurement against the Master Pool calibration.
The shelf-life and open-vial stability of the LOCI Thyroid Calibrator when stored at
2-8˚C have been demonstrated using real time data collected from 3 lots of
calibrators. The predetermined acceptance criteria and protocols were reviewed and
found to be acceptable.
For the LOCI Thyroid Calibrator, the sponsor claims a shelf life of 12 months when
unopened and stored at 2-8˚C. Once opened, the LOCI Thyroid Calibrator is stable
for 3 months when recapped and stored at 2-8˚C.
