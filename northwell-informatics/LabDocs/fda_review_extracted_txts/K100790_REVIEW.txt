L. Test Principle:
COULTER® LIN-X Linearity Controls are a hematology quality control material
used to assess calibration and verify the reportable range of COULTER® Cellular
Analysis Systems. The product’s WBC, RBC, HGB and PLT concentrations span the
instrument reportable range. Results from repeated measurements for each
concentration are compared to the established expected range to asses the
instrument’s calibration and to verify the reportable range.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision performance of the LIN-X Linearity Control was evaluated on
three lots of each of the seven levels which were run in triplicate, twice each
day (AM and PM) for a minimum of 20 days on two DxH 300C and one DxH
300 analyzers. The results were analyzed according to the guidance provided
in CLSI EP05-A2. Analysis was performed on each level of LIN-X Linearity
Control (7 levels). Variance components were estimated for all sources of
variability were controlled in the experiment based on a nested structure (lot,
instrument, day, time within day, and repeatability). Repeatability variances of
each site were checked for homogeneity before data from the three
instruments were pooled together. The MIVQUE0 method was used for
variance component estimation. Negative values of variance component
estimates were defaulted to zero. Coefficients of variation (CV) were
calculated for each source of variability. CV, reproducibility/repeatability and
acceptance criteria are presented in the Tables below. The results met the
acceptance criteria as indicated by the Repeatability/Reproducibility
Specification.

Value assignment: DxH™ 300 and DxH™ 300C hematology analyzer value
assignments for each lot of LIN-X Linearity Control Levels 1 thru 7 are
determined on validated systems using specific COULTER reagents.
Approximately fifty (50) vials from each lot are taken randomly throughout
the production run. For the value assignment process, two assay runs are
required on two separate instruments and four to seven sample vials are
analyzed for each assay run. An assay computer system is used to determine
the number of replicates required for each assay run and analyze the data in
real-time as the results are generated on the instrument system. A number of
aspirations, sufficient to establish equivalence to the means, are taken for each
assayed parameter. Once equivalence has been determined on the two separate
assay runs, the assay value is calculated as the mean value of the two assay
runs for each parameter. The difference between individual assay runs versus

Open and Closed stability Three lots of LIN-X Level 6 Linearity Control
samples were processed on both the DxH™ 300 and DxH™ 300C
hematology analyzers according to the LIN-X Control package insert
procedure. The testing was conducted throughout the proposed shelf life of
120 days at 2-8oC. The Open Vial stability was performed 7 times over the
proposed shelf life. Two vials of each level of control were opened and tested
7 days, one vial on the open mode analyzer (DxH™ 300) and one on the
closed mode (DxH™ 300C). The Closed Vial stability was performed twice a
month over the proposed shelf life. Two vials of each level of control were
run, one vial on the open mode analyzer (DxH™ 300) and one on the closed
mode (DxH™ 300C). The mean of 5 aspirations for WBC Level 6 recovered
values were compared to the assay values and the expected ranges established
at the beginning of the test interval to assess the product’s stability. A
summary of the results for the stability data are as follows:

4. Clinical cut-off:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected range for WBC Level 6 is calculated based on the other LIN-X
ranges for DxH™ 300/300C Cellular Analysis System. The relationship between
the target values and ranges for all levels is represented by a linear model.
Verification of the expected ranges is conducted in a modality study on multiple
analyzers. The estimated range for Level 6 is obtained from the regression line
along with its 95% confidence limits. The upper confidence limit value of ±12 x
103 cells/μL is the recommended range for Level 6. This expected range for
Level 6 was established due to the addition of the WBC parameter.
The mean values of the all parameters should recover within the ranges provided.
The ranges established by Beckman Coulter should be used as a guideline. Each
laboratory must establish it own criteria for acceptable results.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
