H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Elecsys C-Peptide CalCheck 5 is an assayed control for use in calibration
verification and for use in the verification of the serum and plasma assay range
established by the Elecsys C-Peptide reagent on the indicated Elecsys and cobas e
immunoassay analyzers.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For professional use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
For use with Elecsys C-Peptide reagent on the Modular Analytics E170/cobas e
601 and Elecsys 2010/cobas e 411analyzers.
I. Device Description:
The Elecsys C-Peptide CalCheck 5 set contains five lyophilized levels of synthetic
human C-peptide in HEPES buffered equine serum. During manufacture, human C-
peptide is spiked into the matrix at the target concentrations listed below. CalCheck
Level 1 contains no analyte.
Elecsys C-Peptide Target Value (ng/mL)
CalCheck Level
Level 1 0
Level 2 5.0
Level 3 20
Level 4 30
Level 5 40
All human source materials were prepared exclusively from the blood of donors
tested individually and found nonreactive for HBsAg, antibodies to HCV and HIV.
The testing methods were FDA approved or cleared in compliance with the European
Directive 98/79/EC.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and Value Assignment
A master calibration curve is generated on an Elecsys Modular Analytics
E170 /cobas e 601analyzer using nine target values from the World Health
Organization reference reagent, 1 IRR, code 84/510 (NIBSC) standard. The
st
master calibration curve is used to calculate ng/mL for the respective
CalChecks.
For each Elecsys C-peptide CalCheck 5 lot manufactured, value assignment is
performed as follows. Each CalCheck is tested in duplicate using at least three
Elecsys Modular Analytics E170 /cobas e 601analyzers. Additionally, each
CalCheck is assayed once on eight Elecsys 2010/ cobas e 411analyzers. The
target value for each CalCheck is the median of the observed values. The
labeling states that laboratories should establish appropriate acceptance
criteria when using this product for its intended use.
Stability
Real time and accelerated stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria
were described and found to be adequate. The current closed vial stability
claim is 15 months at 2o to 8oC. The reconstituted vials are stable for four
hours at 25 º C.
