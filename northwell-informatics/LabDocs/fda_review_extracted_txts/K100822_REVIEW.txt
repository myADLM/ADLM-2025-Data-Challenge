I. Device Description:
The Cepheid Xpert SA Nasal Complete Assay is a rapid, automated in vitro
diagnostic test designed for rapid and simultaneous detection of Staphylococcus
aureus (SA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) from nasal
swabs in patients at risk for nasal colonization. The Xpert SA Nasal Complete Assay

--- Page 3 ---
system performs real-time, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection
of DNA after an initial sample processing step. In this platform, additional sample
preparation, amplification, and real-time detection are all fully-automated and
completely integrated. The assay is performed on a GeneXpert® Dx System, which
consists of the GeneXpert instrument, personal computer, hand-held barcode scanner,
and disposable fluidic cartridges that are designed to complete sample preparation
and realtime PCR for detection of MRSA and SA in approximately 50 minutes. Each
instrument contains 1 to 16 randomly accessible modules that are each capable of
performing separate sample preparation and real-time PCR tests. Each module
contains a syringe drive for dispensing fluids, an ultrasonic horn for lysing cells or
spores, and I-CORE® thermocycler for performing real-time PCR and detection.
The patented single-use cartridges contain: (1) eleven chambers for holding sample,
reagents, or other materials, (2) a valve body composed of a plunger and syringe
barrel, (3) a rotary valve system for controlling the movement of fluids between
chambers, (4) an area for capturing, concentrating, washing, and lysing spores/cells,
(5) dry real-time PCR reagents, and (6) an integrated PCR reaction tube that can be
automatically filled by the instrument. To eliminate test-to-test contamination, all
fluids including amplicons, are contained within the disposable cartridge. The
instrument never comes into contact with any fluids within the cartridge. Each
disposable cartridge is intended to test one sample. Cartridges are not re-usable.
The Xpert SA Nasal Complete Assay includes reagents for the simultaneous detection
of the target organisms, MRSA and SA. The primers and probes in the Xpert SA
Nasal Complete Assay detect nucleic acid sequences of the staphylococcal protein A
(spa), the gene for methicillin/oxacillin resistance (mecA), and the staphylococcal
cassette chromosome (SCCmec) inserted in the SA chromosomal attB site.
The primers and probes in the Xpert SA Nasal Complete Assay detect nucleic acid
sequences of the staphylococcal protein A (spa), the gene for methicillin/oxacillin
resistance (mecA), and staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCCmec) inserted into
the SA chromosomal attB site. Nasal swab specimens from the anterior nares are
collected and transported to the GeneXpert® area. The swab specimen is placed in a
tube containing elution reagent. Following a brief vortex, the eluted material and two
other reagents are transferred to different chambers of the cartridge. The GeneXpert®
performs sample preparation by mixing the eluted sample with the sample processing
control (Bacillus globigii in the form of a dry spore cake within the cartridge) and
treatment reagents, capturing the bacterial cells on a filter, lysing the cells using glass
beads and an ultrasonic horn, then eluting the released DNA. The DNA solution is
then mixed with dry PCR reagents and transferred into the PCR tube for real-time
PCR and detection.
Note: Bacillus globigii spores are used as the sample preparation control because they
are more difficult to lyse than Staphylococcus aureus.

L. Test Principle:
The primers and probes in the Xpert SA Nasal Complete Assay detect the presence of
proprietary sequences for the staphylococcal protein A (Spa), the gene for
methicillin/oxacillin resistance (mecA), and the staphylococcal cassette chromosome
(SCCmec) inserted into the SA chromosomal attB site. Nasal swabs from the anterior
nares are collected and transported to the GeneXpert® area. The swab is placed in a
tube containing elution reagent. Following a brief vortex, the eluted material and two
other liquid reagents are transferred to different chambers of the cartridge. The
GeneXpert® Dx System performs sample preparation by mixing the eluted sample
with the sample preparation control (Bacillus globigii in the form of a dry spore cake
within the cartridge) and treatment reagents, capturing the bacterial cells on a filter,
lysing the cells using glass beads and an ultrasonic horn, then eluting the released
DNA. The DNA solution is then mixed with dry PCR reagents and transferred into
the PCR tube for real-time PCR and detection.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

d. Detection limit:
Limit of Detection Study
The Limit of Detection study was determined using Staphylococcus aureus
(SA) cells and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) cells
diluted into a simulated nasal matrix. The nasal matrix consisted of mucin
and 1% of blood in PBS with 15% glycerol. The limit of detection is defined
as the lowest number of colony forming units (CFU) per sample that can be
reproducibly distinguished from negative samples with 95% confidence or the
lowest concentration at which 19 of 20 replicates were positive.
For SA, replicates of 20 were evaluated at various concentrations for three (3)
individual isolates. USA types USA900 and USA1200 were represented.
For MRSA, replicates of 20 were evaluated at various concentrations for ten
(10) individual isolates representing SCCmec types I, II, III, IVa, IVd, V, VI,
VII, and VIII. When characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
(PFGE), USA100 and USA400 are represented. Isolates of heterogeneous
oxacillin resistant subpopulations were included.
The estimate and confidence intervals were determined using logistic
regression with data (number of positive results per number of replicates at
each level) over the range of CFU/swab tested. The confidence intervals were
determined using maximum likelihood estimates on the logistic model
parameters using the large sample variance-covariance matrix. The LoD point
estimates and 95% upper and lower confidence intervals for each SA and each
MRSA SCCmec type tested are summarized in tables below:

swab containing 175 CFU and a positive MRSA result 95% of the time with
95% confidence for a nasal swab containing 300 CFU.
Effect of Competing Amounts of SA on the Limit of Detection of MRSA
An additional study was conducted to determine the effect of increasing
amounts of methicillin–susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) cells on
the Limit of Detection (LoD) of methicillin–resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) cells established for the Xpert SA Nasal Complete Assay.
The competitive inhibitory effect of increasing amounts of SA relative to
MRSA at LoD was evaluated for each SCCmec type I, II, III, IVa, V, VI, VII,
and VIII.
For MRSA SCCmec types I, II, III, IVa, V, VI, and VII, the effect of
competing MSSA is inhibitory at the claimed LoD at MRSA: MSSA ratios of
1:1x106.
For MRSA SCCmec type VIII, the effect of competing MSSA is inhibitory at
the claimed LoD at a MRSA: MSSA ratio of 1:1x103.
Analytical Inclusivity
A total of 248 isolates (199 MRSA strains and 49 methicillin sensitive S.
aureus strains) were tested using the Xpert SA Nasal Complete Assay. All
strains were tested in triplicate using bacterial cell stocks diluted to
concentrations at or near the assay cut-off. Known USA300 isolates (39 in
total), including USA300-0114, are represented. Other PFGE types included
in the study are USA100 (54), USA200 (5), USA400 (1), USA500 (7),
USA600 (2), USA700 (2), USA800 (9), USA1000 (8), USA1100 (2),
IBERIAN isolates (2), and strains designated PGFE types A, B, and F. All
results are as expected.
Evaluation of Empty Cassette Variants:
In another study, 22 Staphylococcus aureus isolates identified as “empty
cassette variants” received from a hospital were tested using the Xpert SA
Nasal Complete Assay. All strains were tested at cell concentrations near the
analytical LoD, at ~300 CFU/test and at ~3X105 CFU/test.
All 22 isolates were identified as MRSA negative and SA positive. No mecA
signals were reported.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross Reactivity
A total of 114 strains (83 Gram positive, 28 Gram negative, and three yeasts)
phylogenetically related to Staphylococcus aureus or those potentially present
in nasopharyngeal flora were tested. There were 103 strains from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), seven strains from the Network

--- Page 9 ---
on Antimicrobial Resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (NARSA); the
remaining four isolates were from Sweden, Germany and Japan. The isolates
included 34 methicillin-sensitive coagulase negative staphylococci
(MSCoNS), and 12 methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci
(MRCoNS).
Each strain was tested using 100 µL of culture adjusted to 4.5 to 9.5x108
CFU/mL. Three replicates of each strain were tested. All isolates were reported
MRSA Negative; SA Negative by the Xpert SA Nasal Complete Assay.
Evaluation of BORSA Strains:
All seven BORSA isolates (including the apparent "empty cassette" isolate) were
reported MRSA negative; SA positive at both high and low cell concentrations
using the Xpert SA Nasal Complete Assay. No mecA signals were reported.
Interference Study
In another analytical study, potential interfering substances that may be present in
clinical nasal specimen were tested with the following results:
Summary of Test Results per Substance and Concentration Tested
(*) In negatives per substance (excluding buffer control), if not 8/8, then Invalid or Error test
result(s) reported

--- Page 10 ---
(^) In MRSA positives per substance (excluding buffer control), if not 8/8, then false negative test
result(s) reported
(-) Level of substance not tested
Inhibitory effects resulting in invalid test results were observed in the presence of
Flonase or Nasonex in negative samples at concentrations greater than 5% (v/v)
and 10% (v/v), respectively.
Inhibitory effects resulting in MRSA false negative test results were observed in
the presence of Flonase at greater than 1% (v/v) and in the presence of Nasonex
greater than 5% (v/v).
Carry-Over Contamination study consisted of a negative sample (no MRSA
cells spiked into the elution buffer) processed within the same GeneXpert module
immediately following a very high positive sample (1x107 MRSA cells spiked
into the elution buffer). This was repeated 20 times between two GeneXpert
modules for a total of 42 runs (10 positive samples per module and 11 negative
samples per module). The study demonstrated no evidence of carry-over
contamination.
f. Assay cut-off:
The valid minimum cycle threshold setting for spa, mecA and SCCmec is 10
because in practice, a Ct cannot be calculated before the end of the minimum
background subtraction range, which is 10 cycles. The earliest spa Ct reported in
true SA and MRSA Positive results during pre-clinical testing was 16.5.
The valid maximum cycle threshold (Ct) setting for spa, mecA, and SCCmec is
35.0, 36.0, and 38.0 respectively.
To obtain a valid SA Positive test result, the spa Ct must be reported within the
valid cycle range. To obtain a valid MRSA Positive test result, all spa, mecA, and
SCCmec Cts must be reported within the valid cycle range. To obtain a valid
MRSA or SA Negative test result, the spa, mecA, and SCCmec Cts must not be
reported within the valid cycle range and the SPC Ct must be reported within its
valid cycle range. If the SPC falls outside the valid cycle range, the test result is
Invalid and must be repeated.
The valid maximum cycle settings (assay cut-offs) for the Xpert SA Nasal
Complete targets (spa, mecA, and SCCmec) were derived from pre-clinical data
(n=736) collected using clinical specimens to maximize percent sensitivity and
percent specificity relative to enriched culture. The SA specificity was poor if the
spa Ct cut-off was moved from 35 (91.5%) to 36 (88.6%) and poor SA sensitivity
was calculated if the spa Ct cut-off was moved from 35 (92.7%) to 34 (90.0%).
These assay cut-offs were subsequently validated in the pivotal clinical study,
Protocol 128. The clinical study supports and validates the Ct cut-offs chosen for
spa, mecA, and SCCmec targets. From the analysis it is demonstrated that the
established assay settings maximize sensitivity (highest priority) and specificity.

3. Clinical studies:
Clinical Sensitivity/Specificity:
Performance characteristics were determined in a multi-site prospective
investigation study at eight US institutions by comparing the Xpert SA Nasal
Complete Assay with Reference Culture. Double swabs were collected from
each subject. One swab was tested by the Xpert SA Nasal Complete Assay at
the enrolling center and the other swab was sent to the central laboratory for
Reference Culture testing.
At the centralized laboratory, the specimen was enriched overnight in
trypticase soy broth with 6.5% NaCl. The trypticase soy broth was then
streaked onto a sheep blood agar plate. Confirmation of presumptive positive
colonies was performed with catalase, tube coagulase, and Gram stain. MecA-
Mediated Oxacillin resistance was tested by disk diffusion test using a 30μg
cefoxitin disk and cutoff of ≤21 mm (R), ≥22 mm (S).
Performance of the Xpert SA Nasal Complete Assay was calculated relative to
the Reference Culture (enriched blood agar culture) results. The overall
performance of the Xpert SA Nasal Complete Assay relative to direct
CHROMagar, and enriched CHROMagar methods was for information only.
Overall Results
A total of 2487 specimens were tested for MRSA and SA by Xpert the SA
Nasal Complete Assay and enriched blood agar culture. Among the eligible
2487 cases, there were 141 subjects who had antibiotic use within 7 to 21 days
prior to sample collection, 2323 subjects with confirmed no antibiotic use, and
23 cases of unknown antibiotic status. There was no statistically significant
difference in the culture positivity rate or the Xpert SA Nasal Complete Assay
performance based on antibiotic status.
The performance of the Xpert SA Nasal Complete Assay is summarized in the tables
below:

Of the Xpert Assays run on eligible specimens, 96.5% (2487/2578) of
these specimens were successful on the first attempt. The remaining 91
gave indeterminate results on the first attempt (31 “INVALID”, 51
“ERROR” and 9 “NO RESULT”). The study design did not allow for
repeat testing.
Empty Cassette Variants
There were 14 isolates that fit the empty cassette profile (i.e. spa positive,
SCCmec positive, mecA negative) in the clinical studies. All of the 14 specimens
were verified true negative MRSA isolates, and true positive SA isolates relative
to Reference Culture.

I-CORE® module Performs PCR amplification and detection. As the user inserts the cartridge
into the system, the reaction tube component of the cartridge is inserted into
the I-CORE module. After sample preparation within the cartridge, the sample
and reagent mixture is transferred from the cartridge chamber into the reaction
tube. During the amplification process, the I-CORE heater heats up and the
fan cools down the reaction tube contents. Two optical blocks positioned
within the ICORE excite the dye molecules that make up the probes and detect
the fluorescence emitted. The system uses calibration and data analysis
algorithms to determine a relative fluorescence value for each reporter dye
after each thermal cycle.

5. Calibration:
Optical and thermal calibration of the GeneXpert Dx System is performed by
Cepheid at the time of manufacture prior to installation and once yearly or after
1000 runs per module. The user does not calibrate or perform any serviceable
functions on the instrument. The normalization function compensates for any
optical degradation between calibrations.
The thermal reaction chamber thermistors are calibrated to ± 0.50ºC using
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-traceable standards.
During the manufacturing process, the temperature of the heating system is
measured at two temperatures: 60ºC and 95ºC. Calibration coefficients that
correct for small errors in the raw thermistor readings of the heaters are stored in
the memory of each I-CORE module.
The optical system is calibrated using standard concentrations of individual
unquenched fluorescent dye-oligos. For each optical channel, the signal
produced by a tube alone (the blank signal) is subtracted from the raw signal
produced by the dye-oligo standard to determine the spectral characteristics.
Using the individual spectral characteristics of the pure dye-oligos, signals from
an unknown mixture of dye-oligos can be resolved into corrected signals for the
individual dye-oligos in the mixture.
6. Quality Control:
The Xpert SA Nasal Complete Assay test includes a Sample Processing Control
(SPC) and Probe Check Control (PCC) pre-loaded in the cartridge and provided
with the assay.
The SPC verifies that conditions adequate for the processing of the target SA and
MRSA bacteria have occurred. It consists of Bacillus globigii spores formulated
into a dry reagent bead included in each Xpert SA Nasal Complete cartridge.
Furthermore the SPC verifies (1) the effectiveness of each sample preparation
step, (2) reaction tube filling, (3) that all reaction components are present and
functioning, and monitors the presence of potential inhibitor(s) in the PCR assay.
The Probe Check Control (PCC) verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling in
the cartridge, probe integrity, and dye stability. The PCC is considered to PASS

I-CORE® module	Performs PCR amplification and detection. As the user inserts the cartridge
into the system, the reaction tube component of the cartridge is inserted into
the I-CORE module. After sample preparation within the cartridge, the sample
and reagent mixture is transferred from the cartridge chamber into the reaction
tube. During the amplification process, the I-CORE heater heats up and the
fan cools down the reaction tube contents. Two optical blocks positioned
within the ICORE excite the dye molecules that make up the probes and detect
the fluorescence emitted. The system uses calibration and data analysis
algorithms to determine a relative fluorescence value for each reporter dye
after each thermal cycle.

if the fluorescence generated meets the validated acceptance criteria. If the PCC
fails for any SA or MRSA target or SPC, a probe check error is reported and the
test will not continue. For these conditions, the test will need to be repeated using
a new specimen, a new cartridge and new reagents.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Shelf-life
The Xpert MRSA/SA Assay shelf-life was demonstrated in stability studies using
real-time stability results and linear regression analysis to support a shelf-life of 12
months when the reagents and cartridge are stored at 2-28°C; open package for up to
24 hours at 2-28°C. Currently there are three lots that have 9 months of real time
data, and one lot has 12 months of real time data.
The stability of the product is being evaluated at four temperatures (5° ± 3°C, 25° ±
3°C, 35° ± 3°C and 45°± 3°C) at predefined time point intervals up to 36 months
following the study plan described in the 510k submission. One lot has an extra time
point for both 4°C and 25°C storage conditions.
A Specimen Stability study was conducted to establish specimen transport and
storage claims for the Xpert SA Nasal Complete Assay. The following collection
device types were tested:
LSD: Liquid Stuart-Dry (Cepheid Sample Collection Device)
LSW: Liquid Stuart-Wet (swab pre-moistened with sterile 0.9% NaCl solution)
LAW: Liquid Amies-Wet (swab pre-moistened with the provided transport
medium)
The recommended storage conditions are room temperature (15 - 28°C) of up to
24 hours or refrigerated 2-8°C for up to five days. The study supported this
claim.
Failure Modes Testing was performed to determine the effect of failure modes
that might occur with the Xpert SA Nasal Complete Assay. Failures may be due
to operator errors, manufacturing errors or instrument malfunction.
Operator error might include adding an insufficient amount of reagent to the
cartridge or omitting a liquid reagent or adding a liquid reagent to the wrong
chamber.
A manufacturing error might result in beads being loaded incorrectly into the
cartridge before packaging (missing beads or double beads), or a cartridge being
assembled incorrectly (missing the filter required for cell capture).
An instrument malfunction examples include an ultrasonic horn failure, motion of
the syringe drive not detected, syringe pressure reading exceeds protocol limit, the
system failed to find the plunger home position, a valve positioning error was
detected, digital temperature reading of thermistor(s) not within acceptable range,
and the optical signal from the detector(s) did not reach the expected value.
Because the software performs self-check procedures prior to the start of each

test, if any of the instrument malfunctions described above occur the test is
aborted; no assay results are reported.
Replicates of eight (8) MRSA negative and eight (8) MRSA positive samples
were tested per condition. Positive samples contained MRSA cells at ~600
CFU/test. Results are compared to positive and negative controls in which all
cartridges are assembled correctly (1 EZR- enzyme bead, 1 TSR-primer/probe
bead, 1 SPC- sample processing bead, and a capture filter) and all liquid reagents
(reagent 1, reagent 2, and elution buffer) are dispensed correctly and completely.
Of the 354 runs, 3 provided uninformative GeneXpert results (Error). Errors
consisted of 1 pressure abort, 1 probe check control error, and 1 valve positioning
error.
