L. Test Principle:
The CYFRA 21-1 EIA is a solid phase, non-competitive immunoassay based on two
monoclonal antibodies (derived from mice) directed against two separate antigenic
determinants of soluble fragments of cytokeratin 19. Calibrators, controls and patient
samples are incubated together with biotinylated anti-CYFRA 21-1 MAb and
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeled anti-CYFRA 21-1 mAb in streptavidin coated
micro strips. After washing, buffered Substrate/Chromogen reagent (hydrogen
peroxide and 3, 3', 5, 5' tetramethylbenzidine) is added to each well and the enzyme
reaction is allowed to proceed. During the enzyme reaction a blue color will develop
if antigen is present. The intensity of the color development is proportional to the
amount of CYFRA 21-1 present in the samples. The color intensity is determined in a
microplate spectrophotometer at 620 nm (or optionally at 405 nm after addition of
Stop Solution). Calibration curves are constructed for each assay by plotting
absorbance value versus the concentration for each calibrator. The CYFRA 21-1
concentrations of unknown samples are then read from the calibration curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision evaluation was carried out in three laboratory sites. At sites 1
2

--- Page 3 ---
and 2, the study comprised of 2 kit lots, 20 days for each lot, 2 runs (separated
by a minimum of 2 hours) per day and duplicate assays for a total of 160
assays. The third site differed in that 3 lots were used, 10 days for each lot (for
a total of 30 days), 2 runs (separated by a minimum of 2 hours) per day, in
duplicate, for a total of 120 assays.
For sites 1 and 2, sample panels consisting of pleural effusion from four
(distinct) patients were spiked into normal human serum. For site 3 panels
consisted of pleural effusion/serum mixtures, serum, or a calibrator/serum
mixture were used. For this study a total of 8 panels were analyzed.
The precision analyses for Site 1 have determined that the total precision for
both lots combined as well as individually is < 8.5% for the panels in this
study. The total precision for the 4 panels in the study ranged from 2.8% to
5.4% and 3.5% to 6.4% for Lots 1 and 2, respectively, for their individual lot
comparisons with 95% Upper Confidence Limits in the range of 3.3% to 6.4%
for Lot 1 and 4.2% to 7.5% for Lot 2. The total precision for the 2 controls in
the study ranged from 2.5% to 4.8% and 3.2% to 5.3% for Lots 1 and 2,
respectively, for their individual lot comparisons with 95% Upper Confidence
Limits in the range of 3.0% to 5.7% for Lot 1 and 3.7% to 6.3% for Lot 2. For
the combined lot data, the total precision of the 4 panels ranged from 5.1% to
8.4% with 95% Upper Confidence Limits ranging from 5.8% to 9.4%. As a
result, the CYFRA 21-1 EIA Kit meets the predetermined acceptance criteria
of CV and supports the performance claims of the assay.
The precision analyses for Site 2 has determined that the total precision for
both lots combined as well as individually is less than or equal to 10.6% for
all controls and panels in this study. The total precision for the 4 panels in the
study ranged from 4.6% to 7.9% and 5.1% to 10.6% for Lots 1 and 2,
respectively, for their individual lot comparisons with 95% Upper Confidence
Limits in the range of 5.4% to 9.3% for Lot 1 and 6.1% to 12.6% for Lot 2.
The total precision for the 2 controls in the study ranged from 4.7% to 6.1%
and 5.4% to 6.6% for Lots 1 and 2, respectively for their individual lot
comparisons with 95% Upper Confidence Limits in the range of 5.6% to 7.2%
for Lot 1 and 6.4% to 7.9% for Lot 2. For the combined lot data, the total
precision of the 4 panels ranged from 6.2% to 10.5% with 95% Upper
Confidence Limits ranging from 6.9% to 11.8%. As a result, the CYFRA 21-1
EIA Kit meets the predetermined acceptance criteria of CV and supports the
performance claims of the assay.
For Site 3 the average total precision of the CYFRA 21-1 EIA Kit for the
eight (8) panel members ≥ 0.5 ng/mL across 3 kit lots in this study was
calculated to be in the range of 5.7% and 9.2% CV. As a result, the CYFRA
21-1 EIA Kit meets the predetermined acceptance criteria of ≥ 20% total CV.
Additional imprecision at the lower range of the CYFRA 21-1 EIA Kit ( 0.31-
3

--- Page 4 ---
1.49ng/mL) was determined at the manufacturer’s site by testing each low
panel in replicates of two (2), using two (2) lots of CYFRA 21-1 EIA Kits at
two (2) separate times per day, for twenty (20) days. Three (3) technicians
participated in the study. The order of the samples was changed for each run.
(n=80 per sample). The total imprecision of the CYFRA 21-1 EIA Kit within
this range was calculated to be in the range of 6.7% and 10.6% CV.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A study was conducted to evaluate the dilution linearity within the CYFRA
21-1 EIA Kit assay range. CLSI guideline, EP6-A entitled “Evaluation of the
Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach;
Approved Guideline,” was used as a guide. Five (5) serum samples with
elevated CYFRA 21-1 values were diluted with CYFRA 21-1 Calibrator A
(Kit Sample Diluent) following the dilution scheme shown in the table below:
Dilution Dilution Scheme Dilution Factor

The diluted samples indicated in the table above were tested as unknowns
with the CYFRA 21-1 EIA Kit, in replicates ranging from 4 to 8 per sample.
Five (5) samples with elevated CYFRA 21-1 were tested. The results obtained
from these samples are shown in the table below:

i. Reportable Assay range:
Based on the data in the table above, the nonlinearity calculated by
weighted polynomial regression was ≤ 10% across the measurement range
of 0.5 to 50ng/mL. As a result the reportable range was set as 0.5 to 50
ng/mL.
ii. High Dose Hook Effect
A study was conducted to determine the interference that may be caused
by extreme levels of analyte in the CYFRA 21-1 EIA Kit resulting in false
low levels in the assay. Five (5) serum samples with elevated CYFRA 21-
1 levels were used in this study. These samples were diluted 1:2, 1:4, 1:8,
1:16, 1:32, 1:64, and 1:128 with human serum. The dilution samples and
the corresponding neat (undiluted) samples were tested as unknowns with
the CYFRA 21-1 EIA Kit, in replicates of two (2) with two (2) CYFRA
21-1 EIA Kit lots. The CYFRA 21-1 EIA Kit Controls were tested and
evaluated for each assay to determine assay validity.
The mean concentration was calculated from the sample values obtained
for the two (2) replicates for each dilution and the corresponding neat
(undiluted) sample. The concentrations of each of the five (5) elevated
serum samples were calculated using the average of the values for the
dilution series that fell within the range of the CYFRA 21-1 EIA Kit. The
average concentration was used to evaluate the samples falling outside the
range of the CYFRA 21-1 EIA Kit. NOTE: The theoretical Sample D
concentration was calculated using the same dilutions as the other samples
for consistency.
The hook concentration was determined as the highest concentration with
an absorbance >10% of the highest CYFRA 21-1 Calibrator. The
absorbance of the highest CYFRA 21-1 Calibrator (CYFRA 21-1
Calibrator F), at both wavelengths, were used to calculate the limit of the
hook concentration and are shown in the table below.

Results showed all elevated samples were above the limit of hook
concentration. No high dose hook effect was observed in samples up to
1100 ng/mL CYFRA 21-1 antigen.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i. Tracebility:
There is no recognized reference standard for CYFRA 21-1. The
concentration of the CYFRA 21-1 EIA primary calibrators has been
assigned by using Roche CK19 antigen. The methods used for value
assignment of the CYFRA 21 primary and secondary calibrators were
provided.
ii. Calibrators:
Cytokeratin 19 (CK19) has a molecular weight of approximately 30,000
daltons. The CK19 (from a commercial source) used to prepare calibrators
for the CYFRA 21-1 immunoassay, corresponds to the cytokeratin from
the human cell line MCF-7.
The primary reference standards (calibrators) are held as a reference set
from which the CYFRA 21-1 stock solution for the secondary reference
sets of calibrators are determined using a calibrating factor. The secondary
calibrators are used to manufacture and value assign all sets of calibrators
to be included in CYFRA 21-1 EIA kits. (CYFRA 21-1 EIA Kit
Calibrators).
The concentration of the CYFRA 21-1 EIA Primary Calibrators has been
assigned based on the original Roche CK19 Antigen concentration. The
CYFRA 21-1 EIA Primary Calibrator s were held as a reference set from
which the CK19 stock solution for the Secondary sets of calibrators was
prepared using a calibration factor. Each CYFRA 21-1 EIA secondary
calibrator level was manufactured gravimetrically using a CK19 antigen
stock to the concentrations 0, 1.5, 5.0, 15, 25 and 50 ng/mL.
Calibrator set (1 Vial each) consists of CAL A to CAL F. CAL A (0
ng/mL) is ready-to-use and should also be used for dilution of samples.
CAL B-F are lyophilized and require reconstitution before use. In
addition, the CYFRA 21-1 concentration of CAL B-F is lot specific and is
indicated on the label of each vial. Target concentrations for CAL B to F
are 1.5, 5, 15, 25 and 50 ng/mL.

d. Detection limit:
i. Limit of Blank (LoB)
The CYFRA 21-1 EIA Kit Calibrator A was run in replicates of twelve
(12) over the course of four (4) days for a total of nine (9) assays using
three (3) CYFRA 21-1 EIA kit combinations. Three (3) lots of CYFRA 21-
1 EIA Kit Calibrator A were used in the study for a total of 108 replicates.
The LoB was determined to be 0.06 ng/mL using the 95th percentile
approach.
ii. Limit of Detection (LoD)
A five (5) member low level panel set (see panel table below) was run in
replicates of twelve (12) over the course of four (4) days for a total of nine
(9) assays using three (3) CYFRA 21-1 EIA kit combinations for a total of
108 replicates/panel member.
The above study was combined with the previous study where a three (3)
member low level panel set (see panel table below) was run in replicates
of two (2), using two (2) lots of CYFRA 21-1 EIA Kits at two (2) separate
times per day, for twenty (20) days for a total 80 replicates/per panel
member.
Panel Mean (ng/mL) Standard Total n
Member Deviation
LoD-1 0.16 0.050996 108
LoD-2 0.22 0.046342 108
LoD-3 0.28 0.040833 108
LoD-4 0.32 0.041549 108
LoD-5 0.40 0.028551 108

FDL5 0.16 0.034048 80
FDL6 0.07 0.024007 80
Total Standard Deviation 0.037
(n=8)
Using the formula LoD = LoB + 1.645 * S.D. Panel set [LoD = 0.06 + (1.645
* 0.037) = 0.12 ng/mL], the Limit of Detection of the CYFRA 21-1 EIA was
determined to be 0.12 ng/mL.
iii Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
The LoQ was determined by recalculating the data using the expanded set
from the LoD study above and the definition of the analyte concentration
at which the coefficient of variation is 17.78%. The expanded data set
from which the LoD is defined shows that the assay standard deviation is
0.037 ng/mL over the range of values encompassing the LoQ. Thus, the
LoQ is given by the equation LoQ = 0.037 / 0.1778 = 0.21 ng/mL.

positive for HAMA (80.7 to 291.3 ng/mL) and five specimens positive for RF
(22.2 to 54.63 IU/mL) were evaluated for % recovery with CYFRA 21-1
antigen spiked into each specimen at approximately 5 and 25 ng/mL. Mean
recovery results are summarized in the following table.*

The effectiveness of the CYFRA 21-1 EIA as an aid in monitoring the course of
disease in lung cancer patients was determined through a retrospective clinical
study by correlating changes in CYFRA 21-1 levels in serial serum samples to
changes in disease status. Remnant serial serum samples were obtained from a
tertiary cancer center from lung cancer subjects who met the specified inclusion
and exclusion criteria (see below).
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The patient inclusion criteria are:
• Eighteen years of age or older
• Diagnosed with lung cancer
• Minimum of 3 serial draws available
• Appropriate clinical data
• Minimum 0.4 mL volume of serum available
• Normal appearance of sample
The exclusion criteria are:
• No diagnosis of lung cancer
• Less than 3 serial draws available
• Insufficient sample volume
• Multiple freeze-thaw cycles
• Icteric, lipemic, hemolytic, substantial particulates
Subject sample draws could be at various stages of the disease, including pre-
treatment, during treatment, or standard of care follow-up. Subject samples could
have been drawn either during therapy, or following the completion of therapy for
the treatment of lung cancer. Subjects who had samples drawn at either time point
with corresponding clinical data were included.
The clinical data collected for each subject included the following: patient ID,
date of birth, gender, race/ethnicity, smoking status, including smoking history
and date of smoking cessation, date of lung cancer diagnosis, histology, grade,
and stage. For each subject sample draw, the following information was collected:
chemotherapeutic treatment information (onset date, end date, regimen), imaging
information (date, type, findings, disease status), physical exam date and findings,
sample draw date, procedure information (type, date and findings), Clinical
Disease Status, date of recurrence, and date of death (if subject expired).
Study Samples
The sample size was calculated to be approximately 100 subjects with a minimum
of 3 draws per subject. A clinician assessment was made at each draw and each
subject draw was categorized into 1 of the following subgroups:
1. Subjects with no evidence of disease (NED) for their lung cancer who are
being monitored for recurrence in follow-up after therapy. This will include
subjects who eventually recur while being followed and those that do not
11

--- Page 12 ---
recur during the follow-up period. NED is defined as a complete lack of
clinical evidence of disease.
2. Subjects with evidence of residual but stable disease during or after therapy at
visit. Stable Disease is defined as clinical evidence that the disease has not
changed since last assessment.
3. Subjects with progressive disease while on therapy or subjects recurring while
in follow-up after therapy. Progressive Disease is defined as clinical evidence
of growth in the primary tumor or the appearance of new tumors since the last
assessment.
4. Subjects with responsive disease while on therapy (responders). Responding
Disease is defined as clinical evidence that there is a shrinking of the primary
tumor and no evidence of new tumors.
A total of 437 samples for 104 subjects were obtained. All samples were tested
for CYFRA 21-1 levels. A total of 414 samples from 100 subjects were used for
the data analysis for disease progression. Twenty-three (23) samples from 4
subjects were excluded for the following reasons:
• 12 samples from 3 non-lung cancer patients
• 3 samples from 1 patient were excluded due to being drawn on the
same date
• 7 samples had the same draw date as another sample
• 1 sample received in error
Sample Draw
There was a total of 414 draws for the 100 subjects resulting in a total of 314
observation pairs. The mean number of draws per subject was 4.1 ranging from 3
to 8 draws. The length of time over which the subjects were monitored ranged
from 23 days to 2174 days (median of 198 days). The median interval between
successive visits was 49 days ranging from 1 day to 1878 days. On average, each
subject had blood drawn for CYFRA 21-1 testing at a baseline and 3 follow-up
visits, spaced at an average of 101 days.

Disease Stage
For the 100 lung cancer cases, 95 were classified as non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) and 5 were classified as small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Ninety (90) of
the NSCLC were further classified as adenocarcinoma (68), squamous cell
carcinoma (19), and large cell carcinoma (3). Seventy-nine (79) of the 100 lung
cancer cases had staging information as shown in the following table. In this
study, only 5 patients had Stage I or II disease, and as a consequence the
performance of CYFRA 21-1 has not been adequately assessed in these
subpopulations.

Clinical Performance Characteristics
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
Analysis of Disease Progression
Progressive disease in this study was defined as clinical evidence of growth in
the primary tumor or the appearance of new tumors since the last
assessment. All imaging was reviewed and assessed by the ordering
radiologist at the time of collection. The nurses reviewed the imaging reports
and used the clinical information provided regarding tumor growth and
overall evaluation.
The hypothesis was that progression leads to an increase in CYFRA 21-1, so
the diagnostic rule investigated in the clinical study was to classify patients for
disease progression if their CYFRA 21-1 level was statistically significantly
higher at any visit than at the preceding visit and as not suspect if this was not
the case. The success criterion was a total concordance probability of at least
65% with the 95% confidence interval (CI) being 67.5 to 78.2%. A positive
change in CYFRA 21-1 was defined as a measurable increase in the value that
was at least 50% greater than the previous value of the test. Observation pairs
with both values below the normal reference range of 1.8 ng/mL were defined
as no significant change. This level of change takes into account the
variability of the assay and the biological variability and is based on the
published report of Trapé et al. (Clinical Chemistry 51, pgs. 219-222, 2005).
Per-visit analysis
The cutoff value of 50% increase was used to categorize the successive
CYFRA 21-1 readings into those that were and were not significantly
elevated, and cross-tabulated against progression or no progression. The No
Progression category included patients with clinical status of NED, stable and
responding to treatment. The following table presents the data in a 2 x 2
format comparing the concordance between the CYFRA 21-1 value and the
clinical assessment of disease progression. The Total values represent the total
number of samples for that category. This table does not include the first

sample drawn for all 100 subjects as the calculations are based on the changes
from visit to visit. (414 total draws minus the first draw (100 patients) = 314
total measurements). Results showed that 46% (39/85) of the patient samples
with a positive change correlated with the disease progression while 87%
(200/229) of the patient serial samples with no significant change in CYFRA
21-1 value correlated with no progression. The total concordance was 76%
(239/314).

The table below summarizes statistics of the CYFRA 21-1 ratio for draws
broken down by clinical disease status. These summary statistics conform to
the expected pattern:
a. The NED and Stable subjects have very similar summary statistics,
b. Three quarters of the patient visits showing disease progression had an
increase in CYFRA 21-1,
c. Between a half and three quarters of visits in which the subject was
responding to treatment, showed a decrease in CYFRA 21-1.

ROC analysis showed the area under the curve was 0.72 with a standard error
of 0.03. The cutoff of a 50% increase in CYFRA 21-1 gives a sensitivity of
45.9% with specificity 87.3%.

In summary, the clinical study results support the intended use of “ The
CYFRA 21-1 EIA kit is intended for the quantitative determination of soluble
cytokeratin 19 fragments in human serum. The assay is to be used as an aid in
monitoring the disease progression during the course of disease and treatment
in lung cancer patients. Serial testing for patient CYFRA 21-1 assay values
should be used in conjunction with other clinical methods used for monitoring
lung cancer.”

5. Expected values/Reference range:
To determine the upper level of normal for the CYFRA 21-1 EIA assay 75
patients with benign lung disease and 120 patients with lung cancer were tested.
The patient subgroups are listed in the table below:

The samples were tested in duplicate using the CYFRA21-1 EIA kit according
to the proposed package insert. One (1) CYFRA 21-1 EIA Kit was used in the
study. The individual sample replicates were evaluated using valid calibration
curves and the mean of two (2) replicates was calculated. The samples used
were obtained by commercial vendors that were collected under an IRB
approval protocol. The primary approach to determine the upper limit of
normal for the assay was a nonparametric one. In this, calculations of the 95th
and 97.5th percentiles were performed for the overall set of the apparently
healthy individuals.

Based on this data it was determined that the CYFRA 21-1 EIA value that
corresponded most closely to the 95th percentile for the overall group of
apparently healthy individuals, that is 1.8 ng/mL, would be used for defining
the upper limit of normal. It is recommended that each laboratory establish its
own reference value for the population of interest.
875 serum patient specimens with various conditions were assessed using the
CYFRA 21-1 EIA Kit to establish the reference ranges. The following patient
cohorts were assembled to determine the distribution of the serum CYFRA
21-1 EIA Kit values in various benign and malignant conditions.
