screening device for one-time use. The detector is available at several detection cut-
offs: 0.02, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.10 relative percent Blood Alcohol
Concentration (BAC). The device is used only as a screening device and is only an
indication of the possible presence of alcohol in the blood of the test subject.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For Over the Counter use
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable.
I. Device Description:
The Contralco Alcohol Breath Tester device is made up of 2 parts: the reagent tube
and the plastic bag. Yellow crystals in the reagent tube are coated with Chromium VI
oxide and sulfuric acid. The amount of these indicator chemicals is adjusted
according to the selected cut-off of the tester. The user exhales into the reagent tube
and fills the plastic bag with exhaled air. A color change is produced when alcohol
vapors (squeezed from collected exhaled air in the plastic bag portion of the tester)
are oxidized to acetic acid and the indicator chemicals change to chromium sulfate.
The majority of crystals change from yellow to light green when alcohol vapors are
present at a level equal to or exceeding the labeled cut-off of the tester.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The Contralco alcohol breath tester contains chemicals that change color in the
presence of alcohol in human breath. First, the user pushes in both ends of the glass
tube, sliding them until the dotted lines. Secondly, the user blows into the blue valve,
filling the plastic bag with one breath only and completely inserts the blue perforation
of the glass tube into the blue valve. Thirdly, the user pushes the plastic bag slowly,
in about 12 seconds, until it is completely emptied. On contact with alcohol, the
reactant will turn green. Each device has a black line which indicates the cut-off
concentration for each device. If the green color reaches or exceeds the black line, the
user has exceeded the allowed limit of alcohol per liter of air.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor evaluated the precision and accuracy for each of the six
Contralco Alcohol Breath Testers (0.02, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.1%
BAC) using a Breath Alcohol Sample Simulator, which provides an alcohol-
in-air test sample with known alcohol concentrations, flow rate, and air
composition. On contact with alcohol, the reactant will turn green. Each
device has a black line which indicates the cut-off concentration for each
device. If the green color reaches or exceeds the black line, the user has
exceeded the cut-off concentration and the result is considered positive. If the

green color fails to reach the black line, the result is considered negative.
Testing was performed by 10 individuals under 5 different lighting sources
using 20 Contralco Breath Alcohol Testers at each cutoff concentration. The
concentrations used were 0% BAC, 60% below the cut-off concentration, and
60% above the cut-off concentration.
The table below shows the number of devices that resulted in the expected
outcome (negative or positive) of the number of devices evaluated.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. The assay is a semi-quantitative assay.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The concentrations are prepared from commercially available solutions and
are verified on certified evidential breath alcohol testers. These solutions are
used to verify the cut-off concentration of the devices during manufacture.
The sponsor performed a stability assessment of all devices (0.02, 0.04, 0.05,
0.06, 0.08, and 0.1 % BAC) to evaluate the stability of the breath alcohol test
results over time. This study served to validate the reported read time window
claim of 2 to 15 minutes provided on the device labeling. Using simulated
breath, (50) samples that were 60% below the device cut-off and (50) samples
that were 60% above the cut-off were randomized and blinded prior to
interpretation by (5) individuals at the end of 2, 5, 8, 11, and 15 minutes.
Identical results were obtained for all devices at each time point tested. The
results are presented in the table below:

8 min 50/50 Negative 50/50 Positive
11 min 50/50 Negative 50/50 Positive
15 min 50/50 Negative 50/50 Positive
d. Detection limit:
The NHTSA guidelines do not specifically address the detection limit of
breath alcohol devices but require testing at a % BAC of zero (blank reading)
to assess the possibility of false positives. The sponsor included a zero
concentration sample in their precision study above. Non-alcoholic breath was
used as the sample. There were no false positives observed when measuring
zero concentration samples.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed the following studies for each cut-off concentration
(0.02, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.08, 0.10 %BAC) to evaluate the potential
interference on the test results from cigarette smoke, temperature, and
vibration.
Cigarette Smoke – (5) alcohol-free volunteers were asked to conduct (4)
breath alcohol tests for each device cut-off concentration while smoking a
cigarette. The testing was spread out to cover the duration of time it took to
completely smoke a cigarette. The Contralco Alcohol Breath Testers produced
no false positive or false negative results under these conditions.
Temperature – The sponsor assessed the effect of temperature at 10 and 40°C.
A total of (40) different devices were stored and tested at each temperature for
each cut-off concentration. Using simulated breath, (20) samples that were
60% below the device cut-off and (20) samples that were 60% above the cut-
off were tested. The results are presented in the table below:

Vibration- A total of (40) different devices for each cut-off concentration were
placed in a box and mounted on a magnetic agitator for 5 minutes. Using
simulated breath, (20) samples that were 60% below the device cut-off and
(20) samples that were 60% above the cut-off were tested. The results are
presented in the table below:

0.08 20/20 Negative 20/20 Positive
0.1 20/20 Negative 20/20 Positive
As an added precaution, the device is wrapped inside a bag to protect the
tester from light. The manufacturer’s labeling instructs the user to wait 20
minutes after drinking before taking a reading, to avoid smoking during the
test, and to store the device in a dark place between 10°C and 40°C.
f. Assay cut-off:
Each device will produce a blue-green color at or above the following cut-off
concentration: 0.02, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.08, 0.10 % BAC.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor performed a consumer study to determine if consumers could
correctly use and interpret the device using only the supplied User’s Manual,
and to compare the results to a professional quantitative device (the LION
device). The study was conducted at the exit of a nightclub. Each participant
took their breath alcohol reading with the 0.05% Contralco tester and recorded
their result. Immediately afterward, the participants were administered a
breath alcohol test using the LION operated by a trained individual. A total of
