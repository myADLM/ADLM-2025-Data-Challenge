L. Test Principle:
The assay is a solid-phase, two-step, chemiluminiscent immunoassay that exploits
liquid phase kinetics in a bead format. The allergens are covalently bound to a soluble
polymer/co-polymer matrix, which is labeled with a ligand. The assay specific
antibody is labeled with alkaline phosphatase. The use of an amino acid co-polymer
amplifies the amount of allergen that the matrix can support. The chemiluminiscent
detection system is a phosphatase ester of stabilized dioxatane. Cleavage of the
phosphate ester by alkaline phosphatase results in the decomposition of dioxatane and
the emission of photons, which are quantified by a luminometer.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility of the assay was assessed by testing three positive samples
and one negative control sample of each (Apricot, Asparagus, Blueberry,
Cauliflower, Chili Pepper, Chub Mackerel, Ginger, Lime, Perch, Whey) in
duplicate twice a day for 20 different days (n = 80).
The sponsor’s criterion for the negative sample was the average dose level
must be <0.10 kU/L; all negative sample mean results were within the
acceptance criterion. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion for the positive
samples was ≤15% CV for both within-run and total precision. Three allergen
lots were tested for each allergen; representative data from one lot is shown
below for the positive samples. The intra-assay and inter-assay %CV ranges
were from 2.46% to 9.15 % and 2.76% to 11.47%, respectively (see tables
below).

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The calibrators and controls are traceable to the WHO 2nd IRP
75/502 reference standard for human IgE.
Stability:
Allergen stability: Accelerated allergen stability testing (15-25ºC for 57 days;
assay kits stored at recommended temperature 2-8ºC). The accelerated study
supports a two year shelf-life stability claim.
On-board/ open stability:
Testing was performed for 21 days. On-going data collection is for >90 days.
Current study supports the 21 day stability claim.
Testings were performed on two positive samples and one negative sample on
days 1, 7, 14, 21, 30, 45, 60, 75, 91 for each individual specific allergen.
Stability studies support the 90 day stability claim.
Adjustment interval (calibration curve) stability: Testing was performed at
days 1 and 14 to validate the 2-week adjustment interval. The calibration
curve stability study supports the 2 weeks stability claim.
Sample stability: Stress conditions representing the storage claims were set up
at 3 and 7 days at 2-8ºC and 6 months at -20ºC. No significant variation to the
reference samples that were run at day 0 was observed. The sample stability
study supports the 7 days at 2-8ºC and 6 months at -20ºC stability claims.

were performed to estimate the LoB. A total of three instruments were used
per run. The maximum dose of the LoB was selected as the most conservative
LoB: LoB = 0.026 kU/L. The claimed LoB is 0.1 kU/L.
MAX
Limit of Detection (LoD): Five samples were used to estimate the LoD. Sixty
replicates of each sample were assayed per run. A total of 2 runs were
completed with testing performed on 2 different instruments. The LoD was
calculated for each sample using the formula: LoD = LoB + (1.65 *
MAX
SD ) The claimed LoD is 0.1 kU/L
LOD .
e. Analytical specificity:
Inhibition studies: Specificity of each allergen was verified through
competitive inhibition testing using a single serum sample or a serum pool. A
negative sample was used to measure the background response.
To initiate the inhibition experiment, 70 µL of undiluted and 3-4 levels of 5-
fold serially diluted inhibitor extract were mixed with 250 µL of sample or
pool to achieve final inhibitor concentrations of 218.75, 43.75, 8.75, 1.75,
0.35, 0.08, 0.07, 0.02, 0.01, 0.003 μg/mL inhibitor. This mixture was
incubated at room temperature (15-28°C) for 1 hour allowing the
immunological reaction to occur. Each sample mixture containing the
inhibitor extract and the appropriate controls was assayed with 1 lot of each
allergen. The percent (%) inhibition was calculated according to the following
formula:
(Response of pos. control – sample response with inhibitor extract)
(pos. sample – neg. sample) X 100
(Response of pos. control )
(pos. sample – neg. sample)
The inhibition plots demonstrate that the allergens tested are inhibited by the
relevant inhibitor extract in a concentration dependent fashion. Also, the target
% inhibition of 50% for the highest inhibitor concentration tested was met.
These results indicate specificity of Apricot, Asparagus, Blueberry,
Cauliflower, Chili Pepper, Chub Mackerel, Ginger, Lime, Perch and Whey
allergens.
Additional inhibition studies were conducted to show that the specific allergens
are not cross-reacting to the unrelated allergens. Testing was performed using one
positive sample with three unrelated allergen extracts at 1 mg/mL. A negative
sample was used to measure the background response. Results on the positive
sample for the following specific allergens were below 9.9%: Apricot,
Asparagus, Blueberry, Cauliflower, Chili Pepper, Chub Mackerel, Ginger,
Lime, Perch and Whey.
Cross-reactivity: The manufacturer states there is no detectable crossreactivity
with human serum immunoglobulins IgG, IgA, IgM or IgD at normal
physiological levels.

a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity
Clinical performance of the IMMULITE® 2000 3gAllergy Specific IgE assay
for Apricot, Asparagus, Blueberry, Cauliflower, Chili Pepper, Chub Mackerel,
Ginger, Lime, Perch, Whey allergens was demonstrated by testing samples
from non-atopic and atopic individuals. Atopic patients were selected from
patients who had clinical documentation of allergy to specific allergen(s) or
allergen group of interest and/or positive skin prick/ scratch test to specific
allergen(s) of interest evaluated as 2+ or greater. Information on the skin test
allergen extracts (crude or purified) was not documented. Non-atopic patients
were clinically known non-allergic or total IgE <130 ng/mL or 54 IU/mL (2.4
ng = 1 IU). Testing was performed on 150 samples for Apricot, 148 samples
for Asparagus, 148 samples for Blueberry, 138 samples for Cauliflower, 136
samples for Chili Pepper, 136 samples for Chub Mackerel, 130 samples for
Ginger, 143 samples for Lime, 136 samples for Perch, and 133 samples for
Whey.

status, are shown in the tables below:
