P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
The sponsor conducted bench testing for full memory download and rollover for data
accuracy, using CareSens II and N meters and confirmed that data were transferred
accurately in both tests and no other problems were detected.
In addition, 30 participants with varying demographics (age, sex, and education level)
are included for consumer field testing study. The study was carried out with the
participants who can read at a middle school level (8th grade of USA) of English.
The user guide was used in the study (Flesch Kincaid Grade Level 5.7). All
participants evaluated the usability of the PC care™ program to be above average on
