The MEDTOX Buprenorphine Test uses immunochromatographic test
strips for the rapid, qualitative detection of buprenorphine and its
metabolites in human urine. It is intended for prescription use only. The
MEDTOX Buprenorphine Test is not for over the-counter sale. It is not
intended for use in point-of-care settings.
MEDTOX Buprenorphine detects buprenorphine and its metabolites at the
following cutoff concentrations:
BUP Buprenorphine (Buprenorphine) 10 ng/mL
The MEDTOX Buprenorphine Test provides only a preliminary analytical
test result. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used in
order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Liquid
chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) is the preferred
confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment
should be applied to any test result.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
As noted in the indications for use, the device is not intended for over the
counter sale and is not intended for use in point of care settings.
Tests for buprenorphine cannot distinguish between abused drugs and certain
prescribed medications.
4. Special instrument requirements:
None
I. Device Description:
The MEDTOX Buprenorphine Test contains a device with competitive, membrane-based
immunochromatographic test strips, a cup and a lid. Each test strip contains mouse
monoclonal antibody-colloidal gold, a drug conjugate and an internal procedural control
line. Each Test Kit contains all the reagents necessary to test one urine sample for
buprenorphine. A bag contains 25 test kits.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate device name(s): Acon BUP One Step Buprenorphine Test
2. Predicate 510(k) number(s): k060466
3. Comparison with predicate:
The intended use and method principles are the same as that of the predicate. The
specific reagents (e.g., antibodies) and details of the procedure (e.g., read time)
differ.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced.
L. Test Principle:
When the test system cup is tipped urine flows into the sample pads of the device, the
dried antibody-colloidal gold on the sample pad dissolves and the urine wicks up the
white test strips carrying the red antibody colloidal gold with it. When a drug is present in
the sample the antibody-colloidal gold binds the drug before it migrates up the test strip.
However, when the antibody-colloidal gold bind the drug in the urine, the antibody-
colloidal gold cannot bind to the drug conjugate immobilized on the test strip. When the
drug concentration is at or above the cutoff concentration, the majority of the antibody
colloidal gold is bound to the drug from the urine. Therefore, as drug bound antibody-
colloidal gold migrates up the test strip, it is unable to bind to the drug conjugate
immobilized on the membrane. Therefore no line is generated at the “T” location on the
device for a non-negative sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Samples containing commercial buprenorphine calibrator spiked into a drug-free
urine pool to the concentrations shown in the table below were tested with the
MEDTOX Buprenorphine Test. Sample concentrations > 5 ng/mL were also
confirmed by LCMS. Reproducibility testing was performed by three operators.
Each ran masked randomized samples across five days, using one lot, 3 operators;

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. This is a qualitative test. There is no high dose hook effect with
the MEDTOX Buprenorphine Test. Testing with spiked samples demonstrated
that the MEDTOX Buprenorphine Test provides positive results at concentrations
above those attainable in human urine.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Both real time and accelerated stability studies were performed. The
manufacturer’s acceptance criteria require that the control materials, including
those containing 5 and 15 ng/mL buprenorphine, must give the expected
qualitative result at the expiration date under the recommended storage conditions
(25 degrees C). Controls are prepared by adding known quantities of drug or
metabolite to a stabilized urine matrix. Levels of drug in each lot of controls are
confirmed by GC/MS or LC/MS/MS methods.

Control materials are listed as required but are not included with the kit.
d. Detection limit:
Evaluations were performed to determine the test detection limit, using multiple
lots and operators.
Buprenorphine (with purity certified by the manufacturer) was spiked into a
negative urine pool to the concentration levels shown in the table below. Each
concentration was tested 30 times in each of three lots by a total of 10 operators.
Results across lots are similar to those observed for the precision study (above).

e. Analytical specificity:
Studies were performed to test the effect of (1) potentially cross reactive
compounds and (2) potentially interfering endogenous and exogenous substances.
All compounds tested were obtained from commercial suppliers.
Potential Cross-reacting compounds:
The following potential cross-reactants and metabolites were prepared in negative
urine samples. Results are expressed as the minimum concentration expected to
produce a positive result in the indicated assay. The non-reacting opiate
compounds were also tested in the presence of 5 ng/mL (50% of the cutoff) and
15 ng/mL (150% of the cutoff) of Buprenorphine. Samples were evaluated in
triplicate by in-house operators. None of the nonreactive opiate listed in the
following table affected the expected results.

and 15 ng/mL buprenorphine. Most of the compounds were evaluated for
interference at 100 μg/mL (albumin was evaluated at 20 mg/mL and bilirubin was
evaluated at 200 μg/mL). Samples were evaluated in triplicate by in-house
operators. None of the endogenous compounds listed below affected the expected

Common prescription and OTC medications
Potential interference from common drugs was evaluated by adding 100,000
ng/mL of each drug tested into urine containing reference calibrator at
buprenorphine levels of 50% of cutoff and 150% of the cutoff concentration (5
and 15 ng/mL). Samples were evaluated in triplicate. None of the common drugs

pH and specific gravity:
Interference from pH was tested fortifying negative urine samples adjusted to pH
5.0, 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0 (± 0.1) with buprenorphine added at the 5 ng/mL of cutoff
and 15 ng/mL. These buprenorphine levels correspond to those at which >95%
negative and >95% positive results were observed, respectively. Interference
from specific gravity was tested by fortifying three negative urine samples,
adjusted to specific gravity values of 1.003, 1.015, and 1.030 ± 0.001, with
buprenorphine added at concentrations of 5 ng/mL and 15 ng/mL.
All samples were assayed in triplicate. No effect of pH or specific gravity was
observed in this evaluation.
f. Assay cut-off:
See Detection Limit Section, above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Samples used in the method comparison studies were leftover (de-linked) and
randomized clinical urine samples that had been submitted for drug testing and
contained varying concentrations of buprenorphine. Samples were assayed and
selected using both screening and confirmatory (LC/MS/MS) methods. All
samples containing buprenorphine (whether above or below the cutoff
concentration), were confirmed by LC/MS/MS. The LC/MS/MS determination
included buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine. There was one specimen obtained
per patient and one measurement taken per specimen.
The MEDTOX Buprenorphine Tests results were interpreted at both 5 minutes
and 15 minutes (covering the recommended read-time range), and identical results
were obtained at both time intervals.
The operator who performed the method comparison testing was representative of
those expected to perform such testing at the intended use sites, including
reference laboratories.
