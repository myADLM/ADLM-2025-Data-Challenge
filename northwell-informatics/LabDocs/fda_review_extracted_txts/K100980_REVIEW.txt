L. Test Principle:
The Invader® Factor V test combines target amplification by PCR using a third-party thermal
cycler with signal generation by the Invader Plus® chemistry and signal detection using
interpretative software and third-party fluorometer for genotyping of a single point mutation
(G to A at position 1691) of the human Factor V gene.
During the signal generation phase, a discriminatory Primary Probe transiently hybridizes to
the amplified target sequence along with an Invader® oligonucleotide, to form an overlapping
structure. The 5'-end of the Primary Probe includes a 5'-flap that does not hybridize to the
target DNA. The 3'-nucleotide of the bound Invader® oligonucleotide overlaps the Primary
Probe, and does not hybridize to the target DNA. The Cleavase® enzyme recognizes this
overlapping structure and cleaves off the unpaired 5'-flap of the Primary Probe, releasing it as
a target-specific product. The Primary Probe is designed to have a melting temperature
aligned with the Invader® reaction temperature so that under the isothermal reaction
conditions (~63°C) the Primary Probes cycle on and off the target DNA. This allows for
multiple rounds of Primary Probe cleavage for each DNA target resulting in an accumulation
of released 5'-flaps. The released 5'-flap transiently hybridizes with a corresponding
fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) cassette forming an overlapping structure that
is recognized and the fluorophore is cleaved from the FRET cassette by the Cleavase®
enzyme. The 5'-flap is designed to have a melting temperature aligned with the Invader®
reaction temperature, so that the 5'-flaps cycle on and off of the corresponding FRET
cassettes. This allows for multiple rounds of FRET cassette cleavage for each 5'-flap, and an

accumulation of released fluorophore. When the FRET cassette is cleaved, a fluorophore and
quencher are separated, generating detectable fluorescence signal.
The Invader® Factor V test uses two different discriminatory Primary Probes, one for the
mutant allele and one for the wild type allele. Each Primary Probe is assigned a unique 5'-
flap, and distinct FRET cassette, with a spectrally distinct fluorophore. The released 5'-flaps
will bind only to their respective FRET cassettes to generate a target-specific signal, linking
the wild type allele with one fluorophore (Fluorescence 1: RED) and the mutant allele with
the second fluorophore (Fluorescence 2: FAM).
The Invader® Factor V software, in combination with Invader® Call Reporter™ software, is a
data analysis software that provides a working template for the setup of reaction mixes and
sample placement, and following the import of fluorescence data, it determines results and
validity for controls and samples.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability/Reproducibility: Two operators each from 3 different sites (2 external
sites and 1 internal site) performed the testing in duplicate twice daily over 5 non-
consecutive days using the same testing materials including a panel of nine (9) whole
blood samples, representing all possible genotypes including three (3) wild types
(WT), three (3) heterozygous mutants (HET) and three (3) homozygous mutants
(MUT). There were 19/540 (3.5%) first pass No Calls due to “Invalid Control” result
on a single run. Upon retraining of the operator and retesting of the run, all controls
reported “Valid” and all 18 samples were found to be in agreement with sequencing.
One sample with Final No Call was called correctly upon re-extraction and re-testing.
There were zero Miscalls, and there was no statistical difference due to Site, Operator
or Day.

type and two (2) heterozygous) were tested in quadruplicate using three (3) different
kit lots of the Invader® Factor V test. The percent agreement between Invader®
Factor V test and sequencing was 100% (n=60).
Genomic DNA Extraction Reproducibility: Four commonly used extraction methods
were used to process thirty (30) human whole blood samples and ten (10) leukocyte
depleted whole blood (LDWB) spiked with cell lines with the following genotypes:

The 160 extracted samples were assayed in singlet in a single run using a single kit lot
of the Invader® Factor V test. With the exception of one sample that was removed
from the study due to loss of traceability of the sample identification, all other
samples, regardless of extraction methods, were correctly called on the first pass and
gave 100% agreement with DNA sequencing.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Quality Control:
Each test contains positive and negative controls to assure proper functioning of the
system. Failure of any controls will be indicated as “Invalid” in the test results
section of the report. The genotyping test result will not be reported for any sample
for which a positive or negative control failure occurs.
Positive Control: The genotype controls (WT, HET, MUT) ensure reagents were
assembled correctly and perform according to the specifications.
Negative Control: The No DNA Control is used by the interpretive software to set the
“noise” component of the run for “signal-to-noise” calculations.
Hardware and Software Control: The genotyping test result will not be reported for
any sample for which a positive or negative control failure occurs.
Real-Time Stability Study
The ongoing Stability Study tests seven (7) gDNA samples including three (3) WT,
two (2) HET and two (2) MUT genotypes using three (3) lots of Invader® Factor V
product stored under two recommended conditions: 1) -20°C (Standard Storage of
intermediate components) and 2) 4°-8°C (Standard Storage of Genotype-Specific
Controls). Functional testing is performed in quadruplicate at each time point and the
interim test results have demonstrated 6 months stability for the device.

final thaw at the time of testing. Functional testing was performed in replicates of 3-8
using genomic DNA samples isolated from cell lines, representing all possible
genotypes including two (2) WT, two (2) HET and two (2) MUT. Results showed
that all samples were correctly called using Invader® Factor V test reagents that
underwent repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
d. Detection limit:
Two (2) genomic DNA samples with different genotypes (i.e., one WT and the other
HET) were extracted from whole blood collected in potassium EDTA. They were
serially diluted and tested 40 times each at eight (8) different input amounts of (0.5, 5,
20, 40, 80, 200, 400, 800 ng/µL). The lower and upper limits of input gDNA when
all samples were called correctly were determined to be 5 ng/µL and 80 ng/µL,
respectively.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interfering Substances
Test performance was not affected by addition of the following substances to four (4)
whole blood samples of different genotype (3 WT, 1 HET) prior to extraction:
• Heparin (1500 U/dL human whole blood)
• Cholesterol (300 mg/dL human whole blood)
• Bilirubin (10 mg/dL human whole blood)
• Hemoglobin (up to 0.2% in whole blood)
• Potassium EDTA (1.8 mg/mL human whole blood)
• Ethanol-based Wash Buffer (5% in DNA sample)
Interfering Mutations
The effect of interfering mutations on G1691A genotyping by the Invader® Factor V
Test was evaluated with five (5) contrived DNA samples, including one WT sample
with no secondary polymorphism, one HET sample and three WT samples each with
a known secondary polymorphism (i.e., G1689A, A1692C or A1696G). Forty
replicates for each of the five different samples were tested, and no effect of
secondary polymorphisms was observed on G1691A genotyping by the Invader®
Factor V Test.
