L. Test Principle:
The Invader® MTHFR 677 test combines target amplification by PCR using a third-
party thermal cycler with signal generation by the Invader Plus® chemistry and signal
detection using interpretative software and a third-party fluorometer for genotyping of
a single point mutation (C to T at position 677) of the human 5,10-
methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR).
During the signal generation phase, a discriminatory Primary Probe transiently
hybridizes to the amplified target sequence along with an Invader® oligonucleotide,
to form an overlapping structure. The 5'-end of the Primary Probe includes a 5'-flap
that does not hybridize to the target DNA. The 3'-nucleotide of the bound Invader®
oligonucleotide overlaps the Primary Probe, and does not hybridize to the target
DNA. The Cleavase® enzyme recognizes this overlapping structure and cleaves off
the unpaired 5'-flap of the Primary Probe, releasing it as a target-specific product.
The released 5'-flap transiently hybridizes with a corresponding fluorescent resonance
energy transfer (FRET) cassette forming an overlapping structure that is recognized
and the fluorophore is cleaved from the FRET cassette by the Cleavase® enzyme.
When the FRET cassette is cleaved, a fluorophore and quencher are separated,
generating detectable fluorescence signal.
The Primary Probe and the 5'-flap are designed to have a melting temperature aligned
with the Invader® reaction temperature so that under the isothermal reaction
conditions (~63°C) the Primary Probes cycle on and off the target DNA and the 5'-
flaps cycle on and off of the corresponding FRET cassettes. This allows for multiple
rounds of Primary Probe cleavage for each DNA target resulting in an accumulation
of released 5'-flaps and multiple rounds of FRET cassette cleavage for each 5’-flap
resulting in an accumulation of released fluorophore.
The Invader® MTHFR 677 test uses two different discriminatory Primary Probes, one
for the mutant allele and one for the wild type allele. Each Primary Probe is assigned
a unique 5'-flap, and distinct FRET cassette, with a spectrally distinct fluorophore.

The released 5'-flaps will bind only to their respective FRET cassettes to generate a
target-specific signal, linking the wild type allele with one fluorophore (Fluorescence
1: FAM) and the mutant allele with the second fluorophore (Fluorescence 2: RED).
The Invader® MTHFR 677 software, in combination with Invader Call Reporter™
software, is a data analysis software that provides a working template for the setup of
reaction mixes and sample placement, and following the import of fluorescence data,
it determines results and validity for controls and samples.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability/Reproducibility: Two operators each from 3 different sites (2
external sites and 1 internal site) performed the testing in duplicate twice daily
over 5 non-consecutive days using the same testing materials including a
panel of nine (9) whole blood samples with each of the three (3) possible
genotypes (i.e. wild type (WT), heterozygous (HET), homozygous mutant
(MUT)) represented.
There were no first-pass No-Calls or Miscalls, and there was no statistical
difference due to Site, Operator or Day.

The 160 extracted samples were assayed in singlet in a single run using a
single kit lot of the Invader® MTHFR 677 test. With the exception of one
sample that was removed from the study due to loss of traceability of the
sample identification, all other samples, regardless of extraction methods,
were correctly called on the first pass and gave 100% agreement with DNA
sequencing.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Quality Control:
Each test contains positive and negative controls to assure proper functioning
of the system. Failure of any controls will be indicated as “Invalid” in the test
results section of the report. The genotyping test result will not be reported
for any sample for which a positive or negative control failure occurs.
Positive Control: The genotype controls (WT, HET, MUT) ensure reagents
were assembled correctly and perform according to the specifications.
Negative Control: The No DNA Control is used by the interpretive software
to set the “noise” component of the run for “signal-to-noise” calculations.
The genotyping test result will not be reported for any sample for which a
positive or negative control failure occurs.
Real-Time Stability Study
The ongoing Stability Study tests seven (7) gDNA samples including three (3)
WT, two (2) HET and two (2) MUT genotypes using three (3) lots of Invader®
MTHFR 677 product stored under two recommended conditions: (1) -30°C to
-20°C (Standard Storage of intermediate components) and (2) 4° to 8°C
(Standard Storage of Genotype-Specific Controls). Functional testing is
performed in quadruplicate at each time point and the interim test results have
demonstrated 7 months stability for the device.

Product in the final configuration was subject to 15 freeze-thaw cycles prior to
the final thaw at the time of testing. Functional testing was performed in
replicate of 3-8 using genomic DNA samples isolated from cell lines,
representing all possible genotypes including two (2) WT, two (2) HET and
two (2) MUT. Results showed that all samples were correctly called using
Invader® Invader® MTHFR 677 test reagents that underwent repeated freeze-
thaw cycles.
d. Detection limit:
Three (3) genomic DNA (gDNA) samples with different genotypes (i.e. WT,
HET, MUT) were extracted from whole blood collected in potassium EDTA.
Each sample was diluted to eight different concentrations 0.5, 5, 20, 40, 80,
200, 400, 800 ng/ µL and tested in replicates of forty (40). The recommended
range of the assay was determined to be between 5-80 ng/µL of input gDNA,
based on 100% concordance of all tested replicates with bi-directional
sequencing.

nine (9) whole blood samples of different genotype (3 WT, 3 HET, 3 MUT)
prior to extraction:
• Heparin (1500 U/dL human whole blood)
• Cholesterol (300 mg/dL human whole blood)

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison:
A total of 361 gDNA samples extracted from whole blood samples were
genotyped using the Invader® MTHFR 677 test and bi-directional DNA
sequencing. The observed agreement between the Invader® MTHFR 677 test
