Quantitation.
Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST) Methods for Allergen-Specific Immunoglobulin E
(IgE) 510(k)s; Final Guidance for Industry and FDA
L. Test Principle:
The allergen of interest covalently coupled to the ImmunoCAP solid phase, reacts
with the specific IgE in the patients plasma/serum sample. After washing away non-
specific IgE, enzyme labeled antibodies against IgE are added to form a complex.
After incubation, unbound enzyme-anti-IgE is washed away and the bound complex
is then incubated with the developing agent. After stopping the reaction, the
fluorescence of the eluate is measured. The higher the response value, the more
specific IgE present in the specimen. To evaluate the rest results, the response for the
patient samples are transformed to concentrations with the use of a calibration curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Since the updated ImmunoCAP allergen f20, Almond is a modified version of
the currently cleared device, a limited precision study was performed. To
demonstrate lot-to-lot reproducibility of the updated ImmunoCAP allergen
f20, Almond, three lots of ImmunoCAP Allergen f20, Almond were tested
using three positive and one negative control samples (stored human plasma).
The samples were tested on ImmunoCAP 250. Mean concentration values,
concentration quotients, and %CV were calculated. The concentration
quotients between lots based on uptake of positive sample were between 0.88
and 1.18, the concentrations of the negative samples were < 0.03 kU /L, and
A
all %CV were less than 6.2%. The results were within Phadia’s assay
specifications.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of specific IgE of the updated ImmunoCAP Allergen f20,
Almond was evaluated by testing three positive samples with concentration at
99 kU /L, 63.3 kU /L and 50.5 kU /L. Each sample was diluted five times in
A A A
a 3-fold scheme. The undiluted and diluted samples were tested in four
replicates in one run on ImmunoCAP 250. One lot of ImmunoCAP Allergen
f20, Almond was used. The results were pooled for the regression analysis.
The reagent showed dilution linearity for the claimed measuring range to
specific IgE to the updated ImmunoCAP Allergen f20, Almond. The
provided regression equation is as follows:
y=1.00x + 0.01 (R2 = 0.99)
(95% CI for slope 0.98 to 1.02 and for intercept -0.075 to 0.095)
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The IgE calibrators are traceable (via an unbroken chain of calibrations) to the
2nd International Reference Preparation (IRP) 75/502 of Human Serum
Immunoglobulin E from World Health Organization (WHO).
The stability studies were performed to demonstrate 24 month stability (at
recommended storage temperature of 2-8°C) of the updated ImmunoCAP
3

--- Page 4 ---
Allergen f20, Almond by an on-going real time stability study and accelerated
stability study. The study was planned in accordance with CEN 13640. For
real time stability study, three lots of the updated ImmunoCAP Allergen f20,
Almond were stored at recommended storage temperature, 2-8°C. Two
positive and one negative control samples (stored human plasma) were tested
in duplicates in one assay at monthly intervals. The mean concentrations were
calculated for the positive samples. For accelerated study, one lot of the
updated ImmunoCAP Allergen f20, Almond was stored at 30°C for 8 weeks.
The same lot stored at 2-8°C was used as reference. Two positive and one
negative control samples (stored human plasma) were tested in duplicates in
one assay run with the updated ImmunoCAP Allergen f20, Almond stored at
30°C after 4 weeks and 8 weeks. The mean concentrations were calculated
for each sample at each test occasion. Concentration quotients were
calculated for the positive samples as follows: the concentration for the lot
stored at 30°C was divided with the sample concentration for the reference lot
[(mean conc. 30°C)/(mean conc. 2-8°C)]. As results, the calculated
concentration quotients of positive samples ranged from 1.01-1.06 for 4 weeks
and 1.02-1.03 for 8 weeks, while the negative sample remained at <0.1 kU /L.
A
The results from accelerated stability study meet Phadia’s specification and
demonstrate at least 24 months stability from the date of manufacture.
In addition, the stability of calibration curve, real time and on-board stability
of ImmunoCAP Specific IgE calibrator were evaluated. The results support
Phadia’s claims: 1) the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE calibration curve is valid
for 28 days; 2) the shelf life of ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Calibrators (0, 0.35,
0.7, 3.5, 17.5, and 100 kU /L) is 24 months; 3) the on-board stability for
A
ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Calibrators is 28 days during 24 months shelf life.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB): In order to demonstrate LoB for the updated
ImmunoCAP Allergen f20, Almond, data from comparison study was
provided for calculating LoB. In this study, 111 negative samples (N=111)
were tested on ImmunoCAP 250. LoB was estimated as the 95% percentile of
the distribution. LoB = 0.0195 kU /L.
A
Limit of Detection (LoD): 20 samples with low concentration of analyte were
tested in 2 replicates (N=40, f=20). SD was determined and LoD was
calculated according to the equation: LoD = LoB + c ×SD while c =
β β
1.645/[1-1/(4×f)]. LoD = 0.06 kU /L. The claimed LoD is 0.1 kU /L.
A A
e. Analytical specificity:
The inhibition study was designed to verify the immunological specificity of
almond allergen solution as bound to the updated ImmunoCAP allergen f20,
Almond. The study was planned in accordance with CLSI I/LA20-A. In
order to establish the theoretical response level for 100% inhibition, (100%),
100 µl of negative sample was premixed with 100 µl of buffer. This is done
to mimic the state where all IgE antibodies are bound by the added soluble
inhibitor (allergen) and thus leaving no available IgE antibodies that may be
4

--- Page 5 ---
bound to the ImmunoCAP Allergen f20, Almond solid phase.
To establish the maximum response level for 0% inhibition, (“0%”), 100 µl of
positive sample was premixed with 100 µl buffer. To show an overall dose
dependent inhibition, 100 µl of positive sample was premixed with varying
dilutions of allergen solution (inhibitor). The allergen solution was serially
diluted with buffer. The initial allergen solution dilution factor is dependent
on the concentration of the allergen solution at hand. Subsequent dilutions
were then adjusted to the 1/10-dilution sequence. The unrelated allergen
solutions were not further diluted. Only concentrated solutions are used for
the inhibition studies. The mixture was incubated in a sample tube at room
temperature for 1 hour before being analyzed with ImmunoCAP Allergen f20,
Almond on ImmunoCAP 250 instrument according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The testing was performed in duplicates in one assay run on
ImmunoCAP 250. Mean value was calculated. The inhibition (%) at inhibitor
dilution factor (x) was calculated according to the following formula:
×
Inhibition (%) = Response – Response 100
(0% inhibition) (x)
Response – Response
(0% inhibition) (100% inhibition)
The results are shown below.
Inhibitor Dilution factor Response Inhibition

0% - 1376 0

Undiluted 234 85
Shrimp allergen 10 1138 13
Dog allergen 10 1328 4
Cat allergen 10 1397 0
The results indicated that the binding of specific IgE to the ImmunoCAP
Allergen f20, Almond is inhibited in an overall dose dependant fashion by
increasing amounts of the specific allergen extract. Three unrelated allergens
show no significant inhibition.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity/Clinical Specificity:
To demonstrate that a higher proportion of almond positive patients are
detected with the updated ImmunoCAP Allergen f20, Almond and no elevated
values of specific IgE on samples from healthy, non-atopic donors with no
reported clinical reaction to the allergen, 46 clinical and 111 negative samples
were tested with the updated and the currently cleared ImmunoCAP Allergen
f20, Almond. The clinical sample was defined as a sample from an individual
with a clinical history of allergy-like symptoms upon exposure to the specific
allergen, as diagnosed by a physician. Negative samples were collected from
healthy non-atopic donors. The samples were tested in duplicates as one
occasion using ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Assay on ImmunoCAP 250. One
lot of updated and one lot of currently cleared ImmunoCAP Allergen f20,
Almond were used in the study. The results for updated ImmunoCAP
Allergen f20, Almond are shown in the table below.
