L. Test Principle:
The EG V1(BL) Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose System and EG V1 PRO Self-Monitoring
Blood Glucose System employ a disposable dry reagent strip technology, based on the
glucose dehydrogenase method for glucose determination. Each test strip features an
electrode containing the glucose dehydrogenase in the presence of the coenzyme Flavin
Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD). A blood sample is applied to the blood collection area at the
tip of the strip and is automatically drawn into the reaction zone, where the FAD-binding
glucose dehydrogenase catalyzes the dehydrogenation of glucose to produce gluconolactone.
During the reaction, a mediator transfers electrons to the electrode surface and generates a
current. The amount of the current is proportional to the amount of glucose present in the
blood sample the glucose concentration is measured by the EG V1(BL) Glucose Meter and
displayed on the screen after 5 seconds.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance: The EG V1(BL) and EG V1 Pro are the same meters and
test strips, however, they have separate names because of the different indications
for use.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The repeatability study was performed by one operator with two test strip lots and 10
meters to analyze the normal control solution and six venous blood samples spiked to
concentrations that covered the measuring range of the device. Each blood sample
and control was tested 10 times (N=200).The final glucose concentrations for the
blood samples were confirmed by YSI. The blood samples had hematocrit levels of
20%-60%. The data is summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity study was performed using 7 venous blood samples spiked with dextrose
that covered the range from 20.2-599 mg/dL. Glucose concentrations were confirmed
by the YSI. One operator performed the study in singlicate on 3 test strip lots on one
of 5 meter selected at random over 10 days (N=210). Results are below:

The measurement range of the EG V1 Pro and EG V1(BL) Blood Glucose Meter is
20-600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
EG Controls
EG Glucose Control Solutions: Controls are traceable to the YSI and NIST Reference
material 965b. Value assignment was performed with 10 meters, and 2 lots of test
strips for 10 days. The mean, 2 standard deviations and CV are calculated for each
new lot of control material. The control range for each strip lot must be within
mean ± 15% and CV ≤ 6%. The target means for Controls 2 and 3 are 120 mg/dL
and 350 mg/dL, respectively.
Open vial control stability was tested at three control levels on two lots. The protocol
was carried out at the same temperatures as the open vial test strip studies. Controls

were tested weekly. Based on these studies, open vial stability is 90 days when stored
at 2-30°C. Unopened control solutions were tested under identical conditions as the
closed test strip studies. Unopened control solutions have a 12 month shelf life.
EG V1 Pro and EG V1 (BL) Glucose Test Strips
Real time stability was performed to assess the shelf-life and open-vial stability of the test
strips. Stability studies protocol and acceptance criteria were provided and found to be
adequate. The sponsor claimed that the unopened test strips have a 12 month shelf-life
and are stable for 3 months after first use when stored at 2-30°C. This information is
provided in the labeling of the test strips and control materials.
Open vial test strip stability was evaluated in real-time and accelerated studies using 2
lots of test strips and 3 whole blood concentrations, 50 ± 5 mg/dL, 100 ± 10 mg/dL
and 400 ± 10 mg/dL. Blood sample results on the meters were compared to the YSI.
Strips in the real time study were stored at 4±2°C and 23±2°C and 32±2°C and tested
weekly with controls and whole blood. Based on these studies, open vial stability is
90 days when stored at 2-30°C. Studies to evaluate the closed vial stability were
conducted at the same temperatures and sample range. Closed vial stability is one
year when stored 2-30°C.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range is 20 to 600 mg/dL based on linearity/reportable range studies
above (section M.1.b.).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies for endogenous, and exogenous, studies were conducted on 5 EG
V1 meters, and two lots of test strips using venous blood samples with three glucose
concentrations of approximately 80mg/dL, 120mg/dL, and 500 mg/dL. Interference
was evaluated in 24 common endogenous and exogenous potential interferents within
the therapeutic ranges and at above therapeutic or toxic ranges. Significant
interference is defined as a bias ≥ 10 % from the control group as measured on YSI..
The sponsor claims no significant interference (≤ 10% difference) for the substances
and concentrations shown in the table below:

Hematocrit Study:
The effect of different hematocrit levels on the accuracy of the device was evaluated
on the EG V1(BL) Blood Glucose Monitoring System with 5 meters and two test strip
lots. Blood samples at 5 hematocrit levels from 20% to 60% (20, 30, 40, 50, 60) were
adjusted to 4 concentrations of glucose of approximately 50, 150, 200, and 550
mg/dL. N=20 for each hematocrit level at each glucose concentration. Glucose
concentrations were compared to YSI. No significant interference from hematocrit
was defined as bias within ± 15%. Hematocrit 20%-60% does not significantly
interfere with glucose concentrations between 50-550 mg/dL.

testing. Distribution of glucose concentrations across the measuring range was: 73
samples between 58.5-120 mg/dL, 52 samples between 121-190 mg/dL and 28
samples between 191-433.5 mg/dL. An additional 8 samples were altered to meet the
extreme high and low ends of the measuring range (N=161, range 36.5-570.5 mg/dL).
All results were compared to the YSI. Hematocrit levels of the samples ranged from
25.9-59.9%. The meters were cleaned between each patient use following the
protocol described in the labeling with the recommended disinfectant wipes. The
studies met ISO 15197 accuracy criteria, e.g., 95% of glucose results < 75 mg/dL
were within ± 15 mg/dL, and for samples ≥ 75 mg/dL, 95% of results were within ±
20% of the reference method. Results are summarized below:

Alternative site testing for the thenar, hypothenar and arm was performed by lay
users, in a glucose steady state, at three sites. Labeling was provided in English to the
participants and the lay users obtained their own samples (n=153) and analyzed them
on one EG V1(BL) meter. 3 lots of test strips were used throughout the course of the
study. A health care professional also obtained samples from each testing site of the
participants and analyzed the samples on the same EG V1(BL) meter. All samples
were natural samples with values ranging from 51 mg/dL – 447 mg/dL. Accuracy
across the measuring range was evaluated using Deming regression and ISO 15197
criteria. Results are summarized below. Labeling states that alternative site testing
should not be used when the user suspects their blood glucose level is low, if they are
not aware of symptoms of hypoglycemia, the site results do not agree with the way
the user feels, after a meal or exercise, during illness or times of stress, or to calibrate
continuous glucose monitors or for insulin dosing calculations.

strip lots were used for the study. Blood samples were adjusted to concentrations of
40-60 mg/dL, 110-130 mg/dL, 340-360 mg/dL and 490-510 mg/dL as determined by
YSI. Each preservative type was run in duplicate for each strip lot on each meter for
each glucose concentration (N=320). Bias needed to be within ± 10% of the YSI
value. Based on this study, sodium heparin, lithium heparin, and EDTA are
appropriate sample preservatives. Sodium fluoride is not an appropriate preservative
for the EG V1(BL) and EG V1 Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems. Results are
summarized in the table below. See section M.2.a. for the comparison between
venous whole blood and capillary samples.

Diabetes Care, 2008, S18.
N. Instrument Name:
EG V1 Pro Blood Glucose, Meter and EG V1(BL) Blood Glucose Meter
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and requires a sample volume of 0.6 micL.
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes __________ or No ___X____
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ____X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, palm,
and forearm only. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary
action.
5. Calibration:
The EG V1 meter is a no code device. Reaction intensities of new test strip lots must
meet the manufacturer’s no code criteria for use with these meters. Validation of new
strip lots is confirmed by comparison to the YSI across the measuring range of the
device.
6. Quality Control:
Glucose control solutions at two different concentrations can be run with this device. The
14

--- Page 15 ---
meter has an algorithm to automatically recognize the control solutions to prevent control
results from being stored in the internal memory as patient result. Recommendations on when
to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. The control solution readings are not
included in the average of the patient results. An acceptable range for each control level is
printed on the control solutions vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the
control result falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. The device is intended for single-patient (EG V1) or healthcare professional use (EG V1
Pro). Disinfection studies were performed on the EG V1 Pro meter and lancet device by
an outside commercial testing service to determine the robustness of the meter and
lancing device to the recommended cleaning and disinfection protocol, and its
effectiveness in preventing the spread of bloodborne pathogens, particularly hepatitis B
virus (HBV). PDI® SANI-CLOTH® Germicidal disposable wipes (EPA Reg. No:
9480-4) were validated, demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus for use with the
meter and lancing device. The sponsor also demonstrated that there was no change in
performance or in the external materials of the meter and lancing device after 14,700
disinfection and 7,300 cleaning cycles designed to simulate 3 years of healthcare
professional use and 4 years of use by lay users.
2. Insufficient sample studies were performed at volumes ± 25% of the recommended
volume (0.6 mcL) on 5 meters and two test strip lots. Each sample was tested in
duplicate per strip lot. 7 glucose concentrations were tested ranging from approximately
50-500 mg/dL, as determined by the YSI. Appropriate sample volume was determined if
the meter results matched the YSI results. A blood volume ≥ 0.5 mcL met the criteria.
3. Altitude studies were conducted up to 10,000 ft (3,150 meters) using 5 venous blood
samples covering the measuring range of the device. Two lots of test strips and 10
meters were evaluated. Results were compared to the YSI. Meter performance was not
significantly (significant interference is defined as > ± 10%) affected up to 10,000 ft.
4. The effect of relative humidity was evaluated from 40 ± 5% to 85 ± 5% using 2 meters, 2
strip lots, measuring 3 blood samples in quintuplicate per meter. Blood samples ranged
from 20-70 mg/dL, 96-144 mg/dL and 280-600 mg/dL. Meter values needed to be within
the YSI ≤ 10%. Results met the acceptance criteria for 35± 5% to 85 ± 5%. The testing
supported the claimed shelf life of 12 months when stored at relative humidity of 40-
85%.The EG V1 Blood Glucose Meter normalizes the sample temperature (in vitro) to
the in vivo temperature (37°C). To validate and verify performance across several
temperature ranges, 5 meters and 2 strip lots were evaluated at 15 temperatures ranging
from 11 ± 1°C to 39 ± 1°C using 3 whole blood concentrations spanning the measuring
range and comparing the values to the YSI ±10%. Whole blood concentrations were 100
± 5 mg/dL, 250 ± 5 mg/dL, 450 ± 5 mg/dL. Relative humidity was 49-56%. There were
no significant differences in glucose concentrations across the temperature and humidity
ranges tested.
15

5. Open-vial-in-use test strip studies were performed at the combined extremes of 10±2°C
(46.4-56.3°F) RH: 40%, 10±2°C RH:85%, 40±2°C (100.4-107.6°F) RH:40%, and
40±2°C RH:85% with 5 venous blood samples with concentrations across the measuring
range and compared to the YSI. The study protocol, data and acceptance criteria were
provided and found to be adequate.
6. A usability study was performed to assess the readability of the labeling by recruiting 151 lay
users (aged 18-70 yrs old) who were provided with the test kit containing labeling in English
for the US market. Participants varied in age, education, country of origin, and were about
evenly divided between men and women. These lay users also completed a questionnaire to
indicate whether the device is easy to use and the Instructions for use were written in a way
that makes it easy to use. The majority of the users responded that the device is very easy to
use.
7. Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the results showed that the labeling
(User Guide, test strip package insert and control solution package insert) were written at the
8th grade level.
8. EMC testing was evaluated and certified by Bureau Veritas Consumer Products Services
(H.K.) Ltd., Taoyuan Branch and a letter of attestation was issued to EPS Bio Technology
Corp. on March 10, 2010.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
