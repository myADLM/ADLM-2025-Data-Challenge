Traceability and Value Assignment
The Elecsys Insulin assay is standardized against the WHO Reference
Reagent, 1 IRP, code 66/304 (NIBSC).
st
For each Insulin CalCheck 5 lot manufactured, the CalChecks were assayed
in duplicate on the Elecsys MODULAR ANALYTICS E170, Elecsys 2010,
cobas e 601, and cobas e 411 immunoassay analyzers. The assigned value of
each CalCheck is defined as the median value obtained over at least 6
determinations (duplicate runs on at least 3 analyzers) of the respective
CalCheck.
Stability studies
Open-Vial Stability:
The on-test material was reconstituted and stored for 5 hours at 25ºC (in an
open vial).
The reference material was a freshly reconstituted set of CalChecks. The on-
test and reference materials were tested in duplicate. On-test recovery was
calculated as a percent of the reference. The protocol, data and acceptance
criteria were found to be adequate.
The data supported the package insert claims that reconstituted Insulin
CalCheck 5 is stable up to 4 hours at 20-25°C.

--- Page 5 ---
Accelerated Stability:
The on-test material was stored lyophilized (as supplied to the user) at 35°C
for 3 weeks. The reference material was freshly reconstituted set of
CalChecks (stored at 4°C). After 3 weeks, the test and reference materials
are tested in duplicate. The on-test recovery is calculated as a percent of
the reference. The protocol, data and acceptance criteria were found to be
adequate.
One Elecsys Insulin CalCheck 5 lot was evaluated in duplicate on the Elecsys
2010.
Real-Time Stability:
In addition to open-vial and accelerated stability, real-time stability was
evaluated. In the on-going real-time stability study, the Elecsys Insulin
CalCheck 5 test material is stored at 2-8°C. The CalChecks were tested at T=0
and at specified intervals over the shelf life of the device up to the planned
shelf life plus one month.
The shelf life claim is 18 months. This is based on the accelerated
stability results.
