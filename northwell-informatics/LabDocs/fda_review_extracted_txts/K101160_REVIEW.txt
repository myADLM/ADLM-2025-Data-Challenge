H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
DAT Oral Fluid Cocaine (OFCOC) is an in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative
and semiquantitative detection of cocaine metabolite in human oral fluid when
calibrated with benzoylecgonine on automated clinical chemistry analyzers at a
cutoff concentration of 9 ng/mL in neat oral fluid. Samples must be exclusively
®
collected with the Intercept Oral Specimen Collection Device. Semiquantitative
test results may be obtained that permit laboratories to assess assay performance
as part of a quality control program and to estimate a dilution of the specimen for
confirmation by a confirmatory method such as LC/MS/MS.
DAT Oral Fluid Cocaine provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A
more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a
confirmed analytical result. Chromatography/mass spectrometry is the preferred
confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be
applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive
results are used.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use
The assay is not designated for use in point-of-care settings.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Roche/Hitachi Modular P analyzer
I. Device Description:
The Oral Fluid Cocaine assay consists of two ready for use reagent solutions.
Reagent 1 (R1) contains Conjugated benzoylecgonine derivative in buffer with

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
The sponsor referenced the following standard in their submission:
• CLSI EP5-A2 Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry
Devices; Approved Guideline - 2nd edition
The sponsor referenced the following guidance document in their submission:
• Premarket Submission and Labeling Recommendations for Drugs of Abuse
Screening Tests - Draft Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff
L. Test Principle:
The DAT oral fluids assays are based on the kinetic interaction of microparticles in a
solution (KIMS) technology. The DAT oral fluids assays are qualitative and semi-
quantitative. In the absence of sample drug, soluble drug conjugates bind to
antibody-bound microparticles, causing formation of particle aggregates. As the
aggregation reaction proceeds in the absence of sample drug, the absorbance
increases. When an oral fluid sample contains the drug in question, this drug
competes with the drug derivative conjugate for microparticle-bound antibody.
Antibody bound to sample drug is no longer available to promote particle
aggregation, and subsequent particle lattice formation is inhibited. The presence of
sample drug diminishes the increasing absorbance in proportion to the concentration
of drug in the sample. Sample drug content is determined relative to the value
obtained for a known cutoff concentration of drug.
The Intercept® Oral Specimen Collection Device contains a preservative buffer that
dilutes the neat oral fluid sample. The calibrator and control levels are set at diluted
levels so that sample absorbance values can be compared directly to the absorbance
values of the calibration curve. The assay result is reported as a positive or negative
result relative to the neat oral fluid cutoff of 9 ng/mL.
NOTE: To correlate a semi-quantitative result from the assay or the associated
LC/MS/MS confirmation result to a neat oral fluid value, the result from the assay or
the associated LC/MS/MS confirmation test should be multiplied by a factor of 3.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All analytical performance data was collected on human oral fluid samples
collected with the Intercept Oral Specimen Collection Device and analyzed on the
Roche MODULAR P analyzer. The Intercept collection device includes a diluent
that results in a dilution of approximately 1/3. The assay cannot be used to
4

--- Page 5 ---
measure undiluted (neat) samples. Analyte concentrations refer to the neat oral
fluid concentration, unless otherwise noted.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Two studies were performed with the assay to evaluate precision.
In the first study, a benzoylecognine solution was added to each of 9 samples
which were obtained from a human oral fluid pool of samples collected with
the Intercept® Oral Specimen Collection Device. The resulting
concentrations were approximately -100 %, -75 %, -50 %, -25 %, 0 %, +25 %,
+50 %, +75 %, and +100 % of the cutoff calibrator value. The samples were
tested in qualitative and semiquantitative modes. Following a CLSI (EP5-A2)
precision protocol, samples were tested in 2 replicates per run, 2 runs per day
for 21 days, total n = 84. One lot each of reagent, calibrator, and control were
used and there were ten calibrations performed during the study.
Qualitative Mode
Note: this study was performed on samples already collected with the
Intercept collection device. Therefore the data in the table below do not
reflect any imprecision inherent in the collection process itself. Results were

In the second study, a benzoylecognine solution was added to neat human oral
fluid sample pools at concentrations of 4.5, 6.75, 11.25, and 13.5 ng/mL.
Each sample was then processed through each of 21 of the Intercept® Oral
Specimen Collection Devices to achieve final concentrations at approximately
-50 %, -25 %, +25 %, and +50 %, of the cutoff calibrator value. The intra-
assay precision of the samples, including the processing of the samples
through the collection device, was then tested in qualitative and

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies were performed by spiking benzoylecgonine to a
concentration above the highest calibrator (24 ng/mL) into a negative pool of
human oral fluid collected with the Intercept® Oral Fluid Specimen
Collection Device. The samples were then diluted serially with the negative
pool and tested with the assay (n=3). Linearity was evaluated by comparing
the measured value to the theoretical value generated from the serial dilutions.
The results are summarized below.

Cross-reactivity to structurally related compounds is determined by spiking
related compounds into a negative pool of human oral fluid collected with the
Intercept® Oral Fluid Specimen Collection Device. By analyzing various
concentration of each compound the sponsor determined the concentration of
the drug that produced a response approximately equivalent to the cutoff
concentration of the assay. Results of those studies appear in the table below:
Approximate Cross
COMPOUND Reactivity
Cocaethylene 0.15%
Cocaine 0.70%
Ecgonine 0.09%
Ecgonine methyl ester 0.00%
Norcocaine 0.01%
Potential interference from structurally unrelated compounds were tested in
both semi-quantitative and qualitative mode by spiking the potentially
interfering compound into pools of human oral fluid collected with the
Intercept® Oral Fluid Specimen Collection Device that contain both a low
positive concentration (+50% of the cutoff) and a high negative concentration
(-50% of the cutoff) of benzoylecgonine. The interfering compounds were
tested initially at a concentration of 10,000 ng/mL. If cross-overs of the cutoff
occurred at this 10,000 ng/mL, the concentration of the cross-reactant was
reduced to determine the drug level at which the compounds does not cause
cross-overs of the cutoff.

Additionally, the following substances were evaluated by volunteers:
Antacid, Chewing tobacco, Cigarettes, Hard candy, Milk, Orange juice, Tooth
whitening strips
These substances were utilized by each of 10 volunteers. The Intercept®
package insert recommends : “Wait at least 10 minutes after ingesting any
food, drink, or drugs before collecting a sample” in the Directions for Use.
The volunteer-tested substances were evaluated by consuming/using the listed
substance. Samples were collected after 2, 6, and 10-minute wait periods The
oral fluid samples were then spiked with benzoylecgonine at both a low
positive concentration (+50% of the cutoff) and a high negative concentration
(-50% of the cutoff). Samples were tested in triplicate, and the median value is
reported.

All of the volunteer tested interferents evaluated showed no interference after
10 minutes, which is the waiting time indicated in the instructions for use.
The sponsor defined no interference as the negative control sample recovering
less than the cutoff and the positive sample control recovering greater than the
cutoff. Tums, teeth whitening strips, and orange juice each caused negative
controls to recover above the cutoff in some of the volunteers after 2 minutes
and 6 minutes. These samples had correct recoveries below the cutoff after
10minutes.

Potential interference from pH was tested in both semi-quantitative and
qualitative mode by spiking the potentially interfering substance into pools of
human oral fluid collected with the Intercept® Oral Fluid Specimen
Collection Device that contain both a low positive concentration (+50% of the
cutoff) and a high negative concentration (-50% of the cutoff) of
benzoylecgonine. The pH of the samples were adjusted to various pH levels
ranging from 2.0-8.5. The normal range of saliva pH is 5.6-7.8. All of the 0.5
x cutoff samples read negative and all of the 1.5 x cutoff samples read positive
with samples of pH 2 and 8.5.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed
cutoff concentration appears in the precision above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Two method comparison studies were performed. In the first study, unaltered
neat oral fluid samples containing cocaine were collected by expectoration
and analyzed by LC/MS/MS. The samples were then processed through the
Intercept® Oral Specimen Collection Device and were subsequently evaluated
with both LC/MS/MS and with the OFCOC assay. Unaltered near cutoff
samples were included in the sample set. Results were obtained from
LC/MS/MS of the neat oral fluid sample, from LC/MS/MS of the diluted
Intercept® sample, and from the OFCOC assay with the diluted
Intercept® sample. The following results were obtained with the OFCOC
assay on the Roche/Hitachi MODULAR P analyzer relative to the LC/MS/MS
values.
Note: The values obtained in this study were collected from samples spiked
with COC prior to the collection step. Therefore the results reflect the
performance of the entire system including the collection step.

In the second study, 40 oral fluid samples collected with the Intercept® Oral
Specimen Collection Device that were previously screened negative using the
Cocaine metabolite Intercept MICRO-PLATE EIA assay, were evaluated with
the Oral Fluid Cocaine assay. Forty samples that were screened positive with
the Cocaine metabolite Intercept MICRO-PLATE EIA were obtained from a
clinical laboratory and were subsequently confirmed by LC/MS/MS to contain
COC, were evaluated with the OFCOC. In addition, unaltered near cutoff
samples were analyzed. These samples fell in the near cutoff negative range
(between - 50 % and cutoff) and the near cutoff positive range (between cutoff
and + 50 %) as measured by LC/MS/MS Four negative near cutoff samples
and four positive near cutoff samples were assayed.
Note: this study was performed on samples already collected with the
Intercept collection device. When the LC/MS/MS values of the diluted
samples were compared to the immunoassay values, the following results
were obtained. Therefore the results below do not reflect any inaccuracy
inherent in the collection process itself.
