Patient sample collection and testing schedule requirements:

--- Page 2 ---
• ProsVue™ results are calculated as the linear slope of three NADiA® ProsVue™
total PSA test results obtained on three serum samples collected between six
weeks and 20 months post-radical prostatectomy (RP).
• All three samples from a single patient must be tested in a single NADiA®
ProsVue™ assay run.
• No results are to be reported to the physician until the ProsVue™ slope has been
calculated from the three data points. ProsVue™ slope (not the individual PSA
concentrations) is reported to the physician.
• The first serum sample for the NADiA® ProsVue™ assay is collected at least six
weeks after the date of radical prostatectomy, frozen at -70°C and stored at -70°C.
• The first serum sample must have a PSA value of < 0.1 ng/mL by a standard-of-
care (that is FDA approved/cleared) total PSA assay. The NADiA® ProsVue™
assay should not be used for patients with total PSA values greater than 0.1
ng/mL in the first serum sample.
• The date of radical prostatectomy must be sent to the laboratory along with the
first ProsVue™ sample. The date of sample collection must be sent to the
laboratory with each sample.
• The second serum sample collection date must be at least two months after the
first sample collection date.
• The third serum sample collection must be completed within 10 to 20 months (no
sooner than 10 months) of the date of radical prostatectomy, and at least two
months after the second sample.
• The first and second serum samples are not tested by NADiA® ProsVue™ assay
at the time of collection. Rather, the two samples are stored at ≤ -70°C until the
third sample is available for testing. Frozen samples are stable for at least 20
months.
• To ensure the proper time intervals for sample collection, dates of sample
collection are entered into the “Date/1st Sample PSA Validator” module of the
ProsVue™ Software. Refer to ProsVue™ Software Directions for Use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
NADiA® ProsVue™ is intended to be used in conjunction with Applied Biosystems
7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument (k082562) and the ProsVue Software.

L. Test Principle:
The NADiA® ProsVue™ assay is a dual-monoclonal nucleic acid detection immuno-PCR
assay (NADiA) for the quantitative measurement of total PSA (tPSA) in human serum.
The design of the assay combines the specificity of monoclonal antibody capture with the
sensitivity of real-time PCR detection. It is a two-site immunoassay utilizing an assay
specific synthetic DNA sequence as a label and detected by a PCR method. Calibrators,
controls and samples react with a reagent containing a monoclonal PSA-specific antibody
(Mab) labeled with an assay-specific double-stranded DNA sequence (reporter Mab-
DNA conjugate). Then a reagent of paramagnetic microparticles coupled to a
monoclonal antibody specific for another site on PSA is added and allowed to react to
form an insoluble sandwich immune complex with PSA. After washing the particles to
remove excess reporter Mab-DNA conjugate, a reagent containing a heat-stable
polymerase, specific primers, nucleotides, and a fluorescent dye is added to the washed
microparticles. An Applied Biosystems® (AB) 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instrument
is utilized to detect the specifically bound DNA label by subjecting suspended particles to
PCR conditions and monitoring the generations of amplicon in real time. Quantitation of
PSA is achieved by monitoring the number of PCR thermocycles it takes to generate a
predetermined fluorescent signal over baseline. This is accomplished by automatic
instrumentation designed to monitor fluorescence intensity as a function of cycle number.
The amount of DNA initially present in the sample is inversely proportional to the
threshold cycle (Ct). PSA values of controls and samples are calculated in pg/mL from a
calibrator dose-response plot. ProsVue slope is calculated using ProsVue Software from
the calculated PSA concentrations of three patient samples collected between six weeks
and 20 months post radical prostatectomy.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
i) Assay:
Precision testing was conducted by following CLSI EP5-A2. Samples were
analyzed in duplicate determinations at two sites, by three operators using two
AB 7500 Fast Dx instruments and two reagent lots. Forty assays were
performed at the first site by two operators. Each operator performed one run
per day, alternating between reagent lots, over a course of 20 days. At the
second site, a single operator performed 2 runs a day, one on each reagent lot,
for 5 days.
The test samples consisted of three levels of male serum pools. One of the
serum samples was in the lower portion of the normal range of < 4 pg/mL
(Low sample), one approximately at the middle range of ~ 24 pg/mL
(Intermediate sample) and one sample was at the upper end of the assay range
of ~ 69 pg/mL (High sample). The range of samples tested encompassed the
analytical measuring range. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to
evaluate the data consistent with the recommendations of EP5-A2. In
addition, MIVQUE0, ML, and REML models in PROC VARCOMP
procedure in SAS V9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary NC) were tested; REML
produced the most reliable estimates from the analysis. The two statistical
analyses were performed to analyze contribution of components of variation
to total variation: one for estimation of within-run precision (repeatability),
between-runs (within-lab), and between-day components of variation (Table-1
below); and a second for estimation of within-run, between-run, and between-
lot components of variation (Table-2 below). The following results were
obtained:

Components of variation estimated only include within-run, between-run, and
between-lot in this analysis. It should be noted that in this analysis, a 0.0%
CV was estimated for between-lot for the high sample tested. This result may
occur due to the partial-factorial design or co-linearity. The between-lot
imprecision was not more than 4.0%.
ii) Reproducibility study:
The studies were done at 2 sites in accordance with CLSI EP05-A2. The
operators were trained in the operation of the NADiA® ProsVue™ system
prior to testing. Study was performed over 20 days utilizing 3 male serum
pools consisted of a Low sample (in the lower portion of the normal range of
< 4 pg/mL), an Intermediate sample (in the middle range of ~ 24 pg/mL) and a
High sample (in the upper end of the assay range of ~ 69 pg/mL). The two
different sites provide side-by-side comparison of two different instruments.
The range of samples tested encompassed the analytical measuring range.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the data consistent with
the recommendations of EP5-A2. This experiment allowed a determination of
precision for each site and a determination of between site precision as given
in the Table-3 below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
i) Linearity: The linear range was determined according to CLSI EP06-A.
Based on the results of the Limit of Detection Study, linearity testing was
done on a range 20-30% wider than the anticipated measuring interval of 0.65
to 100 pg/mL. A 15-member panel was prepared by combining appropriate

volumes of a High sample and a Low sample. The High Sample was prepared
by pooling 31 post RP patient samples (22 with low PSA; 9 with high PSA),
and the pool’s assay value was 152.0 pg/mL. The equine-based ProsVue
Sample Diluent was used as the Low Sample. All samples were run in
triplicate in the ProsVue assay, using the AB 7500 Fast Dx instrument. The
linear regression analysis of the linearity data was performed as “Observed”
(Y-axis) vs “Expected” (X-axis) and with constant CV (weighted least squares
regression): the best fitted line was y=1.08x-0.06. Based on the results of
linearity range testing and that from the Limit of Detection Study, the method
has been demonstrated to be linear from 0.65 to 100 pg/mL with deviation
from linearity less than 24%.
ii) Spiking and Dilution Recovery Studies:
a) Spiking Recovery: Varying amounts of WHO PSA Standard Reference
Preparation 96/670 were added to 6 human post-RP serum samples with
endogenous PSA levels ranging from 2.7 to 37.3 pg/mL. The amount of
PSA that was added varied from 10 to 80 pg/mL When compared to the
expected ProsVue values, as shown in the table below, percent recovery of
measured values ranged from 87.5 to 119.2%.

iii) High Dose Hook-effect:
High dose hook effect was evaluated up to a level of 50,000 pg/mL. A sample
with a PSA concentration of 50,000 pg/mL was prepared by adding purified
PSA (WHO PSA Standard Reference Preparation 96/670) to ProsVue Sample
Diluent. Serial dilutions were made using Sample Diluent down to a level of
1.5 pg/mL, and the dilutions were tested in duplicate with the ProsVue assay
using the AB 7500 Fast Dx Instrument. Based on this procedure, the data
shows that the samples with values as high as 50,000 pg/mL did not exhibit
this effect.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i) Traceability:
The NADiA® ProsVueTM Assay calibrators and controls are manufactured
with the WHO PSA Standard Reference Preparation 96/670 (90 % PSA–ACT
+ 10 % free PSA).
ii) Calibrator and controls:
The Prosvue PSA Calibrator is an in-vitro diagnostic product intended to be
used to calibrate the NADiA® ProsVueTM method. It is a frozen liquid
product consists of two vials, packaged as two vials for each of three levels
(A, B and C), 0.06 mL per vial. Calibrators are prepared in off-clot equine
serum that is collected from herds that are certified as disease-free. The serum
is pooled and delipidated using fumed silica adsorbent. EDTA is added as a
stabilizer, and the serum is heat-treated at 60°C, followed by a stripping
process using ProsVue Target Capture Reagent. The 3 calibrators provided
(A, B and C) contain PSA levels of 100 pg/mL, 25 pg/mL and 5 pg/mL,
respectively. A PSA calibration curve is generated by analyzing each
calibrator in triplicate in each microplate run. The calibration range of
ProsVue is from 5 to 100 pg/mL PSA. Values are assigned to each lot of
calibrator from using the NADiA® ProsVueTM System, through a WHO PSA
Standard Reference Preparation 96/670 (90 % PSA–ACT + 10 % free PSA).
Prosvue Controls are prepared in the same matrix that is used for the
calibrators. ProsVue Control Levels 1, 2 and 3 are formulated at
approximately 3, 20, and 80 pg/mL of purified human prostate specific
antigen (90% PSA–ACT + 10% Free PSA).

ProsVue reagent stability was evaluated for three lots of ProsVue reagents that
were stored at the labeled storage temperatures and tested at multiple time
points. The kit reagents and wash solution were tested as a kit using in-house
controls as test samples. The expiration period was defined as the elapsed
time up to the point (the first time point of three successive time points) when
the mean control recovery from three consecutive time points fell outside the
value-assigned control limits. Other components like ProsVue Controls and
ProsVue Sample Diluent were tested for storage stability. The results of the
ProsVue stability testing are summarized in the table below.

iii) Sample Stability:
To demonstrate that low-level PSA samples observed post-RP have a similar
stability profile as those with values above 100 pg/mL when stored at -70°C,
serum pools from post-RP patients containing PSA concentrations at ~7 and
~150 pg/mL were tested in an accelerated stability study at 4, 20, 30 and
40°C. Aliquots of each pool were assayed with NADiA® ProsVueTM at
baseline and at serial time points over 15 days at each incubation temperature.
Stability projections indicated that 99.6% and 99.7% of PSA would remain
immunoreactive at 20 years of storage at -70°C based on the observed
decomposition rates of the low and high serum pools, respectively. Further,
the rates of PSA decomposition were not significantly different for the two
PSA pools at any of the four temperatures tested, thus indicating that the
stability of PSA is not related to its concentration.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of blank (LOB), limit of detection (LOD), and limit of quantitation (LOQ)
were determined in accordance with CLSI/NCCLS EP 17-A. Four low level PSA
samples were prepared (0.55, 0.65, 0.75 and 1.0 pg/mL) by adding PSA antigen
(WHO International PSA Standard 96/670 (90:10)) to the ProsVue Sample
Diluent. Sixty replicates of each sample and ProsVue Sample Diluent were run in
the ProsVue assay.
LOB – the highest measurement result that is likely to be observed (with a
probability [alpha] of 0.05 [5%]) for a blank sample was 0.17 pg/mL

LOD – the lowest amount of analyte in a sample that can be detected with type I
and II error rates set to 5% was observed as 0.27 pg/mL.
LOQ – the lowest actual amount of analyte in a sample that can be reliably
detected and at which total error meets lab pre-specified requirements for
accuracy (80–120%) and precision (< 25%) was 0.65 pg/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
i) Equimolarity:
To demonstrate the equimolarity of ProsVue (the assay recognizes free PSA
and PSA-ACT equally well), five sets of samples with free PSA
concentrations ranging from zero to 100 percent and total PSA concentrations
of 5, 30, 70 and 100 pg/mL were assayed using ProsVue. The following data
with a recovery range of 88 to 113.2% demonstrate that ProsVue is equimolar.

determine the effect of various endogenous and exogenous substances on the
NADiA® ProsVueTM assays. For all interferents the percent bias was
determined by testing a control sample without the interferent and comparing

it to the value obtained from a test sample to which the potential interferent
had been added.
a) Endogenous Substance Interference:
Interference testing in the ProsVue assay was done at two PSA
concentrations of 3 and 50 pg/mL. Test samples were prepared by spiking
the potential interferent into serum. Elevated concentrations of blood
constituents were added to serum samples containing PSA and assayed in
quadruplicate with the ProsVue™ assay. Bias exceeding 10% was
considered interference. Results showed no intereference from the
endogenous substance are summarized in the table below.
Interference by blood constituents
Bilirubin, conjugated 30 mg/dL
Cholesterol 500 mg/dL
Creatinine 5.0 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 200 mg/dL
Immunoglobulin G 6 g/dL
Triglycerides 1000 mg/dL
Urea 260 mg/dL
Uric acid 23.5 mg/dL
b) Exogenous Substance Interference:
Forty two exogenous substances were tested for interference including
common over-the-counter drugs and cancer drugs. Unspiked and spiked
samples were run in quadruplicate and the mean ProsVue concentrations
were determined. Interference was significant if the mean PSA values of
the unspiked and spiked samples differed by >10%. The substances added
and the highest concentrations tested are listed in the table below.
Inaccuracies (biases) due to these substances were less than 10% at PSA
concentrations of 3 and 50 pg/mL.

and in a version of the assay lacking the polyclonal murine IgG. The
results demonstrated marked reduction of observed ProsVue PSA values
in some samples. To address the uncertainty between true PSA values and
HAMA interference, a model system was designed using a purified
Donkey Anti-Mouse Antibody (DAMA) reagent. This reagent was run in
various concentrations from 10 to 10,000,000 pg/mL versus the standard
ProsVue assay and the version of the assay lacking the polyclonal murine
IgG. This model system indicated complete assay resistance to non-
specific cross-linking. In addition, three known HAMA positive samples
were titrated into serum diluent aliquots containing PSA at approximately
5 or 50 pg/mL. Titration of the HAMA samples up to a 1:8 dilution
demonstrated approximately 100 ± 20% recovery at both the expected 5
and 50 pg/mL concentrations. Since there was no trend in observed PSA
values at decreasing HAMA concentrations, it is inferred that no
quantifiable interference occurred in the neat sample and that PSA values
in the assay represent true PSA concentrations. ProsVue has additives in
the reporter antibody solution to avoid heterophilic interference; however,
care should be taken in evaluating results of patients suspected of having
these antibodies.
d) Method Cross-Reactivity:
Cross-reactivity with prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) was determined in
the ProsVue assay. Purified human prostate specific antigen (90% PSA–
ACT + 10% Free PSA) at two concentrations (5 and 50 pg/mL) was
spiked into ProsVue Sample Diluent and also spiked into a PAP solution
at a concentration of 1 μg/mL. The two pairs of solutions were assayed in
8 replicates. Results showed that PAP cross-reactivity was < 0.0004% in
the ProsVue assay at both PSA concentrations tested.
f. Assay cut-off:
For the NADiA® ProsVueTM assays, the slope (pg serum PSA/mL per month) is
used to determine if a significant change occurred in the post-prostatectomy
patients. Slope is a rate of change in serum total PSA concentration over a period
of month. ProsVue™ results are calculated as the linear slope of three NADiA®
ProsVueTM total PSA test results obtained on three serum samples collected
between six weeks and 20 months post-radical prostatectomy.
The ProsVue software determines the slope by linear regression using the least
squares method in the following formula:
13

--- Page 14 ---
Where y = pg/mL and x = days between ProsVue samples. The slope in
pg/mL/day is then converted to pg/mL/month by multiplying by 30.4375 (average
days/month). No slope is calculated if any value is less than 0.65 pg/mL.
ProsVue linear slope at a < 2.0 pg/mL/month determine cut-off.
The ProsVue™ software identifies serum samples with invalid collection intervals
and calculates the equation of the calibration line, PSA concentration (pg/mL) of
patient samples and assay controls, patient ProsVue slope (pg/mL/month), and
patient risk category. ProsVue software generates a report that includes the
ProsVue slope (in pg/mL/month) and whether that slope categorizes a patient as
being at “reduced risk” or “not at reduced risk” of prostate cancer recurrence.

Not applicable - clearance is supported by clinical study results
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable.
3. Clinical studies:
To evaluate the prognostic capability of ProsVue linear slope to identify prostate
cancer patients at reduced risk of prostate cancer recurrence following radical
prostatectomy (RP), 304 patients were selected using a case-cohort study design.
Patients meeting the study entry criteria were acquired from four clinical sites where
each patient’s clinical status (“Stable” or “Recurrence”) was documented. Samples
used were from men age 41 to 79 years with documented prostate cancer treated via
radical prostatectomy with curative intent. Caucasian (88.8%), African-American
(8.2%), Asian (2.0%) and patients of unknown race (1.0%) achieving post-RP total
PSA values < 100 pg/mL by standard-of-care assays were followed up to 17.6 years
post-prostatectomy with three serum samples per patient acquired at various time
points during the 1.5 - 20 month ProsVue sampling period. The study cohort
consisted of 64 patients with “Recurrence” and 240 “Stable” patients. Recurrent
patients were followed a median of 4.7 years (range 1.2 – 15.3 years) until recurrence.
“Recurrence” was documented by positive imaging, positive biopsy, or death due to
prostate cancer. “Stable” patients were followed for a median of 11.0 years (range
8.0 – 17.6 years).
Figure 1: Kaplan-Meier plot of probability of stable classification versus years (Solid
line indicates patients with ProsVue slope ≤ 2 pg/mL/month [n=245] and dashed line
indicates patients with ProsVue slope > 2 pg/mL/month [n=59]).
14

--- Page 15 ---
The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the 8-year probability of “Stable” were 95.9% (95%
CI: 93.4 - 98.4%) for the patients with ProsVue Slope ≤ 2 pg/mL/month and 37.3%
(95% CI: 25.0 - 49.6%) for the patients with ProsVue Slope > 2 pg/mL/month.
Median time to recurrence in the patients with ProsVue slope ≤ 2 pg/mL/month was
>17.6 years versus 4.8 years for patients with ProsVue slope > 2 pg/mL/month.
Further investigation with Cox proportional hazards regression analysis used to
evaluate the association between ProsVue linear slope and prostate cancer recurrence
status in a univariate analysis (can be interpreted as standalone performance)
indicated that the patients with ProsVue Slope ≤ 2 pg/mL/month were 18.3 times
more likely to be “Stable” than those with ProsVue Slope > 2 pg/mL/month (HR =
18.3 with 95% CI: 10.6 to 31.8; p <0.0001). Thus, ProsVue linear slope was a
significant predictor of reduced risk for prostate cancer recurrence in this analysis
(Table-4).

Cox proportional hazards regression analysis adjusted for pre-specified covariates of
preprostatectomy PSA value, pathologic disease stage and Gleason score was
performed with the ProsVue slope term (Table-5). Of the covariates, only the
Gleason score variable reached significance (p = 0.0004). The ProsVue linear slope
term was attenuated from the univariate analysis but remained a highly significant
and independent predictor of risk for prostate cancer recurrence with a HR of 9.8
(95% CI: 5.4 to 17.8, p < 0.0001). The reduced hazard probably reflects that ProsVue
slope may be related to the clinical factors but is clearly providing additional
information.

The probability of clinical status “Recurrence” for the subjects with Slope > 2
pg/mL/month (Positive Predictive Value, PPV) and probability to remain with
clinical status “Stable” through at least 8 years for the subjects with slope ≤ 2
pg/mL/month (Negative Predictive Value, NPV) were calculated from the clinical
study results (n=304). Table-6 presents a 2 x 2 table of the ProsVue classification
based on the slope outcome and to the clinical status of patients as “Stable” or
”Recurrence” in the following 8 years (row and column totals are also displayed).

Among subjects who had “Recurrence” during 8 years of follow-up, 71.9% (46/64)
subjects had slope > 2 pg/mL/month and among the subjects who had “Stable” status
through at least 8 years of follow-up, 94.6% (227/240) subjects had slope ≤ 2
pg/mL/month.
Positive likelihood ratio (PLR) was 13.3 with 95% CI: 7.7 - 23.0 and negative
likelihood ratio (NLR) was 0.297 with 95% CI: 0.201 - 0.440.
In these data, probability of “Recurrence” regardless of the values of the ProsVue
slope was 21.0% (64/304); PPV was 78.0% with 95% CI: 65.3 - 87.7% and NPV was
92.7% with 95% CI: 88.6 - 95.6%.
Because the estimates of PPV and NPV depend on the probability of “Recurrence”
among all subjects (prevalence of clinical status ”Recurrence”), Table-7 presents
estimates of PPV and NPV calculated for various levels of prevalence of
”Recurrence”.

A subgroup analysis was performed on data from 20 patients with at least one post-
RP PSA value ≥ 300 pg/mL, but who remained stable throughout at least 8 years of
follow-up. ProsVue slope correctly classified 11 of the 20 patients as “at reduced risk
for recurrence” (ProsVue slope ≤ 2 pg/mL/month).
4. Clinical cut-off:
Frozen serum from 104 post-prostatectomy patients were used to demonstrate
clinically useful cut-off. A two part study assessed the value of the linear slope of
post-prostatectomy ProsVue values (in pg/mL) versus time (in months) as a
prognostic indicator of risk for clinical recurrence of prostate cancer. The indicator
employs a <2.0 pg/mL/month cutpoint. Values at or below this cutpoint were
associated with reduced risk for prostate cancer recurrence – biochemically in the first
part study and clinically defined by positive imaging, positive biopsy results or death
in the second part study.
The ProsVue software categorizes patients as “at reduced risk for prostate cancer
recurrence” or “not at reduced risk for prostate cancer recurrence” based on the
ProsVue slope criteria listed in the table below. The ProsVue software reports results
as ProsVue slope (pg/mL per month) and categorization.
Risk Category ProsVue Slope
At reduced risk for prostate Less than or equal to
cancer recurrence 2.0 pg/mL per month
Not at reduced risk for prostate Greater than
cancer recurrence 2.0 pg/mL per month

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
