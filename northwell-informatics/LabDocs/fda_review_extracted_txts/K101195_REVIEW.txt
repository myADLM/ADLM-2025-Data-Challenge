H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
The 6-Acetylmorphine Enzyme Immunoassay is intended for the qualitative and semi-
quantitative determination of 6-Acetylmorphine in human urine, at a cutoff value of 10
ng/mL. The assay is designed for professional use with a number of automated clinical
chemistry analyzers.
The 6-Acetylmorphine Drugs of Abuse (DAU) Calibrators are for use as calibrators in
the qualitative and semi-quantitative calibration of the 6-Acetylmorphine Enzyme
Immunoassay.
The 6-Acetylmorphine Drugs of Abuse (DAU) Controls are for use as assayed quality
control materials to monitor the precision of the 6-Acetylmorphine Enzyme
Immunoassay.
This assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative
chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas or
Liquid Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS or LC/MS) is the preferred
confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be
exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is
positive.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For professional use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Analyzers capable of maintaining a constant temperature, pipetting samples, mixing
reagents, measuring enzymatic rates at 340 nm and timing the reaction accurately can
be used to perform this assay.

The 6-Acetylmorphine assay is a homogenous enzyme immunoassay with ready-to-use
liquid reagent. The assay is based on competition between drug in the sample and dug
labeled with enzyme glucose-6-phodphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for a fixed amount of
antibody in the reagent. Enzyme activity decreases upon binding to the antibody, and the
drug concentration in the sample is measures in terms of enzyme activity. In the absence of
drug in the sample, 6-Acetylmorphine-labeled G6PDH conjugate is bound to antibody, and
the enzyme activity is inhibited. On the other hand, when free drug is present in the sample,
antibody would bind to free drug, the unbound 6-Acetylmorphine-labeled G6PDH then
exhibits its maximal enzyme activity. Active enzyme converts nictinamide adenine
dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH resulting in an absorbance change that can be measured
spectrophotometrically at 340 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
Performance testing was conducted on the Hitachi 717
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was determined by spiking 6-Acetylmorphine into drug free urine at
various concentrations (-75%, -50%, -25%, at the cutoff, 125% and 150%, 175%
and 200% of the cutoff). Concentrations were confirmed by LC/MS. Testing for the
intra-assay was performed once a day for 22 days. The between run testing was
performed in replicate twice a day for 22 day. The qualitative and semi-quantitative
results are presented below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity across the range was confirmed by serially diluting a spiked urine pool
containing 100 ng/mL of 6-Acetylmorphine in to concentration levels listed in the
table below. Each sample was assayed in the semi-quantitative mode. The results
were averaged and compared to the expected result and the percent recovery was
calculated. The claimed range is 2-40 ng/mL. Results are presented in the table
below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
A commercially available 6-Acetylmorphine standard solution from Cerolliant
Analytical Reference Standards is used and traceable to NIST standard. This
standard solution is made into a secondary (lower concentration) stock solution.
The secondary stock solution is then spiked into the calibrators and controls to the
desired concentration. The concentrations are confirmed by GC/MS.

Stability Studies:
Real time and accelerated studies for both controls and calibrators have been
conducted. Protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be
acceptable. The manufacturer claims the following expiration date for both controls
and calibrators:
When stored at 2-8 ºC unopened product is stable until expiration date which is 18
months.
On board stability is good for 14 days when stored at 2-8 ºC.
d. Detection limit:
Performance at low drug concentrations in the semi-quantitative assay was
characterized by determination of recovery (see section b above).
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was established by spiking various concentrations of structurally
related and unrelated into drug-free urine. Results are expressed as a minimum
concentration of metabolite or compound required to produce a response
approximately equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the assay. The percent
cross-reactivity of those compounds are presented below:

There is the possibility that other substances and/or factors not listed above may
interfere with the test and cause false results, e.g., technical or procedural errors.
pH and Specific Gravity
To test for possible positive and/or negative interference from pH urine samples having
pH from 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 were used. Each of these samples were divided into two
aliquots for each drug and spiked to -25% of the cutoff and 125% of the cutoff. No
positive or negative interference due to pH was observed.
To test for possible positive and/or negative interference from specific gravity urine
samples having specific gravity from 1.0025, 1.005, 1.0075, 1.010, 1.015, 1.017, 1.025
and 1.030 were used. Each of these samples were divided into two aliquots for each
drug and spiked to -25% of the cutoff and 125% of the cutoff. No positive or
negative interference due to specific gravity was observed.
