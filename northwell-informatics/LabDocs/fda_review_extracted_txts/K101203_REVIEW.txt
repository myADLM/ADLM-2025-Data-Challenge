L. Test Principle:
The Roche Tina-quant Albumin Gen 2 assay is an immunoturbidimetric assay for the
quantitative in vitro determination of albumin in human serum, plasma, urine and
CSF on the Roche/Hitachi cobas c 501 analyzer. The test principle is a particle
enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay. Human albumin (the antigen) agglutinates with
latex particles coated with anti-albumin antibodies. The precipitate is determined
turbidimetrically following agglutination.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To evaluate linearity, the sponsor analyzed dilutions of urine, serum, and CSF.
The diluent used was NaCl. Albumin levels were measured and the recovered
value was compared to the theoretical value. Pure samples (0% and 100%)
were run n=6, with mean measured value reported. Diluted samples were run
n=3 with mean measured values reported. The concentrations tested spanned
the measuring range for each analyzer / matrix combination. Data were
calculated per EP6 guidelines. The linearity data were analyzed with regards
to linear, quadratic and cubic polynomials. A linearity check was performed
with a first order (linear) regression and then with higher order models
(quadratic and cubic). None of the higher order models were significant.
Linear regressions were as follows:
Urine:
Slope: 0.9962 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.00)
Intercept: 0.6942 (95% CI -0.60 to 1.99)
Correlation Coefficient: 0.999

The claimed measuring ranges for the assay are:
Urine
12 - 400 mg/L
Serum/Plasma
3 - 101 g/L
CSF
95 - 3000 mg/L
The extended measuring range using automated rerun with dilution was
validated by performing an experiment comparing the instrument auto-rerun
result with a simple manual dilution. Two cobas c501 analyzers were used per
experiment. Three samples were manually diluted in triplicate per analyzer.
Sample medians were compared to the instrument auto-rerun results.
Recoveries were as follows:
Urine matrix: 102 – 109 %
Serum/plasma matrix: 93 – 105 %
CSF matrix: 103 – 106 %
A known high-dose hook effect occurs with the Urine and CSF applications.
Due to the antigen excess check reagent R3, no unflagged high-dose hook
effect will occur up to an albumin concentration of 40,000 mg/L for urine
samples and 30,000 mg/L for CSF samples. The high dose hook effect and the
correct flagging were tested with 2 serially spiked samples under customer
conditions on the cobas c501 analyzer.

--- Page 10 ---
Note: analyte concentrations that would cause a hook effect in serum or
plasma are outside of the physiological range and were not tested.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The C.f.a.s. PUC calibrator, Precinorm PUC/Precipath PUC and Precinorm
Protein/Precipath Protein controls are traceable to the reference preparation
IRMM (Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements)
BCR470/CRM470 (RPPHS - Reference Preparation for Proteins in Human
Serum).
d. Detection limit:
The analytical limits at low levels are as follows:
Urine: Limit of Blank 2 mg/L
Limit of Detection 3 mg/L
Limit of Quantitation 12 mg/L
Serum/Plasma: Limit of Blank 1 mg/L
Limit of Detection 2 mg/L
Limit of Quantitation 3 mg/L
CSF: Limit of Blank 20 mg/L
Limit of Detection 36 mg/L
Limit of Quantitation 95 mg/L
e. Analytical specificity:
The effects of endogenous interference on the quantitation of albumin were
determined for serum/plasma, urine and CSF sample types. Pooled human
serum, urine and CSF samples were spiked with varying levels of interferents.
The resulting sample series (ten dilution steps per samples) were tested in
triplicate and the median values used to calculate recovery, by comparing the
measured albumin concentration to the expected albumin concentration
(which is the albumin concentration when no interferent was added).
Significant interference was considered present if the % recovery exceeded +/-
10% of the expected 100% recovery.
Serum/Plasma Results:
Lipemia: No interference was observed up to the highest L index
value tested which was 1852. The L index corresponds to
turbidity. The device labeling claims no interference at an
Intralipid concentration of approximately 1500 mg/dL.
10

--- Page 11 ---
Icterus: No interference was observed for unconjugated bilirubin I
index levels up to 64. No interference was observed for conjugated
bilirubin I index levels up to 74. The I Index Value corresponds to
approximately 1 mg/dL bilirubin.
Hemolysis: No interference was observed up to the highest H
index value tested which is 1077. The H Index Value corresponds
approximately to 1 mg/dL hemoglobin.
Rheumatoid factor: No effect was observed up to the highest
concentration tested, which was 1392 IU/mL.
In very rare cases gammopathy, in particular type IgM
(Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia), may cause unreliable results.
Urine Results:
Icterus: No conjugated bilirubin interference was observed up to an
I index of 52. The I Index Value corresponds to approximately 1
mg/dL bilirubin.
Hemolysis: No hemolysis interference was observed up to an H
index of 487. The H Index Value corresponds approximately to 1
mg/dL hemoglobin
No interference was seen with the following
compounds/concentrations:
acetone ≤ 60 mmol/L
ammonium chloride ≤ 0.11 mol/L (<6 g/L)
calcium ≤ 40 mmol/L
creatinine ≤ 0.18 mol/L (20 g/L)
γ-globulin ≤ 500 mg/L
glucose ≤ 0.19 mol/L (35.0 g/L)
urea ≤ 0.8 mol/L
uric acid ≤ 5.95 mmol/L (1.2 g/L)
urobilinogen ≤ 378 μmol/L (200 mg/L)
CSF results
The sponsor defined significant interference when the recovery
was greater than ± 10 % of initial value at an albumin
concentration of 240 mg/L (3.65 μmol/L, 24 mg/dL).
Hemolysis: No significant interference up to an H index of 1131.
11

--- Page 12 ---
The H Index Value corresponds approximately to 1 mg/dL
hemoglobin
Icterus: No bilirubin interference was observed up to an I index of
66. The I Index Value corresponds to approximately 1 mg/dL
bilirubin.
Due to the antigen excess check reagent R3 no unflagged high-
dose hook effect will occur up to an albumin concentration of
30000 mg/L (456 μmol/L, 3000 mg/dL).
Commonly used drugs were added to native patient samples and analyzed for
potential interference. Thirteen commonly used drugs were tested with the
urine application and 18 commonly used drugs were tested with the
serum/plasma application. Each drug was added in two defined concentrations
and the resulting samples were measured in triplicate using the cobas c501
analyzer. Drug interference testing was performed with urine and serum
samples. The median value is compared to the reference value (albumin
sample with no drug added) and the deviation from the reference value is
calculated. Significant interference was defined as +/- 10% deviation from the
reference value observed with the lower drug concentration.
No interference was found at therapeutic concentrations of the following
drugs in urine:
Acetaminophen
N-Acetyl cysteine
Salicyluric Acid
Ascorbic Acid
Calciumdobesilate
Na2-Cefoxitin
Gentamycin Sulfate
Ibuprofen
Levodopa
Methyldopa
Ofloxacine
Phenzopyridine
Doxycyclin
No interference was found at therapeutic concentrations of the following
drugs in serum:
Acetylcystein
Ampicillin – Na
Ascorbic acid
Ca - Dobesilate
12

Cyclosporine
Cefoxitin

Intralipid
Levodopa
Methyldopa
Metronidazole
Phenylbutazone
Doxycyclin
Acetylsalycilic acid
Rifampicin
Acetaminophen
Ibbrofen
Theophylline
Due to the antigen excess check reagent R3, no unflagged high-dose hook
effect will occur up to an albumin concentration of 40000 mg/L (608 μmol/L).
In very rare cases gammopathy, in particular type IgM (Waldenström’s
macroglobulinemia), may cause unreliable results.
