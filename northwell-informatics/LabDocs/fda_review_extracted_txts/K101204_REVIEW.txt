L. Test Principle:
The test is based on electrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of capillary
action. The electrical current generated by the reaction of glucose with the reagent of the
strip is measured by the meter and is displayed as the corresponding blood glucose level.
The strength of the current produced by the reaction depends on the amount of glucose in
the blood sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance: The MEG-2 and the MEG-2 Multi are the same meters use the
same test strips, however, they have separate names because of the different indications
for use.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run and between-run precision studies were performed. For the within-run
precision studies, 10 replicates of each of 5 spiked venous whole blood glucose

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using 3 lots of test strips, 10 MEG-2 blood glucose meters,
and 8 venous whole blood samples with glucose levels ranging from 15-610 mg/dL,
obtained by spiking pooled venous blood with a glucose solution. Each glucose level
was analyzed 40 times over 3 test strip lots. Linear regression analysis for each test
strip lot compared to the YSI resulted in:
y = 0.9948x + 0.0568; R2 = 0.9988 for Test Strip Lot 1
y = 0.9879x + 1.0573; R2 = 0.9986 for Test Strip Lot 2
y = 0.9976x + 0.3156; R2 = 0.9989 for Test Strip Lot 3
The claimed range of measurement for this device is 20 to 600 mg/dL.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Three levels of control material, MEG-2 Glucose Control Solution Low (34-64
mg/dL), MEG-2 Control Solution Level 1 (88-120 mg/dL) and MEG-2 Control
Solution Level 2 (176-238 mg/dL), are available for use with this test system. The
glucose standard set NERL 1343 was used to trace the analyte of the control
solutions. The NERL 1343 standard is traceable to the NIST glucose standard. All
three levels are provided with the meters of this submission.
Shelf life and open vial stability were evaluated through real-time studies at 30ºC and
80% humidity using 3 lots of each control solution. The results support a 21 month
shelf life and the 90 day open vial stability claims. Real-time stability studies for
shelf-life of the control solutions are ongoing.
The recommended storage temperature for control solutions is 15 to 30°C and below
80% humidity. The recommended storage temperature for the test strips is 39 to 86°F
(6 months).
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range is 20 to 600 mg/dL based on linearity/reportable range studies
above (section M.1.b.).
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor tested substances for interference using 1 lot of test strips (10 test strips
per interferent level), 10 meters, and 3 levels of glucose (achieved by adjusting human
venous blood glucose levels to the ranges of 50-70, 110-130, and 300-330 mg/dL).
Samples were then spiked with the following interfering substances. Each sample was
analyzed 10 times. The labeling states that elevated concentration of L-DOPA ( > 1.5
mg/dL), ibuprofen ( > 40 mg/dL), tolazamide ( > 60 mg/dL), ascorbic acid ( > 5.0
mg/dL), fructose ( > 15 mg/dL), uric acid (> 15 mg/dL), cholesterol ( > 400 mg/dL),
bilirubin conjugated ( > 15 mg/dL), bilirubin unconjugated ( > 25 mg/dL), and
triglyceride ( > 2000 mg/dL), and methyl-dopa (> 7.5 mg/dL) may affect test results.
The following table lists the concentrations of each substance at which no significant
interference (≤ 10%) was detected:

Reference Method Comparison:
The sponsor performed a system accuracy evaluation comparing the
MEG-2 to YSI. Healthcare professionals tested 111 capillary samples in 6
concentration categories (55-80, 81-120, 121-200, 201-300, 301-400, and >400
mg/dL) per strip, using 8 meters and 3 lots of test strips using the MEG-2 meter and
the YSI (the reference method). Eight additional glycolyzed samples were also tested
to obtain concentrations < 55 mg/dL and one sample was spiked to obtain an
additional concentration > 400 mg/dL. Results are summarized below.

Fingerstick and Alternative Site Testing Comparison Studies:
The sponsor performed a lay-user study where accuracy of the device was tested
using 111 fingerstick samples obtained by the lay-user and 111 samples per each
alternative site (the palm and the forearm) obtained by the lay-user. Participants, who
were able to read the User’s Manual in English, were instructed to read the manual
and perform testing on the finger and then the alternative sites. A technician
collected capillary blood for measurements on YSI. Results were obtained for each
of the alternative sites. Samples ranged from 55 to 474 mg/dL. Results are
summarized below.

This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, palm,
and forearm. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip there
are no special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
The meter is a non-coding meter, therefore no coding is required by the user.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor manufactures three levels of glucose control solution, Low, Level 1, and
Level 2 to be used with the MEG-2 glucose monitoring systems. These control
solutions must be purchased separately and are not provided with the device kits.
Instructions for how to purchase the control solution are provided in the user manuals.
To perform a control test the user is instructed to press the down or up buttons while
the blood drop symbol is flashing. The “ctl” symbol will then appear on the display.
An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. If the
control values fall outside these ranges, the user is referred to the user manual and
customer support for problems and more information
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. The device is intended for single-patient (MEG-2) or healthcare professional use (MEG-
2 Multi). Disinfection studies were performed on the MEG-2 meter and lancet device by
outside commercial laboratory testing services to determine the disinfection efficacy of
the meter and lancing device to the recommended cleaning and disinfection protocol,
and its effectiveness in preventing the spread of bloodborne pathogens, particularly
hepatitis B virus (HBV). Dispatch Hospital Cleaner Disinfectant Towels with Bleach
disposable wipes (EPA Reg. No: 56392-8) were validated, demonstrating complete
inactivation of live virus for use with the meter and lancing device. The sponsor also
conducted robustness studies and demonstrated that there was no change in performance
or in the external materials of the meter and lancing device after 1,825 cleaning and
disinfection cycles to simulate 5 years of use by lay-users and after 10,950 cleaning and
disinfection cycles to simulate 3 years of use by healthcare professionals. Each
robustness cycle tested consisted of one pre-clean wipe and one disinfecting wipe.
2. The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated with 3 lots of test strips using 10
test strips at each of 5 concentration ranges of glucose (30-50, 51-120, 121-170, 250-
350, 451-550 mg/dL). The glucose samples were prepared from venous blood samples
at 5 hematocrit levels at approximately 30, 35, 43, 50 and 55%. In total 750
measurements were made and each of the results compared to the value obtained from
the same plasma glucose concentration obtained by YSI. The % individual bias did not
exceed + 15% for all glucose concentrations within the hematocrit claimed range of 30
to 55%.
3. The effect of altitude was evaluated at five whole blood samples with glucose
concentrations ranging from 50 to 600 mg/dL, testing at sea level and 3150 meters
14

(10,334 feet above sea level). Each glucose concentration was measured 20 times at each
altitude. The bias was calculated relative to YSI at sea level and at 3150 meters. The
results demonstrate that the system meets the acceptance criteria for testing at altitudes
up to 3,150 meters (10,334 feet above sea level) with biases less than + 10% to YSI for
all glucose concentrations.
4. The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies at the combined extremes of
10°C/RH: 22%, 40°C/RH: 22%, 10°C/RH: 90%, and 40°C/RH: 90%, with venous blood
samples (50-400 mg/dL) that demonstrated that the MEG-2 and MEG-2 Multi meters
can be used at temperatures of 50 to 104°F (10 to 40°C) and 22% to 90% relative
humidity.
5. The sponsor provided a readability study and obtained Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level
Scores of 8.1, 8.2, and 8.1 for the MEG-2 test strip insert, MEG-2 Multi test strip insert,
and the control solutions insert, respectively. Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Scores of 7.2
and 7.5 were obtained for the MEG-2 User’s Manual and MEG-2 Multi User’s Manual,
respectively.
