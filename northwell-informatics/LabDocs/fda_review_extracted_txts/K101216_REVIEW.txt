of five levels protein (human) based serum. Each level contains Alpha-1-Antitrypsin,
Complement C3, Complement C4, Immunoglobulin G, Immunoglobulin A,
Immunoglobulin M and Transferrin analytes. The five levels demonstrate a linear
relationship to each other for Alpha-1-Antitrypsin, Complement C3, Complement C4,
Immunoglobulin G, Immunoglobulin A, Immunoglobulin M, and Transferrin analytes. It
is intended to simulate human patient serum samples and to detect systematic analytical
deviations of laboratory testing procedures for Alpha-1-Antitrypsin, Complement C3,
Complement C4, Immunoglobulin G, Immunoglobulin A, Immunoglobulin M, and
Transferrin. The product is intended for use with quantitative assays on the indicated
analyzer provided in the labeling. The Audit MicroCV Protein Linearity Set is “For In
Vitro Diagnostic Use Only.”
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The Audit™ MicroCV™ Protein Linearity Set should not be used for calibration or
standardization of the Alpha-1-Antitrypsin, Complement C3, Complement C4,
Immunoglobulin G, Immunoglobulin A, Immunoglobulin M or Transferrin assays.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Performance was established on the Beckman Immage analyzer.
I. Device Description:
The Audit™ MicroCV™ Protein Linearity Set is a protein (human) serum based,
aqueous quality control material containing five levels (Levels A through E) of Alpha-1-
Antitrypsin, Complement C3, Complement C4, Immunoglobulin G, Immunoglobulin A,
Immunoglobulin M and Transferrin. The set is used to confirm proper calibration, linear
operating range, and reportable range of the measured analytes. Level A contains Alpha-
1-Antitrypsin, Complement C3, Complement C4, Immunoglobulin G, Immunoglobulin
A, Immunoglobulin M and Transferrin concentrations near the lower limit level. Level E
contains Alpha-1-Antitrypsin, Complement C3, Complement C4, Immunoglobulin G,
Immunoglobulin A, Immunoglobulin M and Transferrin concentrations near the upper
limit level of chemistry analyzers. Levels B-D are related by linear dilution of Level A
and Level E.
All human source materials used to produce this product have been tested for HbsAg,
anti-HCV, HIV-1 and HIV-2 and found to be non-reactive by FDA cleared/approved
tests.

The Audit™ Micro CV™ Protein Linearity Set is prepared such that a linear
relationship exists among all five levels (Levels A through E). Level A has a
concentration near the lower limit level and Level E has concentrations near the upper
limit level of instruments. Levels B-D are related by linear dilution of Level A and
Level E using dilution schemes based on guidelines provided by NCCLS EP6-A.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
All components of the Audit™ Micro CV™ Protein Linearity Set are obtained from a
commercial vendor and inspected in-house.
Stability
Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable. Stability characteristics of the Audit Micro CV Protein Linearity Set were
determined using an accelerated study to predict closed vial shelf life for each level of
the linearity set. A closed vial shelf life of 1 year is expected at the recommended
storage temperature (2 to 8˚C). Real- time closed vial stability is ongoing. Real-time
opened vial stability studies were also performed. The sponsor states the open vial
stability is 24 hours (1 day) if stored tightly capped at 2 to 8 ˚C. Storage
recommendations are provided in the labeling.
Value Assignment
Expected values for the analytes in this submission were determined by repeat
analyses on the Beckman Immage analyzer. All seven analytes are cleared for use on
the Beckman Immage analyzer (Alpha-1-Antitrypsin (k964766), Complement C3
(k964842), Complement C4 (k964842), IgG, IgA, IgM (k993547) and Transferrin
(k963427). All seven analytes were measured 5 times and the mean values were used
to assign the target concentration values for each of the five linearity set levels. The
target ranges were calculated as ± 10% of the target value. The mean concentration
values of each level were plotted (concentration value vs. assigned level) and a linear
regression value obtained. If the five-point linear regression R2 value was greater that
0.95 and if the plots are linear, the product passed the linearity test. Values may
change depending on lot, instrumentation, methodology and assay temperature. Lot-
specific expected value ranges are provided in the package insert. Expected value
ranges for each level of the linearity set are summarized in the table below.
