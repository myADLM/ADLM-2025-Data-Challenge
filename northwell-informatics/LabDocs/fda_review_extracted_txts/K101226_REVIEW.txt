Stability:
Open Vial Stability:
5 vials of each level were left open for 30 minutes, then closed and stored at
2-8°C. This cycle is repeated 5 times (one cycle each day). Vials are tested at
the end of the 5 days. The results showed 0.0% - 15% difference from the day
zero results. The claimed open vial stability is 5 days when stored tightly
capped at 2-8°C.

each level were stressed at 37°C for 20 days. The percent loss is determined
in comparison to Day Zero values. The results showed 0.0% - 12.06%
difference from the day zero results. The shelf life is based on the accelerated
stability studies and on the on-going real-time stability studies. The claimed
shelf life is 19 months at 2-8°C.
Value assignment:
The reference materials that were used for value assignment are the
calibration and control sets provided by the manufacturers of the reagents –
Beckman for RF and Pointe Scientific for CRP. Hitachi 911 and Array
analyzers were used for CRP and RF respectively. The analyzers were
calibrated and the control was used with the value assignment run. Value
assignment for each level was based on 10 results for each level. Target
values were calculated. Expected vs. observed values were graphed and a
linear regression value was obtained to determine the linearity of the five
levels. The linear range is defined by the highest and lowest measured
concentrations where the response is linear. The dilution scheme is as
follows:
Level A = 100% Low Pool (no analyte)
Level B = 75% Low Pool, 25% High Pool
Level C = 50% Low Pool, 50% High Pool
Level D = 25% Low Pool, 75% High Pool
Level E = 100% High Pool
The results are summarized below:
