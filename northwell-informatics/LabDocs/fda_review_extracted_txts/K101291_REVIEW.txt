510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
k101291
B. Purpose for Submission:
Addition to the ScanView System of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
enumeration of the HER-2/neu gene for human breast cancer specimens
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Applied Spectral Imaging, Ltd., ScanView System
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Automated fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) enumeration of the HER-2/neu
gene in human breast cancer specimens (Vysis® PathVysion™ HER-2 DNA Probe
kit).
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The ScanView is an integrated digital imaging system constructed of an external
microscope, motorized multi slide stage, camera, and a workstation. It is
designed to acquire images of cells and enables identification and examination of
cells of interest. Pathologists can view and scan cells and record the image, using
both bright field and fluorescent illumination. The acquired images can be
enhanced, archived, retrieved and printed. The automated microscope enables Z
motion of the slide and the motorized stage enables its X-Y motions. The
microscope also included motorized filter turret containing fluorescence filters.
2. Principles of Operation:
The ScanView system works with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
stained human breast cancer tissue specimens by the Vysis® PathVysion™ HER-
2 DNA Probe kit. The user defines the regions containing tumor cells and
manually captures cells from these regions. The system automatically defines the
cells of interest and the pathologist then either chooses specific cells for analysis
or the system analyzes all of the cells from the selected regions. The red and
green signals and the ratio for each cell alone with the average amplification level
are calculated. The data are then presented to the pathologist for review. Each
cell is displayed in a gallery and the pathologist can reject any one of the cells or
modify its classification. The overall statistics are updated accordingly and only
at the end of this process, after the pathologist confirms the final score, is the
calculated amplification level printed out in a final report.
3. Modes of Operation:
Semi-automated; manual capture with computer-assisted interpretation
4. Specimen Identification:
Manual keyboard entry into a Case Data Manager.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimens are formalin-fixed paraffin embedded human breast cancer tissues
hybridized with the Vysis® PathVysion™ HER-2 DNA Probe Kit.
6. Calibration:
Calibration is performed at the time of installation.

7. Quality Control:
Control slides are prepared and run concurrently with patient slides according to
the Vysis® PathVysion™ HER-2 DNA Probe kit Instructions. The control slides
are tested on the ScanView System according to the same procedure as patient
slides. It is the responsibility of the pathologist to make assure the control slides
meet quality acceptance criteria.

is indicated to detect the following cell types:
1. CEP® X Spectrum Orange™/CEP® Y Spectrum Green™ DNA Probe kit
(Abbott Laboratories, Illinois, U.S.A.) and is limited to the analysis of CEP
XY probes via high magnification capture and analysis of interphase nuclei.
CEP XY is indicated for use to assess the effectiveness of bone marrow
transplantation in opposite-sex transplants.
2. Human breast cancer containing the HER-2/neu gene labeled in Red and the
centromere of chromosome 17 labeled in Green via fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) in interphase nuclei from formalin-fixed, paraffin
