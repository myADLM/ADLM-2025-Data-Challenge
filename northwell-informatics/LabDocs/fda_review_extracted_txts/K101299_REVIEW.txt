monitoring systems for self-testing in managing diabetes mellitus.
L. Test Principle:
When an ACCU-CHEK® Aviva Plus test strip is inserted into the ACCU-CHEK® Aviva meter, a
small alternating current (AC) is applied until the application of blood causes a spike in the
conductivity to be observed at the measurement and sample - sufficiency electrodes. Both are used
to assure an adequate sample has been applied. The meter then applies a series of AC voltages at
four frequencies and reads the AC responses. These carry information about the sample type and
environmental temperature; they also allow the system to perform various internal quality checks.
After the AC measures are completed, a small (DC) voltage is applied and current is observed
which is proportionate to the glucose. The AC and DC information are then combined to provide a
hematocrit and temperature compensated glucose result.
The enzyme on the test strip, a variant of glucose dehydrogenase, converts the glucose in the blood
sample to gluconolactone. This reaction creates a harmless DC electrical current that the meter
interprets for the blood glucose result. The sample and environmental conditions are also evaluated
using a small AC signal.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability Precision (Within Vial)
A total of 50 individual strip vials per each of three strip lots were used for data collection.
These vials were separated into 5 sets of 10 vials each and assigned to 1 of 5 venous blood
samples at varying concentrations.
Ten runs were performed on each sample, with an n = l0 replicates collected per vial/strip
lot. This resulted in a total of 100 replicates collected for each strip lot and glucose level
tested. Results are summarized in the table below.

The Aviva Plus system is calibrated to a hexokinase method on a laboratory analyzer. A
method comparison was performed using this method as the comparative method. See
Comparison studies in 2a below.
The controls recommended for the ACCU-CHEK Aviva Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring
System were cleared under k043474.
The sponsor provided a protocol and acceptance criteria to verify the closed-vial stability
(shelf life) and open vial stability of the test strips. The stability protocols and acceptance
criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor claims a closed-vial (shelf
life) and open-vial stability of 18 months when stored at 36 – 86° F (2 – 30° C)
d. Detection limit:
The claimed reportable range for the system is 20 – 600 mg/dL. This range was verified by
the linearity study (M.1.b) above.
e. Analytical specificity:
To assess potential interference, whole blood samples were spiked with glucose at
concentrations of approximately 25, 55, 120, 350, and 500 mg/dL and split into a control
sample and a test sample. Various endogenous and exogenous substances were then added
to the test sample only. Concentrations tested were at least three times the upper therapeutic
level (for drugs) or three times the highest expected concentration (for endogenous
substances). Concentrations listed in CLSI EP7-A2 were used when available. For
substances not listed in CLSI EP7-A2, other published references were consulted. Each
combination of glucose concentration and interferent concentration was analyzed 16 times
per strip lot using three strip lots for a total of 48 measurements per each combination of
glucose and interferent. The % difference between the test sample and the control sample
was calculated. The sponsor defines no significant interference as ≤ 10%.
Three compounds were found to cause significant interference:
Concentration at Which
Compound Name Significant Interference Criteria
was Seen (mg/dL)
Triglycerides > 1800
Galactose > 15
Ascorbic Acid > 3

--- Page 7 ---
The sponsor includes the following in the limitations section of the labeling:
• Lipemic samples (triglycerides) in excess of 1800 mg/dL may produce elevated results.
• Blood concentrations of galactose >15 mg/dL will cause overestimation of blood
glucose results.
• Intravenous administration of ascorbic acid which results in blood concentrations of
ascorbic acid >3 mg/dL will cause overestimation of blood glucose results.
The remaining compounds tested were found to not cause significant interference, as

Hematocrit study:
The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated using venous whole blood
samples with hematocrit levels of 10 – 65% (10,15, 20, 25, 30, 43, 50, 55, 60, and
65%) spiked with glucose to achieve target concentrations of 25, 55, 120, 350, and
500 mg/dL. Three strip lots were evaluated, and there were 30 measurements for
each combination of strip lot, glucose concentration, and hematocrit level tested. The
results demonstrated that the ACCU-CHEK Aviva Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring
System produces accurate results over the claimed hematocrit range of 10 – 65%.

System Accuracy:
To assess system accuracy, the ACCU-CHEK Aviva Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring
System was compared to a hexokinase – based reference method. All of the samples
were capillary fingersticks collected by a trained technician. Additional blood from
the same fingerstick was collected for the reference measurement.
If native samples could not be collected for glucose concentrations <50 mg/dL or >400
mg/dL, then samples could be collected into a Lithium heparin anticoagulant tube and
allowed to age in order to achieve a glucose concentration <50 mg/dL or spiked with
glucose to achieve a glucose concentration >400 mg/dL.
Five samples were allowed to glycolyze to achieve a concentration less than 50 mg/dL
and four samples were spiked to achieve a concentration greater than 400 mg/dL.
Linear regression based on single glucose measurements produced the following:

A user performance study was performed to compare the lay user self-test results to
the hexokinase reference method. The study was performed in 2 clinical sites. For
samples collected from the palm, 153 subjects collected capillary blood from the
thenar site and 161 subjects collected blood from the hypothenar site. No significant
difference was seen between the thenar and hypothenar sites, and they were combined
for a total of 314 measurements from the palm. Forearm samples were collected by
155 subjects and upper arm samples were collected by 156 subjects. Each subject
was asked to read the English version of the First Time Guide and Owner's Booklet,
which will be provided to users when the device is marketed. Subjects were not

N. Instrument Name:
ACCU-CHEK Aviva Blood Glucose Meter
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and requires a sample volume of 0.6 uL.
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,
or mobile device?
Yes __X__or No ______
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes __X__or No _______
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ____X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, palm,
forearm, and upper arm only. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip
by capillary action.
5. Calibration:
The meter is coded by the user by inserting a code key. The labeling instructs the user to
leave the code key in the meter until a new box of test strips is opened and to change the
14

--- Page 15 ---
code key each time a new box of test strips is opened.
6. Quality Control:
Controls are not included in the ACCU-CHEK Aviva Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring
System starter kit, but the labeling explains how users can obtain two levels of controls.
The labeling also provides recommendations on when to test control materials. The meter
can recognize a control solution automatically and control results are not stored in
memory. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label.
If the control values fall outside these ranges, the user is referred to a troubleshooting
chart which includes information on how to contact the Customer Care Service Center.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Infection Control studies: The ACCU-CHEK Aviva Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring
System is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were
performed on the materials comprising the meter and lancing device by an outside
commercial testing facility demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus
(HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, Super Sani-Wipes (EPA Registration Number 9480-
4). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was
no change in performance or external materials for the meter and lancing device after 260
cleanings and 260 disinfection steps with Super Sani-Wipes. The robustness studies were
designed to simulate 5 years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate
instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
2. A usability study was performed to assess the readability of the labeling by recruiting
untrained lay users who were provided with the test kit containing labeling for the US
market. These lay users also completed a questionnaire regarding the clarity of the
instructions and the ease of use of the device. The majority of the users responded that
they understood the instructions and were able to successfully operate the device.
3. Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted for the meter user’s manual and
test strip package insert and were found to be 7.5 and 8.2, respectively.
4. The Customer Care Service Center is available 24/7, 365 days a year. The toll free phone
number is 1‑800‑858‑8072.
5. The sponsor claims an operating condition range of 14 – 40° C and 10 – 80% relative
humidity. Combinations of the claimed temperature and humidity operating conditions
were evaluated by measuring whole blood samples at target glucose concentrations of 70,
120, and 250 mg/dL and comparing the meter results to a reference method. The results
demonstrated that the system produces accurate results over the claimed range of
operating conditions.
6. To evaluate the effects of altitude, glycolyzed venous blood samples from three donors
were spiked to glucose concentrations of approximately 40, 90, and 400 mg/dL and tested
15

--- Page 16 ---
in a glove box chamber set to simulate atmospheric conditions at 10,000 feet. Three lots
of glucose strips were tested in six runs with three replicates per run. This resulted in a
total of 18 replicates for each combination of strip lot, glucose level, and donor and a
total of 54 replicates overall. These studies demonstrated that altitudes up to 10,000 feet
have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements
7. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing was performed and found to be adequate in
k043474. The Aviva meter in this submission is identical to the one reviewed in
k043474.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
