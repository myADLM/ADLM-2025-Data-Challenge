L. Test Principle:
ARK Lamotrigine Assay is a homogeneous immunoassay based on competition
between drug in the specimen and lamotrigine labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for binding to the antibody reagent. As the latter
binds antibody, enzyme activity decreases. In the presence of drug from the
specimen, enzyme activity increases and is directly proportional to the drug
concentration. Active enzyme converts the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH that is measured spectrophotometrically as a rate of
change in absorbance. Endogenous serum G6PDH does not interfere with the results
because the coenzyme NAD functions only with the bacterial enzyme used in the
assay.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Performance was validated on the Roche/Hitachi 917 clinical chemistry analyzer.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision
Precision was determined as described in CLSI Protocol EP5-A2. Data were
collected on a Hitachi 917 analyzer over twenty (20) non-consecutive days.
Multiple calibrations were performed during this interval to provide variation,
although each calibration was performing in a stable manner. Three levels of
both control materials and human serum samples were tested in each run. Each
level was assayed in quadruplicate twice a day for 20 days. Calibrator/Control
matrix and pooled human serum were also tested in quadruplicate twice a day
for 5 days. Each of the runs per day was separated by at least two hours. The
within run, between day, total SD, and percent CVs were calculated. Results
are shown below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The manufacturer’s claimed assay reportable range is 0.85 to 40.0 μg/mL. The
assay range was established based on the linearity, together with limit of
quantitation (LOQ) and recovery/linearity studies. Method comparison
evaluated specimens near the upper quantitative limit. (See respective sections
below for specific information on performance).
Samples for the recovery/linearity study were prepared by gravimetric addition
of lamotrigine (USP > 99.9% purity) stock solution to human serum negative
for lamotrigine. Drug concentrations across the assay range (0.85, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0,
11.0, 15.0, 30.0 and 40.0 μg/mL) were tested. Each sample was assayed in
triplicate in each of two separately calibrated runs for a total of six replicates.
The results at each separate level were averaged and compared to the target
concentration (based on spiked concentrations of USP materials) and the
percentage recovery was calculated.
% Recovery = [100 X Mean recovered concentration]/Theoretical concentration
Theoretical Mean Recovered Recovery
Concentration Concentration (%)

0.85 0.84 98.2
1.00 0.99 99.2
2.50 2.48 99.3
5.00 5.25 105.1

15.00 14.80 98.7
30.00 29.16 97.2
40.00 38.33 95.8
Regression analysis of the data yields the equation, y(observed result) = 0.96 x
(target concentration) + 0.22, and regression coefficient r = 0.99.
High Sample Carryover
The impact of high lamotrigine concentration specimens on the measurement of
Lamotrigine in specimens with lower concentrations (high sample carryover)
was evaluated by assaying a series of high 100.0 μg/mL spiked serum sample
followed by a series of low 2.0 μg/mL spiked serum sample. No carryover was
observed from the High 100.0 μg/mL sample to the Low 2.0 μg/mL sample.

Manual Dilution Protocol
The manufacturer recommends that samples with concentrations exceeding 40.0
μg/mL should be diluted 4-fold with zero calibrator. Samples spiked with
lamotrigine and patient samples containing lamotrigine (with initial
concentrations ranging from 47.0 to 100 μg/mL) were diluted 4-fold with zero
calibrator and results using the ARK method were compared to the target level
(for spiked samples) and the HPLC-determined level (for neat samples). In
some cases natural patient samples containing lower levels of lamotrigine were
spiked to achieve higher concentrations for this evaluation. Concentrations
tested ranged from 47-100 μg/mL. Recoveries versus expected values using the
dilution procedure ranged from 93% to 96%.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, reagents,
sample or methods):
Traceability and Value Assignment of Calibrators and Controls
ARK Lamotrigine Calibrators and ARK Lamotrigine Controls are prepared by
gravimetric dilution of high purity lamotrigine (USP > 99.9 % purity) into a
synthetic proteinaceous matrix free of lamotrigine. Each calibrator and control
level is then qualified versus a master calibrator lot. Calibrator and control
production lots must demonstrate comparison to the master lot within 5% at
each positive calibrator and control level.
Quality control (QC) ranges were established using three runs with four
replicates tested per run (n=12 for each control level) and the mean lamotrigine
level of each control was calculated. Control ranges were set at ± 15% around
the mean level tested. The package insert notes that each laboratory should
establish its own ranges for each new lot of controls.
Specimen Stability
Stability of stored specimens (frozen storage and refrigerated exposure) and the
effect of freezing/thawing on the measurement of lamotrigine by the ARK™
Lamotrigine Assay were evaluated. Clarified serum specimens were shown to
be stable for at least four weeks frozen at ≤ -10 °C, and for a week when
refrigerated (2-8 °C). The manufacturer’s acceptance criteria for this evaluation
are recovery within ±10%. No trend was observed in the stability data. The
manufacturer notes that care should be taken to limit the number of freeze-thaw
cycles. Specimens were shown to withstand 3 freeze-thaw cycles when stored
at -20 °C.
The ARK Lamotrigine Calibrator and the ARK Lamotrigine Control are
comprised of a synthetic proteinaceous matrix with buffer, bovine serum
albumin and preservatives. To evaluate recovery and matrix equivalence,
synthetic calibrator/control matrix (Calibrator A) and pooled human serum were
supplemented with lamotrigine to achieve 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 11.0, 15.0, 30.0 and 40.0
μg/mL levels. Multiple replicates and runs were performed and the mean
6

--- Page 7 ---
Page 7 of 14
recovery (of replicates) was calculated for each level and each matrix. All
levels tested in the calibrator matrix recovered within 96% of the serum
lamotrigine levels. Recoveries (percentage of nominal level) ranged from 96%
to 104% for the calibrator/control matrix and from 96% to 105% for the serum
matrix (95.8% to 105.1%).
Calibration Stability on the analyzer
ARK provided a study on calibration stability on the analyzer. This study
supports the stable operation of the assay over an extended period based on one
calibration. Up to 30 days of calibration curve stability and in-use stability of
reagents, calibrators and controls were observed for the study as tested.
Calibrator and Control material Stability
1. The calibrators and controls are stable until the expiration date printed
on the vial when stored unopened and opened at 2-8 °C.
2. Real time stability studies are ongoing for both unopened and opened
calibrators and controls. Stability testing protocols and acceptance
criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
d. Detection Limit:
Accuracy and precision studies near the low range of the assay were conducted
to determine the manufacturer’s claimed lower limit of quantitation (LOQ)
according to CLSI Guideline EP-17. Three levels were tested below the lowest
positive calibrator concentration (1.0 μg/mL). Samples were prepared by
gravimetric addition of lamotrigine (USP > 99.9% purity) to human serum
negative for lamotrigine to give concentrations of 0.5, 0.75 and 0.85 μg/mL.
Eight replicates of each sample were tested in each of five runs on five separate
days to give a minimum of 40 replicates of each sample per reagent lot. A total
of three reagent lots were used for the study. The LOQ of the ARK
Lamotrigine Assay is defined as the lowest concentration for which acceptable
inter-assay precision (≤ 20% CV) and recovery (± 15%) is observed. The
criteria of LOQ were met at 0.85 μg/mL; the precision was 2.9 %CV and the
recovery was 90.1%.
e. Analytical Specificity:
Studies included testing for interference from endogenous compounds,
metabolite, and commonly co-administered and other anti-epileptic drugs.
Endogenous Interfering Substances
Serum samples with clinically high concentrations of the potential endogenous
interfering substances were tested by ARK Lamotrigine assay in the presence of
varying amounts of lamotrigine. Specifically, serum samples tested contained
lamotrigine at concentrations of 3.0 μg/mL and 15.0 μg/mL. Each sample
containing interferent was assayed, along with a serum control of lamotrigine.
No significant interference (defined by the manufacturer as ≤ 10% differences

and 15 μg/mL, respectively. The samples were analyzed and the lamotrigine
concentrations of samples containing interferent were compared to the serum
control. Cross-reactivity to Lamotrigine-2-N-glucuronide ranged from 1.09 to
2.91%, cross-reactivity to Lamotrigine-2-N-methyl ranged from 0.02 to 0.24%

Drugs that Cross-React - Trimethoprim
Cross-reactivity of the antibody to trimethoprim was analyzed from 5.0 to 40.0
μg/mL in the presence of either Low (3 μg/mL) or High (15 μg/mL)
concentration of lamotrigine and assayed along with a serum control of
lamotrigine. Interference was observed only at the low concentration of
lamotrigine. Recovery of lamotrigine ranged 111.2 to 156.0% with increasing
concentration of trimethoprim. The manufacturer notes in the package insert
that care should be taken when interpreting ARK Lamotrigine results if
trimethoprim is also being administered to the patient. The results are shown
below.

Drug Interference
Lamotrigine-selective antibody did not cross-react with most other anti-epileptic
or co-administered drugs tested. Due to structural similarities with lamotrigine,
high trimethoprim levels may interfere. A high concentration of each
compound shown below was spiked into normal human serum with known
levels of lamotrigine (approximately 3 and 15 μg/mL) and assayed along with a
serum control of lamotrigine. Measurement of lamotrigine resulted in ≤10%

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were performed according to CLSI Guideline EP9-
A2. Banked samples from patients tested for lamotrigine concentrations were
used. Inclusion criteria for the samples measured were based on lamotrigine
concentration. No exclusion criteria were used for selection of specimens. The
large majority of specimens were in a serum matrix. (See also matrix
comparison, below.)

Results from the ARK Lamotrigine Assay were compared with results from the
predicate device (QMS) at an external clinical laboratory site. Results
compared to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were also
included. Assay descriptions and summary validation for the comparative
methods were included in the 510(k).
The results are shown below:
Comparison to the predicate device:
Lamotrigine concentrations by the QMS Lamotrigine turbidimetric
immunoassay ranged from 2.28 to 37.70 μg/mL. ARK lamotrigine values
ranged 2.51 to 36.32 μg/mL. Results of the Passing-Bablok regression analysis
for the study are shown below (with 95% confidence limits).
95% confidence limits
Slope 0.93 (0.89 to 0.97)
y-intercept 0.41 μg/mL (0.07 to 0.74)
2 0.96 (0.94 to 0.97)
Correlation Coefficient (r )
Number of Samples 77
Results of the Pearson Bland Altman analysis gave a mean bias of -0.559, SE of
0.1876, and SD of difference as 1.646.
Comparison to an HPLC method
Lamotrigine concentrations by HPLC ranged 1.0 to 36.70 μg/mL. ARK
lamotrigine values ranged 0.97 to 36.32 μg/mL. Results of the Passing-Bablok
regression analysis for the study are shown below (with 95% confidence limits).
95% confidence limits
Slope 1.01 (0.99 to 1.03)
y-intercept 0.37 μg/mL (0.22 to 0.55)
2 0.97 (0.96 to 0.98)
Correlation Coefficient (r )
Number of Samples 193
Results of the Pearson Bland Altman analysis gave a mean bias of 0.42, SE of
0.0934, and SD of difference as 1.298.
b. Matrix Comparison-Serum versus Plasma:
Anticoagulated plasma and serum were evaluated to evaluate equivalency of
these matrices for measurement of lamotrigine with the ARK™ Lamotrigine

Assay. Matched samples for serum and plasma from eight (8) subjects (four
subjects at 35.0 μg/mL) were evaluated. Blood was collected in three different
anticoagulant tubes viz. lithium heparin, potassium EDTA, sodium heparin, and
a serum tube to produce a matched set. A lamotrigine stock solution was spiked
in each matrix to give a lamotrigine concentration of 35.0, 30.0, 15.0, 3.0 and
0.85 μg/mL. The mean, standard deviation and %CV for six replicates were
calculated for each sample. Also, correlation analysis was performed.
Percentage recovery of lamotrigine in anticoagulated samples compared to the
serum control was calculated for each subject. No significant differences were
observed between matrices. The overall percentage of serum levels of
lamotrigine in plasma ranged 92.9 to 106.3%, and the slope was 1.0, intercept
was -0.02 μg/mL, and correlation was r2 = 1.00.
In addition, the method comparison study (Section a, above) included five
plasma samples. In general, no significant differences were observed between
the results of these samples and the averaged serum samples.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable. Not typically submitted for this type of assay.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable. Not typical for this type of assay.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
The sponsor provided a discussion with balanced and representative literature
discussing clinical use of lamotrigine measurements.
4. Clinical cut-off:
See expected values below.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
In the labeling the manufacturer provides the following information:
The reference range of drug concentrations which is quoted should only imply a
lower limit below which a therapeutic response is relatively unlikely to occur, and
an upper limit above which toxicity is relatively likely to occur in the specific
patient populations studied. Generally, clinicians using reference ranges such as
these should be aware that, because of individual variation, patients may achieve
therapeutic benefit with serum drug concentrations outside of these ranges and
may experience toxicity with levels below the lower limit of the reference range.
Sampling time should be standardized such that trough serum concentrations are
measured just before the next dosage, preferably in the morning.

A therapeutic range for lamotrigine has not been well established. Some reports in
the literature suggest a target range for steady-state concentrations of 3.0 to 15
μg/mL. However, there is not a clear relationship between lamotrigine serum
concentrations and clinical response. Due to individual patient differences and
other co-administered medications, considerable overlap in lamotrigine
concentrations has been observed between serum responders and non-responders
as well as between serum levels associated with seizure control and adverse
effects. In one study, the highest mean serum level (trough) reported was 8.8
μg/mL, and less than 15% of patients reported an adverse event at serum
concentrations less than 10.0 μg/mL. Mild to moderate adverse effects are more
commonly associated with patients with lamotrigine concentrations above 15.0
μg/mL. Co-medications affect clearance of lamotrigine with enzyme-inducers
increasing and valproic acid decreasing clearance. Lamotrigine clearance is
higher in children than in adultsand moderately reduced in the elderly. Clearance
may be increased during pregnancy, but such increase is attenuated in women co-
medicated with valproic acid. Acute overdoses associated with serum levels
above 40.0 μg/mL (156 μmol/L) have been reported.
Lamotrigine drug concentrations should not be the only means of therapeutic drug
management. The assay should be used in conjunction with information available
from clinical evaluations and other diagnostic procedures. Clinicians should
carefully monitor patients during therapy initiation and dosage adjustments.
Multiple measurements of lamotrigine may be needed.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports
substantial equivalence decision.
