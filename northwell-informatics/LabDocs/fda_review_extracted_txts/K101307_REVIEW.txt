L. Test Principle:
The test is based on electrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of capillary
action. The electrical current generated by the reaction of glucose with the reagent of the strip
is measured by the meter and is displayed as the corresponding blood glucose level. The
strength of the current produced by the reaction depends on the amount of glucose in the
blood sample.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
AG-6081 and AG-6951 Blood Glucose Monitoring System
The sponsor claims that the system accuracy of the AG-6081 and AG-6951 meters is
calibrated to a laboratory analyzer, YSI 2300. A method comparison was performed
using the YSI 2300 as the comparative method. See comparison studies in 2a below.
Three levels of control material, Level I (60-90 mg/dL), Level II (99-149 mg/dL) and
Level III (253-379 mg/dL) are available for use with the AG-6081 BGMS. Three
levels of control material, Level I (58 – 88 mg/dL), level II (98 – 148 mg/dL) and
Level III (262-394) are available for use with the AG-6951 BGMS. These control
solutions are purchased from a commercial vendor (previously cleared under
k012430). The sponsor claimed the following for stability: The shelf-life of the AG-
1100 control is 24 months when stored between 36-86˚F (2-30˚C) and kept away
from direct sunlight and heat. Stability is 90 days when opened and stored at 36-86˚F
(2-30˚C).
Value assignment was performed by testing each level of control solution 100 times
using 10 meters (5- AG-6081 and 5 -AG-6951 meters).
c. Detection limit:
AG-6081 and AG-6951 Blood Glucose Monitoring System
The measuring range of the system is 20-600 mg/dL. This range was verified by the
linearity study above (section M.1.b)
d. Analytical specificity:
AG-6081 and AG-6951 Blood Glucose Monitoring System
Whole blood samples were spiked to nominal glucose concentrations of 80, 120 and
350 mg/dL. Each spiked sample was then divided into a test pool and a control pool.
Each potential interfering substance was added to the test pool. Each level was
analyzed for a total of 5 times with two AG-6081 meters and a total of five times
using two AG-6951 meters. Three lots of AG-1100 test strips were used. The
difference between the control sample and the sample containing the interfering
substance were calculated. The sponsor defines no significant interference as ≤10%
difference.

The sponsor has the following limitations in their labeling: “Metabolites: Ascorbic
Acid and bilirubin at normal blood concentration does not significantly affect glucose
readings. High concentrations of acetaminophen, dopamine, L-dopa, methyldopa,
tolbutamide and uric acid may cause inaccurate test results. Blood glucose readings
should be interpreted with caution. Lipemic Effects: Elevated blood triglycerides up
to 2000 mg/dL do not significantly affect the results.”

AG-6081 Single and AG-6081 MULTI Blood Glucose Monitoring System
The sponsor performed accuracy studies to demonstrate that the AG-6081 meter is
equivalent to the YSI 2300 reference method. Capillary samples from 100 volunteers
with glucose concentrations distributed over the range of 25.5 – 526 mg/dL were
evaluated at two different hospitals (n=100). Each blood sample from the volunteers
was divided into two, one was tested by YSI-2300 and the other was tested by the
AG-6081 blood glucose monitoring system. Percent distribution of the samples
corresponding to the glucose concentration ranged as follows: <50 mg/dL-9%; 51-80
mg/dL- 14%; 81-20 mg/dL- 18%; 121- 200 mg/dL – 26%; 201-300 mg/dL – 16.5%;
301-400 mg/dL – 8.5% ; and >400mg/dL – 8%. To obtain the blood glucose
concentrations < 50 mg/dL and >500 mg/dL, samples were allowed to glycolyze or
were spiked to achieve desired glucose concentrations. The results relative to YSI are
summarized in the tables below.

The applicant has provided documentation that indicates the device was designed and
developed under good software life-cycle processes.
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip, the
palm, the forearm, the upper arm, the calf, and thigh. The whole blood is applied directly
to the test strip so therefore no special handling or storage is needed.
5. Calibration:
One code function (No Code). The AGS-1100 test strips contain the calibration code.
There is no coding by the user.
6. Quality Control:
One level of glucose control solution (Level ll), is provided within the kit from the
sponsor. An additional two levels Level l and Level lll are available for purchase
separately, as stated in the labeling. The labeling provides instructions on when to test
control materials. To perform a control test on the AG-6081 and the AG-6951 meters, the
user is instructed to press the M button in step 2. Once the “CTL” appears on the screen
the control results will be prevented from being stored in memory. An acceptable range
for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. If the control values fall
outside these ranges, the user is referred to customer support for problems and more
information.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Altitude Studies: Capillary whole blood samples from 20 volunteers with glucose
concentrations, according to YSI, ranging from 61-406 mg/dL on the AG-6081 meter and
60-334 mg/dL on the AG-6951 meter. Results were compared to YSI values and resulted
in no significant bias (≤ 10%) for all samples tested. The data submitted support use of
the devices up to 10,744 feet.
2. Temperature and humidity studies: The sponsor performed temperature and humidity
studies using the AG-6081 and the AG-6951 meters with venous whole blood samples at
5 glucose levels (44, 74, 169, 278 and 528 mg/dL). Results demonstrated that both
systems (meters and test strips) can be used in conditions of 50˚-104˚F (10-40˚C) with
19

--- Page 20 ---
relative humidity 25-80% and stored under conditions of 39.0˚F -86˚F and relative
humidity of <80%. No significant effect (≤ 10% relative to YSI) was observed at the
temperature and humidity combinations tested. The following combinations were tested:
low temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity, high temperature/low
humidity and high temperature/high humidity. The results support the claims in the
labeling that the system can be used in conditions of 50 to 104˚F (10-40˚C) with relative
humidity of 25-80%.
3. Sample volume studies were performed using venous blood samples 48, 55, 114,143,
226, 377, and 453 mg/dL) and of each meter (AG-6081 and AG-6951). Three volumes
were tested (0.5, 0.6, and 0.7µL). The recommended minimum sample volume is 0.7µL.
Seven glucose concentrations were tested ranging from approximately 48-450 mg/dL, as
determined by the YSI. Results support the claimed sample volume of 0.7µL.
4. Infection Control Studies: The devices are intended for single-patient us (AG-6081 and
AG-6951 Single) or multiple-patient use (AG-6081 Multi and AG-6951 Multi).
Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meters and
lancing device by outside commercial testing demonstrating complete inactivation of
hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, CaviWipes (EPA Registration
#46781-8). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that
there was no change in performance or external materials for each of the meters and
lancing device after 11,000 cleanings and 11,000 disinfection steps with the CaviWipes.
The robustness studies were designed to stimulate 3 years of multiple-patient use and 5
years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the
validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
5. The sponsor provided a readability study and obtained SMOG Grade Level scores of 8 for
the User’s Manual, test strip insert and control solution insert.
6. Hematocrit Study - The effect of hematocrit levels of 20-65% was tested on whole blood
samples spiked with nine hematocrit levels (20, 25, 30, 35, 45, 50, 55, 60, and 65%) at
glucose concentrations distributed within the measuring range (20 – 600mg/dL) of the
device. The values generated were compared with the glucose values from YSI-2300
analyzer. The results generated by the device are comparable to the values of YSI-2300
analyzer at hematocrit levels between 20-60%. The candidate devices did not show any
significant bias (≤ ± 15%) versus the reference method within the measuring range of 20-
60%. The sponsor will claim a hematocrit range of 20 -60%.
7. The sponsor provided the appropriate documentation certifying that electromagnetic
testing (EMC) had been performed and the AG-6081 and AG-6951 were found compliant
(IEC 61326, IEC 61010)
Q. Proposed Labeling:
