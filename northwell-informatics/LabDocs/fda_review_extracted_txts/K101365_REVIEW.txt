Material
L. Test Principle:
Per sponsor: Clalibration verification is not a requirement of the Elecsys and cobas e
immunoassay systems based on the manufacturer’s recommendations.
However, in instances where such a test procedure is required by certification
agencies, or where the user wishes to document calibration verification, these
CalCheck 5 solutions provide an appropriate material for such testing.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The Elecsys CA 19-9 CalCheck 5 was initially standardized against the
Enzymun Test CA 19-9.
Value assignment:
The five levels of the CalCheck 5 kit are assigned based on the measuring
range of the assay. Samples were run in duplicates on 4 E170 analyzers for a
total of 8 runs on 2 days, and on 3 Elecsys 2010 analyzers on one day and 4
Elecsys 2010 analyzers on one day for a total of 7 runs on 2 days. The
Modular Analytics E170 master calibration curve is used to calculate U/mL
from counts. The table below summarizes the assigned values and ranges for
Elecsys CA 19-9 CalCheck 5 lot that was used in this submission on the E170:

Stability:
Opened-vial and accelerated stability studies were completed on the
MODULAR ANALYTICS E170.
Open Vial Stability:
One lot of Elecsys CA 19-9 CalCheck 5 (Check 1-5) was evaluated in
duplicate on the E170. The test material was reconstituted and stored for 4
hours at 25ºC and compared to reference material that was a freshly
reconstituted set of CalChecks. The claimed stability for reconstituted
Elecsys CA 19-9 CalCheck 5 is up to 4 hours at 20-25°C.
On-Board Stability
Not applicable
Accelerated Stability % Real time Stability:
One Elecsys CEA CalCheck 5 lot was evaluated in duplicate on the Elecsys
E170. The test material was stored lyophilized at 35°C for 3 weeks. The
reference material was a freshly reconstituted set of CalChecks, stored at 4°C.
After 3 weeks, the test and reference materials were tested in duplicate and
compared.
Real-time stability study is ongoing. The shelf life stability is based on the
accelerated stability study of the CalCheck 5 and the real-time stability studies
of three-level CalCheck (because of the identical composition of the 3-level
and 5-level CalChecks). The initial shelf life stability claim is 18 months
when stored at 2-8°C.
d. Dilution Study
A study is suggested in the package insert in the event CalCheck Levels 1 or 5
produce results that exceed the reportable measuring range of the assay. To
demonstrate that the values are within the assay’s measuring range of 0.600–
1000 U/mL, the following dilution study was performed: Check 1&2 and
Check 4&5 were mixed in a 1:1 ratio and measured in duplicates. Per the
sponsor specification, the diluted value must fall within the assay’s measuring
range: 0.6 – 1000U/mL. Results of a dilution study are summarized in the
table below:
