I. Device Description:
The ALPHA Histoplasma Antigen EIA is a two-stage immunoenzymatic sandwich
microplate assay which detects Histoplasma antigens in urine. Rabbit polyclonal anti-
Histoplasma IgG antibodies bound to microwell plates are used as capture antibodies
and biotinylated rabbit polyclonal anti-Histoplasma IgG antibodies are used as detect
antibodies. Urine samples are run untreated and undiluted.

--- Page 3 ---
The prepared samples are added to microwells coated with capture antibody and
incubated. If the patient specimen contains Histoplasma antigens that are recognized
by the capture antibody, those antigens will become bound to the microwell. The
wells are washed to remove unbound patient material and biotinylated detection
antibody is added to the wells. If Histoplasma antigens are bound to the microwell by
the capture antibody, then the detect antibody will also become bound to the
microwell. The wells are then washed to remove any unbound detect antibody.
Streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) is added to the microwells.
In the presence of the biotinylated detect antibody, streptavidin-HRP will become
bound to the plate. The plate is then washed to remove any unbound streptavidin-
HRP, and 3,3’,5,5’ tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate solution is added to the
microwells. A blue color develops in the presence of the HRP enzyme. The reaction
is stopped by the addition of a stop solution. The optical density (absorbance) is
determined with a microplate reader at 450 nm alone or at 450nm and 630 nm. EIA
Units for specimens are calculated using a four parameter curve-fit generated with the
4 standards supplied in the kit.

L. Test Principle:
The ALPHA Histoplasma Antigen EIA is a two-stage immunoenzymatic sandwich
microplate assay which detects Histoplasma antigens in urine. Rabbit polyclonal anti-
Histoplasma IgG antibodies bound to microwell plates are used as capture antibodies
and biotinylated rabbit polyclonal anti-Histoplasma IgG antibodies are used as detect
antibodies. Urine samples are run untreated and undiluted. The prepared samples are
added to the microwells coated with the capture antibody and incubated. If the patient
specimen contains Histoplasma antigens that are recognized by the capture antibody,
those antigens will become bound to the microwell. The wells are washed to remove
unbound patient material and biotinylated detection antibody is added to the wells. If
Histoplasma antigens are bound to the microwell by the capture antibody, then the
detect antibody will also become bound to the microwell. The wells are then washed
to remove any unbound detect antibody. Streptavidin conjugated to horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) is added to the microwells. In the presence of the biotinylated
detect antibody, streptavidin-HRP will become bound to the plate. The plate is then
washed to remove any unbound streptavidin-HRP, and 3,3’,5,5’ tetramethylbenzidine
(TMB) substrate solution is added to the microwells. A blue color develops in the
presence of the HRP enzyme. The reaction is stopped by the addition of a stop
solution. The optical density (absorbance) is determined with a microplate reader at
450 nm alone or at 450nm and 630 nm. EIA Units for specimens are calculated using
a four parameter curve-fit generated with the 4 standards supplied in the kit.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
i. Study Design: Three sites, a reference laboratory (RL) (Western
US), a clinical laboratory (CL) (Upper Mid-Western US), and
IMMY (Central US), were used to assess the assay’s
reproducibility. The panel consisted of urine samples at five
levels: negative, high negative (C ), cut-off (C ), low positive
5 50
(C ), and moderately positive. At the reference laboratory and at
95
IMMY, each sample was tested in triplicate over the course of five
5

--- Page 6 ---
days, using multiple operators. At the clinical laboratory, each
sample was tested in triplicate over the course of three days, using
a single operator. Throughout the study, reagent lots and
instrument calibrations were held constant. No runs were removed
from analysis due to failed runs.
ii. Results/Acceptance Criteria: Variance was estimated by
calculating the mean value of each sample, the standard deviation
and percent CV, according to EP5-A2. The data was analyzed
separately to evaluate any inter-assay, intra-assay, and inter-site
variation. Overall, no major source of variability was identified.
Intra-run, Inter-Run, and Inter-site percent CVs are within
acceptable limits (≤ 20%), with the exception of the negative urine
and low negative urine samples, which is expected when testing
beyond the limit of detection. A summary of the data is reported in
the tables below.

iv. Prozone Studies: To detect the prozone effect in the ALPHA
Histoplasma Antigen EIA, negative urine was spiked with Histoplasma
antigen to 2000, 3000, and 4000 EIA units (the top of the standard curve is
100 EIA units). Each sample was tested in duplicate. All samples
remained strongly positive. The results are found in table below:

v. Single Versus Dual Wavelength Study: Eight positive urine samples and
the four standards in the kit were tested in duplicate and according to the
package insert. The microwells were read at 450/630 nm and then at 450
nm only. Line data is provided in the below. The average, standard
deviation, and percent CV was calculated for each sample using all four
data points (both replicates using both reading protocols). The study
confirmed that the blanked OD of the samples is not affected by the read
method, as indicated by the low percent CVs. Furthermore, 450/630 vs.
450 alone can be used with equal accuracy, and data from the two methods
can be used interchangeably. Acceptance criteria were defined as % CV

The users are instructed to run all specimens and controls in duplicate until
the user becomes familiar with the kit performance. The Positive Control,
Negative Control, and EIA standards must be assayed with each batch of
patient specimens to provide quality assurance of the reagents. The
Positive and Negative Controls are intended to monitor for substantial
reagent failure. The Positive Control should not be used as an indicator of
EIA standards precision and only ensures reagent functionality. The

Positive Control EIA units should be between 7 and 13. The Negative
Control EIA units should be less than 2.
If the EIA units of the Positive Control and/or Negative Control are not
within these parameters, patient test results should be considered invalid,
and the assay should be repeated.
ii. Specimen Stability Studies: In specimen stability studies, negative urine
was spiked at four concentrations: Low-positive (C95), low-positive, and
two moderate-positives. Specimens were divided and then stored at 4°C
and -20°C. The set stored at 4°C was followed daily for stability over the
course of one week. One set stored at -20°C went through multiple
freeze/thaw cycles and was tested after each cycle. A second set was
stored for one week without multiple freeze/thaw cycles, and a third set
was stored for 2 weeks without multiple freeze/thaw cycles. When tested,
each sample was run in duplicate. While there were reductions in EIA
values after a 2-week storage at 4°C and after multiple freeze thaws, no
specimen went from positive to negative. Since a reduction in EIA values
was observed, it is possible that a fresh, very low-positive specimen (near
2.0 EIA units) could become negative if it is stored for several days.
Results of the studies (averages of Blanked OD and EIA Units) are
summarized below.

iv. Time Parameter Studies for Reading the Test: To demonstrate that the test
should be read within 15 minutes after the addition of the Stop Solution,
all the standards were run in triplicate according to the package insert.
The test was then read immediately after the addition of the Stop Solution,
and then at 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 minutes. The signal began to
decrease after 15 minutes and continued to decrease over the course of 90
minutes.

Limit of Detection Calculations:
LoD = LoB + c SD
β s
where SD is the standard deviation of the sample measurements and c is
s β
derived from the 95th percentile of the standard Gaussian distribution:
c = 1.645/(1-1/(4 x f)), where f is the degrees of freedom from the SD .
β s
f = N – K where N is the total number of measurements (9
s s
x 30) and K is number of sources of measurements (9)
LoD = 0.009 + (1.645/(1-1/(4 x (270-9))))(0.021)
LoD = 0.044 OD
Analysis shows that the LoB is 0.009 RAW OD and LoD is 0.044 BLANKED
OD. Our 2.0 EIA units calibrator is approximately equivalent to this Limit of
Detection (0.044 OD).
e. Analytical specificity:
i. Cross-Reactivity Studies: Urine specimens that tested negative for
Histoplasma antigen were spiked with antigen from Blastomyces dermatiditis,
Coccidioides immitis, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus
flavus, Aspergillus terreus, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and Candida
albicans, individually, at 1 µg/mL. The ALPHA Histoplasma Antigen EIA
was found to be cross-reactive with Blastomyces dermatiditis, Coccidioides
immitis, and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis in urine. The assay was not cross-
reactive with Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, or Aspergillus
spp. in urine. Source/Strain information of culture filtrates used in cross-
reactivity testing are shown in table below:

ii. Interfering Substances: Urine specimens containing various potential
interfering substances were obtained from a national reference laboratory.
Each specimen was tested in duplicate using the IMMY ALPHA
Histoplasma Antigen EIA to assess the potential for false positive
reactivity in the assay. Additionally, each specimen was spiked with
Histoplasma antigen and tested in the assay. None of these substances
were found to interfere with the ALPHA Histoplasma Antigen EIA. The
data from this study is summarized in the table below. The “Interfering
Value” is given as reported by the reference laboratory.

*Specimen was blue in color, reason unknown
Vaginal cream urines and foods which produce color in urine were not
tested. Additionally, drugs, such as itraconazole, amphotericin B,
acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, ascorbic acid, and caffeine were not
tested for interference.
f. Assay cut-off:
i. Study Design: The assay cut-off was established following CLSI EP12-
A2 and EP17-A. The 2 EIA units standard was created to be equivalent
to the LoD. Using the 2 EIA units standard as the cut-off, the C -C
5 95
Interval and C were determined by running 30 replicates of 9 samples
50
spiked with Histoplasma antigen around the 2 EIA units standard. Percent
positive was determined by the number of samples that ran equal to or
greater than the average blanked OD of the 2 Standard. The percentage of
replicates that ran positive was calculated for each sample in the table
below. The Receiver Operator Curve (ROC) analysis of culture-proven
specimens indicated a lower cut-off of 1.3 EIA units (figure below). The
ROC value is below the Limit of Detection, and therefore considered an
inappropriate cutoff. As such, an equivocal zone was not created, as all
data firmly supported a cut-off of 2.0 EIA units.

The C is 1.50 and the C is 2.50 EIA Units while the C is 2.00 EIA

Units. C is a good indicator of an assay’s cut-off. However, ROC
50
analysis indicated a lower cut-off of 1.3 EIA units. Since this is below the
calculated LoD of the assay, the C was used to establish the cut-off.

Since analytical sensitivity (LoD) was more conservative than the clinical
sensitivity (ROC analysis), an equivocal zone was not created.
The assay cut-offs are defined as follows:
Negative: < 2.0 EIA Units (Limit of Detection)

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity
i. Study Design: The clinical performance of the ALPHA Histoplasma
Antigen EIA was evaluated using a total of 278 culture- or histopathology-
confirmed urine specimens (47 culture/histopathology-positive and 231
culture/histopathology-negative). Specimens were obtained and tested at
three geographically diverse hospitals/reference laboratories. All
specimens were obtained from patients suspected of experiencing active
disease by a physician and confirmed through culture or histopathology.
Clinical sensitivity and specificity were calculated according to CLSI
EP12-A2.
ii. Results: The data from this study demonstrated that the ALPHA
Histoplasma Antigen EIA has an 80.9 % sensitivity (CI: 67.5-89.6%) and
98.7% specificity (CI 96.3-99.6%), when compared to culture and/or
histopathology, the current “gold standard” for diagnosis of
histoplasmosis. The results are summarized in the tables below.

a) An independent comparison between culture/histopathology and the
ALPHA Histoplasma Antigen EIA Kit was presented at the College of
American Pathologists 2008 Annual meeting. A poster titled “Utility
of a Histoplasma capsulatum Enzyme Immunoassay for Diagnosis of
Disseminated Histoplasmosis and Correlation with Disease Activity”
was presented *. In the IRB approved study, Cox, et. al. reported that

during the course of one year, they enrolled 177 patients with
suspected histoplasmosis and tested their urine specimens with the
ALPHA Histoplasma Antigen EIA. Of those, only six were actually
diagnosed with histoplasmosis through culture and/or histopathology.

b) Additional studies were performed using a non-FDA cleared
Histoplasma capsulatum quantitative antigen EIA and resulted in a
positive percent agreement of 71.4% (CI: 57.6-82.2%) and negative
percent agreement of 94.0% (CI: 83.8-97.9%) when the non-FDA
cleared test’s equivocals were assumed positive. When the equivocals
were assumed negative, positive percent agreement was 92.1% (CI:
79.2-97.3%) and negative percent agreement was 95.1% (CI: 86.5-
98.3%).
b. Clinical specificity:
Clinical specificity was tested using non-Histoplasma, fungal culture-positive
urines. The results from this study are summarized in the table below:

The clinical cut-off is the same as the assay cut-off. (Also see Section 3.f.)
Negative: EIA Units x < 2.0
Positive: EIA Units x > 2.0
The clinical performance of the ALPHA Histoplasma Antigen EIA was evaluated
using a total of 278 culture- or histopathology-confirmed urine specimens (47
culture/histopathology-positive and 231 culture/histopathology-negative).
Specimens were obtained and tested at three geographically diverse
hospitals/reference laboratories. All specimens were obtained from patients
suspected of experiencing active disease by a physician and confirmed through
culture or histopathology.
The clinical cut-off values are interpreted as follows:
• Negative results do not rule out the diagnosis of disease as the specimen may
be drawn before detectable antigen is present.
• A positive result implies the presence of antigen to Histoplasma; however, all
test results should be reviewed in light of other clinical data by the physician.
• The magnitude of the measured result, above the cutoff, is not indicative of
the total amount of antigen present.
• Specimens should be repeated if the results are low-positive and inconsistent
with clinical findings.
• Specimens should be repeated if the results are indeterminate or low-positive
and inconsistent with clinical findings.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The frequency of histoplasmosis is dependent on several factors including: patient
population, type of institution, and epidemiology. In this study, 80.9% of true
positives determined by culture and/or histopathology were detected.
