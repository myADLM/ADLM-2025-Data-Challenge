H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use:
For use with MicroScan® Dried Gram Negative MIC/Combo Panels and Dried
Gram Negative Breakpoint Combo Panels. MicroScan® panels are designed for
use in determining antimicrobial agent susceptibility and/or identification to the
species level of aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacilli.
The MicroScan® Dried Gram Negative MIC/Combo Panels is used to determine
quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies
grown on solid media of rapidly growing aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram
negative bacilli.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The MicroScan® Dried Gram Negative MIC/Combo Panels is used to determine
quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies
grown on solid media of rapidly growing aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram
negative bacilli. After incubation, panels are incubated for 16- 20 hours at 35ºC
+/- 1ºC in a non-CO incubator, and read either visually or with MicroScan
2
instrumentation, according to the Package insert.
This particular submission is for the addition of Doripenem at concentrations
0.008 to 32µg/mL to the test panel.
The gram-negative organisms which may be used for Doripenem susceptibility
testing in this panel are:
Acinetobacter baumannii
Escherichia coli
Klebsiella pneumoniae
Proteus mirabilis
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
• For prescription use only
• The Log and Stationary Inoculum methods should not be used with
Doripenem.
• The Prompt™ method of inoculation is an alternate method of inoculation
preparation that is supported in the methodology along with the turbidity
method.

--- Page 3 ---
4. Special instrument requirements:
MicroScan® WalkAway® System and MicroScan® autoSCAN®-4 are the
alternate read methods for Doripenem
I. Device Description:
The MicroScan® Dried Gram-Negative MIC/Combo Panel contains micro-dilutions
of each antimicrobial agent in various concentrations with Mueller Hinton Broth and
various nutrients which are dehydrated and dried in panels. Each panel contains two
control wells: a no-growth control well (contains water only/no nutrients or broth),
and a growth control well (contains test medium without antibiotic). The panel is
rehydrated and inoculated at the same time with 0.1 ml of suspension prepared by the
turbidity method (inoculum prepared in water, then 0.l ml transferred to 25 ml of
inoculum water containing pluronic-D/F-a wetting solution). The Prompt® method
of inoculation is also recommended as an alternate means of preparing the inoculum.
The panels are incubated at 35ºC in a non-CO for 16- 20 hours and read by visual
2
observation for growth. Panels may also be read automatically with the WalkAway®
and autoSCAN®-4 Systems.

L. Test Principle:
After incubation in non-CO incubator for 16- 20 hours, the MIC for the test
2
organisms are read by determining the lowest antimicrobial concentration showing
inhibition o f growth. The panels are read either visually or automatically with the
WalkAway® and autoSCAN®-4, which uses an optics system with growth
algorithms to directly measure organism growth.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using 10 isolates tested at three sites on three
separate days in triplicate. The study included the testing of the following
inoculum and reading variables; turbidity inoculum method and Prompt method
of inoculation with reading performed manually, by WalkAway instrument and
autoSCAN-4 instrument. All results were >95% reproducible.

There were more results in the minus category (one dilution lower) when reading
manually with the Prompt or the turbidity inoculation methods; however, there
were more results in the plus category when using the auto reader (WalkAway or
autoScan). The same trend was also observed in the challenge study.

The recommended QC isolates, E.coli ATCC 25922 and P. aeruginosa ATCC
27853 were tested a sufficient number of times with acceptable results most of
the time with the reference method. Quality control results demonstrated the
ability of the different reading parameters (manual, WalkAway, and autoScan)

tested, there were 74 Acinetobacter baumannii, 330 Enterobacteriaceae, 131
Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There were 75 challenge isolates tested and
compared to the reference broth dilution result mode that was determined by
previous testing of each isolate multiple times in the recommended reference
panel. All isolates grew in the MicroScan panels.
Efficacy testing was performed using the turbidity inoculation method and
read manually after incubation for 16- 20 hours at 35ºC +/- 1ºC in a non-CO
2
incubator. A comparison to the reference method was provided with the
following agreement.

EA - Essential Agreement NS – Not Susceptible
CA - Category Agreement
EA is when there is agreement between the reference method and the new method is within plus or
minus one serial two-fold dilution of antibiotic. Category agreement (CA) is when the new method
result interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result interpretation. Evaluable EA is
when the MIC result is on scale for both the new method and the reference method and have on-
scale EA.
There were thirteen categorical errors in the Efficacy study; eleven of which
were from P. aeruginosa, one from A. baumannii, all were within EA and one
dilution lower when comparing to the reference method. A limitation was
included when testing P. aeruginosa with Doripenem.
A challenge set was tested at one site. The challenge set of organisms was
tested using both Prompt and Turbidity inoculation methods and read either
visually or with MicroScan instrumentation (autoSCAN-4, WalkAway). The
table below demonstrated those that were in exact agreement with the
reference method result and those that differed by one or more 2-fold
dilutions:

Overall EA in the challenge study was >90% by all reading methods with both
Prompt and Turbidity inoculation methods, and they all were in similar exact
agreement. However, there were more results in the plus category with the
WA and AS4 reads in both inoculation methods. With the Manual reads,
more results were in the minus category. The trend was consistent with the
reproducibility study data.

CLSI interpretive breakpoints have not been established when the Doripenem was
submitted for review.
The current absence of resistant isolates precludes defining results other than
Susceptible. Isolates yielding MIC results suggestive of Non-susceptible category
should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The expected value range, interpretive criteria and QC for gram negative panels are
included in the package insert. The labeling is sufficient and satisfies the
requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
