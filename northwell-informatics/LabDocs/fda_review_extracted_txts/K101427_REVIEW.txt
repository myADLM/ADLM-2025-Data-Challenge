H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indication for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Audit™ MicroCV™ hs-CRP Linearity Set is assayed quality control
material consisting of five levels human based serum. Each level contains
High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs -CRP) analyte. The five levels
demonstrate a linear relationship to each other for High Sensitivity C-
Reactive Protein (hs -CRP) analyte. It is intended to simulate human
patient serum samples for purpose of monitoring and detecting systematic
analytical deviations of laboratory testing procedures for High Sensitivity
C-Reactive Protein (hs -CRP). This product may be used as quality control
material for High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs -CRP) analyte. When
used for quality control purposes, it is recommended that each laboratory
establish its own means and acceptable ranges and use the values provided
only as guides. The product is intended for use with quantitative assays on
the indicated analyzer provided in the labeling. The Audit™ MicroCV™
hs-CRP Linearity Set is “For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only”
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
AUDIT® MicroCV™ hs-CRP Linearity Set is not to be used for
calibration or standardization of the hs-CRP assay.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The performance was established on the Hitachi 911 analyzer.
I. Device Description:
The Audit™ MicroCV™ hs-CRP Linearity Set is an in vitro diagnostic device
consisting of five levels of liquid linearity materials containing hs-CRP and
additives in human serum. There are 5 vials labeled A, B, C, D, and E, and
contain 2 mL for each level.
Material of human origin used in the manufacture of this test set has been
tested using FDA approved methods and found to be non-reactive for HBsAg
and antibodies to HCV and HIV-1/2.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None were referenced
L. Test Principle:
Not Applicable
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not Applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
Traceability and Value assignment
Component is obtained from an approved vendor and inspected by
the sponsor upon arrival.
Value assignment is performed on one Hitachi 911 instrument with
one lot of reagent for hs-CRP analyte. hs-CRP was measured 5
times (5 separate vials) and the mean value of hs-CRP was used to
establish target concentration values at each level. The target
ranges were calculated as ± 20% of the target value. The mean
concentration values of each level are plotted (concentration value
vs. assigned level) and a linear regression values obtained and
evaluated.
Stability studies:
Open-Vial Stability:
Five vials of levels A, B, C, D and E are opened and exposed to the
environment for 30 minutes then closed and repeated for a total of
3 cycles. Vials are then closed and stored for 10 days at 2 – 8º C.
The percent loss is determined in comparison to Day Zero values.

The protocol, data and acceptance criteria were found to be
adequate.
The data supported the package insert claims that the analyte is
stable after opening the vial when stored at 2 – 8º C for 10 days.
Accelerated Stability:
Five vials of levels A ,B.C.D and E were stressed at 37º C for 20
days to predict two-year stability when stored at 2 – 8º C.
Performance data was collected through “destructive testing” by
Quality Control according to specifications. The protocol, data and
acceptance criteria were found to be adequate. Accelerated
stability studies are supported by an on-going real-time stability
study.
.
Homocysteine Linearity Set was evaluated on the Hitachi 911
analyzer with Pointe hs-CRP reagents.
The shelf life claim is 24 months. This is based on the accelerated
stability results and on-going real-time stability studies.
