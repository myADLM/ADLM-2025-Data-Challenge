I. Device Description:
The Audit™ MicroCV™ Procalcitonin Linearity Set is a bovine serum albumin,
freeze dried, five level set of QC material, with each level containing one analyte:
Procalcitonin. It is used to confirm the proper calibration, linear operating range, and
reportable range of Procalcitonin. Level A has concentration near the lower limit
level and Level E has concentrations near the upper limit level of instruments. Levels
B – D are related by linear dilution of Level A and Level E.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Value Assignment was based on measurement of Procalcitonin 8 times (8
separate vials) and the mean value of Procalcitonin was used to establish
target concentration values at each level. The target ranges were calculated as
± 20% of the target value. The mean concentration values of each level were
plotted (concentration value vs. assigned level) and a linear regression values
were obtained. If the five-point linear regression R2 value is greater than 0.95
and if the plots are linear, then the product demonstrates linearity.
Representative data from the Procalcitonin Linearity set is shown below for
five lots:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: Values assigned to the AuditTM Micro CVTM Procalcitonin
Linearity Set can be traced to bioMerieux VIDAS Procalcitonin Reagent –
30450-01, Procalcitonin Calibrator – 30450-01, and Procalcitonin Control–
30450-01
The base matrix for building the low and high pools is bovine serum albumin.
For the low pool (Level A), Procalcitonin is adjusted to be within 5% to 10%
of the lowest limit of measurability for the Procalcitonin assay. For the high
pool (Level E), Procalcitonin is adjusted to be within 5% to 10% of the
highest limit of measurability for the Procalcitonin assay.
An accelerated “Heat Stress Stability Prediction” stability study was
conducted to predict shelf life. Four vials of each level were stressed at 37º C
for 10 days to predict one-year stability when stored at 2 – 8º C.
Two pilot lots, Pilot 1, Lot 091011-091015 and Pilot 2, Lot 81164-81168,
were produced and tested. For both pilots, Procalcitonin in the stress stability
study results were within ± 15% of the Day Zero value. This gives the
Procalcitonin Linearity Control one-year shelf life stability.
Accelerated stability studies are supported by an on-going real-time stability
studies.
Open vial stability was also performed to determine the viability of the
product during the course of normal use. Four vials of each level (A through
E) were opened and reconstituted with deionized water. Vials were then
closed, stored for 5 days at 2-8 º C and tested following the same manner as
the above stated destructive testing. The percent loss determined in
comparison to Day Zero values was < 15% and the product is considered
stable.
