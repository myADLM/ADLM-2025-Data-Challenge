I. Device Description:
The MammaPrint® test is performed and provided as a service by Agendia’s two central
Laboratories. The test is a microarray based gene expression analysis of RNA extracted from
breast tumor tissue. The test is a custom-designed array chip manufactured by Agilent
Technologies using the Agilent oligonucleotide microarray platform which assesses the
mRNA expression of the 70 genes printed in nine-fold.
The analysis is based on several processes: isolation of RNA from fresh tumor tissue
sections, DNAse treatment of isolated RNA, linear amplification and labeling of DNAse
treated RNA, cRNA purification, hybridization of the cRNA to the MammaPrint®
microarray, scanning the MammaPrint® microarray and data acquisition (feature extraction),
calculation and determination of the risk of recurrence in breast cancer patients.
The MammaPrint® analysis is designed to determine the gene activity of specific genes in a
tissue sample compared to a reference standard. The result is an expression profile, or
fingerprint, of the sample. The correlation of the sample expression profile to a template (the
mean expression profile of 44 tumors with a known good clinical outcome) is calculated and
the molecular profile of the sample is determined (Low Risk, High Risk, Low Risk
Borderline, High Risk Borderline).

i. Comparison of new scanners to previously cleared scanners
This study used a total of 100 samples (included samples with either high, low
or borderline results). For each sample, 2 hybridizations are performed:
straight and dye swap.
1st scan was generated on all slides using previously FDA cleared scanners
(serial US45103019 and US22502555).
2nd scan was generated using new scanners (US810R3210 and US811R3213).
Additionally, control samples LRC and HRC were included.
MammaPrint indices were compared between both scans using Passing and
Bablok regression analysis and a comparison of the variance per scanner.
Results of the Passing and Bablok regression analysis are summarized in
Tables 1 and 2 below. The 95% confidence interval of the slope contains the
value 1 and of the intercept B contains the value 0, indicating the new and the
FDA cleared scanners are equivalent.

Results showed the difference between the mean, median and standard
deviation for all samples levels between both scanners were within the
accepted variance of the predicate device of 1.96*0.030.
McNemars test on MammaPrint Outcome
In the 2x2 contingency tables, the outcome comparison is shown for the FDA
cleared scanner and the new scanner (Table 3 and Table 4). The McNemars
test shows that there is no difference in the marginal row and column
frequencies (p=1.0).

The Kappa Score indicates high agreement in MammaPrint Outcome between
both scanners (κ=0.974, 95%CI: 0.922 – 1.025).
Investigation of MammaPrint Outcome switchers
Between the FDA cleared (US22502555) and New scanner (US810R3210)
There is one sample out of the 103 that has switched in MammaPrint outcome
(0.97%); from low risk in the FDA cleared scanner dataset to high risk in the
new scanner dataset (table 4).
The sample with switching outcome has a MammaPrint Index in the
borderline region (0.380-0.450) and is very close to the MammaPrint
threshold (0.415) with both scanners (Table 5).

Samples that lie within the borderline region and that are close to the
threshold are more likely to switch in outcome. In a diagnostic setting these
samples will be performed in duplicate in order to obtain better outcome
accuracy.

Between the FDA cleared (US45103019) and New scanner (US811R3213)
As shown in the 2x2 contingency table, there are two samples switching in
MammaPrint Outcome between both scanners. These samples switched from
a low risk with the FDA cleared scanner to a high risk using the New scanner.
Table 6: MammaPrint results on switching samples between FDA cleared
scanner (US45103019) and New scanner (US811R3213)

09005722I1A1L1 0.418 low risk 0.415 high risk
However, the samples that switched in Outcome are well within the borderline
region (0.380 – 0.450). The MammaPrint result of the New scanner lies
exactly on the MammaPrint threshold (0.415).
Since these samples are within the borderline region and extremely close to
the threshold it is very likely to switch in MammaPrint Outcome. In a
diagnostic setting these samples will be performed in duplicate in order to
obtain better outcome accuracy.
PPA = 1 95% CI = (0.939 – 1)
NPA = 0.923 95% CI = (0.734 – 0.987)
MammaPrint Stability over time
Both control samples LRC2 and HRC2 were also tested to show MammaPrint
Stability overtime on the New scanner and FDA cleared scanner. For each
control samples 20 measurements were generated. The mean and standard
deviation were determined for LRC2 and HRC2 for both scanners (Tables 7
and 8).

The standard deviation of MammaPrint Index determined for the New scanner
is comparable to the FDA cleared scanner. This indicates that MammaPrint
Stability generated with the New scanner is comparable to the FDA cleared
scanner.
ii. Comparison of new bioanalyzers to previously cleared bioanalyzers
A selection of about 60 samples that cover the complete RNA Integrity
Number (RIN) measuring range was analyzed on previously FDA cleared
Bio-analyzer (Serial nr DE54700497), as well as the new Bio-analyzer
(DE72902383). A selection of 59 samples that cover the complete RIN
measuring range was analyzed on the FDA cleared Bio-analyzer
(ID035/Serial nr. DE24802382) as well as the new Bio-analyzer (ID
132/Serial nr. DE72901757). Depending on the distribution of the data a
statistical test was performed to determine if there is a significant difference in
RIN measurements between both Bio-analyzers.
The RIN measurements of the samples on both Bio-Analyzers were collected
and the D’Agostino-Pearson test on the RIN differences of both analyzers
showed a normal distribution (p<0.0001). A Wilcoxon signed ranks test was
used which showed that there was no significant difference in RIN
measurements between the FDA cleared and New Bio-analyzers (p=0.46 for
Serial nr. DE72901757 and p=0.47 for DE72902383, respectively).
iii. Comparison of two central laboratories
Validation of MammaPrint at the European (Amsterdam) and U.S.
(Huntington Beach, HB) central laboratories was performed in two parts.

PART 1: RNA ISOLATION
Samples were selected based on sufficient tissue material available for
sectioning and isolation at the US laboratory (Lab 2). These samples have
previously shown to generate acceptable quality of RNA at the Amsterdam
laboratory (Lab 1). After isolation the concentration and RNA quality (RIN)
was assessed using the Bio-analyzers; all values have to meet the standard
quality controls for MammaPrint (RIN>7).
Isolations were performed on three different days, twelve samples each day, in
total 36 samples.

Lab2.
PART 2: AMPLIFICATION/LABELING AND HYBRIDIZATION
For validation of the labeling, amplification and hybridization steps of
MammaPrint at the US lab (Lab 2), RNA from 99 samples was used. All
samples have been previously subjected to a diagnostic MammaPrint test at
the Amsterdam Lab (Lab 1). Based on the Amsterdam result the following
result distribution was selected:
7

--- Page 8 ---
- High risk: n=54 (54.5%)
- Low risk: n=38 (38.3%)
- Borderline: n=7 (7.1%)
RNA was amplified, labeled and hybridized according to standard
MammaPrint protocols on FDA cleared MammaPrint Low (HD) 8-pack array.
Along with 99 samples, the standard control samples (Low Risk Control and
High Risk Control) were also analyzed. To show MammaPrint stability over
time and to determine variation in MammaPrint Index, LRC and HRC were
analyzed on each labeling day and on additional days resulting in 20 data
points per control sample.
Statistical analyses that have been performed on the data are;
• Passing and Bablok regression analysis
• Bland & Altman analysis
• McNEMARS TEST
• Analysis on Control Pools: LRC AND HRC

that there is a high similarity in MammaPrint Indices generated at Amsterdam
Lab and HB lab.

One sample with “High Risk Borderline” index in Amsterdam Lab had “Low
Risk” index in on HB lab; and one sample with “Low Risk” in Amsterdam lab
had “High Risk” index in HB lab.
After investigation, there are no indications that these switchers are related to
hybridization quality or result of location. All results passed the QC model.
Important note; in regular MammaPrint diagnostics, borderline region samples
are performed in duplicate in order to increase accuracy. This was not
performed in this validation.
The standard deviation of both control samples LRC and HRC were
determined for the HB lab (Lab 2) and compared to the standard deviation at
the Amsterdam Lab (Lab 1). The accepted difference between both standard
deviations is 0.059 (1.96*0.03).
The studies show that there is no significant difference in RNA quality of RIN
measurement between Amsterdam (L1) and US lab (L2). Moreover when
comparing MammaPrint Index and Outcome, it is concluded that there is no
significant difference in MammaPrint Indices between European Dutch (L1)
and US California (L2) lab. All results were within the predefined validation
acceptance criteria.
