Traceability:
For each analyte an anchor pool is prepared using a WHO standard material.
The LOCI 8 Anchor Pool for each analyte is manufactured by spiking four
levels of WHO standard, which span the assay range, into normal human
serum previously screened for low levels of the analyte of interest. The zero
calibrator for the anchor pool is bovine serum albumin calibrator base. A four
level masterpool is prepared with bovine serum albumin and assigned values
on the Dimension Vista® instrument system versus the anchor pool. The
masterpools are stored at -70C and are used to assign commercial calibrator
lots. The commercially available values for each analyte are as follows:

Stability:
Shelf Life - Stability studies independent of associated reagents were
performed for a period of at least 12 months. LOCI 8 Calibrator was stored at
-20° C throughout the testing cycle. The studies support the sponsor’s
claimed stability of 12 months when stored at -20ºC.
Open Vial - Vials are thawed and opened on day zero. A quantity sufficient
for a single calibration is withdrawn and the vials are re-capped and stored at
2 - 8°C. The material in these vials is tested on Day 8 versus freshly thawed
material. The studies support the sponsor’s claimed stability of 7 days when
opened and then stored at 2 to 8ºC.
Punctured Vial - Vials are thawed on day zero and the appropriate amount of
material is withdrawn leaving sufficient volume for one calibration and the
dead volume. All punctured vials are stored at 2 - 8° C with 75% humidity.
Two unopened vials and four punctured vials are tested on day 0; four
unopened and eight punctured vials are tested on day 8. The recovery of each
individual punctured vial is compared to the mean value for the un-opened
vials. The studies support the sponsor’s claimed stability of 7 days when the
vials are punctured and then stored on board the Dimension Vista® System.
Stress Testing - Stress testing is performed by exposing vials of the product to
three elevated temperature profiles during the first week. Stressed samples are
tested at several time points and results compared with those from the product
that experienced only normal storage.
Acceptance Criteria - The acceptance criterion for each method is expressed
in terms of a drift in recovery versus time. Each analyte must meet the pre-
determined acceptance criteria for storage conditions recommended by the
manufacturer.
