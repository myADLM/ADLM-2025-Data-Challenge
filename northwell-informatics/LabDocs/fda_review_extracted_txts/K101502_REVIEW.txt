The BD RST HG is a single use tube used to collect, separate, transport and process
venous blood specimens to obtain serum for chemistry determinations for in vitro
diagnostic use. It is used in settings where a venous blood sample is collected by a trained
healthcare worker.
Clot time has not been established for patients on heparin therapy, direct thrombin
inhibitor therapy or with Factor I deficiency. As a result, the use of BD RST HG in these
patients is not recommended.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription use only.
BD RST HG Tubes are not recommended for amino acid determinations.
Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), blood banking and infectious disease performance
has not been established, except for anti-CMV IgG and anti-CMV IgM.
Clot time has not been established for patients on heparin therapy, direct thrombin
inhibitor therapy or with Factor I deficiency. As a result, the use of BD RST HG in these
patients is not recommended.
The flow properties of the barrier material are temperature-related. Centrifuge the tubes
between 23oC and 27oC (73-81oF).
Tubes should not be re-centrifuged once barrier has formed.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Specific analyzers used to evaluate the device are listed in the labeling and below in
section M. 2. a. method comparison.
I. Device Description:
The BD Vacutainer® Rapid Serum Tube Blood Collection Tube with Hemogard™ Closure
(BD RST HG) is a sterile, single use, 13 x 100 mm, 5.0mL plastic evacuated tube with a
plastic shield and rubber stopper safety closure. The BD RST HG contains a thrombin clot
activator, tube wall coating, and inert barrier gel. The BD RST HG is intended to be placed
inside a tube holder or an adaptor that contains a needle designed to pierce the tube closure
and allow blood to flow into the tube. Once the vein has been penetrated (using either a
standard blood collection needle or a blood collection set) the tube is pushed into the holder,
2

and the blood enters the tube. The Hemogard™ safety closure prevents exposure of
healthcare workers to blood components in the tube.

L. Test Principle:
The BD Vacutainer® Rapid Serum Tube HG is intended to be placed inside either a holder or
an adapter of a blood collection system. Once the vein of the patient has been penetrated
using a standard needle, the tube is pushed fully into the needle holder so that the non-
patient’s end of the needle pierces the rubber septum of the stopper of the tube. The tube uses
a controlled vacuum to pull a specific volume of blood into the sterile interior of the tube.
The pressure differential caused the venous blood to flow into the tube. Once pressure is
equalized, the blood flow ceases and the tube is withdrawn from the needle holder or needle.
After blood has been drawn, the tube shall be immediately inverted gently for 5 to 6 times to
mix the blood with the additives, and then allowed to clot and stand for 5 minutes. Once
clotting is complete, the tube is to be centrifuged for 10 minutes, at a minimum g force of
1500g to initiate movement of gel and to obtain separation of serum.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision/repeatability studies were performed using 45 apparently healthy subjects in an
internal testing site. Each subject has a venous blood collected into six blood collection
tubes: 3 BD SST tubes (predicate device) with 3 different lot numbers and 3 BD RST
HG tubes (candidate device) with 3 different lot numbers. Each tube was tested in
duplicates for each of the 12 analytes and on 2 different instrument platforms except IgG,

which was tested on a single instrument. Samples were excluded if: 1) serum with greater
than trace hemolysis, or 2) incomplete gel barrier/incomplete separation of serum from
clot, or 3) tubes not filled to approximate stated draw volume (i.e., no “short draw”).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Real Time stability testing of the BD RST HG tubes showed that the tube is stable for 12
months when stored at 4o to 25oC.
To demonstrate analyte stability in the BD RST HG tubes at room temperature, analyte
stability studies were performed at 0 hrs and 24 hrs after collecting blood into the BD
RST HG and the predicate SST tubes. Studies are summarized below:
1) Internal Study: 47 apparently healthy adults were enrolled and tested at the
manufacturing facility.
28 analytes (ALB, ALP, ALT, AST, Amy, BUN, Ca, Chol, Cl, CO2, Creat, DBIL,
Fe, GGT, Gluc, HDL, K, LDH, LDL, Lip, Mg, Na, Phos, TBIL, TP, Transferrin,
TRIG, UA) were tested on a Roche Cobas Integra 800 analyzer.
12 analytes (Cortisol, Ferritin, Folate, FSH, Free T3, Free T4, LH, TSH,
Testosterone, Total T3, Total T4, and Vitamin B12) were tested on a Bayer ADVIA
Centaur analyzer.
2) External Studies: Consecutive adult patients from multiple inpatient settings with a
range of conditions and diagnoses were enrolled and tested respectively in Hospital
Site 1, 2, and 3.
Hospital Site 1:
5 analytes (C3, C4, IgG, IgM, and RF) were tested on a Beckman Coulter UniCel
DxC 800 analyzer. Subjects with numerical value for both tubes at both time points
(C3, C4 and IgG, N=70; IgM, N=66; RF, N=26) were used in the bias analysis.
2 analytes (Anti-CMV IgG and Anti-CMV IgM) were tested on a Biomerieux
VIDAS analyzer. Stability was evaluated by concordance of results on 50 subjects.
Hospital Site 2:
3 analytes (hCG, Estradiol and Progesterone) were tested on a Siemens ADVIA
Centaur® XP analyzer. Subjects with numerical value for both tubes at both time
points (E2, <100 pg/mL, N=24; E2, ≥100 pg/mL, N=25; hCG, ≥5 mIU/mL, N=49;
Prog, <10ng/mL, N=30; and Prog, ≥10ng/mL, N=31) were used in the bias analysis.
Additional concordance table was provided for hCG.

--- Page 9 ---
Hospital Site 3:
2 analytes (CK, CRP) were tested on a Roche Modular analyzer. 3 analytes (CKMB,
Myo, and TnI) were tested on a Beckman Coulter Access® analyzer.
Subjects with numerical value for both tubes at both time points (CK, N=46; CRP,
N=43; CKMB, N=50; Myo, N=50; and TnI, <0.04 ng/mL, N=41; >0.04 ng/mL, N=7;
<0.06 ng/mL, N=44; >0.06 ng/mL, N=6; <0.5 ng/mL, N=51) were used in the bias
analysis. Additional concordance table was provided on TnI at 0.5 ng/mL cutoff.
3) Supplemental Studies:
40 healthy adult patients were tested internally for LDL and Triglycerides for
additional time-points stability study. Testing was performed on a Roche Cobas
Integra 800 analyzer at 0, 6, 12 and 24 hours after blood have been collected and
separated from the centrifuge.
30 healthy adult patients were tested internally for Progesterone for additional time-
points stability study. Testing was performed on a Siemens ADVIA Centaur analyzer
at 0, 6, 12 and 24 hours after blood have been collected and separated from the
centrifuge.
Summary: The results of the studies support the sponsor’s claim that the BD RST HG
tubes have analyte stability for 24 hours at room temperature except for LDL (12 hours),
triglycerides (12 hours) and Progesterone (6 hours). This information is provided in the
sponsor’s package insert.

Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Not applicable.
f. Assay cut-off:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To demonstrate comparable performance with the predicate device, apparently healthy
subjects and patients admitted into hospitals with various diseases were enrolled.
Enrollment included inpatient populations from selected clinical settings where it was

expected that the test results for one or more of the analytes to be tested will be outside
the normal reference range. Testing was performed at the manufacturing facility and at 4
different clinical sites. All subjects in the comparative studies have blood samples
collected into the BD RST HD (candidate device) and the BD SST (predicate tubes) at
the same time. The specimens were allowed to clot, and the serum was removed for
testing immediately after centrifugation according to the instructions provided in the
labeling. Evaluations were performed on a selected panel of common chemistry analytes,
immunology analytes, and serological analytes on several instrument platforms. A total
of 55 analytes were evaluated and demonstrated comparable results between the BD RST
HG tubes and the BD SST tubes. A small number of spiked samples were used to
supplement the analyte ranges. A list of the analytes and instrument platforms tested are
summarized in Table 7. Deming regressions correlations with 95% confidence intervals
were taken from one representative platform/study.

Testing for 28 routine chemistry analytes was preformed on a Roche Cobas Integra
800 instrument.
Testing for 12 immunoassay analytes was performed on a Siemens ADVIA Centaur
instrument.
2) External Studies: Consecutive adult patients from multiple inpatient settings with a
range of conditions and diagnoses were enrolled and tested respectively in Hospital
Site 1, 2, 3 and 4.
Hospital Site 1:
Samples from 78 subjects were tested for 19 routine chemistry analytes on a Roche
Modular instrument. Samples from an additional 24 subjects from other hospital sites
were tested for one or more of the 19 analytes to cover a wide range for the analytes
of interest.
Hospital Site 2:
A panel of 21 analytes was tested, including 16 chemistry analytes on a Beckman
Coulter UniCel DxC 800 instrument, TSH, TT3, and TT4 on a Beckman Coulter
Access 2 instrument, and anti-CMV IgG, anti-CMV-IgM on a Biomerieux Vidas
instrument. Among the 101 subjects enrolled, samples from 80 subjects were tested
for all analytes, samples from 21 subjects were tested on selected analytes only.
Samples from an additional 30 subjects from other hospital sites were tested for one
or more of the 21 analytes to cover a wide range for the analytes of interest.
Hospital Site 3:
A panel of 22 analytes was tested, including 10 chemistry analytes on a Ortho-
Diagnostics Vitros analyzer or a Roche Modular, 12 special chemistry analytes on a
Beckman Coulter UniCel® DxI 800 and Siemens ADVIA Centaur® XP analyzer.
Among the 71 subjects enrolled, samples from 43 subjects were tested for all
analytes. Samples from 28 subjects were tested on a subset of the analytes. Samples
from an additional 81 subjects from other hospital sites were tested for one or more of
the 22 analytes to cover a wide range for the analytes of interest.
Hospital Site 4:
A panel of 26 analytes was tested, including 21 analytes on Siemens Dimension®
RxL, 2 analytes on Roche Modular, and 3 analytes on Beckman Coulter Access®.
Among the 87 subjects enrolled, samples from 77 subjects were tested for all
analytes. Samples from 10 subjects were tested on a subset of the analytes. Samples
from an additional 31 subjects from other hospital sites were tested for one or more of
the 26 analytes to cover a wide range for the analytes of interest.
