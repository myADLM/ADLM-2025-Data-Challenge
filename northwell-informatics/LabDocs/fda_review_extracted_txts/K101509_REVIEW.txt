L. Test Principle:
The U-Right TD-4279 and FORA GD 40 glucose meters, in conjunction with the
same test trips (U-Right TD-4279 or FORA GD-40), utilize amperometric technology
to quantitatively measure the glucose concentration in whole blood samples and in
control solutions. A glucose dehydrogenase sensor based on the carbon electrode
adopting the amperometric assay utilizes the enzyme glucose dehydrogenase to
catalyze the formation of gluconolactone from the oxidation of glucose whereby two
electrons are produced. Through the mechanism of the mediator, electrical current is
generated and it is proportional to the quantity of glucose in the sample.
The reaction principle of reagent depends on following reaction equation:
GDH, FAD
Glucose + 2 ferricyanide = gluconolactone + 2 ferrocyanide
electrode
ferrocyanide = ferricyanide + e-
GDH: glucose dehydrogenase
FAD: flavin adenine dinucleotide

The sponsor performed precision studies in accordance with the ISO 15197
and CLSI EP-5A. Since the U-Right TD-4279A and U-Right TD-4279B are
identical devices as well as FORA GD40 A and FORA GD40 B, which differ
only in data transmission function (A - USB model; B - Bluetooth model), the
precision studies were performed to evaluate precision of the glucose meters
with more complex data transmission function, the U-Right TD-4279B and
FORA GD40 B models. The within-run precision study was performed using
venous whole blood samples, with hematocrit ranging from 38% to 54%, and
dextrose spiked to create 7 levels of blood glucose. Three lots of test strips
and 10 meters were used in the study, with 10 tests performed on each meter
for a total of 300 tests per blood glucose level. Results for each test strip lot
are summarized in the tables below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor performed linearity studies using adjusted whole blood samples
with 11 different glucose concentrations covering the measuring range
entirely and using both devices, U-Right TD-4279 (B model) and FORA
GD40 (B model) and the YSI-2300 glucose analyzer (reference method). Three
lots of test strips were used in the study with 20 tests per lot performed on each
meter. Linear regression analysis for each test strip lot is summarized below:
U-Right TD-4279:
Lot 1 y = 0.9833x + 6.2548, r2 = 0.9974
Lot 2 y = 0.9734x + 7.5126, r2 = 0.9981
Lot 3 Y = 0.9707x + 8.0857, r2 = 0.9952
FORA GD40:
Lot 1 y = 1.0339x - 0.5722, r2 = 0.9944
Lot 2 y = 1.0109x + 2.1511, r2 = 0.9952
Lot 3 Y = 1.0089 + 5.2186, r2 = 0.9879
The measuring range of the U-Right TD-4279 and FORA GD40 is 20 - 600
mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The method comparison was performed using the proposed devices and YSI
2300 glucose analyzer.
Controls: Control solutions were cleared in k093724. The control ranges are
listed on the test strip vial labels.
The storage claims for these devices are: 90 days for open vial of strips stored
at 35.6 – 89.6 oF (2 – 32 °C) and 18 months for unopened vials of strips stored
at the same temperature. The study protocol, data and acceptance criteria were
provided and found to be adequate.
Temperature and humidity studies: Temperature and humidity studies were
conducted on each type of meter (U-Right TD-4279 and FORA GD40) with
venous blood samples spanning the measuring range and demonstrating that
these devices can be used at temperatures of 4 to 40°C and at a relative
humidity up to 85%. The study protocol, data and individual bias of ± 10%
across the entire measuring range were provided and found to be adequate.
Open-vial-in-use test strip studies were performed at the combined extremes
of 10±2°C (46.4-56.3°F) RH: 30 %, 10±2°C RH:85%, 40±2°C (100.4-
107.6°F) RH:30 %, and 40±2°C RH:85% with venous blood samples with
concentrations across the measuring range and compared to the YSI. The
study protocol, data and individual bias of ±10% across the entire measuring
range were provided and found to be adequate.
12

--- Page 13 ---
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the devices is 20-600 mg/dL. This range was
validated via the linearity study (see section M.1.b.).
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed interference studies with spiked venous blood samples
at two glucose concentrations (100 and 300 mg/dL) that were prepared and
divided into a test (dosed) pool and a control pool. The interferents were
added to the sample and each sample was analyzed in duplicate using 4 U -
Right TD-4279 and FORA GD40 glucose meters. The table below lists all

Hematocrit Study:
A study to evaluate the effect of hematocrit was conducted on samples with 8
glucose concentrations at 11 hematocrit levels (20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55,
60, 65 and 70%). Each glucose level/hematocrit combination was tested in
duplicate of 6 of each type of meter (U-Right TD-4279 and FORA GD40)
using one lot of test strips. Results of samples at each hematocrit level were
compared to samples with the same glucose concentration at normal (40%)
hematocrit as well as to the corresponding YSI value. All individual results
for each meter type were +/- 15% of the YSI, supporting the claimed
hematocrit range of 20-70%.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor conducted a combined accuracy and consumer study. Testing
was performed at 3 sites, with trained operators and a total of 146 lay-users.
Each lay user participant performed their own fingerstick and tested their
blood on the U-Right TD-4279 and FORA GD40 (TD-4272) meters using
only the instructions in the user’s manual and test strip insert. A trained
operator then performed a second fingerstick and tested the blood on the same
meter. Venous blood was also collected and measured on an YSI analyzer.
The total range of samples tested was 32-539 mg/dL for the U-Right TD-4279
meter and 32 to 512 mg/dL for the FORA GD40 (TD-4272) glucose meter.
Samples <40 mg/dL and >400 mg/dL were glycolyzed or spiked, respectively,
and tested by trained operators as well as lay users. Linear regression results
are presented below:
U-Right TD-4279:
Professional vs YSI y = 1.0452x + 2.2323, r2 = 0.9954
Lay user vs. YSI y = 1.0701x - 2.0936, r2 = 0.9951
FORA GD40 (TD-4272):
Professional vs YSI y = 1.0644x – 3.4426, r2 = 0.9574
Lay user vs. YSI y = 1.0819x - 7.6905, r2 = 0.9680
The study results met the ISO 15197 accuracy criteria where ninety-five
percent (95%) of the individual glucose results fell within ±15mg/dL of the
YSI results at glucose concentrations <75mg/dL and within ±20% at glucose
concentrations ≥75mg/dL.

b. Matrix comparison:
Venous blood samples:
Testing was done comparing venous blood samples previously collected in
commercially available sodium-heparin tubes and then evaluated with the U-
Right TD-4279 and FORA GD40 against YSI-2300. 100 subjects were tested
by professionals. Samples from 25 to 560 mg/dL for the U-Right TD-4279
BGM and 22 to 584 mg/dL for the FORA GD40 were included in this
analysis. Each fresh capillary whole blood sample used was from a different
individual except for samples with blood glucose concentrations less than 40
mg/dL and greater than 400 mg/dL. For those specimens, a pooled capillary
whole blood specimen was either glycolyzed or spiked to the desired level.

5. Calibration:
These systems need to be calibrated every time users open a new vial of test
strips. Calibration of the test strip is done by inserting the code strip into the
meters when opening a new vial of test strips
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor has three levels of controls that may not be provided with the meters,
but can be purchased separately. When a test strip is inserted into the meter, each
control can be measured by following the instructions for “Performing a Control
Solution Test” provided in the User’s Manuals for the meters. An acceptable
range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. If the test results
fall outside the range printed on the test strip vial, the user is instructed to contact
the Customer Care Line at 1-866-469-2632 for customer support. The Customer
Care service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. These devices are intended for single-patient use (U- RIGHT TD-
4279A/B and FORA GD 40a/b/TD-4247A/B) and multiple patient use/healthcare
professional use (U- RIGHT TD-4279A/B MULTI and FORA Wisdom GD
40a/b/TD-4247A/B ) . Cleaning and disinfection are different processes. Cleaning
is the process of removing dirt (e.g. food debris, grease, dust), disinfection is the
process of killing germs (e.g. bacteria and viruses). Disinfection studies (viral
efficacy studies) were performed by an outside service to evaluate the virus
elimination effectiveness of disinfecting wipes in preventing the spread of
bloodborne pathogens, particularly hepatitis B virus (HBV). Specifically, Micro-
Kill+ cleaner disinfectant towels (with EPA registration # 59894-10-37549)
were validated demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus. The sponsor
does not market a lancing device for use with the device. The sponsor also
performed robustness studies using all 4 glucose meters claimed in this 510(k)
application (U- RIGHT TD-4279A, U- RIGHT TD-4279B, FORA GD 40a/TD-
4247A and FORA GD 40b/TD-4247B) and demonstrated that there was no
change in performance or in the external materials of the meters after 10,000
cleaning and disinfection cycles designed to simulate 5 years (5 cleaning and
disinfection cycles per day) of single patient device use or 3 years (9 cleaning and
disinfection cycles per day) of healthcare professional use. The tested number of
cycles is estimated by 5 cleaning and disinfection cycles per day over 5 years, the
expected life of the single patient device or 9 cycles per day for the multiple
patient use in professional settings. In addition, the sponsor provided a risk
analysis specific to the potential harm due to infection. Labeling has been
reviewed for adequate instructions in validated cleaning and disinfection
procedures.
2. Lay-User Study for USB and Bluetooth mediated Data Transmission:
This study was performed using 50 study participants, following instructions in
19

--- Page 20 ---
User’s manual, who were able to transmit results from the meter to the PC
application (cleared under k070941) via either the USB (25 study subjects) or
Bluetooth (25 study subjects)features. The study participants also completed a
questionnaire in response to whether the data transmission feature is easy to use.
The sponsor concluded that the users’ responses indicated that data transmission
function was easy to operate by following the User’s manuals for both the USB
and the Bluetooth mediated data transmission.
3. Altitude study: An altitude study was performed in an altitude simulation
chamber with whole blood samples spanning the range of ~20 to 600 mg/dL for
both, U-Right TD-4279 and FORA GD40 glucose meters. The study protocol,
data and bias ±10% across the entire measuring range were provided and found to
be adequate. Altitude up to 10,742 feet (3,275m) does not affect test results of the
U-RIGHT TD-4279 and FORA GD40 glucose meters.
4. Specimen volume study: A study was performed to evaluate the effect of
different sample volumes (0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 2.0 and 2.5μl) on the
performance of these devices. It was determined that the 1.1 μl volume of sample
provides accurate reading for both, U-RIGHT TD-4279 and FORA GD40 glucose
meters. The results from this study for the sample volume of 1.1 μl were within
±10% individual bias across the entire measuring range when U-RIGHT TD-4279
and FORA GD40 measurements were compared to the YSI-2300.
5. The sponsor provided a readability study and obtained Flesch-Kincaid
grade level scores of 8 or lower for the User’s Manual and test strip insert.
6. Lay user questionnaire: 146 lay users evaluated the ease of use of the
device and the presentation of the labeling. All users thought that the U-Right
TD-4279 and FORA GD40 Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems were easy to use
and most answer “easy” and “very easy” that the user manuals were written
to make it easy to use.
7. Additional electromagnetic interference study was performed to verify
these new products. The results of this study complied with standards listed in the
Standard/Guidance Document Referenced section above. Electromagnetic
Compatibility (EMC): EMC testing for u-Right TD-4279 and FORA GD40 was
performed/passed and a certificate to TaiDoc was provided.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
