L. Test Principle:
Thromboelastometry is based on the measurement of elasticity of blood by continuous
graphic logging of the firmness of a blood clot during clot formation (coagulation factors
and inhibitors, platelets and fibrin) and subsequent fibrinolysis.
The EXTEM assay is similar to the laboratory prothrombin time (PT) test. Calcium
chloride (CaCl ) and EXTEM® reagent are pipetted into the assay cup and then citrated
2
whole blood is added and mixed. The cup is then inserted into the measurement position
of the ROTEM® delta analyzer and the reaction is recorded. The initiation phase (clotting
time = CT) is the time from test start until the formation of first significant detectable
fibrin is reached. The clot formation phase (CFT) is the time from the CT until a clot
firmness of 20 mm is reached. The A10 and A20, is the clot firmness at 10 and 20
minutes after CT. Maximum clot firmness (MCF) measures the maximum amplitude of
the developed clot, and the alpha angle is the angle between the baseline and a tangent to
the clotting curve through the 2 mm point.
The FIBTEM assay measures the fibrin contribution to clot firmness. Equal amounts of
EXTEM® and FIBTEM® reagents are pipetted into the instrument sample cup, and then
patient sample is added and mixed with the reagents. The cup is then inserted into the
measurement position of the ROTEM® delta analyzer and the reaction recorded. The
initiation phase (clotting time = CT) gives information on the extrinsic clotting factor
concentration. The A20, MCF parameters gives information on the overall colt firmness
without platelet activity.
The APTEM assay provides information (clotting time, speed of clot formation, and clot
firmness) without fibrinolysis effects. Evidence of fibrinolytic activity is obtained by
comparing the results of the EXTEM and APTEM test. In the APTEM assay, activation is
initiated by the EXTEM® reagent via the extrinsic system in conjunction with the
plasmin-antagonist Aprotinin, which prevents fibrinolysis. Fibrinolytic processes are
detected by a loss of the clot firmness during the clot formation analysis with the
ROTEM® delta in the EXTEM assay.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Total, within-run (channel-to-channel) and operator-to-operator precision were
evaluated. The sample pool consisted of the following sample types:
• Normal blood samples in the manufacturer established reference ranges
• Level 1 blood samples at the medical decision limit between normal and
hypocoagulable: normal blood samples diluted with physiologic saline solution
and spiked with a direct thrombin inhibitor
• Level 2 blood samples outside the reference ranges (at the medical decision
limit between normal and hypercoagulable): normal sample spiked with
fibrinogen (up to approximately 8 g/L)
• ROTROL N (level 1 - mimicking ‘normal’)
5

--- Page 6 ---
• ROTROL P (level 2 - mimicking ‘pathological’)
Citrated whole blood samples were obtained from a blood donor center, and from
these normal blood samples, the level 1 and level 2 blood samples were generated
by diluting or spiking.
Within-run precision was assessed by performing five consecutive runs of each
sample/control. Each run was performed using four different channels of one
ROTEM® instrument in parallel which resulted in 20 replicates per test and
sample.
Because the FIBTEM assay contains a platelet inhibitor, only the fibrin
contribution to clot firmness is measured in the assay. Therefore, only the clot
firmness parameter A20 is relevant for precision testing.
Rotrol N and Control P results were deemed acceptable if the results fell within the
acceptable range for the control. Results from the Normal Donor and Level 1 & 2
Samples were deemed acceptable based on the following:

b. Factor sensitivity to Factor VII (FVII) for the EXTEM assay was demonstrated by
diluting calibration plasma (IL Calibration Plasma k041905, Factor VII level =

Factor VII level = 1%) and testing. Four aliquots of each data point were
prepared, run, and the mean of the four determinations plotted against FVII
concentration. Because the CT-parameter is the most sensitive signal for factor
deficiency, only CT-values of the ex-TEM® reagent were estimated. Results
demonstrated that Factor VII levels <20% significantly prolong the CT.

c. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
d. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Data was submitted to support the 8-hour on-board and 14-day open vial stability
claims for the ex-TEM, fib-TEM, and ap-TEM reagents. To support the 8-hr on
board stability claim, all reagents were opened and stored at 25°C and tested at 1-
hr intervals. ROTROL N was used as the sample material. Results were deemed
acceptable if the ratio from the mean of the first three data points (hrs. 1-3) and the
mean of the last three data points (hrs 6-8) is less than 15% for the CT parameter,
CFT <25%, A20 <5% (fib-TEM <20%), and <5% for the Alpha parameter. For
the 14-day stability study, reagent vials were opened, used, closed, stored at 2-8°C,
and tested on days 3, 7, 10, and 14. ROTROL N was used as the sample material.
All reagents have shown stability up to 14 days without any significant changes.
e. Detection limit:

times the maximum therapeutic dose, and a lower –but still high concentration) of
the antifibrinolytic substances and compared to the non-spiked interferent free
control sample.

Results showed that none of the possible interferents had an influence on the
extrinsic coagulation activation up to at least twice the highest clinical dose.
Interference data for unfractionated heparin, for dilution effect, and for urokinase
on the EXTEM, APTEM, and FIBTEM assays, were provided to demonstrate
thromboelastograph principles: coagulation kinetics, clot firmness, and
hyperfibrinolysis. Testing was conducted by testing five dilution levels of the
interferent in normal blood (n=10) in parallel with the undiluted blood sample.
Heparin was spiked into citrated blood samples from blood donors in the
concentrations 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 U/mL to determine the maximum concentration
which leaves the CT and MCT/A20 unaltered. Four aliquots of each heparin
concentration level was prepared and assayed. The mean and SD for each
concentration was presented. For the 5 and 8 U/mL aliquots, the median CT
results were prolonged in comparison to the heparin free control, and were above
the upper reference range limit. A similar less pronounced effect was seen on the
CFT, Alpha Angle, and A20 parameters.
Sensitivity to dilution effect was presented to demonstrate clot firmness. Blood
samples depleted of platelets or fibrinogen decreases clot firmness. To simulate
the depletion of platelets and fibrinogen due to plasma expander substitution in a
patient, normal blood was diluted in saline to 90, 80, 70, 60 and 50%. Ten
different blood samples from normal donors were diluted and tested in parallel.
The mean, SD, median, upper and lower quartile, min, and max over the ten
samples was determined for each dilution. The median and upper and lower
quartile was presented graphically (median ± quartile) by dilution. A linear
reduction was seen with each dilution on all EXTEM, APTEM, and FIBTEM
parameters.
Urokinase (UK), a plasmin activator was used to show a relationship between
activation of plasmin and concomitant hyperfibrinolysis and the breakdown of the
clot in EXTEM. UK was spiked into normal citrated blood samples in the
concentrations 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 U/mL and the EXTEM and APTEM assays
were performed. Ten different blood samples from normal donors were diluted
and tested in parallel. The mean, SD, median, upper and lower quartile, min, and
max over the ten samples was determined for each dilution. The median and upper
and lower quartile was presented graphically (median ± quartile) by dilution. Clot
lysis was seen within one hour in the 20, 30, 40 and 50 U/mL concentrations for
the EXTEM assays. UK did not affect any parameter of the APTEM assay,
indicating that the aprotinin in APTEM assay blocks fibrinolysis.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical samples from patients (n=78) with suspected or acute hemostasis
disorders in the peri- or post-operative phase or at the ICU from 3 US sites were
enrolled into the study. The study included patients with normal coagulation,
hypocoagulable and hypercoagulable states in order to obtain results over the
whole range of the individual parameter results. A unique sample identifier, the
reason for the surgery, and a brief qualitative description of the clinical finding at
the time of blood draw were obtained for each patient included in the study. The
samples for the activated tests were analyzed within two hours from blood draw,
the non-activated test (NATEM) was analyzed within one hour.
The EXTEM assay run on the ROTEM® delta was compared to a generic tissue
factor reagent run on the predicate device. The FIBTEM assay run on the
ROTEM® delta was compared to tissue factor reagent plus ReoPro® run on the
predicate. The APTEM assay run on the ROTEM® delta was compared to the
tissue factor reagent with aprotinin run on the predicate.
Due to limited blood volumes taken, not all patients were tested with all assays per
protocol. At one site, 6 patients were tested at multiple time points during surgery.
Data from each site was analyzed by Ordinary Least Squares and Deming
regression and results demonstrated no significant difference between sites.
