H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The CDC Influenza 2009 A(H1N1)pdm Real-Time RT-PCR Panel (CDC rRT-PCR 2009
A(H1N1)pdm Flu Panel) is intended for use in real-time RT-PCR assays on an Applied
Biosystems (ABI) 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument in conjunction with clinical
and epidemiological information:
• For the qualitative detection of influenza virus type A viral RNA from
nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), nasal swabs (NS), nasal aspirates (NA), nasal washes
(NW), dual nasopharyngeal / throat swabs (NPS/TS), broncheoalveolar lavage
(BAL), tracheal aspirate (TA), and bronchial wash (BW), collected from the
respiratory tract of human patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection
and/or from viral culture.
• For differentiation of 2009 H1N1 influenza virus RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs
(NPS), nasal swabs (NS), nasal aspirates (NA), nasal washes (NW) ,dual
nasopharyngeal / throat swabs (NPS/TS), broncheoalveolar lavage (BAL), tracheal
aspirate (TA), and bronchial wash (BW) collected from the respiratory tract of human
patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection and/or from viral culture.
• To provide epidemiologic information for surveillance of the 2009 H1N1 influenza
virus.
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2009-2010
influenza season when 2009 H1N1 influenza virus was the predominant influenza A virus
in circulation. Performance characteristics may vary against other emerging influenza A
viruses.
A negative test result for the broncheoalveolar lavage (BAL), tracheal aspirate (TA), and
bronchial wash (BW) is presumptive and it is recommended these results be confirmed
by viral culture.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the
sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.
If infection with a novel Influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent
Influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture

should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and
culture specimens.
All users, analysts, and any person reporting results from use of this device should be
trained to perform and interpret the results from this procedure by a competent
instructor prior to use. CDC Influenza Division will limit the distribution of this
device to only those users who have successfully completed a training course provided
by CDC instructors or designees.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as intended use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
To be used with the Applied Biosystems ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument

L. Test Principle:
The CDC rRT-PCR 2009 A(H1N1)pdm Flu Panel includes a set of oligonucleotide
primers and dual-labeled hydrolysis (Taqman®) probes for use in real-time RT-PCR
assays on an ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instrument for the in vitro qualitative
detection of viral nucleic acids from human influenza A and 2009 H1N1 influenza in
respiratory specimens. The assay consists of reagents to detect the matrix (M) gene RNA
from influenza A virus, nucleoprotein (NP) gene and hemagglutinin (HA) gene RNA
from 2009 H1N1 influenza virus, and the human RNase P gene RNA from the human
specimen extraction control (HSC). An extraction control (HSC) is added to each batch
of specimens to be extracted to monitor the quality of the extraction procedure, overall
reagent integrity, and presence of PCR-inhibitory substances. A no template control
(NTC) is included on each plate to serve as a negative control. Positive controls for each

target are also provided and are to be included in each assay run. The targeted regions of
viral RNA are transcribed into complimentary DNA (cDNA) and amplified by the
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The fluorescently labeled probes anneal to amplified
DNA fragments and the fluorescent signal intensity is monitored by the ABI 7500 Fast
Dx instrument during each PCR cycle. Amplification of target is recorded as increase of
fluorescence over time in comparison to background signal.
Interpretation of Results
Extraction and Control Results and Interpretation
No Template Control (NTC)
The NTC consists of using nuclease-free water in the rRT-PCR reactions instead of RNA.
The NTC reactions for all primer and probe sets should not exhibit fluorescence growth
curves that cross the threshold line. If any of the NTC reactions exhibit a growth curve
that crosses the cycle threshold, sample contamination may have occurred. Invalidate the
run and repeat the assay with strict adherence to the guidelines.
Influenza 2009 A(H1N1)pdm Positive Control
The positive control consists of an influenza 2009 H1N1 influenza virus and cultured
human cells (A549). Purified RNA from the positive control will yield a positive result
with the following primer and probe sets: InfA, pdm InfA, pdm H1, and RP.
Human Specimen Control (HSC) (Extraction Control)
The HSC control consists of noninfectious cultured human cell (A549) material. The
HSC is used as a RNA extraction procedural control to demonstrate successful recovery
of RNA as well as extraction reagent integrity. Purified RNA from the HSC should yield
a positive result with the RP primer and probe set and negative results with all influenza
specific markers.
Specimen Results and Interpretation
RNase P (RP)
(cid:190) All clinical samples should exhibit fluorescence growth curves in the RP reaction that
cross the threshold line within 38 cycles (< 38 Ct), thus indicating the presence of the
human RNase P gene. Failure to detect RP in any clinical specimens may indicate:
• Improper extraction of nucleic acid from clinical materials resulting in loss of
RNA and/or RNA degradation
• Absence of sufficient human cellular material due to poor collection or loss of
specimen integrity
• Improper assay set up and execution
• Reagent or equipment malfunction
(cid:190) If the RP assay does not produce a positive result for human clinical specimens,
interpret as follows:
• If the InfA, pdm InfA, and pdm H1 are positive, even in the presence of a
negative RP, the influenza result should be considered valid. It is possible, that
some samples may fail to exhibit RP growth curves due to low cell numbers in the
7

--- Page 8 ---
original clinical sample. A negative RP signal does not preclude the presence of
influenza virus RNA in a clinical specimen.
• If all influenza markers AND RP are all negative for the specimen, the assay is
“inconclusive” for the specimen. If residual specimen is available, repeat the
extraction procedure and repeat the test. If all markers remain negative after re-
test, report the results as “inconclusive” and a new specimen should be collected
if possible.
(cid:190) The RP assay may be negative when testing virus culture samples.
Influenza Markers (InfA, pdm InfA, and pdm H1)
(cid:190) When all controls exhibit the expected performance, a specimen is considered
negative if influenza marker growth curves DO NOT cross the threshold line within
38 cycles (< 38 Ct) and RP growth curve does cross the threshold line within 38
cycles (< 38 Ct).
(cid:190) When all controls exhibit the expected performance, a specimen is considered
positive for influenza A if the influenza marker (InfA) growth curve crosses the
threshold line within 38 cycles (<38 Ct) and the pdm InfA, and pdm H1markers DO
NOT cross the threshold line within 38 cycles. RP may be positive or negative as
described above.
(cid:190) When all controls exhibit the expected performance and none of the growth curves
for the influenza markers or the RP marker cross the threshold line within 38 cycles
(<38 Ct), the result is inconclusive. The extracted RNA from the specimen should be
re-tested. If residual RNA is not available, re-extract RNA from residual specimen
and re-test. If the re-tested sample is negative for all markers and all controls exhibit
the expected performance, the result is “Inconclusive.”
(cid:190) When all controls exhibit expected performance and growth curves for InfA, pdm
InfA, and pdm H1 markers cross the threshold line within 38 cycles (<38 Ct), report
the specimen to be “Positive for Influenza 2009 A/H1N1.”

c) Traceability, stability, expected values (controls calibrators or methods)
Before analyzing the samples tested using the CDC Influenza 2009
A(H1N1)pdm Real-Time RT-PCR Panel on the ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-
Time PCR instrument, the ABI instrument must be prepared following the
procedures described in the Package Insert for the CDC Influenza 2009
A(H1N1)pdm Real-Time RT-PCR Panel and the ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-
Time PCR instrument User Manual.
Assay Controls
Quality Control procedures must be followed in conformance with local,
state, and/or federal regulations or accreditation requirements and a
laboratory’s standard quality control procedures. It is recommended that the
user refer to CLSI document C24-A2.
The following control material should be used when testing with the CDC
Influenza 2009 A(H1N1)pdm Real-Time RT-PCR Panel:
• Internal positive control, the human RNase P (RP) primer and probe set
detects human RP and is used with each clinical specimen to indicate
that adequate isolation of nucleic acid resulted from the extraction of the
specimen. A positive RP assay result also ensures that common reagents
and equipment are functioning properly, and demonstrates the absence
of inhibitory substances.
• Influenza 2009 A(H1N1)pdm Positive Control (pdmPC) contains
noninfectious (beta-propiolactone inactivated influenza 2009 H1N1
influenza virus and cultured human cells (A549). The positive control
will yield a positive result with the following primer and probe sets:
InfA, pdm InfA, pdm H1, and RP to ensure the detection of influenza
2009 H1N1 influenza virus.
• A Human Specimen Control (HSC) is a noninfectious cultured human
cell material for use as a RNA extraction procedural control. It is added
to each batch of specimens to be extracted to monitor the successful
recovery of RNA as well as extraction reagent integrity and presence of
PCR-inhibitory substances. It should yield a positive result with the RP
primer and probe set.
• A no template control (NTC) consists of nuclease-free water in the rRT-
PCR reactions instead of RNA. The NTC reactions for all primer and
probe sets should not exhibit fluorescence growth curves that cross the
threshold line. If any of the NTC reactions exhibit a growth curve that
crosses the cycle threshold, sample contamination may have occurred.
Invalidate the run and repeat the assay with stricter adherence to the
12

--- Page 13 ---
guidelines.
d) Detection limit:
Analytical sensitivity was demonstrated for three influenza strains by
determining the limit of detection (LoD) of each primer and probe set in the
CDC rRT-PCR 2009 A(H1N1)pdm Flu Panel. The following strains were
characterized and used for the LoD study:
A/California/07/09, 2009 H1N1 virus, 108.4 EID /mL stock concentration
50
A/New York/18/09, 2009 H1N1 virus, 107.8 EID /mL stock concentration
50
A/Brisbane/59/07, seasonal H1N1 virus, 108.4 EID /mL stock concentration
50
Five-fold serial dilutions of virus isolated from characterized embryonated
chicken egg (ECE)-grown influenza viruses were tested five times (N=5) to
identify an end-point for detection with each influenza primer and probe set.
RNA was extracted from each virus using the Roche MagNA Pure Compact
RNA kit. Once the end point or range was established, the end-point dilution
and one dilution above and below the end point was tested and repeated
twenty times for each virus and primer and probe set. The limit of detection
for each primer and probe set was calculated to indicate the range of lowest
detectable concentration of influenza virus (EID /mL) with a 95.0% or
50
greater positivity. The limit of detection for each primer and probe set was
determined using the results of the higher virus concentration of the two,
type and subtype markers.

e) Analytical specificity:
Inclusivity
To demonstrate the specificity of the primer and probe sets to detect a
diverse population of 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses, ten 2009 H1N1
influenza viruses propagated in either Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK)
cells in culture or in ECE as described previously in this section, were
grown to high titer, and harvested. Each virus was subsequently serially
diluted to approximately 102 ID /mL, near the limit of detection of the
50
assay. The diluted 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses were extracted using Roche
MagNA Pure Compact RNA kit and were tested in triplicate using the CDC
rRT-PCR 2009 A(H1N1)pdm Flu Panel.

Exclusivity with Influenza Viruses with Pandemic Potential
To demonstrate the ability of the influenza A primer and probe sets to detect
influenza A/H5 viruses with pandemic potential, the reactivity of the CDC
rRT-PCR 2009 A(H1N1)pdm Flu Panel was tested with ten avian A/H5
influenza viruses that have been shown to infect humans. The avian A/H5
influenza viruses were grown and harvested from allantoic/amniotic fluid
from infected ECE and titered. Each virus was extracted using the Roche
MagNA Pure Compact RNA Isolation kit, and the purified RNA was tested
in triplicate with each marker following the CDC rRT-PCR 2009
A(H1N1)pdm Flu Panel protocol.

To demonstrate the ability of the influenza A primer and probe sets to detect
potential pandemic influenza A viruses, the reactivity of the CDC rRT-PCR
2009 A(H1N1)pdm Flu Panel was also tested with fifteen non-human
influenza viruses that have been shown to infect humans. The non-human
influenza viruses were propagated in ECE, grown to high titer, and
harvested as described previously. Each virus was extracted using Roche
MagNA Pure Compact RNA kit and the purified RNA was tested in
triplicate with each marker following the CDC rRT-PCR 2009
A(H1N1)pdm Flu Panel protocol.

Cross reactivity with Common Non-Influenza Human Respiratory
Pathogens
Analytical specificity was evaluated by testing each primer/probe set within
the device panel with nucleic acids extracted from 34 organisms (15 viruses,
18 bacteria, and 1 yeast) representing common respiratory pathogens or
flora commonly present in specimens collected from the nasopharynx
region. Each sample (bacteria and virus) was extracted using either the
Roche MagNA Pure Compact Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I or the Roche
MagNA Pure Compact RNA kit. Each nucleic acid sample was tested once
following the testing procedure previously described for the CDC rRT-PCR
2009 A(H1N1)pdm Flu Panel.

f) Assay cut-off:
To assess the CDC Influenza 2009 A(H1N1)pdm Real-Time RT-PCR Panel
assay cut-off, the data from the limit of detection study was analyzed. Data
were plotted as virus concentration (log EID /mL) versus cycle threshold
50
(Ct) value at or below the limits of detection for each marker as shown in
Figures 1 through 3. The average Ct value at the lower end of the range of
the limit of detection plus two standards of deviation afforded the Ct value
cut-off for each of the markers in the CDC Influenza 2009 A(H1N1)pdm
Real-Time RT-PCR Panel as shown by the red line (InfA = 39; pdm InfA =
37; pdm H1 = 40).

Based on this analysis, the analytical cutoff value defined for the CDC
Influenza 2009 A(H1N1)pdm Real-Time RT-PCR Panel was less than
38. These data indicate that the InfA and pdm H1 primer and probe sets
may be more sensitive. However, setting the cutoff Ct value too high
could result in false positive results. The clinical study also supports this
cutoff value.

c. Performance in Fresh vs. Frozen Clinical Specimens:
To determine the effect of a freeze/thaw cycle of a specimen on the CDC
Influenza 2009 A(H1N1)pdm Real-Time RT-PCR Panel result, a comparison
study was performed utilizing a subset of specimens collected prospectively
for the 2009-2010 clinical evaluation of the CDC rRT-PCR 2009
A(H1N1)pdm Flu Panel. Based upon the initial CDC Influenza 2009
A(H1N1)pdm Real-Time RT-PCR Panel and virus culture results, fifty- one
positive and twenty negative specimens were chosen among three different
U.S. Public Health Laboratories. Frozen aliquots of these specimens were
20

--- Page 21 ---
thawed, extracted using the bioMérieux NucliSENS® easyMAG® (California),
the manual QIAamp® Viral RNA Mini Kit (Massachuesettes), or the Roche
MagNA Pure LC 2.0 with Total Nucleic Acid (TNA) Kit (Wisconsin), and
retested using the CDC rRT-PCR 2009 A(H1N1)pdm Flu Panel. The study
showed 100% concordance (qualitative) between the initial CDC Influenza
2009 A(H1N1)pdm Real-Time RT-PCR Panel result and the result after one
freeze/thaw cycle.

3. Clinical studies:
Performance characteristics of the CDC rRT-PCR 2009 A(H1N1)pdm Flu Panel
were established during a prospective study at 8 U.S. public health laboratories and
a Department of Defense (DoD) laboratory during the 2009-2010 respiratory virus
season (February-April). Samples used for this study were collected for routine
influenza testing at each site from individuals who were symptomatic with
influenza-like illness (ILI) and included both upper and lower respiratory specimen
types. Because of the low prevalence of influenza, retrospective specimens were
used to supplement prospectively collected specimens.

The reference methods utilized in this study were virus culture with
Immunofluorescent Antibody (IFA) or Direct Fluorescent Antibody (DFA) for
identification of influenza type and bi-directional sequencing for confirmation
of 2009 H1N1 influenza subtype. InfA analyte results from the CDC rRT-PCR
2009 A(H1N1)pdm Flu Panel were compared to virus culture results in the
analysis. Sequencing was performed only with specimens that were first
identified as positive for influenza A by virus culture. Pdm InfA and pdm H1
analyte results from the CDC rRT-PCR 2009 A(H1N1)pdm Flu Panel were
compared to bi-directional sequencing results in the analysis.
A total of 1901 patient specimens were evaluated at the nine clinical testing
sites: 1191 nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and nasal swabs (NS), 50 throat
swabs, 519 nasal washes and nasal aspirates, 99 dual NPS/TS, and 42 lower
respiratory specimens.

A total of 46 prospective and two retrospective throat swabs were tested. A total of
eight (8) specimens were correctly identified as 2009 H1N1 influenza positive.
Performance characteristics for 2009 H1N1 influenza virus using throat swab (TS)
specimens were established testing a limited number of specimens. Users may wish
to establish the sensitivity of this test for throat swab specimens by testing
additional samples
Retrospective Study
The prevalence of influenza decreased significantly during the prospective clinical
evaluation of the CDC rRT-PCR 2009 A(H1N1)pdm Flu Panel. This decrease
prompted the supplementation of prospective specimens with archived specimens
from earlier in the 2009-2010 influenza season. The archived specimens were
selected for incorporation into the study if they met the same inclusion criteria as
the prospective specimens and were also tested by virus culture at the time they
were first received at each site. Individual specimen types included in the
retrospective study were 214 nasal aspirates and nasal washes, 312 nasopharyngeal
swabs and nasal swabs, 31 dual-collected nasopharyngeal swabs/throat swabs, and
10 lower respiratory specimens.
The retrospective study results are stratified by specimen type and are presented in
the tables below
