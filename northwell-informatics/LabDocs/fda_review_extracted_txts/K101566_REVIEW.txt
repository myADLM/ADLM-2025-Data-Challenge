Product Information.
2. Indication(s) for use:
VITEK® 2 Yeast Caspofungin is designed for antifungal susceptibility testing of
Candida species. VITEK® 2 Yeast Caspofungin is a quantitative test intended for use
with the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems as a laboratory aid in the
determination of in vitro susceptibility to antifungal agents. Caspofungin has been shown
to be active against most isolates of the following the microorganisms in vitro and in
clinical infections according to the FDA label for the antifungal:
Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida guilliermondii, Candida krusei, Candida
parapsilosis, and Candida tropicalis
The VITEK® Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) is intended to be used with the
VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems for the automated quantitative or qualitative
susceptibility testing of isolated colonies for the most clinically significant aerobic gram-
negative bacilli, Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, S.
pneumoniae and clinically significant yeast.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
For use with the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems
I. Device Description:
VITEK® 2 Yeast panels are designed for testing Candida species. The panels contain
concentrations of antifungal drugs equivalent by efficacy to standard method concentrations
in μg/mL dried with microbiological media. Isolated colonies of Candida species are diluted
to a standardized concentration in 0.45% saline before being used to rehydrate the antifungal
drug concentration in the card. The VITEK® 2 automatically fills, seals and places the card
into the incubator/reader. The VITEK® 2 monitors the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period of time (up to 36 hours). The computer determines when a well demonstrates
growth based on attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner. At the completion of
the incubation cycle a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the
interpretive category result for each antifungal contained on the card. The final concentration
in the card of the inoculum is ~ 106 CFU/ml. A final dilution of organism can be performed
using a manual procedure or an automated feature but there are no manual readings possible.

CLSI standard M27-A3 ”Reference Method for Broth Dilution Antifungal Susceptibility
Testing of Yeasts; Approved Standard”.
L. Test Principle:
The principle of the VITEK® 2 AST cards is based on the broth microdilution minimum
inhibitory concentration technique. The VITEK® 2 AST card is essentially a miniaturized,
abbreviated and automated version of the doubling dilution technique for MICs determined
by the microdilution method. The automated growth-based detection uses attenuation of light
measured by an optical scanner. Each AST card contains 64 microwells. A control well
containing only microbiological culture medium is resident on all cards, with the remaining
wells containing premeasured amounts of specific antimicrobials combined with culture
medium. The organism suspension to be tested must be diluted to a standardized
concentration in 0.45% saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium
within the card. The card is then filled, sealed, and placed into the instrument
incubator/reader, either automatically (as with VITEK® 2 60 or VITEK® 2 XL) or manually
(as with VITEK® 2 Compact). The instrument monitors the growth of each well in the card
over a defined period of time (up to 18 hours for bacteria or up to 36 hours for yeast). At the
completion of the incubation cycle, MIC values (or test results, as appropriate) are
determined for each antimicrobial contained on the card.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
For VITEK 2 System, reproducibility was determined through testing ten isolates (6
Candida parapsilosis, 3 C. guilliermondii, and 1 C. lusitaniae) at three external
clinical sites in triplicate over 3 days. The testing was performed using both
inoculation options: the manual dilution method and the automated dilution method.
For the reproducibility calculations, off-scale values are handled in two ways; “best case”
and “worst case” scenarios. Best case calculation for reproducibility assumes the off-
scale result is within one well from the mode MIC value. Worst case calculation for
reproducibility assuming the off-scale result is greater than one well from the mode MIC
value. There were no off-scale results in this study. So, only one value for overall
reproducibility is reported for each reading method.
Results were reported and analyzed for each method separately. For Automated
dilution, the reproducibility values were 97.8%, 93.7%for best case and worst case
scenarios, respectively. For Manual dilution, the reproducibility values were 100%,
95.6% for best case and worst case scenarios, respectively.
For the VITEK 2 Compact System, reproducibility was also evaluated using the same
protocol and set of isolates used for the VITEK 2 System. Only manual dilution data
4

--- Page 5 ---
is available for VITEK 2 Compact System since the automatic dilution is not an
option on this instrument. A reproducibility of 100% was obtained for best case and
worst case scenarios since there were no off-scale results.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Quality Control testing was performed on each day of clinical testing using two
quality control ATCC strains recommended in the CLSI standard M27. The following
table represents the frequency of the results in both the reference method and the
VITEK 2 Yeast Caspofungin cards and the acceptable range.
Quality control was performed using the VITEK 2 Yeast Caspofungin card and
testing was done by both the manual dilution and the automated dilution method (for
VITEK 2 System) and by the manual dilution method only (for VITEK 2 Compact
System). Testing was performed a minimum of twenty times by automatic and
manual dilution.
As shown in the tables below, some of the QC results obtained with the reference
method for C. parpsilosis were one doubling dilution above the acceptable range.
However, all VITEK QC results were within acceptable range. QC results obtained
with the reference method for C. krusei were acceptable and the VITEK QC values
were within acceptable range by both manual dilution and Auto Dilution for both
strains.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The performance of the VITEK 2 System was established through a clinical study
which was conducted at three sites (2 external, 1 internal). Testing was done on 755
fresh clinical isolates and 98 challenge isolates. Challenge isolates were also tested
on the VITEK 2 Compact.
In total, 856 clinical and challenge isolates were tested by VITEK® 2 Yeast
Caspofungin with the VITEK® 2 System. The VITEK® 2 results were compared to
the reference values that were determined by the CLSI broth microdilution reference
method tested at each study site. Of the total 853 isolates have VITEK® 2 AST
results available; three isolates did not grow in the VITEK® 2 card.
Since only susceptible breakpoints have been defined for Caspofungin (i.e. no
intermediate and resistant categories), the following limitation will be taken for this
product:
“The ability of the AST card to detect resistance with the following combination(s) is
unknown because Caspofungin-resistant strains were not available at the time of
comparative testing for Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. guilliermondii, C. krusei,
C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis.”
Results for the 853 clinical and challenge isolates are summarized in the tables below.

VITEK® 2 Yeast Caspofungin were compared to the expected reference results.
All of the challenge organisms grew in the VITEK® 2 Yeast Caspofungin test.
