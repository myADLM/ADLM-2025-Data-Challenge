Immunological Assays for Human Immunoglobulin E (IgE)

L. Test Principle:
The assay is a solid-phase, two-step, chemiluminescent immunoassay that exploits
liquid phase kinetics in a bead format. The allergens are covalently bound to a
soluble polymer/co-polymer matrix, which is labeled with a ligand. The assay
specific antibody is labeled with alkaline phosphatase. The use of an amino acid co-
polymer amplifies the amount of allergen that the matrix can support. The
chemiluminescent detection system is a phosphatase ester of stabilized dioxatane.
Cleavage of the phosphate ester by alkaline phosphatase results in the decomposition
of dioxatane and the emission of photons, which are quantified by a luminometer.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the assay was assessed by testing three positive samples and one
negative control sample of each allergen (Basil, Cacao, Oregano, Parsley, Pine
Nut, and Vanilla) in duplicate twice a day for 20 different days (n = 80).
Additional positive sample was added for precision study on Basil, Oregano,
and Pine Nut at the higher concentration levels. The acceptance criterion for
the negative sample was the average dose level must be <0.10 kU/L; mean
results for all negative samples were within the acceptance criterion. The
acceptance criterion for the positive samples was ≤15% CV for both within-
run and total precision. Three allergen lots were tested for each allergen;
representative data from one lot is shown below for the positive samples. The
%CV for within-run and total precision ranged from 2.83% to 8.54% and
3.65% to 9.29%, respectively.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The calibrators and controls are traceable to the WHO 2nd IRP
75/502 reference standard for human IgE.
Stability:
Allergen stability: Accelerated allergen stability testing was done with two
positive samples and one negative sample on three lots per allergen (15-25ºC
for 57 days; assay kits stored at recommended temperature 2-8ºC). Tests were
done at initiation (Day 1) and 5 time points thereafter (Day 4, 8, 15, 28 and
57). The accelerated study supports a two year shelf-life stability claim for
the allergens tested (Basil, Cacao, Oregano, Parsley, Pine Nut, and Vanilla).
Real-time allergen stability was tested with two positive samples and one
negative sample on three lots per allergen. Scheduled target dates tested were
on days 30, 60, 180, 360, 540, 720 and 750. All samples were within the
acceptance criteria.
On-board/ Open-vial stability: Two positive samples and one negative
sample were tested per individual specific allergen lot on Basil, Cacao,
Oregano, Parsley, Pine Nut, and Vanilla. Data points were collected on days
1, 7, 14, 21, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 91. The study supports the 2-week stability
claim for on-board/open vial stability.
Adjustment interval (calibration curve) stability: Testing was performed at
days 1 and 14 to validate the 2-week adjustment interval. The calibration
curve stability study supports the 2-week stability claim.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB): To estimate the LoB, the blank sample (zero
calibrator) was assayed for three runs on three instruments per run. The
maximum dose of the LoB was selected as the most conservative LoB:
LoB = 0.026. The claimed LoB is 0.1 kU/L.
MAX
Limit of Detection (LoD): Five samples were used to estimate the LoD.

Sixty replicates of each sample were assayed per run for 2 runs on 2 different
instruments. The LoD was calculated for each sample using the formula: LoD
= LoB + (1.65 * SD ) The claimed LoD is 0.1 kU/L
MAX LOD .
e. Analytical specificity:
Inhibition studies: Specificity of each allergen was verified through
competitive inhibition testing using a single serum sample or pool of sera. A
negative sample was used to measure the background response.
To initiate the inhibition experiment, 70 µL of undiluted and 3-4 levels of 5-
fold serially diluted inhibitor extract were mixed with 250 µL of sample or
pool to achieve final inhibitor concentrations of 218.75, 43.75, 8.75, 1.75,
0.35, 0.08, 0.07, 0.02, 0.01, 0.003 μg/mL inhibitor. This mixture was
incubated at room temperature (15-28°C) for 1 hour allowing the
immunological reaction to occur. Each sample mixture containing the
inhibitor extract and the appropriate controls was assayed with 1 lot of each
allergen. The percent (%) inhibition was calculated according to the
following formula:
(Response of pos. control – sample response with inhibitor extract)
(pos. sample – neg. sample) X 100
(Response of pos. control )
(pos. sample – neg. sample)
The inhibition plots demonstrate that the allergens tested are inhibited by the
relevant inhibitor extract in a concentration-dependent fashion. Also, the
target % inhibition of 50% for the highest inhibitor concentration tested was
met. These results indicate specificity of Basil, Cacao, Oregano, Parsley, Pine
Nut and Vanilla allergens.
Additional inhibition studies were conducted to show that the specific
allergens are not cross-reacting to the unrelated allergens. Testing was
performed using one positive sample with three unrelated allergen extracts. A
negative sample was used to measure the background response. Results of
inhibition against unrelated allergens with the positive sample for specific
allergens Basil, Cacao, Oregano, Parsley, Pine Nut and Vanilla were within
the sponsor’s acceptance criteria.
Cross-reactivity: The manufacturer states there is no detectable cross
reactivity with human serum immunoglobulins IgG, IgA, IgM or IgD at
normal physiological levels.

Clinical performance of the IMMULITE® 2000 3gAllergy Specific IgE assay
for Basil, Cacao, Oregano, Parsley, Pine Nut and Vanilla allergens was
demonstrated by testing samples from non-atopic and atopic individuals.
Atopic patients were selected from patients who had clinical documentation of
allergy to specific allergen(s) or allergen group of interest and/or positive skin
prick/ scratch test to specific allergen(s) of interest evaluated as 2+ or greater.
Information on the skin test allergen extracts (crude or purified) was not
documented. Non-atopic patients were clinically known non-allergenic or had
total IgE <130 ng/mL or 54 IU/mL (2.4 ng = 1 IU). Testing was performed
on 142 samples for Basil, 130 samples for Cacao, 142 samples for Oregano,
142 samples for Parsley, 130 samples for Pine Nut, and 142 samples for
Vanilla.

Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Not detected.
Refer to the Hoffman’s ’Standard’ and ‘Extended Standard’ classification system
utilizing Class 0 to Class IV cut-offs (see Tables I and II below).
Table I: The Standard classification system utilizes the following class cutoffs:
Class kU/L Reactivity for Individual/
Component Allergen(s)
< 0.10 Absent or ND†
0*
0.10 – 0.34 Very Low
I 0.35 – 0.69 Low
II 0.70 – 3.49 Moderate
III 3.50 – 17.49 High
IV 17.5 – 52.49
V 52.5 – 99.99 Very High
VI ≥ 100
* Class 0 in the standard system signifies: not detectable by second-
generation assays.
† ND: not detectable by IMMULITE 2000 3gAllergy.
Table II: The Extended standard classification system utilizes the following class
cutoffs.
Class kU/L Reactivity for Individual/
Component Allergen(s)
0 < 0.10 Absent or ND†
0/1 0.10 – 0.24 Very Low
I 0.25 – 0.39 Low
II 0.40 – 1.29 Moderate
