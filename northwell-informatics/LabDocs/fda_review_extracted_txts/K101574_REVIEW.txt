L. Test Principle:
The ARK Gabapentin Assay is a homogeneous immunoassay based on competition
between drug in the specimen and gabapentin labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for binding to the antibody reagent. As the latter
binds antibody, enzyme activity decreases. In the presence of drug from the
specimen, enzyme activity increases and is directly proportional to the drug
concentration. Active enzyme converts the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH that is measured spectrophotometrically as a rate of
change in absorbance. Endogenous serum G6PDH does not interfere with the results
because the coenyzme NAD functions only with the bacterial enzyme used in the
assay.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Performance was validated on the Hitachi 917 instrument.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed on a Hitachi 917 analyzer over twenty (20)
non-consecutive days. Multiple calibrations were performed during this
interval to provide variation, although each calibration was performing in a
stable manner. Samples evaluated included tri-level ARK Gabapentin
Controls and three pooled human serum samples. Each sample
(calibrator/control matrix and pooled human serum) was assayed in
quadruplicate twice a day, with each run separated by at least two hours.
Calculations were conducted according to CLSI Guideline EP5-A2. The

ARK performed an additional precision study supplementing both the
calibrator/control matrix and the serum matrix with gabapentin to obtain a target
concentration of 36 μg/mL. The human serum matrix was comprised of pooled
human specimens containing gabapentin and then further supplemented to the
target level. Samples were tested twice a day (at least two hours separation per
day) for five separate days. A total of 40 replicate measurements were made.

serum in order to obtain a concentration of 48µg/mL and confirmation of this
concentration was made by LC/MS/MS. Dilutions of this concentration (48
µg/mL) were made proportionally with pooled human serum negative for
gabapentin to create samples ranging from 0.75 µg/mL – 48 µg/mL). The
averaged results of multiple runs and replicates (n=6) for each sample using
the ARK assay were used in the calculations. The results at each separate
level were averaged and compared to the target concentration (based on
spiked concentrations of USP materials) and the percentage recovery was
calculated. The following table represents the data in terms of % recoveries:

High Sample Carryover
The impact of high gabapentin concentration specimens on the measurement
of gabapentin in specimens with lower concentrations (high sample carryover)
was evaluated by assaying a series of high 100.0 µg/mL spiked serum samples
followed by a series of low 2.0µg/mL spiked serum samples. No carryover
was observed from the High 100.0 µg/mL sample to the Low 2.0 µg/mL
sample.
Manual Dilution Protocol
The manufacturer recommends that samples with concentrations exceeding
40.0µg/mL should be diluted 4-fold with zero calibrator. Samples spiked with
gabapentin and patient samples containing gabapentin (with initial
concentrations ranging from 38.8 to 100µg/mL) were diluted 4-fold with zero
calibrator and results using the ARK method were compared to the target level
(for spiked samples) and the LC-MS/MS determined level (for neat samples).
The percentage recovery ranged from 90.9 to 110.8%.
ARK performed an additional study by supplementing aliquots of neat
specimens with gabapentin. Three specimens were supplemented with
50µg/mL gabapentin and tested after diluting them by a factor of 4. The
percentage recovery ranged from 100.5 to 104.4% which was calculated based
on the theoretical LC-MS/MS values for each sample.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and Value Assignment of Calibrator and Control Materials:
There is no internationally recognized standard for gabapentin.
ARK gabapentin calibrator materials are prepared by gravimetric dilution of
high purity gabapentin (USP>99.9% purity) into a synthetic proteinaceous
matrix free of gabapentin containing buffer, bovine serum albumin, and
preservative. Each calibrator level (B-F) is then qualified by testing multiple
times and comparing to a master calibrator lot with values to be within 5% at
each positive calibrator.
ARK gabapentin control materials are prepared by gravimetric dilution of

gabapentin in buffer, bovine serum albumin and preservative. Quality control
(QC) ranges are established using three runs with four replicates tested per run
(n=12 for each control level) and the mean gabapentin level of each control is
calculated. Control ranges were set at ± 15% around the mean level tested.
The package insert notes that each laboratory should establish its own ranges
for each new lot of controls.
Specimen Stability:
Stability of stored specimens (frozen and refrigerated storage) and the effect
of freezing/thawing on the measurement of gabapentin by the ARK™
Gabapentin Assay were evaluated. Testing of fresh specimens is preferred,
however, clarified serum specimens were shown to be stable for up to four
weeks frozen at ≤10ºC and for up to one week when refrigerated (2-8ºC). The
manufacturer’s acceptance criteria for this evaluation are recovery within
±10%. Specimens were shown to withstand 3 freeze-thaw cycles when stored
at -20ºC.
The ARK Gabapentin Calibrator and the ARK Gabapentin Control are
comprised of a synthetic proteinaceous matrix with buffer, bovine serum
albumin and preservatives. To evaluate recovery and matrix equivalence,
synthetic calibrator/control matrix (Calibrator A) and pooled human serum
were each supplemented with gabapentin to achieve 1.0, 2.0, 3.5, 9.0, 16.0,
22.0, 28.0, 35.0, and 40 µg/mL levels. Multiple replicates and runs were
performed and the mean recovery (of replicates) was calculated for each level
and each matrix. All levels tested in the calibrator matrix recovered within
90.2% of the serum gabapentin levels. Recoveries (percentage of nominal
level) were acceptable for both matrices, falling within 10% of the expected
spike level – calibrator/control matrix (90.2% - 104.1%) and serum matrix
(98.5% to 103.0%).
Calibration stability on the analyzer:
ARK provided a study on calibration stability on the analyzer. This study
supports the stable operation of the assay over an extended period based on
one calibration. Up to 84 days of calibration curve stability and in-use stability
of reagents, calibrators and controls were observed for the study as tested.
Calibrator and Control material stability:
1. The calibrator and control are stable until the expiration date (18
months) printed on the vial when stored unopened at 2-8ºC. Once
opened vials may be stored at 2-8°C for up to 12 months.
2. Real time stability studies are ongoing for both unopened and opened
calibrators and controls. Stability testing protocols and acceptance
8

criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
Accuracy and precision studies were performed to determine the
manufacturer’s claimed lower limit of quantitation (LOQ). These studies
were conducted using the CLSI Guideline EP 17-A. Three gabapentin levels
were tested below the lowest positive calibrator concentration (1.0µg/mL).
Samples were prepared by gravimetric addition of gabapentin (USP >99%
purity) to human serum negative for gabapentin to give concentrations of
0.50, 0.75, and 1.00 µg/mL. Eight replicates of each sample were tested in
each of five runs to give 40 replicates of each sample per reagent lot. A total
of three reagent lots were used for the study. The LOQ was chosen at 0.75
µg/mL where the precision was 7.6 %CV and the recovery was 91.0 %.
e. Analytical specificity:
Studies included testing for interference from endogenous compounds,
metabolite, and commonly co-administered, and other anti-epileptic drugs.
Serum samples with clinically high concentrations of the potential interfering
substances were tested by ARK Gabapentin assay in the presence of varying
amounts of gabapentin. Specifically, serum samples containing low
(2.0µg/mL) and high (20.0µg/mL) levels of gabapentin were tested. Each
sample containing interferent was assayed, along with a serum control of
gabapentin. No significant interference (defined by the manufacturer as ≤10%
differences in detecting gabapentin) was observed.

list of interferents tested and results are included in the package insert.
Drug Interference:
Gabapentin did not cross-react with other anti-epileptic or co-administered
drugs tested. A high concentration of each compound shown below was
spiked into normal human serum with known levels of gabapentin
(approximately 2 and 20 µg/mL) and assayed along with a serum control of
gabapentin. Measurement of gabapentin resulted in ≤10% error in the
presence of drug compounds at the levels tested.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were performed according to CLSI Guideline
EP9-A2. Banked samples from patients tested for gabapentin concentrations
were used. Inclusion criteria for the samples measured were based on
gabapentin concentration. No exclusion criteria were used for selection of
specimens. The large majority of specimens were in a serum matrix. (See also
matrix comparison, below.)
Results of samples obtained with the ARK assay in three separate laboratories
were compared to those obtained with two different reference methods (HPLC
and LC/MS/MS). Results of the Passing – Bablok regression analysis for
these studies are shown below:

Anticoagulated plasma and serum were evaluated to evaluate equivalency of
these matrices for measurement of gabapentin with the ARK™ Gabapentin
Assay. Samples with sufficient volume left for testing from the method
comparison study were utilized. Of the original 187 specimens, one hundred
forty-six (146) had sufficient volume to perform this study. Fibrinogen levels
were measured to distinguish plasma from serum. Seven specimens were
identified as plasma and 139 specimens were identified as serum.
Anticoagulant matrix comparison study:
Anticoagulated plasma and serum were evaluated to determine equivalency of
these matrices for measurement of gabapentin with the ARK™ Gabapentin
Assay. Matched samples for serum and plasma were collected from eight (8)
subjects. Blood was collected in three different anticoagulant tubes: lithium
heparin, potassium EDTA, sodium heparin, and a serum tube to produce a
matched set. Each sample matrix was spiked with a gabapentin stock solution
to give gabapentin concentrations of 0.75, 2.0, 20.0, and 30.0 µg/mL (for a
total of 32 samples per anticoagulant). The mean, standard deviation and
%CV for six replicates were calculated for each sample. Percentage recovery
of gabapentin in anticoagulated samples compared to the serum control was
calculated for each subject. Percent recoveries for the 0.75 µg/mL samples
ranged from 87.6 – 104.9% for plasma relative to serum values. Percent
recoveries for levels 2.0 to 30.0 µg/mL ranged from 93.6 to 109.3% for
plasma relative to serum values.
In addition, ARK performed an additional matrix comparison study using four
additional samples containing approximately 36 µg/mL. The percentage
recovery in plasma compared to that in serum ranged from 96.6% to 101.5%.
Regression analyses were prepared for each anticoagulant tube type with
results shown below:
Lithium Heparin Plasma vs Serum: y=1.00x + (-0.04), r2 = 1.00, N=36
Potassium EDTA Plasma vs Serum: y=0.99x + (-0.03), r2=1.00, N=36
Sodium Heparin Plasma vs Serum: y=1.00x + (-0.03), r2=1.00, N=36

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
The sponsor provided a discussion with balanced and representative literature
discussing clinical use of gabapentin measurements.
4. Clinical cut-off:
See expected values below.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The following is included in the package insert:
A therapeutic range for gabapentin has not been well established. A reference
range of 2 μg/mL to 20 μg/mL1,2has been proposed. Studies2 have suggested that
optimal responses to gabapentin in patients with difficult-to-treat partial seizures
are achieved at concentrations >2 μg/mL or in a range of 4 to 11 μg/mL, while
others proposed a higher range of 6 to 21 μg/mL. It has been reported that toxicity
with gabapentin tends to occur with increasing frequency when serum
concentrations exceed 25 μg/mL.Interindividual variability may be influenced by
dose-related saturable drug absorption, and hence, variable pharmacokinetic
properties.
The reference range of drug concentrations which is quoted should only imply a
lower limit below which a therapeutic response is relatively unlikely to occur, and
an upper limit above which toxicity is relatively likely to occur in the specific
patient populations studied. Generally, clinicians using reference ranges such as
these should be aware that, because of individual variation, patients may achieve
therapeutic benefit with serum drug concentrations outside of these ranges and
may experience toxicity with levels below the lower limit of the reference range.
Because gabapentin has a relatively short half-life, sampling time in relation to
dose ingestion is important for the interpretation of the drug concentration.
Sampling time should be standardized such that trough serum concentrations are
measured just before the next dosage, preferably in the morning.
