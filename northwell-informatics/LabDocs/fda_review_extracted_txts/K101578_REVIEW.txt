are as follows:
WBC Lot 1 %CV Lot 2 %CV Lot 3 %CV
Level 1 15.4 7.1 6.3
Level 2 3.0 6.7 3.0
Level 3 1.8 1.9 2.0

Level 3 0.7 0.7 0.7
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Value assignment: Specific to each lot and level of control, a total of four
vials are analyzed in duplicate. A cumulative mean and standard deviation
(SD) are calculated for each measurand reported. The assay ranges are set at
±2SD for level 1 RBC and WBC. Level 2 and level 3 RBC and WBC ranges
reflect ±3SD.
Open Vial Stability: Three lots of control material each containing 3 levels
were tested near the end of their closed vial shelf life for the purpose of
evaluating open vial stability. The controls were stored at 2 - 8°C until they
were tested. Over the course of 30 days the control was analyzed 9 to11
times. The results for the study are as follows:
WBC Lot 1 %CV Lot 2 %CV Lot 3 %CV
Level 1 12.0 8.9 9.2
Level 2 5.1 4.3 4.5
Level 3 2.1 3.7 3.0
RBC Lot 1 %CV Lot 2 %CV Lot 3 %CV
Level 1 10.2 9.2 8.2
Level 2 10.2 3.3 3.1
Level 3 1.5 1.3 1.5
Closed Vial Stability: For the purpose of evaluating closed vial stability,
three lots of control material each containing 3 levels were tested 23-26 times
over the course of 75 days. The results for the study are as follows:
WBC Lot 1 %CV Lot 2 %CV Lot 3 %CV
Level 1 15.5 20.3 14.4
Level 2 4.7 10.3 4.8
Level 3 2.6 7.4 2.4
