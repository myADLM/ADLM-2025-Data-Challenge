L. Test Principle:
The detection and measurement of glucose in blood is by an electrochemical biosensor
technology using glucose dehydrogenase. The CHOICE DM® COMPLETE by FORA
GD20 Blood Glucose Monitoring System and the U-RIGHT TD-4252 Blood Glucose
Monitoring System employs flavin adenine dinucleotide-glucose dehydrogenase
(FAD-GDH) enzyme chemistry as the standard dry reagent assay for glucose in
whole blood. This enzyme assay, with a redox chemical “mediator” reaction, is used
to generate an electrical current proportional to the glucose concentration in the blood
sample. The system is designed as an amperometric measurement device using
current generated from the redox reaction as the measurable response.

The CHOICE DM® COMPLETE by FORA GD20 Blood Glucose
Monitoring System
The repeatability study was performed by one operator using heparinized anti-
coagulated whole blood (hematocrit ranged between 38%-54%) at five
different glucose concentrations. The final glucose concentrations for the
blood samples were confirmed by YSI. Each sample was tested on ten meters
using three lots of test strips (three meters with each of the two test strip lots
and four meters with one test strip lot). Ten measurements were obtained per
meter and test strip lot, and glucose concentration (N=100 per concentration
level). The result is summarized below:

and 3 are 52.35 mg/dL (41.88 to 62.82 mg/dL), 154.79 mg/dL (123.83 to
185.75 mg/dL), and 314.63 mg/dL (251.7 to 377.56 mg/dL), respectively.
Open vial control stability was tested at three control levels on three lots.
Based on these studies, open vial stability is 90 days when stored at 35.6°F and
86°F (2°C and 30°C) below 85% R.H. Unopened vial control stability was
tested in real time at three control levels on three lots. Unopened control
solutions were tested under identical conditions as the opened control
solutions. The Unopened control solutions have a 24 month shelf life when
stored at 35.6°F and 86°F (2°C and 30°C) below 85% R.H. Stability studies
protocol and acceptance criteria for open and unopened vials were provided and
found to be adequate.
FORA GD20 and U-RIGHT TD-4252 Glucose Test Strips:
Real time stability was performed separately for FORA GD20 and U-RIGHT
TD-4252 glucose test strips to assess the shelf-life and open-vial stability of the
test strips. Stability studies protocol and acceptance criteria were provided and
found to be adequate. The sponsor claimed that the unopened test strips have a
18 month shelf-life and are stable for 3 months after opening when stored at
35.6°F - 86°F (2°C - 30°C) below 10 - 85% R.H.
This information is provided in the labeling of the test strips and control
materials.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range is 20 to 600 mg/dL based on the linearity/assay
reportable range study above (section M.1.b).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference study was designed according to CLSI EP7-A2 guideline for the
CHOICE DM® COMPLETE by FORA GD20 Blood Glucose Monitoring
System and the U-RIGHT TD-4252 Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
Identical results were obtained for both the systems.
75 common potential endogenous and exogenous interfering substances were
evaluated by spiking venous blood with two levels of glucose concentrations
(85 mg/dL and 130 mg/dL). The glucose samples were spiked with the
potentially interfering compounds and tested on four meters. Several
concentrations of the interfering substances were tested as shown in the table
below. Non interfering substances were tested at toxic level concentrations or
10 times the highest therapeutic concentrations as recommended in CLSI EP7-
A2 guidance. The sugar and alcohol substances with unknown blood
concentration were tested at 1000 mg/dL. If the blood concentration of the
substance is not known, the concentration tested was three times the
therapeutic dose distributed in 5L of blood. Bias was calculated as the mean
9

--- Page 10 ---
percent difference in glucose reading between the test and control
concentration groups. Significant interference is defined by the sponsor as a
bias ≥ 10 % from the control group as measured on YSI.
The sponsor claims no significant interference (< 10% difference) for the
substances and concentrations shown in the table below:

evaluated on the FORA GD20 Blood Glucose Monitoring System and the U-
RIGHT TD-4252 Blood Glucose Monitoring System using six meters of each
device, and one test strip lot. Blood samples at nine hematocrit levels from
20% to 60% (20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55 and 60%) were evaluated in seven
concentrations of glucose of approximately 60, 100, 160, 265, 350, 480 and
600 mg/dL. Glucose concentrations were compared to YSI. No significant
interference from hematocrit was defined as bias within ± 15%. Results that
demonstrated that hematocrit levels between 20%-60% do not significantly
interfere with glucose measurements.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The CHOICE DM® COMPLETE by FORA GD20 Blood Glucose
Monitoring System
The method comparison and AST studies were conducted at three sites by
three technicians at each site, using three test strip lots (one strip lot per site)
and two meters. Healthcare professionals performed two fingertip capillary
blood glucose measurements on two glucose meters from a total of 150
subjects followed by testing in duplicate by YSI within 5 minutes. Similarly
healthcare professionals performed two measurements at each of the claimed
AST sites (palm, forearm and upper arm) each followed by testing in
duplicate by YSI. The glucose concentration of the samples spanned the
measuring range following the ISO 15197 guidelines for distribution of
samples (at each site). Distribution of glucose concentrations across the
measuring range was: 9 samples between < 50 mg/dL, 20 samples between
50 - 80 mg/dL, 32 samples between 81 - 120 mg/dL, 43 samples between 121
- 200 mg/dL, and 23 samples between 201 - 300 mg/dL. Of the 150 samples,
eight samples (for concentrations below 50 mg/dL) were glycolyzed and nine
samples (for concentrations above 400 mg/dL) were spiked. The meters were
cleaned between each patient use following the protocol described in the
labeling with the recommended disinfectant wipes. The studies met ISO
15197 accuracy criteria, e.g., 95% of glucose results < 75 mg/dL were within
± 15 mg/dL, and for samples ≥ 75 mg/dL, 95% of results were within ± 20%
of the reference method. Results are summarized below:

FORA GD20 BGMS
Anticoagulant comparison studies for FORA GD20 BGMS were performed
with venous whole blood collected in K3-EDTA and sodium heparin from a
total of 150 subjects. The study was performed at three clinical sites by three
technicians at each site, using three test strip lots (one strip lot per site) and
two meters. The venous whole blood samples were collected in commercially
marketed drawing tubes containing anticoagulant K3-EDTA (at site 2) and
sodium heparin (at site 1 and 3). The glucose concentration of the samples
spanned the measuring range following the ISO 15197 guidelines for
distribution of samples (at each site). Of the 150 samples, eight samples (for
concentrations below 50 mg/dL) were glycolyzed and nine samples (for
concentrations above 400 mg/dL) were spiked. The accuracy was evaluated
by comparing the FORA GD20 meter measurements to YSI at three sites.

2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this line of product types:
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied
directly to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger,
palm, forearm and upper arm only. The whole blood sample is applied directly to
the test strip by capillary action.
5. Calibration:
The FORA GD20 and the U-RIGHT TD-4252 meters are no code devices.
Reaction intensities of new test strip lots must meet the manufacturer’s no code
criteria for use with these meters. Validation of new strip lots is confirmed by
comparison to the YSI across the measuring range of the device.
6. Quality Control:
Glucose control solutions at three different concentrations can be run with the
FORA GD20 and the U-RIGHT TD-4252 devices. These meters have a ‘C
button’ to mark the test with control solutions to prevent control results from
being stored in the internal memory as patient results. Recommendations on
when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. The control
solution readings are not included in the average of the patient results. An
acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The
user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these
ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. A usability study was performed to assess the readability of the labeling by recruiting
133 lay users (aged 18-70 yrs old) who were provided with the test kit containing
labeling in English for the US market. Participants varied in age, education, country
of origin, and were about evenly divided between men and women. These lay users
also completed a questionnaire to indicate whether the device is easy to use and the
Instructions for use were written in a way that makes it easy to use. The majority of
the users responded that the device is very easy to use.

2. Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the results showed that
the labeling (User Guide, test strip package insert and control solution package
insert) were written at grade levels ranging from 7.0th to 8.0th grade.
3. Customer service is available 24/7, 365 days a year. Toll free phone numbers are
1-888-307-8188 and 1-866-469-2632 for customer support.
4. Insufficient sample studies were performed (separately for FORA GD20 and U-
RIGHT TD-4252 BGMS) at 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 1.0, 1.5 and 2 µL volumes around
the recommended volume (0.7 µL) using three test strip lots. Each sample was
tested five times per strip lot. Three glucose concentration levels of venous whole
blood and control solutions were tested (level 1 30-50 mg/dL, level 2 96-144
mg/dL and level 3 280-420 mg/dL) as determined by the YSI. Appropriate
sample volume was determined if the meter results compared to YSI results were
within 10% bias for blood samples and less than 5% CV for control solutions. A
blood volume ≥ 0.6 µL met the criteria.
5. Temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated for temperatures
ranging from 50oF to 104oF (10oC to 40oC) and relative humidity from 10% to
85% R.H. The sponsor tested combination of lowest and highest temperature
with lowest and highest humidity. The study protocol and acceptance criteria
were provided and found to be acceptable. The results supported the Sponsor’s
claimed operating temperature from 50oF to 104oF (10oC to 40oC) and relative
humidity from 10% to 85%.
6. The effect of altitude on the accuracy of the device was evaluated on the FORA
GD20 Blood Glucose Monitoring System and the U-RIGHT TD-4252 Blood
Glucose Monitoring System with four meters and one test strip lot. Blood
samples at seven concentrations of glucose of approximately 70, 115, 190, 275,
390, 450 and 630 mg/dL were tested at three altitude levels (5000, 11500 and
15000 feet) and at sea level (0 feet). Testing was performed in an altitude
simulation glove box system. Each sample was also tested by YSI-2300. No
significant interference from altitude was defined by the sponsor as bias within
±10%. The data demonstrates that elevation of 11, 500 and 15, 000 feet does not
affect the accuracy of the two devices. Based on the data, the sponsor claims that
the FORA GD20 Blood Glucose Monitoring System and the U-RIGHT TD-4252
Blood Glucose Monitoring System can be used at altitude up to 10, 742 feet.
7. The FORA GD20 BGMS is intended for multiple patient use by healthcare
professionals and U-RIGHT TD-4252 is intended for home use by single person.
Disinfection studies were performed on the FORA GD20 meter and TD-4252
meter by an outside commercial testing service to determine the robustness of the
meter and lancing device to the recommended cleaning and disinfection protocol,
and its effectiveness in preventing the spread of bloodborne pathogens,
particularly hepatitis B virus (HBV). Micro-Kill+™ (Micro-Kill Plus) by

Medline disposable wipes (EPA Reg. No.59894-10-37549) was validated,
demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus for use with the FORA GD20
and TD-4252 meters. The sponsor demonstrated that there was no change in
performance or in the external materials of the FORA GD20 meter after 10,000
cleaning and disinfection cycles to simulate an estimated 9 cleaning and
disinfection cycles per day over 3 years of healthcare professional use. The
sponsor also demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the
external materials of the U-RIGHT TD-4252 meter after 5000 cleaning and
disinfection cycles to simulate an estimated 4 cleaning and disinfection cycles per
day over 3 year use. Labeling has been reviewed for adequate instructions on the
validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
8. EMC testing was evaluated and certified by SGS Taiwan Ltd. and a letter of
attestation was issued to TaiDoc Technology Corp. on August 25, 2011.
