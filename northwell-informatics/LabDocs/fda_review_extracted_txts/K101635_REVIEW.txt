L. Test Principle:
The TD 4239 glucose meters, in conjunction with the same test trips, utilize amperometric
technology to quantitatively measure the glucose concentration in whole blood samples and
in control solutions. A glucose dehydrogenase sensor based on the carbon electrode adopting
the amperometric assay utilizes the enzyme glucose dehydrogenase to catalyze the formation
of gluconolactone from the oxidation of glucose whereby two electrons are produced.
Through the mechanism of the mediator, electrical current is generated and it is proportional
to the quantity of glucose in the sample.
The reaction principle of reagent depends on following reaction equation:
GDH, FAD
Glucose + 2 ferricyanide = gluconolactone + 2 ferrocyanide
electrode
ferrocyanide = ferricyanide + e
-
GDH: glucose dehydrogenase
FAD: flavin adenine dinucleotide
The glucose biosensors recognize the glucose present in whole blood or control solutions by
virtue of the specificity of the enzyme FAD dependent glucose dehydrogenase (GDH)
present on the test strip. The electrons liberated by this reaction are transferred via a co-
factor and mediator to the meter where they are read as a small electrical current. The
magnitude of the resultant current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the
specimen and the signal is converted into a readout displayed on the meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
The TD-4239 and theTD-4239 Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System are the same
meters and test strips, however, they have separate names because of the different

indications for use. All performance studies were conducted using the TD 4239 Blood
Glucose Monitoring System.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed precision studies in accordance with ISO 15197 and CLSI
EP-5A. Fresh venous whole blood adjusted to 7 glucose levels (hematocrit 45%)
were used for within-day precision studies. Each concentration was tested 10 times
each on 10 meters, using 3 test strip lots, (100 total tests divided between 3 strip lots
per blood glucose level). Results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor performed linearity studies using adjusted venous blood samples with 12
different glucose concentrations ranging from less than 10 to 750 mg/dL for the TD-
4239 Blood Glucose Monitoring System. For each level solution, 10 consecutive
tests (with 5 measurements per lot) by YSI-2300 and TD-4239 glucose meter were
performed respectively. The resulting data was compared and the linear regression
analyses were as follows:
TD-4239 Slope =1.0086 y intercept = 1.3961 r2 = 0.9992
The measuring range is 20-600 mg/dL for the TD-4239 Blood Glucose Monitoring
System and 10-600 mg/dL for the TD-4239 Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System
and has been shown to be linear within the measuring range.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Fora control solutions were cleared under k 093724
The TD-4239 Blood Glucose Monitoring System and TD-4239- multi Blood Glucose
Monitoring System (including control solution and strips) have an operating
environment of 50-104 degrees F and a relative humidity between 10%-85%.
Performance testing conducted under low humidity/ high temperature and vice versa
(In-use stability data) support this range.
Test strips were evaluated to determine open and closed vial stability. Data provided
by the sponsor supports closed vial stability of TD-4239 test strips for 18 months and
open vial stability of 3 months when stored at the recommended conditions of 2º -
32ºC / 35.6º - 89.6ºF, between 10%- 85% R.H.
Calibration: calibration of the test strip is done by inserting the code strip into the
meter when opening a new vial of test strips.

Monitoring System and 10-600 mg/dL for the TD-4239 Multi Blood Glucose
Monitoring System
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference Study:
The sponsor indicated that the interference study protocol was developed according to
NCCLS, EP 7-A2. Venous blood was obtained from fasting subjects and collected in
a heparin-Na (sodium heparin) vacutainer tube (Hct around 45%).
Two concentrations of glucose were adjusted to 60-80 mg/dL (low) and 150-200
mg/dL (high) using the YSI 2300 as a reference instrument. The glucose samples
were spiked with the potentially interfering compounds equivalent to the highest
therapeutic dosage and toxic level (or ten times the highest therapeutic concentrations
when toxic levels were not known), and tested on 3 lots of test strips. Bias was
calculated as the mean percent difference in glucose reading between the test and
control concentration groups. All samples tested showed % bias within ± 10%
between the test and the control groups. The sponsor claims no significant
interference (≤ 10% difference) for the substances and concentrations shown in the

Reference method comparison professional vs. Lay user comparison study for
Capillary Blood.
The sponsor states that the study was performed in accordance with ISO 15197.
Testing was completed by comparing the TD-4239 blood glucose monitoring systems
against YSI-2300 glucose analyzer (reference method) .The study was conducted at 3
different clinical sites, with a total of 148 subjects. Three lots of test strips were used
in the study.
Samples ranging from 15 to 527 mg/dL were included. The fresh capillary whole
blood samples from different individuals were used except for blood glucose
concentrations less than 40 mg/dL and greater than 400 mg/dL. (12/148) Pooled
capillary whole blood samples were spiked and glycolyzed to obtain these
concentrations.
Lay users were given the user manual in English for the blood glucose monitoring
systems TD-4239 and were given no additional instructions. They were requested to
perform the test by themselves and answer the questionnaire. Health care
professionals took one further measurement (immediately after) with the TD-4239,
and the results between the lay users vs. reference and health care professionals vs.
reference were compared. An additional capillary blood sample was taken within 5
minutes and was tested by professionals with the YSI 2300 blood glucose monitoring
system for comparison.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Altitude: A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of altitude on the TD 4239
16

--- Page 17 ---
BGMS. Same test samples were tested on 4 meters using venous whole blood from
healthy donors at eight glucose concentrations (ranging from 20-600mg/dL) at three
corresponding altitude levels (5000, 11,500, and 15,000 feet), and sea level (0 feet)
as a control. Testing was performed in a hyperbaric chamber (glove box). Each
venous blood sample was also tested by the YSI 2300 analyzer. The meter readings
obtained were compared to the YSI method and the percent bias was determined at
each level against the YSI results. Bias was within ± 10% for all three altitude levels
tested. Based on the data, the sponsor claims that the TD 4239 BMGS can be used at
altitude up to 15,000 feet.
2. Hematocrit: The sponsor performed hematocrit studies using eleven different
hematocrit levels (20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70%) levels across the
glucose measuring range (10-600 mg/dL). At each hematocrit level, 8 concentrations
of glucose were tested against the YSI method. Test strips from the same lot were
tested on 6 meters and the values were compared to the YSI method and the nominal
hematocrit level (40%). All results fell within ±10 mg/dL bias at glucose
concentrations < 75 mg/dL and within ±10% bias at glucose concentrations ≥ 75
mg/dL against the reference method YSI-2300. Across the entire hematocrit range (
20-70%) the difference between the candidate and YSI device is within +/- 15%.
3. Temperature and humidity study: The TD-4239 Blood Glucose Monitoring System,
operates at 50 -104 oF (10oC – 40oC), and relative humidity between 10%- 85%. The
sponsor tested the extreme combinations of temperature and humidity, i.e. lowest and
highest temp at lowest and highest humidity. These tests support the operating
temperature and humidity ranges.
4. Drop tests and vibration tests were conducted and results analyzed to give the mean,
SD and CV before and after the challenge. The sponsor provided the test report to
confirm that vibration tests were conducted on 3 meters at random wave form
between frequencies of 5- 500 Hz on X Y Z axes, 30 minutes per axis.
Results of TD-4239 showed CVs less than 5% at three glucose levels, and the mean
difference % before and after challenge were review were reviewed and deemed
acceptable.
5. Specimen volume study: A sample volume study was performed to verify the test
strip sample volume requirement and the test strip fill error requirement established
for the BGMS. Three lots of test strips were tested on Spiked or glycolized venous
whole blood (Hct: 45%) with three levels: 1) 33 to 63 mg/dL, 2) 117 to 175 mg/dL, 3)
250 to 376 mg/dL. Blood at each concentration was applied to strips at five target
sample volumes of 0.8, 0.9, 0.1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 µL. Protocols and acceptance criteria
were provided and found to be acceptable. The sponsor concluded that sample
volume of ≥0.9 µL produced accurate results and samples <0.9 µL give an error code.
6. Lay user questionnaire: 150 lay users evaluated the ease of use of the device and the
presentation of the labeling. All users thought that the device was easy to use (Very
17

--- Page 18 ---
easy; Easy and Average-100% lay users) and most answer Very easy, Easy and
Average that the user manuals were written to make it easy to use.
7. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing was performed and passed and a
certificate to Taidoc Technology Corporation was provided.
8. Readability testing: For the readability assessment of instruction manuals, the sponsor
used Flesch-Kincaid readability analysis to determine the grade level at which the
Owner’s Manual and strip manual for both proposed devices were written, for is 8th
grade reading level.
9. Disinfection and Robustness studies: The device is intended for single-patient (TD-
4239 Blood Glucose Monitoring System) or healthcare professional use (TD-4239
Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System). Disinfection studies were performed on
these meters by an outside commercial testing service to determine the robustness of
the meter to the recommended cleaning and disinfection protocol, and its
effectiveness in preventing the spread of blood borne pathogens, particularly Duck
hepatitis B virus (HBV). Micro-Kill Plus™ disposable wipes (EPA Reg. No:
59894-10-37549) were validated, demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus
for use with the meter. The sponsor also demonstrated that there was no change in
performance or in the external materials of the meter and lancing device after10,000
cleaning and disinfection cycles designed to simulate 3 years of healthcare
professional use and 5 years of use by lay users. Labeling has been reviewed for
adequate instructions in validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
