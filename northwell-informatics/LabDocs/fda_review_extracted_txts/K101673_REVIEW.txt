different colors on the reagent strip test area. This is done by irradiating the test area with light
and detecting the reflectance of different wavelengths using an integrated sphere photo-detector.
This photo-detector is filtered to measured wavelengths of 525nm, 550nm, 620nm, and 720nm
by the integrated sphere. Results are calculated by a reflection rate which is a percentage of the
total reflectance of the testing wavelength and are printed automatically.
The Uritek TC-101 reports semi-quantitative assay results for 10 urine analytes (glucose,
bilirubin, ketone, specific gravity, blood, pH, protein, urobilinogen, nitrite, and leukocytes).
Reagent strip results are automatically displayed on the screen in one minute. A printed
hardcopy can also be created either from the results screen or recalled from memory. The
analyzer features a display, internal printer, a serial computer interface and an electrical outlet.
Communication between the operator and the analyzer is made through the display using the
arrows and ‘yes’ or ‘no’ buttons on the front of the analyzer.
The Urine Reagent Strips (URS) 10 are urine test strips of which glucose, bilirubin, ketone,
specific gravity, blood, pH, protein, urobilinogen, nitrite, and leukocyte reagent pad are affixed
onto the firm plastic strips. The reagent pad areas are bibulous material saturated with chemically
active substances, then dried and affixed to the plastic strip with double-sided adhesive.

L. Test Principle:
Glucose: This test is based on a double sequential enzyme reaction. One enzyme, glucose
oxidase, catalyzes the reaction in which glucose is oxidized to produce gluconic acid and
hydrogen peroxide. A second enzyme, peroxidase, catalyzes the reaction of hydrogen peroxide
with potassium iodide chromogen in which the chromogen is oxidized to different colors
ranging from blue-green to greenish-brown through brown and dark brown.
Bilirubin: This test is based on the coupling of bilirubin with a diazotized dichloroaniline in a
strongly acid medium. Varying bilirubin levels will produce light tan to reddish-brown color
proportional to its concentration in urine.
Ketone: This test is based on the reaction of acetoacetic acid with sodium nitroprusside in a
strongly basic medium. The colors range from beige or buff-pink color for a “Negative” reading
to pink and pink-purple for a “Positive” reading.
Specific Gravity: This test is based on the apparent pKa change of certain pretreated
polyelectrolytes in relation to the ionic concentration. In the presence of an indicator, the colors
range from dark blue or blue-green in urine of low ionic concentration to green and yellow-green

in urine of higher ionic concentration.
Blood: This test is based on the pseudoperoxidase action of hemoglobin and erythrocytes which
catalyzes the reaction of 3,3’,5, 5’-tetramethyl-benzidine and buffered organic peroxide. The
resulting colors range from orange to yellow-green and dark green. Very high blood
concentration may cause the color development to continue to dark blue.
pH: This test is based on the well known double pH indicator method, where bromothymol blue
and methyl red give distinguishable colors over the pH range of 5-9. The colors range from red-
orange to yellow and yellow-green to blue-green.
Protein: This test is based on the protein error-of-indicator principle. At a constant pH, the
development of any green color is due to the presence of protein. Colors range from yellow for a
“Negative” reaction to yellow-green and green to blue-green for a “Positive” reaction.
Urobilinogen: This test is based on a modified Ehrlich reaction in which p-
diethylaminobenzaldehyde reacts with urobilinogen in a strongly acid medium. Colors range
from light pink to bright magenta.
Nitrite: This test depends on the conversion of nitrate to nitrite by the action of Gram-negative
bacteria in the urine. The nitrite reacts with p-arsanilic acid to from a diazonium compound in an
acid medium. The diazonium compound in turn couples with 1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo(h)
quinolin to produce a pink color.
Leukocytes: This test is based on the action of esterase present in leukocytes, which catalyzes
the hydrolysis of an indoxyl ester derivative. The indoxyl ester liberated reacts with a diazonium
salt to produce a beige-pink to purple color.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated at three point of care (POC) sites. Three (3) operators per site did
the testing on three (3) analyzers. A total of three (3) lots of URS-l0 strips were used and
three (3) levels of commercially available urine controls (at negative, low positive, and
medium to high positive) were analyzed. At each site, the controls were analyzed in
duplicate, twice a day for four (4) consecutive weeks (Monday through Friday) for a total
of twenty (20) days of testing.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The reportable range was evaluated in house using spiked samples to cover the reportable
range of each of the ten parameters. Samples were prepared such that the expected
concentrations corresponded to the color blocks for each assay. Fifteen (15) samples per
concentration level were tested on three (3) analyzers with three (3) lots of URS-10. All
results were an exact match to the expected concentration.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
No traceability was provided. The strips were previously cleared under k970250.
d. Detection limit:
A Detection Limit study was performed in house to evaluate the minimum sensitivity
level for each analyte on the URS-10 with the TC-101. Urine samples were spiked to
known concentrations of each analyte, in the same manner as the linearity controls.
These samples were then diluted to the lowest positive concentrations, or trace values,
that are indicated on the Teco color chart. For each analyte, aliquots of the lowest
positive concentrations were further diluted down to 75% (3:1) and 50% (1:1) with
negative urine. The minimum sensitivity level for each analyte on the URS-10 is defined
as the concentration level at which 50% of the results are positive for that concentration.
Each sample was tested 15 times a day over 3 days, for a total of forty-five (45) results
per sample. Three (3) lots of URS-10 were tested on three (3) analyzers with three (3)
operators.
The sponsor identified the sensitivity level for each analyte as follows:
Glucose 75 mg/dL
Bilirubin 0.75 mg/dL
Ketone 5 mg/dL
Blood 10 cells/ uL
Protein 11.25 mg/dL
Urobilinogen 0.2 EU/dL

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison was performed at three (3) Point-of-Care (POC) Sites
representing the intended users and intended use sites for this device. Three (3) operators
at each site analyzed the samples.
In order to have sufficient amount of samples at the high positive levels for every analyte,
spiked samples were included in the method comparison. Specifically, each POC site was
provided with twenty (20) spiked urine samples to make up sixty (60) spiked urine
samples in total. The spiked urine samples were kept frozen until testing. There were no
significant differences in performance between sites.

N. Instrument Name:
Uritek TC-101 Urine Analyzer
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Single or continuous testing mode
2. Software:
26

--- Page 27 ---
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this
line of product types:
Yes ____X____ or No _______
3. Specimen Identification:
A patient ID can be input manually at the time of analysis
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Single or continuous testing mode. Users must manually dip the urine reagent strip into the
urine sample, blot the strip lengthwise, and place the strip on the strip bed.
5. Calibration:
The Uritek TC-101 does not require daily calibration, as the instrument performs a system
calibration each time it is turned on. The white check strips included with the analyzer
provides the user the ability to check the performance of the analyzer compared to a set
standard.
6. Quality Control:
The package insert reads as follows: Quality control should be performed on the reagent
strips by testing known negative and positive commercially available controls. Two levels of
controls need to be analyzed after performing maintenance or service on the TC-101, with
each new shipment, each new lot, whenever a new bottle of test strips is first opened, and
every thirty days to check storage conditions. Water should not be used as a negative
control. Each laboratory should establish its own goals for adequate standards of
performance, and should perform quality control if there is a question about the performance
of the strips or the specimen handling. It is recommended that users follow federal, state and
local requirements for quality control testing.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
None
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
