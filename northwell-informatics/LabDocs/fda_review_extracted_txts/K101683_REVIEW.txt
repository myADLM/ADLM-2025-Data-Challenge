The INFINITI CYP2C19 Assay is indicated for use as an aid to clinicians in
determining therapeutic strategy for therapeutics that are metabolized by the
CYP450 2C19 gene product, specifically *2, *3, *17. The INFINITI CYP2C19
Assay is not intended to be used to predict drug response or non-response.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
The information provided from this test may supplement decision making and
should only be used in conjunction with routine monitoring by a physician.
Because of the variability in the knowledge of clinical utility with specific drugs
that are metabolized by CYP2C19, clinicians should use professional judgment in
the interpretation of results from this test. Results from this type of assay should
not be used in predicting a patient’s response to drugs for which the drug
metabolizing enzyme activity of that allele, or the drug metabolic pathway, has
not been clearly established.
4. Special instrument requirements:
AutoGenomics INFINITI Analyzer
I. Device Description:
The INFINITI CYP2C19 Assay is comprised of the R-Chip BioFilmChip Microarray,
the Intellipac Reagent Module, the PCR Amplification Mix and the GAP/Header CD.
The INFINITY CYP2C19 Assay is run on the AutoGenomics INFINITI Analyzer.
The BioFilmChip Microarray consists of a polyester film coated with proprietary
multi-layer components designed for DNA analysis. There can be up to 240 spots per
microarray with each spot representing a different allele. The microarrays are assay
specific.
The Intellipac Reagent Module which acts as a communication link, contains up to
four reservoirs that house the test reagents and has an integrated memory chip.
Information such as lot number, expiration date of reagents and number of tests are
archived in the memory chip.
The PCR Amplification Mix consists of the reagents needed for the PCR
amplification step of the assay.
The GAP/Header CD contains the assay protocol which specifies the assay steps,
parameters and conditions, and the assay Header which specifies the algorithm, assay
multipliers and ratios/cut-offs. The GAP/Header CD is loaded into the INFINITI
Analyzer.
The INFINITI Analyzer is an instrument used for clinical multiplex systems intended
to measure and sort multiple signals from a clinical sample. The INFINITI Analyzer
is designed to measure fluorescence signals of labeled DNA target hybridized to
2

--- Page 3 ---
BioFilmChip microarrays. The INFINITI Analyzer automates the INFINITI
CYP2C19 Assay and integrates all the discrete processes of sample (PCR amplicon)
handling, reagent management, hybridization, detection, and results analysis. The
assays are processed automatically and read by the built-in confocal microscope.
Results are analyzed and presented as genotype calls.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Site-to-site Study 1: In the first study performed to assess site-to-site
reproducibility, three clinical sites performed testing using four analyzers and
four operators. Three lots of reagents were used. All three sites tested the same
12 whole blood samples. Each site used a different DNA extraction method for
the clinical samples. During the initial run, the study gave a 96.5 % call rate
based on 415 correct calls out of a total of 430 genotype calls. There were 14
No Calls in the study, and one incorrect call. The data is summarized below:

f Samples with correct calls/samples tested
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls: Positive or negative controls are not included with this assay. The
manufacturer recommends that positive samples for each mutation
(heterozygous and/or homozygous), a negative control (a sample that does not
contain the mutations, i.e., a wild type sample) and a non-template-control be
included with each run. All quality control requirements and testing should be
performed in conformance with local, state and/or federal regulations.
Pre-immobilized negative and positive controls: These controls are related to
the hybridization process, and indicate that the hybridization has taken place.
There are five (5) negative control spots and three (3) positive control spots.
The negative control is a 3’biotinylated 24mer to which nothing should bind.
The positive control is a 3’biotinylated 24mer that hybridizes the
complementary Cy5 labeled oligonucleotide.
Reagent Stability: The sponsor states that the BioFilmChip Microarray is
stable for 12 months at 15 to 30 oC, the Intellipac Reagent is stable for 12
months when stored at 2 to 8oC, and the Amplification Mix is stable for 18
months when stored at -30 to -15 oC.

Sample Stability: The sponsor recommends that specimens (EDTA anti-
coagulated whole blood samples) be kept refrigerated (2°C to 8°C) and
extracted within 9 days from the day the specimen was collected. The
samples should not be frozen or thawed. Extracted DNA samples should be
kept refrigerated (2°C to 8°C) and assayed within 2 days from the day the
specimen was extracted.
d. Detection limit:
The upper and lower limits of detection of the assay were assessed by analysis
of whole blood samples (*1/*1, *1/*2, *1/*3, *1/*17, *2/*2 and *2/*17) at
serial dilutions of DNA concentrations in replicates of 20 or 40 to determine
the highest and lowest level of genomic DNA that would give a ≥ 90% correct
call rate with no incorrect calls. A total of 1,560 tests were completed. A ≥
90% correct call rate with no incorrect calls was obtained at DNA input levels
from 400ng/test to 20ng/test. There was one incorrect call at the 5ng DNA
input level. A *1/*3 sample was incorrectly called *3/*17. The results are

a Genotype determined by bi-directional sequencing; *1/*1 samples are wild-type for *2, *3 and *17
The sponsor states that the lower limit of detection for the assay is 20ng DNA
per test. The recommended DNA input is 50 ng per test and the maximum
recommended is 400 ng per test.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference from potential interfering substances was evaluated using eight
whole blood samples (two samples each with genotypes of *1/*1, *1/*2,
*1/*3, and *1/*17). The potential interfering substances were added
separately to the whole blood sample prior to DNA extraction and testing.
Genotype results were compared to those obtained from non-spiked samples.
The following compounds at the following concentrations were tested:
albumin at 6 g/dL, bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated) at 60 mg/dL, and
triglycerides (Intralipid) at 3000 mg/dL
Sample genotypes were verified by bi-directional DNA sequencing. All
samples gave the correct call. The sponsor concluded that the compounds do
not interfere with the performance of the assay.
Sample carry-over:
Four genomic DNA samples with different genotypes (*2/*3, *1/*2, *1/*17
and *1/*1) and water were used in this study. Four samples were tested in this
order: a high DNA concentration sample (300 ng), a low DNA concentration
sample (10 ng) of a different genotype, followed by the high DNA
concentration sample again, then a water blank. This protocol was run
multiple times, and in all cases, the correct call (or an indeterminate call for
the water ‘sample’) was obtained, illustrating no sample carry-over between
samples.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison study was completed at two external sites and
internally. All three sites compared the results of samples run on the proposed
device to bi-directional sequencing results (sequencing was completed at one
site). Each site tested its own clinical samples. Of the 317 samples tested, six
samples gave a No Call result for the initial testing. The results are

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The package insert states:
“CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3, which encode for non-functional proteins,
are responsible for the vast majority of poor metabolizer (PM) phenotypes.
The allele frequency of PM phenotype varies significantly between
populations, ranging from 2 to 5% in White and Black populations to 13-
23% in Asian populations.1
The frequency of the CYP2C19*17 allele is equally high (18%) in
Ethiopians and Swedes. A lower frequency has been reported in a Japanese
population (1.3%) and in Chinese subjects (4%). A study reported a
CYP2C19*17 allele frequency of 27% in a Polish population.” 2
