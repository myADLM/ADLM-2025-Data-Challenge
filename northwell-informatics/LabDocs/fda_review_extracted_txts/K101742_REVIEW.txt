2. Indication(s) for use:
The CEDIA® Cocaine OFT Assay is intended for use in the qualitative
determination of cocaine and cocaine metabolites at a cutoff concentration of 15
ng/mL in neat oral fluid. The specimen must be collected exclusively with the
Oral-Eze™ Saliva Collection System. The assay is calibrated against
benzoylecgonine and performed on the MGC 240. This in vitro diagnostic device
is intended for clinical laboratory use only.
The CEDIA® Cocaine OFT Assay provides only a preliminary analytical test
result. A more specific alternative method must be used to obtain a confirmed
analytical result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) and Liquid
Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) are the preferred
confirmatory methods. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should
be applied to any drug of abuse test result particularly when preliminary positive
results are used.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The CEDIA® Cocaine OFT Assay is for prescription professional use only in
clinical chemistry laboratories. It is not for use in Point of Care settings.
4. Special instrument requirements:
MGC 240 analyzer
I. Device Description:
The CEDIA® cocaine OFT Assay uses recombinant DNA technology to produce a
homogeneous enzyme immunoassay system. The assay is based on the bacterial
enzyme ß-galactosidase, which has been genetically engineered into two inactive
fragments (enzyme acceptor and enzyme donor). These fragments spontaneously re-
associate to form fully active enzyme that cleaves a substrate and then generates a
color change that can be measured spectrophotometrically.
The CEDIA® cocaine OFT Assay utilizes the Oral-Eze™ Saliva Collection System
consisting of the Oral-Eze™ saliva collector and collection tube with preservative
buffer. Oral-Eze™ saliva collector consists of an absorbent pad attached to a plastic
handle. The saliva collector is provided with a volume adequacy indicator. The
plastic handle has a round window where a blue color will appear when sufficient
volume of oral fluid is collected. Samples are collected by placing the collector pad
and plastic shield between the lower cheek and gum with the plastic shield facing the
cheek. The pad is ejected into the collection tube by placing thumb on the ridges on
the handle and pushing the thumb forward. The collection tube is capped and sent to
the laboratory for processing and testing.

CLSI Documents:

Guideline (EP09-A2)
L. Test Principle:
In the assay, analyte in the sample competes with analyte conjugated to one inactive
fragment of ß-galactosidase for antibody binding site. If analyte is present in the
sample, it binds to antibody, leaving the inactive enzyme fragments free to form
active enzyme. If analyte is not present in the sample, antibody binds to analyte
conjugated on the inactive fragment, inhibiting the reassociation of inactive ß-
galactosidase fragments, and no active enzyme is formed. The amount of active
enzyme formed and resultant absorbance change are directly proportional to the
amount of drug present in the sample.
The Oral-Eze Saliva Collection System contains a preservative buffer that dilutes the
neat oral fluid sample. The assay result is reported as a positive or negative result
relative to the neat oral fluid cutoff of 15 ng/mL.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Negative neat oral fluid samples were collected into a sample cup. Oral fluid
samples were spiked with benzoylecgonine at three times the final
concentration into negative neat oral fluid resulting in concentrations at -25%,
-50%, -75% below the cutoff, cutoff, and +25%, +50%, +75% and +100%
above the cutoff. All spiked neat oral fluid samples (3X) were confirmed by
LC-MS/MS. Neat oral fluid samples were applied onto the Oral-EZE
collection device pad (n=2 pad/level) until the blue color appeared in the
round (sample adequacy) window of the handle. The pads were then ejected
into vials containing 2.2 mL of the preservative buffer. All the diluted spiked
samples (1X) were then confirmed by LC-MS/MS. Samples were tested using
one lot of reagent on three different MGC 240 instruments by three different
operators. Five replicates of each sample were tested per run, 2 runs per day
for five non-consecutive days, with a total of N=50/level.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Collection device:
Shipment/Travel Stability:
Oral fluid samples were spiked with benzoylecgonine. Two sets of identical
spiked samples were prepared. One set was kept at room temperature in the
lab and used as the unshipped control. The other set was tested through three
different stress conditions simulating ground shipping, air shipping and
various climate conditions (desert, tropical). The shipping temperature should
not exceed >40ºC.
Sample Storage and Stability:
The stability of oral fluid samples in the preservative buffer was evaluated in
real time. The stability protocol was reviewed and found acceptable. Oral
fluid samples can be stored at 2-8º C or at room temperature (21-25°C) for 21
days.
Reagent Stability:
Real time stability testing was conducted. The stability protocol was reviewed
and found acceptable. The testing supports the stability at 2-8oC for 24
months. The on board stability of reconstituted reagents is 60 days (2-8oC).

d. Detection limit:
Sensitivity of this assay is characterized by validating performance around the
claimed cutoff concentration of the assay, including a determination of the
lowest concentration of drug that is capable of producing a positive result.
This information appears in the precision section 1.a., above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was established by spiking various concentrations of similarly
structured compounds into negative neat oral fluid samples. The
concentrations in the neat oral fluid were 3 times the final (1X) tested
concentration. These samples were applied onto the pad of the Oral-Eze
collection device until the blue color appeared in the round (sample adequacy)
window of the handle. The pads were then ejected into the vials containing
2.2 mL of the preservative buffer. The final concentrations of drug in the
samples were diluted to 1X concentration. The diluted samples were
qualitatively tested and the results were compared to the cutoff calibrator. All
compounds were tested in duplicate.
Specificity and Cross-Reactivity
Cross-reactivity was evaluated by spiking various concentrations (which could
be found in a neat oral fluid sample) of structurally related compounds into
drug-free neat oral fluid pool, than added to the oral fluid collection device.
The various concentrations were evaluated against the cutoff calibrator. The
table below lists the concentration of each compound that gave a response
approximately equal to the cutoff.
Compounds Tested Concentration in Response Equivalent to
Neat Oral Fluid (ng/mL) the cutoff
Cocaethylene 180 Positive
Cocaine 180 Positive
Ecgonine 2,550 Positive
Ecgonine methyl ester 34,500 Negative
Various over-the-counter medications and structurally unrelated compounds
were tested for cross-reactivity in the assay. Cross-reactant solutions were
prepared by adding the compound to neat oral fluid at the concentrations listed
in the table below. The neat oral fluid samples were processed using the Oral-
Eze device to obtain diluted oral fluid samples which were tested in the
CEDIA Cocaine OFT assay. All compounds tested negative and did not show
any cross-reactivity.
