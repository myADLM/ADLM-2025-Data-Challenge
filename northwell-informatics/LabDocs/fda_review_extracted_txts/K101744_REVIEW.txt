2. Indication(s) for use:
The CEDIA® Cannabinoids OFT Assay is intended for use in the qualitative
determination of Cannabinoids in human oral fluid at a cutoff concentration of 3.0
ng/mL in neat oral fluid. The specimen must be collected exclusively with the
Oral-Eze™ Saliva Collection System. The assay is calibrated against l-Δ9 THC
and performed on the MGC240. This in vitro diagnostic device is intended for
clinical laboratory use only.
The CEDIA® THC OFT Calibrators are intended for use in the calibration of l-Δ9
THC when used with the CEDIA® Cannabinoids OFT Assay. This in vitro
diagnostic device is intended for clinical laboratory use only.
The CEDIA® Cannabinoids OFT Assay provides only a preliminary analytical
test result. A more specific alternative method must be used to obtain a confirmed
analytical result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) and Liquid
Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) are the preferred
confirmatory methods. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should
be applied to any drug of abuse test result particularly when preliminary positive
results are used.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
This is an in vitro diagnostic device.
For prescription use
For use in the clinical laboratory
Not for use in the Point-of-Care settings
4. Special instrument requirements:
For use with the MGC240 analyzer
I. Device Description:
The assay consists of lyophilized reagent and liquid reconstitution Buffer. Reagent 1
(EA Reconstitution Buffer) contains buffer salts, rabbit monoclonal anti-THC
antibody, stabilizer and preservative, Reagent 1(a) (EA Reagent) contains Enzyme
Acceptor (microbial), buffer salts and preservative. Reagent 2 (ED Reconstitution
Buffer) contains buffer salts, stabilizers and preservative, Reagent 2(a) (ED Reagent)
contains Enzyme Donor (microbial) conjugated to cannabinoid derivative,
chlorophenol red-β-D-galactopytanoside, stabilizers, detergent and preservative.

The Oral-Eze Saliva Collection System consists of Oral-Eze saliva collector and
collection tube with preservative buffer. Oral-Eze saliva collector consists of an
absorbent pad attached to a plastic handle. The saliva collector is provided with a
volume adequacy indicator. The plastic handle has a round window where blue color
will appear when sufficient volume of oral fluid is collected. Samples are collected by
placing the collector pad and plastic shield between lower cheek and gum with the
plastic shield facing the cheek. Oral fluid collection is done when blue color appears
in the window of the handle. The pad is ejected in to the collection tube by placing
thumb on the ridges on the handle and pushing the thumb forward. The collection
tube is capped and sent to the laboratory for processing and testing.

L. Test Principle:
CEDIA Cannabinoids OFT Assay uses recombinant DNA technology to produce a
unique homogenous enzyme immunoassay system. The assay is based on the
bacterial enzyme β-galactosidase, which has been genetically engineered into two
inactive fragments. Analyte in the sample competes with analyte conjugates to one
inactive fragment (enzyme donor) of β-galactosidase for antibody binding site. The
amount of active enzyme formed (color change) is measured spectrophotometrically
at 570 nm which is directly proportional to the amount of analyte present in the
sample.
The Oral-Eze Saliva Collection System contains a preservative buffer that dilutes the
neat oral fluid sample. The calibrator levels are set at diluted levels so that sample
absorbance values can be compared directly to the absorbance values of the
calibration curve. The assay result is reported as a positive or negative result relative
to the neat oral fluid cutoff of 3.0 ng/mL.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All analytical performance data was collected on neat human oral fluid
samples and processed through the Oral-Eze Saliva Collection System and
analyzed on the MGC 240 instrument. The Oral-Eze collection device
includes a diluent that results in a dilution of approximately 1/3. The assay
cannot be used to measure undiluted (neat) samples. Analyte concentrations
refer to the neat oral fluid concentration, unless otherwise noted.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed by spiking an l-isomer-Δ9 THC solution into
neat oral fluid pools at concentrations of 0, 0.75, 1.50, 2.25, 3.00, 3.75, 4.50,
5.25 and 6.00 ng/mL. Concentrations were confirmed by LC-MS/MS. Each
sample was then processed through the Oral-Eze Saliva Collection system to
obtain a final concentration at approximately negative, -75%, -50%, -25%,
cutoff, +25% and 50%, 75% and 100% of the calibrator cutoff. Testing was
performed in replicates of 5, twice a day over 5 non-consecutive days for all
concentrations. The results are presented in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable, this is a qualitative assay
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrator:
Traceability:
Calibrators are specified in the labeling but are supplied separately from the
reagents. Calibrators consist of a synthetic oral fluid matrix spiked with
known concentrations of l-isomer-Δ9THC.
The concentration of l-isomer-Δ9THC in the calibrators is verified by
LC/MS/MS.
Stability:
Real-time Stability studies were conducted on two lots of calibrators. The
stability protocol was reviewed and found acceptable. The testing supports the
stability at 2-8oC for 18 months. The open vial stability of reconstituted
reagents is 50 days (2-8oC).
Shipment Stability:
Conditions simulating ground shipping, air shipping and various climate
conditions (desert, tropical) were tested. Oral fluid samples were spiked with
l-isomer-Δ9THC to concentrations of -50% of the cutoff and +50% of the
cutoff. One set was stored at room temperature and used as the control, while
the other set was used for testing. All samples at -50% of the cutoff recovered
as negative and all samples at +50% of the cutoff recovered as positive. The
shipping temperature should not exceed >40ºC.

Sample Storage and Stability:
The stability of oral fluid samples in the preservative buffer was evaluated in
real time. The stability protocol was reviewed and found acceptable. Oral
fluid samples can be stored at 2-8º C or at room temperature (21-25°C) for 21
days.
Reagent Stability:
Real time stability testing was conducted. The stability protocol was reviewed
and found acceptable. The testing supports the stability at 2-8oC for 24
months. The on board stability of reconstituted reagents is 60 days (2-8oC).
d. Detection limit:
Analytical performance of the device around the cutoff is described in the
precision section 1.a above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was evaluated by spiking various concentrations (which could
be found in a neat oral fluid sample) of structurally related compounds into
drug-free neat oral fluid pool, than added to the oral fluid collection device.
The various concentrations were evaluated against the cutoff calibrator. The
table below lists the concentration of each compound that gave a response
approximately equal to the cutoff.
Compound Tested Concentration Response
(ng/mL) equivalent to cutoff
l-11-nor-Δ9 THC-COOH 3.0 Positive
11-OH-Δ9 THC 3.75 Positive
Δ8 THC 3.75 Positive
Cannabinol 12 Positive
Cannabidiol 3000 Positive
Potential interference from structurally unrelated compounds and various
common over-the-counter medications were tested by spiking the potentially
interfering compound into neat oral fluid, and then processed through the oral
fluid collection device.
