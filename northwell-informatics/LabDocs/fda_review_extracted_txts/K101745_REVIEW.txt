H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indication(s) for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The CEDIA Amphetamine OFT Assay is intended for use in the qualitative
determination of amphetamine in human oral fluid at a cutoff concentration of
150 ng/mL in neat oral fluid. The specimen must be collected exclusively with the
Oral-Eze Saliva Collection System. The assay is calibrated against d-
amphetamine and performed on the MGC 240. This in vitro diagnostic device is
intended for clinical laboratory use only.
The CEDIA Amphetamine OFT Assay provides only a preliminary analytical test
result. A more specific alternative method must be used to obtain a confirmed
analytical result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) and Liquid
Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) are the preferred
confirmatory methods. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should
be applied to any drug of abuse test result particularly when preliminary positive
results are used.

handle with a sample adequacy window
2 Oral Fluid collection vial containing a buffer preservative solution
3 Plastic plunger
The CEDIA OFT Multi-Drug Calibrators (Three Levels: 0, 50 and 200 ng/mL) and
Multi-Drug Controls (Two Levels: 25 and 75 ng/mL) are sold separately and were
cleared under pre-market submission k101752.
Oral-Eze Saliva Collection System
The Oral-Eze Saliva Collection System consists of Oral-Eze saliva collector and
collection tube with preservative buffer. Oral-Eze saliva collector consists of an
absorbent pad attached to a plastic handle. The saliva collector is provided with a
volume adequacy indicator. The plastic handle has a round window where blue color
will appear when sufficient volume of oral fluid is collected. Samples are collected by
placing the collector pad and plastic shield between lower cheek and gum with the
plastic shield facing the cheek. Oral fluid collection is done when blue color appears
in the window of the handle. The pad is ejected in to the collection tube by placing
thumb on the ridges on the handle and pushing the thumb forward. The collection
tube is capped and sent to the laboratory for processing and testing.

L. Test Principle:
Principle of Amphetamine OFT Assay
Enzyme fragment complementation assays are based on competition between
amphetamine in the sample and labeled-amphetamine for a fixed amount of antibody
in the reagent. The presence of amphetamine in saliva sample facilitates the
association of two inactive β-galactosidase enzyme fragments into an active enzyme
complex that hydrolyzes a substrate, generating a color change that can be measured
spectrophotometrically.
Specifically, amphetamine in the saliva sample competes with amphetamine
conjugated to one inactive fragment of β-galactosidase for antibody binding site. If
amphetamine is present in the saliva sample, it binds to antibody, leaving the inactive
enzyme fragments free to form active enzyme. If amphetamine is not present in the
saliva sample, antibody binds to amphetamine conjugated on the inactive fragment,
inhibiting the reassociation of inactive β-galactosidase fragments, and no active
enzyme complex is formed. The amount of active enzyme formed and resultant
absorbance change are directly proportional to the amount of amphetamine present in
the sample.
The Oral-Eze Saliva Collection System contains a preservative buffer that dilutes the
neat oral fluid sample. The assay result is reported as a positive or negative result
relative to the neat oral fluid cutoff of 150 ng/mL.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor conducted a precision study on the MGC 240 analyzer using
negative neat oral fluid samples collected and then prepared by spiking
amphetamine at zero drug (-100%), -75%, -50%, -25%, below the cutoff, at
the cutoff, and +25%, +50%, +75% and +100% above the cutoff. All spiked
neat oral fluid sample concentrations were confirmed by LC-MS/MS. The
neat oral fluid samples were then processed using the Oral-Eze device to
obtain diluted oral fluid samples. The diluted oral fluid samples were
confirmed by LC-MS/MS and tested in the CEDIA Amphetamine OFT Assay
in qualitative mode.
The randomized CLSI (EP5-A2) precision protocol was followed with five
5

replicates of each sample for each run, 2 runs per day for five non-consecutive
days, total n= 50 per level. Results of the studies are presented below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The stability of the reagents stored at 2-8oC was evaluated by real time testing
at regular time intervals (0,3,6,9,12,18 and 24 months) during a 2 year period.
Based upon the results of the study, the sponsor claims a 24 month shelf life
for the reagents.
The stability of oral fluid samples in Oral-Eze collection devices, stored at
either 2-8oC or 21-25oC, was evaluated at 7 day intervals during a 21 day
period by LC-MS/MS. Based upon the results of the study; the sponsor claims
that oral fluid samples can be stored for 21 days at either 2-8oC or 21-25oC.
The shipping stability of amphetamine-spiked oral fluid samples in Oral-Eze
collection devices was evaluated during a 24 hour period. The shipping
conditions evaluated included simulated 14,000 feet altitude and a variety of
temperature, humidity, mechanical and vibration stress conditions. Based
upon the results of the study, the sponsor claims that oral fluid samples
collected with the Oral-Eze collection devices are stable during shipping.

e. Analytical specificity:
Compounds used in over-the-counter cold medicines and other compounds
that are structurally related (which could be found in a neat oral fluid sample)
to amphetamine were tested for cross-reactivity in the assay. The stock
solution of each cross-reactant compound was prepared and added to negative
oral fluid pool at the listed concentration. The neat oral fluid samples were
then processed using the Oral-Eze device. The table below lists the

f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of the analytical performance around the 150 ng/ml cutoff
range for neat oral fluid was evaluated in the precision study. See M.1.a.
above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Two method comparison studies were performed. In the first study, forty-two
unaltered neat oral fluid samples (21 negative and 21 positive samples) were
analyzed. In order to evaluate the performance of the entire system, three
measurements were taken on each specimen: the LC/MS/MS concentration of
the neat sample, the LC/MS/MS concentration of the diluted oral fluid sample
collected with Oral-Eze device, and the immunoassay concentration (CEDIA
Amphetamine OFT Assay on the MGC 240 analyzer) of the diluted oral fluid
sample collected with Oral-Eze device. The results of the studies are presented
below.

LC/MS/MS values used to categorize samples in this table are based on the
concentration of found in neat oral fluid. The overall concordance between the
CEDIA Amphetamine OFT Assay and LC-MS/MS using a cutoff 150 ng/mL
in neat oral fluid is 100.0%. The comparison of sample results by the CEDIA
Amphetamine OFT Assay to LC-MS/MS showed 100.0% sensitivity and
100.0% specificity.
In the second study, eighty-one unaltered neat oral fluid samples (40 negative
and 41 positive samples) were analyzed. This study was performed on
samples already collected with the Oral-Eze collection device. When the
LC/MS/MS values of the diluted samples were compared to the immunoassay
values, the following results were obtained. Therefore the results below do not
reflect any inaccuracy inherent in the collection process itself.

The overall concordance between the CEDIA Amphetamine OFT Assay and
LC-MS/MS is 98.8%. The comparison of sample results by the CEDIA
Amphetamine OFT Assay to LC-MS/MS showed 97.6% sensitivity and
100.0% specificity.
