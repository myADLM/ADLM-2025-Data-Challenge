human Oral Fluid when used with the CEDIA Amphetamine, Cocaine, Opiate,
and Phencyclidine (PCP) OFT Assays on the MGC 240 analyzer. This in vitro
diagnostic device is intended for clinical laboratory use only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For in vitro diagnostic use
For prescription use
4. Special instrument requirements:
For use with CEDIA® Amphetamine, Cocaine, Opiate, and Phencyclidine (PCP)
OFT Assays on the MGC240 analyzer
I. Device Description:
The CEDIA® Multi-Drug OFT Calibrators are liquid ready-to-use solutions prepared
by spiking known quantities of Amphetamine, Benzoylecgonine, Morphine, and PCP
into buffer matrix. The CEDIA® Multi-Drug OFT Calibrators consists of 3 calibrator
levels: Negative Calibrator, Cutoff Calibrator, and High Calibrator. The Cutoff
Calibrator is used as a qualitative cutoff reference for distinguishing “positive” from
“negative” samples. The volume per vial is 20.0 mL for the Negative Calibrator and
10.0 mL for the Cutoff and High Calibrator. Amphetamine, Benzoylecgonine,
Morphine, and PCP are value assigned for use with CEDIA® OFT Assays. The
Negative Calibrator is free of analyte.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The sponsor claims traceability to all measurands in the calibrator
(amphetamine, benzoylecgonine, morphine, phencyclidine) to a commercially
available methanolic standard.
Stability
Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to
be acceptable. Stability characteristics of the CEDIA® Multi-Drug OFT
Calibrators were determined using accelerated and real time closed (un-
opened) vial, as well as real-time opened vial studies. A closed vial shelf-life
of 16 months at the recommended storage temperature (2°C to 8°C) was
demonstrated based on real-time studies. Open vial stability of 60 days was
also demonstrated at the recommended storage temperature (2°C to 8°C). The
closed vial shelf-life and open vial expiration dates are listed on the box and
vial labels. In the package insert, the user is directed to check the expiration
dates indicated on the box label. The recommendations in the labeling are to
store calibrators at 2°C to 8°C.
Value Assignment and Validation
Nominal values are assigned to production lots using Liquid Chromatography
with tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The table below shows the
measurand values contained in each level of calibrator materials. These values
are also provided in the labeling.
Analyte Negative Cutoff High Calibrator
Calibrator Calibrator (ng/mL)
(ng/mL) (ng/mL)
Amphetamine 0.0 50.0 200.0
Benzoylecgonine 0.0 5.0 50.0
Morphine 0.0 10.0 80.0
Phencyclidine 0.0 1.0 20.0
Three lots of each level of calibrator was validated using the CEDIA® Multi-
Drug OFT Assays, a reference set of calibrators, and two MGC 240 Benchtop
Clinical Chemistry Analyzers set to qualitative mode. The validation protocol,
acceptance criteria, and data were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
