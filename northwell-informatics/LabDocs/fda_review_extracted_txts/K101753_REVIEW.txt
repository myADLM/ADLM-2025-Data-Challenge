2. Indication(s) for use:
The CEDIA® Methamphetamine OFT Assay is intended for use in the qualitative
detection of methamphetamine at a cutoff concentration of 120.0 ng/mL in neat
oral fluid. The specimen must be collected exclusively with the Oral-Eze™ Saliva
Collection System. The assay is calibrated against d-methamphetamine and
performed on the MGC 240. This in vitro diagnostic device is intended for
clinical laboratory use only.
The CEDIA Methamphetamine OFT Calibrators are intended for use in the
calibration of d- Methamphetamine when used with the CEDIA
Methamphetamine OFT Assay for human oral fluid samples collected with the
Oral-Eze™ Saliva Collection System. This in vitro diagnostic device is intended
for clinical laboratory use only.
The CEDIA Methamphetamine OFT Assay provides only a preliminary analytical
test result. A more specific alternative method must be used to obtain a confirmed
analytical result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) and Liquid
Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) are the preferred
confirmatory methods. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should
be applied to any drug of abuse test result particularly when preliminary positive
results are used.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only in clinical chemistry laboratories.
It is not for use in Point of Care settings.
4. Special instrument requirements:
MGC 240 Analyzer
I. Device Description:
CEDIA® Methamphetamine OFT Assay
The CEDIA® Methamphetamine OFT Assay uses recombinant DNA technology to
produce a unique homogeneous enzyme immunoassay system. The assay is based on
the bacterial enzyme β-galactosidase, which has been genetically engineered into two
inactive fragments i.e., enzyme acceptor (EA) and enzyme donor (ED). These
fragments spontaneously re-associate to form fully active enzyme that, in the assay
format, cleaves a substrate, generating a color change that can be measured
spectrophotometrically. In the assay, analyte in the sample competes with analyte
conjugated to one inactive fragment of β-galactosidase for antibody binding site. If
2

--- Page 3 ---
analyte is present in the sample, it binds to antibody, leaving the inactive enzyme
Fragments free to form active enzyme.
If analyte is not present in the sample, antibody binds to analyte conjugated on the
inactive fragment, inhibiting the re-association of inactive β-galactosidase fragments,
and no active enzyme is formed. The amount of active enzyme formed and resultant
absorbance change are directly proportional to the amount of drug present in the
sample.
The CEDIA® Methamphetamine OFT Assay consists of separately packaged
reagents (R1, R1a, R2, and R2a):

antibody in the reagent. The presence of Methamphetamine in saliva sample
facilitates the association of two inactive β-galactosidase enzyme fragments into an
active enzyme complex that hydrolyzes a substrate, generating a color change that
can be measured spectrophotometrically.
Specifically, methamphetamine in the saliva sample competes with
Methamphetamine conjugated to one inactive fragment of β-galactosidase for
antibody binding site. If methamphetamine is present in the saliva sample, it binds to
antibody, leaving the inactive enzyme fragments free to form active enzyme. If
Methamphetamine is not present in the saliva sample, antibody binds to
methamphetamine conjugated on the inactive fragment, inhibiting the re-association
of inactive β-galactosidase fragments, and no active enzyme complex is formed. The
amount of active enzyme formed and resultant absorbance change are directly
proportional to the amount of Methamphetamine present in the sample.
The calibrator is set at diluted levels so that sample absorbance values can be
compared directly to the absorbance values of the calibration curve. The assay result
is reported as a positive or negative result relative to the neat oral fluid cutoff of 120.0
ng/mL.
Principle of Oral-Eze Saliva Collection System
The Oral-Eze Saliva Collection System contains a preservative buffer that dilutes the
neat oral fluid sample. The calibrator levels are set at diluted levels so that sample
absorbance values can be compared directly to the absorbance values of the
calibration curve. The assay result is reported as a positive or negative result relative
to the neat oral fluid cutoff of 120 ng/mL.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All analytical performance data was collected on neat human oral fluid samples
and processed through the Oral-Eze Saliva Collection System and analyzed on the
MGC 240 instrument. The Oral-Eze collection device includes a diluent that
results in a dilution of approximately 1/3. The assay cannot be used to measure
undiluted (neat) samples. Analyte concentrations refer to the neat oral fluid
concentration, unless otherwise noted.
a. Precision and Reproducibility
Negative neat oral fluid samples were collected and then prepared by spiking
methamphetamine at negative, -75%, -50%, -25%, below the cutoff, at the
cutoff, and +25%, +50%, +75% and +100% above the cutoff. All spiked neat
oral fluid sample concentrations were confirmed by LC-MS/MS. The neat oral
fluid samples were processed using the Oral-Eze device to obtain diluted oral
fluid samples. The diluted oral fluid samples were confirmed by LC-MS/MS

Shipping stability studies
Sample shipment/travel stability:
Conditions simulating ground shipping, air shipping and various climate
conditions (desert, tropical) were tested. Samples spiked at concentrations
below the cutoff (-50%) recovered as negative for both the control and
shipped samples. Samples spiked at concentrations above the cutoff (+50%)
recovered as positive for both the control and shipped samples. The shipping
temperature should not exceed >40ºC.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical performance of the device around the cutoff is described in the
precision section 1.a above.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed analytical specificity studies on four categories of
potential interferents: structurally related substances, structurally unrelated
substances, substances endogenous to oral fluid, and food and dental
substances.
Cross Reactivity to Structurally Related Compounds
Cross-reactivity was evaluated by spiking various concentrations (which could
be found in a neat oral fluid sample) of structurally related compounds into
drug-free neat oral fluid pool, than added to the oral fluid collection device.
By analyzing various concentration of each compound the sponsor determined
the concentration of the drug that produced a response approximately equal to
the cutoff. Results of those studies appear in the table below.

f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed
cutoff concentration appears in the precision above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison:
Two separate studies were conducted. In the first study, MAMP was spiked in
to samples that had already been collected through the intercept device. In the
second study samples were spiked with MAMP prior to the collection step to
reflect the operation of the entire system.
Study 1:
41 unaltered clinical samples were tested in the CEDIA Methamphetamine
OFT Assay in qualitative mode. The results were compared to GC/MS results.
All samples were confirmed by GC/MS.
Note: The values obtained in this study were collected from samples spiked
with MAMP prior to the collection step. Therefore the results reflect the
performance of the entire system including the collection step.

% Agreement among positive and negative is 100%.
LC/MS/MS values used to categorize samples in this table are based on the
concentration found in the neat oral fluid sample.
Study 2: Eighty one unaltered clinical samples were tested in the CEDIA
Methamphetamine OFT Assay in qualitative mode. The results were compared to
GC/MS results. All samples were confirmed by GC/MS.
Note: this study was performed on samples already collected with the Intercept
collection device. Therefore the results below do not reflect any inaccuracy
inherent in the collection process itself.
