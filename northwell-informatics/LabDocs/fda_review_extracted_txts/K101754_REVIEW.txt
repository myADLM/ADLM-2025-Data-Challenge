H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The CEDIA® Opiate OFT Assay is intended for use in the qualitative
determination of opiates at a cutoff of 30.0 ng/mL in neat oral fluid. The specimen
must be collected exclusively with the Oral-Eze™ Saliva Collection System. The
assay is calibrated against morphine and performed on the MGC 240. This in vitro
diagnostic device is intended for clinical laboratory use only.
The CEDIA Opiate OFT Assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result.
A more specific alternative method must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical
result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) and Liquid
Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) are the preferred
confirmatory methods. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should
be applied to any drug of abuse test result particularly when preliminary positive
results are used.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
The assay is not designated for use in point-of-care settings.
4. Special instrument requirements:
MGC 240 analyzer
I. Device Description:
Oral-Eze Saliva Collection System
The Oral-Eze Saliva Collection System consists of Oral-Eze saliva collector and
collection tube with preservative buffer. Oral-Eze saliva collector consists of an
absorbent pad attached to a plastic handle. The saliva collector is provided with a
volume adequacy indicator. The plastic handle has a round window where blue color
will appear when sufficient volume of oral fluid is collected. Samples are collected by
placing the collector pad and plastic shield between lower cheek and gum with the
plastic shield facing the cheek. Oral fluid collection is done when blue color appears
in the window of the handle. The pad is ejected in to the collection tube by placing
thumb on the ridges on the handle and pushing the thumb forward. The collection
tube is capped and sent to the laboratory for processing and testing

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

L. Test Principle:
Microgenics CEDIA® Opiate OFT Assay uses recombinant DNA technology to
produce a unique homogeneous enzyme immunoassay system. The assay is based on
the bacterial enzyme ß-galactosidase, which has been genetically engineered into two
inactive fragments. These fragments spontaneously re-associate to form fully active
enzyme that, in the assay format, cleave a substrate, generating a color change that
can be measured spectrophotometrically.
In the assay, analyte in the sample competes with analyte conjugated to one inactive
fragment (enzyme donor) of ß-galactosidase for antibody binding site. If analyte is
present in the sample, it binds to antibody, leaving the inactive enzyme fragment free
to form active enzyme. If the analyte is not present in the sample, antibody binds to
analyte conjugated on the inactive fragment, inhibiting the re-association of inactive ß
-galactosidase fragments, and no active enzyme is formed. The amount of active
enzyme formed and resultant absorbance change are directly proportional to the
amount of analyte present in the sample.
The Oral-Eze Saliva Collection System consists of Oral-Eze saliva collector and
collection tube with preservative buffer. Oral-Eze saliva collector consists of an
absorbent pad attached to a plastic handle. The saliva collector is provided with a
volume adequacy indicator. The assay result is reported as a positive or negative
result relative to the neat oral fluid cutoff of 30 ng/mL
.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All analytical performance data was collected on human oral fluid samples
collected with the Oral-Eze Saliva Collection System and analyzed on the MGC
240 analyzer. The collection device includes a diluent that results in a dilution of
approximately 1/3. The assay cannot be used to measure undiluted (neat)

samples. Analyte concentrations refer to the neat oral fluid concentration, unless
otherwise noted.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Negative neat oral fluid samples were collected by spitting into a cup. Testing
samples were prepared by spiking morphine into the negative neat oral fluid.
The samples were applied onto the pad of Oral-Eze collection device (n=2
pad/level) and eluted following the instruction menu. Precision were evaluated
following randomized CLSI (EP5-A2) precision protocol as in study 1.
Note: The values obtained in this study were collected from samples
containing opiates prior to the collection step. Therefore the results reflect the
performance of the entire system including the collection step.
The results are summarized in the table below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
See k101752 decision summary for information on calibrators.
Reagent stability:
Real time testing is on-going to support the product shelf life of 3 years. The
stability protocol was reviewed and found acceptable. The current test results
support the stability at 2-8oC for 24 months. The on board stability of
reconstituted reagents is 60 days (2-8oC).

The stability of oral fluid samples in the preservative buffer was evaluated in
real time. The stability protocol was reviewed and found acceptable. Oral
fluid samples in the preservative buffer can be stored at 2-8º C or at room
temperature (21-25°C) for 21 days.
Sample shipment/travel stability:
Conditions simulating ground shipping, air shipping and various climate
conditions (desert, tropical) were tested. Neat samples spiked at
concentrations below the cutoff recovered as negative for both the control and
shipped samples. Samples spiked at concentrations above the cutoff recovered
as positive for both the control and shipped samples.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical performance of the device around the cutoff is described in the
precision section 1.a above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity:
Pooled neat drug-free oral fluid samples were collected by spitting into a cup.
The cross-reactant solutions were prepared by adding the compounds to neat
oral fluid samples at the concentration listed in the table below. The neat oral
fluid samples were processed using the Oral-Eze device to obtain diluted oral
fluid samples which were tested in the CEDIA Opiate OFT Assay. The table
below lists the concentrations of each compound that gave a response
approximately equal to the cutoff.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Study 1:
Eighty two unaltered neat oral fluid samples were processed using the Oral-
Eze collection device. The diluted oral fluid samples after passing the
collection device were tested by the CEDIA Opiate OFT Assay and by the
GC-MS method.
Note: this study was performed on samples already collected with the
Intercept collection device. When the GC-MS values of the diluted samples
were compared to the immunoassay values, the following results were
obtained. Therefore the results below do not reflect any inaccuracy inherent in
the collection process itself.

LC-MS/MS method while only the diluted samples were tested in the CEDIA
