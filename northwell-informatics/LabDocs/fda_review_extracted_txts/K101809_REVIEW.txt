Accelerated stability & Real time Stability:
Two lots of lyophilized Fujirebio Diagnostics Tumor Marker Controls were
tested. The vials were stored at 2-8°C (reference), ambient temperature (room
temperature) and 37°C. The test and reference were reconstituted and run in
duplicate at different time points and compared.
Real-time stability study is ongoing. The shelf life stability is based on the
accelerated stability study and the real-time stability studies done so far.

The claimed shelf life stability is 18 months at 2°C to 8°C.
Open bottle stability at 2-8°: Two lots of Fujirebio Diagnostics Tumor
Marker Controls were used for the study. Reconstituted vials are stored at 2-
8°C (test). Lyophilized vials are stored at 2-8°C (reference). The test and
reference (after reconstitution) were run in duplicate at the following time
points: day 3, 8, 15, and 30 and compared. The claimed stability, once the
control is reconstituted, is 14 days when stored tightly capped at 2-8°C with
the following exception: Free PSA is stable for 7 days.
Open bottle stability at ≤ -20°C :
Two lots of Fujirebio Diagnostics Tumor Markers were used for the study.
Reconstituted vials are stored at ≤ -20°C (test). Lyophilized vials are stored at
2-8°C (reference). The test and reference (after reconstitution) were run in
duplicate at day 30 and 61 and compared. The claimed open vial stability is
for 60 days when stored at ≤ -20°C after reconstitution.
Freeze / Thaw Stability study:
Vials were reconstituted at the start of the study and then frozen and thawed
without opening the vial between the freeze/thaw cycles. The sponsor claims
that controls may be frozen and thawed repeatedly for up to 9 cycles.
Transport Stability Simulation Study – Lyophilized: Transport stability study
is currently ongoing.
Expected/assigned values:
Value assignments for each lot are performed by independent manufacturers
of laboratory tests and CAP and/or CLIA certified laboratories. Mean values
for each level of each analyte on each analyzer/manual method are determined
by running a minimum of 20 replicates. It is recommended that each
laboratory establish its own means and acceptable ranges and use the printed
ranges as guidance only. Values and ranges are lot specific.
