The iChem® VELOCITY ™ is an automatic chemistry system performing measurements of
urine and chemical constituents utilizing test strips read by wavelength reflectance and
specific gravity using the refractive index.
Reflectance photometry analyzes the intensity and color of light reflected from the reagent
areas of a urinalysis test strip. Using three LEDs and one black and white complementary
metal oxide semiconductor camera (CMOS), the optical system reads the color change in the
urine strips after a sample is applied.

--- Page 6 ---
The measurement of the ten analytes on the iChem® VELOCITY™ chemistry strip is based
on optical measurement of percent reflectance of visible light flashed on reagent pads that
undergo a color development reaction proportional to the analyte concentration. The sensor is
a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) digital camera assembly.
Glucose-Two step enzymatic reaction using glucose oxidase, peroxidase and a chromogen.
Glucose oxidase catalyzes the formation of gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide via the
oxidation of glucose. Peroxidase then catalyzes the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with a
chromogen via the oxidation of chromogen to colors ranging between green to gray-blue.
Occult Blood-pseudo-enzymatic test containing organic peroxide and a chromogen. The
peroxidase effect of hemoglobin and myoglobin causes a color change to green.
Urobilinogen- based on the coupling reaction of urobilinogen with a stable diazonium salt in
buffer. A pink to red color proportional to the urobilinogen concentration is generated.
pH- this test contains a mixed indicator which assures a marked change in color between pH
5 and pH 9.
Nitrite-This test is based on modified Griess reaction in which Nitrite in the urine reacts with
amide to form a diazonium compound. The subsequent coupling reaction yields a pink color
in the presence of nitrite.
Specific Gravity- Specific gravity is physically determined by refractometry in the urine
chemistry system and is not analyzed by strip chemistry.
Leukocyte Peroxidase - enzymatic test pad containing an indoxyl ester and a diazonium salt.
Granulocyte esterases react with indoxyl ester and diazonium salt to generate a violet color.
Ascorbic Acid-This test is based on Tilman’s reaction in which the presence of ascorbic acid
leads to the decolorization of the test pad from gray-blue to orange.
Ketones-based on Legal’s method in which the test pad contains sodium nitroprusside and
glycine in an alkaline medium. A violet color proportional to methylketone is generated.
Protein- based on the “protein error” of pH indicators on the green color developed from the
presence of protein.
Bilirubin- based on the coupling of bilirubin with diazonium salt in an acidic medium. A
pinkish tan color proportional to bilirubin concentration is generated.

--- Page 7 ---
Repeatability (within run and day-to-day) precision of the iChem VELOCITY
automated urine chemistry system was evaluated using a negative urine pool which
was spiked at the lowest positive level and the highest positive level. Three replicate
tubes of each level (negative, low positive, and high positive) were analyzed on three
iChem Velocity analyzers with three lots of iChem VELOCITY Urine Chemistry
Strips for 20 non-consecutive runs/days. The within-run precision is calculated as an
average direct agreement for the 20 runs over the 3 replicate for all instruments and
strip lots. The day-to-day precision is calculated as an average direct agreement of all
20 1st replicates of each run for all instruments and strip lots. All concentrations for
all tests had 100% agreement at +/- one color block.
Example: 3 replicates (1 negative sample + 2 positive samples) x 3 instruments x 3
strip lots x 20 runs = 540 replicates

of 1 year when stored at 18˚C to 25˚C (65˚F-77˚F).
Value Assignment
SG Color Cal Cheks- NaCl and/or Glycerol are added gravimetrically to deionized
water to obtain values that span the range of the assay on the instrument. Comparison
testing was performed on three lots of proposed CalChek control material and
compared with human urine spiked with NaCl. Testing was performed in triplicate on
the iChem ®VELOCITY™. No significant measurement differences were found.
SG Color Cal Cheks- varying amounts of food color are blending to achieve desired
shades of colorless, straw, normal yellow and amber. The correct color absorbance
values are verified by a spectrophotometer at 450, 550, and 650 nm.
Clarity CalCheks-varying amounts of food coloring and AMCO® turbidity
standards are added to deionized water to achieve the desired clarity of slightly
cloudy, cloudy and turbid. The achieved clarity is verified by nephlometric turbidity
units obtained from a turbidity meter.
An example of the CalChek reagent values are as follows:
CalChek# CalChek Name
1 SG 1.002
2 SG 1.030
3 SG 1.060
4 Colorless
5 Straw
6 Yellow
7 Amber
8 Slightly-Cloudy
9 Cloudy
10 Turbid
d. Detection limit:
The sensitivity of the iChem® VELOCITY™ Urine Chemistry Strips was evaluated
by spiking negative urine pools with known quantities of analytes. The analytes were
spiked at the middle of each positive color block as well as between the negative and
the first positive color block. Multiple samples were tested for each concentration.
The prepared samples were then assayed on three iChem®VELOCITY™ analyzers.
Sensitivity was defined as the lowest concentration that will yield ≥ 67% positive
results.

e. Analytical specificity:
Negative urine was spiked one at a time with the possible interfering substances with
concentrations listed in the following table. Each urine sample was tested with 5
replicates using an iChem® VELOCITY™ instrument and strips. Possible
interference was determined when a difference of one color pad in any of the five
replicates for the particular test analyte compared to either the negative (specificity)
or analyte-spiked positive sample (interference).
The following potentially interfering substances at concentrations indicated were
added to the urine. The noted interferences are stated in the labeling.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed using a single replicate of each clinical
specimen between a single lot or reagent test strips and the iChem 100 analyzer with a
single lot of iChem 10SG reagent strips. A minimum of 50 clinical samples were
analyzed for the first positive color block above the negative. No spiked samples were
used. For the second and successive color blocks above the lowest color block a
minimum of 40 clinical samples were analyzed. Clinically positive spiked samples were
used when insufficient numbers of high concentration samples were not available.

*The sponsor states in the labeling, this discrepancy is due to the reflectance border
separating 50 from 150 mg/dL. This design concept results in reduced concordance
at the 50/150 border.
