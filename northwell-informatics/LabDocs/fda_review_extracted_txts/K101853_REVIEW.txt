L. Test Principle:
The PLAC Test Reagent Kit is a turbidimetric immunoassay (TIA) using two specific
monoclonal antibodies (2C10 and 4B4) coated to polymeric microparticles in
suspension. As the concentration of Lp-PLA increases, the turbidity of the
2
suspension also increases, and this change in absorbance is read at 570 nm on a
clinical chemistry analyzer. The change in absorbance is proportional to the amount
of Lp-PLA in the patient sample. A set of Lp-PLA calibrators is used to plot a
2 2
standard curve of absorbance (y-axis) versus Lp-PLA concentration in ng/mL (x-

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The PLAC Test was validated on the Hitachi® 917

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Intra-assay, inter-assay and total precision was assessed according to CLSI
EP5 – A2 with three reagent lots. Two buffered controls and five serum
samples (values ranging from 51 to 449 ng/mL) were assayed in duplicates in
2 separate runs on the Hitachi 917 analyzer for 20 days. The results are
shown in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The recovery of the reportable range was assessed according to CLSI EP6-A.
Ten sample sets were prepared using 3 sets of low and high serum samples
and 7 sets prepared using a high serum sample and bovine calf serum
(negative serum source). The samples were assayed in duplicates with 3 lots
on a single analyzer. Percent recovery was determined and linear regression
analysis was conducted. The results are presented in the table below. The
linear range was determined as 25-500 ng/mL.

Additionally, the zero calibrator was spiked with varying levels of
recombinant Lp-PLA up to 3,000 ng/mL and tested to assess the prozone or
2
high hook dose effect. The results of the hook effect study supports the
sponsor’s claimed measuring range of 25-500 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The PLAC Test Calibrator Kit and Lp-PLA Control Kit were previously
2
cleared and have not been modified, see k072599 for traceability, stability,
and expected values.
Shelf life stability testing was performed on 3 reagent lots stored capped at
37ºC which was compared to the established PLAC Test Reagent Kit
(k072599) also stored at 37ºC. Each reagent was calibrated at each time point
before testing samples. Each sample was tested at days 1,6,8,15,21, and 42
with two replicates per sample. Two buffer based controls and 5 serum
samples ranging from 55-455 ng/mL were assayed. The reagent fill volumes

for each reagent kit were equivalent to a 100 test fill volume. The control
reagent met the acceptance criteria. Real-time stability study is on going.
On-board stability testing of the reagent was performed with the reagent
stored uncapped on-board the Hitachi® 917 analyzer. One lot of reagent was
tested for on-board stability. Two controls and 5 human samples ranging
from 58 to 448 ng/mL were run once a week for three weeks with a
calibration performed at time 0. Five replicates were run for each sample.
The results met the acceptance criteria with 90-110% average recovery from
time 0 for at least 2 weeks. This supports the claimed on-board stability claim
of 2 weeks.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor conducted a Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and
a Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) study. The detection limit was defined as the
lowest quantity of Lp-PLA that is significantly different from the absence of
2
any Lp-PLA . In order to determine the LoD, the LoB was first defined by
2
running 60 replicates of the 0 level calibrator using three reagent lots. Then,
six low serum samples were prepared by diluting serum samples with fetal
bovine serum (Lp-PLA negative serum). Each sample was tested in duplicate
2
over 5 days (10 results per sample, n=60).
The results of the LoB and LoD studies are summarized in the following
table:
Lot LoB (ng/mL) LoD (ng/mL)
1 1.99 4.50
2 3.17 5.84
3 1.65 4.15
The LOQ was defined as the lowest concentration at which an analyte can be
measured accurately without exceeding 20% CV. Three low serum samples
were diluted with fetal bovine serum in a series of four dilutions per sample
(1x, 0.5x, 0.25x, and 0.125x). Each sample was tested in duplicate in 10 runs
by three reagent lots on one analyzer. The sponsor’s predetermined total error
goal was ≤ 5 ng/mL for LoQ ≤ 20 ng/mL. The total error estimate was ≤ 5
ng/mL for all three lots, therefore, LoQ=LoD (4.5, 5.8, 4.2 ng/mL).
The measuring range of the assay was established as 25 - 500 ng/mL based on
the linearity studies and detection limit studies.
e. Analytical specificity:
Five endogenous substances (hemoglobin, triglycerides, total cholesterol,
bilirubin, and human serum albumin) and exogenous substances (common and
prescription drugs in the package insert) were evaluated for interference in the

assay. Potential interfering substances were spiked with interferent into four
different serum samples with endogenous Lp-PLA ranging from 140-500
2
ng/mL. Defined amounts of the interferents at and exceeding a relevant
physiological range were added to the serum samples, assayed in duplicate
with three lots of reagents. Interferent test concentrations were selected
according to CLSI Protocol EP7-A2. Controls were prepared for each sample
by spiking with solvent used for each substance stock solution. Controls were
matched to test samples for volume and solvent concentration. Recoveries of
test samples were calculated as result/matched control value x 100%. Testing
results met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria of less than 10% error in detected
Lp-PLA in the presence of the compound. There was no significant (less
2
than or equal to 10%) interference detected for any of the substances listed
below.

The current PLAC Test turbidimetric immunoassay method testing 3 lots on
the Hitachi 917 was compared to the PLAC Test ELISA microplate assay
(k062234). The singlet point method comparison for the 742 unaltered stored
human serum samples ranged from 25-500 ng/mL, obtained from banked
study sets were within the sponsor’s linear range. The results are shown in the
table below.
Method Comparisons of PLAC Test Reagent Kit Lots vs. ELISA (Lots 1, 2
and 3)

Lot 2 1.1 -2.9 0.92 742
Lot 3 1.0 -2.2 0.92 742
b. Matrix comparison:
The sponsor conducted a matrix comparison study with the PLAC
turbidimetric immunoassay. Twenty fresh samples were collected in each of
the four tube types (Serum with separator (SST), Serum, EDTA Plasma, and
EDTA Plasma with separator) and an aliquot of each sample was stored at 4ºC
and -70ºC for 1 day post collection. An additional twenty banked and paired
SST/K2EDTA samples obtained from a commercial sample bank were used to
cover the upper assay range. These samples were stored at -70ºC until use.
Each sample was tested in triplicate using one lot of reagent on a single
Hitachi 917 analyzer. Samples tested ranged from 59 to 418 ng/mL. The
resulting recoveries ranged from 95% to 110%. The results of the regression
analyses are shown in the table below.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
A screened normal healthy population who met the following inclusion criteria
for the study: not on any lipid-modifying medications and have no reported
evidence of cardiovascular disease. In addition, the following exclusion criteria
were utilized: age <35, currently on lipid-modifying medications, and with a
reported history of cardiovascular disease. The sponsor collected a set of 312
screened samples from a clinical research organization. Samples were of men and
women between the ages of 35-75 years old (median age of 50 years).
The demographics are as followed:
Population Number Age
