L. Test Principle:
This enzymatic method is based on the method by Slein using hexokinase and glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase enzymes. The ADVIA Chemistry Glucose Hexokinase_3
(GLUH_3) method is a two-component reagent. Sample is added to Reagent 1, which
contains the buffer, ATP, and NAD. Absorbance readings of the sample in Reagent 1 are
taken and are used to correct for interfering substances in the sample. Reagent 2 is added,
which initiates the reaction. Glucose is phosphorylated by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in
the presence of hexokinase. The glucose-6-phosphate that forms is oxidized in the presence
of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase causing the reduction of NAD to NADH. The
absorbance of NADH is measured as an endpoint reaction at 340/410 nm. The difference
between the absorbance in Reagent 1 and Reagent 2 is proportional to the glucose
concentration.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed using commercial quality controls and native
samples. Studies were carried out in duplicate, twice per day, over a period of 10 to
20 days using two ADVIA Chemistry Glucose Hexokinase_3 (GLUH_3) reagent lots
on two different ADVIA 1650 Chemistry Systems. A low level urine sample was
assayed in duplicate on one system over a period of nine days. The mean, standard
deviation (SD), and coefficients of variation (CV) were determined at each level as
summarized below:

samples and human serum samples. Low pools consisted of a normal human urine
sample and a glucose-depleted normal human serum sample. High pools consisted of
low pools spiked with glucose to concentrations of approximately 800 mg/dL. The
glucose concentrations ranged from 3.5-796 mg/dL. In addition, a linearity study was
performed using a CSF pool of human samples at eleven different levels covering the
glucose range from 3.0-833 mg/dL. Each sample was measured in duplicate using
one ADVIA Chemistry Glucose Hexokinase_3 (GLUH_3) reagent lot on one ADVIA
1650 Chemistry System. Linearity was evaluated by least-square regression analysis
and comparison of observed recovery versus expected values.

The claimed reportable range for the ADVIA Chemistry Glucose Hexokinase_3
(GLUH_3) reagent on the ADVIA 1650 Chemistry System is 4 to 700 mg/dL. Data
was provided to demonstrate that samples resulting in glucose values above the upper
range limit will be automatically diluted and reported after applying dilution
correction factor.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The ADVIA Chemistry Glucose Hexokinase_3 (GLUH_3) method is traceable to a
standard reference serum (SRM 965a) glucose material from the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST). A second set of standard reference material, a
serum-based sample, a spiked serum sample, and an aqueous glucose sample are
analyzed on the ADVIA 1650 Chemistry System and recovered values must fall
within acceptance criteria based on the target value of the NIST standard.
Stability
The stability of the ADVIA Chemistry Glucose Hexokinase_3 (GLUH_3) reagent
was evaluated with real-time stability studies. The reagent shelf life claim is 18
months when stored at the recommended temperature of 2 to 8°C. An on-board
stability study confirmed that the reagent is stable for 60 days on-board the ADVIA
1650 Chemistry System at the recommended temperature of 2 to 8°C. The
manufacturer does not recommend removing open reagents from the system.
Calibrators and Controls
A calibration frequency study with the ADVIA Chemistry Glucose Hexokinase_3
(GLUH_3) method showed that the system should be calibrated with the Siemens
Chemistry Calibrator at a frequency of at least every 60 days. The performance of the
calibrator for the ADVIA Chemistry Glucose Hexokinase_3 (GLUH_3) method has
been demonstrated in a previous 510(k) submission. The manufacturer states in the
labeling that individual laboratory quality control programs and procedures may
require more frequent calibration. The manufacturer also recommends the use of a
commercial control material with at least two glucose levels tested according to
workflow, system experience, and government regulation.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) for the ADVIA Chemistry
Glucose Hexokinase_3 (GLUH_3) method were evaluated based on CLSI EP17-A
guidelines. Studies were performed using N ≤ 2 reagent lots on one ADVIA 1650
Chemistry System.

Detection Limit Data Summary
Limit Protocol
Serum LoB A human serum glucose-depleted sample pool was evaluated. A
total of 6 runs (10 replicates per run) were completed, N=120,
over a period of three days.
LoD A low serum sample pool with a glucose concentration of 3-4
mg/dL was evaluated in duplicate. A total of 58 runs were over a
period of nine days.
Urine LoB A normal human urine pool was evaluated. A total of 6 runs (10
replicates per run) were completed, N=120, over a period of nine
days.
LoD A low urine sample with a glucose concentration of 6 mg/dL was
evaluated in duplicate. A total of 57 runs were completed over a
period of nine days.
CSF LoB A human CSF glucose-depleted sample pool was evaluated. A
total of 3 runs (10 replicates per run) were completed, N=60, over
a period of three days.
LoD A low CSF sample pool with a glucose concentration of 1.5 mg/dL
was evaluated. A total of 3 runs (10 replicates per run) were
completed, N=60, over a period of three days.
Claimed Values
LoB 0.30 mg/dL
LoD 4.0 mg/dL
e. Analytical specificity:
Interferences studies were performed by adding potentially interfering substances to
samples and calculating bias relative to a control (no interferent). Five equally
diluted samples using either human serum or human urine pools were tested by
adding different interferent concentrations. Samples were measured in duplicate
using one ADVIA Chemistry Glucose Hexokinase_3 (GLUH_3) reagent lot on one
ADVIA 1650 Chemistry System. No significant interference defined as no more than
± 10% was observed up to the levels shown in the table below for the following
interfering substances:
