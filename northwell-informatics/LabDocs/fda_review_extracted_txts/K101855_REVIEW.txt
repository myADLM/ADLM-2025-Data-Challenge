Microbiology (83)
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The ProFASTTM+ Assay is a multiplex Real Time RT-PCR in vitro diagnostic test for
the qualitative detection and discrimination of seasonal Influenza A/H1, seasonal
Influenza A/H3 and 2009 H1N1 Influenza viral nucleic acids isolated and purified
from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens from human patients with signs and
symptoms of respiratory infection in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological
risk factors. This assay targets conserved regions of the Hemagglutinin (HA) gene for
seasonal Influenza A/H1, seasonal Influenza A/H3 and 2009 H1N1 Influenza Virus,
respectively. This assay is not intended to detect Influenza B or Influenza C Viruses.
A negative ProFAST+ Assay result is a presumptive negative result for Influenza A.
These results should be confirmed by an FDA cleared nucleic acid-based test (NAT)
detecting Influenza A.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as
the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.
If infection with a novel Influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities,
specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel
virulent Influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral
culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to
receive and culture specimens.
2. Indication(s) for use: Same as the Intended Use

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
To be used with the Cepheid SmartCycler II Real Time Instrument with Dx Software
version 1.7b or 3.0a/b and either a MagNA Pure LC Instrument (Roche) and the
MagNA Pure Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Roche) or a NucliSENS® easyMAG™
System (bioMérieux) and the Automated Magnetic Extraction Reagents (bioMérieux).
I. Device Description:
The ProFAST+ Assay is a multiplex Taqman based Real Time RT-PCR test that
enables detection and differentiation of human Influenza A Virus subtypes: seasonal
H1, seasonal H3, and 2009 H1N1 Influenza.
An overview of the procedure is as follows:
1. Collect NP swab specimens from symptomatic patients using a polyester,
rayon or nylon tipped swab and place into viral transport medium (not
provided with the kit).
2. Add an Internal Control (IC) to every sample to monitor for inhibitors present
in the specimens.
3. Perform isolation and purification of nucleic acids using a MagNA Pure LC
Instrument (Roche) and the MagNA Pure Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit
(Roche), or a NucliSENS® easyMAG™ System (bioMérieux) and the
Automated Magnetic Extraction Reagents (bioMérieux),
4. Add purified nucleic acids to the supermix along with enzymes included in the
ProFAST+ kit. The supermix contains target-specific oligonucleotide primers
and probes. The probes are dual-labeled with a reporter dye and a quencher
dye (see table below).
5. Perform reverse transcription of RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) and
subsequent amplification of DNA in a Cepheid SmartCycler® II instrument. In
this process, the probe anneals specifically to the template followed by primer
extension and amplification. The ProFAST+ Assay is based on Taqman
chemistry, which utilizes the 5’ – 3’ exonuclease activity of the Taq
polymerase to cleave the probe thus separating the reporter dye from the
quencher. This generates an increase in fluorescent signal upon excitation from
a light source. With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved
from their respective probes, further increasing fluorescent signal. The amount
of fluorescence at any given cycle is dependent on the amount of amplification
products present at that time. Fluorescent intensity is monitored during each
PCR cycle by the real-time instrument.

L. Test Principle:
The real-time PCR process simultaneously amplifies and detects nucleic acid targets in a
single closed-tube reaction. The ProFAST+ Assay enables the detection and
differentiation of seasonal Influenza A/H1, seasonal Influenza A/H3, 2009 H1N1
Influenza and an Internal Control and is based on three processes: nucleic acid isolation,
reverse transcription (RT) and Real Time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
amplification/detection. The Internal Control (IC) is added to each nasopharyngeal (NP)
swab from symptomatic patients to monitor for inhibitors present. Nucleic acids are
isolated and purified from the NP swab sample. Purified nucleic acid is added to the
ProFAST+ Supermix (includes Taq polymerase) along with the appropriate enzymes.
The ProFAST+ Supermix contains oligonucleotide primers complementary to highly
conserved regions of the hemagglutinin genes for seasonal Influenza A/H1, seasonal
Influenza A/H3, 2009 H1N1 Influenza and target-specific oligonucleotide probes dual-
labeled with a reporter dye attached to the 5’ end and a quencher dye attached to the 3’
end. After initial reverse transcription of RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA),
8

--- Page 9 ---
amplification proceeds during which the primers and probe anneal specifically to the
template (if present) followed by primer extension and amplification. The ProFAST+
Assay is based on Taqman chemistry, which utilizes the 5’ – 3’ exonuclease activity of
the Taq polymerase to cleave the probe thus separating the reporter dye from the
quencher. This generates an increase in fluorescent signal upon excitation from a light
source. With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved from their
respective probes, further increasing the fluorescent signal. The amount of fluorescence at
any given cycle is dependent on the amount of amplification product present at that time.
Fluorescent intensity is monitored during each PCR cycle by the real-time instrument.

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility Study
An Inter-Laboratory Reproducibility study was conducted by extracting and
testing a panel of 18 samples at three sites (two external sites and at Gen-Probe
Prodesse Inc.) performed by two operators at each site for 5 days per operator (for
a total of 10 runs per site). The Reproducibility Panel used in the study was
prepared by spiking confirmed negative nasopharyngeal (NP) swab pools with
cultured and titered stock solutions of seasonal H1 Influenza A (A/H1), seasonal
H3 Influenza A (A/H3) and 2009 H1N1 Influenza Virus (A/2009 H1N1) at low
positive (2 x LoD), medium positive (10 x LoD) or negative (0.001 x LoD)
concentrations. Each panel included two replicates of each Influenza A subtype at
each concentration. This resulted in each Reproducibility Panel consisting of 2
Medium Positives, 2 Low Positives, and 2 Negatives for each of three Influenza A
strains (n = 18 total). Panel members were coded to make 18-sample test panels
and to ensure sample identification was unknown to the operators. The 18-sample
test panels were stored at ≤ -70oC and shipped to the sites frozen.
A set of ten panels (180 total samples) was provided to each laboratory; one set
was used for each of the 5 testing days per operator. Each operator thawed one
panel set per day and performed nucleic acid extraction on the panel samples
using either the Roche MagNA Pure LC system (Site #1) or the bioMérieux
NucliSENS easyMAG (Site #2 and Site #3), and the extracted nucleic acids were
tested with the ProFAST+ Assay on the Cepheid SmartCycler II. ProFAST+
Assay controls (Positive, Extraction and Negative) were also included with each
panel run. Two lots of ProFAST+ Supermix were used by each of the three sites.
A total of 630 data points were included in the reproducibility study data analysis
(21 samples and controls/run X 1 run/day/operator X 2 operators X 5 days X 3
sites = 630). The total percent agreement for the ProFAST+ Assay was 99.7%.
The ProFAST+ Assay is a qualitative assay based partially on numerical Cycle
Threshold (Ct) values. The overall Ct value %CV across all sites for all samples

and controls ranged from 1.01% to 5.62% depending upon analyte type, target
type, and concentration tested.

Due to the fact that the clinical trial for the ProFAST+ Assay resulted in less than
10% of the clinical samples that were positive by the ProFAST+ Assay with Ct
values beyond the mean Ct values of the LoDs (approximately 39 Ct for A/H1, 34
Ct for A/H3 and 32 Ct for 2009 H1N1), but before the assay cutoff at 45 cycles, a
supplemental Inter-Laboratory Reproducibility Study at three sites to evaluate
inter-laboratory reproducibility of the ProFAST+ Assay with samples having a
concentration below the assay’s Limit of Detection (LoDs) but above the High
Negatives previously tested in the reproducibility study is not necessary.
However, the potential limitation of imprecision of testing extremely low levels of
targets below the LoDs of the assay should still be addressed by including the
following statement in the Limitation section of the ProFAST+ Assay Instructions
for Use “As with all PCR based in vitro diagnostic tests, extremely low levels of
target below the LoD of the assay may be detected, but results may not be
reproducible.”

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls
The following controls are provided in the ProFAST+ Assay kit:
Positive Control (PC): The ProFAST+ Assay kit contains an Influenza A
Subtyping positive RNA control that consists of one pool of three RNA transcripts
(specific for each Influenza A subtype: A/H1, A/H3 and A/2009 H1N1). These
transcripts are derived from plasmids containing the viral sequences of interest
and are not intact virus particles. The Influenza A Subtyping PC contains equal
amounts of A/H1, A/H3 and A/2009 H1N1. The approximate concentration of
each transcript was 5x103copies/µl. The PC does not go through nucleic acid
isolation and purification, but is included during set-up of the RT-PCR reaction.
The PC in conjunction with the IC is used to verify reagent and system
performance. The PC is meant to be a control for global failure of the assay
(missing reaction component, instrument failure, etc). Because the PC is assessing
global failure and the customer variance components were to be determined
during the clinical trial, a broad Ct range was desired. The acceptable range was
set to 20.0 to 40.0 in the Clinical Trial Protocol for all Influenza A subtype targets
to allow for dilution variability (e.g. pipetting) of the PC by the end users. Of a
total of 75 PC tested by the ProFAST+ Assay during the clinical trial, 98.7%
(74/75) of these controls gave correct results initially. The average Ct of the PCs
tested was 32.35 (Min 31.50- Max 33.40), with 0.34 Standard Deviation (STDEV)
and 1.05% CV; 30.54 (Min 29.80- Max 31.70), with 0.34 Standard Deviation
(STDEV) and 1.12%; and 31.09 (Min 30.10- Max 32.40), with 0.35 Standard
Deviation (STDEV) and 1.14 % CV for A/H1, A/H3, and A/2009H1N1
respectively. In addition, the average Ct for the PC was 32.16, 31.03, and 31.25 (n
= 31) during the Reproducibility Study. The clinical study data validated the pre-
determined PC Ct acceptance range of 20.0 to 40.0.
Internal Control (IC): An Internal RNA Control, a non-infectious RNA transcript,
is incorporated into every sample and is carried through all steps of the procedure
from nucleic acid isolation and purification through amplification to monitor for
inhibitors present in the specimen or reaction tube. The IC also serves as a general
process control ensuring that each step of the procedure was performed correctly,
assay and instrument parameters were set correctly, and that general reagents were
working. The IC is meant to assess global failure (reagent or process) and monitor
for PCR inhibition. Because the IC is assessing global failure and the customer
variance components were to be determined during the clinical trial, a broad Ct
range was desired. The acceptable range for the Internal Control (IC) was set to
20-40 Ct in the Clinical Trial Protocol to accommodate for dilution variability
(e.g., pipetting) by the user in spiking the IC, and also accommodate slight
inhibition. The average Ct of all eligible prospective ProFAST+ Assay negative
clinical specimens was 27.93 (Min 25.0- Max 35.20), with 1.32 Standard
Deviation (STDEV) and 4.73 % CV. The average Ct of all eligible ProFAST+
11

--- Page 12 ---
Assay Negative Control was 27.36 (Min 25.50- Max 32.70), with 1.12 Standard
Deviation (STDEV) and 4.09% CV. In addition, the average Ct for the IC was
28.24 (Min 25.80- Max 30.90) with 1.59 standard deviation and 5.62 % CV during
the Reproducibility Study. The clinical study data validated the pre-determined IC
Ct acceptance range of 20.0 to 40.0.
Final release specifications were formally established during Test Method
Characterization (TMC) then validated against the appropriate analytical
performance characteristics of specificity and total imprecision. Final release
specifications were developed to ensure First Pass Acceptance (FPA) rates of ≥
99% at lot release and customer rejection rate of ≤ 1% for a lot released at
Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) (i.e. 95% probability of QC lot acceptance at lot
release). For customer specifications, the maximum allowable customer lot
rejection rate at the Rejectable Quality Level (RQL) Limit (i.e., 10% probability
of QC acceptance at lot release) is 1%. A false valid risk of ≤ 5% was used to
determine the validity specifications.
QC release specification ranges were set using Operator Characteristics (OC)
curve analysis. Lot, technician, instrument, run, and replicate variance components
were obtained during test method characterization. Observed Ct means were
adjusted for stability effects and specifications determined to meet the validity and
specification requirements above.

The following controls are not provided in the ProFAST+ Assay kit, but are
required or recommended and described in the ProFAST+ Assay Instructions for
Use:
Negative Control (NC): A Negative Control (NC) is not provided with the kit, but
is required and described in the ProFAST+ Assay Instructions for Use. Viral
transport media spiked with the IC is to be used as the negative control and
processed starting from nucleic acid isolation. The negative control serves to
monitor for contamination. Of a total of 78 NC tested by the ProParaflu+ Assay
during the clinical trial, 97.4% (76/78) of these controls gave correct results
initially. The average Ct of the IC in tested NC was 27.36 (Min 25.50- Max
32.70), with 1.12 Standard Deviation (STDEV) and 4.09% CV.
Extraction Control (EC): An Extraction Control (EC) is not provided with the kit,
however, during the clinical trial, a pool of seasonal A/H1N1, seasonal A/H3N2
and 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses was included with each nucleic acid isolation

run. The EC served to monitor for lysis during nucleic acid isolation. Of a total
of 77 EC tested by the ProFAST+ Assay during the clinical trial, 100% (77/77) of
these controls gave correct results initially. The average Ct of the PCs tested was
28.80 (Min 27.60- Max 30.10), with 0.66 Standard Deviation (STDEV) and
2.28% CV; 26.90 (Min 25.70- Max 28.10), with 0.59 Standard Deviation

Deviation (STDEV) and 2.62 % CV for A/H1, A/H3, and A/2009H1N1
respectively. The sponsor is recommending an extraction control in each
nucleic acid extraction run to the end users in the package insert.
Freeze/Thaw and Stability
Reagents and Controls stability
An Accelerated Stability study concluded that the ProFAST+ Supermix, enzymes
and controls (closed and open tubes) can be stored at ≤ -70oC for up to 18 months.
Real time stability studies are currently ongoing at Gen-Probe Prodesse.
A Freeze/Thaw Study demonstrated that the ProFAST+ Supermix can undergo up
to 5 freeze-thaws. The Controls (Positive and Internal Control) can undergo up to
2 freeze-thaws. For the Controls, the ProFAST+ Assay Package Insert specifies
that controls should not undergo more than 1 freeze-thaw cycle. Although internal
studies demonstrated that up to 2 freeze-thaws of controls would not adversely
affect performance. To mitigate risk it is recommended they not undergo more
than 1 freeze-thaw.
Specimen stability
The ProFAST+ Assay recommends that samples be stored refrigerated (2oC –
8oC) for up to 72 hours prior to processing the samples. This recommendation is
supported by 1) The ProFlu+ Assay (detection of Influenza A, Influenza B and
RSV nucleic acid), the Pro hMPV+ (detection of human Metapneumovirus
(hMPV) nucleic acid), and the ProParaflu+ Assay (detection of human
Parainfluenza virus nucleic acid) also recommend that samples be stored
refrigerated (2oC – 8oC) for up to 72 hours prior to processing the samples; 2) The
CLSI Guidance: Collection, Transport, Preparation and Storage of Specimens for
Molecular Methods (MM13) does not specify requirements for nasopharyngeal
(NP) swabs, but does recommend that bronchioalveolar lavage samples be
refrigerated for up to 72 hours or frozen (at -70oC) for longer periods prior to
processing for molecular methods; 3) A 72 hour timeframe is widely
recommended and used (CLSI Guidance M41 Viral Culture) for viral culture. For
viral culture sample stability is important as viable virus is required for growth,
however, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) do not require viable virus for
detection.
The ProFAST+ Assay also recommends that extracted nucleic acids that are not
13

--- Page 14 ---
run immediately after extraction may be stored at ≤-70ºC before running
ProFAST+. Typically, purified nucleic acids may be stored for extended periods
of time at ≤-70ºC without marked degradation. Both CLSI guidances MM13
(Collection, Transport, Preparation and Storage of Specimens for Molecular
Methods) and MM17 (Verification and Validation of Multiplex Nucleic Acid
Assays) recommend storage of isolated RNA at ultralow temperature and limiting
the number of freeze-thaw cycles.
Comparison between Fresh and Frozen Specimens
To determine the potential effects of freezing NP samples and purified nucleic
acids may have on the ProFAST+ Assay, an analytical study was carried out.
Contrived samples were generated using aliquots from a negative NP swab pool
spiked with one of three Influenza A (IA) strains representing the viruses targeted
by the ProFAST+ Assay which include seasonal H1 (A/H1), seasonal H3 (A/H3),
and 2009 H1N1swine-origin (A/2009 H1N1). Fresh IA positive NP swab samples
were not available for the study due to low prevalence of influenza during this past
winter respiratory season (December 2009 – March 2010). Contrived samples
were made at varying concentrations in negative NP swab matrix. For each of the
three strains, twenty samples were generated (n=60) in the following manner: 2
samples each at 3 logs, 2 logs, and 1 log above LoD and 7 samples each of 3x
LoD and at LoD (as determined during the Analytical Sensitivity Study). After
sample generation, a portion of each sample was freshly extracted on the
bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG. The remaining portion of the samples were
frozen at ≤-70ºC and then extracted again as described above. The nucleic acids
were run fresh (immediately subsequent to extraction) in a single replicate. The
remaining nucleic acids were frozen at <-70°C and later thawed on ice and
subjected to RT-PCR as described above. The following tables summarize the
results of the study:

d. Analytical Sensitivity (Detection limit):
LoD estimation studies using the Roche MagNA Pure LC
The analytical sensitivity (limit of detection or LoD) of the ProFAST+ Assay was
estimated using quantified (TCID /mL) cultures of viral strains of A/H1, A/H3
50
and A/2009 H1N1 (H1N1 A/Virginia/1/06; H1N1 A/Hong Kong/2652/06; H3N2
A/Anhui/1239/05; H3N2 A/California/07/04; 2009 H1N1 Clinical Isolate #1; and
2009 H1N1 Clinical Isolate #2) serially diluted in negative nasopharyngeal (NP)
pools prepared from leftover NP swab clinical samples. Each viral strain was
previously cultured and titered to determine its stock concentration in TCID /mL.
50
Each viral stock was spiked into negative NP swab pools at concentrations of 1
log above, 0.5 log above, 1 log below, 0.5 log below, and at the estimated LoD for
that virus (based on preliminary studies). Each virus concentration was tested in
quintuplicate for a total of 5 data points per virus concentration.
An Internal RNA Control (IC) was spiked into all dilution series samples prior to
nucleic acid isolation. The IC monitors for PCR inhibition as well as reagent,
procedural or instrumentation failures. A negative control, which consisted of
negative NP swab matrix spiked with IC was included with each set of dilution
series. Nucleic acid isolation of the negative control was performed along with
the Analytical Sensitivity Panel samples. The negative control served to monitor
for contamination during the testing procedure or the presence of inhibitors in the
sample matrix. The Influenza A Subtyping Positive RNA Control, non-infectious
in vitro transcribed RNA of specific A/H1, A/H3, and A/2009 H1N1 viral
sequences, was included with each RT-PCR run to test for procedural errors
(absence of reagent, instrument failure, etc.).
Analytical sensitivity was estimated for each virus strain. The LoD was estimated
as the lowest concentration that was detected ≥95% of the time (i.e. concentration
at which at least 5 out of 5 replicates were determined to be positive). The data are
presented in the following table:

(absence of reagent, instrument failure, etc.).
For some of the strains, more than one concentration was included for the
confirmation portion of the study, typically the two lowest concentrations that
yielded 100% detection to ensure achievement of >95% detection for each strain.
For strain H3N2 A/Anhui/1239/05, the lowest concentration tested for the
estimation portion of the study resulted in 100% detection, thus that concentration
and the next two lower half-log concentrations were tested in the confirmation
portion of the study. Each of the 20 replicates was subjected to the entire test
system from sample preparation and extraction to RT-PCR. All samples were
extracted using the MagNA Pure LC Instrument. In the event that the initial LoD
estimated concentration was not confirmed (i.e. <19 replicates were not positive),
the LoD confirmation was repeated using the next half-log higher concentration.

Extraction Equivalency Study
To evaluate the equivalency of nucleic acid extraction of the bioMérieux
NucliSENS easyMAG to the Roche MagNA Pure LC for use with the ProFAST+
Assay, an analytical study was carried out to determine “equivalency” by
confirming the LoDs on the easyMAG extractor for each of the three (Seasonal
A/H1, Seasonal A/H3 and A/2009 H1N1 Influenza) subtypes of Influenza A used
in the Analytical Sensitivity Study (determined and confirmed using the MagNA
Pure LC). Both instruments were also used throughout assay development,
Clinical Trials and Reproducibility.
The Roche MagNA Pure LC is an automated nucleic acid isolation and
purification system based upon binding of nucleic acids to glass particles and has
the capability to process a total of 32 reactions within one run. Nucleic acid is
purified in multiple plastic reaction tips and cartridges by several steps that
include cell lysis and binding of nucleic acid to magnetic glass particles, wash
steps, and a heated elution to unbind the nucleic acid from the glass particles.
The bioMérieux NucliSens easyMAG is an automated nucleic acid isolation and
purification system that is based upon the same silica extraction technology as the
MagNA Pure. The easyMAG is capable of processing a total of 24 reactions with
variable sample types, sample volumes, and elution volumes within a single run.
Nucleic acid is purified within a single cartridge by several steps that include lysis
and binding of nucleic acid to high affinity magnetic silica beads, a series of wash
steps and heated elution of purified nucleic acid from the silica beads.
One operator generated dilution series for each viral strain and spiked each diluted
virus into the same negative nasopharyngeal (NP) swab pool used for the
ProFAST+ Analytical Sensitivity Study at the LoD concentration confirmed in
that study. Twenty independent data points from the specific (LoD) viral dilution
were generated by performing 20 independent extractions on the easyMAG; each
extracted sample was run in a single replicate on the Cepheid SmartCycler II. The
two extraction instruments were considered equivalent if the detection rate using
the easyMAG at the LoD was not statistically different (at significance level of
p<0.05) than the rate obtained using the MagNA Pure instrument. Twenty of
twenty replicates were positive using the MagNA Pure for 5 of the 6 strains tested

and therefore, 18 replicates were required to test positive using the easyMAG
(p=0.0734) to claim equivalency. The Prodesse 2009 H1N1 clinical isolate #1
strain only tested at 95% positive (19/20) for the LoD using the MagNA Pure and
therefore, for that particular strain, 16 of 20 were required to test positive
(p=0.0757) to claim equivalency.
The Internal RNA Control II (IC) was spiked into all samples prior to nucleic acid
isolation. The IC monitors for RT-PCR inhibition as well as any reagent,
procedural or instrumentation failure. The Influenza A Subtyping RNA Control II
(PC) was included with each RT-PCR run to test for global errors (absence of
reagent, instrument failure, etc.). The Influenza PC does not require nucleic acid
isolation and was diluted just prior to set up of RT-PCR reactions. A Negative
Control which consisted of Viral Transport Media (VTM) spiked with the IC was
included for each extraction run. The Negative Control serves to monitor for
contamination during the testing procedure or the presence of inhibitors in the
sample matrix.

† The MagNA Pure LC data was previously generated during the ProFAST+ Analytical Sensitivity Study.
*Although <95% was detected, the difference is not statistically significant using the easyMAG as compared to extraction with the MagNA
Pure LC.
These data demonstrated that the easyMAG extractor is not statistically
different than the MagNA Pure LC instrument when testing LoD
concentrations and is therefore equivalent to the MagNA Pure LC extractor.
Moreover, any performance claims made using the MagNA Pure with the
ProFAST+ Assay should be achievable using the easyMAG. Clinical trial and
reproducibility studies also supported comparable performance of both
automated extraction systems.

e. Analytical Reactivity:
The analytical reactivity of the ProFAST+ Assay was evaluated using multiple
strains of Influenza A: 14 strains of seasonal H1, 14 strains of seasonal H3, 4
strains of 2009 H1N1. Viral strains were selected to include strains from 1933 to
the present, as well as from various geographical locations, to incorporate the
genetic variation that may be encountered by ProFAST+ users:

* Strains presumed to be non-reactive based on preliminary testing; all were tested at the highest concentration available for each strain.
†Strains not re-cultured and titered. The original culture/titer from ATCC was used in this study.
A preliminary Limit of Detection (LoD) was established for most of the strains
during pre-verification studies. Four of the A/H1 strains appear non-reactive with
the ProFAST+ Assay and do not have a preliminary LoD. The strains used in the
study were tested at 2x LoD (as determined in pre-verification studies or at the
highest concentration possible for strains that were non-reactive). One sample

was generated for each strain by spiking cultured and titered virus into aliquots of
a negative nasopharyngeal (NP) swab pool. Samples were spiked with Internal
Control before extraction on the MagNA Pure LC. Each sample was tested in
triplicate on the Cepheid SmartCycler II.
A Negative Control, which consisted of IC spiked into VTM, was included for
each set of extraction runs. The Negative Control serves to monitor for
contamination during the testing procedure. The Influenza A Subtyping Positive
RNA Control, non-infectious in vitro transcribed RNA of specific A/H1, A/H3,
and A/2009 H1N1 viral sequences, was included with each RT-PCR run to test for
procedural errors (absence of reagent, instrument failure, etc.).
The majority of strains analyzed in this study tested positive by the ProFAST+
Assay as expected. The strains that tested negative during pre-verification studies
and were not expected to be reactive towards the assay remained non-reactive.
Mean Cts and standard deviations for reactive strains were calculated:

There were four strains that were not reactive with the ProFAST+ Assay. These
results were expected, as the strains were not reactive with the ProFAST+ Assay
during pre-verification work. All four strains are reactive with the FDA cleared
Prodesse ProFlu+ Assay (targeting the matrix gene) validating that the non-
reactivity with the ProFAST+ Assay is not due to nucleic acid degradation. It was
not surprising that the older A/H1 strains did not react with ProFAST+ as the
design emphasized more contemporary strains. It is difficult to find regions of the
hemagglutinin gene that are conserved over time considering the mutability of the
virus. The only sequence available for these older strains was for VR 546
A1/Denver/1/57 which showed several mismatches to the primers. However, the
issue of the ProFAST+ assay may not react with non-contemporary influenza A
strains should be addressed in the product package insert as the following: “The
ProFAST+ Assay may not react with non-contemporary influenza A strains”
f. Analytical specificity:
The analytical specificity of the ProFAST+ Assay was evaluated by testing a panel
of 38 viruses (including the three targeted Influenza A viruses, four influenza
viruses of swine origin, and two H5N1 strains), 25 bacteria, and 1 yeast strain
representing common respiratory pathogens or flora commonly present in the
nasopharynx. Bacteria and yeast were tested at concentrations of 106 to107
CFU/mL. Viruses were tested at concentrations of 103 to106 TCID /mL. Samples
50
were extracted and tested in triplicate.
Aliquots of a negative nasopharygeal (NP) swab pool matrix were spiked with the
analytical specificity organisms at concentrations of at 1.0x103 – 106 TCID /ml
50
(except Epstein Barr Virus, which was tested at108 copies/mL) and the bacterial
and yeast strains at 106 – 107 CFU/ml, all of which are clinically relevant
concentrations. Cultured and titered strains of Influenza A HIN1 (A/H1),
Influenza A H3N2 (A/H3), and 2009 H1N1 Influenza A (A/2009 H1N1) were also
included in the panel and tested at 2 logs above their respective Limit of Detection,
and served as Extraction Controls for each target channel:

The cross-reactivity observed with two of the four influenza viruses of swine
origin is expected, since the target for the 2009 H1N1 detection is the HA gene. It
is anticipated that targeting the HA gene may also detect other viruses from the
North American Swine lineage. However, swine-origin influenza viruses have

historically rarely surfaced in humans. Based on the literature, from 1958 until the
current 2009 H1N1 Influenza outbreak, there have been 64 cases of S-OIV in
humans. Fifty-seven of these cases were H1N1, six were characterized as
belonging to the H3N2 lineage, and one was a triple-reassortant H1N2. Thirteen
of these cases occurred in military personnel during a contained and short-lived
(22 days) outbreak at Fort Dix in 1976. Excluding the Fort Dix outbreak, S-OIV
cases in humans have averaged 1 to 2 per year and nearly all have been linked to
exposure to swine. However, the issue of potential reactivity with other swine
origin Influenza A strains should be addressed in the product package insert as the
following: “The ProFAST+ 2009H1N1 reagents may also react with other swine
origin Influenza A strains. However, literature review indicated that Influenza
Virus of Swine Origin have historically rarely surfaced in humans.”
Ideally, seasonal Influenza Viruses (A/H1 and A/H3) and 2009 H1N1 Influenza
strains, such as those tested in the analytical reactivity study, should also be tested
at high virus titer (e.g., 106 TCID /mL) in the analytical specificity study.
50
However, the prospective and retrospective clinical studies included a total of 258
Influenza A positive NPS samples, and no cross-reactivity between seasonal
Influenza Viruses (A/H1 and A/H3) and 2009 H1N1 Influenza markers was
observed. A substantial number of these Influenza A positive samples represented
clinically high viral levels based on Ct values generated from the FDA cleared
ProFlu+ Assay. Therefore, an additional analytical specificity study testing high
titers of seasonal Influenza Viruses (A/H1 and A/H3) and 2009 H1N1 Influenza
strains is not necessary.
In addition to laboratory testing, bioinformatics resources were used to predict
cross reactivity of additional influenza A strains with the seasonal A/H1, seasonal
A/H3 and A/2009 H1N1 targets. A significant number of mismatches are observed
for each primer and probe when compared to the sequences of other Influenza A
subtypes listed below. Optimal primer/probe annealing temp is 2oC - 5oC below
the melt temperature (Tm) of the primer/probe. Due to the number of base pair
mismatches for each Influenza A strain, the Tm for each analyte primer/probe set
is estimated to be >20oC below the actual primer/probe Tm. This Tm difference
would prevent amplification and/or detection of the subtypes listed below with the
ProFAST+ A/H1, A/H3, or A/2009 H1N1 primer/probe sets. The ProFAST+
Assay primer and probe sequences for each Influenza A subtype, A/H1, A/H3 and
A/2009 H1N1, are unique and are not expected to cross-react with the other

g. Assay cut-off:
The “cutoff value” represents the fluorescent intensity signal level (reported in
Relative Fluorescent Units) at which a “positive” reaction reaches a relative
fluorescent intensity above the background or baseline of a “negative” reaction.
If a sample exceeds the threshold in a detection channel during PCR, the sample
is considered positive for that channel. If the sample does not exceed the
threshold for a detection channel by the last PCR cycle, the sample is considered
negative for that channel.
Cutoff Determination and Confirmation studies were conducted with two
operators using two different lots of ProFAST+ Supermix.
Cutoff values (RFUs) of the ProFAST+ Assay were determined upon completion
of the Cutoff Determination Study which included a training set of 58 negative
and simulated positive samples prepared from individual NP swab clinical
samples. Specifically, individual samples (n = 6) were spiked with each type of
Influenza A virus (seasonal H1, seasonal H3 and 2009 H1N1) at 3 logs above the
preliminary Limit of Detection (LoD) representing high positive NP swab
samples. Individual samples (n = 18) were spiked with each of the three Influenza
A strains at 2 times the preliminary LoD representing low positive NP swab
samples. 34 samples were left unspiked. The high and low positive samples, as
well as 30 negative samples were spiked with the Internal Control. Four (4)
negative samples were not spiked with the Internal Control. The samples were
evenly split into two aliquots to be run by two operators.
Each operator evenly divided their Cutoff Determination Study Panel samples into
two series. Samples were extracted using the Roche MagNA Pure LC or the
bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG. A negative viral transport media control
spiked with IC was included with each extraction run. The extracted nucleic acids
and the Influenza A Subtyping Positive RNA Control and the IC diluted in water
were run using two different lots of ProFAST+ Supermix on the Cepheid

The cutoff values were then verified in the Cutoff Confirmation Study against a
set of retrospective clinical samples and controls (32 A/H1 positive, 32 A/H3
positive, 32 A/2009 H1N1 positive, 36 Influenza A negative NP swab samples, 18
Influenza A Subtyping Positive RNA Controls, 16 ICs in TM and 4 Negative
Controls). The determined cutoff was confirmed if ≥90% sensitivity and
specificity was attained for each channel with the above mentioned set of
retrospective clinical samples and controls. The Cutoff Confirmation Study Panel
was split between two Operators.
Each Operator divided their Cutoff Confirmation Study Panel samples into two
series. Internal Control (IC) was spiked into the appropriate samples prior to
extraction. Samples were split evenly and extracted on the Roche MagNA Pure
LC and the bioMérieux easyMAG. The negative controls (viral transport medium
spiked with IC and unspiked) were included with each extraction run. The
Influenza A Subtyping Positive RNA Control was included in each RT-PCR run.
In the FAM, TET, TxR and Cy5 channels, the final RFUs for all samples of the
positives and negatives demonstrated minimal overlap. For a given detection, a
range of possible cutoffs was generated by determining robust lower and upper
boundaries of the threshold, based on final RFU that would minimize false
positives and false negatives. Population distribution, Quantiles, and ROC curves
were used in selecting cutoff thresholds for A/H1, A/H3, A/2009 H1N1 and
Internal Control threshold settings.
Acceptable ranges for the potential cutoff were generated in the following
manners: 1) ROC curves were generated and analyzed for all channels used with
the ProFAST+ Assay. The threshold ranges that yielded the maximum accuracy
were identified. 2) The distributions of the negatives and positives were first
assessed for normality. a) If normal, the averages and standard deviations of the
final RFU were calculated. For the lower limit of the acceptable range of cutoff,
negative samples were analyzed. The lower threshold was defined as the average
final RFU plus three standard deviations of the negatives, that is, the point at
which greater than 99.7% of true negatives are expected to fall below assuming
normality. Similarly, the upper limit of the acceptable range of cutoff threshold
was determined using positives and was defined as the average final RFU minus
three standard deviations. This is the point at which at least 99.7% of true
positives are expected to be greater than, assuming normality. b) If the distribution
was not normal, a Quantile approach was taken. The lower limit of the cutoff
threshold range was defined minimally as the 99.5% quantile of the negative
samples. The upper limit of the cutoff threshold range was defined maximally as
the 0.5% quantile of the positive samples. 3) After settings were finalized the
retrospective clinical samples were evaluated for sensitivity and specificity.
The cutoffs used in the Cutoff Determination and Confirmation Studies are

Analysis settings and threshold settings were determined for FAM (A/H1) = 60,
TET (A/H3) = 40, TxRed (A/2009 H1N1) = 20, Cy5 (IC) = 25. These settings
produced 100% positive agreement and 100% negative agreement in the set of
retrospective clinical samples used during Cutoff Confirmation and produced
100% positive and negative agreement for A/H1, A/H3, and IC; and 96.9%
positive agreement and 100% negative agreement for A/2009 H1N1, and met all
acceptance criteria for the Cutoff Confirmation study. Therefore, cutoff values
were confirmed as acceptable for use during the clinical trials and all subsequent
analytical studies.

i. Interfering Substances:
An interfering substances study was carried out to examine whether a panel of
endogenous and exogenous potential RT-PCR inhibitors affected the performance
of the ProFAST+ Assay. Blood, mucin, or medications (prescription and over-
the-counter) for relief of congestion, sore throat, allergy and asthma symptoms
were spiked into simulated Influenza A positive NP swab matrix. A single strain
of seasonal H1 influenza A, H1N1 A/Virginia/1/06, was used and spiked into
negative NP pools at 2X Limit of Detection (LoD). High clinically relevant
amounts of the potential inhibiting substances were added to spiked samples. An
Internal Control (IC) was added to samples. Nucleic acid from the samples was
extracted with the bioMérieux easyMAG. RT-PCR was performed in triplicate
reactions for each sample on the Cepheid SmartCycler II. Any substance in which
detection of A/H1 or the Internal RNA Control (IC) was not observed was
considered an inhibitor of PCR. A Negative Control, which consisted of M4 viral
transport media spiked with an IC, was included with the Interfering Substances
Panel samples. The Influenza A Subtyping RNA Positive Control was included
with each detection run to test for global errors.
The following table shows the interfering substances used for this study. As
described in the justification column, the concentrations spiked directly into
samples ranged from approximately 5% to 10% of recommended dose for some
substances, while others were tested at concentrations reported in scientific
literature or in references from other IVD package inserts. The substances
consisted of nasal sprays (liquid and powder), ingestible pills and lozenges,
injectables, and endogenous substances (blood and mucin).

j. Internal Control Interference:
Competitive inhibition of the ProFAST+ Assay due to the presence of the IC
was assessed. Simulated samples were tested with and without IC to determine
if the presence of the IC inhibited the reaction. Three cultured and titered
(TCID /mL) strains of Influenza A (H1N1 A/Virginia/1/06, H3N2
50
A/California/07/04, and 2009 H1N1 Clinical Isolate) were used and were spiked
into aliquots of a negative nasopharyngeal (NP) swab pool at one log above
LoD, at LoD and at one log below the LoD for each strain as determined in the
Analytical Sensitivity Study. Each concentration for each strain was prepared
two different ways: spiked with the IC and without any Internal Control (IC)
added. All dilution series were extracted in duplicate on the bioMérieux
NucliSENS easyMAG. A Negative Control, Viral Transport Media (VTM)
spiked with IC, was included for each extraction run. The Negative Control
serves to monitor for contamination during the testing procedure. The Influenza
A Subtyping RNA Control II (Positive Control) was included with each RT-
PCR run to test for global errors (absence of reagent, instrument failure, etc.).
The Positive Control does not require nucleic acid isolation.
The extracted nucleic acids were tested by RT-PCR in quintuplicate using one
lot of ProFAST+ Real Time Assay reagents on the Cepheid SmartCyler II. This
resulted in a total of 10 data points for each viral strain at each concentration
spiked with IC and 10 data points for each viral strain at each concentration
without the IC. The data were analyzed and the effects of competitive inhibition
due to the presence of the IC were assessed. Competitive inhibition was to be
considered if the difference in the LoD of the samples with and without IC was
greater than one log and the mean Ct for concentrations with and without IC
were greater than 3.3 CTs for all concentrations tested.

k. Competitive Inhibition Study
Effects of competitive inhibition on the ProFAST+ Assay when two of the
Assay’s target organisms are present in a single sample were not evaluated in a
Competitive Inhibition Study. However, multiple infections with different
subtypes of influenza A are rare. The prospective and retrospective clinical
studies conducted at four geographically diverse U.S. clinical laboratories for
this 510k submission included a total of 1002 NPS samples, of which 258 were
Influenza A positive samples. All of the 258 Influenza A positive samples
represented samples positive for only one influenza A subtype, and no true co-
infections of seasonal A/H1, A/H3 and A/2009 H1N1 was observed in the
clinical studies. Therefore, an analytical Competitive Inhibition Study to assess
the potential competition between Influenza A subtypes is not necessary.
l. Carry-Over Contamination:
To evaluate the degree of carry-over/cross-contamination that occurs with the
use of the ProFAST+ Assay in association with nucleic acid extraction on the
Roche MagNA Pure LC and the bioMérieux NucliSens easyMAG instruments
and PCR on the Cepheid SmartCycler II thermocycler, an internal Carry-Over
study was carried out by testing simulated human Influenza A (2009 H1N1
Influenza A) high positive samples run in series with A/2009 H1N1 high
negative samples over 5 runs. The High Positive samples consisted of negative
nasopharyngeal (NP ) swab matrix spiked with a concentration 3 logs above the
Limit of Detection (LoD) of a cultured and titered strain: Prodesse Influenza A
2009 H1N1 (Swine) Clinical Isolate #3. A maximum Ct value of 23 was
targeted for the High Positive samples as a Ct of 23 or lower represented the
lower end of the “clinical range” of the ProFAST+ Assay as seen in
development. High Negative samples consisted of negative NP swab matrix
spiked with a concentration of A/2009 H1N1 below the analytical LoD
concentration (3 logs below LoD) such that > 95% of samples should be
negative. The samples were processed and extracted in a High Positive/High
Negative alternating fashion (i.e. checkerboard pattern) on the extraction
instruments and likewise processed and run on the Cepheid SmartCycler II
instrument in an alternating fashion. Eleven (11) High Positive (HP) and 11
High Negative (HN) samples and a Negative Control were extracted per run on
the easyMAG and on the MagNA Pure LC for a total of 55 High Positive
samples and 55 High Negative samples over 5 runs for each extraction
instrument.

The results of this study demonstrated no evidence of carryover/cross-

alongside High Negative samples using the ProFAST+ Assay. 100% of the
High Positive and High Negative samples were accurately detected and the
mean Ct value for High Positive samples was ≤ 23 Ct (22.5).
m. Comparator/Reference Assays Analytical Validation Studies
The ProFAST+ Comparator/Reference Assays used as the comparison methods
to the ProFAST+ Assay for the ProFAST+ Clinical Study include three
independent 2-Step RT-PCR followed by b-directional sequencing assays which
target conserved regions of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of Seasonal A/H1,
Seasonal A/H3 and A/2009 H1N1 Influenza A (Swine-Origin) subtypes.
Although the gene target is the same as for the ProFAST+ Assay by necessity,
the primers for the comparator/reference assays target different regions of the
HA gene. The seasonal A/H1 target for the Reference Assay encompasses the
ProFAST+ target in the HA gene. Targeting a different region within the HA
gene was not possible due to the lack of conservation throughout the gene. The
primers for the A/H1 Reference Assay are located outside the region detected by
ProFAST+ resulting in detection of a total of 218 unique (additional) bases by
the Reference Assay. A total of 19 Seasonal A/H1, 14 Seasonal A/H3 and 8
A/2009 H1N1 Swine-Origin primer sets were initially designed to target
conserved regions of the Hemagglutinin (HA) gene. A single primer set for each
target was chosen based on conservation of primers to the Influenza A subtype
specific alignments generated from available sequences at NCBI, BLAST
analysis, amplicon length, melting temperature, hairpin/self dimerization of the
selected primers, and analytical performance as compared to the ProFAST+
Assay. Each Influenza A subtype PCR Supermix underwent optimization of
primer concentration, enzyme concentration and cycling parameters. The RT
mix which uses random hexamers and MuLV Reverse Transcriptase had been
previously optimized for reverse transcription for the Pro hMPV+ Reference
Assays, therefore, the same reagents and reactions conditions were used. PCR
product generated using the ProFAST+ Reference Assays were analyzed on the
Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer for the presence of the correct size band for each
Influenza A subtype.

The following analytical studies were independently performed for each of the
three comparators: Analytical Sensitivity, Reactivity and Analytical Specificity.
Analytical Sensitivity
The analytical sensitivity (limit of detection - LoD) of the ProFAST+
Comparator/Reference Assays was determined using two strains of each of the
three Influenza A subtypes (Seasonal H1, Seasonal H3 and 2009 H1N1
Influenza A(Swine-Origin)). The viral strains used in this study were cultured
and titered by an independent virology lab. Each virus was serially diluted and
spiked at concentrations of 2 logs above, 1 log above, at, and 1 log below the
expected LoD (as predetermined during assay development) into negative NP
swab matrix. Each viral dilution was tested in quintuplicate using the
appropriate Reference Assay (i.e. A/H1 virus dilution series was tested with the
A/H1 Reference Assay only) starting from sample extraction through RT-PCR.
Extraction was performed using the Roche MagNA Pure LC. Complementary
DNA (cDNA) was reverse transcribed from the extracted nucleic acid followed
by RT-PCR using the appropriate individual master mix for each subtype of
Influenza A. PCR products generated with the ProFAST+ Reference Assays
were analyzed using the Qiagen QIAxcel (capillary electrophoresis). Samples
demonstrating the appropriate size PCR product were confirmed by bi-
directional genetic sequencing and sequences verified using NCBI BLAST
Analysis (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi). A total of five data points per
virus concentration were generated. Analytical Sensitivity was determined to be
the lowest concentration of virus detected >95% of the time (5/5 replicates).
This concentration was then confirmed by preparing 20 additional replicates at
the proposed LoD concentration using the same negative NP swab matrix pool
as the Determination portion of the study. In the event that the initial LoD
concentration could not be confirmed (i.e. <19 replicates were not positive), the
LoD confirmation was repeated using the next log higher concentration. At least
95% of the 20 replicates were required to test positive by Qiagen QIAxcel and a
representative sample confirmed as positive by sequencing and BLAST Analysis
to confirm the LoD for each viral strain.
Detailed analytical sensitivity data for the reference assays are presented in the
following tables:

The following table shows the LoD comparison between the ProFAST+ Assay
and the Comparator/Reference Assays. The LoD of the seasonal A/H3 and
A/2009 H1N1 strains tested was the same for both the ProFAST+ Assay and
their respective Comparator/Reference Assay. The LoD for the seasonal A/H1
was 1.5 log and 0.5 log less sensitive with the A/H1 Comparator/Reference
Assay as compared to the ProFAST+ Assay.

Analytical Reactivity
The reactivity or inclusivity of the ProFAST+ Comparator/Reference Assays
was evaluated using multiple strains of Influenza A: 14 strains of seasonal H1,
14 strains of seasonal H3 and 8 strains of swine-origin (four 2009 H1N1 isolates
and 4 Swine-Origin). Viral strains were selected to include strains from 1933 to
the present, as well as from various geographical locations, to incorporate the
genetic variation that may be encountered during the ProFAST+ Clinical Study.
The panel included the same strains tested in the ProFAST+ Reactivity Study to
confirm detection of similar subtypes and strains. Remaining nucleic acid from
the ProFAST+ Assay Reactivity study was used or new dilutions and extractions
were made at a higher concentration and retested if necessary. The Reactivity
Panel consisted of cultured and titered strains of Influenza A, spiked with
Internal RNA Control and diluted in negative nasopharyngeal (NP) swab pool to
a concentration of 2x LoD of the ProFAST+ Assay and extracted on the Roche
MagNA Pure LC. Each sample was tested in duplicate reactions using the series
of Reference Assays. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was reverse transcribed
from the extracted nucleic acid using random hexamers and MuLV Reverse
Transcriptase. PCR followed using an individual master mix for each subtype of
Influenza A. The master mix contained the required components for PCR
(buffer, MgCl , dNTP’s, and Taq DNA Polymerase and subtype specific primer
2
set). The PCR product generated with the Reference Assay Supermixes was
analyzed for the appropriate sized product using the QIAGEN QIAxcel. A
single replicate at the lowest concentration as determined by the QIAxcel was
confirmed as positive for the appropriate subtype by bi-directional genetic
sequencing and NCBI BLAST analysis.
The majority of strains analyzed in this study tested positive by the
Comparator/Reference Assay as expected. The strains that tested negative
during pre-verification studies and were not expected to be reactive towards the
assay remained non-reactive. The following table summarizes the results:

Based on the analytical validations (i.e., sensitivity and reactivity), these
Comparator/Reference Assays performed equivalently to the ProFAST+
Assay for Analytical Sensitivity and Reactivity. They are therefore
acceptable methods to be used as a part of composite reference method in
determining “clinical diagnostic truth” for the ProFAST+ Clinical Trial.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable.
b. Matrix Description and Comparison:
Analytical performance of the ProFAST+ Assay using six different viral
transport media (VTM) was evaluated. Analytical sensitivity was determined
using cultured and titered strains of human Influenza A viruses (A/H1, A/H3,
and A/2009 H1N1) spiked into each of the six different VTMs.
The intended use of Remel M4, M5, and M6, Copan Universal Transport
Medium (UTM), and Becton Dickinson Universal Viral Transport (UVT) is for
the transport of clinical specimens containing viruses, chlamydiae, mycoplasma,
and ureaplasma from the collection site to the laboratory for microbiological
procedures. Remel M4RT VTM is for the transport of clinical specimens
containing viruses or chlamydiae, but is not recommended for the transport of
mycoplasmas and ureaplasmas. The VTMs have essentially the same
components as shown in the table below:

Two cultured and titered Influenza A viral isolates (A/H1 and A/2009 H1N1)
were spiked at LoD, and one, and two logs below the LoD and the A/H3 viral
isolate was spiked at one log above, at, and one log below LoD (as determined
in the ProFAST+ Analytical Sensitivity Study) into each VTM type. The testing
was performed at lower concentrations for A/H1 and A/2009 H1N1 because
initial testing at 1 log below the LoD (as determined in the ProFAST+
Analytical Sensitivity Study) resulted in 100% detection. Differences in
Analytical Sensitivity between NP swab matrix (as used in the Analytical
Sensitivity Study) and VTM alone (as used in the present study) are not unusual
and VTM alone typically results in a lower LoD.
All VTMs were compared to Remel M4 to determine equivalence because that
is the VTM used in all other analytical verification studies, including the
Analytical Sensitivity study, as well as by the majority of the Clinical Trial sites.
For a VTM to be considered equivalent to M4:
1. All three replicates for at least one concentration were required to be
positive and within one log of the lowest concentration in which all 3
replicates of M4 are positive.
2. The average CT values at all concentrations in which 3 of 3 replicates
are positive shall not differ by more than 3.3 CTs from the average CT
of that concentration diluted in M4. If the sample differs by more than
3.3 CTs the media will not be considered equivalent.
Each of the VTM performed “equivalently” to Remel M4 as they all met the
required criteria described above. Detailed data are presented in the following

3. Clinical studies:
a. Prospective Clinical studies
The clinical performance of the ProFAST+ Assay was established during
prospective studies at 4 U.S. clinical laboratories. NP swab samples were collected
and tested at three U.S. clinical laboratories (Sites 1, 2, and 4) during December
2009 thru May 2010. Due to the absence of seasonal (H1N1 or H3N2) and 2009
H1N1 Influenza A during the typical 2009-2010 winter season, prospectively
collected archived samples were also included in the prospective studies. These
samples were collected from January – March, 2008, February – March, 2009 and
October – November, 2009, and tested at two U.S. clinical laboratories (Sites 1 and
3). All specimens used in the study meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria
represented excess, remnants of nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens that were
prospectively collected from symptomatic individuals suspected of respiratory
infection, and were submitted for routine care or analysis by each site, and that
otherwise would have been discarded. Individual specimens were delinked from all
patient identifiers and given a study sample code. All clinical sites were granted
waivers of informed consent by their IRBs for this study. Inclusion criteria included,
but were not limited to: the specimen was from a symptomatic patient (for
respiratory infection) that was submitted for routine respiratory pathogen testing; the
specimen was a NP swab in appropriate viral transport media (i.e., Remel M4 or M5
viral transport medium); the specimen contained adequate volume for
comparator/reference methods and the ProFAST+ Assay; age and gender
information were available; specimen was stored properly (refrigerated at 2oC – 8oC
until nucleic acid extraction was performed within 72 hours of the sample collection
time. Or, samples were stored frozen at ≤ -70oC within 72 hours of collection until

processing through ProFAST+ and comparator/reference assays); and initiation of
the ProFAST+ Assay (nucleic acid extraction) took place within 72 hours of sample
collection, or samples were frozen at ≤-70oC within 72 hours.
The specimens and controls ( underwent nucleic acid extraction using the
bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG Instrument using bioMérieux NucliSENS
easyMAG reagents (Sites 1 and 3) or using the Roche MagNA Pure LC Instrument
using the Total Nucleic Acid Isolation kit (Sites 2 and 4). Purified nucleic acids
were tested with the ProFAST+ Assay and the ProFlu+ Assay on the Cepheid
SmartCycler II. (Note: Purified nucleic acids were further processed immediately
following extraction or were stored frozen (≤-70oC) and thawed prior to ProFAST+
Assay and ProFlu+ Assay set-up). Remaining nucleic acids and original samples
were sent back to Gen-Probe Prodesse for sequencing analysis.
Reverse transcription was performed on remaining nucleic acids that had been
stored at ≤ -70oC. PCR was performed on the resulting cDNA using all three
Comparator/Reference Assays and the PCR products were analyzed by capillary
electrophoresis (QIAxcel, QIAGEN). PCR products with the appropriate base pair
band size were sent for further analysis by genetic sequencing. Sequencing results
that met acceptance criteria (>100 contiguous bases, QV score (i.e., PHRED) > 20,
E-value scores <1e-20) for both the forward and reverse primer were recorded as
positive for the specific Influenza A subtype.
Performance of the ProFAST+ Assay was compared to the composite
comparator/reference method of the FDA cleared ProFlu+ Assay IVD (K081030)
and individual well characterized Influenza A subtype specific RT-PCR assays
followed by bi-directional sequencing. The sequencing assays targeted different
regions of the hemagglutinin gene than the ProFAST+ Assay and were specific for
each of the Influenza A subtypes (A/H1, A/H3, and A/2009 H1N1). “True” seasonal
A/H1, A/H3 or A/2009 H1N1 RNA positives, were considered as any sample that
was tested positive for Influenza A by the ProFlu+ Assay IVD, and had bi-
directional sequencing data meeting pre-defined quality acceptance criteria, for both
the forward and the reverse sequences that matched seasonal A/H1, A/H3, and
A/2009 H1N1 sequences deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) GenBank database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), respectively, with
acceptable E-values. “True” seasonal A/H1, A/H3 or A/2009 H1N1 RNA negatives
were considered as any sample that was tested negative for Influenza A by the
ProFlu+ Assay IVD, or any sample that was tested positive for Influenza A by the
ProFlu+ Assay IVD, but was tested negative by the respective Influenza A subtype
specific RT-PCR assay. The E-values generated from the clinical trial range from a
low of <1e-180 to a high of 2e-35. The E-Value from NCBI BLAST Alignment
indicates the statistical significance of a given pair-wise alignment and reflects the
size of the database and the scoring system used. The lower the E-Value, the more
significant the hit. A sequence alignment that has an E-Value of 1e-3 means that
this similarity has a 1 in 1000 chance of occurring by chance alone.
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=handbook.section.614).

Therefore an E-Value ranging from <2e-35 to 1e-180 has a very low probability of
occurring purely by chance.
The overall assay failure rate of the ProFAST+ Assay during the clinical trials (both
the prospective and the retrospective trials) due to failure of Positive, Negative or
Extraction Controls not related to procedural errors was 4.0% (total of 3 of 75 runs
across all 4 sites). Two of the run failures were due to the Negative Control
contamination (one run at Site 3 and one run at Site 4). The other invalid run was
due to the PC failure (none of the analytes were detected) and it is hypothesized that
the PC was mistakenly not added to the ProFAST+ master mix. All samples, the
Negative Control and the Extraction Control were re-run using the ProFAST+
Assay starting from the purified nucleic acid and repeat test results were “Valid”.
A total of 874 prospective NP swab specimens were initially included in the
prospective clinical trial (400 samples from Site 1, 129 samples from Site 2, 300
samples from Site 3, and 45 samples from Site 4). Thirty two (32) samples (18
samples from Site 1, 10 samples from Site 2, 2 samples from Site 3, and 2 samples
from Site 4) were excluded from the prospective clinical study data analysis because
they remained “Unresolved” after repeat testing for either the ProFlu+ Assay
(comparator assay), or the ProFAST+ Assay, or both assays, resulted in a total 842
eligible prospective specimens to be included in the prospective clinical study data
analysis.
Of the ProFAST+ Assay run on all prospective specimens, 98.9% (864/874) of these
specimens were successful on the first attempt (Site 1: 392/400 = 98.0%; Site 2:
128/129 = 99.2%; Site 3: 299/300 = 99.7%; Site 4: 45/45 = 100%). The remaining
10 (10/874 = 1.1%) gave “Unresolved” results on the first attempt (8 from Site 1, 1
from Site 2, 1 from Site 3, and none from Site 4). Unresolved results occur when
the sample is negative for all three Influenza A subtype markers and the Internal
Control, indicating potentially PCR-inhibiting samples. Of the 10 “Unresolved”
specimens on the first attempt with sufficient sample for retest, only 50.0% (5/10)
gave a valid result on the second attempt (3 from Site 1, 1 from site 2, and 1 from
Site 3). The remaining 5 were “Unresolved” on the second attempt.

The general demographic data for all eligible prospective specimens (N=842) are

Female 403/842 (47.9%)

≥ 65 years 51/842 (6.0%)
b. Retrospective Clinical studies
In addition to the prospective clinical studies, two clinical sites (Site 2 and site 4)
also performed testing using retrospective samples that were collected from January
– March, 2008, January – November 2009, and March 2010. The ProFAST+ Assay
was compared to the same composite comparator/reference method that was
employed for the prospective study to determine clinical Percent Positive
Agreement and Percent Negative Agreement. A total of 160 retrospective
nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples were included in the retrospective studies (60
samples at Site 2 and 100 samples at site 4). The E-values generated from the
retrospective clinical trial range from a low of <1e-180 to a high of 7e-45. The E-
Value from NCBI BLAST Alignment indicates the statistical significance of a given
pair-wise alignment and reflects the size of the database and the scoring system
used. The lower the E-Value, the more significant the hit. A sequence alignment
that has an E-Value of 1e-3 means that this similarity has a 1 in 1000 chance of
occurring by chance alone.
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=handbook.section.614).
Therefore an E-Value ranging from 7e-45 to <1e-180 has a very low probability of
occurring purely by chance.
These data were analyzed separately from the prospective samples and are
summarized in the following tables by site and by influenza A subtype:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
In the prospective ProFAST+ Assay clinical study, a total of 842 eligible prospective
nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens were tested from four U.S. clinical laboratories
across the United States. Of the total of 842 eligible NP swab samples, 257 were
collected and tested at three U.S. clinical laboratories (Sites 1, 2, and 4) during
December 2009 thru May 2010. Due to the absence of seasonal (H1N1 or H3N2) and
2009 H1N1 Influenza A during the typical 2009-2010 winter season, a total of 585
prospectively collected archived NP swab samples were also included in the
prospective studies. Of the total of 585 prospectively collected archived NP swab
samples, 195 samples were collected from January – March, 2008; 196 samples were
collected from February – March, 2009; and 194 samples were collected from
October – November, 2009. The prospectively collected archived NP swab samples
were tested at two U.S. clinical laboratories (Sites 1 and 3).
The number and percentage of seasonal A/H1, seasonal A/H3 and A/2009 H1N1
RNA positive cases as determined by the ProFAST+ Assay, calculated by age group
and prospective sample collection time period, are presented in the following table:

O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Cepheid Smart Cycler II Real Time instrument with Dx software version 1.7b or
3.0a or 3.0b is used to perform real time reverse transcription, PCR amplification and
detection of nucleic acid. Seven other nucleic acid amplification tests that use the
Smart Cycler II instrument have received 510(k) clearance: Prodesse’s ProParaflu+
Assay (K091053), ProGastro Cd Assay (K090239), ProhMPV+ Assay (K082688) and
ProFlu+ Assay (K081030), IDI-MRSA test (K033415), the IDI-Strep B Assay
(K022504), and the Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Primer
and Probe Set (K060159). The Cepheid SmartCycler instrument is an integrated
nucleic acid amplification and detection instrument system based on Cepheid’s
proprietary microprocessor-controlled I-CORE module. For purified RNA samples,
the SmartCycler instrument enables reverse-transcriptase (RT) to transcribe target
viral RNA into cDNA, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the amplification of
cDNA, and hybridization of fluorogenic target-specific probes for the detection of the
amplified cDNA.
The Roche MagNA Pure LC is an automated nucleic acid isolation and purification
system based upon binding of nucleic acids to glass particles and has the capability to
process a total of 32 reactions within one run. Nucleic acid is purified in multiple
plastic reaction tips and cartridges by several steps that include cell lysis and binding
of nucleic acid to magnetic glass particles, wash steps, and a heated elution to unbind
the nucleic acid from the glass particles. Six other tests that use the Roche MagNA

Pure LC system have received 510(k) clearance: Prodesse’s ProParaflu+ Assay
(K091053), ProGastro Cd Assay (K090239), ProhMPV+ Assay (K082688) and
ProFlu+ Assay (K081030), Roche Factor V Leiden Kit (K033607) and the Roche
Factor II (Prothrombin) G20210A Kit (K033612).
The bioMérieux NucliSens easyMAG is an automated nucleic acid isolation and
purification system that is based upon the same silica extraction technology as the
MagNA Pure. The easyMAG is capable of processing a total of 24 reactions with
variable sample types, sample volumes, and elution volumes within a single run.
Nucleic acid is purified within a single cartridge by several steps that include lysis and
binding of nucleic acid to high affinity magnetic silica beads, a series of wash steps
and heated elution of purified nucleic acid from the silica beads. Prodesse’s ProFlu+
Assay (K081030) that received Special 510(k) clearance and Prodesse’s ProhMPV+
Assay (K082688), ProGastro Cd Assay (K090239) and ProParaflu+ (K091053) also
use the easyMAG system for automated nucleic acid extraction.

Yes ____X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
User enters Patient ID/Sample ID by typing it in.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Not applicable
5. Calibration:
Not applicable
6. Quality Control:
Positive Control (PC): The ProFAST+ Assay kit contains an Influenza A Subtyping
positive RNA control that consists of one pool of three RNA transcripts (specific for
each Influenza A subtype: A/H1, A/H3 and A/2009 H1N1). These transcripts are
derived from plasmids containing the viral sequences of interest and are not intact
virus particles. The Influenza A Subtyping PC contains equal amounts of A/H1, A/H3
and A/2009 H1N1. The approximate concentration of each transcript was
5x103copies/µl. The PC does not go through nucleic acid isolation and purification,
but is included during set-up of the RT-PCR reaction. The PC in conjunction with the
IC is used to verify reagent and system performance. The PC is meant to be a control
55

for global failure of the assay (missing reaction component, instrument failure, etc).
Internal Control (IC): An Internal RNA Control, a non-infectious RNA transcript, is
incorporated into every sample and is carried through all steps of the procedure from
nucleic acid isolation and purification through amplification to monitor for inhibitors
present in the specimen or reaction tube. The IC also serves as a general process
control ensuring that each step of the procedure was performed correctly, assay and
instrument parameters were set correctly, and that general reagents were working. The
IC is meant to assess global failure (reagent or process) and monitor for PCR
inhibition.
Negative Control (NC): A Negative Control (NC) is not provided with the kit, but is
required and described in the ProFAST+ Assay Instructions for Use. Viral transport
media spiked with the IC is to be used as the negative control and processed starting
from nucleic acid isolation. The negative control serves to monitor for contamination.
Extraction Control (EC): An Extraction Control (EC) is not provided with the kit,
however, during the clinical trial, a pool of seasonal A/H1N1, seasonal A/H3N2 and
2009 H1N1 influenza viruses was included with each nucleic acid isolation run. The
EC served to monitor for lysis during nucleic acid isolation. The sponsor is also
recommending an extraction control in each nucleic acid extraction run to the
end users in the package insert.
