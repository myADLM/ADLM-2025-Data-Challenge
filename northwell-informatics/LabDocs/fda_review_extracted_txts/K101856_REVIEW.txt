I. Device Description:
The Elecsys CEA CalCheck 5 kit consist of 5 levels of human CEA, each with the
appropriate lyophilized level of human CEA antigen in human serum matrix. During
manufacture, the analyte CEA is spiked into the matrix at the desired concentration
levels. Level 1 contains no analyte. Sponsor recommends using Check levels 2, 3 and
4 for calibration verification only; and Check 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 for verification of the

L. Test Principle:
Per sponsor: Calibration verification is not a requirement of the Elecsys and cobas e
immunoassay systems based on the manufacturer’s recommendations.
However, in instances where such a test procedure is required by certification
agencies, or where the user wishes to document calibration verification, these
CalCheck 5 solutions provide an appropriate material for such testing.

range of the assay. Samples from each level was run 1 time a day on 4
MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 and 4 Elecsys 2010 analyzers for a total of 2
days. The difference between the target and assigned value was less than
10%. A master calibration curve is generated on the E170 master calibration
curve and used to calculate ng/mL from counts. The table below summarizes
the Assigned Values and Ranges for Elecsys CA 19-9 CalCheck 5 on the
E170 :
Target Value Assigned Value

Stability:
Stability studies were done on the Elecsys E170.
Open vial stability:
One Elecsys CEA CalCheck 5 lot was evaluated in duplicate on the Elecsys
E170. The claimed reconstituted Elecsys CEA CalCheck 5 is stable for 4
hours at 20-25°C.
On Board Stability:
Not applicable
Accelerated stability & Real time stability:
One Elecsys CEA CalCheck 5 lot was evaluated in duplicate on the Elecsys
E170. The test material was stored lyophilized at 35°C for 3 weeks. The
reference material was a freshly reconstituted set of CalChecks, stored at 4°C.
After 3 weeks, the test and reference materials were tested in duplicate and
compared.
Real-time stability study is ongoing. The shelf life stability is based on the
accelerated stability study of the CalCheck 5 and the real-time stability studies
of three-level CalCheck (because of the identical composition of the 3-level
and 5-level CalChecks). The initial shelf life stability claim is 18 months
when stored at 2-8°C.
d. Dilution study:
The CEA CalCheck 5 package insert instructs the customer to analyze diluted
samples in the event CalCheck Levels 1 or 5 produce results that exceed the
reportable measuring range of the assay. To demonstrate that the values are
within the assay’s measuring range of 0.2-1000 ng/mL after mixing, the
following dilution study was performed: Check 1&2 and Check4 &5 were
mixed in a 1:1 ratio and measured in duplicate. Results of a dilution study
are summarized in the table below:
