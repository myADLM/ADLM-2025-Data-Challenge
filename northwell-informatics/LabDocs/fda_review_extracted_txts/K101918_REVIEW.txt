1. Intended use(s):
The QuickVue RSV 10 test is an immunoassay that allows for the rapid, qualitative
detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) antigen directly from nasopharyngeal
swab and nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash specimens for symptomatic pediatric patients
(less than six years old). The test is intended for use as an aid in the rapid diagnosis of
acute RSV infection. Negative results do not preclude RSV infection and should not
be used as the sole basis for treatment or for other management decisions. A negative
test is presumptive. It is recommended that negative test results be confirmed by cell
culture. The test is intended for professional and laboratory use.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as intended use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription use
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable
I. Device Description:
The QuickVue RSV 10 test employs lateral flow immunoassay technology. Using this
test allows for the rapid detection of RSV antigens.
To begin the test, a lyophilized reagent must be rehydrated in the reagent tube. This
reagent facilitates exposure of the appropriate viral antigens to the antibodies used in the
test. For a liquid specimen such as a nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash, the specimen is added
directly to the reagent tube and rehydrates the reagent. When nasopharyngeal swabs are
used, the reagent is first rehydrated with the provided reagent solution and the swab
specimen is then inserted into the reagent tube. This reagent interacts with the specimen
and facilitates exposure of the appropriate viral antigens to the antibodies used in the test.
The test strip is added to the reagent tube now containing the specimen and reagent
solution.
If the extracted specimen contains RSV antigens, a pink-to-red test line, along with a blue
procedural control line will appear on the test strip indicating a positive result. If RSV
antigen is not present, or is present at very low levels, only a blue procedural control line
will appear.

L. Test Principle:
The QuickVue RSV 10 test employs lateral flow immunoassay technology. Using this
test allows for the rapid detection of RSV antigens.
To begin the test, a lyophilized reagent must be rehydrated in the reagent tube. This
reagent facilitates exposure of the appropriate viral antigens to the antibodies used in the
test. For a liquid specimen such as a nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash, the specimen is added
directly to the reagent tube and rehydrates the reagent. When nasopharyngeal swabs are
used, the reagent is first rehydrated with the provided reagent solution and the swab
specimen is then inserted into the reagent tube. This reagent interacts with the specimen
and facilitates exposure of the appropriate viral antigens to the antibodies used in the test.
The test strip is added to the reagent tube now containing the specimen and reagent
solution.
If the extracted specimen contains RSV antigens, a pink-to-red test line, along with a blue
procedural control line will appear on the test strip indicating a positive result. If RSV
antigen is not present, or is present at very low levels, only a blue procedural control line
will appear.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
ANALYTICAL SENSITIVITY AND LIMIT OF DETECTION
The QuickVue RSV 10 test was shown to detect two different isolates of RSV A
and one isolate of RSV B. In a separate experiment, the limit of detection was
determined to be approximately 7.9 x 103 TCID /mL for RSV A and 8.3 x 103
50
TCID /mL for RSV B.
50
ANALYTICAL SPECIFICITY AND CROSS REACTIVITY
A total of thirty-four (34) bacterial and fungal and thirty-five (35) viral isolates
were tested in triplicate in the QuickVue RSV 10 test. None (i.e., 0/34
bacterial/fungal and 0/35 viral isolates) of the microorganisms tested at the levels
indicated showed any sign of cross-reactivity in the assay. Flow of the sample and
appearance of the Control Line were also not affected. These results (Tables 2 and
3) confirm high immunological specificity of the QuickVue RSV 10 test.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device: Not applicable
b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable
3. Clinical studies:
The performance of the QuickVue RSV 10 test was compared to viral cell culture
methods and DFA in a multi-center clinical study during the RSV season in the United
States. This study was performed by professional health care personnel at four distinct
sites in various geographical regions within the United States. In this multi-center field
trial, nasopharyngeal swabs and nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash specimens were collected
from seven hundred nine (709) patients. Three hundred seventy-eight (378) provided a
nasopharyngeal swab specimen and three hundred thirty-one (331) provided a
nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash specimen. All clinical samples were collected from
symptomatic patients (5 years of age and younger). 60% were male and 40% were
female.
On-site testing of one nasopharyngeal swab specimen, or a portion of nasopharyngeal
aspirate/wash specimen, was performed by physician office personnel with the QuickVue
RSV 10 test. All samples were freshly collected and tested. The remaining sample was
placed in viral transport media. Cell culture was performed either at the laboratory of the
test site or at a local, readily accessible virus laboratory. Cells were inoculated with the
specimen, incubated at 35-37°C for 16-72 hours, and then removed from culture and
tested for RSV by direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining.
Results with Nasopharyngeal Aspirate/Wash Specimens
Nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash specimens from three hundred thirty-one (331) patients
were tested in QuickVue RSV 10 and in cell culture. The QuickVue RSV 10 test
correctly identified 90% (62/69) RSV culture-positive specimens and 96% (251/262)
RSV culture-negative specimens. These results are shown in Table 4.

REPRODUCIBILITY STUDIES
The reproducibility of the QuickVue RSV 10 test was evaluated at five different
laboratories, one of which was Quidel. Three different operators at each site tested a
series of coded, contrived samples, ranging from high negative to moderate positive.
Each had been carefully seeded with graded doses of RSV. The inter-laboratory
agreement (Table 6) for negative samples was 99.3 to 100% and 99.1 – 99.8% for
positive samples. The intra-laboratory agreement (Table 7) for all samples ranged from
99.2 to 100%.
