L. Test Principle:
An immunometric immunoassay technique is used, which involves the simultaneous reaction
of PTH present in the sample with a biotinylated antibody (goat polyclonal anti-PTH39-84)
and a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled antibody conjugate (goat polyclonal anti-PTH1-
34). The antigen-antibody complex is captured by streptavidin on the wells. Unbound
materials are removed by washing. The bound HRP conjugate is measured by a luminescent
reaction. A reagent containing luminogenic substrates (a luminol derivative and a peracid
salt) and an electron transfer agent is added to the wells. The HRP in the bound conjugate
catalyzes the oxidation of the luminol derivative, producing light. The electron transfer agent
(a substituted acetanilide) increases the level of light produced and prolongs its emission. The
light signals are read by the system. The amount of HRP conjugate bound is directly
proportional to the concentration of PTH present in the sample.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Study Protocol:
Precision was evaluated following CLSI guideline EP5-A2. Two replicates of each of 3
freeze-dried control samples and 6 patient serum sample pools were tested on 2 separate
runs per day for 20 different days. When spiking synthetic PTH into a patient sample
pool, the spike solution made up no more than 5% of the total volume of the patient
sample being spiked.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Study Protocol:
Linearity was evaluated following CLSI guideline EP6-A on 2 VITROS ECi/ECiQ
Immunodiagnostic Systems and 1 VITROS 5600 Integrated System. Altered serum pool
samples were used for the studies. The low pool was an endogenous serum sample
stripped for PTH and had an estimated PTH concentration of 2.0 pg/mL. The high pool
was either an endogenous patient pool (estimated PTH concentration 700 pg/mL) or a
patient pool spiked with synthetic PTH (estimated PTH concentration 5500 pg/mL). For
the whole range study, the spiked high serum pool and the low serum pool were mixed to
give 11 additional pools of intermediate concentrations spanning the range of 2.0 - 5500
pg/mL. For the clinical relevant range study, the endogenous patient pool and the low
serum pool were mixed to give 11 additional pools of intermediate concentrations
spanning the range of 2.0 - 700 pg/mL.
Result Summary:
Statistical evaluations for both studies using polynomial regression indicate that the data
were best fitted by a 3rd order regression with less than 10% bias from the linear fitted
results.
Conclusion:
Based on the linearity results, the sponsor claimed that the assay is linear from 3.4 pg/mL
to 5000 pg/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Calibration of the VITROS Intact PTH test is traceable to in-house reference calibrators,
which value have been assigned to correlate to the predicate device, the Roche Elecsys
PTH.

Calibration Interval:
Stability across a 28 day calibration interval was assessed by calculating the percentage
bias of the precision samples on each day from the result obtained for that precision
samples from the calibration on the first day. The results support the product claim of a 28-
day calibration interval.
Value Assignment:
· Calibrators: The in-house reference calibrators, which values have been assigned to
correlate to the predicate device, were used to generate the master calibration curve.
The lot specific calibrator value was determined as the mean of 20 assays per master
lot, using 2 VITROS ECi/ECiQ Immunodiagnostic Systems and 1 VITROS 5600
Integrated System.
· Range Verifiers: The acceptance criterion for the Low Range Verifier is <3.4 pg/mL,
for the High Range Verifier is 4000-5500 pg/mL.
· Controls: The target values are 25, 75 and 500 pg/mL. The lot specific range was
assigned as mean ± 3 SD. The Mean and SD was calculated from 32 test results (2
tests per run, 5 or 6 runs per kit lot, using 3 kit lots and at least 2 VITROS systems).

d. Detection limit:
Study Protocol:
Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) were
determined following CLSI guideline EP17-A on 2 VITROS ECi/ECiQ
Immunodiagnostic Systems and 1 VITROS 5600 Integrated System.
For LoB determination, 10 replicates of the zero calibrator buffer were run on 2
occasions per day for 5 days, assessed from three calibrations (days 1, 3 and 5) – giving
100 determinations in total.
For LoD determination, 10 replicates of each of five LoD pools were run on 2 occasions
per day for 5 days across three calibrations (days 1, 3 and 5) – giving 100 determinations
of each pool in total. The five LoD pools were made by diluting an endogenous patient
pool in the zero calibrator buffer used for the Limit of Blank to give estimated iPTH
concentrations of 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0 and 4.5pg/mL.
For LoQ determination, two additional pools with estimated iPTH concentrations of 5.0
and 5.5 pg/mL were included in addition to the 5 pools used in the LoD study. The level
of imprecision used to accept the LoQ was within 20%.
Result Summary:
The following detection limit claims were made based on the worst case results:
LoB LoD LoQ
1.2 pg/mL 2.8 pg/mL 3.4 pg/mL
e. Analytical specificity:
· Interference
Study Protocol:
The sponsor evaluated the effect of the interfering substances on 2 VITROS ECi/ECiQ
Immunodiagnostic Systems and 1 VITROS 5600 Integrated System using a patient
serum pool with endogenous PTH between 20 and 80 pg/mL. For each substance, two
aliquots of this pool were thawed, one spiked with the test substance up to the maximum
level shown below, and the other spiked with the solvent (control). The PTH results
(mean of 12 replicates) of the paired pools were compared and % interference was
calculated using the following equation:
% Interference = (Mean of test substance pool) - (Mean of “control” pool) x 100
Mean of “control” pool
Result Summary:
Based on the sponsor-defined interference limit of ± 10%, the following claims were

· Cross-Reactivity
Study Protocol:
The sponsor evaluated cross-reactivity by using the zero calibrator buffer as the test
matrix. This calibrator had a PTH concentration below the Limit of Blank. Three
determinations of each cross-reactant and corresponding “control” were carried out
with each of the two reagent lots using 3 VITROS Immunodiagnostic Systems (2
VITROS ECi/ECiQ Immunodiagnostic Systems and 1 VITROS 5600 Integrated
System). % Cross-reactivity was calculated using the following the equation:
% Cross-reactivity = Mean iPTH of the Cross-Reactant pool x 100
Concentration of Cross-Reactant
Result Summary:
Based on the sponsor-defined % Cross-reactivity limit of 0.01%, none of the tested
substances (except PTH 7-84) at the indicated concentration would cross react
significantly with the proposed assay.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Study Protocol:
A total of 456 patient serum samples from a commercial vendor were used in the method
comparison studies. These samples cover a variety of clinical categories
(Hypoparathyroidism, Hyperparathyroidism, Chronic Renal Failures, Hypercalcemia of
Malignancies and random donors). To cover the upper measuring range of the proposed
iPTH assay, 21 patient samples were spiked with different concentrations of synthetic
iPTH with target concentrations between 200 pg/ml and 4750 pg/ml. Regression analysis
was performed between each of the VITROS systems ( 5600 and ECi/ECiQ) and the
Predicate.
Result Summary:
The Result of Passing Bablok Regression analysis is summarized in the below Table.
Instrument N Range Slope Intercept r
(pg/mL)
VITROS 5600 vs. Predicate 412 3.5-4556 1.01 +0.5 0.99
VITROS ECi/ECiQ vs. Predicate 204 4.0-4751 1.05 -1.33 0.99
Conclusion:
Based on the regression analysis result, the sponsor claimed equivalency to the predicate
assay.
b. Matrix comparison:
Study Protocol:
The matrix effect of various blood collection tubes on fresh and stored serum or plasma
samples were evaluated. 40 apparently healthy volunteers were enrolled in the study. For
each study participant, blood was collected into each of the following tube types: serum-
plain glass, serum-plastic, lithium heparin plasma plastic, sodium heparin plasma plastic,

EDTA plasma plastic, SST plastic and lithium heparin PST plastic. To cover the entire
measuring range of the assay, an additional 10 test samples were created by spiking
different volumes of a synthetic PTH stock solution into 500 μl of serum or plasma samples
from 10 patients. Aliquots from 40 endogenous samples and 10 spiked samples were
made from the respective primary tubes and tested for various storage conditions.
Differences in PTH values (mean of three singlet determinations on VITROS 5600 and
ECi/ECiQ system 1 and 2) between serum (glass) and each of the other six collection tubes
on freshly collected samples were evaluated using Bias plots and correlation graphs.
To evaluate the effect of various storage conditions on PTH, % Difference was calculated
using the following equation:
% Difference = Test Condition - Baseline Condition x 100

2. To demonstrate equivalence at the low dose iPTH range (3.4 – 20 pg/ml), the sponsor
presented data from the method comparison study showing that the 95% confidence
intervals for EDTA plasma and serum samples overlap, and there is no statistical
difference between the two collection devices, see below:
Sample Type N Slope (95% CI) Intercept (95% CI) Range of Samples (pg/mL)
Serum 134 0.97 -0.16 6.4 to 18.4
(0.88 to 1.07) (-1.66 to 1.25)
Plasma 34 1.04 1.26 3.6 to 20.5
(0.78 to 1.36) (-0.80 to 3.12)
3. To address the concern regarding performance in serum separator tubes and other
collection devices at the low end of the measuring range, the sponsor has conducted an
additional study on twenty samples (see below table). This data suggests that the position
of the intercept on the y-axis can be significantly increased by including sample values up
to the top of the measuring range. The study also suggests that intercepts of +9.0 or
+10.0 (seen in the original study) are not expected when assessing sample data around the
normal range:

Conclusion: Based on the study results, the sponsor has included the following
precautions in the Instructions for Use for collection devices:
Special Precautions
IMPORTANT: Intact PTH is labile and susceptible to fragmentation. Correct handling of
patient samples is necessary to ensure that the PTH molecule remains intact. The degree
of fragmentation will depend on both time and temperature of storage.
Specimen Collection, Preparation and Storage
Specimen types should not be used interchangeably during the serial monitoring of
an individual patient as measured concentrations may vary slightly between sample
types.
Certain collection devices have been reported to affect other analytes and tests.
Owing to the variety of specimen collection devices available, Ortho Clinical
Diagnostics is unable to provide a definitive statement on the performance of its
products with these devices. Confirm that your collection devices are compatible with
this test. Storage of samples collected and stored in serum separator tubes for more
than one day may result in a decrease in concentration of up to 20%.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
The sponsor evaluated the proposed iPTH assay for its intraoperative applicability in 39
patients who underwent parathyroid surgery. Samples from 20 patients were sourced in
the U.S.; samples from 19 patients were sourced in the E.U. The number of samples per
patient was not pre-established but was decided during surgery and based on the observed
decrease in PTH concentration. The study used the generally accepted guidelines that a
>50% decrease in PTH value from baseline suggests complete tumor removal.
31 out of 39 sample series showed a post operative drop of >50% in the intact PTH
values. For all 39 samples the VITROS Intact PTH assay results were similar to the
reference method values.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
240 archived serum samples with normal Calcium, TSH, Creatinine and Vitamin D
values were used to determine the reference range of this assay. These samples were
obtained from commercial vendors or hospital laboratories sourced in the U.S. to
represent a US population.
The samples were assayed across the instrument platforms using two reagent lots as
shown below. The reference interval is the central 95% of the iPTH results.
Instrument Reagent Lot Number of Reference
Samples Interval
VITROS ECi/ECiQ System 1 7 60 7.5 to 53.5
VITROS ECi/ECiQ System 2 8 60 pg/mL
VITROS 5600 System 1 7 60
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
