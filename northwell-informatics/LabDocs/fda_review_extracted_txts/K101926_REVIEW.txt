L. Test Principle:
The FORA D40d/FORA Wisdom D40d Blood Glucose plus Blood Pressure
Monitoring uses electrochemical methodologies. This system quantitatively measures
blood glucose levels using an amperometric method, which involves detecting the
current produced from glucose oxidation. The electrons generated during this reaction
are transferred from the blood to the electrodes. The magnitude of the resultant
current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the specimen and the signal
is converted into a readout displayed on the meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed precision studies in accordance with the ISO 15197
and CLSI EP-5A. Venous whole blood adjusted to 5 glucose levels with
hematocrit ~45% was used for within-day precision studies. Each
concentration was tested 10 times each on 10 meters, using 3 test strip lots, for
a total of 300 tests per blood glucose level. Results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor performed linearity studies using whole blood samples with 11
different glucose concentration ranges (from ~10 to ~780 mg/dL). Testing
was performed using the FORA D40d/ FORA Wisdom D40d Blood Glucose
plus Blood Pressure Monitoring Systems and the YSI-2300 glucose analyzer
(reference method). Three lots of test strips were used in the study. Linear
regression analysis for each test strip lot is summarized below:
Lot 1 y = 0.9621x + 5.6476, r2 = 0.9975
Lot 2 y = 0.9514x + 7.1043, r2 = 0.9973
Lot 3 y = 0.9605x + 6.0252, r2 = 0.9971
The measuring range of the FORA D40d/ FORA Wisdom D40d Blood
Glucose plus Blood Pressure Monitoring System is 20 - 600 mg/dL.

The method comparison was performed using the proposed device and YSI
2300 glucose analyzer.
Controls: The 3-level control solutions were originally cleared in k093724.
However, values of these Control Solutions specific for use with the FORA
D40d/ FORA Wisdom D40d Blood Glucose plus Blood Pressure Monitoring
System, were established by repeat analysis using 25 FORA D40d/ FORA
Wisdom D40d Blood Glucose plus Blood Pressure Monitoring devices and 25
corresponding test strips. The mean and standard deviation are used to
establish the acceptable range for the strips.
Calibration: no calibration is required by the user.
Stability:
Storage Stability Study: The storage claim for this device is: 90 days for open
vial of test strips and controls stored at 39 – 104 oF (4 – 40 °C) and 24 months
for unopened vials of strips and controls stored at 39 – 104 oF. The study
protocols (accelerated testing and real time studies), summary of results and
acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be adequate.
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the devices is 20-600 mg/dL. This range was
validated via the linearity study (see section M.1.b.).
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed interference studies with spiked venous blood samples
at three glucose concentrations (~70, 120 and 300 mg/dL) that were prepared
and divided into a test (dosed) pool and a control pool. The potential
interferants were added to the sample, tested at least at two concentrations
(therapeutic/normal and above therapeutic/toxic) and each sample was
analyzed in duplicate using 4 FORA D40d/ FORA Wisdom D40d Blood
Glucose plus Blood Pressure Monitoring Systems. The table below lists all

3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied
directly to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger and
other alternate sites (palm, forearm, and upper-arm only). Since the whole blood
sample is applied directly to the test strip, there are no special handling or storage
issues.
5. Calibration:
No calibration is required by the user. The meter accommodates auto-coding, in
that each strip is designed and manufactured to code the meter appropriately when
the strip is inserted.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor has three levels of controls that are not provided with the device, but
can be purchased separately. When a test strip is inserted into the meter, each
control can be measured by following the instructions for “Performing a Control
Solution Test” provided in the User’s Manuals for the meters. An acceptable
range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. If the test results
fall outside the range printed on the test strip vial, the user is instructed to contact
the Customer Care Line at 1-866-469-2632 for customer support. The Customer
Care service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. These devices are intended for single-patient use (FORA D40d) and multiple-
patient use (FORA Wisdom D40d). Disinfection studies (viral efficacy studies) were
performed by an outside service to evaluate the virus elimination effectiveness of
disinfecting wipes in preventing the spread of bloodborne pathogens, particularly
hepatitis B virus (HBV). Specifically, Micro-Kill+ cleaner disinfectant towels (with
EPA registration # 59894-10-37549) were validated demonstrating complete
inactivation of live virus. The sponsor does not market a lancing device for use with
the device. The sponsor also performed robustness studies and demonstrated that
there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the meters after
10,000 cleaning and disinfection cycles designed to simulate 5 years (5 cleaning and
disinfection cycles per day) of single-patient device use or 3 years of multiple-patient
use with cleaning and disinfecting after each patient up to 9 uses per day. In addition,
the sponsor provided a risk analysis specific to the potential harm due to infection.
Labeling has been reviewed for adequate instructions in validated cleaning and
disinfection procedures.
2. Hematocrit Study: A study to evaluate the effect of hematocrit was conducted on
samples with 9 glucose concentrations spanning the range of 20-600 mg/dL at 9
hematocrit levels (20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60%). Each glucose
level/hematocrit combination was tested in duplicates of 6 using one test strip lot.
The results from this study were within ±15% individual bias, supporting the claimed
hematocrit range of 20-60%. Results of samples at each hematocrit level were
compared to samples with the same glucose concentration at normal (40%)
hematocrit as well as to the corresponding YSI value. All individual results for each
meter type were ±15% of the YSI, supporting the claimed hematocrit range of 20-
60%
3. Altitude Study: An altitude study was performed in an altitude simulation chamber
with whole blood spiked samples spanning the range of ~20 to 600 mg/dL. The
device-specific measurements at level 0 (“sea level”) were compared to the “high
altitude” measurements and to the YSI measurements as well. The study protocol and
data were provided, reviewed and found to be adequate. Altitude up to 11500 feet
(3500 m) does not affect test results of the FORA D40d/FORA Wisdom D40d
Monitoring Systems.
.
4. Temperature and humidity studies: Temperature and humidity studies were
conducted to demonstrate that the FORA D40d/FORA Wisdom D40d Blood Glucose
Monitoring Systems can be used at temperatures of 4 to 40°C and at a relative
humidity below 85%, and stored at temperatures of 4 to 40°C with a relative humidity
below 85%. The FORA D40d test strips are stable for 24 months when stored
unopened and 90 days when stored opened at 4 to 40°C with a relative humidity
below 85%. The study protocol and data of individual measurements compared to the
YSI across the entire measuring range were provided and found to be adequate.

5. Open-vial-in-use test strip studies were performed at the combined extremes of
10±2°C (46.4-56.3°F) and RH: 10 %, 10±2°C RH:85%, 40±2°C (100.4- 107.6°F)
RH:10 %, and 40±2°C RH:85% with venous blood samples with concentrations
across the measuring range and compared to the YSI. The study protocol, data and
±10% bias of individual measurements across the entire measuring range when
compared to YSI were provided and found to be adequate.
6. A study to evaluate the effect of different sample volumes (0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and
1.0μl) was conducted to demonstrate that the 0.5 μl volume provides accurate reading
The results from this study for the sample volume of 0.5 μl were within ±10%
individual bias across the entire measuring range when FORA D40d/FORA Wisdom
D40d measurements were compared to the YSI-2300.
7. Lay-User Study for USB and Bluetooth mediated Data Transmission:
This study was performed as a part of the lay-user study described above in 2.a. The
50 study participants, following instructions in User’s manual, were able to transmit
results from the meter to the PC application (cleared under k070941) via either the
USB or Bluetooth features. The study participants ranged in age, education, and were
about equally divided between males and females. Those study participants also
completed a questionnaire in response to whether the data transmission feature is easy
to use. The sponsor concluded that the users’ responses indicated that data
transmission function was easy to operate by following the User’s manuals for both
the USB and the Bluetooth mediated data transmission.
8. Lay user questionnaire: 136 lay users evaluated the ease of use of the device and
the presentation of the labeling. All users thought that the FORA D40d and FORA
Wisdom D40d Monitoring Systems were easy to use and most answer “easy” and
“very easy” that the user manuals were written to make it easy to use.
9. The sponsor provided a readability study and obtained Flesch-Kincaid grade level
scores of 8 or lower for the User’s Manual and test strip insert
10. Additional electromagnetic interference study was performed to verify these new
products. The results of this study complied with standards listed in the
Standard/Guidance Document Referenced section above. Electromagnetic
Compatibility (EMC) testing was performed/passed and a certificate to Taidoc
Technology Corporation was provided.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
