--- Page 3 ---
The VIDAS® Toxo IgG Avidity assay is a two-step enzyme immunoassay
sandwich method with a final fluorescent detection (ELFA) performed on an
automated VIDAS 30 or miniVIDAS instrument. The VIDAS instrument is
attached to a computer and printer. Each instrument has five independent
sections allowing multiple different assays to be run simultaneously. Each
section can process up to six samples. Therefore, a fully loaded VIDAS can
process thirty samples. The Solid Phase Receptacle serves as the solid phase as
well as the pipetting device for the assay. Reagents for the assay are ready-to-
use and pre-dispensed in the sealed reagent strips. The instrument performs all
of the assay steps automatically.

L. Test Principle:
The VIDAS® Toxo IgG Avidity assay is a two-step enzyme immunoassay
sandwich method with a final fluorescent detection (ELFA). The Solid Phase
Receptacle (SPR) serves as the solid phase as well as the pipetting device for
the assay. Reagents for the assay are ready-to-use and pre-dispensed in the
sealed reagent strips. The instrument performs all of the assay steps
automatically. The reaction medium is cycled in and out of the SPR several
times. The VIDAS Toxo IgG Avidity uses a dual strip comprised of one
reference strip and one test strip. The sample to be tested, after dilution, is
dispensed into both sample wells of the dual strip: reference and test. Any anti-
toxoplasma IgG present in the sample form complexes with the antigen coated
to the solid phase. In the reference strip, non-specific antibodies are eliminated
by washing, whereas specific antibodies remain coated to the solid phase. In the
test strip, washing with the dissociating agent changes antigen-antibody links.

--- Page 6 ---
Only antibodies with high avidity remain bound to the solid phase, whereas
antibodies with low avidity are eliminated.
Alkaline phosphatase labeled human anti-IgG antibody (conjugate) is then
cycled in and out of the SPR, and binds with any human IgG coated on the
interior of the SPR. Unbound conjugate is removed by washing. During the
final detection step, the substrate (4-Methyl-umbelliferyl phosphate) is cycled in
and out of the SPR. The conjugate enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of this
substrate into a fluorescent product (4-Methyl-umbelliferone) the fluorescence
of which is measured at 450 nm. The intensity of the fluorescence is
proportional to the concentration of antibodies present in the sample. At the end
of the assay, results are automatically calculated by the instrument and then
printed out. The ratio between the quantity of high avidity antibodies (test strip)
and the quantity of total antibodies (reference strip) provides an index, which
indicates antibody avidity in the tested sample.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing was performed using five serum samples (low
avidity, equivocal avidity, and high avidity samples), positive and
negative controls, twice daily for a total of ten days on the VIDAS
instruments.
Reproducibility testing was performed using five serum samples
(low avidity, equivocal avidity, and high avidity samples), positive
and negative controls, and two reagent lots using the VIDAS
instruments at three testing sites for ten days. Repeatability (within-
run precision), between-run, between-day, between-lot, between-
system and total precision were calculated based on the
recommendations of CLSI EP05-A2. The overall CV for the
specimens range was less than 10% for both analyzers, which is
acceptable. The following results were obtained for the precision and
reproducibility studies:

Cross-reactivity
The cross reactive study for the VIDAS Toxo IgG Avidity assay was
evaluated by testing a total of ten different analytes: ANA, CMV,
EBV, HAMA, HAV, HBV, HSV-2, RF, Rubella, and VZV based on
the recommendations of CLSI EP07-A2. Testing included at least 5
samples with a low (or borderline) avidity index containing high
titers of antibodies to a potentially interfering disease state, and five
samples with a high avidity index containing high titers of antibodies
to a potentially interfering disease state. Clinically significant
interference was defined as either a > 20% change in index values or
a result that altered assay interpretation, i.e., a low or equivocal
avidity result changing to a high avidity result or a high avidity result
changing to a borderline or low avidity result.

f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off for the VIDAS Toxo IgG Avidity assay was established by
using a ROC curve to assess the clinical accuracy of the assay.
Additionally, an equivocal range was established to identify low
avidity samples, which have avidity indices approaching the cut-off.
A total of 357 (331 fresh and 26 frozen) samples were tested and were
representative of the intended study population. Results obtained with
the VIDAS Toxo IgG Avidity assay can be interpreted as follows:

3. Clinical Studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
The clinical performance of the VIDAS TOXO IgG Avidity assay was
studied in a single study of samples from 386 subjects, enrolled
prospectively or from samples previously collected for toxoplasmosis
testing (‘retrospective’).
Study Design Population
A total of 386 subjects provided samples; all patients were required to have
a VIDAS TOXO IgG II assay positive result (i.e. result ≥ 8 IU/mL), and
either be pregnant or have acute lymphadenopathy due to suspected or
confirmed toxoplasmosis infection. Samples were obtained from four
clinical sites: Palo Alto, CA, Grenoble and Marseille, France and Cali,
Colombia. Testing was performed at 3 US sites: Palo Alto, CA,
Hackensack, NJ and Albuquerque, NM.
Of the 386 subjects, 104 subjects had initially equivocal results on
composite reference testing. Thirty-one subjects had an additional sample
available for repeat composite reference testing and are included in the
primary analysis; results for the remaining 73 subjects without an evaluable
response on the composite reference standard were excluded. Of the 313
total subjects analyzed (283 frozen samples and 30 fresh samples), 271
samples were from pregnant women, 42 from patients with
lymphadenopathy (both males and females); 14 of the 271 pregnant women
also had acute lymphadenopathy. Among the 313 subjects included in the
final analysis, 31 had an initial equivocal result but a follow-up sample was
available.
Of the 271 samples from pregnant women, 142 were from subjects enrolled
prospectively and 129 subject samples were retrospectively tested samples;
of the 56 patients with lymphadenopathy (including 14 pregnant women), 7
were from prospectively enrolled subjects and 49 were from retrospective
samples.
All specimens were tested by both the VIDAS TOXO IgG Avidity assay
and a composite reference method; the composite reference method was
used for determining whether infection occurred recently or was more
distant, and included the Sabin-Feldman Dye Test (DT), the VIDAS TOXO
IgM ELISA assay, and the Differential Agglutination (AC/HS) test.
Toxoplasmosis IgA and IgE ELISA assays were also performed and used as
supportive information. All reference testing was performed at a Palo Alto,
CA laboratory. ‘Diagnostic truth’ was assigned by results from the
composite reference method and assigned as whether infection occurred ≤ 4
months or > 4 months previous to sample collection.
10

--- Page 11 ---
VIDAS TOXO IgG Avidity assay and composite referencing testing were
performed on an initial specimen from each subject; if the initial specimen
was equivocal by the composite reference method, a second follow up
sample was tested in parallel with the initial specimen by the composite
reference method to assist in determining a final diagnostic classification.
Patients for whom a follow up sample was required but was unavailable
were not included in the results below.
Study Results
The comparison between the VIDAS TOXO IgG Avidity assay and the
Composite Reference Method was analyzed as follows: all samples (tables 1
and 2), frozen samples (tables 3 and 4), pregnant women (tables 5 and 6)
and lymphadenopathy patients excluding pregnant women (tables 7 and 8).
The results and interpretation are shown below.

method were as follows: 13 (41.9%) were interpreted as consistent with
acute disease, 5 patients (16.1%) again had equivocal results, and 13
(41.9%) were interpreted as consistent with chronic disease. All of the 13
samples by composite reference testing (100%) had low avidity on the
VIDAS TOXO IgG Avidity assay; however, of the 13 samples consistent
with chronic infection, on composite reference testing, 7 (53.8%) had low
avidity, 1 (7.7%) had equivocal results, and 5 (38.5%) had high avidity on
the VIDAS TOXO IgG Avidity assay. An exploratory analysis where the
results from these 31 samples were extrapolated to the 73 samples with
equivocal composite reference testing (and not included in the analyses
above) and combined with the 313 analyzed samples to approximate results
for the original 386 subjects yielded a similar overall sensitivity of 94.6%
(95% CI 90.3 – 97.4) but a noticeable drop in specificity to 80.5% (95% CI
74.3 – 85.8). These latter estimates may more closely approximate the
results that would have been observed had repeat testing been possible on all
initially equivocal composite reference samples.

For frozen samples from a combined pregnant women and
lymphadenopathy population, the composite reference method results
established that an infection occurring < 4 months could not be excluded in
143 patients. In 138 (96.5%) of these 143 patients, VIDAS TXGA test
results were Low or Equivocal at < 0.300. Thus the sensitivity of the
VIDAS TXGA for the diagnosis that an acute infection (< 4 months) cannot
be ruled out was 96.5%.

In the overall pregnant women population, the composite reference method
results established that an infection occurring < 4 months could not be
excluded in 110 patients. In 106 (96.4%) of these 110 patients, VIDAS
TXGA test results were Low or Equivocal at < 0.300. Thus the sensitivity of
VIDAS TXGA for the diagnosis that an acute infection (< 4 months) cannot
be ruled out was 96.4%.

excluded in 33 patients. In 32 (97.0%) of these 33 patients, VIDAS TXGA
test results were Low or Equivocal at < 0.300. Thus the sensitivity of the
VIDAS TXGA for the diagnosis that an acute infection (< 4 months) cannot
be ruled out was 97.0%.
These results met the acceptance criteria and are acceptable.
b. Clinical specificity:
See Clinical sensitivity section M.3.a
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected Values/Reference Range:
The TOXO IgG Avidity assay was tested with 148 prospectively collected
specimens (fresh and frozen) representing subjects for whom the VIDAS
TOXO IgG II result was > 8 IU/mL. Of the 148 serum samples, 142
corresponded to pregnant women, and 6 to patients with lymphadenopathy.
The percentage of high avidity results in these populations as determined by
the VIDAS TOXO IgG Avidity assay was 85.2% for the pregnant women
population and 66.7% for the lymphadenopathy population.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part
809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and
supports a substantial equivalence decision.
