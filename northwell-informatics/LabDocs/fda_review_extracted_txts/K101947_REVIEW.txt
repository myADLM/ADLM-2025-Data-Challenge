L. Test Principle:
The IVD-GE02 System measures the analytes pH, pCO2, pO2, potassium and glucose
using electrochemical sensors, based on potentiometric and amperometric phenomenon.
The sensors produce electrical signals in response to the analytes in the blood. The signal
from each sensor is proportional to the concentration of the analyte. There are two
different measuring principles employed, potentiometry and amperometry.
Potentiometry: A potential is recorded using a voltmeter, which relates to the
concentration of the sample. A reference electrode is used to provide a stable, fixed
potential against which other potential differences can be measured. This measurement
technique is used for pH, pCO2 and potassium.
Amperometry: The magnitude of an electrical flow of current is proportional to the
concentration of the substance being oxidized or reduced at an electrode. This
measurement technique is used for pO2 and Glucose.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity study was designed based on CLSI EP6-A guideline. Human whole
blood samples were drawn into heparinized tubes. Samples were spiked to the
target analyte levels. 7 levels of each of the analyte measured were prepared
and tested in duplicate on 3 IVD-GE02 instruments and on one Siemens
Rapidlab 865 analyzer to generate the expected values. The observed values
were plotted against the expected values and an appropriate line fitted by
standard linear regression. All three instruments obtained similar linear
regressions. One representative instrument results are summarized below.
pH tested ranged from 6.8-7.8 and the linear equation generated was Y =
0.9973 X + 0.0229, r2= 0.9957.
pCO2 tested ranged from 5.8-101.9 mmHg and the linear equation generated
was Y = 1.073 X – 2.509, r2= 0.9957.
pO2 tested ranged from 28-500 mmHg and the linear equation generated was
Y = 0.9855 X + 0.4544, r2= 0.9987.
K tested ranged from 2.06-9.71 mmol/L and the linear equation generated was
Y = 0.9203X + 0.4149, r2= 0.9917.
Glucose tested ranged from 16.2-445.3 mg/dL and the linear equation
generated was Y = 0.9334 X + 3.092, r2= 0.9925.
Results of the study support the sponsor claims for the following
measuring/linearity ranges:
pH: 6.8 to 7.8
pCO : 15 to 100 mmHg
2
pO : 30 to 500 mmHg
2
K: 2.0 to 9.0 mmol/L
Glucose: 30.6-399.6 mg/dL
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
All the analytes in the calibration solutions are traceable to a reference method
and the analyte targets are assigned based on the reference methods or other
commercially available methods. See table below for traceability.

*Traceable to the IUPAC pH scale and the NIST pH scale.
**Primary, gravimetrically prepared standards, traceable to NIST traceable
weights.
Value assignments of the calibration solutions were established by multiple
determinations of the analytes. Calibration solutions have the following
analyte target value:
Parameter Units Solution 1 Solution 2
pH pH units 6.83 7.38
pCO2 Mm Hg 70 35
pO2 Mm Hg 80 200
K mmol/L 9.0 4.0
Glucose mg/dL 180.2 39.6
Stability of the calibration solutions: A real-time stability study was
performed to demonstrate a maximum shelf life of 6 months at storage
temperatures between 15 and 25 degrees C in unopened foil pouches.
Protocols and acceptance criteria has been provided and found to be adequate.
There is no open-vial stability because calibration solutions are opened and
used immediately.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor determined that the detection limit was defined by the linear
range study. The minimum detection limit is defined as the lowest analyte
concentrations over the range that the assay has been shown to be acceptably
linear. Please see linearity study in section M.1.b. above.
In addition, the sponsor performed an intra-assay precision (N=12) of a whole
blood sample with glucose concentration at 32 mg/dL and found that the intra-
assay %CV was 3.95%.
The sponsor claimed the following as the detection limits:
pH: 6.8

e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was designed according to CLSI EP7-A2 guideline.
The study used human whole blood samples as the test materials and was
conducted for the analytes pH, pCO2, pO2, K, and glucose at two analytes
concentration. The whole blood samples were spiked with the potential
interferents (test samples) and were measured against the samples that were
not spiked (control samples). All samples were assayed in replicates of six
(except pCO2 use replicates of 8). The sponsor states that interferences are
considered to be non-significant if the bias between the test and control
samples are within ±0.04 units for pH, and ±10% for pCO2, pO2, K, and
glucose. The tables below summarize the results of the interference testing
performed. “No” significant interference is defined using the criteria listed
above,

* The substances that were found to have significant interference (≥ 10%)
were listed in the Operator’s manual.
In addition the following statement is included in the limitations section of the
Operator’s manual:
** Patients with an arterial blood oxygen level of 30 mmHg are in a critical
condition and will urgently require treatment for this low oxygen level.
Patients who have blood oxygen level of 30 mmHg should not be tested with
the device because it will affect the glucose measurement.
A hematocrit study was performed to evaluate the effect of hematocrit on the
glucose measurements on the IVD-GE02 system. Five different levels of
glucose concentrations (40, 80, 120, 200, and 400 mg/dL) at two hematocrit
levels (30% and 50%) were tested and compare with the normal hematocrit
level (45%). All samples were prepared and tested on both the candidate
device and the predicate device. All comparisons to the predicate device and
to a normal hematocrit showed a bias of less than 15%. The results
demonstrated that hematocrit within 30% to 50% has no significant effect on
the glucose levels. In addition, in the method comparison study where native
patient samples were used, sponsor also measured the hematocrit levels of
these clinical samples. These samples covered a wide range of hematocrit
levels (between 19% to 51%). Based on these data, there was no significant
hematocrit effect on the glucose measurements.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed using heparinized whole blood
samples based on the CLSI EP9-A2 guideline. The study was performed in a
hospital with patients’ left-over arterial blood samples over a minimum of 5
days. All samples were assayed once on the IVD-GE02 system (candidate
method) and on the Siemens Rapidlab 865 analyzer (predicate method). In
order to cover the hard-to-find sample range and span the entire measuring
range, some samples were altered or tonometered with different gases before
measurements. Results of the study are summarized below.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor recommends in the labeling that each clinical laboratory should
establish its own reference range for diagnostic evaluation of patient results. The
reference range for each parameter has been established in the literature. The
following table shows typical reference ranges cited from the literature1,2,3.
Parameter Units
pH 7.38-7.44 pH units
pCO2 80-100 mm Hg
pO2 35-45 mm Hg
K 3.5-5.0 mmol/L
Glucose 75-115 mg/dL

Yes ___X_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Manual sample identification
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Manual-syringe mode
5. Calibration:
The IVD-GE02 will automatically calibrate its sensor when the calibration
sequence is run. Operator must initiate a calibration sequence with manual
injections of the calibration solutions (2 levels).
6. Quality Control:
Operator must initiate an external quality control procedure with manual
injections of the quality control materials. Recommendations for frequency of
testing are including in the labeling. As a minimum, users are to follow regulatory
guidelines for testing quality control materials.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
None
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
