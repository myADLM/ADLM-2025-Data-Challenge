Product Description: The Omega Laboratories Hair Drug Screening Assays for
Methamphetamine_3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
(Meth_MDMA) is a test system using ELISA reagents and micro-plate
reader for the qualitative detection of Methamphetamine and 3,4-
Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)in hair samples at or above
500 pg/mg.
Indication for Use: The Omega Laboratories Hair Drug Screening Assay for
Methamphetamine and MDMA is a laboratory developed test that is
intended to be used for the determination of the presence of
Methamphetamine and 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)
in human hair from the crown of the head. The Omega Laboratories
Hair Drug Screening Assay (AMP) utilizes International Diagnostics
Systems Corp One-Step Methamphetamine ELISA for Hair Testing Kit
for the qualitative detection of Methamphetamine and MDMA at or

510(k) Summary
Omega Hair Drug Screening Assay for Methamphetamine and MDMA
above 500 pg/mg of hair for the purpose of identifying the use of
Methamphetamine and MDMA. D-Methamphetamine is used as the
standard for the assay. To confirm a screen positive result a more
specific alternate chemical method, such as Gas
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) operating in the selected
ion monitoring (SIM) mode is the preferred method with deuterated
internal standards. Professional judgment should be applied to any
drug of abuse test result, particularly when presumptive positive results
are obtained.
When used to qualitatively detect methamphetamine and/or MDMA in
Comparison:
head hair specimens collected with the Omega Specimen Collection
Device, the Omega assays yield results in substantial agreement with
the predicate device.
Comparison Performance Performance characteristic studies were conducted for
Data:
Precision
Agreement
Cosmetic Treatment
Cross-reactivity
Environmental Contamination
All performance studies demonstrated that the Omega assay is in
substantial agreement with the Quest Diagnostic product.
Results obtained from donor specimens showed that the qualitative
results from the new assays are substantially equivalent to those
obtained from the predicate devices.
Conclusion: The Omega Laboratories Hair Drug Screening Assay for
Methamphetamine and MDMA is substantially equivalent to the Quest
Diagnostics HairCheck-DT (Amphetamines) k051161.
