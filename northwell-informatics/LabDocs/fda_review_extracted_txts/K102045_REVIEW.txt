L. Test Principle:
The Dimension Vista® HbA1c assay measures both HbA1c and total hemoglobin.
The HbA1c measurement is based on a turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay
(TINIA) principle, and the measurement of total hemoglobin is based on a
modification of the alkaline hematin reaction. Using the values obtained for each of
these two analytes, the relative proportion of the total hemoglobin that is glycated is
calculated and reported.
Total Hemoglobin Measurement: A sample of whole blood is added to a LOCI®
reaction vessel containing lysing reagent. This reagent lyses the red blood cells and
simultaneously converts the released hemoglobin to a derivative that has a
characteristic absorbance spectrum. An aliquot of the lysed whole blood is transferred
from the LOCI® reaction vessel to a cuvette where total hemoglobin concentration is
measured at 405 nm and 700 nm.
Hemoglobin A1c Measurement: The same aliquot of the lysed whole blood that is
transferred from the LOCI® reaction vessel to the cuvette for the Hb measurement is
also used for the measurement of HbA1c. The cuvette contains a sheep anti-HbA1c
polyclonal antibody in a buffered reagent. Hemoglobin A1c in the sample reacts with
anti-HbA1c antibody to form a soluble antigen-antibody complex. A polyhapten
reagent containing multiple HbA1c epitopes is then added to this cuvette. The
polyhapten reacts with excess (free) anti-HbA1c antibodies to form an insoluble

antibody-polyhapten complex. The rate of this reaction is measured turbidimetrically
at 340 nm and blanked at 700 nm and is inversely proportional to the concentration of
HbA1c in the sample
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing for the HbA1c method was performed over twenty days
according to CLSI/NCCLS EP5-A2. The test samples consisted of four levels
of whole blood hemolysate control material tested on a single Vista
instrument with one lot of reagents. On each day of testing, each sample was
run in duplicate from independent sample cups, in two separate runs.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The claimed analytical measuring range is 3.5 – 16% (13 – 151 mmol/mol) for
the ratio.
The linear range was determined according to CLSI EP06-A.
A human whole blood sample with a high concentration of 18.6% HbA1c and
low sample, whole blood material from a commercial source with very low
HbA1c concentration (2.4%), were used. Seven (7) dilutions ranging in
concentration from 2.4 to 18.6% HbA1c were prepared from these two
samples and evaluated.
Observed values were compared to expected values. The percent differences
ranged from 1.5 to -7.5%.
Data was also evaluated by linear regression as follows:
y = 1.0272x - 0.3118, R2 = 0.9985
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The Dimension Vista® Hemoglobin A1c has met the requirements of the
National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP). The NGSP
certification requires annual renewal. The current list of NGSP certified
methods is available on the NGSP website at:
http://www.ngsp.org/prog/index.html
Dimension Vista® Hemoglobin A1c Calibrators contain 5 levels and are
traceable to IFCC reference materials.
Stability:
The lyophilized calibrators are stable until the expiration date on the product
label. Once reconstituted the calibrators are stable for 8 hours at 25 °C and 48
hours at 2 – 8 °C. The stability protocols and acceptance criteria were
reviewed and determined to be adequate.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) studies were performed for
three days, one run per day, 2 replicates per run, with two reagent (Flex® )
lots, on two Vista instruments.
7

--- Page 8 ---
For the LoB, a commercially available whole blood material with very low
HbA1c concentration was mixed with EDTA plasma to provide low HbA1c
concentrations in the presence of Hb. For the LoD EDTA treated whole blood
samples obtained from eight healthy normal individuals were diluted 25% to
50% with EDTA plasma. Samples ranged in % HbA1c concentration from
3.5 – 6.5% (17 - 47 mmol/mol).
The Limit of Blank (LoB) for HbA1c was determined to be 2.2% (6
mmol/mol). The Limit of Detection (LoD) for % HbA1c (mmol/mol HbA1c)
was determined to be 3.5% (15 mmol/mol)
The claimed analytical measuring range, 3.5 – 16%, is based on these results
and the results of the linearity study summarized in M.1.b above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed according to CLSI/NCCLS EP7-A2 to
determine the effect of various endogenous and exogenous substances on the
Dimension Vista® HbA1c method. Test samples were prepared by spiking the
potential interferent into EDTA treated whole blood. A control sample
without the interferant was also prepared.
Testing was performed at two HbA1c concentrations. The low range samples
ranged from 4.4 - 5.5 %HbA1c (26 - 37 mmol/mol); the high level samples
ranged from 9.0 to 10.4 %HbA1c (74 - 88 mmol/mol).
Each test and control sample was evaluated using the Dimension Vista®
HbA1c method and the results were compared to each other. The sponsor’s
acceptance criterion for non-interference was <10% difference between test
samples containing each potential interferant and the respective control
sample.
The substances listed in the summary table below did not interfere with the
test up to the stated concentrations.

Glybenclamide, Sodium cyanate, Acetylsalicylic acid, Rhematoid factor
Test samples for acetylsalicylic acid, glybenclamide, and sodium cyanate were
prepared by spiking the potential interferent into EDTA treated whole blood.
Rheumatoid factor (RF) samples were 50% whole blood and 50% serum.
Testing was performed at two HbA1c concentrations: 5.9 – 6.4 %HbA1c and 9.3
– 10.2 %HbA1c. Values are the mean of three replicates for each control and test
sample, using one lot of Flex® reagents. The difference between test and control
samples were compared and a difference of <10% was considered non-
interference.
Interferent Test conc. Sample 1 Sample 2
Acetylsalicylic acid 50 mg/dL 0.5% 1.8%
Glybenclamide 1.92 µg/mL 0.5% 0.4%
Sodium Cyanate 50 mg/dL <0.1% -0.4%
RF 1805 IU/mL 1.1% <0.1%
Labile, Carbamyl and Acetaldehyde Hemoglobins
Three EDTA whole blood sample pools with HbA1c normal and high levels were
spiked with glucose to 1500 mg/dL (labile hemoglobin HbA1c), urea to 150
mg/dL (carbamylated Hb), or acetaldehyde to 50 mg/dL (acetylated Hb).
Untreated sample pools served as controls. All specimens were incubated at 37° C
for up 5 hours and then assayed for HbA1c in triplicate.
The specimen value (control) with no added glucose or urea or acetaldehyde was
used as the reference value. No interference was defined as <10% difference
between the test compared to the control. There was no interference from glucose
up to 1500 mg/dL, urea up to150 mg/dL, or acetaldehyde up to 50 mg/dL, with all
test samples demonstrating less than 3% difference compared to the control.
Hemoglobin Variants HbC, HbD, HbE and HbS:
Interference by samples with known Hb variants, HbC, HbD, HbE and HbS, were
tested by comparison with a recognized reference method. Samples were run on
the Dimension Vista® HbA1c method and then assayed by the Trinity Biotech
ultra2 A1c Analyzer (formerly Primus Diagnostics), an NGSP recognized
secondary reference method. The Dimension Vista® System result was compared
to the reference method result.
For all but one sample tested there was less than a 10% difference in %HbA1c
values between the reference method and the Dimension Vista results. One
specimen identified as having variant HbC recovered -10.9% compared to the
Trinity Biotech ultra2 method.

Hemoglobin Variant HbF:
Samples were identified as containing HbF by a recognized reference method on
the Tosoh G7 Variant Analysis Mode ion-exchange HPLC.
Samples of varying HbF concentrations were prepared by mixing a high HbF
sample (16.8% HbF) with a low HbF sample (0.8%HbF). Nine additional EDTA
whole blood samples containing 1.7 to 15.1%HbF were prepared by mixing
different amounts of the high and low HbF samples.
The sponsor defines interference as a % difference in recovery of > 10% between
the expected and observed values. All samples up to 11.8% HbF met the
acceptance criterion. The labeling states that that individuals with elevated levels
of HbF (>10%) may produce lower than expected results with the Dimension
Vista® HbA1c method.
Hemoglobin concentration:
The assay is designed to measure total hemoglobin as part of the %HbA1c
calculation. A linearity study was performed to support the analytical measuring
range of hemoglobin 5-25 g/dL. Samples with hemoglobin values above 25 g/dL
will be flagged by the instrument resulting in an error message.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The American Diabetes Association (ADA) expected values range is 4.0-6.0% for
people without diabetes.
The sponsor performed a study to verify this range using whole blood specimens
drawn at two different sites from a population of healthy adults (94 males and 89
females). The obtained range using Dimension Vista® HbA1c was 4.2 – 6.3
%HbA1c
The labeling also states that according to American Diabetes Association,
Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes -2010, Diabetes Care, 33:Suppl 1 (2010),
the primary goal of therapy should be a HbA1c of <7% and that physicians should
reevaluate the treatment regimen in patients with HbA1c values consistently >8%.
