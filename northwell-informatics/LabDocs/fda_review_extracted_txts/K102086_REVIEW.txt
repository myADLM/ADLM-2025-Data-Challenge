Traceability:
The sponsor claims the assayed value of each CalCheck level was
standardized against the Enzymun-Test CA 125 II method. This assay was in
turn calibrated against CA 125 II RIA from Fujirebio.
Value assignment:
For each Elecsys CA 125 II CalCheck 5 kit manufactured, value assignment
for each level was tested once a day on two Modular Analytics E170
analyzers for a total of eight runs on two days. The Modular Analytics E170
master calibration curve was used to calculate U/mL from counts. The
assigned target value of each CalCheck is the median of the observed values.
The assigned values and assigned range for lot that was used in the
submission on the E170 are listed below.

Elecsys 2010 analyzers. The assigned values obtained on the Elecsys 2010
analyzers were compared to those obtained on the E170. Results showed that
the values assigned to the E170 are valid for the Elecsys 2010.
The labeling states that obtained values should fall within the specified range
provided on lot-specific value sheets and that laboratories should establish
appropriate acceptance criteria when using this product for its intended use.
Stability:
Stability studies were performed in order to verify the stability claims for the
Elecsys CA 125 II CalCheck 5.
Open vial stability:
One Elecsys CA 125 II CalCheck 5 lot was evaluated in duplicate on the
Elecsys E170. The test material was reconstituted and stored for 4 hours at
20-25ºC (in an open vial). The reference material was a freshly reconstituted
set of CalChecks. The recovery of test material was calculated as a percent of
the reference value. The data support the claimed stability - Elecsys CA125 II
CalCheck 5 is stable up to 4 hours at 20-25°C.
On-Board Stability:
Not applicable
Accelerated stability:
One Elecsys CA 125 II CalCheck 5 lot was evaluated in duplicate on the
Elecsys E170. The test material was stored lyophilized at 35°C for 3 weeks.
The reference material was a freshly reconstituted set of CalChecks (stored at
2-8°C). After 3 weeks, the test and reference materials were tested in
duplicate. The recovery of test material was calculated as a percent of the
reference value.
Real time stability:
The real time stability is on-going. The test material is stored at 2-8°C.
Sample at time-points at 0, 13, 19 and 37 months will be tested in duplicate
and the recovery value will be calculated by comparing to the unstressed
reference value (stored at -20°C).
The results from the Accelerated stability and on-going Real time stability
support an initial shelf-life claim of 18 months when the Elecsys CA 125 II
CalCheck 5 is stored under normal storage conditions of 2-8°C.
c. Dilution Study:
A study is suggested in the package insert to analyze diluted samples in the
event CalCheck level 1 or 5 produce results that exceed the reportable
measuring range of the assay. To demonstrate that the values are within the
assay’s measuring range of 0.6 U/mL – 5000 U/mL, the dilution study was
performed. Check 1&2 and Check 4&5 were mixed in a 1:1 ratio and
measured in duplicates. Results are summarized in the following table and
both CalCheck dilution values are within the assay’s measuring range after
dilution.
