L. Test Principle:
Not applicable
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and Value Assignment
Each level of the Elecsys PreciControl Multimarker is assigned analyte-
specific values with the respective Elecsys assay using master calibrators.
The master calibrator for ACTH is traceable to an internal reference
material based on gravimetry, for C-Peptide is traceable to NIBCS
reference material, and for hGH and Insulin the master calibrators are
traceable to respective WHO reference materials. The Elecsys
PreciControl products are assayed and compared to these reference
preparations and target values and ranges are assigned.
For lot-specific value assignment, each level of quality control is tested in
duplicate on at least three Elecsys MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 /
cobas e 601 immunoassay analyzers (master platform). The assigned
value of each control level is defined as the median value obtained from at
least six determinations (duplicate runs on at least three analyzers), with
an assigned range calculated from the assigned value. Acceptance criteria
including precision of control determinations and percent difference
between assigned and target values must be met for lot value assignment.
To ensure the values assigned to the Elecsys PreciControl Multimarker on
the master platform are transferrable to the additional instrument
platforms, the same value assignment procedure is performed on the
Elecsys 2010 / cobas e 411 immunoassay analyzer and the assigned values
are compared to those obtained on the master platform. The analyzer-to-
analyzer variability must be less than 10% difference to meet acceptance
criteria. The assigned value from the master platform is then valid on the
Elecsys 2010 / cobas e 411 immunoassay analyzer.

Stability
As stability studies are not analyzer dependent, all stability studies were
performed on the cobas e 601 / MODULAR ANALYTICS E170
immunoassay analyzer and can be applied to the Elecsys 2010 / cobas e
411 analyzer. An accelerated stability study was performed to simulate a
shelf life of 15 months at normal storage conditions of 2-8 °C. Stability
data supports this package insert claim and percent recoveries at 15
months meet the stated acceptance criteria of 90-110% of concentration
based on unstressed material. A real-time stability study is ongoing.
Reconstituted control material is stable at 2-8 ºC for 72 hours. Stability
data supports this package insert claim and percent recoveries at 72 hours
meet the stated acceptance criteria of 90-110% of concentration based on
unstressed material.
Reconstituted control material is stable frozen at -20 ºC for 31 days.
Stability data supports this package insert claim and percent recoveries at
31 days meet the stated acceptance criteria of 90-110% of concentration
based on unstressed material.
Reconstituted control material is stable sitting on the analyzers at 20-25 ºC
for 5 hours. Stability data supports this package insert claim and percent
recoveries at 5 hours meet the stated acceptance criteria of 90-110% of
concentration based on unstressed material.
