H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Focus Diagnostics SimplexaTM Flu A/B & RSV assay is intended for use on
the 3M Integrated Cycler instrument for the in vitro qualitative detection and
discrimination of influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and respiratory syncytial
virus (RSV) RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) from human patients with
signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection in conjunction with clinical and
epidemiological risk factors. This test is intended for use as an aid in the
differential diagnosis of influenza A, influenza B, and RSV viral infections in
humans and is not intended to detect influenza C.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus or RSV infection and should not
be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2010
influenza season when 2009 H1N1 influenza was the predominant influenza A
virus in circulation. When other influenza A viruses are emerging, performance
characteristics may vary.
If infection with a novel Influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical
and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities,
specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for
novel virulent Influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for
testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+
facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

4. Special instrument requirements:
To be used with the 3M Integrated Cycler with Integrated Cycler Studio Software
version 2.1 or higher and either a Roche MagNA Pure LC Instrument (Roche) and
the MagNA Pure Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Roche) or a NucliSENS®
easyMAGTM System (bioMérieux) and the Automated Magnetic Extraction
Reagents (bioMérieux).
I. Device Description:
The Focus Diagnostics SimplexaTM Flu A/B & RSV assay is a multiplex Real-Time
RT-PCR test that detects and differentiates influenza A ,influenza B, and RSV RNA
from nasopharyngeal swabs from human patients with signs and symptoms of viral
respiratory tract infection.
Patient specimens are collected and placed in sterile viral transport medium
containing protein stabilizer, antibiotics to inhibit bacterial and fungal growth, and
buffer solution. An Internal Control (RNA IC) is added to each sample prior to
nucleic acid extraction by either the MagNA Pure Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit
(Roche) or the Automated Magnetic Extraction Reagents (bioMérieux). In the case
of the MagNA Pure kit, it is recommended that extraction be carried out with
qualified MagNA Pure reagent lots only; a list of these qualified extraction reagents
will be maintained at www.focusdx.com.
A sample of the extracted nucleic acid is added to the SimplexaTM Flu A/B & RSV
assay reagents that contain four sets of a primer and a bi-functional fluorescent
probe-primer. Each set of primer and bi-functional fluorescent probe-primer
recognizes a specific target, namely, influenza A matrix gene, influenza B matrix
gene, RSV M gene, and RNA IC. PCR amplification is carried out on the 3M
Integratede Cycler. The fluorescence output is is analyzed and test results are
determined using the Integrated Cycler Studio Software.
The SimplexaTM Flu A/B & RSV kit contains Primer Mix (PM), Master Mix (MM),
RT Mix (RT), RNA Internal Control (RNA IC), No Template Control (NTC), Flu
A/B & RSV Positive Control (PC), Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Barcode Card, and
Package Insert.

Interpretation of Sample Results:
Reporting results is a three step process.
1. Determine if the run is valid by examining the Flu A/B & RSV Positive Control,
No Template Control, and RNA Internal Control.
Criteria for a Valid Control (simplified)*

Control
Ct Ct Ct Ct
No Template Control 0 0 0 ≤40, ≠0
Not Applicable
Positive Control ≤40, ≠0 ≤40, ≠0 ≤40, ≠0
(N/A)
* See notes below for full description.
a. No Template Control:
i. If the No Template Control is Positive (Ct value ≤40, ≠0 for Flu A, Flu B
or RSV), then this indicates possible contamination of prepared samples.
The control is invalid and all patient specimens must be re-assayed.
ii. If the RNA IC is not detected in the No Template Control, the assay run is
invalid and all patient specimens must be re-assayed.
iii. If the No Template Control is Negative for Flu A, Flu B or RSV detector
(Ct = 0) AND If the RNA IC is detected for the No Template Control,
then this control is valid and acceptable.
b. Positive Control
i. If the Positive Control result is a Ct = 0 for Flu A, Flu B or RSV, the assay
run is considered invalid and unacceptable. All patient specimens must be
re-assayed.
ii. If the Ct values for Flu A, Flu B and RSV A are ≤40, ≠0 the assay run is
considered valid and acceptable.

i. Detection of the Simplexa™ RNA Internal Control is required to report a
negative result.
ii. Detection of the Simplexa™ RNA Internal Control is not required to
report a positive result.
2. Examination of Patient Specimen Results.
Examination of clinical specimen results should be performed after the Positive
and No Template Controls have been examined and determined to be valid and
acceptable. Flu A, Flu B, RSV and RNA IC results must be examined for each
patient specimen.
a. Amplification plots should be examined for every result with a “Data
Quality” message. From the Data tab, the user selects the curve to review and
then clicks Refresh. The software will draw the selected curves and adjust
the scale of the graph. A valid amplification curve shows a smooth,
exponential increase. An invalid amplification curve may be a non-
exponential or linear curve or a curve with data “spikes” where the curve may
cross the threshold. If the curve is valid after examination, the Ct value
reported may be used to determine if Flu A, Flu B, or RSV targets are
detected.
b. If the amplification curve is valid for Flu A, Flu B, or RSV, the RNA IC is
not required to be detected to report a positive result.
3. Interpretation of Results.
The interpretation of the assay specimen results is as follows:
Flu A Flu B RSV RNA IC

L. Test Principle:
The SimplexaTM Flu A/B & RSV assay is a nucleic acid amplification assay that uses
Real-Time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)
amplification to enable simultaneous and distinct detection of viral RNA from
influenza A, influenza B and RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs from human patients
with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection in conjunction with clinical and
epidemiological risk factors.
The assay combines real-time PCR amplification with fluorescent signal detection
technology. A bi-functional fluorescent probe-primer is used together with a reverse
primer to amplify a specific target (for each analyte and internal control). A
fluorescent signal is generated after the separation of the fluorophore from the
quencher as a result of the binding of a probe element to the extended RNA fragment
synthesized during amplification.
The 3M Integrated Cycler is a rapid real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction
thermocycler used for the identification of nucleic acid from prepared biological
samples. The instrument utilizes disk media to contain and to process samples. The
instrument uses real time flourometric detection to identify targets within the sample
wells. The instrument is controlled by an external computer running the Integrated
Cycler Studio Software. Together, the instrument, software and test kit are referred
to as the “Microfluidic Molecular System.”

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Inter-lot Precision
Inter-lot precision was assessed by testing three (3) samples and a positive
control for each target across three different lots. The panel of samples
consisted of high negative, low positive, and moderately positive samples for
each of influenza A, influenza B, and RSV. The samples were generated from
swabs and were run in triplicate. One operator at one study site made one
extraction of each sample and tested across lots.
The variability attributable to lot-to-lot imprecision was found by fitting the
appropriate general linear mixed model, with “lot” as a random variable, and
partitioning out the variance. Total variability was split into inter-lot
variability, and intra-lot variability (the unexplained variability, or error term
of the model). The inter-lot variability component is summarized in the tables
below. Imprecision estimates (%CV) for all samples in the panel were ≤5.4%.

1 For the purposes of calculating averages and variance components, samples that offered a negative result (Ct=0) were
assigned to a value of 40.0, as a value of 40.0 is more representative of negative samples which have Ct values at the
upper limit of the range.
Inter-laboratory, Inter-assay and Intra-assay Reproducibility
Sample pools of influenza A, influenza B, and RSV were created by spiking
concentrated stock of each virus into a matrix generated from negative swabs.
Three sample pools were generated per virus corresponding to high negative,
low positive, and medium positive levels of virus. Each sample was tested in
triplicate at three separate sites: one run per operator, per day, two operators
per site, at three sites for 5 days. Nine sample pools corresponding to the
three viruses, each at the three levels described earlier, were tested along with
No Template Control and Positive Control. No Template Control and Positive
Control were also tested in triplicate. A total of 990 samples were tested in
the reproducibility studies. Estimates of variability were determined with a
random effects model that includes run and site as predictors, with run nested
within site. This allowed for partitioning of the total variance to provide best
estimates of inter-assay, intra-assay, and inter-lab variability.
Three sites assessed the device's inter-laboratory reproducibility and
inter/intra-assay reproducibility. Site 1 performed the extraction using the
MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit and Sites 2 and 3
performed the extraction step using the NucliSENS® easyMAGTM System
(bioMérieux). All sample results were included in the analysis. The total
%CV at each site for positive samples ranged from 0.6% to 2.1% for FLU A,
from 0.5% to 6.7% for FLU B, and from 2.0% to 4.5% for RSV

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls
The following controls are provided in the Focus Diagnostics SimplexaTM Flu
A/B & RSV assay kit:
Positive Control (PC): The kit contains a Positive Control consisting of a
mixture of inactivated influenza A virus, inactivated influenza B virus, and
inactivated RSV. The PC, in conjunction with the SimplexaTM RNA Internal
Control, is used to verify reagent and system performance. The Positive
Control is meant to be a control for global failure of the assay (missing
reaction component, instrument failure, etc.). A Positive Control should be
included in each run.
RNA Internal Control (RNA IC): The RNA IC is an encapsulated RNA
sequence. The RNA IC is incorporated into every sample and is carried
through all steps of the procedure from nucleic acid isolation and purification
through amplification. The RNA IC is intended to monitor for PCR
inhibition.
No Template Control (NTC): The NTC consists of nuclease-free water and,
after addition of RNA IC, is taken through the RNA extraction process and

subsequent amplification and detection. The NTC reaction should not exhibit
fluorescence growth curves that cross the threshold line in any of the FLU A,
FLU B, or RSV detection channels but must provide a valid Ct value (Ct ≤40,
≠0) for the RNA IC. If any of the FLU A, FLU B, or RSV channels provide a
Ct value ≤40, ≠0 for the NTC, contamination may have occurred in one or
more components of the system. The NTC should be included in each run.
Quality control ranges have been established as indicated in the table below.
If the controls are not within these parameters, patient results should be
considered invalid and the assay repeated. Each laboratory should establish
its own Quality Control ranges and frequency of QC testing based on
applicable local laws, regulations and standard good laboratory practice.

d. Detection limits:
Analytical sensitivity was estimated for two strains of influenza A (A/PR/8/34
H1N1, A/Hong Kong/8/68 H3N2), two strains of influenza B (B/Great
Lakes/1739/54, B/Malaysia/2506/2004), and two strains of RSV (RSV A2,
RSV B2). The Limit of Detection (LoD) for each strain of virus was
determined by limiting dilution studies using quantified stocks of the viruses.
The viruses used in this study were grown, re-titered, and diluted with
negative swab matrix. A preliminary estimate of the LoD for each virus was
carried out by testing four dilutions of each virus around the theoretical LoD
with each dilution extracted three times using the Roche MagNA Pure LC
System. A single extraction of Positive Control (PC) and No Template
Control (NTC) were included in each extraction cartridge. Each extracted
sample and control was assayed in a single well. The lowest concentration at
which all three replicates were positive were taken as the tentative LoD.
Confirmation of LoD was determined over multiple runs. Each strain was
spiked into negative swab at the level of the preliminary LoD and extracted
using both the Roche MagNA Pure LC System and the NucliSENS easyMAG
extraction method. A single extraction of Positive Control (PC) and No
Template Control (NTC) was included in each run.
The LoD was determined as the lowest concentration that was detected ≥95%
of the time (i.e. concentration at which at least 19 out of 20 replicates were
determined to be positive). The tables below summarize the data obtained
during estimation of the preliminary LoD and confirmation of LoD for the six
viral strains.

Cross reactivity
A panel of thirty-two (32) potentially cross reacting microorganisms
representing common respiratory pathogens or flora commonly present in the
nasopharynx was evaluated for cross reactivity. Each potential cross reactant
was individually spiked at a high level into a negative swab matrix. The level
of each microorganism was determined by growing and titering the
microorganism listed. The unspiked matrix was also tested to serve as a
baseline. Samples were extracted with the Roche MagNA Pure LC System
and tested in triplicate to screen for cross reactivity. According to the study

Reactivity
In addition to the six viral strains tested for LoD, ten additional influenza A
strains, nine additional influenza B strains, and four additional strains of RSV
were tested for reactivity with the Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV assay. A
strain of 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus was included in the study. Each virus
tested for reactivity was diluted in negative swab matrix at 1.0 x 102
TCID /mL and extracted using the Roche MagNA Pure LC instrument. Each
50
strain was extracted in triplicate and assayed to provide an estimate of LoD.
If 3/3 replicates did not provide a positive result in the correct channel, an
additional dilution to provide a two-fold higher level of virus was created and
tested. The following table summarizes the additional strains of virus tested
for reactivity and the level of each strain of virus that provided 3/3 positive
results.

Competitive Interference
The Competitive Interference study evaluated the effects of clinically relevant
co-infections with each of the analytes probed by the assay. The study
assessed whether a high concentration of one virus in the specimen could
potentially affect the SimplexaTM FluA/B &RSV assay performance for
another target present at low levels in the multiplex assay. A low positive
sample was contrived at approximately 4 to 6 times the LoD for each target
(influenza A, influenza B and RSV), and a baseline Ct was determined for
each sample. A high level of each potential concomitant infecting virus was
spiked into the low level specimen as summarized in the table below.

*When very high levels of influenza A are present with low levels of RSV the signal from the RSV reaction may not be
adequate to be detected, due to competitive interference. When all three viruses are present at moderate levels (as in
the Positive Control) there is no evidence of competitive interference.
g. Assay cut-off:
Forty-five cycles of amplification were performed during assay development
to allow for the appropriate determination of assay cut off. Analysis of the
Limit of Detection study showed that all Ct values at the Limit of Detection
were <40 with the exception of one influenza A sample which gave a Ct result
>40. The Limit of Detection is defined as the lowest concentration of sample
where ≥ 95% of twenty replicates are detected. A review of the Method
Comparison (Clinical Performance) data showed that >95% of the positive
clinical specimens had a Ct value ≤35. Specimens that were positive for
influenza A had Ct values in the range 15.2 to 37.3. Specimens that were
positive for influenza B had Ct values in the range 16.5 to 34.0. Specimens
that were positive for RSV had Ct values in the range 16.0 to 41.4 with one
specimen giving a Ct value >40. The data thus indicate that Ct=40 is an
appropriate assay cut-off
h. Carry-over/Cross-Contamination
The study was designed by alternately placing high positive and high negative
(5 x 106 dilution of high positive) samples on both the MagNA Pure cartridge
for extraction and the Universal Disc for amplification. A total of 180 high
negative samples were tested across 5 runs. The sample size of 180 was
chosen to provide 80% power of detecting a carry over/contamination effect
of 5% or greater, with alpha = 0.05. The carryover effect was evaluated by
comparing the observed positive rate for the high negative samples with the
expected rate under normal reproducibility conditions. The purpose of
analysis was to determine if the positive rate for the high negative samples
was elevated beyond what was probable. A one sample, one sided test for a
proportion (binomial) was used to test for significance for all three FLU A,
FLU B, and RSV channels.
The baseline negative samples were positive 0% (0 of 90 replicates) of the
time for the FLU B and RSV channels and 1.1% (1of 90 replicates) of the
time for the FLUA channel. When tested with high positive samples, no
significant carry-over contamination effect was seen in any of the channels.
The data from the study are summarized in the table below.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with reference methods:
The performance of the SimplexaTM FluA/B &RSV assay was compared with
reference methods during testing of clinical specimens. For influenza A and
influenza B, the reference method was a high performance FDA cleared
nucleic acid test. For RSV, the reference method was culture/DFA.
b. Matrix Comparison:
Not applicable
c. Performance in Fresh vs. Frozen Clinical Specimens:
The performance of the SimplexaTM FluA/B &RSV assay was determined by
comparing fresh (never frozen, unextracted and tested within 72 hours of
collection) versus frozen (unextracted) clinical specimens. A panel of one
hundred and eighty (180) nasopharyngeal swab specimens including sixty
(60) positive swabs for each virus (influenza A, influenza B, RSV) was
contrived for testing so that they covered the range expected from clinical
specimens. Three aliquots of each sample were prepared, representing fresh,
short-term frozen (at least 2 hours frozen at -20ºC) and long-term frozen (at
least 7 days frozen at -70ºC) states. All testing was performed at Focus
Diagnostics using one Simplexa ™ Flu A/B & RSV lot.
The plots of short-term frozen Ct values and long-term frozen Ct values vs.
fresh Ct values visually show the existence of a linear relationship.
Additionally, for all comparisons, the value of the coefficient of determination
(R2) is greater than 0.95, meaning that at least 95% of the variation seen in the
frozen (short-term and long-term) Ct values are explained by the variation
seen in fresh Ct values.
The slopes, along with the 95% confidence interval and percent bias for the
above comparisons, are summarized in the following table. The 95%
confidence interval indicates that slope estimates are not statistically
significant at 5% level of significance. The observed bias for both short-term
and long-term frozen Ct values is small and is not clinically significant. This

1 For the purposes of regression analysis, samples that offered a negative result (Ct=0) were assigned to a
value of 40.0, as a value of 40.0 is more representative of negative samples which have Ct values at the
upper limit of the range.
d. Extraction Efficiency:
Assessment of the equivalence of the two extraction methods was determined
by several approaches: (1) One clinical testing site performed Clinical
Performance and Reproducibility studies using the MagNA Pure LC Total
Nucleic Acid Isolation kit and two sites used the NucliSENS easyMAg system
and (2) Determinations of Limit of Detection were carried out using both
extraction systems. Based on the results from these studies, there does not appear
to be any significant difference in the performance of the SimplexaTM FluA/B
&RSV assay using either the MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation kit
or the NucliSENS easyMAg system.
3. Clinical studies:
Three external testing sites participated in the Clinical Agreement Study.
Reference results for influenza A and influenza B viruses were generated using a
high performance FDA cleared nucleic acid test (NAT). Reference results for
RSV were generated using culture/DFA. Culture/DFA results were carried
forward from the results obtained at the time of sample collection or banking. A
total of 735 nasopharyngeal swabs specimens were obtained from a combination
of prospectively collected specimens (n = 558) and retrospective, banked
specimens (n=177) from patients with signs and symptoms of viral respiratory
tract infection.
Prospective samples were collected in Southern United States from 26-February-
2010 to 24-March-2010 and in Australia from 04-July-2010 to 17-August-2010.
Three (3) samples were excluded from the prospective analysis due to
“Unresolved” status on the reference nucleic acid assay and two (2) samples were
excluded due to “invalid” status on the Simplexa assay. The samples remained
unresolved or invalid upon repeat testing. One (1) sample was excluded from the
prospective analysis due to lack of culture/DFA result for RSV. Due to the low
prevalence rate of influenza during the collection period and the rareness of RSV
in the adult population, retrospectively collected specimens from the, 2008 – 2009

and early 2010 influenza and RSV seasons in Eastern and Mid-Western United
States from patients with signs and symptoms of viral respiratory tract infection
were also evaluated (n = 177); of the 177 samples collected 47 were not analyzed
by culture/DFA for influenza A or influenza B.
The clinical samples were tested at three sites. One site extracted specimens
using the MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation kit and the other two
sites used the NucliSENS easyMAg system. No apparent different difference in
clinical performance was observed for the two extraction systems. The clinical
performance of the SimplexaTM FluA/B &RSV assay is summarized in the

O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Microfluidic Molecular System includes the computer, related peripherals,
handheld barcode scanner, Integrated Cycler, Integrated Cycler Studio software
and operator manual. The Integrated Cycler is a Real-Time Polymerase Chain
Reaction (PCR) thermocycler used for detection of nucleic acid from prepared
biological samples. The instrument utilizes disc media to contain and to process
samples and real-time fluorometric detection to identify targets within the sample
wells. The instrument’s operation parameters are controlled by the use of an
external personal computer and associated software. The disc can process up to 96
independent samples.
The Roche MagNA Pure LC is an automated nucleic acid isolation and
purification system based upon binding of nucleic acids to glass particles and has
the capability to process a total of 32 reactions within one run. Nucleic acid is
purified in multiple plastic reaction tips and cartridges by several steps that
include cell lysis and binding of nucleic acid to magnetic glass particles, wash
steps, and a heated elution to unbind the nucleic acid from the glass particles.
The bioMérieux NucliSens easyMAG is an automated nucleic acid isolation and
purification system that is based upon the same silica extraction technology as the
MagNA Pure. The easyMAG is capable of processing a total of 24 reactions with
variable sample types, sample volumes, and elution volumes within a single run.
Nucleic acid is purified within a single cartridge by several steps that include lysis
and binding of nucleic acid to high affinity magnetic silica beads, a series of wash
steps and heated elution of purified nucleic acid from the silica beads.

6. Quality Control:
The following controls are provided:
Positive Control (PC): A mixture of inactivated influenza A virus, inactivated
influenza B virus, and inactivated RSV. The PC, in conjunction with the RNA IC is
used to verify reagent and system performance. The positive control is meant to be a
control for global failure of the assay (missing reaction component, instrument
failure, etc.). A positive control should be included in each run.
RNA Internal Control (RNA IC): The RNA IC is an encapsulated RNA sequence.
The RNA IC is incorporated into every sample and is carried through all steps of
the procedure from nucleic acid isolation and purification through amplification.
The RNA IC is intended to monitor for PCR inhibition..
No Template Control (NTC): The NTC consists of nuclease-free water and, after
addition of RNA IC, is taken through the RNA extraction process and subsequent
amplification and detection. The NTC reaction should not exhibit fluorescence
growth curves that cross the threshold line in any of the FLU A, FLU B, or RSV
detection channels but must provide a valid Ct value (Ct ≤40, ≠0) for the RNA IC. If
any of the FLU A, FLU B, or RSV channels provide a Ct value ≤40, ≠0 for the NTC,
contamination may have occurred in one or more components of the system. The
NTC should be included in each run.
