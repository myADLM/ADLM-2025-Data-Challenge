See indication(s) for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The CYBOW Reader 300 and CYBOW Reader 720 urine chemistry analyzers are semi-
automated analyzers intended to be used with CYBOW 11 and CYBOW 10 Reagent
Strips as a test system to semi-quantitatively or qualitatively measure the specified
analytes in urine as follows: glucose, urobilinogen, pH, ketone, occult blood, protein,
bilirubin, ascorbic acid, nitrite, leukocyte, and specific gravity. These measurements are

I. Device Description:
The CYBOW Reader 300 and CYBOW Reader 720 urinalysis systems are intended for use
with CYBOW 11 and CYBOW 10 reagent strips for the qualitative and semi-quantitative
determination of urine analytes including glucose, urobilinogen, pH, ketone, occult blood,
protein, bilirubin, ascorbic acid, nitrite, leukocyte, and specific gravity. The CYBOW 10
reagent strips are identical to the CYBOW 11 reagent strips except they do not include an
ascorbic acid test pad. Urine color may be entered manually by the operator, however the test
system does not compensate for urine color
The CYBOW Reader 300 has a test throughput of 300 tests per hour versus the CYBOW
Reader 720 which has a test throughput of 720 tests per hour. They are technologically very
similar and each analyzer includes a built-in printer. An optional barcode reader is available.
The CYBOW Reader 720 has a waste box for used reagent strips whereas on the CYBOW
300 the used strips must be dispensed manually by the user.

L. Test Principle:
The CYBOW Reader 300 and CYBOW Reader 720 are reflectance photometers that analyze
the intensity and color of light reflected from the reagent areas of the urinalysis reagent strip.
Using a light emitting diode (LED) as the light source and a contact image sensor (CIS)
module, the optical system reads the color change in the urine strips after the sample is
applied.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor evaluated precision of the test systems using two levels of control
materials (MAS Urinalysis Control, Level 1 and Level 2). Precision was performed
at three point of care sites by three operators on the CYBOW Reader 300 and
CYBOW Reader 720 urine chemistry analyzers.
The within run precision study included three different CYBOW Reader 300 and
CYBOW Reader 720 urine chemistry analyzers and three lots of urine test strips.
Each operator tested ten test strips from each lot number on each analyzer in one
testing day.
The within day precision study included three different CYBOW Reader 300 and
CYBOW Reader 720 urine chemistry analyzers and three lots of urine test strips.
Each operator tested each lot of test strips on each analyzer, once per day for 10 days.
The results for the three testing sites combined are summarized in the following
tables:

testing pooled, negative urine spiked with commercially available standards to
specific target concentrations. Each concentration of analyte was tested 10 times,
across 3 lots of strips for a total of 30 measurements at each concentration. The study

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The stability characteristics of the strips was reviewed under k052525
d. Detection limit:
The sensitivity of the test strips when read by CYBOW Reader 300 and CYBOW
Reader 720 analyzers was determined by spiking positive urine samples with known
concentrations for each analyte. Each urine sample was tested with three lots of test
strips in 10 replicates, for a total of 30 replicates. Sensitivity was defined as the
concentration in which 95% of the contrived pooled measurements were trace or
positive. *For urobilinogen, the sensitivity study represents the concentration in
which 95% of the measurements were positive at the first above normal color pad.
Test Claim Point at which sensitivity
(Package Insert CYBOW 11) meets criteria of >95%
detection
Urobilinogen 2 mg/dL* 2 mg/dL*
Glucose 100mg/dL 100mg/dL
Bilirubin 1mg/dL 1mg/dL
Ketones 5mg/dL 5mg/dL
Blood 5 RBC/ uL 5 RBC/ uL
Protein 15mg/dL 15mg/dL
Nitrite 0.05mg/dL 0.05mg/dL
Leukocytes 15-25 Leu/μL 15 Leu/μL
Ascorbic Acid 20mg/dL 20mg/dL
The lower limits of detection for pH and Specific Gravity are 5 and 1.000
respectively.
e. Analytical specificity:
The effect of potentially interfering substances was evaluated using the CYBOW 300
and CYBOW 720 readers and CYBOW 11 test strips. The sponsor tested medically
relevant concentrations of each substance using urine pools spiked with
concentrations of analyte corresponding to the claimed assay ranges of the devices.
All potential result/color blocks were evaluated. The results are summarized below.

The labeling clearly states that the test system does not compensate for urine color.
However, urine color may be documented by the operator in the test report.

f. Assay cut-off:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were performed with clinical samples at three point of
care sites. The performance of the CYBOW Reader 300 and CYBOW Reader 720
with CYBOW 11 test strips was compared to the predicate device with Multistix®
10SG test strips). For ascorbic acid, performance was compared to the Uriscan S-300
with Uriscan 11SG test strips (k980047). The sponsor states that the operators at the
point of care sites had education backgrounds similar to those individuals expected to
be the intended users of the device.
Fresh urines were obtained at the different clinical sites. They were evaluated using
three lots of test strips and three serial numbers of CYBOW Reader 300 and CYBOW
Reader 720 analyzers. The summarized results are found in the tables below.

b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable, the device is only intended for urine specimens.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
References for the analyte expected values are stated in the labeling based on literature.
N. Instrument Name:
CYBOW Reader 300 and CYBOW Reader 720
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Semi-automated. User performs test strip procedure then loads the test strip onto
analyzer.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___x_____ or No ________
23

--- Page 24 ---
3. Specimen Identification:
Manual or by barcode reader
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The instructions state that users should collect urine in clean, dry container and test as
soon as possible.
5. Calibration:
Calibration strips are used for calibration. They are plastic white strips with defined
reflectance characteristics. Calibration should be performed prior to first use of the
analyzer and then every 4 weeks using the calibration strip provided with the analyzer.
Each strip should only be used once. Users should contact Customer Service for
information on obtaining additional strips.
6. Quality Control:
Recommendations for quality control are described in the labeling. Additionally, users
should follow local, state and federal regulations.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
None
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
