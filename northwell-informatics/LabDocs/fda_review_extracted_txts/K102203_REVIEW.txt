H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Chemtron Biotech, Inc.’s Chemtrue® Single/Multi-Panel Drug Screen Cassette
and Dip Card Tests are rapid chromatographic immunoassays for the qualitative
detection of up to six of the following drugs in a variety of combinations in human
urine. The designed cutoff concentrations and direct calibrator for these drugs are as
follows:
Analyte Abbreviation Calibrator Cutoff
Concentration
Amphetamine AMP Amphetamine 1000 ng/ml
Cocaine COC Benzoylecgonine 300 ng/ml
Marijuana THC 11-nor-Δ9-THC9-COOH 50 ng/ml
Methamphetamine MET Methamphetamine 1000 ng/ml
Opiates OPI/MOR Morphine 300 ng/ml
Phencyclidine PCP Phencyclidine 25 ng/ml
The Chemtrue® Single/Multi-Panel Drug Screen Cassette and Dip Card are intended
for qualitative detection of drugs of abuse for health care professionals, in vitro
diagnostic use and prescription use ONLY. It is not intended for point-of-care
settings or over the counter use.
This assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific
alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical
result. Gas Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) or Liquid
Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) are the preferred confirmatory
methods. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any
drugs of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only. Not for Point-of-Care use
2

--- Page 3 ---
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable, as the devices are visually-read single-use devices.
I. Device Description:
Chemtrue® Single/Multi Drug Screen DOA test kits has two formats: cassette and
dipstick. Each kit contains 25 or 50 devices and each device contains the reagent
strip(s) housed in a separate strip channel in the plastic holder. These devices are
used to obtain visual qualitative results for the following analytes: amphetamine,
cocaine, methamphetamine, Opiates (morphine 300) Phencyclidine, and THC.
Materials Required But Not Provided: Specimen collection container, timer, external
urine controls
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None were referenced.
L. Test Principle:
Chemtron Biotech’s Chemtrue® Single/Multi Drug Screen tests are a one-step lateral
flow immunoassay containing a conjugate pad with colloidal gold conjugate with
anti-drug antibodies, a nitrocellulose membrane with a test line (T) and a control line
(C). The T line is coated with drug antigen bound to bovine protein and the C line is
coated with goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies. The test is a competitive binding
immunoassay in which drugs and drug metabolites in a urine sample compete with
immobilized drug conjugate for limited labeled antibody binding sites. When a
sufficient amount of sample is applied the sample migrates through the test device by
capillary action. If the concentration of drug is below the cutoff level, the anti-drug
antibodies in the colloidal gold particles will bind to the drug antigens coated in the
test zone producing a band which indicates a negative result. If the drug
concentration is at the cutoff level or higher no band will form in the test zone
indicating a preliminary positive. A band should form in the control region regardless
of the presence of drug or drug metabolite in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision study was conducted by three operators. Three different lots
were tested for all 6 analytes performed for 10 devices/lot at each control level
of Negative, -50%, -25%, cut-off, +25%, and +50% of the cut-off. The study
was conducted in non-consecutive 10 days using GC/MS confirmed
commercial urine controls. The controls were blinded according to a random
table and then evenly distributed to three operators. Each device was tested
and interpreted by the same operator. The total of ten days run data were
grouped into three sets: 3-day, 3-day, and 4 day. Summaries are presented in
4

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This device has internal process controls. A colored line appearing in the
control region confirms sufficient sample volume and adequate membrane
wicking. Users are informed that the test is invalid if a line fails to appear in
the control region.
Control standards are not supplied with this device; however it is good
laboratory practice to confirm the test procedure and to verify proper test
performance. Users should follow all applicable guidelines for testing QC
materials.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical performance of the device around the cutoff is described in Section
f. (Assay cut-off) below.
e. Analytical specificity:
A prescreen test was conducted by diluting all structurally related compounds
with the negative urine pool to give a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml and
tested in 2 duplicates with test devices. For all compounds which give
positive test results were retested with a 1 to 10 serially diluted solution
(10µg/ml, 1µg/ml, 0.1µg/ml, etc.) to find out a rough cutoff range. The
serially diluted samples were tested until the operator observes a negative
result. The following compounds were tested for cross-reactivity in the drug
strip:
The following compounds were found to produce positive results when tested
at levels greater than the concentrations (ng/ml) listed below:
Amphetamine
Compounds Concentration (ng/mL)
d-amphetamine 1000
d-methamphetamine >10000

Interference Studies:
Interference studies were performed using the dip card and cassette tests using
urine controls at +/-25% and +/-50% of each analyte cut-off concentration.
Potential interferences to the Chemtrue® Single/Multi-Panel Drug Screen
Cassette and Dip Card Tests were evaluated by adding various drugs, drug
metabolites, and other compounds (structurally unrelated and endogenous
compounds) that are commonly found in the urine which may interfere with
testing results. All potential interferents were tested at concentrations of 100
µg/mL. Any false positive or negative results using the +/-25% cut-off urine
analyte concentrations were then retested at +/-50% of the cut-off. No
interferences were observed at the +/-50% of the cut-off analyte
concentration. The following compounds were found not to cross react when
tested at concentrations of 100µg/mL.
Endogenous Compounds:
Albumin, Bilirubin, Cholesterol, Creatinine, Glucose, Hemoglobin, Riboflavin
Sodium Chloride, Uric Acid

Evaluation of SG and pH on test results:
To evaluate the effect of pH value on the test results, urine controls at 50%
and 150% of the cutoff value were used. Each control level was adjusted by
either 1N NaOH solution or 1N HCl to the pH levels at 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0,
5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0 and 8.5. Each test sample was tested in duplicates.
To evaluate the effect of specific gravity, urine controls at +/-25% and
+/_50% of the cut-off values were spiked with DI water or sugar to obtain
specific gravities of 1.002, 1.010, 1.015, 1.020,1.025, and 1.030.
The testing results demonstrate that varying specific gravities and pH’s do not
affect urine testing results around each analyte cut-off.

performed with three lots of each product format (dip card and cassette) in ten
non-consecutive days by three operators using blind coded commercial

25% above the cut-off, and 50% above the cut-off levels.

The concentration of two discrepant specimens was confirmed with GC/MS to be close to
the cutoff value.
