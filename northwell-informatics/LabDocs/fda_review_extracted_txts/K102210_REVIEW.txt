The LZI Amphetamines 500 Drugs of Abuse (DAU) Calibrators are for use as
calibrators in the qualitative and semi-quantitative calibration of the LZI
Amphetamines Enzyme Immunoassay.
The LZI Amphetamines 500 Drugs of Abuse (DAU) Controls are for use as
assayed quality control materials to monitor the precision of the LZI
Amphetamines 500 Enzyme Immunoassay.
The assay provides only a preliminary analytical result. A more specific
alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed
analytical result. Gas or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS or
LC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method). Clinical consideration and
professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result,
particularly when the preliminary test result is positive.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Performance data was provided for Hitachi 717 analyzer. The assay can be used
on a clinical chemistry analyzer capable of measuring absorbance at 340
nanometers.
I. Device Description:
The LZI Amphetamines 500 Homogeneous Enzyme Immunoassay consists of two
separately packaged reagents (R1 and R2):
Reagent Description
R1 Contains two mouse monoclonal anti-amphetamines antibodies,
glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD),
stabilizers and sodium azide as a preservative.
R2 Contains amphetamines-labeled glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PDH) in buffer with sodium azide as a preservative.
Each LZI Amphetamines 500 Drugs of Abuse Calibrator kit contains five calibrators
comprised of a human urine matrix containing buffers, stabilizers and less than 0.1%
of sodium azide. The controls are prepared by spiking known concentrations of d-
methamphetamine into the drug-free matrix. The calibrators cover the calibration
range of the assay (0 to 2,000 ng/mL) and are at the following concentrations:
Calibrator Target Concentration
(ng/mL)
Negative Calibrator 0

The precision studies were performed according to CLSI EP5-A2. Samples
were prepared by spiking a negative human urine pool with either d-
methamphetamine or d-amphetamine at the following concentrations: zero
drug (-100%), -75%, -50%, and -25% below the cutoff, cutoff, and +25%,
+50%, +75%, and +100% above the cutoff. Samples were tested in 2

Linear regression analysis of the results yielded the following:
Amphetamine: y = 0.9447x + 24.34, r² = 0.9978.
Methamphetamine: y = 0.9717x + 5.734, r² = 0.9971.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
A stock solution of 1000 μg/mL d-methamphetamine purchased from a
commercial source is spiked into the calibrator and controls to the desired
concentration. The concentration of the calibrator and controls are confirmed
by GC/MS. The sponsor claimed an open vial stability of 18 months at 2 to
8oC for the calibrator and control bottles. After the calibrator and control
bottles are initially opened, the screw-on caps can be resealed.
d. Detection limit:
Performance at low drug concentrations in the semi-quantitative assay was
characterized by determination of recovery (see section M1b above).
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor prepared urine-free samples spiked with d-amphetamine or d-
methamphetamine at control levels (±25% of the 500 ng/mL cutoff
concentration) and evaluated the possible interference from endogenous
compounds on the Hitachi 717 analyzer. No positive or negative interference
due to endogenous compounds tested was observed. The results are listed
below.

To test for possible positive and/or negative interference from specific gravity, the
sponsor prepared samples containing d-amphetamine or d-methamphetamine at
control levels (±25% of the 500 ng/mL cutoff concentration) with specific gravities
ranging from 1.002 to 1.030. No positive or negative interference due to specific
gravity was observed.
To test for potential positive or negative interference from pH the sponsor
prepared samples containing d-amphetamine or d-methamphetamine at control
levels (±25% of the 500 ng/mL cutoff concentration) with pH values of 3, 4.5, 5,
6, 7, 8 and 11. No negative interference due to pH was observed.
Cross reactivity of various potential interfering drugs were tested by spiking a
final concentration of up to 500,000 ng/mL of each substance into drug free urine,
and then evaluated with the assay’s calibrated dose-response curve. The following
table summarizes the approximate quantity of each compound that is equivalent in
assay reactivity to the 500 ng/mL d-Methamphetamine cutoff. The sponsor
claimed cross-reactivity with four compounds: PMA, MDA, MDMA, and
Fenfluramine. The results are presented below.

f. Assay cut-off:
There is a 500 ng/mL cutoff concentration claimed for both d-amphetamine
and methamphetamine.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor conducted two separate method comparison studies to evaluate
the performance of the device for detection of d-methamphetamine or d-
amphetamine. For method comparison study for the detection of
amphetamine, one hundred and eleven unaltered samples (55 negative and 56
positive samples) were tested with LZI Amphetamines 500 Enzyme
Immunoassay on the Hitachi 717 analyzer and compared against the results
(d-amphetamine and d-methamphetamine concentration) obtained with
GC/MS or LC/MS. The results of the studies are presented below:
