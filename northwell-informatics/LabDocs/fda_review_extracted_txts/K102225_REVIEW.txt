I. Device Description:
Alco-Breath Tube breath alcohol test
The Alco- Breath Tube is a visually read semi-quantitative test for the detection of
alcohol in exhaled breath. It indicates relative Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC)
between 0 and 0.08 (ABT -08) or 0.15 (ABT-15). The device consists of two parts, a
glass tube containing treated silica gel and a balloon assembly.
CheckPoint breath alcohol test
The Breath Alcohol Test is a visually read semi-quantitative test for the detection of
alcohol in exhaled breath. It indicates relative Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) at
four different cut-off levels (0.02, 0.04, 0.05, and 0.08% BAC). The device is designed as

Screening Devices to Measure Alcohol in Bodily Fluids
L. Test Principle:
The Breath Alcohol Detector consists of crystals that employ a solid-phase chemistry system
based on a chromogenic chemical reaction. Alcohol, if present in the exhaled breath, reacts
with the coated crystals to produce a color change. This color change is proportional to the
concentration of alcohol in the breath, which is an approximation of relative Blood Alcohol
Concentration (BAC). The light yellow crystals produce a color change when alcohol vapors
are oxidized to acid and the indicator chemical changes to chromic ion. Results are
interpreted as positive when the majority of the crystals change from yellow to green. This
indicates that alcohol vapors are present at a concentration approximately equal to the value
indicated on the tube for Alco breath tube or greater than or equal to the cutoff for the Breath
alcohol test.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Alco-Breath Tube:
The ABT-08 can measure between 0.00 - 0.08% BAC and the ABT-15 measures BAC
between 0.00 - 0.15%. The ABT – 08 tester was evaluated at 0.00, 0.016, and 0.064%
BAC. For this study, any result less than 0.04% BAC was interpreted as negative and any
result greater than 0.04% BAC was interpreted as positive.
The ABT – 15 was evaluated at 0, 0.032, and 0.128% BAC. For this study, any result less
than 0.08% BAC was interpreted as negative and any result greater than 0.08% BAC was
interpreted as positive.
Blood Alcohol Concentrations were simulated by a Breath Alcohol Sample Simulator
(BASS), which provides an alcohol-in-air test sample with known alcohol concentrations,
flow rate, and air composition. Five different lighting conditions were tested: Fluorescent,
daylight, incandescent, sodium vapor, and mercury vapor.
Testing was performed by 3 operators, 3 days, and up to 3 lots for a total of 600 results..
For the ABT–08 device, testing consisted of: 200 trials at a Blood Alcohol Concentration

--- Page 5 ---
(BAC) of 0.064, 200 trials at a BAC of 0.016, and 20 trials at a BAC of 0.000. For the
ABT–15 device, testing consisted of 20 trials at a BAC of 0.128, 20 trials at a BAC of
0.032, and 20 trials at a BAC of 0.000.

CheckPoint® Breath Alcohol Test:
For each of the CheckPoint® Breath Alcohol Test device type (with cut-off levels of 0.02,
0.04, 0.05, and 0.08) testing was performed by 3 operators, over 3 days, and up to 3 lots for
a total of 600 results. Blood Alcohol Concentrations are simulated by a Breath Alcohol
Sample Simulator (BASS), which provides an alcohol-in-air test sample with known
alcohol concentrations, flow rate, and air composition. The simulator is used to produce a
simulated breath sample at - 60% cut-off and + 60% cut-off. Five different lighting
conditions were tested: Fluorescent, daylight, incandescent, sodium vapor, and mercury
vapor.
For devices with 0.02 cut-off level, tests consist of: 200 trials at a Blood Alcohol
Concentration (BAC) of 0.032, 20 trials at a BAC of 0.008, and 200 trials at a BAC of
0.000. For devices with 0.04 cut-off level, tests consisted of 200 trials at a BAC of 0.064,
200 trials at a BAC of 0.016, and 200 trials at a BAC of 0.000. For devices with 0.05 cut-
off level, tests consist of 200 trials at a BAC of 0.080, 200 trials at a BAC of 0.020, and
200 trials at a BAC of 0.000. For devices with 0.08 cut-off level, tests consisted of 200
trials at a BAC of 0.128, 200 trials at a BAC of 0.032, and 200 trials at a BAC of 0.000.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
Alcohol standard solutions at various BAC concentrations were prepared from
commercially available solutions and are verified on a certified evidential breath alcohol
tester. These solutions were used to verify the cut-off concentration of the devices during
manufacture.
Stability
The sponsor provided data to confirm that the CheckPoint breath alcohol test was stable
for a period of up to three years from date of manufacture and the Alco-Breath Tube was
stable for a period of 18 months from date of manufacture when stored at 50 – 85o F.
d. Detection limit:

The NHTSA guidelines do not specifically address the detection limit of breath alcohol
devices but require testing at a % BAC of zero (blank reading) to assess the possibility of
false positives. Precision studies included zero concentration samples in which
nonalcoholic human breath was used as the sample. There were no false positives
observed when measuring zero concentration samples. See above for precision testing.
e. Analytical specificity:
1. Cigarette smoke
Tests were conducted for each device to evaluate the potential interference on the test
results from cigarette smoke. For the Alco-Breath Tube Test, both the ABT – 08 and
ABT-15 testers were evaluated. For the CheckPoint® Breath Alcohol Test, tests were
conducted for each device cut-off level, 0.02%, 0.04%, 0.05% and 0.08%.
A trained operator conducted the study with volunteers to produce a total of five trials.
An alcohol-free volunteer was asked to smoke approximately one half of a cigarette and
perform an alcohol test. The volunteer smoked another inhalation and repeated the test to
produce a total of five trials. Results of this study show that the devices at each cut-off
level produces no positive results from cigarette smoke.

Tests were conducted for each device to evaluate the potential interference on the test
results from varying temperatures. For the Alco-Breath Tube Test both the ABT – 08 and

conducted for each device cut-off level, 0.02%, 0.04%, 0.05% and 0.08%.

f. Assay cut-off:
The CheckPoint® devices produce a blue/green or green/blue color at 0.02%, 0.04%,
0.05%, and 0.08% cut-off levels.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor performed a consumer study to determine if consumers could correctly use
and interpret the devices using only the supplied User’s Manual, and to compare the
results to a professional quantitative device. For this study, the test was conducted by
trained operator(s) and volunteer subject(s). The Alco Breath Tube Test and the
CheckPoint® Breath Alcohol Test were compared against an evidentiary alcohol test
device.
Thirty (30) drinking subjects were paired with thirty (30) non-drinking subjects. The
nondrinking subjects administered breath tests throughout the evening to the drinking

subjects. The tests were performed using the manufacturer’s test protocol supplied with
the device.
Alco-Breath Tube Comparison study
Sixty-two results as measured by the evidential device fell within the 0 – 0.08% BAC measuring
range of the ABT-08 tester. Simple linear regression produces a slope of 0.91, an intercept of 0
and a correlation coefficient of 0.86.
Seven results read greater than 0.08% BAC with the evidential device and read 0.08% BAC (the
highest possible reading) on the ABT device.
Four results read greater than 0.08% BAC with the evidential device but less than 0.08% BAC on
the ABT device, as follows:
ABT Evidential
0.04 0.110
0.07 0.131
0.07 0.138
0.04 0.167
The sponsor includes the following in the Warnings, Precautions, and Limitations section
of the labeling:
“Do not use this test to determine if it is safe for you to drive. The actual result may be
significantly higher or lower than indicated by this product. The Alco-Breath Tube is not
intended to legally determine the presence of alcohol or concentration of alcohol in a
person. This product should be used only as a screening device and is only an indication
of the possible presence of alcohol in the blood of the user. The exact level of alcohol in
the blood cannot be accurately determined by using this product.”
