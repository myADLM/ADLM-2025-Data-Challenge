L. Test Principle:
The OSOM C. difficile toxin A/B test is a qualitative assay using
immunochromatographic dipstick technology. It is a sandwich immunoassay with a
single test zone on the nitrocellulose dipstick to detect toxin A and/or toxin B and a
single control line zone to indicate proper sample flow. If the toxins are present in the
sample, they will bind to blue colored latex particles conjugated to a monoclonal
antibody against toxin B or a polyclonal antibody against toxin A and will form a
partial immune complex. The test stick, when placed in the sample mixture, initiates
sample migration along the nitrocellulose membrane. If toxin A or toxin B is present,
a blue/gray line will appear in the test line region indicating a positive result. A red
control line must appear for the results to be valid. If C. difficile toxins are not

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility study was conducted by 2 lab personnel per day at 3 sites-
one in-house site and two health centers (a small and large hospital clinical
laboratory). A coded panel of 12 samples was prepared in a stool matrix and
included C. difficile toxin A and toxin B. The panel was comprised of 3
negative, 3 high negative, 3 low positive and 3 moderate positive samples.
Each set was run twice per day for a period of 5 days at the three sites.
Positive and negative assay controls were included. The two runs on any
given day at each site were performed by a different operator. The OSOM C.
difficile Toxin A/B test gave the expected result 99.2% (357/360) of the time.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Shelf life for the OSOM C. difficile toxin A/B test was initially estimated by
accelerated stability testing with 2 lots at 2-8° C, 22° C, 37 and 45° C for 35
days of testing. Testing included 6 replicates on Day 0 and 3 replicates on all
other days using in-house C. difficile Toxin A and Toxin B QC controls
(Toxoid A and Toxoid B standards purified from C. difficile strain (ATCC:
VPI 10643) with immunoreactivity confirmed by commercially available
ELISA. Observed results predicted >24 months stability for both the OSOM
test kit and the kit controls. Real time stability was examined for 2 kit lots
stored at 2-8 ° C for up to 2.2 years. Stability for external controls was also
examined when stored at 2-8°C. Observed results showed all positive control
results remained positive and all negative control results remained negative
for all lots and all time points. The test kit and controls have a stability in
excess of 24 months.
Stool sample storage conditions were also established in a study using 2
reagent lots with 3 toxin-positive and 3 toxin-negative stool samples. Results
from the study showed that stool samples for the test can be stored up to 4
hours at room temperature, up to 72 hours when refrigerated at (2-8°C), or up
to 2 months if stored frozen (-20°C).

d. Detection limit:
The OSOM C. difficile toxin A/B test detected 15 ng/mL for toxin A and 40
ng/mL for toxin B. These studies were conducted with 3 representative lots
using a serial dilution series prepared from purified C. difficile toxin A and
toxin B in a buffer matrix.
The limit of detection was also examined in a stool matrix dilution series. An
antigen dilution series was prepared by spiking the stool matrix with C.
difficile toxin A & B standard diluted to a concentration of 480ng/mL. Two-
fold dilutions of the toxin-stool-matrix were prepared to generate the series
(480, 240, 120, 60, 30, 15, 8 ng/mL). Stool matrix by composition is a non-
homogenous mixture which can introduce variability in a dilution series. The
limit of detection results in the stool matrix were consistent with those
determined in the buffer matrix.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-Reactivity
The OSOM C. difficile Toxin A/B Test was evaluated with bacterial and viral
isolates. All testing was performed in a diarrhea matrix except where noted.
Cross-reactivity testing was performed with materials obtained from ATCC.
Bacterial isolates were tested at a concentration of 108 cfu/mL except where
noted. All viruses were cultured to ensure viability and tested at the specified
concentrations. All bacteria listed gave negative responses. All viruses listed
produced negative responses.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Stool samples were collected from a total of 1274 adult patients at 5 sites in
the United States. The specimens were tested for C. difficile by cytotoxicity
assay (CTA) and the OSOM C. difficile Toxin A/B Test. The samples were
de-identified, excess, loose or watery stool specimens obtained from patients
ranging from 18 yrs. to > 90 years old. Of the 1274 stool specimens in the
study, 577 were from males and 697 were from females. Stool consistency
was observed as 547 loose stools and 727 watery stools. The specimens were
submitted to the lab for C. difficile-associated disease (CDAD) testing.
Specimens were tested with the OSOM C. difficile Toxin A/B test within 72
hrs of receipt. A standard C. difficile toxin cytotoxicity assay was also
performed. The performance of the OSOM C. difficile Toxin A/B Test was
determined for clinical sensitivity and specificity against the results from the
reference method, CTA. The results from this analysis with 95% confidence
intervals are summarized in the Table below.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Clostridium difficile is the most frequently identified cause of nosocomial
diarrhea, accounting for 15%-25% of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and
more than 95% of cases of pseudomembranous colitis.1, 3 CDI is primarily a
nosocomial disease, and therefore the rate of infection may vary from location to
location. Risks for infection include length of hospitalization, patient age,
antibiotic use, severity of underlying disease and gastrointestinal surgery or
procedures.8 Test results should be used in conjunction with the patient’s clinical
information as asymptomatic colonization with C. difficile and its toxins can be
seen in some healthy adults, up to 50% of cystic fibrosis patients and up to 50%
of infants.4 In a prospective clinical study involving the OSOM C. difficile Toxin
A/B Test at 5 independent sites, an overall prevalence rate of 8.0% (102/1274)
