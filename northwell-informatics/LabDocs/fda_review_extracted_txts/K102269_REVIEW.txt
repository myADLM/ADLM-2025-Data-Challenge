All human material should be considered potentially infectious. All products derived
from human blood are prepared exclusively from the blood of donors tested
individually and shown to be free from HBsAg and antibodies to HCV and HIV. The
testing methods applied were FDA-approved or cleared in compliance with the
European Directive 98/79/EC, Annex II, List A. However, as no testing method can
rule out the potential risk of infection with absolute certainty, the material should be
treated just as carefully as a patient specimen.

L. Test Principle:
Calibration verification is not a requirement of the Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay
systems based on the manufacturer’s recommendations.
However, in instances where such a test procedure is required by certification
agencies, or where the user wishes to document calibration verification, these
CalCheck 5 solutions are used for such testing.

Expected Values and Value Ranges
For each Elecsys IgE CalCheck 5 lot manufactured, the CalChecks are run in
duplicate on at least three E170 analyzers. The assigned value of each
CalCheck is defined as the median value obtained over at least 6
determinations (duplicate runs on at least 3 analyzers) of the respective
CalCheck. (i.e. Elecsys 2010 and E170). Pre-determined acceptance criteria
for IgE recovery must be met for each control lot. The target value for each
CalCheck is the median of the observed values. IgE expected values and value
ranges are lot dependent and are listed in the lot-specific value sheet. Test
results must fall within the range printed on the lot-specific value sheet. The
labeling states that laboratories should establish appropriate acceptance
criteria when using this product for its intended use.

Stability
Open-Vial Stability Studies
The on-test and reference materials were tested in duplicate. The on-test
material was reconstituted and stored for 5 hours at 25ºC (in an open vial).
The reference material was a freshly reconstituted set of CalChecks. The
on-test recovery was calculated as a percentage of the reference value. The
reconstituted vials are stable for four hours at 20-25°C
Accelerated Stability:
The on-test material was stored lyophilized (as supplied to the user) at 35°C
for 3 weeks. The reference material was a freshly reconstituted set of
CalChecks stored at 2-8°C. After 3 weeks, the test and reference materials
were tested in duplicate. The on-test recovery was calculated as a percentage
of the reference value. Accelerated stability testing supports the target shelf
life claim of 18 months
Real-Time Stability:
In the on-going real-time stability study, the Elecsys IgE CalCheck 5 test
material is stored at 2-8°C. The CalChecks are tested at T=0 and at specified
intervals over the shelf life of the device up to the planned shelf life plus one
month.The manufacturer claims CalCheck 5 is stable until the expiration date
printed on the vial when stored unopened at 2 – 8° C.
Dilution Study:
To demonstrate that the values are within the assay’s measuring range of
0.100 – 2500 IU/mL after mixing, the following dilution study was performed
on Elecsys IgE CalCheck 5 Levels 1 and 5: Check 1 & Check 2 and Check 4
& Check 5 were mixed in a 1:1 ratio and measured in two-fold determination.
The average was then calculated.
