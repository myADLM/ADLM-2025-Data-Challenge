L. Test Principle:
The Zeus Scientific Inc. Treponema pallidum IgG ELISA Test System is designed to
detect IgG antibodies to T. pallidum in human sera. Wells of plastic microwell strips
are sensitized by passive absorption with T. pallidum antigen. The test procedure
involves 3 incubation steps. Test sera are diluted with SAVe diluent . During sample
incubation, any antigen specific IgG antibody in the sample will bind to the
immobilized antigen. The plate is washed to remove unbound antibody and other
serum components. Then peroxidase conjugated goat anti-human IgG is added to the
wells and the plate is incubated. The conjugate will react with IgG antibody
immobilized on the solid phase in step 1. The wells are washed to remove unbound
conjugate. The microwells containing immobilized peroxidase conjugate are
incubated with peroxidase substrate solution. Hydrolysis of the substrate by
peroxidase produces a color change. After the incubation has ended, the reaction is
stopped and the color intensity of the solution is measured photometrically. Color
intensity of the solution depends on antibody concentration in the original test
sample.
M. Performance Characteristics :
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated internally at the manufacturer’s site. The study was
conducted as follows: Fifteen samples, three for each category (negative, high
negative, near cut-off, low positive and high positive) were identified and/or
prepared (by Zeus Scientific, Inc.) for use in the study. To assess precision, on
each day of testing, each sample was diluted twice and tested. This was
repeated in a second run on the same day by a different technologist for a total
of twelve days. Precision is considered acceptable for the reactive samples if

Reproducibility was evaluated internally and at two external clinical sites.
Fifteen samples, three for each category (negative, high negative, near cut-off,
low positive and high positive) were identified and/or prepared for use in the
study based upon their activity on the Treponema pallidum IgG ELISA assay.
To assess reproducibility, on each day of testing, each sample was diluted
twice and each dilution was run in triplicate. This process was repeated in a
second run by a second technologist resulting in twelve results per day. This
was repeated for five days at each site and the resulting data used to assess
reproducibility. Reproducibility is considered acceptable for the reactive
samples if the total CV is <15% and if the total CV for the border line and
positive samples do not congregate at the high end of acceptability but show a
spread of results at least 3%. The reproducibility for the negative sample is
considered acceptable if the total CV is <50% and shows no change in the
qualitative outcome. The study is summarized in the following table .

The samples were exposed to the possible interfering substances and tested. An
increase or reduction of signal equal to or less than 20% is considered acceptable.
The negative sample may have a signal change greater than 20% if there is no
change in the qualitative result of the sample.
All positive samples showed less than a 20% recovery of signal.
The borderline samples showed a recovery of signal <20% of with the exception
of the high spike of hemoglobin (25.2%).
The negative sample showed a change of signal (>20%) with the high and low
spikes of albumin, hemoglobin, intralipid, bilirubin, cholesterol and triglycerides.
The negative sample results in each instance stayed below the cut-off and the
change in signal did not affect the qualitative result.
Cross-Reactivity Study
Studies were performed to assess cross reactivity with T. pallidum IgG ELISA
test system. Ten samples were tested for each cross-reactant. The results
presented were obtained by testing the analytes against high concentrations of
possible cross reactants. The results of this study are summarized in the following
table. No cross reactivity was observed.

Five hundred unselected samples from patients with a syphilis test ordered as
well as five hundred samples from pregnant women with a syphilis test
ordered were submitted for syphilis antibody testing. They were sequentially
numbered, de-identified and archived. These samples were tested at Zeus, a
hospital lab in the Mid-Atlantic and another in the Northeast. Results are
listed in the following tables:

The CDC syphilis panel consisting of a total of 157 clinically characterized
samples was also tested. Samples were from patients with varying stages of
syphilis. The results from the T. pallidum IgG test system were compared to
the CDC panel.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Random unselected sera submitted for syphilis antibody testing were tested with
the device, to determine expected values in the populations tested. In the 500
prospectively collected samples from patients ranging in age from <1 to >70 years
of age, 7 tested positive. The overall observed prevalence in this group was 1.4%
(7/500 samples).
In the 500 samples collected from pregnant women ranging in age from 15 to 48,
3/498 samples tested positive. The observed prevalence in this group was 0.6%.
Two samples were excluded due to questionable age.
In the group of 1000 samples from unselected hospitalized patients ranging in age
from <1 to >70 years of age, 32 tested positive. The overall observed prevalence
in this group was 3.2% (32/999 samples). One sample was QNS for testing.
