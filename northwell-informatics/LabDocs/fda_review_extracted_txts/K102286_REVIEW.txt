L. Test Principle:
The CrAg Lateral Flow Assay is a dipstick sandwich immunochromatographic
assay, which detects cryptococcal antigen in serum. For the qualitative procedure,
specimens are diluted 1:2 in 1x Specimen Diluent and analyzed. For the semi-
quantitative procedure, specimens are diluted 1:5 in 1x Specimen Diluent
followed by 1:2 serial dilutions. All dilutions are then analyzed as in the
qualitative procedure. Specimens are placed into an appropriate reservoir, such as
a test tube or microtiter plate, and the lateral flow device is then placed into the
reservoir allowing the specimen to come into contact with the test membrane.
The test uses specimen wicking to capture gold-conjugated, anti-cryptococcal
monoclonal antibodies and gold-conjugated control antibodies that are deposited
onto a membrane. If cryptococcal antigen is present in the specimen, it binds to
the gold–conjugated, anti-cryptococcal antibodies. The gold-labeled antibody-
antigen complex will continue to wick up the membrane where it will interact
with the Test Line (T). The Test Line is immobilized anti-cryptococcal
monoclonal antibodies. If the specimen contains cryptococcal antigen, a
sandwich is created with the gold-labeled antibodies and the immobilized
antibodies, causing a visible line to develop at the test line site (T). If proper flow
occurs and the reagents are reactive at the time of use, the wicking of any
specimen, positive or negative, will cause the gold-conjugated control goat IgG
antibody to move to the Control Line (C) which is immobilized bovine anti-goat
IgG antibody. The immobilized anti-goat antibody will bind to the gold-
conjugated goat IgG Control antibody and will cause a visible line to develop (C).
A positive test result will create two lines, while a negative test result will create
one line (Figure 1). If the control line fails to develop a line, then the test is not
valid.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Serum:
Repeatability and reproducibility with serum specimens were determined by spiking
a serum specimen pool that was negative by the IMMY Latex-Cryptococcus
Antigen Detection System with cryptococcal antigen at four concentrations:
Negative, high negative (C ), low positive (near C ), and medium positive. The
5 95
samples were analyzed on the CrAg Lateral Flow Assay in triplicate on five
different days, at three different sites with a total of five different operators, on one
lot, according to EP5-A2. One site was internal (Site 1) and two were a South
African reference laboratory (Site 2) and a US hospital laboratory (Site 3). For
repeatability, percent positive and percent negative detected were calculated for
each site (Table 2). For reproducibility, overall percent positive and percent
4

--- Page 5 ---
negative detected were calculated by combining the data from all three sites
(last two rows of Table 2).
SERUM Site 1 Site 2 Site 3 Overall

Moderate Positive
(30/30) (30/30) (15/15) (75/75)
As expected, the high negative tested positive nearly 5% of the time and 3% of the
time in serum. All other samples performed 100% as expected across all sites, all
runs, and all operators.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The CrAg Lateral Flow Assay has a three-month expiration date when stored at
room temperature. Real-time stability testing is on-going. Initial accelerated
stability was determined by testing three lots of kits stored at 25°C and 37°C for
three months. Buffer was spiked with cryptococcal antigen at four concentrations:
1.5, 3.0, 6.0 and 9.0ng/ml. Non-spiked buffer was used as a negative control. Each
sample was tested in triplicate by one operator. Each spiked sample replicate tested
positive and each negative control tested negative on all lots of the CrAg Lateral
Flow Assay, stored at both 25°C and 37°C. This initial data indicate that the CrAg
Lateral Flow Assay is stable at room temperature for three months. Stability studies
are on-going to demonstrate a one-year expiration dating.
d. Detection limit:
Detection Limit/Analytical Cut-off
Analytical sensitivity for the CrAg Lateral Flow Assay was estimated by running
varying concentrations of cryptococcal antigen diluted in LF Specimen Diluent.
Test results determined that the analytical cut-off is 1.25ng/ml (Table 3).

* Rheumatoid factor concentrations tested ranged from 112IU/ml to 6479IU/mls.
** The three positives were the result of three replicates of the same specimen, which
was positive.
In addition to the cross-reactivity study, interference testing was also performed on
five icteric, five hemolyzed, and five lipemic serum specimens. Each specimen was
spiked with cryptococcal antigen at three times the C95 concentration. All specimens
were then tested at IMMY, on one lot of CrAg Lateral Flow assay in triplicate: spiked
and unspiked. Percent positivity was determined for each condition. All of the
unspiked specimens had negative results on the CrAg Lateral Flow Assay. All spiked
specimens were positive, thus, these types of serum specimens do not interfere with
the CrAg Lateral Flow Assay. However, it is possible that hemolyzed samples could
lead to false negatives due to the high background color on the strip. As such, a
statement is included in the Limitations of the Procedure section of the package
insert:
“Hemolyzed serum samples could lead to false negative results due to the high
background color on the strip.”
Due to specimen availability, the following conditions were not tested in the CrAg
Lateral Flow Assay: Candida dubliniensis, Candida tropicalis, Candida
parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, Cladosporium trichoides, Neisseria
meningitidis, Salmonella typhi, Pneumocystis carinii, Trichosporon beigelii,

f. Assay cut-off:
High dose hook effect concentrations with serum specimens were determined by
spiking negative serum that were negative by the IMMY Latex-Cryptococcus Antigen
Detection System and CrAg Lateral Flow Assay, with cryptococcal antigen at various
concentrations between 20 and 500ug/ml. Each concentration was tested in triplicate
at IMMY on one lot of CrAg Lateral Flow Assay, according to the package insert. It
was determined that serum specimens with a cryptococcal antigen concentration
higher than 200ug/ml can produce a high dose hook effect and therefore may produce
a false negative result.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The CrAg Lateral Flow Assay was compared to the gold standard diagnoses
of cryptococcosis (culture and/or India Ink) to evaluate the sensitivity and
specificity of the assay. These studies contained a mix of both prospective

A panel of 197 serum specimens that were submitted to a US reference

EIA, were collected and stored frozen until method comparison studies were
performed. Of the 197 specimens, 96 were positive and 101 were negative by
the EIA. All specimens were analyzed, according to EP12-A2, concurrently
in the CrAg Lateral Flow Assay and in the IMMY Latex-Cryptococcus
