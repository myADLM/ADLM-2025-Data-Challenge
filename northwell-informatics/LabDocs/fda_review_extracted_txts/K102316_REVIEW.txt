L. Test Principle:
Glucose Shepherd Blood Glucose Monitoring System and Glucose Shepherd Pro
Blood Glucose Monitoring System use an electrochemical method. It is based on the
quantitative measurement of glucose in whole blood using an amperometric method,
which detects the current produced from glucose oxidation. Glucose in the sample
mixes with specific chemicals on the test strip producing a small amount of electrical
current. The meter measures the current, as well as other important parameters, such
as ambient temperature, and displays the corresponding blood glucose level in the
sample. The strength of the current produced by the reaction depends on the amount
of glucose in the blood sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Since the two Glucose Shepherd blood glucose monitoring systems are
identical, only one set of precision studies were provided for both the systems.
The repeatability study was performed by one operator using heparinized anti-
coagulated whole blood (hematocrit ranged from 35% to 50%) at five
different glucose concentrations. The final glucose concentrations for the
blood samples were confirmed by YSI 2300. Each sample was tested on ten
meters using three lots of test strips (three meters with each of the two test
strips lots and four meters with one test strip lot). Ten measurements were
obtained per meter and test strip lot, and glucose concentration (N=100 per
concentration level). The results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity study was designed based on CLSI EP6-A guideline.
Since the two Glucose Shepherd blood glucose monitoring systems are
identical, only one linearity study was provided for both the systems.
Nine heparinized venous blood samples spiked with dextrose that covered the
range from 20-600 mg/dL (hematocrit 45%). Glucose concentrations were
confirmed by the YSI-2300. One operator performed the study using one
calibrated meter and one vial of test strips from one lot in quadruplicate
(N=36 per test strip lot). The results are summarized below:
Compared to YSI Slope Intercept R2
Replicate 1 0.9673 6.0271 0.9992
Replicate 2 0.9616 8.4738 0.9984
Replicate 3 0.9409 12.436 0.9957
Replicate 4 0.9551 12.572 0.9972
The measurement range of the Glucose Shepherd Blood Glucose Monitoring
Systems is 20 to 600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Since the two Glucose Shepherd blood glucose monitoring systems are
identical, only one set of traceability, value assignment and stability studies
were provided for both the systems.
Glucose Shepherd Control Solutions:
Traceability and value assignment - The Glucose Shepherd control solutions
are traceable to the N.I.S.T SRM 917c and the YSI-2300 analyzer. Value
assignment was performed with 10 Glucose Shepherd blood glucose meters
using 10 strips from six randomly selected vials of Glucose Shepherd blood
glucose test strips from the same lot and three levels of control solutions. The
mean, standard deviation and CV are calculated for each new lot of control
material. If the three CVs are <5%, then the control range for each strip lot is
calculated as mean ± 20% (for mean value ≥75 mg/dL) and mean ± 15 mg/dL
(for mean value <75 mg/dL). If the CV is ≥ 5%, the product is judged
defective and discarded.
Stability - The Glucose Shepherd control solutions are identical to FORA
control solutions first commercialized under k041107, and more recently
under k093724. The Glucose Shepherd control solutions are manufactured
and labeled by the manufacturer. The stability study results provided were
from the k041107.
Open vial control stability was tested at three control levels on two lots.
Based on these studies, open vial stability is 90 days when stored tightly
closed between 35°F and 86°F (2°C and 30°C). Unopened vial control
stability was tested in real time at three control levels on three lots. Unopened

Replicate 4	0.9551	12.572	0.9972

--- Page 9 ---
control solutions were tested under identical conditions as the opened control
solutions. The unopened control solutions have a 24 month shelf life when
stored between 35°F and 86°F (2°C and 30°C). Stability studies protocol and
acceptance criteria for open and unopened vials were provided and found to be
adequate.
Glucose Shepherd Test Strips:
Stability - Real time stability was performed for Glucose Shepherd test strips to
assess the shelf-life and open-vial stability of the test strips. Stability studies
protocol and acceptance criteria were provided and found to be adequate. The
sponsor claimed that the unopened test strips have a 24 month shelf-life and are
stable for 3 months after opening when stored at temperatures between 39.2°F to
104°F (4°C to 40°C) at ≤ 85% R.H.
This information is provided in the labeling of the test strips and control
materials.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range is 20 to 600 mg/dL based on the linearity/assay
reportable range study above (section M.1.b).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference study was designed according to CLSI EP7-A2 guideline.
Since the two Glucose Shepherd Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems are
identical, only one set of interference studies were provided for both systems.
Eighteen potential endogenous and exogenous interfering substances were
evaluated by spiking heparinized venous blood with two levels of glucose
concentrations within the ranges 80 - 120 mg/dL and 200 -300 mg/dL. The
glucose samples were spiked with the potentially interfering compounds and
tested on two meters using one test strip lot. Several concentrations of the
interfering substances were tested as shown in the table below. Non
interfering substances were tested at toxic level concentrations or 10 times the
highest therapeutic concentrations as recommended in CLSI EP7-A2
guidance. The sugars with unknown blood concentration were tested at
several concentrations up to 100 mg/dL (galactose and xylose) or 1000 mg/dL
(maltose). If the blood concentration of the substance is not known, the
concentration tested was three times the therapeutic dose distributed in 5L of
blood. Bias was calculated as the mean percent difference in glucose reading
between the test and control concentration groups. Significant interference is
defined by the sponsor as a bias ≥ 10 % of the test samples from the control
group.
The sponsor claims no significant interference (< 10% difference) for the
substances and concentrations shown in the table below:

The Method Comparison study was performed by lay user and healthcare
professional at three sites over 10 days using fresh finger stick capillary blood
samples. Ninety nine patients participated in the study. Venous blood
samples were collected in heparin tubes. Labeling was provided only in
English and users followed it to perform testing. The samples were tested
using three lots of Glucose Shepherd test strips. Distribution of glucose
concentrations across the measuring range was: 5 samples between 20 to 50
mg/dL, 15 samples between 50 to 80 mg/dL, 20 samples between 80 to 120
mg/dL, 30 samples between 120 to 200 mg/dL, 15 samples between 201 to

18

--- Page 19 ---
5. Calibration:
The Glucose Shepherd Blood Glucose meter is a no code device. Reaction
intensities of new test strip lots must meet the manufacturer’s no code criteria for
use with these meters. Validation of new strip lots is confirmed by comparison to
the YSI across the measuring range of the device.
6. Quality Control:
Glucose control solutions at three concentration levels can be run with this device.
The meter has an algorithm to automatically recognize the control solutions to
prevent control results from being stored in the internal memory as patient result.
Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the
labeling. The control solution readings are not included in the average of the
patient results. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test
strip vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls
outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. A usability study was performed to assess the readability of the labeling by
recruiting 99 lay users (aged 22-72 yrs old) who were provided with the test kit
containing labeling in English for the US market. Participants varied in age,
education, country of origin, and were about evenly divided between men and
women. These lay users also completed a questionnaire to indicate whether the
device is easy to use and the Instructions for use were written in a way that makes
it easy to use. The majority of the users responded that the device is very easy to
use.
2. Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the results showed that
the labeling (User Guide, test strip package insert and control solution package
insert) were written at grade levels ranging from 7.0th to 8.0th grade.
3. Customer service is available Monday to Friday between 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM
CST. Toll free phone number is 1-877-394-1655 for customer support.
4. Insufficient sample studies were performed at volumes starting from 0.3 µL to 2.0
µL in increments of 0.1 µL around the recommended volume (1.1 µL) using six
vials of test strips from one lot. Each sample was tested six times per strip lot.
Three glucose concentration levels of venous whole blood were tested (49 mg/dL,
159 mg/dL and 248 mg/dL) as determined by the YSI. Appropriate sample
volume was determined if the meter results compared to YSI results were within
10% bias for blood samples. A blood volume ≥ 1.1 µL met the criteria.
5. Temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated for temperatures
ranging from 50oF to 104oF (10oC to 40oC) and relative humidity below 85% R.H.
The sponsor tested combinations of lowest and highest temperatures with lowest
19

--- Page 20 ---
and highest humidity levels. The study protocol and acceptance criteria were
provided and found to be acceptable. The results supported the Sponsor’s
claimed operating temperature from 50oF to 104oF (10oC to 40oC) and relative
humidity below 85%.
6. The effect of altitude on the accuracy of the device was evaluated on the Glucose
Shepherd Blood Glucose Monitoring System with two meters and four vials of
test strips from one lot. Venous blood samples at five concentrations of glucose
(50-100mg/dL, 101-150mg/dL, 151-200mg/dL, 250-300mg/dL and 400-
450mg/dL) were tested at three altitude levels (3,328, 8,478 and 10,745 feet) and
at sea level (22.97 feet). Each sample was also tested by YSI-2300. No
significant interference from altitude was defined by the sponsor as bias within
±10%. The data demonstrates that elevation of 10,745 feet does not affect the
accuracy of the device. Based on the data, the sponsor claims that the Glucose
Shepherd Blood Glucose Monitoring System can be used at altitude up to 10,745
feet.
7. The Glucose Shepherd Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for
multiple patient use by healthcare professionals and the Glucose Shepherd Blood
Glucose Monitoring System is intended for home use by single person.
Disinfection studies were performed on the Glucose Shepherd meter and lancing
device to determine the robustness of the meter and lancing device to the
recommended cleaning and disinfection protocol, and its effectiveness in
preventing the spread of bloodborne pathogens, particularly hepatitis B virus
(HBV). CaviWipesXL (CW) disposable wipes (EPA Reg. No.46781-8) was
validated, demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus for use with the
Glucose Shepherd meter and lancing device. The sponsor demonstrated that there
was no change in performance or in the external materials of the Glucose
Shepherd meter after 15,000 cleaning and disinfection cycles to simulate an
estimated 8 to 9 cleaning and disinfection cycles per day over 5 years of
healthcare professional use. The sponsor demonstrated that there was no change
in performance or in the external materials of the lancing after 3,000 cleaning and
disinfection cycles. The labeling states that the meter must be replaced with a
new meter at the end of 15,000 cleaning and disinfection cycles or 5 years,
whichever comes first. The lancing device must be replaced with a new lancing
device at the end of 5,000 cleaning and disinfection cycles or 1 year, whichever
comes first. Labeling has been reviewed for adequate instructions on the
validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
8. EMC testing was evaluated and certified by TUV Rheinland LGA Products
GmbH and a certificate of conformity was issued to BroadMaster Biotech
Corporation on 03-08-2010.
9. The effect of different hematocrit levels on the accuracy of the device was
evaluated on the Glucose Shepherd Blood Glucose Monitoring System using two
meters (tested in duplicate) and twelve vials of test strips from one lot. Blood
20

--- Page 21 ---
samples at nine hematocrit levels from 20% to 60% (20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55
and 60%) were evaluated in eight concentrations of glucose of approximately 20,
50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600 mg/dL. Glucose concentrations were
compared to YSI and to 40% hematocrit. No significant interference from
hematocrit was defined as bias within ± 15%. Results demonstrated that
hematocrit levels between 20%-60% do not significantly interfere with glucose
measurements.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
