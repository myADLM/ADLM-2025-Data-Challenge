510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
k102338
B. Purpose for Submission:
New device
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Akers Biosciences Inc, BreathScan®PRO
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Quantitative
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The BreathScan Pro consists of a self-contained electronic analyzer, the one time
use detectors and an re-useable blow bag. The analyzer is powered by a lithium
battery and turns on when the detector is inserted into it. After 2 minutes the
analyzer will display the breath alcohol concentration (BAC) to three decimal
places. The results are displayed for 10 seconds.
2. Principles of Operation:
The BreathScan Pro Detector consists of a plastic tube which contains an inner
glass tube and microparticles (crystals). Through a catalyzed process, these
reactive particles form a complex with the biomarker in the breath condensate
which causes a color change. The electronic analyzer contains a digital color
sensor that is sensitive to red, green and blue regions of the spectrum. Detected
signals are serially output of digital data that is converted into the quantitative
BAC.
3. Modes of Operation:
This device has only one mode of operation. See section 2 above.

4. Specimen Identification:
There is no mechanism to identify the specimen.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The user provides a breath sample by exhaling into the detector before insertion
into the detector.
6. Calibration:
The device is calibrated at the factory and the calibration is stable for 2000 test
results. When 100 tests are left the device will give a low battery alarm. After the
2000 test is run the device will power down. The device is disposed of after 2000
tests.

J. Test Principle:
The BreathScan Pro Detector consists of a plastic tube which contains an inner glass
tube and microparticles (crystals). Through a catalyzed process, these reactive
particles form a complex with the breath condensate which causes a color change.
The electronic analyzer contains a digital color sensor that is sensitive to red, green
and blue regions of the spectrum. Detected signals are then converted into the
quantitative BAC.
K. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy:
The sponsor performed a consumer study using the BreathScan Pro to
determine if consumers could correctly use and interpret the device using only
the package insert and to compare the results to the predicate device. There
were 62 paired comparisons and the volunteers ranged in age from 21 to over
61 years of age. Each participant took their breath alcohol reading with the
BreathScan Pro and immediately were administered a breath alcohol test using
the predicate device operated by a trained individual. The non-drinker had the
detector read by the analyzer and recorded the results. The breath alcohol
concentrations ranged from BAC of 0.000% to 0.150%.

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed a “DOT-Like” precision and accuracy study. The
testing followed the NHTSA requirements (referred to as Model
Specifications) which consist of 20 trials at a Blood Alcohol Concentration
(BAC) of 0.008, 20 trials at a BAC of 0.032, and 20 trials at a BAC of 0.000.
The sponsor also conducted testing at +/- 60% for each of the following cutoff
concentration, .02%, .05%, .08%, .12%. Blood Alcohol Concentrations are
simulated in breath by a Breath Alcohol Sample Simulator (BASS), which
provides an alcohol-in-air test sample with known alcohol concentrations,
flow rate, and air composition.

The acceptance criteria for the Model Specifications are: not more than one
negative result at +60% BAC cutoff, not more than one positive result at -60%
BAC cutoff, and not more than one negative greater than zero and no positives
at 0.000 BAC.
The results are presented in the table below:
Cut-off BreathScan®PRO Results (DOT/NHTSA study)
Human Breath (Blank) 60% below cutoff (.008%) 60% above cutoff (.032%)
.02% 20/20 Negative 20/20 Negative 20/20 Positive

Human Breath (Blank) 60% below cutoff 60% above cutoff

.05% 20/20 Negative 20/20 Negative 20/20 Positive
.08% 20/20 Negative 20/20 Negative 20/20 Positive
.12% 20/20 Negative 20/20 Negative 20/20 Positive
c. Linearity:
This BreathScan®PRO will report concentrations from 0.00 to 0.15% BAC.
However, DOT Model Specifications require accuracy and precision testing
up to a concentration of 0.032 only; therefore true linearity over the entire
measuring range of the device was not evaluated. This device met all
applicable NHTSA requirements for precision and accuracy as described
above.
d. Carryover:
Carryover studies are not required by NHTSA and were not performed using
these devices.
e. Interfering Substances:
The DOT Model Specifications require testing with cigarette smoke to assess
any possible interference. Five trials are required at 0.000 BAC. An alcohol
free individual who smokes cigarettes is appropriate for this trial. The subject
is asked to smoke approximately one half of a cigarette. Within one minute
after smoking, or after a waiting period specified in the manufacturer’s
instructions, the subject performs the breath alcohol test according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The subject is then asked to smoke another
inhalation and repeat the test to produce a total of five trials. The acceptance
criterion for this trial is: no false positive results.

The BreathScan®PRO had no false positive results.
Other potential interferents were not evaluated with this device.
2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
a. Limit of Detection
The DOT Model Specifications do not specifically address the detection limit of
breath alcohol devices. However, the devices must be tested at a BAC of zero
(blank reading) to assess the possibility of false positives. This consists of 20
trials under normal laboratory conditions at a BAC of 0.000. Non-alcoholic
human breath is to be used as the sample. For devices capable of providing a
reading of greater than 0.000 BAC and less than 0.020 BAC, the acceptance
criterion is: not more than one such result. These devices had no false positives in
this trial.
b. Temperature
The DOT Model Specifications require testing at 10 and 40º C to assess any
possible effects of temperature. At 10ºC 20 trials are required at 0.008 BAC
and 20 trials are required at 0.032 BAC. Acceptance criteria are: not more than
one positive result at 0.008 BAC and not more than one non-positive result at
0.032 BAC. The sponsor also conducted testing at the following temperatures,
-15º C and 50º C. Twenty trials were conducted +/- 60% for each of the
following cutoff concentration, .02%, .05%, .08%, 0.12%. Acceptance criteria
are: not more than one positive result at -60% of each cutoff and not more than
one non-positive result at +60% of each cutoff. The device had no positive
results at -60% of each cutoff and no negative results at +60% of each cutoff.
c. Vibration
The DOT Model Specifications require vibration testing to assess any possible
vibrational effects. 20 trials are required at 0.008 BAC and 0.032 BAC.
Acceptance criteria are: not more than one positive result at 0.008 BAC and
not more than one non-positive result at 0.032 BAC. The sponsor also
conducted testing at +/- 60% for each of the following cutoff concentration,
.02%, .05%, .08%, 0.12%. Acceptance criteria are: not more than one positive
result at -60% of each cutoff and not more than one non-positive result at
+60% of each cutoff. The devices had no positive results at -60% of each
cutoff and no negative results at +60% of each cutoff.
