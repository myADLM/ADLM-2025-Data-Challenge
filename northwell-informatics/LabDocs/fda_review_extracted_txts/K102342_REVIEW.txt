I. Device Description:
The KeyPathTM MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test – BT test uses lytic
bacteriophage, specific for Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus, SA), as an
amplification technology for detection of S. aureus and determination of
methicillin resistance or susceptibility in positive blood cultures. To detect S.
aureus (ID Reaction Tube), the bacteriophage infect the S. aureus (if present),
replicate within the host (culminating in bacterial lysis) and over the
incubation period, produce several cycles of bacteriophage amplification. In a
separate Reaction Tube (RS), the Test uses cefoxitin (an oxacillin and
methicillin analog) which inhibits bacteriophage amplification for susceptible
organisms (MSSA) and fails to inhibit bacteriophage amplification when the
organism is resistant to methicillin (MRSA). The Test then uses a self-
performing immunoassay (Detector) to detect the increase in concentration of
bacteriophage using antibodies specific to the Test bacteriophage, and
calibrated such that at above a threshold concentration, it produces a visible
signal.

Summary of Gold Standard and Predicate Use:
After Gram stain, samples were tested with: a) the KeyPathTM MRSA/MSSA
Blood Culture Test – BT per MP2009-B and b) a cohort of Gold Standard and
predicate tests for identification including: coagulase tube test, catalase slide
test, and Staphaurex® Test. The identification Gold Standard is defined as
concordant results between the catalase, coagulase and Staphaurex® tests.
For SA positive samples, PBP2’ test, Cefoxitin Sensi-disc (30 ug) test and
Oxacillin Sensi-disc (1 ug) test were performed to determine antibiotic
susceptibility. The Cefoxitin Sensi-disc test was defined as the Gold Standard
for MRSA/MSSA determination on S. aureus-positive samples.
Except for MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test – BT, all other Gold
Standard/predicates used purified colonies from overnight culture of positive
blood culture samples on 5% sheep blood-tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates.
Sensi-disc testing (i.e. Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion) included secondary plating
on Mueller-Hinton plates.

L. Test Principle:
The KeyPathTM MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test – BT uses lytic
bacteriophage, specific for Staphylococcus aureus, as an amplification
technology for detection of S. aureus and determination of methicillin
resistance or susceptibility in positive blood cultures. To detect S. aureus (ID
Reaction Tube), the bacteriophage infect the S. aureus (if present), replicate
within the host (culminating in bacterial lysis) and over the incubation period,
produce several cycles of bacteriophage amplification. In a separate Reaction
Tube (RS), the Test uses cefoxitin (methicillin analog) which inhibits
bacteriophage amplification for susceptible organisms (MSSA) and fails to
inhibit bacteriophage amplification when the organism is resistant to
methicillin (MRSA). The Test then uses a self-performing immunoassay
(Detector) to detect the increase in concentration of bacteriophage using
antibodies specific to the Test bacteriophage, and calibrated such that at a
known concentration, it will produce a visible signal. The test formulation
consists of 4 components: Identification (ID) liquid reagents (Reaction
Media), ID dried reagents (Reaction Tubes), Resistance/Susceptibility (RS)
liquid reagents (Reaction Media) and RS dried reagents (Reaction Tubes). The
dried reagents are formulated specifically for use in the BactecTM (Becton-
Dickinson) blood culture systems with PLUS Aerobic and PLUS Anaerobic
bottles. The Test is also composed of a dual lane self-performing lateral flow
immunoassay (LFI Detector). The Test includes two 150 μL transfer pipettes
that facilitate transfer of the incubated sample from each of the Reaction
Tubes to each of the corresponding Detector wells. The pipettes are color
coded (blue and red) to ensure proper transfer.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
In the analytical in-house performance testing, all protocols used a single
technician to set up the Test but this technician does not interpret the
results. Multiple, independent, blinded, readers interpret the results.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Of 240 test points, 96.3% (231/240) of samples the KeyPathTM
MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test – BT (Test) were correctly called as
S. aureus. For Resistance and Susceptibility (RS) determinations, none
(0/120) of the MSSA samples were incorrectly determined to be
MRSA. There was a 100% agreement. (111/111) for MRSA samples
which had been correctly classified as S. aureus by the Identification
Page 11 of 31

--- Page 12 ---
component of the MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test – BT. The
breakout of performance by site and strain for the initial
reproducibility showed inconsistencies so additional reproducibility
studies were conducted. Inconsistencies were due to sample
preparation for testing.
In the additional study, reproducibility of the KeyPathTM
MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test – BT was assessed over 6 days at 3
study sites (2 external, 1 internal), using 6 operators (2 at each site),
with the following strains – 2 MRSA (JMI-520, JMI-912), 2 MSSA,
(JMI-2226, JMI-7812) 1 NSA (ATCC-12228, S. epidermidis).
Additionally, 3 GMP kit lots and 2 replicates per sample per session
were tested. The analyte levels included 2 for MRSA and MSSA, 1 for
NSA. The MRSA and MSSA samples were tested neat, and at 10-fold
dilution, a level shown to be at or near the limit of detection. Accuracy
was 644/648 = 99.4%. All 4 errors were false-resistance calls of
MSSA runs. The 4 errors were distributed between the three sites and
the 3 GMP lots. Accuracy among MRSAs was 288/288, 100%.
Accuracy among MSSAs was 284/288 = 98.6%. Accuracy among
NSAs was 100%.

Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
Controls
Quality control was performed each day of testing on both the
reference method and the test method at three testing sites.
Reproducibility of the controls exceeded 94.5% at all sites during the
course of the clinical
trials. MicroPhage supplied frozen bacterial stocks of three control
bacteria (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus - MRSA,
Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus - MSSA, and non-
Staphylococcus aureus - NSA) which required an additional 2 hours of
incubation before testing for clinical design validation trial.
External Quality Control Procedure Verification:
A new protocol was external quality control was developed, using
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) stocks of MRSA, MSSA,
and NSA as listed in the table below. Bacterial stocks of the three
control strains were streaked to isolate single colonies which were
grown overnight on trypticase soy agar with 5% sheep blood (TSA II).
A 0.5 McFarland dilution was prepared with each isolate and 30 uL
samples were directly inoculated into each Reaction Tube of the

The External QC Control Protocol was executed by 3 operators over 3
days. No differences were seen between days and operators. The total
number of valid runs and results for each control strain are shown
below.
QC validation results
Strain N valid results N correct results % (95% CI) correct results
MRSA 110 110 100% (96.7% - 100%)
MSSA 110 110 100% (96.7% - 100%)
NSA 110 110 100% (96.7% - 100%)
The proposed External QC Control procedure demonstrated acceptable
reliability between operators and days of testing. This change was
accepted and used for the package insert procedure.
Stability
Three KeyPathTM MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test – BT kit lots were
assembled/configured using a combination of unique lots of each of
five kit components. Shelf-life stability of the MRSA/MSSA Test was
assessed, per applicable CLSI Standards (CLSI EP25-A: Evaluation of
Stability of In Vitro Diagnostic Reagents (2009)), by real-time storage
at labeled storage conditions (2-8°C). The claimed shelf life is 24
weeks.
Detector devices, contained in their sealed storage pouches with
desiccant pack, were placed at -20, 42 or 60°C for 4 hours. After
exposure, pouches were opened and Detectors were used under
ambient laboratory conditions. A total of three lots of Detector were
evaluated during this study.
A study was also conducted to determine the interaction of
temperature and humidity while the detector was in use. A two-
factorial designed experiment, covering the interactions of effects of
temperature ranges of 4-35°C (40-95°F) and relative humidity (RH)
ranges of 2-90%, was employed. Detectors were placed in sealed

chambers in the presence of saturated salt solutions (used to maintain a
specific relative humidity), then chambers were placed in incubators
(used to maintain a specific temperature) and left to equilibrate for 60
minutes. Temperature and RH achieved under these conditions was
confirmed with a calibrated temperature/RH probe. A total of three
lots of Detector were evaluated during this study.
Under normal ambient temperature conditions (18-25°C or 65-78°F),
relative humidity does not affect the ability of the Detector to
accurately call negative and positive bacteriophage-containing
samples. In addition, short-term exposure of the Detector to extremes
in temperature (i.e. -20 to 42°C or -4 to 105°F) which may arise during
shipment of the product does not adversely affect the accuracy of call
rates for negative and positive bacteriophage-containing samples.
However, the trend in call rates was observed at the extremes of the
temperature range:
• For high negative samples, a significant increase in positive call
rate was seen as humidity increased when the Detector was
incubated at 35°C (95°F).
• For high negative and low positive samples, a significant decrease
in positive call rates were seen when the incubation temperature
was lowered to 4°C (40°F).
Specimen stability:
MicroPhage tested whether the age of the blood would affect
bacteriophage amplification. It was determined that the KeyPathTM
MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test must be performed ≤ 24 hours after
the Bactec instrument alarms for positive blood culture bottles
confirmed to have GPCC or GPC by Gram stain.
MicroPhage tested the robustness of the operating parameters and
Twenty-seven combinations of parameters were tested, in addition to
controls. The 27 runs were performed on each of five strains of S.
aureus and S. epidermidis. The operating range was set by the highest
minimum and lowest maximum for each of the five strain types and
summarized in the following table.

Research and development studies determined that the bacteriophage
lose titer if they undergo more than one freeze-thaw cycle.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity of the KeyPathTM MRSA/MSSA Blood
Culture Test – BT, for correct call rate for S. aureus ID, correct call
rate for MSSA, and correct call rate for MRSA, was determined to be
6.0x105 CFU/mL from Bactec blood culture bottle samples.
The Test Detectors return a negative result with >95% probability at
bacteriophage concentrations 1.8 x 107 PFU/mL, and returned a
positive result with >95% probability at bacteriophage concentrations
1.4 x 108 PFU/mL. The cutoff level (50% call probability) is 4.9 x 107
PFU/mL.
The prozone study used a high challenge concentration of
bacteriophage (1x1011 PFU/mL), approximately 1.5 logs greater than
the median phage output post-amplification of clinical samples, which
failed to produce false negative results on the Detector indicating the
Detector is visually insensitive to hook effect between 1x109 and
1x1011 PFU/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Co-Infection (or Cross-Contamination) Study
The following permutations of Target and Contaminant strains were
tested in the Co-Infection Study: MRSA x MS-CoNS, MRSA x
MSSA, hMRSA (Heteroresistant MRSA) x MSSA, and MSSA x MR-
CoNS. Individual strains were spiked into charged Bactec™ blood
culture bottles, per the Spiking Model, and grown to alarm on a
Bactec™ 9050 blood culture incubator. Target strains were mixed with
contaminant strains at volumes of 10:1, 1:1, and 1:10, and then the
MRSA/MSSA Test was run. Visual calls of MRSA, MSSA or NSA
(not S. aureus) were made by a panel of three readers who were
blinded to strain identity. Tests were run in triplicate from 3 kit lots on
three successive days. The MicroPhage Test showed a high ability to
detect MRSA, even in a sample containing >90% MSSA (2 MSSA
calls were made out of 81 total calls). Heteroresistant MRSA showed
more sensitivity to mixture with an MSSA strain The MicroPhage
Test can reliably (P ≥ 95%) detect hMRSA from samples containing
up to 37% MSSA. MRSA could be reliably detected in a culture

--- Page 16 ---
comprised of > 90% methicillin-sensitive Coagulase Negative
Staphylococci (MS-CoNS). Heteroresistant MRSA (hMRSA) could
be reliably detected from samples containing up to 37% MSSA. At
mixtures of ≥79% MSSA the test becomes more likely (P ≥ 50%) to
return a call of MSSA than of MRSA. Mixture of methicillin-resistant
CoNS with MSSA yielded two types of results: 1) if the MR-CoNS
strains were of a type that is intrinsically unreactive with the Test
bacteriophage, no effect was seen, or 2) if the strain was intrinsically
highly reactive (a rare phenotype), the Test returned a call of MRSA at
contamination levels > 25%.
Individual strains were spiked into BACTECTM blood culture bottles
(Aerobic Plus) containing 8-10 mL whole blood, per the Spiking
Model, and grown to alarm on a BACTECTM 9050 blood culture
incubator. MRSA target strains were mixed with contaminant strains
at volumes of 9:1, 1:1, and 1:9, and then the MRSA/MSSA Blood
Culture Test was run. Visual calls of MRSA, MSSA or NSA (not S.
aureus) were made by a panel of three technicians who were blinded
to strain/sample identity. Bacterial input concentrations from blood
bottle samples were determined by dilutional plate count techniques on
tryptic soy agar, and colony forming unit (CFU) data was used to
analyze percentage of MRSA call failures by cell percentage of non-
MRSA co-infecting strain. Tests were run as one test on a single
MRSA/MSSA kit lot on three successive days. Pure cultures of MRSA
or NSA strains were run as controls each day. Correct calls of 100%
were observed for pure cultures of MRSA and NSA (54/54 and 81/81
for MRSA and NSA, respectively). Mixed cultures of MRSA and
NSA generated 486 total calls that were classified as either True (T) or
False (F). Using CFU data, the cell input fraction comprising MRSA
(as % of NSA) for each run were calculated. Assay outcome (T or F)
was plotted against log (fractional MRSA) and a logistic regression fit
was obtained. Based on the logistic fit, failure probabilities (10%, 50%
and 90%) of NSA co-infection were calculated. In the case of Gram
negative rods (e.g. E. coli) and Gram positive cocci in clusters and
pairs (e.g. S. anginosis) the Test is sensitive enough to return an
accurate call 90% of the time with as little as <1% of bacterial input
being MRSA. In presence of Gram positive rods (e.g. B. cereus), the
Test was able to detect MRSA 90% of the time with ~10% of the
bacteria input being MRSA.
When yeast was used as the co-infectant, 90% MRSA call accuracy
required ~ 54% of the input CFU to be MRSA. This observation
resulted from disparities in the cell densities of each organism at blood
culture alarm. Yeast cultures alarm at ~1.6E+06 CFU/mL compared to
average concentration of 5.4E+07 CFU/mL for MRSA cultures. As a
consequence, the cell input of MRSA was reduced significantly
relative to the other NSA strains evaluated in this study. As yeast
Page 16 of 31

--- Page 17 ---
reach cell density at a log lower than MRSA at alarm and grow slower
than S. aureus, under true mixed infection of yeast and S. aureus, yeast
CFU would reach only as high as 10% of total CFU at alarm.
Additionally, the assay correctly returned a NSA call in all cases of
yeast pure cultures run as control (18/18 calls) and indicates no risk of
false response in the Test for this organism.

tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa),
while there were 2 false-positive calls among the Gram-negatives and
12 false-positive calls among the Gram-positives. The Gram-negative
false-positive was observed in a Proteus vulgaris strain. The strain was
retested on two subsequent occasions, but no phage amplification and
no LFI signal was observed on any replicate. The initial false-positive
result may have been an operator error. The Gram-positive false
positives are accounted for by two strains, JMI-7302 (9 MRSA/0 NSA
calls) and JMI-3716 (3 MSSA/6 NSA calls), both S. epidermidis.
These strains are known to be capable of cross-reacting with the
bacteriophage cocktail, and thus likely represent true Test cross-
reactions. The Gram negative false positives could not be repeated on
secondary testing. Based on the strains tested, the overall analytical
specificity of the Test is 98.8%. This value is consistent with the
results of clinical validation, which showed a value of 98.3%
specificity in S. aureus identification.
The following Enterococcus species were evaluated in the analytical
specificity studies with no misidentifications.

bacteriophage-spiked Reaction Media samples containing viral
antigens or PBS-control were detected (i.e. no false-negative results)
when tested with the KeyPathTM MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture – BT
Detector.
Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity) Studies:
Multi-Locus Strain Type (MLST) Reactivity
Inclusivity studies for the KeyPathTM MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture
Test – BT was evaluated on a total of 114 MRSA and MSSA strains
from North America and Western Europe and represented geographic
and phylogenetic diversity including 46 MLS (multilocus sequence)
types representing 17 clonal complexes. The MRSA or MSSA
category of each strain was confirmed by cefoxitin disk diffusion
testing following the guidance of CLSI M100-S20. All disk diffusion
results were in agreement with source categorization of the strain.
The 114 strains were tested in replicate for a total of 228 test runs. Of
the 22 incorrect calls, 20 were ID false-negatives (NSA) and 2 were
false resistant (a single strain, NRS 274, OXA MIC = 2 µg/mL). The
overall sensitivity of detection for S. aureus was 208/228 = 91.8%.
Among S. aureus true positives, accuracy of methicillin resistance and
susceptibility determination is 204/206 = 99.0%.
The only MLS Type with more than one false call was ST239, a
member of CC8, although it has also been described as a chimera of
CC8 and CC30. These strains grew extremely slowly on initial
testing, requiring up to 36 hours before alarm in the BACTEC™ 9050.
(Normal time to alarm in the spike model is 12-16 hours for S.
aureus.) Upon repeat testing, the strains alarmed in the normal time
window, and returned true positive results. The initial result was
thought to be an artifact.
Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) USA Type Strain Reactivity
Ten PFGE USA Type strains (representing 20 NARSA strains) were
tested for reactivity with the MP Test. These strains included USA100
(382,741), USA200 (383, 71, 722), USA 300 (643, 739),USA 300-
0114 (384), USA 400 (123, 192, 193), USA500 (385, 708), USA 600
(648, 715), USA700( 386), USA800 (387), USA 1000 (NRS 483 ) and
USA1100 (NRS 484).
Page 19 of 31

--- Page 20 ---
All of the major clinical types (100, 300, 500) were represented by
multiple isolates, and all yield correct results (MRSA) upon initial
testing with the exception of one of three USA 300 strains which
tested as false negative initially, but was correctly identified at repeat
testing.
Types 700 and 1000 were represented by single isolates and gave false
results (NSA) on initial testing. NRS 386 (USA 700) gave correct
results on retesting, but NRS 483 (USA 1000) repeated the NSA result
on retesting.
Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) Strain Reactivity
Fourteen NARSA strains (8 positive for PVL (123, 192, 193, 384, 483,
484, 643, 739) and 6 negative for PVL (22, 648, 708, 715, 722, 741)
strains were evaluated for this study. The KeyPathTM MRSA/MSSA
Blood Culture Test – BT detected 6/6 PVL-negative strains and 6/7
(plus one mixed result (NRS384)) PVL-positive strains. The false
negative PVL positive strain was NRS 483.
SCCmec Strain Reactivity
Strains with known SCCmec types from NARSA were obtained, and
all isolates were MRSA by cefoxitin disk diffusion (≤ 21mm) and had
a vancomycin MIC of ≤ 2 μg/mL. Seventeen strains representing two
SCC mec types were tested. These included SCC mec II type (71,
192, 382, 383, 648, 715, 722, and 741) and SCC mec IV / Iva type
(123, 193, 384, 385, and 386). Initial testing of the 17 strains (68 runs)
demonstrated that the MP Test identified 56 of the runs as MRSA for
an initial sensitivity of 85%. The three discordant strains were
repeated and 67/68 runs (98.5% strain sensitivity) were correctly
identified as MRSA by the KeyPathTM Test.
Borderline Oxacillin Resistant (BORSA) S. aureus Reactivity
Fourteen Borderline Oxacillin Resistant (BORSA) S. aureus strains
were obtained the Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta GA (CDC, n=6
isolates) and a private collection (n=10 isolates). Both institutions
published on these and similar strains with the same definition for
BORSA (Swenson et al. Diag. Microbiol- Infect. Dis. 58 (2007) 33-39,
Louie et al. - J. Clin. Microbiol. 38 (6) (2000) 2170-2173).
Fourteen isolates were received by MicroPhage with oxacillin
sensitivity classifications, which were determined by the source
laboratory using Broth Micro-Dilution (BMD) techniques and were
known by the source laboratory as mecA negative. ß-lactam resistance
in these strains was also characterized using 1 μg oxacillin or 30 μg
cefoxitin disk diffusion testing (DD) at MicroPhage. Criteria for
antibiotic categorization followed CLSI M100-S19 as: ≥22 mm
Page 20 of 31

--- Page 21 ---
cefoxitin-sensitive; ≥13mm oxacillin- sensitive and 11-12 mm
oxacillin-intermediate. As controls, ATCC 43300 (known MRSA) and
ATCC 25923 (known MSSA) strains were tested. All strains were
mecA-negative but had MIC values of 4-8µg/ml by oxacillin broth
microdilution testing by OXA-BMD methods at the source
laboratories.
Oxacillin disk diffusion testing performed at MicroPhage, 3 strains
tested R, 8 strains tested I, and 5 strains tested S. In cefoxitin disk
diffusion testing, all 16 strains tested S. In the KeyPathTM Test, 1
strain tested R, 2 strains tested R/S (meaning the replicates were
equally divided between R and S) and 13 strains tested S. There were
no differences in performance between kit lots or blood culture
formulations.
Modified intrinsic PBP-bearing Staphylococcus aureus strains (MOD-
SA)
The performance of the KeyPathTM MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test
– BT on rare modified intrinsic PBP-bearing Staphylococcus aureus
strains (MOD-SA) was not evaluated.
SCC mec drop outs
A panel of 28 empty cassette variant S. aureus strains was evaluated
that harbor elements of the SCCmec cassette, but were phenotypically
MSSA. These strains were obtained from two laboratories with
private collections. These strains were extensively characterized with
regard to susceptibility testing and molecular structure, the details of
which have been published in peer-reviewed journals (Donnio et al.
JCM (2005) vol. 43 (8) pp. 4191-3). The strains were multiple
independent isolates, with various mutations in the SCCmec cassette,
and included a variety of MLSTs. The phenotype of these strains was
confirmed by cefoxitin disk diffusion. The KeyPathTM MRSA/MSSA
Blood Culture Test – BT called all 28 strains as MSSA.
Interferent Studies
Three different abnormal sera types (hemolytic, icteric and lipemic)
for a total of 180 tests were performed (4 serum types x 3 strain types
x 15 serum samples) and high concentrations of four different serum
components (hemoglobin, bilirubin, triglycerides and Intralipids) were
evaluated at for a total of 130 tests using ‘high levels’ of hemoglobin,
bilirubin, triglycerides and Intralipids at 5 mg/mL, 200 μg/mL, 30
mg/mL and 3 mmol/L (834 ug/mL of Intralipid) respectively. It was
determined that detector visual calls were not affected by any of four
probable interfering agents or the 3 abnormal sera types tested with the
three test strains (MRSA, MSSA and NSA). Test accuracy remained
100% for all circumstances.
A 20-member Heterophilic Assessment Panel, comprised of 18
samples of human plasma samples containing heterophile antibodies,
Page 21 of 31

--- Page 22 ---
one sample of human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) and one
purchased sample of Rheumatoid factor (Rf) and spiked into high
negative (HN) and low positive (LP) bacteriophage samples. None of
the HAMA, Rf, or heterophilic plasma samples used in this study
interfered with interpretation of Detectors in the KeyPathTM
MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test – BT when challenged at higher
than normal sample volumes. Under normal clinical concentrations,
these antibodies are not expected to interfere with interpretation of the
Test. There was no effect of the component antibiotics on the
functionality of bacteriophage in the KeyPathTM test.
Potential Drug Interferents and Culture Media Interferents
Five antibiotics: 1) cephalexin, 2) ciprofloxacin, 3) gentamicin, 4)
sulfisoxazole and 5) tetracycline, and three analgesics/anti-
inflammatories class 1) acetaminophen, 2) acetylsalicylic acid and 3)
ibuprofen were tested. Acyclovir (antiviral), SPS (anticoagulant), and
antibiotic-absorbing resin from blood culture bottles were also tested.
Each test compound was spiked into the assay at the level
corresponding to the CLSI recommended “test high dose” in blood.
Where CLSI guidance was not available, the compound was tested
above the highest likely or possible level. Two lots of the KeyPathTM
Test were used in the study. The control assay did not contain any
additive. Three control strains were tested in presence of each additive
and under the control condition.
Control strains included were methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA), a methicillin sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and two
coagulase negative Staphylococcus epidermidis (NSA - not-S. aureus).
A total of 330 tests were performed. Results show detection/call
accuracy for MRSA, MSSA and NSA bacteria was 100% and
indicated the MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test - BT was not
adversely affected by any of the potential interfering antibiotics,
analgesics/anti-inflammatories, antiviral, SPS or blood culture bottle
resin compounds.

a. Prospective Clinical studies
Subjects included individuals 18 years of age or older with positive blood
cultures on a BactecTM System (9000 series or F/X), and the sample was
tested on the KeyPathTM MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test – BT within
24 hours of positive determination on Bactec™ System (i.e. alarm).
Aliquots of the blood culture were used to perform standard culture
identification for S. aureus. The KeyPathTM MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture
Test – BT was compared to: 1) the traditional enzymatic methods of
coagulase tube and catalase slide tests and the latex agglutination method
of Staphaurex® (Remel) for detection of Staphylococcus aureus and 2) the
latex agglutination PBP2’ Test (Oxoid) and antibiotic susceptibility
methods Cefoxitin and Oxacillin Sensi-disc (Becton-Dickinson) for
determination of methicillin-resistant (MRSA) or methicillin–susceptible
(MSSA) S. aureus in accordance with CLSI M100-S19. All clinical
validation was performed and interpreted by single users, consistent with
the intended use.
A total of 1116 (366 S. aureus, of which 191 were MRSA, 173 were
MSSA, and 2 not evaluated) paired samples were tested for MRSA/MSSA
by the KeyPathTM MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test – BT and the culture
gold standard across all study sites. Sensitivity and specificity of the
MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test vs. Gold Standard/predicate methods
was 91.8% (88.5, 94.4; n=156) and 98.3% (97.1, 99.1; n = 180),
respectively.
The sponsor compared the results of the KeyPathTM MRSA/MSSA Blood
Culture Test – BT to 30 μg cefoxitin disks and 1 μg oxacillin disks in
accordance with CLSI M100-S19 in 336 paired tests. Additional MRSA
characterization was performed using the PBP2’ latex agglutination test.
The Very Major Errors (vmj) and Major Errors (maj) were calculated as
described in the AST guidance. The MRSA detection was acceptable
using the cefoxitin disk testing, but not with the oxacillin disk testing. For
cefoxitin, the vmj rate 1.11 % with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of
0.1348, 3.956 and the maj rate was 0.6% with a 95% CI of 0.01644,
3.565. The oxacillin vmj rate was 8.76% with a 95% CI of 5.19, 13.66
and maj errors were 0.82% with a 95% CI 0.02058, 4.446.
The category NSA (not Staphylococcus aureus) indicates isolates which
were not identified as Staphylococcus aureus and do not progress further
to susceptibility testing. In these studies the percent of reference MRSA
Page 23 of 31

--- Page 24 ---
positive results which were KeyPathTM Test NSA was 5.76% (11/191) and
the percent of reference MSSA positive results which were NSA was
10.98% (19/173) as compared to cefoxitin.
Within S. aureus positives determined to be either MRSA or MSSA by
KeyPathTM Test, the MRSA call was 98.9% (178/180) accurate and the
MSSA determination was 99.4% (153/154) accurate compared to the
cefoxitin disk diffusion result. These results are summarized in the
following tables:

There were two isolates which were identified as MSSA by
MicroPhage BT but identified as MRSA by the cefoxitin gold
standard. The two strains, 52217 and 54011, were found to be mecA-
positive based on PBP2a results, and neither appeared to be borderline
resistant based on zone of inhibition results. Sample 54011 was the
only sample tested from this patient, while sample 52217 was one of 9
positive blood cultures tested from its respective patient. The
additional 8 samples were all called MRSA by both the MP BT Test
and the reference methods. Strain 52217 was not further characterized
as it gave correct results on retesting (4/4 trials) and that clinical
testing error of 52217 was attributed to either manufacturer defect or
operator error. Strain 54011 was determined to be USA100/800,
mecA-Type 2, PVL and TSST negative. It was noted that the MP BT
Test discrepancy appeared to be due to inadequate bacteriophage
amplification due to strain variance as molecular characterization. In
this evaluation it was noted that of the 60 strains typed by the
reference lab, 12 had the 100/800 PFGE type, and 11 were called
correctly. Of 10 strains with mecA type 2, 9 were called correctly.

*In the studies performed, the KeyPathTM Test significantly under
called MRSA by the oxacillin disk diffusion gold standard as
compared to the cefoxitin disk diffusion gold standard. Of the 17 Very
Major Errors, 15 disagreed with both the cefoxitin disk diffusion
results and the MicroPhage Test results. Of 16 samples that were
called MRSA by oxacillin and MSSA by cefoxitin, 15 were from one
site. The difference in reading method at this site was thought to
account for most or all of the discrepancies between oxacillin and
cefoxitin diffusion test results. Further investigation revealed a
systematic downshift of 3mm in zone of inhibition diameter.

One strain each of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus warneri,
Staphylococcus gallinarum, Staphylococcus lugdunensis and 2 strains
of Staphylococcus epidermidis cross reacted with the Test. At all sites
72 Enterococcus samples and 19 "Gram-positive, non-Staph" samples
(comprised of Enterococcus and Streptococcus) were identified. Of
these ~80 Enterococcus samples, only one gave a false-positive result.
Fatty acid GC analysis and repeat sequencing data of this strain show
that the best (not perfect) match to E. faecalis. This isolate was
thought to be an atypical strain of E. faecalis.

Four clinical sites were included in the study. Per protocol, each site
was instructed to collect samples from positive blood cultures, 0 – 24
hours after detection (i.e. alarm), from the BactecTM Culture System.
Acceptable blood culture bottle types included BactecTM plus Aerobic
and Plus Anaerobic bottles. Only patients >= 18 years of age were
included in the study. A Gram stain was performed, bacteria were
examined and only samples tested as Gram positive cocci in clusters
(GPCC) were carried forward for additional testing. After Gram stain,
samples were tested with a) the KeyPathTM MRSA/MSSA Blood

Culture Test – BT per MP2009-B and b) a cohort of Gold Standard
and predicate tests including: coagulase tube test, catalase slide test,
and Staphaurex® Test. The ID Gold Standard is defined as concordant
results between the catalase, coagulase and Staphaurex® tests. In order
to preserve blinding of sample information/results different
technologists performed the Gold Standard tests and another group of
technologists performed the predicate and MRSA/MSSA Blood
Culture Tests. For S. aureus positive samples, PBP2’ Test, Cefoxitin
Sensi-disc Test and Oxacillin Sensi-disc Test were performed to
determine antibiotic susceptibility. The Cefoxitin Sensi-disc test was
defined as the Gold Standard for MRSA/MSSA determination on S.
aureus-positive samples.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
In the KeyPathTM MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test – BT clinical study, a
total 1114 clinical specimens were tested and determined to be MRSA,
MSSA or not-S. aureus by reference culture methods. The number and
percentage of MRSA and MSSA positive cases by age group are shown in
the table below. For comparison, 16.5% of Gram-positive blood cultures
in the US in 2002 were determined to be S. aureus (Ann Clin
Microbiology Antimicrobial (2004) vol. 3 pp. 7). Of these, 8.1% were
methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and 8.4% were methicillin-susceptible
(MSSA). The frequency of MRSA and MSSA isolated at a given location
should be confirmed by the user.
