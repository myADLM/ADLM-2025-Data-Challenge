L. Test Principle:
Specific, recombinant treponemal antigens are immobilized on the
membrane. Patient samples or controls are added to the sample well,
followed by a buffer, and as the sample flows through the absorbent device,
the human immunoglobulins bind to the antigens forming an antigen-
antibody complex. The antigen-antibody complex further reacts with a
unique combination of colloidal gold conjugated Protein A and anti-human
immunoglobulins producing a pink-rose colored band that can be read
visually indicating antibody is present in the patient's sample. A separate
Control Line indicates reagents are functioning correctly.

M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To demonstrate the reproducibility of the Syphilis Health Check
Treponemal Antibody Test, the assay was evaluated at three study sites
using trained technicians for within-Run and between day
reproducibility using a panel of pooled samples. Each testing site
conducted reproducibility studies using a supplied panel ranging from
non-reactive to highly reactive, i.e. one nonreactive, one high
(borderline) nonreactive, one low (borderline) reactive, one moderate
reactive, and two mid-high to high reactive in addition to the kit
controls. Each site ran these panel member solutions for at least 10 days
total spread throughout the study period. A second study included low
(borderline) reactive and moderate reactive samples, each site ran these
panel member solutions for at least 5 days, twice per day. Each site
performed one Within-Run assay by each of the operators each run for
10 times on one day. The following testing results were obtained,

Cross-Reactivity Study
To test for possible cross-reactivity, panels of samples were obtained to
evaluate potential interference from different disease conditions
confirmed positive and containing different concentrations of potentially
cross-reactive antibodies and were analyzed with the Syphilis Health
Check test. Out of 151 (138 were Males) prospectively collected drug
users, 11 (7%) were syphilis positive by reference methods and Syphilis
Health Check, with two additional samples positive for Syphilis Health
Check. Two samples from Lyme disease and HSV showed a positive
result with Syphilis Health Check but could not be confirmed. One
sample each from CMV positive and heterophile positive patients were
Syphilis Health Check positive, but non-reactive by reference methods.
Two HPV patients were Syphilis Health Check positive with one
confirmed by reference methods. Two co-infected Chlamydia/GC
patients were Syphilis Health Check and one confirmed positive by
TPPA. The number of disease condition categories and reactive results
obtained is listed in the following table.

Syphilis Positive HIV / HCV / HBV Patients :
A series of 13 patients EDTA Plasma samples obtained from a blood
center were identified as screened RPR positive in patients that were
also confirmed positive for HIV, HCV and/or Hepatitis B virus. Three
of these patients were further identified as previously testing positive for
syphilis and treated at that time. All of the samples were tested with
TPPA and Syphilis Health Check to evaluate syphilis reactivity. All 13
samples were positive for RPR, TPPA, and Syphilis Health Check.
To further evaluate the influence of HIV on Syphilis Health Check
results, a series of 24 banked serum containing high levels of viral load
for HIV were tested with Syphilis Health Check. The HIV positive
patient samples were purchased from a commercial serum supplier that
was known to be RPR and/or Treponema positive. The samples were
tested by an outside lab with the Syphilis Health Check test to assess
reactivity. Six of these samples were Nonreactive by RPR but reactive
with TPHA. One sample was RPR positive, but TPHA nonreactive. All
24 samples were Syphilis Health Check Positive.
Pregnant Women:
A series of sixty-nine (69) pregnant female samples were purchased
from a vendor that had known trimester, age, and ethnicity. An
additional set of 93 pregnant women serum samples were obtained from
a commercial source that were identified as syphilis positive by RPR
screening and further tested with TPPA and Syphilis Health Check. Age
and trimester were known, but ethnicity was not identified. Three
samples out of the 162 total samples were RPR low positive but
nonreactive by the treponemal reference method.

The results obtained from the cross reactive study are acceptable.
Interference Testing
Interference testing was conducted using serum. Concentrates of the
compounds were prepared and diluted to multiple concentrations into
eight sera with different levels of syphilis reactivity. The following
results were obtained:
Hemoglobin: No effect was observed up to 1000 mg/dL of
hemoglobin;
Bilirubin (total): No effect was observed up to 40 mg/dL of
total bilirubin;
Triglycerides: No effect was observed up to 3000 mg/dL of
triglycerides.
Cholesterol (total): No effect was observed up to 400mg/dL of
cholesterol
Albumin: No effect was observed up to 1000 mg/dL of albumin
Gamma-globulin: No effect as observed up to 5000 mg/dL of
gamma-globulin
The results obtained from the interference study are acceptable.
f. Assay cut-off:
The Master Cutoff of the assay was determined by calibrating against a
panel of confirmed uninfected patient samples and borderline
treponemal positive samples diluted to assess the imprecision around the
cut-off of the assay. The samples obtained were commercially available
serum "standardized" against the WHO Reference Material.
Negative
One colored band appears in the control area.
Positive
In addition to the control band, a distinguishable band also appears in
the test area.
Inconclusive
If there is no distinct color band visible in the test and control areas, the
test is inconclusive. In this case, repeat the test.

3. Clinical Studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
In order to evaluate the performance of the Syphilis Health Check test a
series of 880 patient samples were obtained from prospective study sites
and 412 frozen retrospective samples purchased from outside
commercial vendors and blood centers. In addition, a series of 164
clinically diagnosed samples were obtained that were known primary,
secondary, and latent both treated and untreated. The total of 1292
known retrospective samples (576) and prospectively collected (880)
patient samples were used to demonstrate the performance of the
Syphilis Health Check test to Non-treponemal RPR and other
treponemal tests.
Prospective Studies were conducted at five clinical study sites which
compared the Syphilis Health Check to RPR, a non-treponemal test, and
treponemal tests such as TPPA, TPHA, or ELISA, using specimens from
patients coming into four STD clinics and one hospital clinic. The
patients enrolled in the study were identified by medical associates as
suspected positive for syphilis and exhibiting symptoms.
Initial evaluations were performed at a university clinic and a hospital
clinic to assess the performance of the Syphilis Health-Check test versus
RPR and their reference treponemal tests - FTA and TPHA. Only
gender and age were collected from these patients. A more
comprehensive study was performed at three study sites to collect
further patient history information in order to identify a broader range of
STD related patients. The information and data collected from these
sites is presented below.
The Syphilis Health Check assay demonstrated 95.6% and 98.5%
Percent Positive Agreement versus the non-treponemal test and
treponemal tests, respectively, and 90.5% and 97.3% Percent Negative

suppliers consisting of 149 banked RPR and treponemal reactive serum
samples, 28 serum samples that were requested to be Primary or Secondary
Patients, treated or untreated, but exhibiting a Syphilitic-type lesion or rash
from a serum supplier, and 138 frozen serum and plasma samples from a
blood center. The samples were found to be RPR and treponemal reactive
and having mixed titers. Another series of 97 samples being highly
suspected of having a syphilis infection were obtained from a serum supplier
that were obtained from various laboratories around the U.S., and were
submitted to the laboratories for testing. The samples were tested by RPR,
TPPA, and MHA-TP as reference methods for comparison to Syphilis
Health Check test.

The samples were further tested by an outside laboratory for TPPA titer and
Syphilis Health Check results. Nineteen samples were found to be Negative
for TPPA and Syphilis Health Check and Reactive RPR, four samples were
negative by TPPA, but Positive by Syphilis Health Check and RPR, one
sample was Syphilis Health Check negative and positive RPR and TPPA,
and one sample was RPR neg but TPPA and Syphilis Health Check positive.
The remaining two hundred eighty-nine samples remained Positive by all
four methods. In the Suspected Positive patients two samples were negative
with Syphilis Health Check, with one sample low reactive with RPR, and
both samples Non-Reactive with TPHA. The results of the testing are
shown below.

5. Expected Values/Reference Range:
To assess the expected values (normal range) of the Syphilis Health Check
test a series of ninety-eight samples were obtained from various hospital
laboratories in different U.S. geographical locations. The samples came
from a general “presumed” healthy normal population (ages 20 – 66 yrs)
whose serum or plasma were collected by hospital laboratories for routine
serology testing, not related to STD.
All of the samples were tested with RPR, TPPA and Syphilis Health Check
tests. Two samples were found positive by the treponemal tests with both

samples non-reactive with RPR. These 2 samples were confirmed with
MHA-TP.
The testing of a presumed normal population showed an overall agreement
of 100% for the Syphilis Health Check test. Therefore from this study of
ninety-eight presumed normal samples, two were confirmed positive
resulting in a 2% positivity rate.
In a prospectively collected population of drug users visiting STD clinics, of
138 males and 13 females (ages 18 - 61 yrs), thirteen (8.6%) were found to
be Syphilis Health Check test positive with eleven of those also reference
method positive.
In a series of 69 pregnant women, ages 20 - 40 yrs, that were tested for
routine screening, one sample (1.4%) was found to be Syphilis Health
Check positive and confirmed by reference methods.
Eight hundred eighty (880) patients were prospectively collected in a
population of individuals visiting STD and hospital clinics and POC sites
complaining and/or exhibiting signs and symptoms of STD infections, ages
16 - 81 yrs, and having 53% to 47% male to female ratio. A range of 3% -
6% of the patients identified as suspected as having syphilis were found
positive by Syphilis Health Check and yielded a Percent positive agreement
to RPR of 98.3% and 95.7% to treponemal tests. Percent Negative
Agreement to RPR and Treponemal test was 93.4% and 97.8%,
respectively. Overall Agreement to RPR and Treponemal tests was 94.1%
and 97.4%, respectively.
These results are consistent with published rates for prevalence of antibody
in the adult population. Prevalence may vary depending on a variety of
factors such as geography, age, socio-economic status, ethnic background,
type of test employed, specimen collection and handling procedures, clinical
and epidemiological history.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part
