H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The BD GeneOhm™ VanR Assay is a qualitative in vitro test for the rapid
detection of vancomycin-resistance (vanA and vanB) genes directly from perianal
or rectal swabs. The BD GeneOhm™ VanR Assay detects the presence of the
vanA and vanB genes that can be associated with vancomycin-resistant
enterococci (VRE). The assay is performed on an automated real-time PCR
instrument with perianal or rectal swabs from individuals at risk for VRE
colonization. The BD GeneOhm™ VanR Assay can be used as an aid to identify,
prevent and control vancomycin-resistant colonization in healthcare settings. The
BD GeneOhm™ VanR Assay is not intended to diagnose VRE infections nor to
guide or monitor treatment for VRE infections. Concomitant cultures are
necessary to recover organisms for epidemiological typing, susceptibility testing
and for further confirmatory identification.

I. Device Description:
The test uses a perianal and/or rectal swab specimen, which is resuspended in a
sample preparation buffer tube. The suspension is added to a lysis tube. The lysate is
then added to a PCR master mix including vanA and vanB specific primers and an
internal control (IC) template. The reaction takes place in a disposable reaction tube
placed in the SmartCycler® analyzer. Discrimination of amplicons indicative of drug
resistance is done by using a molecular beacon with different fluorometric properties
than those of the beacon for the detection of the internal control.
The SmartCycler® software simultaneously monitors the fluorescence emitted by
each molecular beacon probe, interprets all data, and provides a final result at the end
of the cycling program.
The operation of the SmartCycler® is based on the proprietary microprocessor-
controlled I-CORETM (Intelligent Cooling/Heating Optical Reaction) module
(SmartCycler® Diagnostic, Operator Manual).

inhibitory substances. The amplified DNA targets are detected with molecular
beacons, hairpin-forming single stranded oligonucleotides labeled at one end with a
quencher and at the other end with a fluorescent reporter dye (fluorophore). In the
absence of target, the fluorescence is quenched. In the presence of target, the hairpin
structure opens upon beacon/target hybridization, resulting in emission of
fluorescence. For the detection of vanA amplicons, the molecular beacon contains the
fluorophore FAM at the 5’ end and the non-fluorescent quencher moiety DABCYL at
the opposite end of the oligonucleotide. For the detection of the vanB amplicons, the
molecular beacon contains the fluorophore Texas Red at the 5’ end and the quencher
DABCYL at the 3’ end. For the detection of the Internal Control (IC) amplicons, the
molecular beacon contains the fluorophore TET at the 5’ end and the quencher
DABCYL at the 3’ end. Each beacon-target hybrid fluoresces at a wavelength
characteristic of the fluorophore used in the particular molecular beacon. The amount
of fluorescence at any given cycle, or following cycling, depends on the amount of
specific amplicons present at that time. The SmartCycler® software simultaneously
monitors the fluorescence emitted by each beacon, interprets all data, and provides a
final result at the end of the cycling program.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility panel consisted of low positives near the LoD, moderate
and blank (negative) specimens. Panel members were prepared from samples
containing negative matrix inoculated with organisms harboring the targeted
genes. Specimen Processing Controls (SPC) and Run Controls (Positive and
Negative) were included. Each panel member was tested in triplicate per
panel run, over five days, with two runs per day and two technologists per
site. Two external and one internal, with one lot of reagents, were used to
assess site-to-site reproducibility. One clinical site participated in an extended
study where two additional lots of reagents were tested to assess lot-to-lot
reproducibility with low and moderate positive and negative members.
Site-to-site and lot-to-lot demonstrated >95% reproducibility across negative,
low positive and moderate positive categories for both vanA and vanB.

Precision
Within-laboratory precision was evaluated for the BD GeneOhm VanR Assay
at one site. Samples included simulated specimens representing low and
moderate positive vanA and vanB containing VRE, high negative specimens
(100-fold and 10-fold dilutions of a sample prepared at the LoD), and samples
negative for VRE. The study was performed over 12 days, with two (2) runs
per day and two (2) sample replicates (negative specimens) or three (3)
sample replicates (low/moderate positives and high negatives) per run. All
samples produced reportable results. Precision study results for negative
samples, low and moderate positive samples demonstrated agreement for
100% of the replicates. The more dilute (1:100) high negative panel member,
containing lower levels of target, demonstrated a higher percent agreement
(68.1% and 69.4% for vanA and vanB respectively) for negative test results
than the less dilute (1:10) panel member (1.4% and 4.2% for vanA and vanB
respectively), which contains higher levels of target.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Positive and negative controls are assay controls (run controls). Assay
controls were performed at each site demonstrating acceptable QC results
most of the time. The overall invalid result (i.e. failure of the positive and/or
negative run controls) rates were 3.4% (6/177). The overall initial unresolved
7

--- Page 8 ---
results (i.e. failure of the internal control) rate was 1.1%.
External specimen processing controls (E. faecalis ATCC 51299 for VRE, and
E. faecalis ATCC 29212 as VSE) were also performed. There were a total of
156 SPC runs for the clinical trial, with an acceptable valid SPC rate of 91.7%
(143/156).
Stability Studies
Reagents Stability
The reagents in their protective sealed pouches for the stability claim of 2-
25ºC were tested at 5±3 º C for 21 months and 25±2 º C for 12 months on
three lots. Data supported that the reconstituted Master Mix and Control
DNA were stable:
a) In the original container, in an ice bucket or cooling block at
ambient temperature, for up to 3 hours.
b) In the SmartCycler tubes, in an ice bucket or cooling block at
ambient temperature, for up to 1 hour.
c) Outside their protective pouch before reconstitution, for up to 2
hours at ambient temperature.
Specimen Stability
The DNA amplifiability results showed that the four transport media allowed
the sample eluate storage at ambient temperature for 48 hrs or 4ºC for 5 days.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LOD) was determined in rectal and perianal matrix
with one vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium containing the vanA
gene (ATCC 700221) and with three vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus
faecalis, each containing one of the vanB (ATCC 51299), vanB (TUH1-75)
1 2
or vanB (TUH7-68) gene variants. Quantitative culture diluted into negative
3
or perianal matrix was tested in 24 replicates. The LOD was determined using
statistical modeling of the lowest concentration of viable organisms achieving
95% detection with the assay. The LoD was determined as follows:
Rectal Perianal
CFU/rxn CFU/swab CFU/rxn CFU/swab
E. faecium vanA 3 2500 1 833
E. faecalis vanB 2 1449 5 3623

Analytical Reactivity
A total of 156 vancomycin resistant strains (representing 19 countries) from
well characterized c1inical isolates or public collections were evaluated using
the BD GeneOhm™ VanR Assay. The detection rate was 99.4% (155/156).
Challenge Study
A challenge set comprising of 50 well characterized Enterococci spp. was
evaluated. The study included 30 vancomycin resistance due to the vanA or
vanB, 10 intrinsically vancomycin resistant (i.e. vanC), and10 vancomycin
susceptible Enterococci. All results were as expected.
e. Analytical specificity:
Genomic DNA or culture lysate were tested for the cross-reactivity study. It
included one human DNA specimen, 98 closely related organisms, normal and
pathogenic perianal and/or rectal flora, 27 strains of vancomycin-susceptible
enterococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci other than vanA/vanB (i.e.
vanC, vanC , vanD, vanE, and vanG). All results were negative.
2
Vancomycin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) strains
Genomic DNA of five VRSA strains from Network on Antimicrobial
Resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (NARSA) were tested with the BD
GeneOhm™ VanR Assay to determine if amplification/detection of vanA and
vanB genes occurred. The GeneOhm™ VanR Assay detected the vanA gene
in all the VRSA strains; vanB was not detected in any of these strains. They
were also positive on agarose gel for vanA.
Potentially interfering substances
Potentially interfering substances were tested using materials that may be
found in the rectum, such as petroleum jellies, creams, blood, suppositories.
Undiluted hydrocortisone cream USP gave unresolved results; blood
demonstrated an inhibitory effect and could cause a negative result for a low
positive signal.
f. Assay cut-off:
Acceptance Criteria for the BD GeneOhm™ VanR Assay were established
during assay development and pre-validated at one external site with 216
specimens prior to the clinical trial. The acceptance criteria included:
Endpoint threshold, 2nd derivative threshold, minimum cycle threshold,
maximum cycle threshold, and IC% endpoint threshold.
The following table demonstrates the acceptance criteria for the assay:

2. Comparison studies:
The reference method consisted of direct culture complemented by enriched
culture. Enriched culture analysis was completed for all specimens that were
negative for VRE by direct culture. Direct culture was performed by inoculating
specimens onto a primary isolation media containing Bile Esculin Azide agar
supplemented with 6μg/mL vancomycin (BEAV). Enriched culture was
performed by inoculating 300 µL of sample buffer containing the specimen into
BEA broth or BEAV broth (BEA broth supplemented with 6µg/mL vancomycin).
Vancomycin resistance was determined for confirmed enterococcal colonies by
using a MIC method. Confirmed vancomycin-resistant enterococcal isolates were
further tested for genotypic characterization (i.e. vanA and vanB genes) by use of
an alternative PCR method.

Not Applicable
3. Clinical studies:
The clinical study was conducted at five medical centers. A total of 2156
specimens were tested using Direct/Enriched culture with alternative PCR and the
BD GeneOhm VanR™ Assay, producing 2150 (1316 perianal and 834 rectal
specimens) reportable results. Two hundred and twenty-two specimens (123
perianal and 99 rectal) were culture negative but positive for vanB only by the BD
GeneOhm VanR™ PCR and may represent detection of the vanB gene in non-
enterococcal organisms. Further investigation for non-enterococcal organisms
10

that might contain the vanB gene was not performed.
In comparison to Direct/Enriched culture with alternative PCR, the BD
GeneOhm™ VanR Assay identified 92.9% and 93.1% of the perianal and rectal
positive specimens, respectively, and identified 86.0% and 82.2% of the perianal
and rectal negative specimens, respectively.

N. Instrument Name:
Automated SmartCycler® System (instrument, Dx Software version 1.7b, 3.0a or
3.0b)
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The operation of the Smart Cycler instrument is based on the proprietary
microprocessor –controlled I-CORE (Intelligent Cooling/Heating Optical
Reaction) module. Each Smart Cycler processing block contains 16
independently controlled, programmable I-CORE modules, each with one
reaction site. Thermally optimized proprietary reaction tubes combined with the
design of the I-CORE modules allow very rapid temperature cycling and rapid
amplification. Up to 6 Smart Cycler processing blocks can be daisy-chained
together, allowing simultaneous analysis of 96 discrete samples. Information
regarding data acquisition, data analysis and diagnostic algorithm was submitted
and cleared under k022504 and k042357
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed the applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development

3. Specimen Identification:
A liquid or soft stool specimen is collected and transported to the laboratory. A
sterile dry swab is dipped into the liquid or soft stool material and processed.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
For testing, the swab is eluted in sample buffer and the specimen is lysed. An
aliquot of the lysate is added to PCR reagents which contain the vanA and vanB
specific primers used to amplify the genetic target, if present. Amplified targets
are detected with hybridization probes labeled with quenched fluorophores
(molecular beacons). The amplification, detection and interpretation of the signals
are done automatically by the Cepheid SmartCycler software. The entire
procedure takes about 60 to 75 minutes
5. Calibration:
N/A
6. Quality Control:
Positive and Negative Controls
Quality control procedures are designed to monitor assay performance. The
positive control is intended to monitor substantial reagent failure. The negative
control is used to detect reagent or environmental contamination (or carry-over)
by either DNA containing vanA or vanB genes or amplicons. Positive and
negative controls are assay controls (run controls). An invalid control invalidates
the run. Finally, an internal control incorporated into each reaction mixture is
intended to monitor the reagent integrity and PCR inhibition in each specimen.
One positive control and one negative control must be included in each assay run
on the SmartCycler®. The software automatically assigns the position of the
controls on the instrument.
Specimen Processing Controls
A reference VRE strain (e.g. American Type Culture Collection, ATCC 51299) or
a well characterized VRE clinical isolate may be used as a positive specimen
processing control. A vancomycin sensitive enterococci (e.g. ATCC 29212) or
non-vanA/vanB VRE (e.g. Enterococcus gallinarum ATCC 700425) may be used
as a negative specimen processing control.
Re-suspend isolated colonies from an 18 to 24 h 5% sheep blood agar plate in
saline to a turbidity of 0.5 McFarland (approximately1.5 x 105 CFU/mL). Dilute
14

--- Page 15 ---
with saline to obtain a suspension of approximately 106 CFU/mL. Dip a
recommended swab into the bacterial suspension and press out the excess fluid.
Process and test as a clinical specimen. The specimen processing controls should
yield valid results.
