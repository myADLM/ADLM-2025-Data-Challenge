I. Device Description:
The GSP Neonatal IRT kit consists of the following reagents:
1. The anti-IRT-Eu tracer is a stock solution of approximately 50 ug/mL of mouse
monoclonal antibodies. There are three vials, each containing 2.4 mL. The tracer
is in Tris-HCl buffered (pH 7.8) salt solution with bovine serum albumin, mouse
IgG and less than 0.1% sodium azide (preservative). The Neo IRT Assay buffer is
provided in three 120 mL bottles containing Tris-HCl buffered (pH 7.8) salt
solution with bovine serum albumin bovine globulin, Tween 40,
polyethyleneglycol 6000, an inert red dye and less than 0.1% sodium azide
(preservative). The Anti-IRT microtitration strips come as three sets of four
plates. These strips contain 8x12 wells coated with antibodies directed against a
specific site on the IRT molecules (mouse monoclonal).
2. Calibrators consist of 7 filter paper cassettes (Whatman, no. 903) each containing
1 set of dried blood spots (DBS) with the following concentrations of IRT: 0
ng/ml, 25 ng/mL, 50 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, 250 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL of blood.
3. Controls consist of 5 filter paper cassettes (Whatman, no. 903), each containing 2
sets of DBS. Level C1 contains 30 ng/mL of blood, level C2 contains 70 ng/mL
of blood, and level C3 contains 110 ng/mL of blood. (Note that 1ng/mL blood
equals 2.22 ng/mL serum assuming 55% hematocrit). (The lyophilized controls
are produced from trypsin in Tris-HCl buffered salt solution with bovine serum
albumin and protease inhibitors.)
These calibrators and controls were prepared from human blood components
tested using FDA approved methods and shown to be free from hepatitis B
surface antigen, anti-hepatitis C and anti-HIV 1 and 2 antibodies.

L. Test Principle:
The GSP Neonatal IRT assay is a solid phase, two-site fluoroimmunometric assay
based on the direct sandwich technique in which two monoclonal antibodies (derived
from mice) are directed against two separate antigenic determinants on the IRT
molecule. Calibrators, controls or test specimens containing IRT are reacted
simultaneously with immobilized monoclonal antibodies directed against a specific
antigenic site on the IRT molecule and europium-labeled monoclonal antibodies
(directed against a different antigenic site) in assay buffer. The assay buffer elutes
IRT from dried blood on filter paper disks. The complete assay requires only one
incubation step.
DELFIA Inducer dissociates europium ions from the labeled antibody into solution
where they form highly fluorescent chelates with components of the DELFIA
Inducer. The fluorescence in each well is then measured. The fluorescence of each

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated according to the CLSI Document EP5-A2, Evaluation
of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods. Heparinized
whole blood samples (1- 9) were used in these studies to prepare DBS.
Natural (1-3) samples with endogenous IRT, samples spiked with exogenous
IRT (4-9) and a control (10) sample were chosen to cover the measuring range
of the GSP Neonatal IRT kit, which is from 9 to 500 ng/mL. The hematocrit
of the samples was adjusted to 50 to 55% to correspond to the hematocrit of
neonates. The IRT activities of the series of DBS samples were measured by
three operators with three GSP Neonatal IRT kit lots in 27 runs over 21
operating days using three GSP instruments (9 runs per instrument). Three kit
controls in four replicates were included in each run (In this study one run
means a run consisting of two plates tested 20-24 hours apart on the same
instrument with stored calibration.) The within run study was performed
using one reagent lot only in order to assess the variation between lots.
Separate estimations for the precision of GSP Neonatal IRT assays were
calculated with two options: a full calibration curve in duplicate for each plate
and a full calibration curve for every batch of two plates. Results are
summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated according to the CLSI Document EP6-A2, Evaluation
of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical
Approach. The claimed measuring range for this device is 9 – 500 ng/mL
blood.
Fresh patient specimens with high IRT concentration were not available.
Therefore, blood drown from one healthy adult was split into two aliquots,
one representing the “low concentration pool” and a second aliquot used to
prepare the high concentration pool. Purified human trypsin (Scripps
Laboratories) was added to a second pool to obtain a “high concentration”
sample. Samples with intermediate concentrations were prepared by mixing
the “low concentration” sample with the “high concentration” sample. The
hematocrit of the samples was adjusted to 50 to 55% to correspond to the
hematocrit of neonates. The series of samples were used to prepare DBS by
dispensing the prepared samples onto filter paper and dried overnight. There
is no international reference material or reference method for IRT that could
be employed to determine targets for the linearity samples.
A polynomial evaluation of linearity was used for the data analysis. The
assumption of constant variance across all levels is not fulfilled in the GSP
Neonatal IRT kit. Rather, the variance is proportional across different
measurement levels. Therefore, weighted regression models were used.
A linear regression line and second and third order polynomials were fitted to
the data. The results of regression analyses were compared. The significance
of the second and third order polynomials were evaluated by performing a t-
test. Both, the second and third order regressions have no statistically
significant nonlinear terms (β2, β3) at a 95% significance level (p-value
<0.05). The fitted models are:
Linear: y = 9.18 + 622x
Second order: y = 9.19 + 621x + 3x2
Third order: y = 9.21 +616x + 30x2 + -26x3
Where y = IRT concentration (ng/mL) and x = dilution point.

95% CI: slope (0.98; 1.03)
95% CI: intercept (-0.59; 0.90)
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The GSP Neonatal IRT kit also includes calibrators and controls which need
to be employed in assay calibration and quality control (QC) testing. The kit
calibrators and controls are DBS prepared from blood cell suspension
consisting of washed human red blood cells and artificial serum. The blood
used to prepare the kit calibrators is spiked with purified human trypsin to
cover the range of 0 – 500 ng/mL blood, whereas the kit controls are spiked at
the clinically relevant concentration area (control levels 30, 70, 110 ng/mL
blood).
Traceability: There is no international reference material that can be used as
the primary calibrator and no reference method that can be used to assign
values. The IRT concentration is traceable to the in-house primary calibrators
prepared from Human Pancreas Trypsin. The primary calibrators are a
dilution series of trypsin made gravimetrically with Tris-HCl buffered
solution with bovine serum and protease inhibitors. Protein concentration of
the trypsin raw material has been determined spectrophotometrically using an
Extinction Coefficient (A289, 0.1% solution, 1 cm pathway) of 1.45. The
possible change of trypsin immunoreactivity occurring during the
lyophilization step performed during primary calibrator manufacturing is

corrected by measuring the IRT concentration of the lyophilized calibrators
against non-lyophilized calibrators. The primary calibrators are stored at -60
to -80oC.
The primary calibrators are used to monitor the level of the secondary
calibrators.
Value assignment: The primary and secondary calibrators are in house
materials that are used for the A-F level specific calibrators. The acceptance
criteria for value assignment were reviewed and found to be adequate.
Stability: Real time stability studies evaluating shelf-life, shipping stability
and on-board stability for the entire kit were performed, including the
calibrators and controls. The protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed
and found to be adequate. The GSP Neonatal IRT assay reagents, controls and
calibrators are stable for 12 months when stored unopened at 2 – 8° C and 14
days on-board at 2-8 0C.
Detection limit:
The Limit of the Blank (LoB) for the GSP Neonatal IRT L kit was determined
in accordance with the CLSI guideline EP17-A: Protocols for Determination
of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation. 120 measurements of two
sample types, the zero calibrator and dried human blood spots (3 samples of
“zero” calibrator and 2 unspiked blood samples), were tested in six separate
runs, replicates of four, over three operating days.
The Limit of the Blank was determined to be 0.76 ng/mL, the 95thpercentile
of the distribution of the test values.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) is defined as the sample concentration where
the 95% of measurements exceeds LoB. The Limit of Detection (LoD) is
estimated to be 2.2 ng/mL blood based on 504 determinations of 7 low level
samples.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) is the lowest concentration of IRT that can be
measured with acceptable total variation and is equal or higher than LoD. The
observed LoQ of the GSP Neonatal IRT assay is 2.2 ng/mL blood, when the
acceptable total variation is defined as CV<20%.
d. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed a study to evaluate the effect of potential interfering
substances in dried blood samples (such as unconjugated and conjugated
bilirubin, lipemia and hemoglobin) on the performance of the GSP Neonatal
IRT assay. These studies were performed in accordance with CLSI EP7-A2,
Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline. The blood
was spiked with trypsin to obtain two different clinically relevant IRT
concentrations (approximately 50 and 80 ng/mL blood).The IRT responses of
8

--- Page 9 ---
the DBS interference samples were analyzed with one kit lot in 12 replicates.
Three kit controls in duplicate were included in each run. The pool without
any additions, except equal volume of solvent used to dissolve the substance,
was used as a control. The table below lists all substances tested at
concentrations with no significant interference. The no significant interference
(acceptance criteria) was defined as ≤15% interference for samples in
clinically relevant range of 25 to 500 ng/mL and ≤20% interference for
samples below 25 ng/mL:

Intralipid (triglycerides) 1500 mg/dL in blood
Additional study was performed to evaluate the potential cross-reactivity of
the GSP Neonatal IRT kit with substances structurally similar to IRT. The list

retrospective specimens) in the range of 10.4 – 322 ng/mL and DBS prepared
from spiked samples (N=47) in the range of 322 – 500 ng/mL were tested and
compared between the new device (GSP Neonatal IRT) and predicate device
(AutoDELFIA IRT). These studies were performed using three lots of both
the GSP Neonatal IRT and AutoDELFIA IRT kits. The samples were run in
singlicate.

The assumptions of ordinary least squares regression analysis are not fulfilled
in the IRT assay because the standard deviation across the measuring range is
not constant. Therefore, weighted Deming analysis was applied and the
variance ratio (l, lambda) was estimated to be 1 (i.e. the variances of the
methods were considered to be of equal size across the measuring range for
both GSP IRT and AutoDELFIA IRT). The results are shown below:

External studies or Screening performance: These studies were performed in a
U.S. state newborn screening laboratory. The initial total number of acquired
samples was comprised of 2216 routine screening left-over specimens and 20
specimens diagnosed/confirmed positive for CF. However, 3 GSP runs and 3
AutoDELFIA runs were rejected due to unacceptable QC results (total of 255
rejected specimens). Further, additional 36 specimens were rejected due to
the poor quality and missing information. Therefore, the final total number of
samples tested was comprised of 1945 samples (1925 routine screening left-
over specimens + 20 confirmed positive specimens). The specimens were
analyzed in singlicate using both the GSP Neonatal IRT and the AutoDELFIA
Neonatal IRT kits according to the respective package inserts. These studies
were conducted by two laboratory technicians. The confirmed CF positive
specimens were dispersed in a blinded fashion throughout the multiple assay
runs. Three levels of kit controls were run in duplicate at the beginning on
each plate to validate the assay runs for both the tested and the predicate
method. None of the assays were outside the QC acceptance criteria. (See
section 5 below for more information about the IRT cut off values.)
Results of the agreement between the proposed device and the predicate
device are summarized in the tables below:

A regression analysis was performed to compare the GSP Neonatal IRT to the
AutoDELFIA Neonatal IRT method for the external method comparison
study. The assumptions of ordinary least squares regression analysis are not
fulfilled in the assays. Namely, the standard deviation across the measuring
range is not constant. Therefore, weighted Deming regression is more
appropriate regression method and is shown in the table below:
Data Regression Regression 95% confidence

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Specimen Stability Study: This study was performed at Perkin Elmer to
monitor the stability of IRT in DBS previously stated in literature. Samples
were prepared from two heparinized blood specimens obtained from healthy
adult donors. The hematocrit was adjusted to 45% to 55%, four specimens
were aliquoted (two per sample) and one sample from each specimen was
additionally spiked with trypsin. Specimens were spotted onto filter paper,
dried overnight and put at five different storage conditions (i.e., temperature
and humidity levels) with two different sample container options: a) sealed
bags with a desiccant and b) unsealed foil bags without desiccant. Results are
provided in the package insert. The study confirmed that the elevated
temperature and humidity are detrimental to IRT in DBS. Therefore,
specimens stored in ambient temperature (+18 to +25 ˚C) should be analyzed
for IRT within two weeks of collection as IRT levels decrease 6-9% per week.
For longer storage, specimens should be placed in plastic/foil bags with
desiccant(s) and store frozen at -16 to -30 ˚C.

The quantitative determination of human IRT from DBS allows identification of a
population of newborns with elevated IRT who are at an increased risk of having
CF. The identification is based on the use of a cut-off value or a percentile, which
distinguishes between the unaffected and affected individuals.
The screening strategy for CF varies within different laboratories, the most
common being the two-tier strategy IRT/DNA. It is known that IRT values and
the frequency of CF vary according to geographic and local demographics.
Therefore, it is important that each laboratory establishes its own reference range
and cut-off value from a representative sample population. Some laboratories
choose to set the cut-off at the top 1% to 5% 1. Selection of the cut-off percentile
depends on the sensitivity and specificity objectives of the screening program.
Choice of a cut-off e.g. 5% of the daily IRT results increases screening
sensitivity, whereas selection of a cut-off e.g. 1% minimizes the number of
samples referred to second tier testing. More information about cystic fibrosis
screening algorithms can be found in reports by European Cystic Fibrosis Society
2, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation 3, and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention 4.
The positive predictive value of the assay may vary depending on the prevalence
of the disease in the population being tested. The phenomenon of transient (non-
CF) neonatal hypertrypsinemia, predominately occurring in the first few days of
life, is the primary cause of false high IRT screening results. High IRT results
may also occur in neonates with low APGAR scores and in African-American
infants. IRT levels decline with age of specimen collection. The use of a second
level testing, either DNA or repeat IRT on a second specimen, has been shown to
reduce the number of false positives. Healthy carriers of CF mutations may
produce a false positive IRT results at a rate about three times that in the general
population. False negative IRT values are known to occur in some CF newborns
that present with meconium ileus. IRT screening in combination with mutation
analysis as a second-tier test will result in the identification of CF carriers. Follow
local requirements for follow-up testing.

Cut-off values of IRT in DBSs may vary between different tests and different
populations. Therefore, each laboratory should establish its own reference range
and cut-off value from a representative sample population.
