L. Test Principle:
The assay consists of a sample extraction step during which Vitamin D is irreversibly
dissociated from its serum transporter. Extracted samples are then analyzed on a microplate
reader after the sequential addition of three reagents. The assay is based on the principle of
α-complementation of the enzyme β-galactosidase and the competition between an enzyme
donor-25-hydroxy Vitamin D conjugate, Vitamin D binding protein and the 25-hydroxy
Vitamin D content of a serum sample. The 25-hydroxy Vitamin D concentration of a patient
sample is proportional to β-galactosidase activity measured by absorbance at 560 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Study Protocol:
Linearity was evaluated following CLSI guideline EP6-A. Samples were prepared by
diluting a high patient sample with a sample diluent to obtain eleven concentrations
across the measuring range, ranging from 0 to 130 ng/mL. Each sample was assayed in
triplicate. The resulting mean concentrations of each sample were compared to predicted
concentrations and yielded a linear regression of Y=1.021 X + 0.00.
Conclusion:
Based on the results of the linearity study and Limit of detection study, the sponsor
claimed that the assay is linear from 5.9 to 120 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and value assignment:
Calibrators
The master calibrator batch stock was prepared in house gravimetrically in DMSO.
Value assignment of stocks is made by UV absorbance spectrometry calibrated with
NIST SRM 935a, based on NIST recommended molar extinction coefficients. The
DMSO stock of 25-OH Vitamin D3 was used to build calibration levels by dilution
into pooled human serum.
Initial value for calibrators is assigned using the predicate assay. Subsequently, patient
serum samples (at least 20) are tested with the Diazyme 25-OH Vitamin D assay
reagents and calibrators and compared to the values obtained using the predicate
assay. The final calibrators values are then assigned by adjusting their initial values to
meet the following acceptance criteria for the two-method comparison: Slope = 1.0 ±
0.1; r2 ≥ 0.9. Finally, calibrator value assignment was verified by measuring the 25-

OH Vitamin D content of standard control level 1 and standard control level 2,
provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST SRM 972).
Controls
Normal (> 32.0 ng/mL) and Abnormal (< 31.9 ng/mL) 25-OH Vitamin D controls
prepared in human serum are tested with released Diazyme 25-OH Vitamin D microplate
kits, in 12 replicates, in three runs. The mean obtained values are assigned as control
values. The controls are labeled with the assigned values as mean ±25%.
Stability:
• Shelf-life Stability:
Real-time testing at 2-8oC and accelerated testing at 37oC were conducted for the
control materials and the calibrators. The stability study protocol and the acceptance
criteria have been reviewed and found to be acceptable. The predicted shelf-life,
based on results of accelerated testing at 37oC, is at least 12 months at 2-8oC for the
control materials and the calibrators. Real-time stability testing is on-going to support
the predicted shelf-life of 12 months at 2-8oC.
• Open-Vial Stability:
The stability study protocol and the acceptance criteria to determine open-vial
stability of the control materials and the calibrators have been reviewed and found to
be acceptable. Diazyme 25-OH Vitamin D assay reconstituted reagents R1, R2, R3
and thawed calibrators and controls are stable for at least 11 days when stored at 2-
8oC.
• Sample Stability:
Stability of samples stored at different conditions was evaluated. Two sample levels
were prepared by spiking freshly drawn serum or EDTA plasma with 25-OH Vitamin
D. Three aliquots of each sample were processed immediately and analyzed within
one hour of processing. Results from these aliquots were used as the basis for
comparison to samples that were stored for various time periods and at various
storage conditions before processing. Each sample aliquot was measured in
duplicates.
Based on results summarized in the below table, the sponsor made the following
recommendation in the labeling: “the specimens may be refrigerated at 2-8°C for two
weeks. For long term storage, they can be stored at -20°C. Avoid repeated freeze-
thaw cycles.”

d. Detection limit:
For LoB determination, saline supplemented with 9% Bovine Serum Albumin was
measured in three independent runs with 20 replicates per run giving 100 determinations
in total. The LoB is calculated as the mean of the 57th and 58th highest values for the
blanks. The LoB claim is 1.0 ng/mL.
For LoD determination, five low serum samples were measured in 3 independent runs
with 4 replicates per run. The LoD is defined as LoD = LoB + (1.645 * STDEV of Low
samples). The five LoD samples were made by diluting 5 commercial serum samples
1:100 with saline supplemented with 9% Bovine Serum Albumin. The LoD claim is 3.6
ng/mL.
For LoQ determination, five low samples were tested. For each sample, 40 replicates
were obtained from at least 5 independent runs. The level of imprecision used to accept
the LoQ was within 20%. The LoQ claim is 5.9 ng/mL.
The sponsor claimed that the assay has a measuring range from 5.9 to 120 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
• Interference
To determine the level of interference from the substances normally present in serum,
the sponsor spiked each of the substances at different concentrations into each of the
two unaltered patient serum samples (with 18.5 ng/mL and 65.0 ng/mL 25-OH D
levels). The sponsor defines no significant interference as <10 difference between the
spiked and the control samples. The interference substances examined and their
concentrations tested are listed in the following table:
Interference Substances Concentration tested
Ascorbic acid (mM) 1.0 2.5 5.0 10.0
Bilirubin (mg/dL) 10 20 30 40
Bilirubin Conjugated (mg/dL) 10 20 30 40
Hemoglobin (mg/dL) 50 100 250 500
Triglycerides (mg/dL) 250 500 750 1000
The sponsor indicates in the labeling that the assay’s results were not significantly
affected by the presence of the following substances normally present in the serum:

The sponsor states the following in their labeling: “Do not use hemolysed samples.”
• Cross-Reactivity
Study Protocol:
To estimate the cross-reactivity of various Vitamin D metabolites with 25-OH
Vitamin D3, six identical serum aliquots (10 mL) were each spiked with one of the
cross-reactant listed below, to a final concentration of 100 ng/mL. Cross-reactants
stock solutions were made with 100% DMSO. A seventh serum aliquot of 10 mL was
spiked with 100% DMSO (devoid of Vitamin D) and served as a negative control. All
7 spiked sera were then quantified in quadruplicates. % Cross-reactivity was
calculated using the following the equation:
% Cross-reactivity = Recovery of cross-reactant spiked sample x 100
Recovery of 25-OH Vitamin D3 spiked sample
Recovery = Measured Vitamin D concentration from spiked sample – Measured
Vitamin D concentration from negative control
Conclusion:
Based on the results summarized in the below table, the sponsor concluded that the
assay did not significantly cross react with Vitamin D2, Vitamin D3, 1,25-OH
vitamin D3, and 1,25-OH Vitamin D2. The assay recovers both 25-OH Vitamin D3
and 25-OH vitamin D2.

Study Protocol:
To demonstrate comparable performance with the predicate device, a total of 80 serum
samples (individual or pooled patient serum) were obtained from a certified commercial
source and tested on the candidate device and the predicate device. To ensure that the
tested concentrations of 25-OH Vitamin D are distributed across the reportable dynamic
range, 12 samples in the set were spiked with 25-OH Vitamin D stock solution of 25-OH
Vitamin D3.
