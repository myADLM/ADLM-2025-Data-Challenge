The IgX plex™ Celiac Qualitative Assay is an in vitro diagnostic test for the
qualitative detection of the IgA and IgG immunoglobulin classes of anti-tissue
transglutaminase antibody in serum. The test is intended for use in clinical
laboratories as an aid in the diagnosis of celiac disease in conjunction with other
laboratory and clinical findings, and requires the SQiDworks™ Diagnostics
Platform.
2. Indication(s) for use:
See Intended Use above
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
SQiDworks™ Diagnostics Platform
I. Device Description:
The IgX PLEX Celiac Qualitative Assay is supplied as two boxes requiring separate
storage conditions: the Refrigerator Box must be refrigerated at 2-8ºC, and the
Freezer Box must be stored in a -15ºC or lower freezer. A microarray plate and wash
buffer concentrate are stored refrigerated while the Reporter mix, Calibrators,
Positive Control #1, Positive Control #2, Negative Control, and Sample Diluent are
1

--- Page 2 ---
stored frozen. The microarray plate consists of an array of protein and antibody
replicate spots, covalently bound to the surface of coated glass within each well of a
standard 96-well assay plate. All plates have the identical configuration of microarray
elements, containing:
• 21 capture spots for tTg.
• Internal normalization curve and control spots for internal consistency
confirmation.
The outer plate holder is labeled with a barcode indicating the assay type and lot
number which is read by the platform. The reporter mix is comprised of diluted
fluorescently labeled mouse monoclonal antibodies to human immunoglobulin G and
A (marker antibody). Each type of marker antibody is labeled with a dye in a different
spectral range allowing for the detection of both sub-classes in one well. Each signal
is analyzed to provide the end result for each analyte. The system reports each result
independently.
The SQiDworks Diagnostics Platform is a multiplex immunoassay instrument that
fully automates the process of a specific IgX PLEX Assay from serum transfer to
reporting of all assay markers for each individual patient sample. The instrument
automates the entire immunoassay protocol from end-to-end including sample
pipetting, serum dilution, incubation, washing, and drying. Once the assay’s
biochemical reactions have completed, the instrument automatically performs a multi-
color fluorescent scan of each well in the microarray, analyzes the data, and generates
a report containing results for all assay markers. The SQiDworks Diagnostics
Platform also includes numerous internal quality checks and user safety features with
fail-safe and interlock mechanisms.

with fluorescent dye are added as a mix. Excess reporter antibodies are washed away,
and excess wash buffer is removed from the wells. Each well is scanned for each of
two dye wavelengths. The intensity of the generated signal is proportional to the
amount of IgG, and IgA antibodies bound to the printed spots in the wells.
The IgX PLEX™ Celiac Qualitative Assay reports qualitative results for the IgG and
IgA immunoglobulin classes of anti-gliadin and anti-tissue transglutaminase
antibodies separately. Positive and Negative determinations are calculated based on
analyte specific cutoff values, but the internal values for each result are not reported.
Concentrations at or below the cutoff are determined to be negative.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The day-to-day, lot-to-lot, and site-to-site qualitative reproducibility of the
IgX PLEX™ Celiac Qualitative Assay was evaluated. CLSI EP12-A2: “User
Protocol for Evaluation of Qualitative Test Performance” was followed as
closely as possible. In the tables below, ‘agreement’ refers to the percentage
of samples that agreed with the correct (known) result.
A panel of one clear negative, one clear positive, one sample representing
borderline positive and one sample representing borderline negative for each
analyte were used for the day-to-day precision reproducibility analysis.

Site-to-site reproducibility was tested at three sites (SQI Diagnostics and two
clinical laboratories). For each analyte, two celiac positive (PS1 and PS2) and
one negative sample (NS) was tested eight times in a run. Six runs were
performed; three different kit lots were each tested twice. There were a total of
48 possible results per sample per analyte; samples with less than 48 possible
results were due to ‘no calls’ by the instrument.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators: The calibrators are not traceable to any recognized standards.
Master (in-house) calibrators were prepared from celiac positive patient
samples with high titers for anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA and IgG mixed in
appropriately predetermined proportions to yield the desired concentration
level for both analytes. Relative values were assigned based on testing with
predicate systems. The eight standards provided with the kit are traceable to
these master calibrators.
Controls: The positive and negative control samples are derived from human
sera clinically diagnosed as positive and normal respectively. The platform
treats the controls as samples and does not perform any quality assessment
based on the results. Although expected results for each applicable analyte of
each control are provided, each lab is expected to follow their own quality
procedures for assessing controls.
Kit Stability: A real-time stability study of unopened kits is on-going; current
data supports a nine-month shelf life at recommended storage conditions.
Real-time stability studies are continuing. An accelerated stability study
supported an 11 month shelf life. After opening, the kit is stable for the
duration of the run; the directions for use states that a plate with unused wells
from a previous run must never be reused.
Serum sample stability: Serum samples were found stable at room temperature
for 6 hours and for 1 week at 4ºC.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference by normally occurring endogenous substances was assessed. A
normal sample and several celiac disease samples with low or intermediate
levels were evaluated with different levels of endogenous interferents above
physiological ranges. The table below lists the levels (mg/mL) of interferents
where the difference between non-spiked results and spiked results relative is
< ±15%:

The specificity of the antibodies was studied by testing samples from 229
patients with other autoimmune diseases. In data not shown here, the sponsor
demonstrated that the unusual specificity of the SLE and Sjorgen’s Syndrome
(SS) samples might be due to unusual sample handling practices by the
sample vendor; a second study with differently sourced samples demonstrated
no cross reactivity with either assay. The results below combine the results of
both studies. The sponsor included a limitation about potential cross-reactivity
by SLE and SS samples in the directions for use.

f. Assay cut-off:
Samples from 136 Celiac diagnosed patients, 121 normal donors and 40 other
autoimmune diseases (n=297) were collected from commercial sources and
collaborative laboratories and were representative of North American and
European populations. They were tested according to standard assay
procedure in duplicate on separate plates using two lots of assay kits on two
different platforms for the determination of mean values. The CLSI guideline
GP10-A: Assessment of Clinical Accuracy of Laboratory Tests Using Receiver
Operating Characteristics (ROC) Plots and CLSI EP12-A2: User Protocol for
Evaluation of Qualitative Test Performance were followed to calculate the
cut-off (decision limit). Cut-offs were chosen based on the optimum
combination of sensitivity and specificity. The assay cut-offs chosen are: tTg-
IgA 2.8 U/mL and tTg-IgG 4.9 U/mL.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparisons consisted of testing 189 positive celiac patient samples
and 176 presumptively normal samples with the IgX PLEX Celiac Qualitative
Assay and with a commercially available predicate method for each of the
analytes. The celiac patient samples were classified using the following
characteristics: 91 samples from biopsy-confirmed celiac diagnosed patients
(Marsh III criteria; 30 of these 91 were on a gluten free diet), 59 EMA
positive pediatric samples, 27 EMA positive adult samples, and 12 celiac
diagnosed with no information on biopsy or gluten free diet status. There were
three “no-calls” by the instrument for the tTG IgG assay (total sample n =

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and specificity:
The sensitivity and specificity of the IgX PLEX Celiac Qualitative Assay for
both analytes were determined from 628 samples: 70 celiac diagnosed by
Marsh III criteria (biopsy confirmed not on gluten free diet), 102 celiac
diagnosed Endomysial Antibody (EMA) positive (adult and pediatric), 192
presumptively normal samples, 229 samples from other autoimmune diseases,
and 35 other non-celiac samples.
In addition, seven celiac IgA deficient samples were included in the sensitivity
analysis for Anti-tTG-IgG. The resulting clinical sensitivities and specificities
are shown below:
