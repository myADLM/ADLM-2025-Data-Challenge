2. Indication(s) for use:
The Dimension® HB1C assay is an in vitro diagnostic assay for the quantitative
determination of hemoglobin A1c (Hb A1c) in human anticoagulated whole blood
on the Siemens Dimension RxL instrument. Measurements of HbA1c are used for
monitoring long-term glycemic control in individuals with diabetes mellitus.
The HB1C CAL is an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of the
Hemoglobin A1c (HB1C) method on the Dimension® clinical chemistry system.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
The sponsor has the following limitation statements in the labeling:
“Any cause of shortened red cell survival will reduce the exposure of red cells to
glucose with a consequent decrease in HB1C values, e.g. hemolytic anemia or
other hemolytic diseases, pregnancy, recent significant blood loss, etc. Results of
HbA1c are not reliable in patients with chronic blood loss and consequent
variable erythrocyte lifespan.”
“The antibody reagent used in the HB1C method will measure any glycosylated
hemoglobin variants that are glycated at the beta-chain N-terminus and have
epitopes identical to that of HbA1c (amino acid sequence: VAL-HIS-LEU-THR).
This includes HbS, HbG, HbH, Hb Wayne, HbC, HbE, etc. Other
hemoglobinopathies may give incorrect results with this test. Care must be taken
when interpreting any HbA1c result from patients with Hb variants. Abnormal
hemoglobins might affect the half life of the red cells or the in vivo glycation
rates. In these cases, even analytically correct results do not reflect the same level
of glycemic control that would be expected in patients with normal hemoglobin.”
“Glycated HbF (Fetal Hemoglobin), consisting of two alpha and two gamma
chains, is not recognized by the anti-HbA1c antibody. Individuals with elevated
levels of HbF (> 10%), most commonly found in infants and in patients with beta
thalassemia, may produce lower than expected results with this assay.These
samples must be assayed by an alternate method.”

L. Test Principle:
The Dimension® HB1C assay measures both the HbA1c and the total hemoglobin in
each sample, and reports the HbA1c either as % total hemoglobin or as mmol/mol
total hemoglobin. Both measurements are automated.
Hemoglobin A1c Measurement: whole blood is treated with lysing reagent and is
then mixed with the anti-HbA1c antibody in a buffered reagent. The HbA1c in
the sample forms a soluble complex with the anti-HbA1c. A polyhapten reagent
containing multiple HbA1c epitopes is then added to the sample, forming an
insoluble complex with the excess free anti-HbA1c antibody. This antibody-
polyhapten complex is then measured turbidimetrically at 340 nm.

Total Hemoglobin Measurement: whole blood is treated with lysing reagent
which releases and converts the hemoglobin in the cell to a derivative that can be
spectrophotometrically measured at 405 and 700 nm.
Two ratio calculation options are provided to the customer in the package insert. The
first option reports the results in % HbA1c while the second option reports the results
in SI units of mmol/mol total hemoglobin. There are several sub-options the
customer can choose that calculates the % HbA1c in NGSP standardized results or
can convert the mmol/mol results to % HbA1c using the IFCC-NGSP master
equation.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated following CLSI guideline EP6-A. A high HbA1c
sample of human whole blood (18.6% HbA1c /186 mmol/mol) and low
HbA1c sample of whole blood material from a commercial source that
contains a typical hemoglobin concentration and very low HbA1c
concentration were used for this study. Dilutions were prepared from these
two samples to provide various concentrations of HbA1c while maintaining a
relatively constant hemoglobin level. The HbA1c concentrations ranged from
3.6% HbA1c to 16% HbA1c.
Statistical evaluations using linear regression showed that the assay is linear
from 3.6% HbA1c to 16% HbA1c, yielding a linear regression analysis of y =
0.97x – 0.19, r = 1.00.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The assigned HbA1c and total hemoglobin values of the calibrators are
traceable to the NGSP reference method through a correlation study. The
Dimension Hemoglobin A1c assay is certified with the National
Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP). The NGSP certification
expires in one year. See NGSP website for current certification at
http://www.ngsp.org.
The derived result of the ratio (%) from the NGSP correlation is calculated
from the individual quantitative results for total hemoglobin and Hemoglobin
A1c (HbA1c). The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC)
units of mmol/mol are calculated using the Master Equation:

IFCC = (NGSP- 2.15) / 0.092
Two different units are provided to the customers:
NGSP equivalent units (%) and IFCC equivalents units (mmol/mol)
Value Assignment
The initial lot of calibrator materials (master lot) is value assigned through a
correlation study using samples provided by the NGSP with values
determined on the NGSP reference method. Based on the correlation study
with the NGSP Reference method, the total hemoglobin and HbA1c values for
the Master Lot are established. All subsequent lots are value assigned against
the Master Lot.
Stability
The shelf life, freeze-thaw, stress, and open vial stability testing protocols for
the calibrator materials and the acceptance criteria were described and found
to be acceptable. Calibrator materials are stable until expiration date (12
months) when stored at 2-8ºC. After reconstitution, calibrators are stable for 8
hours at room temperature or for 48 hours at 2-8ºC.
Reagent stability protocol and acceptance criteria was also evaluated and
found to be acceptable. Reagents are stable in storage at 2-8ºC for 12 months.
Sample stability was investigated and the protocol and acceptance criteria
were found to be acceptable. Specimens are stated to be stable when stored
for no greater than 3 days at 15 – 25 °C, 7 days at 2 – 8 °C, and 4 months at -
20 °C (freeze only once).
A calibration interval study protocol and acceptance criteria was described
and found to be acceptable. The stated calibration interval is 30 days.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of the blank (LoB) for both Hb and HbA1c was determined from 60
measurements of 5 blank samples (EDTA plasma from 3 healthy individuals
mixed 1:1 with a commercially available whole blood material that contains
normal Hb concentration and very low HbA1c concentration) on 2 separate
Dimension RxL instruments. The LoB was calculated to be 2.6 % HbA1c
(7.0 mmol/mol HbA1c).
The limit of detection (LoD) was determined from 96 measurements from 8
low samples (EDTA whole blood diluted with EDTA plasma) on 2 separate
7

--- Page 8 ---
Dimension RxL instruments. The LoD was calculated to be 3.6 % Hb A1c
(17 mmol/mol Hb A1c).
e. Analytical specificity:
To test for interference by hemoglobin variants, samples were screened and
identified as containing a % of each hemoglobin variant of interest by the
Diabetes Diagnostic Laboratory (DDL) at the University of Missouri. The
HbA1c value was determined by an NGSP recognized reference method.
Two different sets of samples were prepared for each variant study by mixing
a high variant sample with a low/no Hb variant sample. Eight or nine of these
dilution samples were prepared, bringing the total number of samples for the
study to ten or eleven. An expected HbA1c value was assigned to each
sample based on the values determined by an NGSP recognized reference
method for variants HbC, HbD, HbE and HbS, and using the ion-exchange
HPLC for Hb F, and the mixing ratio of high and low samples. The
Dimension® HB1C method was used to assay each sample (n=5). The mean
observed value was compared with the expected % HbA1c for each sample,
and no interference was defined as less than 10% difference in recovery
versus the low/no variant sample. Results for the interference testing of HbC,
HbD, HbE and HbS showed no interference with the proposed assay, however
HbF was shown to have significant interference above 10% HbF.
Studies were performed to assess common endogenous and exogenous substances
that could interfere with the assay. Fifty-five potential interferents, including
bilirubin, cholesterol, creatinine, ibuprofen, triglycerides, and urea, were tested by
spiking into EDTA treated whole blood samples at two HbA1c concentrations.
All percent biases as compared to the control (unspiked sample) were < 10%, and
were deemed to have no significant interference with the assay results.
To test the level of interference of carbamylated, acetylated and labile
hemoglobin, two aliquots from two patient EDTA whole blood specimen pools,
one with a normal HbA1c concentration and one with a high HbA1c
concentration, were treated with urea, acetaldehyde and glucose respectively.
Treated sample aliquots were compared to untreated sample aliquots after
triplicate measurements. All results met the stated acceptance criteria for
significant interference of less than 10% bias between carbamylated, acetylated or
labile hemoglobin samples and their respective control samples.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
8

--- Page 9 ---
Two method comparison studies were performed. The first was a comparison
to the predicate device, Bio-Rad Variant™ II Hemoglobin A1c, and was
performed at a laboratory site. Briefly, 126 fresh, excess, de-identified
EDTA-treated whole blood samples with HbA1c within the range of 4.4 - 15.8
% HbA1c were run in duplicate (data analyzed in singlicate) on the proposed
device and compared to single measurements run on the predicate device.
Testing was performed by a single MT(ASCP) operator with previous training
on the operation of both analyzers.
A second method comparison study was performed versus the Dimension®
HA1C method previously cleared under k011852 which has the same intended
use and measuring principle. The purpose of this second method comparison
was to show good comparison between the proposed new HbA1c assay and
the previously marketed HA1C assay. The comparison study was performed
in-house by technicians who were trained on the operation of the instruments,
using 140 excess de-identified EDTA- treated whole blood samples purchased
from a vendor. Each of the 140 de-identified whole blood samples which
ranged from 5.0 - 14.8 % HbA1c, was assayed in duplicate by each method,
however only the first replicate was included for linear regression analysis.
The results of linear regression analysis are summarized in the table below.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The listed expected normal values for the assay of 4.5 – 6.2 % Hb A1c (24 – 43
mmol/mol) were determined in whole blood specimens from a population of 183
(89 females, 94 males) healthy adults (age 19-84 years) who were included based
upon a normal healthy blood glucose result (exclusion criteria: random glucose of
> 200 mg/dL or a fasting blood glucose of > 126 mg/dL). The labeling states that
each laboratory should check the validity of this reference range and if necessary
establish its own patient population specific reference interval.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
