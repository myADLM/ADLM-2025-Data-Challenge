K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
• Guidance Document on Assayed and Unassayed Quality Control Material, June 7,
2007.
• CLSI EP05-A2: Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative
Measurement Methods, 2nd Edition, 2004.
• CSLI C3-A4: Preparation and Testing of Reagent Water in the Clinical
Laboratory; Approved Guideline. Fourth Edition, Vol.26 No. 22
L. Test Principle:
LA Positive control and the LA Negative control are lyophilized preparations from
human donor with anti-phospholipid antibodies with added buffer and human citrated
platelet poor plasma used to assess the precision and accuracy of Lupus
Anticoagulant (LA) assays performed on the IL Coagulation instrument platform
using HemosIL LA reagents (LA Screen and Confirm).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability was demonstrated by testing within-run and between-run
precision on two lots each of lyophilized controls according to procedures
outlined under CLSI E5-A2 guidelines.
Reproducibility was conducted on two lots of each level of control. A total of
80 samples were run based on two replicates per run for two runs per day over
20 days per instrument over seven instrument platforms.
Precision studies for both controls were run with the designated assays on the
following IL Coagulation instrument platforms:

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected values were based on determined normalized ratios (NR) from the
product inserts for IL LA test assays (LA Screen and LA Confirm) on IL
Coagulation systems [ACL TOP Family, ACL ELITE®/ELITE PRO/8/9/1000,
ACL Futura/ACL Advance/ACL Advance, ACL Classic (100-7000].
Expected values were determined for the LA Positive and Negative controls using
HemosIL LAC Screen and Confirm, and HemosIL Silica Clotting reagents
verified by a control acceptance protocol. The expected values were determined
from LA Negative control (N=288) and Positive control (N=288) studies applied
on three LA assays over four instrument platforms to confirm value assignment:
