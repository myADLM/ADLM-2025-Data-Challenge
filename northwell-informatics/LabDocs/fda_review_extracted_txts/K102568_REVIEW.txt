Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples; Approved
Guideline (EP9-A2)
Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation (EP17-A)
L. Test Principle:
The uric acid assay is a two-part reaction. Uric acid is oxidized to allantoin by
uricase with production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The H2O2 reacts with 4-
aminoantipyrine (4-AAP) and N-(3-sulfopropyl)-3-methoxy-5-methylanaline
(HMMPS) in the presence of peroxidase (POD) to yield a quinoneimine dye. The
resulting change in absorbance at 604 nm is proportional to the uric acid
concentration in the sample. The two-part (R1/R2) configuration of this assay allows
reduction of interference from ascorbic acid by inclusion of ascorbic oxidase in the
R1 portion of the assay.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was performed for 20 days using one lot of reagent, one lot of
calibrators, and one lot of controls following procedures outlined in CLSI
EP5-A2. All testing was performed on the ARCHITECT c8000. Two serum
samples, two serum controls, and two urine controls were tested in replicates
of five, in two runs per day for 8 days (N=80). Results are summarized in the
following tables:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed following the CLSI EP6-A guideline.
Samples were prepared by diluting a high patient sample with a low patient
sample to obtain twelve different concentrations spanning the measuring
range; ranging from 0.00 – 70.00 mg/dL for serum samples and 0.00 – 300.00
mg/dL for urine samples. Each serum and urine sample was tested in
replicates of four using two lots of reagents on one instrument (One
represented lot of reagent result was summarized below). The observed
values were plotted against the expected values and an appropriate line fitted
by standard linear regression. Results were summarized below:
Serum (lot 1) Urine (lot 1)
Correlation (r) 0.9999 0.9996
Slope 0.9920 1.0105
Intercept 0.1677 0.6791
The linearity data support the sponsor’s claim that the measuring range for
serum is 1-33.1 mg/dL, and urine is 5-250 mg/dL
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators were previously cleared- See k103403 for traceability, stability,
and expected value information.

d. Detection limit:
The sponsor conducted a Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and
a Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) study following the CLSI EP-17A guideline.
To determine the limit of blank (LoB), zero level samples were prepared for
serum and urine (4 aliquots each) with testing performed on two instruments,
using two reagent lots, one lot of calibrators, and one lot of controls for a total
of 160 replicates. Four low level serum (target concentrations 0.16, 0.18,
0.20, and 0.22 mg/dL) and four low level urine samples (target concentrations
1.60, 1.80, 2.00, and 2.20 mg/dL) were prepared. The low level samples also
had testing performed on two instruments, using two reagent lots, one lot of
calibrators, and one lot of controls for a total of 40 replicates each. LoQ was
determined based on 5 separate runs over 3 days. LoQ for serum was
determined at 0.22 mg/dL based on an interassay imprecision of ≤18.3%, and
LoQ for urine was 2.20 mg/dL based on an interassay imprecision of ≤6%
Results are summarized in the following tables:
Serum (mg/dL) Urine (mg/dL)
LoB 0.02 0.07
LoD 0.06 0.24
LoQ 0.22 2.20
Sponsor’s claimed measuring range for serum is 1-33.1 mg/dL, and urine is 5-
250 mg/dL
e. Analytical specificity:
A study of common interfering substances was conducted. The results of the
study were evaluated following recommendations by CLSI EP7-A2. Serum
samples were prepared at target uric acid concentrations of 3 and 9 mg/dL.
Urine uric acid samples were prepared at a target concentration of 12.5 mg/dL
and 30 mg/dL. Various concentrations of interfering substances were spiked
into the serum or urine sample pools. The sponsor states that interferences are
considered to be non-significant if the bias between the spiked and non-spiked
samples are within ±10%. Results are summarized in the following tables.

b. Matrix comparison:
For matrix comparison study, matched serum and heparinized plasma samples
were assayed on the ARCHITECT c8000. A total of 20 sample sets of human
specimens were collected in the following blood collection tube types: glass
tube (serum), and plastic tubes – SST tube, lithium heparin, sodium heparin,
and plasma lithium heparin separator. All the results generated from the
plastic tubes (SST tube, lithium heparin, sodium heparin, and plasma lithium
heparin with gel separator) had less than 5% differences when compared to
the glass tube (control).
The sponsor states that their device can be used with serum and the following
anticoagulants:
Lithium heparin, sodium heparin, and plasma lithium heparin with gel
separator
