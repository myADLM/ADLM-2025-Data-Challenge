L. Test Principle:
FIDIS™ Connective 10 is based on the use of distinct uniform size color-coded
microspheres and a bench top flow cytometer interfaced to digital signal processing
hardware and software. A red diode laser beam in the flow cytometer classifies each
set of microspheres on the basis of its unique fluorescence intensity (red to orange)
thus identifying which analyte is being tested. At the same time, a green laser beam
illuminates the external second molecule fluorescence to quantify the reaction related
to each specific analyte.
Each antigen required for the assay is covalently coupled to an individual set of
microspheres through its surface functional groups. The different antigen coupled
microspheres are mixed together, constituting the final microspheres reagent.
The test is performed in a 96 wells blank microplate including a filtering membrane at
the bottom of the wells.

• In the first step, the sample is distributed in each well containing the
microspheres mixture. If this sample contains one or more of the specific
antibodies, they bind to the corresponding antigen(s) on one or more sets of
microspheres.
After incubation, the unbound antibodies are removed by a wash step using a
•
filtration process.
A phycoerythrin labeled anti-human IgG conjugate is then added that binds to
•
the previously bound antibodies.
A final wash step stops the reaction.
•
The reaction is then directly measured by the flow cytometer, which
•
differentiates each set of microspheres according to its fluorescence color
while simultaneously measures the average fluorescence emitted by the
conjugate.
A calibration system permits the determination of the antibody in AU/mL of each
sample by interpolation for each antigenic specificity: SS-A 60kDa, TRIM21 (SS-
A 52kDa), SS-B, Sm, Sm/RNP, Scl-70, Jo-1, ribosomes and centromere (CENP-
B; and the titer in I.U/mL for the dsDNA antigenic specificity.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
For the intra-assay study, six samples for dsDNA, SS-A 60kDa, TRIM21 (SS-
A 52kDa), SS-B, Sm, Sm/RNP, Jo-1, and centromere; and five samples for
Scl-70 and ribosomes were analyzed 10 times (for each specificity) in one run.
For the inter-assay study, the same samples were analyzed in 5 different runs.
The intra-assay CV ranges for Anti-dsDNA, Anti-SS-A 60kDa & Anti-
TRIM21 (SS-A 52kDa), Anti-SS-B, Anti-Sm, Anti-Sm/RNP, Anti-Scl-70,
Anti-Jo-1, Anti- centromere and Anti-ribosomes were: 4-7%; 3-6%; 1-6%; 5-
15%; 2-10%; 3-5%; 2-5%; 3-7%; and 3-9% respectively. The inter-assay CV
ranges on Anti- dsDNA, Anti-SS-A 60kDa & Anti-TRIM21 (SS-A 52kDa),
Anti-SS-B, Anti-Sm, Anti-Sm/RNP, Anti-Scl-70, Anti-Jo-1, Anti- centromere
and Anti-ribosomes were: 5-10%; 4-13%; 7-14%; 6-15%; 3-15%; 6-10%; 4-
11%; 4-11%; and 7-14% % respectively (see table below).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity is not claimed for this assay.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The dsDNA values in the calibrator are established using WHO International
Standard for anti-dsDNA, human code: WO/80. Other calibrators and controls
(positive and negative) were prepared in-house and assigned arbitrary units
per mL (AU/mL) during the development process.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference study: Thirty samples were selected for evaluation of potential
interference and crossreactivity: 2 Cryoglobulinemia, 7 Complement, 1 IgG
monoclonal immunoglobulins, 5 IgM monoclonal immunoglobulins, 8
Rheumatoid Factor, 3 citrated plasmas, 2 hemolyzed samples and 1 Anti-
smooth muscle antibody. Twenty six samples were negative; one of the two
positive Complement sample was positive for dsDNA and other was positive
for SS-A 60kDa, SS-B, Sm, and Sm/RNP; one of the two positive
Rheumatoid factor sample was positive for dsDNA, SS-A 60kDa, TRIM21
(SSA 52kDa), SSB, and Sm/RNP and other was positive for SS-A 60kDa,
and TRIM (SSA 52kDa). To ensure appropriate samples are used in the test,
the package insert states to avoid hemolyzed, lipemic, icteric, or samples with
abnormal concentration of IgG and/ or complement levels, or samples with
rheumatoid factor.
f. Assay cut-off:
See Expected values/ Reference range section.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Since the modifications between the predicate and this new device were
minor, a smaller sample size method comparison study was done to show the
substantial equivalence of this device to the predicate device. The method
comparison between the predicate and new device was performed on the same
group of eighty samples for each of the ten given analytes. The positive,
negative and total percent agreement for each analyte were as follows for:
Anti-dsDNA: 100%, 98.4% and 98.8%; Anti-SS-A60kDa : 100%, 98.2%, and
98.8%; Anti-TRIM21 (SS-A 52kDa): 95.8%, 100%, and 98.8%; Anti-SS-B:

Comparison of manual preparation and the automated CARIS™ System:
The method comparison between the manual preparation and the automated
CARIS™ System was performed on the same group of eighty samples for
each of the ten given analytes. The positive, negative and total percent
agreement for each of the analyte were as follows for Anti-dsDNA: 100%,
98.4% and 98.8%; Anti-SS-A 60kDa: 100%, 98.1%, and 98.8%; Anti-
TRIM21 (SS-A 52kDa): 100%, 98.3%, and 98.8%; Anti-SS-B: 100%, 100%,
and 100%; Anti-Sm: 100%, 98.4%, and 98.8%; Anti-Sm/RNP: 100%, 100%,
and 100%; Anti-Scl-70: 100%, 96.9%, and 97.5%; Anti-Jo-1: 100%, 100%,
100%; Anti-centromere: 100%, 100%, and 100%; and Anti-ribosomes: 100%,
100%, and 100%. Tabulated results are shown below. (Note: All equivocal
results were considered negative)

b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The reported expected ranges were estimated from 2 populations:
50 samples from blood donors
•
48 samples selected from their potential biological interferences and
•
according to WHO standard for dsDNA specificity.
Arbitrary units (AU/mL) <30 30-40 >40
AU/mL AU/mL AU/mL
International units (IU/mL) <30 IU/mL 30-40 IU/mL >40 IU/mL
for Anti-dsDNA
Interpretation Negative Equivocal Positive
The negative thresholds (30 AU/mL or 30 IU/mL correspond to the 97.9th
percentile doe the Anti-dsDNA, Anti-SSA (60 kDa and TRIM21/ 52 kDa), Anti-
Sm/RNP, 99.0% for Anti-centromere and Anti-ribosome, and 100% for Anti-
SSB, Anti-Sm, Anti-Scl-70 and Anti-Jo-I for the populations studies.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
