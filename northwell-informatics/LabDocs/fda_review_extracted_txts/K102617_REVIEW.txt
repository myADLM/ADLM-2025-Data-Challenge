1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
2. Indications(s) for use:
The Audit™ MicroCV™ Cardiac Markers Linearity Set is an assayed quality control
material consisting of five levels human based serum. Each level contains CKMB,
Myoglobin, and Troponin I (TnI) analytes. The five levels demonstrate a linear
relationship to each other for CKMB, Myoglobin, and TnI analytes. When used for
quality control purposes, it is recommended that each laboratory establish its own means
and acceptable ranges and use the values provided only as guides. The product is
intended for use with quantitative assays on analyzers specified in the package insert.
The Audit™ MicroCV™ Cardiac Markers Linearity Set is “For In Vitro Diagnostic Use
Only”.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Siemens Centaur XP Analyzer
I. Device Description:
The Audit™ MicroCV ™ Cardiac Markers Linearity Set Cardiac Markers Linearity Set
MicroCV Cardiac Markers Linearity Set is a 5 level quality control solution set that contains
CKMB, Myoglobin, and TnI analytes as the measurand. It is used to confirm the proper
calibration, linear operating range and reportable range of CKMB, Myoglobin, and TnI
analytes. Level A is near the lower limit level and Level E has concentrations near the upper
limit of instruments. Levels B-D are related by linear dilution of Level A and Level E.
Because this product is of human origin, it should be handled as though capable of
transmitting infectious diseases. Each serum, plasma or whole blood donor unit used in the
preparation of this material was tested by United States Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approved methods and found to be negative for antibodies to HIV and HCV and
nonreactive for HBSAg. Because no test method can offer complete assurance that HIV,
Hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus or other infectious agents are absent, this material
should be handled as though capable of transmitting infectious diseases. This product may
also contain other human source material for which there is no approved test.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was performed by measuring multiple replicates of each analyte on a
Siemens Centaur XP analyzer. The mean concentration values of each level were
plotted (concentration value vs. assigned level) and linear regression values were
obtained.
CKMB: y=56.095x-55.705, R2 =0.9991
Myoglobin: y=188.89x-166.41, R2=.9998
Troponin: y=10.995x-11.297, R2= 0.9973
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The assigned values of Cardiac Markers quality control material are traceable to
an internal standard manufactured using highly purified material.
Stability:
All stability tests were performed with Siemens reagents on a Centaur XP
instrument. Real-time studies are ongoing.
Accelerated Stability: Accelerated stability was performed to predict the product
shelf life. Three vials of each level were stressed at 25° C for 48 days to predict
18 months stability when stored at 2-8° C. Vials were tested according to
“destructive testing.” The accelerated studies are supported by on-going real-time
stability studies. The percent loss is calculated compared to Day Zero values and
the product is considered stable when the loss reported is ≤ 10% loss. The results
showed less than a ± 10% difference from the day zero results. The claimed shelf-
life stability is 18 months when stored at 2-8° C.
Open Vial Stability: Open vial stability was performed to determine the viability
of the product during the course of normal use. Four vials of each level were
reconstituted, stored for five days at 2-8° C and tested using “destructive testing.”

The percent loss is calculated compared to Day Zero values and the product is
considered stable when the loss reported is ≤ 10% loss. The results showed less
than a ± 10% difference from the day zero results. The claimed open vial stability
is 5 days when stored at 2-8° C.
Value Assignment:
Value assignment was performed by one set of reagent for CKMB, Myoglobin
and Troponin I analytes. Each analyte was measured seven times (seven separate
vials) and the mean value of each was used to establish target concentration
values at each level. The instrument (Centaur XP) was calibrated using Siemens
calibrators and the calibration was verified by using Siemens control materials.
