b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed based on the CLSI EP6-A guideline. Eleven levels of
the linearity set were prepared by diluting a serum sample containing 50 μM HCY
with saline. A slope of 1.0 ± 0.1 and R2 of ≥ 0.95 for expected versus obtained
samples were the acceptance criteria. Results are summarized below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The calibrator value assignment includes testing with NIST Standard Reference
Material 1995. The HCY calibrator is prepared by spiking a calculated amount of L-
homecystine stock solution to aqueous solution containing preservative to the target
homocysteine concentration. The manufacturer then uses selected measurement
methods to test and release the production calibrator on specified analyzer. The
production calibrator with the final values is assigned and then used to test library
samples, proficiency library samples and higher order trueness NIST SRM1955
serum controls.
Stability:
The calibrators are tested for shelf life protections with an accelerated stability
protocol. The sponsor places the calibrators at each level in a 37°C incubator and at
5

the indicated time, test them with the current Diazyme HCY reagent and calibrators
for HCY recovery. The acceptance criteria are that the calibrator should be stable for
at least 12 months based on the stress test performance (7 days at 37°C and >1 month
at 25°C) and the recovery should meet or exceed 90% of initial value. The study was
performed on an Olympus AU400 using 2- HCY reagent and 5-point buffered
calibrators. The calibrator did not change more than 10% after 14 days of 37°C stress,
60 days of 25°C in open or closed vial accelerated stability tests. The sponsor states
that the calibrators are stable for 24 months when stored at 2-8°C based on Arrhenius
theory stress models and real-time studies are on-going.
Expected Values:
The sponsor tested the NIST SRM1955 Controls for recovery. They had a within
control range acceptance criteria of 15% or 2 μmol/L for NIST SRM1955 controls.
