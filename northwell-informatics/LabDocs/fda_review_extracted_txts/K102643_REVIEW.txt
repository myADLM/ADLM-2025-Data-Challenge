use as an aid in newborn screening for decreased levels of GALT enzyme activity,
and not for monitoring purposes.
The SPOTCHECK Pro is used for automated sample processing in the application
of in vitro diagnostic assays. Specimens containing patient bodily substances are
introduced and analyzed in microtiter plates using qualitative/quantitative
determination through absorbance measurements.
This device and assays are intended for use by trained, qualified laboratory
personnel.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Specimens producing deficient (presumed positive for galactosemia) or
unexpected responses require confirmation or follow-up testing according to
local, state and federal requirements.
Each laboratory must determine its range of normal and deficient levels of GALT
activity, based on its patient population and analytical variables.
Specimens incompletely dried, exposed to moisture after drying, or exposed to
heat above 50°C may exhibit no GALT activity. This test cannot be used to screen
for galactosemia in patients who have received a transfusion. Filter paper other
than Whatman (formerly S&S®) 903™ or equivalent may not yield equal results.

L. Test Principle:
Four enzyme mediated reactions are employed in the determination of GALT activity
by the SPOTCHECK Neonatal GALT Microplate Reagent Kit. The GALT enzyme
catalyzes the conversion of galactose-1-phosphate to glucose-1- phosphate and
concurrently the conversion of UDP-glucose to UDP-galactose. Then, glucose-1-
phosphate is converted to glucose-6-phosphate catalyzed by the enzyme
phosphoglucomutase. Next, glucose-6-phosphate is oxidized to 6-phosphogluconate
with the concurrent reduction of NADP to NADPH, catalyzed by glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase. Finally, a tetrazolium salt (MTT), catalyzed by diaphorase,
reacts with the NADPH to form the product that is measured to yield GALT activity.

GALT activity is determined by measuring the colored formazan produced by the
addition of the color reagent to the incubated blood/substrate mixture.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run and total precision for the SPOTCHECK® Neonatal GALT
Microplate Reagent Kit were determined by a modified protocol from the
CLSI EP5-A2: Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative
Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline — Second Edition. For each
method (automated and manual), samples at 4 different levels of GALT
activity were analyzed using 16 replicates on 1 run per day for 5 days (2
distinct calibration curves on 2 plates); a total of 80 data points at each level
were collected.

C.V. 7.8% 6.2% 6.7% 6.6%
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The claimed measuring range for the SPOTCHECK® Neonatal GALT
Microplate Reagent Kit is 0.3 – 15.0 U/g Hb based on the Limit of
Quantitation (see d. below) and Linearity studies.
In order to evaluate the linearity of the assay, a blood spot control specimen,
manufactured with deficient GALT (galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase)
activity and a hematocrit of 55% was proportionately mixed with increasing
levels of GALT enzyme to provide 21 concentrations at equally spaced
intervals. Four replicates at each level were analyzed in a single run to provide
data to determine linearity according to CLSI EP6-A: Evaluation of the
Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach;
Approved Guideline.

The absolute values of the differences between each replicate were calculated
for each level, followed by the mean difference. Next, the sum of the squared
differences and its mean were calculated as well as the sum of the squared
percent differences and its mean. Finally, first, second and third order
regressions of the data were performed to evaluate whether any non-linear
terms were significant.

* Does not exceed the limits in the table for the “Students t” distribution at the
95% level. The x3 term is therefore not significant.
The results of the t-test for b (x2 term) on the second order regression analysis
2
show that the x2 term is significant. The t-test for b (x3 term) on the third
3
order regression analysis shows that the x3 term is not significant. There are
no concentrations at which the difference between the actual values and the
predicted second order values exceed the ± 10% goal for percent difference.
Additionally, there are no concentrations where the difference between the
first and second order or the second and third order predicted models exceed
the ± 0.15 U/g Hb goal for absolute difference.
The system is judged to be 2nd order over the claimed measuring range of 0.30
to 15.0 U/g Hb.
Uridyltransferase is inhibited by UDP-galactose, with a K of 0.2 mM, which
i
is the cause of the 2nd order calibration curve and blood spot response.
Samples with values above 15.0 U/g Hb should be reported as > 15.0 U/g Hb.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Value assignment: NADH is used as a calibrator (NADH Stock Standard)
because it mimics the NADPH formed during the reactions as part of the
assay.
For a new lot of NADH stock standard, the spectrophotometric absorbance of
the NADH standard at 340 nm is compared against that of a current accepted
lot. Six replicates of each lot number are used in the testing protocol. The
spectrophotometric response is verified against the analysis of standardized
potassium dichromate solutions. The absorbance of the standardized
potassium dichromate solutions must fall in the ranges stated on the quality
control work instruction document. The average absorbance of both the new
and existing lots of NADH must fall in the range stated on the quality control
work instruction document. The percent relative standard deviation (%RSD)
of the six replicates of each lot of stock standard must be less than 5%. The
relative percent difference (RPD) between the new and existing lot of stock
standard must also be 2% or less. A comparison analysis with the Neonatal
GALT Microplate Reagent Kit is then carried out. The six replicates of each
lot of stock standard are used to prepare standards with an identical value that
falls in the range of the standard curve and run on a microplate using current
lots of GALT substrate and color reagent. A calibration curve is constructed
from both lots according to the instructions in the GALT Kit package insert.
The RPD between the new and existing lots of stock standard must be 2% or
less.

Accelerated and real-time shelf-life stability: Study protocols, preliminary
data and acceptance criteria for shelf-life stability testing were provided for
the SPOTCHECK® Neonatal GALT Microplate Reagent Kit components
(unreconstituted/unprepared) at the recommended storage temperature (+2 -
+8°C for kit reagents and calibrators) and at elevated temperatures (35.5°C for
kit reagents and calibrators) and found to be acceptable. Based on the
accelerated stability data, twenty four months of shelf-life stability at the
recommended storage temperature is claimed for the calibrators and kit
reagents. Real-time studies will continue to confirm and extend the dating.
In-use stability: Study protocols, preliminary data and acceptance criteria for
in-use stability were provided for the SPOTCHECK® Neonatal GALT
Microplate Reagent Kit and found to be acceptable. Once reconstituted or
prepared by the laboratory, calibrators and color reagent can be stored for 14
days at +2 to +8 °C; substrate is stable for 7 days at +2 to +8 °C.
d. Detection limit:
A study was performed to evaluate the Limit of Detection and Limit of
Quantitation of the Astoria-Pacific, Inc. SPOTCHECK® Neonatal GALT
Microplate Reagent Kit test system. The studies were conducted in duplicate
(one using the SPOTCHECK Pro™ automated option, the other manually)
and according to CLSI EP17-A: Protocols for Determination of Limits of
Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline.
Blank NADH standards were analyzed 12 times per plate on 5 separate plates
for a total of 60 blank observations.
Three low GALT activity samples were analyzed 8 times per plate on 10
separate plates for a total of 2401 low-level measurements. Each plate
employed its own distinct calibration curve. Samples with low activity (in the
deficient range) were prepared to simulate neonatal blood and spotted on
Whatman 903A® absorbent filter paper.
The results are expressed as units of GALT enzyme activity per gram of
hemoglobin or U/g Hb. A unit is defined as the quantity of GALT enzyme that
catalyzes the formation of one micromole of UDP-galactose per minute at
37ºC

LoQ (Limit of Quantitation) 0.2 U/g Hb 0.2 U/g Hb
The limit of detection (LoD) for GALT is calculated to be less than 0.2 U/g
Hb (0.186 automated and 0.135 manually) using the guidelines in CLSI EP17-
A protocol and with proportions of false positives (α) less than 0.3% and false
negatives (β) less than 0.3%, based on 300 measurements, consisting of 60
blank and 240 low-level samples; limit of blank (LoB) = 0.08 U/g Hb. The
total error (TE, 3xSD) is less than the goal of 0.2 U/g Hb, assuming that there
is no bias due to the unavailability of standard reference materials. Therefore,
the LoD = LoQ, according to the guidelines in CLSI EP17-A.
In order to establish the LoQ, CLSI EP17-A guidelines recommend using a
functional sensitivity determination when reference data are not attainable.
Precision data was obtained that reveal performance around the LoD. All
samples around 0.2 U/g Hb had %CV less than 20%. However, the LoQ has
been conservatively set to be 0.3 U/g Hb for the automated and manual
method of the kit.
Samples with values below 0.3 U/g Hb should be reported as < 0.3 U/g Hb.
e. Analytical specificity:
Two samples were evaluated: one sample deficient of GALT (galactose-1-
phosphate uridyl transferase) activity and the other with normal GALT
activity. Three pools of blood spots from each sample were created; one with
no added compounds and one with low level of potential interferent and one
with a high level of potential interferent. Eight replicates from each pool were
analyzed. The study was conducted according to CLSI EP7-A2: Interference
Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline – Second Edition.
The overall acceptance criterion was that no potential interferents affected the
results such that a true deficient newborn could possibly be misclassified

(false negative). An increase of 1 U/g Hb from the control would have been
an indication that additional design controls should be considered to ensure
safety and effectiveness. For compounds that did not cause interference, in no
instance was an increase of > 0.3 U/g Hb over the control observed. Lipemia
up to 3270 mg/dL can lower GALT activity results near the cutoff resulting in
a false positive. Protein (albumin and gamma-globulin) up to 6000 mg/dL
may cause minor (<10%) increases in response near the cutoff, but would not
result in a galactosemic patient being classified as normal. Conjugated
bilirubin up to 28.8 mg/dL and unconjugated bilirubin up to 20 mg/dL do not
interfere significantly. Additional hemoglobin at levels below 200 mg/dL does
not interfere significantly.
The drugs sulfamethoxazole (up to 400 μg/mL) and trimethoprim (up to 40
μg/mL) do not cause any significant interference.
Varying hematocrit predictably causes changes in response as GALT resides
in the red blood cells. Mean changes in GALT activity response can be
expected to be +20% for a hematocrit of 65% and -20% for a hematocrit of
45% when compared to a typical neonate hematocrit of 55%.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Internal method comparison of manual method of the Neonatal GALT kit and
the predicate device: Newborn patient dried blood spot samples, dried blood
spot controls manufactured to mimic newborn specimens, as well as dried
specimens consisting of mixed adult blood were analyzed using both the
Astoria-Pacific, Inc. SPOTCHECK Neonatal GALT Microplate Reagent Kit
and the predicate device.
A total of 265 samples were analyzed using singlicate measurements for both
devices. The range of the data was: 1.1 – 14.3 U/g Hb as measured on the
proposed device.
A linear regression analysis of the data yields the following equation:
y = 0.935 x + 0.798
R2 = 0.835
Method comparison of manual method vs. automated SPOTCHECK Pro:
Newborn patient dried blood spot samples, dried blood spot controls
manufactured to mimic newborn specimens, as well as dried specimens
consisting of mixed adult blood were analyzed using both manual processing
and the SPOTCHECK Pro. A total of 204 samples were analyzed using
singlicate measurements for both devices. To reduce sources of error not

Screening study at state public health laboratory: To determine the correlation
of results for neonatal Galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT)
deficiency screening between the predicate device and the Astoria-Pacific,
Inc. SPOTCHECK® Neonatal GALT Microplate Reagent Kit (proposed
device) was assayed on the SPOTCHECK Pro (automated method). 1805
dried blood spot samples were analyzed by two operators, one using the
proposed device and the other using the predicate device. The data was
collected over the course of three winter days in a state newborn screening
laboratory.
Both the predicate and proposed devices were employed to collect data for
1752 neonatal patient samples unclassified for GALT, 6 manufactured blood
spot controls deficient in GALT, 9 retrospective samples from newborns
affected with galactosemia, and 38 samples from non-neonate patients
confirmed galactosemic. GALT-deficient controls were prepared to simulate
neonatal blood and spotted on Whatman 903A® absorbent filter paper; prior
to spotting, human serum and human red blood cells were combined to
approximate a representative neonate hematocrit of 55%. Controls and known
deficient samples were included in the study randomly.

1751 neonatal patient samples tested negative for galactosemia during routine
GALT analysis using the newborn screening laboratory’s implemented
methodology, while one was classified as having partial activity. Cutoff
values (clinical decision levels) for the proposed and predicate devices were
established at both the lower 0.5th and 0.25th percentiles of the GALT results
for each device, respectively. For the purposes of clinical classification,
samples that fall into the category of deficient are presumed positive for
galactosemia and referred for follow-up testing. Samples that are classified as
normal are presumed negative for galactosemia and no follow-up testing is
prescribed.
The data collected for this study is summarized and presented in the following
tables. Numerical results are expressed as units of GALT enzyme activity per
gram of hemoglobin or U/g Hb. A unit is defined as the quantity of GALT
enzyme that catalyzes the formation of one micromole of UDP-galactose per
minute at 37 ºC.

4. Clinical cut-off:
In the labeling the manufacturer recommends that each laboratory must determine
its range of normal, partial, and deficient levels of GALT activity, based on its
population and analytical variables.
The activity of normal samples varies widely, and the activity of all samples
decreases with time under any conditions of storage. Samples showing sufficient
activity can be classified as negative (normal or non-galactosemic). However, the
SPOTCHECK Neonatal GALT Microplate Reagent Kit assay cannot be used to
classify a particular genotype.
Specimens producing deficient (presumed positive for galactosemia) or
unexpected responses require confirmation or follow-up testing according to
local, state and federal requirements.
