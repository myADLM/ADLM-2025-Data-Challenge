L. Test Principle:
AST catalyzes the transfer of amino group from aspartate to oxoglutarate during the
formation of glutamate and oxaloacetate. Oxaloacetate is reduced to malate by malate
dehydrogenase (MHD). During this conversion, an equivalent amount of NADH is oxidized
to NAD. The resulting decrease in absorbance at 340 nm is directly proportional to the
activity of AST in serum.
ISE measurements are based on the potentiometric Nernst Equation principle. Sample is

diluted with a diluent and aspirated into ion-selective electrodes. The measured potential
difference between the reference electrode and the ion specific electrodes is proportional to
the logarithm of the concentration of the measured ions.
The ELITech Selectra ProM is based on the colorimetric principle and Lambert Beer’s law
which relates the absorption of light to the properties of the material through which light is
traveling. Sample that contains the analyte being measured is accurately dispensed into an
optical clear cuvette and mixed with accurately dispensed reagent. The analyte in the sample
will react with the reagent and a change in color will occur. The change in color is directly
proportional to the concentration of the analyte in the sample.

Based on the data, the sponsor claimed the assay’s linearity range is 2.0 to 12.0
mEq/L.
Elitech Chloride System
Linearity across the assay range was determined by testing two pools of patient
serum, one at a low concentration (69.7 U/L) and one at a high concentration (161.2
U/L). The low sample was prepared by diluting the sample pool with saline and the
high sample was prepared by spiking the serum sample pool. The low and high
samples were mixed to produce 9 intermediate samples. All samples were assayed in
triplicate. Data was analyzed using 1st, 2nd and 3rd order least square regressions
according to CLSI EP6-A. The difference in predicted values between the first and
third order model are as follows:
1st order y=9.44x+58.72
2nd order y=0.05x2 + 8.88x + 59.94
3rd order y= -0.03x3+0.58x2+6.18x + 63.20
The sponsor chose the 3rd order regression because it is significant and the results are
shown in the table below:

when stored at 2-8˚C or 4 weeks (when frozen once) at -25˚ and -15˚ C.
Calibrator material is purchased from a commercial vendor (previously cleared under
k033501). The sponsor claimed the following for stability: Elical 2 is stable until the
expiration date printed on the label when stored at 2-8˚C prior to reconstitution. After
reconstitution the stability is 8 hours when stored at 15-25˚C, 2 days at 2-8˚C or 4
weeks (when frozen once) at -25˚and -15˚C. The labeling stated that the Elical 2
should be stored tightly capped and protected from light when not in use.
Value Assignment
Elitrol I and II are value assigned using multiple Vital Scientific PRO M analyzers.
Each sample is tested in triplicate over several days. The target value of Level I and II
are the median of the observed values range. After validation of the target value, a
confidence range (high and low values) is then calculated.
Elical 2 is tested against predetermined values on multiple Vital Scientific PRO M
using the AST reagent and 2 levels of quality control material. The mean analyte
value is calculated and a target value is assigned.
The expected values for the ISE calibrators are determined by analyzing the calibrator
in triplicate on multiple ELITech Clinical System Selectra ProM analyzers over
several days. The target value of the low and high calibrator is the median of the
observed values.
d. Detection limit:
ELITech Clinical Systems AST/GOT 4+1 SL
A detection limit study was evaluated according to CLSI EP-7A. The Limit of Blank
(LoB) was determined by assaying a blank sample 60 times on the Selectra ProM
analyzer. The LoB was determined using the 95% value. The limit of detection
(LoD) was determined by assaying 4 low (1.7 U/L) diluted sample pools 60 times on
the Selectra Pro M analyzer in one day. The LoD was determining using the median
minus the 5th percentile plus the LoB value. The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was
determined by assaying 4 low (5 U/L) diluted sample pools 15 times on the Selectra
Pro M analyzer.
LoB, LoD and LoQ were established using the guideline CSLI. Protocols for

e. Analytical specificity:
Study Design
Testing for interfering substances was based on CSLI EP-7A. Testing was performed
on a minimum of five concentrations for each interfering substance. Samples with
increasing amounts of triglycerides (Intralipid®, Bilirubin, Diatobilirubin, Sodium,
Pyruvate (AST/GOT 4+1SL) Acetylsalicylate (Na+, K+, Cl-), and Ascorbic Acid were
tested in triplicate and compared to the same sample without the interferent.
The sponsor defined non-significant interference as the highest level tested that does
not cause >10% change between the tested samples and the control sample for
AST/GOT 4+1 SL.
The sponsor defined non-significant interference as the highest level tested that does
not cause >2.6% change between the tested sample and the control sample for Na+.
The sponsor defined non-significant interference as the highest level tested that does
not cause >6.2% change between the tested sample and the control sample for K+.
The sponsor defined non-significant interference as the highest level tested that does
not cause >3.9% change between the tested sample and the control sample for Cl-.
AST/GOT 4+1 SL
Highest concentration tested that showed no
significant interference
Triglyceride 614

Barcoding or manual entry
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Samples in sample tubes or sample cups with a tube adaptor are placed into sample tray.
Specimens, calibrators and controls are pipetted by a sample arm into a cuvette rotor. ISE
samples are diluted in a cuvette and aspirated via a dedicated ISE probe. A pump located
on the ISE module pumps the diluted sample from the cuvette into electrodes. A cuvette
blank must be conducted every 24 hours. The cuvette rotor must be replaced every
10,000 tests or when the cuvette blank produces a high standard deviation.
5. Calibration:
On demand calibration. It is recommended to perform a calibration and a quality control
measurement after installing a new or fresh bottle of reagent. It is recommended to
recalibrate ISEs after installing a new vial of ISE reference solution and/or ISE diluent.
ISE calibration is required every 4 hours or when quality control results fall outside the
established range after replacing electrode, and after ISE cleaning maintenance. ISE
calibrators must not be placed on the rotor more than 10 minutes before they are used.
6. Quality Control:
The software contains a quality control program that evaluates control results and
determines if they are within specified acceptable limits.
In the labeling the sponsor recommends that control measurements be assayed daily and
the frequency depends on the test method, quality control materials should be used in
accordance with local, state and/ or federal guidelines.
