4. Panel:
83 Microbiology
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Etest® is a quantitative technique for determination of antimicrobial susceptibility
of both non-fastidious Gram-negative and Gram positive aerobic bacteria such as
Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus and Enterococcus species and
fastidious bacteria, such as anaerobes, N. gonorrhoeae, S. pneumoniae,
Streptococcus and Haemophilus species. The system comprises a predefined
antibiotic gradient which is used to determine the Minimum Inhibitory
Concentration (MIC) in µg/mL of different antimicrobial agents against
microorganisms as tested on agar media using overnight incubation.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Etest® is a quantitative technique for determination of antimicrobial susceptibility
of both non-fastidious Gram-negative and Gram positive aerobic bacteria such as
Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus and Enterococcus species and
fastidious bacteria, such as anaerobes, N. gonorrhoeae, S. pneumoniae,
Streptococcus and Haemophilus species. The system comprises a predefined
antibiotic gradient which is used to determine the Minimum Inhibitory
Concentration (MIC) in µg/mL of different antimicrobial agents against
microorganisms as tested on agar media using overnight incubation.
This 510(k) submission is for Etest® Tobramycin for MIC determination across
concentrations of 0.016 – 256 μg/mL and 0.064 – 1024 μg/mL with S. aureus,
Enterobacteriacea, and P. aeruginosa.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use
4. Special instrument requirements:
Manual readings only
I. Device Description:
Etest® consists of a thin, inert and non-porous plastic strip, 5mm wide and 60 mm
long. One side of the strip carries a two-letter code designating the identity of the
antibiotic and is calibrated with MIC values in terms of µg/mL. A predefined
exponential gradient of the dried and stabilized antibiotic covers a continuous

--- Page 3 ---
concentration range across 15 two-fold dilutions of a conventional MIC method.
The MIC interpretive criteria for tobramycin are as follows:
MIC (µg/mL) Interpretation*
≤ 4 Susceptible (S)
8 Intermediate (I)
≥ 16 Resistant (R)
*S = Susceptible: Attainable levels in blood or tissue on usual usage, including oral
administration when applicable.
I = Intermediate: The intermediate category implies clinical efficacy in body sites
where the drugs are physiologically concentrated (e.g. quinolones and B-lactams
in urine), or when a higher than normal dosage of drug can be used (e.g. B-
lactams). The “intermediate” category also includes a “buffer zone” which
should prevent small, uncontrolled, technical factors from causing major
discrepancies in interpretations, especially for drugs with narrow
pharmacotoxicity margins.
R = Resistant to usually achievable systemic concentrations.

1. Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test

3. CLSI. Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing Approved
Standard, Document M100-S19.
L. Test Principle:
The Etest® gradient technology is based on a combination of the concepts of dilution
and diffusion test methods for susceptibility testing. Etest® directly quantifies
antimicrobial susceptibility in terms of discrete MIC values. When the Etest® strip is
applied to an inoculated agar plate, the antibiotic is immediately released from the
plastic surface into the agar. A predefined, continuous gradient of antibiotic
concentrations is created and maintained directly underneath the strip. After
incubation whereby bacterial growth becomes visible, a symmetrical inhibition ellipse
centered along the strip will be seen. The MIC value in ug/mL is read where the
ellipse edge intersects the strip. Since Etest® generates MIC values which fall
between two-fold dilutions for interpretation; the MIC value read must be recorded to
the next two-fold dilution.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three study sites. Twenty-five
Staphylococcus aureus, 25 Enterobacteriacea, and 25 P. aeruginosa were
tested at each site. Reference method plates were read visually in accordance
with CLSI standard. Reproducibility was calculated as the percent of results
for the combined sites which were within +/- one doubling dilution of the
mode MIC value for all sites.
For the sake of reproducibility calculations, off-scale values are handled in
two ways; “best case” and “worst case” scenarios. Best case calculation for
reproducibility assumes the off-scale result is within one well from the mode

--- Page 5 ---
MIC value. Worst case calculation for reproducibility assuming the off-scale
result is greater than one well from the mode MIC value. There was no off-
scale results with any of the groups of organisms tested in this study. So, only
one value for reproducibility is reported.
Organism Group Etest Concentration Range % Agreement (n/N)
(μg/mL) within +/- dilution
S. aureus 0.16 – 256 98.7 (74/75)
Enterobacteriacea 0.16 – 256 96.0 (72/75)
P. aeruginosa 0.064 – 1024 98.7 (74/75)

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended QC isolates were tested a sufficient number of times with
acceptable results with the reference method. The Etest® results demonstrate
that the system can produce QC results in the recommended range.
Tobramycin quality control data from combined sites is shown below. At least

All QC values were in the expected range.
A 0.5 McFarland was used to prepare inoculum for the reference dilution
method and Etest inoculum. Colony count was performed periodically at each
site to verify that the inoculum density was in the expected CFU/mL.
Inoculum density control for QC organisms ranged between 0.1 X107
CFU/mL and 0.4 X 108 CFU/mL for direct inoculum E-test, between 0.9X107
CFU/mL and 2.1 X107 CFU/mL for the reference agar dilution method and
between 0.1X105 CFU/mL and 1.1 X106 CFU/mL for the reference broth

EA-Essential Agreement CA-Category Agreement R-Resistant isolates.
Essential agreement (EA) is when the Etest® agree with the reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the
reference method. Category agreement (CA) is when the Etest® result interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result
interpretation based on interpretive criteria.
