K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The EliA™ wells are molded cups comparable to excised wells from a microtiter
plate. They are made of polystyrene and are coated with the respective antigen. The
wells are at the same time a holder of the coupled antigen for convenient automation
and a reaction chamber with reaction/washing solution handling based on pipetting to
add and aspiration to remove liquids. The EliA™ RF IgM and IgA wells are coated
with aggregated rabbit IgG. If present in the patient’s specimen, rheumatoid factor
antibodies bind to the antigen. After washing away non-bound antibodies, enzyme-
labeled mouse monoclonal antibodies against human IgM or IgA antibodies (EliA™
IgM Conjugate or EliA™ IgA conjugate, respectively) are added to form an antibody-
conjugate complex. After incubation, non-bound conjugate is washed away and the
bound complex is incubated with a Development Solution. After stopping the
reaction, the fluorescence in the reaction mixture is measured. The fluorescence
intensity is directly proportional to the concentration of specific IgM or IgA
antibodies present in the specimen. Quantitation of RF IgM and IgA antibodies is
determined based on standard curve of fluorescence intensity generated with the
calibrators.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of EliA™ RF IgM or EliA™ RF IgA assay was evaluated with
analyses of six (6) samples across the claimed measuring range of the assay in
six (6) replicates per run using three (3) instruments of each instrument family
member for six (6) runs. The acceptance criteria for intra-assay and inter-
assay precision were <10% CV and <8% CV, respectively. Results of the
studies are shown in the tables below.

The claimed measuring range for EliA™ RF IgA is 0.6 – 214 IU/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The IgM and IgA calibrators are traceable (via an unbroken chain of
calibrations) to the International Reference Preparation (IRP) 67/86 of Human
Serum Immunoglobulins A, G and M from WHO. The EliA™ RF IgM and
EliA™ RF IgA are calibrated against the WHO reference preparation W1066.
Results are given in International Units (IU/mL).
EliA™ RF Positive Controls are prepared from selected pooled human sera.
EliA™ RF Positive Control 100 is used with Phadia 100 and EliA™ RF
Positive Control 250 is used with Phadia 250. The value for each lot of
EliA™ RF Positive Control 100 is assigned with 4 consecutive control assays,
each in 6 replicates. The ranges are calculated as mean ± 3SD. The value for
each lot of EliA™ RF Positive Control 250 is assigned with 2 consecutive
control assays, each in 6 replicates. The ranges are calculated as mean ± 3SD.
Stability: Except for the EliA™ RF IgM wells and EliA™ RF IgA wells, other
components for EliA™ RF IgM and IgA kits have been previously cleared
(k091845 for EliA IgM system and k062787 for EliA IgA system).
Stability of closed EliA™ RF IgM/IgA wells: Accelerated stability studies
were performed for EliA™ RF IgM wells and EliA™ RF IgA wells. One lot
of EliA™ RF IgM wells and one lot of IgA wells in plates were stored at 30°C
(stressed) for 12 weeks. The same lots of EliA™ RF IgM wells and EliA™
RF IgA wells stored at 2-8°C were used as reference. All plates (with lid)
were stored in closed sealed foil bags with desiccant bags. Three positive and
two negative samples were tested in duplicate in one assay run with the

EliA™ RF IgM wells or EliA™ RF IgA wells stored at 30°C after 4, 8 or 12
weeks along with those reference wells stored at 2-8°C. The concentration
(IU/mL) was calculated for each sample at each time point. The results from
accelerated stability study support the shelf life of 36 months for the EliA™
RF IgM wells and EliA™ RF IgA wells.
Stability of open EliA™ RF IgM/IgA wells: The stability of open EliA™ RF
IgM and EliA™ RF IgA wells were also evaluated. The results support the
claim that EliA™ RF IgM wells and IgA wells are stable up to 9 months upon
opening.
Stability for EliA™ RF Positive Controls: The EliA™ RF Positive Control is
packaged in single use vials. An accelerated stability study was conducted to
establish the shelf life of the EliA™ RF Positive Control. One lot of the
EliA™ RF Positive Control was stored at 30°C (stressed) for 8 weeks. The
same lot of positive control stored at 2-8°C was used as reference. The
stressed positive control and the reference positive control were assayed in
duplicate using EliA™ RF IgA and IgM wells and a full calibration curve.
The results support the claim of 24 months stability for EliA™ RF Positive
Control.
Stability for EliA™ IgM and EliA™ IgA calibration curve: Stability of
calibration curves for EliA™ IgM and EliA™ IgA were evaluated. The
results support the claim that the calibration curve can be stored up to 28 days
and a new calibration curve is needed after any curve control failures and
expiry of reagents.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB): Analyte free EliA™ sample diluent was measured 100
times each on EliA™ RF IgM and IgA antigen wells. LoB was estimated as
the 95th percentile of the distribution of the concentrations. LoB for EliA™
RF IgM and EliA™ RF IgA assays are 0.3 IU/mL and 0.4 IU/mL,
respectively.
Limit of Detection (LoD): Five samples with antibody concentrations between
LoB to 4xLoB were each measured 75 times using EliA™RF IgA or RF IgM
antigen wells. LoD was calculated as LoD=LoB+1.645 σ The claimed
LoD.
LoD for EliA™ IgM and EliA™ RF IgA are 0.5 IU/mL and 0.6 IU/mL,
respectively.
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous interference: The study was done to investigate the effect on
results of RF IgM and RF IgA in the presence of endogenous interfering
substances using EliA™ RF IgM and EliA™ RF IgA. Two positive serum
samples with concentration levels around the cut-off and one high positive
serum sample with concentration level around calibrator 5 were spiked with
bilirubin C, bilirubin F, hemoglobin and lipemic factor (LF =ClinOleic; 20%
7

--- Page 8 ---
emulsion of refined olive oil). The same samples spiked with substance
specific vehicles were used as controls. All samples were tested in 3
replicates in two separate runs. No significant interference was noted for
samples containing bilirubin F up to 191 mg/L, bilirubin C up to 216 mg/L,
hemoglobin up to 49.4 mg/L and LF up to 1%.
Hook effect: A high positive sample that had a concentration up to 62 times
above the upper limit of the measuring range of the EliA™ RF IgM assay was
tested on EliA™ RF IgM wells and Cal-1000 was tested on EliA™ IgM
calibrator wells. No hook effect was detected. A high positive sample that
had a concentration up to 10 times above the upper limit of the measuring
range of EliA™ RF IgA assay was tested on EliA™ RF IgA wells, and Cal-80
was used on EliA™ IgA calibrator wells. No hook effect was observed.
f. Assay cut-off:
Based on the results of the expected values/reference range study described
below in Section M.5, the assay cutoffs (IU/mL) were set as follows:
Negative Equivocal Positive
EliA™ RF IgM <3.5 IU/mL 3.5 – 5.0 IU/mL >5.0 IU/mL
EliA™ RF IgA <14 IU/mL 14 – 20 IU/mL >20 IU/mL

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity/Clinical Specificity:
A total of 300 serum samples were collected and tested to establish the
clinical sensitivity and specificity of the EliA™ RF IgM and EliA™ RF IgA
assays. They include 100 samples from patients who had been clinically
defined as suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) based on ACR criteria and
200 disease control samples consisting of 47 samples of systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE), 20 samples of systemic sclerosis, 10 samples of
myositis, 20 samples of Sjögren's Syndrome, 10 samples of undifferentiated
connective tissue disease (UCTD), 8 samples of seronegative
spondyloarthritis, 17 samples of psoriatic arthritis, 20 samples of Morbus
Crohn, 20 samples of colitis ulcerosa, 28 samples of non-inflammatory
rheumatic diseases (osteroarthritis). All of the RA patients received
medications. Clinical sensitivity and specificity were calculated based on the
results from EliA™ RF IgM and EliA™ RF IgA assays and the clinical
diagnosis. 20 Patients with Sjögren's Syndrome and 2 patients with SLE who
were also diagnosed with Sjögren's Syndrome were excluded from calculation
of specificity as they are known to have rheumatoid factor frequently. The
results (n=278) were summarized in the following tables:
