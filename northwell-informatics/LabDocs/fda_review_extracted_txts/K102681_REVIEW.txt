The use of the ADVIA Centaur Toxoplasma IgG assay to diagnose recent infection by
testing acute and convalescent samples is not recommended. The calculated values for
toxoplasma IgG in a given specimen, as determined by assays from different

results reported by the laboratory to the physician must include the identity of the
toxoplasma IgG assay used. Values obtained with different assay methods cannot be used
interchangeably.
This assay has not been cleared or approved by the FDA for the screening of blood or

L. Test Principle:
The ADVIA Centaur Toxoplasma G assay is an immunoglobulin class-capture sandwich
immunoassay using direct, chemiluminescent technology. The anti-human IgG
Fc
monoclonal antibody is covalently coupled to paramagnetic particles in the Solid Phase. In
the Lite Reagent, the purified T. gondii antigen is bound to an anti-p30 monoclonal antibody
(F(ab) fragment) labeled with acridinium ester. Antibody-antigen complexes will form if
2
toxoplasma IgG is present in the sample.
The system automatically performs the following actions:
• Dispenses 10 μL of sample into a cuvette.
• Dispenses 250 μL of Solid Phase and incubates the mixture for 18 minutes at 37°C.
• Separates the Solid Phase from the mixture and aspirates the unbound reagent.

A direct relationship exists between the amount of toxoplasma IgG activity present in the
patient sample and the amount of relative light units (RLUs) detected by the system. A result
of reactive (positive) or nonreactive (negative) is determined using a clinical cutoff value of
10 IU/mL.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision
Assay imprecision (within run and total) of the Toxo G assay was evaluated on ADVIA
Centaur. A 20-day precision study (as per CLSI EP5-A2) was performed using two (2)
reagent pilot lots (Pilot 1 and Pilot 2) with respective calibrators and controls. Samples
included three in-house Medical Decision Pools and two controls (i.e. Negative and
Positive), and two runs per day were performed.
The acceptance criteria, as defined by the sponsor, were as follows:
Within-Run CV:
15 to 30 IU/mL – ≤ 4.0%
50 to 175 IU/mL – ≤ 6.0%
> 250 IU/mL – ≤ 6.0%
Total CV:
15 to 30 IU/mL – ≤ 8.0%
50 to 175 IU/mL – ≤ 10.0%
> 250 IU/mL – ≤ 10.0%

Pilot Lot 1 (Pooled)
n Mean (IU/mL) Within Run CV Total CV
160 28.07 2.6 3.7
160 10.96 3,2 4.1

160 455.3 2.9 3.9
These results met the acceptance criteria and are acceptable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability:
Assay performance was assessed for control recovery of the “Rocked/Pierced”
reagent packs stored on-system relative to day zero recovery. A fresh reagent pack
was used as the control for each time point and it was compared with the
Rocked/Pierced and Rocked/Sealed reagent packs started on Day 0. A lot-specific
Master Curve was used. The study was completed on (2) ADVIA Centaurs. Adjusted
SD (ADSD) is calculated from Total SD (TSD) and Within Run SD (WRSD) from
the precision claims in the IFU. The ADSD is given by the following equation where
n is the number of replicates per run:
Adjusted SD (ADSD) = SQRT {(TSD^2-[(n-1)/n])*WRSD^2}
Acceptance criteria were Positive control recoveries for rocked pierced packs ±10.0%
of Day 0. The minimum targets are 28 days for onboard stability and 14 days for
calibration interval, as is claimed for the current Toxo G assay.
Results were as follows:
Pilot Lot 1 on System AR - All positive control recoveries were within 10% of Day 0
value up to (and including) Day 30, with a 14-day calibration interval
Pilot Lot 2 on System AR - All positive control recoveries were within 10% of Day 0
value up to (and including) Day 30, with a 14-day calibration interval.

These results met the acceptance criteria and are acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
During initial development of the ADVIA Centaur Toxo G (K012183), the clinical
cut-off of the assay was established to be 10 IU/mL. The assay was standardized and
calibrators were value assigned in order to meet this cut-off. The device modifications
did not impact standardization or calibrator value assignments, and did not alter
method parameters (i.e. instructions to the instrument to run assay). Therefore, the
cutoff of the Toxo G assay continues to be 10 IU/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference:
The following substances were spiked into Toxo IgG nonreactive and reactive
specimens:
(cid:131) Human IgG (16 mg/mL)
(cid:131) Human IgG (25 mg/mL)
(cid:131) Low Protein (3.5 g/dL)
(cid:131) High Protein (12 g/dL)
(cid:131) Hemoglobin (500 mg/dL)
(cid:131) Conjugated Bilirubin (40 mg/dL)
(cid:131) Unconjugated Bilirubin (60 mg/dL)
(cid:131) Triglycerides (1000 mg/dL)
Nine samples per interferent were tested for nonreactive specimens, and 27 samples per
interferent were tested for reactive specimens. Testing was performed by measuring
samples with and without spiked interferent, as calculated by the following equation:
% Interference = Spiked/Unspiked X 100%
Testing was performed using Pilot Lot 3 of the revised version of the Toxo G assay, and
Lot 68 of the current assay. For Toxo IgG reactive samples, the current and revised assay
versions were compared by calculating the difference in percent interference using both
methods.
The acceptance criteria were as follows:
Toxo IgG nonreactive samples - No change in interpretation from the current assay.

--- Page 9 ---
Toxo IgG reactive samples - Less than an average of 10% difference between the current
and revised ADVIA Centaur Toxo G assay.

These results met the acceptance criteria and are acceptable.

Cross-Reactivity:
The following cross-reacting samples were tested:
• ANA
• AMA
• HAMA
• RF
Ten samples per cross-reacting substance were tested on one lot of the current Toxo G assay and
three lots of the revised assay. Diagnostic interpretations, based on testing results, were
compared across all lots.

negative, Toxoplasma-specific IgG and IgM positive and Toxoplasma-specific IgG and IgA
positive These specimens have varying reactivity and 70 are positive and 30 negatives. All 100

These results met the acceptance criteria and are acceptable.
Percent Agreement:
The performance of the ADVIA Centaur Toxoplasma G assay was determined by testing a
total of 1804 samples at three U.S. sites. The ADVIA Centaur results were compared to test
results generated on a commercially available, automated toxoplasma IgG EIA. Five hundred
fresh samples and 1304 frozen samples from the mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions of the
United States were used. The samples included the following populations: prenatal
(N = 494), asymptomatic blood donors (N = 418), asymptomatic hospital patients (N = 806),
and 86 patients with confirmed toxoplasma IgG positive status. Positive status was
determined utilizing a commercial EIA method. Of the 1804 specimens tested, 39 were
equivocal by either the ADVIA Centaur or the predicate EIA. Discordant results were found
on 32 specimens, which were further evaluated using other commercially available tests for
toxoplasma IgG.
11

--- Page 12 ---
Positive Percent Agreement:
Using the alternative method, 388 tested positive for toxoplasma IgG antibody. Of the
specimens that tested positive, 12 were equivocal, 363 were positive, and 13 were negative
using the ADVIA Centaur Toxoplasma G assay. The positive percent agreement was 96.5%.
Negative Percent Agreement:
Using the alternative method, 1400 tested negative for toxoplasma IgG antibody. Of the
specimens that tested negative, 11 were equivocal, 19 were positive, and 1370 were negative
using the ADVIA Centaur Toxoplasma G assay. The negative percent agreement was 98.6%.
NOTE: Samples giving equivocal results were not included in the calculation of positive percent
agreement, negative percent agreement, and total percent agreement.
