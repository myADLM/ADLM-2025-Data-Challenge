L. Test Principle:
The ARCHITECT iGentamicin assay is an in vitro chemiluminescent microparticle
immunoassay (CMIA) for the quantitative measurement of gentamicin in human
serum or plasma. Anti-gentamicin coated paramagnetic microparticles, and
gentamicin acridinium-labeled conjugate are combined to create a reaction mixture.
The anti-gentamicin coated microparticles bind to the gentamicin present in the
sample and to the acridinium-labeled conjugate. After washing, pre-trigger and
trigger solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent
reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). An indirect relationship exists
between the amount of gentamicin in the sample and the RLUs detected by the
ARCHITECT iSystem optics.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
Performance was validated on the ARCHITECT i2000 with STAT protocol
SR
capability.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated on two ARCHITECT i2000 instruments using two
SR
lots of reagent, one lot of calibrators, and one lot of commercially available
controls. Serum panels were prepared by spiking USP gentamicin
gravimetrically into human serum resulting in the following gentamicin
concentrations: ≤0.3 µg/mL, 1.0 µg/mL, 4.0 µg/mL, and ≥8.5 µg/mL. A
single calibration per reagent was performed in replicates of two (stored for
the duration of the study) and controls and serum panels were run in three
replicates, twice daily for 20 days. Results are shown below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The claimed measurement range of the ARCHITECT iGentamicin assay is
0.3µg/mL to 10.0 µg/mL
To demonstrate linearity across the assay range, three sets of 11 samples with
expected gentamicin concentrations ranging between 0 µg/mL and 11.21
µg/mL were prepared. The samples were tested in four replicates using one
lot of ARCHITECT iGentamicin reagents and calibrators, and one lot of
commercially available controls on one instrument. Three sample sets were
tested each within a single run. The results were averaged and compared to the
expected concentrations. The individual % differences were calculated and
support the sponsor’s claimed measuring range. A summary of observed vs.

Recovery Study:
A study was conducted to demonstrate that gentamicin spiked into human
serum can be accurately recovered by the ARCHITECT iGentamicin assay.
Twelve normal human specimens were obtained which contained no
detectable amounts of gentamicin. These specimens were spiked with
gentamicin stock solution to create test samples at concentrations of 2.5, 4.0,
6.0, and 8.0 µg/mL. Reference samples were created by spiking the twelve
normal human specimens with diluent at the same volume used to create the
test samples. The test (spiked) and reference (pre-spiked) samples were tested
in four replicates The percent recovery was calculated by the equation:
% Recovery = (Mean Spiked Test Conc. – Mean Pre-Spiked Conc. X100%
Added (Spiked) Analyte Conc.
The mean % recovery was 95.7 and the individual % recovery results ranged
from 91.1 to 99.2. Results are summarized in the following table:

Validation of the manual dilution procedure:
A study was conducted to verify the use of ARCHITECT iMulti-Assay
Manual Diluent as the manual diluent for routine 1:5 dilutions of a sample
tested with the ARCHITECT iGentamicin assay. Twelve serum/plasma
samples were tested in replicates of three. The median % recoveries ranged
between 91% and 109%.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The ARCHITECT iGentamicin calibrators are traceable to United States
Pharmacopeia (USP) gentamicin.
The ARCHITECT iGentamicin Calibrators are prepared by gravimetric
dilution of Gentamicin Reference Standard (USP) into recalcified plasma free
of gentamicin. Each calibrator is tested by Relative Light Units (RLU)
matching against the corresponding primary calibrator. The uncertainty in
value assignments ranged in +/- 0.001 to 0.042 µg/mL.
Calibrator Stability:
The stability of the calibrators was established through real time testing
conducted at multiple time points. For the real time closed vial testing, three
lots of calibrators were stored continuously at 2 to 8 ºC prior to testing at
designated time points. At time point zero, all calibrator bottles were opened
and closed, and then stored at 2-8 ºC for the duration of the study. The serum
panels were stored at -20ºC or colder. Real time studies are on-going and
scheduled to continue for 25 months (with a minimum of 6 months).
Protocols and acceptance criteria were found adequate as presented in the
510(k).
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of
Quantitation (LoQ) were determined based on guidance from CLSI EP17-A.
Limit of Blank and Limit of Detection:

The limit of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) of the Architect
iGentamicin assay were determined based on CLSI Protocol EP17-A. These
evaluations were performed using one blank (N=200) and four low level
gentamicin samples (N=320). Analysis yielded an LoB=0.00 µg/mL and
LoD= 0.05 µg/mL. Two instruments, two lots of reagents, one lot of
calibrators and one lot of controls were used for this study.
Limit of Quantitation:
Five zero-level samples and six samples with gentamicin concentrations (
0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 µg/mL) were tested in five separate runs
over a minimum of 3 days using two reagent lots and two instruments. The
LoQ was determined as the smallest concentration at which the total error was
approximately 15 %. The LoQ was determined to be 0.2 µg/mL.

e. Analytical specificity:
The following compounds were tested for cross-reactivity or interference in
samples containing 0 µg/mL, 2.5 µg/mL, and 7 µg/mL gentamicin.
Test samples were prepared by spiking each drug at the interferent
concentration into each of the three gentamicin samples to yield test samples
with different analyte levels (0, 2.5, 7.0 µg/mL). To compensate for any
dilution effect, reference samples were prepared by adding diluent into human
recalcified plasma that had been spiked with gentamicin to the target
concentrations. The test and reference samples were tested with a minimum
of 17 replicates using one lot of ARCHITECT iGentamicin reagents and
calibrators and one lot of commercially available controls on one
ARCHITECT i2000 instrument. Results are shown below and in the

Cephalexin, Netilmicin, and Sisomicin are included in the Limitations section
of the ARCHITECT iGentamicin package insert as drugs that will yield
falsely elevate values for gentamicin. Although Sagamicin was not available
for testing, it is also included in the Limitations section because it is
structurally similar to gentamicin.
Interference from endogenous compounds was evaluated based on the CLSI
EP7-A2 document. Two levels of gentamicin were tested: 2.5 and 7.0 µg/mL.
The spiked samples were compared to the control samples. Results are
summarized in the following table:

Evaluation of other potentially interfering compounds:
Normal human serum pool and samples containing the clinical conditions
listed below were spiked at two levels of gentamicin (2.5 and 7.0 µg/mL).
Gentamicin concentrations of the spiked samples were compared to the
samples without gentamicin. Results are summarized in the following table:

f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable. This is a quantitative assay.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison was performed based on the CLSI EP9A-2 guideline.
Samples used for the method comparison study were de-identified, leftover
samples obtained from external vendors with gentamicin concentrations
between 0.3 to 10.0 µg/mL. For the ARCHITECT iGentamicin assay, the
specimens were tested using three lots of reagents, one lot of calibrators, and
one lot of commercially available controls and two ARCHITECT i2000
SR
instruments. A total of 146 samples were tested in replicates of two. For the
predicate method, specimens were tested using one lot of reagents, calibrators,
and controls using one AxSYM instrument. Results ranged from 0.31 to 8.82
µg/mL with the ARCHITECT iGentamicin assay and from 0.46 to 9.23
µg/mL with the AxSYM gentamicin assay. Results are summarized in the
table below:

b. Matrix comparison:
A study was conducted to evaluate different anticoagulant tube types that can
be used with the ARCHITECT iGentamicin assay. Twenty sample sets were
collected for this study and a comparison was performed between the control
tube (serum, plastic tube) and each of the blood collection tube types. The
following blood collection tube types were tested : Glass tubes : serum,
sodium EDTA; Plastic tubes : serum, lithium heparin, sodium heparin, and
K2EDTA. Sample sets were spiked with gentamicin stock solution to yield
the following target concentrations : 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0,
9.0 µg/mL. The sample sets were tested on one ARCHITECT i2000
SR
instrument in replicates of four using one lot of reagents, calibrators, and
commercially available controls. The 95% confidence intervals around the
mean % recovery for each tube type fell within 90-110% recovery.
The individual recoveries for each tube type are as follows :

5. Expected values/Reference range:
In the labeling, the sponsor provided values cited from the literature* as follows:
Peak serum levels of gentamicin in the range of 5 to 10 µg/mL are suggested for
optimal therapeutic effectiveness. Sponsor states that trough levels greater than 2
µg/mL have been associated with renal failure in some patients.
