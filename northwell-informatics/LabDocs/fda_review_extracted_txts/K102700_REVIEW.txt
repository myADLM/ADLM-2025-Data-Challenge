a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
TC, TRG and HDL are traceable to the CDC-modified Abell-Kendall reference method
and are CRMLN certified. Glu test have calibration traceability to Aqua Cal from
Beckman Coulter on the Beckman Synchron Analyzer. ALT and AST are traceable to
IFCC reference method.
Value Assignment:
The mean concentration of each analyte is calculated as the average of 64 test results
measured in one day using 8 lots of cassettes on 8 different meters. The upper range is

105% of mean +2 times total error; the lower range is 95% of mean-2 times total error.
Total error is the sum of intra-assay variability (cassette to cassette), inter-assay
variability (cassette lot to cassette lot), and meter variability.
Stability:
The stability study was performed on Alere Cholestech LDX System. The stability
protocol and the acceptance criteria have been reviewed and found to be acceptable.
• Shelf-life stability:
Real-time testing at 2-8oC is on-going to support/justify a shelf life of 9 months.
• Open-vial stability:
Real-time testing at 2-8oC verified the open-vial stability of at least 30 days.
