The CKMB UDR assay is an in vitro diagnostic test used for the kinetic
quantitative determination on Unicel DxC 600 System of the CK-MB isoenzyme
activity of creatine kinase in serum and Li-heparin plasma by inhibition method.
The assay is intended for professional use only. Creatine Kinase (CK) catalyses
the reversible phosphorylation of creatine by ATP. CK is a dimer composed of
two subunits which form three active isoenzymes: BB (CK-1), MB (CK-2), MM
(CK-3). CK-BB isoenzyme only rarely appears in serum.
Elevated CK values are due to muscular damages and associated pathologies. CK
determination, usually performed with CK2 (also called CK-MB), is used for the
diagnosis and follow-up of AMI (acute myocardial infarction) and some muscular
diseases.

L. Test Principle:
Anti CK-M mouse monoclonal antibodies in reagent 1 inhibit the CK-M subunit in
the sample without affecting the CK-B subunits. The CK-B activity is determined by
the CK-NAC method and corresponds to half of the CK-MB activity, where creatine
kinase catalyzes the conversion of creatine phosphate and ADP to creatine and ATP.
ATP then phosphorylates glucose to glucose-6-phosphate in the presence of
hexokinase. Finally, glucose-6-phosphate is oxidized to 6-phosphogluconate,
reducing NADP+ to NADPH in presence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.
The rate of increase in NADPH formed is proportional to the creatine kinase activity
in the specimen and is measured kinetically.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were conducted in accordance with CLSI document EP05-
A2 and by following the sponsor’s pre-approved internal protocols and
acceptance criteria. Within run and total imprecision were calculated using 2
levels of commercial QC material, 8 levels of human serum pools, and 1 level
of spiked human serum pool. Samples were analyzed twice a day in
duplicate, for 10 days, using the Unicel DxC 600 instrument. All results met
the sponsor’s acceptance criterion of CV ≤ 7.5%.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies were conducted following the sponsor’s internal protocol
and acceptance criteria and in accordance with CLSI document EP06-A. Two
pools were used to assess the linearity of the assay. Pool 1 was human serum
spiked with a concentrated solution of CK-MB to obtain a high activity of
650.19 U/L. Pool 2 was a human serum pool. The two pools were diluted to
obtain samples with values ranging from 5.73 to 650.19 U/L. Linearity across
the entire measuring range showed a linear regression analysis that resulted in
a slope of 1.00 and a y-intercept of 0.00 (r²=1.00). All data met the sponsor’s
pre-determined acceptance criteria. The studies support the sponsor’s claimed
measuring range of 9 to 600 U/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
Traceability of the results of both methods against the IFCC Methods was
verified with the Certified Reference Material ERMDA455/ IFCC, based on
preapproved protocol and pre-approved acceptance criteria. The sponsor’s
acceptance criteria are that the percent recovery against the Certified Target
value of the ERM-DA455/IFCC must be from 92% to 108%, which is equivalent
to the uncertainty of the ERM-DA455/IFCC certified value (± 4 U/L) by factor 2.
Expected Values
A reagent handling study was performed to asses the risk in case of improper
handling, by switching reagent 1 with reagent 2 in the Unicel cartridge
compartments. Two samples were tested with 5 lots of reagents under these
conditions and the result in every case was an error message on the
instrument, demonstrating that improper reagent handling will prevent the
release of reportable results.
d. Detection limit:
A limit of blank (LoB) study was conducted where analyte-free saline was
assayed 20 times each on three separate analytical runs using the Unicel DxC
600 analyzers. LoB, or analytical sensitivity claim, was calculated as the
absolute mean plus 3 standard deviations. The LoB of 2.23 U/L obtained
from this study met the sponsor’s acceptance criterion of ≤ 3 U/L (the

analytical sensitivity claim of the predicate device).
A limit of quantitation (LOQ) study was conducted by serially diluting a pool
of human sera (approximately 30 U/L) and analyzing each dilution in 10
replicates. The mean, SD, CV%, absolute bias, and total error was calculated
for each sample. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion was a % total error of ≤
24.1%. The resulting LOQ was 7.4 U/L. The sponsor’s claimed measuring
range for the assay is 9 – 600 U/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Common endogenous interfering substances were evaluated in accordance
with CLSI Guideline EP7-A2. Human serum samples at approximate CK-MB
concentrations of 25 U/L and 45 U/L were spiked with various concentrations
of interferents and evaluated in triplicate at each interferent level. Absolute
bias was calculated at each concentration level as compared with non-spiked
human serum. Acceptance criterion was given as an absolute bias of ±2.4 U/L
(±10% at the clinical decision level of 24 U/L). The results for the 25 U/L
CK-MB samples and the 45 U/L CK-MB samples are shown in the table
below. Interference from hemoglobin was not found at 40 mg/dL, however
significant interference was found at 50 mg/dL hemoglobin. The sponsor has
notified users in their package insert to not use hemolyzed samples as
hemoglobin > 40 mg/dL interferes with the test.

regression analysis and Bland-Altman bias analysis was performed for results
comparison. The sponsor’s stated acceptance criteria were a linear regression
slope between 0.95 and 1.05, and a correlation coefficient (Pearson) r > 0.975.
Sample results ranged from 9.0 to 599.2 U/L, and linear regression analysis
generated a slope of 0.96 with a y-intercept of 2.16 and a correlation
coefficient of 0.998. The Bland-Altman calculated average bias ranged from -
10.11 to 11.14 U/L.
b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study between serum and lithium heparin plasma
samples was conducted using serum as reference, in accordance with CLSI
Document EP9-A2. The study was performed on 52 matched patient samples.
The slope, intercept and correlation coefficient were calculated by linear
regression, and a Bland-Altman bias analysis was performed. Acceptance
criteria were a slope between 0.95 and 1.05, and a correlation coefficient
(Pearson) r > 0.975. The samples ranged from 9 to 582.1 U/L. The resulting
equation was y= 0.95x + 0.62 with a correlation coefficient of 1.000.
The compatibility of different collection tubes used for blood sample
collection was evaluated using five sample pools assayed in replicates of 5.
The absolute bias was calculated for each tube type as compared to the non-
anticoagulated serum baseline specimen. Acceptance criterion was given as
an absolute bias of ±2.4 U/L (±10% at the clinical decision level of 24 U/L).
Both the Lithium Heparin PST (Gel barrier) tube and the SST (Gel barrier)
Serum tube generated results within the acceptance criterion when compared
to the serum baseline sample results.
