NucliSENS EasyQ® Analyzer
NucliSENS EasyQ® Incubator II
NucliSENS EasyQ® Director Software 2.6
I. Device Description:
The NucliSENS EasyQ® MRSA assay kit contains reagents (nucleic acid primers,
fluorescent probes, enzymes, buffers and other reagents), controls, software,
accessories, and labeling (Instructions for Use) designed for use with the NucliSENS
EasyQ System. The NucliSENS EasyQ System consists of NucliSENS EasyQ
System instruments and software (NucliSENS EasyQ® Analyzer, NucliSENS EasyQ®
Director software, and NucliSENS EasyQ® Incubator).
For the EasyQ MRSA assay kit, the indicated specimen is a nasal swab, collected
using Copan nylon flocked swab. After transport to the laboratory in a dry collection
tube, the swab is manually processed for lysis of cells and extraction of nucleic acids
using lysis tubes provided in the EasyQ MRSA assay kit, in conjunction with a vortex
instrument fitted with a specified vortex plate adaptor to accommodate the lysis tubes.
The specimen lysates and controls serve as template material for the subsequent
amplification reaction in the EasyQ System.
The NucliSENS EasyQ system is indicated for use solely for nucleic acid sequence-
based amplification (NASBA) assays. Following specimen processing and nucleic
acid extraction, an operator manually prepares amplification reactions, including a
key semi-automated incubation step in the EasyQ Incubator.
Automated amplification and detection are performed simultaneously in a dedicated
fluorescent reader, the NucliSENS EasyQ Analyzer. The Analyzer is attached to a
computer, monitor, and printer. Amplification is detected by means of sequence-
specific probes which each fluoresce upon binding of the probe to its target. Result
calculation and reporting is performed automatically via dedicated operator software
(NucliSENS EasyQ Director Software, in combination with assay-specific “assay
protocols” provided on a CD-ROM in the reagent kit.) Results are based on the
analysis of fluorescence signal curves measured by the NucliSENS EasyQ®
Analyzer.
For the EasyQ MRSA assay, results of the Director Software analysis for each test are
provided to users as 1 of 3 possible qualitative results for each test specimen: MRSA
positive, MRSA negative, or invalid. Control tests yield qualitative output of valid or
invalid.
3

--- Page 4 ---
The EasyQ MRSA kit includes 2 external controls: a blank control and a positive
control to perform quality control for the amplification and detection portions of the
test. The Instructions for Use also recommend use of specimen positive control
(MRSA) and specimen negative control (MSSA) strains, which have been validated
for use with the EasyQ MRSA test, to provide quality control for the specimen
sample preparation processing steps of the test. Operators are instructed to invalidate
all tests in a run if any control in the run yields an invalid result.
The NucliSENS EasyQ® MRSA is developed for amplification of two targets
simultaneously: the SCCmec cassette junction and the mecA gene. The NucliSENS
EasyQ® MRSA will report a MRSA positive result only if both targets, the SCCmec
cassette junction and the mecA gene, are detected, thus reducing the risk of false
positive detection for “mecA dropout”- methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus
strains that lost the mecA gene but still harbor the cassette junction. Primers and
beacons in the kit are complementary to the SCCmec cassette junction sequences of
MREJ types i-v, vii, and xii.

L. Test Principle:
The NucliSENS EasyQ® MRSA assay includes extraction, amplification and
detection of MRSA DNA. Essential processes of the assay are the release of the
MRSA-specific nucleic acids, NASBA™ and generation of fluorescence signals
during the course of the reaction.
For fluorescence-based detection, specific molecular beacons are added to the
NASBA™ reaction. These can instantaneously bind to the complementary single-
stranded RNA amplicons that are generated in the amplification process. In DNA
NASBA™, the bacterial DNA is first digested with a restriction enzyme and then
copies of RNA derived from a target DNA sequence are manifold multiplied by
isothermal amplification by the combined activities of 3 enzymes: Avian
Myeloblastosis Virus Reverse Transcriptase (AMV-RT), Bacteriophage T7 RNA
Polymerase (T7 RNA Pol), and RNase H, along with both ribo- and deoxyribo-
nucleotides (rNTPs and dNTPs) and the cofactors dithiothreitol (DTT), MgCl2, KCl
and DMSO. To start the DNA NASBA™ process, the restriction enzyme Hae III
cuts the target DNA near the binding site of primer 1 (P1). Afterwards, the reaction
mixture is heated to 95°C to denature the linearised DNA and to inactivate the
restriction enzyme Subsequently, the reaction mixture is cooled down to 41°C and the
primer P1 anneals to the positive strand of the target DNA. This starts the “linear
phase” of the NASBA™ reaction where double-stranded DNA amplicons with a T7
promoter tail are generated. In the cyclic phase of the NASBA™ reaction, the T7
promoter tail on the cDNA target amplicon serves as a binding site for T7 RNA Pol,
7

[Table 1 on page 7]
System Component	NucliSENS EasyQ® MRSA	NucliSENS EasyQ Instrumentation and
software (k093383)	

--- Page 8 ---
which then transcribes from the cDNA amplicon using rNTP’s to generate a negative
strand RNA copy. A single original positive strand target sequence (with T7 tail
applied) will serve as a template for multiple RNA copies as the reaction proceeds.
Molecular beacons are hairpin structure-forming single-stranded oligonucleotides
labeled at one end with a fluorescent dye named the fluorophore and at the other end
with a quencher. In the absence of complementary target amplicons, the hairpin
structure closes, bringing the fluorophore and quencher into close proximity, and as a
result no fluorescent signal is emitted.
In the presence of target amplicons, the beacon hybridizes to its complementary target
instead of forming an internal hairpin structure. Once the beacon opens the quencher
and fluorophore separate, quenching ceases and fluorescence is emitted.
Internal Control DNA is used to monitor nucleic acid amplification. Primer binding
sites on the Internal Control DNA and MRSA DNA are identical, whereas differently
labeled molecular beacons are used for the detection of the different kinds of
amplicons.
Reactions are performed in closed tubes in a NucliSENS EasyQ® Analyzer in which
fluorescence is continuously measured. NucliSENS EasyQ® Director Software, in
combination with NucliSENS EasyQ® MRSA assay protocols software, provides
automated analysis of the resulting fluorescence curves and reporting of assay results.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision and reproducibility studies were performed on the complete
assay procedure from the swab specimen to the final result. Two lots of
NASBA reagents were used for both the within- and between-laboratory
precision studies. A frozen pool of nasal clinical swabs was used to avoid any
variability due to the use of individual clinical matrix.
A panel of 3 bacterial inputs was tested on each of 12 days, using the first lot
of reagents for the first 6 days and the second lot of reagents for the last 6
days. The study involved 2 operators who each performed one run per day.
Two different instruments were used. The table below demonstrated the
summary of the precision studies. The data was acceptable.
8

--- Page 9 ---
Within-Laboratory Variation
The between-laboratory reproducibility study was performed at 3 sites, over six
days with two operators, one instrument at each site and two lots of reagent. A
panel of 3 bacterial inputs was tested at each laboratory on each of 6 days, 3 days
with one reagent lot and 3 days with a second reagent lot. The study involved 2
operators who each performed one run per day. Three different instruments were
used (one instrument per site), with the following results:

(cid:131) An internal Inhibition Control (IC) - An internal control plasmid is
incorporated in each reaction tube to detect inhibition to ensure
proper reporting of an individual specimen
(cid:131) Two external controls
One NASBA positive control to detect NASBA™ reagents and
instrument failures
One NASBA blank control to detect contamination with strains of
MRSA or DNA and contamination due to carryover of amplicons
specimen controls (MRSA and MSSA)
(cid:131) Two specimen processing controls:
One specimen positive control by rotating one of the six specified
MRSA strains of different MREJ types (ii, iii, iv, v, vii and xii)
into each run to check for integrity of lysis and NASBA™ reagents
and absence of instrument failure
One specimen negative control (MSSA ATCC 29213) to detect
contamination with strains of MRSA or DNA and contamination
due to carry-over of amplicons in the lysis and NASBA™ reagents
or in the environment
The total valid run rate was 90% (114/127); there were 13 invalid runs; 11
(84.6%) were due to specimen negative control (SNC) failure.
Specimen Controls (SPC and SNC) Stability Study
The stability study was performed using one type of SPC (MRSA MREJ type ii)
and the SNC (MSSA strain). The use of one SPC only to verify the stability of the
different MREJ types was accepted since the MREJ type represents the sequence
of the right part of the SCCmec cassette, which is not linked to any phenotypic
characteristics that could have an impact on the stability of MRSA. Moreover,
MRSA MREJ type ii is the strain most frequently isolated in clinical practice.
This was confirmed after sequencing the MRSA strains obtained during the
European clinical trials of the NucliSENS EasyQ MRSA test, 87 % of the 171
MRSA strains isolated were MREJ type ii.
Based on qualitative results, SPC (MRSA MREJ type ii) and SNC (MSSA),
prepared in mucin, were shown stable up to 6 months, when frozen at -19°C /-
31°C.
Reagent Stability Study
NASBA Reagent
Real-time stability data were provided from a study in real time on 3 NASBA
reagent lots (PTB7, PVB1 and PVB2) produced in manufacturing conditions for a
period of 19 months when stored at 2-8°C, testing MREJ wild type (WT)
11

plasmids corresponding to MREJ types ii, iii, iv, v, vii and xii, each plasmid is
also associated with mecA WT plasmid. NASBA reagents included the NASBA
controls: positive control (PC), external blank control (BLK), are stable for at
least 19 months when stored at 2/8ºC.
In-use and multiple use combined stabilities:
• All reconstituted spheres are still functional within 2 weeks after first use
and one (reagent and restriction enzyme spheres, enzyme sphere) or two
freeze-thawing cycles (positive control sphere) upon storage at – 19 / -
31°C
• Reconstituted sphere (reagent and restriction enzyme spheres, enzyme
sphere and positive control sphere) are still functional within 30 minutes at
room temperature.
• Six openings for the diluents (reagent and enzyme) and 16 openings for
the NASBA water were performed on 6 non consecutive days separated
by 12 days +/- 2 days to cover a total period of 2 months when stored at 2-
8°C
MRSA Lysis Tubes
The study was conducted on three batches, stored at 2/8ºC after thermal shocks.

An additional study was conducted to compare the new pre-marked lysis tube to the
former unmarked lysis tube. The study demonstrated that the unmarked tube were 85%
positive results and the new pre-marked tubes were 90% positive when testing at slightly
lower than the LoD (191 CFU/swab).

d. Detection limit:
Limit of Detection Study
The analytical sensitivity of the NucliSENS EasyQ® MRSA assay was
determined using various strains of MRSA representing the seven types of
MREJ detected by the test (MREJ types i, ii, iii, iv, v, vii and xii) using frozen
matrices of clinical swabs. Bacterial suspensions with a bacterial input
ranging roughly from 10 to 1000 CFU per swab were tested in 24 replicates of
each input using a single lot of reagent. The limit of detection was estimated
as the input corresponding to the 95% Hit Rate predicted by statistical analysis
using a statistical regression model (Probit). The estimated type-specific LoDs
were then confirmed on two reagent lots with 15 replicates each.
The claimed type-specific LoD summarized in the following table
corresponds to the higher concentrations claimed from these two studies, i.e.
either real input determined by plating and counting bacteria colony forming
units in the confirmation study, or predicted concentrations by the probit
regression model.

Analytical Inclusivity
A total of 193 well characterized MRSA isolates were tested at an input level
of approximately 3 times the LoD, in the presence of frozen specimen matrix
from nasal swab specimens previously shown to be MRSA negative, using the
NucliSENS EasyQ® MRSA assay, in the Inclusivity Study. The strains
included pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) types: USA100, 200, 300,
400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 1000, and 1100. Nine were not detected, resulted a
detection rate of 95.3% (184/193). Three of the undetected strains were
MREJ type iii.
Ten heterogeneous oxacillin resistant strains were tested with acceptable
results.
Six "empty cassette” variants (i.e. mecA dropouts) were tested with mecA
gene negative clinical matrices at both input levels of 7.5 x 106 CFU/swab and
1.0 x 104 CFU/swab. They all gave a positive signal for the cassette junction
target and a negative signal for the mecA gene target, leading to a MRSA
negative result. However, the risk of false positive results exists with swabs
that possess the mecA gene (e.g. carried by methicillin/oxacillin resistant
coagulase negative Staphylococci) and MSSA mecA drop-out strains.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross Reactivity
A total of 100 phylogenetically related S. aureus and members of the nasal
commensal flora were tested at an input of 7.5 x 106 CFU/swab. There were
26 methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci (MRCN), 29
methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci (MSCN), 25
methicillin-sensitive coagulase-positive staphylococci (MSCP) of which 20
were MSSA, and 5 were S. intermedius; 20 organisms other than
Staphylococci belonging to the nasal commensal flora ( 1 Gram-positive rods,

An additional study was conducted on eight well characterized K. pneumoniae
subsp. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae with mecA gene negative
clinical matrices at both input levels of 7.5 x 106 CFU/swab and 1.0 x 104
CFU/swab. Results demonstrated that at an input level of 7.5 x 106
CFU/swab, the 8 strains showed a positive signal for the cassette junction
target and a negative signal for the mecA target. When tested at an input level
of 1.0 x 104 CFU/swab, the eight strains showed a negative signal for both
targets. Therefore, the risk of false positive results exists with swabs that
possess the mecA gene (e.g. carried by methicillin resistant coagulase negative
Staphylococci in the clinical sample) with K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae,
K. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae due to a positive signal for the cassette
junction target at a high input of 7.5 x 106 CFU/swab.
Biological Interference Study
To assess whether the NucliSENS EasyQ® MRSA assay could be affected by
the presence of other microorganisms that are normal nasal flora (biological
interference), an analytical study was carried out to test potential biological
interference on both MRSA positive swabs, as well as on MRSA negative
swabs using frozen matrices of clinical swabs.
To determine the potential interference of common nasal microorganisms on
MRSA positive swabs, dry flocked swabs were spiked with a strain of MRSA
at 3 times the LoD and with an excess of a potential interfering
microorganism (approximately 106 CFU/swab). A control test was performed
without interfering microorganisms using dry flocked swabs spiked with
MRSA only and had to be MRSA positive validate the experiment.
To determine the potential interference of common nasal microorganisms on
MRSA negative swabs, dry flocked swabs were spiked with an excess of the
potentially interfering microorganism. A control test was performed without
interfering microorganisms using dry flocked swabs spiked with sterile water
only and had to be MRSA negative to validate the experiment.
The spiked flocked swabs were then introduced into the lysis tubes containing
a thawed matrix of MRSA negative swabs and then submitted to the sample
preparation and NASBA amplification
Each type of spiked swab was tested in four replicates.
Two different MRSA strains (MREJ types ii and iv) were used in the study:
• MRSA MREJ type ii was used because it is the most frequently isolated
strain in clinical practice (as confirmed by sequencing of the MRSA
strains obtained during the European clinical trials for the NucliSENS
16

--- Page 17 ---
EasyQ MRSA test, 87 % of the 171 MRSA strains isolated were MREJ
type ii).
• MRSA MREJ type iv was used because the Internal control (IC) is also a
type iv and competes with this target for the primers. Therefore, MREJ
iv strain is expected to be more susceptible to the potential effect of
biological interference than any other MREJ type.
Three strains were used as potentially interfering microorganisms in this
study:
• Methicillin Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA)
• Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE)
• Methicillin Sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE)
The targeted input for the MRSA strains was 3 times the LoD for both type ii and
type iv. The real input on the swab was determined by plate counting of the
suspension used to spike the swab.
For both the MREJ type ii and the MREJ type iv spiked swabs, the 4 replicates all
gave “MRSA positive” results in the presence of the interfering microorganisms
(MSSA, MRSE or MSSE). For the negative swabs, the 4 replicates all gave
“MRSA negative” results in the presence of the interfering microorganisms
(MSSA, MRSE or MSSE).
Chemical Interference Study
To assess whether the NucliSENS EasyQ® MRSA assay could be affected by the
presence of well identified chemical substances, which can be naturally present in
the nasal cavity or can be artificially introduced into the nose, an analytical study
was carried out to test potential chemical interference on both MRSA positive
swabs, as well as on MRSA negative swabs using frozen matrices of clinical
swabs.
To determine the potential chemical interference on MRSA positive swabs, dry
flocked swabs were spiked with a strain of MRSA at 3 times the LoD and with an
excess of a potential interfering chemical substance (50 ul). A control test was
performed without interfering chemical substance using dry flocked swabs spiked
with MRSA only and had to be MRSA positive validate the experiment.
The spiked flocked swabs were then introduced into the lysis tubes containing a
thawed matrix of MRSA negative swabs and then submitted to the sample
preparation and NASBA amplification. Each type of spiked swab was tested in 4
replicates. If a chemical substance yielded 1) invalid results or false negative
results for the swabs spiked with MRSA or 2) invalid results for the swabs
without MRSA, then 20 additional replicates were performed to confirm the
initial results.

Two different MRSA strains (MREJ types ii and iv) were used in the study:
• MRSA MREJ type ii was used because it is the most frequently isolated strain
in clinical practice (as confirmed by sequencing of the MRSA strains obtained
during the European clinical trials for the NucliSENS EasyQ MRSA test, 87
% of the 171 MRSA strains isolated were MREJ type ii).
• MRSA MREJ type iv was used because the Internal control (IC) is also a type
iv and competes with this target for the primers. Therefore, MREJ iv strain is
expected to be more susceptible to the potential effect of biological
interference than any other MREJ type.
The following naturally or artificially introduced chemical substances were tested
in the study:
• Whole blood at different levels
• Mucus (using mucin)
• Astelin (azelastine HCl) antihistamine nasal spray
• Nasonex (mometasone furoate), steroidal nasal spray
• Nasacort (acetonide triamcinolone), glucocorticoid nasal spray
• Vicks Sinex (oxymetazoline HCl), topical decongestants nasal spray
• Neo-Synephrine (phenylephrine HCl 1.0%), decongestant nasal spray
• Sino Fresh (eucalyptus globulus, kalium bichromicum), antiseptic
homeopathic nasal
spray
• NasalCrom (cromolyn sodium), antiallergic nasal spray
• Zicam cold remedy (zincum gluconicum), homeopathic nasal spray
The targeted input for the MRSA strains was 3 times the LoD for both MREJ type
ii and MREJ type iv. The real input on the swab was determined by plate counting
of the suspension used to spike the swab.
Five chemical substances were found to be interferents: Astelin, Sino Fresh, Nasal
chrom, Zicam and Blood (15 and 50 μl).
Carry-Over Contamination
Carryover study was performed to access the carry-over risk of the NucliSENS
EasyQ MRSA assay during sample preparation and amplification/detection. Five
NucliSENS EasyQ MRSA NASBA runs were performed on MRSA high positive
(positive for both the cassette junction and mecA) and MRSA negative specimen
(negative for both the cassette junction and mecA) in an alternating pattern, resulting
in a total of 105 MRSA high positive samples and 105 MRSA negative samples.
This study was performed using frozen matrices of clinical swabs. In order to obtain
MRSA high positive specimen, lysis tubes containing a matrix of MRSA negative
clinical swabs were spiked with a high concentration of MRSA MREJ type ii (5x106
CFU/lysis tube). In order to obtain MRSA negative specimen, lysis tubes containing
18

--- Page 19 ---
a matrix of MRSA negative clinical swabs, that were proven to be negative for the
cassette and mecA, were spiked with sterile water.
All 105 replicates of the MRSA high positive sample were tested MRSA positive.
All 103 out of 103 valid replicates of the MRSA negative sample were tested MRSA
negative (negative for both the cassette and mecA). Two MRSA negative replicates
were tested “invalid” due to failure of detecting IC. No cross-over contamination was
observed amongst the 103 negative samples surrounded by high positive samples.
f. Assay cut-off:

3. Clinical studies:
Prospective specimens were collected at seven geographically diverse U.S. sites,
of which two were for specimen collections only, and were sent to the other five
sites for testing. The testing sites also included two pediatric sites. The
NucliSENS EasyQ MRSA Assay was compared to a reference enriched culture.
The reference culture was trypticase soy broth with 6.5% NaCl, incubated for 48
hrs if negative; any suspected S. aureus was confirmed by Gram stain, latex
agglutination or DNase. The mecA mediated oxacillin resistance was tested by
disk diffusion using a 30μg cefoxitin disk and report of ≤21 mm (R), ≥22 mm (S).
There were a total of 1355 nasal specimens, with 1238 reported results. There
were 42 initial invalid results, resulting in an invalid rate of 3.4% (42/1238) from
114 valid runs. Fourteen remained invalid after repeat testing from frozen lysate.
