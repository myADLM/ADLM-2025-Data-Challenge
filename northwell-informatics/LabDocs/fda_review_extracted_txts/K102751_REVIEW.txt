L. Test Principle:
The test is based on electrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of capillary
action. The glucose oxidase and potassium ferricyanide in the strip react with the glucose
in the sample to produce an electrical current which is proportional to the amount of
glucose in the sample. The meter measures the current and converts it to the
corresponding glucose concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run precision was evaluated by analyzing venous whole blood samples
spiked to five different glucose concentrations. The hematocrit of all samples
was between 35 and 50%. Five different lot numbers of test strips and ten
meters were used in the study and each of the samples was measured ten times
per strip lot number per meter for a total of 100 measurements per glucose
concentration. The samples were analyzed by one operator in one day. Of the
five strip lots that were evaluated, the following three lots represent typical
performance:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor evaluated the linearity of the meter by preparing a series of 9
glucose samples, following the dilution scheme in CLSI EP6-A, and
producing target values of 13, 88, 162, 237, 311, 386, 462, 535, and 610
mg/dL.
Each of the nine levels was analyzed five times using two lots of test strips.
All samples were also tested on the YSI 2300 analyzer. Linear regression of
the data produced the following:
Strip Lot Slope Intercept Corr Coeff (r2)
1 1.047 -4.5 0.996
2 1.032 0.99 0.995
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement
range of 20 – 600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The LabonaCheck Gluppy Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to
the YSI 2300 Glucose analyzer which is calibrated using the YSI 2747 Glucose
Standard which is a NIST traceable glucose standard.

d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the device is 20 - 600 mg/dL. This range was
validated by the linearity study (M.1.b).
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed interference studies in accordance with CLSI EP7-A.
Testing was performed in parallel (control samples vs. test samples) to
minimize the effects of glucose metabolism. Whole blood was drawn into K -
3
EDTA anticoagulant tubes from healthy volunteers who were not on any
medications. The glucose levels tested were 64, 151, and 257 mg/dL. The
highest level was achieved by spiking. A low and high concentration of each

directly to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with fresh capillary whole blood from the
finger which is applied directly to the test strip.
5. Calibration:
Each vial of strips contains a Code Key which is used to code the meter before
use.
6. Quality Control:
Controls are not included in the starter kit, but the labeling explains how users can
obtain two levels of controls. The labeling also provides recommendations on
11

--- Page 12 ---
when to test control materials. An acceptable range for each control level is
printed on the test strip vial label. If the control values fall outside these ranges,
the user is instructed to repeat the control test. If the user continues to get out of
range results, they are instructed not to use the system and to contact technical
service.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit study: The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated using
venous whole blood samples with hematocrit levels across the claimed range and
altered to glucose concentrations from 23 – 479 mg/dL. There were five
measurements for each combination of glucose concentration and hematocrit
level. The results demonstrated that the LabonaCheck Gluppy Blood Glucose
Monitoring System produces accurate results over the claimed hematocrit range
of 20 – 60%.
2. Altitude study: A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of altitude on the
device. In this evaluation, venous blood at glucose concentrations of
approximately 100, 200, and 300 mg/dL was tested using a decompression
chamber to simulate the effects of altitude. Three lots of test strips and three
meters were used. Each blood sample was also tested by the YSI 2300 analyzer.
The meter readings obtained were compared to the YSI method and the percent
bias was determined at each level against the YSI results. The results
demonstrated that the LabonaCheck Gluppy Blood Glucose Monitoring System
produces accurate results at altitudes up to 10,000 feet.
3. Temperature and humidity studies: In this study, three test strip lots were tested
on three meters at three glucose concentrations (approximately 45, 120, and 300
mg/dL) at twelve combinations of temperature and humidity. Each combination
of environmental conditions / glucose concentration / meter was tested in
replicates of three. The temperatures tested ranged from a low of 10.2° C to a
high of 41.1° C. The relative humidity tested ranged from 10.2% - 86.3%.
Glucose concentrations were verified by the YSI reference method. The bias
relative to the reference method was acceptable to support the claim that
temperatures from 10 – 40° C (50 – 104° F) and relative humidity from 10 – 80%
do not significantly affect the glucose results.
4. Infection Control Studies. The Ceragem Medisys LabonaCheck Gluppy Blood
Glucose Monitoring System is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection
efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meter and
lancing device by an outside commercial testing facility demonstrating complete
inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, CaviWipes
(EPA Registration Number 46781-8). Robustness studies were also performed by
the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external
materials for the meter and lancing device after 1825 cleanings and 1825
disinfection steps with CaviWipes. The robustness studies were designed to
12

simulate 5 years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate
instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
5. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Testing was evaluated and certified by
TUV and a test report dated September 11, 2010 was submitted stating that the
device met all of the requirements of the following standards:
EN 61326: 1997 + A1: 1998 + A2: 2001 + A3: 2003
EN 61326-2-6: 2006
EN 60601-1-2: 2007
EN 55011: 2007 Group 1 Class B
6. Readability Assessment: The sponsor performed a reading level assessment of
the labeling. The Flesch-Kincaid results were as follows:
User manual: Grade level 7.5
Test strip insert: Grade level 7.8
Control solution insert: Grade level 7.8
7. Usability Study: A usability study was performed to assess the readability of the
labeling by recruiting untrained lay users who were provided with the test kit and
labeling. These lay users also completed a questionnaire regarding the clarity of
the instructions and the ease of use of the device. The majority of the users
responded that they understood the instructions and were able to successfully
operate the device.
8. The sponsor provided the results of the device software testing including a hazard
analysis, traceability analysis, validation and verification testing, and release level
history which were reviewed and found to be adequate.
