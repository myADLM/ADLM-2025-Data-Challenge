I. Device Description:
The Atlas Home Pregnancy Test consists of a single test strip encased in plastic
device housing, with an absorbent tip. The results are generated by immersing the tip
in the urine stream for a sufficient amount of time to absorb an adequate sample
volume. Each test device consists of a membrane coated with polyclonal anti-hCG
antiserum as a test line, mouse anti-hCG antiserum colloidal gold conjugate, and the
control line which contains a monoclonal goat anti-mouse antiserum.

Gonadotropin (hCG) in urine for early detection of pregnancy. The method employs
monoclonal-dye conjugate to identify hCG in the test sample.
During testing, the urine sample reacts with the dye conjugate (hCG antibody
colloidal gold conjugate) which has been pre-coated on the test strip. The mixture
then migrates upward on the membrane chromatographically by capillary action to
react with hCG antibody on the membrane and generate a red band. Presence of the
red band indicates a positive result, while its absence indicates a negative result.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Urine specimens spiked with varying hCG concentrations (1st WHO
International Standard-NIBSC code 99/688) were measured in 10 replicates
using three different lots. Results were visually interpreted at three minutes
after sample application. Based on these results, the sponsor claimed a
detection limit of 25 mIU/mL.

0 negative 0 negative 0 negative
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity is not applicable since this is a qualitative test.
The test was evaluated for high dose effect. Negative urine samples were
spiked with varying hCG concentrations (62,500, 125,000, 250,000, 500,000,
1,000,000 and 2,000,000 IU/mL). All tested concentrations gave a positive
result.

Additionally, the sponsor evaluated the effects of the hCG β-core fragment on
the performance of the device. A urine sample [20 mIU/mL] was spiked with
various concentrations of β-core-fragment hCG (0, 63,000, 125,000, 250,000,
500,000 and 1,000,000 pmol/L). Partial interference was observed at 250,000
pmol/L while higher concentrations (500,000 and 1,000,000 pmol/L)
interfered with the performance of the device. The labeling includes a
statement that high concentrations of ß-core fragment hCG may interfere with
the results.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Atlas Home Pregnancy Test (Midstream Format) is calibrated with reference
material traceable to WHO 3rd International Standard.
Real-time and accelerated stability testing showed that the devices were stable
and detection limit was unchanged for 24 months when stored at 36-86oF.
d. Detection limit:
Please refer to Precision Study Data in Section M1a.
e. Analytical specificity:
To evaluate cross-reactivity, negative and positive urine samples (0 and 25
mIU/mL hCG) were spiked with varying concentrations of other glycoprotein
hormones such as LH, FSH and TSH. Each sample was tested in triplicate.
Spiked Compound Negative Urine Positive Urine
(0 mIU/mL hCG) (25 mIU/mL hCG)
LH [300 mIU/mL] Negative Positive
FSH [1000 mIU/mL] Negative Positive

To evaluate potential interference from certain exogenous compounds, male
urine samples containing 0 and 25 mIU/mL hCG were visually interpreted at
three and ten minutes after sample application.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Two method comparison studies were performed to determine the
performance characteristics of the proposed device. Samples for both studies
were collected from women at early stage of pregnancy (less than 5 weeks)
and women suspecting that they were pregnant. In the first study, one hundred
subjects (58 pregnant and 42 non-pregnant women, aged 18 to 45 years)
performed a midstream self test. Additionally, the hundred subjects collected a
urine sample and it was tested on the proposed and the predicate device
(ACON Midstream Pregnancy Test; k983090) by laboratory professionals.
The results are presented in the table below.
Predicate (professional users)
New device (lay Positive Negative
users)
Positive 58 0
Negative 0 42
For the second method comparison study, fifty one subjects performed a
midstream self test (two subjects had an invalid result due to insufficient
sample volume) using the proposed device according to the package insert
written in English and then collected a urine sample for testing by a laboratory
professional. The collected urine samples were split and tested on the
proposed and the predicate device (ACON One Step Pregnancy Test Device;
k993317) by laboratory professionals. The results are presented in the table
below.
Predicate (professional users)
New device (lay Positive Negative
users)
Positive 29 0
Negative 0 20
A lay user reproducibility study was also performed to evaluate whether lay
users could correctly observe the test line at the claimed cutoff. Forty female
lay user subjects (18 to 45 years) evaluated their own urine sample as well as a
supplied spiked control urine sample near the cutoff concentration. All subjects
were able to read the result of their own sample as well as the control sample
near the cutoff.
