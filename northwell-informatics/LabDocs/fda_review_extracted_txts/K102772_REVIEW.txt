particle-mycophenolic acid conjugate (PR) and monoclonal mycophenolic acid
specific antibody (Ab). Mycophenolic acid present in the sample competes with
mycophenolic acid on the particles for available antibody, thereby decreasing the rate
of aggregation. Hence, the rate of aggregation is inversely proportional to the
concentration of mycophenolic acid in the sample. The rate of aggregation is
measured using bichromatic turbidimetric readings at 340 nm and 700 nm. The
reaction can be represented as follows:
Mycophenolic acid + PR + Ab —––——> PR-Ab complex + mycophenolic acid-Ab
(scatters light at 340 nm)
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The claimed reportable range of the assay is 0.2 - 30.0 µg/mL. Linearity was
determined across the range of the assay by diluting a high MPAT plasma
pool with a low MPAT plasma pool to yield 13 concentrations covering and
extending slightly above and below the assay measuring range. The initial
low starting concentration was an EDTA plasma sample not containing
MPAT and the initial high starting concentration was determined by spiking
in a known amount of MPAT. Theoretical values below are based on the
gravimetrically-determined spiked concentrations and the dilution factors.
The mean of 5 measurements was compared to the theoretical values
according to the dilution scheme. All recoveries were within ± 9 % as
follows:

Simple linear regression produced the following equation: y = 1.00x + 0.00.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrator Traceability and Value Assignment
Calibrators are provided at 0, 0.7, 2.3, 6.7, and 30.0 μg/mL and are prepared
in an aqueous bovine serum albumin (BSA) matrix. Each commercial lot of
calibrator is traceable to a five-level Anchor Pool of MPA. The Anchor Pool
is traceable to a gravimetric measurement of MPA (Pharmaceutical grade raw
material). The sponsor estimates the uncertainty of assigned values of lot
calibrators relative to the pharmaceutical grade material to be < 4%.
Commercial lot values for each level are assigned from Dimension
instruments calibrated with Anchor Pool.
Calibrator Stability
The claimed shelf life (closed vial) for the calibrator is 12 months at 2-8° C.
Shelf life is determined by comparing multiple replicates of the calibrator
stored at 2-8°C with the same material stored at < -20°C. The method is
calibrated each month with calibrator stored at < -20°C. The 2-8°C material
values are recovered (as unknowns) versus the calibration. Recovery versus
time is monitored and percent change over time is determined. The sponsor’s
protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
The claimed open vial stability for the calibrator is 60 days at 2-8°C. Opened
vial stability is determined as follows: Vials are opened on day zero. A
quantity sufficient for a calibration is removed and the vials are recapped and
stored at 2-8°C. These vials are tested on days 0, 33 and 61. Freshly opened
vials are tested on days 33 and 61 for comparison. The sponsor’s protocols
and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
Five samples were gravimetrically spiked to 0.2 μg/mL MPA analyte for
analysis. Two instruments were used, with a different reagent lot on each

instrument. The five samples were processed in triplicate during each run.
Three runs were performed on each instrument system over three days. The
sponsor analyzed LoQ data consistent with CLSI EP17-A. Results were as
follows:
Instrument 1
Bias of individual measurements relative to LC-MS ranged from - 0.07 μg/mL
to + 0.07 μg/mL
CV: 12.5% at 0.2 μg/mL
Instrument 2
Bias of individual measurements relative to LC-MS ranged from - 0.07 μg/mL
to + 0.05 μg/mL.
CV: 16.4% at 0.20 μg/mL
The LoQ was determined to be 0.2 μg/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Specificity studies were conducted for two MPA metabolites, MPA-acyl
glucuronide (MPA-ag) and 7-Ο-MPA-β-glucuronide (MPAG), in addition to
the pro-drug Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF). The percent cross-reactivity was
calculated as follows:
% Cross Reactivity = ((Measured Analyte - Control Analyte) /
(Metabolite concentration) X 100.

Ninety-five exogenous substances and co-administered drugs and four
endogenous substances were tested to the highest concentration expected.
Test substances, in duplicate, were spiked into aliquots of EDTA plasma pools
containing MPA (2 µg/mL and 5µg/mL) and analyzed by calculating the
mean and percent recovery of MPA. These results are compared to control
samples prepared without the test substance. The manufacturer defined
interference as bias greater than 10%. None of the substances in the list
below caused significant interference at the concentrations tested.

A separate study was performed to asses the effect of hemoglobin, conjugated
and unconjugated bilirubin, and triglycerides (through the use of Intralipid).
Test substances were prepared in duplicate; the interferent was added to
EDTA plasma pools containing 2 µg/mL and 5 ug/mL of MPA. The samples
were analyzed and the calculated mean of replicates and percent recovery of
MPA were compared to the "negative control" (EDTA plasma pool with 2
12

--- Page 13 ---
µg/mL and 5 ug/mL of MPA without interferent). No interference was
observed from these substances at the following levels:
Interferent Concentration Tested
Hemoglobin 1000 mg/dL
Bilirubin (unconjugated) 80 mg/dL
Bilirubin (conjugated) 80 mg/dL
Triglycerides (Intralipid) 1000 mg/dL
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor analyzed 109 EDTA plasma samples on the MPAT assay and on
the HPLC reference method. These included 33 samples from liver transplant
patients, 42 samples from kidney transplant patients, and 34 samples from
heart transplant patients. All were clinical trough samples from adults. The
concentration range of the samples was 0.2 – 29.7 µg/mL.
Deming regression including all sample types produced the following (with
95% Confidence Intervals):
slope: 1.04 (0.99 – 1.09)
y-int: -0.02 (-0.09 – 0.04)
r: 0.98
sy/x: 0.35
Deming regression for the individual sample types was as follows:
Heart
slope: 1.01 (0.93 to 1.10)
y-int: 0.0 (-0.03 to 0.04)
r: 0.97
sy/x: 0.21
Kidney
slope: 0.99 (0.92 to 1.06)
y-int: 0.17 (0.06 to 0.27)
r: 0.98
sy/x: 0.18

Liver

b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable. This assay is intended to be used with serum samples only.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The optimal concentration range for mycophenolic acid in plasma or serum using
this assay has not been established. Therefore in the labeling the sponsor states the
following:
“Optimal concentration ranges vary according to the specific assay used, and
therefore should be established for each specific assay. Values obtained with
different assay methods should not be used interchangeably due to differences in
cross-reactivity with metabolites, nor should correction factors be applied.
Laboratories should include identification of the assay used in order to aid in
interpretation of results. Each institution should establish the optimal ranges based
on the specific assay used and other factors relevant to their patient population.
14

--- Page 15 ---
Optimal ranges depend upon the patient’s clinical state, individual differences in
sensitivity to immunosuppressive and nephrotoxic effects of mycophenolic acid,
co-administration of other immunosuppressants, time post-transplant and a
number of other factors. Therefore, individual mycophenolic acid values cannot
be used as the sole indicator for making changes in treatment regimen and each
patient should be thoroughly evaluated clinically before changes in treatment
regimens are made.
Decreased incidence of rejection in the early months after transplantation have
been reported in renal transplant patients with trough level MPA concentrations
(measured by HPLC) of ≥ 1.3 μg/mL [4.1 μmol/L] with co-administration of
cyclosporine and ≥ 1.9 μg/mL [5.9 μmol/L] with co-administration of tacrolimus.
An upper therapeutic limit based on development of toxicity has not been clearly
established”.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
