510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
k102778
B. Purpose for Submission:
Modification of device for additional body fluid application
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
CellaVision AB, CellaVision® DM 1200 with the body fluid application
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
White Blood Cells differential (peripheral blood smear), RBC characterization,
Platelet estimation, White Blood Cells differential (cytocentrifuged body fluid
smear).
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
CellaVision® DM 1200 with the body fluid application is very similar to the
predicate (CellaVision® DM96 with the body fluid application, k080595) in
terms of technology, functionality, and intended use. The device automatically
locates and presents images of nucleated cells on cytocentrifuged body fluid
preparations. The system suggests a classification for each cell and the operator
verifies the classification and has the opportunity to change the suggested
classification of any cell. The system preclassifies to the following WBC classes:
Unidentified, Neutrophils, Eosinophils, Lymphocytes, Macrophages (including
Monocytes) and Other. Cells preclassified as Basophils, Lymphoma cells,
Atypical Lymphocytes, Blasts and Tumor cells are automatically forwarded to the
cell class Other. Unidentified is a class for cells and objects which the system has
preclassified with a low confidence level.
2. Principles of Operation:
Body fluid samples are prepared by using a cytocentrifuge and a staining unit.
Twelve slides can be loaded into each magazine. The magazines are put into the
system and the slides are then processed individually. The analysis process
consists of an overview image processing and a cell-location step. The body fluid
overview image displays the entire sample area. The overview image can be used
to find cells of interest and for getting an overall impression of the sample. The
overview image can either have one 10x zoom level or both 10x and 50x zoom
levels. The cell-location step uses the optical unit and a camera taking images of
the identified cells and transferring them to a computer system. The computer
system preclassifies the images and stores the images of the located cells and the
results in a database, and displays the images in an organized manner.
3. Modes of Operation:
The CellaVision® DM 1200 is an automated cell-locating device. Stained slides
are loaded into a magazine with the capacity for 12 slides. The device fits one
magazine.
4. Specimen Identification:
The device requires barcode labeled slides for processing.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:

Glass slide with ground or clipped corners containing cytocentrifuged and stained
body fluid is analyzed. The cytocetrifugation and staining occurs separately from
the device.
6. Calibration:
Not applicable
7. Quality Control:
The cell location test is used to verify the slide preparation process and the system
hardware. In addition, the device performs self-tests during startup of the
software, and at certain points during the operation of the system. When the
software starts, the system is checked before the operator can start analyses.
