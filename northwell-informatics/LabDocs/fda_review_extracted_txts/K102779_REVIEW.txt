2. Indication(s) for use:
Emit® II Plus 6-Acetylmorphine Assay:
The Emit® II Plus 6-Acetylmorphine Assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay
with 10 ng/mL cutoff. The assay is intended for use in laboratories for the qualitative
and/or semiquantitative analyses of 6-acetylmorphine (6-AM), a heroin metabolite, in
human urine.Emit® II Plus assays are designed for use with a number of chemistry
analyzers.
Semiquantitative test results may be used to assess assay performance as part of a
quality control program and to estimate a dilution of the specimen for confirmation
by GC/MS.
The Emit® II Plus 6-Acetylmorphine Assay provides only a preliminary analytical
test result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used to obtain a
confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) is the
preferred confirmatory method. Other chemical confirmation methods are available.
Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug-of-
abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.
Emit® II Plus 6-AM/Ecstasy Calibrators/Controls:
When used as Calibrators, the materials are for the calibration of the Emit® II Plus
6-Acetylmorphine and Emit® II Plus Ecstasy Assays.
When used as Controls, the materials may be used as quality control materials based
on the specific Emit® II Plus 6-Acetylmorphine and Emit® II Plus Ecstasy Assay
cutoffs.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Analyzers capable of maintaining a constant temperature, pipetting samples, mixing
reagents, measuring enzymatic rates at 340 nm and timing the reaction accurately can be
used to perform this assay. All performance studies were conducted on the Viva-E®
analyzer.

--- Page 3 ---
The Emit® II Plus 6-Acetylmorphine Assay is a homogenous enzyme immunoassay
with a 10 ng/mL cutoff. The assay, used for the detection of 6-acetylmorphine (a
heroin metabolite) in human urine, utilizes a two-reagent system. The
Antibody/Substrate Reagent 1 is a liquid ready-to-use product comprised of mouse
monoclonal antibodies to 6-acetylmorphine (6-AM), glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), and
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in a diluent containing bovine serum
albumin (BSA), preservatives and stabilizers. The Enzyme Reagent 2 is a lyophilized
product containing 6-AM labeled bacterial recombinant glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (rG6PDH) in a diluent containing bovine serum albumin (BSA),
Hepes buffer, preservatives and stabilizers. Reagent 2 is reconstituted with either
deionized or distilled water.
The assay kit consists of Reagent 1 and Reagent 2 in plastic containers (Reagent 2 is
provided in a plastic bag with desiccant) and is available in two sizes. Emit® II Plus
Assays are designed for use with a number of chemistry analyzers.
Emit® II Plus 6-AM / Ecstasy Calibrators / Controls Levels 1 – 4:
The Emit® II Plus 6-AM / Ecstasy Calibrators / Controls are in-vitro diagnostic
products used in the calibration of the Emit® II Plus 6-Acetylmorphine Assay and the
Emit® II Plus Ecstasy Assay. These materials may also be used as quality controls
based on the specific 6-Acetylmorphine Assay or Ecstasy Assay cutoffs.
The calibrator / control products have the same formulation as the existing Emit® II
Plus Ecstasy Calibrators / Controls; cleared under k043028. The matrix is pooled,
drug-free, human urine based product containing 6- acetylmorphine (6-AM),
methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and preservatives. The four levels of
product are packaged separately in 15 mL plastic vials with a 10 mL fill per vial.
The multi-analyte Calibrators / Controls Levels 1 through 4 contain 6-AM and
MDMA at the following concentrations:
Targeted
Targeted 6-AM MDMA
Calibrator / Concentration Concentration
Control (ng/mL) (ng/mL)
Level 1 5 150
Level 2 10 300
Level 3 15 500
Level 4 20 1000
The Emit® Calibrator / Control Level 0, which contains no drug and was cleared
under k993755 will also be used with the Emit® II Plus 6-Acetylmorphine Assay.
There was no change to the Calibrator Level 0 product.

based on competition between drug in the specimen and drug labeled with the
recombinant glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (rG6PDH) for antibody binding
sites. Enzyme activity decreases upon binding to the antibody, so the drug
concentration in the specimen can be measured in terms of enzyme activity. Active
enzyme converts nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH in the presence
of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), resulting in an absorbance change that is measured
spectrophotometrically. Endogenous serum G6PDH does not interfere because the
coenzyme NAD functions only with the bacterial (Leuconostoc mesenteroides)
enzyme employed in the assay.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was determined by assaying urine pools spiked with 6-AM for 20
days, 2 runs per day in duplicate (N=80). Precision data were calculated

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
A commercially available 6-Acetylmorphine standard solution from Cerilliant
Analytical Reference Standards is used and traceable to NIST standard. This
standard solution is made into a secondary (lower concentration) stock
solution. The secondary stock solution is then spiked into the calibrators and
controls to the desired concentration. The concentrations are confirmed by
GC/MS.
Stability Studies:
Real time stability studies for both controls and calibrators were conducted.
Protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable.
The manufacturer claims the following expiration date for both controls and
calibrators:
Real-time stability studies show that when stored at 2-8 ºC, open and
unopened product is stable for nine months. Real time stability studies are on-
going to support a 12 month stability claim.
d. Detection limit:
Performance at low drug concentrations in the semi-quantitative assay was
characterized by determination of recovery (see section b above).
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was established by spiking various concentrations of
structurally related compounds into drug-free urine. Results are expressed as a
minimum concentration of metabolite or compound required to produce a
response approximately equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the assay.
The percent cross-reactivity of those compounds are presented below:

Specific Gravity and pH
Urine samples with specific gravity values ranging from 1.002 to 1.030 and
pH values ranging from 4.0 to 10.0 were tested in the presence of 7.5 and 12.5
ng/mL of 6-AM. No interference was observed.
f. Assay cut-off:
Analytical performance of the device around the claimed cutoff is
described in precision section (1 a.) above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison:
One hundred five (105) samples were analyzed by the Emit® II Plus 6-
Acetylmorphine Assay and by GC/MS. Both methods used a cutoff of 10
ng/mL. 22 samples were within +/- 50% of the cutoff by GC/MS.
Forty nine (49) samples showed positive results by both methods, while
fifty five (55) samples showed negative results by both methods. One
specimen showed a negative result by GC/MS and a positive result by the
Emit® II Plus 6-Acetylmorphine Assay.
