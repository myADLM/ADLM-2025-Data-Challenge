L. Test Principle:
The Elecsys® SHBG Immunoassay is an electrochemiluminescent, sandwich based
assay. The total duration of the assay is 18 minutes.
• 1st incubation: 10 μL of sample, a biotinylated monoclonal SHBG-specific
antibody, and a monoclonal SHBG-specific antibody labeled with a ruthenium
complex form a sandwich complex.
• 2nd incubation: After addition of streptavidin-coated microparticles, the complex
becomes bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and streptavidin.
• The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles
are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are
then removed with ProCell. Application of a voltage to the electrode then induces
chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Previously established in k031717
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Previously established in k031717
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Previously established in k031717
d. Detection limit:
Limit of detection studies were performed on the Elecsys 2010 and
MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 analyzers according to CLSI EP 17-A.
LoB:
The distribution of values for five analyte free samples pools was determined
on two Elecsys 2010 analyzers and two MODULAR ANALYTICS E170
analyzers with 3 reagent lots over 3 days, 2 runs per day with a single
replicate per run. In total, 60 determinations were obtained per reagent lot.
Values for the 3 reagent lots ranged from 0.211 to 0.268 nmol/L on the
Elecsys 2010 and from 0.189 to 0.274 on the E170. The sponsor set the LoB
claim as 0.5 nmol/L.
LoD:
The distribution of values for five low level human serum samples pools was
determined on two Elecsys 2010 analyzers and two MODULAR
ANALYTICS E170 analyzers with 3 reagent lots over 3 days, 2 runs per day
with a single replicate per run. In total, 60 determinations were obtained per
reagent lot. LoD was determined according to EP-17-A as:
LoD = LoB + 1.653 x SD (of low analyte samples)
total
LoD values obtained for the 3 reagent lots ranged from 0.313 to 0.412 nmol/L

on the Elecsys 2010 and from 0.306 to 0.411 on the E170. The sponsor set the
LoD claim as 0.8 nmol/L.
LoQ:
A low level sample set was prepared by diluting 3 human serum samples with
an analyte free diluent. The low level sample set was tested in single replicates
for 3 days, 2 runs per day on 2 Elecsys 2010 analyzers and 2 MODULAR
ANALYTICS E170 analyzers with 3 reagent lots ( N = 12) Each reagent lot
was evaluated separately. Two lots of calibrators and one lot of controls were
used for the study. To determine the LoQ, the differences between the
expected value and the measured mean value were calculated for each
member of the low level sample set to determine the total error. The average
bias and SDs for each member of the low level sample set were calculated.
LoQ values obtained for the 3 reagent lots ranged from 0.780 to 1.500 nmol/L
on the Elecsys 2010 and from 0.490 to 0.660 on the E170. The sponsor set the
LoQ claim as 2.0 nmol/L.
The measuring range of the assay was set at 0.800 – 200 nmol/L. The low end
of the measuring range was determined based on the limit of detection.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Reference range studies were performed to obtain expected human sex hormone-
binding globulin (SHBG) and testosterone values for healthy males and females
using the Elecsys® SHBG and Elecsys® Testosterone II (K093421) assays.
Testosterone and SHBG concentrations were measured in apparently healthy
males (n=214) and females (n=160) using the Elecsys® SHBG and Elecsys®
Testosterone II (K093421) assays on the Elecsys® E170 Immunoassay Analyzer.
The health status of the apparently healthy group was confirmed by a standard
clinical chemistry and hematology profile and health examination. The expected
values are presented in the table below:
SHBG (nmol/L) Testosterone (nmol/L)
N Median 5th%95 th%Median 5th% 95th%
Males 20-49 yrs 136 33.5 16.5 55.9 18.6 8.64 29.0
Males ≥50 yrs 78 40.8 19.3 76.4 16.5 6.68 25.7

Females ≥50 yrs 71 57.4 17.3 125 0.563 0.101 1.42
The free testosterone index (FTI) or free androgen index (FAI) was obtained as
follows: % FTI or FAI = ((Testosterone (nmol/L) ÷ SHBG (nmol/L)) x 100. The
results are presented in the table below:
