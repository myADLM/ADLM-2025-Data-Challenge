fingertips, forearm, or palm. Alternative site testing should be performed only during
steady-state (when glucose is not changing rapidly). Testing is done outside the body (in
vitro diagnostic use). It is indicated for lay use by people with diabetes, as an aid to
monitoring levels in Diabetes Mellitus and should only be used by a single patient and it
should not be shared. It is not indicated for the diagnosis or screening of diabetes or for
neonatal use.
The GAL-1C Blood Glucose Test Strips are to be used with the GAL-1C Blood Glucose
Meter to quantitatively measure glucose in capillary whole blood taken from fingertips,
palm, or forearm. Alternative site testing should be performed only during steady-state
(when glucose is not changing rapidly). They are not indicated for the diagnosis or
screening of diabetes or for neonatal use.
The purpose of the Contrex Plus III Glucose Control Solutions is to validate the
performance of the blood glucose monitoring system using a testing solution with a

L. Test Principle:
The meter and test strips use amperometric biosensor technology. The test strips contain glucose
oxidase which reacts to glucose present in blood, releasing electrons. The meter applies a small
electrical current to the test strip and measures changes in the current caused by the reaction of
glucose in the blood sample to the enzyme in the test strip. The meter converts the measured
current into a blood glucose reading that is displayed on the meter’s liquid crystal display. Test
strips are plasma calibrated.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run, between run, and overall precision for the device were determined for a
duration of 20 days using venous whole blood samples (HCT 43±2%) spiked with
glucose or allowed to undergo glycolysis to achieve a glucose range of 50 to 440
mg/dL. Testing was completed using ten GAL-1C meters and three different test
strips lots. In addition, precision studies included two levels of control solution. The
mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficients of variation (CV) were determined
for each sample as summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity for the device was evaluated using venous blood samples at eight different
glucose concentrations ranging from 16 to 602 mg/dL (HCT 43±2%). Forty
measurements for each glucose level (N=320) were conducted on one meter and three
strip lots. Regression analysis showed a linear relationship between the GAL-1C
glucose monitoring system and glucose concentrations determined with the YSI-2300
reference method. Linear regression analysis data for each test strip lot is shown
below:
Strip Lot Slope (95% CI) Y-intercept (95% CI) R2 value
1 1.014 (1.010 to 1.019) -2.372 (-3.714 to -1.031) 0.9984
2 1.016 (1.010 to 1.022) -2.115 (-3.787 to -0.445) 0.9975
3 1.016 (1.012 to 1.020) -2.046 (-3.210 to -0.883) 0.9988
The reportable range of the GAL-1C glucose monitoring system was confirmed to be
20 to 600 mg/dL. If a sample is less than 20 mg/dL, the result is flagged by the meter
as LO. If a sample result exceeds 600 mg/dL, the result is flagged by the meter as HI.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Qualification of glucose controls was performed by repeat analyses using three lots of
control solutions at each level on the YSI-2300 reference method after calibration
using NERL standards traceable to NIST. Pre-determined acceptance criteria for
glucose recovery must be met for each control lot. Expected values and acceptable
ranges for the controls are determined using ten GAL-1C glucose meters and one lot
of GAL-1C test strips, eight strips per meter. Glucose control value ranges are lot
dependent and are listed in the test strip vial label for each lot and level.
Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria for the glucose control solutions
were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer claims a shelf life
stability of 18 months and an open-vial stability of 3 months at the recommended
storage temperatures of 15°C to 30°C.
Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria for the GAL-1C test strips were
reviewed and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer claims a shelf life stability of
17 months and an open-vial stability of 3 months at the recommended storage
temperatures of 5°C to 30°C.
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the GAL-1C glucose monitoring system is 20 to 600 mg/dL.
This range was verified by the linearity study (see section M.1.b of this decision
summary).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interferences Study: To evaluate interference in glucose measurements by the device,
a number of endogenous/exogenous substances at two or more levels
(normal/therapeutic and high) were added to whole blood samples (HCT 43±2%)
containing three different glucose levels (70-90, 110-130, and 300-330 mg/dL).
Glucose measurements obtained from samples containing each potential interfering
substance were evaluated and compared against measurements with a control group
using the GAL-1C glucose monitoring system. Test and control samples were tested
using ten GAL-1C test strips on ten GAL-1C glucose meters. The table below shows
the levels with no interference (< 10%) when testing for glucose with the GAL-1C
glucose monitoring system:

There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip, palm,
and forearm which can be applied directly to the test strip.
5. Calibration:
This system has an autocoding system; coding of the meter by the user is not necessary.
No further calibration is required.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor has three levels of controls available for use with this meter. These control
solutions must be purchased separately using the contact information provided in the user
guide. When a test strip is inserted into the meter, each control can be measured by
following the instructions for “Control Solution Testing” provided in the user guide for
the meter. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial
label. The user is instructed to contact Customer Service if the control results fall outside
these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. A study was performed to assess the ease of use of the labeling by recruiting 50 lay users
(aged approximately 20-70 yrs old) who were provided with the test kit containing
labeling for the US market. Participants varied in age and education. The number of
male participants was 33 (66%) and females, 17 (34%). These lay users also completed a
questionnaire to response to whether the device is easy to use and the Instructions for use
were written in a way that makes it easy to use. Responses to all questions had average
ratings above the “easy” score.
2. Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the results showed that the
labeling (User Guide, test strip package insert and control solution package insert) were
written at the 8th grade level.
3. Customer service is available between 8:00 am and 5:00 pm-Central Standard Time
Monday through Friday. Users are instructed to contact their healthcare providers if out
of Central Time. The toll free US phone number is 1-877-979-5454 for customer
support.
4. Hematocrit Study: The blood hematocrit (HCT) effect on the performance of the GAL-
1C glucose monitoring system was evaluated using five different glucose concentrations
ranging from 40-550 mg/dL. Venous blood samples were tested on ten test strips of each
12

--- Page 13 ---
of three different lots. Glucose concentrations at each HCT level (30%, 33%, 35%, 43%,
50%, and 55%) were compared to results obtained with the 43% HCT sample tested with
the GAL-1C system and with the YSI reference method. Review of the manufacturer’s
data confirms acceptable performance of the GAL-1C blood glucose monitoring system
at HCT 30-55%.
5. Altitude Study: The effect of altitude was evaluated by testing venous blood samples at
five different glucose concentrations ranging from 50 to 440 mg/dL on the GAL-1C
glucose monitoring system. Ten GAL-1C glucose meters and one lot of GAL-1C tests
strips were tested along with to levels of control solutions at sea level and at 10,335 feet
above sea level. The YSI 2300 was used as the reference method. Data demonstrates
acceptable performance of the device up to the claimed altitude of 10,000 feet.
6. Temperature and Humidity Studies: The effect of temperature and humidity on the
performance of the GAL-1C glucose monitoring system was evaluated using venous
whole blood samples at four different levels (50, 120, 200, and 400 mg/dL). Twenty
replicates were tested at each glucose level with ten GAL-1C glucose meters using three
lots of strips. Glucose concentrations at the following temperature and humidity
conditions were evaluated and compared with results obtained with the YSI-2300
reference method.
Temperature: 10, 14, 20, 24, 30, 40 ± 2°C at 45-55%RH.
Relative Humidity: 20% ± 5% at 10°C and 40°C
50% ± 5% at 24°C
85% ± 5% at 10°C and 40°C
90% ± 5% at 10°C and 40°C
The study results met pre-determined acceptance criteria and support the temperature
and humidity claims of 10-40°C and 20-85% RH.
7. A sample volume study was performed to verify the test strip sample volume requirement
and the test strip fill error requirement established for the GAL-1C blood glucose
monitoring system. Three lots of test strips were tested using venous blood samples, each
adjusted to a glucose concentration of 50-70, 100-140, and 310-350 mg/dL. Blood at
each concentration was applied to strips at nine target sample volumes of 0.2, 0.3, 0.6,
0.7, 0.8, 0.8, 1.0, 1.1, and 1.5 µL. Protocols and acceptance criteria were provided and
found to be acceptable. The sponsor concluded that sample volume of ≥0.8 µL produced
accurate results and samples <0.8 µL give an error code.
8. The device is intended for single-patient use only. Dispatch towels with EPA registration
# 56392-8 were validated demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus for use with
the meter and lancing device. The sponsor also demonstrated that there was no change
in performance or in the external materials of the meter and lancing device after 1825
cleaning and disinfection cycles designed to simulate 5 years of device use.
9. EMC testing was evaluated and certified by QuieTek Corporation and a test report was
issued to Apex Biotechnology Corp. on September 23, 2010.
