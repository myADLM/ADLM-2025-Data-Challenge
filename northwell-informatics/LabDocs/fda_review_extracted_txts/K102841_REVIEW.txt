b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Study Protocol:
Linearity was evaluated following CLSI guideline EP6-A. A high spiked cortisol
sample of human saliva (33.788 ng/mL) and low cortisol sample of human saliva
(0.093 ng/mL) were used in this study. Dilutions were prepared from these two
samples to provide various concentrations of cortisol. A total of ten levels of cortisol
concentrations were tested. The cortisol concentrations ranged from 0.093 – 33.788
ng/mL.
Results Summary:
Statistical evaluations using linear regression showed that the assay is linear from
0.093 – 33.788 ng/mL, yielding a linear regression result of y = 0.973 x – 0.0540,
with a correlation coefficient of R² = 0.9976.
The data provided support the sponsor’s claim that the measuring range of this assay
is 0.1 to 30 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
Controls and calibrators are included in the test kit. The assigned cortisol values of
the calibrators are traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) cortisol reference material (code 921). Cortisol standard material is
purchased from a commercial vendor and prepared stock solution used to make the
standards, calibrators and controls is directly compared to NIST material.
Value Assignment of Calibrators and Controls
The initial lot of calibrator materials (stock solution) is value assigned through a
correlation study using NIST cortisol reference material. Based on the correlation
study with the NIST material, the cortisol values for the stock solution are
established. All subsequent standards, calibrators and controls are value assigned
against the stock solution. Verification is conducted by direct comparison with each
kit lot to the NIST reference material.
7 calibrators are provided at 0, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 10, and 30 ng/mL.
2 controls are provided at 1.0 and 20 ng/mL.

--- Page 6 ---
Stability
The shelf-life and open-vial stability testing protocols for the controls and calibrator
materials and the acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable.
Calibrator materials are stable until expiration date (9 months) when stored at 2-8ºC.
Reagent stability protocol and acceptance criteria was also evaluated and found to be
acceptable. Reagents are stable in storage at 2-8ºC for 9 months.
Open vial stability protocol and acceptance criteria was evaluated and found to be
acceptable. Open vial reagents are stable at 2-8 ºC for 31 days.
Sample stability was investigated and the protocol and acceptance criteria were found
to be acceptable. Specimens are stated to be stable when stored for no greater than 7
days at 37 °C, 7 days at 2 – 8 °C, and 7 days at -15 °C (freeze up to 7 times).
d. Detection limit:
The limit of the blank (LoB), The limit of detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation
(LoQ) for salivary cortisol was determined from 120 measurements (40
measurements per day over 3 days) on one cortisol deficient sample and one low level
cortisol sample (< 0.1 ng/mL). The LoB was determined to be 0.0392 ng/mL, and the
LoD was determined to be 0.0519 ng/mL. The calculated LoQ based on a stated bias
of 13.6% CV was 0.0519 ng/mL.
This assay has a measuring range of 0.1 to 30 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference Study Protocol:
An in-vitro interference study was conducted by spiking three levels of Cortisol (low,
medium and high) with high concentrations of five potentially interfering substances.
The in-vivo experiment was conducted by simulating the intake of five potentially
interfering substances by spiking control saliva with either the potential interferent
itself or an extract of the potential interferent (food was homogenized and
centrifuged, and the supernatant was spiked into control saliva).
Result Summary:
Based on the sponsor’s definition of non-significant interference (within 10%
recovery of the control sample), the following claims were made:
The below compounds at the indicated concentration do not cause significant
interference with the assay.

The Package insert contains the following limitation: “Avoid food
consumption, drinking coffee or alcohol, smoking or chewing gum one (1)
hour prior to sample collection. Rinse mouth thoroughly with water 15
minutes prior to collection.”
Cross-Reactivity Study Protocol:
The sponsor evaluated cross-reactivity by using a cortisol-free saliva pool.
Structurally related compounds were spiked into the saliva pool at concentrations up
to 10,000 ng/mL for cross reactivity evaluation. % Cross-reactivity was calculated
using the following the equation:
% Cross-reactivity = Mean cortisol of the Cross-Reactant pool x 100
Concentration of Cross-Reactant
Result Summary:
Based on the calculated % Cross-reactivity, only prednisolone was found to
significantly cross-react with the proposed assay. The interference of prednisolone is
stated in the package insert of the device.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Study Protocol:
A total of 160 patient saliva samples from a commercial vendor were used in the
method comparison study. These samples were all collected in the recommended
collection tubes, and together with 6 spiked samples they ranged from 0.1 ng/mL to
29.85 ng/mL. The spiked samples used to cover the upper measuring range of the
proposed assay were spiked with different volumes of 1000 ng/mL concentration of
stock calibrator solution (prepared with the NIST cortisol reference material, code
921) with target concentrations between 10 ng/ml and 30 ng/ml. Linear regression
analysis was performed between the proposed salivary cortisol assay and the
predicate device.
Result Summary:
The Result of Linear Regression analysis yielded a regression equation of y = 1.0269x
+ 0.0994 with a correlation coefficient of r = 0.9898.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The listed expected normal values for the assay of 2.58 – 12.69 ng/mL (AM) and 0.25 –
2.96 ng/mL (PM) were determined in saliva specimens from a population of 152 healthy
adults (76 male, 76 female, ages 23-68) for AM analysis and 152 healthy adults (76 male,
76 female, ages 23-68) for PM analysis. The inclusion criteria for the healthy adult
population was adults of all ages, genders and race with normal TSH and TPO levels, not
currently undergoing medical treatment or drug therapy, and free of illness on the day of
sample collection. The exclusion criteria included patients on cortisol therapy, on
hormone therapy or taking oral contraceptives, patients with implanted contraceptive
devices, history of thyroid or other autoimmune disease, history of Cushings syndrome or
Addison’s disease, pregnant or lactating women, and any patient who had consumed an
alcoholic beverage within 24 hours of sample collection. The labeling states that each
laboratory should check the validity of this reference range and if necessary establish its
own patient population specific reference interval.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
