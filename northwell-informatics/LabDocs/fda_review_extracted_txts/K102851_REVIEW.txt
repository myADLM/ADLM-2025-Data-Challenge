L. Test Principle:
In the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), factor VIII deficient plasma
provides normal activity for all procoagulants except for factor VIII. When normal
plasma is added to factor VIII deficient plasma, the APTT reverts to normal. Factor
VIII activity in a patient’s plasma is determined by performing a modified activated
partial thromboplastin time (APTT). Patient plasma is diluted and added to NoFact
VIII Deficient Plasma. The APTT clotting time of this mixture is inversely
proportional to factor VIII concentration (% activity) in the patient plasma.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Three lots of NoFact VIII Deficient Plasma were evaluated for precision using
the Diagnostica Stago STA Compact® analyzer and Stago PTT Automate 5
reagent. Acceptance criteria were < 10% for within-run %CV and < 15% for
within-device %CV. FVIII activity measurements of normal control plasma
(System N) and abnormal control plasma (System P) were analyzed in
duplicate for each run, with two runs per day, over a total of 20 days (n = 80

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity testing was performed using three lots of NoFACT VIII Deficient
Plasma on the STA Compact® analyzer using Stago PTT Automate 5 reagent
and Stago STA® Unicalibrator. A series of 11 FVIII concentrations ranging
from 0.7% to 160% were created by reconstituting ISTH standard plasma and
diluting with imidizole buffered saline. The FVIII dilutions were run in
duplicate for each NoFACT VIII Deficient Plasma lot and the average
activities were plotted against their assigned values. Acceptance criterion for
allowable total nonlinearity was 15% and each lot of NoFACT VIII Deficient
Plasma results were linear within the criterion. The results support the
claimed assay reportable range of 1% - 160% FVIII activity. The calculated
slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient are provided in the following
table:

Lot 3 1.04 -0.5 0.99941
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Real Time Stability: Three lots of NoFACT VIII Deficient Plasma were
stored at 2-8 °C and at periodic times vials were reconstituted for stability
testing. The study was performed on the STA Compact® using Stago PTT
Automate 5 reagent to determine the recovery of FVIII activity for System N
and System P controls. Real time stability was tested for 26, 28, and 33
months and all results were within the control acceptance range. Results for
accelerated stability, which projects a 2.4 year shelf life, support a 2-year shelf
life claim of NoFACT VIII Deficient Plasma when stored at 2-8 °C. Ongoing
real-time stability testing will be used to update the shelf life.
Reconstituted Stability: Vials from 3 lots of NoFact VIII Deficient Plasma
were reconstituted and stored at 2, 6, 8 and 24 hours at 2-8ºC. An additional
set of vials were stored at 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours at room temperature (18-26°C).
The recovered FVIII activity values at the time of reconstitution were
considered the "zero hour" baseline. At the time periods after reconstitution,
vials from both sets of temperatures were run and the recovery at that time

point was determined. These recoveries were compared to the baseline
recovery by calculating the % shift in value: (baseline value - time point
value) divided by (baseline value). The criterion for acceptance was a shift of
≤ 10%. The data indicate that the % shift at each relevant time point tested
met the specified limitation. Reconstituted NoFACT VIII Deficient Plasma is
stable for 4 hours when stored at room temperature (18-26°C) and for 8 hours
when stored at 2-8 °C.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were conducted by spiking pooled normal plasma (PNP)
with various concentrations of hemoglobin, bilirubin, and triglycerides. Each
PNP interferent dilution was then assayed for its FVIII activity on the STA
Compact® using Stago PTT Automate 5 and NoFact VIII Deficient Plasma.
The maximum concentration tolerated in the study was defined as the highest
concentration of interferent wherein a shift relative to the recovered value of
the unspiked PNP clotting time was less than 10%. Study results showed that
factor VIII activity using NoFACT VIII Deficient Plasma is not affected by
hemoglobin up to 500 mg/dL, unconjugated bilirubin up to 20 mg/dL, and
triglycerides up to 2000 mg/dL.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:

b. Matrix comparison:
Fresh vs. Once Thawed Samples – FVIII activity was tested on patient and
donor samples using the Stago PTT Automate 5 reagent on the STA
Compact® analyzer. Eighteen (18) patient samples (9 normal and 9
abnormal) were used for the study. After testing the fresh samples, samples
were split and stored at -20°C and -80°C for one to three days. Each sample
was then thawed and re-tested. Acceptance criterion was r > 0.90. Regression
analysis produced a slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient (r) of 1.064,
−0.02, and 0.994 respectively for the −20°C samples and a slope, intercept,
and correlation coefficient (r) of 0.863, 0.02, and 0.998 respectively for the
−80°C samples.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Verification of the normal range for Factor VIII activity was performed using
NoFact VIII Deficient Plasma. A total of 92 samples of apparently normal
healthy donors were tested for Factor VIII activity with the Stago PTT Automate
5 reagent on the STA Compact® analyzer. Statistical analysis of the results
verified the cited normal range for Factor VIII activity of 50 - 150% when using
