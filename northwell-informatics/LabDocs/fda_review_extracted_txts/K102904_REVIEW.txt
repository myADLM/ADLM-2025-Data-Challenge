4. Special instrument requirements:
The ADVIA Centaur® Enhanced Estradiol (eE2) Master Curve Material is to be used

I. Device Description:
ADVIA Centaur Master Curve Material (MCM) is a single-analyte, lyophilized product
containing various levels of USP-Grade estradiol in human serum. The kit consists of 1 vial
each of 6 levels. Estradiol levels are value assigned for ADVIA Centaur systems. MCM are
for in vitro diagnostic use in the verification of calibration and reportable range in ADVIA
Centaur Enhanced Estradiol assay. MCM are not intended for use as routine quality control
material.
MCM levels 2 though 6 are manufactured using normal male human serum spiked with USP
grade estradiol stock to target values of 60, 175, 400, 1500, and 2700 pg/mL. The eE2
MCM1 is manufactured using the eE2 buffer basepool with a target of 0 pg/mL.
The eE2 MCMs are filled at 1 mL into 5 mL amber vials and then lyophilized. The
lyophilized material is stored at 2-8°C.
The eE2 MCM’s contain human source material. Each human serum or plasma donor unit
used in the manufacture of this product was tested by FDA approved methods and found
nonreactive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis C (HCV), and
antibody to HIV-1/2. However, all products manufactured using human source material
should be handled as potentially infectious. Because no test method can offer complete
assurance that hepatitis B or C viruses, HIV, or other infectious agents are absent, these
products should be handled according to established good laboratory practices.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The ADVIA Centaur eE2 assay and the Master Curve Materials are traceable to ID-
GC/MS values.
Stability:
Real time (2-8 °C) and accelerated (25°C and 37°C) stability studies are being
conducted on at least two lots of ADVIA Centaur Enhanced Estradiol Master Curve
Material. The control material is stored at < -40°C, which was determined to be
appropriate by comparison of the control material stored at -40°C to a master set
stored at -80°C or standards that are stored at -80°C. The acceptance criteria states
that the percent difference in material must be within 10% of the -40°C daily dose or
the 2-8°C day zero dose with no adverse trends.
Open vial studies are being performed for 42 days at 2-8°C. Vials are opened at day
zero and at each time point, the open vial, a frozen vial (that was placed in aliquots
after reconstitution), and a fresh vial are tested. Percent recovery is calculated using
the average dose from triplicate results and the acceptance criteria is that the open vial
must be within 10% or two standard deviations from the frozen material. The sponsor
will claim that it is stable for 14 day once reconstituted and stored at 2-8 °C.
On-system stability is being measured by using at least two lots of material for 24
hours at room temp in uncapped centaur tubes. 15 sets of material are reconstituted
and pooled in 50 mL polypropylene tubes. The material is then distributed at 1mL in
sample cups. Five cups are capped and stored at 2-8°C, and the other five cups are left
uncapped at room temperature. Tubes are capped at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours and then
the percent recovery is measured using the average dose from triplicate results against
the 2-8°C material. The acceptance criteria require that the percent recovery must be
within 10% or two standard deviations of the 2-8°C stored material. The sponsor will
claim that it is stable for 6 hours once reconstituted and placed on the system.
Value Assignment
Estradiol Master Curve Material is value assigned using an internal estradiol “gold
standard” set that uses a panel of real serum samples and was value assigned by Gas
Chromatography Mass Specification. The MCM and Gold standards are tested on
three different ADVIA Centaur XP systems and MCM values are calculated for each
system independently. The assigned value for each MCM is the average analyte
recovered and must quality controls are calculated by the recovery of controls using
calibrator values and must fall within set specifications. The target specifications for
production lots are:

Dose
UOM TARGET RANGE RANGE
LOW HIGH
MCM1 pg/mL 0 NA ≤11.8
MCM2 pg/mL 60 53 67
MCM3 pg/mL 175 154 196
MCM4 pg/mL 450 396 504
MCM5 pg/mL 1500 1320 1680
MCM6 pg/mL 2700 2430 2970
The customer ranges for the product insert are then determined by the following
equations:
Upper Limit Customer Range = Assigned Target + Assigned Target x % interval
Lower Limit Customer Range = Assigned Target – Assigned Target x % interval
The percent intervals are ± 25% for MCM2-MCM6.
Matrix Effects
The sponsor performed spiking recovery of MCM2-6 to determine matrix effects. A
stock solution of USP-Grade estradiol was added to the sample and the material was
recovered. The acceptance criteria were that the recoveries across all 6 samples had to
be within ±10% and no individual recovery could be more than ±15%. All of their
samples met the acceptance criteria and show that there is no significant matrix effect
from using pooled human serum with sodium azide as the base matrix for eE2
MCM’s.
