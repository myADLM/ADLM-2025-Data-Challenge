L. Test Principle:
The assay determines the functional activity of Factor IX by measuring the degree of
prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time in the presence of a contact
activator, thromboplastin, phospholipids and calcium ions. Factor IX activity is correlated
with the prolongation of the clotting time of the Factor IX deficient plasma when added
to diluted patient plasma. The APTT clotting time of this mixture is inversely
proportional to factor IX concentration (% activity) in the patient plasma.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Studies for within-run, lot-to-lot and within-device precision were performed
on low % activity factor IX pooled plasma for 10 days along with normal and
high controls for 20 days. The controls and low % activity pooled plasma
were tested with 3 lots of Stago PTT-A reagent and 3 lots of NoFACT IX
deficient plasma on the Stago STA Compact analyzer. Testing was conducted
twice a day with two replicates per run for each sample. The acceptance
criteria for within-run and lot-to-lot %CV is <10% and for within device
%CV is <15%. The overall results of the study met the acceptance criteria as
follows:
Mean

FVIII % CV NoFact % CV % CV
Sample Type Within-

System N 1 3.2 5.3 6.6

System P 1 4.4 5.2 7.3
(Abnormal 43% 2.9% 2 4.0 4.1 7.2
Control Plasma) 3 3.5 4.4 6.7
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies were performed using the Stago PTT-A reagent on the STA
Compact analyzer. The assays were calibrated using the Stago Unicalibrator.
A series of 11 dilutions was conducted from reconstituted ISTH SSC
approved plasma and diluted with the assay diluent and was tested at
concentrations ranging from 0.8 to 188% activity. Duplicate measurements of
each dilution were obtained with each of 3 lots of NoFACT IX. The Factor IX
dilutions were run in duplicate for each NoFACT VIII Deficient Plasma lot
and the average activities were plotted against their assigned values The
acceptance criteria were as follows: slope of 0.8-1.2, intercept <6.0 and r >0.9.
The calculated slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient are provided in the
following table:
NoFact IX Deficient Plasma Slope Intercept r-value
Lot 1 1.212 -0.57 0.9998
Lot 2 1.084 1.168 0.9959
Lot 3 1.066 0.815 0.9979
The results of the study were within acceptable limits.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Real-time Stability:
Three lots of NoFACT IX Deficient Plasma were tested with Stago System N
and P control plasmas for factor IX recovery for real-time stability. The lots
were tested on the Stago STA Compact using Stago PTT-A, Stago System N

and P control plasmas, and Stago Unicalibrator. The NoFact IX plasma was
stored, reconstituted and tested from 0 months through 33 months at specific
time intervals. Factor IX recovery of all three lots was acceptable based on the
established reference range of each control. Results for the accelerated
stability study, which projects a 2.4 year shelf life, support a 2-year shelf life
claim of NoFact IX Deficient Plasma when stored at 2-8 °C. Ongoing real-
time stability testing will be used to update the shelf life.
Reconstituted stability at Room Temperature and 2-8ºC:
Two lots of NoFact IX Deficient Plasma were reconstituted according to the
package insert. The Stago PTT-A and NoFact IX deficient plasma assay was
used to test the System N and P controls for factor IX recovery. The recovered
FIX activity values at the time of reconstitution were considered the "zero
hour" baseline. The reconstituted vials were stored at 0, 2 ,6, 8 and 24 hours at
2-8ºC and 0, 4, 6 and 8 hours at room temperature. At the time periods after
reconstitution, vials from both sets of temperatures were run and the recovery
at that time point was determined. These recoveries were compared to the
baseline recovery by calculating the % shift in value: (baseline value - time
point value) divided by (baseline value). The acceptance criterion is a shift of
≤10% compared to the zero hour baseline. The overall results meet the
acceptance criteria with study results at room temperature of <8.1% and 2-8ºC
at <7.5%. Stability data supports the reconstituted stability claim of 8 hours at
2-8ºC and 4 hours at room temperature.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were conducted using pooled normal plasma (PNP)
spiked with the interferents at predetermined maximum concentrations to
create a stock preparation. The stock preparation was serially diluted 12 times
with PNP in which each dilution was tested for factor IX activity on the STA
Compact using Stago PTT-A and NoFACT IX. The % difference between the
spiked dilutions to baseline (PNP) was accessed with an overall % difference
<6%, which met the acceptance criteria difference of <10%.
Maximum Concentration results are as follows:
Interferents Maximum Concentration
Hemolysis 500 mg/dL
Icterus 20 mg/dL
Lipemia 2000 mg/dL (triglycerides)
Low Molecular Weight Heparin 5 anti-Xa units/mL
Direct Thrombin Inhibitor 20 ug/mL
Unfractionated Heparin 2.0 Units/mL
