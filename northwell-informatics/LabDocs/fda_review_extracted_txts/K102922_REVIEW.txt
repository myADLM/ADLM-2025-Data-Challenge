I. Device Description:
HardyCHROM™ MRSA is translucent and light amber in color and contains
chromogens that release chromophores when cleaved by enzymes that are
produced by MRSA strains. Based on colony color, HardyCHROM™ MRSA
allows for the reliable detection of most methicillin-resistant S. aureus from
clinical specimens in less than 24 hours based on the appearance of a
pink/magenta colored colony. Non-MRSA strains are either inhibited by the

addition of selective agents or utilize different chromogenic substrates in the
media to produce different colored colonies. If none of the substrates are utilized,
natural or white colored colonies will be present. If plates are negative for growth
after 24 hours, it is recommended to re-incubate for an additional 24 hours.

L. Test Principle:
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains produce pink to magenta colonies
as the result of the chromogenic substrates incorporated into the HardyCHROM™
MRSA medium. The addition of specific inhibitory agents allows for the growth of
mecA mediated MRSA strains while preventing growth of methicillin sensitive
Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) strains. Additional selective agents have been added
to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the medium by inhibiting gram-negative
organisms, yeast, and some gram-positive cocci. Bacteria other than MRSA may
utilize additional chromogenic substrates present in the medium and produce blue or
green colonies. HardyCHROM™ MRSA can detect most MRSA strains within 24
hours. Negative plates should be re-incubated up to 48 hours.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility Study with Characterized MRSA & MSSA strains
Reproducibility testing of HardyCHROM™ MRSA was conducted with
twenty well-characterized test strains (fifteen MRSA strains that included
Pulse-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) types USA100, USA200, USA300-
0114, USA400, USA500, USA600, USA700, USA800, USA1000, USA1100,
additional MRSA strains that are representative of prevalent HA(Hospital
acquired)-MRSA and CA(community acquired)-MRSA (NRS100, NRS70,
NRS71, BAA-43, BAA-44) and five MSSA (NRS72,
SF_SNIF58,SF_SNIF104, SF_SNIF129, SF_SNIF142) that were selected
from medically important S. aureus lineages. SF8300 is a wound isolate of
pulse-field type USA300-0114, a subtype implicated in severe disease and in
numerous outbreaks. All of the characterized test strains were obtained from
the University of San Francisco and (DNA restriction patterns) were
determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. (J Clin Microbiol 33:2233-9)
Three different lots of HardyCHROM™ MRSA plates were tested to
determine that the HardyCHROM™ MRSA plates reliably detected MRSA
strains across different lots at different time intervals. A commercial
chromogenic MRSA medium was also evaluated with the same strains and
served as a performance standard. An acceptance reproducibility rate of 100%
for both inter-lot and overall testing intervals was achieved with the
HardyCHROM™ MRSA plates media. All of the characterized MRSA
strains showed growth and magenta colony coloration within 24 hours
following aerobic incubation at 35°C. All of the MSSA strains were inhibited
and showed no growth even after 48 hours of aerobic incubation at 35°C. No
discernible differences were observed between the performance testing of
HardyCHROM™ MRSA in comparison with the commercial chromogenic
MRSA medium.
The fifteen strains of MRSA were tested using a suspension containing
approximately 105 to 106 CFU/ml and the five strains of MSSA were tested at
a concentration of approximately 106 to 107. Ten µl of these suspensions were
inoculated onto HardyCHROM™ MRSA. The sensitivity was 100% for the
fifteen characterized MRSA strains and 100% specificity for the five
characterized MSSA strains.
Staphylococcus aureus strains with other mechanisms of oxacillin resistance
such as modified S. aureus (MOD-SA) strains) which have altered affinity of
penicillin binding proteins for oxacillin and borderline methicillin-resistant

Quality Control
Quality control was performed by each of the three testing sites on receipt of
each shipment of the medium and on each day of use following parameters in
table below. Fresh suspensions of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ATCC®
43300 and Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) ATCC® 25923 were prepared in
Tryptic Soy Broth at concentrations of approximately 105 to106 for the MRSA
strain and 106 to107 for MSSA. 10µl of these suspensions were used to
inoculate HardyCHROM™ plates. Plates were incubated and examined for 24
and 48 hours for growth of the MRSA strain and inhibition of the MSSA
strain. All QC testing results provided expected reactions at each of the three
testing sites on each day tested.

was conducted to determine if there was any cross reactivity when tested on
HardyCHROM™ MRSA medium. A total of 121 strains were tested and
included the following genera: Acinetobacter, Burkholderia, Candida,
Corynebacterium, Enterococcus, Enterobacter, Escherichia, Haemophilus,
Klebsiella, Leuconostoc, Micrococcus, Moraxella, Neisseria, Proteus,
Pseudomonas, Streptococcus and Staphylococcus. Staphylococcus strains
included MRSA, MSSA, and 20 different species of coagulase negative
Staphylococci (including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis). In
the cross reactivity study, only Corynebacterium jeikeium produced a purple
film in the first quadrant at 24 hours. At 48 hours, very small dark purple
colonies were present but were only present in the first quadrant.
Staphylococcus intermedius produced gray-blue colonies. All other organisms
were inhibited.
Mixed Infection Study
Cell suspensions at a concentration of 108 and 109 were prepared of
Staphylococcus aureus MSSA ATCC® 25923 and E. coli ATCC® 25922.
Individual 103 dilutions (LoD) of Staphylococcus aureus MRSA strains
(ATCC® 33591 and 43300) were mixed with the non MRSA strains and plated
in duplicate on Blood Agar and paired nasal swabs were inoculated with the
same suspension. The nasal swabs were used to inoculate the
HardyCHROM™ MRSA plates. On HardyCHROM™ MRSA medium, the
MRSA strains tested were detected beginning at 16 hours with final counts
being reported at 24 hours following aerobic incubation at 35°C. Pink to
magenta colonies were detected on all dilutions at 16 hours and colony counts
were stable at 21 to 24 hours with no increase in the number of colonies
counted. All dilutions plated showed typical pink to magenta colony
coloration and colony morphology was consistent with the MRSA strains. No
breakthrough was noted of any of the non-MRSA strains at 24 hours and all
plates were incubated for a total of 48 hours. There was no change in MRSA
strains colony forming units nor was there any breakthrough of non-MRSA at
the 48 hour reading.
Interference Study Results – Nasal Sprays
The strains used in this study included MRSA strains ATCC® 33591 and
ATCC 43300, as well as ten clinical MRSA isolates. Commonly used nasal
sprays that contain a concentration of 1% Phenylephrine Hydrochloride did
show an inhibitory affect for microbial growth on the nonselective Blood
Agar plates, the HardyCHROM™ MRSA plates, and BBL™ CHROMagar™
MRSA plates. Nasal sprays that did not contain this ingredient showed no
interference for growth or chromogenic reactions. The sensitivity and
specificity criteria of ≥98% were met for the HardyCHROM™ MRSA plates
as compared to BBL™ CHROMagar™ and Blood Agar plates.

Interference Study Results – Human Blood
Human blood could potentially be associated with MRSA strains in a
healthcare setting and therefore was evaluated for potential interference of the
chromogenic reaction and growth. Isolates used in this study included ATCC®
control strains of MRSA (ATCC® 33591, ATCC® 43300) and ten clinical well
characterized clinical MRSA isolates. All strains were evaluated for growth
and performance on HardyCHROM™ MRSA, a commercial chromogenic
MRSA medium, and Blood Agar plates. Results demonstrated that none of the
MRSA strains were inhibited on the three types of media evaluated, and there
was a 100% recovery rate for all strains after exposure to human blood. No
discernible difference was observed between the growth and performance
testing of HardyCHROM™ MRSA in comparison with nonselective blood
agar plates and the commercial chromogenic MRSA medium.
Interference Study Results – Transport Media
The strains used in this study included MRSA strains ATCC® 33591 and
ATCC 43300, as well as ten well-characterized clinical MRSA isolates. All of
the strains were evaluated for growth and performance on HardyCHROM™
MRSA, BBL™ CHROMagar™ MRSA, and Blood Agar plates. Testing
included the following commonly used types transport media: Stuart’s Gel,
Stuart’s Liquid, Amies Liquid, Amies Gel, and Amies Charcoal. Each
transport device tested contained rayon-tipped, plastic shaft swabs Results
demonstrated that none of the MRSA strains were inhibited on the three types
of media evaluated, and there was a 100% recovery rate for all transport
media devices tested. No discernible difference was observed between the
growth and performance testing of HardyCHROM™ MRSA in comparison
with nonselective blood agar plates and BBL™ CHROMagar™ MRSA
plates.
Interference Study – Mucin
Mucin from bovine submaxillary glands (type 1-S) was tested for interference
using ATCC® 33591, ATCC® 43300, ten well-characterized clinical MRSA
strains, and ten well-characterized clinical MSSA strains. All of the strains
were exposed to suspensions of 50% and 75% mucin and after 10 minutes,
were plated on blood agar and HardyCHROM™ MRSA. Results were
recorded after 24 hours of incubation, with negative plates being held for an
additional 24 hours (total incubation 48 hours). Suspensions prepared in
mucin were held at room temperature for 24 hours and re-plated. The
secondary plates were incubated at 35°C for 24 hours and plates with no
growth were re-incubated for a total of 48 hours. Colonies of the MRSA
strains grown on HardyCHROM MRSA™ were typical for coloration and
size. Counts were stable at 18 hours with no additional growth detected at 24
or 48 hours. All MSSA strains that were tested showed growth only on the
8

--- Page 9 ---
blood agar plate and were completely inhibited at 24 and 48 hours on
HardyCHROM MRSA™. Nasal swabs containing mucous or mucin were
evaluated determine if there was an effect on the chromogenic reaction and
the growth of MRSA strains. Isolates used in this study included ATCC®
control strains of MRSA (ATCC® 33591, ATCC® 43300), ten clinical well
characterized clinical MRSA isolates and ten well characterized clinical
MSSA isolates.
Incubation Study
When compared to traditional culture, 127 of 132 positive MRSA cultures
(96.2%) were detected on HardyCHROM™ MRSA at 24 hours. The
remaining five MRSA isolates were detected at approximately 48 hours. All
testing (clinical and in-house testing) was incubated at 35 to 37 degrees C.
f. Analytical sensitivity
Recovery Study (Limit of Detection (LoD))
ATCC® methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains (Staphylococcus
aureus subsp. aureus ATCC® 43300 and Staphylococcus aureus subsp.
aureus ATCC® 33591) were tested at seven serial dilutions in duplicate. The
dilutions were plated in duplicate to HardyCHROM™ MRSA and Tryptic
Soy Agar with 5% Sheep Blood (BAP).
On HardyCHROM™ MRSA medium, MRSA strains tested were detected
beginning at 16 hours with final counts being reported at 24 hours following
aerobic incubation at 35°C. Pink to magenta colonies were detected on all
dilutions at 16 hours and colony counts were stable from 21 to 24 hours with
no increase in the number of colonies counted. All dilutions plated showed
typical pink to magenta colony coloration. There was no significant
difference in counts noted between the two observers. Staphylococcus aureus
subsp. aureus ATCC® 43300 resulted in a 67.6% recovery when present at
102 concentration and Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus ATCC® 33591
resulted in a 34.6% recovery at the same dilution. At 101, there was 80%
recovery and 52.3% recovery respectively. At 103 there was no discernable
difference in recovery.

Performance of HardyCHROM™ MRSA was evaluated at three geographically
diverse hospitals with fresh surveillance specimens collected from the anterior
nares. The recovery of methicillin-resistant S. aureus on HardyCHROM™ MRSA
was compared to routine culture, defined as isolation of staphylococci on
Trypticase Soy Agar with 5% blood (TSAB), with S. aureus identification
confirmed by latex agglutination. All S. aureus recovered were tested for mecA
mediated resistance by PBP2' latex testing and cefoxitin and oxacillin disk
diffusion. Antibiotic disk susceptibility testing followed CLSI methods and
interpretive criteria (Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility
Testing; Twentieth Informational Supplement, M100-S20. 2010). Performance of
HardyCHROM™ MRSA was also compared to a commercially available
chromogenic medium.
A total of 443 samples were tested against routine culture. A total of 131
specimens were positive on HardyCHROM™ MRSA with concordant results
obtained on TSAB and confirmed by PBP2' latex testing and cefoxitin (30µg) and
oxacillin disk (1µg) diffusion testing. An additional specimen was positive on
HardyCHROM™ MRSA but did not grow on TSAB. Growth was confirmed as
MRSA by PBP2' latex testing and cefoxitin (30µg) and oxacillin disk (1µg)
diffusion testing. Agreement with PBP2’, cefoxitin (30µg) and oxacillin (1µg)
disk testing was 93.4% at 24 hours and 97.0% at 48 hours for mecA mediated
MRSA. Percent agreement was 99.7% for non-MRSA at both 24 and 48 hours.
The combined data from three clinical trial sites, demonstrated the positive and
negative percent agreement at 24 and 48 hours of HardyCHROM™ MRSA with
traditional culture and the commercial chromogenic MRSA medium as
