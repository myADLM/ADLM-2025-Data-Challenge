The ProAdeno™+ Assay is a multiplex Real Time PCR in vitro diagnostic test for
the qualitative detection of human Adenovirus (HAdV) DNA isolated and
purified from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens obtained from individuals
exhibiting signs and symptoms of acute respiratory infection. This test is
intended for use to aid in the diagnosis of HAdV infections in humans in
conjunction with other clinical and laboratory findings. The test detects, but does
not differentiate, serotypes 1-51.
Negative results do not preclude HAdV infection and should not be used as the
sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
To be used with the Cepheid SmartCycler II Real Time Instrument with Dx
Software version 1.7b, 3.0a, or 3.0b and either a MagNA Pure LC Instrument
(Roche) and the MagNA Pure Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Roche) or a
NucliSENS® easyMAG™ System (bioMérieux) and the Automated Magnetic
Extraction Reagents (bioMérieux).
I. Device Description:
The ProAdeno™+ Assay is a multiplex TaqMan based Real Time PCR test that
2

--- Page 3 ---
enables detection of human Adenovirus.
An overview of the procedure is as follows:
1. NP swab specimens are collected from symptomatic patients using a polyester,
rayon or nylon tipped swab and placed into viral transport medium (not
provided with the kit).
2. Universal Internal Control (UIC) is added to every sample to monitor for
inhibitors present in the specimens.
3. Isolation and purification of nucleic acids are performed using a MagNA Pure
LC Instrument (Roche) and the MagNA Pure Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit
(Roche), or a NucliSENS® easyMAG™ System (bioMérieux) and the
Automated Magnetic Extraction Reagents (bioMérieux),
4. Purified nucleic acids are added to the ProAdeno+ Supermix that contains
target-specific oligonucleotide primers and probes and Taq DNA polymerase.
The probes are dual-labeled with a reporter dye and a quencher dye (see table
below).
5. Amplification of DNA is performed in a Cepheid SmartCycler® II instrument.
In this process, the probe anneals specifically to the template followed by
primer extension and amplification. The ProAdeno+ Assay is based on
Taqman chemistry, which utilizes the 5’ – 3’ exonuclease activity of the Taq
polymerase to cleave the probe thus separating the reporter dye from the
quencher. This process generates an increase in fluorescent signal upon
excitation from a light source. With each cycle, additional reporter dye
molecules are cleaved from their respective probes, further increasing the
fluorescent signal. The amount of fluorescence at any given cycle is
dependent on the amount of amplification products present at that time.
Fluorescent intensity is monitored during each PCR cycle by the real time
instrument.

respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal swabs) from symptomatic patients are
processed initially to isolate and purify viral nucleic acid from the cellular specimen
matrix. Each sample of purified nucleic acid is added to the ProAdeno+ Supermix.
The ProAdeno+ Supermix contains target-specific oligonucleotide primers and
probes, and a Taq DNA polymerase. The primers are complementary to highly
conserved regions of the hexon gene for HAdV. The probes are dual-labeled with a
reporter dye and a quencher dye. Amplification of DNA is carried out in a Cepheid
SmartCycler® II instrument. In this process, a probe anneals specifically to a region
of the template between the forward and reverse primers. As primer extension and
amplification occurs, the exonuclease activity of the Taq polymerase cleaves the
probe separating the reporter dye away from the quencher. This cleavage reaction
generates an increase in fluorescent signal upon excitation from an LED light source
of appropriate wavelength. With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are
cleaved from their respective probes, yielding increased fluorescence signal. The
amount of fluorescence at any given cycle is dependent on the amount of PCR
product (amplicons) present at that time. Fluorescent intensity is monitored at each
PCR cycle by fluorescent detection modules within the real time instrument.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
An Inter-Laboratory Reproducibility study was conducted at 3 laboratory
sites. The Reproducibility Panel used in the study was prepared by spiking
negative nasopharyngeal (NP) swab pools with cultured and titered stock
suspensions of HAdV (serotypes HAdV-3 and HAdV-31). The
Reproducibility Panel consisted of 12 simulated clinical samples that
included the two Adenovirus serotypes at medium and low positive levels
(near the assay limit of detection, ≥ 95% positive) and two high negative
samples (high negative-1 at 0.1xLoD; high negative-2 at 0.001xLoD). Panels
and controls were tested at each site by 2 operators for 5 days (12 samples and
3 controls x 2 operators x 5 days x 3 sites = 450).
Each Panel included three replicates of each level of HAdV with at least one
replicate of each serotype at each concentration. The Panels were stored at
≤ –70oC and delivered to the sites frozen. One Panel was used for each of the
5 testing days per operator. The samples were extracted each day using the
laboratory’s standard extraction method (Roche MagNA Pure LC or
bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG) and the extracted nucleic acids were
tested with the ProAdeno+ Assay on the Cepheid SmartCycler II. ProAdeno+
Assay controls (Positive, Extraction and Negative) were also included with
each panel run. Two lots of ProAdeno+ Supermix were used by each of the
three sites. The overall percent agreement for the ProAdeno+ Assay was

Positive Control (PC): The ProAdeno+ Assay kit contains an Adenovirus
positive DNA control that consists of a non-infectious plasmid containing a
portion of the targeted gene (hexon). The PC does not go through nucleic
acid isolation and purification, but is included during set-up of the PCR
reaction. The PC in conjunction with the UIC is used to verify reagent and
system performance.
Universal Internal Control (UIC): A Universal Internal Control, containing a
non-infectious double-stranded DNA (PCR product) and a non-infectious
RNA transcript, is incorporated into every sample and is carried through all
steps of the procedure from nucleic acid isolation and purification through
amplification to monitor for inhibitors present in the specimens or reactions
tube. The Universal Internal Control contains a DNA and an RNA portion to
allow for one nucleic acid extract to be used with multiple RT-PCR/PCR
assays whether the assay detects a DNA or an RNA target. The UIC also
serves as a general process control ensuring that each step of the procedure
was performed correctly, assay and instrument parameters were set correctly,
and that general reagents were working.
Negative Control: A Negative Control is not provided with the kit, but is
required and described in the ProAdeno+ Assay Instructions for Use. Viral
transport media spiked with the UIC is to be used as the negative control and
is to be processed starting from nucleic acid isolation. The Negative Control
serves to monitor for contamination.
Extraction Control (EC): An Extraction Control (EC) is not provided with the
kit, however, during the clinical trial, an inactivated Adenovirus was included
with each extraction run as EC. The EC served to monitor for lysis during
nucleic acid isolation. The sponsor is recommending an extraction control
(with Ct between 13-40) in each nucleic acid extraction run to the end
users in the Instructions for Use.
The user must interpret the Positive Control (PC) and the Extraction Control
(if included) results to determine if the run is VALID and that results may be
reported. The SmartCycler Dx software will automatically interpret the
Negative Control result.
For a VALID Extraction run, the following conditions must be met:

d. Detection limits:
The analytical sensitivity (Limit of Detection - LoD) of the ProAdeno+ Assay
was determined for six serotypes of HAdV, one from each species (A through
F). The Analytical Sensitivity Panel was prepared by spiking the viruses into
negative nasopharyngeal (NP) pools prepared from leftover NP swab clinical
samples. Each viral strain was previously cultured and titered to determine its
stock concentration in TCID /mL. A preliminary estimate of the LoD for
50
each virus was carried out by testing five dilutions of each virus around the
expected LoD with each dilution extracted five times using the Roche MagNA
Pure LC System and the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG for a total of 10
data points per virus level. The preliminary estimate of LoD was taken to be
the lowest level of virus detected ≥ 95% of the time on both extraction
instruments (10/10 replicates); in the case of HAdV-3, the preliminary
estimate of LOD selected for confirmation had 9/10 positive replicates.
The preliminary LoD was then confirmed by preparing 40 additional
replicates (20 per extraction instrument) at the proposed LoD. The LoD was
confirmed if ≥ 95% of the samples at that level were positive. Each replicate
was subject to the entire test system from sample preparation and extraction to
PCR. If the preliminary LoD was not confirmed, then the LoD confirmation
was repeated using the next higher (10-fold) level of the particular virus.

A Universal Internal Control (UIC) was spiked into all samples prior to
nucleic acid isolation. The UIC monitored for PCR inhibition as well as
reagent, procedural or instrumentation failures.
A Negative Control, which consisted of viral transport media spiked with UIC
was included with each set of dilution series. Nucleic acid isolation of the
Negative Control was performed along with the Analytical Sensitivity Panel
samples. The Negative Control served to monitor for contamination during
the testing procedure.
The Adenovirus DNA Positive Control was included with each PCR run to
test for procedural errors (absence of reagent, instrument failure).
The tables below summarize the LoD values for the six viral serotypes. The
LoD values reported are the lowest levels that yield ≥ 95% positivity with
both methods of extraction.

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity
A panel of fifty-six (56) potentially cross reacting microorganisms consisting
of 29 viral, 26 bacterial, and 1 yeast representing common respiratory
pathogens or flora commonly present in the nasopharynx was evaluated for
cross reactivity. Each potential cross reactant was individually spiked at a
high level into a negative swab matrix. The level of each microorganism was
determined by growing and titering the microorganism listed except for
Chlamydia trachomatis for which the original titer provided by the supplier
was used. Bacteria and yeast were tested at concentrations of 106 to 107
CFU/mL; the exceptions were Chlamydia pneumoniae (103 TCID /mL) and
50
Chlamydia trachomatis (104TCID /mL). Viruses were tested at
50
concentrations of 103 to 106 TCID /mL; the exception was Epstein Barr Virus
50
(108 copies/mL).

Reactivity
Reactivity of the ProAdeno+ Assay was established for six serotypes of
Adenovirus (HAdV-1, HAdV-3, HAdV-4, HAdV-19, HAdV-31, and HAdV-
41) during the LoD study. An additional forty-five serotypes of Adenovirus
were also tested for reactivity with the ProAdeno+ Assay along with nine
other strains with genomic changes that do not result in serological changes.
One prototype strain (HAdV-52) was not included in this reactivity study due
to a lack of availability.
A preliminary Limit of Detection (LoD) was established for each strain during
pre-verification studies. In the reactivity study, the strains were tested at 3x
the preliminary LoD. One sample was generated for each strain by spiking
cultured and titered virus into aliquots of a negative nasopharyngeal (NP)
swab pool. Samples were spiked with Universal Internal Control before
extraction on the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG. Each sample was tested
in triplicate on the Cepheid SmartCycler II using one lot of ProAdeno+
reagents. A Negative Control, which consisted of UIC spiked into VTM, was
included for each set of extraction runs. The Adenovirus DNA Control was
included with each PCR run to test for procedural errors.

f. Interference Studies:
Interfering Substances
An interfering substances study was carried out to examine whether a panel of
endogenous and exogenous potential PCR inhibitors affected the
performance of the ProAdeno+ assay. Blood, mucin, or medications
(prescription and over-the-counter) for relief of congestion, sore throat,
allergy and asthma symptoms were spiked into simulated human
adenovirus (HAdV) positive NP swab matrix. A single cultured and
titered strain of HAdV-3 was used and spiked into negative NP pools at 2
x 100 TCID /ml which was 2X Limit of Detection (LoD). High,
50
clinically relevant, amounts of the potential inhibiting substances were
added to spiked samples. One sample that was not spiked with a potential
interfering substance was included to serve as a baseline for comparison.
A Universal Internal Control (UIC) was added to samples. The inclusion
of the UIC in each sample served to monitor for inhibition and aid in
preventing reporting of false negative results. Nucleic acid from the
samples was extracted with the bioMérieux easyMAG. PCR was
performed in triplicate reactions for each sample on the Cepheid
SmartCycler II using one lot of ProAdeno+ reagents. A Negative
Control, which consisted of viral transport media spiked with UIC, was
included with the Interfering Substances Panel samples. The Adenovirus
DNA Control was included with each PCR run.
The following table shows the interfering substances used for this study. As
described in the justification column, the concentrations spiked directly into
samples ranged were generally 10% of recommended dose for the most of the
substances, while others were tested at concentrations reported in scientific
literature or in references from other IVD package inserts. The substances
consisted of nasal sprays (liquid and powder), ingestible pills and lozenges,
injectables, and endogenous substances (blood and mucin).

Internal Control Interference
Competitive inhibition of the ProAdeno+ Assay due to the presence of the
UIC was assessed. Simulated samples were tested with and without UIC to
determine if the presence of the UIC inhibited the reaction. One cultured and
titered strain of human adenovirus (HAdV-1) was used and was spiked into
aliquots of a negative nasopharyngeal (NP) swab pool at LoD (1 x 100
TCID /mL) and at one log below the LoD (1 x 10-1 TCID /mL). Each
50 50
concentration was prepared with the UIC and without any UIC added. Ten
replicates of each concentration with and without UIC were extracted on the
bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG instrument. The extracted nucleic acids
were tested by PCR in a single replicate using one lot of ProAdeno+ Assay
reagents on the Cepheid SmartCyler II. This procedure resulted in a total of
10 data points for each concentration spiked with UIC and 10 data points for
each concentration without the UIC.
Competitive inhibition of the UIC was assessed by comparing the percent of
samples detected with and without the UIC for HAdV at 1 x 100 TCID /mL
50
and at 1 x 10-1 TCID /mL. Competitive inhibition was to be considered if the
50
presence of the IC decreased the sensitivity of the ProAdeno+ Assay.
No competitive inhibition at the assay LoD was observed for detection of
HAdV in the presence of UIC using the ProAdeno+ Assay.
g. Assay cut-off:
The “cutoff value” represents the fluorescent intensity signal (reported in
Relative Fluorescent Units) at which a “positive” reaction reaches a relative
fluorescent intensity above the background or baseline of a “negative”
reaction. If a sample exceeds the threshold in a detection channel during
PCR, the sample is considered positive for that channel. If the sample does
not exceed the threshold for a detection channel by the last PCR cycle, the
sample is considered negative for that channel.
Cutoff values (RFUs) were determined upon completion of the Cutoff
Determination Study which used a training set of simulated samples. The
training set of 56 samples contained:
• High and low level HAdV-1 spiked NP swabs with UIC
• High and low level HAdV-3 spiked NP swabs with UIC
• Negative NP swab samples with UIC

• Negative NP swab samples without UIC
Two operators each ran the set of 56 samples.
In addition to the simulated samples described above, a panel consisting of
Negative Controls (viral transport medium control spiked with UIC) and the
HAdV Positive Control were run by the two operators.
The cutoff values resulting from the Cutoff Determination Study were then
verified in the Cutoff Confirmation Study against a set of 42 HAdV positive
NP swab samples, 36 negative NP swab samples and Controls.
The cutoff values used in the Cutoff Determination and Confirmation Studies
are presented in the following table:

*Established during assay development
Threshold settings were determined and confirmed as FAM (HAdV) = 40 and
Cy5 (UIC) = 35. These settings produced 100% sensitivity and specificity for
the verification set of samples used for Cutoff Confirmation and met
acceptance criteria for this study. Therefore, the cutoff values were confirmed
as acceptable for use in the clinical study and analytical studies.
h. Carry-over/Cross-Contamination
This study assessed the level of carry-over/cross-contamination with the
ProAdeno+ Assay by testing simulated human adenovirus (HAdV) High
Positive samples run in series with HAdV Negative samples over 5 runs. The
High Positive samples consisted of negative nasopharyngeal (NP) swab
matrix spiked with a level 5 logs above the Limit of Detection (LoD) of a
cultured and titered strain of HAdV-1. The samples were processed and
extracted in a High Positive/Negative alternating fashion (i.e. checkerboard
pattern) on the extraction instruments and likewise processed and run on the
Cepheid SmartCycler II instrument in an alternating fashion.
Eleven High Positive and eleven Negative samples and a Negative Control
were extracted per run on the easyMAG and on the MagNA Pure LC for a
total of 110 High Positive samples and 110 Negative samples over 5 runs for

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with reference methods:
The performance of the ProAdeno+ Assay was compared with rapid culture
(shell vial) followed by direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) screening and
identification.
b. Matrix Comparison:
Analytical performance of the ProAdeno+ Assay using six different viral
transport media (VTM) was evaluated. Analytical sensitivity was determined
using six serotypes of cultured and titered HAdV (one from each species)
spiked into each of the six different VTM. After the initial testing, the
samples were stored at 2-8ºC and tested again after 72 hours to demonstrate
stability.
The six VTM tested were Remel M4, M4RT, M5, and M6, Copan Universal
Transport Medium (UTM), and Becton Dickinson Universal Viral Transport
(UVT). The intended use of these VTM is for the transport of clinical
specimens containing viruses, chlamydiae, mycoplasma, and ureaplasma from
the collection site to the laboratory for microbiological procedures. The
exception is M4RT which is not recommended for the transport of
mycoplasmas and ureaplasmas. The VTM have essentially the same
components as shown in the table below.

Cultured and titered strains of HAdV-1, HAdV-3, HAdV-31, and HAdV-41
were spiked at one log above, at and one log below LoD; HAdV-4 was spiked
at LoD, and one and two logs below LoD; HAdV-19 was spiked at one log
above, at, and one and two logs below LoD into each VTM type. Testing at
concentrations two logs below LoD was performed because higher
concentrations resulted in 100% detection. Differences in Analytical
Sensitivity between NP swab matrix (as used in the Analytical Sensitivity
Study) and VTM alone (as used in the present study) are are not unusual and
VTM alone typically results in a lower LoD. Following the initial testing time
point, a second testing time point was performed after storage at 2-8ºC for 72
hours.
All VTM were compared to Remel M4 to determine equivalence because that
was the VTM used in all other analytical verification studies, including the
Analytical Sensitivity study, as well as by the majority of the Clinical Trial
sites. For a VTM to be considered equivalent to M4:
i. All three replicates for at least one concentration were required to be
positive and within one log of the lowest concentration in which all 3
replicates of M4 were positive.

ii. The average Ct values at all concentrations in which 3 of 3 replicates
were positive should not differ by more than 3.3 Ct from the average
Ct of that concentration diluted in M4. If the sample differed by more
than 3.3 Ct, the media are not considered equivalent.
Each of the VTM gave equivalent performance to Remel M4 as they all met
the required criteria described above. Detailed data are presented in the

ProAdeno+ Assay Package Insert specifies that controls should not undergo
more than 1 freeze-thaw cycle. Although internal studies demonstrated that
up to 2 freeze-thaws of controls would not adversely affect performance. To
mitigate risk it is recommended they not undergo more than 1 freeze-thaw.
Comparison between Fresh and Frozen Specimens
An analytical study was carried out to determine the potential effect on the
ProAdeno+ Assay of freezing NP samples and purified DNA. Contrived
samples were generated using aliquots from a negative NP swab pool spiked
individually with six human adenovirus (HAdV) serotypes (HAdV-1, HAdV-
3, HAdV-4, HAdV-19, HAdV-31, HAdV-41). A sufficient number of fresh
HAdV positive NP swab samples were not available for this study due to low
prevalence of the virus during the sample collection period. Contrived
samples were made at varying concentrations in negative NP swab matrix
such that approximately 60%-80% of the samples had analyte levels close to
the cutoff. Of these samples, approximately half were close to the C (LoD)
95
and the other half were Moderate Positive (3-4 X LoD) samples. The
remaining positive samples covered the full detection range of the assay.
Therefore, for each of the six serotypes, fifteen samples were generated (n =
90) in the following manner: 1 sample each at 3 logs, 2 logs, and 1 log above
LoD, 6 samples at 3x LoD, and 6 samples at LoD. After sample generation, a
portion of each sample was freshly extracted on the bioMérieux NucliSENS
easyMAG. The remaining portions of the samples were frozen at ≤-70ºC and
later extracted as described above. The nucleic acids were run fresh
(immediately subsequent to extraction) in a single replicate. The remaining
nucleic acids were frozen at ≤ -70°C and later thawed on ice and subjected to
PCR as described above. The data was analyzed for the effect of freezing NP
samples and purified nucleic acids on the ProAdeno+ Assay. The following
tables summarize the results of the study:

These results show that there is no negative affect due to freezing sample or
nucleic acids when the sample and resultant nucleic acids have each been
subjected to a freeze-thaw cycle.
d. Extraction Efficiency:
Assessment of the equivalence of the two extraction methods was determined
by several approaches: (1) Two of the clinical testing sites tested clinical
samples using the MagNA Pure LC system while the other two clinical sites
used the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG instrument. (2) The Reproducibility
study included both extraction systems. (3) Limits of Detection were
determined on six serotypes and were within 1 log across both extraction
instruments for each serotype.
Based on the results from these studies, there does not appear to be any
significant difference in the performance of the ProAdeno+ Assay using either
the MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation kit or the NucliSENS
easyMAg system.
3. Clinical studies:
Clinical performance of the ProAdeno+ Assay was established at four external
sites using prospectively collected fresh samples and prospectively collected
archived samples. The prospective study with fresh samples was conducted at
four U.S. clinical laboratories during October 2009 thru August 2010. Due to the
overall low prevalence of human adenovirus (HAdV), fresh prospective samples
were supplemented with prospectively collected archived samples to evaluate
clinical performance. The prospectively collected archived samples were
collected at one site from December 2009-February 2010.
The ProAdeno+ Assay was compared to culture followed by direct fluorescent

antibody (DFA) staining to determine clinical sensitivity and clinical specificity.
Two of the clinical sites used the MagNA Pure LC system while the other two
clinical sites used the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG instrument. A total of
1167 nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples were tested with the ProAdeno+ Assay
and by culture/DFA. One sample that initially gave unresolved results remained
unresolved upon retesting with the ProAdeno+ Assay and was not included in the
analysis.
All samples used for this study were remnants of NP swab specimens that were
collected from symptomatic individuals for routine analysis and that otherwise
would have been discarded. Individual specimens were delinked from all patient
identifiers and given a study sample code. All clinical sites were granted waivers
of informed consent by their IRBs for this study. Inclusion criteria included, but
were not limited to: the specimen was from a symptomatic patient (for respiratory
infection); the specimen was an NP swab in appropriate transport media; the
specimen contained adequate volume for performing the ProAdeno+ Assay; age
and gender information were available; specimen was stored properly; sample
collection date and time were known; and initiation of the ProAdeno+ assay
(nucleic acid extraction) took place within 72 hours of sample collection.
The clinical performance of the ProAdeno+ Assay is summarized in the following
table.

NucliSENS easyMAG™ System (bioMérieux)
®
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Cepheid Smart Cycler II Real Time instrument with Dx software version
1.7b, 3.0a, or 3.0b is used to perform polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
amplification and detection of nucleic acid. Other nucleic acid amplification tests
that use the Smart Cycler II instrument have previously received 510(k)
clearance: these tests include Prodesse’s ProFAST+ Assay (K101855),
ProParaflu+ Assay (K091053), ProGastro Cd Assay (K090239), ProhMPV+
Assay (K082688) and others. The Cepheid SmartCycler instrument is an
integrated nucleic acid amplification and detection instrument system based on
Cepheid’s proprietary microprocessor-controlled I-CORE module. For purified
DNA samples, the SmartCycler instrument enables PCR for the amplification of
DNA and hybridization of fluorogenic target-specific probes for the detection of
the amplified cDNA.
The Roche MagNA Pure LC is an automated nucleic acid isolation and
purification system based upon binding of nucleic acids to glass particles and has
the capability to process a total of 32 reactions within one run. Nucleic acid is
purified in multiple plastic reaction tips and cartridges by several steps that
include cell lysis and binding of nucleic acid to magnetic glass particles, wash
steps, and a heated elution to unbind the nucleic acid from the glass particles.
The bioMérieux NucliSens easyMAG is an automated nucleic acid isolation and
purification system that is based upon the same silica extraction technology as the
MagNA Pure. The easyMAG is capable of processing a total of 24 reactions with
variable sample types, sample volumes, and elution volumes within a single run.
Nucleic acid is purified within a single cartridge by several steps that include lysis
and binding of nucleic acid to high affinity magnetic silica beads, a series of wash
steps and heated elution of purified nucleic acid from the silica beads.

5. Calibration:
Not applicable
6. Quality Control:
Positive Control (PC): The ProAdeno+ Assay kit contains an Adenovirus positive
DNA control that consists of a non-infectious plasmid containing a portion of the
targeted gene (hexon). The PC does not go through nucleic acid isolation and
purification, but is included during set-up of the PCR reaction. The PC in
conjunction with the UIC is used to verify reagent and system performance.
Universal Internal Control (UIC): The UIC contains an Internal DNA Control
(generated by PCR) and is recognized by the UIC primers and probe present in
the ProAdeno+ Assay. The UIC is incorporated into every sample and is carried
through all steps of the procedure from nucleic acid isolation and purification
through amplification to monitor for inhibitors present in the specimen or reaction
tube. The UIC serves also as a general process control ensuring that each step of
the procedure was performed correctly, assay and instrument parameters were set
correctly, and that general reagents were working.
Negative Control (NC): A Negative Control is not provided with the kit, but is
required and described in the ProAdeno+ Assay Instructions for Use. Viral
transport medium spiked with the UIC is to be used as the Negative Control and is
processed starting from nucleic acid isolation. The Negative Control serves to
monitor for contamination.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
the “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Not applicable
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
