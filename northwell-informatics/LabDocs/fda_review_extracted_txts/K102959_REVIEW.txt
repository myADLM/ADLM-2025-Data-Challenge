H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The PROLYTE is an automated, microprocessor-controlled analyzer which utilizes ion-
selective electrodes for the measurement of sodium, potassium, and chloride in whole
blood, plasma, serum, and pre-diluted urine samples.
The PROLYTE Sodium Assay is intended to measure sodium in whole blood, plasma,
serum, and urine on the PROLYTE Electrolyte Analyzer. Measurements obtained by this
device are used to monitor electrolyte balance in the diagnosis and treatment of
aldosteronism (excessive secretion of the hormone aldosterone), diabetes insipidus
(chronic excretion of large amounts of dilute urine, accompanied by extreme thirst),
adrenal hypertension, Addison's disease (caused by destruction of the adrenal glands),
dehydration, inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, or other diseases involving
electrolyte imbalance.
The PROLYTE Potassium Assay is intended to measure potassium in whole blood,
plasma, serum, and urine on the PROLYTE Electrolyte Analyzer. Measurements
obtained by this device are used to monitor electrolyte balance in the diagnosis and
treatment of diseases conditions characterized by low or high blood potassium levels.
The PROLYTE Chloride Assay is intended to measure the level of chloride in whole
blood, plasma, serum, and urine on the PROLYTE Electrolyte Analyzer. Chloride
measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of electrolyte and metabolic
disorders such as cystic fibrosis and diabetic acidosis.
For In Vitro Diagnostic Use

PROLYTE Electrolyte Analyzer
I. Device Description:
The PROLYTE is an automated, microprocessor-controlled analyzer which utilizes ion-
selective electrodes for the measurement of sodium, potassium and chloride in serum,
plasma, whole blood and pre-diluted urine samples. The PROLYTE analyzer is fully
automated with ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ commands for menu navigation. The analyzer can be
programmed to self-calibrate using Mission Diagnostics Fluid Pack Na/K/Cl (k031159) at set
intervals or on request. Sodium, potassium and chloride are commonly measured for use in
the diagnosis and management of patients with a broad range of renal, metabolic and
cardiovascular disorders. Mission Controls (k033063) are the recommended quality control
material to be used daily.

L. Test Principle:
The principles of measurement used in the PROLYTE Electrolyte Analyzer are identical to
those principles existing in the Predicate electrolyte analyzer, PROLYTE (k070104).
The PROLYTE measures sodium, potassium and chloride in whole blood, serum, plasma,
and urine, using ion selective electrode technology. The sodium electrode contains a glass
tube, specially formulated to be sensitive to sodium ions. The potassium incorporates a
neutral carrier ionophore membrane. The chloride contains an ionophore covalently bound to
a substrate which is sensitive to negatively charged ions. The potential of each electrode is
measured relative to a fixed, stable reference established by a silver/silver chloride electrode
in concentrated salt solution. The measured potential varies with the concentration of the ion
sensed by the electrode.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Five whole blood, serum, plasma, and urine samples were analyzed. The sample
concentrations were at the low, near mid point, and high end of the reference ranges,
and at the low and high end of the reporting limits for each analyte.
Within run precision was calculated with results from 30 replicates of each sample
without calibration between measurements. The replicates were run consecutively in
one day. The results are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated by preparing stock solutions with high concentrations of Na+,
K+, and Cl- in whole blood, plasma, serum, and urine. These stocks were diluted (15%
or 20% serial dilutions) to concentrations across the measuring ranges of each analyte
and matrix. Linear regression was performed on results of all test points (duplicates or
triplicates at each concentration) using expected values calculated based on the stock
sample dilution. The results are shown below to support the claimed reportable range
(mEq/L).

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators were previously cleared under k031159.
d. Detection limit:
Reportable ranges were determined based on the linearity studies (see above, b).
e. Analytical specificity:
Plasma samples were prepared with high and low concentrations of sodium (130 and
150 mEq/L), potassium (3 and 5 mEq/L), and chloride (85 and 115 mEq/L).
Clinically significant interferents were selected and tested based on NCCLS EP7-A2.
The results of samples with the tested interferent were compared to samples without
interferent. No interference was defined by the sponsor as a difference of <2 mEq/L
for sodium, <0.25 mEq/L for potassium, and <2.8 mEq/L for chloride.
In the labeling, the sponsor stated that:
Bromide 24 mg/dL (3 mmol/L), and Thiocyanate 116 mg/L (2 mmol/L) interfere with
the assay, causing at least 2 mEq/L positive bias to Chloride result, with the error
increasing with increasing concentration of the interferent.
The following compounds did not interfere with the results: Bilirubin at 29 mg/dL
(500 uM), Triglycerides at 2650 mg/dL (30 mM), Albumin at 12g/dL, Bicarbonate at
40 mEq/L and Salicylic acid at 690 mg/L (5 mM). Lithium at 3.2 mEq/L did not have
a significant effect on Sodium result.
Interference by Hemoglobin was not tested. However, the following statement was
given in the labeling as limitations of the test: “Potassium concentrations in
erythrocytes are much greater than in extra-cellular fluids and hemolysis would
increase potassium concentrations in extra-cellular fluids.” “If you suspect a sample
has hemolyzed, draw a fresh sample.”
f. Assay cut-off:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor recommends in the labeling that the values given in the tables below are
intended to be used only as a guide. Each laboratory or testing site should establish its
own range of normal values, taking into account factors such as age, sex, diet, and other
determinants of electrolyte levels.
Whole Blood, Serum, Plasma (mmol/L or mEq/L)
Sodium (Na+) 135 to 148
Potassium (K+) 3.5 to 5.3
Chloride (Cl-) 98 to 107
Urine (mmoL/L or mEq/L) spot
Sodium (Na+) 40 to 220
Potassium (K+) 25 to 120
Chloride (Cl-) 110 to 250
