L. Test Principle:
The Eu-tTG IgA and Eu-tTG IgG tests are sandwich type enzyme immunoassays.
The wells of a microtiter plate are coated with human recombinant tissue
transglutaminase. Antigen-specific antibodies in the patient serum bind to the
antigens. Non-specific antibodies are removed by washing. Horseradish peroxidase
labeled goat anti-human IgA or IgG are added and bind to human antibodies in the
well. The excess conjugate is washed away; then a chromogenic substrate is added.
After an appropriate incubation period, the OD value is measured using an ELISA
microtiter plate reader capable of measuring OD at 450 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: There is no recognized standards for this analyte.
Calibrators: Calibrators are prepared in-house from dilutions of the pooled
serum of tTG antibody from patients with Celiac disease, obtained from
various commercial plasma centers. Arbitrary units are assigned during the
development process. As new lots of calibrators are developed, studies are
performed to calibrate values against original calibrators, that are previously
approved lot of calibrators. Each lot of calibrator is also tested in comparison
with normal human sera, clinical samples and internal standards. The
concentration values of the calibrators are as follows:
Calibrator IgA (AU/mL) IgG (AU/mL)
S1 0 2
S2 10 10
S3 20 20
S4 50 50
S5 100 100
Controls: Positive and negative controls are prepared in-house and with an
assigned range of concentrations. The new lot of positive or negative control
should fall into the assigned range.
Controls (AU/mL) Assigned range
Eu-tTG IgA
Positive Control 30-75 AU/mL
Negative Control < 5 AU/mL
Eu-tTG IgG
Positive Control 35-65
Negative Control < 6 AU/mL
Stability:
Shelf-life: The shelf life was determined by using 3 lots of the test kit in real
time stability studies. The claimed shelf life for the test kits is 12 months
when stored at 2-8°C.
Open vial stability: Five calibrators were stored at 2-8°C for two months and
then tested. The claimed shelf life stability is 2 months when stored at 2-8°C.
Sample stability: Specimens should be stored at 2-8°C for no longer than five
days. For longer storage, serum specimens should be frozen at -20°C.
Repeated freezing and thawing of samples should be avoided.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity (detection limit) of the Eu-tTG IgA and Eu-tTG IgG
were evaluated in accordance with CLSI Standard EP17-A. The limit of
blank (LoB) was determined by running six serum diluent samples (buffer

The limit of detection (LoD) was determined and calculated by running six

each, for a total of 60 measurements.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference by endogenous substances:
Interference was studied according to EP 7-A2. Five serum samples with
known tTG antibody levels were mixed with potentially interfering
substances. The study included two positive, one negative and two around the
cut-off samples with known concentrations of the anti-tTG antibodies were
tested with bilirubin (342 μmol/L), hemoglobulin (Hb, 2 g/L), lipid,
(triglycerides, 130 mg/dL) and rheumatoid factor (RF, 100 AU/mL). The
sponsor states that there is no significant interference up to the levels stated
above. The package inserts included a statement stating, “Do not use
hemolyzed, hyperlipemic, hemolytic, heat-treated or contaminated serum
samples.”
Cross reactivity to other autoantibodies: Cross reactivity was tested using a
total of 73 clinical patient samples from individuals with autoimmune
disorders, such as: Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis, Graves’ Disease, Antinuclear
Antibodies/Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (ANA/SLE) positive and Cyclic
Citrullinated Peptide (CCP) positive; patients with IBD and H. pylori
infection. One (1) CCP positive, two (2) Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis and
one (1) Graves’ Disease out of 73 samples (4/73, 5.5%) were tested positive
for Eu-tTG IgA. One (1) Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis and two (2) Graves’
Disease out of 73 samples were tested positive with the Eu-tTG IgG (3/73,
4.1%).

e. Assay cut-off:
CLSI C28-A2 was used to perform the cut-off study. The normal range of the
assay was established by testing 153 samples, of which 103 are healthy
subjects and 50 non-celiac controls (IBD patients), on each assay. The assay
cut-off was calculated by the mean plus 3 standard deviations of the detection
levels for the tTG IgA and tTG IgG from the healthy subjects, respectively.
The assay cut-off for the Eu-tTG IgA was determined to be 9 AU/mL.
When cut-off value is 9 AU/mL, 146 out of 153 negative samples (95.4%)
were identified as negative. The remaining 7 samples fell in the range of
9-14.8 AU/mL, and are considered borderline. The assay cut off values of the
Eu-tTG IgA was determined as follows:
<9 AU/mL Negative
9-16 AU/mL Borderline
>16 AU/mL Positive
The assay cut-off for the Eu-tTG IgG was determined to be 20 AU/mL. When
using this cut-off value, 150 out of 153 negative samples (98.0%) were
identified as negative. The assay cut off value of the Eu-tTG IgG was
determined as follows:
<20 AU/mL Negative
≥20 AU/mL Positive
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The Eu-tTG IgA assay kit was tested in accordance to CLSI EP-A2.
For the tTG IgA, these samples consisted of 62 samples from clinically
diagnosed (biopsy confirmed) celiac patients and 117 samples from
blood donors and other disease/conditions. For tTG IgG, 51 of the 178
samples were from clinically diagnosed celiac patients including 8
samples from IgA deficient patients and 127 samples from blood
donors and other disease/conditions. tTG IgA concentrations of the
tested samples were within the linear range of the assay. The table

Discrepant Result Analyses – Four samples tested negative with the Eu-tTG IgA
were positive with the predicate. Out of these four (4) samples, two were from
Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) patients and two from food intolerance
patients. Two negative samples (one healthy and one IBD) tested positive with
the Eu-tTG IgA but negative with the predicate were around the borderline
concentrations, 9 to16 AU/mL.
