L. Test Principle:
Cholesterol: Cholesterol esters are hydrolyzed to cholesterol and fatty acids by cholesterol
esterase (CHE). Then the cholesterol is oxidized by cholesterol oxidase (CHO) to produce
cholest-4-en-3-one and hydrogen peroxide (H O ). H O reacts with 4-aminoantipyrine (4-
2 2 2 2
AAP) and phenol under the catalytic action of peroxidase to form a colored quinoneimine
complex. The absorbance of the quinoneimine complex at 505 nm is proportional to the
concentration of cholesterol in the sample.
Triglycerides: Triglycerides are hydrolyzed to glycerol and fatty acids by a lipoprotein lipase.
In the presence of ATP and glycerol kinase, the glycerol is phosphorylated to glycerol-3-
phopshate, which is then oxidized by glycerol-3-phosphate-oxidase to produce hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2). H2O2 reacts with 4-amino-antipyrine (4-AAP) and p-chlorophenol under

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Cholesterol assay:
A linearity study was performed according to the CLSI EP6-A guideline. Linearity
across the assay range was determined by using two pools of patient serum, one at a
low concentration (20 mg/dL) and one at a high concentration (618 mg/dL). The low
sample was prepared by diluting the serum sample pool with saline and the high
sample was prepared by spiking the serum sample pool. Admixtures were prepared
by mixing different proportions of low and high pool samples. All samples (11
samples) were assayed in triplicate. The expected values were plotted against the
observed values and a linear regression line was fitted with the following regression
equation: Y = 0.9854X + 2.5152, R2 = 0.9994.
Results of the study support the sponsor’s claim that the cholesterol assay is linear
from 20-600 mg/dL.
Triglycerides assay:
Similarly, linearity across the assay range was determined by using two pools of
patient serum, one at a low concentration (26 mg/dL) and one at a high concentration
(1072 mg/dL). The low sample was prepared by diluting the serum sample pool with
saline and the high sample was prepared by spiking the serum sample pool.
Admixtures were prepared by mixing different proportions of low and high pool
samples. All samples (11 samples) were assayed in triplicate. The expected values
were plotted against the observed values and a linear regression line was fitted with
the following regression equation: Y = 0.9932X – 1.4687, R2 = 0.9997.
Results of the study support the sponsor’s claim that the triglyceride assay is linear
from is 30-1000 mg/dL
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The ELITech Clinical Systems Elical 2 has both cholesterol and triglycerides assays
traceable to the ID-MS (Isotope Dilution- Mass Spectrometry) reference method.
Traceability to the National Reference System for Cholesterol was established by
performing a direct comparison with the cholesterol reference method using human
specimens that cover the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) medical
decision points. The ability to meet the NCEP’s performance criteria for accuracy
was demonstrated through testing and certification by the Cholesterol Reference
Method Laboratory Network (CRMLN). The comparison study was performed using
SEPPIM Cholesterol SL reagent and SEPPIM ELICAL 2 calibrator. A certificate
from CRMLN was provided by the sponsor. The certificate will expire in 2 years and
8

--- Page 9 ---
a list of the certified methods can be found at the following link:
http://www.cdc.gov/labstandards/crmln.htm
Stability:
Calibrator material is purchased from a commercial vendor (previously cleared under
k033501). Calibrator assigned value was verified by testing on one Selectra Junior
analyzer. The sponsor claimed the following for stability: Elical 2 is stable until the
expiration date printed on the label when stored at 2-8˚C prior to reconstitution. After
reconstitution the stability is 8 hours when stored at 15-25˚C, 2 days at 2-8˚C or 4
weeks (when frozen once) at -25˚and -15˚C.
Protocols and acceptance criteria were provided to support on-board calibration
stability for 28 days for cholesterol and 14 days for triglyceride.
Control material is purchased from a commercial vendor (previously cleared under
k041227). Control assigned value was verified by testing on one Selectra Junior
analyzer. The sponsor claimed the following for stability: Before reconstitution, the
shelf-life of the ELITech Clinical Systems Elitrol 1 and Elitrol II is 30 months at 2-
8˚C. After reconstitution the stability is 12 hours when stored at 15-25˚C, 5 days
when stored at 2-8˚C or 4 weeks (when frozen once) at -25˚ and -15˚ C.
Value assignment of Elical 2:
Elical 2 is tested against predetermined values on multiple Vital Scientific analyzers
using the cholesterol and triglyceride reagents. The mean analyte value is calculated
and a target value is assigned.
Value assignment of Elitrol I and II controls:
For both cholesterol and triglyceride assays, assignments are based on two Vital
Scientific analyzers with two lot of reagents. A total of 36 measurements were
obtained and the mean, SD and %CV were calculated. The control ranges were
established by calculating the mean ± 15% for cholesterol and mean ± 16% for
triglyceride.
d. Detection limit:
Cholesterol assay:
A detection limit study was evaluated according to CLSI EP17-A guideline. LoB was
determined by running a blank sample 60 times on the Vital Scientific Selectra Junior
analyzer. The limit of detection (LoD) was determined by assaying 4 low (3.6 U/L)
diluted sample pools 60 times on the Selectra Junior analyzer. Limit of Quantitation
(LoQ) was determined by running 4 low (5 U/L) diluted sample pools 60 times on the
Vital Scientific Selectra Junior analyzer. LoB is calculated to be 0.1 mg/dL, LoD is
9

--- Page 10 ---
0.2 mg/dL. LoQ is calculated to be 10 mg/dL based on a total error of 8.6%.
Triglycerides assay:
A detection limit study was evaluated according to CLSI EP17-A guideline. LoB was
determined by running a blank sample 60 times on the Vital Scientific Selectra Junior
analyzer. The limit of detection (LoD) was determined by assaying 4 low (3.6 U/L)
diluted sample pools 60 times on the Selectra Junior analyzer. Limit of Quantitation
(LoQ) was determined by running 4 low (5 U/L) diluted sample pools 60 times on the
Vital Scientific Selectra Junior analyzer. LoB is calculated to be 1 mg/dL, LoD is 2
mg/dL. LoQ is calculated to be 10 mg/dL based on a total error of 9.8%.
The sponsor claimed that the cholesterol’s measuring range is 20-600 mg/dL and
triglyceride’s measuring range is 30-1000 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cholesterol assay:
Testing for interfering substances was based on CLSI EP-7A. Testing was performed
on a minimum of five concentrations for each interfering substance. Two different
concentrations of cholesterol (116 and 309 mg/dL) were used for evaluation.
Samples with increasing amounts of triglycerides (Intralipid®), Unconjugated
bilirubin, Conjugated bilirubin, Hemoglobin, Uric Acid, Methyl dopa and Ascorbic
