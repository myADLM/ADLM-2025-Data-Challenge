from frozen tumor specimens using the Pathwork TOO Pathchip™. Precision and
reproducibility were measured by determination of %CV established from the fold
change of the probe set signal Pearson correlation coefficient.
Lot-to-Lot: To demonstrate lot-to-lot reproducibility three lots of AGP Reagent Kits
were tested using 100 ng and 1000 ng of MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC)
samples A and B (A = 100% Universal Human Reference RNA; B = 100% Human
Brain Reference RNA) total RNAs, tested in quadruplicate, and compared to three
lots of the Pathwork® Expression 3’-Amplification One-Cycle Target Reagents
(One-Cycle) using 1000 ng of total RNA from the same samples.
Operator-to-Operator: To demonstrate reproducibility of performance between
operators, three lots of AGP Reagent Kits were tested using 100 ng and 1000 ng of
MAQC A and B total RNAs tested in quadruplicate by three different operators and
compared to three lots of the One-Cycle Reagents using 1000 ng of MAQC A and B
total RNA in quadruplicate by three different operators.

Repeatability was evaluated from the replicates tested in the reproducibility studies
within test condition for the probe sets called present. The % CVs were calculated for
all replicates for the 3 lots of the AGP Reagent Kits tested on 3 different days using
both 100 ng and 1000 ng of MAQC A and B total RNAs and are compared to the 3
lots of the One-Cycle Reagent Kits tested on 3 different days using 1000 ng of the
same specimens. The calculated % CVs were <10% for all conditions and
representative values are shown in Table 3 below.

Input Total RNA and Copy RNA (cRNA) Yield:
Repeatability studies, for total RNA input and cRNA yield were also conducted at
two external sites. Eight replicates using 100 ng and 1000 ng of MAQC A and B
total RNAs were tested in batches (8 samples at minimum per batch) and the median
probe set signal %CV from detected probe sets was calculated for the replicates and
are shown in Table 4 below.

The amount of starting material to be used with the AGP Reagents was between 100
ng – 1000 ng total RNA and the reagents were tested at two external studies using
total RNA at the minimum and maximum amount of the input total RNA range. The
defined amount of total RNA was processed with the Transcript Synthesis and
Labeling Kit and the resulting amount of cRNA was measured
spectrophotometrically. The results showed that both 100 ng and 1000 ng of input
total RNA would yield sufficient cRNA to hybridization at least one microarray (≥ 20
µg cRNA) (see Table 5).

The .CEL files for the 100 ng samples received from Site 2 were analyzed and found
the performance of the Poly-A Control below the specifications for lys and phe due to
the use of an incorrect dilution of the Poly-A Control in the RNA Control Kit for the
100 ng of total RNA from MAQC A and B samples. The 16 samples were repeated
and the signal intensity of the Poly A controls was found to be adequate.
Reproducibility of cRNA yield using total RNA from human tissue specimens:
To demonstrate cRNA yield with the AGP Reagents, testing was conducted internally
by Affymetrix. One hundred nanograms (100 ng) of total RNA from ten
commercially available human tissues were run in triplicate using the Transcript
Synthesis and Labeling Kit (Kit 2). All replicates (100%, 30/30) of the samples
tested yielded greater than ≥ 20 µg cRNA and a cRNA concentration ≥0.625 µg/µL.
Data is provided in Table 6.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls:
The RNA Control Kit provides exogenous positive controls to monitor the entire
eukaryotic target labeling process. Each array contains probe sets for several B.
subtilis genes that are absent in the samples analyzed (lys, phe, and dap). The RNA
Control Kit contains in vitro synthesized, polyadenylated transcripts for these three B.
subtilis genes that are premixed at staggered concentrations to allow probe array users
to assess the overall success of the assay. The concentrated Poly-A Control can be
diluted with the Dilution Buffer and spiked directly into the RNA samples to achieve
the final concentrations (i.e., ratio of copy number) of: lys 1:100,000; phe 1:50,000,
and dap 1:6,667.
The spiked-in controls are then amplified and labeled together with the samples.
Examining the hybridization intensities of these controls on arrays helps users
monitor the amplification and labeling processes independently from the quality of
the starting RNA samples. An additional synthetic biotinylated control oligo (Oligo
B2) is included with the Transcription Detection kit and is added to the hybridization
solution. The resulting signals allow for image analysis alignment.
Performance of the Poly-A Control, Oligo B2 and hybridization controls were
evaluated by testing conducted internally at Affymetrix and at two external sites. For
internal evaluation, three lots of AGP Reagent Kits were tested using 100 ng and
1000 ng of MAQC A and B total RNAs tested in quadruplicate. The testing
conducted at the two external sites included eight replicates using 100 ng and 1000 ng
of MAQC A and B total RNAs in batches of a minimum of 8 samples. In both
studies, the Oligo B2 controls allowed all .CEL files to be successfully automatically
gridded for all samples. The analysis of the Poly-A Control showed the 3’ AFFX-r2-
Bs probe sets for all three spikes (lys, phe, and dap) were present with adequate signal
intensities.
Signal intensities and r2 values for the correlation of the 3’ AFFX-r2-Bs signal
intensities with the relative ratio for each spike, followed the relative concentration in
the Poly-A Control mixture: lys < phe< dap and the r2 values met the acceptance

present for all samples in both studies. The signal intensity for the hybridization
controls (bioB, bioC, bioD and cre) followed the relative concentration in the
mixture: bioB < bioC < bioD < cre for all samples tested in both studies. One hundred
percent of the samples passed the acceptance criteria for the performance of the
controls in the internal study (80/80) and the external study (64/64).
In addition the performance of the controls was evaluated in the clinical studies.
Forty-five total RNA samples were tested at each of the 3 clinical sites and 100%
(135/135) passed the acceptance criteria for the Poly-A Control, Oligo B2 and
hybridization controls resulting in successful .CEL files for analysis. Analysis of the
results from the testing of 16 total RNA samples isolated from frozen tissues at one
site, in duplicate, resulted in valid .CEL files from 100% (32/32) of the specimens.

Clinical performance of the AGP Reagents was performed in two parts using the
Pathwork TOO assay for fresh/frozen tissues at three external sites.
The first study utilized 45 total RNA specimens previously isolated from 15 human
tumor type specimens included in the Pathwork TOO test (k080896). Three
independent specimens of each tumor type, based on available diagnosis, were
included and consisted of bladder, breast, colorectal, gastric, germ cell,
hepatocellular, kidney, lung, lymphoma, melanoma, ovary, pancreas, prostate, soft

tissue sarcoma, and thyroid. Thirty-nine (39) of the 45 samples were the same or
comparable total RNA samples used in the Pathwork Reproducibility Study from
k080896 and six samples were received from a separate source. To ensure adequate
system performance of the Pathwork Tissue of Origin Test, each site was required to
verify and/or establish specimen characteristics and specifications during the study.
These characteristics and specifications included: the amount and purity of the total
RNA in the amplification reaction was at least 200 ng and ≥ 1.7 (A260/A280); the
labeled cRNA yield was at least >15 μg; that 15 μg of labeled cRNA was used in the
fragmentation reaction; 10 μg labeled cRNA was used for the hybridization reaction
and that Oligo B2 performed as expected.
Each site, using different lots of the AGP Reagent kits, processed the total RNA from
each specimen according to the step-by-step procedure for processing the total RNA
with the AGP Reagent kits. Only 39 of the 45 specimens were processed using the
One-Cycle reagents at two sites only. In both cases however, each site followed the
Pathwork Specimen Processing Guide for Frozen Specimens. The resulting data files
(.CEL files) were forwarded to Pathwork and processed by the TOO algorithm
version 21.2, standardization v6.2, an electronic report for clinical interpretation was
generated. For the study the input total RNA was 200 ng which produced sufficient
cRNA for the hybridization of one PathchipTM microarray (≥15µg). The clinical sites
and Pathwork Diagnostics were both blinded to each specimen’s available diagnosis.
All samples processed with AGP reagents passed provided results. However, all
samples processed with One-Cycle reagents did not meet the amount of labeled
cRNA generated. Predictions across runs from the two reagents consistently agreed or
disagreed with the available clinical diagnosis except for those situations when the
Similarity (SS) Scores are close to 30. Table 8 below shows the range of similarity
scores generated for the 39 specimens tested with both types of reagents. Agreement
with the available clinical diagnosis was not considered as a success criteria for this
study as the studies were not intended to redefine the performance of the Pathwork
TOO assay. Discrepancies found in this study mostly occurred near the decision-
making cut-offs (value of 30) which were defined by the assay manufacturer.

The three sites using AGP Reagents agreed on 43/45 samples in each case for an
overall concordance of 95.6%. The CV% values were found to be higher for the
[0,20], [20,40], and [40,60] SS ranges using the One-Cycle reagents than observed in
k080896. This may be due to the number of specimens whose scores fell within each
range. The worst comparison between One-Cycle reagents was 87.5%. The result of
the comparison between the results using the AGP Reagents versus the One-Cycle
reagents was 91.5%.
The second part of the prospective clinical study was conducted at a single external
site and included testing of 16 frozen tissues from RNA extraction to hybridization to
the PathchipTM microarray and subsequent analysis by Pathwork. Each of the 15
tumor types included in the Pathwork TOO Fresh/Frozen assay were represented by
the 16 specimens. The site and Pathwork were both blinded to the available diagnosis
of each tissue specimen. The resulting .CEL files were sent to Pathwork Diagnostics
for analysis.
The site extracted total RNA from the frozen tissue following the instructions
provided in the Pathwork Specimen Processing Guide for Frozen Specimens. The
total RNA extracted from each specimen was split for processing on a single lot of
each reagent. Two runs per reagent were performed. An external total RNA control
was added to each run. Predictions across runs from two different types of reagents
consistently agree or disagree with the available clinical diagnosis except for those
situations when SS are close to 30 in which case simple assay variation can cause a
SS to switch between being above or below 30. Table 9 below, shows the number
and average %CV shown for the specimens across runs when each reagent type was
used.

For four of the tissue samples, (GA, GC, LI and PA), the predictions from all four
runs were not identical but in all four cases, the SS that cause the change in prediction
are hovering right at the 30% cutoff. There were three samples for which the
prediction disagreed with the available clinical diagnosis for all four predictions, and
in all three cases, all four predictions were identical. The percent agreement between
