The Omega Laboratories Hair Drug Screening Assays are test systems that utilize
ELISA assays for the qualitative detection of morphine and related opiates
(calibrated with morphine) and oxycodone and hydrocodone (calibrated with
oxycodone) at or above 300 pg/mg in head hair samples.
The Omega Laboratories Hair Drug Screening Assay for Opiates, Oxycodone and
Hydrocodone provide only preliminary analytical test results. A more specific
alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed result. Gas
Chromatograph– Mass Spectrometry operating in the selected ion monitoring (SIM)
mode or GC/MS/MS in selected reaction mode (SRM) is the preferred method with
deuterated internal standards. Other chemical confirmation methods are available.
Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of
abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are obtained.
These tests are intended exclusively for in-house use only and are not intended for
sale to anyone. Omega offers these tests as services to its clients.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The assay is for Over the Counter Use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The screening assay is for use with an automated microplate reader capable of
measuring at 450 nm.
For confirmation testing, the sponsor uses an Agilent GC/MS in selected ion
monitoring (SIM) mode using deuterated internal standards.
I. Device Description:
The assay consists of the following:
• Hair sample collection kit
• Micro strip plates coated with either anti-morphine mouse monoclonal or anti-
oxycodone rabbit polyclonal antibody, enzyme conjugate (horseradish
peroxidase conjugated to morphine or oxycodone), substrate (containing
tetramethylbenzidine), an enzyme diluent, and wash solution
• In-house prepared calibrators and controls are used. These are prepared
solutions of morphine and oxycodone added to negative hair matrix tubes.

Screening Assay:
The test consists of two parts; a pre-analytical hair treatment procedure (to convert
the solid matrix of hair to a measurable liquid matrix) and the screening assay. The
screening assay is an Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA).
Sample is added to a well of the micro strip plate and enzyme conjugate is added,
followed by incubation. During this phase the enzyme-labeled drug conjugate competes
with drug in the sample for a limited number of binding sites on the antibody-coated
micro wells. The two bind in proportion to their concentrations. A wash solution is
applied to remove unbound materials. Enzyme substrate solution containing a
chromagen is added. The reaction is stopped with a stop solution and absorbance is read
using a plate reader at 450 nm. A background reading is also taken at 630 nm. Color
intensity is inversely proportional to the amount of drug presented in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed by taking commercially available materials
consisting of morphine in methanol, oxycodone in methanol and hydrocodone
in methanol (all with a Certificate of Analysis traceable to NIST) to prepare
spiking solutions at the following concentrations; negative, ±75%, ±50%, ±25%
and 200% of the cutoff. The concentration of each sample was confirmed by
GC/MS. The morphine and oxycodone solutions were then used to spike 11
replicates of negative hair samples. The hydrocodone solution was used to spike
10 replicates of negative hair samples. Intra-assay precision was performed in
one run and inter-assay precision was performed over 20 non-consecutive days
(10 non-consecutive days for hydrocodone). The results are presented in the
tables below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. This is a qualitative assay.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Commercially purchased materials consisting of morphine in methanol,
oxycodone in methanol and hydrocodone in methanol are used to prepare stock
solutions. Stock solutions of each are then used to prepare calibrator and control
working solutions. The Cerilliant morphine, oxycodone and hydrocodone
standards are traceable back to NIST.
Assigned values of the prepared calibrator and control working solutions are
verified by GC/MS analysis each time a new batch is prepared. The calibrator
must fall with 10% of the targeted concentration.
Protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable.
When stored refrigerated in an amber bottle the shelf life is 12 months.
Shipping Study:
260 samples were used in the shipping study which were tested for opiates,
oxycodone and hydrocodone: 155 previously confirmed positive samples, 100
previously screened negative samples, and 5 samples that were confirmed below
the 300 pg/mg cutoff. A variety of hair color and curvatures were tested.
Four separate shipping boxes each containing 25 previously screened negative
samples were stored in a freezer at approximately -11oC for approximately 17
hours then heated to approximately 44oC for a period of approximately 4 hours.
Four separate shipping boxes each containing 40 previously screened positive
samples were stored in a freezer at approximately -13oC for approximately 18
hours then heated to approximately 47oC for a period of approximately 4 hours.
Locations and minimum and maximum temperature and relative humidities are

This represented exposure to extreme temperatures and humidities. Each box
was then shipped to a different location in the US. The boxes were held for two
days at each location then shipped back to the laboratory.
The samples were run on both the screening method and GC/MS before and
after shipping. Results from the screening method showed that 256 of the 260
samples that were positive or negative before shipping remained the same after
shipping. There were 4 discordant results, where 2 samples that screened
positive prior to shipping screened negative after shipping and 2 samples that
screened negative prior to shipping screened positive after shipping. The
GC/MS concentrations of the samples prior to shipping and after shipping were
within +/-25% of the cutoff.
Sample Stability:
Fifty-four samples varying in ethnic origin, hair color and curvature that
previously confirmed positive were used in the study. Two different aliquots of
hair were used to perform the testing. Samples were stored in a temperature-
controlled room that averages 14oC to 30oC year round for periods of time
varying between 2.1 and 3.2 years. The average mean % of change in results
from first analysis to second analysis was 1% for morphine, -4% Oxycodone
and -5% for Hydrocodone. Morphine hair samples can be stored up to 3 years
and Oxycodone and Hydrocodone up to 2 years. The results are shown in the
table below:

d. Detection limit:
Sensitivity of this assay is characterized by validating performance around the
claimed cutoff concentration of the assay, including a determination of the
lowest concentration of drug that is capable of producing a positive result. This
information appears in the precision section, above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was established by preparing serial dilutions of each control
compound in negative hair matrix extract and evaluating against the cutoff
control.
Results are expressed as a minimum concentration of compound required to
produce a response approximately equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the
assay. The results are presented in the tables below:

Structurally related and unrelated:
Negative hair extracts were spiked with morphine or oxycodone to -50%, 125%
and 150% of the cutoff. Several (269) structurally related and unrelated
compounds were added to methanol to a concentration of 10,000 ng/mL then
added to the hair matrix tubes. Samples were evaluated in triplicate and the
listed compounds can be found in the package insert. Compounds that are not
structurally similar to morphine or oxycodone have not been observed to
produce an interference with the assay. There is the possibility that other
substances and/or factors not listed above may interfere with the test and cause
false results.
Hair Treatment:
Tests were performed to determine the effects of various hair treatments (i.e.
bleaching, dyeing, relaxer, shampoo, permanent) on samples tested using the
ELISA Opiates, Oxycodone and Hydrocodone screening test.
Effect on Positive Samples:
111 specimens were identified as positive for opiates, oxycodone and/or
hydrocodone. The ethnic origin, hair color and curvature were documented. The
study was conducted with two different hair treatments for each product. Two
different aliquots of hair from the same individual were used to perform the
testing. Each sample was divided into 2 aliquots. One aliquot was analyzed by
the ELISA protocol and GC/MS confirmatory tests. The second aliquot of each
sample was randomly assigned to the hair treatments groups (bleach,
permanent, dye, relaxer, shampoo). ELISA absorbance readings before and

Effect on Negative Samples:
Sixty five negative hair samples were each divided into 2 aliquots. One aliquot
of each sample was assigned randomly to the hair treatments. ELISA
absorbance readings before and after treatment were compared. GC/MS
measurements before and after treatment were also compared.
For negative samples the percent difference between the mean normalized
absorbance values of the treated and untreated groups was 10% or less for the
permanent, dye, and shampoo treatments.
The % change for the hair specimens treated with bleach and relaxer was greater
at a mean of 26% and 22%, respectively.
Environmental Contamination:
Preliminary positive hair sample results by the screening method could be due
to environmental contamination. All positive should be sent for confirmation
testing on a reference method to distinguish between true positive and those
samples that were positive due to external exposure.
f. Assay cut-off:
Analytical performance of the device around the claimed cutoff is described in
precision section M.1a above.
2. Comparison studies:
The study was performed by comparing ELISA results against the GC/MS results
on the same hair sample. A total of 176 donor hair samples were tested for opiates.
Those 176 samples plus 304 additional samples were tested for oxycodone and
hydrocodone. The hydrocodone showed two samples that tested positive on the
immunoassay however the GC/MS was unable to confirm due to sampling error and
they are excluded from the table below. The results are presented in the tables
