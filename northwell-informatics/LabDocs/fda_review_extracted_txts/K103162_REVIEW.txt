c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and Value Assignment
A Master calibration curve is generated on the MODULAR ANALYTICS
E170 / cobas e 601 / cobas e 602 analyzer and is used to calculate pg/mL
PTH in each CalCheck for value assignment. Each master calibrator is
standardized using a commercial PTH radioimmunoassay (RIA).
For each Elecsys PTH CalCheck 5 lot manufactured, the CalCheck
devices are assayed in duplicate on at least three MODULAR
ANALYTICS E170 / cobas e 601 / cobas e 602 analyzers (master
platform). The assigned value of each CalCheck is defined as the median
value obtained over at least 6 determinations (duplicate runs on at least 3
analyzers) of the respective CalCheck. The assigned range is calculated as
±30% of the assigned value (chosen as the sum of ±10% for between-
analyzer platform tolerance, ±10% for stability tolerance, and +10% CV of
the assay). The label states that each laboratory should establish
appropriate acceptance criteria when using this product for its intended
use.
To ensure the values assigned using the master platform are transferrable
and valid for the other instrument platforms, the value assignment process
is repeated for each additional analyzer and the assigned values are
compared to the values obtained on the master platform. The additional
analyzer assigned values must be within 10% of the values assigned using
the master platform. After this acceptance criterion is met, the assigned
values from the master platform are deemed valid for the Elecsys 2010 /
cobas e 411 immunoassay analyzers.

Stability
Open-vial and accelerated stability study protocols and acceptance criteria
were described. The data support the package insert claims that open-vial
reconstituted Elecsys PTH CalCheck 5 is stable for up to 5 hours at 20-
25°C, and that closed vial storage at 2-8°C provides stability for 18
months. The expiration date listed on each CalCheck bottle label reflects
this stability time of 18 months. A real-time stability study is ongoing.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
There are 5 levels of the CalCheck 5 kit which span the 1.2-5000 pg/mL
measuring range of the PTH assay (see Device Description under section I
above). The final assigned values are lot specific and are provided in the labeling.
There is a note in the labeling stating that the level 1 CalCheck recovers below the
detection limit.
If CalCheck 5 generated a result greater than 5000 pg/mL, the sponsor
recommends that the user perform a 1:1 dilution of CalCheck 5 with CalCheck 4
to determine whether it is within the assay measuring range or not. Dilution
studies were performed where CalCheck 4 and CalCheck 5 were mixed in a 1:1
ratio (as instructed in the draft package insert for dilutions) and measured in two-
fold determination. The PTH CalCheck 5 dilution values were within the assay
measuring range after dilution.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
