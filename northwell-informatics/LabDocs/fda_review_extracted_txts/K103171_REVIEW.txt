I. Device Description:
The Elecsys® Anti-TPO CalSet is a lyophilized product consisting of sheep anti-TPO
antibodies in a human serum matrix in two concentration ranges (approximately 35 IU/mL
and 350 IU/mL). The CalSet includes a barcode card, calibrator barcode sheet, 4 empty
labeled snap-cap bottles, 2X6 bottle labbels. The exact lot-specific calibrator values are
encoded in the barcode as well as printed in the enclosed (or electronically available)
calibrator barcode sheet. The CalSet package consists 4 bottles (reconstitution volume: 1.5
mL/ bottle): 2 bottles for calibrator 1, and 2 bottles for calibrator 2, and can be used with all
reagent lots.
