H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use:
FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) is a multiplexed nucleic acid test intended for use
with the FilmArray instrument for the simultaneous qualitative detection and
identification of multiple respiratory viral nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal swabs
(NPS) obtained from individuals suspected of respiratory tract infections. The
following virus types and subtypes are identified using the FilmArray RP: Adenovirus,
Coronavirus HKU1, Coronavirus NL63, Human Metapneumovirus, Influenza A,
Influenza A subtype H1, Influenza A subtype H3, Influenza A subtype 2009 H1,
Influenza B, Parainfluenza virus 3, Rhinovirus/Enterovirus, and Respiratory Syncytial
Virus. The detection and identification of specific viral nucleic acids from individuals
exhibiting signs and symptoms of a respiratory infection aids in the diagnosis of
respiratory viral infection if used in conjunction with other clinical and
epidemiological information. Negative results do not preclude respiratory viral
infection and should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other
management decisions. Positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-
infection with other organisms. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of
disease. The use of additional laboratory testing (e.g., bacterial and viral culture,
immunofluorescence, and radiography) and clinical presentation must be taken into
consideration in order to obtain the final diagnosis of respiratory infection.
Due to seasonal low prevalence, performance characteristics for Influenza A/H1,
Influenza A/H3, Influenza A/2009 H1, and Influenza B were established primarily
with retrospective clinical specimens.
Due to the genetic similarity between human Rhinovirus and Enterovirus, the
FilmArray RP cannot reliably differentiate them. A positive FilmArray RP
Rhinovirus/Enterovirus result should be followed-up using an alternate method (e.g.,
cell culture or sequence analysis).
The FilmArray RP detects Adenovirus species C serotype 6 with reduced sensitivity. It
is recommended that specimens found to be negative for Adenovirus after examination
using FilmArray RP be confirmed by an alternate method (e.g., FDA cleared
molecular test or cell culture).
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established when influenza A/2009
H1N1, A/H1, and A/H3 were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation.
When other influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary. If
infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and

epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities,
specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel
virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health departments for testing. Viral

I. Device Description:
The FilmArray RP pouch contains primers for the following respiratory pathogens:
Adenovirus, Coronavirus (HKU1 and NL63), Influenza A (with subtyping for
hemagglutinin genes H1, 2009 H1 and H3), Influenza B, human Metapneumovirus,
Parainfluenza virus (serotypes 3), Respiratory Syncytial virus, and
Rhinovirus/Enterovirus. The FilmArray RP pouch is a closed system disposable that
houses all the chemistry required to isolate, amplify and detect nucleic acid from
multiple respiratory pathogens within a single NPS specimen. The rigid plastic
component (fitment) of the FilmArray RP pouch contains reagents in freeze-dried form.
The flexible plastic portion of the pouch is divided into discrete segments (blisters)
which, through interactions with actuators and sensors in the FilmArray instrument, are
where the required chemical processes are carried out. The user of the FilmArray RP
system loads the sample into the FilmArray RP pouch, places the pouch into the
FilmArray instrument, and starts the run. All other operations are automated. A
summary of the FilmArray assays and targets is presented in the following table:

L. Test Principle:
The FilmArray RP System is multiplex nucleic acid test system composed of the
FilmArray instrument, the FilmArray software (preinstalled on a laptop computer) and
the FilmArray RP pouch. The FilmArray RP pouch contains freeze-dried reagents to
perform nucleic acid purification, reverse transcription, and nested, multiplex PCR with
DNA melt analysis. The Respiratory Panel (RP) pouch identifies the following 11
respiratory pathogens: Adenovirus, Coronavirus HKU1, Coronavirus NL63, Human
Metapneumovirus, Influenza A subtype H1, Influenza A subtype H3, Influenza A
subtype 2009 H1, Influenza B, Parainfluenza virus 3, Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus
and Respiratory Syncytial Virus.
A test is initiated by loading Hydration Solution and an unprocessed patient
nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimen (i.e. specimen mixed with Sample Buffer) into
the FilmArray RP pouch. The pouch contains all of the reagents required for specimen
testing and analysis in a freeze-dried format. The addition of Hydration Solution and
Sample/Buffer Mix rehydrates the reagents. After the pouch is prepared, the FilmArray
software guides the user though the steps of placing the pouch into the instrument,
scanning the pouch barcode, entering the sample identification and initiating the run.
The FilmArray instrument contains a coordinated system of inflatable bladders and seal
points, which act on the pouch to control the movement of liquid between the pouch
blisters. When a bladder is inflated over a reagent blister, it forces liquid from the blister
into connecting channels. Alternatively, when a seal is placed over a connecting channel
it acts as a valve to open or close a channel. In addition, electronically controlled
pneumatic pistons are positioned over multiple plungers in order to deliver the
rehydrated reagents into the blisters at the appropriate times. Two Peltier devices control
heating and cooling of the pouch to drive the reverse transcription reactions, the PCR
reactions, and the melting curve analysis. Nucleic acid extraction occurs within the
7

--- Page 8 ---
FilmArray pouch using mechanical lysis and standard magnetic bead technology. After
extracting and purifying nucleic acids from the unprocessed sample, the FilmArray
performs a nested multiplex PCR that is executed in two stages. During the first stage,
the FilmArray performs a single, large volume, highly multiplexed reverse transcription
PCR reaction. The products from first stage PCR are then diluted and combined with a
fresh, primer-free master mix and a fluorescent double stranded DNA binding dye (LC
Green®Plus, Idaho Technology Inc.). This second master mix solution, is then
distributed to each well of the array. Array wells contain sets of primers designed
specifically to amplify sequences internal to the PCR products generated during the first
stage PCR reaction. The second stage PCR, or nested PCR, is performed in singleplex
fashion in each well of the array. At the conclusion of the second stage PCR, the array is
interrogated by melting curve analysis for the detection of signature amplicons denoting
the presence of specific viral or bacterial targets A digital camera placed in front of the
second stage PCR captures fluorescent images of the PCR reactions in real time. The
FilmArray software automatically interprets the results of each DNA melting curve
analysis and combines the data with the results of the internal pouch controls to provide
a test result for each organism on the panel.
Sample purification
Nucleic acid purification occurs in the first three blisters of the pouch using magnetic
bead technology. Prior to loading the sample into the pouch, nucleases are inactivated by
mixing the sample with a denaturing buffer. The sample/buffer mixture is then loaded
into the pouch where it enters the large trapezoidal blister. The sample is lysed by
agitation with zirconia beads (bead beating) and the liberated nucleic acid is captured by
adsorption to suitably coated magnetic beads. The beads are then moved to a new blister
in the pouch were they are collected using a retractable magnet positioned adjacent to
the blister. The beads are first washed to remove proteins and cell debris. After the wash
steps are completed, an elution buffer is added to the blister and the nucleic acid is
released from the beads. The beads are then moved back to the trapezoidal blister and
the nucleic acid is moved to the 1st stage PCR blister.
Reverse transcription and 1st stage multiplex PCR
In the 1st stage PCR blister, the purified nucleic acid rehydrates a freeze-dried reagent
pellet containing all outer primer sets. Since many pathogens are RNA viruses, a reverse
transcription (RT) step is needed to convert the viral RNA into cDNA that can be
amplified by PCR. Both the RT and the first stage of the nested PCR reaction are
performed using the same outer primers and master mix. A PCR master mix, containing
all components needed for PCR and RT, is moved from the fitment to the appropriate
PCR1 blister in the pouch. A ‘hotstart’ PCR and RT is performed by preheating the
blisters containing the purified sample and the blister containing the PCR master mix.
Once the appropriate temperature is reached, the contents of the two blisters are mixed
and the RT step and thermocycling is initiated. Thermocycling consists of an RT step
(54°C hold for 3 minutes) followed by 26 PCR cycles (denaturation at 96°C for 4
seconds, annealing/extension 60°C for 19 seconds).
2nd Stage PCR and DNA melt analysis
Following completion of the RT and PCR1 steps, a second single product nested PCR
(PCR2) is carried out. PCR2 occurs in a 102-well array that has specific primers in each
well that nest within a particular 1st stage amplicon. To accomplish this, fresh PCR
8

--- Page 9 ---
master mix (without specific primers) is used to dilute the 1st stage reaction product,
(~100 fold final dilution) and the material is then flooded over the array where it
rehydrates the dried primers and provides a complete PCR reaction. Thermocyling is
initiated (30 cycles with a 94°C denaturation for 0 seconds and 63°C
annealing/extension for 19 seconds). The product of the 2nd stage PCR is visualized with
fluorescent LC Green® Plus (Idaho Technology Inc.) dye. At the conclusion of PCR2 the
array is interrogated by melting curve analysis for the detection of signature amplicons
denoting the presence of specific targets.
FilmArray Software Interpretation
The melt detector module of the FilmArray Analysis software assigns positive and
negative results to melt curves generated in each well of the PCR2 array based on
properties of the curve such as signal-to-noise, area under the curve, and melting
temperature (Tm). Each assay is present in triplicate wells distributed across the array. If
at least 2 out of 3 wells have positive melt curves with similar profiles, a positive result
is assigned to that assay. If less than 2 of the replicate wells have positive melt curves in
the Tm window, or if the curves are dissimilar, a negative result is assigned to the assay.
A meta-analysis determines the final result (Detected (positive), Not Detected
(negative), or Equivocal) for each RP organism. For organisms represented by a single
PCR2 assay, the assay result and organism result are the same. Results for Influenza A,
and Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus are determined by meta-analysis of multiple assay
results. Meta-analysis for Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus incorporates the results of 6
different assays (Entero 1, Entero 2, HRV1, HRV2, HRV3, and HRV4). The HRV
assays recognize both Rhinoviruses and Enteroviruses, while the Entero assays target an
insertion sequence in the 5’ UTR that is not found in Rhinoviruses. Any positive assay
result will produce a combined Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus organism result.
Organism results for Influenza A are determined by meta-analysis of multiple pan-
influenza A and subtype targeted assay results. The FilmArray RP System is designed to
both detect Influenza A and to differentiate commonly occurring hemagglutinin
subtypes. To accomplish this, the FilmArray RP uses two Influenza A assays, (FluA-
pan1and FluA-pan2) and three subtyping assays directed at the hemagglutinin gene (H1-
pan, H1-2009 and H3). The H1-pan assay is designed to detect Influenza A/H1,
including the Influenza A/2009 H1 variant. The H1-2009 assay specifically detects the
pandemic 2009 H1N1 variant. Meta-analysis for Influenza A is outlined in the following
table:

Influenza A H3 equivocal Negative Negative Negative Positive
Influenza A H1/2009 equivocal Negative Any result Positive Negative
*If both of the influenza A assays are positive, but none of the hemagglutinin subtyping assays are positive, then
the interpretation is ‘Influenza A (no subtype detected)’. This result could occur when the titer of the virus in the
specimen is low and not detected by the subtyping assays. This result could also indicate the presence of a novel
Influenza A strain. In both cases, the sample in question should be retested. If the retest provides a different result,
test the sample a third time to ensure the accuracy of the result. If the retest provides the same result, then the
function of the RP pouches should be verified by testing with appropriate external control materials (known
positive samples for Influenza A H1, Influenza A H3 and Influenza A 2009 H1) and a negative control reaction
should be run to test for PCR-product contamination. If the FilmArray RP accurately identifies the external
controls, contact local or state public health authorities for confirmatory testing.
In general, Influenza A is determined to be detected if at least one of the two FluA pan
assays is positive and the corresponding subtyping assay is also positive. If neither of the
pan assays is positive, but a subtyping assay is positive, then the result is considered
equivocal for that specific subtype and the sample should be retested. If one of the pan
assays is positive and no subtyping assay is positive, the result is Influenza A Equivocal
and the specimen should be retested. If both FluA pan assays are positive and no
subtyping assay is positive the result is reported as ‘Influenza A (no subtype detected).
The product literature instructs the operator to retest the specimen. If the ‘no subtype
detected’ result is repeated, the product literature directs the operator concerning
appropriate follow-up testing and, if needed, notification of public health authorities.
If either the RNA Process Control or the PCR2 Control fails (negative assay result), all
organisms are assigned an ‘Invalid’ test result. Invalid results are also assigned to all
assays if the FilmArray instrument protocol or analysis does not complete, an Instrument
Error is reported, or a Software Error is reported. All test specimens that receive
‘Invalid’ results should be retested.

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision/reproducibility study panel of twelve specimens (refer to the table below)
was created by spiking simulated NPS sample matrix with known quantities of live RP
organisms. The specimens in the panel were designed so that all 11 RP organisms
would be tested at three concentrations (3 x LoD, 1x LoD, and 0.1 x LoD). Several
analytes were spiked into each specimen to simulate the possibility of co-infections
with multiple pathogens at various levels. Human Rhinovirus (HRV) and Respiratory
Syncytial Virus (RSV) were included in more specimens than the other analytes
because they were the most common panel members detected in co-infected clinical
NPS specimens during the 2009-2010 prospective clinical evaluation performed by
ITI.

Following spiking, the composition of each specimen pool was verified by testing with
the FilmArray RP system. Pools that did not perform as expected were remade. Pools
that performed as expected were aliquoted into several individual use vials, and frozen
until the scheduled day of testing. Specimen aliquots were hand-delivered (Site A) or
shipped (Site B) to external testing sites on dry ice and stored frozen (-70°C) at each
testing site until the day of testing. All specimen aliquots were tested on the same day
they were removed from the freezer. The test operators at test sites were blinded to the
organisms and test levels in each specimen.
Reproducibility testing was performed at three (3) test sites (Site A, Site B, and Site C)
by multiple operators (4-5 per site) using multiple (26) lots of reagents and multiple
(20) FilmArray instruments. Each specimen was tested 4 times per day (2 operators

and 2 instruments per specimen) for 5 days at each site, giving a total of 20 test results
from each test site (a minimum of 60 total test results for each analyte at each
concentration).
Negative analyte results were derived from any specimen that was not spiked with the
analyte of interest. Every analyte was absent from at least six specimens, providing a
minimum of 360 expected negative results for each analyte all sites combined.
Between the three test sites, 20 different instruments were utilized. A total of 1,168
runs were initiated over the course of the study and 64 (5.5%) did not go to
completion. The incomplete runs consisted of Instrument Errors (46), Software Errors
(10), and 8 runs that were either aborted by the operator or failed to complete. The
majority of the instrument and software errors observed in this study (41/64, 64%)
were caused by a communication timing error between the FilmArray software and the
driver of the instrument camera. This error mode was fully investigated and software
engineers have resolved the underlying cause of the errors with an update to the
FilmArray software. All samples for which the run did not complete were retested to
obtain valid results.
At each test site between 4 and 5 operators participated in the study, with at least 2
different operators testing samples each day. The number of errors experienced by
each test site was similar, though the percentage was lower for Site C due to a higher
number of runs performed. The distribution of errors between operators at test sites A
and B was somewhat variable, but there did not appear to be a strong correlation
between system errors and particular operators.
Between the 3 test sites, twenty-six (26) different lots of FilmArray RP pouches were
used. A total of 1104 runs were completed and 1056 of those 1104 runs (95.6%)
passed all controls (positive RNA Process Control and PCR2 Control assay results). Of
the 48 failed runs, 8 were negative for both control assays. The remaining 40 failed
runs were negative for the RNA Process Control only. (Note: Due to the RNA Process
Control failure rate being higher than expected in the later months of the clinical
evaluation, the issue was investigated and it was determined that the existing quality
control process for determining the level of organism used as the control material
(yeast) was not adequately controlling the level of material in manufactured pouches.
The pouches affected were those manufactured after 3/8/2010. The manufacturing and
quality control process for determining the level of yeast has been improved to ensure
a consistent level of yeast in each pouch lot.) All samples for which the pouch controls
failed were retested to obtain valid results.
A summary of reproducibility study results for each analyte and a summary of Tm
reproducibility results for each assay are provided below:

*HRV1, HRV2 and HRV3 assays associated with samples containing Enterovirus were not considered in the overall evaluation
of the data due to a very small number of observations for the data set. HRV4 is the only HRV assay that is consistently positive
when testing at low concentrations of this Enterovirus (Echovirus 6).

*The number of expected negative results is lower than for other analytes because only 3 specimens (Specimens #1, 2 and 3) were not
spiked with either Enterovirus or Human rhinovirus, which both will produce positive Human Rhinovirus / Enterovirus results.

The repeatability of the FilmArray RP System results was evaluated by repeated
testing of the same 12 specimens while minimizing as many sources of variability as
possible. The in-house precision testing was performed at ITI (Site C) over the course
of 12 testing days for a total of 48 test results per specimen. On each day, all 12
specimens were tested 4 times by two operators on two FilmArray instruments. As
much as possible, instrument and operator were held constant for each specimen.
Results from the first 5 days of testing are included as the Reproducibility results for
Site C. All operators were instructed to retest any samples that produced Invalid test
results (failed controls or incomplete runs). Valid retest results were recorded as the
final result.
A summary of precision study results for each analyte at each test level is provided

Assay Controls
The FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) pouch contains two internal control assays:
1. The RNA Process Control targets an mRNA of the yeast, Schizosaccharomyces
pombe. During FilmArray RP pouch manufacture, whole yeast are freeze-dried
into the sample injection port of each pouch. When the test specimen is loaded
into the pouch, S. pombe is rehydrated and enters the pouch with the specimen.
The yeast nucleic acid is extracted, purified and tested simultaneously with
nucleic acids from the patient specimen. A positive result for the processing
control indicates that all steps in the process (nucleic acid extraction, reverse
transcription, PCR, melt, detection, and analysis) are functioning properly.
2. The second stage PCR (PCR2) control assay detects a synthetic DNA template
that is dried into triplicate wells of the array along with the corresponding
primers. A positive result indicates that PCR2 was successful.
The RNA Process Control and the PCR2 Control assays are used to Pass or Fail each
FilmArray RP pouch run. This combination of control assays monitors each of the
critical mechanical and chemical processes that occur in a pouch run, while limiting
the possibility of random control assay failures that could contribute to unnecessary
pouch failures.
External controls are not provided with the FilmArray RP System. However, four (4)
frozen (-70°C) external control mixes were provided to the clinical study sites for daily
testing during the prospective clinical trial. Three control mixes contained pooled NPS
specimens spiked with whole organisms with some plasmid DNA for hard to acquire
organisms. Combined, the 3 mixes covered all panel analytes. A fourth mix was
negative for all panel members and only contained pooled NPS:

The operators were required to complete a valid control mix run (correct results
obtained) prior to beginning patient sample testing on each testing day. A total of 300
control mix runs were attempted. Seventeen (17) runs did not complete and 6 runs had
failed pouch control(s). Of the remaining 277 runs (site 1, 99 runs; site 2, 70 runs; and
site 3, 108 runs), 7 (site 1, 1 run; site 2, 2 runs; and site 3, 4 runs) (7/277; 2.5%) did not
return the correct organism results either due to the detection of an extra analyte (4/7)
and/or the failure to detect one or more spiked analytes (4/7). These failures may be
due to low level virus from the NPS donors, introduction of contamination during the
preparation or testing of the samples, or improper handling of the frozen aliquots.
The sponsor is also recommending the following in the product package insert:
“Good laboratory practice recommends running external positive and negative
controls regularly. Use viral transport medium as the external Negative Control, and
previously characterized positive samples or negative sample spiked with well
characterized target organisms as external Positive Controls. External controls
should be used in accordance with local, state, federal accrediting organizations, as
applicable.”
Specimen Stability
An analytical study was performed to establish the recommended transport and storage
conditions for nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens that will be tested using the
Film Array Respiratory Panel System.
For the specimen transport and storage evaluation, both positive and negative
specimens were assessed. Positive specimens consisted of simulated NPS (cultured
human epithelial cells in VTM) spiked with mixes of targeted organisms at 5 x the
limit of detection (LoD) Negative data were collected from specimens that had been
spiked with a different organism mix, such that results for the organism(s) of interest
were expected to be negative. Ten independent specimens were prepared for each
organism mix and tested “fresh” or without storage (0 Hour). Additional aliquots were
made and two aliquots of 10 specimens per mix were stored at each of the conditions
described below. Duplicate aliquots were stored for each specimen to allow for
retesting if needed. For each RP organism, 10 positive and 30 negative specimens were
evaluated at each storage condition. At least 9/10 positive results were required for
each organism at each storage condition. In addition to positive and negative results,
the average crossing point (Cp) of amplification curves and melting temperature (Tm)
of melt curves were reviewed for each assay at each storage condition. A shift in Tm
or Cp from one storage condition to another could indicate that the integrity of the
specimen was affected by storage. However, these data were used only as a secondary
analysis tool and acceptance or rejection of a storage condition was based on the
FilmArray result.

In addition, the average crossing point (Cp) of amplification curves and melting
temperature (Tm) of melt curves were also reviewed for each assay at each storage
condition. The difference in average Cp (Δ Cp) and average Tm (Δ Tm) between the
test storage condition and the initial (0 Hour) test result was calculated for each assay.
When Δ Cp for all assays was reviewed, no general trend toward later Cps (decreased
sensitivity or fewer templates) was observed for any one particular storage condition.

The results of this study support the claim that NPS specimens in Viral Transport
Medium (VTM) can be stored for up to 4 hours at room temperature (18-30°C), 3 days
in the refrigerator (2-8°C) or 30 days in the freezer (< -15°C) without affecting the
accuracy of FilmArray RP test results.
Preservation of Vacuum for Pouch Hydration and Sample Loading and Stability
of Reagents and Control Material after Hydration and Loading of a Pouch
To maintain pouch integrity and reagent stability, pouches are packaged in an
aluminum canister, which is then sealed under vacuum in opaque mylar outer
packaging. This packaging design maintains the pouch under vacuum and limits
exposure of the pouch to light until the packaging has been opened and the pouch
removed. Ideally, a pouch is hydrated and sample loaded immediately after the pouch
packaging is opened, and the loaded pouch is immediately placed in the FilmArray
instrument for testing. However, laboratory workflow and instrument availability may
result in a pouch being opened before a sample can be loaded, or a pouch to be loaded
before an instrument is available for testing.
The FilmArray product literature recommends the loading and testing of pouches
immediately or within a limited timeframe (30 minutes for pouch loading and 60
minutes for testing a loaded pouch).
Analytical testing was performed to discover whether the integrity and performance of
an opened pouch is affected by longer times outside of the vacuum-sealed packaging
prior to loading and testing.
Pouches were removed from outer packaging and exposed to air at ambient
temperature for various times up to 24 hours. The preservation of vacuum for pouch
hydration and sample loading was evaluated by loading blank simulated NPS (sNPS)
samples (no target analytes present) according to standard procedure. The volume of
each solution (hydration solution and sample/sample buffer mix) drawn into the pouch
was recorded and the loaded pouches were then tested to observe the performance of
the internal controls assays. The control results from these same pouches were used to
assess reagent stability. Overall, the measures of performance for these tests included
the efficiency of pouch hydration and sample loading, visual inspection of pouches,
and the results (pass or fail) of internal control assays (RNA Process Control and
PCR2 Control).
The stability of reagents and control material after hydration and loading of a pouch
was also examined. Pouches were hydrated and loaded with blank sNPS sample (no
analytes present) according to standard protocol directly after removal from outer
packaging. The loaded pouches were then stored under ambient conditions for various
times up to 24 hours. The results of internal control reactions (pass or fail) were
assessed to determine whether system performance was affected by storage of a loaded
pouch prior to testing. In addition, four (4) replicate pouches were loaded with
contrived sample containing live respiratory pathogens (Influenza A H1N1, human
Metapneumovirus, Parainfluenza virus 3 and Respiratory Syncytial Virus) at
concentrations both above and below the estimated system LoD. The loaded pouches
were stored at ambient temperature for 8 hours prior to testing. The results of both
39

--- Page 40 ---
internal control and analyte assays from these 4 pouches were compared to 8 control
pouches that were loaded with the same contrived sample but tested without storage
(immediately after loading).
Each tested handling condition was considered successful if the variables (including
mean Cp for the relevant assay) evaluated were equivalent (within 3 cycles for Cp) to
that of the control sample (test at time 0 after pouch opening or loading). Any
handling condition that resulted in improper pouch hydration, sample loading, failed
control results, or unexpected negative analyte results was repeated to confirm the
result. If the result was repeatable, then the integrity and/or stability of the pouch were
considered diminished under the handling condition that caused the failure.
The data presented in the table below demonstrated that pouch vacuum was preserved
for up to 24 hours after the removal of a pouch from its outer packaging, allowing for
proper pouch hydration and sample uptake.

In conclusion, the data supports the conservative recommendations in the FilmArray
product package insert for the loading and testing of pouches within a limited
timeframe (30 minutes for pouch loading and 60 minutes for testing a loaded pouch).
Fresh vs. Frozen Study
In order to utilize frozen banked clinical samples in the evaluation of FilmArray
Respiratory Panel System to supplement the prospective clinical study data, an
analytical study was conducted to demonstrate that preservation of samples (by
freezing at ≤-70°C does not affect the accuracy of test results compared to freshly
collected or freshly prepared samples.
The “fresh vs. frozen” analytical study was carried out as part of a larger
reproducibility study using samples that had been stored at ≤-70°C for as long as 30
days. The test samples were prepared in bulk and tested immediately after preparation
(fresh) prior to storage. The fresh sample tests provided a baseline of performance to
which the results from subsequent testing of the frozen samples was compared.
A panel of twelve specimens was created by spiking simulated NPS sample matrix
with known quantities of live RP analytes. The specimens in the panel were designed
so that all RP analytes would be tested at different concentrations. Multiple analytes
were spiked into each specimen to simulate the possibility of co-infections with
multiple pathogens. Human Rhinovirus (HRV) and Respiratory Syncytial Virus
(RSV) were included in more specimens than the other analytes because they were the
most common panel members detected in co-infected clinical samples during the
2009-2010 clinical evaluation performed by ITI. Immediately after sample preparation
(spiking), each fresh specimen pool was screened with the FilmArray RP system to
establish ‘baseline’ or expected results. The remaining specimen volume was then
aliquoted into several individual use vials, and frozen until the scheduled day of testing
(up 30 days frozen at ≤-70°C). Specimen aliquots were hand-delivered or shipped to
external testing sites on dry ice and stored frozen until the day of testing. All specimen
aliquots were tested on the same day they were removed from the freezer.
In total, at least 120 samples were tested for each analyte at (1X) or near (3X) the LoD
determined in the LoD studies. All contrived samples consisted of live organism
spiked into negative simulated nasopharyngeal swab sample matrix. (Note: The
simulated sample matrix consisted of human cells in viral transport media (VTM) and
was validated in “Validation of a Simulated NPS Sample Matrix for Use with the

FilmArray Respiratory Panel System”. The validation study demonstrated that the
sensitivity of the FilmArray RP system was comparable between samples prepared in
nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and simulated NPS sample matrices.) Since the nature
NPS samples are required to be diluted in VTM before being tested by the FilmArray
RP System, the simulated NPS matrix consisting of VTM and epithelial cells is
considered to be similar enough to the nature matrix (i.e., NPS in VTM) for the
purpose of this study.

d. Detection limit:
Analytical studies were carried out to determine the LoD for each FilmArray
RP targeted organism.
A preliminary estimate of sensitivity for many RP analytes was determined as part of
the “FilmArray RP Melt Detector Tuning” study using limiting dilutions of single
organisms spiked into negative NPS specimens. Based on these preliminary results,
initial estimates of LoD were set by spiking negative NPS specimens with serial 10-
fold dilutions of quantified live virus. Where possible, each stock organism was re-

Coronavirus HKU1 could not be re-grown for verification despite multiple attempts.
Instead, clinical specimen containing a high viral load of the virus of interest were
quantified by non-FilmArray real-time PCR against a standard curve of synthetic RNA
transcript (Coronavirus HKU1) to obtain quantification of the stock material in RNA
copies/mL, respectively. The identity of the virus contained in the clinical specimen
was verified by bi-directional sequencing. The single-spiked specimens were then
tested with the FilmArray RP System. The lowest concentration of organism for which
all or most replicates were assigned a positive (detected) result by the FilmArray
software was selected for additional testing in multi-spiked specimens.
Multiple organisms were combined and tested as a mix (multi-spike; see the table
below) in replicate NPS specimens at a single concentration or as a dilution series
centered on the estimated LoD. Results from single-spiked and multi-spiked
specimens were compared to determine whether the presence of multiple
organisms in a specimen would affect the system LoD.

Both percent detection (% positive) and Cp values were used to compare results for
single-spiked and multi- spiked specimen data sets. It was concluded that multi-
spiking and single-spiking results were substantially equivalent, since the % detection
was within 25% for the two data sets and/or the mean Cp values were within 3 cycles.
(Note: Based on an observed Cp standard deviation for replicate samples of about 1-2
cycles, a 3 cycle difference is a conservative estimate of the expected variation when
testing near LoD and does not indicate a significant difference in sensitivity.)
Additional LoD testing and confirmation of LoD for primary strains was then
performed with multi-spiked specimens. Coronavirus HKU1 was not included in a
multi- spiked mix for this study. Coronavirus HKU1 LoD was confirmed as a
single-spiked sample but was shown in subsequent studies to be detected at single-
spiked LoD levels when tested in multi-spiked specimens.
As needed, adjustments to the concentration of individual organisms within a multi-
spiked mix were made prior to confirmation of final LoD concentrations.
Confirmation of the system LoD for each organism included testing of 20
independent multi-spiked specimens at LoD and an additional 20 specimens spiked
10- fold below LoD (0.1 x LoD). For confirmation, at least 19/20 positive results
were required for each organism at the LoD concentration and fewer than 95%
positive results were required at concentrations below LoD.
Additional sensitivity testing was performed on one or more alternate strains of
several RP organisms. The majority of testing and LoD determination using

alternate strains of organism was performed by military laboratory personnel at
USAMRIID (United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious
Diseases). These alternate strains represented different major subgroups of common
respiratory viruses (Adenovirus, Human Metapneumovirus, Human Rhinovirus and
Respiratory Syncytial Virus) and isolates of Influenza A and B from different
decades and geographic locations. Each alternate strain was tested as 10-fold
dilutions around the previously determined LoD.
Note: Although this testing was performed in part to demonstrate that the FilmArray RP system can
detect various species and strains of an organism with similar sensitivity, it is difficult to make
comparative sensitivity evaluations between different organisms and different strains that have been
quantified by TCID . This quantification method measures the infectivity and cytotoxicity or lethality
50
of an organism in tissue culture and is therefore subject to many influences (strain-to-strain differences
in infectivity, viability of the original material, culturing conditions, etc.). Quantification by infectivity
assay will not be equivalent between strains or organisms. Also, since the measurand for the FilmArray
system is nucleic acid, LoD concentrations established in TCID can vary dramatically between targets,
50
but may not actually reflect significant differences in sensitivity of detection as measured by target
nucleic acid concentration.
During the early stages of LoD testing, it was discovered that some NPS specimens
collected from apparently healthy individuals did in fact contain respiratory
pathogens (mostly Rhinovirus). As a result, a simulated NPS (sNPS) sample matrix,
consisting of cultured human epithelial cells (HeLa) in Viral Transport Medium,
was evaluated for use in LoD confirmation testing and subsequent analytical studies.
The sensitivity of the FilmArray RP system with this simulated sample matrix was
found to be comparable to a sample matrix comprised of pooled NPS collected from
healthy individuals. The simulated NPS sample matrix was used for final LoD
confirmations and all subsequent analytical studies. (Note: Refer to “Validation of
Simulated NPS Sample Matrix for the FilmArray Respiratory Panel System” study
for the results of a side-by-side comparison of multi-spiked specimens prepared in a
collected NPS sample matrix versus a simulated NPS sample matrix.)
Throughout the LoD studies, crossing point values (Cps) were utilized as a
supplement to % detection data. However, the significance of these numbers should
not be over-interpreted, as the FilmArray RP is a qualitative rather than quantitative
system. Cp assignments in this nested multiplex PCR system may not be as
quantitative or reproducible as in traditional real-time PCR. In addition, positive
results may still be obtained for targets with negative amplification curves (no Cp)
due to detection by the more sensitive melt curve analysis.
Summary results for the LoD confirmation studies using primary strains and additional
sensitivity testing of alternate strains are presented below by organism:

e. Analytical Reactivity:
The analytical inclusivity study was performed to determine whether the
FilmArray RP System is able to detect a variety of strains (inclusivity panel) that
represent the temporal and geographic diversity of each of RP target organism.
This study expanded upon the limit of detection studies by determining whether
different strains of the same organism can be detected at similar concentrations.
(Note: Some differences in sensitivity may be expected as a result of sequence
diversity within the gene targeted by the RP assay primers as well as differences
in quantification of organisms based on infectivity (TCID ) rather than nucleic
50
acid concentration.)
This study involves testing panels of various inclusivity strains organisms spiked into
simulated NPS specimens using the FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) System.
Inclusivity organisms were initially tested near the limit of detection (LoD) for each
organism as determined in the LoD study. If a specimen containing a particular strain
was positive (detected) at the LoD level, no further testing of that strain was required.
If a strain was not detected at the LoD concentration, the strain was retested at the
LoD level and 10-fold higher. If necessary, the same approach was followed until a
positive result was obtained or the maximum concentration possible for that strain
stock had been tested.
The inclusivity panel represents the evolutionary, temporal, and geographical diversity
of the RP analytes. For example, the inclusivity panel includes 17 different Adenovirus
serotypes representing species A, B, C, D, E and F, over 20 Influenza A strains
(subtypes H3, H1 and 2009 H1) isolated from around the world as many as 77 years

ago (1933) and as recently as 2009, and 25 strains of the group that comprised of
Human Rhinovirus A and B, Enterovirus, Echovirus, and Coxsackievirus. However,
for some analytes, the inclusivity panel is restricted to only 1 or 2 strains because of
limited strain diversity and availability.
For inclusivity (reactivity) testing, a total of 99 individual RP target organism strains
were tested and accurately identified with the FilmArray RP system. Each of the 99
strains tested in this study were reactive with the FilmArray RP system. The sensitivity
of detection for Adenovirus C serotype 6 was 10,000-fold less than the system LoD
due to sequence variation (mismatches) within the primers of the second stage PCR
reaction. The limited detection capability of the FilmArray RP system for this
Adenovirus serotype was described in the FilmArray RP intended use as “The
FilmArray RP detects Adenovirus species C serotype 6 with reduced sensitivity. It is
recommended that specimens found to be negative for Adenovirus after examination
using FilmArray RP be confirmed by an alternate method (e.g., cell culture).”
Summary tables of Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity) Testing with the FilmArray
RP System are presented below:
(Note: With a few exceptions as indicated in the tables, all organism stocks were
obtained from Zeptometrix, ATCC, BEI Resources and the University of Iowa
Center for Emerging Infectious Disease (CEID). These organism stocks were grown,
quantified and verified by Zeptometrix Corporation (Buffalo, NY) prior to testing
with the FilmArray RP system.)

aAlignment of the FilmArray RP primers with Adenovirus serotype 6 sequences demonstrated that there are a number of
mismatches between the serotype 6 sequence of the Hexon gene and both outer and inner primers contained in the FilmArray RP
pouch. It was found that the mismatches do not affect the efficiency of first stage PCR (PCR1) but that there is at least a 3000-
fold reduction in amplification efficiency (relative to serotype 1) for the second stage (PCR2) reaction with the serotype 6
template.

a The 5’UTR sequences of these strains were aligned with the outer and inner PCR primers for the HRV assays to determine
whether sequence mis-matches may be contributing to the somewhat reduced sensitivity of the FilmArray RP system for
these strains. Primers for at least one of the 4 HRV assays (inner primers) aligned very well with published sequence for each
strain (0 – 1 mismatches in the primer region), suggesting that the observed differences in sensitivity are likely attributable to
inconsistencies in quantification of the viral stock rather than the sensitivity of the assay(s) themselves.

Supplemental Adenovirus Reactivity Information (clinical study data and in silico
analyses):
A subset of prospective and retrospective archived clinical specimens that were
FilmArray positive for Adenovirus was subjected to PCR and bi-directional sequence
analysis. BLAST analysis of the sequence data obtained for a region of the
Adenovirus polymerase gene identified adenovirus species B (serotypes 3, 3+11p, 7,
16 and 21), species C (serotypes 1, 2, and 5), and species E (serotype 4) in these
clinical specimens. Species B, C and E are the most common Adenovirus species
associated with respiratory illness. Species A, D, and F (often associated with
conjunctivitis and gastroenteritis) were not identified in clinical specimens,
In addition to laboratory testing, bioinformatics resources were also used to predict
reactivity of additional Adenovirus species and serotypes with the FilmArray RP
System. Simulated reactivity was based on the number and location of mismatches
between the target sequence and the assay primer(s). Table below lists the adenovirus
types that were not tested by the FilmArray system either in analytical or clinical
testing. Bioinformatics analysis of these adenovirus sequences indicate that the
FilmArray RP system is likely to react with all Adenovirus species and serotypes.

Supplemental Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus Reactivity Information (clinical
study data and in silico analyses):
In addition to the analytical inclusivity testing, BLAST analysis was performed on
sequence data (5’ UTR) obtained from prospective and retrospective archived clinical
specimens that were FilmArray positive for Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus. The
following species and subtypes were identified in clinical specimens:
Enterovirus Species A: Enterovirus serotype 71
Coxsackievirus A2 and A6
Enterovirus Species B: Echovirus serotypes 3, 6, 7, 11, 15, 21 and 30
Coxsackievirus B1, B3 and A9
Enterovirus serotypes 81 and 88
Rhinovirus Species A: Human Rhinovirus serotypes 1B, 8 ,9 ,10, 13, 19, 21,
22, 23, 28, 30, 32, 34, 38, 39, 40, 46, 47, 49, 51, 54,
56, 58, 59, 61, 62, 66, 68, 75, 77, 78, 80, 82, 98 and
100
Rhinovirus Species B: Human Rhinovirus serotypes 27, 69, 83 and 91
Rhinovirus Species C: At least 3 individual strains and 12 distinct isolates*
* Human Rhinovirus species C (also known as Enterovirus species D) has not been
classified into serotypes.
Simulated reactivity of the FilmArray RP Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus assays with
Enterovirus Species C Poliovirus strains was generated using a bioinformatics
approach. Alignment of assay primer sequences with the GenBank sequences
indicates the FilmArray RP assay is likely to react with Poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3,
giving a Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus result.

Simulated reactivity of the FilmArray RP Influenza assays with additional influenza
strains of human, swine and avian origin was generated using a bioinformatics
approach. Assay primer sequences were aligned with GenBank sequences
corresponding to the appropriate gene targets and reactivity were predicated based on
the number and location of mismatches in the targeted region. For each strain, multiple
(3) GenBank IDs were evaluated, corresponding to the gene segments targeted by the
FilmArray RP assays (matrix (MA), non-structural (NS) and hemagglutinin(HA)).
The strains listed in the following table are predicted to react with the pan-influenza A

An analytical exclusivity study was carried out to assess the potential for false
positive results due to cross-reactivity between RP assays and other RP or non-RP
organisms. RP organisms and non-RP organisms were tested at high
concentrations and the non-RP organism exclusivity panel consisted of organisms
that are related to, but distinct from, RP target organisms, or that could be present
in specimens collected from the intended test population.
Exclusivity (cross-reactivity) testing was performed at Idaho Technology, Inc. and an
external testing site (USAMRIID – United States Army Medical Research Institute
for Infectious Diseases). Samples were prepared by spiking RP and non-RP target
organisms into NPS (or simulated NPS) sample matrix at a high concentration (105
TCID /mL for viral targets and 106 CFU/mL for bacterial targets, or the highest
50
concentration possible based on the organism stock concentration).
The RP target exclusivity panel included all of the primary strains used to
establish LoD levels for the system plus additional strains of some common
organisms such as Influenza A and B. RP target organisms tested at high
concentrations were positive only for the appropriate RP assay(s). No cross-
reactivity between RP assays was observed.
The following tables list all of the RP organisms tested at high concentration. The test
concentration is listed followed by the multiple of the LoD concentration the test
concentration represents.

The non-RP target exclusivity panel consisted of 45 bacteria, 12 viruses, and 1 fungus
(Candida albicans). The organisms included in the non-RP exclusivity panel were
selected either because they are related to RP target organisms, are clinically relevant
(colonize the upper respiratory tract or cause respiratory symptoms), are common skin
flora or laboratory contaminants, or are microorganisms for which much of the
population may have been infected (Herpes Simplex Virus, etc.). None of the
organisms in the non-RP target exclusivity panel were tested positive by the
FilmArray RP System assays except for one measles virus strain. The false positive
was found to be caused by Adenovirus contamination of the viral stock and not due to
cross-reactivity between the Adenovirus assay and Measles virus.
The following table lists all of the non-RP organisms tested at high concentration. The test
concentration is listed:

Exclusivity Information (in silico analyses):
Laboratory testing of influenza strains was supplemented with in silico predictions of
exclusivity using bioinformatics and sequence alignments between FilmArray RP
assay primers and GenBank sequences for the strains shown in the table below.
Exclusivity was predicated based on the number of and location of mismatches
between assay primers and available strain sequences. For each strain, multiple
GenBank IDs were evaluated, corresponding to the genes targeted by the FilmArray
RP pan-influenza A and HA subtyping assays. All listed strains are predicted to
produce an Influenza A (no subtype detected) FilmArray RP result.

Supplemental SARS Coronavirus Exclusivity Information (in silico analyses):
In silico analysis of SARS virus sequence (GenBank ID NC_004718.3) against
primers for each of the two non-SARS coronavirus assays (CoV HKU1 and CoV
NL63) was conducted. When non-SARS coronavirus assay primers were aligned with
the corresponding target sequence from SARS virus, each primer contained at least 6
mismatches. Based on these alignments, no reactivity was predicted between SARS
virus and the 2 FilmArray RP non-SARS coronavirus assays.
g. Assay cut-off:
Melt Windows Determination:
Sequence diversity results in a range of melting temperatures (Tms) of the PCR2
melting curves for each of the target organism amplicons generated by the FilmArray
Respiratory Panel (RP). For each RP organism there is a mean melting temperature at
which PCR2 products from most isolates will melt. The range surrounding that mean
is where amplicon from less common isolates are expected to melt. The width of each
range is assay specific, and is used in the FilmArray meta-analysis software to ensure
specificity in organism detection. Thousands of clinical samples would need to be
tested from isolates spanning geography and time in order to estimate the temperature
ranges for each organism experimentally. An alternative approach is to utilize a
theoretical melt prediction model to determine the assay specific melt ranges. Within
NCBI databases, tens to thousands of sequences encompassing the PCR2 amplicon
region for each RP organism are available. These sequences have been submitted by

laboratories worldwide. Sequence submissions include isolates from as far back as a
century. Using these sequences to predict the melt temperature ranges for each
organism provides an up to date and diverse sample selection.
A mathematical model was used to predict the melting temperatures of all known
organism variants (within NCBI databases) for each assay. The distribution of
predicted Tms was used to establish an initial melt range for each assay. In addition to
sequence variability, the melt ranges must also account for instrument, chemistry,
pouch lot and other sources of variability. This overall system variability, or the
characteristic system standard deviation, was estimated using a synthetic template data
set, in which 17 templates with known amplicon sequence were melted on various
FilmArray instruments using multiple pouch lots. Historical RP Panel melting data
were also considered to establish appropriate melt ranges. In particular, the Analytical
Inclusivity data and all available patient specimen data from the clinical evaluation
sites were considered. These data sets included overall system variability and
potentially included additional organism sequence variants not accounted for in the
NCBI databases. Furthermore, data collected at the beta sites were used as an overall
check and validation for the proposed melting ranges.
For each of the pathogen assays, the lower limit of the melting window was calculated
as the minimum of the model prediction based on published sequence variation, the
clinical evaluation data, and the inclusivity data minus three times the characteristic
standard deviation of the synthetic template data. The upper limit of the melting
window was calculated as the maximum of the model prediction based on published
sequence variation, the clinical evaluation data, and the inclusivity data plus three
times the characteristic standard deviation of the synthetic template data:

For each of the control assays, the Tms for all data in the IVD RP Inclusivity test, clinical
evaluation set, and the synthetic template testing set were collected. For each assay, the
mean and standard deviation of the melting temperatures were computed. The required four
degree melt window around the mean gives the melting windows specified in the following
table:
Control Assay Mean Std Dev Range Lower Limit Upper Limit
PCR2 76.46 0.35 2.79 74.5 78.5
yeastRNA 82.55 0.34 2.76 80.6 84.6
Melt Windows Validation
The validation of the melting windows was done in two steps. First, the Tms for the
data collected at the beta sites were compared to the melting windows proposed. This
comparison did not identify any Tm outside of the proposed ranges. Second, as part of
the FilmArray RP Melt Detector Tuning, multiple data sets collected by the IVD and
R&D groups and data collected at the clinical evaluation sites were re-analyzed using
the proposed melting ranges. This validation did not identify any missed calls as a
direct result of the window location.
h. Interfering Substances:
Interference study was carried out to evaluate the influence of potential interfering
substances on the accuracy of test results obtained with the FilmArray RP System.
Four different organism mixes (refer to the tables below) containing FilmArray RP
analytes were spiked into a simulated NPS (sNPS) sample matrix (human epithelial
cells in VTM) at 5 x their respective LoDs. The 5 x LoD organism concentration was
chosen to be near the analyte LoD but also to provide consistent results for sample-to-
sample comparison.

specimen collection. Endogenous substances like blood, mucin, human genomic DNA
and various infectious microorganisms were evaluated. Exogenous substances that
may be introduced into NPS specimens before or during sample collection, such as
medication, treatments, or topical applications for treating symptoms associated with
respiratory infections, were also included in this study. (Note: An additional evaluation
of potential interference from medications (prescription and over-the-counter) was
included in the prospective clinical evaluation of the FilmArray RP System.) In
addition, materials used to collect (swabs) or store (viral transport medium) NPS
specimens or substances that could be introduced from the clinical laboratory
environment (i.e., bleach, etc.) were tested as potential technique-specific interfering
substances.
Potentially interfering test substances were spiked at a level predicted to be above the
concentration of the substance likely to be found in an authentic NPS specimen. The

On each day of testing, one specimen per organism mix was not spiked with any test
substance, to serve as a positive control. For biological test substances that may
contain genetic material (such as blood, mucin, DNA, microorganisms), one negative
specimen (blank sNPS sample matrix with no organism mix) was spiked with only the
test substance (negative control) to evaluate the potential for false positive results due
to the test substance itself. For each endogenous, exogenous, and technique-specific
test substance, one specimen per organism mix was spiked with the appropriate
amount of test substance. All specimens were tested with the FilmArray RP System on
the day they were prepared.

None of the potentially interfering endogenous, exogenous, or technique-specific
substances tested in this study were found to affect the accuracy of respiratory
pathogen detection in simulated NPS specimens using the FilmArray RP System.
FluMist® nasal influenza vaccine
Simulated nasopharyngeal swab (sNPS) specimens were spiked with dilutions of
FluMist nasal influenza vaccine (MedImmune, 2009-2010 version), resulting in final
test concentrations of 10%, 1% and 0.1% (v/v) FluMist. Each specimen was tested
with the FilmArray RP system to determine if the vaccine material would react with
any of the FilmArray RP assays. If reactivity was observed at any or all dilutions,
additional dilutions were tested until no reactivity was observed.
FluMist® Influenza Vaccine Live, Intranasal; Intranasal Spray, 2009-2010 Formula
was provided by the manufacturer (MedImmune). The material was provided as
individual sprayers containing a single 0.2mL dose. Each dose contains approximately
106.5-7.5 FFU (fluorescence focus units) each of three live, attenuated influenza virus
reassortants including: A/SouthDakota/6/2007 (H1N1) (A/Brisbane/59/2007-like),
A/Uraguay/716/2007 (H3N2) (A/Brisbane/10/2007-like), and B/Brisbane/60/2008.
Non-viral components of the vaccine listed in the provided materials include:
monosodium glutamate, gelatin, arginine, sucrose, gentamicin sulfate, monobasic
potassium phosphate and dibasic potassium phosphate. (Note: For the 2009-2010
respiratory season, a separate 2009 H1N1 variant vaccine was prepared and
administered. The 2009 H1N1 variant vaccine material was not provided by the
manufacturer for testing with the FilmArray RP system.)
Positive results were obtained for Influenza A/H1, Influenza A/H3, and Influenza B in
each of the samples tested at 10%, 1% and 0.1% (v/v) FluMist. Additional dilutions
were made and tested until each of the Influenza viruses could no longer be detected
by the FilmArray RP system (0.0001% for Influenza A H1, 0.00001% for Influenza A
H3 and 0.000001% for Influenza B). There was no reactivity with the Influenza
A/2009 H1N1 subtyping assay, which specifically detects the pandemic 2009 A/H1
variant and was not included in the 2009-2010 FluMist formulation.
This reactivity is documented in the FilmArray RP System product package insert as a
“limitation”.
In addition to the analytical interference substances study, the prospective clinical
dataset was analyzed for evidence of the effects of potentially interfering medications
(prescription and over-the-counter; OTC) administered to or taken by the study
population. If clinically significant interference from medications had occurred, it
would be expected that the analyte detection rate in the medicated population would be
lower than that in the non-medicated population. This effect was not observed in the
clinical dataset. One or more analytes was detected by the reference/comparator
methods in 110 of 256 (43%) non-medicated individuals. The FilmArray RP system
correctly identified all analytes in 104 (94.5%) of these individuals. One or more
analytes was detected by the reference/comparator methods in 313 of 597 (52%)
medicated individuals. The FilmArray RP system correctly identified all analytes in
302 (96.5%) of these individuals. The table below lists the medications administered to

i. Carry-Over Contamination:
An analytical carry-over study was carried out to demonstrate that when recommended
laboratory practices are followed, there is little risk of false positive results caused by
carryover or cross-contamination in the FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) System.
The data for this study were generated as part the exclusivity testing examining the
potential for cross-reactivity between Respiratory Panel targets and assays. The
majority of testing was performed by new users at a contracted laboratory as part of an
early performance evaluation of the FilmArray RP system. Multiple spiked NPS (or
simulated NPS) samples containing high levels of organism (approximately 105 for
viruses) were tested over several days using 2 FilmArray instruments. Each sample
was prepared and loaded into a RP pouch one at a time in a work area (biosafety
cabinet or hood) that was separated from the location of the FilmArray instrument(s),
and regular cleaning of the work area and pouch loading station were carried out

according to the recommended testing procedures. Consecutive testing of the same
organism was discouraged in order to maximize the potential for detecting false
positive results due to carryover from a previously tested sample. Over 60 RP target
organism spiked samples were tested in a total of 63 valid runs, and at least half of the
samples were tested subsequently to a sample containing a different target organism at
high concentration. No false positive results were reported (100% negative
agreement). The consecutive set-up and testing of samples containing high
concentrations of different target organisms demonstrated that these practices are
effective in preventing false positive results due to carryover between samples.
Because the PCR2 array in each FilmArray pouch contains over 100 individual PCR
reaction wells in close proximity, the possibility of well-to-well carryover was also
examined. Individual false positive melt curves could be generated if (1) reaction
material (template and rehydrated assay specific primers) carried over into an adjacent
well early in second stage PCR cycling, or (2) amplicon from one well entered a
neighboring well prior to melt analysis. However, the FilmArray device and pouch
have been designed to interact in such a way that the transfer or mixing of liquid
between reaction wells is unlikely. In addition, a positive assay result requires that at
least 2 of the 3 wells are positive for melt curves within the expected Tm range of the
assay. The scattering of assays with similar Tm windows across the array restricts the
possibility that well-to-well carryover could produce 2 or more false positive wells for
the same assay.
The 63 valid test results described above (over 6000 reaction wells with no false
positive organism or assay results) were examined well-by-well and 4 false positive
melt curves were observed as a result of carryover between neighboring wells. Each
carryover event produced a single positive reaction well per assay and had no effect on
the overall accuracy of the FilmArray RP results. This well-to-well carryover analysis
resulted in an overall % negative agreement of 99.9% with the 95% CI of 99.9% to
100.0% (5342/5346 expected negative wells).
Combined, these results indicated that when proper laboratory practices are followed,
the risk of false positive FilmArray RP test results due to sample cross-contamination
or well-to-well carryover is insignificant.
j. Simulated NPS Sample Matrix Validation Study:
NPS is the intended sample type to be used with the FilmArray RP system. A NPS is
collected from an individual by inserting a flexible, fine-shafted synthetic swab into
the nostril and back to the nasopharynx. After a few seconds, the swab is slowly
withdrawn with a rotating motion and the swab is placed into a vial containing
approximately 3 mL of viral transport medium (VTM). Once in VTM, vortexing helps
to release the material collected by the swab (human cells, viral particles, bacteria,
secretions, etc.) into the medium, which is then used as the test sample.
A series of studies was required to demonstrate the analytical performance
characteristics of the FilmArray RP system. For these types of studies, the ideal sample
matrix is NPS collected from healthy individuals that does not contain nucleic acid
from any of the pathogens detected by the panel. Initially, sample matrix for contrived
74

--- Page 75 ---
samples was obtained by collecting NPS from donors at Idaho Technology, Inc (ITI).
Each donor claimed to be healthy and free of symptoms associated with respiratory
infection on the day the NPS was collected. Individual NPS were screened with the
FilmArray RP system prior to use in the studies, to confirm that the sample matrix was
negative for RP organisms.
This process began in the early fall of 2009, at the onset of the typical respiratory
season, and it was found during screening that respiratory pathogens could be detected
in some percentage of healthy donor NPS. For example, over 2 months of collection
(November – December 2009), about 9% of the screened NPS were positive for one or
more FilmArray RP analytes. Some weeks, the rate was as high as 26%. This pattern
continued through the respiratory season with a positivity rate of nearly 12% from
January to March 2010. Furthermore, even after the initial screening for negativity,
false positive results were occasionally detected in contrived samples and the false
positive organism could often be traced to the sample matrix.

The NPS being screened were collected from donors at ITI, following an IRB-
approved protocol. Under the terms of the protocol, the NPS specimens were de-
identified. No personal information was collected from the donors and no test results
could be traced back to the donor. As a result, if a NPS was positive for one or more
RP organisms during screening, it was not possible to follow-up with the donor to
inquire about signs of infection prior to or in the days following the date of donation.
Given the very large number of contrived samples needed for analytical studies, it
became apparent that use of a sample matrix of NPS collected from donors would be
problematic. Most importantly, the true negativity of the matrix could not be
adequately confirmed, which placed the accuracy and integrity of analytical studies at
risk. Consequently, the use of a simulated NPS matrix was investigated. The intent
was for the simulated NPS to resemble the content of an actual NPS as closely as
possible, while ensuring that the simulated NPS was free of respiratory pathogens and
did not alter the performance of the system.
Ten-fold dilutions of HeLa cells in VTM were prepared (from a starting concentration
of 2 x 105 cells/mL) and tested with the FilmArray system both fresh and after being
stored frozen (-20°C) for one week. Results were compared to NPS collected from
healthy donors and an appropriate cell concentration for the simulated NPS was

chosen by comparison of Cp values for the hRNA assay (targets mRNA of the human
beta-catenin gene) between the true and artificial sample matrices. Once a human cell
concentration was selected, contrived samples containing multiple live respiratory
pathogens at or near the estimated system LoD were prepared in both NPS and
simulated NPS sample matrices. The organism mixes included the following:
Mix 1 LoD

Crossing point (Cp) values of amplification curves generated for all positive assays
were also used to compare results from samples prepared in NPS and simulated NPS
sample matrices. (Note: Though the use of Cp values in this study was helpful in
making comparisons, since the FilmArray RP is a qualitative rather than quantitative
system, and the FilmArray RP uses two-stage nested PCR, therefore, Cps are
inherently more variable than Cps in traditional real-time PCR systems, the
significance of these numbers can not be over-interpreted.) When comparing mean Cp
values between NPS and simulated NPS for the hRNA and organism assays, a
difference of 3 cycles or less was considered equivalent.
All samples tested (NPS and simulated NPS) were negative for all panel organisms
and positive amplification and melt curves were recorded for the hRNA assay.
Average Cp values for the hRNA assay were calculated for each sample type and
plotted for comparison. The Cp values observed for the NPS (20.5 – 27.1) were
consistent with historical data from NPS screening. The average Cp of the hRNA
assay was similar for fresh and frozen simulated NPS dilutions. The average Cp for
NPS was most similar to the Cp values obtained with simulated NPS prepared at a
concentration of 2 x 103 cells/mL. Based on this analysis, a concentration of 2 x 103
HeLa cells/mL in VTM was selected as the composition of simulated NPS.

b The delta mean Cp shown is for the FluA/H1 and FluA/H3 subtyping assays only. Delta mean Cp was 1.48 for the
FluA-pan1 assay and 1.07 for the FluA-pan2 assay.
The study generated no false positive results, and the results demonstrated that the
sensitivity of the FilmArray RP system was comparable between samples prepared in
nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and simulated NPS sample matrices. This sample matrix
was then used in analytical performance studies of the FilmArray RP system in place
of NPS collected from donors. Prior to use, all freshly prepared simulated NPS was
screened with the FilmArray RP system to confirm that the hRNA assay provides the
expected Cp values and that the sample matrix is negative for all RP organisms.
k. Comparator Assays Analytical Validation Studies
In the prospective clinical trial for the FilmArray RP System, the FilmArray results
were compared to the results from standard viral culture and fluorescent antibody
testing performed by the clinical sites for several of the common viruses (Adenovirus,
Influenza A, Influenza B, Parainfluenza virus 3, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus).
The majority of the remaining pathogens require 2 PCR followed by bi-directional
sequencing comparator assays (PCR/sequencing) which were tested directly from the
NPS specimens. The exception to this was Influenza A subtyping, which was tested
from viral culture material with 1 assay per virus:

Analytically validated PCR followed by bi-directional sequencing assays that target
different sequences from those used in the FilmArray pouch were used by ITI as part
of a pre-defined composite comparator method for assays in the FilmArray RP system.
Due to the need for a large number of assays and the requirement for quality bi-
directional sequencing, ITI was unable to procure adequate services from any outside
laboratory, or combination of laboratories. Therefore, ITI relied on its own Research
& Development and Regulated Products groups to develop and validate all of the
comparator PCR tests used in this study. All assays were designed to provide
adequate amplicon length for sequencing while still being able to specifically detect
the organisms of interest. Some viruses possess few regions to which a specific PCR
assay can be targeted. This limited amplicon length and gene target choice in some
instances. However, all PCR/sequencing comparator assays were designed to amplify
a different sequence from that amplified by the FilmArray assay(s).

A retrospective clinical evaluation of the FilmArray RP system was performed at ITI
to supplement the prospective evaluation data. In this study, retrospective pre-selected
archived specimens were further validated/confirmed by PCR assays followed by
sequencing analysis, and then tested with the FilmArray RP system.
Because it is possible that the provided samples had been misidentified, had degraded
during storage or contained additional pathogens (such as Rhinovirus) not identified by
the source laboratory, the presence of the expected analyte or the absence of the
analytes was confirmed using analytically validated “validation” PCR assays for the
analytes in the specific panel. These “validation” PCR assays are summarized in the
table below.

3. Clinical studies:
Prospective Clinical Study
The clinical performance of the FilmArray RP system was evaluated during prospective
studies at 3 U.S. clinical laboratories. NP swab samples were collected and tested at three
U.S. clinical laboratories (Sites 1, 2, and 3) during December 2009 thru May 2010. Clinical
study sites were chosen based upon the expertise of the principal investigators, the quality of
their personnel and laboratory resources, and the desired geographic/demographic variation
of the potential subject populations.
Three geographically separated clinical study sites participated in the clinical evaluation of
the FilmArray RP system. The study sites were located in the Southeast (Charleston, SC),
the Southwest (Dallas, TX), and the Midwest (Detroit, MI). The size of the population in
these locations ranges from approximately 107,000 in Charleston, SC to approximately 1.2
million in Dallas TX (source: U.S. Census Bureau). Each study location was representative
of the intended use setting (clinical laboratories) and testing was performed by trained
clinical laboratory personnel.
The study sites enrolled subjects from diverse demographic groups. Site 1 (Medical
University of South Carolina, MUSC) enrolled subjects from an adult emergency
department. Site 2 (Detroit Medical Center, DMC) enrolled primarily children from the
emergency department, but also enrolled immunocompromised adults from an outpatient
bone marrow transplant clinic (approximately 10% of the enrolled subjects at this site). Site
3 (Children’s Medical Center of Dallas, CMC) enrolled subjects from a pediatric emergency
department and associated urgent care clinic.
The following table provides a summary of demographic information for the 853 subjects
that participated in the prospective study:
Demographic Summary for FilmArray RP Prospective Clinical Study
Sex Number of Subjects
Male 449 (53%)
Female 404 (62%)
Age Number of Subjects
≤5 484 (57%)
6-21 95 (11%)
22-49 190 (22%)
≥50 84 (10%)
All specimens used in the study were prospectively collected from subjects had
signs/symptoms of respiratory infection including but not limited to fever, cough, sore
throat, runny/stuffy nose, myalgia, earache, headache, chills, or fatigue. Written informed
consent was acquired from each subject and/or their parent/guardian (if under 18) at the time
of enrollment into the prospective study. After informed consent was acquired, the subject
was assigned a Volunteer Identification Number (VIN). The VIN was used to de-identify the
specimen used for FilmArray testing and to provide data to the sponsor. A key that
connected the subject’s identity to their assigned VIN was maintained in a secure location at
87

each site in order to facilitate the tracking of standard of care testing and for monitoring
purposes. Access to this key was limited to the study coordinator or laboratory supervisor at
each site. At the time of enrollment the following information was recorded on the Case
Report Form (CRF): 1) Age and sex; 2) Information about their suspected respiratory
infection, i.e. signs and symptoms, date of onset; and 3) Current medications (self-reported
and/or collected from medical records).
Two respiratory specimens were collected from each enrolled subject. One specimen (NPS
or other standard specimen type, such as nasal aspirate/wash, used by the study site) was
used for standard of care testing and for viral culture to detect seven common respiratory
viruses (Adenovirus, Flu A, Flu B, PIV1, 2, and 3, and RSV). A frozen aliquot of viral
culture material was prepared for comparator PCR/sequencing testing. The second
specimen, a NPS in 3 mL of viral transport Moderate (VTM) was used for FilmArray testing
according to the Instructions For Use and was aliquoted and frozen for further comparator
PCR/sequencing testing. Individual specimens were delinked from all patient identifiers and
given a study sample code.
Reference and comparator methods used to assess the performance of the FilmArray RP
system include viral culture followed by fluorescent antibody identification for common
viruses (Adenovirus, Flu A, Flu B, PIV3, and RSV), viral culture followed by 1 analytically
validated PCR assay with bi-directional sequence confirmation (Flu A subtyping), and a
composite comparator method of 2 analytically validated PCR assays with bi-directional
sequence confirmation (all other panel analytes):

Viral culture was performed with fresh specimens using standard methods. Sites 1 and 3
used R-Mix shell vial culture format (mixed monolayer of human adenocarcenoma A549
cells and mink lung Mv1Lu cells) incubated for up to 72 hours. Site 2 used traditional cell
culture format, employing three separately inoculated cell lines (primary rhesus monkey
kidney pRhMK cells, human epidermoid carcinoma Hep-2 cells, and human lung fibroblast
MRC5 cells) incubated for up to 14 days. Each site confirmed the presence or absence of the
viruses (Adenovirus, Flu A, Flu B, PIV3, and RSV) using a FDA-cleared direct fluorescent

Frozen aliquots of viral culture material and NPS specimens were shipped to ITI on a
weekly basis for comparator PCR/sequencing testing. PCR testing was performed by ITI
research associates in a blinded manner; specimens were labeled only with the subject’s
VIN and the FilmArray results were not available to them. A bi-directional sequencing
result for each comparator PCR positive result was required to demonstrate sequence
identity with the target organism. All comparator PCR assays were designed at ITI to
provide adequate amplicon length for sequencing while still being able to detect the
organisms of interest. The assays were also designed to amplify a different sequence from
that amplified by the FilmArray assay(s). None of the comparator PCR assays overlapped
any FilmArray amplicon sequence even if the same gene was targeted. PCR plates
containing potentially positive amplicons were not opened at ITI; they were sent directly to
clean up and bi-directional sequencing. Sequencing results that met acceptance criteria (i.e.,
a minimum of 99% accuracy for at least 90% of the sequence, Phred quality score of 20 or
higher) were recorded as positive for the specific analyte.
Performance of the FilmArray RP system detecting Adenovirus, Flu A, Flu B, PIV3, or
RSV, respectively, was compared to viral culture followed by fluorescent antibody
identification. “True” Adenovirus, Influenza A, Influenza B, Parainfluenza virus 3, or RSV
positives, respectively, were considered as any sample that was tested positive for
Adenovirus, Influenza A, Influenza B, Parainfluenza virus 3, or RSV, respectively, by viral
culture followed by DFA testing. “True” Adenovirus, Influenza A, Influenza B,
Parainfluenza virus 3, or RSV negatives, respectively, were considered as any sample that
was tested negative for Adenovirus, Influenza A, Influenza B, Parainfluenza virus 3, or
RSV, respectively, by viral culture followed by DFA testing.
Performance of the FilmArray RP system detecting Influenza A/H1, A/H3, or A/2009
H1N1, respectively, was compared to viral culture followed by 1 analytically validated PCR
assay with bi-directional sequence confirmation. The comparator assays were designed to
amplify a different sequence from that amplified by the FilmArray assay(s). None of the
comparator PCR assays overlapped any FilmArray amplicon sequence even if the same gene
was targeted. “True” Influenza A/H1, A/H3, or A/2009 H1N1 positives, respectively, were
considered as any sample that was tested positive for Influenza A by viral culture, and had
bi-directional sequencing data meeting pre-defined quality acceptance criteria that matched
Influenza A/H1, A/H3, or A/2009 H1N1 sequences deposited in the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov),
respectively, with acceptable E-values. “True” Influenza A/H1, A/H3, or A/2009 H1N1
negatives, respectively, were considered as any sample that was tested negative for
Influenza A by viral culture, or any sample that was tested positive for Influenza A virus by
viral culture, but was tested negative by the respective Influenza A subtype specific PCR
assay. The E-value ranges generated from the clinical trial per organism were presented in
the following table:

Performance of the FilmArray RP system detecting Human Rhinovirus, Enterovirus,
Coronavirus NL63, Coronavirus HKU1, or Human Metapneumovirus, respectively, was
compared to a predetermined algorithm that used composite comparator methods. The
composite reference methods consist of 2 analytically validated PCR followed by bi-
directional genetic sequencing assays. The comparator assays were designed to amplify a
different sequence from that amplified by the FilmArray assay(s). None of the comparator
PCR assays overlapped any FilmArray amplicon sequence even if the same gene was
targeted. “True” Human Rhinovirus, Enterovirus, Coronavirus NL63, Coronavirus HKU1,
or Human Metapneumovirus positives, respectively, were considered as any sample that had
bi-directional sequencing data meeting pre-defined quality acceptance criteria that matched
Human Rhinovirus, Enterovirus, Coronavirus NL63, Coronavirus HKU1, or Human
Metapneumovirus sequences deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) GenBank database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), respectively, with
acceptable E-values. “True” Human Rhinovirus, Enterovirus, Coronavirus NL63,
Coronavirus HKU1, or Human Metapneumovirus negatives, respectively, were considered
as any sample that was tested negative by both of the comparator PCR assays. The E-value
ranges generated from the clinical trial per organism were presented in the following table:
Organism E-value Low E-value High
Human Rhinovirus 4.51E-72 1.15E-08
Enterovirus 9.23E-42 2.72E-12

The E-Value from NCBI BLAST Alignment indicates the statistical significance of a given
pair-wise alignment and reflects the size of the database and the scoring system used. The
lower the E-Value, the more significant the hit. A sequence alignment that has an E-Value
of 1e-3 means that this similarity has a 1 in 1000 chance of occurring by chance alone.

A total of 1257 runs were attempted in the prospective clinical evaluation. These included
pouches for patient samples, daily external control material testing, and weekly
contamination surveillance testing. Greater than 96% of all attempted runs were completed.
Forty-three (43) (43/1257; 3.4%) total runs did not complete. Three (3) (3/1257; 0.2%) runs
were aborted by the user. Four (4) (4/1257; 0.3%) runs were designated ‘Incomplete’ due to
software errors. Thirty-six (36) (36/1257; 2.9%) of total runs were designated ‘Instrument
Error’. Of these 36, two (2) were caused by an incorrect installation of a firmware/software
update. Fifteen (15) of the instrument errors were caused by valve controller errors which
often result from pressure leaks/failure in the instrument bladder system (a known failure
mode). The remaining 19 instrument errors were caused by a camera communication error
that was traced back to a problem with the camera driver software (a known failure mode).
The FilmArray RP pouch is manufactured to contain a vacuum that draws in the required
amount of Hydration Solution and Sample/Buffer Mix when the seals are broken by the

cannula-tipped syringes in each of the pouch ports. If either the Hydration Solution or the
Sample/Buffer Mix is not drawn into the pouch, the operator is instructed to discard the
faulty pouch and obtain a new pouch to test the specimen. Out of 1281 pouches used in the
prospective clinical evaluation, thirty-seven (37) (37/1281; 2.9%) failed to draw Hydration
Solution or Sample/Buffer Mix. However, the majority (31/37) of these failures occurred
early in the evaluation (December through early February). It has been observed that an
operator can partially break a port seal, leading to loss of vacuum and failure to draw the
solution. It may also be possible for a pouch to be manufactured with a faulty port seal or
reduced vacuum. A decrease in the rate of this failure type over time suggested that either
pouch manufacturing improved or the operators became more adept at reliably puncturing
the port seals. During the prospective clinical evaluation, one operator observed a leak in a
pouch when it was removed from the instrument after testing (1/1244 loaded pouches =
0.08% failure rate). The pouches are manufactured from durable materials able to withstand
the manipulations performed by the instrument; however, an occasional small rupture or tear
may occur. Following discovery of the pouch leak, the operator followed recommended
decontamination procedures and performed contamination surveillance swab testing of the
area surrounding the instrument. No contamination was detected.
Two pouch control assays, the RNA Process Control and PCR2 Control, were used to pass
or fail runs. A total of 1214 completed pouch runs were performed during the Prospective
clinical evaluation. Of these, 894 were specimen tests and the remaining runs were for daily
control mixes and contamination surveillance. Thirty-six (36) (36/1214; 3%) of these failed
due to negative results for one or both pouch control assays (RNA Process Control and/or
PCR2 Control). The majority of failed pouches (27/36; 75% of failed pouches) were
negative for the RNA Process Control assay. Nine (9) additional failures were the result of
negative PCR2 Control results alone (with positive RNA Process Control result). All nine of
these failures demonstrate the ability of the PCR2 Control to appropriately fail pouches that
have had a ‘failure to fill’. This failure type results when liquid has not been completely
distributed across the PCR2 array.
Four (4) frozen (-70°C) control mixes were provided to the study sites for daily testing.
Three control mixes contained pooled NPS specimens spiked with whole virus/bacteria with
some plasmid DNA for hard to acquire organisms. Combined, the 3 mixes covered all panel
analytes. A fourth mix was negative for all panel members and only contained pooled NPS:

The operators were required to complete a valid control mix run (correct results obtained)
prior to beginning patient sample testing on each testing day. A total of 300 control mix runs
were attempted. Seventeen (17) runs did not complete and 6 runs had failed pouch
control(s). Of the remaining 277 runs (site 1, 99 runs; site 2, 70 runs; and site 3,108 runs) 7
(site 1, 1 run; site 2, 2 runs; and site 3, 4 runs) (7/277; 2.5%) did not return the correct
organism results either due to the detection of an extra analyte (4/7) and/or the failure to
detect one or more spiked analytes (4/7). These failures may be due to low level virus from

the NPS donors, introduction of contamination during the preparation or testing of the
samples, or improper handling of the frozen aliquots.
The FilmArray RP system is a closed system; all steps from sample lysis through nucleic
acid extraction, PCR, and melt analysis are performed inside the pouch and require no user
manipulation. This dramatically reduces the possibility of contamination from
environmental material or amplicon during the testing process. However, it is still possible
for contaminants to be introduced during pouch loading. To determine if environmental
contamination of workstations might interfere with the accuracy of test results, FilmArray
operators were instructed to perform contamination surveillance swab testing at least weekly
and following any pouch leaks. Forty (40) total swab test runs were attempted; 35 of the
runs completed and the controls passed. No contamination was detected in any of the swab
tests indicating that the routine cleaning procedures recommended in the clinical trial
protocol are sufficient to prevent false positive test results caused by environmental
contamination of workstations used for preparing pouches. These routine cleaning
procedures were recommended in the package insert.

Prospective Clinical Study Mixed Infection Analysis
The FilmArray RP system detected a total of 81 mixed infections in the prospective
clinical evaluation. This represents 16.1% of the total positive specimens (81/502).
Seventy-six (76/81; 93.8%) were double infections, and 5 (5/81; 6.2%) were triple
infections. The total number of test results comprising these co-infections was 167. The
single most common co-infection (21/81; 25.9%) was Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus
with Respiratory Syncytial Virus. These viruses were the most prevalent in the tested
population. Out of the 81 co-infections, 47 contained one or more analytes that had not
been detected with the reference/comparator methods, i.e., discrepant co-infection.

Retrospective Clinical Study
A retrospective clinical evaluation of the FilmArray RP system was performed at ITI to
supplement the prospective evaluation data. In this study, retrospective pre-selected archived
specimens were further validated/confirmed by PCR/sequencing analysis, and then tested
with the FilmArray RP system. Samples for this study included 400 retrospective pre-
selected archived specimens. Most specimens had previous positive test results for selected
organisms of interest from the source sites. Several negative specimens (as determined at the
source sites) were also included in the retrospective sample set.
These retrospective archived samples were characterized previously at the source sites using
a variety of methods including DSFA, viral culture followed by DFA, Luminex X-TAG
RVP, and LDT PCR assays. Upon arrival at ITI, a 4-digit study number (VIN) was assigned
to each sample and a key was created in order to group samples together into panels by
organism. The organism panel was randomized such that the users testing the samples with
the FilmArray RP were blinded as to the expected test result. Specimens were organized into
“test panels” such that specimens positive for a particular analyte could serve as a negative
for another analyte, allowing for calculations of negative percent agreement (NPA).
Additional negative specimens were also included in each panel. There were 3 different
panels in total, labeled 4 through 6, as indicated in the following table:

Because it is possible that the provided samples had been misidentified, had degraded during
storage or contained additional pathogens (such as Rhinovirus) not identified by the source
laboratory, the presence of the expected analyte or the absence of the analytes was
confirmed using analytically validated “validation” PCR assays for the analytes in the
specific panel. (Note that while some validation assays share the same gene target as the
FilmArray RP panel, they targeted different regions of the gene). Positive PCR reactions
were then subjected to bi-directional sequencing for definitive confirmation. “True”
organism positives were considered as any sample that had bi-directional sequencing data
meeting pre-defined quality acceptance criteria that matched the particular organism
sequences deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank
database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), with acceptable E-values. The E-value ranges generated
from the retrospective clinical trial per organism were presented in the following table:
Organism E-value Low E-Value High
Adenovirus 6.4E-57 1.4E-28
Enterovirus 9.3E-50 3.4E-30
Flu A/H1 4.1E-99 5.1E-35

Flu B 1.0E-180 4.9E-50
PIV-3 2.7E-69 1.6E-33
If this “validation” testing did not confirm the presence of the expected organism in the
sample, it was not analyzed further as this result may have reflected that the sample had
been improperly labeled or handled. If additional pathogens were identified in the sample
(those not identified by the source laboratory), the samples was also omitted from the
analysis for that specific analyte. The expected result (positive for reported organism, or
negative for presumed negative specimens) was confirmed for 349 of these specimens using
“validation” PCR assays and sequencing (the identity of 51 specimens could not be
confirmed). Data collected from “validation” PCR assays showed that specimens contained
a broad range of analyte concentrations for all organisms tested (based on Cp value
distribution).
The following table provides a summary of demographic information for the 349 subjects
with confirmed samples in the retrospective study:

a Demographic information was not provided for specimens from one source.
Because the specimens were provided by a pediatric hospital, it is understood that
the age range of specimens was from <1 yrs to 21 yrs.
Validated/confirmed specimens were then analyzed on the FilmArray RP. The identity of
the specimens was unknown to the FilmArray operators. If a FilmArray error was
encountered or if a pouch failed, residual NPS specimen (when available) was used to retest
the sample. Out of 349 analyzed specimens, the FilmArray RP provided the valid results 345
times. Four specimens failed, and were excluded from data analysis due to insufficient
volume to retest the specimens.

N. Instrument Name:
FilmArray Instrument
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The FilmArray instrument interacts with the FilmArray pouch mechanically, thermally, and
optically to drive a multi-step chemical process designed to detect specific nucleic acid
targets using multiplex nested PCR followed by DNA melting analysis. The instrument
follows a protocol that is defined by a set of codes that are downloaded from the host
computer at runtime. The instrument protocol defines the specific timing and sequence
parameters as the instrument performs the following key functions:
• Perform cell disruption using the bead beater
• Extract nucleic acid from the disrupted sample
• Perform stage 1 PCR thermocycling of multiplexed PCR reaction
• Perform stage 2 PCR thermocycling of the array
• Execute a DNA melt and detect fluorescent signals generated
• Monitor system performance in real time and communicates out of specification
conditions to the user via the software
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this
line of product types:
Yes ____X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
User enters Patient ID/Sample ID by typing it in.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Not applicable
5. Calibration:
Not applicable
6. Quality Control:
The FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) pouch contains two internal control assays:
1. The RNA Process Control targets an mRNA of the yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe.
During FilmArray RP pouch manufacture, whole yeast are freeze-dried into the sample
injection port of each pouch. When the test specimen is loaded into the pouch, S. pombe
10

--- Page 106 ---
is rehydrated and enters the pouch with the specimen. The yeast nucleic acid is
extracted, purified and tested simultaneously with nucleic acids from the patient
specimen. A positive result for the processing control indicates that all steps in the
process (nucleic acid extraction, reverse transcription, PCR, melt, detection, and
analysis) are functioning properly.
2. The second stage PCR (PCR2) control assay detects a synthetic DNA template that is
dried into triplicate wells of the array along with the corresponding primers. A positive
result indicates that PCR2 was successful.
The RNA Process Control and the PCR2 Control assays are used to Pass or Fail each
FilmArray RP pouch run. This combination of control assays monitors each of the critical
mechanical and chemical processes that occur in a pouch run, while limiting the possibility
of random control assay failures that could contribute to unnecessary pouch failures.
Good laboratory practice recommends running external positive and negative controls
regularly. Use viral transport medium as the external Negative Control, and previously
characterized positive samples or negative sample spiked with well characterized target
organisms as external Positive Controls. External controls should be used in accordance
with local, state, federal accrediting organizations, as applicable.
