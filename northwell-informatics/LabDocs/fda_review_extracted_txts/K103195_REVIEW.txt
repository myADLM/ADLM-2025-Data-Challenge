510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
k103195
B. Purpose for Submission:
Adding wireless functionality to the i-STAT Analyzer (k001387) to communicate
testing results to a PC
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Abbott Point of Care, Inc. i-STAT 1 Wireless Analyzer
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Hematocrit, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, sodium, potassium, chloride, ionized
calcium, blood gases (oxygen, carbon dioxide, and pH), creatinine, lactate, activated
clotting time, prothrombin time, bicarbonate/carbon dioxide, troponin, creatine
phosphokinase, and beta natriuretic peptide.
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The i-STAT 1 Wireless Analyzer incorporates a radio-frequency transceiver
(IEEE 802.11 b/g protocol), also known as a wireless module. This design
modification provides a new method for users to transmit patient data to a Data
Manager. It does not replace the existing method for transmitting data that uses an
Infra-Red (IR) transceiver in the i-STAT Analyzer together with accessories that
provide a wired connection to a Data Manager. The capability of the Wireless
Analyzer to transmit test results and information by Radio Frequency (RF)
transmission is an option that the user may choose but it is not required for the
Wireless analyzer to fulfill the intended use or to meet the indications for use.
(Which method is used to transmit data is selected by the user.)
The operation of the wireless function during the User Interface application of the
JAMS firmware is temporally distinct from the operation of the Measurement
Cycle application when the i-STAT test cartridges are being processed and tests
are being conducted. The control of the i-STAT 1 Wireless Analyzer assures that
the RF module is not powered during the measurement cycle. All operations
during the measurement cycle are identical in the predicate i-STAT Analyzer and
in the Wireless Analyzer.
2. Principles of Operation:
Once the Measurement Cycle within an i-STAT test cartridge has been
completed, the test results are stored in the analyzer and are displayed on the
Analyzer LCD display where they are available for use by the medical
professional. At this point, the User Interface Cycle begins during which the
stored test results can be transmitted to a Data Manager via the IR transceiver or
1

RF transmission at the convenience of the user.
3. Modes of Operation:
This submission only pertains to a wireless mode of data transmission being
added to a previously cleared i-STAT Analyzer (k001387). The Analyzer
software and the data transmission to a PC via the IR transceiver have been
reviewed in that previous submission.

new carryover studies were not performed.
e. Interfering Substances:
The measurement cycle activities performed within the i-STAT cartridges are
identical in the i-STAT 1 Analyzer and in the Wireless Analyzer, therefore
new studies to evaluate potential interfering substances were not performed.
2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
The following testing was performed to evaluate the wireless function:
1. Testing that demonstrated that i-STAT patient results are transmitted
successfully to the pertinent data fields on the receiving computer for all i-
STAT tests that can be used with the i-STAT wireless analyzer.
2. Testing that demonstrated that multiple i-STAT 1Wireless Analyzers can
transmit results to a computer simultaneously without corruption of the data or
patient mix-up.
3. Testing that demonstrated that the wireless module is not powered during the
measurement cycle
4. Testing that demonstrated that the wireless module is off if the analyzer is off.
The integrity of transmitted data is assured by the use of:
• A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) of data that is the same as that used in the
predicate i-STAT 1 Analyzer (Model 300). Approximately 99.9985% of any
corrupted data will be detected by the CRC.
• A TCP/IP protocol that is the same as used in the predicate device.
• The IEEE 802.11 protocol that is inherent in the operation of the healthcare
facility’s wireless router.
K. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
L. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
