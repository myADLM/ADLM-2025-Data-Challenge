H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) Q Fever
Detection Kit is a qualitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test kit
intended to identify and detect target DNA sequence from Coxiella burnetii in serum
collected from individuals suspected of having acute Q fever, typically 7-10 days
after onset of symptoms or before antibody formation. This in vitro diagnostic (IVD)
test is intended to aid in the diagnosis of Q fever in individuals presenting with signs
and symptoms of acute Q fever when used in conjunction with other clinical and
laboratory findings. This kit is only intended to aid in the diagnosis of Q fever of
patients presenting in the acute stage of the disease. Negative results do not preclude
C. burnetii infection and should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment
or other management decisions.
The JBAIDS Q Fever assay is run on the JBAIDS instrument using the Diagnostic
Wizard. Results are for the presumptive identification of C. burnetii in conjunction
with serology and/or other laboratory tests. The following considerations also apply:
(cid:131) The diagnosis of acute Q fever must be made based on history, signs,
symptoms, exposure likelihood, and other laboratory evidence, in addition to
the identification of C. burnetii from serum specimens.
(cid:131) Sensitivity is decreased by ~25-40%, with no change in specificity, if the
sample is collected after the patient has formed specific antibodies to C.
burnetii, typically 7-10 days after onset of symptoms.
(cid:131) The definitive identification of C. burnetii from serum specimens requires
additional testing and confirmation procedures in consultation with public
health or other authorities for whom reports are required.
The test performance characteristics for this system were established with banked,
frozen serum specimens that were sequentially received during a specified time
period. The safety and effectiveness of other types of tests or sample types have not
been established.
All users, analysts, and any person reporting diagnostic results from use of this device
should be trained to perform and interpret the results from this procedure by JBAIDS
instructors or designees prior to use. Use of this device is limited to designated
Department of Defense (DoD) laboratories equipped with the JBAIDS instruments.

JBAIDS instrument and JBAIDS software
I. Device Description:
The JBAIDS Q Fever Detection Kit is specifically designed for performing real-time PCR in
glass capillaries using the JBAIDS instrument and JBAIDS software. The reagent kit is a
multiplexed assay that that can detect the target organism, C. burnetii, while monitoring for
inhibition through the use of an internal inhibition control. Real-time PCR is accomplished
with the use of a hydrolysis probe, which detects a specific sequence within the region
amplified by the assay primers. The probe is labeled on one end with a fluorescent reporter
molecule and on the other end with a quencher. When the probe is intact, the quencher
absorbs the light emitted by the reporter molecule. During PCR, the intact probe hybridizes
to the amplicon, and the exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase separates the fluorophore
from the quencher, generating a fluorescent signal that is detected by the instrument. The
fluorescent signal increases as additional template is amplified and more probe is hydrolyzed.
The JBAIDS Q Fever Detection Kit assay amplifies a unique insertion sequence (IS1111)
that is found in multiple copies in the C. burnetii genome. Sequencing has shown the Nine
Mile strain contains 20 copies of the IS1111 element per organism; however, the number of
elements in other strains varies from 7 to 110. Isolates of C. burnetii missing the IS1111
element have not been identified.
The target assay has been multiplexed with an inhibition control. The internal inhibition
control (IC) shares primers with the target assay but utilizes a probe that emits a fluorescent
signal read in the 705 nm channel while the target assay is detected in the 530 nm channel.
The template for the IC is a linearized plasmid containing an artificial intervening sequence
flanked by the target assay primer binding sites. IC template is added to each reaction at a
level that is expected to amplify reliably.
The primers and probes were selected based upon two basic criteria: 1) they detect all
sequenced virulent isolates of C. burnetii, and 2) they do not detect sequences in other
organisms. The selected primer and probe sequences were compared, using the Basic Local
Alignment Search Tool (BLAST), to other sequences contained in the NCBI Nucleotide
Collection and were confirmed to meet these criteria. In addition, primers and probes were
only selected if they showed limited self- and cross-complementarities (e.g., hairpins, primer
dimers) that would not form at temperatures encountered during manufacturing, reaction
setup, or PCR. The target probe is labeled on the 5’ end with the fluorescent reporter moiety
6-carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM)) and on the 3’ end with the quencher moiety
3

--- Page 4 ---
carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA). The IC probe is labeled on the 5’ end with 6-FAM
conjugated with cy5.5 and the 3’ end is conjugated with Iowa Black quencher.
Kit Configuration and Components
The JBAIDS Q Fever Detection Kit contains eight vacuum-sealed pouches of freeze-dried
PCR reagents, containing three vials each, and eight pouches containing one tube each of
reconstitution buffer and reagent grade water. Once resuspended, each reagent vial provides
enough material for two reactions, both of which are included in the test run.
Each reagent pouch contains the following vials:
One Positive Control (+) vial Once reconstituted, the Positive Control vial contains all
reagents necessary for PCR, in addition to ~135 copies of a linearized plasmid containing
the target assay template and ~50 copies of a linearized plasmid containing the inhibition
control template. The Positive Control is resuspended with 20 μL reconstitution buffer
and 20 μL reagent grade water before testing in parallel with patient specimens.
Amplification in the Positive Control gives assurance that kit reagents are functioning
properly and that the assay setup has been performed correctly. A Positive Control must
be included with each JBAIDS run.
One Negative Control (-) vial. Once reconstituted, the Negative Control vial contains all
materials required to perform a PCR reaction in addition to ~50 copies of a linearized
plasmid containing the inhibition control template, but not the target template, and should
therefore give negative results. The Negative Control is resuspended with 20 μL
reconstitution buffer and 20 μL water before testing in parallel with patient specimens to
provide assurance that the setup procedure has been performed without contamination. A
Negative Control must be included with each JBAIDS run.
One Unknown vial. The contents of the Unknown vial are identical to the Negative
Control. The Unknown vial is resuspended with 20 μL reconstitution buffer and 20 μL
4

--- Page 5 ---
purified patient sample, and will therefore give negative results unless the target template
is found in the patient sample.
Each reconstitution buffer/reagent grade water pouch contains:
2X Reconstitution Buffer (2X RB). The buffer solution (purple buffer) is matched to the
Q Fever assay and is used undiluted. The buffer enhances PCR kinetics and is used to
resuspend JBAIDS freeze-dried reagents. Once reconstituted, all freeze dried reagent
vials contain all of the components required for PCR.
Reagent Grade Water. Reagent grade water is molecular biology grade water used to
reconstitute the Positive and Negative Controls.
JBAIDS Instrument and Software
The JBAIDS Q Fever Detection Kit is designed for use with the JBAIDS instrument.
Because the instrument and software were previously cleared for use as an IVD device
(K051713), only a brief description of both is provided here.
The JBAIDS instrument is a ruggedized, portable real-time PCR instrument designed to
withstand the conditions of transport and use likely to be encountered in a military field
laboratory. The instrument is composed of an air thermocycler that amplifies specific DNA
sequences using PCR and a fluorimeter that measures fluorescence signals associated with
production of a PCR product (amplicon).
Samples are contained in glass capillaries (up to 32 individual PCR reactions per instrument
run) that are loaded into a JBAIDS carousel and placed into the instrument for
thermocycling. Glass capillaries have heat-transfer and optical properties that are favorable
for thermocycling and fluorescence analysis. By using real-time PCR, the instrument can
rapidly identify a wide array of specific DNA sequences, including those associated with
infectious organisms.
The JBAIDS instrument must be able to detect fluorescence signals generated during the
PCR reaction. This is performed using a 3-channel fluorimeter, which is specifically
5

--- Page 6 ---
designed to excite a fluorescent molecule attached to the probe and capture the light emitted.
For the JBAIDS Q Fever Detection Kit, the fluorescent signal from the target assay is
detected in channel 1, while the signal from the IC assay is detected in channel 3.
The JBAIDS Software is preloaded on a ruggedized laptop computer. The software controls
the instrument’s thermal cycling functions, acquires the fluorescence data from the
instrument, and displays the fluorescence data for the user during the run. When the run is
finished, the software’s Detector module analyzes the data and displays test results. The
instrument and software have the ability to perform either diagnostic (IVD) or surveillance
(environmental) testing.

L. Test Principle:
The JBAIDS Q Fever Detection Kit is based on four major processes:
• Sample collection and purification
• Reconstitution of freeze-dried reagents
• Amplification and detection of target DNA on the JBAIDS instrument
• Automated interpretation of the amplification curves using the JBAIDS software with
report generation.
Sample Collection and Purification
The JBAIDS Q Fever Detection kit can be used to test human serum specimens. Samples
must be purified prior to testing with the JBAIDS Q Fever Detection Kit. The purpose of
sample purification is to release nucleic acid contained in the unknown sample and to remove
extraneous materials (e.g., proteins and chemicals) that can interfere with the PCR reaction.
The JBAIDS Q Fever Detection kit has been validated for use with either the IT 1-2-3
QFLOWdna Sample Purification Kit or the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit.

--- Page 9 ---
Purified samples are tested for the presence of C. burnetii DNA using freeze-dried PCR
reagents specific to C. burnetii. Reagent vials that are intended for testing patient samples are
labeled as Unknowns. To ensure accurate test results, each assay requires that a Positive
Control and a Negative Control be included in each JBAIDS run.
Instrument Operation and Thermocycling
Each JBAIDS run can accommodate up to 12 samples with accompanying controls. The
Diagnostic Wizard guides the operator through the process of setting up the run in
compliance with the JBAIDS Q Fever Detection Kit package insert. After selecting the
appropriate assays and entering sample information, the operator transfers prepared
capillaries to the instrument carousel, guided by the loading pattern displayed in the
Diagnostic Wizard.
With the capillaries loaded into the instrument, the operator signals the instrument to start the
PCR run. The instrument automatically controls the temperature heating cycle in the
carousel. At intervals during temperature cycling, fluorescence emission is monitored as the
carousel rotates to position each sample above the fluorimeter.
Temperature and fluorescence data are displayed in real-time. After starting the run, no input
is required and the operator need not supervise the run. At the conclusion of the run, the
operator may proceed directly to data analysis and reporting.
Data Analysis and Reporting
Each JBAIDS test is analyzed and assigned a final result by the Detector module of the
JBAIDS Software. Possible final results are positive, negative, inhibited, uncertain, or
invalid. To assign a final test result, Detector first analyzes the data from each capillary
independently before analyzing the sample duplicates together. Finally, the software assigns
a final result, or a combined call, based on the results of the sample and all of its controls.
A JBAIDS report is generated automatically for each test run. When the Diagnostic Wizard
is used, reports from the instrument are identified with the phrase “For In Vitro Diagnostic
Use.”
Follow-up Testing
If the Q Fever assay yields a negative or positive result, then the JBAIDS testing is complete.
Any other result requires follow-up testing, as described below.
• Invalid – If either the Positive Control or Negative Control fails to give the expected
results, all Unknown samples associated with the control are called invalid and the
samples must be retested in a new JBAIDS run.
• Uncertain – An uncertain result on a single sample requires retesting with the same
purified sample.
9

--- Page 10 ---
• Inhibited – If the Inhibition Control indicates that an inhibitor is present in a specific
sample, follow-up testing can determine if the sample truly contains an inhibitor or if
the result was caused by other factors, such as improper technique. The effect of PCR
inhibitors is often removed by performing a 1:10 dilution of the sample that yielded
the inhibited test result. The diluted sample is retested along with the original sample
that yielded the inhibited result.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Simulated test specimens were prepared by spiking serum with inactivated C. burnetii
at four test concentrations. The samples were prepared at ITI, aliquoted and frozen
prior to distribution to the test sites. Aliquots of each specimen were tested at three
test sites. The 12-sample panel was tested twice each day for five days at the two
external testing sites and 7 testing days at ITI. On each testing day, two users at each
site purified and tested one aliquot of each specimen, 12 total specimens per operator
per day. One of the operators used the IT 1-2- 3™ QFLOWdna Sample Purification
Kit and the other operator used the IT 1-2-3™ Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit.
Between-site testing is a good indication of overall system performance because it
represents the performance of the system in its intended use environment and includes
many variables. Sources of variability included different runs, instruments, sites,
operators, days, reagent lots, and sample purification kits.

As shown in the table above, the JBAIDS Q Fever Detection Kit correctly made a
positive call 100% of the time on samples containing ≥ LoD of inactivated C. burnetii
and a negative call 100% of the time on samples that did not contain inactivated C.
burnetii. As expected, specimens spiked below LoD have variable results.
The JBAIDS Q Fever Detection system is reliable with respect to variability between
site, between day, between run, between lot, between instrument, and between
operators. The JBAIDS Q Fever Detection Kit provides reproducible test results for
serum samples processed with either the Platinum Path or QFLOWdna Sample
Purifications Kits.
While the JBAIDS Q Fever Detection Kit is designed to provide qualitative results,
an evaluation of precision was performed to estimate the overall variability of the test
system. Testing precision was determined by analyzing the overall variation of the Cp
values, represented by the standard deviation (SD). It was expected that the SD of the
Cp values would be less than one cycle for each test level.
Overall, system variability was low for samples tested at or above LoD as
demonstrated by a SD for each test level that was below one cycle. Due to the high
variability and a high occurrence of negatives and uncertains when testing samples
below LoD, the High Negative samples were not included in this evaluation.
The observed variability seen per site, per specimen and per specimen at each site
was overlapping and was similar to the overall variability. This suggests that the
overall system is not significantly impacted by variability between specimens or
variability between sites, which includes multiple operators and multiple instruments.
The variability of sample purified using QFLOWdna was slightly lower than for
sample purified using Platinum Path, (Low Positive % CV for QFLOWdna 1.4 vs 1.9
for Platinum Path and Medium Positive % CV of 1.3 for QFLOWdna vs. 2.3 for
Platinum Path). However, samples purified with either kit show reliable results.
The Reproducibility and Precision studies are acceptable for this type of device.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Positive, Negative and Inhibition controls were included in each run and gave
expected results. If not, the runs failed or were called invalid and the run was
repeated.

d. Detection limit:
Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined for the Q Fever target assay using serum
specimens spiked with live Coxiella burnetii, Nine Mile. Specimens spiked with 10-
fold dilutions of organism (1000-0.3 TCID /mL), were purified with the IT 1-2-3TM
50
QFLOWdna Kit and the IT 1-2-3TM Platinum Path Kit, and tested with the target
assays to determine an estimated limit of detection for the test system. The LoD was
estimated by determining the lowest concentration of organism (in TCID /mL) at
50
which at least 95% of samples would test positive. Twenty individual specimens
(from independent donors) spiked at the estimated LoD (10 TCID /mL) were
50
successfully detected by the target assay for both purification kits.
e. Analytical specificity:
Analytical Inclusivity-A panel of 10 Q Fever isolates, representative of the five
distinct genomic groups (I-V) known to cause disease in humans, was spiked into
serum specimens at concentrations determined to be equivalent to 1, 10 and 100
TCID /mL. The prepared specimens were purified using the IT 1-2-3TM Platinum
50
Path Sample Purification Kit and then tested using the JBAIDS Q Fever Detection
Kit.

Organisms in the inclusivity panel were expected to test positive and have Cp values
near 32 at LoD. For the inclusivity panel testing, the test result and Cp value were
compared to reference material (C. burnetii Nine Mile inactivated organism) and
were considered equivalent to the reference strain, if the test result was positive and
the average Cp value for the isolate at LoD was not more than 1.5 cycles later than
the average Cp value obtained for the reference strain. Earlier Cp values were
expected for some stains due to the assay target being a multi-copy target.
All strains gave positive results at all concentrations tested. Group VI was excluded
from analysis since it is avirulent.

All 22 (100%) organisms, tested at high concentrations, were negative with the target
assay.
An inability to obtain live Ehrlichia for exclusivity testing lead to in silico screening
of primers and probe to determine cross reactivity of the JBAIDS Q Fever assay with
Ehrlichia spp. and was extended to include Neorickettsia spp. In silico screening was
performed using BLAST to search the genomes of these genera for sequence identity
matches based upon a 15 word match between the primers or probes with the
organism genome. This evaluation indicated that the primers and probes in the
JBAIDS Q Fever assay would not cross-react with organisms from these genera.

Interfering Substances
The JBAIDS Q Fever assay was tested against a panel of potentially interfering
substances. The concentration of each substance tested represented a relevant
concentration in accordance with NCCLS EP7-A2 Interference Testing in Clinical
Chemistry Approved Guideline. All endogenous and exogenous substances typically
found in serum were spiked into the sample matrix and subjected to sample
processing with both IT 1-2-3 QFLOWdna and Platinum Path prior to testing with the
JBAIDS Q Fever Detection Kit. The sample purification portion of the system was
designed to isolate the DNA and remove other impurities; therefore, sample
processing should eliminate most of the potentially interfering substances from the
purified sample. Because technique-specific substances can be encountered during
reaction setup, all such substances were added to the purified samples immediately
prior to reaction setup.
Once prepared, each sample was tested with the target assay which is multiplexed
with an internal Inhibition Control. The substance was considered to be an interfering
substance if the target assay result was negative or inhibited. A substance was
considered potentially inhibitory if the Cp of the target assay was delayed by more
than three cycles or if the Fmax of the target assay was decreased by more than 50%.
Because high concentrations of C. burnetii genomic DNA will competitively inhibit
the IC assay (due to the shared primers), any sample with a positive result for the Q
Fever assay is considered to be positive regardless of the IC result.
The following table lists the potentially interfering substances that were tested.

f. Assay cut-off:
A data analysis module within assay-specific software applies mathematical modeling
of expected amplification curve shapes to each individual capillary. When fixed
thresholds with a quadratic formula or crossing point determination are matched,
samples are called negative or positive. For undecided samples, an expert system
approach is applied that uses filters to assess the fluorescence change around the
crossing point.

Not applicable.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
The clinical performance of the JBAIDS Q Fever Detection Kit was evaluated by
testing acute serum samples obtained from individuals suspected of having acute Q
fever. The study was performed at 3 geographically distinct locations, Australia,
France and the Netherlands, using banked, frozen serum specimens that were
sequentially received during a specified time period for which standard paired
serological testing for Q fever had been previously performed. The results of the
serology-based indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFA) were used as the gold
standard to which the JBAIDS results were compared. Samples were considered to be
15

--- Page 16 ---
positive for acute Q fever if there was a four-fold rise in antibody titer or if there was
seroconversion between the paired acute and convalescent specimens. To better
simulate a prospective study, all samples of sufficient volume that were submitted for
Q Fever serology testing at each site within a given time period were included in the
study.
Serum specimens from a total of 749 subjects were evaluated in the study. However
284 were excluded (86 for inconclusive or incomplete serology, 21 due to
environmental contamination, 7 for inconclusive JBAIDS results and all 170 samples
tested at site 3 due to deviations from the study protocol).
Of the remaining 465 subjects, 254 (55%) were serology positive and 211 (45%) were
serology negative. Sixty-two (24%) of the serology positive specimens were
considered to be positive due to a seroconversion while 192 (76%) were deemed
positive due to a 4-fold rise in antibody titer. Of the 211 serology negative specimens,
149 (71%) were sero-negative and remained negative and 62 (29%) did not exhibit a
four-fold rise in titer between paired specimens.
Prior to testing with the JBAIDS Q Fever Detection kit, serum samples were purified
using either the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path or the IT 1-2-3 QFLOWdna sample
purification kit. Out of the 465 specimens, 183 specimens had adequate volume to be
purified using both purification methods. This resulted in a total of 324 final test
results for Platinum Path (170 from serology positive specimens and 154 from
serology negative specimens) and 324 final test results for QFLOW (171 from
serology positive specimens and 153 from serology negative specimen).
Of the 252 tests on samples that were serology positive based upon a four-fold rise in
antibodies, the JBAIDS Q Fever Detection system correctly identified the presence of
C. burnetii in 17.8% (45/252) samples. However, the positive JBAIDS test result rate
for those samples which exhibited seroconversion was significantly higher at 62.9%
(56/89). These data are consistent with several published reports indicating that PCR
detection of C. burnetii declines significantly once specific antibodies are detected by
serology.
As shown in the table below, the clinical sensitivity for the JBAIDS Q Fever
Detection Kit was different at the two study sites. Site 1 had a lower detection rate
(29% for specimens purified using the QFLOWdna extraction kit and 47% for
specimens purified using the Platinum Path purification kit) when compared to the
detection rate at site 2 (81% for specimens purified using the QFLOWdna extraction
kit and 77% for specimens purified using the Platinum Path purification kit). The
differences observed at the two study sites may be the result of differences in
organism strains, patient population or patient management.

b. Clinical specificity:
Of the 307 tests on serology negative samples in the overall analysis, 222 had no
antibody to C. burnetii and 85 failed to show a 4-fold rise in antibody titer between
the paired acute and convalescence samples, all but one (306/307, 99.7%) gave the
expected negative result when tested with the JBAIDS Q Fever Detection Kit. The
one false positive was obtained from one of the samples that failed to show a four-
fold rise in antibody titer. When only seronegative specimens samples were analyzed
(those samples that didn’t have antibodies in the acute sample but become positive in
the convalescent sample) clinical specificity was 100%.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Carryover and Cross-contamination
To evaluate carryover, negative serum samples were processed and tested alongside highly
positive serum samples (spiked with inactivated C. burnetii Nine Mile at 1 X 105
organisms/mL, equivalent to approximately 1000X LoD). Potential carryover during sample
purification and sample setup was assessed by processing samples in alternating order (i.e., a
negative sample followed by a positive sample) and then testing the processed samples with
the Q Fever target assay.
Using the IT 1-2-3TM Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit, all 23 negative serum samples
gave negative results for the target assay. Using the IT 1-2-3TM QFLOWdna Sample
Purification Kit, all 23 negative serum samples gave negative results for the target assay.
Sample Transport and Storage
To evaluate the serum matrix, 12 individual specimens were used for both the IT 1-2-3
Platinum Path and QFLOWdna purification kits. Eight of the specimens were spiked with live
C. burnetii at the LoD level of 10 TCID50/mL. The remaining 4 specimens were not spiked.

--- Page 19 ---
All 8 positive serum specimens, stored unpurified, tested positive at Day 0, Day 3, Day 7,
Day 30, and after a freeze/thaw cycle. The average Cp values for the stored specimens were
all within 1 cycle of the day 0 time point suggesting no decrease in assay performance with
storage. In addition, the average Fmax values for the time points were never less than half of
the Fmax of the day 0 baseline indicating no reduction of test system performance. All 4
negative samples tested negative at all three time points. The average Cp and Fmax values of
the associated Inhibition Control assays were similar at all three time points.
These results indicate that serum specimens can be stored at 18-28 °C for up to three days, at
2-8 °C for up to seven days before testing, and at -20°C with or without a freeze/thaw cycle
for thirty days without compromising the results.
The stability of purified samples was only assessed after purification with IT 1-2-3 Platinum
purified samples. All positive samples tested positive with the target assay with similar Cp
and Fmax values at Day 0, Day 7, and Day 30. All negative samples tested negative at all
three time points with the target assay and the average Cp and Fmax values of the Inhibition
Control assays were similar at each time point. These results indicate that purified specimens
can be stored at 2-8 °C for up to seven days before testing, and at -20°C for thirty days
without compromising the results.
