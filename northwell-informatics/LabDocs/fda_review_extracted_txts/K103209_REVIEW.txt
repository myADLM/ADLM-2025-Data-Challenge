The Verigene® Respiratory Virus Plus Nucleic Acid Test (RV+) on the Verigene®
System is a qualitative nucleic acid multiplex test intended to simultaneously detect and
identify multiple respiratory virus nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens
from individuals with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection. The following
virus types and subtypes are identified using the RV+: Influenza A, Influenza A subtype
H1, Influenza A subtype H3, 2009 H1N1, Influenza B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus
(RSV) subtype A, and RSV subtype B. The test is not intended to detect Influenza C
virus. Detecting and identifying specific viral nucleic acids from individuals exhibiting
signs and symptoms of respiratory infection aids in the diagnosis of respiratory viral
infection, if used in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory findings.
Negative results for Influenza A, Influenza B, or RSV do not preclude influenza virus or
RSV infection and should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or patient
management decisions. Conversely, positive results do not rule-out bacterial infection or
co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of
disease. The use of additional laboratory testing and clinical presentation must be
considered in order to obtain the final diagnosis of respiratory viral infection.
Performance characteristics for Influenza A Virus were established when Influenza
A/H3, A/H1, and 2009 H1N1 were the predominant Influenza A viruses circulating.
These characteristics may vary when other Influenza A viruses are emerging.
If infection with a novel Influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions used specifically for
novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing.
Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available
to receive and culture specimens.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as the Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Verigene® System consisting of two instruments, the Verigene Processor SP and the
Verigene Reader
I. Device Description:
The RV+ is designed to identify virus-specific nucleic acids for Influenza A virus,
Influenza A virus subtype H1, Influenza A virus subtype H3, Influenza A virus subtype
2009 H1N1, Influenza B virus, and respiratory Syncytial virus (RSV A. RSV B). The
RV+ involves:
1) Sample Preparation – magnetic bead-based viral RNA extraction from
nasopharyngeal swab specimens obtained from symptomatic patients;
2

--- Page 3 ---
2) Target Amplification – multiplex RT-PCR-based amplification of the eluted
viral RNA targets to generate virus-specific amplicons;
3) Verigene Hybridization Test and Analysis – detection and identification of
virus-specific amplicons by using gold nanoparticle probe-based technology.
The entire RV+ test is performed on the Verigene® System, which is a bench-top
molecular diagnostics workstation that consists of two instruments, the Verigene
Processor SP and the Verigene Reader. The Verigene Processor SP performs the assay
steps on each sample by using a robotic pipettor to transfer and mix reagents within and
between separate testing modules designed for nucleic acid extraction, target
amplification, and the Verigene Hybridization Test. The Verigene Hybridization Test
module is the same as in the original Verigene System with added modules for nucleic
acid extraction and RT-PCR target amplification.
Key functions of the Verigene Processor SP include:
1) Reading of the barcode identification label on inserted Test Consumables to
maintain positive identification of patient samples throughout processing.
2) Facilitation of nucleic acid extraction, multiplex RT-PCR target amplification,
and the Verigene Hybridization Test.
3) Real-time communication of test processing status to the Reader.
The Verigene Reader is the same instrument as in the FDA-cleared RVNATSP. It is a
free-standing instrument with a touch screen control panel and a wand-based barcode
scanner. It utilizes a graphical user interface to guide the user through the process of
ordering tests and reporting results. There are no serviceable parts and no user calibration
is required. Interaction with the touch screen is minimized through barcode use. This
instrument also serves as the reader of the Test Cartridges using advanced optics. The
key functions of the Verigene Reader include:
1) Entry and tracking of specimen identification numbers via manual keyboard
input or via barcode-reader wand.
2) Test selection for each specimen.
3) Automated transfer of specimen processing instructions on Test Cartridge-
specific basis to linked Processor SP unit(s). A single Reader unit can control up
to 32 Processor units.
4) Automated imaging and analysis of Test Cartridges.
5) Results display
6) Results report generation.
RV+ consumables within each single-use disposable test kit include: (i) Tip Holder
Assembly; (ii) Extraction Tray; (iii) Amplification Tray; and (iv) RV+ Test Cartridge.
The kit components are inserted into the corresponding module of the Verigene Processor
SP prior to each test, and the sample is added to the Extraction Tray. Patient information
is entered into the Reader to initiate the test procedure.
3

--- Page 4 ---
1) Tip Holder Assembly – The robotic pipettor picks up pipettes from the Tip Holder
Assembly. The pipettes are used for mixing and transferring reagents within the test
procedure.
2) Extraction Tray – Nucleic acids are extracted from the sample by using magnetic
bead-based methods within the Extraction Tray. Each Tray contains reagents for a
single extraction procedure. A robotic pipette transfers reagents to designated wells
within the Extraction Tray to affect the steps of lysis, capture of nucleic acids onto the
magnetic beads, washing, and eluting the isolated nucleic acids from the magnetic
beads.
3) Amplification Tray – The isolated nucleic acids are amplified by using multiplex
RT-PCR within the Amplification Tray. Each Tray contains reagents for a single
multiplex RT-PCR procedure. A robotic pipette transfers the reagents to a specific
well within the Amplification Tray. A set thermal profile is then initiated to perform
all of the amplification related steps including UDG-based decontamination, reverse
transcription, and multiplex PCR in a single tube. Upon completion, an aliquot of the
amplified sample is mixed with hybridization buffer containing the virus specific
mediator probes. The sample is then transferred to the Test Cartridge.
4) RV+ Test Cartridge for Verigene Hybridization Test – The virus-specific and
subtype-specific amplicons are detected and identified within a Test Cartridge by
using specific nucleic acid probes in conjunction with gold nanoparticle probe-based
detection technology. Each Test Cartridge is a self-contained, laboratory consumable
that consists of two parts. The upper housing of each cartridge is called the “reagent
pack” and contains reservoirs filled with the detection reagents. When in place with
the ‘substrate holder’, the reagent pack creates an air-tight hybridization chamber
surrounding the region of the substrate containing a target-specific capture array. As
each step of the test is completed, old reagents are moved out of the hybridization
chamber and new reagents are added from the reagent pack via microfluidic channels
and pumps. Once the test is complete, the Test Cartridge is removed from the
Verigene Processor SP unit and the reagent pack is snapped off and discarded. The
remaining slide is now ready for imaging and analysis in the Verigene Reader.
5) End-point detection on the Verigene Reader: The test slide is inserted into the
Verigene Reader wherein it is illuminated along its side. The gold-silver aggregates at
the test sites scatter the light, which is in turn captured by a photosensor. The relative
intensity arising from each arrayed test site is tabulated. Net signals, defined as the
absolute signal intensities with background signals subtracted, are compared with
thresholds determined by negative controls within the slide in order to arrive at a
decision regarding the presence or absence of target. These results are linked to the
test and patient information entered at the beginning of each test session to provide a
comprehensive results file.

L. Test Principle:
RV+ is a molecular test and relies on the specific detection of target nucleic acids. For each of
the viruses/analytes detected in RV+, at least 4 sets of oligonucleotides are required: (i) and (ii)
Specific forward and reverse primers for the generation of virus-/analyte-specific amplicons; (iii)
Capture oligonucleotides; and (iv) Mediator oligonucleotides. The Capture oligonucleotides (or
captures) and Mediator oligonucleotides (or mediators) are needed for the endpoint gold
nanoparticle probe-based detection process. The Capture oligonucleotides (or captures) are
printed on the Test Substrate (or the microarray) and are designed to specifically bind to one part
of the target amplicon. The Mediator oligonucleotides (or mediators) bind to another part of the
same target amplicon and allow the binding of a gold nanoparticle probe to a portion
complementary to a gold nanoparticle probe. Notably, in a multiplexed detection system,
numerous unique target-specific mediators can co-exist and form unique ‘sandwich’
hybridizations at the different captures on the microarray. Since all the mediators have a target
specific region and a gold nanoparticle probe region, a single ‘universal’ gold nanoparticle probe
is sufficient. Specific silver enhancement of the bound gold nanoparticle probes at the capture
sites results in gold-silver aggregates that scatter light with high efficiency. Light scatter from the
capture spots is imaged by the Verigene Reader and intensities from the microarray spots are
used to make decisions regarding the presence (Detected) or absence (Not Detected) of a
virus/analyte.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility panel was developed by using 6 unique virus strains to represent all
of the analytes in the RV+. The 6 virus strains were combined to generate 12 unique
combinations. The combinations were designed such that each virus strain was
represented at 3 levels: High Negative, Low Positive, and Moderate. For two of the
unique samples, virus strains were combined as in the case of INFA/H3 and RSVA and
Influenza B and RSV B. For the Reproducibility/Precision study, the Test Panel
comprised the 12 unique samples in duplicate for a total of 24 samples. The Test Panel
samples were then divided equally into Panel A (12 samples) and Panel B (12 samples).
In order to prepare the samples, the strains were diluted at the desired concentrations in
the above-mentioned combinations into Universal Transport Medium, aliquoted into
individual test aliquots, and stored frozen at ≤ -70°C until the time of use. Panel A and
Panel B composition is outlined in the table below.

Reproducibility testing was carried out at three sites. One site was Nanosphere, Inc,
while the other two were external testing sites. At the two external study sites, Test Panel
A and Test Panel B were tested on separate days. Testing each day involved 2 operators
testing the same Test Panel in duplicate resulting in 24 tests per day.

The internal site running the 12-day precision study utilized the same four unique
samples at the three levels. The complete Test Panel (Test Panel A and B) was tested
separately by two operators each day for. The precision study was run for a total testing
period of 12 non-consecutive days. The following table summarizes the cumulative data
for RV+ across the three test sites. The Confidence Interval (CI) was calculated using the
exact binomial method in SAS 9.1.3.

expected as this is a high negative sample. However, RSV A was also detected which was
unexpected. 4One INFA/H3 + RSVA LP sample detected both Influenza A, H3 and RSV A
as expected for a low positive sample, but also detected 2009H1N1 which was not expected.
5One INFA/2009H1N1-MT HN sample did not detect Influenza A and 2009H1N1 which
was expected as this is a high negative sample. However, Influenza B and RSV B were also
detected which was not expected. 6One INFA/H3/RSVA LP sample detected Influenza A,
H3 RSV A which was expected as this is a low positive. However, 2009H1N1 was also
detected which was not expected. NOTE: All the samples with additional positive calls gave
the expected results for the intended virus; there were no mis-calls. The source of the
additional positives is likely cross-contamination artifacts during the Test Panel preparation.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable/ Qualitative Assay
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Blanks or no template control
Not required as the RV+ is performed in a single-test use disposables. Also, the RV+
employs a thermolabile UDG enzyme that eliminates the potential of amplicon cross-over
and potential contamination between tests. Moreover, the RV+ is an end-point detection
test and high background within the Test Cartridge owing to the amplification step (or
related steps) results in a ‘No Call – BKGD’.
Negative Sample Control
External Negative Control – In the RV+ is Universal Transport Media. The External
Negative Control is the equivalent of the proposed Negative Sample Control in the
Guidance document. Since the RV+ is an endpoint detection test, non-specific priming
during the target amplification step, if any, does not interfere with the test since detection
requires binding of specific captures and mediators. The expected calls after test analysis
are ‘Not Detected’ for all the viruses/analytes. The frequency of running this test is
dictated by the test site. It is recommended that the RV+ kit be tested upon receipt by
running the external negative control to ensure proper performance of the kit.
Note that in the processing of the External Negative Control, RNA from IC2 gets
extracted and is amplified along with IC1, which is present in the amplification mix. The
inability to detect either IC1 or IC2 indicates issues with isolation or the target
amplification within the particular test alone. The recourse is to isolate and amplify a
fresh external negative control sample, just the same as if it were a sample. NC or
Negative Control is a set of non-target oligonucleotide spots that serve as negative
controls and are used to normalize signal intensities at target spots (Ratio-to-NC)
Positive control for complete assay
External positive controls – In the RV+, ‘positive control for the complete assay’ are
10

--- Page 11 ---
suggested to be inactivated intact viral particles with altered surface proteins making
them unable to infect a host cell. Obtained from Zeptometrix Corporation, these viral
particles, referred to as NATtrol, possess viral integrity and an intact viral genome. Thus,
in the RV+, the NATtrol serves as a control for the extraction, the target amplification,
and detection steps.
Positive control for amplification/detection
IC1 serves as the internal inhibition control or ‘positive control for
amplification/detection’. It is a 99-mer duplex DNA synthetic construct present in the
primer mix and is amplified along with every test sample (along with potential targets
and IC2). It independently controls for inhibitors to the PCR step in each test. The
presence of IC1 in the analysis indicates that the reaction components performed as
expected. PC or Imaging control is a set of oligonucleotide spots on the substrate that act
as a quality check for proper fluid control and movement between the Test Cartridge and
the instrument. If the imaging controls are absent, then a “No Call – No Grid” is an
output. The imaging control signal is due to signal probe hybridization to an
oligonucleotide on the substrate. Signal will only be present if the probe reagent and the
signal enhancement reagents are pumped into and held in the hybridization chamber for
the specified time period. The PC also serves to normalize signal intensities at target
spots (Ratio-to-PC).
Internal Control
IC2 (Escherichia coli MS2 bacteriophage) serves as an internal process control in the
RV+. The IC2 has an intact viral genome in a viral capsid and therefore controls for the
sample isolation or the nucleic acid extraction step and the target amplification or the RT-
PCR step. In the context of the RV+, IC2 is added to every test sample and is co-
extracted with the sample. The extracted RNA undergoes RT-PCR and controls for
inhibitors within the test sample.
NOTE: A valid ‘Call’ is made only after both inhibition control (IC1) and process control
(IC2) are verified during analysis of each test, signifying that the extraction and target
amplification processes performed correctly. If IC1 or IC2 are ‘Not Detected’ a ‘No Call
– INT CTL 1’ or a ‘No Call – INT CTL 2’ is provided respectively. If both IC1 and IC2
are ‘Not Detected’, a ‘NO CALL – INT CTL’ result is provided. The following exception
exists: IC2 detection alone is sufficient for a valid call if any of the viral targets are also
detected; there is no requirement for IC1 to also be ‘Detected’. The recourse for the ‘No
Call – INT CTL decision is to repeat the RV+ test. In addition, separate internal positive
and negative controls are present within each Test Cartridge that inform regarding the
proper functioning of the Test Cartridge.
The following table summarizes the controls found in the RV+ with a description of the
composition of the control as well as the function.

d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity of RV+ was assessed and confirmed by using virus strains with
established titers to represent all analytes in the test. The strains were previously cultured
and titered (see the table below for stock titers). In order to determine the Limits of
Detections (LODs), the strains were serially diluted into negative pools of
nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples. Each concentration level in the dilution series was
tested in the RV+ in triplicate to establish an estimated LOD.
For confirmation, 20 replicate samples were prepared at the estimated LOD level chosen
from the dilution series experiment and tested in the RV+. Acceptance criteria for LOD
confirmation required that at least 19 of the 20 samples tested gave a ‘Detected’ call for
the analyte. The confirmed LOD levels results for the different analytes and the
associated virus strains are presented in the table below.

e. Analytical specificity:
Analytical specificity studies were performed to assess potential cross-reactivity of the
RV+ with common respiratory pathogens and other microorganisms commonly present
in the respiratory tract. In the cross-reactivity studies, 23 bacterial strains were tested at
concentrations between 105 to107 cfu/mL while 29 virus strains were tested at
concentrations between 104 to106 TCID /mL. The bacterial strains were obtained from
50
ATCC, re-grown and their titers confirmed. The virus strains were obtained from several
sources including ATCC, Zeptometrix, Intelligent MDx, and Tricore. All virus strains
were re-grown and their titers were confirmed. The microorganisms were diluted into a
sample matrix, Universal Transport Medium (Copan), at the concentrations indicated and
tested subsequently in the RV+.
In the RV+, IC1 and IC2 are verified before providing a valid call. IC1 is an inhibition
control for the Target Amplification step and IC2 is a process control (bacteriophage,
MS2) that is added to the sample automatically prior to the extraction step. The IC2 goes
through all steps of RV+: Sample Extraction, Target Amplification, and Verigene
Hybridization Test. In all the samples tested, a valid test result was provided indicating
that the microorganisms did not negatively effect the RV+ processing. Significantly, all
the microorganisms tested gave a ‘Not Detected’ call for each analyte on the RV+; the
microorganisms tested did not demonstrate cross reactivity with any of the analytes in the
RV+.
RV+ did not cross-react with any of the microorganisms chosen to represent pathogens
residing in the respiratory tract. The table below details the test results from the study.

f. Analytical Reactivity:
The analytical reactivity of the RV+ was evaluated using multiple strains of Influenza A
(8 seasonal H1 strains, 7 seasonal H3 strains, 4 2009 H1N1 strains, 2 swine origin H1N1
strains, 1 H5N1 strain, and 1 H7N7 strain collectively representing temporal and
geographical diversity), 9 Influenza B strains, 2 RSV A strains and 3 RSV B strains.
In order to demonstrate analytical reactivity, cultured and titered strains of Influenza
A/H3, Influenza A/H1, Influenza A/2009H1N1, Influenza B, RSV A, and RSV B were
diluted in sample matrix, Universal Transport Media (Copan), to a nominal concentration
of 100 TCID /mL (or CEID /mL). Each strain dilution was tested in triplicate in the
50 50
RV+. Most strains were reactive at 100 TCID50/mL; however, concentration levels for a
few strains were increased in order for all three replicate tests to yield ‘Detected’. All the
Influenza A/H3, Influenza A/H1, and Influenza A/2009 H1N1 strains yielded expected
subtyping decisions.
The two swine H1N1 strains of non-human origin gave a ‘Detected’ result for Influenza
A and for H1 at 100 CEID50/mL and gave a ‘Not Detected’ result for 2009 H1N1.
Higher concentrations of these strains (1x103 CEID /mL and 1x104 CEID /mL) were
50 50
also tested to assess cross-reactivity at 2009 H1N1 but none was found as evidenced by a
‘Not Detected’ call for 2009 H1N1.
The H5 and H7 Influenza strains in this study were grown in culture, titered, and
inactivated before they were tested in the RV+. The H5 and H7 strains gave a ‘Detected’
result for Influenza A and a ‘Not Detected’ result for H1, H3, and 2009 H1N1. As
expected, these strains were untypeable in the RV+.
In summary, the RV+ demonstrated good reactivity against a range of panel viruses.
Against, Influenza viruses H5 and H7, RV+ gave a ‘Detected’ call for Influenza A but
these viruses did not cross-react with any of the subtyping systems even at very high
concentrations demonstrating high assay specificity. Similarly, the two swine-origin
H1N1 strains gave ‘Detected’ calls for Influenza A and HI only; no cross-reactivity was
observed even at very high titers. Finally, no cross-reactivity was observed within the
remaining panel viruses.

to the above testing, the H5 and H7 strains were tested at 1- and 2-logs higher concentration. No cross-
reactivity to any sub-types was observed.
g. Assay cut-off:
RV+ provides a qualitative result for the presence (Detected) or absence (Not Detected)
of the following viruses/analytes: Influenza A, Influenza B, RSV A, RSV B. For
Influenza A positive samples, RV+ provides subtyping information as H1, H3, or 2009
H1N1.
Image analysis of the Test Substrate provides image intensities from target-specific
capture spots. Two Internal Controls guide decisions regarding the validity of the test.
The Internal Controls, IC1 – inhibition control and IC2 – the process control are also
represented by unique captures and are treated as targets and their presence is verified
before a valid result is provided.
In order to provide a ‘Detected’ and ‘Not Detected’ result in RV+, three conditions or
filters are examined. These conditions serve as a single-set of clinical cut-off criteria.

− Filter 1: Signal > Noise Threshold
− Filter 2: Normalized ‘Ratio to Negative Control’ > 0.85
− Filter 3: Normalized ‘Ratio to Positive Control’ ≥ 0.4
− A True Positive (or a False Positive) requires that all three filter conditions
are met.
− A True Negative (or a False Negative) is provided if any or all the filter
conditions are not met.
For a result, the decision tree verifies the presence of IC1 and IC2 in conjunction with
each of the viruses. Both IC1 and IC2 signal intensities have to meet the detection criteria
for a valid call. A valid ‘Call’ is made only after both inhibition control (IC1) and
process control (IC2) are verified during analysis of each test, signifying that the
extraction and target amplification processes performed correctly. If IC1 or IC2 are ‘Not
Detected’ a ‘No Call – INT CTL 1’ or a ‘No Call – INT CTL 2’ is provided respectively.
If both IC1 and IC2 are ‘Not Detected’, a ‘NO CALL – INT CTL’ result is provided. The
following exception exists: IC2 detection alone is sufficient for a valid call if any of the
viral targets are also detected; there is no requirement for IC1 to also be ‘Detected’. The
recourse for the ‘No Call – INT CTL decision is to repeat the RV+ test. In addition,
separate internal positive and negative controls are present within each Test Cartridge
that inform regarding the proper functioning of the Test Cartridge.
Cut-off verification
A set of retrospective clinical samples (71) positive by DFA/Culture for either Influenza
A, Influenza B, or RSV was tested in the RV+ to verify the cut offs.
The plots of the logistic fit of Expected Results by Ratio-to-PC and Ratio-to-NC for these
retrospective samples was provided for this data set along with the predictive value of the
algorithm. Decisions were made based on the three-filter method by using the cut-off
limits for Ratio-to-PC and Ratio-to-NC determined in the above study. The results from
the RV+ showed perfect agreement with the decisions obtained by culture/DFA for
Influenza A, Influenza B, and RSV. Moreover, the Influenza A subtype decisions (H1,
H3, and 2009 H1N1) and RSV A and RSV B decisions made by RV+ were all justified
by sequencing. Overall, the three-filter method provided excellent predictive power. The
cut-offs determined in these studies were used throughout the analytical studies, the
reproducibility and precision studies, and in the methods comparison studies.
h. Fresh vs. Frozen equivalency:
Freezing virus-containing samples can potentially compromise viral integrity, which may
translate to a lower effective concentration in frozen samples. In order to determine the
impact of freezing samples on RVNAT+ performance, unfrozen negative nasopharyngeal
swab samples were obtained and spiked with Influenza A, Influenza B, and RSV viruses
to represent all the analytes in the RVNAT+. Each virus was tested at multiple
concentrations. Paired comparisons were conducted for each sample by testing it before
and after freezing. The impact of 2 additional freeze-thaw cycles on the RVNAT+ (for a
total of 3 freeze-thaw cycles) was also assessed.
18

--- Page 19 ---
The ‘Fresh-vs.-Frozen’ comparison study involved testing a total of 60 negative
nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples across 6 unique virus types representing all the
targets and analytes in the RVNAT+ (see Table 13 & 14)). The negative NP swab
samples were not pooled; each virus was represented by 10 unique NP swab samples.
Each unique sample had sufficient volume to allow ~4 tests. Thus, each sample was
tested four (4) times: once while fresh or unfrozen and once after each of the three (3)
freeze-thaw cycles. Logistically, after a sample was spiked with the appropriate virus, an
aliquot of this sample was tested in the RV+ while the sample was ‘fresh’. The residual
sample-containing tube was frozen by placing it at or below -70 °C. For the first freeze
thaw, the sample-containing tube was thawed and an aliquot was removed and tested in
the RV+. This activity constituted the first ‘freeze-thaw’ cycle, and the sample-containing
tube was placed again at or below -70 °C. The ‘freeze-thaw’ process was repeated for the
second and third ‘freeze-thaw’ cycles.
The performance of each virus/analyte after each freeze-thaw cycle was compared to the
corresponding results obtained when the sample was ‘fresh’ or unfrozen. Of the 240
tests, 236 tests gave valid results (98.3%). The results for all the viruses/analytes within
this set of valid results were in perfect agreement between the paired ‘fresh’ and ‘frozen’
samples at each of the three ‘freeze-thaw’ cycles. Overall, the results showed that the
RV+ detected the viruses/analytes correctly even after the sample was subjected to three
sets of ‘freeze-thaw’ cycles. There was no trend of decreased performance with the
number of ‘freeze-thaw’ cycles.
i. Competitive Inhibition Studies:
Competitive inhibition or interference in the RV+ was assessed in clinically relevant co-
infections. By definition, competitive inhibition or interference in a co-infection setting
refers to the potential ability of the virus present at a high concentration to inhibit
efficient target amplification.
Considering the RV+ is a multiplexed test designed to detect multiple viruses
simultaneously, combinations of Influenza A viruses and RSV A/B viruses were
identified as clinically relevant co-infections. A set of 12 unique ‘high titer-low titer’
combination samples, each containing a virus at a high titer and another virus at a low
titer, were generated. The samples represented combinations of Influenza A subtypes
(H1, H3, and 2009 H1N1) and RSV A/B viruses. The levels for individual strains were
chosen based on the limits of detection determined for the individual strains. The high
titers for the strains were at least 3 log orders higher than their limits of detection and the
low titers were held close to the limits of detection.

The samples were created by diluting stocks for each virus strain with verified titers into
a sample matrix (Universal Transport Media, Copan). Each binary combination was
tested in triplicate in the RV+. The expected calls were compared to the Verigene Calls to
assess inhibition. All the calls for the low titer sample and the high titer sample would
have to be ‘Detected’ in a sample for there to be no competitive inhibition.
In the RV+, IC1 and IC2 are verified before providing a valid call. IC1 is an inhibition
control for the Target Amplification step and IC2 is a Process Control (bacteriophage,
MS2) that is added to the sample. The IC2 goes through all steps of RV+: Sample
Extraction, Target Amplification, and the Verigene Hybridization Test. Both IC1 and IC2
undergo Target Amplification along with the targets in the sample and may be prone to
competitive inhibition effects similar to the low titer sample. In all the samples tested, a
valid test result was provided indicating that the presence of the high titer target did not
inhibit the internal controls during the different steps of the RV+. Moreover, all the
replicates within the binary combinations gave expected calls for both viruses in each
sample. The presence of the higher titer viruses did not inhibit detection of the lower titer
virus at the levels tested. Thus, in the binary combinations tested in these studies there
was no evidence of competitive inhibition.
j. Carry-Over / Cross-Contamination Study
A study was performed to assess the carry over/cross-contamination of the RV+ by
alternately running ‘High Positive’ samples followed by ‘High Negative’ samples.
Multiple Processor SP units were used in the study and each Processor SP was subjected
to a comprehensive set of tests.
Viruses and virus subtypes, as well as specific virus strains used in the study are
presented in the table below. The concentrations associated with the High Positive (HP)
and High Negative (HN) for the virus strains are also listed. A total of six (6) unique
strains, representing all the analytes in the RV+, were tested at High Positive and High
Negative concentrations.

The samples were divided into two sets as described. Each set comprised a total of six (6)
unique alternating High Positive and High Negative samples. The samples within each
set were tested sequentially in the order described. Each set was tested in triplicate on
separate Processor SPs (2 Sets x 3 Processor SPs = 6 Processor SPs. Thus, a total of 36
samples [6 strains x 2 (HP+HN) x 3 replicates] were tested across 6 Processor SPs over 6
sequential test runs. The 6 test runs were conducted over a 3 day period.
Considering each High Positive test was followed by a High Negative test of a different
viral type, ‘Observed Results’ that differed from ‘Expected Results’ for the High
Negative test would be considered as carry over/cross-contamination. The only exception
to this would be if a High Negative sample gave a positive result for that particular High
Negative viral strain as by definition, a High Negative sample should be detected < 5%.
Regardless, this would be distinguished easily from the previous viral type because of the
order of testing.
Decisions regarding the presence or absence of a virus were based on the ‘Calls’
(‘Detected’ or ‘Not Detected’) displayed by the Verigene® Reader. Carry over/cross-
contamination would be a probable cause if the Verigene® System detected a virus other
than or in addition to the one that was intended in the sample.
All High Positive samples yielded the expected ‘Detected’ results for the intended virus
and ‘Not Detected’ results for the other viruses or analytes. All but one of the High
Negative samples yielded a ‘Not Detected’ for the intended virus as well as all other
viruses. One Influenza B high negative sample gave a ‘Detected’ call for Influenza B.
High Negative samples are expected to be positive < 5% of the time; this result was
expected. Moreover, the High Positive preceding this sample was Influenza A 2009H1N1
confirming that the Influenza B result was not due to sample carry over. Overall, the
studies confirmed that there was no evidence of carry over/cross-contamination from the
High Positive samples, or any other internal or external sources, in any of the three steps
of the RV+: Sample Extraction, Target Amplification, and Verigene Test.
k. Interfering Substances Studies
The potential inhibitory effects of interfering substances or interferents that may be
encountered in nasopharyngeal specimens on the RV+ was assessed. A set of 22
interferents and two types of influenza vaccines were identified for a total of 24 potential
interferents.
All the interferents (except the vaccines) were dissolved into a sample matrix, Universal
Transport Medium (Copan), to make intermediate stocks. The concentration of the
interferent was based on the maximum dosage and the interferent’s solubility in the
sample matrix. Next, each interferent was spiked into samples containing different
combinations of viral strains. A set of four unique virus combinations were chosen to
represent all the analytes in the RV+. The different target combinations and interferents
amounted to 88 unique samples (22 interferents x 4 unique samples). The titers chosen

		High Negative	0.001

--- Page 22 ---
for each virus strain were near their limits of detection. Samples containing viruses and
the interferents were then processed through the RV+. The vaccines were tested as a
dilution series.
In the RV+, Internal Control (IC1) and Internal Control 2 (IC2) are verified before
providing a valid call. IC1 is an inhibition control for the Target Amplification step and
IC2 is a process control (bacteriophage, MS2) that is added to the sample automatically
prior to the extraction step. The IC2 goes through all steps of RV+: Sample Extraction,
Target Amplification, and the Verigene Hybridization Test. In all the samples tested, a
valid test result was provided indicating that the interferents did not pose a problem
during the different steps of the RV+. Moreover, in each of these samples the expected
calls were obtained for each of the analytes tested; none of the interferents at the tested
concentration prevented the RV+ from making the correct ‘Detected’ calls for the virus
strains and analytes present in samples containing the interferents.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable, performance of the assay was evaluated in comparison to the gold
standard/reference method, viral culture followed by DFA and/or viral culture followed
by sequencing
b. Matrix comparison: Not Applicable.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
The clinical performance of the RV+ assays was established through a study conducted at
three external clinical sites: TriCore Reference Laboratory, Albuquerque, NM (TC);
Midwest Research Institute, Palm Bay, FL (MRI); and Medical College of Wisconsin,
Milwaukee, WI (MCW). Across the three sites, there were one Verigene Reader and 12
Verigene Processor SPs utilized per site for testing during the study. The testing for this
study was performed using multiple lots (at least 4 lots at each site) of Test Cartridges,
Extraction Trays and Amplification Trays at each site. Verigene Processor SPs and
Verigene Readers used in these studies were standard production instruments. The
software revisions were validated for intended use according to documented test
protocols and developed according to Standard Operating Procedures.
Clinical nasopharyngeal specimens for the clinical study were collected prospectively at
three collection laboratory sites during the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 respiratory seasons.
The three collection sites were TriCore Reference Laboratories (TC), Esoterix/LabCorp
(ES) and University of North Carolina (UNC). Two of the sites, Esoterix and UNC
collected specimens in universal transport medium (UTM) and one site, TriCore,
collected specimens in M5 medium.
Culture-based/DFA confirmation was performed on these prospectively-collected
specimens while still fresh and in an unfrozen state as part of normal laboratory practice.
Frozen specimens were only used when confirmation was performed by using nucleic
acid amplification tests (NAAT). Each site then saved the residual from these specimens,
which were de-identified on-site, frozen at -70°C, and shipped on dry ice to Nanosphere.
At Nanosphere, the specimens were stored at or below -70 °C.
Prior to distribution to the test sites, the specimens were randomized by using the random
generator function in Microsoft Excel (2007). Each specimen was blinded and labeled
with a Nanosphere-generated unique identifier while removing the collection site
identifier. All specimen culture/DFA were kept blinded to all study personnel until RV+
testing was completed. The specimens were shipped to the testing sites overnight on dry
ice. The sites stored the specimens at -70°C before and after testing.

A total of 1022 specimens were tested at the three study sites (TC—314; MRI—385;
MCW— 323). All tests were performed by laboratory personnel at the three sites using
the RV+ on the Verigene System. Multiple lots of Amplification Trays, Extraction Trays
and Test Cartridges were used at each site. The Influenza A, Influenza B and RSV results
in the methods comparison study were compared to results obtained for the specimens
using culture-based methods confirmed with a FDA-cleared DFA test Influenza A
subtyping and RSV subtyping results were compared to results obtained for the
specimens utilizing bi-directional sequencing. Discordant results were resolved utilizing
bi-directional sequencing or an acceptable NAAT–based comparator. Bi-directional
sequencing was performed at an independent laboratory (ACGT; Wheeling, IL) and
footnoted in the performance comparison tables.
Per protocol, if a test resulted in a “No Call” or a “pre-analysis error” (“pre-ae”), the
specimen could be repeat tested. There were 34 “No Calls” and 25 “pre-aes” in the study.
Of these, 57 of the 59 specimens were repeat tested successfully. The other two “No
Call” specimens repeated as “No Calls”. Thus, in this study the total “No-Call” rate was
3.3% (34/1022) and the “pre-ae” failure rate was 2.4% (25/1022). The “pre-ae”, by
definition, is any test that did not go to completion regardless of the cause. A “pre-ae”
may occur due to a number of causes including a user- initiated procedure termination
(for example, upon realizing that an incorrect specimen was loaded) or an instrument-
initiated procedure termination (for example, because internal checks detect an
unexpected event), or due to an instrument failure, or non-availability of the Test
Substrate for analysis (due to test consumable breakage, etc).
Combined results for the methods comparison study across the three sites are presented
and reflect the results after all “no call” results were repeated per the protocol and the
proposed package insert guidance. Results from the RV+ were initially compared to
results from culture-based DFA methods. An FDA cleared NAAT was utilized to resolve
seven discrepant results between the RV+ and culture/DFA which had failed sequencing.
Bi-directional sequencing was used to subtype Influenza A, differentiate RSV A and
RSV B and for discordant testing. The tables below show results for Influenza A,
Influenza B, and RSV compared to culture/DFA with discordant resolution footnoted.
For subtyping results for Influenza A and RSV specimens, RV+ results are compared to a
composite comparator result obtained from culture/DFA followed by bi-directional
sequencing. Percent positive and negative agreement for each table are provided as well
as the lower and upper two-sided 95% confidence limits that were calculated using the
exact binomial methods in SAS 9.1.3 from: http://172.16.20.9/stat.html
The Influenza A combined results demonstrate strong results for the RV+ assay with a
Sensitivity of 98.7% (96.8-99.5%) and Specificity of 93.2% (91.1-94.8%). The lower
value for Percent Negative Agreement is due to a higher number of “false positives
(FPs)” that are apparent when the RV+ result is compared to culture/DFA/NAAT.
Almost all of these (FPs) are considered TPs (true positives) when compared to bi-
directional sequencing.
All 1022 patient nasopharyngeal swab specimens are accounted for in the combined
tables for Influenza A, Influenza B, and RSV. However, a small number of Influenza A
specimens that failed sequencing or did not produce a subtype result could not be placed
in the subtyping tables. For the Influenza A subtypes, 5 out of 1022 results (0.49%) were
24

--- Page 25 ---
either not subtyped by the RV+ or failed sequencing (i.e., results for only 1017 specimens
in the Influenza A subtype tables). Influenza B did not require sub-typing and, therefore,
the table contains all 1022 specimen results. Three specimens failed RSV subtype
sequencing and could not be included in the RSV subtyping tables (i.e., results for only
1019 specimens in the RSV subtype tables).

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not Applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
While the timing and duration of flu and RSV seasons can vary, the fall and winter months are
the peak times in the US. RSV infections in the US typically occur during annual community
outbreaks in the late fall, winter and early spring, and there may be variation in the timing of
outbreaks between regions and between communities in the same region.
During the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 flu seasons, 21% of 519,543 samples and 20% of 456,302
samples tested for influenza were positive for either Influenza A or Influenza B [based on data
from laboratories in the US which collaborated with World Health Organization (WHO) and
National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS)]. During the 2006 2007
and 2007- 2008 flu seasons, the prevalence was 13% of 179,268 samples tested and 18% of
225,329 samples tested, respectively.
According to data reported to the NREVSS, the prevalence of RSV was 15% in the 404,798
samples tested for RSV during the 2008- 2009 season and 16% in the 369,944 samples tested
during the 2007-2008 season.

In the Verigene Respiratory Virus Plus Nucleic Acid Test multi-site methods comparison study,
which analyzed 1022 samples collected during the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 flu season, the
prevalence of Influenza A was 30.0%, for Influenza B was 4.3%, and of RSV was 10.2%. No
dual infections were detected by culture and DFA, however, one specimen was detected by the
Verigene Respiratory Virus Plus Nucleic Acid Test to have both RSV A and RSV B. It is
recommended that the samples undergo repeat testing if nucleic acids from all three analytes are
detected in a single sample.
N. Instrument Name:
Verigene System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The RV+ on the Verigene platform functions as a sample-to-answer system in which all
sample processing steps as well as detections is carried out on a single use, disposable
test cartridge.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes __X__ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Each test cartridge handles one sample and has a unique barcode identifier that is scanned
into the Verigene system. Upon scanning the user is prompted to enter sample
information via barcode-reader or touch-screen interface thus linking patient information
to test cartridge. The cartridge and consumables are loaded onto the Verigene system
followed by the patient sample into the designated sample well and the test is initiated.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The steps automated within the Processor SP use test reagents that are self contained in
the test cartridge and include:
1. Sample Preparation/Extraction – Magnetic bead-based viral RNA isolation from
nasopharyngeal swab specimens
2. Target Amplification – Multiplex RT-PCR-based amplification of the eluted viral
RNA to generate virus-specific amplicons
3. Verigene Hybridization Test – Gold nanoparticle probe-based detection of the
virus-specific amplicons on a microarray
Upon completion of Specimen processing the cartridge is removed form the Verigene
processor and placed into the Verigene Reader for analysis
5. Calibration:
28

--- Page 29 ---
Not required. Test cartridges are single use and part of a closed system.
