I. Device Description:
The Elecsys hGH CalSet and hGH CalCheck 5 are lyophilized products consisting of human
growth hormone (hGH) in human serum matrix. The sponsor declared in the labeling that all
products derived from human blood are prepared exclusively from the blood of donors tested
individually and shown to be free from HBsAg and antibodies to HCV and HIV. The testing
methods applied were FDA-approved or cleared in compliance with the European Directive
98/79/EC, Annex II, List A.
During manufacture, the analyte is spiked into the matrix at the desired concentration levels.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The Elecsys hGH CalSet and CalCheck 5 are traceable to the NIBSC 98/574
international standard.
Value Assignment:
The Elecsys hGH CalSet assigned values are determined with the Elecsys hGH assay. A
master calibrator set is available and traceable to NIBSC 98/574. The assigned values for
Elecsys hGH CalSet are read from the master calibration curve. Kit Calibrator (CalSet)
values are assigned for each instrument platform (Elecsys 2010/cobas e 411 and
E170/cobas e 601/cobas e 602). The assigned lot-specific value is the median over a
minimum of 6 measurements (two runs on each analyzer, minimal of 3 analyzers of each
instrument platform).
For each Elecsys hGH CalCheck 5 lot manufactured, the CalChecks are assayed in
duplicate on at least three E170 analyzer measuring cells. The assigned value of each
CalCheck is defined as the median value obtained over at least 6 determinations of the
respective CalCheck. The assigned range is ± 30% of assigned value, in which 10% was
allotted for between-analyzer platform tolerance, 10% for stability tolerance and 10% for
precision of the assay. For additional analyzers, the same value assignment procedure is
performed.
Stability:
The stability study for CalSet was performed on cobas e 411. The stability study for
CalCheck was performed on E170. The stability protocol and the acceptance criteria have
been reviewed and found to be acceptable.
• Shelf-life stability:
The accelerated stability testing at 35°C supports an initial shelf-life claim of 18
months at 2-8°C for CalSet and CalCheck. Real-time testing at 2-8oC is on-going.
• Stability after reconstitution and freeze/thaw cycles:
Real time testing was performed and supports the following claims:
Reconstituted Elecsys hGH CalSet is stable for up to 7 days at 2 to 8°C; up to 28 days
at -15 to -25°C and 1 freeze/thaw cycle.
Reconstituted Elecsys hGH CalCheck 5 is stable for up to 5 hours at 20-25°C.
• On-board stability:
Real-time testing supports on-board stability of reconstituted CalSet for up to 5 hours
at 20-25°C.
The CalCheck products are not stored on-board the analyzer, therefore no on-board
stability claims are made.
