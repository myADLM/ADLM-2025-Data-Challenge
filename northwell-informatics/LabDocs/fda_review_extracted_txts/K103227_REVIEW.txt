L. Test Principle:
The Oratect Oral Fluid Drug Screen Device is based on a competitive immunoassay
procedure in which drug derivatives immobilized on the membrane compete with the
drug(s) which may be present in oral fluid for limited antibody binding sites on the
colored colloidal gold antibody conjugate.
When no drug is present in the sample, the colored colloidal gold antibody conjugate
will bind to the drug derivatives on the membrane to form visible bands at specific

Negative control is a synthetic oral fluid containing no drug.
Control standards are not supplied with this device but can be purchased
separately from Branan Medical Corporation. Users are advised to follow
federal, state and local guidelines for QC testing requirements.
Stability:
Accelerated studies have been conducted for the control material. Protocols
and acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. The
manufacturer claims that when stored un-opened at -15 ºC, the product is
stable until expiration date which is 24 months. Open vial stability is 7 days
when stored at 4 ºC. Real time studies have been conducted and are on-going.
Shipping/recovery study:
A shipping study was performed to demonstrate the recovery of drug from
oral fluid when collected in the Oratect polypropylene collection tube
(provided for confirmation testing) by testing the full range of expected
transport conditions (maximum time and temperature) for confirmation
testing. Conditions simulating transport to 3 different destination sites with
varied weather conditions (2-8ºC, room temperature and 40ºC) were
performed. Negative oral fluid samples in glass bottles were spiked with a
single analyte/bottle to concentrations of -50% and +50% of the cutoff. The
samples were tested on the Oratect Oral Fluid Drug Screen device and the
results were recorded. One (1) ml of each sample was transferred/pippetted
into an amber glass vial for testing on the reference method (LC/MS/MS).

Potential interference from structurally unrelated and endogenous compounds
were tested by spiking the potentially interfering compound into human oral
fluid drug controls having drug concentration at +/-25 % of the cutoff.
All were tested at a concentration of 10,000 ng/mL. If a false result was
observed the testing was repeated at the +/-50% of the cutoff for drug. No
negative or positive interference was seen in this study.

Potential interference from pH was tested by using human oral fluid controls
at drug concentrations of +/25 and +/-50% of the cutoff. The pH of the
samples was adjusted to various pH levels ranging from 4.5-8.5 in 1 pH unit
increments. No negative or positive interference from pH was observed.
The following potential interferents were evaluated by spiking into human
oral fluid controls having drug concentrations at +/-25% and +-50% of the
cutoff : Alcohol, Mouthwash, MSG, Baking soda, Cough Syrup, Cranberry
juice, Salt, Sugar, Toothpaste, Gum, Orange juice, food coloring (red, blue
and green), Tea and cola. None of these substances caused positive or
negative interference. Prior to the test being administered the donor was
instructed not to eat, drink, smoke or chew tobacco. Potential interference
from cigarette smoking, was evaluated by asking a participant to smoke a
cigarette, after 15 minutes an oral fluid sample was collected and spiked with
each drug at concentrations of cutoff +/-25 % and +/-50%. None of these
substances caused positive or negative interference.
There is the possibility that other substances and/or factors not listed above
may interfere with the test and cause false results, e.g., technical or procedural
errors.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed
cutoff concentration appears in the precision section, M.1.a, above.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Performance for the Oratect Oral Fluid Drug Screen Device was evaluated at
typical point-of-care sites with a total of 3 operators who are typical operators
at these sites. Operators collected samples from volunteer donors by swabbing
the mouth and testing on the proposed device. Immediately after collecting the
sample the volunteer was asked to spit into the confirmation collection tube
for testing and comparison to the GC/MS. The operators were only provided
the labeling to perform the testing. The results are presented in the table
below:
