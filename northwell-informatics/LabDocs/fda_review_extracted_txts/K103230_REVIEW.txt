K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
ISO 15197. In vitro diagnostic test systems. Requirements for blood-glucose monitoring
systems for self-testing in managing diabetes mellitus.
L. Test Principle:
The AP-3000 and AP-3000multi Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems use electrochemical
methodologies. The systems quantitatively measure blood glucose levels using an
amperometric method, which involves detecting the current produced from glucose
oxidation. The electrons generated during this reaction are transferred from the blood to the
electrodes. The magnitude of the resultant current is proportional to the concentration of
glucose in the specimen and the signal is converted into a readout displayed on the meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The AP-3000 and AP-3000multi Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems are the same meters
and use the same test strip; however they have separate names due to their different
indications for use (single- vs. multiple-patient use).
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run precision was measured by using five spiked venous whole blood samples
(hematocrit ranging from 35% to 50%). Each sample was tested on three lots of test
strips on ten meters. Ten replicates were tested per meter, test strip lot, and glucose
concentration, (n=100 tests per test strip lot). Results are summarized below:
Sample Mean Strip Lot SD (mg/dL) %CV
(mg/dL)

Each sample was tested on three lots of test strips, twenty replicates per day for ten
days using ten meters, (n=200 tests per test strip lot). Results are summarized below:
Sample Mean Strip Lot SD (mg/dL) %CV
(mg/dL)

3 325 1 7.2 2.2
2 7.1 2.2
3 6.8 2.1
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed using ten spiked venous whole blood samples with
the following concentrations: 10, 19, 42, 72, 123, 172, 260, 366, 480 and 595 mg/dL,
which ranged from 10 to 595 mg/dL. All samples were tested on three lots of test
strips, ten meters (ten measurements per test strip lot), on the AP-3000 Blood Glucose
Meter. Glucose concentrations were tested on the YSI 2300 analyzer to generate the
expected values. The observed values were plotted against the expected values and
an appropriate line fitted by standard linear regression was generated with results
summarized below:
Linear Regression Analysis:
Lot 1: y = 0.9793x + 0.989, r2= 0.9992.
Lot 2: y = 0.9677x + 2.171, r2= 0.9993.
Lot 3: y = 0.9764x + 1.064, r2= 0.9996.
Based upon the results, the sponsor claims a measurement range of 20 to 600 mg/dL
for the AP-3000 and AP-3000multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Two levels of Control Solution (Level I and II) are included with each test kit. For
each glucose control solution, a reference measurement was taken using an YSI 2300
analyzer. One hundred fifty measurements obtained with candidate meters were
performed (30 bottles * 5 measurements/per bottle) for each glucose control solution
and the mean value, SD and CV were calculated. Level I and II glucose control
solutions were found to have ranges of 70-77 mg/dL and 200-215 mg/dL,
respectively.
Stability characteristics of both levels of Glucose Control Solutions were determined
using real time studies. The open vial stability was evaluated at 2, 25 and 30oC (all
temperatures at 50% humidity), while the unopened vial stability was evaluated at
25oC (50% humidity). The sponsor claimed open vial stability of 90 days stored at 2
to 30oC and an unopened vial stability of 20 months stored at 25oC.

The stability characteristics of the test strips were evaluated in real-time open and
closed vial studies. Open vial stability was determined by evaluating test strips stored
at three temperature s (4, 30 and 40°C; 60% humidity) during a 100 day period.
Closed vial stability was determined by evaluating test strips stored at three
temperatures (4, 25 and 40°C; 50% humidity) during a 20 month period. Based upon
their results, the sponsor claims an open vial stability of 90 days and an unopened
shelf-life stability of 20 months stored at 4 to 40°C.
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the AP‐3000 and AP-3000multi Blood Glucose Monitoring
System is 20 to 600 mg/dL. This range was verified by the linearity study (see
section M.1.b.).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing of exogenous and endogenous substances was performed using a
protocol based on CLSI EP7-A. A venous blood sample (hematocrit level of 40
±2%) was adjusted to two different glucose concentrations (125 and 250 mg/dL).
Each potential interfering substance was added at several concentrations to an aliquot
of each of the two glucose concentrations (test) and compared to the same sample
without the potential interfering substance (control). Each interferent-glucose sample
was tested using ten different meters and three lots of test strips. The YSI 2300
glucose analyzer was used as the reference method. The results are as follows:
The following substances up to concentrations listed shall have
no significant effect on test results (≤±10% difference)
Acetaminophen 0.5 mg/dL

3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger palm,
forearm, upper arm, calf, and thigh which can be applied directly to the test strip.
5. Calibration:
The AP-3000 and AP-3000multi Blood Glucose Meters must be calibrated with the code
found on the current test strip vial label. No further calibration is required.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor has two levels of controls (Level I and II) supplied with this meter. When a
test strip is inserted into the meter, each control can be measured by following the
instructions for “Quality Control Testing” provided in the User Manual for the meter. An
acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is
instructed to contact Customer Service if the control results fall outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
· A usability study was performed to assess the readability of the labeling for the US
market by surveying the 150 lay users that participated in the study. Participants
varied in age, education, and gender. These lay users also completed a questionnaire
to response to whether the device is easy to use and the ‘Instructions for use’ were
written in a way that makes it easy to use. The majority of the users responded that
the device is very easy to use.
· Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the results showed that the
labeling (User’s Guide, test strip package insert and control solution package insert)
was written at the 8th grade level.
· Customer service is available between 8:30 am and 5:30 PM-Pacific Standard Time,
Monday through Friday. Users are instructed to contact their healthcare providers
outside hours of operation. The toll free US phone number is 1-888-873-1021 for
customer support.
· The device is intended for single (AP-3000 Blood Glucose Monitoring System) and
multiple-patient use (AP-3000multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System). Caviwipe

use with the blood glucose meter and the lancing device (for use only with the single-
patient use system). The sponsor also demonstrated that there was no change in
performance or in the external materials of the meter and lancing device after 18,250
cleaning and disinfection cycles for the meter (5000 cycles for the lancing device)
designed to simulate 5 years of device use. Each robustness cycle tested consisted of
one pre-clean wipe and one disinfecting wipe. Labeling was reviewed for adequate
instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
· EMC testing was evaluated and certified by Electronics Testing Center and a test
report was submitted stating that the AP-3000 passed all tests; dated July 30, 2010.
· Temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated for temperatures
ranging from -20 to 50oC and relative humidity ranging from 0 to 93%. Protocol and
acceptance criteria were provided and found to be acceptable. The results support the
sponsor’s claimed operating temperature of 4 to 40oC and humidity range of 0 to
85%.
· A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of altitude of the AP-3000 BGMS. A
venous blood sample adjusted to five different glucose concentrations (54, 81, 126,
271 and 453 mg/dL) was tested on two meters and a single lot of test strips. Each
venous blood sample was evaluated by the YSI 2300 glucose analyzer. Tests were
performed at six different elevations (sea level, 2624 feet, 4921 feet, 6266 feet, 7119
feet and 10,742 feet). The meter readings obtained were compared to the YSI
method, the percent bias against the YSI results was calculated and all results were
found to support the sponsor claims that the AP-3000 BGMS can be used at altitudes
up to 10,742 feet.
· A study was conducted to evaluate the potential interference from hematocrit using
seven different hematocrit levels (15%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60% and 70%). For
each hematocrit level, five different glucose concentrations (10, 70, 170, 285 and 450
mg/dL) were tested against the YSI-2300 Glucose Analyzer. Each glucose
level/hematocrit combination was tested on twenty meters and two lots of test strips.
The differences of the glucose meter results at each hematocrit/glucose combination
were calculated against YSI-2300 Glucose Analyzer results at 40% hematocrit. The
bias relative to YSI was acceptable to support the claim that hematocrit levels of 20 to
60% do not significantly affect the glucose results.
· A sample volume study was performed to verify the test strip sample volume
requirement for the AP-3000 BGMS. A venous blood sample adjusted to three
glucose concentrations (66, 105 and 230 mg/dL) was tested on one lot of test strips
and ten meters. Each blood sample was applied to test strips at five sample volumes
(0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0 and 1.1 ml). Protocols and acceptance criteria were provided
and found to be acceptable. The sponsor concluded that sample volume of ≥0.7 mL
produced accurate results.
