4. Special instrument requirements:
Instruments listed on the value sheet include the following: Roche Integra 400,
Roche Cobas c501, Ortho Clinical Vitros 5,1 FS, Beckman Coulter Immage 800
I. Device Description:
The MSC Lipid Control is a human serum based liquid quality control containing
stabilized HDL-C, LDL-C, CHOL, TRIG, Apo AI and Apo B of human origin.
The device consists of a total of six vials with each vial representing two levels:
Level 1 at 3 x 10mL and Level 2 at 3 x 10mL. Material of human origin was
tested at the donor level using FDA approved methods and found to be non-
reactive for HBsAg and to antibodies to HCV and HIV-1/2.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Values assigned to the assayed quality controls are traceable to the reference
standards used by the assay manufacturer to establish instrument response in
their assays.
Stability:
Shelf-life – The sponsor provided accelerated stability data demonstrating that
the MSC Lipid Control can be stored for 12 months at -10° to 20°C.
Open vial – The sponsor provided data demonstrating that upon opening a vial
of MSC Lipid Control, the material is stable for 30 days at 2 - 8°C.
Real-time stability studies are on-going, but current data is supportive of the
above claims.
Value assignment:
The two level MSC Lipid Control was tested at independent laboratories using
different clinical systems: Roche Integra 400, Roche Cobas c501, Ortho
Clinical Vitros 5,1 FS, and Beckman Coulter Immage 800. At least 20
independent runs were performed in singlicate. Data were collected,
statistically analyzed, and the range calculated for each clinical platform
(n>20 per platform). The range represents ±2SD (95.5% CI) around the
system mean recovery. The mean and range are provided in tabular and
graphical form in the value assignment sheet.
