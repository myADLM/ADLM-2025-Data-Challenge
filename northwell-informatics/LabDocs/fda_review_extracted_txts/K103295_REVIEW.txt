2. Indication(s) for use:
QuickScreen Cocaine 150 Test Models 9050T, 9051
The QuickScreen Cocaine 150 Test is an in-vitro diagnostic test for the
detection/presence of cocaine (benzoylecgonine) in urine. The cut-off
concentration is 150 ng/mL. Measurements obtained by this device are used in the
diagnosis and treatment of drug abuse. This test is intended for point-of-care
testing.
This test provides only preliminary test result. A more specific alternate testing
method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory
method. Other confirmation methods are available. Clinical consideration and
professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result,
particularly when preliminary positive results are observed.
QuickScreen Multi Drug Screening Test: Model 9339T
The QuickScreen Multi Drug Screening Test is an in-vitro diagnostic test for the
qualitative detection of amphetamine, cocaine, methamphetamine, opiates, PCP,
barbiturates, benzodiazepines, methadone and THC in urine. Tests for barbiturates
cannot distinguish between abused drugs and certain prescribed medications.
Measurements obtained by this device are used in the diagnosis and treatment of
drug abuse. This test is intended for point-of-care testing.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None were referenced
L. Test Principle:
The device employs lateral flow immunochromatographic technology and is based on
the principle of competitive binding. Drugs, if present in concentrations below the
cutoff level, will not saturate the binding sites of the antibody coated particles on the
drug specific test strips. The goat-anti-rabbit IgG antibody-coated particles will then
be captured by immobilized drug-specific conjugate. If the level of drug in the urine
specimen is below the cutoff concentration, the T line appears as a visible burgundy
line. If the level of drug in the urine specimen is above the cutoff, no T line develops.
The control line (C line) serves as an internal quality control of certain testing steps. It
should always appear as a burgundy-colored band regardless of the presence of the
drug if enough sample volume has been added to the test and if sample has correctly
migrated up the test strip.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed using drug-free urine spiked to the
following concentrations: cutoff, +/-25%, +/-50%, +/-75% and 200% of the
cutoff. Also, a negative control was tested over the 20 days. The samples were
aliquots, randomized and blinded. A total of 20 determinations were made at
each concentration. Testing was performed once a day over 20 days by 3

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable, the device is intended for qualitative use.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Procedural controls are included in the test strip and device. A colored line
appearing in the control zone is considered as an internal procedural control. It
confirms sufficient specimen volume and adequate membrane wicking. Users
are informed not to interpret the test if no red line appears in the control zone.
Control standards are not supplied with these tests; however it is
recommended that positive and negative controls be tested as a good
laboratory practice to confirm the test procedure and to verify proper test
performance. User should follow local, state and federal guidelines for testing
QC material.
Accelerated and real time studies for the device have been conducted.
Protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable.
The manufacturer claims the following expiration date:
When stored at 15–28 ºC product is good until expiration date which is 20
months.
Real time studies have been conducted and are on-going.
Read time Stability was performed for Quickscreen Drug Screen Dip Card,
Cup and Cassette. Five urine samples containing drug at the following
concentration (zero, +/-25% and +/-50% of the cutoff) were used to perform

60 sec-20 minutes. Data supports the recommended read time of 5 minutes
for each device.
d. Detection limit:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed
cutoff concentration appears in the assay cut-off section, M.1.a, above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was established by spiking structurally related compounds
into drug-free urine and diluting each to obtain various concentrations. Results
are expressed as a minimum concentration of metabolite or compound
required to produce a response approximately equivalent to the cutoff
concentration of the assay.

Evaluation of SG and pH on test results:
To test for possible positive and/or negative interference drug free urine were
adjusted to the following pH concentrations 4.0, 5.0. 6.0, 7.0, 8.0 and 9.0.
Each of these samples were divided into five aliquots: urine, containing drug
at +/-25% and +/-50% of the cutoff. Each sample was assayed in triplicate.
No negative or positive interference due to pH was observed.
To test for possible positive and/or negative interference from specific gravity 5
urine samples having specific gravity from 1.002-1.040 were used. These samples
had GC/MS concentration at +/-25% and +/-50% of the cutoff.
Each sample was assayed in triplicate. No negative or positive interference
due to specific gravity was observed.
The testing results demonstrate that varying pH’s and specific gravities do not
affect urine testing results around each analyte cut-off.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed
cutoff concentration appears in the precision section, M1.a, above.

regarding the directions for performing the test, the ease of performing the test, directions
for interpreting the results, and ease of interpretation of the results. These questionnaires
demonstrated that the test instructions were easy to understand and that the testing
procedure was easy to perform and the results were easy to read.
