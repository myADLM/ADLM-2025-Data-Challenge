The Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm (ROMA™) is a qualitative serum test
that combines the results of HE4 EIA, ARCHITECT CA125 II™ and menopausal
status into a numerical score.
ROMA is intended to aid in assessing whether a premenopausal or
postmenopausal woman who presents with an ovarian adnexal mass is at high or
low likelihood of finding malignancy on surgery. ROMA is indicated for women
who meet the following criteria: over age 18; ovarian adnexal mass present for
which surgery is planned, and not yet referred to an oncologist. ROMA must be
interpreted in conjunction with an independent clinical and radiological
assessment. The test is not intended as a screening or stand-alone diagnostic
assay.
PRECAUTION: The ROMA (HE4 EIA+ARCHITECT CA125 II) should not be
used without an independent clinical/radiological evaluation and is not intended
to be a screening test or to determine whether a patient should proceed to surgery.
Incorrect use of the ROMA (HE4 EIA+ARCHITECT CA125 II) carries the risk
of unnecessary testing, surgery, and/or delayed diagnosis.

I. Device Description:
The ROMA is a qualitative serum test that combines the results of 2 analytes, HE4
(HE4 EIA) and CA 125 (ARCHITECT CA 125II) and menopausal status into a
numerical score between 0.0 and 10.0. The premenopausal or postmenopausal status
must be based on ovarian function determined with information available from
clinical evaluation and medical history.
The test system consists of the manual HE4 EIA and ARCHITECT CA 125II assays,
reagents, instrument and software (calculator tool) used to obtain the ROMA test
result. The ROMA instructions for use and calculator tool are provided in the kit.
Users are instructed to use only the assay kits identified by Fujirebio Diagnostic Inc.
The immunoassays are performed according to the manufactures’ directions detailed
in each product insert.
Both manual HE4 EIA and ARCHITECT CA 125 II are previously cleared devices
((k072939 and k042731 respectively). The HE4 EIA is an enzyme immunometric
assay for the quantitative determination of HE4 in human serum and was previously
cleared as an aid in monitoring recurrence or progressive disease in patients with
epithelial ovarian cancer. ARCHITECT CA 125 II assay is a Chemiluminescent
Microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA) for the quantitative determination of CA 125
reactive determinants in human serum and plasma on the ARCHITECT i System and
was previously cleared as an aid in monitoring response to therapy for patients with
epithelial ovarian cancer.
Using an algorithm and the value of the 2 analytes, ROMA scores (numerical score
from 0.0-10.0) for both premenopausal and postmenopausal will be calculated and
indicate a low likelihood or high likelihood for finding malignancy on surgery.

L. Test Principle:
The HE4 EIA is a solid-phase, non-competitive immunoassay based upon the direct
sandwich technique using two monoclonal antibodies, 2H5 and 3D8, directed against
two epitopes in the C-WFDC domain of HE4. One antibody, 2H5, serves as capture
antibody, and the other antibody, 3D8, serves as detecting antibody. Calibrators,
controls and patient samples are incubated together with biotinylated capture antibody
in streptavidin coated microstrips. The strips are then washed and incubated with
enzyme-labeled detection antibody. After washing, the buffered substrate/chromogen
reagent is added to each well and the enzyme reaction is allowed to proceed. The

intensity of the color is proportional to the amount of HE4 present in the samples.
The color intensity is determined in a microplate spectrophotometer at 620 nm (or
optionally at 405 nm after addition of Stop Solution). Calibration curves are
constructed for each assay by plotting absorbance value versus the concentration for
each calibrator. The HE4 concentrations of patient samples are then read from the
calibration curve. The HE4 EIA Kit measures concentrations between 15 and 900
pM.
The ARCHITECT CA125 II assay is a two-step sandwich technique immunoassay to
determine the presence of OC 125 defined antigen in human serum and plasma using
CMIA technology with flexible assay protocols, referred to as Chemiflex. In the first
step of the assay, sample and antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-OC 125) coated
paramagnetic microparticles are combined. CA 125 reactive determinants present in
the sample bind to the antibody coated microparticles. After washing, a second
acridinium-labeled antibody conjugate is added in the second step. Pre-Trigger and
Trigger Solutions are then added to the reaction mixture; the resulting
chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). A direct
relationship exists between the amount of CA 125 reactive determinants in the sample
and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT™ i optical system.
For calculation of the ROMA score, the user enters results of HE4 EIA and
ARCHITECT CA 125 II into the calculator tool following the manufacturer’s
instruction. The calculator tool is included in the kit. Using an algorithm and the
value of the 2 analytes, ROMA scores (numerical score from 0.0-10.0) for both
premenopausal and postmenopausal will be calculated and indicate a low likelihood
or high likelihood for finding malignancy on surgery. Both premenopausal and
postmenopausal ROMA results will be reported to the ordering physician who will
decide which result to use based on patient's menopausal status
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance: Both HE4 EIA and ARCHITECT CA 125 II are
previously cleared devices. Analytical performance for HE4 EIA and
ARCHITECT CA 125 II were validated in k072939 and k042731 respectively.
Sponsor stated that there has been no modification of assay methods for HE4 EIA
and ARCHITECT CA 125 II for used in the calculation of the ROMA score.
Thus, limited study was done to evaluate the analytical performance of the
ROMA score.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Lot-to-Lot Precision: A panel of five serum samples was tested using three
lots of HE4 EIA and three lots of ARCHITECT CA 125 II reagent and
calibrator kits. The study was repeated for 5 days, two runs per day with the
samples analyzed in two replicates per run for ARCHITECT CA 125 II and
four replicates per run for the HE4 EIA. The two runs per day were separated
by a minimum of 2 hours. All runs were performed according to each assay’s
package insert. The overall study was performed based CLSI guideline EP5-
A2 entitled “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative

For the ROMA score using premenopausal status, the between lots %CV for
five samples was <3.52% and the total %CV was <7.72%. For the ROMA
score using postmenopausal status, the between lots %CV was <1.33% for
five samples and the total %CV was <4.10%. The results met the sponsor’s
acceptant criteria.
Site-to-site reproducibility: Three sites were involved for the site-to-site
reproducibility by testing a panel of 5 serum samples with one lot of HE4 EIA
and one lot of ARCHITECT CA 125 II reagent and calibrator kits. At each
site, the assay was repeated for 6 days performing two runs per day with the
samples analyzed in two replicates per run for ARCHITECT CA 125 II and
four replicates per run for the HE4 EIA. The two runs per day were separated
by a minimum of 2 hours. For HE4 EIA, two operators performed the test and
each operator performed at non-consecutive days of testing. For
ARCHITECT CA 125 II assay, a single operator was responsible at each site
for all runs of testing. All runs were performed according to each assay’s
package insert. Both premenopausal and postmenopausal ROMA scores were
calculated using separate algorithm both manually and by using ROMA
calculator Tool Software CD (BETA version 0.00.15). The precision for

Simulation precision: In order to demonstrate precision of all possible
combinations of analytes, a simulation precision study for ROMA score was
conducted based on the precision profiles of HE4 and CA 125 with different
combinations of values of these two analytes. The statistical analysis of
simulation of ROMA score precision showed acceptable precision covering
the range of ROMA score from 0 to10.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Each assay uses its own calibrator and controls.
HE4 EIA calibrators and controls: Ig-HE4 is a fusion protein consisting of a
human Fc antibody fragment and Human Epididymis protein HE4. The Ig-
HE4 antigen is used as a calibrator protein in the HE4 assay to determine HE4
concentrations in human serum samples. The protein is produced in a stably
transfected Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line. The cell line was
adapted to serum free growth medium at Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc.
Recombinant antigen is used to prepare calibrators for the HE4 EIA Kit.

ARCHITECT CA 125 II calibrators and controls: The OC125 defined antigen
is used in the ARCHITECT CA 125 II Calibrators and Controls. The
concentrations are specific to each calibrator and control level. This material
is obtained from Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc. proprietary human ovarian
carcinoma cell line, McDonalds. OC 125 defined antigen is produced by the
McDonalds cell line. The stock solution for calibrators is prepared by adding
OC 125 defined antigen to a diluent to achieve the desired concentrations.
The stock solution is tested to determine its actual concentration. Each
Calibrator and Control is then prepared based on the actual concentration of
the stock solution.
Stability:
Specimen: ROMA is intended for use with serum. The specimen stability and
storage claims are limited to the HE4 EIA assay. Serum can be stored at 2–
8°C for 3 days before being tested. Samples can be stored at -40°C or colder
for longer periods.
Calibration Curve: For HE4 EIA, the calibration is generated with every run.
For CA125 II, the calibration curve is stable up to 30 days.
Reagent Closed-Vial: Users are instructed to refer to the individual stability
information in the package insert of each assay. The claimed stability for HE4
EIA is up to 18 month at 2–8°C. The claimed shelf life for ATCHITECT is
12 months at 2–8°C. Reagent stability for ROMA is limited to 2–8 °C for 12
months.
Reagent Open-Vial: Users are instructed to refer to the stability information
in the package insert for reagents used in the individual assay. The stability of

d. Detection limit:
The limits of detection and limits of quantitation reported in each assay’s
package insert are incorporated into the algorithm such that results outside of
the measuring interval are not imported and do not yield an ROMA score.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference: Studies were conducted to evaluate the interference of ROMA
score by hemoglobin, bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated), lipid
(triglyceride), rheumatoid factor (RF), and human anti-mouse antibodies
(HAMA). CLSI guideline, EP7-A “Interference Testing in Clinical
Chemistry, Approved Guideline”, was used to design the interference
experiments. Three pooled serum samples with ROMA score at low (~0.56
for premenopausal and ~0.98 for postmenopausal), medium (~1.32 for
premenopausal and ~2.42 for postmenopausal) and high (~3.11 for
premenopausal and ~5.30 for postmenopausal) were used in the studies.
These samples were then supplemented with each interfering substance. The
control samples were prepared without corresponding interfering substance.
The control samples and test samples were tested in replicates of five (5)
using both HE4 EIA and ARCHITECT CA 125 II. The ROMA score was
calculated for each sample and its control sample using a mean of 5 replicates
of HE4 EIA and the mean of 5 replicates of ARCHITECT CA 125 II. The
effect of each interfering substance on the ROMA score was assessed by
comparing the measurement of each test sample to the control. Acceptance
criteria for interference were <10% difference between the sample with
interferent and control. The summary of the result is shown below:

Except for RF, no significant interference is indicated at the concentrations
evaluated for all interferent substances tested. Specimens containing levels of
RF at 500 IU/mL and 1000 IU/mL showed >10% difference between the
sample with RF and control with 12.6% and 28.2% respectively. The results
indicated that specimens containing levels of RF above 250 IU/mL interfere
with the ROMA score and are not appropriate for ROMA test.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity/Clinical Specificity:
Clinical study was done to validate ROMA in pre- and postmenopausal
women presenting to a generalist with an adnexal mass, for whom a decision
to undergo surgery has been made. The study is severed as validation set in
the general population, or Pivotal Trial, of the algorithm previously developed
in the Pilot Study.
The validation study was a prospective, multi-center, blinded, clinical trial
that enrolled a total of 512 patients at the 13 study sites. The patients were
female patients over 18, presenting to a generalist at a general or specialty
hospital with an ovarian cyst or an adnexal mass (defined as a simple,
complex or a solid ovarian/pelvic mass) and were scheduled to undergo
surgery. Blood samples were collected from all patients and tested on the
HE4 EIA and ARCHITECT CA 125 II at Fujirebio Diagnostics AB.
Menopausal status was determined for all subjects first by completing chart
review and, if menopausal status was not defined, it was determined by age
(≤49 pre-menopausal and ≥55 postmenopausal), 1 year post menses, and
Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) level. The Initial Cancer Risk
Assessment (ICRA) and all clinical information relating to the surgical
procedures, including imaging reports and final pathology reports, were
collected. All patients underwent surgery and tissues were examined by local
pathologists. An independent pathologist, Director, Division of Anatomic
Pathology, from the University of Maryland School of Medicine, reviewed all
imaging reports, case report forms and histopathology reports from each
patient’s institution pathologist, checking for discrepancies in the data. The
performance of standalone use of ICRA, standalone use of ROMA and
adjunctive use of ICRA and ROMA were evaluated by comparing to
histopathology results for detecting the presence of ovarian malignancy.
A total of 512 patients were enrolled at the 13 study sites and ICRA was
10

--- Page 11 ---
completed for 486 patients. Among them, ICRA of 370 patients (76.1%) were
completed by general Obstetrician/Gynecologists. For the 116 remaining
patients, the ICRAs were completed by other specialists including family
medicine specialists (9.5%), internal medicine specialist (4.3%), and other
specialists (e.g., gynecologic oncologists, medical oncologists, general
surgeons) (less than 1%).
Of the 512 patients, 51 patients were excluded from analysis. The most
common reason for exclusion was no surgery was performed to remove an
adnexal mass. In the final total of 461 (90.0%) evaluable patients, 240
(52.1%) were premenopausal and 221 (47.9%) were postmenopausal. All of
the major racial groups were represented with 85% of White, 7% of Black,
3% Hispanic, 3% Asian, and 2% of other ethnicity.
Among the 461 evaluable patients, 375 (81.3%) had a diagnosis of benign
disease, 48 (10.4%) was diagnosis with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and
38 (8.2%) were diagnosed with other cancers or low malignant potential
(LMP) tumors. The statistics for enrolled subjects with pathology
classification are summarized in the following table.

The ROMA test used the following cut points to evaluate the performance of
the test in pre- and postmenopausal women presenting to a generalist with an
adnexal mass, for whom a decision to undergo surgery has been made:
Premenopausal:
ROMA score ≥ 1.31 High likelihood of finding malignancy
ROMA score < 1.31 Low likelihood of finding malignancy
Postmenopausal:
ROMA score ≥ 2.77 High likelihood of finding malignancy
ROMA score < 2.77 Low likelihood of finding malignancy
The information provided by the ROMA test should be used by physician only
as an adjunctive test to complement, not replace, other diagnostic and clinical
procedures. The ability of ROMA to contribute to the ICRA was evaluated by

comparing the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV) and
negative predictive values (NPV) for standalone use of ROMA, and
adjunctive use of ICRA and ROMA based on four sets of diagnosis: EOC;
EOC, including LMP tumors; All Cancers; All Cancers, including LMP
tumors. For each set of diagnosis, the results were cross-tabulated in a 2x2x2
table of the malignancy as determined by histopathology, test result (positive
or negative) by ICRA, and test result (positive/high likelihood or negative/low
likelihood) by ROMA.
The performance of ROMA evaluated for diagnosis of EOC including LMP
and diagnosis of all cancer including LMP are presented below.
Performance of ROMA for Diagnosis of EOC including LMP:
Combined pre- and postmenopausal subjects:
For diagnosis of EOC including LMP, the counts for combined pre- and
postmenopausal subjects with malignancy by pathology and with no
malignancy by pathology are summarized in separate tables below.

The same information about the frequencies of malignancy is presented by the
likelihood ratios: Likelihood ratio (Result) = Pr(Result|Malignancy) /
Pr(Result|No Malignancy). Likelihood ratio is a way of quantifying how
much a given test result changes the pre-test probability of malignancy in a
patient.

ICRA “Negative” and ROMA “Positive” 0.80 0.40% − 1.02%
ICRA “Negative” and ROMA “Negative” 0.14 0.06% − 0.19%
The likelihood ratio for identifying malignancy by adjunctive use of ROMA
and ICRA is 9.94, almost 2 times higher than the likelihood ratio by ICRA
alone (4.91). The performance of adjunctive use of ROMA and ICRA for
diagnosis of EOC including LMP was further evaluated by calculating
sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV and compared to standalone use of
ICRA. The table below shows the performance characteristics of the tests.

With adjunctive use of ICRA and ROMA, sensitivity for malignancy
increased from 77.3% to 90.0%. Specificity for malignancy decreased from
84.3% to 67.2%. PPV for the adjunctive use of ICRA and ROMA decreased
from 46.4% to 32.8% due to an increase in the number of false positive test
added by addition of ROMA to ICRA. However, NPV of adjunctive use of
ICRA and ROMA increased from 95.5% to 97.7%. The confidence interval
for 2.2% increase of NPV was 0.43% to 3.98%. This observed increase in
NPV was statistically significant, supporting the improved performance with
adjunctive use of ICRA and ROMA compared to standalone ICRA.
Pre-menopausal subjects:
To evaluate the ROMA for diagnosis of EOC including LMP in

The prevalence of EOC including LMP for premenopausal women was 6.8%.
For premenopausal subjects, comparing to ICRA only, the sensitivity for
malignancy by adjunctive use of ICRA and ROMA increased from 43.8% to
81.3%, and specificity for malignancy decreased from 90.0% to 68.6%. PPV
for the adjunctive use of ICRA and ROMA decreased from 24.1% to 15.9%

Compared to use of ICRA alone, sensitivity of addition of ROMA to ICRA
increased 15.1% (from 73.3% to 88.4%) and specificity decreased from 84.3%
to 67.2%. PPV for the adjunctive use of ICRA and ROMA decreased from
46.4% to 32.8% due to an increase in the number of false positive test added
by addition of ROMA to ICRA. NPV of adjunctive use of ICRA and ROMA
increased 2.97% (from 95.5% to 97.7%) with 95% of the confidence interval
of 0.91%-5.03%. Such observed increase in NPV with addition of ROMA to
ICRA was statistically significant, supporting the improved performance with
adjunctive use of ICRA and ROMA comparing to ICRA only.

Ability of Adjunctive Use of ROMA and ICRA to Identifying Additional
Malignancies:
The Table below shows the counts of cancers identified by adjunctive use of
ROMA and ICRA compared to by ICRA alone.
Cancers Premenopausal Postmenopausal Combined
EOC 4 0 4
EOC + LMP 6 3 9
All Cancers 6 2 8
All Cancers + LMP 8 5 13
According to sponsor, addition of ROMA to ICRA detected 13 additional
cancers missed by the ICRA with an acceptable rate of concomitant false
positives.
Association between the ROMA Score and Likelihood of Malignancy:
Summary statistics for the ROMA scores, for subjects who had a primary
ovarian malignancy are given by cancer stage in the table below.
Stage I Stage II Stage III

Pre-menopausal
Mean 3.81 9.37 8.36
Post-menopausal N 19 4 33
Mean 4.39 5.49 8.51
To demonstrate whether higher ROMA is associated with an increased
likelihood of cancer, additional analysis was conducted by splitting the
patients at the cut-off point and finding the median ROMA score within each
split gives two balanced groups below the cutoff and additional groups above.
The results were summarized below.

b. Other clinical supportive data:
According to the sponsor, algorithm for ROMA was developed by using a
training set obtained by pooling data across two separate Pilot Studies at two
sites and combined CA 125 and HE4 concentrations in a logistic model and
provides a probability of finding cancer in a given patient. In that study, the
cut-off was determined to achieve a specificity of 75%. Also, 80% sensitivity
was set as the required minimum sensitivity for the score for premenopausal
and postmenopausal women combined as the threshold for acceptance of this
analysis. The cut-points defined by 75% specificity were 1.31 for
premenopausal patients and 2.77 for postmenopausal patients.
4. Clinical cut-off:
The following cut-offs are used to interpret the result. The ROMA score is
between 0.0 and 10.0.
Premenopausal women:
ROMA score ≥1.31 High likelihood of finding malignancy
ROMA score <1.31 Low likelihood of finding malignancy
Postmenopausal women:
ROMA score ≥2.77 High likelihood of finding malignancy
ROMA score <2.77 Low likelihood of finding malignancy
5. Expected values/Reference range:
In order to determine the normal and reference ranges of ROMA score in healthy
women, 120 premenopausal samples and 120 postmenopausal samples (total =
240 samples) were tested. Samples covered age ranging from 20 to 87 and
represented whites (96.7%), African American (2.5%) and Hispanic (0.8%)
subjects. The results for ROMA score obtained from the pre- and post-
menopausal populations are presented below:

Overall, 95% of the premenopausal healthy women had a ROMA score equal to
or below 2.36. 95% of the postmenopausal healthy women had a ROMA score
equal to or below 2.75. It is recommended that each laboratory establish its own
reference value for the population of interest.
Expected values in Non-Ovarian Malignancy Condition: To evaluate the
performance of ROMA in subjects with other benign and other malignant
conditions, the ROMA was evaluated in women with benign conditions (benign
gynecological disease, congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, pregnant,
and other benign disease) and in women with other malignant conditions (bladder
cancer, breast caner, endometrial cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, and lung cancer).
A total of 978 subjects were analyzed. The table below summarized the results
analyzed for premenopausal and postmenopausal samples.
