I. Device Description:
Mission CliniCheck Assayed Chemistry Control is a human serum-based product
containing constituents of purified biochemicals (tissue extracts of human and animal
origin), chemicals, therapeutic drugs, preservatives, and stabilizers. Two levels of control
per analyte are provided in a lyophilized form. Each level is packaged into a glass amber
bottle containing 5 mL of product. The product is packaged in single level boxes (12 x 5

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Values assigned to the T3, T4 and TSH assays are traceable to the reference
standards used by the commercial vendor as referenced in their Certificate of
Analysis to establish instrument response in their assays. Alpha
Hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, Apolipoprotein A-1, C3 Complement, C4
Complement, IgA, IgG and IgM are endogenously sourced from the base
matrix comprised of human serum.
Stability:
Shelf-Life and Open Vial Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were
described and found to be adequate.
Shelf-Life – The sponsor provided accelerated stability data to support data
demonstrating that the Mission CliniCheck Assayed Chemistry Controls can
be stored for 2 years. Real-Time stability study is on-going.
Open-vial – The sponsor provided data demonstrating that upon opening a
vial Mission CliniCheck Assayed Chemistry Controls, the material is stable
for 7 days at 2-8 °C and 20 days -20°C.
Value Assignment:
Instruments used for the value assignment included Hitachi 911, Roche Cobas
Mira, Olympus AU 600, Beckman CX7, Abbott AxSYM, and Siemens
Dimesion RxL. Sixteen replicates of each analyte were collected over a
period of 4 days; 4 replicates of each analyte were tested. The 16 data points
were compiled and the average used as the target concentration. The range
represents ±3 SD (95% CI) around the mean value. The mean and range are
provided in tabular form in the value assignment sheets.
