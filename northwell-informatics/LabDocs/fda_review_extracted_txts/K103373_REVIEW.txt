L. Test Principle:
The Beckman Coulter SYNCHRON Cholinesterase (CHEX) assay is a rate
measurement assay based upon enzyme kinetics; a spectrophotometer in the
SYNCHRON analyzers measures the change in the absorbance of a chromophore in
the reaction. Cholinesterase present in the sample being measured catalyses the
hydrolysis of butyrylthiocholine, present in the substrate reagents to butyrate and
thiocholine. Thiocholine reduces yellow hexacyanoferrate (III), which is present in the
chromogen reagent to colorless hexacyanoferrate (II). Hexacyanoferrate (III) absorbs
at 410 nm, while hexacyanoferrate (II) is colorless and does not absorb at 410 nm,
therefore the decrease in absorbance at 410 nm is directly proportional to the
cholinesterase activity in the sample. A molar extinction coefficient of 938.5 M-1cm-1

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run and total imprecision studies were designed from CLSI Guideline
EP5-A2, “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement
Methods; Approved Guideline – Second Edition.” The experimental design
utilizes duplicate sample analysis, twice daily, over the course of twenty
working days. Multi-level control materials as well as pooled human serum
samples were used to demonstrate acceptable imprecision within the
specifications selected for each sample type.
Results of the within run and total imprecision evaluation for representative
members of the SYNCHRON family of Clinical Chemistry analyzers, the
UniCel DxC systems, SYNCHRON LX20 PRO system, and SYNCHRON CX
PRO systems, are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linear and reportable range of the SYNCHRON Systems Cholinesterase
(CHEX) reagent is 1-15 kU/L.
The sponsor performed their linearity studies in accordance with CLSI guidelines
EP6-A. “Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A
Statistical Approach.”. The study protocol utilized serum samples at 7 levels of
cholinesterase ranging from approximately 0.6 to 17 kU/L tested (n=4) on
representative members of the SYNCHRON family of Clinical Chemistry
analyzers: the UniCel DxC systems, SYNCHRON LX20 PRO system, and
SYNCHRON CX PRO systems. The recovered cholinesterase values were
plotted against the expected values and an appropriate line fitted by standard
linear regression and all of the recovered values were within 6% of the expected
values. These studies demonstrate that the device is linear across its claimed
measuring range of 1-15 kU/L. Linear regression analysis was also performed
and the results are summarized below.

UniCel DxC 800 y = 0.9956x - 0.0447 R2 = 0.9994
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators are not required for this assay. The substrate reagent contains a
known concentration of hexacyanoferrate (III), and the assay measures the
rate of reduction of this substrate, then determines the molar rate of change
using and extinction coefficient of 938.5 at 410/480nm.
Customers will be able to use commercially available controls to verify the
performance of the CHEX reagent. Controls are not provided with the CHEX
kit. The package insert recommends that at least two levels of controls be
analyzed daily and with each new reagent cartridge and specific maintenance
and troubleshooting materials as specified in the appropriate analyzer system
manual. The insert also states that more frequent use of controls are left to the
discretion of the user based on good laboratory practices, laboratory
accreditation requirements, and applicable laws.
Onboard reagent stability claims for the SYNCHRON Systems Cholinesterase
(CHEX) reagent were validated by recovery experiments using three levels of
commercially available controls and a pooled sample. The performance
assessment involved assaying control material and pooled sample at regular
intervals throughout the testing period. For the SYNCHRON Systems CHEX

Reagent, the onboard stability claim is 30 days and the stability results

d. Detection limit:
The limit of the blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) were calculated as
recommended in the CLSI guideline EP17-A: “Protocols for Determination of
Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation: Approved Guideline.” The
SYNCHRON Systems Cholinesterase (CHEX) assay has a detection limits
claim of 1.0 KU/L.
The limits of detection of the SYNCHRON Systems CHEX assay was
established by analyzing samples that target the low end analytical range
claim on representative members of the SYNCHRON Clinical Chemistry
system of analyzers: the UniCel DxC systems, SYNCHRON LX20 PRO
system, and SYNCHRON CX PRO systems. 4 samples were used for this
study. Each sample was made into 5 dilutions and was run in replicates of 6;
this was performed using two lots of reagent, thus providing a total sample
population of N=240 per instrument. An analysis of variance between pools
and instruments was determined to be statistically insignificant, so the data
was pooled to obtain the average for each instrument. The results of this study
are shown below.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were designed from CLSI Guideline EP7-A: “Interference
Testing in Clinical Chemistry – Approved Guideline” and used to assess
common or known substances which could interfere with the SYNCHRON
System Cholinesterase (CHEX) method. Several concentrations of each
potential interfering substance were added to patient sample pools at three
concentrations of cholinesterase that spanned the claimed measuring range of
the device. Each sample was tested in four replicates on representative
members of the SYNCHRON family of Clinical Chemistry analyzers: the
UniCel DxC systems, SYNCHRON LX20 PRO system, and SYNCHRON
CX PRO systems. The difference in recovery between samples with and
without the potential interfering substance was calculated to determine if they
interfered. The sponsor defined no significant interference (NSI) as a

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were designed using CLSI Procedure EP9-A2:
“Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patients Samples”. 100
patient serum samples were tested in singlicate on the comparator device and
on the UniCel DxC 600, the UniDxC 800, LX20, CX5 Pro, and the CX9 pro
and analyzed using Deming regression. Most of the samples tested were
natural patient samples with a small number of spiked or diluted samples
included to fully cover the measuring range. The results are summarized
below.

b. Matrix comparison:
A method comparison study was performed to evaluate the effect of
anticoagulants in primary blood collection tubes on cholinesterase recovery on
the SYNCHRON System Cholinesterase (CHEX) reagent on the
SYNCHRON Clinical Chemistry analyzers. For each anticoagulant, plasma
and serum samples from healthy volunteers were drawn and tested, and the
plasma recoveries were compared to the corresponding serum recoveries for
each donor. Deming regression analysis, with singlicate sample results, was
used to evaluate the results. The testing compared 60 sets of paired samples
with cholinesterase concentrations ranging from approximately 2 kU/L to 14
