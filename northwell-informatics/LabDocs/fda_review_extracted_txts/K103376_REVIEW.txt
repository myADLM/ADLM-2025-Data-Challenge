L. Test Principle:
Creatininase hydrolyzes creatinine in the sample to creatine. Creatine is hydrolyzed
by creatinase to sarcosine and urea. Sarcosine is then oxidized by sarcosine oxidase to
produce hydrogen peroxide (H O ). H O reacts with 4-amino-antipyrine (4-AAP)
2 2 2 2
and EHSPT (N-Ethyl-N-2(-Hydroxy-3-Sulfopropyl)-m-Toluidine) under the catalytic
action of peroxidase to form a colored quinoneimine. The absorbance of the
quinoneimine at 546 nm is proportional to the concentration of creatinine in the
sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed by assaying three serum pools at varying
concentrations over 20 operating days, on one Selectra Junior analyzer and
with one lot of reagent. Assay runs were performed twice per day and each
sample was tested in duplicate. Calibration was performed for each run. The
results are summarized below.
Mean Within-run Total
Samples n
(mg/dL) SD CV(%) SD CV(%)
Serum pool 1 80 0.59 0.01 1.3% 0.02 3.2%
Serum pool 2 80 1.62 0.01 0.8% 0.03 1.6%
Serum pool 3 80 6.93 0.09 1.4% 0.19 2.8%

	Serum pool 3		80			6.93			0.09			1.4%			0.19			2.8%		

--- Page 6 ---
Another precision study was performed by assaying three serum pools and
one control at varying concentrations over 10 operating days, on two Selectra
Junior analyzers and with two lots of reagents. Assay runs were performed
once per day and calibrated according to the device labeling. Each sample was
tested in duplicate. The results are summarized below.
Mean Within-run Total
Samples n
(mg/dL) SD CV(%) SD CV(%)
Serum pool 1 40 0.58 0.01 2.3% 0.02 2.9 %
Serum pool 2 40 1.57 0.02 1.5 % 0.03 2.0 %
Serum pool 3 40 6.70 0.05 0.7 % 0.12 1.7 %
Control 40 3.74 0.02 0.7 % 0.06 1.6%
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study across the claimed assay range was performed by preparing
samples from patient serum pools at a low creatinine concentration (0.28
mg/dL) and a high concentration (22.32 mg/dL). The low pool contained
serum diluted with saline. The low and high pools were mixed in different
proportions to create 9 dilutions. Eleven samples in all were assayed in
triplicate
Data was analyzed using 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order least square regressions
according to CLSI Protocol EP6-A. Based on the analysis the sponsor
determined that first order regression was the best fit. The analysis of the first
order regression yielded the following equation:
1st order y= 2.2x -1.84
Additionally, the expected values were plotted against the observed values
and a linear regression line was fitted with the following regression equation:
y = 0.9939x + 0.14, r2 = 0.9999
Based on these results, the sponsor claims that the assay is linear from 0.28-
22.30 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrator material is purchased from a commercially available source.
The creatinine in ELICAL 2 is traceable to ID-MS (Isotope dilution-Mass
Spectrometry). Elical 2 calibrator is value assigned from an internal master
lot of calibrator using three bottles of reconstituted Elical 2 calibrator
evaluated in two runs on two Vital Scientific Flexor Junior Analyzers. The
target value is the mean of the observed range of values and is listed on value
sheet accompanying each lot of Elical 2. The sponsor claims the following
6

[Table 1 on page 6]
							Mean			Within-run						Total				
	Samples			n																
							(mg/dL)			SD			CV(%)			SD			CV(%)	
																				
	Serum pool 1		40			0.58			0.01			2.3%			0.02			2.9 %		
	Serum pool 2		40			1.57			0.02			1.5 %			0.03			2.0 %		
	Serum pool 3		40			6.70			0.05			0.7 %			0.12			1.7 %		
	Control		40			3.74			0.02			0.7 %			0.06			1.6%		

--- Page 7 ---
stability for Elical 2 after reconstitution: up to 8 hours when stored at 15-25°
C, 2 days when stored at 2-8° C, and 4 weeks when stored at -25° to -15° C
(freeze only one). The lyophilized material (unopened) is stable until the
expiration date printed on the vial, 11 months when stored at 2-8° C.
Elitrol I and II control solutions are value assigned using two Vital Scientific
Flexor Junior Analyzers. Each sample is tested in triplicate over several days.
The target value of Level I and II are the median of the observed values range.
After validation of the target value, a confidence range (high and low values)
is calculated. The confidence range and target values are listed on the value
sheet accompanying each lot of Elitrol I and II. The sponsor claims the
following stability after reconstitution: up to 12 hrs between 15-25° C,
5 days between 2-8° C, 4 weeks between -25° to -15° C (when frozen once).
The lyophilized material (unopened) is stable until the expiration date printed
on the vial, 30 months when stored at 2-8° C.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor states that the Limits of Blank (LoB), Detection (LoD) and
Quantitation (LoQ) studies were conducted following CLSI EP17-A. The LoB
study was performed by assaying 60 replicates of a blank sample in one assay
run. The LoD was determined by assaying 15 replicates of four diluted
patient pools with very low creatinine concentrations in one assay run. The
LoQ was determined by assaying 15 replicates of four diluted patient pools
with low creatinine concentrations (approximately 0.28 mg/dL) in one assay
run. Each study was performed using one Selectra Junior analyzer and one lot
of creatinine reagent.
The sponsor states that the limit of blank is 0.001 mg/dL and the limit of
detection 0.0065 mg/dL, however the analyzer does not report creatinine
values below the claimed limit of quantitation. The limit of quantitation based
on the study described above is stated to be 0.28 mg/dL. Imprecision of the
samples evaluated in the LoQ study ranged from 1.4-4.8% (CV%).
e. Analytical specificity:
Testing for interfering substances was based on CLSI EP-7A. Testing was
performed on a minimum of five concentrations for each interfering
substance. Two different clinically relevant concentrations of creatinine (1.58
and 6.67 mg/dL) were used for evaluation. Samples with increasing amounts
of potential interferents were tested in triplicate and compared to the same
sample without the interferent.
The sponsor defined non-significant interference as the highest level tested
that does not cause >10% change between the tested samples and the control
sample.
