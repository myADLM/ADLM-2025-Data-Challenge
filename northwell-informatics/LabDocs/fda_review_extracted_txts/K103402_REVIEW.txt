c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and value assignment
DHEA-S is of synthetic origin and purchased from a commercially available
source. The Elecsys DHEA-S CalCheck 5 is traceable to internal master
calibrators where DHEA-S has been added gravimetrically into human serum
matrix.
Value assignment testing is conducted and must pass pre-defined acceptance
criteria. Specifically, each of the five CalCheck levels is value assigned using
a minimum of three Elecsys 2010/cobas e411 analyzers and MODULAR
ANALYTICS E170/cobas e 601 analyzers. Each sample is tested in duplicate
for total of at least 6 measurements (duplicate runs on at least 3 analyzers).
The target value for each CalCheck is the median value obtained over at least
6 determinations of the respective CalCheck. The assigned range is calculated
as ±24% of the assigned value for levels 3-5 and ±30% of the assigned value for
level 2. The % CV is 4% for levels 3-5 and 10% for level 2. The label states that
each laboratory should establish appropriate acceptance criteria when using this
product for its intended use.
To ensure the values assigned using the master platform are transferrable and
valid for the other instrument platforms, each Elecsys DHES-A CalCheck 5 level
is assayed once a day on 8 Elecsys 2010 / cobas e 411 and 8 MODULAR
ANALYTICS E170/cobas e 601/cobas e 602 analyzers. The median value for
the 8 analyses must be within 10% of the master platform assigned value (10%
for between analyzer platform tolerances). After this acceptance criterion is met,
the assigned values from the master platform are deemed valid for the Elecsys
2010 / cobas e 411 and MODULAR ANALYTICS E170/cobas e 601/cobas e
602 immunoassay analyzers.
Stability
Real time and accelerated stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were
described and found to be adequate. CalCheck 5 is stable for 18 months when
stored unopened at 2 – 8° C. The expiration date listed on each CalCheck bottle
label reflects this stability time of 18 months. The reconstituted vials are stable up
to four hours at 20-25°C, as supported by the data and stated in the label.
