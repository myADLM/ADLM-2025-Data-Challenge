H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Refer to indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Abbott Clinical Chemistry Multiconstituent Calibrator (MCC) is an in vitro
diagnostic product intended for use as a calibration serum in clinical chemistry
assays. The MCC contains 13 analytes in a liquid human serum based matrix.
The concentrations and activities are suitable for calibration of the Abbott
ARCHITECT c8000 System. Constituent concentrations are available at two
levels.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For in vitro diagnostic use. For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The Abbott Clinical Chemistry Multiconstituent Calibrator is intended for use
with the Abbott ARCHITECT c8000 System.
I. Device Description:
The Abbott Clinical Chemistry Multiconstituent Calibrator is prepared from a human-
based matrix containing the following analytes: albumin, total protein (made from
human sourced albumin material), calcium, creatinine, glucose, iron, lactic acid,
magnesium, phosphorus, urea nitrogen, uric acid, cholesterol, and triglyceride. The
product consists of two levels. Sodium azide is present as a preservative.
The human serum albumin used in the calibrators has been tested and found to be
nonreactive for HBsAg, anti-HIV-1/HIV-2, anti-HCV, and syphilis.

Expected Values and Value Ranges
Expected values for the Abbott Clinical Chemistry Multiconstituent Calibrator
are determined by analyses of 20 replicates at each calibrator level using one
Abbott Architect c8000 System. Pre-determined acceptance criteria for
analyte recovery must be met for each calibrator lot. Calibrator assigned
values are lot dependent and are listed in the lot-specific Multiconstituent
Calibrator value sheet.
Stability
Stability testing data support the manufacturer claims that the Abbott Clinical
Chemistry Multiconstituent Calibrator is stable until the expiration date
printed on the vial when stored unopened at 2-8°C. Accelerated stability
testing supports the target shelf life claim of 20 months. The manufacturer
has an on-going real-time stability study design to support the recommended
storage conditions for the life of the product. Real time stability studies were
performed to evaluate the open vial stability of the calibrator. Data supports
an open vial stability claim of seven days at 2-8°C or 24 hours at 30°C. The
opened vials (on-board) are stable for five days at 2-8°C.
