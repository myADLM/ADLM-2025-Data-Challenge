T4 blood spot immunoassay should be used as an aid to other medically
established procedures and results interpreted in conjunction with other clinical
data available to the clinician. Samples giving T4 values below the cut-off limit
should be repeated and confirmed. hTSH determination in combination with T4,
FT4 or T3 can be used in confirming the presence or absence of congenital
hypothyroidism.
Heterophilic antibodies in the sample may interfere with the assay. Hematocrit
values in the blood samples may affect the measured thyroxine concentration.
Screening for congenital hypothyroidism by measurement of T4 concentrations
requires a decision of the screening policy, definition of tiers, cut-off values and
follow-up. The laboratory needs to establish its own cut-off values, which can be
based on a percentile, or on the basis of a normal range. The cut-off values should
be monitored and reassessed when necessary. Interpretation of results and the
recommended follow-up algorithm for congenital hypothyroidism screening is
described by American Academy of Pediatrics/American Thyroid Association
American Academy of Pediatrics (Pediatrics. 2006 117:2290-2303).

L. Test Principle:
The GSP Neonatal T4 assay is a solid phase time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay based
on the competitive reaction between europium-labeled T4 and sample T4 for a limited
amount of binding sites on T4 specific monoclonal antibodies (derived from mice).
The use of 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) and salicylate in the T4 Assay
Buffer facilitates the release of T4 from the binding proteins. Thus the assay measures
the total amount of T4 in the test specimen. A second antibody, directed against
mouse IgG, is coated to the solid phase, and binds the IgG thyroxine complex, giving
convenient separation of the antibody bound and free antigen.

DELFIA Inducer dissociates europium ions from the labeled antibody into solution
where they form highly fluorescent chelates with components of DELFIA Inducer.
The fluorescence in each well is then measured. The fluorescence of each sample is
inversely proportional to the concentration of T4 in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Three GSP Neonatal Thyroxine (T4) kit controls (C1, C2, C3) and five
precision samples (PS1 - PS5) were used for determining the precision. The
three controls (C1, C2, C3) and two precision samples (PS1 and PS2) were
prepared from a suspension of washed red blood cells and filtered serum.
These samples were spiked with thyroxine. Three precision samples (PS3 –
PS5) were prepared from a whole blood specimen drawn from one apparently
healthy adult and spiked with thyroxine. The hematocrit of the samples was
adjusted to correspond to the hematocrit of neonates (approximately 50-55%).
Dried blood spot samples for testing were prepared and analyzed in duplicate
with one GSP Neonatal Thyroxine (T4) kit lot and one GSP Instrument over
ten days.
The within-run and between-run variations were calculated as instructed in the
CLSI EP5-A2 for single-run per day experiments. The total variation is the
sum of the within and between-run variations.

series of 12 samples, ranging from 0 to 36 μg/dL thyroxine, was prepared
from the low and high concentration samples. Dried blood spot samples for
testing were prepared and dried overnight. The thyroxine concentrations of the
dilution series of dried blood spot samples were measured with two GSP
Neonatal Thyroxine (T4) kit lots and two GSP Instruments. The samples were

analyzed in three replicates.
A polynomial evaluation of linearity was used for the data analysis. The
assumption of constant variance across all levels is not fulfilled in the GSP
Neonatal Thyroxine (T4) kit. Rather, the variance is proportional across
different measurement levels. Therefore, weighted regression models were
used. A linear regression line and second and third order polynomials were
fitted to the data and the results of regression analyses were compared. The
significance of the second and third order polynomials were evaluated by
performing a t-test. The second order regression had a statistically significant
nonlinear term (β2) at a 95% significance level (p-value 0.08). while the third
order regression was not statistically significant. For Thyroxine (T4)
concentrations > 2 μg/dL serum, the maximum observed difference between
the linear regression models was 5.4 %. For concentrations ≤ 2 μg/dL serum,
the observed absolute difference between the models was 0.13 μg/dL.
The linearity study data supports a claimed measuring range of 1.6 to 30
μg/dL serum.
In the labeling the sponsor recommends that samples that result in values
below 1.6 μg/dL serum are to be reported as "< 1.6 μg/dL". Likewise, samples
that result in values above 30 μg/dL serum are recommended to be reported as
"> 30 μg/dL serum".
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators and Controls
The Neonatal Thyroxine (T4) kit calibrators and controls are dried blood spots
(DBS) on filter paper in sheet format prepared from T4 reference material and
washed red blood cells diluted in filtered human serum (with a final
hematocrit value of 50-55%). The six calibrators contain concentrations of
added T4 at approximately 0, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 30 μg/dL serum. The three
controls contain approximate T4 concentrations of 3, 7 and 12 μg/dL serum.
The calibrators and controls are stored at 2 to 8 oC.
Certified reference material for L-Thyroxine (IRMM-468) is used to prepare
primary calibrators for GSP Neonatal Thyroxine (T4) kit. The reference
material is diluted in 80 mM NaOH solution and the concentration of the
stock solution is gravimetrically determined. The stock solution is added to
T4-free human serum and washed red blood cells. The secondary calibrators,
which are prepared gravimetrically from the primary calibrator, are dried
blood spots on Whatman paper prepared from the L-Thyroxine solution, T4-
free human serum and washed red blood cells.

--- Page 6 ---
The level calibrator concentrations are assigned against secondary calibrators
using the GSP instrument. A two-stage calibration procedure is used for kit
calibrators and controls. The initial concentration values for the kit calibrators
and controls are assigned against the secondary calibrators using another
commercially available instrument. The final, kit lot concentrations for the kit
calibrators and controls are assigned in the final release test using the level
calibrators and GSP instrument.
Stability:
The performance of three different lots of GSP Neonatal Thyroxine T4 kit
were tested in real time stability studies at the following time points (0, 1, 2, 3,
6, 9, 12, 13, 18 and 19 months). The kit components were stored at 2 to 8oC
during the real time studies. Based upon the results of the studies, the sponsor
claims a shelf life of 18 months.
A shipping stability study was performed using two different lots of GSP
Neonatal Thyroxine T4 kit. The kit components were sequentially exposed to
the following shipping conditions (18 hours at -20oC, 6 hours at 35oC, 6 days
at room temperature and 6 hours at -20oC) and then the performance was
evaluated at the following time points (0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 13, 18 and 19
months). Based upon the results of the shipping condition studies, the sponsor
claims a shelf life of 18 months.
In-use and on-board stability studies were performed using a single lot of GSP
Neonatal Thyroxine T4 kit. Different components of the kit have different
stabilities as described below. Once opened, the calibrators, controls and
plates can be stored for 14 days at 2 to 8oC. The on-board stability of tracer,
antibody and assay buffer is 14 days at 10oC. The anti-mouse IgG
microtitration strips with punched calibrators and controls in wells can be
stored on-board for 12 hours at 2 to 8oC.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of
Quantitation (LoQ) was determined in accordance with the CLSI Guideline
EP 17-A.
Limit of Blank: Three blank pools were prepared using washed red blood cell
and filtered serum. The hematocrit of the specimens was adjusted to
correspond to the hematocrit of neonates (approximately 50-55%). Blank
dried blood spot samples for testing were prepared and dried overnight.
Repeated measurements (n = 216, n = 72 / specimen, n = 24 / specimen / kit
lot) were carried out using the samples. 18 separate runs were performed
using three kit lots and three GSP instruments over six days. The Limit of
Blank, which was estimated non-parametrically as the 95th percentile of the
measurements, was determined to be 0.457 μg/dL.
6

--- Page 7 ---
Limit of Detection and Limit of Quantitation: A blood suspension made of
washed red blood cells and filtered human serum was spiked with thyroxine to
obtain four different low concentrations (approximately 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2
μg/dL). The hematocrit of the specimens was adjusted to correspond to the
hematocrit of neonates (approximately 50-55%). Dried blood spot samples for
testing were prepared and dried overnight. Repeated measurements (n = 216 /
specimen) were carried out using the four dried blood spot specimens. The
runs were performed using three kit lots and three GSP instruments over 27
days. The Limit of Detection (LoD) was calculated using the formula LoD =
LoB + c SD and determined to be 0.99 μg/dL.
β s
In absence of a recognized reference method, a functional sensitivity study
was used to define Limit of Quantitation (LoQ). LoQ is the lowest
concentration of thyroxine that can be measured with acceptable total
variation of the assay (CV% < 20%). Limit of Quantitation was calculated
using the formula LoQ = SD/CV and determined to be 1.61 μg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The effect of potential interfering substances on the measurement of thyroxine
concentrations in dried blood spot samples with the GSP Neonatal Thyroxine
(T4) kit was evaluated in accordance with the CLSI EP7-A2. Potential
interference was measured using the paired-difference method. According to
this method the tested substance is added to the sample. The effect of the
substance on the results is compared with the results of the control sample
with no additions other than the solvent used to dissolve the substance. If a
high concentration of the added substance does not demonstrate interference,
no further testing is needed. If the added substance is shown to cause
interference, a dilution series of the tested substance is analyzed and the effect
of the concentration of the interfering factor is assayed (dose-response
method). Based upon the study results, unconjugated bilirubin (up to 20
mg/dL in serum), conjugated bilirubin (up to 20 mg/dL in serum), hemoglobin
(up to 15 g/L) and intralipids (up to 15 mg/mL) did not interfere with the
assay.
Cross-reactivity was determined by the method of Guy Abraham known as
50% displacement methodwhich is typical used for competitive assays. A
calibrator curve was calculated for the dilution series of each substance and
the thyroxine concentration at the 50% displacement level was compared to
the concentrations of the tested substance at the 50% displacement level of
their calibrator curves. The results are presented in the following table:

necessary.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The T4 patient values by percentile from the testing completed with the GSP
Neonatal Thyroxine (T4) kit at the two U.S. state laboratories described above
(3c) are presented in the table below:
Study n T4 μg/dL serum Lower Percentiles

2 1,955 14.5 14.3 10.6 9.6 8.1 6.6
Since cut-off values of T4 in dry blood spots may vary between different tests and
different populations, the sponsor recommends in the labeling that each laboratory
establishes its own reference range and cut-off limit from a representative sample
population.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
