2. Indication(s) for use:
Device Name: FORA PNC100 Digital Pregnancy Test
The FORA PNC100 Digital Pregnancy Test is an in vitro
diagnostic test device for the qualitative determination of human
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine. It is intended for use as an
aid in the early detection of pregnancy by lay users. Additional
clinical examination should be performed to confirm the
pregnancy. The device uses visually read lateral flow technology
for the detection of hCG and provides a digitally read result. The
device is intended for home use.
The TD-5301 Pregnancy Test (Strip) is an in vitro diagnostic test
device for the qualitative determination of human chorionic
gonadotropin (hCG) in urine. It is intended for use as an aid in the
early detection of pregnancy by lay users. Additional clinical
examination should be performed to confirm the pregnancy.
This device uses visually read lateral flow technology for the
detection of hCG. The device is intended for home use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The assays are for OTC use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
No additional instruments are needed.
The digital reader can only be used with the test strips that come with the
kit and should be discarded with the last test strip, as stated in the Owner’s
Booklet. No test strip designed for use with FORA PNC 100 Digital
Pregnancy Test meter is sold separately. One test meter (digital reader) is
sold with each FOR A PNC100 test strip box kit.
I. Device Description:
The TD-5301 Pregnancy Test consists of a test strip coated with reagents and
enclosed in a plastic cassette.
The FORA PNC100 Digital Pregnancy Test consists of a meter and a plastic
test stick containing a test strip. The meter has a slot where the test stick is
attached to activate the procedure. This device uses the same test strip, as TD-
5301 Pregnancy Test. The meter is to be discarded after use with the test
strips packaged in the same box. It is not for use with additional test strips.
Three to five strips are included per box.

L. Test Principle:
The assay is based on a two-site sandwich immunoassay technology. Each
test device contains monoclonal anti-β hCG antibody colloidal gold conjugate
pre-dried on a pad. Monoclonal anti-α hCG antibodies (on the test region) and
goat anti mouse IgG (on the control region) are coated and immobilized on a
membrane.
As the urine specimen contacts the membrane, it dissolves the conjugate and
migrates by capillary action along the membrane to the test region. In specimens
containing hCG, the hCG antigen will attach to the anti-βhCG monoclonal
antibodies in the colloidal solution. As the conjugate moves forward on the
membrane, anti-α hCG monoclonal antibody affixed on the test region (“T”) will
bind the hCG-gold conjugate complex, forming a red line. Absence of this line at
the test region is interpreted as a negative result. In addition, all samples will
cause a red colored line to appear in the control region (“C”). This line is formed
by the binding of the polyclonal antibodies goat anti-mouse IgG) affixed onto the
control region to the sample-colloidal gold conjugate. As a procedural control, a
red line should always appear in the control region.
The FORA PNC100 Digital Pregnancy Test is supplied with a meter to interpret
the result by determining the reflected color lightness produced by the test and
control lines. This meter contains electronic and optical components along with a
microprocessor and specific algorithms powered by a CR2032 lithium battery
to digitally display test results. The result appears on the display window. The
procedural control line is visually-read.

Traceability:
The FORA PNC100 Digital Pregnancy Test and TD-5301 Pregnancy
Test are calibrated against commercially available purified hCG α-β
dimer with activity traceable to the WHO 3rd International Standard.
Stability:
Stability testing is performed for digital readers and strip lots to
support the shelf life of 24 months under the temperature conditions
specified for the finished products: (2ºC - 30ºC, or 35.6ºF - 86ºF), and
50% to 85% relative humidity. Test samples include spiked urine at
hCG concentrations of 0, 5, and 25 mIU/mL. Acceptance criteria are
positive results for hCG concentrations of 0 and 5 mIU/mL and
negative results for concentrations of 25 mIU/mL. Testing is in
accordance with EN 13640, 2002.) Testing up to 3 months was
included in the 510(k). Expiration testing for lots up to 25 months is
ongoing.
e. Analytical specificity:
FSH, TSH and LH were tested for cross reactivity. Other analytes
including endogenous compounds and conditions, various
prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs and contraceptive ingredients
were tested for interference. In addition, specific gravity, and pH of
urine, as well as hook effect of high dose hCG and hCG isoforms were
evaluated for interference. Four different concentrations of hCG were
spiked into urine samples. Concentrations of the samples tested
included: 5 (negative sample) and 25 (positive sample) mIU/mL hCG.
Replicates were run for each sample on multiple lots and digital
readers. No interference was observed. Compounds tested are shown
below.

In addition, no interference was observed for specific gravity ranging from
1.00 to 1.035.
Five isoforms of hCG, including beta core fragment were tested for
negative interference with samples containing high concentrations of hCG
(α/β dimer). Isoform levels ranging from 60,000 to 500,000 pmol/L were
tested. All test results were positive.
The assays were tested for hook effect by spiking pooled urine specimens
with hCG concentrations ranging from 125,000 to 1,000,000 mIU/mL. No
hook effect was observed at these concentrations.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed comparing results of a
predicate device to the FORA PNC100 Digital Pregnancy Test, and the
TD 5301 Pregnancy Test developed by TaiDoc Technology Corporation.
Urine samples were obtained from 209 women presenting at a clinic and
tested for pregnancy. Samples were randomly collected at various times
throughout the day. Ages of subjects ranged from 20 to 49 years. Women
taking medications containing hCG were excluded from this study. In this
study the tests were run by healthcare professionals at three point of care
sites. Samples were tested using the new devices and predicate device at

Lay user study:
Another comparison study was performed to evaluate the use of FORA
PNC100 Digital Pregnancy Test and TD-5301 by lay users following the
instructions in the owner’s booklet. Two hundred female subjects
(suspecting pregnancy) from three clinical sites were included in the
study. The FOR A PNC100 and TD5301 were each evaluated by one
hundred females. Both stream and dip methods were tested for each
device (50 subjects each). Each subject tested (i) her own urine sample
and (ii) one masked spiked sample with concentrations near (above and
below) the cutoff concentration. All participants were instructed to read
the proposed package insert (in English) and operate the device. Each
subject was also given a questionnaire to rate the how well they
understood the instructions. Ages ranged from 20 to > 41 years. A range
of education levels (including non-high school graduates) were included.
Subjects were women suspecting pregnancy and early in pregnancy. All
were first-time users of a digital pregnancy test.
