The LIAISON® XL Analyzer is an automated discrete continuous loading chemiluminescent
immunoassay (CLIA) analyzer for in vitro diagnostic analysis of CLIAs on human serum or
plasma. The system menu includes infectious disease, bone and mineral, and endocrinology
CLIAs. It is to be used only with FDA cleared chemiluminescence immunoassays that are
marketed by DiaSorin for the LIAISON XL Analyzer.
The LIAISON® Control Anti-HAV (negative and positive) is intended for use as assayed
quality control samples to monitor the performance of the LIAISON® Anti-HAV assay.
The performance characteristics of LIAISON® controls have not been established for any
other assays or instrument platforms different from LIAISON® and LIAISON® XL.

I. Device Description:
The method for qualitative determination of anti-HAV is a competitive sandwich
chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) based on neutralization. The assay uses magnetic
particles (solid phase) coated with IgG antibodies to HAV (mouse monoclonal), and a mouse
monoclonal anti- HAV antibody conjugate linked to an isoluminol derivative (isoluminol-
antibody conjugate).
The first incubation step consists of adding the HAV antigen to calibrators, samples or
controls, during which anti-HAV present in calibrators, samples or controls binds to a fixed
and limited amount of HAV, thus forming an HAV-anti-HAV immune complex. After this
step the second incubation follows and it involves addition of magnetic microparticles and
conjugate into the reaction module, during which the antibody conjugate and the solid-phase
antibody compete with anti-HAV present in the specimen for HAV, that allows the conjugate
to bind to the solid phase and thus formation of a sandwich. If all HAV added is sequestered
2

--- Page 3 ---
in an HAV-anti-HAV immune complex during the first incubation, no sandwich is formed
during the second incubation. After the second incubation, the unbound material is removed
with a wash cycle.
Subsequently, the starter reagents are added and a flash chemiluminescence reaction is thus
induced. The light signal, and hence the amount of isoluminol-antibody conjugate, is
measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) and is inversely indicative of
anti-HAV present in calibrators, samples or controls.
The LIAISON XL Analyzer is an automated discrete continuous loading chemiluminescent
immunoassay analyzer for in vitro diagnostic use. The analyzer consists of loading areas (for
samples, reagents, cuvettes, and disposable tips), an incubator, wash station, photomultiplier
reader, and a bar code reader for reagents and samples. The analyzer uses proprietary
reagents in which chemiluminescence of an analyte is measured in a sample by the reaction
of a magnetic particle solid phase coated with antigen or antibody and a chemiluminescent
tracer. The LIAISON® XL Analyzer is intended for use in professional clinical laboratories
only.
