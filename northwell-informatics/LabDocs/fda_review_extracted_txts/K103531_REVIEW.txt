I. Device Description:
Using photometry, the Biolis 24i instrument measures the glucose concentration in
serum by monitoring the change in absorbance at 340 nm. Additionally, the Biolis 24i
with optional Ion-Selective Elective module cleared under (k040958) measures the
concentration of the electrolytes, sodium, potassium and chloride in serum, using
indirect potentiometry. The Biolis 24i Clinical Chemistry Analyzer will also be
marketed under the trade names MGC 240 and Prestige 24i.
Reagent: Carolina Liquid Chemistries Glucose Reagent (k971467) packaged for use
on the BioLis 24i analyzer contains three 40 mL bottles of GLUC R1 Reagent.
GLUC R1 Reagent contains 1.1 mmol/L ATP, 2.7 mmol/L NAD, 2 mmol/L
magnesium, >2000 IU/L hexokinase (yeast), >4000 IU/L, G-6-PD (leuconostoc
mesenteroides), preservatives and stabilizers.
Calibration is performed using Pointe Chemistry Calibrator (k070207)

L. Test Principle:
The assay utilizes the enzymatic procedure using the hexokinase and glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase for the determination of glucose. The BioLis 24i Clinical
System monitors this reaction bichromatically at 340 nm/405 nm. The increase in
absorbance is directly proportional to the concentration of glucose in the specimen.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Five individual serum specimens, two spiked with glucose, were assayed 15
times each on two BioLis 24i Clinical Systems with two different lots of
Carolina Liquid Chemistries Glucose Reagent. Estimates of repeatability are
calculated for each sample as the pooled standard deviation.
