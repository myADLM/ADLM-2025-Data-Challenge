Second Edition.
L. Test Principle:
The GenStrip test strip is based on electrochemical methodologies. The system
quantitatively measures blood glucose levels using an amperometric method. The
system employs glucose oxidase and flavin adenine dinucleotide enzyme chemistry.
The electrons generated during this reaction are transferred from the blood to the
electrodes. The magnitude of the resultant current is proportional to the concentration
of glucose in the specimen and the signal is converted into a readout displayed on the
meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The sponsor states that the following performance evaluation provided for the
GenStrip test strips was obtained using the 3 claimed meters (LifeScan OneTouch
Ultra, OneTouch Ultra 2, and OneTouch UltraMini) purchased before July 2010. The
sponsor states that three GenStrip test strip calibration codes (10, 13, and 4) were
used in each of the performance evaluations.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor evaluated between-day precision using GenStrip test strips with
10 of each of the meters, the OneTouch Ultra, OneTouch Ultra 2, and
OneTouch UltraMini meters. Three levels of control solutions were tested in
replicates of 10 over ten consecutive days on using for a total of 100 tests per
glucose level per meter type. Results are summarized below.
Between-day precision for glucose:
Control Meter Average CV
Solution (mg/dL) (%)
Level 1 Ultra 40.3 4.4%
Ultra2 40.1 4.2%
UltraMini 40.8 4.2%
Level 2 Ultra 117.6 2.5%
Ultra2 118.3 2.4%
UltraMini 118.0 2.5%
Level 3 Ultra 454.1 2.5%
Ultra2 453.3 2.4%
UltraMini 453.7 2.4%

The sponsor performed within-run precision studies using venous whole blood
adjusted to 6 different glucose concentrations (approximately 42, 84, 134,
233, 384, 494 mg/dL). Each glucose level was analyzed in replicates of 10
with GenStrip test strips and ten (10) each of the OneTouch Ultra, Ultra 2, and
UltraMini meters for a total of 100 tests per each glucose level for each meter
type. Results are summarized below:

492 2.2 493 2.2 494 2.1
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using three test strip lots and 9 mixed pools of venous
blood samples with glucose concentrations of 20, 47-48, 105, 202, 304-311,
398-405, 495-510, 540-545, 597-600 mg/dL (as measured by YSI). Each
level was measured in replicates of 10 with each of 3 test strip lots and each
meter type (Ultra mini, Ultra, and Ultra2) the results from the GenStrip and
each of the meters were compared with those obtained from YSI-2300.
Results from regression analysis:
Results from the GenStrip test strips and the Ultra meter:
Test strip lot #1: y = 0.98x + 2.9; R2 = 0.99
Test strip lot #2: y = 0.98x + 2.9; R2 = 0.99
Test strip lot #3: y = 0.99x + 2.6; R2 = 0.99
Results from the GenStrip test strips and the Ultra2 meter:
Test strip lot #1: y = 0.99x + 1.6; R2 = 0.99
Test strip lot #2: y = 0.98x + 2.4; R2 = 0.99
Test strip lot #3: y = 0.99x + 0.9; R2 = 0.99
Results from the GenStrip test strips and the UltraMini meter:
Test strip lot #1: y = 0.99x - 3.1; R2 = 0.99
Test strip lot #2: y = 0.98x - 2.8; R2 = 0.99

The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement
range of 20-600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The capillary glucose values obtained with the GenStrips were compared to
the YSI method. See the method comparison in 2.a. below.
There are two commercially available control solutions available for use with
GenStrip test strips: LifeScan Ultra control solution (targeted at 120 mg/dL
glucose) and the Streck Sugar-Chex II Elevated (targeted at 480 mg/dL
glucose). The GenStrip test strip insert instructs the user to use these control
solutions and the expected control ranges are printed on the GenStrip test strip
vial labels.
Three of each meter type (Ultra, Ultra2, and UltraMini) were used to evaluate
whether GenStrip test strips responded to control solution appropriately. The
control solution range assignment indicated on GenStrip test strips bottle
labels is based on mean ± 2.5 times the standard deviation.
Testing protocols and acceptance criteria for the GenStrip test strips shelf-life
and open vial stabiltiy were provided. The manufacturer claims shelf life
stability of 18 months and an open-vial stability of 3 months at the
recommended storage temperatures of 40°F-86°F.
d. Detection limit:
See linearity study in Section M1b above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed using the GenStrip test strips and the
three meter types (OneTouch Ultra, Ultra2 and UltraMini) by spiking venous
blood with two levels of glucose concentrations (30, 100 and 400 mg/dL) and
the potential interferents. Each test sample was tested in replicates of 5 and
the % difference between the interferent containing sample and the control
sample calculated. The sponsor defines no significant interference as ≤+/-10
mg/dL for glucose values ≤75 mg/dL and ≤+/-10% for glucose values >75
mg/dL difference relative to the control sample. Results are presented in the
table below:

Bilirubin 15 Tolbutamide 25
Cholesterol 758 Tolazamide 25
Gentistic acid 7.5 Triglycerides 3000
Ibuprofen 40 Uric Acid 5
The sponsor has the following limitations in the GenStrip test strip insert:
ØInterferences: Abnormally high concentrations of L-dopa, ascorbic acid,
acetaminophen, uric acid and gentistic acid may cause falsely high results.
For nominal glucose levels of 30 mg/dL interferences occur for Ldopa
at concentrations of >3.0 mg/dL in all three meters claimed; for
acetaminophen at concentrations >7.5 mg/dL in all three meters claimed; for
uric acid at concentrations >5.0 mg/dL in all three meters claimed; and
for gentisic acid at concentrations >7.5 mg/dL in all three meters claimed.
Levels seen in normal blood or with normal therapeutic concentrations do not
significantly affect results.
ØLipemic samples: Cholesterol levels up to 758 mg/dL and triglycerides up to
3000 mg/dL do not affect results. Grossly lipemic samples have not been
evaluated. Do not test such samples with these test strips.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
System Accuracy:
To assess system accuracy in the hands of lay-user participants, results from
the GenStrip test strip and the OneTouch Ultra, Ultra2 and UltraMini meters
were compared to a reference method, YSI 2300D Glucose Analyzer.
Results were analyzed by comparing blood glucose results from the GenStrip
test strip obtained by lay-users with capillary samples from fingerstick,
forearm and palm to the YSI results. The samples used in the study ranged
from 59-521 mg/dL as measured by YSI. The results relative to YSI are
summarized in the tables below:
