I. Device Description:
The iBGStar Blood Glucose Monitoring System (BGMS) consists of a hand-held blood
glucose meter, test strips and one control material (an additional level of control material is
available upon request). The meter is codeless and does not require a calibration code. The
meter is turned on by strip insertion and then the user applies finger-tip/palm blood or control
solution to the strip. The meter begins the assay, which completes in 4 - 12 seconds. The
meter’s software converts the signal generated from the test strip into a plasma equivalent
glucose concentration and displays the value on the meter’s LCD screen. A dock connector
cover, lancing device with cap, power adapter and micro-USB to USB cable is also included.
The iBGStar Blood Glucose Meter can download test results to the iBGStar Diabetes
Manager Application (or App) via the dock connector on the iPhone or iPod touch. The app
can be used to store and manage patient’s diabetes information, review trends, or share with
patient’s healthcare team.
The meter may be used with the iPod touch, 4th generation, and the iPhone 4.

L. Test Principle:
The BGStar test strip contains glucose oxidase enzyme with a redox chemical mediator that
produces an electrochemical signal in proportion to the glucose concentration in the blood
sample. The iBGStar meter measures this signal, using dynamic electrochemistry to correct
for common analytical interferences such as hematocrit.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability (between run precision) was evaluated at room temperature using
venous whole blood adjusted to five different levels of glucose. Twelve iBGStar
blood glucose meters were used, along with twelve individual vials of test strips, one
vial being assigned to each BGMS. The glucose in a venous blood sample, having
Hematocrit 42 ± 2%, was allowed to glycolyze to a low level by standing overnight.
Concentrated glucose solution was added to glucose depleted blood to achieve five
different blood glucose concentration levels.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A venous blood sample was drawn by venipuncture from a single subject. The sample
was adjusted to have a Hematocrit of 42 ± 2% and adjusted to a low glucose level by
metabolic depletion of glucose upon aging at room temperature, the “Low” pool. A
sample was spiked to a high level of glucose near the upper limit of the tested range
of system performance, the “High” pool, by addition of glucose. Glucose levels were
determined by the YSI 2300 glucose analyzer.
Known volumes of each of the Low and High pools were mixed to prepare nine
samples with a range of glucose concentrations 20 to 600 mg/dL. This study was
conducted over a period of one day, using one lot of strips and twelve iBGStar
meters.
Data were evaluated for linearity according to the guidelines given CLSI EP6-A,
Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical
Approach; Approved Guidelines.
A plot of iBGStar data versus YSI reference data was constructed. First-order,
Second-order and Third-order polynomial regression analysis was performed on the
data.

The first-order (linear) model was fitted to the data using weighted least-squares
regression. First-order, second-order and third-order polynomial regression
coefficients and their standard errors were computed, together with degrees of
freedom and standard errors of regression
The statistical significance of any non-linearity was assessed by determining whether
the non-linear coefficients of the second-order and third-order polynomial models
were significantly non-zero using Student's t test. For these coefficients, the t statistic
and the significance of the t-statistic (p value) were computed. The better fitting
(second-order or third-order) polynomial was selected for comparative analysis
against the first-order model. Deviation from linearity was computed at each
concentration.
The bias for sample concentrations < 75 mg/dL was less than 1.5 mg/dL and bias for
glucose sample concentrations > 75 mg/dL did not exceed 6.3%.

The t-statistics shown in Table 4 indicate that the second-order polynomial model has
significant non-linearity (p < 0.05)
Differences between linear and non-linear models were evaluated at each sample
glucose concentrations and differences show deviations to be no more than 5% for
sample glucose concentrations > 75 mg/dL, and were zero for sample glucose
concentrations < 75 mg/dL.

d. Detection limit:
The reportable range is 20 to 600 mg/dL based on the linearity/assay reportable range
study above (section M.1.b).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference study was designed according to CLSI EP7-A2 guideline. 23 common
endogenous and exogenous interference substances were evaluated by spiking venous
blood with three levels of glucose concentrations (70, 120 and 300 mg/dL). The
glucose samples were spiked with five levels of the potentially interfering compounds
and tested on 3 lots of test strips. Bias was calculated as the mean percent difference
in glucose reading between the test and control concentration groups. All samples
tested showed % bias within ± 10% between the test and the control groups. The

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The system accuracy of the iBGStar BGMS was assessed by analysis of fresh
capillary whole blood samples obtained by finger stick from 100 individuals on 13
days (over a 30 day period) at a single clinical site. Glucose concentrations measured
with the iBGStar BGMS were compared to measurements on the YSI 2300. Eight
venous samples were spiked or depleted to achieve specific glucose ranges.
Samples were collected and analyzed over 30 days. A single lot of test strips were
used and at least ten vials of test strips were used.
93 capillary whole blood samples obtained by fingerstick and 7 donor samples were
used in the system accuracy analysis. The range of reference glucose concentrations
obtained during this study was from 34.8 to 508.7 mg/dL. In order to supplement the
five samples below 60 mg/dL, three additional samples were glycolyzed. Four
samples were spiked to achieve specimens with glucose above 450 mg/dL. The range
of hematocrit obtained during this study was from 31.9% to 51.9%.
The singlicate iBGStar glucose concentrations were plotted vs. the YSI 2300 glucose

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. A usability study was performed to assess the readability of the labeling for the US market
by surveying the 107 lay users (aged 18-80 yrs old) that participated in the accuracy
study. Participants varied in age, education, country of origin, and there were more men
(61%) than women (39%). These lay users also completed a questionnaire to response to
whether the device is easy to use and the Instructions for use were written in a way that
makes it easy to use. The majority of the users responded that the device is very easy to
use.

2. Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the results showed that the
labeling (Owner’s Guide, test strip package insert and control solution package insert)
were written at the 8th grade level.
3. Customer service is available 24/7, 365 days a year. Toll free phone number is 1-800-633-
1610 for customer support.
4. A sample volume study was performed to verify the test strip sample volume requirement
and the test strip fill error requirement established for the iBGStar BGMS. One lot of test
strips was tested using blood from ten donors. Blood at each concentration was applied
to strips at five target sample volumes of 1.0, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4 and 0.25 μL. Protocols and
acceptance criteria were provided and found to be acceptable. The sponsor concluded
that sample volume of ≥0.4 µL produced accurate results and samples <0.4 µL give an
error code.
5. Temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated for temperatures ranging
from 10oC to 40oC and relative humidity from 25% to 90%. Protocol and acceptance
criteria were provided and found to be acceptable. The results supported the Sponsor’s
claimed operating temperature from 10oC to 40oC (50oF to 104oF).
6. EMC testing was evaluated and certified by TUV Rheinland and a test report was
submitted stating that the iBGStar passed all tests; dated November 3, 2010.
7. The device is intended for single-patient use only. Super-Sani Cloth Germicidal
Disposable Wipes (Professional Disposables International, Inc., EPA Registration #9480-
4) validated demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus for use with the meter
lancing device, iPhone 4 and 4th generation iPod touch. The sponsor also
demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the
meter, lancing device , iPhone 4 and 4th generation iPod touch after 260 cleaning cycles
and 260 disinfection cycles designed to simulate 5 years of device use.
8. A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of altitude on the iBGStar BGMS. 3 lots of
test strips were tested on 12 meters using blood from 56 donors at that covered the range
of 47 – 413 mg/dL glucose at 10,000 feet above sea level. Each venous blood sample
was also tested by the YSI 2300 analyzer. The meter readings obtained were compared
to the YSI method and the percent bias against the YSI results. Bias was within ± 10%.
Based on the data, the sponsor claims that the iBGStar BGMS can be used at altitude up
to 10,000 feet.
9. The sponsor performed a study to evaluate potential interference from hematocrit using
nine different hematocrit (Hct) levels(20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60%) across the
glucose measuring range (20-600 mg/dL). At each hematocrit level, 6 samples at glucose
concentration of 30, 65, 150, 250, 350 and 450 mg/dL were tested against the YSI
method. 3 lots of test strips were tested on 12 meters and the values were compared to
the YSI method and the nominal hematocrit level (40%). All individual test results were
within 15%, therefore the sponsor claims that hematocrit between 20% to 60% do not
significantly affect the glucose results.
