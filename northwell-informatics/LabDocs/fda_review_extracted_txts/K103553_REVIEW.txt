I. Device Description:
This single level control solution consists of glucose in water with buffers and
stabilizers, a viscosity adjusting agent, a preservative, and a dye. The device is
formulated to provide glucose values representative of fasting blood glucose values in
non‐diabetic subjects. The active ingredient, glucose, is the same analyte measured in
blood specimens by the relevant blood glucose test systems. The viscosity and other
proprietary characteristics of the solution have been modified to mimic the
measurement of blood specimens with this non‐biological, non‐toxic, aqueous
solution. The product does not contain red blood cells, and so, cannot be used to
assess hematocrit effects on glucose measurement. The solution has a red color to
enhance its visibility.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The control solution is formulated gravimetrically to contain 115 mg
glucose/dL solution using scales traceable to NIST traceable mass standards.
The solution is verified to conform to specification by testing on YSI 2300
calibrated using NIST traceable calibrators and in parallel to internally
prepared standard solutions traceable to NIST SRM 917d.
Value assignment:
Control ranges are provided on the test strip vial label. Following all other
manufacturing lot acceptance testing, each lot of test strips is tested using 100
test strips and 50 meters designated for value assignment testing. For value
assignment to be valid, the imprecision from this series of measurements must
be ≤ 2.75 mg/dL SD, and at least 95% of all measurement values must fall
within a range assigned as mean of this series; -10% to +20%.
Stability:
Stability characteristics of the Lifescan OneTouch Ultra, Select and Vita
Control Solutions stored at 2-8oC and 30oC were determined under closed and
opened conditions in real time stability studies. The closed and unopened
Control Solutions were assayed using an YSI2300 analyzer every three
months for 27 months and the results were compared. The study satisfied the
acceptance criteria and supports the closed (unopened) bottle claim of 27
months.
An open vial stability of 90 days was demonstrated by comparing the results
of material from vials stored at 30oC/86oF (opened once per week) to
unopened vials stored at 2-8oC using an YSI2300 analyzer. The
recommendations in the labeling are to store control solutions at room
temperature and additional warnings are given to not refrigerate control
solutions.
