Included with the aggregometer are reagents for ADP or Arachidonic acid assays
(ADPtest or ASPItest reagents respectively). These reagents activate platelets
through specific platelet membrane receptor/signal transduction pathways and are
therefore, used for determination of platelet function or alterations in function.

L. Test Principle:
The principle of measurement of the Multiplate device is electrical impedance. An
electrical current passes through individual sets of electrodes. When the electrodes
come into contact with a whole blood sample platelets bind to and cover the
electrodes in a small monolayer. As the platelets become activated after exposure to a
specific platelet agonist, the platelets strongly adhere to the electrodes and begin to
aggregate. An increase in the number of platelets adhering to the electrodes increases
the resistance (impedance) between the pair of electrodes. The Multiplate software
plots these changes as a curve. The instrument transforms the measured signal into
units (U), which are dependent on the change of resistance. The aggregation is plotted
against the time and the area under the measuring curve is expressed as units (U).

(between 34 and 52U for ADP and between 32 and 48U for AA) and high
(>52U for ADP and >48U for AA) platelet function levels were tested with
three lots of reagents, using three different devices and two different
operators. For each configuration, samples were measured in duplicate. The
experiment was repeated for 10 days for high and medium platelet function
level samples. Low platelet function samples were repeated for 5 days.
The percent positive and negative agreement for the ADPtest and ASPItest at
low and high level platelet function samples was 100%. At medium platelet
levels, the following observations were made:
ADPtest- The measurements for precision were performed with freshly drawn
blood from donors, tested with three different lots of reagent, using three
different devices, and two different operators. For each configuration two
replicates were measured. The experiment was repeated for a minimum of five
days with a new blood draw on each day. Samples from one donor each with
high, medium, and low platelet function levels were tested. Agreement for the
high and low platelet function level samples was 100% for device and lot
variabilities. Lot-to-lot variability with medium platelet function levels around
the cut-off determined a mean of 15.7 (15-17) for samples determined to have
decreased platelet function level and 43.7 (43-45) for samples which exhibit
normal platelet function. Comparably, the mean observations for the device
variability study were 16.3 (11-24) for samples with decreased platelet
function, and 43.7 (36-49) for normal samples. The repeatability study
showed similar results as the reproducibility study.
ASPItest- The measurements for precision were performed with freshly drawn
blood from donors, tested with three different lots of reagents, using three
different devices, and two different operators. For each configuration two
replicates were measured. The experiment was repeated for a minimum of five
days with a new blood draw on each day. Samples from one donor each with
at high, medium, and low platelet function levels were tested. Agreement for
the high and low platelet function level samples was 100% for device and lot
variabilities. Lot-to-lot variability with medium platelet function levels around
the cut-off determined a mean of 28 (23-34) for samples determined to have
decreased platelet function level and 32 (26-37) for samples which exhibit
normal platelet function. Likewise, the mean observations for device
variability study were 28 (22-37) for samples with decreased platelet function,
and 32 (23-38) for normal samples. The repeatability study showed similar
results as the reproducibility study.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Increasing concentrations of platelet function antagonists (Aspirin for the
Arachidonic acid assay and Thienopyridine for the ADP assay) were added to
blood samples from healthy donors prior to measurement. The linear range
5

was determined by linear regression.

Arachidonic acid Aspirin 20-61 U
ADP P2Y12 receptor 25-56 U

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls - The control material that is available for the Verum Multiplate 5.0
aggregometer consists of two liquids of different ionic strengths. The liquid
quality control is an artificial quality control to ensure the quality of the
electronic parts and sensors of the Multiplate system by evaluating the
resistance measurement of the system. Because the controls are used for a
functional test, they do not contain a specific analyte. Rather, mixing of the 2
controls at varying proportions provides two distinct levels of resistance that
are representative of two distinct ranges or measurements on the Verum
Multiplate system.
Expected Values - Value assignment for the liquid control material is
performed by comparison testing at 11 sites for a total of 200 measurements
per control, assessed as amplitude of the electrical signal produced by the
control, expressed in Amplitude Units (AU). In accordance with CLSI
guideline C28-A3c, a reference range is established using the inner 90%
confidence interval.
Control Level 1
Lower Limit (AU) 50.6721
90% CI (AU) 48.7624-52.5418
Upper Limit (AU) 75.1331

Upper Limit (AU) 142.8217
90% CI (AU) 140.3830-145.2971
Results were rounded to the next full integer. Based on the CI limits,
acceptable values for control measurements were set at 50-75 AU for level 1
and 100-140 AU for level 2. Each new lot of liquid control material is tested
and must meet established performance values and pass accelerated stability
testing.
Stability claims - Stability of the lyophilized reagents, frozen reagents,
reconstituted reagents, controls and test cells was determined. The shelf life

f. Assay cut-off:
260 healthy volunteers with no known bleeding disorders who reported to
have abstained from intake of anti-platelet agents were tested with the Verum
Multiplate 5.0 aggregometer Arachidonic acid and ADP assays in three
centers. One measurement was omitted as outlier. The reference intervals
were calculated as the inner 90% confidence interval. Results are summarized
in the table below:
Test No. of Mean Standard 5th 95th Reference

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Whole blood samples from adult patients suspected of platelet dysfunction were
collected at one EU and two U.S. clinical sites. Samples were measured in
singlicate using the Chrono-Log and Multiplate assay ADP and Arachidonic Acid
assays. Using the previously determined cut-offs, samples were determined to
have normal or abnormal platelet function. The positive and negative percent
agreements of the Multiplate to its predicate Chrono-Log were calculated.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
The evaluation of the platelet function status (normal/abnormal) via the
Multiplate 5.0 aggregometer was compared to the clinical assessment of a
three member adjudication panel using the patient clinical history. To this end,
260 patients suspected of platelet dysfunction were tested at three clinical sites
using the Verum Multiplate 5.0 or the predicate device using the ADP and
Arachidonic Acid reagents. The presence of normal or abnormal platelet
function was determined using the cut-off of <43U for ADPtest and <40U for
ASPItest. Due to restricted access to patient data through the local IRB at one
site, the patient history files (including laboratory results, clinical history,
clinical procedures, demographic data, etc.) of 171 study patients were further
assessed by 2 adjudicators for presence of abnormal platelet function based on
the information in each subject’s clinical history. In case of disagreement, a
third panel member made the final determination. Patient sample histories
were numbered sequentially and no identifiers allowed for patient
identification or identification of the clinical testing site.
