L. Test Principle:
The assay is based on a latex enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay. When an antigen-
antibody reaction occurs between CRP in a sample and anti-CRP, which has been
sensitized to latex particles, agglutination results. This agglutination is detected as an
absorbance change at 570 nm with the magnitude of the change being proportional to
the amount of CRP in the sample. The actual concentration is then determined by the
interpolation from a calibration curve prepared from calibrators of known
concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Performance characteristics were established on the Hitachi 917 analyzer
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the Diazyme hsCRP Assay was evaluated according to
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute EP5-A guideline. In the study,
three levels of serum based controls containing approximately 0.8, 1.7, and
8.6 mg/L of CRP, and two serum samples containing approximately 1.2 and
3.6 mg/L of CRP were tested with 2 runs per day in duplicates over 20
working days. An additional serum sample with a value of approximately 15.6
was tested over 5 days with 2 runs per day. Within-run and total precision are
presented in the table below.

Control 2 80 1.75 0.03 1.7 0.05 2.6

Serum 3 20 15.56 0.19 1.2 0.24 1.6
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The claimed measuring range of the assay is 0.20 to 20.0 mg/L. Nine levels of
samples were prepared by diluting a serum control sample with a high level of
CRP with saline according to CLSI EP6-A to produce linearity samples with
the following levels: 0.02, 0.4, 0.87, 1.92, 3.94, 8.50, 12.56, 16.56 and 20.31
mg/L. The linearity samples were tested in triplicate with the Diazyme hsCRP
assay. A linearity analysis was performed using EP Evaluator software. Linear
regression analysis results obtained were as follows: slope = 1.032, intercept =
0.0528, r2 = 0.9994.
To test for High Dose “Hook Effect”, a serum control with 1000 mg/L of
human CRP was diluted with CRP free serum (0 mg/L CRP) to 10 targeted
concentrations. The samples were tested in triplicate. The Diazyme hsCRP
assay showed no High Dose “Hook Effect” up to 160 mg/L of CRP.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Diazyme hsCRP calibrator is traceable to the International Federation of
Clinical Chemistry International Reference Preparation for Plasma Proteins lot
CRM 472/IFCC certified by the Bureau of Reference of the European
Community.
Diazyme CRP calibrators were prepared by spiking human CRP stock
solution to pooled human sera to the target CRP concentrations. Value
assignment of the CRP calibrators was established by transferring the target
values from the ERM-DA472/IFCC CRP to the in-house calibrators.
Diazyme hsCRP reagents and ERM-DA472/IFCC CRP with proper dilutions
as calibrators were used to test the Diazyme CRP calibrator in triplicate on the
Hitachi 917 analyzer. The mean values were assigned as the values of
Diazyme CRP calibrators. The approximate target values are 0, 1.0, 5.0, 10
and 20 mg/L.

CRP controls are prepared by spiking CRP stock solution to diluted pooled
human serum to the target CRP concentrations. The Diazyme hsCRP reagents
and calibrators were used in replicate analysis on the Hitachi 917 analyzer to
determine the mean value of the newly prepared control materials. The target
values are 0.5 to 1.0 mg/L for Level 1; 1.0 to 2.0 for Level 2; and 7.0 to 9.0
for Level 3 and are presented in the labeling.
Accelerated stability testing demonstrated that the calibrators and controls
were stable for 3 months at 2-8oC with opening and closing vials. According
to the Arrhenius law, the shelf-life of the closed Diazyme CRP calibrators and
controls is at least 12 months at 2-8oC. Real time stability studies are on-
going.
d. Detection limit:
The LoB, LoD, and LoQ of Diazyme hsCRP Assay were determined
according to CLSI EP17-A: Protocols for Determination of Limits of
Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline. LoB tests were
conducted using blank samples, 7.5% BSA, tested with 20 replicates daily for
three days with one reagent lot and one Hitachi 917 instrument. LoB was
calculated as the mean of the 57th and 58th highest values = 0.08 mg/L.
For the LoD studies, five low samples were tested with 4 replicates daily for
three days with one reagent lot and one Hitachi 917 instrument. LOD = LOB
+ (1.645* SD of Low samples). The LoD was determined to be 0.13 mg/L.
To calculate the LoQ, five patient serum samples were diluted with 7.5% BSA
to targeted concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/L. The diluted
serum samples were tested with the Diazyme hsCRP reagent on the Hitachi
917 with 5 runs with 4 replicates per run (20 replicates total per sample) using
one reagent lot and one instrument. A curve was fit to estimate the
relationship between mean and % CV. Based on the fitted model, the LoQ
was determined to be 0.20 mg/L. The % CV at the level of 0.2 mg/L was
determined to be 16.6 % with 95% confidence interval of 13.1% to 20.0%. At
this point (0.2 mg/L), the upper 95% confidence interval has a % CV of 20
%.This is the lowest concentration for which % CV is less or equal to 20 %
with 95% confidence interval.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor evaluated the effect of known endogenous interferents on the
Diazyme hsCRP assay following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
EP7-A guidelines, “Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry.”
6

--- Page 7 ---
Two serum samples with two levels of CRP, 0.9 and 2.8 mg/L, were spiked
with various concentrations of endogenous substances at five levels and the
results compared to the samples without added interferent. The samples were
tested using one lot of reagent and one instrument. The following substances
showed no significant interference as defined by the sponsor as less than 10%
deviation when tested at levels equal to the concentrations listed below:
Interference Concentration
Triglyceride 1000 mg/dL
Ascorbic Acid 176 mg/dL
Bilirubin 40 mg/dL
Bilirubin Conjugated 40 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 500 mg/dL
Rheumatoid Factor 400 IU/mL
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method Comparison of the Diazyme hsCRP Assay versus the predicate assay
was performed using CLSI EP9-A2 as a guideline. 56 unaltered individual
serum samples and 1 altered serum sample were tested. The samples had
values ranging from 0.2 to 18.9 mg/L. Passing-Bablok regression analysis of
the Diazyme hsCRP Assay versus the predicate device, Roche Tina-Quant
CRP HS Test System (k042485) produced an equation of Y = 0.0196 +
1.0133 X where Y is the Diazyme method and X is the predicate method. The
95% CI for slope and intercept are 0.9583 to 1.0321 and - 0.1599 to - 0.1017
respectively.
b. Matrix comparison:
To evaluate anticoagulant effects, EDTA plasma and Lithium Heparin plasma,
the CRP levels of 46 unaltered sera / K3 EDTA / Li Heparin plasma sample
sets were tested on Hitachi 917 with the Diazyme hsCRP reagents. The
samples had values ranging from 0.2 to 19.42 mg/L. From the 47 serum-
plasma sets tested, no significant matrix effect was observed between serum,
K3 EDTA plasma, and Li Heparin Plasma. For serum vs. K3 EDTA, the
linear regression equation was y = 0.9143x + 0.0291, r2 = 0.9966. For serum
vs. Lithium heparin plasma, the linear regression equation was y = 0.9256x +
0.0548, r2 = 0.997.
