L. Test Principle:
To test urine, samples are loaded in sample cups, which are placed on the sample ring
of the ACE and ACE Alera instruments. Prior to introduction of the sample into the
cuvettes, urine samples are prediluted with the system diluent in a well segment using
a ratio of 1:20. The diluted sample is transferred to the reaction cuvette, mixed with
the specified reagent, and incubated. The chemical reactions are described below.
ACE Urea Nitrogen Reagent is a photometric test using a coupled enzymatic reaction
(urease and glutamate dehydrogenase), which converts the reduced NADH cofactor
substrate to the oxidized NAD+ product. The reduced cofactor absorbs strongly at 340
nm, whereas its oxidized form does not. The rate of decrease in absorbance in the
reaction cuvette is proportional to the urea nitrogen content of the sample.
ACE Calcium-Arsenazo Reagent is a photometric test, in which calcium in the
sample reacts with Arsenazo III in an acidic solution to form a blue-purple colored
complex. The intensity of color produced is directly proportional to the calcium
concentration in the sample.
ACE Creatinine Reagent is based on a photometric test in which creatinine in the
sample reacts with picric acid in an alkaline medium to form a red-orange colored
complex, which absorbs strongly at 505 nm. The rate of complex formation, during a
fixed time interval, is directly proportional to the creatinine concentration.

ACE Inorganic Phosphorus U.V. Reagent is a photometric test. Under acidic
conditions, inorganic phosphorus in urine reacts with ammonium molybdate to form
an unreduced phosphomolybdate complex, which absorbs strongly at 340 nm. The
increase in absorbance is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorus in the
sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Five urine samples were tested by the sponsor using the Alfa Wassermann
ACE Reagents on one ACE and one ACE Alera Clinical Chemistry System
two times per run, two runs per day, for a total of 22 days. Three human urine-
based sample pools (Samples 1-3) and two urine-based controls (Samples 4-5)
were evaluated. For the calcium reagent study, two human urine sample pools
were evaluated instead of three (Sample 3 was above the reportable range).
Precision studies were also performed at physician’s office laboratory (POL)
sites. One operator at each of four sites, reflective of the intended users of the
device and the intended use setting, evaluated three urine sample pools once
per day in triplicate for a total of 5 days on two ACE (Sites 1 and 4) and two
ACE Alera (Sites 2 and 3) analyzers.
The results of each study are summarized in the tables below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies across the claimed assay ranges for urea nitrogen, calcium,
creatinine and inorganic phosphorus were performed by preparing two urine
samples with very low and high analyte concentrations. The high samples were
prepared from a normal urine which was spiked with commercially available
nitrogen, calcium, creatinine, and inorganic phosphorus. The low samples were
prepared by further diluting urine with deionized water. The low and high pools
were mixed in different proportions to create 13 dilutions. Fifteen samples in all
were assayed in quadruplicate on the ACE and ACE Alera Clinical Chemistry
Systems.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrator material was cleared under k875285. The sponsor re-labels the
calibrator from the manufacturer. The sponsor provided a certificate of
analysis from the manufacturer as well as a procedure describing how the
incoming calibrator material is verified for use on the ACE and ACE Alera
systems.
The sponsor states that the ACE Urine Standard is traceable to the following
standards: Urea Nitrogen-NIST SRM 912a, Calcium- NIST SRM 915b,
Creatinine NIST SRM 914a, Inorganic phosphorus NIST SRM 3139a.
The sponsor claims that the ACE Urine Standard when stored, unopened or
opened, at 2-8ºC is stable until the expiration date on the label.

A detection limit study was performed using CLSI EP17-A as a guide. The
sponsor performed the following studies. Limit of Blank (LoB) was
determined by running a blank sample (saline) 20 times per day over three
days (n=60) with each urine reagent on two ACE and two ACE Alera
analyzers. The limit of detection (LoD) was determined by assaying 5 low
analyte concentration urine samples, 20 times per day in parallel with the LoB
samples over three days (n=60).
The Limit of Quantitation was evaluated by assaying six low analyte diluted
urine samples in eight replicates in five assay runs over two days on one ACE
and one ACE Alera analyzer, for a total of 40 replicates.
The claimed LoB, LoD, and LoQ are summarized in the table below:

e. Analytical specificity:
Testing for endogenous interfering substances was based on CLSI EP-7A2.
Testing was performed on a minimum of six concentrations for each potential
interferent. Urine pools at normal and abnormal levels of analyte with were
used in the evaluation. Samples with the interferents were tested in triplicate
on the ACE and ACE Alera and compared to the same sample without the
interferent (control).
The sponsor defined non-significant interference as the highest level tested
that recovers within ±10% of the control sample. The results are summarized
below.

Hemoglobin 1000 mg/dL, Ascorbic acid 200 mg/dL, Boric acid 250 mg/dL,

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed using CLSI document EP9-A2 as
a guide. Natural and contrived urine specimens (up to 5 spiked or diluted)
were evaluated by Alfa Wasserman and at four physician’s office laboratory
(POL) sites. The POL sites and operators who performed the testing were
representative of the expected intended users and intended use sites. Sites 1
and 4 performed tested on the ACE analyzer and Sites 2 and 3 performed
testing on the ACE Alera analyzer.
The results are summarized below, and include the number of specimens
tested, specimen description, the comparative method, and linear regression
statistics (Deming).
