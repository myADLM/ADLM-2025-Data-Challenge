L. Test Principle:
The ARCHITECT iCarbamazepine assay is a one-step immunoassay for the
quantitative measurement of carbamazepine in human serum or plasma using CMIA
technology, with flexible assay protocols, referred to as Chemiflex.
In the ARCHITECT iCarbamazepine assay, the sample, anti-carbamazepine (mouse,
monoclonal) coated paramagnetic microparticles, and carbamazepine acridinium-
labeled conjugate are combined to create a reaction mixture. The anti-carbamazepine
coated microparticles bind to carbamazepine present in the sample and to the
carbamazepine acridinium-labeled conjugate. After washing, pre-trigger and trigger
solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction
is measured as relative light units (RLUs). An indirect relationship exists between the
amount of carbamazepine in the sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT i
System optics.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated by analyzing two control levels and two serum
panels. Testing was performed on three ARCHITECT i 2000SR using two lots
each of ARCHITECT iCarbamazepine Reagents and Calibrators (for a total of
two reagent lot/calibrator lot combinations) and one lot of commercially
available controls. A single calibration per reagent lot was performed on each
instrument and used for the duration of the study. The controls and panels
were tested in replicates of two, twice per day (separated by a minimum of
two hours), for a total of 20 testing days. The mean concentration, within-run
SD and % CV, between-run SD and % CV were calculated for the controls
and panels for each reagent lot/instrument combination. The total (within-
laboratory) SD and % CV were estimated using the summation of the within-
run, between-run, and between-day variance components.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity
To evaluate linearity, high and low concentration carbamazepine samples
were prepared and combined in a dilution series to produce 7 sample pools
with an expected carbamazepine concentration between approximately 1 and
16 μg/mL. Pools were tested in replicates of four on one ARCHITECT
i 2000SR using one lot each of ARCHITECT iCarbamazepine Reagents and
Calibrators and one lot of commercially available controls. All samples were
tested as a set within a single run.
Linear regression analysis produced the following:
slope: 0.969
y-intercept -0.21
r2 0.999
The sponsor claims a reportable range of 2.0 – 15.0 μg/mL, based on the
linearity and LoQ data.
Recovery
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of the ARCHITECT
iCarbamazepine assay to recover known concentrations of carbamazepine
spiked into human specimens.
Varying concentrations of carbamazepine ranging from approximately 2 to 12
μg/mL were spiked into 50 separate serum samples that did not contain
carbamazepine.

Samples were tested in replicates of 4 on one ARCHITECT i 2000 using
SR
one lot each of ARCHITECT iCarbamazepine Reagents and Calibrators and
one lot of commercially available controls. The mean of the four replicates
was compared to the amount of carbamazepine spiked into each sample to
calculate the recovery. For samples with target values of <5 μg/mL biases
were ± 0.49 μg/mL or less. For samples with target values ≥ 5 μg/mL, the
recoveries ranged from 96 – 108%.
Manual Dilution
To evaluate the manual dilution feature, serum samples that did not contain
carbamazepine were spiked with carbamazepine to target concentrations of
22, 30, 50, and 60 μg/mL. Three samples were prepared at each of the four
levels. A manual dilution (1:4) of each spiked sample was prepared by adding
50 μL of the prepared sample to 150 μL of Calibrator A (0.00 μg/mL). The
spiked samples and manual dilutions were tested in a minimum of two
replicates on one ARCHITECT i 2000 using one lot each of ARCHITECT
SR
iCarbamazepine Reagents and Calibrators, and one lot of commercially
available controls. The manually diluted concentration was then compared to
the target concentration. The individual percent recovery results ranged from
91.6% to 94.2%.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
Calibrators are traceable to a USP certified Carbamazepine Reference
Standard. The sponsor estimates the uncertainty of the assigned values to be ≤
± 2.2% compared to the Reference Standard.
The sponsor manufactures internal reference standards (designated Primary
Calibrators) for this assay using Carbamazepine Reference Standard (USP).
Carbamazepine calibrators (market calibrators) are manufactured
gravimetrically and tested against these internal reference standards.
Primary Calibrator A is prepared with normal human serum with a
carbamazepine concentration of 0.00 μg/mL. Preservatives are added and
Primary Calibrator A is stored at -20°C or colder. Primary Calibrators B
through F are prepared from Primary Stock Standard. The Primary Stock
Standard (at 40 μg/mL) is prepared as follows: A super stock solution is
prepared gravimetrically using Carbamazepine USP Reference Standard
powder, and the material is mixed. Primary Calibrator A is gravimetrically
added, and the solution is mixed. To prepare the Primary Stock Standard, the
super stock solution is gravimetrically diluted to batch size with Primary
Calibrator A to a concentration of 40 μg/mL, and the material is mixed and
stored. Each Primary Calibrator B through F is gravimetrically prepared with
Primary Stock Standard and Primary Calibrator A to a target concentration of
6

--- Page 7 ---
2.00, 4.00, 8.00, 12.00, and 20.00 μg/mL, respectively. The material is mixed,
filled into final containers, labeled, and stored at -20°C or colder.
Preparation of Market Calibrator A. Preservatives are added to normal human
serum not containing carbamazepine, and the material is mixed, filtered,
added to final containers, and stored at 2 to 8°C.
Preparation of Market Calibrators B through F. Preparation of Stock
Standard: Anhydrous methyl alcohol is added to a gravimetrically measured
amount of Carbamazepine USP grade powder, and the material is mixed. The
solution is gravimetrically diluted to batch size with serum not containing
carbamazepine, and the material is mixed. Concentration determination testing
is performed. Each Calibrator B through F is gravimetrically prepared with
stock standard and negative serum to a target concentration of 2.0, 4.0, 8.0,
12.0, and 20.0 μg/mL, respectively. The material is mixed.
Stability
The closed-vial (shelf life) stability claim is 12 months at 2 – 8o C, as
demonstrated by accelerated stability testing. Protocols and acceptance
criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. Real-time stability testing
is ongoing. The open-vial stability claim is 12 months at 2 – 8o C, as
demonstrated by accelerated stability testing. Protocols and acceptance criteria
were reviewed and found to be acceptable. Real-time stability testing is
ongoing.
Value Assignment
Each Calibrator B through F is tested by Relative Light Units (RLU) by
matching against the corresponding primary calibrator by analyzing multiple
replicates on theARCHITECT i System instrument. The on-test calibrator is
compared to the corresponding primary calibrator using a sample/reference
ratio of the mean RLU results. If necessary, the concentration is adjusted by
adding either stock standard or negative serum and the material is mixed. The
material is filled into final containers, labeled, and stored at 2 to 8 C.
Customer Release Testing is performed with the ARCHITECT
iCarbamazepine Calibrators A through F. The calibrators and reference high
and low panels are tested in multiple replicates in one run on each of two
ARCHITECT i System instruments. The calibrators generate the calibration
curve used to calculate the panel concentration results. For each panel, the
mean concentration is calculated for each instrument, and the grand mean
concentration is calculated from the two instrument mean concentrations. The
grand mean concentration values are evaluated against the acceptance criteria.
The components are kit packed and stored at 2 to 8o C.

d. Detection limit:
The sponsor performed a study based on guidance from the CLSI document
EP17-A to determine the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) of the ARCHITECT
iCarbamazepine assay on the ARCHITECT i 2000 . The LoQ was
SR
calculated to be 0.30 μg/mL. The % CV at the LoQ was 11.3 % with a
recovery ranging from 104 – 112%.
The sponsor claims 2.0 μg/mL as the lowest reportable value.
e. Analytical specificity:
Potential interference from drugs was evaluated at carbamazepine
concentrations of 4 and 12 μg/mL.
Normal human serum was used as the zero-level carbamazepine sample. The
low-level and high-level carbamazepine samples were each prepared by
spiking carbamazepine stock solution into normal human serum to target the
lower (4 μg/mL) and upper (12 μg/mL) therapeutic medical decision points.
Compounds with structures similar to carbamazepine or likely to be co-
administered were obtained from commercial vendors.
Test samples were prepared by spiking each drug at the concentration level
listed below into an aliquot of each level of carbamazepine.
Reference samples were prepared by adding diluent to an aliquot of each
level of carbamazepine. The diluent that was used to prepare the reference
samples was the same as the diluent used to prepare the drug stock and was
added at the same volume as was used to prepare the test samples.
The test and reference samples were tested with multiple replicates on one
ARCHITECT i 2000SR using one lot each of ARCHITECT iCarbamazepine
Reagents and Calibrators and one lot of commercially available controls.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 276 serum samples containing carbamazepine were evaluated with
the ARCHITECT iCarbamazepine and AxSYM Carbamazepine assays. The
concentrations tested ranged from 2.22 – 14.97 μg/mL.
For the ARCHITECT iCarbamazepine assay, two lots of ARCHITECT
iCarbamazepine Reagents, one lot of ARCHITECT iCarbamazepine
Calibrators, and one lot of commercially available controls were used. The
specimens were tested using both lots of reagents on one of two ARCHITECT
i 2000 instruments.
SR
For the AxSYM Carbamazepine assay, the specimens were tested in replicates
of two on one AxSYM instrument using one lot of reagents, calibrators, and
controls. The specimens were tested within 24 hours of each other.
Simple linear regression analysis with 95% confidence intervals produced the
following:
slope: 0.93 [0.91 to 0.97]
y-intercept: 0.02 [ -0.2 to 0.3]
corr. coeff. (r): 0.95
Passing-Bablok regression analysis with 95% confidence intervals produced
the following:
slope: 0.97 [0.93 to 1.00]
y-intercept: -0.22 [-0.48 to 0.03]
corr. coeff. (r): 0.95
b. Matrix comparison:
A study was performed to evaluate which blood collection tube types are
acceptable for use with the ARCHITECT iCarbamazepine assay.
There were 50 donors from whom specimens were collected in the following
blood collection tube types: plastic plain (serum), glass plain (serum), plastic
lithium heparin (plasma), plastic sodium heparin (plasma), plastic dipotassium
EDTA (plasma), and glass sodium EDTA (plasma). The approximate
concentrations tested were 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15 μg/mL.
11

--- Page 12 ---
The prepared samples of each sample set were tested on one ARCHITECT i
2000SR in replicates of four using one lot each of ARCHITECT
iCarbamazepine Reagents and Calibrators and one lot of commercially
available controls.
The plain plastic serum tube was used as the control (reference measurement)
against which the other tube types were compared. Four tubes of each type
were drawn from each donor. Individual replicates of each tube type were
compared to the mean of four measurements of the plain plastic serum tube.
99% of the samples had recoveries within ± 10% of the reference tube.
