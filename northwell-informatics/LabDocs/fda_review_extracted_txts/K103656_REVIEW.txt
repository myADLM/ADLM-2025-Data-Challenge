MAS® DOA Total is intended for use as an assayed control for monitoring assay
conditions in semi-quantitative and qualitative analysis of patient urine specimens
for drugs and drug metabolites. These controls are human urine based and are
composed of d-methamphetamine, secobarbital, nitrazepam, oxazepam,
buprenorphine, benzoylecgonine, cotinine, ethyl glucuronide, ethanol, LSD,
methadone, EDDP, methaqualone, morphine, oxycodone, phencyclidine,
propoxyphene, nortriptyline, and L- Δ9-THC-COOH.
MAS® DOA Total provides an estimation of the precision of a device test system
and to detect and monitor systematic deviations from accuracy resulting from
reagent or instrument defects.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
DOA TOTAL offers levels of controls, at concentrations 25% below and 25%
above the screening cutoff levels for D-methamphetamine, PCP (Phencyclidine),
Opiates, Cocaine and Marijuana (Cannabinoid).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The drug values in the DOA TOTAL control are determined by certified
independent laboratories. With the exception of Ethanol, all analytes are tested
by GC/MS or LC/MS. Ethanol was tested by EMIT Plus II assay, since there
is no GC/MS or LC/MS method available currently. The assays are calibrated
by reference standards that are traceable to National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST).
Value Assignment:
The following procedure was used for value assignment
a. Assay Methodology used to assign values:
4) GC/MS assays are used for D-methamphetamine, Barbiturate, Nitrazepam,
Oxazepam, Buprenorphine, Cocaine, Cotinine, Methadone, EDDP,
Methaqualone, Opiates, Oxycodone, PCP, PPX, and THC.
5) LC/MS assays are used for ETG, LSD, and Nortriptyline.
6) EMIT Plus II assay is used for Ethanol.
b. Data Collection:
A minimum of 8 data points are collected for each assay. Data collected from
at least two test sites, over at least two separate days in duplicates, are
required.
c. Confirmation Value Range:
The sponsor assigned the following value assignment criteria
The high limits of L2 published ranges cannot exceed the 1st cutoff value, and
the low limits of L3 published ranges cannot be lower than the 1st cutoff
value.
The high limits of L4 published ranges cannot exceed the 2nd cutoff value, and
the low limits of L5 published ranges cannot be lower than the 2nd cutoff
value.

Stability
Open Vial (5°C) Stability
Three lots of assays containing all levels (3X Level 1-6 vials) were opened
with 1 mL sample volume removed twice a week for a total of 30 days to
simulate actual customers’ usage. On day 31, these samples and their
respective samples from unopened vials are assayed to evaluate the product
open bottle stability.
Data support the 30-day open bottle stability at 5°C for all analytes in the
three pilots evaluated.
Stress Stability to Predict 5°C Shelf Life
Two elevated temperatures at 41°C and 25°C were used to evaluate stress
stability to predict control shelf life at 5°C.
Levels 1 to 6 were incubated at 41°C for 12 days and at 25°C for 90 days.
Multiple time points were tested using the staggered start method, and the
time to failure (TTF) is determined by linear regression.
Data support the acceptance criteria and hence the recommended 5°C shelf
life claim of 24 months.

analyte concentrations of freshly opened vials have been assayed on days 0,
100, 170, 230, and 300 thus far, and studies will continue to establish the 5°C
shelf life claim. The point of failure is determined by linear regression.
Real-time stability monitoring for all three lots will be continued to
substantiate the above predicted claims.
