I. Device Description:
Replacement of the HE4 EIA kit control supplied as part of k072939 with the
separately marketed multi-analyte Tumor Marker Control cleared in k101809.
The Fujirebio Diagnostics Tumor Marker Control (k101809) consists of a Low and
High Control. The kit includes six bottles of lyophilized material (three of each
level). The control is prepared from human serum, purified biochemical materials,
and chemicals. The control contains a preservative (MIT (2-Methylisothiazolin) at a
concentration of 0.1 g/L) and stabilizers (Methylamine at 7.5 g/L and Sucrose at
60g/L).
The table below shows an example of typical target ranges for the two control levels:

Two each of the low and high levels Fujirebio multi-analyte Tumor Marker
Controls were analyzed with 1 HE4 test kit in 2 replicates, 2 runs per day for
10 days (two hours between runs) and 2 operators performed 10 assays
each.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
No claims for traceability. There is no standard or reference material for the
HE4 protein.
Expected/assigned Values:
Value assignments for the HE4 analyte for each lot are performed by Fujirebio
Diagnostics, AB. Mean values for each level of each analyte are performed
by running a minimum of 24 replicates using different HE4 EIA kit reagent
combinations. It is recommended that each laboratory establish its own means
and acceptable ranges and use the printed ranges as guidance only. Values
and ranges are lot specific. Acceptance ranges for the target-setting reference
system, EIA from Fujirebio Diagnostics are summarized in the table below:
Design Goal Level 1 Mean Design Goal Level 2 Mean
Analyte Target Mean Acceptance Target Mean Acceptance
Level 1 Range Level 2 Range
HE4 pM 75.0 45 – 105 500 300-700
Stability:
The stability studies were performed in compliance to the CEN standard,
13640 – Stability Testing of In Vitro Diagnostic Reagents. Stability data was
submitted in k101809.
Accelerated Stability and real time (closed/shelf life) stability:
Two lots of lyophilized Fujirebio Diagnostics Tumor Marker Controls were
tested. The lyophilized Fujirebio Diagnostics Tumor Marker Control vials
were stored at 2-8°C (reference), ambient temperature (test) and 37°C (test).
The Fujirebio Diagnostics Tumor Marker Controls (test and reference) were
run in duplicate after reconstitution per product insert instructions. Real time

stability studies are currently ongoing. The shelf life stability is based on the
accelerated stability study. The claimed shelf life stability is 18 months
lyophilized at 2-8°C
Open vial stability/Reconstituted Stability:
Two lots of Fujirebio Diagnostics Tumor Marker Controls were tested.
Lyophilized Fujirebio Diagnostics Tumor Marker Control vials (reference)
were stored at 2-8˚C. Reconstituted vials were stored at 2-8°C (test) or ≤
20°C (test). The tests and reference (after reconstitution) were run in
duplicate at various time points. The claimed open vial stability once the
control is reconstituted for HE4 is 14 days when stored tightly capped at 2-
8°C or 60 days when stored at ≤ 20°C after reconstitution.
Freeze/Thaw Stability:
Two lots of lyophilized Fujirebio Diagnostics Tumor Marker Controls are
used for the study. The test vials were reconstituted at the start of the study
and then frozen and thawed for multiple cycles and compared to lyophilized
Fujirebio Diagnostics Tumor Marker Control vials (reference) that were
stored at 2-8˚C before reconstitution. The sponsor claims that controls may be
frozen and thawed repeatedly for up to 9 cycles.
Transport stability:
Two lots of lyophilized Fujirebio Diagnostics Tumor Marker Controls are
used for the study. The lyophilized Fujirebio Diagnostics Tumor Marker
Control vials were stressed under varying conditions and then stored at the
recommended storage condition of 2-8°C. Transport stability for the Fujirebio
Diagnostics Tumor Marker Controls is currently ongoing.
