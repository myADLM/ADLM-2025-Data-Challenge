H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
2. Indications(s) for use:
For in vitro diagnostic use, for the calibration verification of the
IMMULITE®/IMMULITE 1000 Progesterone assay (LKPW).
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
IMMULITE®/IMMULITE 1000 system
I. Device Description:
The Calibration Verification Material (CVM) contains one set of four vials, 2 mL each,
spiked with low, intermediate and high levels of progesterone in processed human serum,
with preservative, and a progesterone-free sample. The Calibration Verifiers are supplied in
liquid form, ready to use. Store unopened materials refrigerated at 2–8°C until expiration
date. The product is labeled as stable at 2–8°C for 30 days after opening.
Warnings and Precautions: For in vitro diagnostic use. Follow universal precautions, and
handle all components as if capable of transmitting infectious agents. Individual source
materials derived from human blood were tested by FDA approved/cleared methods and
found nonreactive for syphilis; for antibodies to HIV 1 and 2; for hepatitis B surface antigen;
and for antibodies to hepatitis C. Sodium azide, at concentrations less than 0.1 g/dL, has
been added as a preservative. On disposal, flush with large volumes of water to prevent the
buildup of potentially explosive metal azides in lead and copper plumbing.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The IMMULITE Progesterone CVMs are traceable to an internal standard
manufactured using qualified materials and measurement procedures. Internal
reference standards are prepared using Progesterone stock solution which had its
concentration defined by optical density.
Stability:
Stability studies are being conducted on two lots under the following conditions: real
time (2-8 °C) for 2 years, room temperature (15-28°C) for seven days, and
accelerated (35-39°C) for three days. Current testing supports a seven month storage
claim at 2-8°C, and real time studies are ongoing to support a 2 year stability claim.
Open vial studies are being performed for >90 days at 2-8°C. Vials are opened and
tested at day zero and at each time point. Percent recovery is calculated using the
average dose from triplicate results compared to the day 0 testing and the acceptance
criteria is that the open vial must be within 10% from day 0 material for progesterone
≥2 ng/mL, and within 15% for progesterone ≥ 0.5ng/mL and <2.0 ng/mL. The
sponsor will claim that it is stable for 14 day once reconstituted and stored at 2-8 °C.
Value Assignment
The IMMULITE® calibrators and CVMs are value assigned using purified
Progesterone stock solution whose concentration was defined by optical density. The
calibrators and CVMs are tested on minimum of 9 runs comprised of minimum 3
systems and 3 different kit lots. The calibrator values are calculated based on the
recovered values for each run independently. The average analyte recovered for each
CVM assigns their value. Quality control is performed by calculating the recovery of
patient sample panels and controls using the assigned calibrator and CVM values.
Three levels of commercially available controls and four levels of human serum
based pools are used to validate the CVM value assignment. The target specifications
for production lots are:
CV M (ng/mL) Target (ng/mL) Range Precision
(ng/mL) (% CV)
0 0 0.0-0.20 NA
0.47 0.47 0.26-0.68 <25

The Sponsor spiked three concentrations of progesterone CVM into a reference lot,
evaluation lot, and male and female human serum lots. The progesterone values of the
reference lot were compared to the evaluation and human serum lots. The acceptance
criteria were 100% ± 15% with an overall average of ±10%. Each of the samples met
the acceptance criteria, and the Sponsor concluded that there were no matrix effects.
