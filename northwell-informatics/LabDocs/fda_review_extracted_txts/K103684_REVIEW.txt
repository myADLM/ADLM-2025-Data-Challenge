H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use:
VRESelect™ is a selective and differential chromogenic medium, containing
8 μg/mL of vancomycin, for the qualitative detection of gastrointestinal
colonization of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) and
vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VREfs) and to aid in the prevention
and control of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) in healthcare settings.
The test is performed on rectal swabs from patients to be screened for VRE
colonization. VRESelect™ is not intended to diagnose VRE infection nor to
guide or monitor treatment of infection. Results can be interpreted after 24 to 28
hours incubation. Subculture to non-selective media (e.g., trypticase soy agar
with 5% sheep blood) is needed for further identification, susceptibility testing
and epidemiological typing.

I. Device Description:
VRESelect™ is a selective medium for the detection of vancomycin-resistant
Enterococcus (VRE). The selectivity of this medium is based on the presence of an
antifungal/antibiotic mixture that inhibits the growth of most yeast, Gram negative
and Gram positive bacteria, with the exception of VRE. Vancomycin-resistant E.
faecium will appear as pink colonies on the agar medium. Blue colonies on the agar
medium, suggestive of vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis should be confirmed by
catalase and antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

L. Test Principle:
VRESelect ™ is a selective medium for the detection of vancomycin-resistant
Enterococcus (VRE). The selectivity of this medium is based on the presence of an
antifungal/antibiotic mixture that inhibits the growth of most yeasts, Gram negative
and Gram positive bacteria, with the exception of VRE.
Detection is based on the cleavage of chromogenic substrates by specific enzymes of
Enterococcus faecium which produces pink colonies and Enterococcus faecalis which
produces blue colonies.
Enterococcus gallinarum and Enterococcus casseliflavus are intrinsically resistant to
vancomycin and may grow on the VRESelect™ medium as colorless or white
colonies because they do not metabolize the chromogenic substrates. Vancomycin-
susceptible enterococci are inhibited.
After 24 to 28 hours incubation pink colonies can be reported as vancomycin-resistant
E. faecium and blue colonies should be confirmed by a catalase test and susceptibility
testing.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated at three sites using a blinded panel of six
ATCC reference strains including two vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis
strains, three vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains and one strain of
vancomycin-susceptible E. faecalis. At each site, three technicians tested the
panel on three lots of the VRESelect™ each day, for three days. The strains
produced the expected results with the VRESelect™ 100% of the time both at
24 and 28 hours.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended quality control (QC) organisms, E. faecium (vanA) ATCC
700221 and E. faecalis (vanB) ATCC 51299 as positive controls, and
E. faecalis ATCC 29212 as negative control were used. Quality control was
performed on each day of testing. Quality control data was compiled across all
three sites and overall QC results were acceptable.

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity Study
A Cross-reactivity study was performed using at total of 119 strains of Gram
negative rods, Gram positive cocci, and yeast. No cross-reactivity was
observed with any of the organisms tested and no variation was seen between
the 24 and 28 hour incubation time.
Interference Study
The following substances were evaluated for potential interference with the
performance of the VRESelect™ medium:
• Dulcolax, Adult Glycerin Suppositories, Vaseline, Preparation H, Original
Boudreaux’s Butt Paste, Tuck’s Medicated Cooling Pads, Pepto-Bismol,
Miconazole cream, Nonoxynol-9 (spermicide), KY Jelly, and Pepcid AC
Max strength.
• Blood and Mucins
• Three commonly used transport media – Amies without charcoal, Cary
Blair and LQ Stuart
The interfering substances tested caused no significant differences between
the number of colonies observed on the control plates and the number of
colonies observed on the VRESelect™ plates. The only exceptions were
Tuck’s Medicated Cooling Pads and Miconazole cream. Regarding Tuck’s
Medicated Pads, no pink coloration was observed after 24 hours on the
VRESelect™ plates that had been inoculated with vancomycin-resistant
E. faecium (ATCC 700221). Regarding Miconazole cream, an inhibitory
effect on the growth of Enterococcus colonies on the VRESelect™ plates was
observed. Blood and mucin (3% to 5%) caused delayed colonial growth of
one strain of vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis (ATCC 51299) tested. The
growth of the same strain of vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis was inhibited at
blood and mucin concentrations of 30% to 50%.

Mixed Infection Study
A mixed infection study was conducted to demonstrate that high levels of E.
gallinarum and/or E. casseliflavus will not suppress the growth of
vancomycin-resistant E. faecium or E. faecalis. The results of the study
revealed E. faecium or E. faecalis are still detected on the VRESelect ™
medium in the presence of high levels of E. casseliflavus and E. gallinarum.
f. Analytical Sensitivity
Recovery Study
The minimum concentration of VRE reliably detected by VRESelect ™ is
103 CFU/mL.
To determine the percent recovery for the VRESelect ™ media a panel of
eighteen vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) – eight strains of
vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and ten strains of vancomycin-resistant E.
faecalis – were tested at varying dilutions. A 0.5 McFarland suspension of
each strain was prepared. A series of 10-fold serial dilutions in saline were
carried out and inoculated onto three lots of VRESelect ™ plates and one lot
of Blood Agar plates. The plates were incubated at 35-37°C ambient air and
read at 24 and 28 hours. The color and number of colonies were recorded. The
Blood Agar plates were used to confirm the inoculum concentration at each
dilution. Data confirm that the minimum concentration of VRE reliably
detected by VRESelect ™ is 103 CFU/mL.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The performance of the VRESelect™ agar medium was evaluated at four
laboratory sites. A total of 757 rectal swab specimens were evaluated. Rectal
swab specimens were inoculated on the VRESelect™ agar medium and the
Bile Esculin Azide Agar with 6μg/ml of Vancomycin (BEAV). The BEAV
plates were observed for growth at 24 and 48 hours. The VRESelect™ plates
were observed at 24 and 28 hours. Colonies with blue or pink pigment
(VRESelect™) or brown to black pigment diffusing into the medium (BEAV),
were identified by a combination of conventional reference methods to
include Gram stain, catalase, PYR, VITEK 2 identification, and vancomycin
MIC E-Test.

methods is presented in Table 1.

*Ten of the 27 specimens that were BEAV plus confirmation negative and
grew pink and/or blue colonies on VRESelect™ media, after subculture from
VRESelect™ to blood agar plates (BAP), were confirmed to be vancomycin-
resistant E. faecium and/or E. faecalis by Vitek 2 biochemical identification
and vancomycin E-Test. Seventeen specimens grew pink and/or blue colonies
on VRESelect™ that were not confirmed by Vitek 2 biochemical
identification and vancomycin E-Test to be either vancomycin-resistant
E. faecium and/or E. faecalis and represent false positive results.
Performance data for the VRESelect™ agar medium compared to the
VITEK® 2 biochemical identification, for both isolates of E. faecalis (VREfs)
and E.faecium (VREfm) is presented in Table 2.

** Of the eight specimens that were identified as E. faecalis by Vitek 2
biochemical identification, and did not grow blue colonies on VRESelect™
media, six were shown to be vancomycin susceptible by the reference arm of
the study. One specimen grew blue colonies on VRESelect™ after 28 hours
and one specimen was determined to be false negative result.
† Twenty-three specimens not identified as E. faecalis on the reference arm of
the study grew blue colonies on VRESelect™ media. Thirteen of those
specimens, after subculture from VRESelect to BAP, were confirmed as
vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis or E. faecalis /E. faecium by Vitek 2
biochemical identification and vancomycin E-Test. Ten specimens were
confirmed to be false positive including six from which Staphylococcus was
isolated.
