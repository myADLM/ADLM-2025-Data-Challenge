There are no changes to the existing products except the addition of AAG value
assignment process and the addition of the AAG analyte to the intended use of the
device. The product has the same formulation, part number, manufacturing,
packaging, and labeling as the current ADVIA Chemistry Liquid Specific Protein
Calibrator. All of the analytes in k031608 and k061056 are present but may not
have a value assignment (Ferritin and CRP) in this iteration of the ADVIA
Chemistry Liquid Specific Protein Calibrators.
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Guidance for Industry - Abbreviated 510(k) Submissions for In Vitro Diagnostic
Calibrators; Final
L. Test Principle:
Not applicable
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable for this device type.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The Alpha-Acid Glycoprotein (AAG) analyte in ADVIA Chemistry systems
Liquid Specific Protein calibrator is traceable to the International Reference
Material for Serum Proteins, serum-based lyophilized ERMDA-470
(previously known as CRM470).
Value Assignment:
Assigned lot-specific values will be utilized for the AAG calibration (and
other analytes) on ADVIA Chemistry systems. The lot-specific calibrator
values are generated via value assignment on the ADVIA 1650 Chemistry
system using Master Lot calibrators. These values are also used on the other
ADVIA Chemistry platforms (1650, 1800, 1200, and 2400).
Stability:
Unopened vials stored as directed in the package insert (2 – 8 °C) were shown
to be stable for 24 months in a real-time stability experiment. Opened vials
were shown to be stable for 28 days when stored at as directed in the package
insert (2 – 8 °C). The acceptance criterion for each method is expressed in
terms of a drift in recovery versus time. Each analyte must meet the pre-
determined acceptance criteria for storage conditions recommended by the
manufacturer.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Not applicable.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
