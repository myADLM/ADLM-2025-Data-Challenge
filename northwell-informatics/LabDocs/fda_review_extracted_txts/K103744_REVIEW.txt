I. Device Description:
The Dropper A1c Diabetes Control consists of two levels; one level represents
Hb1A1c near the threshold level and one in the pathological range. The controls are
supplied as a ready to use frozen liquid, requiring no reconstitution or dilution. They
are prepared in a whole blood matrix fortified to target levels with reagent grade
chemicals added to achieve the two levels. Preservatives have been added to inhibit
microbial growth.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The Hemoglobin A1c material is traced to a National Glycohemoglobin
Standardization Program (NGSP) Certified testing method performed on
Siemens Dimension RxL and DCA 2000+ analyzers.
Value Assignment
The Dropper A1c Diabetes Control consists of two levels of Hemoglobin A1c
(Hb1A1c); one level near the threshold level (Level 1) and one in the
pathological range (Level 2). Value assignment is performed by running each
level once per day on each analyzer for three days by two or more different
operators (six or more tests per analyzer). All values for each analyzer are
inputted and the range for each level is set at ±20% from the calculated mean
value. The mean and ranges for Level 1 and 2 are provided for each analyzer
in the table below.

Stability:
The closed vial stability was evaluated in accelerated and real-time stability
studies. Unopened vials stored at 25oC (test material) or 37oC (test material)
were tested against unopened vials stored at -10oC to -30oC (reference
material) at predetermined time points during a 6 month interval. Based upon
accelerated study data, the sponsor claims closed vial stability of 180 days at 2
to 8oC. Real-time stability study is on-going.
The open vial stability was evaluated in accelerated and real-time stability
studies. Opened vials stored at 37oC (test material) were tested in duplicate
against unopened vials stored at -10oC to -30oC (reference material) at
predetermined time points during a 6 month interval. In a second real-time
stability study, opened vials stored at 25oC (test material) were tested in
duplicate against unopened vials stored at -10oC to -30oC (reference material)
at five time points during a 1 month interval. Based upon accelerated and a
real-time stability studies, the sponsor claims open vial stability of 180 days at
2 to 8oC or 21 days at 18 to 25oC.
