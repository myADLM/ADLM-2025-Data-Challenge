L. Test Principle:
ELITech Clinical Systems CHOLESTEROL HDL SL 2G:
An enzymatic colorimetric determination of HDL cholesterol based on accelerator selective
detergent. First, the patient sample is mixed with reagent R1 containing a selective
accelerator to deactivate all cholesterol of non-HDL lipoproteins (LDL, VLDL &
chylomicrons):
Second, reagent R2 is added to solubilize and enzymatically measure HDL via a color
formation with peroxidase:

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
ELITech Clinical Systems CHOLESTEROL HDL SL 2G:
Precision was evaluated following guideline EP5-A2. Two replicates each of 3 control
samples at clinically relevant decision levels were tested twice a day on 20 separate days,
yielding 80 replicates total over 40 runs. Control samples included one diluted (all
dilutions for performance testing was done with saline) human sera pool sample, one

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The ELITech Clinical Systems CHOLESTEROL HDL 2G CALIBRATOR, the ELITech
Clinical Systems CHOLESTEROL LDL 2G CALIBRATOR, and the ELITech Clinical
Systems ELITROL I and ELITROL II are traceable to the reference method
recommended by the CDC. These calibrators are all reviewed under 510(k) numbers
k021316, k971573, and k093883 respectively.
Stability:
Real-time testing as well as on-board, shelf life and post-reconstitution stability studies
were conducted. The stability study protocols and the sponsor defined acceptance criteria
have been reviewed and found to be acceptable. The study results support the stability

samples from the calibration on the first day. The results support the product claim of a 28-
day calibration interval.
Value Assignment:
ELITech Clinical Systems CHOLESTEROL HDL 2G and LDL 2G CALIBRATORs:
Value assignment of all calibrators is obtained by assaying the new calibrator sets as
unknowns, run in triplicate on one machine. The mean is calculated based upon
comparison with an already approved calibrator lot. Acceptance criteria state that the
new calibrators must fall within ± 10% of the target values.
ELITech Clinical Systems ELITROL I and ELITROL II
Value assignment of controls is obtained by assaying 3 vials of reconstituted controls of
the same lot, run in triplicate on one machine. The mean is calculated and compared to
the certificate of analysis from the manufacturing company. Acceptance criteria state
that the controls must fall within ± 15% of the target values listed in the certificate of
analysis.
The ELITech Clinical Systems CHOLESTEROL HDL SL 2G and CHOLESTEROL
LDL SL 2G assays have not been tested or certified by the Cholesterol Reference Method
Laboratory Network (CRMLN).
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) were
determined following guideline EP17-A.
ELITech Clinical Systems CHOLESTEROL HDL SL 2G:
Study Protocol:
For LoB determination, 60 replicates of blank samples were measured on one day, using
one analyzer and one reagent lot – giving 60 determinations in total.
For LoD determination, four diluted sample pools were prepared from four different
patient samples pools and diluted with saline to obtain a concentration close to four times
the calculated LoB. Each of the sample pools was measured 15 times in one run, using
one instrument and one reagent lot. As the resultant data was not Gaussian, the LoD was
calculated as LoB + D (where D is determined by calculating the median minus the
S,β S,β
5th percentile in the low concentration sample distribution).
For LoQ determination, four sample pools were prepared from four different patient
samples pools and diluted with saline to obtain a concentration close to the expected LoQ.
Each of the sample pools was measured 15 times in one run, using one instrument and
13

one reagent lot. By calculating the total error interval (= Bias ± 2SD) with a sponsor
defined acceptance criterion of ≤15.8% total error, the LoQ was determined and was
acceptable.

e. Analytical specificity:
• Interference
ELITech Clinical Systems CHOLESTEROL HDL SL 2G:
Study Protocol:
The sponsor evaluated the effect of the interfering substances using two patient serum
pools with endogenous HDL at 31 mg/dL and 54 mg/dL. For each potential interfering
substance, between 5 and 9 different concentrations were spiked with the test substance
up to the maximum level shown below. The sponsor defined no significant interference
as ± ≤ 10%. The HDL results (mean of triplicates) of the paired pools were compared and
% difference was calculated and evaluated for interference determination.
