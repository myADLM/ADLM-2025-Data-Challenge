3. Special condition for use statement(s):
Prescription Use Only
4. Special instrument Requirements:
VITEK® 2 and the VITEK® 2 Compact Systems
I. Device Description:
Each VITEK® 2 test card contains 64 micro-wells. A control well which contains
only microbiological culture media is resident on all cards, with the remaining
wells containing premeasured amounts of a specific antibiotic combined with
culture medium. A suspension of organism is made in 0.45 sterile saline from a
pure culture and standardized to a 0.5 McFarland standard using the DensiChek2.
The desired card(s) are placed in the cassette along with an empty tube for the
susceptibility card. The VITEK® 2 System automatically vacuum fills, seals and
places the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK® 2 Compact has a manual
filling, sealing and loading operation. Cards are then transferred from the cassette
into the carousel for incubation (35.50 C) and optical scanning during testing.

Optics systems use visible light to directly measure organism growth. This
transmittance optics is based on an initial light reading of a well before significant
growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same well
measure organism growth by how much light is prevented from going through the
well. Readings are performed every 15 minutes. An interpretive call is made
between 4 and 16 hours for a "rapid" read but may be extended to 18 hours in
some instances. The VITEK® 2 Susceptibility Card test is based on the
microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) technique with
concentrations equivalent to standard method concentrations. Several parameters
based on the growth characteristics observed are used to provide appropriate input
for the MIC calculations. Growth pattern analysis is used to develop the
algorithm that determines the susceptibility result for all antimicrobials on the
VITEK® 2 system. The MIC result must be linked to organism identification in
order to determine a category interpretation. A category interpretation will be
reported along with an MIC. This is only an auto-read result; manual readings are
not possible.
The VITEK® 2 AST Gram Negative Imipenem has the following concentrations
in the card: 1, 2, 6, 12 µg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by
efficacy in µg/mL). The MIC result range for the VITEK® 2 card is ≤0.25 -
16μg/mL.

L. Test Principle:
Each VITEK®2 test card contains 64 microwells. A control well, that contains only
microbiological culture medium is resident on all cards, with the remaining wells
containing premeasured amounts of a specific antibiotic combined with culture
medium. A suspension of organism is made in 0.45-0.5% sterile saline from a pure
culture and standardized to a McFarland 0.5 standard using the DensiChek2. The
desired card(s) are placed in the cassette along with an empty tube for the
susceptibility card. The cassette is placed in the VITEK®2 instrument where a
susceptibility test will be automatically diluted from the ID suspension by the
VITEK®2. The cards are then automatically vacuum filled; the tubes are cut and the
cards sealed prior to proceeding to the Incubator Loading Station. Cards are then
transferred from the cassette into the carousel for incubation (35.5o C) and optical
scanning during testing. Readings are performed every 15 minutes.
In addition to the automatic dilution, there is also a manual inoculation dilution
procedure described in the packager insert.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using 10 isolates at 3 sites on 3 separate
days in triplicates. The study included the Auto-dilution and the Manual
dilution with the VITEK®2, and the Manual dilution with the VITEK®2
Compact. All results were >95% reproducible.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
Page 5 of 9

--- Page 6 ---
The recommended QC isolates were tested on every test occasion with the
reference method and the VITEK®2. The reference method QC results
were in range for every day tested. The VITEK®2 was tested a sufficient
number of times to demonstrate that the system can produce QC results in
the recommended range.
Quality Control was performed during the studies using both the auto-
dilution and the manual method of diluting the organisms. Results
demonstrated that methods were comparable with the same mode.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical study was performed at four external sites using the VITEK 2
Gram Negative Imipenem and broth microdilution panels containing
Imipenem. A total of 608 clinical isolates were tested at four external sites
by auto inoculation. The no growth rate was 1.5% (9/608); fifteen of the
599 clinical isolates were from frozen stocks (2.5%, 15/599). For
comparison of auto and manual dilution, the challenge set of 246 isolates
was included.

When analyzing the Serratia marcescens in the challenge study by manual
method, it was noted that the EA by Compact was low at 61.5%; the CA
was 100% because non-susceptible isolates are rare and might not be
available for testing. However, the EA of the VITEK 2 manual dilution
was high at 92.3%. An additional study was conducted with a total of 90
Serratia marcescens isolates with the following results:
