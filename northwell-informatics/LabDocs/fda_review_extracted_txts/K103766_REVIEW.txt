H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use:
The Cepheid® Xpert Flu Assay is an automated, multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay
intended for the in vitro qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A, influenza
B and 2009 H1N1 influenza viral RNA. The Xpert Flu Assay uses nasal
aspirates/washes and nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from patients with signs
and symptoms of respiratory infection in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological
risk factors. The Xpert Flu Assay is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the
sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2009-2010
influenza season when 2009 H1N1 influenza was the predominant influenza A virus in
circulation. When other influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics
may vary.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent
influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture
should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and
culture specimens.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:

I. Device Description:
The Xpert Flu Assay is an automated in vitro diagnostic test for qualitative detection and
differentiation of influenza A, influenza B and influenza A subtype 2009 H1N1 from
nasal aspirates/washes (NA/W) and nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens from patients
with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. The assay is performed on the Cepheid
GeneXpert® instrument systems.
The GeneXpert instrument systems automate and integrate sample purification, nucleic
acid amplification, and detection of the target sequence in simple or complex samples
using real-time PCR and rRT-PCR assays. The GeneXpert Instrument System family
comprises a GeneXpert (GX) instrument, GX-I, GX-IV, GX-IV or GeneXpert Infinity-
48, with 1, 4, 16 and 48 modules respectively, a computer, and preloaded software for
running tests and viewing the results. The GeneXpert Infinity also contains robotic
features for cartridge handling. Each module contains a syringe drive for dispensing
fluids, an ultrasonic horn for lysing cells or spores, a valve drive for sample movement,
and I-CORE® thermocycler for performing real-time PCR and detection.
All systems require the use of the assay-specific single-use disposable cartridges that hold
the PCR reagents and host the PCR process. The patented single-use cartridges contain:
(1) eleven chambers for holding sample, reagents, or other materials, (2) a valve body
composed of a plunger and syringe barrel, (3) a rotary valve system for controlling the
movement of fluids between chambers, (4) an area for capturing, concentrating, washing,
and lysing cells, (5) dry real-time PCR reagents, (6) an integrated PCR reaction tube that
can be automatically filled by the instrument, and (7) liquid reagents. To eliminate test-
to-test contamination, all fluids including amplicons, are contained within the disposable
cartridge. The instrument never comes into contact with any fluids within the cartridge.
Each disposable cartridge is intended to test one sample. Cartridges are not re-usable.
The GeneXpert cartridge is loaded onto the GeneXpert® Instrument System platform,
which performs hands-off automated sample processing and real-time PCR for detection
of RNA or DNA. Summary and detailed test results are obtained in 75 minutes and are
displayed in tabular and graphic formats.
A sample processing control (SPC) and a system control (probe check control) are
controls utilized by the GeneXpert Instrument System platform. The SPC is pre-loaded
into the GeneXpert cartridge provided with the assay. The SPC is an encapsidated RNA
made up of recombinant fragments developed so that there is no homology to the
influenza genome. The SPC is present to control for adequate processing of the target
viruses and to monitor the presence of inhibitors in the PCR reaction to reduce the
possibility of false negative results. The SPC also ensures the PCR reaction conditions
(temperature and time) are appropriate for the amplification reaction and that the PCR
reagents are functional. The Probe Check Control verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube
filling in the cartridge, probe integrity and dye stability.
Commercially-available external controls may also be run in accordance with local, state,
3

and federal accrediting organizations, as applicable.
The Xpert Flu Assay includes reagents for the simultaneous detection of the target
viruses. The primers and probes in the Xpert Flu Assay detect the presence of nucleic
acid sequences for Influenza A (Flu A), Influenza B (Flu B) and Influenza A sub-type
2009 H1N1 (2009 H1N1). The assay for detection of Influenza A uses primers and
probes designed against a region in segment 8 of the influenza genome that encodes the
matrix gene. The assay for differentiation of 2009 H1N1 targets a region in segment 4
that encodes the hemagglutinin gene. The assay for detection of RNA from Influenza B
uses primers and probes designed against segment 4 in a region that encodes the
hemagglutinin gene.
Nasal aspirates/washes (NA/W) and nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens from patients
suspected of having influenza are collected in Universal Transport Medium (UTM) and
transported to the GeneXpert area.
The specimen is briefly mixed by inverting the collection tube 5 times. For NP swab
specimens, using the supplied 300 µL transfer pipette, 300 µL of the sample are
transferred to the sample chamber (large opening) of the Xpert Flu Assay Cartridge. For
NA/W specimens, the specimen is first diluted by using the supplied 300 µL transfer
pipette and transferring 300 µL of the specimen 2 times (600 µL total) into a fresh 3 mL
(3000 µL) UTM tube. The diluted specimen is mixed by inverting the tube 5 times.
Using a clean supplied 300 µL transfer pipette, 300 µL of the diluted specimen are
transferred to the chamber with the large opening of the Xpert Flu Assay Cartridge.
Reagent 1 (Binding Reagent) is dispensed by squeezing the entire contents into the
chamber with the small opening of the Xpert Flu Assay Cartridge. The GeneXpert®
Instrument system performs sample preparation by mixing the sample with the sample
processing control and treatment reagents, capturing the nucleic acids on a cellulose
column. The column is washed to remove contaminants and the purified nucleic acids
are eluted and then mixed with dry real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) reagents and
transferred into the PCR tube for rRT-PCR and detection of Flu RNA. The complete
process takes about 75 minutes.
The results are interpolated by the GeneXpert Instrument Systems software from
measured fluorescent signals and embedded calculation algorithms and will be shown in
the “View Results” window. All possible final test results are described below.
The Xpert Flu Assay provides test results for influenza A, influenza B and influenza A,
subtype 2009 H1N1, according to the following algorithms:

pipet, 300 µL of the mixed sample is transferred to the chamber with the large opening of
the Xpert Flu Assay Cartridge. For nasal aspirate/wash (NA/W) samples, the sample is
diluted by placing 600 µL of the NAW sample (using a 300 µL transfer pipetter 2 times)
into a 3 mL UTM tube. The contents of the tube are mixed by inverting the tube 5 times.
Following the mixing step, 300 µL of the diluted, mixed sample is transferred to the
chamber with the large opening of the Xpert Flu Assay Cartridge.
After the sample is added, Reagent 1, a Binding Reagent, is transferred by squeezing the
entire contents of the Reagent 1 tube into the chamber with the small opening of the
Xpert Flu Assay Cartridge.
The user initiates a test from the system user interface, the instrument signals the user
where to place the cartridge, and the cartridge is placed into the indicated module in the
GeneXpert Dx System instrument, or onto a conveyor belt on the GeneXpert Infinity
System, which then transports the cartridge to the appropriate GeneXpert module or to
the holding area for later transport to the appropriate GeneXpert module. Fluidic
movements under control of the instrument move the sample and reagents to and from
different chambers within the Xpert Flu Assay cartridge. The GeneXpert® instrument
systems perform sample preparation by first mixing the sample with the Sample
Processing Control (encapsidated RNA) in the form of a lyophilized bead within the
cartridge. Lysis of the viral particles with Lysis Reagent is followed by mixing with
Binding Reagent which allows capture of the nucleic acids on the cellulose column. The
column is then washed to remove contaminants and finally, the purified nucleic acids are
eluted with an elution reagent. The nucleic acid solution is mixed with dry rRT-PCR
reagents and transferred into the PCR tube for real-time RT-PCR and detection of Flu
RNA. The Xpert Flu Assay completes sample preparation and real-time RT-PCR in 75
minutes. Internal controls in the Xpert Flu Assay check key automated steps.

an=19 because repeat yielded indeterminate result.
bn=19 because one sample was indeterminate and not retested.
c9/55 samples negative for 2009 H1N1 resulted in a valid Flu A positive call, as the Flu A
signal was detected. A valid 2009 H1N1 positive call requires detection of both the Flu A and
2009 H1N1 signals.
An in-house reproducibility study was conducted to compare the performance of the
GeneXpert Dx and the Infinity instrument systems. A panel of 10 specimens with
varying concentrations of influenza A, influenza B, and influenza A subtype 2009 H1N1
were tested in duplicate on 12 different days by two operators. Each operator conducted
four runs of each panel specimen per day on each of the two instrument systems (10
specimens x 2 times/ day x 12 days x 2 operators x 2 instrument systems). One lot of
Xpert Flu Assay was used for the study. Xpert Flu Assays were performed according to
the Xpert Flu Assay procedure.

b. Linearity:
Linearity was evaluated using two seasonal influenza A H1N1 (Influenza A H1N1
(A/Taiwan/42/06), Influenza A H1N1 (A/Denver/1/57)), two seasonal influenza A H3N2
(Influenza A H3N2 (A/Brisbane/10/07), Influenza A H3N2 (A/Hong Kong/6/68)), two
influenza A 2009 H1N1 (Influenza A 2009 H1N1 (A/SwineNY/03/2009), Influenza A
2009 H1N1 (A/SwineCanada/6294/2009)) and two influenza B strains (Influenza B
(B/Panama/45/90) Influenza B (B/Florida/02/2006)) serially diluted over 4-5 logs and
processed using the Xpert Flu Assay. The range of analyte concentrations was tested
with four replicates at each concentration. Three external controls (two positive and 1
negative) was run with this study. Under the conditions of the study, the Xpert Flu Assay
responds linearly over 5 logs for seasonal influenza A H1N1, seasonal influenza A H3N2
and influenza A 2009 H1N1; and over 4 logs for influenza B strains tested. Of the 235
runs, 5 provided uninformative GeneXpert results (2 “ERROR” and 3 “INVALID”). The
2 “ERROR” tests were not repeated. The 3 “INVALID” tests were obtained with
samples spiked with very low concentrations of 2009 H1N1 virus. These samples were
reported “INVALID” because the test results were negative for influenza A and positive
for 2009 H1N1. All three external controls were correctly identified by the Xpert Flu
Assay.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Because each Xpert Flu cartridge is a self-contained unit test device, the use of external
controls has limited value in assuring proper device performance for any given assay.
Therefore, it was necessary to design the device to include internal controls that would
enable the system to detect specific failure modes that could potentially result in an
erroneous, but believable result. A Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis was
performed and periodically updated during the design and development phase, and key

failure modes were identified that might cause a false result. Control elements (probe
check control and sample processing control) were created to address major key failure
modes that could result in an unresolved or false negative determination, and for which
the probability of occurrence was remote or higher.
As a result, the Xpert Flu Assay includes a system control, referred to as the Probe Check
Control (PC), and an internal control, referred to as the Sample Processing Control
(SPC). The SPC is pre-loaded into the GeneXpert cartridge provided with the assay. An
additional control is the System Control Check for temperature. This check ensures that
the GeneXpert Dx Instrument is operating within validated heating and cooling
specifications.
The SPC is present to control for adequate processing of the target viruses and to monitor
the presence of inhibitors in the PCR reaction to reduce the possibility of false negative
results. The SPC also ensures the PCR reaction conditions (temperature and time) are
appropriate for the amplification reaction and that the PCR reagents are functional. The
Probe Check Control verifies bead reconstitution, PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe
integrity and dye stability.
External Controls may be used in accordance with local, state, or federal accrediting
organizations, as applicable. External Controls are not provided in the test kit; however
they are available for purchase from an outside source (ZeptoMetrix). The outside source
and the catalog numbers are provided to the customer in the ‘Materials Available but Not
Provided’ section of the Xpert Flu Assay Package Insert.
Probe Check Control (PC)
After sample preparation, bead reconstitution, and reaction tube filling, but prior to
thermal cycling, the GeneXpert Dx System is programmed to perform a probe check on
the amplification mixture. Fluorescence readings are obtained at two temperatures.
These readings are then compared to default settings established by Cepheid. The PC
controls for:
• Missing Enzyme Reagent (EZR) bead (contains polymerase, dNTPs, and 1
probe),
• Missing Target Specific Reagent (TSR) bead (contain all primers and 3
probes),
• Incomplete bead rehydration,
• Incomplete PCR reaction tube fill, and
• Probe degradation.
The PC is considered to PASS if the fluorescence generated meets the validated
acceptance criteria. If the PCC fails for any Influenza A, Influenza B or Influenza A
2009 H1N1 target or SPC, a probe check error is reported and the test will not continue.
For these conditions, the test will need to be repeated using a new specimen, a new
cartridge and new reagents.

Sample Processing Control (SPC)
The SPC is an encapsidated RNA pseudovirus that is provided in the form of a dry bead
and is included in each cartridge. The encapsidated RNA consists of a recombinant RNA
surrounded by the protein coat from MS2 virus and is designed to mimic the influenza
virus. The SPC is mixed with the sample to control for adequate sample processing and
to monitor the integrity of the RT-PCR assay. RT-PCR is performed to detect the
encapsidated RNA sequence. SPC is considered to “pass” if it meets the validated
acceptance criteria.
The SPC verifies (1) the effectiveness of each sample preparation step, (2) reaction tube
filling, (3) that reaction components are present and functioning, and monitors the
presence of potential inhibitor(s) in the PCR assay. This element controls for:
• Adequate specimen processing – sample lysis, capture and elution from
the cellulose column,
• Missing Target Specific Reagent (TSR) and/or Enzyme Specific Reagent
(EZR) beads,
• Incomplete bead rehydration,
• Incomplete PCR reaction tube fill,
• Appropriate PCR reaction conditions (time and temperature),
• Enzyme degradation, and
• Specimen inhibition of the PCR.
The controls in the Xpert Flu Assay both complement, but also provide a level of
redundancy which is important for a self-validating system. For example, by definition
the SPC will react to degradation of enzyme because SPC detection requires enzyme
activity. The SPC also reacts to sample effects. Both SPC and probe check are able to
respond to probe degradation.
d. Detection limit:
The LoD study was conducted to determine the lowest concentration of eleven (11)
influenza strains detected by the device. Each strain was diluted into a simulated
background matrix that consisted of 2.5% (w/v) porcine mucin, 1% (v/v) human whole
blood in 0.85% sodium chloride (NaCl) formulated in 1X PBS solution with 15%
glycerol diluted with UTM at a 1:6 ratio. Negative specimens consisted of simulated
background matrix only. Dilutions were prepared daily and kept on ice prior to testing.
Twenty (20) replicates for each dilution level were analyzed and the LoD demonstrated
to be the lowest concentration to yield 19/20 positive replicates.

e. Analytical specificity:
Inclusivity
This study was performed to evaluate a temporally and geographically diverse number of
clinically relevant virus strains for each claimed analyte at viral levels at or near the LoD.
All virus identities and titers were confirmed. Selections were made to represent the
analytes detected by the Xpert Flu Assay and reflect the strains recommended in the most
recent FDA guidance documents.
The analytical reactivity of the Xpert Flu Assay was evaluated against multiple strains of
influenza A (H1N1, H3N2, H5N2, H5N1 and H7N3 subtypes), influenza A 2009 H1N1
and influenza B. Thirty-nine (39) influenza strains were tested using the Xpert Flu Assay
(see Table 18.2). Of these, influenza A subtype H1N1 (12), influenza A subtype H3N2
(7), influenza A subtype 2009 H1N1 (6), influenza A subtype H5N1 (1), influenza A
subtype H5N2 (1), influenza A subtype H7N3 (1) and influenza B (11) were included.
Virus strains were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and ZeptoMetrix Corporation
(Buffalo, NY) and sent to Medical College of Wisconsin, Children’s Corporate Center
(Milwaukee, WI) for virus propagation and quantification.
All strains were tested in triplicate using cell stocks at 5 -500 TCID50/mL or PFU/mL.
Due to shipping and handling restrictions on viable viral particles, purified nucleic acids
were tested for three strains (influenza A subtypes H5N1, H5N2 and H7N3). Levels
tested represent concentrations at or near the Limit of Detection of the assay. For
positive samples the influenza virus strains were diluted into a simulated background

were prepared daily and kept on ice prior to testing.
The results of the analytical inclusivity study demonstrated that the Xpert Flu Assay
appropriately identifies all the influenza strains selected to represent the range of
respiratory viral strains that the Xpert Flu Assay has been designed to detect. The Xpert
Flu Assay correctly identified all 39 influenza strains; 22 as influenza A, 11 as influenza
B, and 6 as influenza A subtype 2009 H1N1. Of the 128 runs, 4 provided uninformative
GeneXpert results (“ERRORS”). All “ERRORs” were repeated for a total of 3 replicates
tested per strain. All three external controls were correctly identified by the Xpert Flu
Assay.

Exclusivity
The purpose of this study was to determine the analytical specificity (exclusivity) of the
Xpert Flu Assay. Forty (40) viral, bacterial or yeast strains phylogenetically related to
influenza virus or potentially present in nasopharyngeal flora were tested using the Xpert
Flu Assay following the recommendations in the recent FDA guidance documents. The
strains were diluted into a simulated background matrix. Negative specimens consisted of
simulated background matrix only. Dilutions were prepared daily and kept on ice prior to
testing.
Of the 40 strains tested, 18 were viruses, 21 were bacterial strains and 1 was yeast.
Twenty (20) bacterial strains and one (1) yeast strain were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured at Cepheid. One (1) bacterial strain was
obtained from Dr. David Alland’s laboratory, University of Medicine and Dentistry of
New Jersey. Virus strains were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and ZeptoMetrix
Corporation (Buffalo, NY) and sent to Medical College of Wisconsin, Children’s
Corporate Center (Milwaukee, WI) for virus propagation and quantification.
Bacterial stock cultures were prepared by suspending the bacterial growth from an agar
plate in PBS buffer containing 15% glycerol. Viral stock cultures were propagated using
recommended tissue culture cell lines and hemagglutinin assays were used to establish
titers. All bacterial strains were tested in triplicate at concentrations ≥106 CFU/mL. All
viral strains were tested in triplicate at concentrations ≥104 TCID50/mL. Purified nucleic
acids were tested at a concentration of 1x106 genomic copies/mL for two bacterial strains
(Bordetella pertussis and Haemophilus influenzae) and one virus strain
(Cytomegalovirus).
Under the conditions of this study, the analytical specificity of the Xpert Flu Assay is
100%. None of the non-influenza isolates tested was detected by the Xpert Flu Assay as
expected. All isolates were reported as “Flu A NEGATIVE; 2009 H1N1 NOT
DETECTED; Flu B NEGATIVE”. These results demonstrate that a sample containing
non-influenza isolates (>1x106 CFU/mL or ≥104 TCID50/mL or 106 genomic copies/mL)
will not falsely trigger a positive influenza test result using the Xpert Flu Assay. Of the
120 runs, 1 provided an uninformative GeneXpert result (“ERROR”). This sample was
repeated for a total of 3 replicates tested per strain. All three external controls were
correctly identified by the Xpert Flu Assay.

Lot specific assay settings are generated for every lot manufactured to account for
variations in reagent production. The lot specific assay settings (LSP file) are
incorporated into the barcode on each cartridge label and are transferred to the GeneXpert
instrument systems via a barcode scanner prior to initiating the Xpert Flu Assay. General

is 12 because in practice, a Ct cannot be calculated before the end of the minimum
background subtraction range, which is 10 cycles. The earliest Flu A Ct, 2009 H1N1 and
Flu B reported in true influenza A positive, 2009 H1N1 positive and influenza B positive
results during pre-clinical testing was greater than 12. The valid maximum cycle
threshold setting for influenza A, 2009 H1N1, and influenza B is 40.0.
To obtain a valid influenza A Positive test result, the Flu A Ct must be reported within
the valid cycle range. To obtain a valid 2009 H1N1 Positive test result, both Flu A and
2009 H1N1 Cts must be reported within the valid cycle range and the fluorescent signal
must cross the manual threshold fluorescence units. To obtain a valid influenza B
Positive test result, the Flu B Ct must be reported within the valid cycle range and the Flu
B fluorescent signal must cross the manual threshold fluorescence units.
To obtain a valid influenza A, influenza A 2009 H1N1 or influenza B Negative test
result, the Flu A, 2009 H1N1, and Flu B Cts must not be reported within the valid cycle
range and the SPC Ct must be reported within its valid cycle range. If the SPC falls
outside the valid cycle range, the test result is “INVALID” and must be repeated. The
valid maximum cycle threshold setting for the SPC in Xpert Flu Assay was set at 40
based on the pre-clinical data. Subsequently, true negative samples from interfering
substances study (n=121) and LSP testing (n=218) were analyzed to support the valid
maximum cycle threshold setting of 40.

determine the effect on the performance of the sample processing control (SPC).
Influenza-positive samples (n=8) were tested for each substance spiked with two seasonal
influenza A H1N1 strains, two seasonal influenza A H3N2 strains, two influenza A 2009
H1N1 strains and two influenza B strains spiked near the analytical LoD determined for
each isolate. Statistical significance for both positive and negative samples was
determined by comparing cycle threshold (Ct) values between samples run in the
presence of the interfering substance and controls run in UTM.
Highly viscous samples, resulting from the addition of 1.5% (w/v) and 2.5% (w/v)
porcine mucin yielded false-negative test results from the Xpert Flu Assay. Inhibition of
the Xpert Flu Assay was also observed from the addition of 1% (w/v) porcine mucin,
resulting in delayed detection of influenza A, influenza A subtype 2009 H1N1, and
influenza B. The effects of mucin are addressed in the Limitations Section of the
Package Insert.
h. Fresh vs. Frozen Equivalency Study
This study was performed with contrived positive and negative specimens. Contrived
positive specimens consisted of cultured viral targets diluted into a simulated background
matrix. Contrived negative specimens consisted of simulated background matrix only.
The positive specimens in the study consisted of one cultured viral strain for each of the
three targets in the assay (seasonal influenza A strain, influenza A 2009 H1N1 strain and
influenza B strain). Each viral target was tested at three different concentrations
representing a low positive (2X LoD), a medium positive (5X LoD) and a high positive
(10X LoD) specimen. Replicates of 20 were tested per target per concentration. All
replicate contrived specimens were tested fresh, after 1 freeze-thaw cycle and after 2
freeze-thaw cycles. Replicates of 20 negative samples were also tested per condition
(fresh, one (1) freeze-thaw and two (2) freeze-thaws).
All positive replicates were identified correctly with a mean Ct of 5 or more standard
deviations earlier than the assay cut-off of 40. All negative replicates were identified
correctly with a mean SPC Ct of 5 or more standard deviations earlier than the assay cut-
off of 40. There was no statistically significant difference between fresh specimens and
specimens tested after two sequential freeze thaw cycles for influenza A 2009 H1N1 and
influenza B. Although there were statistically significant differences for the seasonal
influenza A strain, these differences were small (less than 0.5 Ct) and were not of
practical significance since the virus was accurately detected in all 20 replicates at the
lowest concentration (2X LOD). Influenza B strain demonstrated a statistically
significant difference with the first freeze-thaw cycle. The increase in Flu B Ct was small
(less than 0.2 Ct) and not of practical significance.
Of the 692 runs, 19 samples provided uninformative GeneXpert result (“ERROR”). All
“ERROR” tests were repeated such that there were a total of 20 replicates per condition.
All three external controls were correctly identified by the Xpert Flu Assay.

Not Applicable
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
Performance characteristics of the Xpert Flu Assay on prospective and archived
specimens were evaluated at six institutions in the U.S. and Australia. Due to the low
prevalence of influenza viruses and the difficulty in obtaining fresh influenza-positive
specimens, the prospective specimen population for this study was supplemented with
frozen archived specimens.
Subjects included individuals whose routine care called for collection of NA/W or NP
swab specimens for influenza testing. For eligible subjects, aliquots of leftover sample
were obtained for testing with the Xpert Flu Assay and reference testing, and patient
management continued at the site per the standard practice.
The Xpert Flu Assay performance was compared to viral culture followed by direct
fluorescent assay (DFA). Sequencing was performed for all influenza A positive
specimens. For archived specimens, where viral culture was not performed prior to
freezing a FDA cleared molecular assay was performed as the comparator assay.
Samples included nasal NA/W and NP swab specimens collected for routine testing from
patients suspected of influenza infection.
Overall Results
Prospective Specimens
A total of 342 prospective NA/W specimens were tested for influenza A, influenza A
subtype 2009 H1N1 and influenza B by the Xpert Flu Assay and viral culture plus DFA.
A total of 297 prospectively collected NP swab specimens were tested for influenza A,
influenza A subtype 2009 H1N1 and influenza B by the Xpert Flu Assay and viral culture
plus DFA. All influenza A positive specimens, indentified by viral culture/DFA, were
sequenced to differentiate influenza A subtype 2009 H1N1 from other influenza A
subtypes
On fresh, prospective NA/W specimens, the Xpert Flu Assay demonstrated a sensitivity
and specificity for detection of influenza A of 85.7% and 99.1%, respectively, relative to
viral culture plus DFA, with sequence confirmation of all influenza A positive viral
isolates, or specimens in transport medium if isolates were not available. The Xpert Flu
Assay sensitivity and specificity for influenza A subtype 2009 H1N1 with NA/W
specimens were 100% and 98.8%, respectively. The Xpert Flu Assay sensitivity and
27

Archived Specimens
A total of 425 archived NA/W specimens were tested for influenza A, influenza A
subtype 2009 H1N1 and influenza B by the Xpert Flu Assay and a FDA cleared
molecular assay. A total of 150 archived NP swab specimens were tested for influenza
A, influenza A subtype 2009 H1N1 and influenza B by the Xpert Flu Assay and viral
culture plus DFA; 177 archived NP swab specimens did not have viral culture results
available and were tested by the FDA cleared molecular comparator assay. All influenza
A positive specimens indentified by viral culture/DFA or the FDA cleared molecular
comparator assay were sequenced to differentiate influenza A subtype 2009 H1N1 from

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not Applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
In the prospective Cepheid Xpert Flu clinical study there was a total of 649 samples
collected. A total of 342 prospective NA/W specimens were tested for influenza A,
influenza A subtype 2009 H1N1 and influenza B by the Xpert Flu Assay and viral culture
plus DFA. A total of 297 prospectively collected NP swab specimens were tested for
influenza A, influenza A subtype 2009 H1N1 and influenza B by the Xpert Flu Assay and
viral culture plus DFA. These samples were collected during the 2010 influenza season
at three clinical laboratories in Australia from August through October of 2010 and from
a U.S. clinical site from May to mid-August. The age demographics for the prospectively
collected samples are as follows:

The number and percentage of Influenza A, A/2009 H1N1, and Influenza B positive
cases prospectively collected as determined positive by the Xpert Flu Assay are: For
NA/W prospective samples Influenza A is 2.6% (9/342), A/2009 H1N1 is 2.3% (8/342),
and Influenza B is 2.6% (9/342). For NS prospective samples Influenza A is 4.0%
(12/297), A/2009 H1N1 is 2.7% (8/297), and influenza B is 2.7% (8/297).
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
