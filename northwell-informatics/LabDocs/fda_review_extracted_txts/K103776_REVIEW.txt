The xTAG® Respiratory Viral Panel Fast (RVP FAST) is a qualitative nucleic acid
multiplex test intended for the simultaneous detection and identification of multiple
respiratory virus nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal swabs from individuals suspected of
respiratory tract infections. The following virus types and subtypes are identified using
RVP FAST: Influenza A, Influenza A subtype H1, Influenza A subtype H3, Influenza B,
Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Human Metapneumovirus, Rhinovirus, and Adenovirus. The
detection and identification of specific viral nucleic acids from individuals exhibiting
signs and symptoms of respiratory infection aids in the diagnosis of respiratory viral
infection if used in conjunction with other clinical and epidemiological information.
Negative results do not preclude respiratory viral infection and should not be used as the
sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other management decisions. Positive results do not
rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other organisms. The agent detected may
not be the definite cause of disease. The use of additional laboratory testing (e.g.,
bacterial and viral culture, immunofluorescence, and radiography) and clinical
presentation must be taken into consideration in order to obtain the final diagnosis of
respiratory infection.
Due to the genetic similarity between human rhinovirus and enterovirus, the RVP FAST
primers for detection of rhinovirus cross-react with enterovirus. A rhinovirus reactive
result should be confirmed by an alternate method (e.g., cell culture).
Performance characteristics for Influenza A Virus were established when Influenza A/H3
and A/H1 were the predominant Influenza A viruses in circulation. When other Influenza
A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary. If infections with a novel
Influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening
criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens should be collected with
appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent Influenza viruses and sent to a
state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these
cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.
2. Indication for Use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

L. Test Principle:
RVP FAST incorporates multiplex Reverse-Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-
PCR) with Luminex’s Universal Tag sorting system on the Luminex® platform. The assay
also detects an internal control (E. coli phage MS2) which should be added to each sample
prior to extraction, and a run control (bacteriophage Lambda DNA) which should be added
as a separate RT-PCR reaction in each run performed.
For each sample, viral extract (RNA or DNA) is amplified in a single multiplex RT-PCR
reaction. For each of the viruses/subtypes or internal control present in the sample, PCR
amplimers are produced. The RT-PCR product is then added to a hybridization/detection
reaction containing the universal bead array and the Streptavidin-R-Phycoerythrin reporter.
Each Luminex bead population detects a specific viral target or assay control through a
highly specific anti-tag/tag hybridization. Following the incubation of the RT-PCR products
with the bead mix and reporter, the hybridization/detection reactions are sorted and
fluorescent signal is captured on the Luminex instrument. These fluorescence values (median
fluorescence intensity, MFI) generated for each bead population are analyzed to establish the
presence or absence of viral targets and/or controls in each sample tested. The data generated
by the xMAP instrument is analyzed by the xTAG Data Analysis Software RVP Fast (TDAS
RVP FAST) to provide a qualitative summary report on which viruses are present in the
sample, if any.

Interpretation of Results
Each sample includes an individual column for each viral target, the internal control
(bacteriophage MS2) and the run control (bacteriophage Lambda). Additionally,
characterized positive controls and a negative control (RNase-free water) should be included
with each run.
Control Calls (Internal and Run Control)
• PRES - the recommended Internal / Run Control is detected (MFI ≥ 800)
• ABS - the recommended Internal / Run Control is not detected (MFI < 800)
• No Call - unable to determine presence or absence of the Internal / Run Control due to an
assay-specific criterion not being met (see Tables 6-7 for re-test recommendations).
Note: TDAS RVP FAST (US) uses notes in the Notes column and the
Warnings/Errors section of the data file to determine whether there was a
problem during reading. TDAS RVP FAST (US) does not interpret the data if the
system gives a “Sample Empty” or ”User cancel” in the Notes column, or reports
an error status for a sample. DO NOT EDIT the Luminex data file at any time or
TDAS RVP FAST (US) cannot correctly interpret the data.
External Controls (Negative and Positive Controls)
At least one negative control should be included in the run. The software considers the last
sample on the plate to be the external negative control. If the external negative control fails,
then a message appears and the plate fails (see Table 7 for Re-Run recommendations).
Characterized external positive controls should be included in the run. If a given analyte
positive control does not perform as expected, all results for that analyte in the batch of
samples are invalid and samples should be re-run (see Table 7 for Re-Run
recommendations).
Viral Target (Sample) Calls (except Influenza A)
• POS - the viral target is detected. The positive thresholds for each target are provided
below:
• Influenza B (MFI ≥ 400)
• RSV-probe 1 (MFI ≥ 120) or RSV-probe 2 (MFI ≥ 150)
• Rhinovirus (MFI ≥ 300)
• Human Metapneumovirus (MFI ≥ 200)
• Adenovirus (MFI ≥ 150)
• NEG - the viral target is not detected. The negative thresholds for each target is provided
below:
• Influenza B (MFI < 400)
• RSV-probe 1 (MFI < 120) and RSV-probe 2 (MFI < 150)
• Rhinovirus (MFI < 300)
8

--- Page 9 ---
• Human Metapneumovirus (MFI < 200)
• Adenovirus (MFI < 150)
• No Call - invalid result due to a failure in one or more assay parameters / controls (refer
to Tables 6-7 for re-test recommendations)
Influenza A (Sample) Calls
• The viral target is detected. The positive thresholds are provided below:
• H1 D - the Influenza A H1 subtype (seasonal H1) (MFI ≥ 450) and the Influenza
A matrix gene are detected
(MFI ≥ 300)
• H3 D - the Influenza A H3 subtype (MFI ≥ 200) and the Influenza A matrix gene
are detected (MFI ≥ 300)
• H1, H3 D - the Influenza A H1 (seasonal H1), the H3 (seasonal H3) subtypes and
the Influenza A matrix gene are detected
• Ut D - the Influenza A matrix gene is detected and both the H1 and H3 subtypes
are not detected. NOTE: please refer to. Influenza A precautions listed below).
• NEG - the viral target is not detected and all thresholds must be negative. The negative
thresholds are provided below:
• Flu A matrix (MFI < 300)
• H1 (MFI < 450)
• H3 (MFI < 200)
• No Call - an invalid result due to a failure in one or more assay parameters / controls (see
re-test recommendations below Tables 6-7)
It is recommended that the sample be re-tested once according to the instructions
provided in Table 6 and 7. If a re-test needs to be carried out due to an invalid result
producing a "No Call" for a sample or target, the re-test results should be considered the
final result for that sample or target. For analytes other than influenza, if the final RVP
FAST result is a "No Call" then follow-up testing is recommended. For detection of
Influenza A H1 and H3 subtypes, specific precautions listed below must be followed:
o Unsubtypeable (i.e., Influenza A matrix gene is detected), but not for H1 and H3
Subtype: If RVP FAST positively identifies the Flu A matrix gene target but fails to
identify a hemagglutinin gene target (H1 or H3), retest the sample with RVP FAST from
the extraction step with external controls for these two analytes. Run sample extract in
duplicate. If the re-test on both replicates does not yield a positive result for H1 or H3 and
external controls are properly typed, follow up with appropriate public health authorities
to determine whether the unsubtypeable Flu A specimen represents a novel strain of
Influenza A.
o If infections with a novel Influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent
Influenza viruses and sent to a state or local health department for testing. Viral culture
9

--- Page 10 ---
should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and
culture specimens.
o The performance of influenza B may vary depending on whether sequence variants that
could potentially affect primer binding are present among the circulating influenza B
viruses (Pabbaraju et al. 2011).
o Scientific literature reports that some E. coli strains may be infected with
lambdoid phages in the wild resulting in a risk of a 'present' call for the lambda
bead in a patient sample containing a strain of E. coli infected with lambda phage.
This does not alter the ability of RVP FAST to detect the other viral targets.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was assessed by using simulated samples with viral loads generating
MFI signals bracketing the cut-off for positive calls (from both below and above).
Simulated samples were prepared by spiking cultured viruses into Universal
Transport Medium (UTM). The study was conducted at three independent sites by
two operators at each site. Each operator conducted five separate runs with each
sample in triplicates (starting from EasyMag nucleic acids extraction) on non-
consecutive days. Thus, there were a total of 90 replicates for each sample: (3 sites) x
(2 operators/site) x (5 xTAG runs/operator) x 3 replicates.
Each of the following viral analyte targets were examined in the form of simulated
sample arranged in a dilution series: Flu A (matrix gene), Flu A (hemagglutinin H1),
Flu A (hemagglutinin H3), Flu B, RSV A, RSV B, hMPV, Adenovirus, and
Rhinovirus. Each target was assessed at three dilution levels: High Negative (HN),
Low Positive (LP), and Moderate Positive (MP). RVP FAST calls (Positive and

The reproducibility study was designed to examine maximum variability of the entire
assay system – the xTAG® RVP FAST assay as well as the bioMerieux NucliSENS®
EasyMag extraction method. As with any nucleic acid extraction method, the bioMerieux
NucliSENS® EasyMag exhibits within run and between runs variability and contributes
to the total variability of the assay. Therefore, the observed variability in this
reproducibility study is partially attributable to nucleic acid extraction.
Site-to-site reproducibility for dual-analyte targets was investigated at three independent
sites. Each site employed two operators and one or two Luminex instruments. Each
operator conducted 5 separate extractions using Biomerieux NucliSENS® EasyMag

Four different clinically relevant co-infections were represented by the dual-analyte
samples. The dual-analyte samples were prepared using a “Low” concentration of one
virus expected in a clinically relevant co-infection, and a “High” concentration of the
other virus, and vice-versa, to create eight dual-analyte samples in UTM (Universal
Transport Medium) matrix. “Low” concentration sample - a titer that generates an MFI
value above the cutoff in an estimated 95% of replicates, and an MFI value below the
cutoff in an estimated 5% of replicates.
“High” concentration sample - a titer that is expected to yield MFI values approaching
the plateau. Results of the dual analyte testing are summarized in Tables 17 – 20.

Data generated form the reproducibility studies suggest that there are no significant
differences in calls generated from dual-analyte samples between operators, instruments,
sites or days. All High concentration dilutions in the dual-analyte combinations made a
POS call by RVP FAST. False negative results for RSV low-titer infections may be
observed in samples when in the presence of high concentrations of other analytes (co-
infected samples). Clinically, when a dual infection is encountered, the low titer virus
may be from an infection that has already passed or from a new infection.
Precision (Repeatability)
The repeatability of the RSV FAST Assay was evaluated by repeated testing of twenty
(20) replicates of each analyte at LoD concentration after extraction with the
Biomérieux NucliSENS® EasyMag system in a single run. The viral strains and the
concentrated viral stock solution (termed as the initial stock) used in the study are
shown in Table 21. Since there are two separate probes for the analyte RSV, two
samples (RSV A for probe 1 and RSV B for probe 2) were used to assess repeatability
for RSV. Repeatability of the Flu A analyte was examined twice since both the Flu A
H1 and Flu A H3 viral samples also contain the Flu A matrix target.

Repeatability was assessed by confirming that the sample was consistently called across
all replicates. The coefficient of variation (Standard Deviation / Mean) of the MFI
values was also calculated for the 20 replicates. xTAG RVP FAST is a qualitative assay
that has an underlying numeric output. As a qualitative assay based on end-point PCR,
the distribution of the MFI values for each sample used in this repeatability study may
show considerable variability. The repeatability study results are presented in Tables
22-23

Assay Controls
An internal control Bacteriophage MS2 is included in the RVP FAST assay. This
internal positive control is added to each patient specimen and each external control
prior to extraction and serves to monitor the extraction and reverse-transcription steps.
Failure to generate a PRES (present) call for the MS2 control indicates a failure at
either the extraction step or reverse-transcription step, and may be indicative of the
presence of amplification inhibitors which could lead to false negative results. A
positive result (PRES) indicates that the extraction and amplification steps are
functioning properly.
Bacteriophage lambda DNA included in RVP FAST assay kit is the run control is used
to monitor the entire assay. For each run, the control is included as a separate sample
during the RT-PCR set-up. The run control is an analyte recognized by the TDAS RVP
FAST (US) that is distinct from the viral analytes the assay is intended to detect.
These external positive controls for target analytes are not provided with the kit but
should be included with each batch of patient specimens. External controls should be
prepared, extracted and tested in the same manner as patient samples. If a given analyte
positive control does not perform as expected, all results for that analyte in the batch of
samples are invalid and samples should be re-run.
The sponsor is also recommending including at least one negative control with each run
of RVP FAST. By default, TDAS RVP FAST (US) considers the last sample on the
plate to be the primary negative control. Multiple negative controls should be
interspersed throughout the plate (e.g., the beginning, middle, and end).
Specimen Stability
An analytical study was performed to establish the storage conditions for
nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens tested using the RVP FAST assay. The
performance of RVP FAST was evaluated using a set of clinical specimens that were
tested following their extraction from the fresh state or after freezing at -70°C for a
prolonged period of time. A total of 142 nasopharyngeal swabs, after initial testing,
were stored frozen at -70°C for up to 20 months then thawed and extracted using the
Biomerieux EasyMag extraction method. The nucleic acid was stored frozen at -70°C
prior to testing with RVP FAST. Testing was performed in the presence of external
positive pooled controls (representing analytes probed by RVP FAST). Results from all
142 specimens that were tested in these experiments are summarized in Tables 24-25

70°C does not affect the accuracy of test results compared to freshly collected or
freshly prepared samples. The “fresh vs. frozen” study evaluated the performance of
xTAG® RVP FAST on a set of clinical specimens (nasopharyngeal swabs) that were
tested following their extraction from the fresh state or thawed state (i.e. after freezing
at -70°C for a short period of time). A total of 202 nasopharyngeal swabs (NP swabs)
were prospectively collected from symptomatic pediatric and adult subjects. Upon
receipt at the virology laboratory, each specimen was split into 2 aliquots: (1) the first
aliquot was extracted from the fresh state using the Biomerieux EasyMag extraction
method and the nucleic acid stored frozen at -70°C; (2) the second aliquot was stored
frozen at -70°C in its un-extracted state. Upon accrual of approximately 40 prospective
clinical specimens, frozen aliquots of the original specimens were thawed and extracted
using the Biomerieux EasyMag extraction method. The nucleic acid was stored frozen
at -70°C. Extracts from both fresh and frozen specimens (batches of approx 40
specimens, both fresh and frozen) were then thawed and tested in the same run by RVP
FAST in the presence of external positive pooled controls (representing analytes probed
by RVP FAST). Twenty three (23) specimens and their corresponding calls were
excluded from the analysis due to failure of the internal control when tested from the
fresh state. One (1) additional specimen was excluded from the analysis due to failure
of the internal control when tested from the frozen state. Results from the remaining
178 specimens that were analyzed (fresh and frozen) are summarized in Tables 26 and

of Table 28. Serial dilutions of the viral analyte targets were prepared from a
high titer stock in Universal Transport Medium (UTM) for the following
analytes: Flu A (hemagglutinin H1), Flu A (hemagglutinin H3), Flu B,
Adenovirus, RSV A, RSV B, Rhinovirus and hMPV subtypes A1, A2, B1 and
B2. Serial dilutions were prepared from concentrated viral stocks in UTM.
In the first part of this study, serial dilution curves for the Flu A H1, Flu A H3,
Flu B, Adenovirus, RSV-A, RSV-B, Rhinovirus and hMPV subtypes A1, A2,
B1 and B2 were obtained. These curves were generated by assessing 3 to 4
replicates of each dilution level starting from the sample extraction step with the
xTAG RVP FAST assay. a dilution or dilutions for each target were selected for
further confirmation testing. Confirmation of LoD for each target was achieved
through testing of 20 replicates of the selected dilutions starting from sample
extraction. In general, the dilution level corresponding to the lowest
concentration of the analyte for which 3/3 (or 4/4) replicates generated positive
calls by xTAG RVP assay was selected for LoD confirmation testing. LoD was
considered as confirmed if the selected dilution level gave positive calls for
≥19/20 of the replicates.

viral stock was intended to cover the detection range of the assay including viral
loads at or near the limit of detection (LoD). All 10-fold dilution levels of a given
viral strain were tested in a single run with the RVP FAST assay, together with
the controls (DNAse-free and RNAse free water, lambda DNA, and MS2
bacteriophage) as recommended in the package insert. In the event that the MFI
generated for a particular organism in the initial 10-fold dilution series fell well
above or below the assay cut-off, then additional dilutions were generated and
tested with RVP FAST. The starting concentration and dilution factor of each
successive dilution was determined upon review of the initial 10-fold dilution
series
To supplement the known cultured isolate strains tested, sequencing data was
generated from clinical specimens that tested positive by RVP FAST for Flu A
H1, Flu A H3, RSV, Rhinovirus or hMPV, to verify that the ‘positive’ call by the
assay concurred with a ‘positive’ sequence in the sample.
Summary tables of Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity) Testing with the RVP
FAST Assay are presented below in Tables 29 – 36.
RVP FAST inclusivity testing showed broad coverage of influenza A subtypes. In
addition, phylogenetic analysis of sequencing data from positive clinical samples show
that all of the Flu A H1 sequences are closely related to A/Brisbane/59/2007, the
reference strain recommended by WHO for inclusion in the 2009-2010 trivalent
vaccine for the Northern Hemisphere. The A/Brisbane/59/2007 was the predominant
Flu A H1N1 strain in human circulation, just before the outbreak of the 2009 pandemic.
Most of the Flu A H3 sequences obtained from positive clinical samples were closely
related to either A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2) or A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) reference
strains which were the strains recommended by WHO for inclusion in the 2009-2010
influenza virus trivalent vaccine for the Northern and Southern hemispheres,
respectively.

A total of 20 adenovirus serotypes were empirically tested with RVP FAST assay. The
RVP FAST assay was able to detect a broad coverage of Adenoviruses including
representatives of all 6 species (A-F).
In addition to this empirical data, 4 additional hMPV strains representing groups A1, A2,
B1 and B2 were tested as part of the LoD study. All four phylogenetic groups of human
Metapneumovirus (hMPV) were detected by RVP FAST (A1, A2, B1, B2).

f. Analytical Specificity/Cross-reactivity Evaluation:
An analytical exclusivity study was carried out to assess the potential for false positive
results due to cross-reactivity between RVP FAST assays and other common respiratory
tract pathogens that are not probed by the RVP FAST assay. A total of 30 potentially
cross-reactive pathogens (Table 37) were assessed with RVP FAST. Each replicate
underwent a single EasyMag (bioMerieux NucliSENS®) extraction prior to testing.
Potentially cross-reactive viruses were prepared by growing each virus in the appropriate
5 5
cell host, to a high titer of ~10 pfu/mL (≈10 TCID /mL). Potentially cross-reactive
50
bacteria were prepared at a turbidity corresponding to a 1/100 dilution of a 0.5 McFarland
6
Standard (approximately 1x10 cfu/mL). In all cases, UTM-RT medium (universal
transport media; Copan, reference number 330C) was used as a matrix.

Analysis of the pathogens listed in Table 37 showed no cross-reactivity with any viral
target probed by RVP FAST. The E. coli stock tested yielded a “present” call for the run
control (bacteriophage lambda), as expected. Contamination of some E. coli strains with
lambdoid phages is a known phenomenon in the natural ecology of E. coli in the wild
thus yielding a “Present” call for the lambda run control (Krylog & Tsygankov 1976;
Dhillon et al. 1980; Kameyama et al. 1999).
Cross-Reactivity with Enterovirus
Rhinoviruses and Enteroviruses are closely-related genera of the Picornaviridae family,
small, non-enveloped ssRNA positive-strand viruses. Potential cross-reactivity with
Entorovirus was assessed using cultured isolates. A list of the Enterovirus strains tested is
presented in Table 38 below.

All cultured isolates tested generated a positive call for Rhinovirus by RVP FAST
suggesting that Enterovirus cross-reacts with Rhinovirus-specific primers in the RVP
FAST assay.
Cross-Reactivity with Coronaviruses
Potential cross-reactivity with coronaviruses (HKU1, NL63 and OC43) was examined
using clinical specimens that tested positive by a real-time PCR assay (N=9). No cross
reactivity with viral targets probed by RVP FAST were reported in these samples.
g. Assay cut-off:
Assay cut-off determination (threshold-setting algorithm) consists of three steps for each
analyte: 1) setting an initial cut-off range using a validated computer algorithm, 2)
recommending optimized cut-offs within this range based on ROC analysis of empirical
data, and 3) establishing an MFI cut-off value through a Design Review Committee
(DRC) assessment of ROC curves. DRC assessments are carried out in accordance with
internal procedures that are part of the Design Control sub-system of the LMD Quality
System.
Distinct sample sets were used for setting initial cut-offs (step 1 above) and for finding
the optimized cut-offs (step 2 above). Clinical specimens used in these two cut-off
determination steps were assigned a “positive” or “negative” call for the analyte in
question based on results obtained at the clinical site. These results were based on the
routine diagnostic algorithm at the collection site and generated either by DSFA, culture
followed by DFA, the 510k cleared xTAG RVP assay (k063765) or a lab-developed real-
time RT-PCR assay. The sample set used in these 2 cut-off determination steps also
included cultured isolates with confirmed viral identity which were serially diluted into
universal transport media (UTM). Finally, the sample set was supplemented with
extraction controls (UTM spiked with MS2) that were coded as negative for all viral
targets. All samples were extracted using the Biomerieux EasyMag method prior to being
tested with RVP FAST.
For each analyte, ten (10) alternative cut-off values within the initial cut-off range were
assessed using ROC analysis of the optimization data set. The positive and negative
agreements (with their corresponding lower bound 95% confidence interval) between
xTAG® RVP FAST and the expected call were used to select optimal cut-offs for each
analyte. Table 39 below lists the optimal MFI cut-off ranges generated for each analyte
using the following acceptance criteria as a guide:
≥90% positive agreement with lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI ≥ 80%
≥90% negative agreement with lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI ≥ 90%

A design review committee (DRC) selected the final cut-offs. Final cut-offs fell within
the optimized threshold range (Table 40) for all analytes with the exception of
Adenovirus. For this target, a final cut-off value of 150 MFI was selected as most of the
optimization samples that were not detected by the assay had high Ct values (>35) and
were co-infected with multiple targets.

h. Interfering Substances:
An interference study was carried out to evaluate the influence of potential interfering
substances on the accuracy of test results obtained with the RVP FAST. A total of 14
combinations of analyte and potential interferents (Table 41) were assessed with RVP
FAST. Each replicate was extracted using the EasyMag method. Potentially interfering
pathogens were assayed in the presence of RVP FAST targets. The RVP FAST targets
were prepared at 4-10x the limit of detection for that analyte. Potential viral interferents
were spiked in at titers of ~ 105 pfu/mL (≈ 105 TCID /mL) and potential bacterial
50
interferents were spiked in at titers of ~ 1x106 cfu/mL (by turbidity measurement, against
the McFarland Standard).

Common Medications
Clinically significant interference by medications would result in lower RVP FAST
detection rates in specimens obtained from medicated patients compared with non-
medicated patients. Analysis of the clinical data set shows that no significant differences
in the sensitivity of RVP FAST targets were observed between medicated patients and
unmedicated patients. RVP FAST correctly identified 217/229 (94.75%) of the targets
probed by the assay in the population receiving medications and 106/110 (96.36%) in the
population not receiving medications. This suggests that commonly prescribed
medications in the intended use population do not interfere with RVP FAST assay results.
A complete list of medications recorded in patients charts extracted for the clinical
dataset is presented in Table 42 below.

i. Carry-Over Contamination:
The carry-over study was conducted using water blanks (DNase and RNase free distilled
water) alternating with replicates of a high titre purified viral nucleic acid sample in a
checkerboard pattern. RSV B nucleic acid (Wash/18537/62DHI 20-4730010; original
ATCC VR-1401) was prepared at a high titer far above the assay cut-off, in order to
obtain positive calls 100% of the time and maximize the potential for cross
contamination. RSV B was chosen as the analyte, since it is commonly observed in
clinical specimens at high titre (Chidgey and Broadley, 2005). This study consisted of six
identical runs tested over six different days each performed by one operator, using a
single kit lot and equipment set. The mean MFI of the RSV B replicates was 10,860. No
carryover contamination with RSV B was observed, as the MFI values obtained in the
blank positions was not significantly greater than the LoB any blank position on the
checkerboard plate layout.

Prospective Clinical Study
The clinical performance of the RVP FAST assay was evaluated during prospective studies
at three clinical laboratories; two of the laboratories were in Southern Ontario (Canada) and
one in New York (US). A total of 1191 nasopharyngeal swabs clinical specimens were
collected from pediatric and adult patients. Of these 1191 specimens, 633 were prospectively
collected during the 2007/2008 and 558 in the 2008/2009 influenza seasons (prospective data
set). An additional 34 specimens were pre-selected for adenovirus (pre-selected data set). Of
the 1191 prospectively collected clinical specimens, 178 were tested by RVP FAST from the
“fresh” state and 1013 were tested from the “frozen” state. All 34 pre-selected adenovirus
positive clinical specimens were tested by RVP FAST from the “frozen” state.
The study sites enrolled subjects from diverse demographic groups. Data summery of
demographic information for the 1191 subjects that participated in the prospective study is
presented in Table 43 below.

For Influenza A, Influenza B, RSV and Adenovirus, all specimens were assessed from the
fresh state at each site by cleared Direct Specimen Fluorescent Antibody (DSFA) tests and/or
culture followed by DFA. If DSFA or culture followed by DFA was positive, then the
specimen was coded as positive by comparator. Comparator testing for these analytes was
carried out at the clinical site processing the test requisition for that patient sample.
For subtypes of Influenza A, well-characterized RT-PCR amplification followed by bi-
directional sequencing was performed on frozen extracts of all DSFA or culture followed by
DFA positive specimens. Amplification primers used for Influenza A subtyping targeted
different genomic regions from the ones probed by RVP FAST.
For rhinovirus and hMPV, a composite reference method (a predetermined algorithm that
combines results of more than one test) was used as comparator. This method consisted of 2
separate, well-characterized nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) followed by bi-
directional sequencing. To the extent possible, the NAATs used in the composite reference
method targeted different genomic regions from the ones probed by RVP FAST. If at least
one of the two NAATs was positive by bi-directional sequencing, the specimen was
considered to be positive by comparator. If both NAATs were negative by bi-directional
sequencing, then the specimen was coded as negative by comparator. C

Nucleic acid testing (NAATs), including RVP FAST, was performed on left-over specimen
that had been extracted from the fresh or frozen state. Total extracted nucleic acid material
was stored at -70°C prior to testing. A total of 30 specimens were rerun by RVP FAST. Of
these, 1 was due to internal control failure (“Sample failed: unexpected control call(s)”); 23
were due to indeterminate Flu A H1 or H3, defined as POS call for H1 or H3 hemagglutinin
gene in the absence of a POS call for the matrix gene ("Target failed: incompatible signals
between targets"); 2 were due to Flu A unsubtypeable results (“Warning: Influenza A
detected but subtype could not be determined. Refer to Kit Package insert for further
instructions”) and 4 specimens were due low bead count results in the primary negative
control (“Assay failed: low bead count(s) for the primary negative control sample”).
Diagnostic sensitivity (and specificity) of RVP FAST was established by determining the
fraction of comparator positive (or negative) results that were also found positive (or
negative) by RVP FAST. Sensitivity was calculated by dividing the total number of "true
positive" RVP FAST results (TP) by the sum of the TP and "false negative" (FN) RVP FAST
results. Specificity was calculated by dividing the total number of "true negative" RVP FAST
results (TN) by the sum of the TN and "false positive" (FP) RVP FAST results. An RVP
FAST result was considered to be a TP or TN result only in the event that it agreed with the
comparator method result for the analyte in question. The prospective performance data (all
sites combined) are presented by analyte in the Tables 44-51:

Prospective Clinical Study Mixed Infection Analysis
Co-infections with more than one virus were reported in 36 of the1191 clinical specimens
included in the prospective dataset (3.0%). The prevalence of co-infections in the sample
set is summarized in Table 53. The single most common co-infection was Human
Rhinovirus with Respiratory Syncytial Virus. These viruses were the most prevalent in the
tested population.

Retrospective Clinical Study
Since Adenovirus does not show seasonality, the prospective sample set was supplemented
with banked, pre-selected, positive clinical specimens (34) collected at selected sites and
tested by RVP FAST (Table 54). Pre-selected positive clinical specimens were not blinded
prior to testing. These retrospective archived samples were characterized previously at the
source sites using a variety of methods including DSFA, viral culture followed by DFA,
Luminex X-TAG RVP, and LDT PCR assays

An additional 77 clinical specimens (NP swabs) confirmed by CDC real-time PCR Swine Flu
(H1N1) assay to be positive for Flu A 2009 H1N1 were tested by RVP FAST. Of these,
seventy-five (75) were Flu A unsubtypeable (97.40%, LB 95% CI 90.93%), two (2)
specimens were Flu A H1 positive by RVP FAST (2.60%) and none were negative for Flu A
