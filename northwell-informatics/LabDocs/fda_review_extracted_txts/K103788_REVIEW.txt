L. Test Principle:
There are two different measuring principles employed, potentiometry and
photometry/colorimetry.
Potentiometry for sodium potassium and chloride: Electrical potential measured
between the reference electrode flowed by a reference solution and the specific
selective electrode flowed by the sample. Slopes of the electrodes are determined
with two standard solutions of known concentrations and stored by the instrument.
Colorimetry for glucose: Glucose measurement employed the hexokinase method
coupled with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The amount of absorbance change
is proportional to the concentration of the glucose being present in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed to assess the with-run precision and total
precision of the PENTRA C200 system by replicate measurements of controls
materials and human samples (Serum, lithium heparin plasma, and urine). The
precision study was performed in duplicates, twice a day, for twenty days.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed according to the recommendations found in
the CLSI EP6-A guideline. Serum or urine samples containing the target
analytes (glucose, sodium, potassium, and chloride) in different
concentrations were prepared. Each sample was run in four replicates per
level. The observed values were plotted against the expected values and an
appropriate line fitted by standard linear regression. Results were summarized
in the tables below:

In addition, the sponsor performed a limit of detection study for the glucose
assay according to a modified protocol based on the CLSI EP17-A guideline.
Limit of blank (LoB) was determined by testing 90 times of a blank sample on
3 different instruments. Limit of detection (LoD) was determined by testing
four low serum samples 20 times on one instrument. Limit of quantitation

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were conducted following CLSI EP9-A2. This
study was conducted for glucose (serum), chloride (serum, plasma, and urine),
potassium (serum, plasma and urine), and sodium (serum, plasma, and urine).
Plasma samples were collected from lithium heparin plasma samples. The
method comparison studies were performed on the ABX Pentra C200 and
compared to the predicate device (ABX Pentra 400). Left over clinical
laboratory serum, plasma, and urine samples covering the measuring range were
analyzed in duplicate and a singlet set of data were used for linear regression
analysis. To cover the high and low ends of the measuring range, some
specimens were spiked with stock solutions and others were diluted with saline
(glucose samples) and DI water (sodium, potassium, and chloride samples).
Deming regression results were summarized in the table below:

b. Matrix comparison:
Anticoagulated plasma and serum were evaluated to demonstrate equivalency of these
matrices for measurement of glucose, sodium, potassium, and chloride. The
following anticoagulants were tested in the study: lithium heparin and fluoride
oxalate for the glucose assay and lithium heparin for the sodium, potassium and
chloride assays. Matched samples for serum and plasma were collected for each
comparison. All samples were assayed in duplicate over several days on the PENTRA
C200. Results of the study are summarized in the following tables:

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
A dilution study was provided to show that the instrument can automatically diluted
sample with a dilution factor of 3. Six serum samples (spiked) with glucose
concentrations range from 900 mg/dL to 2700 mg/dL were manually diluted X3 and
assayed on the Pentra C200 instrument. Results were compared with the automatic
dilution protocol of the Pentra C200 instrument. Results showed that the instrument
can automatically dilute the serum samples accurately.
An ambient temperature study on the Pentra C200 was performed to demonstrate that
ambient temperature between 15 to 30oC will not have a significant impact on the
performance (ISE and glucose) of the Pentra C200. The study protocol and
acceptance criteria was found to be adequate.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
