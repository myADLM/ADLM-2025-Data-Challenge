2 (HSV2) DNA extracted from external anogenital lesion specimens obtained from
symptomatic individuals.
C. Measurand:
Target DNA sequences from HSV1 and HSV2
D. Type of Test:
Qualitative, in vitro diagnostic tests using SDA technology for the detection and
differentiation of HSV1 and HSV2 DNA extracted from external anogenital lesion
specimens. Automated extraction of nucleic acids is performed using the BD
ViperTM System in Extracted Mode. Amplification and detection of target DNA are
carried out simultaneously using separate microwells for HSV1 and HSV2 specific
reactions. The presence or absence of HSV DNA is determined by calculating the
peak fluorescence (Maximum Relative Fluorescent Units (MaxRFU)) over the course
of the amplification process and by comparing this measurement to a predetermined
threshold value.

I. Device Description:
The BD ProbeTec HSV Qx Amplified DNA Assays are based on the simultaneous
amplification and detection of target DNA using amplification primers and
Fluorescently labeled detector probes. The reagents for SDA are dried in four
separate disposable microwells:
1. Two Priming Microwells (one each for HSV1 and HSV2) contain the
amplification primers, fluorescently labeled detector probe, nucleotides and
other reagents necessary for amplification, and
2

--- Page 3 ---
2. Two Amplification Microwells (one each for HSV1 and HSV2) contain the
enzymes (a DNA polymerase and a restriction endonuclease) that are required
for SDA.
In addition to the fluorescent probe used to detect amplified HSV target DNA, a
second labeled oligonucleotide is incorporated into each reaction. This Extraction
Control (EC) oligonucleotide is labeled with a different dye than that used for
detection of the HSV specific target and is used to confirm the validity of the
extraction process. The EC is dried in the extraction tubes and is rehydrated upon
addition of the specimen and extraction reagents. At the end of the extraction
process, the EC fluorescence is monitored by the BD Viper instrument and an
automated algorithm is applied to both the EC and HSV specific signals to report
specimen results as positive, negative, or EC failure.
An overview of the procedure is as follows:
1. The patient swab is collected from external anogenital lesions using any of the
following specimen and collection transport devices: BD ProbeTec Qx
Collection Kit for Endocervical or Lesion Specimens, BD Universal Viral
Transport (UVT), or Copan Universal Transport Medium (UTM-RT), which is
formulated identically to BD UVT.
2. The specimen is pre-warmed at 114 0C in Qx Swab Diluent Tube placed into a
BD Viper Lysing Heater.
3. After cooling, the specimen is loaded onto the BD Viper System.
4. The specimen is transferred by the BD Viper System to an Extraction Tube
that contains ferric oxide particles in a dissolvable film and dried Extraction
Control. Viruses are lysed at high pH to liberate the DNA into solution. Acid
is then added to lower the pH and induce a positive charge on the ferric oxide,
which in turn binds the negatively charged DNA. The particles and bound
DNA are then pulled to the sides of the extraction tube by magnets and the
remainder of the treated specimen is aspirated to waste. The particles with
bound DNA are washed and a high pH Elution Buffer is added to elute the
purified DNA. Finally, a Neutralization Buffer is used to adjust the extracted
solution to the optimal pH for amplification of the target.
5. The BD Viper System pipettes portions of the purified DNA solution from
each extraction tube into two separate Priming Microwells to rehydrate their
contents, one well corresponding to HSV1 and the other to HSV2. After a
brief incubation, the reaction mixtures are transferred to corresponding, pre-
warmed Amplification Microwells which are then sealed to prevent
contamination and incubated in one of the two thermally controlled
fluorescent readers. The presence or absence of HSV DNA is determined by
calculating the peak fluorescence (Maximum Relative Fluorescent Units
(MaxRFU)) over the course of the amplification process and by comparing
this measurement to a predetermined threshold value.

(CLSI EP-17A 2004)
L. Test Principle:
The BD ProbeTec HSV Qx Amplified DNA Assays target analyte-specific sequences
within a common region of the herpes simplex viral genome. Differences in the
oligonucleotide sequences between the two assays allow specific detection of either
HSV1 or HSV2. DNA is extracted and purified from a patient swab specimen by the
BD Viper System using ferric oxide particles. The purified DNA is then transferred
to two Priming Microwells (one each for HSV1 and HSV2) that contain specific
primers and fluorescently labeled probes. After an incubation period, the contents of
the Priming Microwells are transferred to two Amplification Microwells that contain
the enzymes (DNA polymerase and restriction endonuclease) that are necessary for
Strand Displacement Amplification (SDA) to occur. SDA is carried out under
isothermal conditions. If HSV1 DNA is present in the patient sample, the target
sequence is amplified by SDA in the Amplification Microwell containing HSV1
specific reagents but not in the Amplification Microwell containing HSV2 specific
reagents. As HSV1 target is amplified, the HSV1 fluorescently labeled probe is
degraded, resulting in a concomitant increase in fluorescent signal in the HSV1
Amplification Microwell (but not in the HSV2 Amplification Microwell). If HSV2
DNA is present in the patient sample, amplification of the HSV2 target sequence
occurs in the HSV2 Amplification Microwell, and there is an increase in fluorescent
signal in the HSV2 Amplification Microwell (but not in the HSV1 Amplification
Microwell). In the rare event that a patient sample contains both HSV1 and HSV2
DNA, there will be an increase in fluorescence signal in both HSV1 and HSV2
Amplification Microwells. If there is no HSV DNA in the patient sample,
amplification of target sequence does not occur and there is no increase in
fluorescence signal in either the HSV1 or HSV2 Amplification Microwells.
The change in fluorescence in the Amplification Microwells is monitored during the
course of the amplification reaction. The presence or absence of HSV DNA is
determined by calculating the peak fluorescence (Maximum Relative Fluorescent
Units (MaxRFU)) over the course of the amplification process and by comparing this
measurement to a predetermined threshold value of 125 MaxRFU..
In addition to the fluorescent probe used to detect amplified HSV target DNA, a
second labeled oligonucleotide is incorporated into each reaction. The Extraction
Control (EC) oligonucleotide is labeled with a different dye than that used for
detection of the HSV specific target and is used to confirm the validity of the
extraction process. The EC is dried in the Extraction Tubes and is rehydrated upon
addition of the specimen and extraction reagents. At the end of the extraction
process, the EC fluorescence is monitored by the BD Viper instrument and an
6

--- Page 7 ---
automated algorithm is applied to both the EC and HSV specific signals to report
specimen results as positive, negative, or EC failure.
Interpretation of Control Results:
The HSV1 and HSV2 Positive Control and the HSV1 and HSV2 Negative Control
must test as positive and negative, respectively, in order to obtain patient results. If
controls do not perform as expected, the run is considered invalid and patient results
will not be reported by the instrument. If either of the controls does not provide the
expected results, the entire run should be repeated using a new set of controls, new
extraction tubes, new extraction reagent trough, new lysis trough and new microwells.
The following table summarizes the interpretation of quality control results.

Interpretation of Specimen Results:
The BD ProbeTec HSV Qx Amplified DNA Assays use fluorescent energy transfer as
the detection method to test for the presence of Herpes Simplex Types 1 and 2 in
clinical specimens. All calculations are performed automatically by the BD Viper
software. The presence or absence of HSV1 or HSV2 DNA is determined by
calculating the peak fluorescence (MaxRFU) over the course of the amplification
process and by comparing this measurement to a predetermined threshold value. The
magnitude of the MaxRFU score is not indicative of the level of organism in the
specimen. If the HSV1 or HSV2 specific signal is greater than or equal to a threshold
of 125 MaxRFU, the EC fluorescence is ignored by the algorithm. If the HSV1 or
HSV2 specific signal is less than a threshold of 125 MaxRFU, the EC fluorescence is
utilized by the algorithm in the interpretation of the result. If assay control results are
not as expected, patient results are not reported. Reported results are determined as
summarized in the following table.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
An Inter-Laboratory Reproducibility study was conducted at 3 laboratory sites
(two external and one internal) with one BD Viper System per site. Two
panels of simulated specimens were tested. One panel consisted of HSV1
and/or HSV2 viral particles spiked into Qx Swab Diluent containing a swab
(simulated Qx Swab Diluent). The other panel consisted of HSV1 and/or
HSV2 viral particles spiked into UVT mixed with Qx Swab Diluent (simulated
UVT in Qx Swab Diluent specimen type). Uninoculated Qx Swab Diluent or
UVT in Qx Swab Diluent was used for the negative samples. Six replicates of
each panel member were tested every day for five days on each BD Viper
System for a total of ninety results per panel member. The data are
summarized in the following two tables for HSV1 and HSV2.

*The coefficient of variation (CV) is not a useful measure when the mean approaches 0 as the CV is very sensitive to small changes in the mean.
** HSV1 and HSV2 were spiked at either 2-fold (2x) or 5-fold (5x) the LOD.
*** Non-reportable results due to a BD Viper Instrument error which caused a reduction in the full number of replicates.
Two additional target levels were also tested to characterize the test results reproducibility (i.e., proportion positive or
negative) at target levels below the analytical LOD. These additional specimens were comprised of HSV1 +2 viral
particles seeded into either Qx Swab Diluent or UVT in Qx Swab Diluent at 1:10 and 1:100 dilutions of the respective
analytical LODs of each analyte. These levels were selected to fall within the dynamic range of the analytical LOD curves
for the BD ProbeTec HSV1 Qx and HSV2 Qx Amplified DNA Assays. Six replicates of each panel member were tested
every day for five days across the three BD Viper Systems. The data are summarized in the following two tables for
HSV1 and HSV2.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls
Extraction Control (EC): Each Extraction Tube contains a dried fluorescently
labeled oligonucleotide that is incorporated into each reaction. This
Extraction Control (EC) is labeled with a different dye than that used for
detection of the HSV specific target and is used to confirm the validity of the
extraction process. The EC is dried in the Extraction Tubes and is rehydrated
upon addition of the specimen and extraction reagents. At the end of the
extraction process, the EC fluorescence is monitored by the BD Viper
instrument and an automated algorithm is applied to both the EC and HSV
specific signals to report specimen results as positive, negative, or EC failure.
The Extraction Tubes containing the EC are sold separately from the BD
ProbeTec HSV Qx Amplified DNA Assays.
External Controls: External Control Reagents are adjunct reagents to the BD
ProbeTec HSV Qx Amplified DNA Assays. Each Control Set for the BD
ProbeTec HSV Qx Amplified DNA Assays contains 24 HSV Qx Positive
Control Tubes and 24 HSV Qx Negative Control Tubes. The Control Set is
intended for Quality Control use with The BD ProbeTec HSV Qx Amplified
DNA Assays when tested with the BD Viper™ System in Extracted Mode.
The HSV Qx Positive Control will monitor for substantial reagent failure only.
The HSV Qx Negative Control monitors for reagent and/or environmental
contamination.
d. Detection limits:
A Limit of Detection (LOD) study was performed in-house in accordance with
CLSI EP-17-A (Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of
Quantitation: Approved Guideline). The LOD of each of the BD ProbeTec
HSV Qx Assays was determined by diluting HSV1 strain VR-539 and HSV2
strain VR-734 in representative matrix at varying concentrations of viral
particles to create an LOD panel consisting of six target levels. Labial swab
matrix was selected as representative as it was the most challenging matrix for
the HSV Qx Assays. The labial swab matrix was prepared by collecting labial
swab specimens from HSV negative donors and expressing the swabs in Qx
Swab Diluent or UVT. The Qx Swab Diluent containing the labial swab
specimens was spiked directly with HSV in order to prepare the LOD panel
for the Qx Swab Diluent specimen type. The UVT containing the labial swab
specimens was mixed 1:4 (v/v) with Qx Swab Diluent prior to spiking with
HSV. Data were generated for each target level (66 to 72 replicates per level)
12

--- Page 13 ---
and the resulting MaxRFU values were analyzed to determine positive rates at
each level. LOD was determined as the lowest level of virus detected ≥ 95%
of the time. The LOD for the UVT specimen type corresponds to the level of
HSV in UVT prior to diluting 1:4 with Qx Swab Diluent. Consequently, the
LOD for the UVT specimen will be higher than the LOD for the Qx Swab
Diluent specimen.
The LOD values for the HSV1 Qx Assay with Human Herpes Virus type 1
strain VR-539 in labial swab matrix were determined to be 23 viral
particles/mL (vp/mL) for Qx Swab Diluent and 85 vp/mL for UVT. These
values were also determined in units of TCID /mL as 7 TCID /mL (Qx Swab
50 50
Diluent) and 25 TCID /mL (UVT).
50
The LOD values for the HSV2 Qx Assay with Human Herpes Virus type 2
strain VR-734 in labial swab matrix were determined to be 84 vp/mL (35
TCID /mL) for Qx Swab Diluent and 635 vp/mL (262 TCID /mL) for UVT.
50 50
An LOD study was also carried out with strains of HSV1 (VR-260, VR-733,
VR-735) and HSV2 (VR-540) diluted in clean UVT and Qx Swab Diluent.
The results from the LOD studies are summarized in the following tables.

e. Analytical specificity:
DNA from 57 organisms listed in the table below was extracted on the BD
Viper System and tested with the BD ProbeTec HSV Qx Amplified DNA
Assays. All potential cross-reactive species were tested at approximately
1x108 Colony Forming Units/mL for bacteria and yeast or 1x106 Plaque
Forming Units/mL or greater for viruses, except where noted. The HSV Qx
Assays did not cross-react with any of the organisms tested.

f. Interference Studies:
The performance of the BD ProbeTec HSV Qx Amplified DNA Assays
was evaluated in the presence of potentially interfering substances which
may be encountered in clinical specimens. Potentially interfering
substances were spiked into Qx Swab Diluent and UVT specimen
matrices, in both the presence and the absence of HSV1 and HSV2 (69
HSV1 vp/mL and 252 vp/mL HSV2 in Qx Swab Diluent matrix, and 255
HSV1 vp/mL and 1905 vp/mL HSV2 in UVT swab matrix). These levels
are three times the Limits of Detection. The strains of HSV1 and HSV2
used in this study were VR-539 and VR-734, respectively. Testing was
carried out in replicates of thirty-two. No interference was observed for
any of the substances at the concentrations listed in the following table.

g. Assay cut-off:
The “cutoff value” represents the MaxRFU score at which a “positive”
reaction reaches a value above the background or baseline of a “negative”
reaction. A preliminary estimate of the cutoff values for the BD ProbeTec
HSV Qx Amplified DNA Assays was determined in-house by ROC analysis of
827 total assay results from 223 unique patients. The preliminary cutoff value
determined for the HSV Qx Amplified DNA Assays was 125 MaxRFU. The
preliminary EC cutoff value that was selected was the same as previously
established for the CTQ and GCQ Assays on the BD Viper System. The
performance of the HSV Qx Amplified DNA Assays with the preliminary
assay cutoff (125 MaxRFU) and EC cutoff was evaluated in three phases at
external clinical sites: a cutoff analysis (to verify the preliminary assay and
EC cutoffs prior to the main clinical trial), a clinical trial (to validate the
performance of the assays in different clinical settings), and a reproducibility
study. These three phases confirmed that the preliminary cutoff values for
assay and EC were acceptable.
h. Carry-over/Cross-Contamination
An internal study was conducted to evaluate the risk of producing a false
positive result in either the same run on the BD Viper System in Extracted
Mode (within run cross-contamination) or in a subsequent run (between run
carry-over). Testing was carried out using negative and positive samples on
three BD Viper Systems. Negative samples consisted of UVT in Qx Swab
Diluent. HSV positive samples consisted of UVT medium diluted in Qx Swab
Diluent and spiked with 105 vp/mL of HSV2 strain VR-734. HSV2 was
selected as the representative analyte due to its higher prevalence in
anogenital lesion specimens. Two runs with alternating columns of positive
and negative samples were carried out on each instrument to determine the
rate of cross-contamination. The overall rate of cross-contamination (i.e.,
with alternating columns of positive and negative samples) was 0.36%
(4/1104). A third run was then carried out on each instrument with negative
samples to determine the rate of carry-over contamination. The overall rate of
carry-over contamination (i.e., carry-over between successive runs when the
prevalence was 50% in the previous run) was 0.09% (1/1104). Cross-
contamination and carry-over rates across the three BD Viper Systems are
summarized in the following table.

2. Comparison studies:

typing by fluorescently labeled antibodies.
b. Matrix Comparison:
N/A
3. Clinical studies:
Clinical performance of the BD ProbeTec HSV Qx Amplified DNA Assays was
established by testing external anogenital lesion swab specimens collected from
564 compliant male and female subjects attending family planning, OB/GYN, and
sexually transmitted disease clinics at nine geographically diverse clinical sites in
North America. Fifty-six subjects were excluded from the data analysis due to
age requirement violations, antiviral use in the last 21 days, opting to withdraw
from the study after initially consenting, transport errors, informed consent issues,
failing to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, collection errors, shipping errors,
or labeling errors. Therefore, the final data analysis included 508 compliant
subjects.
Two swab specimens were collected from external anogenital lesions from each
of the 508 compliant subjects. The first specimen collected was always the
Universal Viral Transport specimen followed by the BD ProbeTec Qx Collection
Kit for Endocervical or Lesion Specimens (Qx Swab Diluent specimen). The
UVT specimen was aliquoted into a Qx Swab Diluent Tube (UVT in Qx Swab
Diluent) and a cryovial (vial suitable for -70 °C storage). The remaining UVT
specimen was sent to one of two laboratories for viral culture and typing by
fluorescent antibody staining. The Qx Swab Diluent specimen and the UVT in Qx
Swab Diluent specimen were transported to one of the three BD Viper testing
laboratories where they were tested using the BD ProbeTec HSV1 and HSV2 Qx
Assays on the BD Viper System. The cryovial containing the UVT aliquot was
sent to a laboratory for PCR testing.
Calculations of sensitivity and specificity were based on the BD ProbeTec HSV1
and HSV2 Qx Assays results for Qx Swab Diluent specimens and UVT in Qx Swab
Diluent specimens as compared to a commercially available viral culture and
fluorescent antibody typing procedure as the reference method. A PCR method
was used for analysis of discrepant results from the ProbeTec HSV Qx Amplified
DNA Assays and the reference culture/typing method.
The lesion was considered to be positive for HSV1 if the reference viral
17

--- Page 18 ---
culture/typing method was positive for HSV and typed as HSV1. The lesion was
considered negative for HSV1 if the reference viral culture/typing method was
negative for HSV. There were a total of seven subjects that failed to provide a
reference viral culture/typing result leaving 501 evaluable subjects. Of the 501
subjects with a reference viral culture/typing result, 189 were positive for HSV2.
The viral culture/typing method cannot detect HSV1 in specimens that are
positive for HSV2 and thus the 189 HSV2 positive specimens were not included
in the analysis of HSV1 performance. A total of four Qx Swab Diluent specimens
were not included in the HSV1 analysis due to insufficient volume, aliquot error,
collection error, or extraction error. The remaining specimens, 312 UVT in Qx
Swab Diluent specimens and 308 Qx Swab Diluent specimens, were available to
calculate sensitivity and specificity
The lesion was considered to be positive for HSV2 if the reference viral
culture/typing method was positive for HSV and typed as HSV2. Subjects were
considered negative for HSV2 if the reference viral culture/typing method was
negative for HSV or the reference viral culture/typing method was positive for
HSV and typed as HSV1. There were a total of 7 subjects that failed to provide a
reference viral culture typing result leaving 501 evaluable subjects. There were
three noncompliant Qx Swab Diluent specimens due to insufficient volume,
aliquot error or collection error. The remaining specimens, 501 UVT in Qx Swab
Diluent specimens and 498 Qx Swab Diluent specimens, were available to
calculate sensitivity and specificity.
Sensitivity and specificity by specimen type for the HSV1 and HSV2 Qx Assays
are summarized in the following two tables.

1 The reference viral culture used in this study was unable to detect co-infected specimens. Only if the
specimen is negative for HSV2 is it typed for HSV1. The number of samples used for HSV1
analysis equals the number of samples with a reference viral culture typing result (501) minus the
number of samples positive for HSV2 by the reference method (189).
2 A total of four Qx Swab Diluent specimens were not included in the HSV1 analysis due to
insufficient volume, aliquot error, collection error, or extraction error.
3 Both subjects that were identified as positive for HSV1 by viral culture/typing were negative for
HSV1 with the HSV1 Qx Assay and PCR. Both the HSV Qx Assays and the PCR assay identified
the subjects as positive for HSV2.
4 There were six UVT in Qx Swab Diluent specimens that were identified as negative for HSV1 by
viral culture/typing but were positive for both the HSV1 Qx Assay and the PCR assay.

6 All three subjects that were identified as positive for HSV2 by viral culture/typing were negative for
HSV2 with both the HSV2 Qx Assay and PCR assay. Both the HSV Qx Assays and the PCR assays
identified all three subjects as positive for HSV1.
7 There were 51 UVT in Qx Swab Diluent specimens that were identified as negative for HSV2 by
viral culture/typing but were positive by the HSV2 Qx Assay. PCR was positive for HSV2 for 46 of
these 51 specimens.
8 There were 60 Qx Swab Diluent specimens that were identified as negative for HSV2 by viral
culture/typing but were positive by the HSV2 Qx Assay. PCR was positive for HSV2 for 49 of these
60 specimens.
9 Detection of nucleic acid by PCR and the HSV2 Qx Assay in samples that were culture negative
could indicate detection of nonviable viral particles.
The results obtained with the HSV1 and HSV2 Qx Assays during the clinical
performance testing were analyzed to generate frequency distributions of
MaxRFU values. The data summarized in the following four tables indicate that
positive and negative results obtained with the HSV1 and HSV2 Qx Assays were
well separated from the cutoff of 125 MaxRFU.

4. Clinical cut-off:
A preliminary value for the clinical cutoff was estimated by ROC analysis of 827
assay results from 223 unique patients. The preliminary cutoff value determined
for the HSV Qx Amplified DNA Assays was 125 MaxRFU. The performance of
the HSV Qx Amplified DNA Assays with the preliminary cutoff (125 MaxRFU)
was evaluated in three phases at external clinical sites: a cutoff analysis (to verify
the preliminary cutoff prior to the main clinical trial), a clinical trial (to validate
the performance of the assays with the cuoff value), and a reproducibility study.
These studies confirmed that the cutoff value of 125 MaxRFU was appropriate
for incorporation into the algorithm software used by the BD Viper System in
Extracted Mode.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The prevalence observed during the multi-center clinical trial (Feburary/2010 –
August/2010) for anogenital lesion specimens was estimated using the BD
ProbeTec HSV Qx Amplified DNA Assays. The prevalence for HSV1 for the
UVT in Qx Swab Diluent specimens was 13.2% (66/501) and for the Qx Swab
Diluent specimens was 14.3% (71/497). The prevalence for HSV2 for the UVT
in Qx Swab Diluent specimens was 47.3% (237/501) and for the Qx Swab Diluent
specimens was 49.4% (246/498).
The following table summarizes the number of positive results and total number
of specimens for each assay and specimen type by the age of the subject.

**Of the 501 evaluable subjects, three noncompliant Qx swab diluent specimens were not available for the
HSV1 and HSV2 data analysis. They were noncompliant due to insufficient volume, aliquot error, or
collection error.
***One Qx Swab Diluent specimen resulted in a HSV1 extraction error on the BD Viper System leaving a
total of 497 HSV1 results for this specimen type.
Hypothetical positive and negative predictive values (PPV & NPV) for the HSV1
and HSV2 Qx Assays were calculated based on hypothetical prevalence and
overall sensitivity and specificity per specimen type as determined in the clinical
trial. For the HSV1 Qx Assay, these calculations are based upon an overall
sensitivity and specificity of 96.8% and 97.6%, respectively, for the UVT in Qx
Swab Diluent and 96.7% and 95.1%, respectively, for the Qx Swab Diluent. For
the HSV2 Qx Assay, the hypothetical PPV and NPV are based upon an overall
sensitivity and specificity of 98.4% and 83.7%, respectively, for the UVT in Qx
Swab Diluent and 98.4% and 80.6%, respectively, for the Qx Swab Diluent.
