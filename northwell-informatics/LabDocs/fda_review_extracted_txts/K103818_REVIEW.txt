I. Device Description:
The Ventana CONFIRM anti-Progesterone Receptor (PR) (1E2) Rabbit Monoclonal
Primary Antibody is a qualitative immunohistochemical assay used to identify the
1

--- Page 2 ---
progesterone receptor (PR) antigen in normal and neoplastic tissues sections that have
been formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. These antibodies are available as ready-
to-use reagents and can only be used on the Ventana Benchmark immunostainer
platforms.
The antibody is diluted in 0.05M Tris-HCl with 2% carrier protein, and 0.1% ProClin
300, a preservative. There is trace (~0.2%) fetal calf serum of U.S. origin from the
stock solution. Total protein concentration of the reagent is approximately 10
mg/mL. Specific antibody concentration is approximately 1 μg/mL. It also contains
a biotin conjugated secondary antibody formulation which recognizes rabbit or mouse
immunoglobulins and a streptavidin-enzyme conjugate which binds to the biotin on
the secondary antibody. CONFIRM anti-PR (1E2) is a rabbit monoclonal antibody
produced as a cell culture supernatant. There is no known non-specific antibody
reactivity observed in this product.

embedded tissue. The antigen in tissue sections is demonstrated through several
steps. The specific antibody binds to the antigen present in tissue sections. The
bound primary antibody is located by a biotin conjugated secondary antibody
formulation which recognizes rabbit or mouse immunoglobulins. This step is
followed by the addition of a streptavidin-enzyme conjugate which binds to the biotin
on the secondary antibody. The primary antibody-secondary antibody-avidin enzyme
complex is visualized by using a precipitating enzyme generated product. This is
readily detected by light microscopy.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Studies to assess the intra-run (within-run, intra-day) and inter-run (day-to-
day) analytical precision of CONFIRM anti-PR (1E2) antibody was conducted
using two Ventana IHC stainers: BenchMark XT and BenchMark Ultra
instruments and the iView DAB Detection Kit with biotin blocker reagents
(A/B Blocker). In each study, nine slides were stained with the CONFIRM
anti-PR (1E2) antibody and one slide was stained with Negative Control
Rabbit Ig antibody from six individual breast carcinoma tissue blocks. Of the
six tissues, two were PR negative, two were PR low expression and two were
PR high expression based on a cutoff of <1% tumor cells staining for
negative, 1-10% for low and >10% for high expression. A total of 30 slides
were stained on each of the two IHC stainers - BenchMark XT and
BenchMark Ultra instruments. An acceptance criteria of at least 90% overall
agreement rates for positive and negative staining status was set by the
sponsor.
Intra-run Precision:
Intra-run precision of CONFIRM anti-PR (1E2) antibody on BenchMark XT
was 100% concordant for all six cases. The background was reported as 0 on
100% of the tissues stained. Intra-run precision of CONFIRM anti-PR (1E2)
antibody on BenchMark ULTRA was 100% concordant for all six cases.
Background was below 0.25 on 100% of the tissues stained. The acceptance
criteria set by the sponsor were met in these studies.
Inter-run Precision:
Inter-run precision was assessed in five separate nonconsecutive runs
conducted over a 20 day period on the same BenchMark XT. There were a
total of 30 slides per run. The same testing configuration was also performed
on a BenchMark ULTRA instrument.
Inter-run precision of CONFIRM anti-PR (1E2) antibody on BenchMark XT
was 100% concordant for all six cases. The background was reported as
below 0.5 on 100% of the tissues stained. Inter-run precision of CONFIRM
anti-PR (1E2) antibody on BenchMark ULTRA was 100% concordant for all
six cases. Background was below 0.25 on 100% of the tissues stained. The
acceptance criteria set by the sponsor were met in these studies.
Intra-platform Reproducibility
Four slides from six cases were stained with CONFIRM anti-PR (1E2)
3

--- Page 4 ---
antibody and one slide from each case was stained with Negative Control
Rabbit Ig antibody on three separate BenchMark XT instruments. The same
testing configuration was used for the BenchMark ULTRA instrument. The
acceptance criteria set by the sponsor was as follows: The percentage of cells
staining shall not vary in binning categories (as defined in protocol) on a
minimum of 80% (positive) tissues tested. Background shall be ≤0.5 on a
minimum of 90% of samples stained. This study met the acceptance criteria
set by the sponsor and showed acceptable reproducibility with no variation in
staining quality and patterns.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls: Positive and negative control slides should be stained with each
staining run. The pathologist is responsible for assuring the proper
performance of this test.
Stability: Real-time stability tests and ship-stress tests were conducted to
determine the shelf life of the reagent. Three lots of the reagent were tested.
The acceptance criteria set by the sponsor were as follows: Positive cases –
nuclear staining of 51% - 100% of the tumor cells and no more than 0.5
difference in staining intensity when compared to the Day 0 slide stain and
less than or equal to 0.5+ non-specific staining. Background staining (0-4+)
must not be greater than 0.5+. The acceptance criteria were met in these
studies. Based on these studies, the expiration date of this reagent is set at 18
months.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
A total of 90 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues covering a wide
range of normal human tissues types were tested with the CONFIRM anti-PR
(1E2) antibody. The antibody demonstrated negative immunoreactivity with
most tissues. Positive immunoreactivity was noted in breast, uterus, and
cervix (uterine) tissues as expected.
f. Assay cut-off:
A negative staining result is defined as <1% tumor cells staining and a
positive staining result is defined as ≥ 1% tumor cells staining of any
intensity.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The Ventana CONFIRM anti-PR (1E2) antibody was compared to the
predicate device Dako FLEX Monoclonal Mouse Anti-Human Progesterone
Receptor Clone PGR636.
A total of 336 breast carcinoma slides were tested in 3 different sites on the
two Ventana platforms and the Dako Autostainer Plus. The acceptance
criteria set by the sponsor were as follows: greater than 85% positive and
negative agreement rates across all sites for CONFIRM anti-PR (1E2) staining

An additional assessment of the staining of the ductal carcinoma in-situ
(DCIS) component was also performed. The primary objective of this study
was to determine if the performance of the staining in areas of human breast
carcinoma specimens using the CONFIRM anti-PR (1E2) with BenchMark
ULTRA was equivalent to that using the FLEX anti-PR (636) with the Dako
Autostainer Plus. All slides from the method comparison study that contained
invasive tumor as well as DCIS component were assessed. There were no
pre-set acceptance criteria. Of the PR positive cases, >99% of cases had
positive staining in the DCIS component as well as the invasive component.
