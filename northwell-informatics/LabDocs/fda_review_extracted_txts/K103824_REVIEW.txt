The determination of soluble antigen concentration by turbidimetric methods involves
the reaction with specific antiserum to form insoluble complexes. When light is
passed through the suspension formed, a portion of the light is transmitted and
focused onto a photoiodide by an optical lens system. The amount of transmitted light
is indirectly proportional to the specific protein concentration in the test sample.
Concentrations are automatically calculated by reference to a calibration curve within
the instrument. Addition of a low level range at a neat sample dilution (0.02 – 0.7
g/L) to the device previously cleared in k081827 allows samples to be measured blow
0.2 g/L. The sample volume has changed from 25 mL to 8 mL to allow samples to be
run at neat.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The intra-assay and inter-assay precision was determined by testing four
serum samples over 21 days with two runs per day on three different reagent
lots on three analysers. Results are summarized below.
Within-Run Between-Run Between-Day Total
Mean
Sample

SD CV % SD CV % SD CV % SD CV %
Serum 1 5.895 0.06 1.0 0.08 1.4 0.18 3.1 0.21 3.5
Serum 2 3.606 0.025 0.7 0.06 1.7 0.11 3.1 0.13 3.6

Serum 4 0.073 0.001 2.0 0.0004 0.5 0.003 3.8 0.003 4.3
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity across the assay range (0.02 – 28.0 g/L) was confirmed by testing
two serum pools with high range concentrations up to 30.9 g/L and one serum
pool with low concentrations from 0.5 – 7.6 g/L. The samples were serially
diluted 9 times with buffer (1:10) down to the lower measuring range (0.02
g/L). All testing were performed twice. The regression plot equations where y
is the measured level of IgA concentration and x the theoretical concentration
were as follows:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
An internal reference standard (IR7990) was assigned by comparison with the
European Reference Material ERM-DA470k (previously CRM470
International Reference Material).
Stability: Stability studies demonstrated that the unopened and opened kits were
stable at 2 - 8°C for 6 months and 3 months, respectively, and that on-board
IgA kit are stable for 30 days.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limits were determined by testing 60 replicates of a blank
sample, the lowest calibrator, or a sample with value close to the blank
sample. The limit of blank claim for this assay is 0.001 g/L as determined by
testing 60 replicates of a blank sample. The limit of detection represents the
lowest measurable analyte level that can be distinguished from zero and has
been estimated at 0.003 g/L. The limit of quantitation is defined as the lowest
amount of analyte that can be quantitatively determined and has been
estimated as 0.020 g/L for this assay.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference by endogenous and other substances:
No significant assay interference by 1500 formazine turbidity units (FTU) of
chyle, 200 mg/L bilirubin, or 5g/L hemoglobin using IgA sample at 0.255 g/L.
No interference is demonstrated with rheumatoid factor (RF 546 IU/mL).
There is no cross reactivity between IgA and IgG or IgM under normal assay
conditions.
The package insert states that “turbidimetric assays are not suitable for
measurement of highly lipemic or hemolyzed samples, or samples containing
high levels of circulating immune complexes due to the unpredictable degree
of non-specific scatter these sample types might generate. Unexpected results
should be confirmed using alternative assay method”.

Antigen excess effect:
The possibility of antigen excess occurring when using the device on The
Binding Site SPA ™ was evaluated with 2 serum samples with IgA
PLUS
concentrations above the assay range (53.00 and 47.10 g/L). No antigen
excess effect up to 40.10 g/L of IgA was observed.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study between Human IgA Liquid Reagent Kit on a
SPA ™ analyzer and predicate device was performed using 262 samples
PLUS
(88 normal, 152 known elevated or suppressed IgA samples and 22 low level
samples diluted to obtain results between 0.020 and 0.070g/L). A total of 55
samples were excluded: 39 samples with results of <0.04 g/L which is the
LoQ of the predicate device and 16 samples with results of >25.12 g/L which
is the upper limit of the new device. The study demonstrated the following
Passing-Bablok fit: y = 1.00x + 0.000 (g/L) with a correlation coefficient (r)
of 0.995.
Per ESID (European Society for Immunodeficiency) IgA Guidance
Document, a result of less than 0.070 g/L was considered to be positive (i.e.
an IgA deficient subject) and a result of greater than or equal to 0.070 g/L was
considered to be negative. Percent agreements between IgA Liquid Reagent
Kit on a SPA ™ analyzer and predicate in identifying IgA deficient
PLUS
samples were calculated as summarized in the table.

An additional correlation study was performed using 58 normal and 41
clinical samples from a pediatric population (<2 months to <21 years).
Results from Passing-Bablok regression show linear fit: y = 1.03x - 0.01; r
= 0.996.
b. Matrix comparison:
Serum versus plasma correlation were tested on 30 matched normal serum
plasma samples over the range of 1.0 to 6.3 g/L. Comparison was also
performed on 25 mL and 8 mL volumes on Serum versus lithium heparin
plasma and Serum versus EDTA plasma studies. Results from linear
regressions analyses are summarized in the table below.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and specificity:
A clinical study evaluated 33 samples on this kit : 17 IgA deficient samples
(11 of which were pediatric: 3 - 17 yrs), 7 non-target disease samples (1
chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 1 lambda light chain paraprotein, 1 primary
biliary cirrhosis, 1 myeloma and 3 Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia) and 9
samples from normal individuals. The 17 IgA deficient clinical samples all
had IgA levels below 0.07 g/L and the 16 remaining samples had levels above
0.07 g/L. These results support the claim that this kit is able to identify IgA
deficiency according to the ESID Guideline.
b. Other clinical supportive data (when a. is not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not provided.
5. Expected values/Reference range:

Adult reference range was assessed using a total of 258 serum samples from
healthy adult blood donors at 2 sites. A non-parametric distribution of IgA results
was seen that gave a 95 percentile reference interval of 0.850 - 4.990 g/L with a
mean of 0.2464 g/L and a median of 2.297 g/L.
