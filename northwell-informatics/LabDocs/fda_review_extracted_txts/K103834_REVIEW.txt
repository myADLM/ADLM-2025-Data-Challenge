L. Test Principle:
The BioPlex® 2200 APLS IgG and IgA kits use multiplex flow immunoassay, a
methodology similar to traditional EIA; however, this method permits simultaneous detection
and identification of many antibodies in a single tube. In the BioPlex APLS assays, two
different populations of dyed beads are coated with antigens. One bead population is coated
with β2-glycoprotein I and a second population is coated with both cardiolipin and β2-
glycoprotein I. Three additional populations of fluorescent beads function as assay controls.
The system combines an aliquot of patient sample, sample diluent, and bead reagent into a
reaction vessel and incubates the mixture at 37°C. After a wash cycle to remove unbound
antibody, the secondary conjugate containing either phycoerythrin conjugated murine
monoclonal anti-human IgG or anti-human IgA and phycoerythrin conjugated murine
monoclonal anti-human FXIII antibody (a control) is added and the mixture is incubated at
37°C. Excess conjugate is removed in another wash cycle and the beads are re-suspended in
wash buffer. The bead mixture then passes through the detector. The identity of the dyed
beads is determined by the fluorescence of the dyes, and the amount of antibody captured by
the antigen is determined by the fluorescence of the attached phycoerythrin. Raw data are
calculated in relative fluorescence intensity (RFI).
Three additional dyed beads, Internal Standard Bead (ISB), Serum Verification Bead (SVB),
and a Reagent Blank Bead (RBB) are present in each reaction mixture to verify detector
response, the addition of serum to the reaction vessel, and the absence of significant non-
specific binding in serum, respectively.
The anti-phospholipid assays are calibrated using a set of calibrators supplied separately by
Bio-Rad Laboratories. Results are calculated for both of the antibodies and are compared
against their own respective cut-off. For anti-β2-glycoprotein I, the results are provided in
units/mL (U/mL). The anti-cardiolipin results are similar except that the units are GPL-
U/mL and APL-U/mL for the IgG and IgA assays, respectively. The negative/positive assay
cutoff for four analytes of the two BioPlex® 2200 APLS kits is 20 units.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing of the BioPlex® 2200 APLS IgG and IgA kits on the BioPlex®
2200 instrument was performed in accordance with CLSI EP5-A2. Two serum and
heparinized plasma panels consisting of samples spanning the measuring range were
assayed in replicate twice daily over 20 days (n=80) expect for the mid negative
samples were run over 10 days (n=40). One positive and one negative control were
included. The data were analyzed for within-run, between-run, between-day, and
total precision and the standard deviation and percent coefficient of variation are
summarized below:

An additional internal lot-to-lot studies were conducted to estimate the expected
variance between instrument, within-run, between-run and total precision of a new lot
of BioPlex® 2200 APLS IgG and IgA reagents. Results are within acceptance
criteria.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Three APLS aCL and aβ2GPI IgG and IgA positive patient samples were tested to
demonstrate linearity. These samples were diluted with immunodepleted serum
according to CLSI EP06-A. Each sample and dilution was evaluated in replicates of
four using one APLS IgG and IgA lot on one instrument. Linear and polynomial
regression analysis of APLS IgG and IgA recovery vs. sample dilution was performed
to determine if the dilution curves exhibit statistically significant non-linear
regression based on the CLSI guideline EP06-A.
The regression parameters (slope, intercept and r2) of the observed values vs.
predicted values are show below.

Over-Range (OR) results may be generated for values greater than the reportable
measuring range and results are reported as > 112 GPL-U/mL and > 28 APL-U/mL
for aCL IgG and IgA, respectively; and >112 U/mL for ab2GPI IgG and > 28 U/mL
IgA.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
There is no international or certified reference material available for APLS aCL and
aβ2GPI IgG and IgA. The calibrators are assigned relative arbitrary units (U/mL for
ab2GPI, and GPL-U/mL and APL-U/mL for aCL IgG and IgA).
Value Assignment:
The calibrators are manufactured independently from the controls, and are stabilized
with <0.3% ProClin® 300, <0.1% sodium benzoate, and <0.1% sodium azide.
Calibrator assignment is established for matched lots of BioPlex® 2200 APLS IgG or
IgA kit and calibrators using a master set of calibrators as reference and replicate
analyses on multiple BioPlex® 2200 instruments. The BioPlex® 2200 APLS IgG
Reagent Kit is calibrated using a set of seven (7) distinct serum based calibrators for
aCL and ab2GPI IgG; three (3) distinct serum based calibrators for aCL and ab2GPI
IgA, which are used to establish points of reference for determining the presence of
APLS IgG, or IgA in human specimens.
The negative control has been tested to give results with values below the cut-off for
each assay. The positive control is prepared by blending human disease state serum
with negative serum matrix and is manufactured to give results with values above the
assay cut-off. The value assignment of the Control Set is derived by testing each
control on three BioPlex® 2200 Analyzers with at least two kit lots. For each control
level, three vials are tested in replicates of five using each of the kit lots and each
analyzer. This testing is performed on three analyzers for a total of 45 replicates per
reagent lot. The total number of replicates for each control level is 90 when two
reagent lots are used and 135 when three reagent lots are used. The mean value of the
control is calculated using data from all reagent lots, and the acceptable range of
±30% is based on the inter-assay precision specification of 15% (i.e. 2x inter-assay
precision).

days; Sample stability frozen (-20 or -80°C), 8 months; Sample Freeze-thaw (-20 or -
80°C), up to 3-freeze thaw cycles acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Detection (LoD) of BioPlex® 2200 IgG and IgA kits was determined by
assaying three low negative serum samples and a negative serum (blank) sample in
replicates of 50. The LoD was calculated according to CLSI EP17-A. The samples
were prepared from a high titer positive control which was then diluted in negative
serum spanning the range in analyte concentration below the cutoff. Each dilution
was assayed daily in replicates of ten for a period of five days. The LoD was
calculated using the equation LoD = LoB + c SD . The LoB was calculated at the
b s
95th percentile of 50 negative samples. c is the 95th percentile of the standard
b
Gaussian distribution with a correction factor applied to account for the biased
estimate of the population standard deviation. The results of LoD and LoB are
summarized in the table below.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interfering Substances:
An interfering substances study was conducted to evaluate the potential interference
of specific endogenous and exogenous substances with the BioPlex® 2200 APLS IgG
and IgA assay according to CLSI EP7-A2. Samples were prepared by blending a
pool of negative human serum with samples positive for aCL IgG or IgA and aβ GPI
2
IgG or IgA to achieve approximate values of 10, 20, 60 and 100 GPL for aCL IgG
and 10, 20, 60, 100 U/mL for aβ GPI IgG and 10, 20 APL-U/mL and U/mL for aCL
2
and aβ GPI IgA with interferent or blank. Test and control samples were evaluated in
2
alternating order in replicates of ten each. Substances are considered interfering if
their presence in a sample results in more than ± 20% deviation in quantitation
relative to the value determined in the absence of the substance. No interference was
observed with any of the substances tested. The substances and the maximum levels
tested are shown in the table below:
Substance Concentration
Hemoglobin ≤ 500 mg/dL
Bilirubin, Unconjugated ≤ 20 mg/dL
Bilirubin, Conjugated ≤ 30 mg/dL
Cholesterol ≤ 500 mg/dL

Ascorbic Acid ≤ 3 mg/dL
Lithium Heparin ≤ 8000 units/dL
Sodium Heparin ≤ 8000 units/dL
Sodium Citrate ≤ 1000 mg/dL
EDTA ≤ 800 mg/dL
Cross-Reactivity:
A cross-reactivity study was performed to determine if samples from individuals with
various disease states and other potentially interfering factors interfere with test
results from the BioPlex® 2200 APLS IgG or IgA kit. Samples from individual with
known disease states for potential cross reactivity listed in the table below were
evaluated with the BioPlex® 2200 APLS IgG, or IgA kit. The table below shows the

f. Assay cut-off:
The cutoff value and assignment of the calibrators are determined by performing
concordance testing and Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis. The study
to determine the APLS IgG or IgA assay cutoff is comprised of two sample groups –
one clinical cohort has 103 samples from patients diagnosed as primary and
secondary APS and 208 from normal healthy and 123 from non-APS cardiac donors.
The cut-off was established to achieve a clinical specificity of 99% while accepting
the resultant clinical sensitivity. The criteria for choosing a cutoff at the 99th
percentile of a normal healthy population is derived from the “International
Consensus Statement on an Update of the Classification Criteria for Definite
Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS)”, Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2006)
4, 295.

b. Matrix comparison:
Testing for matrix effects was conducted using more than 30 matched sets of serum
and sodium citrate, lithium heparin, and sodium heparin plasma samples drawn from
the same donor in accordance with CLSI EP9-A2. The samples were spiked with
aCL IgG or IgA and ab2GPI IgG or IgA positive sera as necessary in order to
assemble a panel of samples to cover the measuring range of the assay. All samples
were evaluated in replicates of two. Plasma values were compared to matched serum
values. Anticoagulants were considered non-interfering if the linear regression of
ab2GPI-G or aCL-G values from matched serum versus plasma samples has a slope
of 1.00 ± 0.2, a y-intercept of 0.0 ± 6.0 and a correlation coefficient between 0.980
and 1.000. The regression correlation parameters for the slopes, intercepts and
correlation coefficient (r) are summarized below:

N. Instrument Name:
The BioPlex® 2200 System, software version 4.0 review
O. System Descriptions:
The BioPlex® 2200 System consists of the BioPlex® 2200 Instrument, the BioPlex® 2200
family of multiplexed assays, and the BioPlex® 2200 software. The BioPlex® 2200
Instrument is an automated, self-contained, floor standing analyzer that provides an
integrated method for random access heterogeneous, multiplexed, immunodiagnostic assays.
Reactions occur in the heated incubation unit. Reagents necessary for multiplexed assays are
contained within assay-specific reagent packs that are stored onboard with refrigeration.
The BioPlex® 2200 software consists of the BioPlex® Control Module (BCM), which
includes user interface/instrument control, results analysis, assay protocols, error reporting,
maintenance scheduling, Medical Decision Support Software (MDSS), and internal quality
control. The BioPlex® 2200 system was first cleared as part of k041658 (BioPlex® 2200
ANA Screen on the BioPlex® 2200 Multi-Analyte Detection System). BioRad’s MDSS for
use with the BioPlex® was reviewed as part of k043341 for the same analyte detection
system. BioPlex® System Software, version 2.0 was reviewed in k063866.
1. Modes of Operation:
The BioPlex® 2200 is a fully-automated, random access, multiplex testing platform.
2. Software: Bio-Rad BioPlex® 2200 software version 4.0 review

--- Page 22 ---
The Device Hazard Analysis was reviewed by FDA under that submission. As indicated
in the Product Classification section, BioPlex® 2200 System Software is now at version
4.0.
3. Specimen Identification:
Samples are identified on the BioPlex® 2200 instrument by barcodes on each sample
tube, corresponding to the sample’s accession identification number.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The Instructions For Use for the BioPlex® 2200 APLS IgG and IgA kit instructs the user
to thoroughly mix thawed specimens before testing and also recommends that users
centrifuge thawed specimens prior to loading specimens on the instrument to remove
gross particulate matter. As described in BioPlex® 2200 Operation Manual, the
instrument samples specimens directly from open sample tubes.
5. Calibration:
The APLS IgG or APLS IgA Calibrator Set should be loaded and assayed at minimum in
duplicate every 30 days or with each new Reagent Pack lot. A point-to-point curve fit
algorithm, using 4 calibrators for each analyte of the APLS IgG kit and 2 calibrators for
each analyte of the APLS IgA kit, is used to establish a separate calibration curve for
each assay. Refer to the BioPlex® 2200 System Operation Manual for more information.
6. Quality Control:
Reagent Bead Quality Control: There are three quality control beads in every
BioPlex® 2200 assay. These beads serve to evaluate samples as they are processed and
report any control issues as they occur and are described below:
Reagent Blank Bead (RBB): The Reagent Blank Bead is a non-antigen coated bead that
serves to identify sample problems arising from non-specific binding.
Internal Standard Bead (ISB): The Internal Standard Bead performs fluorescence
intensity data-correction. The inherent fluorescent signal of the Internal Standard Bead is
used to detect and compensate for Detector Module fluctuations that may occur during
sample analysis.
Serum Verification Bead (SVB): The Serum Verification Bead ensures that serum or
plasma is present.
In-Kit Quality Control
BioPlex® 2200 APLS IgG (or IgA) Control Set: At the beginning of each day that the
APLS IgG or APLS IgA kit is to be used, load and process the corresponding APLS IgG
or APLS IgA Control Set as indicated in the BioPlex® 2200 System Operation Manual.
Each of the APLS IgG and APLS IgA Control Sets includes a negative control and a
positive control for each aCL IgG (or IgA) and aß2GPI IgG (or IgA) in a human serum
matrix made from defibrinated plasma, containing antibodies present for analytes within
the APLS IgG (or IgA) kit. The positive controls are manufactured to give positive
results, with values above the cutoff for each specific bead. The negative control is
manufactured to give negative results, with values below the cutoff for each specific
22

--- Page 23 ---
bead. The negative control must have a negative result, and the positive control must
have a positive result.
