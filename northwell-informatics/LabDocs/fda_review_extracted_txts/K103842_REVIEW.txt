K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
CLSI - Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices - EP05-A2
CLSI - Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Analytical Methods - EP06-A
CLSI - Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples - EP09-A2
L. Test Principle:
Glucose concentration is measured by an oxygen rate method employing a Beckman
Coulter Oxygen electrode. A sample is injected in a reaction cup containing a
glucose oxidase solution. The ratio used is one part sample to 76 parts reagent. The
peak rate of oxygen consumption is directly proportional to the concentration of
glucose in the sample. Oxygen is consumed at the same rate as glucose reacts to form
gluconic acid.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run and total imprecision studies were designed from CLSI Guideline
EP5-A2, “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement
Methods; Approved Guideline – Second Edition.” The experimental design
utilized duplicate sample analysis, twice daily, over the course of twenty
working days.
The objective of this testing was to verify the DxC v5.0 software changes at
system level has not induced inadvertent harm to the functioning of the DxC
system. This was assessed via an EP5 Random Access Precision performance
evaluation with a representative chemistry, Glucose running on DxC 800
System with the v5.0 software.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity (analytical range) studies were designed in accordance with CLSI
Guideline EP6-A. “Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement
Procedures: A Statistical Approach.”
The objective of this testing was to verify the DxC v5.0 software changes at
system level has not induced inadvertent harm to the functioning of the DxC
system. This was assessed via a linearity verification using a representative
chemistry, Glucose running on DxC 800 System with the v5.0 software.

employed Deming regression analysis to assess the data.
The objective of this testing was to verify the DxC 800 System v5.0 software
changes at system level has not induced inadvertent harm to the functioning of
the DxC system. This was assessed via a serum method comparison study on
DxC systems with the v5.0 software and comparing sample recoveries to DxC
