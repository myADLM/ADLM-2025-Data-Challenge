H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Illumigene™ C. difficile DNA amplification assay, performed on the illumipro-10, is
a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test for the direct detection of toxigenic C. difficile in
human stool specimens from pediatric and adult patients suspected of having Clostridium
difficile-associated disease (CDAD).
The Illumigene™ C. difficile assay utilizes loop-mediated isothermal DNA amplification
(LAMP) technology to detect the pathogenicity locus (PaLoc) of toxigenic Clostridium
difficile. The Clostridium difficile PaLoc is a gene segment present in all known toxigenic
C. difficile strains. The C. difficile PaLoc codes for both the Toxin A gene (tcdA) and the
Toxin B gene (tcdB), has conserved border regions, and is found at the same site on the
C. difficile genome for all toxigenic strains. The Illumigene™ C. difficile assay detects
the PaLoc by targeting a partial DNA fragment on the Toxin A gene. The tcdA target
region was selected as an intact region remaining in all known A+B+ and A-B+
toxinotypes.
Illumigene™ C. difficile is intended for use in hospital, reference or state laboratory
settings. The device is not intended for point-of-care use.

I. Device Description:
The Illumigene C. difficile DNA amplification assay utilizes loop-mediated isothermal
amplification (LAMP) technology to detect the presence of toxigenic C. difficile in patients
suspected of having C. difficile associated disease (CDAD). Each Illumigene C. difficile
assay is completed using materials provided: Illumigene Sample Preparation Apparatus,
Illumigene Reaction Buffer, Illumigene C. difficile Test Device, Sample Collection Brush,
and Illumigene Extraction Tube. Samples are prepared using the Sample Collection Brush
and the Illumigene Sample Collection Apparatus, target DNA is heat extracted in the
Extraction Tube and DNA amplification occurs in the Illumigene C. difficile Test Device.
The Illumipro-10 heats each Illumigene C. difficile Test Device containing prepared
samples, facilitating amplification of target DNA. When toxigenic C. difficile is present in
the patient sample, a cytotoxin specific sequence is amplified and magnesium pyrophosphate
is formed. As the LAMP reaction progresses, magnesium pyrophosphate forms a precipitate
in the reaction mixture. The optics system of the Illumipro-10 detects the change in light
transmission through the reaction mixture created by the precipitating Magnesium
pyrophosphate. Sample results are reported as Positive or Negative based on the detected
change in transmission.
The Illumigene e C. difficile External Control Kit consists of a Positive Control Reagent and
a Negative Control Reagent. External Control reagents are provided to aid the user in
detection of reagent deterioration, adverse environmental or test conditions, or variance in
operator performance that may lead to test errors. The Illumigene C. difficile External
Control Kit is required for routine Quality Control.

L. Test Principle:
The illumigene C. difficile Assay is based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification
technology (LAMP). Loop-mediated amplification is accomplished by the use of specially
designed primers that provide specific and continuous isothermal DNA amplification.
Magnesium-pyrophosphate is produced as a by-product of LAMP amplification. The
magnesium-pyrophosphate forms a white precipitate in the reaction solution, giving the
reaction solution a turbid appearance. The presence of turbidity signifies a positive reaction
while the absence of turbidity represents a negative reaction.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
Analytical studies were conducted in the original submission K100818. No
modifications were made to the device that would affect the Precision/Reproducibility,
Analytical Specificity, or Limits of Detection. The change was for the addition of testing
pediatric patients.
