L. Test Principle:
The test is based on electrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of
capillary action. The electrical current generated by the reaction of glucose with
the reagent of the strip is measured by the meter and is displayed as the
corresponding blood glucose level. The strength of the current produced by the
reaction depends on the amount of glucose in the blood sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed precision studies in accordance with the ISO
15197 and CLSI EP-5A. Venous whole blood adjusted to 5 glucose levels
with hematocrit ~40% was used for within-day precision studies. Each
concentration was tested 10 times using three test strip lots, for a total of
100 tests per blood glucose level. Results are summarized below:
Within Day precision:
Sample Level Mean SD (mg/dL) CV (%)
(mg/dL) (mg/dL)
30 -50 43.9 1.4 3.17
51 -110 95.8 2.7 2.86
111 -150 131.8 4.4 3.33
151 - 250 207.7 6.8 3.26
251 - 400 317.0 10.5 3.31
In addition to the study above, the sponsor also evaluated day-to-day precision
using control solutions with three concentration levels of glucose (45 mg/dL,
120 mg/dL and 320 mg/dL). Day-to-day precision was evaluated over a 10
day period with, three lots of test strips, and 10 meters. Results are
summarized below:

120 mg/dL 126.6 3.6 2.83
320 mg/dL 310.1 6.4 2.07
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor performed linearity studies using whole blood samples with 11
different glucose concentration levels covering the full measuring range (20-
600 mg/dL). Measurements were taken 5 times for each level and the values
of the AG-608N meter were compared to those obtained from the YSI-2300.
Linear regression analysis is summarized below:
y = 0.9959x + 2.6769, r2 = 0.9983
The measuring range of the AG-608 N Single/Multi Blood Glucose
Monitoring Systems is 20 - 600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor claims that the system accuracy of the AG-608 N Single/Multi
Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems is calibrated to a laboratory analyzer, YSI
2300. See comparison studies in 2a below.
One levels of control material, Level II (96 to 144 mg/dL) is available for use
with this test system.
Value assignment:
The control solutions (Level I 30-50 mg/dL; Level II 96-144 mg/dL and Level
III 280-420 mg/dL) are prepared in an aqueous matrix. Value assignment
was established using 5 glucose meters and 100 test strips from one test strip
lot. The control range for each control solution is listed on the test strip vial. The
final control ranges, printed on the vials, are within ±10 mg/dL for Level I and
±10% of the mean value for Level I and II. The expected results may change
with each new lot. However, in the package insert, the user is directed to
compare their control result with the range printed on the test strip vial.
Stability:
Control solution and test strip stability was assessed with accelerated studies
and on-going real-time studies. Testing supports the claimed shelf life of 24
month shelf-life when stored at 39 to 86°F (2-30°C) with relative humidity of

<80% and a 90 day stability after opening when stored at 39 to 86°F with
relative humidity of <80 %.
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the devices is 20-600 mg/dL. This range was
validated via the linearity study (see section M.1.b.).
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed interference studies with spiked venous blood samples
at three glucose concentrations (~80, 120 and 350 mg/dL) that were prepared
and divided into a test (dosed) pool and a control pool. The potential
interferants (2 levels) were added to the sample and each sample was tested 5
times. The table below lists all substances tested at concentrations with
insignificant (<10%) interference:

The sponsor conducted an accuracy study to demonstrate that the accuracy of
the candidate device is equivalent to the reference method, YSI 2300. Testing
was performed with 2 trained operators and a total of 100 capillary samples.
The total range of samples tested was 25-537 mg/dL. Samples <40 mg/dL and
>400 mg/dL were glycolyzed or spiked. Distribution of blood glucose
concentration across the samples tested was in accordance with the ISO15197.
The studies met the ISO 15197 accuracy criteria where ninety-five percent
(95%) of the individual glucose results shall fall within ±15mg/dL of the
results at glucose concentrations <75mg/dL and within ±20% at glucose
concentrations ≥75mg/dL. Linear regression results are presented below:

3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied
directly to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger and
other alternative sites (palm, forearm, upper-arm, calf and thigh). Since the whole
blood sample is applied directly to the test strip, there are no special handling or
storage issues.
5. Calibration:
Auto-coding: No calibration is required from the user, since all test strips have
the same one-code.
6. Quality Control:
One level of glucose control solution (Level II), is provided within the kit from
the sponsor. An additional two levels Level I and Level III are available for
purchase separately, as stated in the labeling. The labeling provides instructions
on when to test control materials.. If the test results fall outside the range printed
on the test strip vial, the user is instructed to contact the Customer Care Line at 1-

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Altitude Study: An altitude study was performed in an altitude simulation
chamber with whole blood samples obtained from 20 volunteers with the glucose
range of 66 to 420 mg/dL. Each sample was tested with 4 glucose meters and
one test strip lot. The study protocol, data and acceptance criteria of ±10
individual bias across the entire testing range were provided and found to be
adequate. Altitudes up to 10,744 feet (3,275m) do not affect test results.
2. Hematocrit Study:
A study to evaluate the effect of hematocrit was conducted on samples with 7
glucose concentrations (~25, ~75, ~150, ~270, ~380, ~470 and ~570 mg/dL).
distributed across the measuring range and tested at 10 hematocrit levels (20,
25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, and 65%). Each glucose level/hematocrit
combination was tested in duplicate of 10 using two test strip lots and 2 glucose
meters. Results of samples at each hematocrit level were compared to samples
with the same glucose concentration at normal (40%) hematocrit as well as to the
corresponding YSI value. All results were within + 15% individual bias
supporting the claimed hematocrit range of 20-60%.
3. Specimen volume study: A study was performed using samples in the range of
47 to 465 mg/dL to evaluate effect of different sample volumes (2.0μL, 1.0μL, 0.7
μL, 0.6μL and 0.5μL) on the performance of this device. Results of samples at
each sample volume tested were compared to the corresponding YSI values.
Results from these studies support the claimed sample volume of 0.7µL.
4. Lay user questionnaire: Lay users evaluated the ease of use of the device and
the presentation of the labeling. All users thought that the AG-608 N/ AG-608 N
MULTI Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems were easy to use and most answered
“easy” and “very easy” to each question.
5. Disinfection studies: Infection Control Studies: The devices are intended for
single-patient use (AG-608N Single Blood Glucose Monitoring System) or
multiple-patient use (AG-608N Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System).
Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the
meters and lancing device by outside commercial testing demonstrating complete
inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, CaviWipes
(EPA Registration #46781-8). Robustness studies were also performed by the
sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external
materials for each of the meters and lancing device after 11,000 cleanings and
11,000 disinfection steps with the CaviWipes. The robustness studies were
12

--- Page 13 ---
designed to stimulate 3 years of multiple-patient use and 5 years of single-patient
use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning
and disinfection procedures.
6. Data transfer study: The 40 study participants, following instructions in User’s
manual, were able to transmit results from the meter to the PC application
(cleared under k102678) via USB. The study participants ranged in age,
education, and were about equally divided between males and females. Those
study participants also completed a questionnaire in response to whether the data
transmission feature is easy to use. The sponsor concluded that the users’
responses indicated that data transmission function was easy to operate by
following the User’s manuals.
7. Temperature and Humidity studies: The sponsor performed temperature and
humidity studies using the AG-608 N glucose meter with venous whole blood
samples at 5 glucose levels (<50, 50-100, 101-200, 201 – 400, >401 mg/dL).
Results demonstrated that AG-608 N (meters and test strips) can be stored under
conditions of 39 to 86°F and relative humidity of <80%. The test strip labeling
states to store the test strips in a cool dry place between 39 to 86°F. Therefore, the
storage conditions for the glucose meter listed in the User’s manuals and
supported by the studies are 39 to 86°F and <80% humidity.
8. Open-vial-in-use test strip studies were performed at the combined extremes of
10±2°C (46.4-56.3°F) RH: 12 %, 10±2°C RH:88%, 40±2°C (100.4- 107.6°F)
RH:11 %, and 40±2°C RH:88% with venous whole blood samples at 3 glucose
levels (~70, ~120 and 300 mg/dL). The study protocol, study data when
individual measurements were compared to the YSI were reviewed and found to
be adequate. Therefore, the operating conditions stated in the User’s manual and
supported by the studies are 50 to 104°F (10 to 40°C) with relative humidity of
25% to 80%.
9. The sponsor provided a readability study and obtained SMOG grade level
scores of 8.0 or lower for the User’s Manual, test strip insert and control insert.
10. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing was performed/passed and a
certificate to Andon was provided.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
