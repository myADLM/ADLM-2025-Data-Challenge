I. Device Description:
HemosIL® dRVVT Screen and Confirm assay uses diluted Russell viper venom to
detect lupus anticoagulant. HemosIL dRVVT Screen assays are a lyophilized reagent
containing a low concentration of phospholipids, anti-heparin agents, calcium, buffer,
stabilizers and a dye. The HemosIL® dRVVT Confirm assay has a higher
concentration of phospholipids than the HemosIL® Screen assay. Both assays
together are to be used as part of profile to detect lupus anticoagulants. HemosIL
dRVVT Screen and Confirm assays are packaged as 10- 2ml vials. HemosIL® LAC
assays are the parent assay to the HemosIL dRVVT Screen and Confirm. The assays
differ based on current in-house manufacturing and prolonged assay stability claims.
dRVVT Screen and Confirm are an integrated test as referenced in the ISTH 2009
committee recommendation for Lupus Anticoagulant Detection.

L. Test Principle:
Lupus Anticoagulants (LA) belongs to the group of antiphospholipid antibodies which
are directed against negatively-charged phospholipids or complexes between
phospholipids and proteins (either β-2-glycoprotein I or clotting factors such as
prothrombin). When determined by their ability to prolong phospholipid-dependent tests
(APTT, SCT, dRVVT), these antibodies are referred as LA. Patients with LA are at
increased risk of clinical complications such as thrombosis and recurrent miscarriages.
The dRVVT Screen and dRVVT Confirm assays are improved dRVVT reagents intended
to simplify and standardize the detection of LA in clinical evaluations1, 3. The dRVVT
Screen assay is poor in phospholipid, making it sensitive to LA. The additional amount of
phospholipid (bi-layers) in dRVVT Confirm neutralizes LA to give shorter clotting times.
Russell’s Viper Venom, in the presence of calcium, directly activates factor X (in the test
sample). The dRVVT Screen and dRVVT Confirm assays are therefore unaffected by
contact factor abnormalities, factor VII, VIII and IX deficiencies or inhibitors. Heparin
interference up to 1 U/mL is neutralized by polybrene. As a result, dRVVT Screen and
dRVVT Confirm are more specific tests for the evaluation of LA than APTT.
dRVVT Screen and Confirm are being used as an integrated test as referenced in the
ISTH 2009 committee recommendation for Lupus Anticoagulant Detection.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed on three reagent lots of HemosIL® dRVVT
Screen and Confirm analyzing three lots of HemosIL® LA Negative, Weak Pos
and Positive controls. Results (clotting time in seconds) were determined from
testing two runs per day over 20 days on three ACP TOP family (ACL TOP base
and ACL TOP 500CTS) analyzers according to CLSI EP5-A2. The mean, SD and
95% CI were calculated for each analyte. The %CV of the average clotting times
was < 5% and was within the acceptance criteria of ≤ 6% for repeatability and ≤
6% for reproducibility. The acceptance criteria are based on the normalized ratio
value:
Level 1: HemosIL® Negative control: NR ≤1.10 (k102552)
Level 2: HemosIL® LA Weak Positive: NR ≥1.25 and <1.40 (In-house)
Level 3: HemosIL LA Positive control: ≥1.40 (k102252)

Summary results of the precision study are as follows:
ACL TOP Family Mean(Normalized dRVVT Ratio)
LA Negative Control 1.00
Weakly LA Positive 1.35
LA Positive Control 1.77
HemosIL® dRVVT NR
Samples Within Run %CV Between Run % CV

Positive
LA Positive 1.5 0.9 1.1 4.4 3.4 2.5
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The reconstituted stability of the HemosIL® dRVVT Screen and HemosIL®
dRVVT Confirm reagents were assessed by longitudinal studies. With criteria
of an age-related trend and a maximum shift of 6% of the zero point clotting
time, the predicted reconstituted stability of the HemosIL® dRVVT Screen
and HemosIL® dRVVT Confirm reagents are 15 days when reconstituted and
stored at 2-8°C, 3 days on board stability when stored at 15°C and up to a 2
year lyophilized shelf life at 2-8°C. (based on accelerated study). Real time
stability testing is on-going for the 2 yr shelf life.
d. Detection limit:
Not Applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were determined on the ACL TOP instrument family line
(ACL TOP, ACL TOP 500CTS) for HemosIL® dRVVT Screen and Confirm.
Interferents were spiked into 3 levels of pooled normal plasma, weak LA
positive plasma and high LA positive plasma at various concentrations with
acceptance criteria of ≤15% compared to the un-spiked control results. The
maximum concentrations of the study are:

b. Matrix comparison:
A study comparing 3.2% versus 3.8% citrated plasma was performed.
Two blood samples were drawn, from 26 donors, using both a 3.2% and
3.8% sodium citrate sample tubes respectively. The plasma from each
donor was promptly recovered from the sample by centrifugation, in
accordance with the updated 2009 ISTH guideline for Lupus anticoagulant
detection. Two pools, with different sodium citrate concentrations, were
prepared using the same volume of citrated plasma from each donor.
Artificial LA-Positive samples were prepared by spiking with different
amounts of β2gPl antibodies to produce a range of concentrations. A total
of 24 pairs of samples were prepared in this manner. The results of the
study based on statistical analysis meeting the outlined specifications are
as follows:
3.8 v. 3.2% Na
Citrate PPA CI 95% NPA CI 95%
ACL TOP 19/19 -100% 83.2-100% 24/26 (92%) 75.9-97.9%
A fresh vs. frozen study was conducted in which 26 sample from normal
patients were spiked with different concentration of ß2gPL antibodies. A
set of the 26 samples were maintained at room temperature while another
set of the 26 samples were frozen at -64°C for 24 hours and thawed at
room temperature. Both sets of samples were tested on the ACL TOP and
the test results calculated based the established normalized ratio cutoff.
The compared normalized ratio for both sets of frozen ad room
temperature samples were expressed as positive and negative result
agreement (PPA and NPA) as the following:
Fresh vs. Frozen PPA CI 95% NPA CI 95%
ACL TOP 28/28 (100%) 87.9% -100% 26/26 (100%) 87.1% -100%
