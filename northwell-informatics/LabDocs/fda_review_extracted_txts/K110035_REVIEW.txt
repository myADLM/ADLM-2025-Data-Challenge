L. Test Principle:
Glucose is phosphorylated by ATP, in a reaction catalyzed by hexokinase (HK). The
glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) formed is oxidated to 6-phosphogluconate (6-PG) by glucose-
6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-P-DH). In this same reaction an equimolar amount of NAD
is reduced to NADH, with a resulting increase in absorbance at 340 nm. The increased
absorbance is directly proportional to the amount of glucose in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed using CLSI document EP5-A2 as guideline. Three
levels of commercial control material were evaluated on three Indiko Clinical
Chemistry Analyzers using three glucose reagent lots, with two runs per day and two
replicates per run over 20 days. The total number of measurements was n = 84. The
results are summarized below.

A second precision study was performed using lithium heparin samples at three glucose
levels. CLSI document EP5-A2 was used as a guideline; however the study was
performed for 10 days. Samples were evaluated on one Indiko analyzer, with two runs
per day and two replicates per run, with the number of measurements being n = 40. The
results are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study across the claimed assay range 5-720 mg/dL was performed by
preparing two plasma samples with very low and high glucose concentrations. The
low and high pools were mixed in different proportions to create nine dilutions.
Eleven samples in all were assayed in triplicate
Data was analyzed using 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order least square regressions according to
CLSI protocol EP6-A. Based on the analysis the sponsor determined that second
order regression was the best fit and yielded the following equation:
Second order: y = -4.075E-05x2 + 1.028x -0.03861, Std. Error 4.242
Based on these results, the sponsor claims that the assay is linear from 5-720 mg/dL
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrator (sCal) and multi-analyte controls (Nortrol and Abtrol) were previously
cleared under k061107.
The expected values and value assignment process were reviewed for this test system.
The value sheet for sCal, Nortrol, and Abtrol will specify values for Indiko.
d. Detection limit:
A detection limit study was performed using CLSI EP17-A as a guide. The sponsor
performed the following studies. Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by running a
blank sample (saline) 96 times total on two Indiko analyzers with two lots of Glucose
(HK) reagent. The limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) was
determined by assaying 3 low glucose concentration plasma samples on two Indiko
analyzers and two reagent lots over two days, for a total of 42 replicates each.
The sponsor states that the LoB represents the highest measurement result that is

Within Device
(Total)	0.8	1.6	1.8	1.5	3.2	1.5

--- Page 7 ---
likely to be observed for an analyte-free sample. LoB is equal to 0.54 mg/dL. The
LoD/LoQ represents the lowest actual concentration in a sample that can be
quantitatively determined. The LoD/LoQ is stated to be 0.54 mg/dL
The claimed lower limit of the measuring range is 5 mg/dL. Glucose values <5 mg/dL
are flagged “Test limit low” by the analyzer.
e. Analytical specificity:
Testing for endogenous interfering substances was based on CLSI EP-7A2. Testing
was performed on a minimum of five concentrations for each potential interferant.
Plasma samples with three glucose levels, low level 74-77 mg/dl, middle level 109-
112 mg/dl and high level 271-278 mg/dl were used in the evaluation. Samples with
the interferents were tested and compared to the same sample without the interferent
(control).
The sponsor defined non-significant interference as the highest level tested that
recovers within ±5% of the control sample.
Based on the studies performed the results support the following claims:
Hemolysis: No interference found up to 1000 mg/dL of hemoglobin.
Bilirubin (conjugated): No interference found up to 47 mg/dL.
Bilirubin (unconjugated): No interference found up to 50 mg/dL.
Lipemia: No interference found up to 1000 mg/dL of Intralipid®.
The labeling refers users to information on other potentially interfering substances
(Young, D.S. Effect of Drugs on Clinical Laboratory Tests, Fifth Edition, AACC
Presss, 2000).
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed using CLSI document EP9-A2 as a
guide. One hundred and seventeen (117) lithium plasma samples were analyzed with
the Indiko Glucose test system and the DPC T60 glucose test system. Of these
samples, 101 were neat lithium plasma. Twelve (12) were spiked to create samples
with high glucose and four (4) were diluted to create samples with very low glucose.
The results are summarized below.
