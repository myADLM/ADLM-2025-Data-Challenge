H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Refer to indications for use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
For in vitro diagnostic use as a control for calibration verification of the
IMMULITE Unconjugated Estriol (uE3) assays on the IMMULITE/IMMULITE
1000 and 2000 systems.
The calibration verification material is assayed control with four levels. The
analyte levels for IMMULITE 1000 are 0.00, 0.016, 2.70, and 11.2 ng/mL and
0.00, 0.19, 2.90, and 12.0 ng/mL for IMMULITE 2000 systems. The matrix is
estriol in processed horse serum.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For in vitro diagnostic use. For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The IMMULITE Unconjugated Estriol (uE3) Calibration Verification Material
(CVM) is intended for use with the IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 and 2000
systems.
I. Device Description:
The IMMULITE uE3 CVM consists of one set of four vials, 2 mL each, containing
low, intermediate, and high levels of unconjugated estriol in processed horse serum,
with preservative. The first level is an unconjugated estriol-free sample. The
IMMULITE uE3 CVM levels are supplied in liquid form, ready to use.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The IMMULITE Unconjugated Estriol (uE3) Calibration Verification
Material is traceable to an internal reference calibrator. Reference calibrators
are traceable to individual human samples assigned with GC-MS values.
Expected Values and Value Ranges
Expected values for the IMMULITE uE3 CVM are determined by analyses of
40 replicates at each control level using three kit lots and three systems
(IMMULITE/IMMULITE 1000 or IMMULITE 2000 systems). Pre-
determined acceptance criteria for analyte recovery must be met for each
calibrator lot. Calibrator assigned values are lot dependent as specified in the
product labeling.
Stability
Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria for the IMMULITE uE3
CVM were reviewed and found acceptable. The manufacturer claims a shelf
life stability of 6 months at the recommended storage temperatures of 2-8°C.
