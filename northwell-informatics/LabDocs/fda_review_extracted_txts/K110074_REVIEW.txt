L. Test Principle:
The test principle is based on electrochemical biosensor technology using glucose
oxidase methodology. Each test strip reacts with glucose in the blood sample to
produce a current proportional to the blood glucose level. This reaction is measured
by the meter and displayed as the blood glucose result.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To evaluate the precision of the HL568 Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose
System, within-run and total-run studies were performed. For the within-run
precision study, ten measurements were obtained with ten glucose meters
using two test strip lots on six levels of venous blood samples (n =100
measurements on each test strip at each level).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the device was evaluated using a protocol based on CLSI
EP6-A. Testing was performed using venous blood samples at ten different
blood glucose levels, ranging from 0 to 600 mg/dL, on two lots of test strips,
by five meters. The YSI 2300 glucose analyzer was used as the reference
method. The sponsor claimed a measuring range of 20 to 600 mg/dL for their
proposed device. The results were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
Linear Regression Analysis:
Lot 1: y = 1.0728x – 2.4977, r2= 0.9936.
Lot 2: y = 1.0231x + 2.4535, r2= 0.9964.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Two levels of Control Solution (Level 1 and 2) are included with each test kit.
For each glucose control solution, a reference measurement was taken using
an YSI 2300 analyzer. Forty measurements were performed (4 bottles * 10
measurements/per bottle) for each glucose control solution and the mean
value, SD and CV were calculated. Level 1 and 2 glucose solutions were
found to have ranges of 89-111 mg/dL, mean of 100 mg/dL (YSI Value: 76
mg/dL) and 247-305 mg/dL, mean of 280 mg/dL (YSI Value: 248 mg/dL),
respectively.
Stability characteristics of both levels of Glucose Control Solutions were
determined using real time studies at 45°C and 90% humidity. The sponsor
claimed open and unopened vial stabilities are 3 and 20 months, respectively.
For the test strips, open vial (stored at 40°C and 90% humidity) and unopened
shelf-life (stored at 40°C and 90% humidity) stability were determined using
real-time studies. The sponsor claimed an open vial stability of 90 days and an
unopened shelf-life stability of 9 months for the test strips.
d. Detection limit:
Please see the linearity study data in Section M1b above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was assessed by spiking various endogenous and
exogenous substances at therapeutic and toxic levels into whole blood samples
at three glucose concentrations (60, 250 and 500 mg/dL) that were prepared
and divided into a test (dosed) pool and a control pool. Studies were
conducted using five HL568 Blood Glucose Meters and two lots of test strips.
Significant interference is defined as a bias ≥ 10 % from the control group as
measured on YSI 2300 analyzer. Interference was observed for the substances
and concentrations shown in the table below:

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
A user performance study was performed to compare the lay user self-test
results (with fingertip) and the YSI method. The study was conducted at three
sites with 205 subjects. Each lay user participant performed their own finger
stick and tested their blood on the HL568 Blood Glucose meter using only the
instructions in the Owner’s Booklet and test strip insert. A trained operator
then performed a second finger stick and tested the blood on the same meter.
A venous blood sample was collected by the trained operator for hematocrit
determination and analysis on the YSI 2300 analyzer. The total range of
samples tested was 50 to 415 mg/dL. Linear regression results are presented
below:
Linear Regression Analysis:
Lay user vs. YSI y = 1.01x + 1.03, r = 0.982, n = 205

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
· A usability study was performed to assess the readability of the labeling by
recruiting 100 lay users (aged 18-70 yrs old) who were provided with the test
kit containing labeling for the US market. Participants varied in age,
education, country of origin, and were about evenly divided between men and
women. These lay users also completed a questionnaire in response to whether
the device is easy to use and whether the Instructions for use were written in a
way that makes it easy to use. The majority of the users responded that the
device is very easy to use.
· Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the results showed
that the labeling (User Manual, test strip package insert and control solution
package insert) were written at less than an 8th grade level.
· A sample volume study was performed to verify the test strip sample volume
requirement and the test strip fill error requirement established for the HL568
BGMS. Whole blood adjusted to four glucose concentrations (50, 120, 350
and 550 mg/dL) were measured with five meters and two test strip lots. Blood
9

--- Page 10 ---
at each concentration was applied to strips at sample volumes of 0.6 µL, 0.8
µL and 1.0 µL. Protocols and acceptance criteria were provided and found to
be acceptable. Insufficient volume of less than 1.0 µL will produce an error
message which alerts the user to an insufficient sample volume.
· The device system is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection
efficacy studies using Hepatitis B surface antigen were performed on the
materials comprising the meter and lancing device demonstrating complete
inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) using Clorox Germicidal Wipes (EPA
registration # 67619-12). The sponsor demonstrated that there was no change
in performance or in the external materials of the meter or the lancing device
after 8,000 cleaning and 8,000 disinfection cycles designed to simulate 5 years
of device use. Labeling has been reviewed for adequate instructions in
validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
· The data transmission capability, data transmission port, H &L Glucose Data
Transmission Software and USB connection cable was evaluated in usability
study and found to be acceptable. Additionally verification and validation of
these functions were conducted and found to be acceptable.
· Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing was performed, all
requirements were met and a certificate was issued to Health and Life Co.,
Ltd.
· Hematocrit Study: Venous blood samples with varying hematocrit levels
(29%, 42% and 56%) were tested at four glucose concentrations (50, 120, 350
and 550 mg/dL) against the YSI-2300 Glucose Analyzer. Each glucose
level/hematocrit combination was tested on five meters and two test strip lots.
The differences of the glucose meter results at each hematocrit/glucose
combination were calculated against YSI-2300 Glucose Analyzer results at
42% hematocrit. The bias relative to YSI was that all results fell within ±15
%. The results were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor
claimed a hematocrit range of 30% to 55% for their proposed device.
· Altitude Study: A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of altitude on the
HL568 BGMS. Using ten glucose meters and one test strip lot, venous blood
samples at five glucose concentrations (50, 165, 270, 380 and 500 mg/dL)
were measured at five elevations (167; 6,450; 8,088; 9,082; 10,073 and 10,309
feet above sea level). Each venous blood sample was also tested by the YSI
2300 analyzer. The meter readings obtained were compared to the YSI
measurement at the same altitude and the percent bias was determined at each
level against the YSI results. Bias was within ± 10% for up to 10,073 feet.
Based on the data, the sponsor claims that the HL568 BMGS can be used at
altitude up to 10,000 feet.

--- Page 11 ---
· Temperature and humidity studies: Studies were performed to demonstrate
that the HL568 meter can be used at combinations of extreme temperatures
from 10 to 40 °C and humidity conditions ranging from 38 to 82 %. The
performance of the proposed device was evaluated on three venous blood
samples (120, 250 and 450 mg/dL) using 5 meters and 2 test strip lots.
Duplicate measurements were taken for each condition. The sponsor claimed
a temperature range of 10 to 40oC and humidity range of 10-80% for their
proposed device. The YSI 2300 glucose analyzer was used to check the
glucose concentrations of the samples. The bias relative to YSI was that all
results fell within ±10%. The results were reviewed and found to be
acceptable.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
