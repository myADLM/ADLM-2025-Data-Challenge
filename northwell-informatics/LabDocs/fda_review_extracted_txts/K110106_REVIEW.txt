Prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
For use with the VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems
I. Device Description:
VITEK 2 AST card containing the test is inoculated with a standardized suspension of
the organism to be tested. The VITEK 2 System automatically fills, seals, and places
the card into the incubator/reader while the VITEK 2 Compact System has manual
filling, sealing and loading operation. The incubated card is optically monitored by
the VITEK 2 Systems for growth within each well in the card throughout the
incubation cycle. At the completion of incubation, results are automatically calculated
once a predetermined growth threshold is reached. A report is then generated that
contains the MIC value and the interpretive category result (S, I, R) for each
antibiotic contained on the card.
The MIC ranges, interpretive criteria and equivalent concentrations for testing
Enterobacteriaceae are as follows:

L. Test Principle:
Automated growth based detection using attenuation of light measured by an optical
scanner. The optics used in the systems use visible light to directly measure organism
growth. Transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before
significant growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same
well measure organism growth by how much light is prevented from going through
the well. The VITEK 2 System monitors the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period of time. An interpretive call is made between 4 and 16 hours for a

“rapid” read but may be extended to 18 hours in some instances. At the completion of
the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the
interpretive category result for each antibiotic on the card. The VITEK 2 AST Gram
Negative card has the following Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole concentrations of
1/19, 4/76, and 16/304 µg/mL. The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 card is ≤20
(1/19) to ≥320 (16/304) µg/mL.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was conducted at three study sites. Ten Gram Negative
isolates were tested at each site and testing was performed in triplicate over
three days with VITEK 2 AST GN-SXT. The testing was performed using
both the manual dilution method and the automated dilution mode. Testing
was conducted on the VITEK 2 instrument.
For the sake of reproducibility calculations, off-scale values are handled in
two ways; “best case” and “worst case” scenarios. Best case calculation for
reproducibility assumes the off-scale result is within one well from the mode
MIC value. Worst case calculation for reproducibility assuming the off-scale
result is greater than one well from the mode MIC value.
The overall reproducibility was >95% with +/- one dilution observation. For
Automatic Dilution, the VITEK 2 AST GN-SXT gave overall reproducibility
values of 97.8% and 87.8% based on best case and worst case calculations,
respectively. For Manual Dilution, the VITEK 2 AST GN-SXT gave overall
reproducibility values of 98.2% and 88.5% based on best case and worst case
calculations, respectively.
A similar reproducibility study was conducted by testing on the VITEK 2
Compact instrument. The VITEK 2 AST GN-SXT card gave a reproducibility
of 100% by Manual Dilution. Only Manual Dilution testing was conducted
since the VITEK 2 Compact system does not have a functionality to support
automatic dilution to inoculate the card.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended QC isolates were tested on every test occasion with the
reference method and the VITEK 2 System. The reference method QC results
were in range for every day tested. The VITEK 2 and reference testing was
5

--- Page 6 ---
performed a minimum of twenty times by each method at each site. There
were some instances were either VITEK or reference results were out of
range. In such instances where any organism was out of range for the
reference method, all data from that day’s testing was considered invalid and
that day’s testing was repeated.
Quality Control was performed during the studies using both the auto-dilution
and the manual method of diluting the organisms on the VITEK 2 System.
Results demonstrated that methods were comparable.

Quality Control results for the VITEK 2 System using either inoculation
dilution method demonstrated that the VITEK 2 System could produce the
expected QC ranges with an acceptable rate.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Performance was established through a clinical study which was conducted at
three external sites. A total of 280 clinical isolates were tested by VITEK 2
AST GN-SXT with the VITEK® 2 System. The vast majority of the isolates
were recently isolated from clinical specimens. A challenge set consisting of
87 isolates was also evaluated. Testing was done using the VITEK 2 AST GN-
SXT and the broth microdilution method using cation-adjusted Mueller
Hinton (MH) broth. The MH broth was incubated at 35°C in ambient air for
up to 16-20 hours. The inoculum was prepared with direct colony suspension.
The testing included both fresh clinical isolates and stock isolates along with a
challenge set with known results. Two methods of inoculation (manual and
auto dilution) were evaluated. Clinical testing was performed using the
automated method of inoculation and the challenge set was tested using both
the manual and the auto dilution method. A comparison was provided to the
reference method with the following agreement.

Essential agreement (EA) is when the VITEK 2 panels agree with the
reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the
reference method. Category agreement (CA) is when the VITEK 2 panel
result interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result
interpretation. Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the
VITEK 2 and the reference and have on-scale EA.
No evaluation could be made on the basis of EA because of the small number
of evaluable results. However, CA was 100% for both clinical and challenge
isolates. Also, another study on the VITEK 2 Compact Systems demonstrated
acceptable CA (See below).
A total of 87 Challenge Enterobacteriaceae isolates were also tested in the
VITEK 2 Compact using the manual dilution method. A comparison was
provided to the reference method with the following agreement.
