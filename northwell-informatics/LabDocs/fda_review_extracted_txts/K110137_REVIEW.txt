K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
• CLSI Guideline EP5-A2
• CLSI Guideline EP6-A
• CLSI Guideline EP9-A2
• CLSI Guideline EP17-A
L. Test Principle:
This enzymatic method for creatinine utilizes a multi-step approach ending with a
photometric end-point reaction. The enzyme creatinine amidohydrolase is used to convert
creatinine to creatine. Creatine is broken down to sarcosine and urea by creatine
amidinohydrolase. Further enzyme linked steps with sarcosine oxidase and peroxidase yield a
colored chromogen read at 545nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Study Protocol:
Within run precision was established by assaying two levels of control and
patient samples 20 times in a single run. Total precision was established by assaying the
same set of samples in duplicate twice a day for 20 days. The results are summarized
below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Study Protocol:
Linearity was evaluated following CLSI guideline EP6-A. For serum linearity, a spiked
serum sample was used as the high sample and a diluted serum sample (2x in 0.9% NaCl)
was used as the low sample. The intermediate concentrations in creatinine were prepared
by serial dilution of the highest sample using the low sample as the diluents. For urine
linearity, a spiked urine sample was used as the high sample and 0.9% NaCl was used as
the low sample. For both studies, the mean of 4 replicate measurements were used in the
regression analysis.
Summary:
Based on results of the linearity study and the limit of detection study (see below in d ),
the sponsor claimed that the reportable range for the serum assay is 0.11-16.95 mg/dL,
the reportable range for urine assay is 3.55-175 mg/dL. The sponsor has also provided
data to support that automatic dilution can go up to 50.85 mg/dL for serum and 846.9
mg/dL for urine.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The ABX PENTRA enzymatic creatinine assay, calibrators, and controls are traceable to
NIST reference material SRM909b.
Stability:
Real-time testing was conducted. The stability study protocol and the acceptance criteria
have been reviewed and found to be acceptable. The study results support the following
stability claims in the labeling:
Closed-Vial and Open-Vial Stability
Item Storage Conditions Claimed Stability

Urine Controls Close-Vial 2-8oC 2 years
Open-Vial 2-8oC 30 days
Calibration Interval:
Stability across a 14 day calibration interval was assessed by calculating the percentage
bias of 2 control specimens on each day from the result obtained on day 0. The results
support the product claim of a 14-day calibration interval. The sponsor also noted in the
labeling that a recalibration is recommended when reagent lots change, and when quality
control results fall outside the range established.
Value Assignment:
• Calibrators: The target value is determined by the median of 150 results from 6 ABX
PENTRA 400 analyzers. The median is acceptable when percentage deviation is less
than 10%.
• Controls: The target value is determined by the median of 150 results from 6 ABX
PENTRA 400 analyzers. The median is acceptable when percentage deviation is less
than 10%. The lot specific range was assigned as mean ± 3 SD. If 3 SD > 20%
compared to the target value, the acceptable percentage will be of 20%, if 3SD <10%
compared to the target values, the acceptable percentage will be 10%.
d. Detection limit:
Study Protocol:
Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined following CLSI
guideline EP17-A. For LoB determination, 0.9% NaCl was used as the Zero sample and
assayed 90 times on 3 different Pentra 400 instruments. For LoD determination, 4 altered
serum or urine samples with creatinine concentrations between LoB and 4xLoB were
assayed 20 times for each sample.
For LoQ determination, a range of low concentration samples were prepared by 10%
serial dilution and were assayed 10 times for each sample. The CV% and the bias at each
tested concentration were calculated. LoQ is defined as the lowest concentration that
meets CV% < 15% and the relative bias is in the +/-10% range.
Summary:
Based on the limit of quantitation determined in this study (see result in the below table)
and the result from the linearity study in M1 b, the sponsor claimed a detection limit of
3.56 mg/dL in the labeling.
LoB LoD LoQ
Serum 0.011 mg/dl 0.026 mg/dl 0.11 mg/dl
Urine 0.011 mg/dl 0.66 mg/dl 1.71 mg/dl

e. Analytical specificity:
• Interference
Study Protocol:
The sponsor evaluated the effect of the interfering substances following the Valtec
guideline (Vassault et al., Ann. Biol. Clin., 1986, (44), 686-745).
Pooled serum/urine samples with low and high levels of creatinine (approximately 1.5
mg/dL, 6.5 mg/dL in the serum pools, and 11 mg/dL and 88 mg/dL in the urine pools)
were used as the base samples. Each interfering substance was added to the base samples
and tested at 4 different concentrations.
Result Summary:
Based on the sponsor-defined limit of ± 5% bias between sample with and without
interfering substances, the following claims were made:
(cid:153) Serum assay:
The below compounds at the indicated concentration do not cause significant
interference with the serum assay.
Compound Concentration up to
Haemoglobin 500 mg/dL
Triglycerides 612.5 mg/dL
Total Bilirubin 27.4 mg/dL
Direct Bilirubin 9.9 mg/dL
(cid:153) Urine assay:
The below compounds at the indicated concentration do not cause significant
interference with the serum assay.
