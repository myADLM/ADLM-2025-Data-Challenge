CDT CAL is a liquid human serum based product containing carbohydrate-deficient
transferring. CDT CAL is packed in 4 vials containing 2.0 ml calibrator material per vial.
Dimension Vista® CDT CON L and CON H
CDT CON L and CON H are liquid human serum based products containing human
carbohydrate-deficient transferrin. CDT CON L and CDT CON H are packaged in 4 vials
containing 2.0 ml quality control material per vial.
All human source materials were tested and found to be negative for HIV ½, HBsAg, and
HCV by FDA- approved methods.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
EP-5A2 Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods
Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff-Assayed and Unassayed Quality Control Material
L. Test Principle:
Not applicable
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The Dimension Vista CDT controls and calibrator are traceable to an internally
produced master calibrator which is calibrated against a highly purified in-house
protein preparation.
Stability
Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable. Stability characteristics of the Dimension CDT controls and calibrators
were determined using real-time stability studies. The Dimension CDT controls and
calibrators are stable until the expiration date printed on the vial when stored
unopened at 2-8˚C. Open vial stability is 14 days when stored on the Dimension Vista
system. Storage recommendations are provided in the labeling.
Value Assignment
Three vials of each single level calibrator and control are analyzed in quadruplicate.
The target value of the Dimension Vista CDT controls and calibrator is the median of
the observed values which are obtained during multiple runs on the Dimension Vista
1500 analyzer. The expected ranges for the controls are ±20% of the target value. The
expected values are provided in the labeling for each specific lot.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The labeling for the control materials states that the values provided are intended only as
a guideline. Each laboratory should determine its own individual values. A typical control
value for the Vista CDT L control is 64 mg/L. A typical control value for the Vista CDT
H control is 167 mg/L.

The lot specific value for the calibrator material is stated in the labeling. The target range
is 299 mg/L – 365 mg/L.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
