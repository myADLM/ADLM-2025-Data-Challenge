L. Test Principle:
The Wondfo Biotech Co., Ltd. Cannabinoids is a competitive binding, lateral flow
immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative determination of Cannabinoids and their
metabolites in human urine. The test utilizes two formats: cassette and strip. For both
formats, the urine is absorbed via capillary action and mixes with the anti-mouse IgG
polyclonal antibody-dye conjugate. It then flows across a pre-coated membrane and if the
sample is below the target cut off, the antibody-dye conjugate binds to the drug protein

conjugate immobilized in the test region. This produces a color test line indicating a
negative result. When the Cannabinoids level is at or above the target cutoff, the free drug
in the sample binds to the antibody-dye conjugate preventing the antibody-dye conjugate
from binding to the drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the test region. This prevents the
development of a colored line in the test region, indicating a positive result. A control line is
also present that appears in the control region to indicate that the test has performed
properly.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision study was performed by taking negative urine samples and spiking these
with 100, 87.5, 75, 62.5, 37.5, 25, 12.5 and 0 ng/ml of cannabinoid, corresponding to
± 25, ±50, ±75, and ±100% of the 50 ng/ml cut-off value. Two sets of operators
performed the testing (group A ran the strip format and group B ran the cassette
format) and the samples were divided into 12 sets of 25 (one set per lot per run for
each format). Three lots of the strip and three lots of the cassette formats of the
Wondfo Cannabinoids Urine Test were used. Each of three operators tested 2 aliquot
at each concentration for each lot per day (2 runs per day for 25 days), resulting in a
total of 50 determinations by each operator at each concentration. The operators were
blinded. A summary of the results is presented in the tables below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable, the assay is intended for qualitative use only
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Control standards are not supplied with this device; however, this device has internal
process controls. A colored line appearing in the control region confirms sufficient
sample volume and adequate membrane wicking. Users are informed that the test is
invalid if a line fails to appear in the control region.
Stability
Accelerated stability and real time stability tests were performed on three batches of strip
and cassette Wondfo Cannabinoid Urine Drug Tests. Accelerated stability was performed
at 50°C for 85 days, and the data support a greater than 18 month shelf life. Real time
studies were performed by storing three lots of strips and cassettes at 4°C and 30°C.
Performance tests were completed at defined intervals and the results support a 23 month
shelf life at 4°C and 30°C.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical performance of the device around the cutoff is described in Section f. (Assay
cut-off) below.
e. Analytical specificity:
Specificity and cross-reactivity was performed by using three batches of both the strip
and cassette formats of the Wondfo Cannabinoid Urine Test. The samples were split
into two aliquots and one group of operators ran the strip format on one set of aliquots
and a separate group of operators ran the cassette format on the other set of aliquots.
Thirty drug-free urine samples were tested and all were found to be negative. Cross-
reactivity was determined by spiking several Cannabinoid-related compounds into
drug-free urine at three different concentrations and measuring the samples in
duplicate using three batches of strips and three batches of cassettes.

The pH of a drug-free urine pool was adjusted to pH 4, pH 5, pH6, pH 7, pH 8 or pH
9; the urine was spiked with ± 50% of the cut-off concentration of Cannabinoid and
tested using three batches of strips and three batches of cassettes of the Wondfo
Cannabinoid Urine Test. The spiked, pH-adjusted urine was tested in duplicate.
Altering the pH of the urine sample did not affect the accuracy of any of the test
results.

The specific gravity of a drug-free urine pool was measured by obtaining urine
samples with specific gravities of 1.000-1.035 and spiking with ± 50% of the cut-off
concentration of Cannabinoid and tested using three batches of strips and three
batches of cassettes of the Wondfo Cannabinoid Urine Test. The spiked urines of
different specific gravities were tested in duplicate. The results indicate that there is
stable performance of the Wondfo Cannabinoid Urine Test when urine has a
specific gravity between 1.00-1.035.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut off was investigated by using three batches of both the strip and
cassette formats of the Wondfo Cannabinoids Urine Test to test 150 urine samples.
These samples came from the Shezhen Drug Addiction Recovery Center for
cannabinoids (25 Drug urine samples) and from drug-free urine samples (125
samples) spiked with cannabinoid diluted from the International Drug Standard
(Sigma) to concentrations that are plus and minus 25% and 50 % of the cutoff
concentrations. Drug concentrations were confirmed by GC/MS. Results were read by
three laboratory assistants with relevant experience. The cutoff studies were
performed by two separate groups of operators (one for the strip format and one for
the cassette format). Three operators in each group performed the readings and they
were blinded to the sample. Each result was confirmed by at least two assistants.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
1. Performance of the Wondfo Cannabinoids Urine Test (strip and cassette formats)
was established by comparing 80 samples against GC/MS. These samples came
from a drug addiction recovery center for cannabinoids and from drug-free urine
samples with concentrations ranges as follows: drug free urine, < -50% of the
cut-off, -50% of the cut-off to the cut-off, cut-off to +50% of the cut-off, and >
+50% of the Cut-off. There were two groups of operators (one for the strip
format and one for the cassette format) and they were blinded to the samples.
Each result was read by three laboratory assistants with relevant experience and a
lay person with no experience other than reading the instructions for use.

Both the test and strip formats resulted in a 100% Positive agreement and a 97.5%
negative agreement between the Wondfo Devices and the GC/MS method.
Additionally, the agreement lay user had 100% positive agreement and 94%
negative agreement between the Wondfo Devices and the GC/MS method.
B. A lay-user study was performed to assess the suitability of the device for home
use. Six drug-free urine sample pools were spiked with 12.5, 25, 37.5, 62.5, 75,
and 87.5 ng/ml of target drug (11-nor-D9-THC-9-COOH) corresponding to ±
25%, ± 50%,± 75% of the THC cutoff (50 ng/mL), additionally a negative urine
pool with no drug was tested. These concentrations were confirmed by GC/MS
and aliquoted into 40 individual containers per concentration (20 aliquots per
concentration for each strip format). The testing was performed at three sites by
242 blinded consumers divided between three sites. The lay users were chosen
from likely intended users at the Shenzhen Drug Addiction Recovery Center,
Baiyun Drug Addition Recovery Volunteer Center, and the No. 177 Hospital of
the People’s Liberation Army. Each participant received the package inset in
English, 1 sample, and a either test strip or cassette. The lay persons test result
was compared to the GC/MS result to demonstrate accuracy by lay-users. The
following are the results of the lay-user study pooled together from all three sites
for the strip format:

The overall percent agreement was 114/119 (95.8%) for the strip format and 119/123
(96.7%) for the cassette format.
C. The subject’s were to fill out a questionnaire to evaluate labeling access.
i. Strip format
The participant’s ages ranged from 21-61 and there were slightly more males
than females. They come from a variety of career and education backgrounds
and 2.7% had used a home drug kit before. They all understood the storage and
expiration of the device and that the test could not be reused. They all
understood that the strip couldn’t be immersed in urine above the marker line
and to read the result within 5 minutes and how to interpret the results. Only 1
person responded that the strip test was difficult, 84/119 said the test was very
easy and 35/119 said it was easy. 76/119 said the instructions were very clear
and 43/119said they were clear. 86/119 said the interpretation of the results
was very clear and 33/119 said they were clear. When asked what they would
do if the device failed to show a result, 104/119 said they would repeat the test
with a new test device, 5/119 said they would turn to another method, and
10/119 said they would call the manufacturer if the device failed to show a
result.
ii. Cassette format
The participant’s ages ranged from 22-60 and there were slightly more males
than females. They come from a variety of career and education backgrounds
and none had used a home drug kit before. They all understood the storage and
expiration of the device and that the test could not be reused. They all
understood that 4 drops of sample were required to add to the sample well, and
to read the result within 5 minutes and how to interpret the results. 78/123 said
the test was very easy and 45/123 said it was easy. 76/123 said the instructions
were very clear and 43/123 said they were clear. 80/123 said the interpretation
of the results was very clear and 43/123 said they were clear. When asked what
they would do if the device failed to show a result, 100/123 said they would
repeat the test with a new test device, 3/123 said they would turn to another
method, and 20/123 said they would call the manufacturer if the device failed
to show a result.
Additionally, a Flesh-Kincaid reading analysis revealed that both package inserts
had a reading grade level of 7.
