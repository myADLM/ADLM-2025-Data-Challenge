I. Device Description:
The Cepheid Xpert® C. difficile/Epi Assay is a rapid, automated in vitro diagnostic
test for qualitative detection of toxin B gene sequences and for presumptive
identification of 027/NAP1/BI strains of toxigenic Clostridium difficile from
unformed (liquid or soft) stool specimens collected from patients suspected of having
C. difficile infection (CDI). The Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay system includes
reagents for the detection of the toxin B gene of toxigenic C. difficile and the
presumptive detection of sequences found in 027/NAP1/BI strains. Detection of
DNA sequences is carried out by real- time multiplex polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) after an initial sample processing step. The assay is performed on the Cepheid
GeneXpert® Dx System.
A swab is placed into the unformed stool specimen, and then the swab is inserted into
a vial containing the Sample Reagent. Following brief vortexing of the vial with
swab, the eluted material and two single-use reagents (Reagent 1 and Reagent 2), that
are provided with the assay, are transferred to different, uniquely-labeled chambers of
the disposable fluidic cartridge (the Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay cartridge). The user
initiates a test from the system user interface and places the cartridge into the
GeneXpert Dx System instrument platform, which performs real-time, multiplex
PCR for detection of DNA sequences. In this platform, additional sample
preparation, amplification, and real-time detection are all fully automated and
completely integrated.
The GeneXpert® System consists of a GeneXpert instrument, personal computer, and
the multi-chambered fluidic cartridges that are designed to complete sample
preparation and real-time PCR for detection of the toxin B gene of C. difficile and
sequences associated with 027/NAP1/BI strains.
The Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay also includes an internal sample processing control
(SPC) to control for adequate processing of the target bacteria and to monitor the
presence of inhibitor(s) in the PCR assay. The SPC also ensures that the PCR
conditions (temperature and time) are appropriate for the amplification reaction and
that the PCR reagents are functional. The Probe Check Control (PCC) verifies reagent
rehydration, PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe integrity, and dye stability.
Each Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay kit contains sufficient reagents to process 10
specimens or quality control samples. The kit contains the following:

L. Test Principle:
The assay is a rapid, automated in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative detection of
C. difficile DNA directly from unformed (liquid or soft) stool specimens of patients
suspected of having C. difficile infection (CDI). The assay detects the following three
elements: toxin B gene (tcdB), binary toxin gene (CDT), and the single-base-pair
deletion at nucleotide 117 within the gene encoding a negative regulator of toxin
production (tcdCΔ117). The combined presence of the genes encoding toxin B,
binary toxin, and the tcdCΔ117deletion have been associated with an epidemic
toxigenic C. difficile strain known as 027/NAP1/BI. This strain designation
terminology refers to designations given to this strain based on PCR ribotyping,
Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) and restriction endonuclease analysis
(REA), respectively.
The assay is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert Dx System, which consists of the
GeneXpert instrument, personal computer, hand-held barcode scanner, and disposable
fluidic cartridges that are designed to complete sample preparation and real-time
PCR. Each instrument contains 1 to 16 randomly accessible modules that are each
capable of performing separate sample preparation and real-time PCR tests. Each
module contains a syringe drive for dispensing fluids, an ultrasonic horn for lysing
cells or spores, and an ICORE® thermocycler for performing real-time PCR and
detection with fluorescently labeled TaqMan® probes.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A panel of 7 specimens with varying concentrations of toxigenic C. difficile
(non-027/NAP1/BI strain) and C. difficile (027/NAP1/BI strain) were tested
on 10 different days by two different operators at each of three laboratory sites
(7 specimens x 2 operators/ day x 10 days x 3 sites) for a total of 60 test
results per specimen. One lot of Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay was used at each
of the 3 testing sites. Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assays were performed according
to the Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay procedure. The results are summarized in

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls
Internal Controls): The internal controls for the Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay
are the Sample Processing Control (SPC) and the Probe Check Control (PCC).
Both the SPC and PCC are contained within each Xpert C. difficile/Epi
cartridge.
The SPC, which consists of non-infectious Bacillus globigii spores, controls
for adequate processing of the target bacteria and to monitor for the presence
of inhibitor(s) in the PCR assay to avoid false-negative results. The pivotal
clinical study data validated the pre-determined SPC minimum and maximum
acceptable Ct settings of 5 to 40 cycles, respectively.
The PCC verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe
integrity, and dye stability. The PCC is carried out before the start of the PCR
reaction when the GeneXpert Dx System measures the fluorescence signal
from the probes to monitor bead rehydration, reaction-tube filling, probe
integrity and dye stability. The PCC is considered to “PASS” if the
fluorescence generated meets the validated acceptance criteria using the Lot
Specific Parameters (LSP) determination process.
An additional control is the System Control Check for Temperature. This
check ensures that the GeneXpert Dx Instrument is operating within validated
heating and cooling specifications.
External Controls: External positive and negative controls were validated for
use with the Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay but are not provided with the Xpert

C. difficile/Epi Assay. Strains for external controls and validation studies are
commercially available and catalog numbers of available strains from several
suppliers are listed in the Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay Package Insert. .
d. Detection Limits:
LoD studies were carried out with seven different strains of C. difficile
representing toxinotypes 0 (two strains), III (two strains), IV, V and VIII (one
strain each). The C. difficile strains were diluted into a fecal matrix consisting
of human liquid feces (verified C. difficile negative by the Xpert C.
difficile/Epi Assay) diluted in PBS with 15% glycerol. Each C. difficile level
(CFU/swab) that was evaluated in the study was tested in replicates of twenty.
The LoD is defined as the lowest number of colony forming units (CFU) per
swab that can be reproducibly distinguished from negative samples with 95%
confidence.
The estimate and confidence intervals were determined using logistic
regression with data (number of positive results per number of replicates at
each level) over the range of CFUs tested. The confidence intervals were
determined using maximum likelihood estimates on the logistic model
parameters using the large sample variance-covariance matrix. The LoD point
estimates and 95% upper and lower confidence intervals for each C. difficile
toxinotype tested are summarized in the following table.

e. Analytical Reactivity:
In addition to the LoD determination, eighteen C. difficile strains representing
toxinotype 0 plus twelve variant toxinotypes, including four 027/NAP1/BI
toxinotype III isolates, were tested using the Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay. C.
difficile strains were selected to broadly represent the majority of C. difficile
toxinotypes encountered in practice. Stock cultures were prepared by
suspending the bacterial growth from agar plates in PBS buffer containing

15% glycerol. The concentration of each stock was adjusted to 1.4-5.9
McFarland units. All strains were serially diluted to approximately 900
CFU/swab and tested in triplicate.
Under the conditions of this study, the Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay correctly
identified all eighteen strains tested as “Toxigenic C. diff POSITIVE”.
Included in the panel were 8 toxinotypes (III, IV, V, VI, IX, X, XIV, and
XXII) reported to be positive for binary toxin (CDT) production as well. All
replicates of toxinotypes V, VI, IX, and XXII were reported as “Toxigenic C.
diff POSITIVE; 027-NAP1-BI PRESUMPTIVE NEGATIVE”. Two of three
replicates of the toxinotype IV strain and one of three replicates of the
toxinotype X strain were reported as “Toxigenic C. diff POSITIVE; 027-
NAP1-BI PRESUMPTIVE POSITIVE”, although these two strains do not
contain the tcdCΔ117deletion. Three of three replicates of the toxinotype
XIV strain were reported as “Toxigenic C. diff POSITIVE; 027-NAP1-BI
PRESUMPTIVE POSITIVE”. Toxinotype XIV has been reported to contain
the tcdCΔ117deletion. All replicates of the four 027/NAP1/BI isolates
(representing toxinotype III) were reported as “Toxigenic C. diff POSITIVE;
027-NAP1-BI PRESUMPTIVE POSITIVE”. Statements were added to the
Limitations Section of the Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay Package Insert to
reflect the reactivity of the Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay with toxinotype XIV
and occasional reactivity of the assay with toxinotypes IV and X. The results

f. Analytical Specificity:
Fifty-five (55) strains were collected, quantitated and tested using the Xpert C.
difficile/Epi Assay. The strains originated from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC), Culture Collection University of Göteborg (CCUG),
German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ), the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Institute of Public Health,
Maribor, Slovenia and the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control
(SMI).
Of the tested species, ten (10) non-toxigenic C. difficile strains and eleven (11)
non C. difficile Clostridium species were included. The organisms tested were
identified as either Gram-positive (37) or Gram negative (18). The organisms
were further classified as aerobic (24), anaerobic (29) or microaerophilic (2).
Each strain was tested in triplicate at concentrations ranging from 1.1x108 to
2.2x1010 CFU/swab. Positive and negative controls were included in the
study. Under the conditions of the study, all isolates were reported
“Toxigenic C. diff NEGATIVE; 027-NAP1-BI PRESUMPTIVE NEG”. The

g. Interference Studies:
Twenty-one (21) biological and chemical substances occasionally used or
found in stool specimens were tested for interference with the Xpert C.
difficile/Epi Assay. All substances were tested at levels representing
approximately 1-10% (v/v or w/v) final concentration. Four strains of C.
difficile, representing toxinotypes 0, III (two strains), and VIII, were used
in the study at 600 CFU/swab. Replicates of eight were tested using each
strain and each substance for a total of 706 runs including controls.
Interference was determined by comparing Ct values for each Xpert C.
difficile/Epi target in the presence of each substance relative to the Ct
values obtained for controls. The following table lists the substances that
were tested in this study.

in the table immediately above showed no detectable interference with the
Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay.
h. Assay cut-off:
Lot Specific Parameters and Assay Settings
Lot specific assay settings are generated for every lot manufactured to account
for slight variations in reagent production. The lot specific assay settings (LSP
file) are incorporated into the 2-D barcode on each cartridge label and are
transferred to the GeneXpert Dx system via a hand-held barcode scanner prior
to initiating the Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay.
General Assay Settings
General assay settings are used for all reagent lots. They are fixed and not part
of the LSP process. The following table lists general assay settings:
Attribute Setting
Background Subtraction Always ON
Background Minimum Cycle Default setting = 5
Background Maximum Cycle Manual setting = 30
Manual Threshold (SPC) Manual setting = 15
Manual Threshold (tcdB and tcdC) Manual setting = 20
Manual Threshold (CDT) Manual setting = 30
Curve Analysis Primary
Boxcar Average Cycles Zero (OFF)
Valid Minimum Ct (SPC, tcdB, CDT and tcdC) Manual setting = 5
Valid Maximum Ct (tcdB and CDT) Manual setting = 37
Valid Maximum Ct (SPC and tcdC) Manual setting = 40
Delta Ct Max Manual setting = 4.0
The valid cycle range for binary toxin (CDT) target is 5 to 37 cycles and the
valid range for the tcdCΔ117 target is 5 to 40 cycles as determined from pre-
clinical results. Based on pre-clinical results relative to toxigenic culture and
strain typing methods, a valid maximum Ct of 37.0 for toxin B (tcdB) and
binary toxin (CDT) and 40.0 for tcdCΔ117 were used as the cutoff Ct values
to differentiate between positive and negative results in the clinical study.
These cutoffs were subsequently validated in the pivotal clinical study.

--- Page 15 ---
The valid cycle range for the SPC is 5 to 40 cycles and was derived from
simulated inhibitory studies with potentially interfering substances and pre-
clinical negative data (n=1066). The SPC Ct settings were subsequently
validated in the pivotal clinical study. A valid maximum SPC Ct of 40 cycles
was set to differentiate between valid negative results and invalid results in the
pivotal clinical study. The SPC was designed to be sensitive to the presence of
inhibition, while at the same time limiting the number of invalid test results. In
both interference testing and pre-clinical testing, the observed SPC Ct
distribution was wide enough that a maximum valid cycle of 40 is justified to
ensure the detection of all sample processing control results, maintain a low
invalid rate, and keep false negative results to a minimum.
i. Carry-over/Cross-Contamination
A study was carried out to verify that single–use; self–contained GeneXpert
cartridges prevent carry–over contamination in negative samples that are run
immediately after very high positive samples have been run in the same
GeneXpert module. The study consisted of a negative sample (no C. difficile
cells present) processed in the same GeneXpert module immediately
5
following a very high positive sample made up of 1.5x10 Clostridium difficile
(027/NAP1/BI strain) cells spiked into the elution buffer. This was repeated
20 times between two GeneXpert modules for a total of 40 runs. All 20
negative samples were correctly reported “Toxigenic C. diff NEGATIVE; 027-
NAP1-BI PRESUMPTIVE NEGATIVE”. All 20 high positive samples were
correctly reported as “Toxigenic C. diff POSITIVE; 027-NAP1-BI
PRESUMPTIVE POSITIVE”.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with reference methods:
The clinical performance evaluation was done against reference culture,
followed by cell cytotoxicity testing on the isolates and strain typing on the
toxigenic strains by PCR-ribotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
and restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) methods.
b. Matrix Comparison:
Not applicable
3. Clinical studies:
Clinical performance characteristics of the Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay were
determined by testing a total of 2293 leftover unformed stool specimens from
subjects whose routine care called for C. difficile testing. The prospective clinical
study was carried out at seven US and Canadian institutions by comparing the
Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay to reference culture followed by cell cytotoxicity
15

--- Page 16 ---
testing on the isolates and strain typing on the toxigenic strains by PCR-
ribotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and restriction endonuclease
analysis (REA) methods.
A portion of each leftover unformed stool specimen was obtained for testing by
the Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay. The remaining excess specimen was sent to a
central laboratory for reference culture and cytotoxin B isolate testing. Each stool
specimen was inoculated onto pre-reduced cycloserine-cefoxitin-fructose agar –
direct plate (CCFA-D) and cycloserine cefoxitin mannitol broth with taurocholate
lysozyme cysteine (CCMB-TAL). After 24 hours, the CCMB-TAL was
subcultured on to a second CCFA-E plate (CCFA- Enriched). This direct-
enriched culture method is referred to as “reference culture”.
If C. difficile was isolated from the CCFA-D plate and the isolate was positive by
cell cytotoxicity assay, the specimen was classified as “toxigenic C. difficile
positive” and the corresponding CCFA-E plate was not further analyzed. If no C.
difficile was isolated from the CCFA-D plate or if the isolate was negative by cell
cytotoxicity assay, the corresponding CCFA-E plate was further analyzed.
If CCFA-E was positive for C. difficile and the isolate was positive for cell
cytotoxicity assay, the specimen was classified as “toxigenic C. difficile positive”.
The specimen was reported as “negative” if CCFA-E was negative for C. difficile
or the isolate was tested negative by cell cytotoxicity assay.
Following reference culture testing, the toxigenic C. difficile positive isolates
were sent to a second set of reference laboratories for strain identification by
REA, PFGE, and PCR-ribotyping.
Performance of the Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay was calculated relative to the
results of direct culture with strain typing, for each of the three strain typing
methods, and relative to the results of reference culture with strain typing, for
each of the three strain typing methods.
Performance vs. Direct Culture and REA
Relative to direct culture with REA strain typing, the Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay
demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity for toxigenic C. difficile of 98.72% and
90.86%, respectively. The Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay also demonstrated a
98.55% positive agreement and 97.65% negative agreement for BI. The results
are summarized in the following table.

Performance vs. Reference Culture and REA
Reference (enriched) culture is a more sensitive method for detection of C.
difficile in symptomatic patients. For example, it enhances detection of low
number of organisms in samples due to prior antibiotic treatment and potential
loss of viability due to specimen transport.
Relative to reference culture with REA strain typing, the Xpert C. difficile/Epi
Assay demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity for toxigenic C. difficile of
93.35% and 94.02%, respectively. The Xpert C. difficile/Epi Assay also
demonstrated a 96.51% positive agreement and 98.31% negative agreement for
