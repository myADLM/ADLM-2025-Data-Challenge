L. Test Principle:
After a drop of fresh capillary whole blood is applied to the sample well of the test strip, it is
drawn into the reaction area by capillary action where it mixes with the reagents that initiate
coagulation. Initially the impedance across the electrode (measured by the monitor) is high
until the air gap is closed by filling the reaction area with blood. As the reaction progresses,
the electrical impedance increases and then gradually drops to a second minimum as the
clotting reaction proceeds. A characteristic inflection point, identified by the system
algorithm is defined as the clotting endpoint. The elapsed time, in seconds, from the
initiation of the reaction until the endpoint is reached is the prothrombin time. The monitor
software calculates the INR of the sample from the PT using calibration coefficients
determined from the strip code.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision (repeatability) was evaluated with duplicate samples of capillary whole
blood. Three lots of the INRatio®2 PT/INR Test Strips were used on both INRatio®
and INRatio®2 monitors for the study. For each lot, samples from individuals not
receiving warfarin/vitamin K antagonist therapy (Normals, N), (n=118) and samples
from subjects on warfarin/VKA therapy (Therapeutics, T), (n=210) were included.
The precision performance of the test strips used met the acceptance criteria as shown
in the table below:

Therapeutic Range (2.0 - 4.5 INR) 5.4% CV CV ≤ 10%
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The study was conducted to verify linearity of the INR range (0.7 to 7.5) of the
INRatio®2 PT/INR Test Strips used in conjunction with both INRatio® and INRatio®2
monitors compared to the Sysmex CA-560 laboratory reference method. Seventeen
(17) contrived plasma samples were prepared by mixing normal plasma with
commercially obtained factor II deficient plasma. Saline-washed normal red blood
cells and calcium were added to contrive whole blood of various INRs. One
representative strip lot was used for this study. For each sample, 8 replicates were
tested on each meter type. In addition, fingerstick capillary whole blood from 2
subjects was also included in the study (8 replicates for each subject) for comparison
to the contrived samples. The test strips tested on both INRatio® and INRatio®2
monitors demonstrated accuracy as assessed with respect to percent of results within
the Allowable Difference for INR within the reportable range of the system. The
observed slope and correlation fall within acceptable ranges.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
A study was conducted to verify shelf life stability of the INRatio®2 PT/INR Test
Strips. Three (3) lots of the INRatio®2 PT/INR Test Strips were used. The strips
were incubated at three (3) storage conditions (32±2ºC, 22±2ºC and 4±2ºC) and tested
at the various time intervals (3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 14 months). Testing was
conducted with blood from 4 subjects (1 N and 3 T) in 13 replicates per sample for a
total of 52 tests. The strips were tested on the INRatio®2 monitor and the results were
compared to results on the Sysmex CA-560 reference method. All 3 lots of test strips
met stability acceptance criteria requirements up to 12 months for all storage
temperatures tested.
d. Detection limit:
Contrived coagulation factor deficient blood samples were prepared by mixing
commercially obtained citrated factor deficient plasma in various proportions with
normal citrated plasma and with red blood cells such that whole blood samples with
several factor concentrations were generated. The factor deficient plasma was used to
make whole blood samples in final concentrations of normal plasma from 100% to

INRatio®2 PT/INR Test Strips at the following levels (% of normal factor level; in
vitro testing): Factor II<56%; Factor V <62%; Factor VII <78%; and Factor X <74%.
e. Analytical specificity:
A study was conducted to verify the endogenous substances (bilirubin, triglycerides
and hemoglobin) at the concentrations present in whole blood do not cause
interference with INR results for tests performed with the INRatio®2 PT/INR Test
Strips when used in conjunction with the INRatio®2 monitor. Three to four
concentrations of each substance was spiked into the iced venous blood of one normal
donor blood sample and one therapeutic donor blood sample (INR 2.0- 4.5). Each
endogenous substance, at each defined concentration, was tested with a replicated set
of at least 48 blood samples using one lot of the INRatio®2 PT/INR Test Strips. Test
results from blood samples with and without the endogenous substance on the
INRatio®2 monitor were compared to results evaluated from citrated venous blood
processed to plasma on the Sysmex CA-560 as the reference method. For all
subjects, results fell within the acceptance criteria based on ISO 17593:2007. The
study results show that the following substances do not interfere with test results up to
the concentrations shown:
Substance Concentration
Bilirubin up to 30 mg/dL
Triglycerides (lipemia) up to 1500 mg/dL
Hemoglobin (hemolysis) up to 1000 mg/dL
In addition, a study was conducted to characterize the levels of other pharmaceuticals:
clopidogrel (active ingredient in Plavix®), acetylsalicylic acid (active ingredient in
aspirin), Arixtra (fondaparinux) and atorvastatin (active ingredient in Lipitor®), that
might be present for subjects on warfarin/VKA therapy without adverse effects on
accuracy of the system. Two concentrations of each substance were spiked into the
iced venous blood of normal donor blood samples and therapeutic donor blood
samples (INR 2.0- 4.5). Each exogenous substance was tested with a replicated set of
at least 48 blood samples using one lot of the INRatio®2 PT/INR Test Strips. Test
results from blood samples with and without the exogenous substance on the
INRatio®2 monitor were compared to result evaluated from citrated venous blood
processed to plasma on the Sysmex CA-560 as the reference method. For all
subjects, results fell within the acceptance criteria based on ISO 17593:2007. The
study results show that the drugs listed below do not interfere with test results when
spiked into whole blood, up to the concentrations shown:
Drug Up to this concentration
Fondaparinux up to 5 mg/L
Acetylsalicylic acid up to 4 mmol/L
Clopidogrel up to 20 mg/dL

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Accuracy was evaluated with the INRatio®2 PT/INR Test Strips in conjunction with
both INRatio® and INRatio®2 monitors with capillary whole blood. Samples from
individuals not receiving warfarin/vitamin K antagonist therapy (Normals, INR <2.0),
(n=174) and samples from subjects on warfarin/VKA therapy (Therapeutics, INR 2.0
to 4.5), (n=224) were included. Three (3) lots of INRatio®2 PT/INR Test Strips were
used for this study. Test results on both monitors were compared to reference results
on the Sysmex CA-560 method from citrated venous blood processed to plasma.
Linear regression was performed and the Pearson correlation (R value), slope (with
confidence interval), and intercept (with confidence interval) were calculated, and
Allowable Difference limits were constructed. To pass acceptance criteria, 90% of
data for INR ≤ 4.5 must fall within the limits of Allowable Difference.
The results of the study show that each of the 3 strip lots met the acceptance criteria
for INR accuracy as represented by % Allowable Difference relative to the Sysmex
CA-560 reference method, both below and at therapeutic ranges (<2.0 and 2.0 to 4.5)
when analyzed on either INRatio® or INRatio®2 monitors. The data show that 98%
of valid test results for the test strips used in conjunction with both monitors are
within the Allowable Difference for INR ≤ 4.5. For INR < 2.0, the Allowable
Difference is ± 0.5 INR and for INR between 2.0 to 4.5, the Allowable Difference is a
% relative INR difference of ± 30%.

Accuracy: A multi-center study (4 external clinical sites) was conducted in which
subjects on anticoagulant therapy were trained using the user guide and test strip
package insert to conduct fingerstick INR testing with the INRatio®2 PT/INR
Monitoring System. Subjects tested weekly, over 8 weeks, and the following data
were collected at the end of the 8-week period. Fingerstick (capillary) INR results
obtained by the trained PST user were compared to corresponding plasma (venous)
INR results obtained at a central laboratory (Sysmex CA-560 System using Dade

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
A normal range study was conducted on 120 subjects not on anticoagulant therapy.
Testing was conducted with fresh capillary whole blood using 3 lots of INRatio®2
PT/INR Test Strips on both INRatio® and INRatio ®2 monitors. The normal reference
range at 95% confidence level was determined to be 0.8-1.3 INR.
N. Instrument Name:
INRatio®2 PT/INR monitor
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Manual mode
2. Software:
The INRatio®2 Monitor software consists of three modules (Application Operating
System (AOS), Application Control Program (ACP), and Prothrombin Time Finding
Algorithm modules (PTFA)) that are linked together to form a single program that resides
on the micro-controller unit ROM. The AOS controls the hardware functions of the
monitor, the ACP controls the user interface, and the PTFA controls the clotting time
measurement functions.
The INRatio®2 PT/INR monitor uses an icon-based, language-independent user interface

that makes the monitor simpler to use, and minimizes labeling and translation
requirements.
The monitor software calculates the INR of the sample from the PT using calibration
coefficients determined from the strip code.

this line of product types:
Yes X or No _______
3. Specimen Identification:
Manual input.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
After the test strip is inserted into the monitor, fresh capillary whole blood (obtained by
fingerstick) is manually applied directly to the sample well of the test strip.
5. Calibration:
INRatio®2 PT/INR test strip: Fresh human blood samples from both therapeutic patients
and normal subjects are used for test strip calibration. The Test Strips are calibrated to a
laboratory reference method (Sysmex CA 560 Coagulation Analyzer). A calibration
coefficient for each lot of test strips is calculated. The calibration method is in alignment
with WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization. 48th Report. World Health
Organ Tech Rep Ser. 1999, 889:64-83. The human recombinant thromboplastin is
traceable to WHO reference thromboplastin material.
INRatio®2 Monitor: Factory calibration. The monitor performs self-checks at start-up and
throughout the testing process.
6. Quality Control:
The INRatio®2 PT/INR Test Strip contains two levels of integrated “on-board” quality
control (QC) so that external quality control is not required to monitor the performance of
the test system. On-board QC is performed with each test. These report one result in the
normal range and one result in the therapeutic range. QC ensures that the test is being
performed correctly and that the monitor and test strips are working properly together as
a system. Before the patient’s test results are displayed, the monitor determines whether
the control results are within specified limits. If the control results are in range (verifying
strip integrity), the monitor reports the patient’s test results. If either or both of the
controls are out of range, the monitor displays a flashing CAUTION symbol and the
applicable QC error message. No test result is given if a QC error is displayed.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
A study was conducted to verify the acceptable hematocrit range of the INRatio®2 PT/INR
Test Strips in conjunction with the INRatio®2 PT/INR monitor. Testing was conducted on
the chilled-venous whole blood sample type due to necessity for sample manipulation to
targeted hematocrit levels. Sample blood from fifteen (15) subjects on warfarin/VKA
therapy (T, INR 2.0 to 4.5) and one normal subject was collected by venipuncture into plain
plastic tubes without anticoagulant. Aliquots were made to plain plastic tubes without
anticoagulant and samples were immediately placed on ice for up to 90 min for storage. Just
prior to testing the blood samples were warmed to 37ºC and then applied to test strips.
Samples were contrived to target concentrations. Low hematocrit blood samples were
11

--- Page 12 ---
contrived by dilution of the sample with plasma from the same subject. High hematocrit
samples were contrived by concentration of the sample by removal of plasma from the
sample. Test results on the INRatio®/INRatio®2 PT/INR system were compared to reference
results on the Sysmex CA-560 from citrated venous blood processed to plasma. The results
of the study meet all acceptability criteria defined in the clinical protocols and support the
acceptable hematocrit range of 25 to 53%.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
