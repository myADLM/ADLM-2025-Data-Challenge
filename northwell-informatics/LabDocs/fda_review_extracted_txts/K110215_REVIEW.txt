sponsor provided clinical study data that analyzed patient outcomes relative to the
device performance on the BenchMark ULTRA stainer – The Calgary Cohort Study
(2012). The device performance on the BenchMark XT was supported by data from
an inter-platform comparison study between the BenchMark ULTRA and the
BenchMark XT staining platforms.
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Guidance document: "FDA Guidance for Submission of Immunohistochemistry
Applications to the FDA", Center for Devices and Radiologic Health.
L. Test Principle:
CONFIRM anti-ER (SP1) assay binds to human estrogen receptor alpha located in the
nuclear region of normal and neoplastic cells. Automated immunohistochemistry
staining is performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. The antigen in
tissue sections is demonstrated through several steps. The specific antibody binds to
the antigen present in tissue sections. The bound primary antibody is located by a
biotin conjugated secondary antibody formulation which recognizes rabbit or mouse
immunoglobulins (Ig). This step is followed by the addition of a streptavidin-enzyme
conjugate which binds to the biotin on the secondary antibody. The primary
antibody-secondary antibody-avidin enzyme complex is visualized by using a
precipitating enzyme generated product. This is detected by light microscopy as

brown precipitate in the nucleus of normal and neoplastic cells.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Studies to assess the intra-run (within-run, intra-day) and inter-run (day-to-
day) analytical precision of CONFIRM anti-ER (SP1) antibody was
conducted using two Ventana IHC stainers: BenchMark XT and BenchMark
Ultra instruments and the iView DAB Detection Kit. An acceptance criteria
of at least 80% overall agreement for staining and 90% for background
staining was set by the sponsor. In these studies all acceptance criteria were
met.
Intra-run precision
Nine slides were stained with the CONFIRM anti-ER (SP1) antibody and one
slide was stained with Negative Control Rabbit Ig antibody from each of the
six individual breast carcinoma tissue blocks in this study. There were a total
of sixty slides in this study. Of the six tissues, two were ER negative, two
were ER low expression and two were ER high expression based on the
following scoring criteria: <1% tumor cells staining for negative, 1-10% for
low and >10% for high expression. This slide testing configuration was used
for staining on both the BenchMark XT and BenchMark Ultra instruments.
Slide to slide staining characteristics showed acceptable reproducibility with
no variation in staining quality and patterns. There was 100% concordance
for all slides for ER staining and the background staining was acceptable. All
acceptance criteria for both instruments were met in this study.
Inter-run precision
Four slides from each case were stained with the CONFIRM anti-ER (SP1)
antibody, and one slide from each case was stained with Negative Control
Rabbit Ig antibody in five separate nonconsecutive runs on 5 days conducted
over a 20-day period on the same BenchMark XT instrument. There were a
total of 30 slides per run. The same testing configuration was also performed
on a BenchMark ULTRA instrument. There was 100% concordance for all
slides for ER staining and the background staining was acceptable. All
acceptance criteria for both instruments were met in this study.
Intra-platform Reproducibility
Four slides from six cases were stained with CONFIRM anti-ER (SP1)
antibody and one slide from each case was stained with Negative Control
Rabbit Ig antibody on three separate BenchMark XT instruments. There were
a total of thirty slides. The same testing configuration was used for the
BenchMark ULTRA instrument. There was 100% concordance on all cases
and the background staining was acceptable for both the BenchMark XT and
BenchMark ULTRA instruments. All acceptance criteria for both instruments
were met in this study.

Inter-Platform Reproducibility for ULTRA and XT
A cross platform comparison was performed to assess the reproducibility
between the BenchMark ULTRA and the XT instruments. Three BenchMark
XT and three BenchMark ULTRA instruments were used in this study. There
were thirty slides stained per BenchMark XT instrument for a total of ninety
slides in this study. The same testing configuration was used for the
BenchMark ULTRA instrument for a total of ninety slides for the BenchMark
ULTRA instrument. There was 100% concordance on all six cases and the
acceptability rate for background staining exceeded the 80% acceptance
criteria.
Detection Kit compatibility Study
This study utilized 199 individual breast cancer cases and three lots of the
iView and the ultraView DAB Detection Kits. There were approximately 100
ER negative and 100 ER positive cases. The three lots were grouped into
Group A instruments and reagents (one XT and one ULTRA using one lot of
iVIEW DAB and ultraView DAB Detection). Similar configurations were
used for Group B and Group C. The acceptance criteria of 90% for ER
staining and 85% for background and morphology acceptability were met.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Intra-Platform Comparison Studies
Comparison of BenchMark XT versus BenchMark ULTRA:
A randomized, multi-site, multi-reader study was conducted to compare the
staining performance of the CONFIRM anti-ER (SP1) on the BenchMark
ULTRA instrument versus the BenchMark XT instrument. 120 ER negative
and 132 ER positive cases of breast cancer, representing the clinical range of
the assay, were randomly assigned to three study sites such that each site
received an equal number of cases and each site received cases representing
each clinical assessment category. Each site stained its assigned cases with
the CONFIRM anti-ER (SP1) antibody on a BenchMark ULTRA instrument
and a CONFIRM anti-ER (SP1) antibody on a BenchMark XT instrument.
The stained slides were evaluated by pathologists who determined the
percentage of stained tumor cells. A case was considered ER positive if there
was staining of the nucleus in at least ³1% of invasive tumor cells. The
acceptance criteria of 85% concordance for ER scoring and background
staining set by the sponsor were met in these studies. Results of the study are
summarized in table below:

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical Specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Calgary Cohort Study: The sponsor performed this study to provide patient
outcome data to support the performance of the CONFIRM anti-Estrogen
Receptor (ER) (SP1) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody assay. The
Calgary study leveraged a tamoxifen treatment cohort database and cohort
tissue samples established by The Tom Baker Cancer Center at the
Department of Oncology, University of Calgary, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
The center had previously conducted a retrospective study in which a patient
cohort was identified from the Calgary Tamoxifen Database consisting of 820
breast cancer patients identified as having received tamoxifen treatment
between 1997 and 2003. The dataset consisted of 511 cases of primary
tumors of invasive breast cancer, with the dates of occurrence spanning 1985-
2000. Patients who were treated with tamoxifen, did not have a previous
cancer diagnosis prior the cancer being examined and did not receive any
other chemotherapy besides tamoxifen or any chemotherapy prior to
collection of specimen were included in this study. This data set consisted of
459 cases.
Sections were cut from these cases and stained with CONFIRM anti-Estrogen
Receptor (ER) (SP1) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody using the
BenchMark ULTRA stainer. Three pathologists (2 external and 1 internal)
blinded to any previous ER-status independently evaluated the stained slides.
All readers scored all cases included in the study in accordance with relevant
package inserts and training provided by the sponsor. Cases were scored as
ER-positive if 1% or more of the tumor cells in the core exhibited specific
staining for ER. There were 441 cases with Ventana ER+ status and 18 cases
with Ventana ER- status.
A Kaplan-Meier survival plot by Ventana ER status showed strong separation
between Ventana ER+ and ER– cases. As expected, ER+ patients had longer
survival times than ER– patients when tamoxifen treatment was administered;
the median survival times for ER+ and ER– patients were 101.6 (95% CI;
95.0 to 110.9) and 47.2 (95% CI: 22.8, not estimated) months, respectively.
The log-rank test showed that this difference was statistically significant (p <
0.001). In addition, Cox regression analysis was performed with Ventana ER
status and clinical covariates as age, tumor grade, tumor size and nodal status.
The estimate of hazard ratio for Ventana ER status was 0.469 with 95% CI:
0.252-0.973 (p-value=0.026)
