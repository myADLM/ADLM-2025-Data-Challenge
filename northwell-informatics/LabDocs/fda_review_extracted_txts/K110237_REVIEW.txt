1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run and between-run: Precision studies were performed with three lots
of HemosIL Factor VIII deficient plasma on the ACL TOP, ACL TOP 500
CTS, and ACL TOP 700 for 20 operational days, with 2 runs a day and 2
replicates per run for each sample level (N=80 per level for each
reagent/instrument combination). The acceptance criteria are listed in the
following table.
Range of sample Within-run % Between-run
Sample means (FVIII CV % CV
% Activity)
HemosIL Normal Control 75.5 – 87.4 ≤10% ≤10%
HemosIL ST Level 2 Control 23.8 – 29.7 ≤15% ≤15%
Low Control I 7.4 – 12.1 ≤20% ≤20%
Low Control II 5.1 – 6.8 ≤20% ≤20%
The acceptance criteria were met for all samples within each study.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity testing was performed using two lots of HemosIL® Factor VIII
deficient plasma on the ACL TOP and ACL TOP 500 CTS using the APTT
reagents SynthASil and APTT SP. The Factor VIII activities of a high sample
and an intermediate sample were determined from the mean of 8 replicates
using the predicate HemosIL® Factor VIII deficient plasma. These two
samples were diluted in order to prepare 12 samples with Factor VIII activities
ranging from 0% to 170%. All Factor VIII samples were run in 4 replicates on
the ACL TOP Family members for both reagent lots and the average activities
for all the samples were plotted against their assigned values. Acceptance
criteria were as follows: slope, 0.85 – 1.15; R2 ≥ 0.95. The results of the study
fell within acceptable limits. The results support the claimed assay reportable
range using SynthASil of 0.1 – 150% FVIII activity and a reportable range
using APTT SP of 0.5 – 150% FVIII activity.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Reagent Stability
Real Time Stability: The general storage condition for HemosIL® Factor VIII
Deficient Plasma is at 2-8°C. Three lots were stored and at periodic times
sample vials were removed for stability testing. The study was performed on
an ACL TOP for the recovery of Factor VIII activity for two plasma controls:
Normal and ST Level 2, tested in quadruplicate. The acceptance criteria are
found in the table below. To date of the submission, real time stability was
tested for 12 months for the 1st and 2nd lots, and 6 months for the 3rd lot. All
tests were within the established acceptance range. Based on the results of the
accelerated stability study, which projects a 3-year shelf life, the 12 month
shelf life claim is supported for the product when stored at 2-8°C. Ongoing
real-time stability testing will be used to update the shelf life.
On board Stability (open vial): Open vials of two lots of reconstituted
HemosIL® Factor VIII deficient plasma were placed in the reagent block of

an ACL TOP for 27 hours. Using on-board Factor VIII deficient plasma and
SynthASil reagent, the Factor VIII activity assay was performed for Normal
Control Plasma and ST Level 2 at 0, 2, 4, 8, 24 and 27 hour time points. Each
control plasma sample was tested in quadruplicate. Using the mean of the
Factor VIII activities of each control plasma sample at zero hour as a baseline,
the change (%) in Factor VIII activity for each time point was calculated. The
acceptance criteria are found in the table below. The data indicate that the
change (%) at every time point tested met the specified limitation. Factor VIII
deficient plasma is stable for 24 hours on board the ACL TOP at 15°C.
Reconstituted stability at 2-8° C: Two lots of HemosIL® Factor VIII deficient
plasma were reconstituted and stored at 2-8°C for 27 hours. Using this plasma
and SynthASil on the ACL TOP Base, the Factor VIII activity assay was
performed for Normal Control Plasma and ST Level 2 at 0, 2, 4, 8, 24, and 27
hour time points. Each control plasma sample was tested in quadruplicate.
Using the mean of the Factor VIII activities of each control plasma sample at
zero hour as a baseline, the change (%) in Factor VIII activity for each time
point was calculated. The acceptance criteria are found in the table below. The
data indicate that the change (%) at every time point tested met the specified
limitation. Factor VIII deficient plasma is stable for 24 hours at 2-8°C after
reconstitution.
Frozen stability study at -20°C: Two lots of Factor VIII deficient plasma were
reconstituted and stored at -20°C for 31 days. Using this plasma and APTT SP
on the ACL TOP 500, the Factor VIII activity assay was performed for
Normal Control Plasma and ST Level 2 at 0, 1, 4, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 31 day
time points. Each control plasma sample was tested in quadruplicate. Using
the mean of the Factor VIII activities of each control plasma sample at zero
hour as a base line the change (%) in Factor VIII activity for each time point
was calculated. The acceptance criteria are found in the table below. Results
for both lots indicate that the change (%) met the specified limitation at every
time point tested. Factor VIII deficient plasma is stable for 3 weeks at -20°C
after reconstitution.
Stability Testing Acceptance Criteria:

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were conducted using one lot of HemosIL® Factor VIII
deficient plasma on the ACL TOP 700 analyzing normal plasma spiked with
various concentrations of hemoglobin, triglyceride, bilirubin, lupus
anticoagulant antibodies, and FVIII inhibitor. Both SynthASil and APTT SP
reagents were employed. The percent differences in results of the spiked
plasma samples and unspiked plasma sample were determined. Acceptance
criterion was percent difference between the spiked and baseline (unspiked)

sample to be ≤15%. Interference tolerance limits were determined. Factor VIII
results on the ACL TOP Family are not affected by hemoglobin up to 530
mg/dL, triglycerides up to 2000 mg/dL, bilirubin up to 150 mg/dL, and Factor
VIII inhibitors up to 0.1 BU. Results are not affected by the presence of Lupus

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
An in-house method comparison study was conducted to compare the
performance of the predicate Factor VIII Deficient Plasma to the new
HemosIL® Factor VIII Deficient Plasma on an ACL TOP base model and an
ACL TOP 500 CTS using each of the APTT reagents (SynthASil, APTT SP).
A total of at least 88 samples were tested per instrument with each APTT
reagent and the results were calculated by comparing the first replicate values.
The study included apparently normal healthy donors and patients suspected
of factor VIII deficiency. The clinical breakdown of samples is detailed in the

b. Matrix comparison:
Fresh vs. Once Thawed Samples – Plasma samples were collected in tubes
containing 3.2% sodium citrate as an anticoagulant and processed. Testing
was performed on the ACL TOP with the HemosIL Factor VIII Deficient
Plasma. One hundred nineteen (119) patient samples (37 normal and 82
abnormal) were used for the comparison. After testing the fresh samples they
were stored at or below -65°C for at least 24 hours before being thawed and
re-tested. Acceptance criteria were as follows: slope 0.85 to 1.15 and r ≥ 0.95.
The regression analysis produced a slope = 1.011 and a correlation coefficient
(r) = 0.9880.
Comparison of 3.2% and 3.8% sodium citrate plasma - Two blood samples
were drawn, from a total of 37 normal donors, using both a 3.2% and 3.8%
sodium citrate sample tube respectively. Plasma samples were obtained from
prompt centrifugation and Factor VIII was depleted from the donor plasmas
with different sodium citrate concentrations using antibody resin. The donor
samples then were diluted with the appropriate citrated Factor VIII depleted
plasma to produce a range of concentrations. A total of 29 pairs of artificial
samples were prepared and tested with SynthASil and APTT SP APTT
reagents. Acceptance criteria were as follows: slope 0.85 to 1.15 and r ≥ 0.95.
The regression slope and correlation coefficient were 0.885 and 0.987 for
SynthASil respectively. The slope and correlation coefficient were 0.907 and
0.9870 respectively for APTT SP.
