referred to here as cTHC) as calibrator at the cutoff values of 25, 50, or
100 ng/mL. The assay is designed for prescription use with a number of
automated clinical chemistry analyzers.
The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of
(1) enabling laboratories to determine an appropriate dilution of the
specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as GCMS
or
(2) permitting laboratories to establish quality control procedures.
The Cannabinoids (cTHC) Drugs of Abuse (DOA) Calibrators are for use
as calibrators in the qualitative and semi-quantitative calibration of the
LZI Cannabinoids (cTHC) Enzyme Immunoassay.
The Cannabinoids (cTHC) Drugs of Abuse (DOA) Controls are for use as
assayed quality control materials to monitor the precision of the LZI
Cannabinoids (cTHC) Enzyme Immunoassay.
The assay provides only a preliminary analytical result. A more specific
alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed
analytical result. Gas or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry
(GC/MS or LC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory methods. Clinical
consideration and professional judgment should be exercised with any
drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary test result is
positive.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The assay is for in vitro prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Performance data was provided for Hitachi 717 analyzer.
I. Device Description:
The LZI Cannabinoids (cTHC) Enzyme Immunoassay consists of two separately
packaged reagents (R1 and R2):

phosphate (G6P), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), and sodium
azide as a preservative.

• CLSI Protocol EP5-A2: Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative
Method-Second Edition
L. Test Principle:
The LZI Cannabinoids (cTHC) is an immunoassay with ready-to-use liquid reagent.
The assay is based on competition between drug in the sample and drug labeled with
the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for a fixed amount of
antibody in the reagent. In the absence of drug in the sample, the antibody binds the
conjugated 11-nor-∆9-THC-9-COOH -labeled G6PDH. When free drug is present in
the sample, the antibody will bind to the free drug and the unbound 11-nor-∆9-THC-
9-COOH -labeled G6PDH exhibits its maximal enzyme activity. The G6PDH activity
is measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm because of conversion of NAD to
NADH.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was performed and evaluated according to the CLSI Document EP5-A2,
Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods. The
sponsor conducted precision studies on the Hitachi 717 analyzer using samples
containing 11-nor-∆9-THC-9-COOH. Samples were prepared by spiking a
negative human urine pool with 11-nor-∆9-THC-9-COOH for all three cutoff
values. Samples were tested in 2 replicates per run, 2 runs per day for 22 days,
total N=88. The qualitative and semi-quantitative results confirmed by GC/MS for
the cutoff values of 25 (THC 25), 50 (THC 50), or 100 ng/mL (THC 100) are

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor performed recovery studies by serially diluting a spiked urine pool
containing 11-nor-∆9-THC-9-COOH for all three cutoff concentrations (THC 25,
THC 50 and THC 100 ng/mL). Each sample from these studies was run in 10
replicates on the Hitachi 717 analyzer. The results were averaged and compared

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and value assignment
Stability
A stock solution of 1000 μg/mL 11-nor-∆9-THC-9-COOH purchased from a
commercial source is spiked into the calibrator and controls to the desired
concentration. The concentration of the calibrator and controls are confirmed by
GC/MS. Purity determination and gravimetric preparation using balances calibrated
with NIST traceable weights ensure the accuracy of the stock standard solution. The
sponsor claimed open-recapped and closed stability of 18 months at 2 to 8oC for the
calibrator and control bottles. After the calibrator and control bottles are initially
opened, the screw-on caps can be resealed.The study protocols, summary of the
results and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be adequate.
d. Detection limit:
Performance at low drug concentrations in the semi-quantitative assay was
characterized by determination of recovery (see section b above).
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed studies to evaluate effect of different substances on the
performance of the assay for all three cutoff concentrations. These studies were
performed by spiking structurally related and unrelated compounds into drug-free
and drug-containing urine samples. Drug-containing urine samples were tested at
two different concentrations, +25% and -25% of the cut-off concentration of 25,
50 and 100 ng/mL. Drug-free urine samples were used as controls. % cross-
reactivity was calculated using the cross-reactant concentration that gives a
reaction absorbance which matches the reaction absorbance obtained by the cut-
off calibrator. The cut-off calibrator concentration divided by the cross-reactant
concentration that achieved the matching reactant absorbance x 100% gives the %
cross reactivity. The percent cross-reactivity of the tested compounds is
summarized below:

The following endogenous compounds were added into drug-free urine and drug
containing urine sample at the concentrations of ±25% surrounding all three
cutoff concentrations. The substances listed in the table below were determined
not to interfere at the concentration shown:
THC 25, THC 50 and THC 100
Compound Tested Concentration (mg/dL)
Acetone 1000
Ascorbic acid 500
Creatinine 500

Sodium chloride 2000
Urea 2000
In addition, pH levels of 3 to 11 had no effect on the performance of the assay.
Further, variations in specific gravity between 1.002 and 1.024 had no effect on
results.
The package insert includes the complete list of all structurally related and
unrelated compounds and metabolites tested.
f. Assay cut-off:
Analytical performance of the device around the claimed cutoff is described in
precision section (1 a.) above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
THC 25:
Forty-four (44) positive and forty-three (43) negative unaltered clinical urine
samples were evaluated by the LZI Cannabinoids (cTHC) Enzyme Immunoassay
and compared to GC/MS or LC/MS for 11-nor-∆9-THC-9-COOH concentration.
Results from the study are presented below:
