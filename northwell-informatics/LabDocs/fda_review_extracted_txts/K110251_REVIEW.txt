1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The SYNCHRON MULTI CALIBRATOR, used in conjunction with
SYNCHRON reagents, is intended for use on SYNCHRON Systems for the

Glucose, Inorganic Phosphorus, Lactate, Magnesium, Total Protein,
Triglycerides, and Uric Acid.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Beckman Coulter SYNCHRON CX, LX and UniCel DxC family of analyzers and
SYNCHRON reagents.
I. Device Description:
The SYNCHRON MULTI CALIBRATOR is a liquid, ready-to-use multi-analyte, in
vitro diagnostic calibrator. The SYNCHRON Multi Calibrator is prepared in a
human serum matrix which is stabilized by the use of ethylene glycol. During
manufacture, the multiple constituents are spiked into the matrix at the desired
concentration levels.
The analytes in this calibrator are traceable using prEN ISO 17511 to the following:
Measurand Traceable to:
Albumin (ALB) NIST 927a
Calcium (CA) NIST SRM 915
Cholesterol (CHOL) NIST 911b
Glucose (GLU) NIST SRM 917a
Lactate Manufacturer’s working calibrator
Magnesium (MG) NIST SRM 929
Inorganic Phosphorus (PHOS) / (PHS) / (PO4) NIST SRM 3139a
Total Protein (TP) NIST SRM 927a
Triglyceride (TG) / (TG-B) Manufacturer’s working calibrator
Urea, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) NIST SRM 912a
Uric Acid NIST SRM 913b
Creatinine was removed from the SYNCHRON MULTI CALIBRATOR and is now
separate (k095240). The traceability was changed from NIST traceable to Isotope
2

All serum or plasma donor units used in the preparation of this material were tested
by FDA approved methods and found to be negative for HIV, and HCV antibodies, as
well as non-reactivity for HBs Ag. Because no test method can offer complete
assurance that HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus or other infections agents
are absent, this material should be handled as though capable of transmitting
infectious diseases. This product may also contain other human source material for
which there is no approved test.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None were referenced.
L. Test Principle:
Not applicable
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: Lactate is gravimetrically prepared and is traceable to an older
lot of calibrator. Magnesium is traceable to NIST 929.
Value Assignment: Value assignment of the lactate calibrator is established
by comparing lactate recovery to the previous lot of calibrator and by
evaluating lactate recovery against a commercially available set of standards.
Bottle value assignment occurs by performing multiple runs over multiple
days with the new lot using multiple SYNCHRON Systems—CX5 CE, CX9
Pro, LX20 Pro, DxC800, and two lots of SYNCHRON reagents. Magnesium
value assignment is accomplished using an anchor pool, traceable to the NIST
929 reference method. Bottle value assignment occurs by performing
multiple runs over multiple days on multiple SYNCHRON Systems using two
lots of SYNCHRON reagents.
Stability: Real time stability study data supports the manufacturer labeling that
the Beckman Coulter SYNCHRON Multi-Calibrator is stable for 24 months
when stored unopened at -15 to -20 °C. Real time stability study data
supports an open vial stability claim of 20 days at 2-8°C. Calibrators are not
stored on board the instruments.
