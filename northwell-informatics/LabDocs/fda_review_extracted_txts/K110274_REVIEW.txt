newborns who are at increased risk of having CF and should be selected for
2nd tier testing.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Only for use on the 1235 AutoDELFIA® automatic immunoassay system.
I. Device Description:
The AutoDELFIA ® Neonatal IRT kit assay is a solid phase, two-site
fluoroimmunometric assay based on the direct sandwich technique in which two
monoclonal antibodies (derived from mice) are directed against two separate
antigenic determinants on the IRT molecule. Calibrators, controls and test
specimens containing IRT are reacted simultaneously with immobilized
monoclonal antibodies directed against a specific antigenic site on the IRT
molecule and europium-labeled monoclonal antibodies (directed against a
different antigenic site) in assay buffer. The assay buffer elutes IRT from the
dried blood on filter paper disks. The complete assay requires only one incubation
step.
Enhancement Solution dissociates europium ions from the labeled antibody into
solution where they form highly fluorescent chelates with components of the
Enhancement Solution. The fluorescence in each well is then measured. The
fluorescence of each sample is proportional to the concentration of IRT in the
sample.
The Neonatal IRT kit consists of the following reagents:
1. The anti-IRT-Eu tracer is a stock solution of approximately 50 ug/mL of
mouse monoclonal antibodies.
2. Calibrators consist of filter paper cassettes (Whatman, no. 903) each
containing 1 set of dried blood spots (DBS) with the following concentrations
of IRT: 0 ng/ml, 25 ng/mL, 50 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, 250 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL
of blood.
3. Controls consist of filter paper cassettes (Whatman, no. 903), each containing
2 sets of DBS. Level C1 contains 30ng/mL of blood, level C2 contains 70
ng/mL of blood, and level C3 contains 110 ng/mL of blood. (Note that
1ng/mL blood equals 2.22 ng/mL serum assuming 55% hematocrit). (The
2

--- Page 3 ---
lyophilized controls are produced from trypsin in Tris-HCl buffered salt
solution with bovine serum albumin and protease inhibitors.)
These calibrators and controls were prepared from human blood components
tested using FDA approved methods and shown to be negative for hepatitis B
surface antigen, anti-hepatitis C and anti-HIV 1 and 2 antibodies.
The user has the option of buying an AutoDELFIA Neonatal IRT kit that
provides enough reagents to run 1152 assays (kit B005-212) or 384 assays (kit
B005-204). These kits are identical in composition except for the number of

1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated according to the CLSI Document EP5-A2,
Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement
Methods. Samples # 1 – 7 were prepared from heparinized adult whole
blood containing some endogenous IRT. The hematocrit value of blood
used in sample preparation was measured to confirm that the hematocrit is
within the reference range of newborns (45% – 67%), or adjusted as
necessary. Samples 8 – 10 were prepared from blood suspension
containing washed red blood cells and the hematocrit was adjusted to
52.5% to correspond to the hematocrit of neonates. The dilution was
made with saline-saccarose solution. The whole blood and blood cell
suspensions were spiked with trypsin. The sample 1 was prepared from
unspiked heparinized adult whole blood containing only the endogenous
IRT. The concentrations of the samples were chosen to cover the claimed
measuring range of the kit (16 – 480 ng/mL blood). The IRT activities of
the series of dried blood spot (DBS) samples were measured by three
operators with three AutoDELFIA IRT kit lots in 21 runs over 14
operating days using three AutoDELFIA instruments (9 runs per
instrument). Four replicates each of three kit controls were included in
each run. (In this study one run means a run consisting of two plates tested
20-24 hours apart on the same instrument with stored calibration.) The
within run precision study was performed using one reagent lot only in
order to assess the variation between lots. Separate estimations for the
precision of AutoDELFIA IRT Neonatal IRT assays were calculated with
two options: a full calibration curve in duplicate for each plate and a full
calibration curve for every batch of four plates. Results are summarized
below:

variability. The data was reviewed to be adequate.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated according to the CLSI Document EP6-A2,
Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A
Statistical Approach. The claimed measuring range for this device is 16 –
480 ng/mL blood.
Fresh patient specimens with high IRT concentration were not available.
Therefore, blood drown from one healthy adult was split into two aliquots,
one representing the “low concentration pool” and a second aliquot used
to prepare the high concentration pool. Purified human trypsin was added
to a second pool to obtain a “high concentration” sample. Samples with
intermediate concentrations were prepared by mixing the “low
concentration” sample with the “high concentration” sample. The
hematocrit of the samples was adjusted to 50 to 55% to correspond to the
hematocrit of neonates. The series of samples were used to prepare DBS
by dispensing the prepared samples onto filter paper and dried overnight.
There is no international reference material or reference method for IRT
that could be employed to determine targets for the linearity samples. A
polynomial evaluation of linearity was used for the data analysis. The
mean results for each specimen assayed constituted the data for the
statistical analysis. The assumption of constant variance across all levels is
not fulfilled in the Neonatal IRT kit. Rather, the variance is proportional
across different measurement levels. Therefore, weighted regression
models were used. A linear regression line and second and third order
polynomials were fitted to the data. The results of regression analyses
were compared. The significance of the second and third order
polynomials were evaluated by performing a t- test. Both, the second and
third order regressions have no statistically significant nonlinear terms
(β2, β3) at a 95% significance level (p-value <0.05).
The fitted models are:
Linear: y=10.7+744.1x
2
Second order: y=10.3+ 796.6x - 132.2 x
2 3
Third order: y= 10.4 + 795.5 x- 123.2 x -11.9 x
where y = IRT Concentration (ng/mL blood) and x = dilution point
The relative difference between the linear model and the measured
concentrations of the dilution series ranged between -7.0% and 5.5%.
Results of the comparison between the measured and expected values are
summarized below:

The labeling states that the measuring range of the kit has been
demonstrated to be 16ng/mL- 480ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
The AutoDELFIA ® Neonatal IRT kit also includes calibrators and
controls which need to be employed in assay calibration and quality
control (QC) testing. The kit calibrators and controls are DBS prepared
from blood cell suspension consisting of washed human red blood cells
and artificial serum. The blood used to prepare the kit calibrators is spiked
with purified human trypsin to cover the range of 0 – 500 ng/mL blood,
whereas the kit controls are spiked at the clinically relevant concentration
area (control levels 30, 70, 110 ng/mL blood).
Traceability: There is no international reference material that can be used
as the primary calibrator and no reference method that can be used to
assign values. The IRT concentration is traceable to the in-house primary
calibrators prepared from Human Pancreas Trypsin. The primary
calibrators are a dilution series of trypsin made gravimetrically with Tris-
HCl buffered solution with bovine serum and protease inhibitors. Protein
concentration of the trypsin raw material has been determined
spectrophotometrically using an Extinction Coefficient (A289, 0.1%
solution, 1 cm pathway) of 1.45. The possible change of trypsin
immunoreactivity occurring during the lyophilization step performed
during primary calibrator manufacturing is corrected by measuring the

IRT concentration of the lyophilized calibrators against non-lyophilized
calibrators. The primary calibrators are stored at -60 to -80oC.
The primary calibrators are used to monitor the level of the secondary
calibrators.
Value assignment: The primary and secondary calibrators are in house
materials that are used for the A-F level specific calibrators. The
acceptance criteria for value assignment were reviewed and found to be
adequate.
Stability: Real time stability studies evaluating shelf-life, shipping
stability and on-board stability for the entire kit were performed, including
the calibrators and controls. The protocols and acceptance criteria were
reviewed and found to be adequate. The AutoDELFIA ® Neonatal IRT kit
assay reagents, controls and calibrators are stable for 12 months when
stored unopened at 2 – 8° C and 14 days on-board at 2 - 8 0C.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of the Blank (LoB) for the AutoDELFIA ® Neonatal IRT kit
was determined in accordance with the CLSI guideline EP17-A: Protocols
for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation. 120
measurements of two sample types, the zero calibrator and dried human
blood spots (3 samples of “zero” calibrator and 2 unaltered blood
samples), were tested in six separate runs, replicates of four, over three
operating days.
The Limit of the Blank was determined to be 0.53 ng/ml, the 95th
percentile of the distribution of the test values.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) is defined as the sample concentration
where the 95% of measurements exceeds LoB. The Limit of Detection
(LoD) is estimated to be 2.9 ng/mL blood based on 576 determinations of
4 low level samples.
e. Analytical specificity:
Analytical specificity was deemed to be identical to the predicate and
appropriate cross reactive and interfering factors have been tested and
cleared under the previous device (k003668).
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
12

--- Page 13 ---
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Internal and external method comparison studies were evaluated according
to the CLSI Document EP9-A2, Method Comparison and Bias Estimation
Using Patient Samples: Approved Guideline.
Internal studies: Routine newborn screening DBS leftover samples
(N=201 retrospective specimens) in the range of the kit (16.3 - 439
ng/mL) and DBS prepared from spiked samples (N=53) were tested and
compared between the new device and predicate device. These studies
were performed using three lots of kits. The samples were run in
singlicate.
The assumptions of ordinary least squares regression analysis are not
fulfilled in the IRT assay because the standard deviation across the
measuring range is not constant. Therefore, weighted Deming analysis
was applied and the variance ratio (l, lambda) was estimated to be 1 (i.e.
the variances of the methods were considered to be of equal size across the
measuring range for the AutoDELFIA IRT). The results are shown below:

Screening performance study: This study was performed in a U.S. state
public health laboratory. The initial total number of acquired samples was
comprised of 2287 routine screening left-over specimens and 20
specimens diagnosed/confirmed positive for CF. However, 338 samples
were excluded because of run rejected unacceptable QC results. Further,
42 specimens were rejected due to the poor quality and missing
information. Additionally, one sample was excluded suspecting
contamination and 10 more were excluded because the age of the new
born was greater than the 31 day limit in the study. Therefore, the final
total number of samples tested was comprised of 1916 samples (1896
routine screening left-over specimens + 20 confirmed positive specimens).
The specimens were analyzed in singlicate using both the proposed and
predicate devices according to the respective package inserts. These
studies were conducted by two laboratory technicians. The confirmed CF
positive specimens were dispersed in a blinded fashion throughout the
multiple assay runs. Three levels of kit controls were run in duplicate at
the beginning on each plate to validate the assay runs for both the tested
and the predicate method. None of the assays were outside the QC
acceptance criteria. (See section 5: Expected Values/Reference Range
below for more information about the IRT cut off values.)

Negative % agreement = (1786 / 1800) * 100% = 99.2% (CI 98.7% - 99.6%)
*As shown in the table above, there were 28 discrepant samples (14 + 14)
when measurements obtained with the proposed assay were compared to
the predicate measurements. However, all of these samples were
originally classified as screen negative samples. Therefore, of the total
1916 samples tested, only 14 samples are false positive samples.
Screening results based on 99% percentile:
Furthermore, of the confirmed CF specimens (N=20) both the proposed
and predicate assays classified all these specimens as test positive with the

A regression analysis was performed to compare the proposed assay to the
predicate assay for the external method comparison study. The
assumptions of ordinary least squares regression analysis are not fulfilled
in the assays. Namely, the standard deviation across the measuring range
is not constant. Therefore, weighted Deming regression is more
appropriate regression method and is shown in the table below:

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
The quantitative determination of human IRT from DBS allows identification
of a population of newborns with elevated IRT who are at an increased risk of
having CF. The identification is based on the use of a cut-off value or a
percentile, which distinguishes between the unaffected and affected
individuals.
The screening strategy for CF varies within different laboratories, the most
common being the two-tier strategy IRT/DNA. It is known that IRT values
and the frequency of CF vary according to geographic and local
demographics. Therefore, it is important that each laboratory establishes its
own reference range and cut-off value from a representative sample
population. Some laboratories choose to set the cut-off at the top 1% to 5% 1.
Selection of the cut-off percentile depends on the sensitivity and specificity
objectives of the screening program. Choice of a cut-off e.g. 5% of the daily
IRT results increases screening sensitivity, whereas selection of a cut-off e.g.
1% minimizes the number of samples referred to second tier testing. More
information about cystic fibrosis screening algorithms can be found in reports
by European Cystic Fibrosis Society 2, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation 3, and U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 4.
The positive predictive value of the assay may vary depending on the
prevalence of the disease in the population being tested. The phenomenon of
transient (non-CF) neonatal hypertrypsinemia, predominately occurring in the
first few days of life, is the primary cause of false high IRT screening results.
High IRT results may also occur in neonates with low APGAR scores and in
African-American infants. IRT levels decline with age of specimen collection.
The use of a second level testing, either DNA or repeat IRT on a second
specimen, has been shown to reduce the number of false positives. Healthy
carriers of CF mutations may produce a false positive IRT results at a rate
about three times that in the general population. False negative IRT values are
known to occur in some CF newborns that present with meconium ileus. IRT
screening in combination with mutation analysis as a second-tier test will
result in the identification of CF carriers. Follow local requirements for
follow-up testing.
