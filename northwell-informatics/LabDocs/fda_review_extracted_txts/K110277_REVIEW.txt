L. Test Principle:
The RAPIDPoint 405 system uses multiple wavelength spectrophotometry (CO-oximetry) to
measure the transmission of light through a sample of neonate whole blood to determine
concentrations of hemoglobin derivatives and bilirubin. The RAPIDPoint 405 system
aspirates the whole blood sample at the sample port and then transfers the sample to the CO-
ox sample chamber. As the sample flows through an optical chamber, the CO-ox optics head
directs light through the sample and to a polychromator that measures the intensity of
transmitted light at different wavelengths. Iterative least squares analysis is used to determine
raw bilirubin values. Raw values are then corrected for hematocrit to produce nBili results.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Quality control precision was performed by using three levels of RapidQC®
Complete (quality control materials) and one level of Calibration Verification
Material (CVM®). For all of the quality control precision testing, six RP405
instruments were used at one internal site. There were a total of 5 different operators
who performed the testing during the study. The test protocol used was adopted from
CLSI document EP5-A2, ‘Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative
Measurement Methods’. One lot of each aqueous control material was used
throughout the study. The three levels of ampoule Complete QC along with CVM
level 1 were run in duplicate, twice per day, per level on each instrument for a
minimum of 20 days. Each “run” of duplicate results was spaced at least 2 hours apart
from each other. The repeatability and within laboratory precision for each control
product and level were calculated and compared with internal precision guidelines.
All data was included in the analysis. The results were as follows:
Level N Mean (mg/dL) Total SD (mg/dL) % Total CV
RapidQC Control 516 20.4 0.80 3.9
Material Level 1
RapidQC Control 516 10.6 0.54 5.1
Material Level 2
RapidQC Control 517 5.0 0.26 5.2
Material Level 3
Calibrator 514 24.1 0.79 3.3
Verification Material
Additionally, reproducibility was performed using whole blood specimens from in-
house donors collected in lithium heparin green top tubes. Whole blood specimens
were fully oxygenated, altered to tHb levels of 12-22 g/dL and spiked with bilirubin
concentrations between 3-25 mg/dL. Prepared samples were run on RP405 in syringe
and capillary modes. Each run had a single target bilirubin level at three different tHb
levels in triplicate. Runs were performed for nBili levels across the measuring range
(3, 5, 12, 16, 20, 23, and 25 mg/dL). Five operators participated in this study. The
precision results are summarized as follows:

The results were as follows for the manual quality control:
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The measuring range of this device is 2.1-30 mg/dL. Linearity by dilution was
performed using whole blood from a single donor that was split into two pools: one
pool was altered to a bilirubin concentration of ~40 mg/dL and the other pool was left
unaltered (0.5-1.5 mg/dL). Nine sample pools were created by using various portions
of each pool to span the measuring range (2-30 mg/dL). Each pool was run in random
order on one RP405 analyzer in syringe mode in replicates of four in one day. The
data was analyzed in accordance with CLSI EP-6. The data was fit to linear,
quadratic, and cubic models and the linear model was found to have the best
mathematical fit. The linear regression generated is Y=-0.558+ 1.05x, R=0.999.
Samples range tested from 2.0 to 41.7 mg/dL.
These results demonstrate the linearity of the device across the claimed measuring
range of 2-30 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There is no unique calibration measurement for nBili. The tHb calibration curve is
used in nBili measurements. The calibrator for tHb was cleared in k031560.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection was determined in accordance with CLSI EP-17A. Whole
blood was collected from eleven donors. For the blank samples, blood was left
9

--- Page 10 ---
unaltered and exposed to light for a minimum of five hours. Low level samples were
altered to have bilirubin concentrations in the range of 0.6 to 2.0 mg. The samples
were each assessed in replicates of 6-12 over three days on four RP405 instruments in
syringe mode for a total of 90 blank and 78 low level samples each.. The limit of
blank (LOB) was calculated from these results using the 95 percentile of the
th
ascending rank ordered values for each instrument. The LOD was calculated to be
0.5 mg/dL. LoQ is determined to be 2.1 mg/dL based on a 13% CV.
The nbili measuring range is 2.1 – 30 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed on four RP405 instruments using fully oxygenated
whole blood that was prepared to have 17 g/dL tHb and either 3 mg/dL or 20 mg/dL
unconjugated bilirubin. The samples were split and spiked with either the potential
interferent or an equivalent volume of diluent and run on the RP405 system in syringe
mode. Each run had a control and test sample in triplicate and three runs of each
interferent were performed. Bias was calculated for each substance tested (bias=
mean test-mean control) as was the interference (% interference = bias/mean control
*100).
For each substance tested, the bias was calculated (bias = (mean test – mean control))
as well as the percent of interference (% effect of interference = (bias / mean
control)*100). A substance was defined as a significant interferent if the bias (mean
nBili test value – mean nBili control value) exceeds a calculated limit. Any
compound that resulted in greater than 13% bias when tested at 5 mg/dL or 10% bias
when tested at 20 mg/dL was considered an interferent. Hemolysis, Indocyanine
Green, Lipid, Beta Carotene (at 0.22 mg/dL) and high and low pH do not interfere
with the measurement of nBili on RP405. Evans Blue, Fluorescein, Methylene Blue,
Sulfan Blue, and Cyanmethemoglobin are all interfering substances. The results of
the interference testing are as follows:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison was performed at an internal site. Whole blood umbilical cord
samples were obtained and the samples were spiked with unconjugated bilirubin at
concentrations that span the measuring range. The samples were run on the RP405
and the RL1265 analyzer in both the syringe and capillary modes in single replicate.
There were three operators that performed the study and there were a total of 43
samples. Deming regression was performed on each individual observation from the
RP405 and RL1265 to determine the slope and intercept. The results yielded a linear
regression of y = 0.975x + 0.391 with an r2 of 0.996 using a range of nBili data from
2.3 to 29.0 mg/dL.
In addition, the sponsor also performed a method comparison at three external clinical
sites using at least three typical point of care operators testing a minimum of 40
unadulterated neonatal whole blood clinical specimens per site and 5 samples at sites

2 and 3 that were spiked using commercially available unconjugated bilirubin to
expand the range of the samples. The highest naturally occurring RL1265 nBili value
measured at the external clinical trials was 23.9 mg/dL. As a surrogate for rare
naturally occurring high nBili samples, supplemental spiked cord blood was used to
demonstrate the full reportable range. Umbilical cord blood was used as it mimics
neonate samples because, unlike adult blood, cord whole blood contains native fetal
hemoglobin and neonate cells. Deming regression was performed on each individual
observation from the RP405 and RL1265 to determine the slope and intercept.
