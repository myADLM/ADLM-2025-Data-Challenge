L. Test Principle:
The Axis-Shield Anti-CCP assay is an ELISA based on the detection of IgG
autoantibodies in human serum or plasma towards a synthetic CCP containing
modified arginine residues (CCP2 peptides). The test provides an additional tool in
the diagnosis of patients with RA. The wells of the microtitre strips are coated with
purified CCP2 peptides. Patient sample is added and specific autoantibodies in
diluted serum or plasma bind to the antigen-coated surface. The wells are then
washed to remove unbound components. In the second incubation, the conjugate, an
enzyme-labeled polyclonal antibody to human IgG, binds to any surface-bound
autoantibodies. After further washing, specific autoantibodies are detected by
incubation with the Substrate. Addition of Stop Solution terminates the reaction,
resulting in a colored end-product. The amount of Conjugate bound is measured in
absorbance units. In the qualitative protocol, the amount of Conjugate bound by the
sample is compared with that bound by the Reference Control. In the semi-
quantitative protocol, the concentration of anti-CCP autoantibody can be estimated by
interpolation from a dose-response curve based on Calibrators.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility: Two kit combinations were used throughout the
study including reagents, positive and negative controls, quality control (QC)
controls and reference control. Testing was carried out by at least two
operators. The sample and controls were assayed in replicates of two, twice
daily, for 20 days (n=80 for each control/sample) and the sampling order was
randomized on the individual testing days throughout the study.
Quantitative assay: nine human plasma or serum based samples were used for
the study (20 days x 2 runs per day x2 replicates=80 determinations per
sample; 40 per kit lot combination). The sample concentrations are detailed in
the table below:
Sample Target Concentration
(U/mL)
Assay positive control 25.0
Assay reference control 5.0
Serum sample 1 5.0

QC 2 (plasma) 7.8
QC 3 (plasma) 16.0
QC 4 (plasma) 56.0
QC 5 (serum) 97.0
QC 6 (serum) 146.0
Five additional samples (A1-A5) were tested to verify imprecision of the
study. These samples were prepared from processed human plasma to achieve
target CCP concentrations of 5.2, 3.9, 185.0, 191.4, 205.2 U/mL. Assays were

Linear range was determined using a total of 13 samples pools with high anti-
CCP levels (4 plasma sample pools, 2 serum sample pools, 4 spiked serum
sample pools and 2 spiked plasma sample pools) diluted using an anti-CCP
negative sample, according to the dilution scheme recommended in CLSI
document EP6-A. Samples were tested in triplicates. Polynomial regression
was used to assess linearity. The observed concentrations (Y) were plotted
against the expected concentrations (X) at each dilution, for each of the
samples. The % recoveries were 76.6 to 114.1%. The results are summarized

Traceability: There is no recognized standard reference material for anti-CCP.
Calibrators and Controls (positive and negative) are prepared in-house and
arbitrary units are assigned during the development process. The Calibrators
and Controls for the Axis-Shield anti-CCP submission device are the same
final formulation as those previously cleared for use with DiastatTM anti-CCP
device (k023285) with the exception of the additional 300U/mL calibrator.

Control values are summarized in the table below:

Positive 25.0 U/mL 13.0 – 37.0 U/mL
Reference 5.0 U/mL 2.7 – 7.3 U/mL
Stability: The claimed shelf life is 52 weeks at 2-8°C. The claimed open vial
stability is 3 months from first opening. Real-time stability studies are
ongoing; current data supports 13 weeks but testing will continue until at least
108 weeks.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB): An anti-CCP negative serum sample was diluted 1/100
in sample diluent and run for a total of n=60. LoB = Result at position [0.95 x
N + 0.5], where N is the number of blank measurements (n=60). The LoB
B B
was the average of the ranked results at positions 57 and 58. LOB was
determined to be 0.348U/mL.
Limit of Detection (LoD): four serum samples (mean concentrations of 1.35,
0.70, 0.68 and 0.52 U/mL) were assayed by two operators in replicates of
eight, using two lots of kit components for a total of 15 replicates per sample
and n=60. LoD = LoB + (1.643 x pooled SD). The claimed LoD is 1.04
U/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous Interference: Endogenous interferents tested included
hemoglobin, bilirubin, triglyceride (intralipid solution), rheumatoid factor and
total protein (bovine serum albumin, BSA). Six samples with differing anti-
CCP concentrations (range from 2.7 U/mL to 261 U/mL) were spiked with at
least two different concentrations of the interfering substances. The results
are summarized in the table below:
Potential Interfering No interference found up to
compound the following concentrations
Hemoglobin 4 mg/mL
Bilirubin 0.2 mg/mL
Triglyceride (Intralipid
15 mg/mL
Solution)
Rheumatoid factor 200 IU/mL

Hook Effect/Over the Range Results: Two plasma samples with elevated anti-
CCP concentrations (2809 U/mL and 2736 U/mL) were used to establish
whether a possible hook effect is observed in the Axis-Shield Anti-CCP
(FCCP600) assay. Samples were diluted to create a range from 3000 U/mL to
< 100 U/mL. Calibrators, kit controls and the samples dilutions were tested in
duplicate and the data generated was plotted for visual assessment of assay
high dose hook. The percentage recoveries of the dilution-corrected samples
on the test device are within ± 20% of the actual concentrations determined on
the predicate device. No high dose hook effect was observed.
f. Assay cut-off:
The Axis-Shield Anti-CCP (FCCP600) uses the same cut-off value as the
predicate device: k023285 (FCCP200)
Semi-Quantitative Protocol:
Samples with results ≤ 5 U/mL are defined as negative.
Samples >5 U/mL are defined as positive.
Qualitative Protocol:
Absorbance ratio Result interpretation
< 0.95 Negative
≥ 0.95 to ≤ 1.0 Borderline – recommend repeat testing
> 1.0 Positive
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Specimens were collected from 514 subjects including 229 RA patients, 150
asymptomatic, apparently healthy and 135 non-RA patients with other
diseases. Diagnosis of RA was made according to the 1987 American College
of Rheumatology (ACR) revised criteria. Specimens spanned the Axis-Shield
Anti-CCP (FCCP600) measurement range.
Using a cutoff of 5.0 U/ml, concordance analysis was performed on all sample
(n=514). The results are summarized below:
Diastat™ Anti-CCP (FCCP200)
Positive Negative Total
Positive 179 4 183
Axis-Shield Anti-CCP
Negative 1 330 331

% Positive agreement = 99.4% (179/180)
% Negative agreement = 98.8% (330/334)
% Total agreement = 99.0% (509/514)
In addition, 65 of the 514 samples that were within the measurement range of
both the new and predicate device (1.04 U/mL to 100 U/mL) and 8 additional

samples around the assay cut-off were assayed in duplicate with both
Diastat™ Anti-CCP FCCP200 and Axis-Shield Anti-CCP FCCP600 assays.
Results of the regression analysis of the 73 samples are summarized in the
table below:

n Slope Slope 95% CI Intercept r
CI
73 0.920 0.83 to 0.99 1.06 0.57 to 1.73 0.94
b. Matrix comparison:
Nineteen matched serum and plasma samples were collected in the following
anticoagulant tubes: serum clot tube, serum separator tube (SST), Potassium
EDTA plasma tube, Lithium Heparin plasma tube, Sodium Citrate plasma
tube. Specimens spanned the Axis-Shield Anti-CCP (FCCP600)
measurement range. In order to obtain samples with varying CCP
concentrations covering the measurable range of the assay (1.04 U/mL – 300
U/mL), 15 of the 19 serum/plasma samples were spiked with a high anti-CCP
positive sample and 4 samples were tested unmodified. In addition to these
samples, 16 spiked-in serum/plasma matched specimens with anti-CCP
concentrations at approximately 2.5 U/mL and 5.5 U/mL for the different tube
type and anticoagulant were evaluated. Samples with results <LoD were
excluded from the study analysis.
For all samples, Passing Bablok regression plots were generated by plotting
the mean concentration observed from the control tube type (serum) versus
the mean concentration for each test collection tube. The corresponding
regression slopes and intercepts as well as correlation coefficients are
summarized in the table below:
