1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for use, below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Opiate Enzyme Immunoassay is intended for the qualitative and semi-
quantitative determination of opiates in human urine, at a cutoff value of 300
ng/mL when calibrated against morphine. The assay is designed for prescription
use with a number of automated clinical chemistry analyzers.
The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of (1) enabling laboratories to
determine an appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a
confirmatory method such as GCMS or (2) permitting laboratories to establish
quality control procedures.
This assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific
alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed
analytical result. Gas or liquid chromatography (GC/MS or LC/MS) is the
preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment
should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the
preliminary result is positive.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The assay is for prescription use
4. Special instrument requirements:
Clinical chemistry analyzers capable of maintaining a constant temperature,
pipetting sample, mixing reagent, measuring enzymatic rates at 340 nm and
timing the reaction accurately can be used to perform this homogeneous
immunoassay.
Performance studies in this submission were performed on the Hitachi 717.
I. Device Description:
The Opiate Enzyme Immunoassay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay ready-to-
use liquid reagent. The assay is comprised of two ready-to-use liquid reagents, R1 (1
x 100 mL or 1 x 1000 mL) and R2 (1 x 37.5 or 1 x 375 mL). R1 solution contains a
mouse monoclonal anti-morphine antibody, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD), stabilizers, and sodium azide (0.09%) as a preservative.
R2 solution contains glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) labeled with
morphine in buffer, with sodium azide (0.09%) as a preservative. The kits will be
provided in two configurations, with R1 x 100 mL; R2 x 37.5 mL and with R1 x 1000
mL; R2 x 375 mL.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
No Standards/Guidance Referenced
L. Test Principle:
The Opiate Enzyme Immunoassay is a competitive enzyme immunoassay based on
competition between drug in the sample and drug labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for a fixed amount of antibody in the reagent.
Enzyme activity decreases upon binding to the antibody, and the drug concentration
in the sample is measured in terms of enzyme activity. In the absence of drug in the
sample, morphine-labeled G6PDH conjugate is bound to antibody and enzyme
activity is inhibited. When free drug is present in the sample antibody binds to the
free drug, the unbound morphine-labeled G6PDH then exhibits its maximum enzyme
activity. Active enzyme converts nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to
NADH resulting in an absorbance change measured spectrophotometrically at 340
nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
Performance was evaluated on the Hitachi 717
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was determined by spiking morphine standards into drug free urine
pool at various concentrations surrounding the cutoff: -100%, -75%, -50%, -
25%, cutoff, +100%, +75%, +50%, +25% +100%. Concentrations were
confirmed by GC/MS. Testing for both the with-in run and between-run
studies were performed by testing each sample in replicate, with two runs per
day, for 22 days. The qualitative and semi-quantitative results are presented
below:

the table below. Each sample was assayed in replicates of 10 on the Hitachi
717 analyzer in the semi-quantitative mode. The results were averaged and

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Five levels of calibrators (0, 150, 300, 600, 1000 ng/mL) and two levels of
control material (225 and 375 ng/mL) are available for use with the Opiate
Enzyme Immunoassay. These calibrator and control solutions are human
urine based and were previously cleared under k020769
Stability and Value assignment:
Stability and value assignment of the calibrators and controls was evaluated in
k020769.
d. Detection limit:
Performance at low drug concentrations in the semi-quantitative assay was
characterized by determination of recovery (see section b above).
e. Analytical specificity:
The cross-reactivity of various potential interfering drugs was tested by
spiking a final concentration of up to 3,000,000 ng/mL of each substance into
drug-free urine. The structurally un-related compounds were spiked into
samples containing morphine at concentrations ±25% of the cutoff.
Compounds that interfered with the performance of the device were further
tested at ±50% of the cutoff concentration. Samples evaluated in both semi-
quantitative and qualitative mode. Results summarize the approximate
quantity of each compound that is equivalent in assay reactivity to the 300
ng/mL morphine cutoff and are presented below:

The package insert includes a complete list of all structurally related, structurally
un-related and endogenous compounds tested.
Specific gravity:
Eight drug-free urine samples with specific gravity ranging from of 1.002 to 1.027
(1.002, 1.005, 1.008, 1.010, 1.012, 1.018, 1.02, 1.027 were spiked with morphine
to achieve concentrations of ±25% of the cut-off (225 ng/mL or 375 mg/mL).
The original and the spiked samples were tested with Opiate Enzyme
Immunoassay on the Hitachi 717 in the qualitative and semi-quantitative modes.
The results indicate that there is no positive or negative interference due to
specific gravity.
pH:
The effect of pH was tested across the range of 3 to 11 (pH 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
and 11). Drug free urine sample pools were pH adjusted then divided into two
aliquots and then spiked with morphine to achieve ±25% of the cutoff. No
positive or negative interference due to pH was observed.
f. Assay cut-off:
See Detection Limit Section, above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 88 unaltered clinical samples (44 positive and 44 negative) were tested
with the Opiate Enzyme Immunoassay on the Hitachi 717 analyzer. The opiate
concentrations for each sample were confirmed by GC/MS or LC/MS. Results
are shown in the tables below:
