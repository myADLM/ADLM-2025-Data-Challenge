L. Test Principle:
The Stratus® CS Acute Care™ D-dimer method is a two-site sandwich assay based
upon solid phase Radial Partition Immunoassay (RPIA) technology. In this
procedure, dendrimer linked monoclonal antibody is added to the center portion of a
square piece of glass fiber paper in the DDMR TestPak. This antibody recognizes a
distinct antigenic site on the D-dimer molecule. Sample is then added onto the paper
where it reacts with the immobilized antibody. After a short incubation, a conjugate
consisting of enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody directed against a second distinct
antigenic site on the D-dimer molecule is pipetted onto the reaction zone of the paper.
During this second incubation period, enzyme-labeled antibody reacts with the bound
D-dimer, forming an antibody-antigen-labeled antibody sandwich. The unbound
labeled antibody is later eluted from the field of view of the Stratus® CS analyzer by
applying a substrate wash solution to the center of the reaction zone. By including
substrate for the enzyme within the wash solution, initiation of enzyme activity
occurs simultaneously with the wash. The enzymatic rate of the bound fraction
increases directly with the concentration of D-dimer in the sample. The reaction rate
can be measured by an optical system that monitors the reaction rate via front surface
fluorescence. All data analysis functions are performed by the microprocessor within
the analyzer.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance: Refer to original 510(k) submissions k022976, k051597
and k063356 for analytical performance data (precision/reproducibility,
linearity/assay reportable range, detection limit, analytical specificity, assay cut-
off, traceability, stability, expected values).
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison was determined in a total of 396 citrated samples from
patients suspected of PE using the Stratus® CS Acute Care™ D-dimer assay
and the INNOVANCE® D-Dimer assay. The range of D-dimer values in the
correlation studies was 54 to 4506 ng/mL [µg/L] FEU.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity: Citrated Plasma
The Stratus® CS Acute Care™ D-dimer assay was evaluated on the Stratus
CS® Analyzer in a multi-center study to validate the exclusion of PE using
fresh citrated plasma specimens collected from 730 consecutive patients
presenting to the emergency department with suspected PE. Of these 730
patients, 75 were excluded for a total of 655 patients available for final
analysis.

All patients were evaluated using the Wells’ rules to estimate a high, moderate
or low pre-test probability (PTP) of PE. Patient specimens were tested with
the Stratus® CS Acute Care™ D-dimer assay and results were compared to a
cut-off value of 450 ng/mL [µg/L] (FEU). A D-dimer result <450 ng/mL
[µg/L] (FEU) was considered negative and a D-dimer result ≥450 ng/mL
(FEU) [µg/L] was considered positive.
Patients with a positive D-dimer result and/or high PTP were evaluated by
imaging methods, e.g. spiral CT and/or VQ scan. Patients with a negative D-
dimer result and a low or moderate PTP underwent imaging at the physician’s
discretion, and patients with negative imaging results were followed for three
months to evaluate potential development of PE.
The overall prevalence of PE in those patients available for final analysis was
14.0 % (92/655). The following instrument-specific sensitivity, specificity
and negative predictive value (NPV) with upper and lower 95 % confidence
limits (CL) were obtained with the Stratus ® CS Acute Care™ D-Dimer

The Stratus® CS Acute Care™ D-dimer assay was evaluated on the Stratus CS ®
Analyzer in a multi-center study to validate the exclusion of PE using fresh
heparinized plasma specimens collected from 468 consecutive patients presenting
to the emergency department with suspected PE. Of these 468 patients, 41 were
excluded for a total of 427 patients available for final analysis.
All patients were evaluated using the Wells’ rules to estimate a high, moderate or
low pre-test probability (PTP) of PE. Patient specimens were tested with the
Stratus® CS Acute Care™ D-dimer assay and results were compared to a cut-off
