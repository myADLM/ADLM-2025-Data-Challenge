The Tina-Quant hemoglobin A1c Gen.2 assay is an in vitro diagnostic reagent system
intended for quantitative determination of mmol/mol hemoglobin A1c (IFCC) and %
hemoglobin A1c (DCCT/NGSP) in hemolysate or whole blood on Roche clinical
chemistry analyzers. HbA1c determinations are useful for monitoring of long-term blood
glucose control in individuals with diabetes mellitus.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription use only.
There are two application methods: Whole Blood and Hemolysate. Hemolysate should be
prepared and stored for analysis if whole blood cannot be analyzed within 8 hours of
collection.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Performance was evaluated on the Roche Integra 800 Analyzer
I. Device Description:
The Roche Tina-quant Hemoglobin A1c Gen. 2 consists of two working reagents (R1 and
R2) and an Hemolyzing reagent. The R1 reagent consists of antibody reagent, MES buffer:
0.025 mol/L; TRIS buffer: 0.015mol/L, ph6.2; HbA1c antibody (bovine serum): ≥0.5 mg/ml;
stabilizers; preservatives (liquid). R2 reagent (Polyhapten reagent) consists of MES buffer:
0.025 mol/L; TRIS buffer: 0.015 mol/L, ph 6.2, HbA1c polyhapton: ≥ 8µg/mL; stabilizers;
preservatives (liquid)
The Roche Tina-quant Hemoglobin A1c Gen. 2 consists of two application types: The Whole
Blood application uses an automated on-board sample pretreatment with hemolyzing reagent.
The Hemolysate application consists of a manual pretreatment step which is performed using
the hemolyzing reagent before the sample is placed on the analyzer.

L. Test Principle:
Anticoagulated whole blood is hemolyzed prior to determination of HbA1c by a
turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay (TINIA). Liberated hemoglobin (Hb) in the hemolyzed
sample is converted to a derivative having a characteristic absorption spectrum and measured
biochromatically. The instrument calculates the %HbA1c from the HbA1c/Hb ratio
according to a user selected protocol.

This tube type precision study was performed along with the matrix comparison study
on the Roche Integra 800 analyzer with K -EDTA, Na-heparin, NaF/K-Oxalate, and
2
NaF/Na -EDTA. K2-EDTA was used as the reference anticoagulant since it was
2
originally cleared in k072714. Duplicate samples from the matrix studies were
calculated for average SD for 3 partitioned bins covering the ranges tested. The
average SD and CV in each of the 3 bins for all tube types evaluated were
summarized in the table below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Previously established in k072714
Stability studies were conducted using all three candidate anticoagulants, Na-heparin,
NaF/K-Oxalate, and NaF/Na -EDTA using the hemolysate and whole blood
2
applications. The hemolysate is stable for 4 hours at 15-25˚C, 24 hours at 2-8˚C and 6
months at (-15) – (-25) ˚C when using Na-heparin, NaF/K-Oxalate, and NaF/Na -
2
EDTA. Whole Blood samples should be analyzed within 8 hours of collection. The
labeling indicates hemolysate should be prepared and stored for analysis if whole
blood cannot be analyzed within 8 hours of collection. Frozen stability of HbA1c has
not been determined for samples treated with anticoagulants Na-heparin, NaF/K-
Oxalate, and NaF/Na -EDTA.

d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined by assaying
an analyte free sample (blank) and five low HbA1c samples according to CLSI
guideline EP17A. Each sample was assayed twice a day for three days on two Roche
Integra 800 Analyzers. The detection limits are summarized in the table below.
Platform/Method LoB (%A1c) LoD (%A1c)
Roche Integra 800 analyzer 2.3% 2.5%
The assay has a reportable range of 4.3-24.8% on the Roche Integra 800 analyzer.
e. Analytical specificity:
Previously established in k072714
Interference studies for Na-heparin, NaF/K-Oxalate, and NaF/Na -EDTA were not

performed. See previously cleared interference data in k072714.

b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study was performed using Na-heparin, NaF/K-Oxalate, and
NaF/Na -EDTA. K2-EDTA was used as the reference anticoagulant. 132 total
2
samples were analyzed for HbA1c. Each single set of samples were analyzed on the
Roche Integra 800 analyzer and values obtained. Samples ranged from 4.97 – 15.97%
HbA1c. The results using Passing/Bablock linear regression analysis are as follows:

An additional comparison study was performed to evaluate the two application
methods (whole blood versus hemolysate). 30 whole blood samples were collected in
Na-Heparin, NaF/K-Oxalate, and NaF/ Na -EDTA. Each whole blood sample was
2
hemolyzed manually per labeling instructions and then placed on the Integra analyzer
for the automated hemolysate application. The results using simple regression
analysis are as follows:
