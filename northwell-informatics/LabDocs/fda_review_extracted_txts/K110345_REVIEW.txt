510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
k110345
B. Purpose for Submission:
Modification of the intended use of ScanView system to include the detection and
enumeration of the cells in urine specimens for chromosomes 3, 7, 17 and 9p21 locus
stained by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with Vysis UroVysion™ Bladder
Cancer Kit.
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Applied Spectral Imaging Ltd., ScanView System
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Automated FISH detection and enumeration of the cells for chromosomes 3, 7, 17,
and 9p21 locus in urine specimens from subjects with transitional cell carcinoma of
the bladder.
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The ScanView System is an integrated digital imaging system constructed of an
external microscope, motorized multi slide stage, camera, and a workstation. It is
designed to acquire images of cells and enable identification and examination of
cells of interest. Pathologists can view and scan cells and record the image, using
both bright field and fluorescent illumination. The acquired images can be
enhanced, archived, retrieved and printed. The automated microscope enables Z
motion of the slide and the motorized stage enables its X-Y motions. The
microscope also includes motorized filter turret containing fluorescence filters.
2. Principles of Operation:
The ScanView System is a software controlled system that includes features such
as: acquisition of images, views, editing, relocation, enhancement capabilities,
automatic/manual counting, classification and printing. The ScanView System
can also scan each field of view with several fluorescent filters, each in multiple
focal planes, generating and displaying a combined image. The ScanView
System works with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on urine samples
stained by FISH using the Vysis UroVysion™ Bladder Cancer Kit. The system
automatically captures cells from predefined regions and classifies the cells
according to predefined cells categories. After the scanning, each cell is
presented in a gallery and the pathologist can approve, modify or reject the call
for each cell. The result is updated accordingly, saved in the database and
optionally printed out in a report.
3. Modes of Operation:
Semi-automated; manual capture of selected regions with computer-assisted
interpretation
4. Specimen Identification:
Manual keyboard entry into the Case Data Manager
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
1

--- Page 2 ---
Standardized cell preparations of urine specimens are applied to microscope slides
and then hybridized with the Vysis UroVysion™ Bladder Cancer Kit.
6. Calibration:
Calibration is prepared at the time of installation.
7. Quality Control:
The accuracy of the system depends on the laboratory following the quality
control instructions as recommended by the manufacture of the Vysis
UroVysion™ Bladder Cancer Kit. The control slides are tested on the ScanView
System according to the same procedure as patient slides. It is the responsibility
of the pathologist to assure that the control slides meet quality acceptance criteria.

G. Intended Use:
1. Indication(s) for Use:
The ScanView System is an automated scanning microscope and image analysis
system. It is intended for in vitro diagnostic use as an aiding tool to the
pathologist or cytogeneticist in the detection, classification and enumeration of
cells of interest based on color, intensity, size, pattern, and shape. The ScanView
is indicated as an accessory to the following FDA cleared/approved devices to
detect the following cell types:
1. CEP® X Spectrum Orange™/CEP® Y Spectrum Green™ DNA Probe Kit
and is limited to the analysis of CEP XY probes via high magnification
capture and analysis of interphase nuclei. CEP XY is indicated for use to
assess the effectiveness of bone marrow transplantation in opposite-sex
transplants.
2. Human breast cancer containing the HER-2/neu gene labeled in Red and the
centromere of chromosome 17 labeled in Green via fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) in interphase nuclei from formalin-fixed, paraffin
embedded human breast cancer tissue specimens with Vysis® PathVysion™
HER-2 DNA Probe kit. Results from the PathVysion™ Kit are intended for
use as an adjunct to existing clinical and pathologic information used as
prognostic factors in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. The
2

--- Page 3 ---
PathVysion™ kit is further indicated as an aid to predict disease-free and
overall survival in patients with stage II, node positive breast cancer, treated
with adjuvant cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil (CAF)
chemotherapy.
3. Cells in urine specimens, stained by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
using Vysis UroVysion™ Bladder Cancer Kit to detect aneuploidy for
chromosomes 3, 7, 17, and loss of the 9p21 locus, from persons with
hematuria suspected of having bladder cancer. The results are intended for
use, in conjunction with and not in lieu of current standard diagnostic
procedures, as an aid for initial diagnosis of bladder carcinoma in patients
with hematuria and subsequent monitoring for tumor recurrence in patients
previously diagnosed with bladder cancer.
The ScanView System is to be used as an adjunctive automated enumeration tool
in conjunction with manual visualization.

A method comparison study was conducted at four clinical sites: 35 slides
from site 1, 129 slides from site 2, 11 slides from site 3 and 20 slides from site
4 for a total of 195 slides. Measurements of the 195 slides using results
obtained from the ScanView System were compared to the manual method.
The manual evaluation through the microscope eyepieces was performed in
accordance with the instructions stated in the Vysis UroVysion™ Bladder
Cancer Kit protocol. For each slide, the first 25 morphologically abnormal
cells were analyzed. If ≥4 of the 25 cells were observed with gains for 2 or
more chromosomes (3, 7 or 17) in the same cell, or >12 of the 25 cells were
detected with zero 9p21 signals, the analysis was stopped and the case was
considered positive. If no positive cell in the first 25 cells was detected, the
analysis continued until 4 cells with multiple chromosomes were detected, or
12 cells with zero 9p21 signals, or until the whole slide had been analyzed.
For ScanView System, each slide was scanned using automatic scan method
on hybridization region. The system scanned slide, detected the cells,
reported the counts of the red (CEP 3), green (CEP 7), aqua (CEP 17) and
gold (9p21) signals for each cell and classified the cells to normal and
abnormal classes. After scanning, an image gallery of the analyzed cells
along with their signal count and the relevant statistic was presented to the
pathologist who would review the resultant cells and make decision on reject
or modify the classification of each cell. The results interpretation criteria
used for manual method according to instruction of UroVysion™ Bladder
Cancer Kit protocol was followed for the ScanView Bladder FISH System to
determine the positive/negative result for each sample.
The results of comparison study by evaluating 195 slides with the ScanView
Bladder FISH System and with the manual method are summarized below:
Manual Method
Positive Negative Total
Positive 41 0 41

Negative 1 153 154

Overall Agreement: 99.5% (95% CI: 97.2% – 99.9%)
b. Precision/Reproducibility:
A total of six (6) patient slides stained with UroVysion™ Bladder Cancer Kit
were tested to examine the precision and reproducibility of the performance of
the automatic system. The slides were scanned and reviewed according to
ScanView operating instructions. The slides were selected to cover the range

The reproducibility was also analyzed based on signal distributions of CEP 3,
CEP 7, CEP 17, and LSI 9p21 for each slide. All negative slides showed a
signal distribution of below the recording criteria, e.g. record the
chromosomal pattern only if there is a gain (i.e., 3 or more signals) of two or
more of CEP 3, 7, 17 or there is a loss of LSI 9p21. The results of signal
distribution of four probes in 3 positive slides are summarized in the table

To assess the variation in observed signal values, the data were further
analyzed with additional statistical models. Results indicated that the large
variation (%CV) observed in the signal distribution is due to the heterogeneity
of differences within each slide and not from measurement error of the device.
