DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
k110381

EOS#, BAS%, BAS#, RBC, HGB, HCT, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW, PLT, and

E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The CELL-DYN Emerald 22 System is a bench-top analyzer consisting of the
main analyzer with data module, display station, and printer. The main analyzer,
data module, and display station are housed in a single chassis. The printer is a
stand-alone module.
The CELL-DYN Emerald 22 open sampler is equipped to aspirate blood from a
collection tube that has been opened and is held under the open sample aspiration
probe.
2. Principles of Operation:
The CELL-DYN Emerald 22 performs three types of measurements: Electrical
Impedance, Flow Cytometry and Absorption Spectrophotometry.
Electrical Impedance Counting is based on the measurement changes in an
electrical current produced by particles (cells suspended in conductive liquid) as
they pass through an aperture. The change produces a measurable electrical pulse
and the number of pulses is proportional to the volume and size of the cell that
produced it.
Flow Cytometry (UNI-Flow) is based on a concept of active sample flow and
passive sheath. The diluted sample is introduced into the flow cell under pressure
and the sheath is utilized only to maintain the sample stream. Optical
measurement of five parameters uses only light scatter.
Absorption Spectrophotometry is the method used to measure Hemoglobin (Hb).
An oxyhemoglobin chromogen is formed and measured when sample is mixed
with a cyanide-free lytic reagent. An LED light source and photo detector are
used to detect the chromogen. The Hb concentration is directly proportional to
the light absorption of the sample. An initial blank reading is made on reagents
only, and then a comparison of the blank and sample readings determines the Hb
concentration of the sample.
3. Modes of Operation:
CELL-DYN Emerald 22 only operates in an open tube mode.
4. Specimen Identification:
Samples are identified by laboratories’ sample identification procedure.

Instrument capability includes barcode, auto numbering and manual keypad entry.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Whole blood EDTA specimens should be well mixed prior to specimen analysis.
The specimen tube is aspirated by direct open tube sampling by the aspiration
probe of the CELL-DYN Emerald 22 analyzer.
6. Calibration:
Commercial calibrators and/or whole blood specimens may be used to confirm
the accuracy of the CELL-DYN Emerald 22. The analyzer is calibrated at the
factory. Calibration verification is performed by Abbott service personnel at
installation. Calibration verification criteria should be established. The
manufacturer recommends performing calibration verification when indicated by
quality control, after major maintenance and service, at least every 6 months, and
as directed by laboratory regulatory agencies.
7. Quality Control:
Abbott recommends use of the commercially prepared CELL-DYN 22 Plus
Controls to verify performance of the CELL-DYN Emerald 22. This tri-level
control contains fixed cells and is assayed by Abbott to determine expected
recovery ranges. Frequency of performing quality control runs should be
determined by the customer.

J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy:
Each parameter of the CELL-DYN Emerald 22 was compared to the predicate
analyzer CELL-DYN 3700. A total of 1025 whole blood specimens were
tested in duplicate on both analyzers at three clinical sites. The actual number
(N) for each measurand in the correlation summary varies from total number
of sample runs because the protocol required the presence of valid results for
duplicate runs on both analyzers, in order to be included in the result analysis.
The N represents the valid number of samples used in the analysis for each
measurand. Correlation analysis was performed by regressing the first valid
replicate (by site, analyzer, run date, run time) of the CELL-DYN Emerald 22
against the first valid replicate of the CELL-DYN 3700. The correlation
coefficient and bias acceptance criteria were met. Bias is within the limits
with no more than 5% of the observed individual bias calculations outside of

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
The following tables represent the results of imprecision (reproducibility)
specifications for the CBC and WBC differential parameters using normal
fresh blood. The studies were performed at two sites. The stated CV% in the
table represents instrument imprecision from 16 runs and 20 replicates per
run. Precision for the WBC differential parameters is represented by standard
deviation (SD).

c. Linearity:
The analytical measurement range (AMR) was established by using fresh
whole blood and commercial kits. Fresh blood specimens (1025 samples)
were run in duplicate and pooled correlation data were analyzed using
Passing-Bablok regression over the whole data set. Linearity for MCV and
the upper limit for HCT were derived from fresh blood correlation analysis.
Measurand Units* AMR
WBC K/µL 0.4 - 90
RBC M/µL 1.20 - 8.30
HGB g/dL 5.5 - 22.0
HCT % 12.1 - 66.1
MCV fL 53.2 - 118.4
PLT K/µL 11 - 1485
*Results are expressed in Standard (US) units
d. Carryover:
Carryover was determined by running whole blood specimens with high target
values (HTV) of WBC, RBC, HGB, and PLT. Each specimen was run in
triplicate followed by three aspirations of whole blood specimens with low
target values (LTV). Carryover % was calculated by using the following
equation: % Carryover = (LTV1-LTV3)/ (HTV3-LTV3) x 100. Results were
within specifications (≤1%) for WBC, RBC and HGB and (≤2%) for PLT.
Measurand Low Target High Target % Carryover
WBC >0 and <3 >90 <1%
RBC >0 and <1.5 >6.20 <1%
HGB >0 and <5.0 >22.0 <1%

e. Interfering Substances:
Studies for interference were evaluated for bilirubin, lipemia and hemolysis.
Statistical analysis of the data was based on CLSI EP7-A2.
Interference due to bilirubin was evaluated in 40 samples spiked with a low
bilirubin control reagent for WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT and PLT, and 34
samples for WBC differentials. The estimated bilirubin concentration was
7.26 mg/dL for each sample. Bilirubin interference was observed for LYM%
and PLT measurements; however, a review of data indicated that the
interference effect was caused by the artifacts from the sample manipulation
procedure. No other measurands were impacted by bilirubin.
Lipid interference was evaluated in 40 samples added with Intralipid for WBC
and differentials, and 44 samples for RBC, HCT, and PLT. The estimated
lipid concentration was 600 mg/dL for each sample. The data demonstrated
that lipid interferes with the HGB determination at 600mg/dL. No other
measurands were impacted by lipid at this concentration.
Interference due to hemolysis was evaluated in 34 samples for RBC, HGB,
HCT and PLT, 32 samples for WBC, and 32 samples for WBC differentials.
The interference of hemolysis was observed for HCT; however, a review of
data indicated that the interference effect was caused by the artifacts from the
sample manipulation procedure. No other measurands were impacted by
hemolysis.
f. Background Counts:

and were verified by each site against the specifications. Start-up background
specifications were achieved before data collection. The CELL-DYN Emerald
22 background specifications are as follows:
Background Specifications:
Measurand Background Concentration Limits*
WBC ≤ 0.5 K/µL
RBC ≤ 0.1 M/µL
HGB ≤ 0.2 g/dL
PLT ≤ 10.0 K/µL
DIF** ≤ 100 cells
* Results are expressed in Standard (US) units except for DIF
** DIF number of cells counted on scattergram
2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
a. Stability Studies:
The Performance with Aged Blood (PAB) test procedure was used to evaluate
the performance of the CELL-DYN analyzers with blood stored at refrigerated
(RF) and room temperatures (RT) as it ages over a specified time period. The
mean of duplicate runs was utilized to calculate the difference from the 1-hour
analysis point to all other scheduled analysis points for each specimen. In
order to obtain the % difference, the results were divided by the mean of the
1-hour time point. The study was performed on a total of ten (10) donor

subjects with two sets of five (5) subjects. The study demonstrated data was
within ±5.4% for room temperature storage up to 24 hours and up to ±10% for
refrigerated temperature storage up to 12 hours to support the claim.
b. Reference Intervals:
A total of 135 samples from males and females were collected to establish the
overall reference range. The manufacturer recommends each laboratory
establish its own reference range.
