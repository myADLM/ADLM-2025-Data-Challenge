H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s) for pleural fluid pH:
See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use for pleural fluid pH:
The ABL835 FLEX analyzer is intended for in vitro testing of pleural fluid
samples for the pH parameter.
The pH measurement of pleural fluid can be a clinically useful tool in the
management of patients with parapneumonic effusions. Critical values: pH >7.3 is
measured in uncomplicated parapneumonic effusions. All pleural effusions with a
pH of <7.3 are referred as complicated parapneumonic effusions; they are
exudative in nature.

L. Test Principle:
The pH in Pleural fluid is measured by potentiometry. The potential of an electrode
chain is recorded using a voltmeter, and related to the concentration of the sample, as
described by the Nernst equation. An electrode chain describes an electrical circuit
consisting of a sample, electrode, reference electrode, voltmeter, membranes and
electrolyte solutions. The reference electrode maintains a stable, fixed potential
against which other potential differences can be measured. The potential is not altered
by sample composition.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The evaluation of precision for the pleural fluid on the ABL835 FLEX
analyzer was conducted using pooled human pleural fluid samples adjusted to
three different pH levels (7.1, 7.3 and 7.5). The pH adjusted pleural fluid
samples were frozen and thawed prior to testing. Each pH adjusted pleural
fluid sample was analyzed on three ABL835 FLEX analyzers, 2 runs per day,
and 2 aliquots per run for 20 days. The precision studies were performed
according to CLSI EP5-A2.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity data for pleural fluid collected in the comparison study (see Section
M2a below) was used to demonstrate linearity on the ABL835 FLEX
analyzer. Linear regression analysis of the results yielded the following:
y = 1.063x – 0.446, r² = 0.994.
The measuring range for pleural fluid samples is pH 7.0 to 7.5.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The traceability, stability and expected value of pH calibration solutions
(Calibration Solution 1 and 2) was previously cleared under k041874. The pH
control solution kits (QUALICHECK3+ and QUALICHECK5+) were
previously cleared under k904733 and k980135, respectively. The traceability,

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A correlation study was performed between the proposed device (ABL835
analyzer) and the predicate device (Roche Omni C which is currently
marketed as Roche Cobas b221) according to CLSI protocol EP9-A2. This
study was performed using 58 pleural fluid samples, pH ranged from 6.93 to
7.57, obtained from 29 patients. Some of the samples were spiked with either
NaOH or acetic acid to adjust the pH, so that the samples were evenly
distributed in the pH range 7.0 to 7.5. All pleural fluid samples were frozen
and thawed prior to testing. Eight samples were tested per day on two
analyzers per day over a span of eight days. A single measurement obtained
on an ABL835 analyzer was compared to an average of duplicate
measurements obtained on the predicate device. Linear regression analysis of
the results yielded the following:
y = 1.063x – 0.446, r² = 0.994.
A bias plot of individual data points showed that all values were within ±0.1
pH unit of the predicate device. At medical decision points of pH 7.2 and 7.3,
the bias was 0.0074 and 0.0138, respectively.
