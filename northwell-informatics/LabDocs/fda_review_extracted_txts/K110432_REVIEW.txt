c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Value assignment: For each of three lots of the VisuCon-F Frozen Coag
Screen N and VisuCon-F Frozen Coag Screen ABN controls the mean values
were assigned to fibrinogen, PT, and APTT by testing 20 vials over 4 days
with 5 vials tested per day (n = 20). Fibrinogen values were generated for the
VisuCon-F Frozen Coag Screen N control only. Ranges were then assigned
by calculating the mean ±2 standard deviations (SD). System #1 (STA
Compact, HemosIL™ PT-Fib, HemosIL™ APTT-SP, Stago Fib-5), System #2
(STA Compact, Stago Neoplastine Cl+ and APP-Automate) and System #3
(BCS™ System, Siemens Innovin, Actin FSL) were used and all testing was
performed internally. Acceptance criteria set by the sponsor, for the mean
value for each assay within each platform/reagent system are as follows:

All mean values for the three lots of VisuCon-F Frozen Coag Screen N and
Frozen Coag Screen ABN fell within the acceptance criteria listed for each
platform/reagent system.
Open Vial Stability: Open-vial stability of the VisuCon-F Coag Screen N and
VisuCon-F Coag Screen ABN control plasmas was performed using System
#1 (STA Compact, HemosIL™ PT-Fib, HemosIL™ APTT-SP, Stago Fib-5),
System #2 (STA Compact, Stago Neoplastine Cl+ and APP-Automate) and
System #3 (BCS™ System, Siemens Innovin, Actin FSL). After initial
thawing for the recommended time at 37°C the control plasmas were tested
for PT, APTT and fibrinogen then stored at 2-8°C and on-board the
instrument (15-22°C) in the original vial and re-tested at 4 hours and 8 hours.
Acceptance criteria are as follows:
• Results at 4 and 8 hour time points:
Within ±10% of the time 0 result for PT and APTT
Within ±15% of the time 0 result for Fibrinogen
A minimum of two lots of control plasma were included in the study. All
results fell within the above stated acceptance criteria. The data supports an
open-vial 8 hour stability at 2-8°C or on-board the instrument (15-22°C).
Closed Vial Stability: The closed vial shelf-life stabilities of the VisuCon-F
Frozen Coag Screen N and VisuCon-F Frozen Coag Screen ABN controls
were assessed through real-time stability studies. The instrument and
reagents used for the closed vial stability testing were as follows: System #1
(STA Compact with reagents HemosIL™ PT-Fibrinogen, HemosIL™ APTT-
SP, and Stago Fib-5). The VisuCon-F Frozen Coag Screen N study included

five lots of control and the VisuCon-F Frozen Coag Screen ABN tested three
lots. All controls were stored at their recommended storage temperature of
≤ -60°C and tested internally at the indicated time points for PT and APTT.
Fibrinogen was assessed on the normal control only. Acceptance criteria set
by the sponsor, are as follows:
• ±10% of the original assigned value for PT and APTT
• ±15% of the original assigned value for Fibrinogen
The study data for the VisuCon-F Frozen Coag Screen N and VisuCon-F
