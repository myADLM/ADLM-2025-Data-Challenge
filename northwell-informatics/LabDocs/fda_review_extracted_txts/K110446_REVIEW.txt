H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
DAT Oral Fluid Amphetamine (OFAMP) is an in vitro diagnostic test for the
qualitative and semiquantitative detection of amphetamine in human oral fluid at a
cutoff concentration of 120 ng/mL in neat oral fluid. The specimen must be
collected exclusively with the Intercept® Oral Specimen Collection Device.
Semiquantitative test results may be obtained that permit laboratories to assess
assay performance as part of a quality control program and to estimate a dilution of
the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as LC/MS/MS.
DAT Oral Fluid Amphetamine provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A
more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a
confirmed analytical result. Chromatography/mass spectrometry is the preferred
confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be
applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive
results are used.
The Oral Fluid DAT Control Set B is for use as assayed controls with the DAT Oral
Fluid assays on automated clinical chemistry analyzers for human oral fluid
samples collected with the InterceptOral Specimen Collection Device.
The Oral Fluid DAT Qual Cal B calibrators are designed for the calibration of oral
fluid assays for drugs of abuse on automated clinical chemistry analyzers for human
oral fluid samples collected with the Intercept Oral Specimen Collection Device.
The Oral Fluid DAT SQ Cal B calibrators are designed for the calibration of oral
fluid assays for drugs of abuse on automated clinical chemistry analyzers for human
oral fluid samples collected with the InterceptOral Specimen Collection Device.

L. Test Principle:
The assay is based on the kinetic interaction of microparticles in a solution (KIMS) as
measured by changes in light transmission. In the absence of sample drug, soluble
drug conjugates bind to antibody-bound microparticles, causing the formation of
particle aggregates. As the aggregation reaction proceeds in the absence of sample
drug, the absorbance increases. When an oral fluid sample contains the drug in
question, this drug competes with the drug derivative conjugate for microparticle-
bound antibody. Antibody bound to sample drug is no longer available to promote
particle aggregation, and subsequent particle lattice formation is inhibited. The
presence of sample drug diminishes the increasing absorbance in proportion to the
concentration of drug in the sample.
The Intercept® Oral Specimen Collection Device contains a preservative buffer that
dilutes the neat oral fluid sample. The calibrator and control levels are set at diluted
levels so that sample absorbance values can be compared directly to the absorbance
values of the calibration curve. The assay result is reported as a positive or negative
result relative to the neat oral fluid cutoff of 120 ng/mL.
NOTE: To correlate a semi-quantitative Intercept® result from the assay or the
associated LC/MS/MS confirmation result to a neat oral fluid value, the result from
the Intercept sample should be multiplied by a factor of 3.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All analytical performance data was collected on human oral fluid samples
collected with the Intercept Oral Specimen Collection Device and analyzed on
the Roche MODULAR P analyzer. The Intercept collection device includes a
diluent that results in a dilution of approximately 1/3. The assay cannot be used
to measure undiluted (neat) samples. Analyte concentrations refer to the neat
oral fluid concentration, unless otherwise noted.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Two studies were performed with the assay to evaluate precision.
In the first study, a d-amphetamine solution was added to each of 9 samples
which were obtained from a human oral fluid pool of samples collected with
the Intercept® Oral Specimen Collection Device to achieve concentrations
at approximately -100 %, -75 %, -50 %, -25 %, 0 %, +25 %, +50 %, +75 %,
and +100 % of the cutoff calibrator value. The samples were tested for
precision in qualitative and semiquantitative modes. Following a CLSI
(EP5-A2) precision protocol, samples were tested in 2 replicates per run, 2
runs per day for 21 days, total n = 84. One lot each of reagent, calibrator,
and control were used during the study and nine calibrations were performed
during the study.

In the second study, a d-amphetamine solution was added to neat human oral
fluid sample pools at concentrations of 60, 90, 150, and 180 ng/mL. Each
spiked sample pool was then processed through each of 21 Intercept® Devices
to achieve final concentrations at approximately -50%, -25%, +25 %, and
+50 % of the cutoff calibrator value. The intra-assay precision of the samples,
including the processing of the samples through the collection device was then
tested in qualitative and semiquantitative modes with the Oral Fluid
Amphetamine assay.

960 ng/mL. Each level was processed through 2 separate Intercept
collection devices. The diluted sample from both Intercept devices was
then analyzed once in semi-quantitative mode. The data below was
analyzed with one calibration using one lot of reagent.
Results were as follows:

240 130.0
480 103.7
960 100.5
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The assay is calibrated against d-amphetamine.
Calibrators and control materials are specified in the labeling but are
supplied separately from the reagents. For the qualitative assay, only CAL 2
(40 ng/mL) is required. For the semi-quantitative assay, six levels of
calibrator material, ranging in concentration from 0 to 320 ng/mL are
required. Calibrators and controls consist of a synthetic oral fluid matrix
spiked with known concentrations of d-amphetamine.
The concentration of amphetamine in the calibrators and controls is verified
by LC/MS/MS.
The open vial stability claim for calibrators and controls is 20 days after
opening when stored at 2–8° C. The closed vial stability claim for
calibrators and controls is one year from the time of manufacture when
stored at 2–8° C.
The sponsor’s stability protocols were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
Performance at low drug concentrations in the semi-quantitative mode was
characterized by determination of recovery (see section b above).

e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed analytical specificity studies on four categories of
potential interferents: structurally related substances, structurally
unrelated substances, substances endogenous to oral fluid, and food and
dental substances.
Cross Reactivity to Structurally Related Compounds
Cross-reactivity was evaluated by spiking various concentrations of
similarly structured drug compounds into a drug-free oral fluid pool
collected with the Intercept Oral Fluid Specimen Collection Device. By
analyzing various concentration of each compound the sponsor determined
the concentration of the drug that produced a response approximately
equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the assay. Results of those
studies appear in the table below:

No cross-reactivity was detected for d-Ephedrine, l-Ephedrine, or
Phendimetrazine when tested at a concentration of 10,000 ng/mL.
Interference from Structurally Unrelated Compounds
Potential interference from structurally unrelated compounds was tested in
both semi-quantitative and qualitative mode by spiking the potentially
interfering compound into pools of human oral fluid collected with the
Intercept Oral Fluid Specimen Collection Device. Both a positive
concentration (+50% of the cutoff) and a negative concentration (-50% of
the cutoff) of amphetamine were evaluated. All potential interferents were
tested at a concentration of 10,000 ng/mL.

No negative or positive interference was seen in this study.
Interference from Endogenous Interferents and pH
Potential interference from substances endogenous to oral fluid were
tested in both semi-quantitative and qualitative mode by spiking the
potentially interfering substance into pools of human oral fluid collected
with the Intercept Oral Fluid Specimen Collection Device. Both a positive
concentration (+50% of the cutoff) and a negative concentration (-50% of
the cutoff) of amphetamine were evaluated.
The following potential endogenous interferents were spiked into the
negative and positive oral fluid samples at the noted concentrations. No
negative or positive interference was seen in this study.

An additional study was performed in which samples containing
amphetamine at +50% and -50% of the cutoff with pH ranging from 2.0 to
8.5 were tested. All of the samples above the cutoff read positive and all of
the samples below the cutoff read negative.
Interference from Food and Dental Products
The following potential interferents were evaluated by spiking into oral
fluid samples collected with the intercept device: Alcohol (ethanol),
Antiseptic Mouthwash, Baking soda, Whole blood, Cough Syrup,
Cranberry juice, Hemoglobin, Hydrogen peroxide, Orange juice, Sodium
chloride, Sugar, Toothpaste, and Water. None of these substances caused
positive or negative interference.
The following potential interferents, which are either consumed or placed
in the mouth, were evaluated by asking participants to consume or use the
specific substance, after which oral fluid samples were collected and

spiked with amphetamine at concentrations of cutoff – 50% and cutoff +
50%: Antacid, Chewing tobacco, Cigarettes, Chewing gum, Cola, Hard
candy, and Tooth whitening strips. None of these substances caused
positive or negative interference when oral fluid samples were collected at
least 10 minutes after consumption or use, as specified in the labeling for
the collection device.
There is the possibility that other substances and/or factors not listed
above may interfere with the test and cause false results, e.g., technical or
procedural errors.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the
claimed cutoff concentration appears in the precision above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Two method comparison studies were performed. In the first study, 19
positive and 21 negative samples were analyzed. In order to evaluate the
performance of the entire system, three measurements were taken on each
specimen: the LC/MS/MS concentration of the neat sample, the
LC/MS/MS concentration of the diluted Intercept sample, and the
immunoassay concentration of the diluted Intercept sample.
Sample description: clinical oral fluid samples
Number of study sites: one
Description of the site: manufacturer’s facility
Type of study site: manufacturer’s staff
Operator description: manufacturer’s staff
Number of instruments used: one
The LC/MS/MS values of the neat and diluted samples confirmed the
dilution ratio of approximately 1/3. When the LC/MS/MS values of the
neat oral fluid samples were compared to the immunoassay values, the
following results were obtained. Note: The values obtained in this study
were collected from samples containing amphetamine prior to the
collection step. Therefore the results reflect the performance of the entire
system including the collection step.

In the second study, 40 negative and 40 positive samples were analyzed. These
included four negative near cutoff samples and four positive near cutoff samples.
Note: this study was performed on samples already collected with the Intercept
collection device. Therefore the results below do not reflect any inaccuracy inherent
in the collection process itself. When the LC/MS/MS values of the diluted samples
were compared to the immunoassay values, the following results were obtained.
