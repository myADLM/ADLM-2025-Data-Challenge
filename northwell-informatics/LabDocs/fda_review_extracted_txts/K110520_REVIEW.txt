The Biolis 12i Clinical Chemistry analyzer is a discrete photometric chemistry
analyzer with ion-selective electrode (ISE), with direct quantitative measurement
of sodium, potassium, chloride, and glucose in serum. It is a device intended for
the in-vitro, spectrophotometic determination of general chemistry assays for
clinical use. The Biolis 12i includes an optional Ion Selective Electrode (ISE)

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None
L. Test Principle:
There are two different measuring principles employed, potentiometry and
photometry/colorimetry.
Potentiometry: A potential is recorded using a voltmeter, which relates to the
concentration of the sample. A reference electrode is used to provide a stable, fixed
potential against which other potential differences can be measured. This measurement
technique is used for sodium, potassium, and chloride.
Photometry/colorimetry: The change of absorbance measured at 340 nm is monitored for
the glucose reaction. The amount of absorbance change is proportional to the
concentration of the glucose being present in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run precision for ISE and glucose was determined on a single Biolis
12i using three serum based control materials. 20 replicates of each of the
control level were evaluated with the following results:
Analyte Parameter Control 1 Control 2 Control 3
Sodium Mean (mmol/L) 146.7 125.5 138.9

Day-to-day precision for ISE was determined from one run per day for 15
days on a single Biolis 12i. Day to day precision for glucose was determined
from 5 different days with runs of five replicates on a single Biolis 12i. Both
precision studies used three serum based control materials and results were

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study for ISE was performed using a high serum sample mixed
with a reference solution (with known conc. of NaCl or KCl) to create various
target concentrations of analytes. 6 levels of each of the analytes measured
were prepared and tested in triplicate on one Biolis 12i analyzer. A linearity
study for glucose was performed using commercially available serum linearity
standards with target range from 25to 725 mg/dL. 6 levels of different
concentrations of glucose were measured in triplicate on one Biolis 12i
analyzer. The observed values were plotted against the expected values and
an appropriate line fitted by standard linear regression. Results were
summarized below:

Results of the study support the sponsor claims for the following
measuring/linearity ranges:
Sodium Potassium Chloride Glucose
100 – 200 mmol/L 1 – 10 mmol/L 70 – 200 mmol/L 25 – 540 mg/dL
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
All the analytes in the calibration solutions are traceable to a reference method
and the analyte targets are assigned based on the reference methods or other
commercially available methods. See table below for traceability.
Analyte Traceability
Sodium Flame photometry
Potassium Flame photometry
Chloride Coulometric titration
Glucose NIST SRM 965b
ISE calibrators- Calibration solutions 1 and 2 had been previously cleared in
k040958 (Toyko Boeki Prestige 24i)
Glucose reagents- previously cleared in k971467 (Carolina Liquid Chemistries)
Stability of the ISE calibration solutions: A real-time stability study was
performed to demonstrate a maximum shelf life of 18 months at storage
temperatures between 15 and 30 degrees C and an open vial stability of 31
days after first opened. Protocols and acceptance criteria has been provided
and found to be adequate.
ISE calibrators have been previously cleared in k050958. Glucose calibrator
has been previously cleared in k070202.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor determined that the detection limit was defined by the linear
range study. The minimum detection limit is defined as the lowest analyte
concentrations over the range that the assay has been shown to be acceptably
linear by using serum control samples at 6 different concentrations and
analyzed by comparing results with the theoretical values. The stated
measuring ranges of the candidate device are as follows. These ranges were
verified by the linearity study (see section M.1.b. above).
Sodium Potassium Chloride
100 – 200 mmol/L 1 – 10 mmol/L 70 – 200 mmol/L
In addition, the sponsor performed a limit of detection study for the glucose

assay according to a modified protocol based on the CLSI EP17-A guideline.
LoB was determined by running 5 low samples multiple times on 2 different
lots of reagents with one instrument to generate 80 measurements. LoD and
LoQ were determined by running 4 low samples four times in two runs with
two different lots of reagents on one instrument generating a total of 64
measurements. LoB was calculated to be 2.48 mg/dL and LoD was calculated
to be 3.81 mg/dL. LoQ was determined to be 7.83 mg/dL based on inter-
assay precision of 9.3%.
The sponsor claimed that the glucose assay has a measuring range of 25 to
540 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was conducted to evaluate the potential endogenous and
exogenous interfering substances. For endogenous interfering substances, the
sponsor tested intralipid, bilirubin, and hemoglobin. For exogenous
interferencing substances, the sponsor tested lithium, bromide, salicylate, and
thiocyanate. Interference studies were performed by spiking serum pool
sample at clinically significant medical decision points for each measurand at
various concentrations of interfering compounds normally found in serum.
Measurements (N=3) obtained from serum containing each potential
interfering substance was evaluated and compared against measurements with
the unspiked samples. The study was conducted for the analytes Na, K, and
CL, and glucose at two analyte concentrations (normal and abnormal). The
sponsor states that interferences are considered to be non-significant if the
bias between the tested and control samples are within ±10% for all the
analytes.
For endogenous interfering substances, the results demonstrate no significant
interference with the sodium, potassium, and chloride when serum contains up
to 19.7 mg/dL of unconjugated bilirubin, 21 mg/dL of conjugated bilirubin,
500 mg/dL of intralipid, or 488 mg/dL hemoglobin, however potassium was
affected by hemolysis. For glucose, the results demonstrate no significant
interference when serum contains up to 20 mg/dL bilirubin, 500 mg/dL
hemoglobin, and 1000 mg/dL of Intralipid.
For exogenous interfering substances, the results demonstrate no significant
interference with the Na, K, and Cl tests when serum contains up to 3.20
mmol/dL lithium, 37.60 mmol/dL bromide, 4.34 mmol/dL salicylate, and 6.88
mmol/L thiocyanate.
Based on the hemolysis interference, the sponsor has the following limitations
in their labeling:

may increase K concentration because of high levels of K in erythrocytes”.
“Drugs and other substances may affect sodium, potassium, chloride, and
glucose determinations. See Young, D.S.1 for a compilation of reported
interferences”

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
To assess the effect of temperature on test results across the recommended range of
ambient temperature (15 – 30oC), the sponsor conducted an ambient temperature
study using 30 native patient samples. Calibrations were performed at each of these
temperatures (15 oC, 23 oC, and 30oC) and testing was performed at all the three
temperatures for each calibration temperature. Protocols and acceptance criteria
provided are found to be adequate. Based on the ambient temperature study, the
sponsor claimed that ambient temperature between 15 - 30oC will not affect the
performance of the device.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
