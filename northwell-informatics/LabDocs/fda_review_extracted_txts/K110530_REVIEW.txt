L. Test Principle:
ABX PENTRA Creatinine 120 CP reagent: Creatinine reacts with alkaline picrate to
form Janousky complex. The rate of increase in the absorbance at 510 nm due to the
formation of creatinine-picrate complex is directly proportional to the creatinine
concentration present in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
For ABX PENTRA Creatinine CP reagent, within run precision was evaluated
for serum using 2 controls and 4 serum specimens tested 20 times in a single
run for each sample. In accordance with the CLSI document, EP05-A, the
sponsor tested 3 specimens and 2 controls in duplicate for 20 days with two
series per day (n =80) on one ABX PENTRA 400 analyzer using one lot of
reagent. The results are given below:

duplicate for 20 days with two series per day (n = 80) on one ABX PENTRA

Urine 3 260.2 2.43 0.93 261.6 5.38 2.06
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated following CLSI guideline EP6-A. For serum linearity,
a spiked serum sample was used as the high sample and a diluted serum
sample was used as the low sample. The intermediate concentrations
consisted of dilutions of the high and low sample to obtain 10 levels with
values ranging from 0.22 to 29.31 mg/dL. For urine creatinine linearity, a
spiked urine sample was used as the high sample and a 0.9% saline sample
was used as the low sample. Ten levels with values up to 459 mg/dL were
tested. For both studies, the mean of 4 replicate measurements were used in
the regression analyses. The linear regression equation for serum was y =
1.066x + 0.0269. For urine the linear regression equation was y = 0.9962x –
0.08.
Based on the results of the linearity study and the limit of detection studies
(see below in d), the sponsor claimed that the reportable range for serum is
0.22 – 18.08 mg/dL and for urine is 2.9 – 282.5 mg/dL. The sponsor has also
provided data to support that automatic dilution can go up to 54.24 mg/dL for
serum and 847.5 mg/dL for urine.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrators and controls used in this submission are previously cleared in
k052007 for ABX PENTRA Multical, ABX PENTRA N Control and ABX
PENTRA P Control and in k070249 for ABX PENTRA Urine Control L/H.
The creatinine material introduced in to the calibrators and its corresponding
value is traceable to NIST reference material SRM967. In this submission,
creatinine values for this assay for urine and serum/plasma are being added to
the existing calibrator and control materials. The assigned target value for the
Multical calibrator is the median of all the results generated for each calibrator
based on 150 measurements on 6 analyzers. The control ranges are calculated
as the target value ± 3 standard deviations (based on 150 measurements on 6
instruments). Please refer to the value assignment sheet in the labeling for lot-
specific values.
Real-time testing was conducted to establish the stability of the calibrator and
control materials. The stability study protocol and the acceptance criteria have
been reviewed and found to be acceptable. The study results support the
following stability claims in the labeling:
Closed-Vial and Open-Vial Stability
Item Storage Conditions Claimed Stability
Reagent Packs Close-Vial 2-8oC 36 months
Open-Vial On system, 2-8oC 19 days
Calibrators Close-Vial 2-8oC 24 months

2-8oC 5 days
15oC to 25oC 12 hours
Urine Controls Close-Vial 2-8oC 24 months
Open-Vial 2-8oC 30 days
To ensure adequate quality control, the sponsor recommends calibrating the
test everyday and every time a new reagent bottle is used. The sponsor also
recommends using quality control samples at least once a day, after each
calibration and when a new bottle is used.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor evaluated Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Blank (LoB) for
ABX PENTRA Creatinine 120 CP reagent for serum and urine samples
following the guidelines in CLSI EP17-A. LoB was determined using
physiological water (0.9% NaCl) assayed 90 times each for Creatinine 120 CP

reagent for serum and Creatinine 120 CP reagent for urine using 3 PENTRA
400 instruments. The LoB values were 0.01mg/dL, and 1.0 mg/dL
respectively.
To determine the LoD, the sponsor used four altered serum or urine samples
with concentrations between LoB and LoB x 4 which were assayed 20 times
for each sample. LoD values were 0.03 mg/dL for Creatinine 120 CP reagent
for serum and 1.4 mg/dL for Creatinine 120 CP reagent for urine.
To determine the LoQ, the sponsor tested a range of low concentration serum
and urine samples 10 times. The % CV and bias vs. the actual concentrations
were calculated. The LoQ was the lowest concentration sample where the %
CV was lower than 15% and the relative bias was inside the +/- 10% range.
The LoQ for serum creatine was determined to be 0.22 mg/dL. The LoQ for
urine creatinine was determined to be 2.9 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
For ABX PENTRA Creatinine 120 CP reagent for serum and plasma, the
sponsor evaluated the effect of hemoglobin, direct bilirubin, total bilirubin,
lipemia (as triglyceride), glucose, ascorbic acid and total protein on pooled
sera at two creatinine concentrations (low and high) spiked with the
interferents, and then compared with unspiked control. Based on the sponsor’s
definition of no significant interference as ≤ 10% of control, the following
interference limit claims were set by the sponsor for each reagent:
Serum/plasma
Hemoglobin: no significant interference up to 500 mg/dL
Triglyceride: no significant interference up to 516 mg/dL
Total bilirubin: no significant interference up to 29.3 mg/dL
Direct bilirubin: no significant interference up to 19.9 mg/dL
Glucose: no significant interference up to 233 mg/dL
Ascorbic acid: no significant interference up to 5.98 mg/dL
Urine
Hemoglobin: no significant interference up to 362 mg/dL
Triglyceride: no significant interference up to 612.5 mg/dL

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were conducted in accordance with CLSI EP9-A2
guidelines. Performance of the ABX PENTRA Creatinine 120 CP reagent for
serum was compared with the predicate device, Olympus/Beckman Creatinine
Reagent (k934361). A total of 165 serum samples (range: 0.45- 16.72 mg/dL)
were used. Data analysis was done using Passing-Bablok regression. The data
demonstrated the device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device based
on Passing-Bablok regression (y = 0.99x + 0.03 [95% CI = 0.98 – 0.99]; r2 =
0.9984).
Performance of the ABX PENTRA Creatinine 120 CP reagent for urine was
compared with the predicate device, Olympus/Beckman Creatinine Reagent
(k934361). A total of 117 urine samples (range: 3.9 – 273 mg/dL) were used.
Data analysis was done using Passing-Bablok regression. The data demonstrated
the device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device based on Passing-
Bablok regression (y = 1.00x -0.60 [95% CI = 0.99 – 1.01]; r2 = 0.9984).
b. Matrix comparison:
To demonstrate comparable performance between serum and lithium-heparin or
EDTA plasma, the sponsor compared 40 samples ranging from 0.52 mg/dL to
15.94 mg/dL for the ABX PENTRA Creatinine 120 CP using PENTRA 400
analyzer. Linear regression analysis for ABX PENTRA Creatinine 120 CP
reagent yielded linear regression equations for lithium-heparin (y = 0.9942x
+0.0275; r = 1.000) and EDTA plasma (y = 1.0409x -0.0119; r = 1.000).
