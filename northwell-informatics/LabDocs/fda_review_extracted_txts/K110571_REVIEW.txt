2. Indications(s) for use:
Telcare Blood Glucose Monitoring System
The Telcare Blood Glucose Monitoring system is intended for the quantitative
measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the
fingertips, forearm, or palm. It is intended for lay use by persons with diabetes to aid in
diabetes management. It is indicated for use at home (over the counter [OTC]) and should
be used only by a single patient and should not be shared. Testing is done outside the
body (in vitro diagnostic use). The Telcare Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of
the Telcare Blood Glucose Meter, Telcare Blood Glucose Test Strips, and Telcare
Glucose Control Solutions. The Telcare Blood Glucose Monitoring system is not
indicated for the diagnosis or screening of diabetes or for neonatal use. Palm and forearm
testing should be done only during steady-state times when glucose is not changing
rapidly. The Telcare Blood Glucose Meter uses cellular data transmission to send test
results to Telcare’s remote database, Telserve, and to receive messages from Telserve.
The Telcare Blood Glucose Monitoring System is not intended to provide automated
treatment guidance or decisions, nor is it to be used as a substitute for professional
healthcare judgment.
Telcare Blood Glucose Test Strips
The Telcare Blood Glucose Test Strips are to be used with the Telcare Blood Glucose
Meter for the quantitative measurement of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood samples
drawn from the fingertips, palm, or forearm. These test strips are intended for lay use by
persons with diabetes and should only be used by a single patient. They are not indicated
for the diagnosis or screening of diabetes or for neonatal use. Palm and forearm testing
should be done only during steady-state times when glucose is not changing rapidly.
Telcare Glucose Control Solutions
The purpose of the control solution is to validate the performance of the Telcare Blood
Glucose Monitoring System by using a test solution with a known amount of glucose. A
control test that falls within the acceptable range indicates the user’s technique is
appropriate and the test strip and meter are functioning properly.
Telserve Data Management System – Home Use
The Telserve Data Management System – Home Use (Telserve – Home) is an accessory
to blood glucose monitoring systems for the review and evaluation of blood glucose test
results to aid in diabetes management. Telserve collects data from blood glucose meters

treatment guidance or decisions, nor is it to be used as a substitute for professional
healthcare judgment.
Telserve Data Management System – Professional Use
The Telserve Data Management System – Professional Use (Telserve – Pro) is an
accessory to blood glucose monitoring systems for the review and evaluation of blood
glucose test results to aid in diabetes management. Telserve collects data from blood
glucose meters such as the Telcare BGM.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Over the Counter
Not intended for use on neonates
Not for the diagnosis of or screening for diabetes mellitus
Not to be used for patients who are dehydrated, hypotensive, in shock, critically ill or in a
hyperosmolar state
Allows testing on the fingertip, palm, or forearm.
Alternative site testing should only be used during steady-state blood glucose conditions
when glucose is not changing rapidly
Alternative site testing (AST) should not be used to calibrate continuous glucose
monitors (CGMs) nor for use in insulin dose calculations.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The Telcare Blood Glucose Meter
I. Device Description:
The Telcare Blood Glucose Monitoring System (Telcare BGM system) consists of a meter,
test strips, and control solutions (Level 1 and Level 2). The Telcare Blood Glucose Meter
(Telcare meter), when used with the Telcare Blood Glucose Test Strip (Telcare Test Strip),
quantitatively measures glucose in capillary whole blood. The Telcare Glucose Control
Solutions (Telcare control solutions) are used by patients to verify the performance of the
Telcare test strips and Telcare meter. An embedded cellular module within the Telcare meter
enables wireless communication between the meter and Telcare’s remote database, called
Telserve Data Management System (Telserve).
Telserve is an accessory to blood glucose meters to assist in the review and evaluation of
blood glucose test results and related information to aid in diabetes management. Telserve
consists of two different levels of functionality:
Telserve Data Management System – Home Use
Telserve Data Management System – Professional Use
Telserve data can be viewed by the patient and by other person(s) authorized by the patient
on a personal computer, or other internet-capable devices, including some smartphones,

provided a validated internet browser is used. The professional use version generates and
returns an informational feedback message documenting compliance with patient-targets for
blood glucose levels and testing frequency, directly to the patient via a secure internet portal.
The specific browsers that have been validated for use are indicated in the labeling.

L. Test Principle:
The test is based on electrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of capillary
action. The electrical current generated by the reaction of glucose with the reagent of the
strip is measured by the meter and is displayed as the corresponding blood glucose level.
The strength of the current produced by the reaction depends on the amount of glucose in the
blood sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run and between-run precision studies were performed. For the within-run
precision studies 10 replicates of each lot of test strips, for each of 5 spiked venous
whole blood glucose levels and two control solution levels were analyzed using 10
meters, and 3 lots of test strips. Within-run studies were performed daily for 20 days.
Results are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using 3 lots of test strips, 10 Telcare blood glucose meters,
and 8 venous whole blood samples with glucose levels ranging from 20-600 mg/dL,
obtained by spiking pooled venous blood with a glucose solution. Each glucose level
was analyzed 40 times over 3 test strip lots. Linear regression analysis for each test
strip lot compared to the YSI resulted in:
Test Strip Lot 1: Y = 1.0193x -2.242, r2 = 0.9988
Test Strip Lot 2: Y = 1.0149x-1.5461, r2 = 0.9989
Test Strip Lot 3: Y = 1.0464x-1.5289, r2 – 0.9990
The claimed range of measurement for this device is 20 to 600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The device showed traceability to a laboratory analyzer, YSI 2300 in the method
comparison studies in 2.a. below.
Two levels of control material (Level 1 and Level 2) are available for use with this
system.

30°C and 85% humidity. The accelerated results support a 16 month shelf life claim
at 15-30°C and the real-time studies a 3 month open vial stability claim at 15-30°C.
Real-time stability studies for shelf-life of the control solutions are ongoing.
c. Detection limit:
The reportable range is 20 to 600 mg/dL based on linearity/reportable range studies
above (section M.1.b.). The low and high detection limits for the Telcare Blood
Glucose System have been set at 20 and 600 mg/dL. Readings below or above these
values will generate a “Lo” or “Hi” result, respectively.
d. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor tested substances for interference using 1 lot of test strips, 10 meters, and
3 concentrations of glucose (70-90 mg/dL, 110-130 mg/dL, and 300-330 mg/dL).
Analyte levels were achieved by adjusting human venous blood levels. Samples were
then spiked with the following interfering substances. Each sample was analyzed 10
times. The labeling states that elevated concentration of L-DOPA, ibuprofen,
tolazamide, ascorbic acid, fructose, uric acid, cholesterol, bilirubin (unconjugated and
conjugated), and triglyceride may affect glucose test results. The following table lists
the concentrations of each substance at which no significant interference as defined

The sponsor performed a lay-user study where accuracy of the device was tested
using 145 fingerstick samples obtained by the lay-user and 145 samples per each
alternative site (the palm and forearm) obtained by the lay-user. Participants, who
were able to read the User’s Manual in English, were instructed to read the manual
and perform testing on the finger and then the alternative sites. A technician
collected capillary blood for measurements on YSI. Results were obtained for each
of the alternative sites. Samples ranged from 51 – 496 mg/dL. Results are

Page 16 of 18
3. Specimen Identificaiton:
Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected. Samples are
identified by time, date, and/or time of meal stamps after measurement.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The Telcare meter is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger,
palm, and forearm. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip
there are no special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
The meter is a non-coding meter, therefore no coding is required by the user.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor recommends two levels of Telcare glucose control solution, Level 1 and
Level 2 with this device. To perform a control test the user is instructed to press the
up/down buttons on the side of the meter to access the control solution modes. The
user presses down buttons (once for Level 1 and twice for Level 2) and presses enter
to select the mode. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test
strip vial label. If the control values fall outside these ranges, the user is referred to
the user manual and customer support for problems and more information.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. The device (Telcare meter) is intended for single-patient use. Disinfection studies were
performed on the meter and lancet device by an outside commercial testing service to
determine the disinfection efficacy of the meter and lancing device to the recommended
cleaning and disinfection protocol, and its effectiveness in preventing the spread of
bloodborne pathogens, particularly hepatitis B virus (HBV). Dispatch Hospital Cleaner
Disinfectant Towels with Bleach disposable wipes (EPA Reg. No: 56392-8) were
validated, demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus for use with the meter and
lancing device. The sponsor also conducted robustness studies and demonstrated that
there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the meter and lancing
device after 1,825 cleaning and disinfection cycles to simulate 5 years of use by lay-
users. Each robustness cycle consisted of one pre-clean wipe and one disinfecting wipe.
2. The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated with 3 lots of test strips using 10
test strips at each of 5 concentration ranges of glucose (30-50, 51-110, 111-150, 250-350,
and 451-550 mg/dL). Analyte samples were prepared from venous blood samples at 5
hematocrit levels at approximately 30, 35, 43, 50, and 55%. In total 750 glucose
measurements were made. Each of the glucose results were compared to the value
obtained from the same plasma glucose concentration obtained by YSI. Bias were
reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor claims a hematocrit range of 30-55%.
3. The effect of altitude was evaluated at five whole blood samples with glucose
concentrations ranging from 50 to 440 mg/dL were tested at sea level and 3,150 meters
16

--- Page 17 ---
Page 17 of 18
(10,335 feet) above sea level. Each blood glucose concentration was measured 20 times.
The bias was calculated relative to YSI at sea level and at 3,150 meters. The results
demonstrate that the system meets the accuracy acceptance criteria for testing at altitudes
up to 3,150 meters with biases within + 10 % for all tested blood glucose concentrations.
4. The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies at the combined extremes of
10.5°C/RH: 18%, 39.8°C/RH: 18%, 10.6°C/RH: 94%, and 39.8°C/RH: 94%, with venous
blood samples (55-440 mg/dL) that demonstrated that their device can be used at
temperatures of 10ºC to 40º C and 20-90% relative humidity.
5. Usability studies were designed to test human factors such as ease of operation of the
Telserve Data Management Software and evaluation of the instructions for use for this
device. The survey group included a near-even representation of 133 male and female
patients with Type I and Type II diabetes, as well as a group of 12 healthcare
professionals. All responses were kept confidential and participants remained anonymous
throughout all surveys. Data were reported in aggregate and no identifying information
was linked back to individual responses.
The human factors that were most applicable to the Telserve Data Management Software
are the user characteristics (individuals with vision problems must be able to understand
the system) and the device-user interface ensuring ease of operation, readability of the
result, and unambiguous messages to the user.
The usability studies evaluated the set-up process, including registering with Telserve,
uploading of blood glucose data, and the display of blood glucose data. These studies
resulted in changes to the user interface to display glucose data in larger font type and to
clearly label glucose readings (i.e. “most recent reading”).
The usability testing and results were factored appropriately into the Risk Analysis. As
problems were identified, software changes were made and documented. The final
version after usability was identified as Version 1.9.
6. Telcare Blood Glucose Meter validation testing was performed to ensure that the glucose
readings displayed in the Telserve Data Management System were identical to those of
the corresponding Telcare meter. Additional tests were conducted by the sponsor to V&V
that the readings in each of the Telcare meters tested were the same reading, date and
time shown on the meter itself and V&V with the Telserve software. The testing proved
that the Telserve software represents exactly the same readings from the meters tested
and they are displayed accurately within the Telserve application.
The software documentation submitted indicates that the Telserve software application
was and is under well developed software lifecycle processes.
7. The sponsor provided a readability study and obtained Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level
Scores of 7.4 for the Telcare Meter User’s Manual, 7.3 for the Telserve Home User’s
17
