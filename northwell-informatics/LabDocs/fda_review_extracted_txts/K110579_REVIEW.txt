L. Test Principle:
The ARCHITECT B12 assay is a two-step assay with an automated sample
pretreatment, for determining the presence of B12 in human serum using
chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology. Sample and Pre-
Treatment Reagent 1, Pre-Treatment Reagent 2, and Pre-Treatment Reagent 3 are
combined. An aliquot of the pre-treated sample is aspirated and transferred into a
new reaction vessel (RV). The pre-treated sample, assay diluent, and intrinsic factor
coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined. B12 present in the sample binds to
the intrinsic factor coated microparticles. After washing, B12 acridinium-labeled
conjugate is added in the second step. Pre-Trigger and Trigger Solutions are then
added to the reaction mixture; the resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as
relative light units (RLUs). An inverse relationship exists between the amount of B12
in the sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT i System optics.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
This study was designed based on the CLSI document EP5-A2. Three control
levels (low, medium, and high) and 1 serum panel were tested.
Testing was performed using 3 lots of reagents, 2 lots of calibrators, and 1 lot
of controls on one ARCHITECT i 2000 instrument. One calibrator lot was
SR
paired with 1 reagent lot and the other calibrator lot was paired with the
remaining 2 reagent lots. The 3 control levels and the serum panel were each
tested in replicates of 3, twice daily (a minimum of 2 hours apart), on each of
20 days, using 3 reagent lots on one ARCHITECT i 2000 instrument, for a
SR
total of 360 replicates. Results are summarized in the table below:

pg/mL) specimen cannot be obtained. Each sample was tested in replicates of
4 using the ARCHITECT B12 assay. Data was analyzed using 1st order, 2nd
order, and 3rd order least square regression according to the CLSI EP6-A
guideline and the results are summarized below:
1st order: y =1.0234x +4.18
2nd order: y =1.1676x – 0.0001x2 -28.79
3rd order: y =1.0196x + 0.0001x2 - 0x3 - 8.01
The 3rd order cubic model was the best fit. The percent deviation (DL) from
linearity was within ± 10% for all samples tested (18 samples ranged from
109 to 2075 pg/mL).
The B12 assay has a measuring range of 146 – 2000 pg/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators: Abbott manufactures B12 internal standards (primary calibrators)
gravimetrically using cyanocobalamin (B12) USP Reference Standard. The
B12 calibrators (market calibrators) are manufactured and tested against these
internal standards.
Primary B12 Calibrator A (0 pg/mL) is prepared with sodium borate, sodium
chloride, water and human serum albumin. The pH of the solution is checked
and adjusted, if necessary. Sodium azide is added, and the solution is diluted
to final batch size with water, mixed, and filtered. The calibrator diluent is
stored at 2 to 8°C.
Preparation of Primary B12 Calibrators B through F: The cyanocobalamin
USP reference standard is gravimetrically diluted with filtered water to create
a concentrated reference solution. The concentrated reference solution is
gravimetrically diluted with calibrator diluent to create a B12 primary stock
solution. Each Primary B12 Calibrator B through F is gravimetrically
prepared with B12 primary stock solution and calibrator diluent to target
concentrations of 100, 250, 500, 1,000, and 2,000 pg/mL, respectively.
Secondary and Market versions of B12 Calibrator A is prepared the same way
as the Primary B12 Calibrator A. Each Secondary and Market version of B12
Calibrator B through F is prepared with ARCHITECT B12 stock solution
(cyanocobalamin diluted in calibrator diluent) and calibrator diluent to target
concentrations of 110 , 200, 500, 1,000, and 2,000 pg/mL, respectively.
Value assignment: The concentrations of each Secondary B12 Calibrator B
through F are determined by comparison of the relative light unit (RLU)
values against the corresponding primary calibrators using the ARCHITECT i
System. The on-test calibrator is compared to the corresponding primary
calibrator using a sample/reference ratio of the grand mean RLU results. The
concentrations are adjusted, if necessary, by adding either ARCHITECT B12
stock solution or calibrator diluent, to be within ± 1% of the primary calibrator
6

--- Page 7 ---
RLU values. Market calibrators are similarly assigned values by comparison
via RLU values to the secondary calibrators.
Controls: Primary and secondary controls are made similarly to calibrators
(above). The B12 primary stock solution is mixed with calibrator diluent to
target concentrations of 200, 400 and 800 pg/mL. The secondary controls are
assigned values via the same process described above for secondary
calibrators. The ARCHITECT B12 Low and High Control are prepared with
ARCHITECT B12 stock solution (cyanocobalamin diluted in calibrator
diluent) and calibrator diluent to target concentrations of 251 and 915 pg/mL.
The ARCHITECT B12 Medium Control is prepared by spiking human serum
containing B12 with ARCHITECT B12 stock solution to a target
concentration of 454 pg/mL. Value assignment for market controls is similar
to that described above for the market calibrators.
Stability: Protocols and acceptance criteria for shelf-life and in-use (open
vial) stability were reviewed and found to be adequate. Currently, real-time
stability data supports 8 months at 2-8˚C for controls and 11 months at 2-8˚C
for calibrators; for in use (open vial) stability; in use (open vial) stability for
calibrators is one month and for controls is two months. Reagents are stable
on board the ARCHITECT i System for 26 days.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limits study and statistical analysis was performed based on the
CLSI document EP17-A. Testing was performed using at least two
ARCHITECT i 2000 instruments and 2 reagent lots. Both reagent lots were
SR
tested on each instrument, along with 1 lot each of ARCHITECT B12
Calibrators and Controls. Four zero-level and 9 low-level samples were
tested. Samples were prepared at the following concentrations: 58, 85, 97,
116, 126, 136, 146, 168, and 200 pg/mL. All samples were tested in 1
replicate for the zero-level samples and a minimum of 3 replicates for the low-
level samples on 5 runs over 3 days for each reagent lot and instrument
combination for a total of at least 60 replicates for each analyte level.
Limit of Blank (LoB) was calculated to be 66 pg/mL. Limit of Detection
(LoD) was calculated to be 88 pg/mL. Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) is the
imprecision where the %CV is less than or equal to 10%. The LoQ was
determined to be 146 pg/mL.
The B12 assay has a measuring range of 146 – 2000 pg/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference: A study was conducted to evaluate the susceptibility of the
ARCHITECT B12 assay to potentially interfering substances: total bilirubin,
hemoglobin, total protein, and triglycerides. The study was performed based
on the CLSI document EP7-A2. One ARCHITECT i 2000 instrument and 1
SR
lot each of ARCHITECT B12 Reagent Kit, Calibrators, and Controls were
used.
7

--- Page 8 ---
A serum specimen pool containing 150 - 250 pg/mL B12 (low sample) and a
serum specimen pool containing > 500 pg/mL B12 (higher sample) were
obtained. The sponsor defines no significant interference if bias is less than
10% between the spiked and unspiked sample. Total bilirubin (conjugated and
unconjugated), total protein, and triglycerides showed no significant
interference in the ARCHITECT B12 assay for low samples (concentration
range: 150 pg/mL to 250 pg/mL) and higher samples (concentration range: >
500 pg/mL) at the following concentrations:
• Bilirubin ≤ 20 mg/dL
• Total Protein ≤ 12 g/dL
• Triglycerides ≤ 3000 mg/dL
At a hemoglobin concentration of approximately 400 mg/dL, the
ARCHITECT B12 assay showed an average interference of –17.5% with low
samples (concentration range: 150 pg/mL to 250 pg/mL) and –12.5% with
higher samples (concentration range: > 500 pg/mL). Therefore, the sponsor
put the following limitation in their package insert.
“Hemolysis has been demonstrated to exhibit negative interference in this
B12 assay. Hemolyzed specimens should not be analyzed.”
Cross reactivity: A study was conducted to evaluate the susceptibility of the
ARCHITECT B12 assay to cross-reactivity with cobinamide. The study was
performed using one ARCHITECT i 2000 instrument and 1 lot each of
SR
ARCHITECT B12 Reagent Kit, Calibrators, and Controls.
A serum specimen pool containing approximately 230 pg/mL B12 was
obtained. A test sample was prepared by adding a 360 ng/mL cobinamide
stock solution to the serum specimen pool, targeting a cobinamide
concentration of ≥ 9,000 pg/mL. A reference sample was prepared by adding a
volume of distilled water, equivalent to the volume of cobinamide stock
solution used in the test sample, to the serum specimen pool.
The test and reference samples were each tested once in replicates of 14 using
the ARCHITECT B12 assay. Analysis of the test vs. reference sample testing
showed 1.8% bias between the test and reference sample. The sponsor
claimed that there is no cross reactivity with cobinamide based on the data.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The study was performed based on the CLSI document EP9-A2. The Roche
Elecsys E170 Vitamin B12 assay was used as the predicate device.
A total of 198 human serum specimens were tested with both the
ARCHITECT B12 and Roche Elecsys Vitamin B12 assays. For the
ARCHITECT B12 assay, 2 lots of reagents, 1 lot each of calibrators and
8

--- Page 9 ---
controls, and 1 ARCHITECT i 2000 instrument were used for testing, with
SR
specimen testing divided over the 2 reagent lots. For the Roche Elecsys
Vitamin B12 assay, 1 lot each of reagents, calibrators, and controls and 1
Roche Elecsys instrument were used for testing. Specimens were tested in
replicates of 2 with each assay over a period of 6 days. A specimen tested
using the ARCHITECT B12 assay was tested within 24 hours using the Roche
Elecsys Vitamin B12 assay. 47 samples were excluded from analysis because
they were outside the claimed range of the assay (24 below the LoQ, 23 above
2000 pg/mL). Results of the study are summarized in the table below.
