Laboratory
L. Test Principle:
The ADVIA Centaur Vitamin D Total assay is a one-pass, 18-minute antibody
competitive immunoassay that uses an anti-fluorescein monoclonal mouse antibody
covalently bound to paramagnetic particles (PMP), an anti-25(OH) vitamin D
monoclonal mouse antibody labeled with acridinium ester (AE), and a vitamin D
analog labeled with fluorescein. An inverse relationship exists between the amount of
vitamin D present in the patient sample and the amount of relative light units (RLUs)
detected by the system.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated according to the CLSI Document EP5-A2, Evaluation
of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods. 2 patient
samples (~12.0 and 18.0 ng/mL) and 4 medical decision pools (~32.0, 50.0,
55.8 and 132.0 ng/mL) were assayed twice a day in replicates of 4 using 3 lots
of reagents on one system for 20 days. These studies were performed by 2
operators. Results are summarized below:

prescreened for Vitamin D levels >200ng/mL and a low concentration sample
containing BSA and cholesterol. The high serum pool sample and the low
sample were combined in different ratios to produce 11 dilutions covering the
assay range. Linearity was evaluated by calculating a linear regression
comparing observed values versus expected values. Results of the percent
recovery of all the samples are summarized below:
Sample Expected concentration Observed concentration % Recovery
1 3.8 3.8 100.0
2 8.5 8.8 103.3
3 13.1 13.8 105.7
4 22.3 23.4 104.7
5 40.8 40.7 99.8
6 59.3 58.8 99.2
7 77.8 73.6 94.6
8 96.3 92.9 96.4
9 114.8 112.1 97.6
10 133.3 134.5 100.9
11 151.8 151.8 100.0
The measured vs. expected linear regression analysis for all samples generated
a linear regression as follows:
y = 1.026x – 3.586, r2 = 0.997
The linear study data supports the sponsor’s claim that the measuring range of
the Vitamin D assay is 4.2 to 150 ng/mL.
Dilution study:
Additional studies were performed to demonstrate that the samples with
concentrations greater than 150mg/dL using a 1:2 dilution can be accurately
measured by the ADVIA Centaur Vitamin D Total assay. These studies were
performed with eight serum samples that were diluted 1:2 with ADVIA
Centaur Vitamin D Total assay diluent. All samples were run in triplicate.
Theoretical doses were calculated by dividing the measured dose for the
undiluted sample by the dilution factor. The percent recoveries were
determined by dividing the observed dose by the theoretical dose. The percent
recovery was from 90% to 110%. Results are summarized below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and value assignment:
Calibrators, 2-level controls (Level 1: 20 ng/mL and Level 2: 100 ng/ml) and
MCMs are traceable to internal standards, which are traceable to LC-MS/MS.
The internal standards were value assigned via method correlation using
clinical samples with LC/MS/MS values. The relationship between the
ADVIA Centaur Vitamin D assay internal standards and liquid
chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectroscopy is described using
linear regression as:
ADVIA Centaur VitD=1.01(LC/MS/MS) + 8.9, r=0.99
Production lots of calibrators, controls and master curve materials (MCM) are
value assigned against the internal standards using two reagent lots, 2 runs on
two different instruments for a total of 24 replicates. The average dose for
each calibrator, control and MCM assigns their value.
Shelf life stability studies: Real-time stability studies were performed for the
control materials, MCM and the calibrators. The stability study protocol and
the acceptance criteria have been reviewed and found to be acceptable. The
real time ongoing stability study supports a stability of 26 weeks (6 months)
when materials are stored at 2-8oC.
Open vial stability: The stability study protocol and the acceptance criteria to
determine open-vial stability of the control materials, MCM, and the
calibrators have been reviewed and found to be acceptable. Calibrators,
MCM, and controls are stable for up to 120 days when stored at -20 oC, 28
days when stored at 2-8oC, and up to 7 days stability when stored at 25 oC.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of the Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of
Quantitation (LoQ) for the ADVIA Centaur Vitamin D Total assay was

determined in accordance with the CLSI guideline EP17-A: Protocols for
Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation.
LoB was performed using 3 blank samples in replicates of 4 were assayed
using 2 reagent lots and 2 instruments, 2 runs per day, over ten operating days
generating 320 measurements. The LoB was determined to be 1.60 ng/mL, by
calculating the 95thpercentile of the distribution of the test values.
LoD was performed using seven samples prepared by diluting a patient
sample with charcoal stripped human serum to concentrations ranging from
1.6 to 12.1 ng/mL. 7 samples in replicates of 4 were assayed using 2 reagent
lots and 2 instruments, 2 runs per day, over ten operating days generating 320
measurements. The LoD was estimated to be 3.3 ng/mL.
LoQ was performed using four low samples. 4 samples were analyzed using 2
reagent lots and 2 instruments, 2 runs per over 10 days generating 320
measurements. LoQ was 4.2 ng/mL when %CV was 18.3 (inter assay
precision n=320).
The measuring range of the ADVIA Centaur Vitamin D Total assay is 4.2 -
150ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference:
The sponsor performed studies to evaluate the effects of endogenous
compounds (such as hemoglobin, cholesterol, uric acid, human IgG,
triglycerides, unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin) on the performance of
the ADVIA Centaur Vitamin D Total assay, following CLSI EP7-A2,
Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline. Testing was
done in the presence of 20 – 106 ng/mL 25(OH) vitamin D and different
concentrations of the listed compounds. All samples were run in triplicate.
Percent recovery was calculated relative to control samples containing vitamin D
without spiked endogenous compounds. The table below lists all substances
tested at concentrations with non-significant (<10%) interference defined by
the sponsor when compared to the control samples:

Triglycerides 540 mg/dL
Uric acid 20 mg/dL
Based on the study data, the sponsor stated in their labeling that hemolyzed
sample should not be tested with the vitamin D assay.
Cross reactivity:
The sponsor performed studies to estimate if compounds similar to 25-
hydroxy Vitamin D (25(OH) D2 and D3) cross react with the ADVIA Centaur
Vitamin D Total assay. These studies were performed in accordance with
CLSI EP7-A2, Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved
Guideline. Specificity of the ADVIA Centaur Vitamin D Total assay was
determined by adding the cross reactants to 2 medical decision serum pools
containing varying amounts of 25(OH) vitamin D, approximately 35.0,
55ng/mL and 115 ng/mL. Each test sample was compared to a matched
unspiked serum pool. The study was carried out using 2 reagent lots and each
sample was run in triplicate. Based on the results summarized in the below
table, the sponsor concluded that the assay did not significantly cross react
with Vitamin D2, Vitamin D3, 1,25-OH Vitamin D2, 1,25-OH vitamin D3, 3-
epi-25-OH vitamin D3 and Paricalcitol (Zemplar). The assay recovers both
25-OH Vitamin D3 and 25-OH vitamin D2.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor performed studies to compare the performance of the ADVIA
Centaur Vitamin D Total assay with the performance of the predicate IDS
assay (k021163). A total of 196 specimens in the range of 6.2 to 150 ng/mL,
were used in this comparison. Results of Deming regression analysis are
summarized below:
x axis y axis n r Slope Intercept
Predicate Advia Centaur 196 0.96 0.98 3.05
b. Matrix comparison:
The sponsor performed studies to compare the performance of the ADVIA

Sample Stability Study:
This study was performed to monitor the stability of serum and plasma
samples for use with the ADVIA Centaur Vitamin D Total Assay.
Specifically, samples ranging from 24.99 ng/mL to 124.10 ng/mL were
examined after being frozen and thawed 3, 6, 9, and 12 times. Based on the
results from this study, the sponsor concluded that the samples subjected to up
to 12 freeze/thaw cycles can be safely used with the ADVIA Centaur Vitamin
D Total Assay.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
To determine a reference range for the ADVIA Centaur Vitamin D Total assay,
samples obtained from 542 apparently healthy adults from the North and South of
the U.S. were examined. These samples were collected during different weather
seasons (summer and winter). The samples numbers were split evenly between
the North and South, summer and winter, and with and without supplements
containing vitamin D. 258 adults took supplement containing vitamin D and 284
adults took supplement containing vitamin D. Approximately 100 samples per
group were collected. Samples were only included in this study if the samples had
normal PTH, TSH, calcium, magnesium and phosphorus values. Two ranges
based on the 95% confidence intervals were determined following CLSI C28-A2.
The samples were run in singleton on the ADVIA Centaur Vitamin D Total assay.
The following results were obtained:
Expected Ranges for adults: (n = 542)
Observed values
Median 25 (OH) vitamin D 21.1 ng/mL (52.8 nmol/L)
Observed Range 2.5th to 10.6 – 43.4 ng/mL (26.5 – 108.5
97.5th percentile nmol/L)
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
