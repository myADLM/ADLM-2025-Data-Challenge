K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None were referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The CONTOUR®Link Wireless blood glucose test is based on measurement of
electrical current caused by the reaction of glucose with the reagents on the electrode
of the strip. The blood sample is drawn into the tip of the test strip through capillary
action. Glucose in the sample reacts with FAD glucose dehydrogenase (FAD-GDH)
and potassium ferricyanide. Electrons are generated, producing a current that is
proportional to the glucose in the sample. After the reaction time, the glucose
concentration in the sample is displayed on the meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
The current device differs from the predicate in the addition of the radio
frequency transmitter to the existing Contour blood glucose monitoring device.
The modification does not affect the analytical function of the meter and the
current device uses the same test strips and control solutions as cleared in the
predicate device in k062058.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run precision was evaluated using venous blood samples at five
glucose concentration ranges: 30 – 50, 51 – 110, 111 – 150, 151 – 250 and
251 – 400 mg/dL. Three lot of test strips were tested on 10 meters with 10
replicates per meter (N=100/lot). Results are summarized below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: Traceable to NIST SRM 91, dry D-glucose.
Controls: The controls were cleared under k062058.
Stability: The controls and test strips were cleared under k062058. Stability
data was presented and reviewed in k062058.
d. Detection limit:
See linearity section 1. b. above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference
As established in predicate k062058. The predicate data was re-evaluated and
found to be acceptable.
Additional interference testing was performed on multiple levels (3) of
maltose, galactose, xylose, bilirubin, acetaminophen, uric acid and ascorbic
acid meeting and exceeding the maximum concentration of the substance
expected to be encountered in clinical practice.
The results validate the strip labeling statements:
Strip Labeling Statements:
Ø Reducing substances occurring in the blood naturally (uric acid,
acetaminophen) will not significantly affect results.
Ø Interference might occur when the values of the limiting
concentrations of these compounds are greater than those listed below:
Bilirubin >20 mg/dL
Uric Acid >18 mg/dL
Ascorbic Acid >30 mg/dL
Acetaminophen >22 mg/dL
Maltose >200 mg/dL
Galactose >200 mg/dL
Ø Xylose: Do not use during or soon after xylose absorption testing.
Xylose in the blood will cause interference.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with reference method (Contour Link Wireless versus
YSI):
Fingerstick and plasma samples from 100 diabetic subjects were included in
the study. In order to fill the bins at the low and high end of the distribution,
19 samples were either glycolyzed to a lower concentration or supplemented
with glucose to increase the concentration. 4 measurements were obtained for
each sample using two reagent lot and two CONTOUR Link Wireless meters.
Plasma samples were also tested in parallel on an YSI 2300 STAT PLUS
glucose analyzer, and the result was used as the comparison value. All
measurements were performed at 23oC ± 5oC.
The distribution of the sample glucose concentrations is specified in the table
below.

--- Page 10 ---
6. Quality Control:
Glucose control solutions at three different concentrations can be used with this
device. The meter automatically distinguishes control solution from blood and
marks control solution tests with a check mark and excludes them from average
calculations. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided
in the labeling. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the control
solutions vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result
falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the results showed that
the labeling (User Guide, test strip package insert and control solution package
insert) were written at the 8th grade level.
2. Customer service is available 24/7, 365 days a year. Toll free phone number is 1-
800-348-8100 for Bayer Diabetes Care customer support.
3. Temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated for temperatures
ranging from 41oF-113oF (5oC to 45oC) and relative humidity from 10% to 93%.
Protocol and acceptance criteria were provided and found to be acceptable. The
results supported the Sponsor’s claimed operating temperature from 41oF-113oF
and relative humidity range from 10% to 93%.
4. EMC testing was performed on the CONTOUR® Link Wireless Blood Glucose
Meter by an accredited EMC Testing Laboratory LS Research, LLC. A letter of
attestation was issued to Bayer on October 12, 2007.
5. The sponsor claims that the current device can be used at altitudes up to 11,000 feet
based on the study performed on the predicate meter cleared in k062058.
6. The sponsor performed hematocrit studies on five Contour® Link Wireless meters
using 6 different hematocrit levels (15, 20, 25, 30, 42, 55 and 65%) across 5
glucose concentrations (40, 80, 120, 350, 500 mg/dL). At each hematocrit level,
samples at various glucose concentrations were tested against the YSI method.
The bias of all test results were less than 10 mg/dL (at glucose <100 mg/dL) or less
than 10% (at glucose ≥100 mg/dL) compared to YSI method, therefore the sponsor
claims that hematocrit between 20% to 65% does not significantly affect the glucose
results.
7. Disinfection and Robustness studies:
The device is intended for single-patient use only. Clorox® Germicidal Wipes
containing 0.55% sodium hypochlorite with EPA registration # 67619-12 was
validated demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus using materials used
in the meter and lancing device. The sponsor also demonstrated that there
10

--- Page 11 ---
was no change in performance or in the external materials of the meter and
lancing device after 260 cleaning and disinfection cycles designed to simulate
cleaning and disinfection 1x per week for 5 years. Labeling was reviewed for
adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
8. The software changes related to the modified functions (Bluetooth data
transmission and memory storage of up to 1000 tests) were tested and the
intended functions were validated.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
