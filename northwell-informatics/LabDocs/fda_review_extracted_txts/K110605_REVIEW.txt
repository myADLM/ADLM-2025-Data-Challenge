H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Clinical Innovations ROM Plus fetal membrane rupture test is a rapid,
qualitative immunochromatographic test for the in vitro detection of amniotic
fluid in vaginal secretions of pregnant women with signs and symptoms of ROM.
The test detects AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) and PP12 (placental protein 12 or insulin
growth factor binding protein) from amniotic fluid in vaginal secretion. The test is
for prescription use by health care professionals toaid in the detection of rupture
of membranes (ROM) in pregnant women in conjunction with other signs and
symptoms.
The ROM Plus Quality Control Kit monitors the performance of the ROM Plus
Fetal Membranes Rupture Test for the purposes of external quality control. The
lyophilized human positive protein control is an assayed control material for
qualitative testing.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The package insert contains the following warning:
The test may report positive results in patients with intact membranes (see
specificity in the performance section) and therefore decisions to induce
labor should not be based solely on the ROM Plus test results.
4. Special instrument requirements:
No instrument required; this is a visually-read test.
I. Device Description:
Each individual test pack contains a sterile polyester swab, specimen extraction buffer
solution in a plastic vial and a cassette with integral timer containing the lateral flow
strip packed in a foil pouch with desiccant.
TheROM Plus Controls contain one vial each of negative, and positive controls, and
reconstitution solution.

3. Comparison with predicate:
Both devices are qualitative, lateral flow immunochromatographic assays
intended to aid in detecting rupture of fetal membranes in pregnant women. The
specimen collection and extraction, test procedure, and reading and interpretation of

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None were referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The ROM Plus test uses a combination of antibodies to the PP12 and AFP proteins,
includingmonoclonal mouse anti-human (anti-AFP and PP-12) and polyclonal sheep
anti-PP-12 and goat anti-AFP. Patient vaginal secretion sample is collected and
extracted using the extraction buffer. The sample is collected by placing the swab on
the vaginal mucosal lining for 15 seconds. The swab is then mixed into a vial
containing 400 μL of buffer solution, and the diluted sample is applied to the sample
pad of the test strip via the sample well on the cassette. The liquid moves
chromatographically and unidirectionally towards the absorbent pad. During
migration, the sample reacts with the antibodies bound to the test strip membrane In
addition, as the membrane absorbs the liquid sample, a control line will appear,
indicating a sample was applied. If the sample contains the PP12 and/or AFP above
the detection limit, it binds to the antibody of the test line, causing the test line to
appear and indicating a positive result. If the sample does not contain the PP12 and/or
AFP above the detection limit, only the control line will be visible, indicating a
negative result.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
See Sensitivity section below for reproducibility evaluations near the LoD.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The test was evaluated for hook effect up to PP12 of400ug/mL, and AFP of
200ug/mL. These high concentrations still showed positive results.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The device is traceable to an ELISA method that uses purified PP-12 and AFP
as standards.
Stability:
The methods for stability testing was reviewed and found to be adequate to
support the claims for control material storage and dating.
Control materials:
4

--- Page 5 ---
Control materials are prepared from amniotic fluid. Concentrations are
determinedbased on an ELISA method and contain 20 ng/mL PP12 and 600
ng/mL AFP. Each control kit contains: One Positive Control Vial (self-
contained glass ampoule of buffer) and One Negative Control Vial (self-
contained glass ampoule of buffer).
d. Detection limit:
Samples were prepared from purified AFP and PP-12 in a matrix with the
same salinity, pH, and a total protein concentration designed to be similar to
amniotic fluid. Protein concentrations determined were based on protein
analytical methods.
Testing was performed at external sites. Each protein separately and a
combinedmixture (AFP and PP12 together) were evaluated at five
concentrations near (above and below) the cutoff.
Testing at concentrations near C50, was carried out using 3 lots, under two
lighting conditions (fluorescent light and light from window), by three
operators.All sample concentrations were masked. A summary of results is
shown below:

Using analyses recommended in CLSI EP12 the following results were
determined:
2.5ng/mL< C50 < 5ng/mL for PP-12.
75ng/mL <C50 <150 ng/mL for AFP.
Allresults were positive for concentrations 5 ng/mL and above; and all results
were negative for concentrations of 2.5 ng/mL and below for PP-12. All
results were positive for concentrations of 150 ng/mL and above; and all
results, except for one operator reading one sample were negative for
concentrations of 75 ng/mL and below for AFP.
e. Analytical specificity:
Blood, urineand semen were spiked into a low positive sample and the
negative control at a high level (10% of sample volume) and run in the ROM
Plus test. There was no effect on either the positive control or the negative
control. In addition, common potentially interfering substances including
aspirin, Tylenol, Pert shampoo, Noxzema skin moisturizer and Lever bath
soap were spiked into both the low positive and negative control at a final
concentration of 0.1% with no effect observed. Higher levels of blood or
urine may interfere.
Samples from subjects with vaginal infections were tested using the ROM
Plus tests. Infections tested were Bacterial Vaginosis (Candidiasis,
Trichomoniasis, Gardnerella), STS infections (Chlamydia, syphilis,
Gonorrhea and Herpes and HIV). All gave non-positive results. The sponsor
concluded that samples with vaginal infections did not produce positive
results.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cutoff concentration for PP-12 is set at 5 ng/mL, and the cutoff
concentration for AFP is set at 150 ng/mL.

Study Design:
Prospective clinical studies were performed at 3 US sites.
Inclusion Criteria were healthy pregnant women with signs or symptoms of
rupture of membranes. Exclusion Criteria were known placental previa or
active vaginal bleeding
Women in the study were evaluated by sterile speculum exam. Afterward, a
second examiner (nurse or physician) who did not know the results of the
conventional diagnosis read the results of the ROM Plus test. The test was
compared to visual leaking from cervical os, or (if this leaking was not
observed)pooling of amniotic fluid in the posterior fornix, nitrazine testing,
and ferning. Visual leaking or two out of three positive results for, the ferning,
pooling and nitrazine tests were considered positive. Results are shown below
for the three study sites combined:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor includes the following in the expected range section in the package
insert: IGFBP-1 concentration in amniotic fluid as determined in literature
studies in amniotic fluid is between 10,500 and 350,000 ng/ml and for AFP from
2,800 to 26,000 ng/ml and in serum from 55 to 242 U/ml (equivalent to 33 to 290
ng/ml). Concentrations of IGFBP-12 (PP12) in amniotic fluid observed PP12 to
be 100 to 1000 times higher than that in maternal serum. These studies also
showed that concentrations of these proteins in urine to be negligible.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies therequirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
