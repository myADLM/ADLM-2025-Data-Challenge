c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and value assignment
CalCheck 5 is standardized using internally produced master calibrators which are
traceable to the 3rd IRP WHO 84/500 international standard.
Each of the five CalCheck levels is value assigned using a minimum of three cobas e
601. Each sample is tested in duplicate. The target value for each CalCheck is the
median of the observed values.
The sponsor experimentally confirmed the values assigned were transferrable to
Elecsys 2010/cobas e 411analyzers. For Elecsys 2010/cobas e 411analyzers, the same
value assignment procedure was performed. The assigned values obtained on these
additional analyzers were shown to meet the same acceptance criteria as the E170/e
601/e 602. Additionally, the acceptance criteria for differences between the master
platform and additional analyzer platforms (e) were also met. Therefore, the values
assigned to the cobas e 601analyzer/s are transferred and valid for the Elecsys 2010
analyzer/s.
The labeling states that laboratories should establish appropriate acceptance criteria
when using this product for its intended use.
Stability
Real time and accelerated stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were
described and found to be adequate. CalCheck 5 is stable until the expiration date printed
on the vial when stored unopened at 2 – 8° C. The reconstituted vials are stable for four
hours at 20-25°C. The real time studies are ongoing.
