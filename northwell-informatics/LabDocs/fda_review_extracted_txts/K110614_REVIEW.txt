510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
k110614
B. Purpose for Submission:
New device
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
SEJU Engineering Co., Ltd.
PAD – Personal Alcohol Detector
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Quantitative - semiconductor oxide sensor
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The front of the unit consists of the inhaler area, LCD display, a power button,
and a scale button. The blood alcohol equivalent concentration (BAC) is reported
in percent to two decimal places on the LCD display. On the back side of the unit
is the battery compartment which houses two AAA batteries.
To use the unit, users are instructed to press the power button. The device
performs a self-check while counting down from 100 and displaying WAIT.
When BLOW is displayed the unit is ready for a measurement. Users are
instructed to inhale deeply and then blow steadily into the inhaler area for 3 - 4
seconds. The user can then read the blood alcohol equivalent concentration in %
BAC.
2. Principle of Operation:
The semiconductor gas sensor used (tin dioxide) has n-type conductivity when
exposed to the atmosphere. This exposure causes a decrease in the number of
electrons affecting absorbed oxygen molecules and thus increases resistance. If a
reducing gas is presented, a reaction occurs with the absorbed oxygen which
causes an increase in the electrons in the oxide molecules causing a decrease in
resistance. This change in resistance can be measured and used to identify a
1

specific gas (such as alcohol) and can be quantified into a % concentration. Breath
Alcohol Concentration (BrAC) is calculated first, and then converted to an
equivalent Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC).
3. Modes of Operation:
This device has only one mode of operation.
4. Specimen Identification:
There is no mechanism to identify the specimen.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The user provides a breath sample by exhaling into the device.
6. Calibration:
The device is calibrated at the factory and sent directly to the end user. The
sponsor recommends a recalibration interval of every 200 tests or every six
months. These intervals are based on calibration stability data collected internally.
The unit must be sent back to the factory for calibration.
Traceability:
This device is traceable to a commercially available certified ethyl alcohol
reference solution.
7. Quality Control:
There are no external quality controls available for these types of devices for
over-the-counter use.

J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy:
The sponsor performed a consumer study to determine if consumers could
correctly use and interpret the device using only the supplied user manual, and
to compare the results to the predicate. There were 128 paired comparisons,
and the volunteers ranged in age from 21 to 60 years of age. Each participant
took their breath alcohol reading with the PAD Breath Alcohol Test system
and recorded the result. Immediately afterward, the participants were
administered a breath alcohol test using the predicate device operated by a
trained individual. The breath alcohol concentrations ranged from a BAC of
0.000 % to 0.20% (by the predicate device). Linear regression analysis of the
data produced a slope of 0.963, a y-intercept of 0.003 and a correlation
coefficient (r) of 0.993. After the study, participants were asked to respond to
statements about ease of use and interpretation of the device. Results are
summarized as follows:

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision and accuracy of this device was evaluated at an independent
testing lab. The testing lab performed the testing following the protocol of the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Requirements of
this protocol (referred to as Model Specifications) consist of 20 trials at a
Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) of 0.008, 20 trials at a BAC of 0.032,
and 20 trials at a BAC of 0.000. Blood Alcohol Concentrations are simulated
in breath by a Breath Alcohol Sample Simulator (BASS), which provides an
alcohol-in-air test sample with known alcohol concentrations, flow rate, and
air composition. The acceptance criteria for the Model Specifications are: not
more than one negative result at 0.032 BAC, not more than one positive result
at 0.008 BAC, and not more than one negative greater than zero and no
positives at 0.000 BAC. NOTE: for the purposes of this study, a BAC of 0.020
is used to distinguish a positive from a negative result.
The PAD – Personal Alcohol Detector met all of the applicable NHTSA

requirements for precision and accuracy.
c. Linearity:
This device will report concentrations from 0.00 to 0.20% BAC. However, the
DOT Model Specifications require accuracy and precision testing up to a
concentration of 0.032 only; therefore, true linearity over the entire measuring
range of the device was not evaluated by DOT. This device met all of the
applicable NHTSA requirements for precision and accuracy as described
above.
d. Carryover:
Carryover studies are not required by NHTSA and were not performed using
this device.
e. Interfering Substances:
The DOT Model Specifications require testing with cigarette smoke to assess
any possible interference. Five trials are required at 0.000 BAC. An alcohol
free individual who smokes cigarettes is appropriate for this trial. The subject
is asked to smoke approximately one half of a cigarette. Within one minute
after smoking, or after a waiting period specified in the manufacturer’s
instructions*, the subject performs the breath alcohol test according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The subject is then asked to smoke another
inhalation and repeat the test to produce a total of five trials. The acceptance
criterion for this trial is: no positive results. The PAD – Personal Alcohol
Detector device had no positive results.
*The sponsor’s labeling recommends the user wait 25 minutes after
consuming alcohol, smoking, or eating to test a breath sample.
2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
a. Limit of Detection
The DOT Model Specifications do not specifically address the detection limit
of breath alcohol devices. However, the devices must be tested at a BAC of
zero (blank reading) to assess the possibility of false positives. This consists
of 20 trials under normal laboratory conditions at a BAC of 0.000. Non-
alcoholic human breath is to be used as the sample. For devices capable of
providing a reading of greater than 0.000 BAC and less than 0.020 BAC, the
acceptance criterion is: not more than one such result. The PAD – Personal
Alcohol Detector had no false positives in this trial.
b. Temperature
6

--- Page 7 ---
The DOT Model Specifications require testing 10 and 40o C to assess any
possible effects of temperature. At 10o C, 20 trials are required at 0.008 BAC
and 20 trials are required at 0.032 BAC. Acceptance criteria are: not more
than one positive result at 0.008 BAC, and not more than one non-positive
result at 0.032 BAC. The PAD – Personal Alcohol Detector had no positive
results at 0.008 BAC and no non-positive results at 0.032 BAC. At 40o C, the
requirements are identical. The PAD – Personal Alcohol Detector had no
positive results at 0.008 BAC and no non-positive results at 0.032 BAC.
c. Vibration
The DOT Model Specifications require vibration testing to assess any possible
vibrational effects. Twenty trials are required at 0.008 BAC and 0.032 BAC.
Acceptance criteria are: not more than one positive result at 0.008 BAC, and
not more than one non-positive result at 0.032 BAC. The PAD – Personal
Alcohol Detector had no positive results at 0.008 BAC and no non-positive
results at 0.032 BAC.
d. Cutoff
For the purposes of performance testing, a BAC cutoff of 0.020 was used to
distinguish positive from negative samples.
K. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
L. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
