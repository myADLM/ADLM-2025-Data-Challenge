L. Test Principle:
The ARCHITECT 25-OH Vitamin D assay is a delayed one-step immunoassay
including a sample pre-treatment for the quantitative determination of vitamin D
in human serum and plasma using CMIA technology with flexible assay
protocols, referred to as Chemiflex. Sample and pre-treatment reagents are
combined. An aliquot of the pre‑treated sample is combined with assay diluent
and paramagnetic anti‑vitamin D coated microparticles to create a reaction
mixture. Vitamin D present in the sample binds to anti-vitamin D coated
microparticles. After incubation a biotinylated vitamin D anti-Biotin acridinium-
labeled conjugate complex is added to the reaction mixture and binds to
unoccupied binding sites of the anti-vitamin D coated microparticles. After
washing, pre-trigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The
resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs).
An indirect relationship exists between the amount of vitamin D in the sample and
the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT i System optics.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Performance shown below was evaluated on the Architect i2000SR.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A study was performed with the ARCHITECT 25-OH Vitamin D assay based
on the CLSI Protocol EP5-A2. Six samples consisting of 3 ARCHITECT 25-
OH Vitamin D Controls and 3 serum based samples (Low, medium and high
25-OH vitamin D concentration) were assayed, using two lots of reagents, on
one i 2000SR, in replicates of two at two separate times per day for 20 days.
In addition 2 serum based samples (Ultra low and ultra high vitamin D
concentration) were assayed, using one lot of reagents, on one i 2000SR, in

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was determined using serum samples. by mixing a spiked high
concentration of 125.9 ng/mL and a low of 8.3 ng/mL 25-OH vitamin D
concentration in different ratios to create multiple levels of concentrations.
The created high/low dilutions were tested in replicates of four. Both samples
were pre-screened for Vitamin D binding protein and the high and low 25-OH
vitamin D concentrations exhibited a difference in Vitamin D binding protein
of 6%. The table below shows results in terms of deviation from linearity,

Based on the results obtained the linear range is 13 to 96 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
Control materials:
Target ranges for control materials are: Low: 20.0 ng/mL (14.0 - 26.0
ng/mL); medium 40.0 ng/mL (28.0 - 52.0 ng/mL); high 75.0 ng/mL (52.5 -
97.0 ng/mL). The package insert states: Each laboratory should establish its
own concentration ranges for new control lots at each control level. This can
be accomplished by assaying a minimum of 20 replicates over several (3-5)
days. Sources of variation that can be expected should be included in this
study in order to be representative of future system performance.
Assay traceability and value assignment:
The ARCHITECT 25-OH Vitamin D is traceable to a manufacturer’s internal
standard (Primary Calibrator), which is anchored against Absorbance at 264
nm. Target concentrations are: Calibrator A: 0.0 ng/mL; Calibrator B: 4.0
ng/mL; Calibrator C: 10.0 ng/mL; Calibrator D: 30.0 ng/mL; Calibrator E:
75.0 ng/mL; Calibrator F: 160.0 ng/mL. The estimated uncertainty in
assigned calibrator values is shown in terms of levels below:
Conc. Level Conc. Range with 95%
(ng/mL) CI (ng/mL)
20 ±1.25
40 ±1.10
75 ±2.12
Stability of calibrators and controls:
Studies to support the claimed stability for opened and closed vials includes
testing of calibrator held at the recommended 2-8 degrees C, relative to
calibrator held at -70 degrees C. Criteria and results were reviewed and found
to be adequate.
d. Detection limit:
A study was conducted to verify the limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection
(LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) for the ARCHITECT 25-OH Vitamin

D assay.
Limit of Blank: Four different lots of Calibrator A (free of 25-OH Vitamin D)
were tested in 4 replicates during 5 days (n = 80 data points in total). The
observed value for the Limit of Blank for the ARCHITECT 25-OH Vitamin D
assay is 1.9 ng/mL on the i 2000SR platform. (This was based on the highest
value obtained within the two lots of reagents).
Limit of Detection: For each reagent lot / instrument combination, 4 different
serum samples with low 25-OH Vitamin D concentrations (at the approximate
target concentration of 4 ng/mL) were tested in 12 replicates during 5 days
(n=60 per sample). The Limit of Detection determined for the ARCHITECT
25-OH Vitamin D assay is 3.6 ng/mL on the i 2000SR platform. (This was
based on the highest value obtained within the two lots of reagents).
Performance at lower limit of reportable range: For each reagent lot /
instrument combination, 4 different serum samples with low 25-OH Vitamin D
concentrations targeted to 6.6, 7.1, 7.3 and 9.5 ng/mL were tested in 12
replicates during 5 days (n=60 per sample). At a concentration below 13
ng/mL (which is the lower limit based on linearity), CV was within 10%. In
addition, deviations from linearity at 13 ng/mL are within 10% (see linearity
section, above).
The assay has a measuring range of 13 to 96 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity testing was performed on one ARCHITECT i 2000SR using
two lots of reagents for spiked cross-reactants and on one ARCHITECT i
2000SR using one lot of reagents for the endogenous (non-spiked) serum
samples to determine 25-OH vitamin D2 % cross-reactivity. Results are
shown below:
25-OH Vitamin D3 (100 ng/mL) 102%
Vitamin-D2 (Ergocalciferol) (1000 ng/mL) 0%

b Matrix comparison:
Five plasma tube types and two serum tube types (without additives and
SST) were collected from 39 individuals 4 of which were spiked to obtain
the needed concentrations to span the assay range. These fresh (less than
24 hours from the time of draw) blood specimens with endogenous 25-OH
vitamin D concentration sourced from a commercial source were analyzed
with one lot of ARCHITECT 25-OH Vitamin D reagent on the
ARCHITECT i System (i 2000SR).
Human serum and plasma specimens were collected in the following tube
types:
- serum no additive (glass)
- serum separator tube (SST)
- potassium EDTA plasma
- sodium-citrate plasma
- lithium heparin plasma powder
- lithium heparin plasma gel
- sodium heparin plasma
The difference in mean concentration (ng/mL) between each evaluation
tube type and the control tube was calculated using the following formula:
difference (mean concentration of the evaluation tube type – mean
concentration of control tube type (serum without additives)) Sample
concentrations ranged from near 20 to near 70 ng/mL.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
A study was conducted to establish a Reference Interval.
It is also recommended that each laboratory establish its own reference
range, which may be unique to the population it serves depending upon
geographical season, patient, dietary, or environmental factors.
The study was conducted based on guidance from the Clinical Laboratory
and Standard Institute (CLSI), Protocol C28-A3. Two hundred serum
specimens of apparently healthy individuals from the US (North, Central
and South states), collected during summertime (June to July 2011) were
evaluated (in replicates of one) using the ARCHITECT 25-OH Vitamin D
assay. A medical questionnaire was used to select the reference sample
group based on the following exclusion criteria: no family history of
parathyroid or calcium regulatory disease, no personal history of disease
of kidney, gastrointestinal, liver, thyroid or parathyroid, no history of
seizures or bariatric surgery, individuals with Vitamin D supplementation
of ≥2,000 IU/day, individuals currently prescribed any medications that
include cholesterol absorption inhibitors, anticonvulsants, glucocorticoids,
AIDS antiretroviral drugs and anti-rejection drugs. Individuals with results
outside of the expected values for serum calcium (2.15 –2.50 mmol/L for
individuals < 60 years and 2.20 – 2.55 mmol/L for individuals >60 years),
TSH (0.35 – 4.94 μIU/mL), and intact PTH (15.0 – 68.3 pg/mL) were
excluded. After applying the exclusion criteria the following groups were
included in the calculation:

The package insert also notes: “representative data; results in individual
laboratories and in different geographical areas may vary from these data. There
is currently debate over the recommended target range of vitamin D in serum, but
the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline recently suggested a target level
of at least 30 ng/mL.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports
a substantial equivalence decision.
