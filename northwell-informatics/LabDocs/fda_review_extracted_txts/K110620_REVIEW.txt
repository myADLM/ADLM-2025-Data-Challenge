I. Device Description:
Premier™ C. difficile GDH is a qualitative enzyme immunoassay screening test to detect
Clostridium difficile antigen, glutamate dehydrogenase, in fecal specimens from
symptomatic persons suspected of having C. difficile infection (CDI). Breakaway microwells
are coated with polyclonal rabbit anti-GDH antibodies. Diluted patient specimen and a
horseradish peroxidase conjugated (HRP) anti-GDH antibody are added to the microwells
and incubated to allow any antigen in the patient sample to bind the antibody conjugate and
immobilized microwell antibody. Upon completion of the incubation, a wash step is
performed to remove unbound material. If
C. difficile GDH is present, an antibody-enzyme complex is formed. A chromogenic
substrate is added to the microwells and incubated. A blue color develops in the presence of
bound enzyme. Stop solution is added, changing the initial blue reaction to yellow. Test
results are interpreted spectrophotometrically.

Premier C. difficile GDH is based on the well-established, widely used microplate enzyme
immunoassay platform. The predicate device, TECHLAB C. DIFF CHEK-60, is also built on
this platform.
Premier C. difficile GDH Positive Control: Non-toxigenic C. difficile strain 11186 is grown
in liquid media, harvested, and filtered to remove organisms. Bulk manufacture of Positive
Control includes dilution of C. difficile GDH antigen in a buffered protein solution
containing Gentamicin and ProClinTM as preservatives.
Rabbit polyclonal anti-C. difficile Common Antigen antibody is used in the manufacture of
Premier C. difficile GDH Enzyme Conjugate and Premier C. difficile GDH Microwells. The
antibody is specific for C. difficile Common Antigen (GDH) and is internally manufactured
at Meridian Bioscience. The antibody is purified using Protein-A, and is qualified for use by
Meridian using internally qualified enzyme immunoassay (EIA) methods.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Reproducibility:
Reproducibility studies were performed by three clinical laboratories using blind
coded
panels. Samples were randomly sorted within each panel to mask identities. Each
panel consisted of three contrived moderately positive specimens, three contrived
low-positive specimens, three contrived high-negative specimens, and one natural
negative specimen. The moderately-positive, low-positive, and high-negative
samples were prepared from negative stool spiked with C. difficile GDH antigen.
Panels were tested at three independent laboratories by two operators at each
laboratory, twice each day over 5 non-consecutive days. Results were read at single
(OD ) and dual (OD ) wavelengths. The expected results were obtained with
450 450/630
all samples by all technologists at all test sites at each time interval. Reproducibility
of the assay is 100% for moderate positives, low-positives, high-negatives, and
weak negatives.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
No calibrators are supplied or used with this assay.

--- Page 7 ---
External Controls:
Two External Control reagents are included with the Premier C. difficile GDH assay.
External Controls aid the user in detection of reagent deterioration, adverse
environmental or test conditions, washing failures, or variance in operator
performance that can cause test errors. External Controls are required for routine
Quality Control and should be included with each test run.
Positive Control:
C. difficile GDH antigen is in a buffered protein solution containing 0.1% ProClin®
and
0.03% gentamicin as preservatives. Non-toxigenic C. difficile 11186 is grown in
liquid media, harvested, and filtered to remove organisms. Bulk manufacture of
Positive Control includes dilution of C. difficile antigen in a buffered protein solution
containing Gentamicin and ProClin® as preservatives. Negative Control:
Buffered protein solution containing 0.1% ProClin® and 0.03% Gentamicin as
preservatives.
Storage Conditions:
A Sample Storage study was designed to verify the adequacy of the sample age,
preservation, handling, and storage criteria included in the Premier C. difficile GDH
package insert. Aliquots of unpreserved contrived positive and negative samples were
stored at the following temperatures to determine the worst case storage time for each
temperature range: room (19-30 C), refrigerated (2-8 C), conventional freezer (-16 to
-28 C), and ultralow freezer (-66 to -84 C). A total of 10 samples were tested, with the
Limit of Detect (LoD), Low Positive (LP), and High Negative (HN) samples
consisting of manufactured specimens. Results suggest that the Control reagents
should optimally be stored at 2-8 C when not in use.
Stability:
Dating is provisionally set with data derived from accelerated stability studies.
Results are confirmed with real-time shelf-life studies. Accelerated Stability
performed with three lots of Positive and Negative Controls has verified the stability
for at least 18 months under normal conditions of use and storage. Real-time studies
are ongoing.
Expected Values:
Expected Values for OD
450 :
Positive Control: ≥ 0.600
Negative Control: <0.150
Expected Values for OD :
450/630
Positive Control: ≥ 0.600
7

--- Page 8 ---
Negative Control: < 0.100
Validation:
The performance of the Positive and Negative Controls was validated as part of
clinical trials.
d. Detection limit:
In order to determine the analytical limit of detection (LoD) of C. difficile GDH
antigen diluted in a human stool matrix, purified GDH antigen was spiked into
negative stool matrix and diluted serially two-fold. A minimum of 45 replicates of
each concentration were tested to determine the concentration that represents the
Limit of Blank, or the dilution that produces approximately 50% positive and 50%
negative results. The next higher two-fold concentration from the Limit of Blank that
produced a minimum of 95% positive results was determined to be the Limit of
Detection. The next lower two-fold concentration from the Limit of Blank that
produced a minimum of 95% negative results was determined to be the High
Negative value.
Results: Limit of Blank = 4 ng/mL
Limit of Detection = 8 ng/mL
High Negative = 2 ng/mL
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference Studies:
Selected drugs and other non-microbial substances that might be present in stool
samples from healthy persons or patients suspected of having C. difficile associated
disease were added to three negative stool samples and three positive stool samples.
The contrived positive specimens were prepared from a pool of donor stools that were
confirmed as negative. The samples were inoculated with C. difficile strain 11186 at 8
ng/mL, which is the limit of detection for this assay. Potentially interfering substances
were added at final concentrations of 5% V/V or greater. Dilution Controls for each
sample were prepared by adding a phosphate-buffered saline solution in place of the
potentially interfering substance. Each sample was tested in triplicate.
The following substances, at the specified saturated solvent/diluent concentrations, do
not interfere with Premier C. difficile GDH test results in the final concentrations
listed: Barium sulfate (5 mg/mL), Fecal fat (2.65 mg stearic acid and 1.3 mg palmitic
acid/mL), Hemoglobin (3.2 mg/mL), Imodium AD® (Loperamide HCl) (6.67 x 10-3
mg/mL), Kaopectate® (Bismuth subsalicylate) (0.87 mg/mL), Metronidazole (12.5
mg/mL), Mucin (3.33 mg/mL), Mylanta® (Aluminum hydroxide w/ magnesium
hydroxide) (4.2 mg/mL), Pepto-Bismol® (Bismuth subsalicylate) (0.87 mg/mL),
Polyethylene glycol (79.05 mg/mL), Prilosec® (Omeprazole) (0.5 mg/mL),
Simethicone (0.625 mg/mL), Tagamet® (Cimetidine) (0.5 mg/mL), Tums® (Calcium

blood cells (5%).
Cross-reactivity Studies:
Potentially cross-reactive microorganisms that might be present in stool samples from
healthy persons or patients suspected of having C. difficile associated disease were
added to a natural negative and contrived positive sample. The contrived positive
specimens were prepared from a pool of donor stools that was confirmed negative.
The contrived positive sample was prepared by spiking a confirmed negative sample
with C. difficile strain 11186 at 8 ng/mL, which is the limit of detection for this assay.
Potentially cross-reactive microorganisms were added at final concentrations of 1.2 x
108 CFU/mL (bacteria or fungi) or final concentrations greater than 1 x 105
TCID /mL (viruses). Dilution controls for each sample were prepared by adding a
50
0.85% saline solution in place of the potentially cross-reactive organisms.
The following microorganisms, at the indicated concentrations, do not interfere with
Premier C. difficile GDH test results: Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus,
Bacillus subtilis, Bacteroides fragilis, Campylobacter coli, Campylobacter fetus,
