b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity study was designed following CLSI EP6-A guideline. Nine
human venous whole blood samples were drawn and spiked to target analyte
levels. Eight target levels were prepared with glucose stock solutions to
glucose concentrations ranging from 20 to 600 mg/dL. All samples were
tested on 3 lots of test strips in duplicate using one the OneTouch Verio IQ
meter. All samples were also tested on the YSI 2300 analyzer to generate the
expected values. The observed values were plotted against the expected
values and an appropriate line fitted by standard linear regression was
generated with results summarized below:
Strip Lot Slope Intercept R2
1 0.939 3.44 0.998
2 0.932 3.60 0.998
3 0.939 3.77 0.998
The sponsor’s claimed range for the glucose assay is linear from 20-600
mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: OneTouch Verio IQ Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable
to the NIST SRM 917b reference material.
Controls and Test Strips previously cleared: See k093745 for traceability,
stability, and expected value information. OneTouch Verio Control solutions
submitted for k093745 are the same control solution material and same
concentrations as the control material used for this current submission k110637.
Due to changes in labeling regulations, these control materials have been renamed
for this current submission k110637.
OneTouch Verio Control Solutions:
Value assignment:
The value assignment of the OneTouch Verio control solutions were
determined by an in-house procedure. The control solutions were prepared by
gravimetric addition of glucose to achieve target values of 120 ± 15 mg/dL for
level 3 and 350 ± 15 mg/dL for level 4 and values were confirmed by a
laboratory method. Verification of the control solutions were tested with 100
test strips and 10 meters with each level and the target ranges were set at the
following:

[Table 1 on page 6]
	Strip Lot			Slope		Intercept			R2	
1			0.939			3.44		0.998		
2			0.932			3.60		0.998		
3			0.939			3.77		0.998

Glucose control solution Target Acceptable range
concentration
Level 3 (medium) 120 mg/dL 120 ± 15% (102-138 mg/dL)
Level 4 (high) 350 mg/dL 350 ± 15% (298-403 mg/dL)
Stability:
Real time stability was performed to assess the shelf-life and open-vial
stability of the control solutions and test strips. Stability studies protocol and
acceptance criteria were provided and found to be adequate. Unopened
control solutions have a 15 month shelf life and are stable for 3 months after
first use when stored at 5-30oC (41-86 oF). Unopened test strips have a 12
month shelf-life and are stable for 3 months after first use when stored at 5-
30oC (41-86 oF). This information is provided in the labeling of the test strips
and control materials.
d. Detection limit:
See linearity study above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference study was designed according to CLSI EP7-A2 guideline. 23
common endogenous and exogenous interference substances were evaluated
by spiking venous whole blood with two levels glucose concentrations (65
mg/dL and 240 mg/dL).
The glucose samples were spiked with the potentially interfering compounds
and tested on 3 lot of test strips. Each glucose concentration has five different
concentrations of the interference substances. The labelling states that
elevated concentrations of acetaminophen, ascorbic acid, uric acid,
tolazamide, and xylose may affect the blood glucose results. Bias was
calculated as the difference between the test and control concentration groups.
The sponsor claims no significant interference for the substances and
concentrations shown in the table below:

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Altitude Study:
This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of altitude on the OneTouch Verio
IQ BGMS. Three (3) lots of test strips were tested on 16 meters using blood from
three donors at three glucose concentrations ( 70, 240, and 450 mg/dL) at three
altitude levels ( 3000, 6000, and 10,000 feet), and at sea level (0 feet) as a control.
In addition, testing was performed in a hyperbaric chamber. Each venous blood
sample was tested on the OneTouch Verio IQ Blood Glucose monitor and the meter
readings obtained were compared to the YSI method; then analyzed as a bias
difference. Based on the data, the OneTouch Verio IQ BGMS can be used at
altitudes up to 10,000 feet. The glucose values obtained using the OneTouch Verio
IQ had biases that were within +/-10 of glucose values obtained at sea level.
2. Hematocrit Study –
The sponsor performed hematocrit studies using five different hematocrits (Hct)
(19, 30, 40, 50 and 61%) levels across the glucose measuring range (20 – 600
mg/dL). At each hematocrit level, each test strip lot was tested with three
samples, at each of the five glucose levels (30, 65, 240, 450, and 560 mg/dL)
Three lots of test strips were tested on 12 meters and the values were compared to
the YSI method. The sponsor claimed that hematocrit values between 20% to
60% do not significantly affect the glucose results. The glucose values obtained
using the OneTouch Verio IQ were within +/- 15% of the glucose values obtained
using the YSI method.
3. Temperature and Relative Humidity Study:
In this study, three test strip lots were tested at 9 combined temperature and
relative humidity conditions, including the nominal conditions (22ºC/50% RH)
and eight conditions at the limits of the claimed temperature/relative humidity
ranges. Temperatures evaluated ranged from 5ºC to 45ºC and relative humidity
from 10% to 90%. Each sample tested was also compared to the YSI reference
method. The study was conducted over four days, with each day the nominal
T/RH condition (22ºC/50% RH) was tested along with two extreme
temperature/relative humidity conditions. Three blood samples were adjusted to
target glucose concentrations of 65, 240, and 450 mg/dL. At each T/RH
condition, two replicates on six meters were obtained for each donor, glucose
level and test strip lot (N=108 tests per strip lot). ). The results supported the
Sponsor’s claimed operating temperature from 5oC to 45oC (41oF to 113oF) and
relative humidity range from 10% to 90%.

4. EMC - Electromagnetic Compatibility and Electrical Safety verification testing of
the OneTouch® Verio™IQ Blood Glucose Monitoring System was performed
following the requirements of ISO 15197:2003(E), Section 6. In addition to ISO
15197:2003 (E), verification testing was carried out in accordance with the
system-level performance criteria specified in OneTouch® Verio™IQ Product
Requirements Document (PRD). All series of testing were performed in
accordance with ISO 15197:2003 (E) as applicable to the meter. The following
series of testing was performed:
Protection Against Electric Shock, Protection Against Mechanical Hazards,
Electromagnetic Compatibility (Radiated Emissions), Electromagnetic
Compatibility and Electrical Safety,Electromagnetic Compatibility (Radiated
Radio Frequency Immunity), Electromagnetic Compatibility (Electrostatic
Discharge Immunity) Electromagnetic Compatibility (AC Power), Resistance to
Heat, Resistance to Moisture and Liquids, Protection Against Liberated Gasses,
Explosions, and Implosion, Meter Components, Mechanical Resistance to Shock,
Vibration, and Impact (Vibration), Mechanical Resistance to Shock, Vibration,
and Impact (Drop Test),Equipment Temperature Exposure Limits, and Equipment
Humidity Exposure Limits
All tests were conducted to meet applicable international standards for safety and
reliability of the OneTouch® Verio™IQ Blood Glucose Meter. The software
documentation for EMC testing was reviewed and was found to support that the
device was developed and is under good software lifecycle processes. A
certification is provided by the sponsor.
5. Sample volume study – LifeScan performed a sample volume study to demonstrate
that 0.4µL of whole blood is sufficient volume for the LifeScan Verio IQ BGM
system. LifeScan performed testing of 0.201µL - 0.469µL sample volumes using
three different lots of strips. The blood glucose results for samples collected
using sample volumes of at least 0.4µL demonstrated biases within +/- 10% of
glucose values obtained with the YSI 2300.
6. Infection control – The device (LifeScan Verio IQ Blood Glucose Meter) is
intended for single - patient use. Disinfection studies were performed on the
meter and lancet device by an outside commercial testing service to determine the
disinfection efficacy of the meter and lancing device to the recommended
cleaning and disinfection protocol, and its effectiveness in preventing the spread
of bloodborne pathogens, to include hepatitis B virus (HBV). Clorox Germicidal
wipes (EPA Reg. No 67619-12) were validated, demonstrating complete
inactivation of live virus for use with the meter and lancing device. The sponsor
also conducted robustness studies and demonstrated that there was no change in
performance or in the external materials of the meter and lancing device after
1,825 cleaning and disinfection cycles to simulate 5 years of use by lay-users.
Each robustness cycle consisted of one pre-clean wipe and one disinfecting wipe.
