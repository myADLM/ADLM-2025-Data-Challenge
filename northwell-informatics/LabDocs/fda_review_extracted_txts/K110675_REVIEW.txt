Devices – Second Edition
CLSI Guideline, EP9-A2 Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient
Samples – Second Edition
L. Test Principle:
EasyRA BUN:
For the Medica EasyRA BUN test, urea in the sample is first hydrolyzed by urease to
give ammonia and carbon dioxide. The ammonia produced reacts with 2-oxoglutarate
and stabilized NADH analog in the presence of glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) to
form glutamate and NAD (II). The decrease in the concentration of the reduced
cofactor (NADH), monitored at 340 nm is proportional to the concentration of the
Urea in the sample.
EasyRA Creatinine:
The method uses multistep enzymatic reactions. The creatinine is hydrolyzed to
sarcosine with Creatinine Amidohydrolase and Creatine Amidinohydrolase. The
sarcosine is then oxidized via sarcosine oxidase to produce glycine and hydrogen
peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide is reacted with 4-aminoantipyrene and N-ethyl-N-
sulfopropyl-m-toluidine (ESPMT) to produce a quinoneimine dye. The reaction is
monitored at 550 nm. The increase in absorbance is proportional to the level of
creatinine in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Serum and plasma- Precision studies were performed on the EasyRA
analyzer in conjunction with the matrix comparison study with lithium heparin
tubes. Duplicate plasma and serum samples from the method studies were
calculated for average SD for 3 partitioned bins covering the ranges tested.
The average SD in each of the 3 bins for both plasma and serum are
comparable.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Plasma - Linearity studies were not conducted in plasma. See previously
cleared linearity data in k080823 (BUN) and k080874 (Creatinine) for serum
samples. The linear reportable ranges for each assay are summarized below.
BUN Creatinine

Reportable
Range
An extended linearity study was performed for all analytes with the EasyRA
analyzer to evaluate accuracy and precision. The sponsor recommends a
dilution of 1:2 when the patient BUN and creatinine results in plasma fall
outside the upper measuring range of 70 mg/dL and 15.0 mg/dL, respectively.
A dilution study was performed for BUN on 3 different patient plasma
samples spiked with standard albumin stock solution to increase the BUN
level in the range of 70 to 140 mg/dL, for creatinine 5 different patient plasma
samples were spiked with standard creatinine stock solution to increase the
creatinine level in the range of 15 to 30 mg/dL. Each sample was then diluted
with saline at 1:2 dilution by the analyzer or manually. Each diluted sample
was run in triplicate on two EasyRA analyzers. The % recovery range of the
system for each analyte is provided in the table below:
EasyRA %
Recovery
BUN 100.6 to 103.7
‘
Creatinine 97.5. to 103.2
In addition a simplified within-run precision study was performed in the
extended linearity range for all analytes by analyzing 3 plasma samples, 20
consecutive times. The within-run precision data is summarized in the table
below:
