L. Test Principle:
The Oragene•Dx collection device collects and stabilizes human DNA from saliva; it
can also be used for the transportation and long‐term room temperature storage of a
sample. Oragene•Dx is a non‐invasive alternative for collecting high quality and
quantity DNA for use in molecular diagnostic applications that are cleared for use
with the Oragene•Dx collection device.
All formats consist of a collection tube, stabilizing liquid and optional sponges for
assisted collection. After saliva is collected, the stabilizing liquid is mixed with the
sample. Saliva can be delivered directly by spitting or using provided sponges to
transfer saliva into the device.
Upon contacting saliva cells, the stabilizing liquid lyses cellular and nuclear
membranes to release and stabilize nucleic acids. Samples can be immediately
processed, transported or stored for future use. Device and sample integrity are
preserved during typical ambient transport and storage conditions for up to 12
months. DNA extraction from Oragene•Dx can be performed using alcohol
precipitation or other methods for the purpose of molecular diagnostic applications.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Two reproducibility studies were performed.
1. Device reproducibility using prepared sample panel: a study was
performed to evaluate the reproducibility of the performance of the
Oragene∙Dx device (OGD-500 format) with the GenMark Diagnostics
eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test (k110786) across multiple sites and
operators.
Ten donors self-collected six saliva samples each (two samples per lot x three
lots of OGD-500). Two samples collected using the same OGD-500 lot were
pooled to generate three samples per donor. Triplicate aliquots of each sample
from each donor were provided to four operators at three sites for DNA

extraction (purification)1. Site 2 and 3 each had one operator and Site 1
(internal) had two operators for a study total of four operators.
All purified genomic DNA samples were tested for concentration and
A /A ratio at a single external DNA Testing Site, Site 3. The eSensor
260 280
Warfarin Sensitivity Testing was performed by the same four operators at the
three sites where DNA extraction was also performed.
All specimens yielded a DNA concentration of 2 ng/µL or better, DNA purity
(A /A ) between 1.2 and 2.3 and total DNA yield of at least 10 ng (0.010
260 280
µg).
Each patient specimen was tested nine times on the eSensor Warfarin
Sensitivity Saliva Test by each operator, for a total of 36 tests per sample.
Each no-call was re-run. After the first round of testing, total percent
agreement between the results of the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test
and genotype (by sequencing) was 85.30%. Two first-pass runs were
invalidated at Site 3 due to contamination in the PCR blank (DCM failures)
which resulted in 47 no-calls. After re-testing of the genomic DNA samples,
total percent agreement was 100%.
2. Reproducibility of Sample Collection, Processing and Testing Procedure:
A study was performed to evaluate the reproducibility of the entire
Oragene∙Dx sample collection, processing and genotyping procedure. Samples
were directly shipped from donors to investigational sites for analysis of DNA
yield, concentration, A /A ratio and eSensor® Warfarin Sensitivity Test
260 280
genotyping. Donors were selected based on their naivety to the OGD-500
device; all donors had used the product at most once previously.
The study was conducted at three sites: one internal site and two external
clinical laboratories. Donors (n=15) were each shipped four OGD-500
devices. Each donor was asked to provide four samples: one sample was sent
directly by the donors to each of the three sites. (One sample was sent to DNA
Genotek for remediation purposes if needed.) Each operator extracted one
aliquot of DNA from each saliva sample they received and determined the
DNA concentration and A /A ratio using their laboratory’s standard
260 280
procedures, prior to testing the sample on the eSensor® Warfarin Sensitivity
Test. One donor did not return any of their samples and thus was excluded
from the study. 14 samples were tested once at each site for a study total of 42
tests.
All specimens yielded a DNA concentration of 2 ng/µL or better, DNA purity
(A /A ) between 1.2 and 2.3 and total DNA yield of at least 10 ng (0.010
260 280
µg).
First pass genotyping test results yielded a total percent agreement of 90.50%
with four wrong calls. Three wrong calls were due to one patient specimen
(one wrong call at each testing site). Upon sequencing the reference sample
for this patient, it was determined that this donor had an interfering mutation
1 One of the six samples provided had to be excluded since it failed incoming study screening criteria.

--- Page 5 ---
at the site adjacent to the 2C9*2 mutation: 429C>T. This mutation is
described in the literature and is known to impact genotyping results at the *2
loci. (This limitation is stated in the GenMark Diagnostics eSensor Warfarin
Sensitivity Saliva Test package insert.) The other wrong call was for a patient
specimen, the result was “low signal for all polymorphisms”. The sample was
cloudy suggesting that it was compromised. Re-test of the extracted genomic
DNA yielded the identical incorrect call. Total percent agreement after re-
testing (donor with the 429C>T genotype was excluded from the analysis and
one wrong call was obtained again using the genomic DNA extracted from the
cloudy saliva specimen) was 97.40%. (A new sample was obtained from the
latter donor, tested, and a correct result was obtained.)
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Tracability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Pre-collection shelf-life stability: Shelf-life stability testing of the Oragene
Dx collection devices involves storage at three temperatures: ‐20°C, 6°C and
room temperature (23°C). Two sets of endpoints: chemistry endpoints
(evaluating the chemical parameters of the device reagents, including pH and
conductivity) and DNA endpoints (DNA concentration, yield and A /A
260 280
ratio) are evaluated at each time point. At designated time‐points, devices are
removed from the storage conditions; pH and conductivity of the reagents are
evaluated. The devices are used to collect saliva samples from 12 donors,
followed by DNA extraction and evaluation of the DNA endpoints. Stability
testing protocols and sponsor’s acceptance criteria were reviewed and found
to be acceptable.
Current real-time data supports a shelf-life 24 months at ambient temperature
(recommended), and 12 months at -20 °C and 6 °C.
Stability of samples post-saliva collection: A study was performed to evaluate
the stability of samples after saliva collection. Thirty donors each self-
collected four saliva samples in each format (OGD-500, OYD-500 and
OXD-525). (OGD-500 and OGD-575 have identical chemical properties;
therefore OGD-575 was not included in this evaluation.) Three lots of devices
in each format were used with 10 donors per lot. Each of the four devices per
donor were stored at a different storage temperature (room temperature, 6°C, -
20°C and 50°C) for up to 3 years (studies are on-going). At each time point,
an aliquot of sample was extracted and the DNA was analyzed for
concentration, yield and A /A ratio.
260 280
For OGD-500 and OYD-500 devices, all specimens from samples stored at -
20°C, 6°C or 24°C for 12 months yielded a DNA concentration of 2 ng/µL or
better, DNA purity (A /A ) between 1.2 and 2.3 and total DNA yield of at
260 280
least 10 ng (0.010 µg). For OXD-525 devices, all specimens from samples
stored at 24°C for 3 months yielded a DNA concentration of 2 ng/µL or better,
DNA purity (A /A ) between 1.2 and 2.3 and total DNA yield of at least 10
260 280
5

--- Page 6 ---
ng (0.010 µg). Therefore, the claimed sample stability is 12 months for OGD-
500, OGD-575 and OYD-500 at ambient temperature and is 3 months for
OXD-525.
For all formats, all specimens from samples stored at 50°C for 1 and 3 months
yielded a DNA concentration of 2 ng/µL or better, DNA purity (A /A )
260 280
between 1.2 and 2.3 and total DNA yield of at least 10 ng (0.010 µg).
A sub-population of samples (chosen from the four Oragene Dx formats,
different storage time points and conditions) were tested on the eSensor®
Warfarin Sensitivity Test. Eight donors used the collection device, followed
by DNA extraction and evaluation on the genotyping test.
In first-pass results, there was 98.0% agreement (400/408 tests) of the
eSensor® Warfarin Sensitivity Test results to bidirectional sequencing. After
re-testing, there was 99.8% agreement (407/408 tests) between the eSensor®
Warfarin Sensitivity Test results and DNA sequencing. First-pass failures
were a result of seven no-call results and one incorrect call2.
Freeze-thaw study: Environmental conditions experienced during shipping
were simulated by subjecting samples to freeze-thaw cycles (samples stored at
high temperatures that could be experienced during shipping were evaluated
above). After pooling samples for the post-collection stability study above,
one aliquot was removed from each pooled sample and subjected to three
freeze‐thaw cycles. DNA was extracted from each sample and tested for
concentration, yield and A /A ratio. 30 samples per format (OGD-500,
260 280
OYD-500 and OXD-525) were evaluated for a total of 90 samples.
All specimens yielded a DNA concentration of 2 ng/µL or better, DNA purity
(A /A ) between 1.2 and 2.3 and total DNA yield of at least 10 ng (0.010
260 280
µg).
d. Detection limit:
Sample Volume Tolerance: The OGD‐500 collection device is intended for
the collection of 2 mL of saliva. A study was conducted to evaluate the effect
of over or under filling into an OGD‐500 collection device.
Individuals spit into four different devices with varying fill-to lines (1 mL, 1.5
mL, 2.0 mL and 3.0 mL). The actual amount of saliva collected was examined
as well as the impact of delivering less and more saliva (the volume of
stabilizing liquid each device was unchanged) on DNA yield, purity,
concentration and testing on a genotyping device.
A total of 60 donors were asked to collect saliva using the 4 devices with
differing fill to lines. A total of 240 DNA samples were analyzed for DNA
concentration, yield and A /A ratio. In addition, all 240 samples were
260 280
processed on the eSensor® Warfarin Sensitivity Test.
2 One sample from donor 5 was incorrectly called *1/*2; this sample was extracted from a device stored for
one month time point at -20C. Investigation by the sponsor concluded this was most likely due to operator
error, resulting from contamination of donor 5’s sample as it was aliquoted after a sample that was *1/*2.
6

--- Page 7 ---
When collected saliva volumes were examined, it was apparent that donors
successfully delivered saliva corresponding to the fill to line. The median
amount of saliva collected was typically just above the fill to line (1.12 mL [1
mL target], 1.65 mL [1.5 mL target], 2.25 mL [2 mL target], 3.04 mL [3 mL
target]) This study demonstrated that as the fill to line increases between 1
mL, 1.5 mL, 2 mL, and 3 mL, the concentration of DNA also trends up with
medians of 26.6 ng/μL, 36.0 ng/μL, 42.1 ng/μL, 47.9 ng/μL, respectively.
When the fill to line was set at 2 mL for the OGD‐500 collection device, the
DNA concentration range was 7.66 – 168.12 ng/μL, with 95% of samples
having a minimum concentration of 11.49 ng/μL.
This study also has demonstrated that as the fill to line increases between 1
mL, 1.5 mL, 2 mL, and 3 mL, the total DNA yield also trends up with
medians of 18.0 μg, 25.9 μg, 36.1 μg, 48.6 μg, respectively. When the fill to
line was set at 2mL the minimum amount of DNA collected was observed to
be 6.4 μg, with 95% of samples above 9.3 μg, 91.7% of samples had a
minimum yield of 10 μg.
DNA quality as assessed by A /A ratio remains constant. The study has
260 280
demonstrated that as the fill to line increases between 1 mL, 1.5 mL, 2 mL,
and 3 mL, the A /A ratios remain constant with medians of 1.7, 1.7, 1.7,
260 280
1.8, respectively.
Within this range of collected saliva 100% agreement (after re‐testing) was
observed between bi‐directional sequencing and the eSensor® Warfarin

e. Analytical specificity:
Effect of Endogenous Interfering Substances: Interfering substances including
salivary α-amylase, hemoglobin, immunoglobulin A (IgA) and total protein
were spiked into saliva samples at the highest amounts found in literature. 10
donors provided five saliva samples each which were each spiked with one of
the four interfering substances. A control sample was included. All samples
were evaluated for effect on DNA concentration, purity, A /A ratio and
260 280
testing on a genotyping device.
All specimens spiked with endogenous substances yielded a DNA
concentration of 2 ng/µL or better, DNA purity (A /A ) between 1.2 and
260 280
2.3 and total DNA yield of at least 10 ng (0.010 µg).
Three independent DNA extractions were performed on each sample. There
was 100% agreement between the eSensor® Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test
results and bidirectional DNA sequencing for all test substances in first pass,
demonstrating no effect of any interfering substances on genotyping.
Effect of Exogenous Interfering Substances: Potentially interfering exogenous
substances (eating, drinking, chewing gum, using mouthwash and smoking)
introduced into saliva samples through various activities were tested. Each
activity group was composed of five donors who each provided three samples
- a baseline/control sample prior to the activity, and samples collected
immediately after the activity and then 30 minutes after the activity. (It is
recommended that sample collection only be performed at least 30 minutes
after one of these activities.) Three samples per donor were tested.
All samples were evaluated for effect on DNA concentration, purity, A /A
260 280
ratio and testing on a genotyping device.
All specimens collected after one of the various activities listed above yielded
a DNA concentration of 2 ng/µL or better, DNA purity (A /A ) between
260 280
1.2 and 2.3 and total DNA yield of at least 10 ng (0.010 µg) (even collection

There was 100% agreement between the eSensor® Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva
Test results and bidirectional DNA sequencing for all activities tested in first
pass, demonstrating no effect of any interfering substances on genotyping.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed in order to determine the accuracy
of the genotype obtained on the eSensor® Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test
(k110786) using saliva samples collected by the Oragene•Dx collection device
as compared to bi-directional DNA sequencing. The total assay correct call
rate for this study (316 samples) is 99.05% and a 95% confidence lower
bound of 97.56%; see k110786.
b. Matrix comparison:
A study was performed to evaluate the four formats of the Oragene•Dx
collection device, OGD-500, OYD-500, OXD-525, and OGD-575.
A total of 45 donors were asked to collect saliva using the four different
collection devices. Only 43 OGD-575 samples were returned. A total of 178
DNA samples were analyzed for DNA concentration, yield and A260/A280
ratio and 178 tests were performed on the eSensor® Warfarin Sensitivity
Saliva Test. The samples obtained using the OGD-500 device were used as
the control.
All samples collected from the four formats yielded a DNA concentration of 2
ng/µL or better and total DNA yield of at least 10 ng (0.010 µg). All samples
collected using the OGD-500, OYD-500 and OGD-575 formats had DNA
purity (A /A ) between 1.2 and 2.3; 97.8% of the samples collected with
260 280
the OXD-525 sample had DNA purity (A /A ) between 1.2 and 2.3.
260 280
After first pass genotyping tests on the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva
Test, three samples from the OGD-575 model generated a no‐call on the
eSensor® Warfarin Sensitivity Test for a total percent agreement of 98.3%.
The three no‐calls originated from a single run and were due to an eSensor®
Warfarin Sensitivity Test control failure and not an issue with sample signal.
Re‐testing was performed as per the eSensor® Warfarin Sensitivity Test
product insert and all three samples got a correct genotyping result, for a final
total percent agreement of 100%.
