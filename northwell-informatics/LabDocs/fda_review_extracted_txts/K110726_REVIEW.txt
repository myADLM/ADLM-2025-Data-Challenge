The sponsor includes the following warning in the labeling:
Warning: Bilirubin may cause erroneous acetaminophen results
Serum indices must be run on all acetaminophen samples and the
acetaminophen results must be evaluated using the appropriate serum index
for icteric samples.
All Acetaminophen results must be reviewed at the analyzer or at the host
(LIS and Middleware) before being released. An acetaminophen result
cannot be released if it is below the measuring range or has an associated
bilirubin level above the I index specified in the following tables.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None were referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The enzyme, arylacylamidase, cleaves the amide bond of the acetaminophen
molecule, leaving p-aminophenol and acetate. Subsequently, the p-aminophenol is
converted to an indophenol in the presence of o-cresol and a periodate catalyst. The
production of indophenol is followed colorimetrically. The change in absorbance is
directly proportional to the quantitative drug concentration in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
Analytical performance of these devices was reviewed under k991598, k013757,
k060373. Additional Interference study was included in this submission.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Established in original submissions (k991598, k013757, k060373)
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Established in original submissions (k991598, k013757, k060373)
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Established in original submissions (k991598, k013757, k060373)
d. Detection limit:
Established in original submissions (k991598, k013757, k060373): For cobas
c501 and Hitachi 917 the original LoQ was 1.2 mg/dL, while for the Integra
assay the original LoQ was 0.7 mg/dL; however, due to the bilirubin
interference, the claimed LoQ of the candidate acetaminophen assay is limited
to 15 mg/dL for all three analyzers.
e. Analytical specificity:
Established in original submissions (k991598, k013757, k060373):
Additional studies were performed to evaluate the effects of endogenous

interferences such as 1. icterus (bilirubin), I index, 2. hemolysis (hemoglobin),
H index, and 3. lipemia (intralipids), L index. Specifically, conjugated and
unconjugated bilirubin, hemoglobin (erythrocyte lysates) and lipids
(intralipids) were tested according to the CLSI EP7-A2 guideline. Normal
human serum pools with very low serum indices for icterus, hemolysis and
lipemia were spiked with acetaminophen and endogenous substances
including conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin, erythrocyte lusate and
intralipids (study #1). For each sample, acetaminophen recovery was
measured with three replicates and the I/H/L index was determined. In
addition, unaltered (native) patient samples with high bilirubin levels and
spiked acetaminophen were tested in these studies as well (study #2). The
sponsor defined insignificant interference as less than 10% difference between
the control and test samples. The notes in the labeling state that
acetaminophen assay results cannot be released to the users under conditions
where interference is greater than 10%. Results are summarized below.

Based on the study data summarized in the tables above and assuming the
worst possible outcome/interference when either normal serum pool spiked
with conjugated bilirubin or serum pool with high total bilirubin were tested,
the sponsor stated in the black box warning statement that “an acetaminophen
result cannot be released if it is below the measuring range or has an
associated bilirubin level above the I index” of 4 for ~ 15 mg/dL
acetaminophen, 9 for acetaminophen levels between 30-50 mg/dL and 12 for
samples above 50 mg/dL of acetaminophen (please see section H.3. above) )-
see table below.
Acetaminophen Interference occurs with an I
[mg/mL] index* greater than
15 - 30 4
> 30 - 50 9
> 50 12
* I Index value – corresponds approximately to mg/dL of bilirubin
Hemolysis
Acetaminophen Interference occurs with an H*
[mg/mL] Index greater than
15 - 30 8
> 30 - 50 200
> 50 350
* An H Index of 1 corresponds to an approximate 1 mg/dL of hemoglobin (0.625 mmol/L)
Based on the study data summarized in the table above, sponsor stated in the
package insert the following: “Hemolysis causes a significant interference
with the acetaminophen assay. Do not use hemolyzed samples.
Acetaminophen results cannot be released if the associated H index is greater
than 8”.
Lipemia
Acetaminophen Interference occurs with an L*
[mg/mL] Index greater than
15 - 30 1400
> 30 - 50 1800
> 50 2000
* An L index of 1000 is equivalent to a 1000 mg/dL Intralipid solution

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Existing literature reference was used:
1. Tietz NW. In: Textbook of Clinical Chemistry. Philadephia, PA; 1986.
2. Rumack BH. Acetaminophen overdose. Arch Intern Med 1981 ;141 :380. and
the following was recommended in the product insert:
“Toxic manifestations have been observed at serum concentrations> 100
mg/mL (> 662 mmol/L), however the toxic range is generally reported at >200
mg/mL (> 1324mmol/L). Toxic concentrations can be more effectively related
to post dose interval; >200, > 100, and> 50 mg/mL (> 1324, >662, and >331
mmol/L) serum concentrations correspond to toxic concentrations at 4, 8, and
12 hours post dose, respectively. The therapeutic range varies and has been
reported to be 10 to 30 mg/mL (66 to 199mmoVL). Each laboratory should
investigate the transferability of the expected values to its own patient
population and if necessary determine its own reference ranges.
N. Proposed Labeling:

--- Page 13 ---
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
