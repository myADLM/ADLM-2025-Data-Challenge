I. Device Description:
The ADVIA® 1650 Chemistry Ferritin reagents are ready-to-use liquid reagents. They
are supplied in two different package sizes, 200 or 800 tests per wedge with 4 wedges
per kit.
There are two reagents. Reagent I consists of glycine buffer, pH 8.3 (170mmol/L),
sodium chloride (100 mmol/L), bovine serum albumin (0.5%) and sodium azide
(0.09%). Reagent 2 contains latex particles coated with rabbit anti-ferritin antibodies,
glycine buffer, pH 7.3 (170 mmols/L), sodium chloride (100 mmols/L), bovine serum
albumin (0.1%) and sodium azide (0.09%).
ADVIA® Chemistry Liquid Specific Protein Calibrator is a multi-analyte, liquid, human
serum based product containing multiple analytes. They are supplied as ready-to-use
1.0-mL solutions in 6 vials, one for each of 6 calibrator levels. The low level (Level 1)
is a zero-level calibrator with no analytes present in the formulation. The target ferritin
concentrations of Levels 2 – 6 are 25, 50, 100, 225 and 475 mg/dL. All analytes except
ferritin and C-reactive protein (CRP) were cleared previously in k103701. There are no
changes to the existing products except the addition of ferritin value assignment process
and the addition of the ferritin analyte to the intended use of the device.
The recommended controls are three serum pools previously cleared in k992550

L. Test Principle:
In the ADVIA® 1650 Chemistry Ferritin method, a diluted sample reacts with buffer
containing latex particles coated with polyclonal rabbit anti-Ferritin antibody. The
formation of the antibody-antigen complex results in increased turbidity, which is
measured as the amount of light absorbed at 658 nm. Using a standard curve from the
absorbance of calibrators, ferritin concentration of a sample can be determined.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Individual serum pools at various concentrations of ferritin and serum-based
control materials were tested. Each sample was assayed in duplicate, 2 runs per
day, for at least 20 days, yielding 80 observations for each sample. The results
are summarized in the table below:

b. Linearity / assay analytical range:
A high serum pool and a low serum pool were used to prepare nine (9) different
ferritin concentrations evenly distributed throughout the assay range. The mean
observed ferritin concentration of triplicate measurements at the nine (9) ferritin
concentrations was compared with the expected concentration. A weighted
least squares linear regression analysis of the linearity data shows that the assay
is linear from 6.0 ng/mL to 450 to 500 ng/mL with a slope of 1.03 (95%
confidence interval (CI): 1.01 − 1.05) and y-intercept of -0.03 (95% CI: -0.08 −
0.03). Deviation from linearity was ≤10%.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The Ferritin values assigned to the calibrators are traceable to the
Third International Standard NIBSC 94/572.
Stability of the ADVIA® 1650 Chemistry Ferritin Reagent: Shelf-life stability
was determined upon storage of the reagents at 2-8ºC for 1, 2, 3, 8 or 13 weeks,
6, 12 or 18 months. On-board stability was evaluated upon storage of the 20-
mL wedges in the instrument for 0, 8, 20, 31, 43, 59 or 62 days and 70-mL
reagent wedges for 0, 7, 22, 31, 44, 56, 60 and 63 days. Sample recovery at
each time point was compared to day 0. Data supports the shelf life stability
claim of 18 months at 2-8ºC and on-board stability claim of 60 days.
Stability of the ADVIA® Chemistry Liquid Specific Protein Calibrators:
Calibrator vials were opened one time and then closed and kept in the
refrigerator at 2-8ºC for 29 days. Controls were run in quadruplet as samples
using calibration curves generated with the once-opened calibrators and fresh
unopened calibrators. Recoveries between the two sets of calibrators were
compared. Test results support open-vial stability claim of 28 days. In
addition, the data for stability of unopened calibrator vials were provided. Tests
results support shelf-life of 24 months at 2-8ºC for unopened calibrator vials.
d. Detection limit:
The performance at low levels was evaluated according to CLSI guideline
EP17-A. A human serum pool without ferritin and four human serum pools with mean
values ranging from 3.95 ng/mL to 6.13 ng/mL were tested in six (6) replicates on two
instrument systems using two lots of reagents for five (5) days with two (2) runs per day.
Results show that the limit of blank, the limit of detection and the limit of
quantitation are 1.2 ng/mL, 4.5 ng/mL and 6.0 ng/mL, respectively.
e. Analytical specificity:
i. Endogenous Interference: Human serum pools with various concentrations
of ferritin were spiked with hemoglobin up to 1000 mg/dL, unconjugated
bilirubin and conjugated bilirubin up to 60 mg/dL, intralipid up to 1000
mg/dL, and rheumatoid factor up to 2500 IU/mL prior to analysis with the
ADVIA® 1650 Chemistry Ferritin Reagent. Ferritin concentration observed
at each level of an interferent was compared to the observed ferritin
concentration of the un-spiked human serum pool. Low level of
interference (<10%) was observed in the samples with ferritin concentration
at approximately 300 ng/mL. Visibly hemolyzed or lipemic samples will
produce erroneous results for samples with low ferritin concentrations:

ii. Specificity of Assay to Ferritin Isoforms: Specificity was tested using a
human serum pool with ferritin concentration within normal range, which
was spiked with a concentrated solution of a specific ferritin isoform (liver
isoform at concentrations up to 200 ng/mL, spleen isoform at concentrations
up to 200 ng/mL, heart isoform at the concentrations up to 300 ng/mL, and
placenta isoform at concentrations up to 300 ng/mL). The specificity was
evaluated by comparing recoveries of spiked sample and un-spiked sample
relative to the amount of isoform spiked into a sample. The results are
summarized below. The isoform values have clinical relevance regarding
the presence of iron overload in certain organs or tissues. It should be noted
that the ferritin assay does not identify the tissue isoforms.
