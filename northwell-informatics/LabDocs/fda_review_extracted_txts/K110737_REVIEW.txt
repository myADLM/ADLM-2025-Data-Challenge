L. Test Principle:
The Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System, Model GM700 uses electrochemical
methodologies. The system quantitatively measures blood glucose levels using an
amperometric method. The system employs flavin adenine dinucleotide-glucose
dehydrogenase (GDH-FAD) enzyme chemistry. The electrons generated during this
reaction are transferred from the blood to the electrodes. The magnitude of the
resultant current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the specimen and
the signal is converted into a readout displayed on the meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed within-run precision studies using venous whole blood
samples spiked with five different glucose concentrations (30 to 50, 51 to 110,
111 to 150, 151 to 250, 251 to 400). Each glucose level was analyzed in
replicates of 10, with 3 test strip lots, and 10 meters for a total of 300 tests per
each glucose level for each meter. Results are summarized below:

Within-run precision for glucose:
Glucose Number Mean SD CV
Level of tests (mg/dL) (mg/dL) (%)
(mg/dL)
30 to 50 300 42.8 1.3 2.97
51 to 110 300 80.1 2.0 2.46
111 to 150 300 132.6 2.6 1.93
151 to 250 300 196.3 3.7 1.88
251 to 400 300 335.8 5.3 1.57
Between-day precision was evaluated using five levels of glucose control
solutions with concentrations (39 to 59, 107 to 145, 201 to 273, 300 to 406,
and 418 to 566 mg/dL). Each sample was measured in duplicate with three
test strip lots and 10 Rightest GM700 meters. These tests were performed
over 20 days, for a total of 400 tests per glucose level. Results are
summarized below.
Between-day precision for glucose:
Glucose Number of Mean SD (mg/dL) % CV
Level tests (mg/dL)

201 to 273 300 237.5 4.3 1.82
300 to 406 300 354.5 7.0 1.97
418 to 566 300 496.3 8.6 1.74
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using three test strip lots and 15 mixed pools of
venous blood samples ranging in glucose concentrations (as measured by YSI)
of 3, 10, 23, 44, 92.0, 148, 190, 252, 292, 356, 391, 447, 526, 571, 620 mg/dL
for test strip lots #2 and #3 and 1, 14, 21, 42, 99, 154, 216, 255, 313, 353,405,
443, 522, 594, 641 mg/dL for test strip lot #1. Each level was measured in
triplicate with each of 3 test strip lots and the values from the Rightest GM700
meter were compared with those obtained from YSI-2300. Results from
regression analysis:
Test strip lot #1: y = 0.9882x + 0.5809; R2 = 0.9994
Test strip lot #2: y = 0.9932x + 0.6005; R2 = 0.9986
Test strip lot #3: y = 0.9912x + 2.8143; R2 = 0.9990
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement
range of 20-600 mg/dL.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM700 is traceable to the
NIST SRM 917b reference material. The method comparison study was
performed using the candidate device and YSI as the reference method (see
Section 2.a.)
Test Strip Stability:
Test strip stability was assessed in accelerated and real time studies. Testing
protocols and acceptance criteria for the Rightest Blood Glucose Test Strips
GS700 were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer claims
shelf life stability of 18 months and an open-vial stability of 4 months at the
recommended storage temperatures of 39°F-86°F.
Control Solution Value Assignment and Stability:
Value assignment: Five levels of aqueous control solutions (levels 1 to 5) are
available for use with the Rightest GM700 test system. Value assignment for
use of the control solutions with the Rightest GS700 glucose test strips is
based on measurements using the YSI 2300. The values for each of the control
solutions are assigned by repeat analysis using Rightest GM700 test strips and
ten Rightest GM700 meters. The mean, SD and CV are used to establish the
ranges for each control solution which are provided on the test strip vial label.
Stability Testing: Stability was assessed using real-time and accelerated
testing for each control solution level. Protocols and acceptance criteria were
reviewed and found to be acceptable to support the shelf life stability claim of
16 months and an open-vial stability claim of 3 months when stored at the
recommended storage temperatures of 36°F to 86°F.
d. Detection limit:
See linearity study in Section M1b above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed by spiking venous blood with two levels
of glucose concentrations (60 to 100 and 150 to 300 mg/dL). Each of these
samples was divided into a test pool and a control pool and each of 18
potential endogenous and exogenous interfering substances was added to the
test pool. Each compound was tested at two concentrations,
normal/therapeutic and high/toxic concentrations.
Each sample was analyzed 5 times with the Rightest GM700 meter and the %
difference between the interferent containing sample and the control sample
calculated. The sponsor defines no significant interference as ≤10%

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
System Accuracy:
To assess system accuracy, results from the Rightest GM700 Blood Glucose
Monitoring System were compared to a reference method, YSI 2300.
Capillary samples from 109 participants with glucose concentrations ranging
from 22.3 to 500 mg/dL were tested using three test strip lots. To obtain
extreme blood glucose concentrations some samples were altered. The results
relative to YSI are summarized in the tables below:

contains the test strip port. The code key identifies the test strip code
automatically; therefore, no coding is required by the user. The labeling includes
instructions for the user to contact customer service if the Code Error symbol
appears on the meter. The code key is replaceable, but only by an authorized
Bionime representative.
6. Quality Control:
Five levels of aqueous glucose control solutions are available with this system.
Control solution Level 2 is provided with the kit. The meter has a function for the
11

--- Page 12 ---
user to select the level of control solution they wish to run to prevent control
results from being stored in the internal memory as patient results.
Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the
labeling. The control solution readings are not included in the average of the
patient results when the measurements are performed in the “CS measurement
mode”. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial
label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside
these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1) Hematocrit Study: The effect of different hematocrit levels on the performance of
the Rightest GM700 Blood Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated using
venous whole blood samples with hematocrit levels 20, 25, 30, 40, 55, 60 and
65% spiked with glucose to achieve 6 concentrations ranging from 40 to 400
mg/dL (20 to 50, 60 to 80, 135 to 165, 180 to 220, 270 to 330, 360 to 440 mg/dL).
Each sample was then tested 9 times using the Rightest GM700 glucose meter
and the values were compared with those obtained from YSI-2300 analyzer. The
% biases relative to YSI were acceptable within the claimed hematocrit range of
30 to 55%.
2) Altitude study: Venous whole blood samples collected from 5 volunteers and
adjusted to obtain 3 glucose concentration ranges (30 to 50, 80 to 120, 240 to 360
mg/dL) were tested at 0, 3280, 6562, and 10,745 feet (0, 1000, 2000, 3275
meters) above sea level. Results were compared to YSI values. The results
demonstrate acceptable bias to YSI to support the claims in the labeling that
altitudes up to 10,000 feet (3048 meters) have no significant effect on blood
glucose measurements from the Rightest GM700 glucose meter.
3) Sample volume study: The sponsor performed a study to verify the test strip
sample volume requirement and the test strip fill error requirement established for
the Rightest GM700 system. Blood samples were tested at six sample volumes
(0.6, 0.65, 0.75, 0.8, 1.0 and 1.25µL) and values obtained were compared to YSI
values. Results support the claimed sample volume of 1.0 mL and the error code
for insufficient sample volume.
4) Temperature and humidity studies: The sponsor performed temperature and
humidity studies using venous blood samples to evaluate temperatures ranging
from 6.3oC to 43.6oC and relative humidity from 11% to 92%. Meter results were
compared to YSI values. Six temperature and humidity combinations were tested
including low temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity, average
temperature/low humidity, average temperature/high humidity, high
temperature/low humidity, and high temperature/high humidity. No significant
effect (relative to YSI) was observed with the temperature and humidity
combinations tested. The results support the claims in the labeling that the
12

--- Page 13 ---
system can be used in conditions of 43 to 111°F (6 to 44°C) with relative
humidity of 10 to 90%.
5) Infection Control Studies: The device is intended for single-patient use only.
Discide Ultra disinfecting towelettes with EPA registration #10492-4 were
validated demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus for use with the meter
and lancing device. The sponsor also demonstrated that there was no change
in performance or in the external materials of the meter and lancing device after
550 cleaning and disinfection cycles (one cycle includes one cleaning wipe plus
one disinfecting wipe) to simulate 5 years of meter and lancing device use.
Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and
disinfection procedures.
6) EMC testing was evaluated and certified by SGS Taiwan LTD. and Verification
of Compliance certificates provided.
7) Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the results
demonstrated that the User Manual, test strip package insert and control solution
package insert were written at the 8th grade level.
8) Customer service is available Monday through Friday 8:00 am to 5:00 pm PST by
calling 1-888-481-8485.
