I. Device Description:
The Gold Standard Diagnostics H. pylori ELISA IgG Test is an enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay where antigen is bound to microwells in polystyrene microtiter
plates. A detection antibody (Conjugate) labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)
to detect antibodies to H. pyori in serum is added. The Substrate contains
tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) which is oxygenated by the Conjugate to produce a blue
end product. The Stop Solution is an acid that stops the reaction and turns the
substrate yellow if antibody is present in the patient serum. The kit also includes a
Wash Buffer, Diluent, a Negative Control, Positive Control, and a Cutoff Control.
The controls are provided to determine if the assay is functioning properly and to
determine the antibody level. The kit contains 12 x 8well antigen coated microtiter
strips in a frame. The reagents are sufficient for 96 determinations.

L. Test Principle:
The antibody searched for in the human serum forms an immune complex with
the antigen coated on the microtiter-plate. Unbound immunoglobulins are
removed by washing processes. The enzyme conjugate attaches to this complex.
Unbound conjugate is again removed by washing processes. After adding the
substrate solution (TMB), a blue dye is produced by the bound enzyme
(peroxidase). The color changes to yellow when the stopping solution is added.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

The results obtained for both precision and reproducibility studies were
acceptable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls
The ready to use controls serve for a qualitative determination of antibodies. Their
concentration can be expressed in units. Fluctuations resulting from the test
procedure can be balanced with this calculation method to produce a high
reproducibility. Use the means of the OD values for calculation of the units (see
calculation of units below).
Test function control:
a) The OD of the blank should be < 0.150
The OD-values of the negative controls should be lower than the OD-values
mentioned in the Quality Control Certificate. The OD-values of the positive

controls as well as of the cut-off controls should be above the OD-values
mentioned in the Quality Control Certificate.
b) Units of the cut-off controls are defined as 10 Units. The calculated units of the
positive controls should be within the ranges mentioned in the Quality Control
Certificate. If those requirements (OD-values, units) are not fulfilled, the test has
to be repeated.
Calculation of Units:
The OD of the blank value (450/620nm) has to be subtracted from all other OD’s.
Units* = (OD controls or samples / OD of cutoff) x 10
Interpretation of the Test:
Units Interpretation
< 9.0 negative
9.0 – 11.0 equivocal
> 11.0 positive
*Units are defined by the manufacturer.
i. If the measured values are above the defined equivocal range, they are
considered to be positive.
ii. If the measured Unit is within the equivocal range, no significant high
antibody concentration is present, the samples are considered to be equivocal.
Retest the sample and if the results are again equivocal, no significant
antibodies are present. For the definitive detection of the presence of H.
pylori it is necessary to determine the antibody concentration of two serum
samples, one IgG and one IgM and in addition histology, culture and / or a
urease test. A correct diagnosis based on the evaluation of a single serum
sample is not possible.
iii. If the measured values are below the defined equivocal range, no measurable
antigen specific antibodies are present in the samples. The samples are
considered to be negative.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection was determined by testing the kit controls along with
a pooled positive sample and several dilutions of the pooled sample. The
limit of detection was determined at a 30 fold dilution of the pooled sample
giving an OD value of 0.379 with a corresponding unit value of 11.9.

Analytical specificity:
Cross Reactivity
An adsorption study was performed to evaluate cross reactivity. Sera with
different levels of antibodies to H. pylori were adsorbed with H. pylori, and
Candida albicans, E. coli, Borrelia burgdorferi, Clostridium spp.,
Campylobacter, Bacillus, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Proteus and two different
strains of H. influenza. The identity of the bacteria used were identified by the
ATCC and confirmed with the MALDI-TOF method. The bacteria were
evaluated at a concentration of 107cfu/ml or higher. The adsorbed samples were
compared to the untreated samples and the mean percent inhibition was
calculated. The results are summarized in the following table:
Organism Concentration (cfu/ml) Mean percent
inhibition
Helicobacter pylori 96%
Candida albicans 2.40x107 1.8%
Escherichia coli 6.90x107 9.5%
Borrelia burgdorferi 1.00x108 5.5%
Clostridium spp. 1.20x107 6.0%
Campylobacter 1.50x109 4.7%
Bacillus Cereus 4.40x107 18.2%
Enterobacter 1.80x108 2.1%
Pseudomonas 1.45x108 5.1%
Haemophilus Influenza 7.90x107 3.8%
Proteus 1.40x108 4.6%
The mean percent inhibition for H. pylori was 96%, and 1.8% to 9.5% with the
other organisms. There seems to be a weak cross reactivity with Bacillus. Taking
into account the normal test variation, the remaining cross reactivity with Bacillus
may affect high negative samples close to the equivocal range. With the exception
of the cross reactivity, no overall effects on the analytical specificity were seen on
the Gold Standard Diagnostics H. pylori ELISA IgG assay. A limitation statement
was included in the package insert.

Interfering Substances
The effect of potential interfering substances on samples using the Gold Standard
Diagnostics H. pylori ELISA IgG assay was evaluated. High levels of
hemoglobin, bilirubin, cholesterol and triglycerides in serum samples were tested
at the assay cutoff (9-11 units) in triplicate. The recommended concentrations
from the guideline “Interference Testing In Clinical Chemistry” from the Clinical
and Laboratory Standards Institute (18) were used (see table below). The tested
substances did not affect the performance of the Gold Standard Diagnostics H.
pylori ELISA IgG assay.
Substance Concentration H. pylori Mean Percent
concentration Inhibition
Hemoglobin 2 g/L 9-11 units 3%
Bilirubin 342 µmol/L 9-11 units 11%
Cholesterol 13 mmol/L 9-11 units 1%
Triglyceride 37 mmol/L 9-11 units -19%
Leukocytes, intestinal secretions or mucus, fat, and medications used to relieve
diarrhea or other gastric symptoms were not tested, therefore, it is not known if
these substances will interfere with the assay as they were not evaluated
f. Assay cut-off:
Determination of Cutoff
The cutoff was determined by testing normal sera from blood donors, clinical
defined samples, proficiency samples, along with sera positive for H. pylori,
borderline positive for H. pylori, and high negative for H. pylori for a total of 278
samples. The cutoff was determined by taking the negative average plus three
standard deviations of the blood donors. The cutoff was further adjusted so that
the clinically defined samples were positive, the proficiency samples met their
criteria, the positive H. pylori sera were positive, and the H. pylori negative sera
were negative.

Gold Standard Diagnostics positive samples, and predicate device negative
samples, one sample was equivocal, two negative, and ten samples were positive
by the third assay.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
H. pylori is universally distributed and affect both genders, all ages and races.
The prevalence of infection with H. pylori is higher in underdeveloped countries
and in the communities with low standard of living and poor hygiene. Studies in
asymptomatic Caucasians in the United States show that there is an increase in the
prevalence of H. pylori infection with age (13-15). An expected values study was
performed with the H. pylori IgG ELISA testing 625 patients from various
populations. Results showed that a total of 203 patients were positive with the
assay. The expected values result for the H. pylori IgG ELISA is 32%.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
