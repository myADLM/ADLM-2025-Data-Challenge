L. Test Principle:
MICT TSH is a magnetic immuno-chromatographic test (MICT) using Super Paramagnetic
particles (SPMPs) as the labeling agent. The SPMP magnetic field is quantified by a MICT
instrument.
MICT TSH is based on the principle of capillary flow and separation of immune complexes
bound to SPMPs within a porous matrix. In the test device, TSH antibody (Ab) – antigen (Ag)
immune reactions occur on a narrow strip of capillary membrane. The narrow strip is housed in
a disposable plastic cassette to form a test device.
The specimen containing the TSH antigens is mixed with a lyophilized conjugate pellet and
added into the sample well of the MICT cassette. As the TSH Ab-Ag, SPMP immune complexes
migrate through the test device, they are captured by the second antibodies at the test line. A
control line is formed by the control SPMP immune complexes. The MICT instrument is used to
analyze the quantity of magnetic particles captured on both control and test lines. A visible line
is not necessary for interpreting the MICT test result. The TSH concentration is directly
proportional to the magnetic signal and is reported based on the predetermined test algorithms
that are embedded in the cassette barcode labels.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision was determined using the CLSI EP5-A2 protocol as a guide. The study
was conducted at three external sites. Each site was supplied with three levels (low,
medium, high) of human serum samples. The high TSH sample was prepared by
spiking purified TSH antigen into pooled serum. The data was collected over 20 days
in duplicate with 2 runs per day with a total of 80 samples analyzed per level at each
site. The results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the MICT TSH method was determined following the CLSI EP6-A
procedure. Two samples were identified having TSH concentrations covering the
reportable range. A series of intermediate serum samples were prepared by diluting
the high level sample (126 μIU/mL) with the low level sample (0 μIU/mL). Sample 7
was mixed with the low level sample to generate samples with TSH < 8 μIU/mL
(samples 2 to 6).

The analysis yields the following relationship:
Observed = 1.017 (Expected) +.0494, R2 = 0.9985
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
A master file of the standard curve is generated for each lot of MICT TSH using
master calibrators referenced to the WHO 2nd IRP 80/558 standard. The master file
information is transferred to the MICT Instrument through the barcode label on the
test cassette. Each lot of MICT TSH device with dry reagent is calibrated at the
manufacturing site. The reagent is stable throughout the stated product shelf life.
For accelerated stability testing, two lots of the MICT TSH reagent devices were
heat-stressed at 40 °C for varying time periods. For real-time testing, one lot was
tested over a 14-month period. Based on accelerated and real-time stability testing,
the shelf-life for the MICT TSH test is 14 months when stored at room temperature
(22 °C).
d. Detection limit:
Five low TSH level human serum samples from different individuals were tested
using two MICT instruments and one reagent lot over a period of three days, two runs
per day following CLSI EP17-A guidelines. The TSH concentrations of the LoD
samples were verified by ADVIA Centaur CP TSH3-Ultra assay, which is traceable
to the WHO 3rd International Standard for human TSH (IRP 81/565). The LoD was

estimated to be 0.077 µIU/mL.
The bias of each of the five low concentration samples was estimated as the mean
MICT measured concentration of each sample minus its value as determined by the
ADVIA Centaur CP TSH3-Ultra. The bias of the lowest concentration sample was
used as an estimate of the bias of the LoQ since this concentration was closest to
LoQ. The total error was calculated to be smaller than the allowable error. The LoQ
therefore = LoD = 0.077 µIU/mL. The sponsor chose the reportable range to be 0.13
to 100 µIU/mL.
Hook effect: TSH was spiked into a human serum depleted of TSH standard that had
been completely depleted of TSH at 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 500, 1000, and 20000
μIU/mL. No hook effect was observed at TSH concentrations up to 2000 μIU/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference
The study was conducted using bilirubin, hemoglobin, phospholipids, and
triglycerides. Human serum samples with various TSH concentrations were spiked
with potential interfering substances and tested using the MICT TSH System.
Controls were prepared by spiking the samples with equal volumes of the solvents
that were used to dissolve the interfering substances. The concentrations of spiked
and control samples were recorded, and recovery rates were calculated. Bilirubin was
dissolved in DMSO plus 40 mM NaOH. Lyophilized hemoglobin and phopholipids
stabilized in triglycerides were weighed out and mixed with serum samples directly.
No significant interference as defined by the sponsor as ±10% was found for
bilirubin, hemoglobin, phospholipids, and triglycerides at the concentrations
presented in the table below.

The effects of rheumatoid factor (Rf) and human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) on
the MICT TSH assay were evaluated. Individual patient serum samples were mixed
with equal volume of HAMA or Rf positive samples. The final concentrations of Rf
and HAMA in these samples were 1,000 IU/mL and 400 ng/mL, respectively. The
mixed samples were analyzed in duplicate using the MICT system. The MICT TSH
assay shows no detectable interference within the sponsor’s acceptable limits (±10%)
with rheumatoid factor and HAMA.

b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable. Serum is the only sample type indicated.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
N/A
b. Clinical specificity:
N/A
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
N/A
4. Clinical cut-off:
N/A
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Serum samples from 147 normal, apparently healthy individuals, consisting of 97
females and 50 males were assayed on three lots of MICT TSH devices using two
MICT Readers. The reference range was determined using the procedure in CLSI
C28-A3. The expected normal range for the MICT TSH is 0.49 – 3.71 μIU/mL based
on the central 95% of the frequency distribution.
N. Instrument Name:
MICT TSH Instrument
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Automatic
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:

3. Specimen Identification:
Barcode
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Patient samples are pipetted into the conjugate tube, mixed then manually transferred into
the sample well of the assay cassette.
5. Calibration:
Calibration of the assay is performed at the manufacturer’s site. The test kits are stable
up to the expiration date. All instruments are calibrated against a known magnetic
standard by the manufacturer. Each system is standardized to read the magnetic material
within 2%.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor recommends the use of commercially available external control materials for
use with the MICT System. In the labeling the sponsor recommends that the quality
control material be run each day the system is used to report patient results. Also the
sponsor recommends that each day the MICT system is used to test patient samples the
user tests the verification cassette to assess the operational status of the MICT instrument.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
N/A
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
