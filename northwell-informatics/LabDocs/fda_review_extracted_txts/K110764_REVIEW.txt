H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use:
FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) is a multiplexed nucleic acid test intended for
use with the FilmArray instrument for the simultaneous qualitative detection and
identification of multiple respiratory viral nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal swabs
(NPS) obtained from individuals suspected of respiratory tract infections. The
following virus types and subtypes are identified using the FilmArray RP:
Adenovirus, Coronavirus HKU1, Coronavirus NL63, Human Metapneumovirus,
Influenza A, Influenza A subtype H1, Influenza A subtype H3, Influenza A
subtype 2009 H1, Influenza B, Parainfluenza Virus 1, Parainfluenza Virus 2,
Parainfluenza Virus 3, Parainfluenza Virus 4, Rhinovirus/Enterovirus, and
Respiratory Syncytial Virus. The detection and identification of specific viral
nucleic acids from individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of a respiratory
infection aids in the diagnosis of respiratory viral infection if used in conjunction
with other clinical and epidemiological information. Negative results do not
preclude respiratory viral infection and should not be used as the sole basis for
diagnosis, treatment or other management decisions. Positive results do not rule
out bacterial infection or co-infection with other organisms. The agent detected
may not be the definite cause of disease. The use of additional laboratory testing
(e.g., bacterial and viral culture, immunofluorescence, and radiography) and
clinical presentation must be taken into consideration in order to obtain the final
diagnosis of respiratory infection.
Due to seasonal low prevalence, performance characteristics for Influenza
A/H1, Influenza A/H3, Influenza A/2009 H1, Influenza B, Parainfluenza
Virus 1, Parainfluenza Virus 2, and Parainfluenza Virus 4 were established
primarily with retrospective clinical specimens.
Due to the genetic similarity between human Rhinovirus and Enterovirus, the
FilmArray RP cannot reliably differentiate them. A positive FilmArray RP

Rhinovirus/Enterovirus result should be followed-up using an alternate method
(e.g. cell culture or sequence analysis).
The FilmArray RP detects Adenovirus species C serotype 2 and serotype 6 with
reduced sensitivity. It is recommended that specimens found to be negative for
Adenovirus after examination using FilmArray RP be confirmed by an alternate
method (e.g., FDA cleared molecular test or cell culture).
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established when influenza
A/2009 H1N1, A/H1, and A/H3 were the predominant influenza A viruses in
circulation. When other influenza A viruses are emerging, performance
characteristics may vary. If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected
based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by
public health authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection
control precautions for novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local
health departments for testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases
unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.
2. Indication for Use: Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements: FilmArray instrument
I. Device Description:
The FilmArray RP pouch contains primers for the following respiratory pathogens:
Adenovirus, Coronavirus (HKU1 and NL63), Influenza A (with subtyping for
hemagglutinin genes H1, 2009 H1 and H3), Influenza B, human Metapneumovirus,
Parainfluenza Virus (serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4), Respiratory Syncytial virus, and
Rhinovirus/Enterovirus. The FilmArray RP pouch is a closed system disposable
that houses all the chemistry required to isolate, amplify and detect nucleic acid
from multiple respiratory pathogens within a single NPS specimen. The rigid
plastic component (fitment) of the FilmArray RP pouch contains reagents in freeze-
dried form. The flexible plastic portion of the pouch is divided into discrete
segments (blisters) which, through interactions with actuators and sensors in the
FilmArray instrument, are where the required chemical processes are carried out.
The user of the FilmArray RP system loads the sample into the FilmArray RP
pouch, places the pouch into the FilmArray instrument, and starts the run. All other
operations are automated. A summary of the FilmArray assays and targets is
presented in the following table:

The FilmArray RP Pouch
The FilmArray RP pouch is a closed system disposable that houses all the chemistry
required to isolate, amplify and detect nucleic acid from an NPS specimen. The
pouch is divided into discrete segments (blisters) where specific steps are carried
out. Reagents are arranged in the pouch such that sample is moved through the
disposable sequentially as each biochemical event is performed.
The FilmArray Instrument
The FilmArray instrument interacts with the FilmArray pouch mechanically,
thermally, and optically to drive a multi-step chemical process designed to detect
specific nucleic acid targets using multiplex nested PCR followed by DNA melting
analysis. The instrument follows a protocol that is defined by a set of codes that are
downloaded from the host computer at runtime. The instrument protocol defines the
specific timing and sequence parameters as the instrument performs the following
key functions:
• Perform cell disruption using the bead beater
• Extract nucleic acid from the disrupted sample
• Perform stage 1 PCR thermocycling of multiplexed PCR reaction
• Perform stage 2 PCR thermocycling of the array
• Execute a DNA melt and detect fluorescent signals generated
• Monitor system performance in real time and communicates out of
specification conditions to the user via the software

L. Test Principle:
The FilmArray RP System is multiplex nucleic acid test system composed of the
FilmArray instrument, the FilmArray software (preinstalled on a laptop computer)
and the FilmArray RP pouch. The FilmArray RP pouch contains freeze-dried
reagents to perform nucleic acid purification, reverse transcription, and nested,
multiplex PCR with DNA melt analysis. The Respiratory Panel (RP) pouch
identifies the following 15 respiratory pathogens: Adenovirus, Coronavirus HKU1,
Coronavirus NL63, Human Metapneumovirus, Influenza A subtype H1, Influenza A
subtype H3, Influenza A subtype 2009 H1, Influenza B, Parainfluenza Virus 1,
Parainfluenza Virus 2, Parainfluenza Virus 3, Parainfluenza Virus 4, Human
Rhinovirus/Enterovirus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus.
A test is initiated by loading Hydration Solution and an unprocessed patient
nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimen (i.e. specimen mixed with Sample Buffer)
into the FilmArray RP pouch. The pouch contains all of the reagents required for
specimen testing and analysis in a freeze-dried format. The addition of Hydration
Solution and Sample/Buffer Mix rehydrates the reagents. After the pouch is
prepared, the FilmArray software guides the user though the steps of placing the
pouch into the instrument, scanning the pouch barcode, entering the sample
identification and initiating the run. The FilmArray instrument contains a
coordinated system of inflatable bladders and seal points, which act on the pouch to
control the movement of liquid between the pouch blisters. Two Peltier devices
control heating and cooling of the pouch to drive the reverse transcription reactions,
the PCR reactions, and the melting curve analysis. Nucleic acid extraction occurs
within the FilmArray pouch using mechanical lysis and standard magnetic bead
technology. After extracting and purifying nucleic acids from the unprocessed
7

--- Page 8 ---
sample, the FilmArray performs a nested multiplex PCR that is executed in two
stages. During the first stage, the FilmArray performs a single highly multiplexed
reverse transcription PCR reaction. The products from first stage PCR are then
diluted and combined with a fresh, primer-free master mix and a fluorescent double
stranded DNA binding dye (LC Green®Plus, Idaho Technology Inc.). This second
master mix solution, is then distributed to each well of the array. Array wells
contain sets of primers designed specifically to amplify sequences internal to the
PCR products generated during the first stage PCR reaction. The second stage PCR,
or nested PCR, is performed in singleplex fashion in each well of the array. At the
conclusion of the second stage PCR, the array is interrogated by melting curve
analysis for the detection of signature amplicons denoting the presence of specific
viral or bacterial targets. A digital camera placed in front of the second stage PCR
captures fluorescent images of the PCR reactions in real time. The FilmArray
software automatically interprets the results of each DNA melting curve analysis
and combines the data with the results of the internal pouch controls to provide a
test result for each organism on the panel.
The melt detector module of the FilmArray Analysis software assigns positive and
negative results to melt curves generated in each well of the PCR2 array. Each assay
is present in triplicate wells distributed across the array. If at least 2 out of 3 wells
have positive melt curves with similar profiles, a positive result is assigned to that
assay. If less than 2 of the replicate wells have positive melt curves in the Tm
window, or if the curves are dissimilar, a negative result is assigned to the assay. A
meta-analysis determines the final result (Detected (positive), Not Detected
(negative), or Equivocal) for each RP organism. For organisms represented by a
single PCR2 assay, the assay result and organism result are the same. Results for
Influenza A, and Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus are determined by meta-analysis of
multiple assay results. Meta-analysis for Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus
incorporates the results of 6 different assays (Entero 1, Entero 2, HRV1, HRV2,
HRV3, and HRV4). The HRV assays recognize both Rhinoviruses and
Enteroviruses, while the Entero assays target an unique sequence that is not found in
Rhinoviruses. Any positive assay result will produce a combined Human
Rhinovirus/Enterovirus organism result. Organism results for Influenza A are
determined by meta-analysis of multiple pan-influenza A and subtype targeted assay
results. The FilmArray RP System is designed to both detect Influenza A and to
differentiate commonly occurring hemagglutinin subtypes. To accomplish this, the
FilmArray RP uses two Influenza A assays, (FluA-pan1and FluA-pan2) and three
subtyping assays directed at the hemagglutinin gene (H1-pan, H1-2009 and H3).
The H1-pan assay is designed to detect Influenza A/H1, including the Influenza
A/2009 H1 variant. The H1-2009 assay specifically detects the pandemic 2009
H1N1 variant. Meta-analysis for Influenza A is outlined in the following table:

*If both of the influenza A assays are positive, but none of the hemagglutinin subtyping assays are positive, then the interpretation is
‘Influenza A (no subtype detected)’. This result could occur when the titer of the virus in the specimen is low and not detected by the
subtyping assays. This result could also indicate the presence of a novel Influenza A strain. In both cases, the sample in question should
be retested. If the retest provides a different result, test the sample a third time to ensure the accuracy of the result. If the retest provides
the same result, then the function of the RP pouches should be verified by testing with appropriate external control materials (known
positive samples for Influenza A H1, Influenza A H3 and Influenza A 2009 H1) and a negative control reaction should be run to test for
PCR-product contamination. If the FilmArray RP accurately identifies the external controls, contact local or state public health authorities
for confirmatory testing.
In general, Influenza A is determined to be detected if at least one of the two FluA
pan assays is positive and the corresponding subtyping assay is also positive. If
neither of the pan assays is positive, but a subtyping assay is positive, then the result
is considered equivocal for that specific subtype and the sample should be retested.
If one of the pan assays is positive and no subtyping assay is positive, the result is
Influenza A Equivocal and the specimen should be retested. If both FluA pan assays
are positive and no subtyping assay is positive the result is reported as ‘Influenza A
(no subtype detected). The product literature instructs the operator to retest the
specimen. If the ‘no subtype detected’ result is repeated, the product literature
directs the operator concerning appropriate follow-up testing and, if needed,
notification of public health authorities.
If either the RNA Process Control or the PCR2 Control fails (negative assay result),
all organisms are assigned an ‘Invalid’ test result. Invalid results are also assigned to
all assays if the FilmArray instrument protocol or analysis does not complete, an
Instrument Error is reported, or a Software Error is reported. All test specimens that
receive ‘Invalid’ results should be retested.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision/reproducibility study panel of twelve specimens (refer to the table
below) was created by spiking simulated NPS sample matrix with known
quantities of live RP organisms. The specimens in the panel were designed so that
all 15 RP organisms would be tested at three concentrations (3 x LoD, 1x LoD,
and 0.1 x LoD). Several analytes were spiked into each specimen to simulate the

possibility of co-infections with multiple pathogens at various levels. Human
Rhinovirus (HRV) and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) were included in more
specimens than the other analytes because they were the most common panel

Following spiking, the composition of each specimen pool was verified by testing
with the FilmArray RP system. Pools that did not perform as expected were
remade. Pools that performed as expected were aliquoted into several individual
use vials, and frozen until the scheduled day of testing. Specimen aliquots were
hand-delivered (Site A) or shipped (Site B) to external testing sites on dry ice and
stored frozen (-70°C) at each testing site until the day of testing. All specimen
aliquots were tested on the same day they were removed from the freezer. The test
operators at test sites were blinded to the organisms and test levels in each
specimen.
Reproducibility testing was performed at three (3) test sites (Site A, Site B, and
Site C) by multiple operators (4-5 per site) using multiple (26) lots of reagents and
multiple (20) FilmArray instruments. Each specimen was tested 4 times per day (2
operators and 2 instruments per specimen) for 5 days at each site, giving a total of
20 test results from each test site (a minimum of 60 total test results for each
analyte at each concentration). Negative analyte results were derived from any
specimen that was not spiked with the analyte of interest. Every analyte was

negative results for each analyte all sites combined.
Between the three test sites, 20 different instruments and 26 different lots of
FilmArray RP pouches were utilized. A total of 1,056 specimens were tested over
the course of the study, and 92.7% (979/1056) of these specimens yielded valid

results on the first attempt (i.e., first loaded pouch). Invalid results or no results
were obtained for the remaining 77 (7.3%) specimens (no results for 31 specimens
due to incomplete runs; 46 specimens were “invalid” due to Pouch Controls
failures). The 31 incomplete runs consisted of Instrument Errors (14), Software
Errors (9), and 8 runs that were either aborted by the operator or failed to
complete. All samples for which the first pouch runs did not complete were
retested using a new pouch/sample to obtain valid results. All samples for which
the pouch controls failed were also retested using a new pouch/sample to obtain
valid results.

a Known failure mode in the instrument bladder system. A new bladder material has been implemented to reduce this error
mode.
b An additional 8 errors occurred; however, valid results were obtained by restarting the test using the same pouch.
c Known failure mode caused by a communication timing error between the FilmArray software and the driver of the
instrument camera. The underlying cause of the errors was resolved with an update to the FilmArray software. This error
mode was eliminated in software version 1.1. (Validation study of a total of 872 runs using software version 1.1
demonstrated 0% error rate caused by this particular error mode.)

a Includes 1 run that failed because the wrong protocol was selected.
b Investigation into the higher than expected rate of RNA process controls revealed that the QC process used to control the amount
of control template was inadequate. The QC process has been revised to better control the concentration of control template.
At each test site between 4 and 5 operators participated in the study, with at least 2
different operators testing samples each day. The number of errors experienced by
each test site was similar, though the percentage was lower for Site C due to a
higher number of runs performed. The distribution of errors between operators at
test sites A and B was somewhat variable, but there did not appear to be a strong
correlation between system errors and particular operators.

Precision (Repeatability)
The repeatability of the FilmArray RP System results was evaluated by repeated
testing of the same 12 specimens. The in-house precision testing was performed at
ITI (Site C) over the course of 12 testing days for a total of 48 test results per
specimen. On each day, all 12 specimens were tested 4 times by two operators on
two FilmArray instruments. Results from the first 5 days of testing are included as
the Reproducibility results for Site C. All operators were instructed to retest any
samples that produced Invalid test results (failed controls or incomplete runs).
Valid retest results were recorded as the final result.

Assay Controls
The FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) pouch contains two internal control assays:
1. The RNA Process Control targets an mRNA of the yeast,
Schizosaccharomyces pombe. During FilmArray RP pouch manufacture,
whole yeast are freeze-dried into the sample injection port of each pouch.
When the test specimen is loaded into the pouch, S. pombe is rehydrated and
enters the pouch with the specimen. The yeast nucleic acid is extracted,
purified and tested simultaneously with nucleic acids from the patient
specimen. A positive result for the processing control indicates that all steps
in the process (nucleic acid extraction, reverse transcription, PCR, melt,
detection, and analysis) are functioning properly.
2. The second stage PCR (PCR2) control assay detects a synthetic DNA
template that is dried into triplicate wells of the array along with the
corresponding primers. A positive result indicates that PCR2 was successful.

The RNA Process Control and the PCR2 Control assays are used to Pass or Fail
each FilmArray RP pouch run. This combination of control assays monitors each
of the critical mechanical and chemical processes that occur in a pouch run, while
limiting the possibility of random control assay failures that could contribute to
unnecessary pouch failures.
External controls are not provided with the FilmArray RP System. However, four
(4) frozen (-70°C) external control mixes were provided to the clinical study sites
for daily testing during the first phase of the prospective clinical trial (2009/2010
respiratory season). Three control mixes contained pooled NPS specimens spiked
with whole organisms with some plasmid DNA for hard to acquire organisms.
Combined, the 3 mixes covered all panel analytes. A fourth mix was negative for
all panel members and only contained pooled NPS:

The operators were required to complete a valid control mix run (correct results
obtained) prior to beginning patient sample testing on each testing day. A total of
300 control mix runs were attempted. Seventeen (17) runs did not complete and 6
runs had failed pouch control(s). Of the remaining 277 runs (site 1, 99 runs; site 2,
70 runs; and site 3, 108 runs), 7 (site 1, 1 run; site 2, 2 runs; and site 3, 4 runs)
(7/277; 2.5%) did not return the correct organism results either due to the
detection of an extra analyte (4/7) and/or the failure to detect one or more spiked
analytes (4/7). These failures may be due to low level virus from the NPS donors,
introduction of contamination during the preparation or testing of the samples, or
improper handling of the frozen aliquots.
Four external controls were used by study sites for daily testing during the second
phase of the prospective clinical study (2010/2011 respiratory season). Three of
the controls were freeze-dried, room-temperature stable, synthetic RNA mixes
that were rehydrated with Hydration Solution prior to being tested. Synthetic
RNA mixes were used in the second phase of the clinical study due to several
more organisms becoming difficult to obtain in the concentrations necessary for
high volume external control testing. Instead of including more plasmids in the
control mixes, validated synthetic RNA mixes were used. The RNA mixes are
designed to test all assays in the pouch for each of the analytes. Combined, these 3
mixes cover all analyte assays in the pouch. The fourth control consisted of
Hydration Solution alone (Negative):

The operators were required to complete a valid control mix run (correct results
obtained) prior to beginning patient sample testing on each testing day. A total of
137 control mix runs were attempted during the second phase of the prospective
clinical study (2010/2011 respiratory season). Seventeen (17) runs did not
complete and 3 had failed pouch control(s). Of the remaining 117 runs (site 2, 61
runs; and site 3,56 runs), 14 (site 2, 6 runs; and site 3, 8 runs) (14/117; 12.0%) did
not return the correct organism results either due to the detection of an extra
analyte (1/14) and/or the failure to detect one or more spiked analytes (13/14).
These failures may be due to introduction of contamination during the preparation
or testing of the samples, improper/incomplete rehydration of the control mixes,
or introduction of RNases into the synthetic RNA control mixes during
rehydration.
The sponsor is also recommending the following in the product package
insert: “Good laboratory practice recommends running external positive and
negative controls regularly. Use viral transport medium as the external Negative
Control, and previously characterized positive samples or negative sample
spiked with well characterized target organisms as external Positive Controls.
External controls should be used in accordance with local, state, federal
accrediting organizations, as applicable.”
Specimen Stability
An analytical study was performed to establish the recommended transport and
storage conditions for nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens that will be tested
using the Film Array Respiratory Panel System.
For the specimen transport and storage evaluation, both positive and negative
specimens were assessed. Positive specimens consisted of simulated NPS
(cultured human epithelial cells in VTM) spiked with mixes of targeted organisms
at 5 x the limit of detection (LoD) Negative data were collected from specimens
that had been spiked with a different organism mix, such that results for the
organism(s) of interest were expected to be negative. Ten independent specimens
were prepared for each organism mix and tested “fresh” or without storage (0
Hour). Additional aliquots were made and two aliquots of 10 specimens per mix
were stored at each of the conditions described below. Duplicate aliquots were
stored for each specimen to allow for retesting if needed. For each RP organism,

10 positive and 30 negative specimens were evaluated at each storage condition.
At least 9/10 positive results were required for each organism at each storage
condition. In addition to positive and negative results, the average crossing point
(Cp) of amplification curves and melting temperature (Tm) of melt curves were
reviewed for each assay at each storage condition. A shift in Tm or Cp from one
storage condition to another could indicate that the integrity of the specimen was
affected by storage.

In addition, the average crossing point (Cp) of amplification curves and melting
temperature (Tm) of melt curves were also reviewed for each assay at each
storage condition. The difference in average Cp (Δ Cp) and average Tm (Δ Tm)
between the test storage condition and the initial (0 Hour) test result was
calculated for each assay. When Δ Cp for all assays was reviewed, no general
trend toward later Cps (decreased sensitivity or fewer templates) was observed for
any one particular storage condition.
The results of this study support the claim that NPS specimens in Viral Transport
Medium (VTM) can be stored for up to 4 hours at room temperature (18-30°C), 3
days in the refrigerator (2-8°C) or 30 days in the freezer (< -15°C) without
affecting the accuracy of FilmArray RP test results.
Preservation of Vacuum for Pouch Hydration and Sample Loading and
Stability of Reagents and Control Material after Hydration and Loading of a
Pouch
To maintain pouch integrity and reagent stability, pouches are packaged in an
aluminum canister, which is then sealed under vacuum in opaque mylar outer
packaging. Ideally, a pouch is hydrated and sample loaded immediately after the
pouch packaging is opened, and the loaded pouch is immediately placed in the
FilmArray instrument for testing. However, laboratory workflow and instrument
availability may result in a pouch being opened before a sample can be loaded, or
a pouch to be loaded before an instrument is available for testing.
The FilmArray product literature recommends the loading and testing of pouches
immediately or within a limited timeframe (30 minutes for pouch loading and 60
minutes for testing a loaded pouch).
Analytical testing was performed to discover whether the integrity and
performance of an opened pouch is affected by longer times outside of the
vacuum-sealed packaging prior to loading and testing.
Pouches were removed from outer packaging and exposed to air at ambient
temperature for various times up to 24 hours. The preservation of vacuum for
pouch hydration and sample loading was evaluated by loading blank simulated
NPS (sNPS) samples (no target analytes present) according to standard procedure.
The volume of each solution (hydration solution and sample/sample buffer mix)
drawn into the pouch was recorded and the loaded pouches were then tested to
observe the performance of the internal controls assays. The control results from

these same pouches were used to assess reagent stability. Overall, the measures of
performance for these tests included the efficiency of pouch hydration and sample
loading, visual inspection of pouches, and the results (pass or fail) of internal
control assays (RNA Process Control and PCR2 Control).
The stability of reagents and control material after hydration and loading of a
pouch was also examined. Pouches were hydrated and loaded with blank sNPS
sample (no analytes present) according to standard protocol directly after removal
from outer packaging. The loaded pouches were then stored under ambient
conditions for various times up to 24 hours. The results of internal control
reactions (pass or fail) were assessed to determine whether system performance
was affected by storage of a loaded pouch prior to testing. In addition, four (4)
replicate pouches were loaded with contrived sample containing live respiratory
pathogens (Influenza A H1N1, human Metapneumovirus, Parainfluenza Virus 3
and Respiratory Syncytial Virus) at concentrations both above and below the
estimated system LoD. The loaded pouches were stored at ambient temperature
for 8 hours prior to testing. The results of both internal control and analyte assays
from these 4 pouches were compared to 8 control pouches that were loaded with
the same contrived sample but tested without storage (immediately after loading).
Each tested handling condition was considered successful if the variables
(including mean Cp for the relevant assay) evaluated were equivalent (within 3
cycles for Cp) to that of the control sample (test at time 0 after pouch opening or
loading). Any handling condition that resulted in improper pouch hydration,
sample loading, failed control results, or unexpected negative analyte results was
repeated to confirm the result. If the result was repeatable, then the integrity
and/or stability of the pouch were considered diminished under the handling
condition that caused the failure.
The data presented in the table below demonstrated that pouch vacuum was
preserved for up to 24 hours after the removal of a pouch from its outer
packaging, allowing for proper pouch hydration and sample uptake.

In conclusion, the data supports the conservative recommendations in the
FilmArray product package insert for the loading and testing of pouches within a
limited timeframe (30 minutes for pouch loading and 60 minutes for testing a
loaded pouch).
Fresh vs. Frozen Study
In order to utilize frozen banked clinical samples in the evaluation of FilmArray
Respiratory Panel System to supplement the prospective clinical study data, an
analytical study was conducted to demonstrate that preservation of samples (by
freezing at ≤-70°C does not affect the accuracy of test results compared to freshly
collected or freshly prepared samples.
The “fresh vs. frozen” analytical study was carried out as part of a larger
reproducibility study using samples that had been stored at ≤-70°C for as long as
30 days. The test samples were prepared in bulk and tested immediately after
preparation (fresh) prior to storage. The fresh sample tests provided a baseline of
performance to which the results from subsequent testing of the frozen samples
was compared.

--- Page 34 ---
A panel of twelve specimens was created by spiking simulated NPS sample
matrix with known quantities of live RP analytes. The specimens in the panel
were designed so that all RP analytes would be tested at different concentrations.
Multiple analytes were spiked into each specimen to simulate the possibility of
co-infections with multiple pathogens. Human Rhinovirus (HRV) and
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) were included in more specimens than the
other analytes because they were the most common panel members detected in co-
infected clinical samples during the clinical evaluation performed by ITI.
Immediately after sample preparation (spiking), each fresh specimen pool was
screened with the FilmArray RP system to establish ‘baseline’ or expected results.
The remaining specimen volume was then aliquoted into several individual use
vials, and frozen until the scheduled day of testing (up 30 days frozen at ≤-70°C).
Specimen aliquots were hand-delivered or shipped to external testing sites on dry
ice and stored frozen until the day of testing. All specimen aliquots were tested
on the same day they were removed from the freezer.
In total, at least 120 samples were tested for each analyte at (1x) or near (3x) the
LoD determined in the LoD studies. All contrived samples consisted of live
organism spiked into negative simulated nasopharyngeal swab sample matrix.
(Note: The simulated sample matrix consisted of human cells in viral transport
media (VTM) and was validated in “Validation of a Simulated NPS Sample
Matrix for Use with the FilmArray Respiratory Panel System”. The validation
study demonstrated that the sensitivity of the FilmArray RP system was
comparable between samples prepared in nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and
simulated NPS sample matrices.) Since the natural NPS samples are required to be
diluted in VTM before being tested by the FilmArray RP System, the simulated
NPS matrix consisting of VTM and epithelial cells is considered to be similar
enough to the natural matrix (i.e., NPS in VTM) for the purpose of this study.

a Three (3) Equivocal - not included as a positive result. Samples with Equivocal results were not retested in this study.
The results of this study demonstrated that freezing at ≤-70°C for up to 30 days
does not alter the performance of the FilmArray RP System in comparison to
testing of fresh specimens.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical studies were carried out to determine the LoD for each
FilmArray RP targeted organism.
A preliminary estimate of sensitivity for many RP analytes was determined as part
of the “FilmArray RP Melt Detector Tuning” study using limiting dilutions of
single organisms spiked into negative NPS specimens. Based on these preliminary
results, initial estimates of LoD were set by spiking negative NPS specimens with
serial 10- fold dilutions of quantified live virus. Where possible, each stock
organism was re-grown, verified, and quantified (TCID /mL, CFU/mL,
50
copies/mL, etc.). Coronavirus HKU1 could not be re-grown for verification
despite multiple attempts. Instead, clinical specimen containing a high viral load
of the virus of interest were quantified by non-FilmArray real-time PCR against a
standard curve of synthetic RNA transcript (Coronavirus HKU1) to obtain
quantification of the stock material in RNA copies/mL, respectively. The identity
of the virus contained in the clinical specimen was verified by bi-directional
sequencing. The single-spiked specimens were then tested with the FilmArray RP
System. The lowest concentration of organism for which all or most replicates
were assigned a positive (detected) result by the FilmArray software was selected
for additional testing in multi-spiked specimens.
Multiple organisms were combined and tested as a mix (multi-spike; see the
table below) in replicate NPS specimens at a single concentration or as a
dilution series centered on the estimated LoD. Results from single-spiked and
multi-spiked specimens were compared to determine whether the presence of
multiple organisms in a specimen would affect the system LoD.

Both percent detection (% positive) and Cp values were used to compare results
for single-spiked and multi- spiked specimen data sets. It was concluded that
multi-spiking and single-spiking results were substantially equivalent, since the
% detection was within 25% for the two data sets and/or the mean Cp values
were within 3 cycles. (Note: Based on an observed Cp standard deviation for
replicate samples of about 1-2 cycles, a 3 cycle difference is a conservative
estimate of the expected variation when testing near LoD and does not indicate a
significant difference in sensitivity.)
Additional LoD testing and confirmation of LoD for primary strains was then
performed with multi-spiked specimens. Coronavirus HKU1 was not included
in a multi- spiked mix for this study. Coronavirus HKU1 LoD was confirmed
as a single-spiked sample but was shown in subsequent studies to be detected
at single-spiked LoD levels when tested in multi-spiked specimens.
As needed, adjustments to the concentration of individual organisms within a
multi-spiked mix were made prior to confirmation of final LoD concentrations.
Confirmation of the system LoD for each organism included testing of 20
independent multi-spiked specimens at LoD and an additional 20 specimens
spiked 10- fold below LoD (0.1 x LoD). For confirmation, at least 19/20 positive
results were required for each organism at the LoD concentration and fewer than
95% positive results were required at concentrations below LoD.
Additional sensitivity testing was performed on one or more alternate strains of
several RP organisms. These alternate strains represented different major
subgroups of common respiratory viruses (Adenovirus, Human
Metapneumovirus, Human Rhinovirus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus) and
isolates of Influenza A and B from different decades and geographic locations.
Each alternate strain was tested as 10-fold dilutions around the previously
determined LoD.
Note: Although this testing was performed in part to demonstrate that the FilmArray RP system
can detect various species and strains of an organism with similar sensitivity, it is difficult to make
comparative sensitivity evaluations between different organisms and different strains that have
been quantified by TCID . This quantification method measures the infectivity and cytotoxicity or
50
lethality of an organism in tissue culture and is therefore subject to many influences (strain-to-
strain differences in infectivity, viability of the original material, culturing conditions, etc.).
Quantification by infectivity assay will not be equivalent between strains or organisms. Also, since
the measurand for the FilmArray system is nucleic acid, LoD concentrations established in TCID
50
can vary dramatically between targets, but may not actually reflect significant differences in
sensitivity of detection as measured by target nucleic acid concentration.

During the early stages of LoD testing, it was discovered that some NPS
specimens collected from apparently healthy individuals did in fact contain
respiratory pathogens (mostly Rhinovirus). As a result, a simulated NPS (sNPS)
sample matrix, consisting of cultured human epithelial cells (HeLa) in Viral
Transport Medium, was evaluated for use in LoD confirmation testing and
subsequent analytical studies. The sensitivity of the FilmArray RP system with
this simulated sample matrix was found to be comparable to a sample matrix
comprised of pooled NPS collected from healthy individuals. The simulated
NPS sample matrix was used for final LoD confirmations and all subsequent
analytical studies. (Note: Refer to “Validation of Simulated NPS Sample
Matrix for the FilmArray Respiratory Panel System” study for the results of a
side-by-side comparison of multi-spiked specimens prepared in a collected NPS
sample matrix versus a simulated NPS sample matrix.)
Summary results for the LoD confirmation studies using primary strains and

e. Analytical Reactivity:
The analytical inclusivity study was performed to determine whether the
FilmArray RP System is able to detect a variety of strains (inclusivity panel)
that represent the temporal and geographic diversity of each of RP target
organism. This study expanded upon the limit of detection studies by
determining whether different strains of the same organism can be detected
at similar concentrations.
This study involves testing panels of various inclusivity strains organisms spiked
into simulated NPS specimens using the FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP)
System. Inclusivity organisms were initially tested near the limit of detection
(LoD) for each organism as determined in the LoD study. If a specimen
containing a particular strain was positive (detected) at the LoD level, no further
testing of that strain was required. If a strain was not detected at the LoD
concentration, the strain was retested at the LoD level and 10-fold higher. If
necessary, the same approach was followed until a positive result was obtained or
the maximum concentration possible for that strain stock had been tested.
The inclusivity panel represents the evolutionary, temporal, and geographical
diversity of the RP analytes. For example, the inclusivity panel includes 17
different Adenovirus serotypes representing species A, B, C, D, E and F, over 20
Influenza A strains (subtypes H3, H1 and 2009 H1) isolated from around the
world as many as 77 years ago (1933) and as recently as 2009, and 25 strains of
the group that comprised of Human Rhinovirus A and B, Enterovirus, Echovirus,
and Coxsackievirus. However, for some analytes, the inclusivity panel is restricted
to only 1 or 2 strains because of limited strain diversity and availability.
For inclusivity (reactivity) testing, a total of 108 individual RP target organism
strains were tested and accurately identified with the FilmArray RP system. Each
of the 108 strains tested in this study were reactive with the FilmArray RP system.
The sensitivity of detection for Adenovirus C serotype 6 was 10,000-fold less than
the system LoD due to sequence variation (mismatches) within the primers of the
second stage PCR reaction. The sensitivity of detection for Adenovirus C serotype
2 was 100-fold less than the system LoD due to sequence variation (mismatches)
within the region targeted by the FilmArray RP Adenovirus assay. The limited
detection capability of the FilmArray RP system for these Adenovirus serotypes
was described in the FilmArray RP intended use as “The FilmArray RP detects
Adenovirus species C serotype 2 and serotype 6 with reduced sensitivity. It is
recommended that specimens found to be negative for Adenovirus after

a The 5’UTR sequences of these strains were aligned with the outer and inner PCR primers for the HRV assays to determine
whether sequence mis-matches may be contributing to the somewhat reduced sensitivity of the FilmArray RP system for these
strains. Primers for at least one of the 4 HRV assays (inner primers) aligned very well with published sequence for each strain
(0 – 1 mismatches in the primer region), suggesting that the observed differences in sensitivity are likely attributable to
inconsistencies in quantification of the viral stock rather than the sensitivity of the assay(s) themselves.
b Enterovirus species D is also referred to as Human Rhinovirus species C.

Supplemental Adenovirus Reactivity Information (clinical study data and in
silico analyses):
A subset of prospective and retrospective archived clinical specimens that were
FilmArray positive for Adenovirus was subjected to PCR and bi-directional
sequence analysis. BLAST analysis of the sequence data obtained for a region of
the Adenovirus polymerase gene identified adenovirus species B (serotypes 3,
3+11p, 7, 16 and 21), species C (serotypes 1, 2, and 5), and species E (serotype 4)
in these clinical specimens. Species B, C and E are the most common Adenovirus
species associated with respiratory illness. Species A, D, and F (often associated
with conjunctivitis and gastroenteritis) were not identified in clinical specimens,
In addition to laboratory testing, bioinformatics resources were also used to
predict reactivity of additional Adenovirus species and serotypes with the
FilmArray RP System. Simulated reactivity was based on the number and location
of mismatches between the target sequence and the assay primer(s). Table below
lists the Adenovirus types that were not tested by the FilmArray system either in
analytical or clinical testing. Bioinformatics analysis of these Adenovirus
sequences indicates that the FilmArray RP system will react with all Adenovirus
species and serotypes.

Supplemental Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus Reactivity Information
(clinical study data and in silico analyses):
In addition to the analytical inclusivity testing, BLAST analysis was performed on
sequence data (5’ UTR) obtained from prospective and retrospective archived
clinical specimens that were FilmArray positive for Human
Rhinovirus/Enterovirus. The following species and subtypes were identified in
clinical specimens:
Enterovirus Species A: Enterovirus serotype 71
Coxsackievirus A2 and A6
Enterovirus Species B: Echovirus serotypes 3, 6, 7, 11, 15, 21 and 30
Coxsackievirus B1, B3 and A9
Enterovirus serotypes 81 and 88
Rhinovirus Species A: Human Rhinovirus serotypes 1B, 8 ,9 ,10, 13, 19, 21,
22, 23, 28, 30, 32, 34, 38, 39, 40, 46, 47, 49, 51, 54,
56, 58, 59, 61, 62, 66, 68, 75, 77, 78, 80, 82, 98 and
100
Rhinovirus Species B: Human Rhinovirus serotypes 27, 69, 83 and 91
Rhinovirus Species C: At least 3 individual strains and 12 distinct isolates*
* Human Rhinovirus species C (also known as Enterovirus species D) has not been
classified into serotypes.
Simulated reactivity of the FilmArray RP Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus assays
with Enterovirus Species C Poliovirus strains was generated using a
bioinformatics approach. Alignment of assay primer sequences with the GenBank
sequences indicates the FilmArray RP assay will react with Poliovirus types 1, 2
and 3, giving a Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus result.

Additional analytical reactivity testing was carried out with three swine and avian
isolates of Influenza A. The results are presented in the following table:

a No reactivity was observed with the 2009 H1 subtyping assay.
b Purified and quantified RNA from avian influenza culture was obtained from BEI Resources.
Simulated reactivity of the FilmArray RP Influenza assays with additional
influenza strains of human, swine and avian origin was generated using a
bioinformatics approach. Assay primer sequences were aligned with GenBank
sequences corresponding to the appropriate gene targets and reactivity were
predicated based on the number and location of mismatches in the targeted region.
For each strain, multiple (3) GenBank IDs were evaluated, corresponding to the
gene segments targeted by the FilmArray RP assays (matrix (MA), non-structural
(NS), and hemagglutinin (HA)). The strains listed in the following table are
predicted to react with the pan-influenza A and H1, H3 or 2009 H1 subtyping
assays as indicated:

f. Analytical Specificity/Cross-reactivity Evaluation:
An analytical exclusivity study was carried out to assess the potential for
false positive results due to cross-reactivity between RP assays and other RP
or non-RP organisms. RP organisms and non-RP organisms were tested at
high concentrations and the non-RP organism exclusivity panel consisted of
organisms that are related to, but distinct from, RP target organisms, or that
could be present in specimens collected from the intended test population.
Exclusivity (cross-reactivity) testing was performed at Idaho Technology, Inc.
and an external testing site. Samples were prepared by spiking RP and non-RP
target organisms into NPS (or simulated NPS) sample matrix at a high
concentration (105 TCID /mL for viral targets and 106 CFU/mL for bacterial
50
targets, or the highest concentration possible based on the organism stock).
The RP target exclusivity panel included all of the primary strains used to

The non-RP target exclusivity panel consisted of 45 bacteria, 9 viruses, and 1
fungus (Candida albicans). The organisms included in the non-RP exclusivity
panel were selected either because they are related to RP target organisms, are
clinically relevant (colonize the upper respiratory tract or cause respiratory
symptoms), are common skin flora or laboratory contaminants, or are
microorganisms for which much of the population may have been infected
(Herpes Simplex Virus, etc.). None of the organisms in the non-RP target
exclusivity panel were tested positive by the FilmArray RP System assays except
for one measles virus strain. The false positive was found to be caused by
Adenovirus contamination of the viral stock and not due to cross-reactivity
between the Adenovirus assay and Measles virus.
The following table lists all of the non-RP organisms tested at high concentration. The

Laboratory testing of influenza strains was supplemented with in silico predictions
of exclusivity using bioinformatics and sequence alignments between FilmArray
RP assay primers and GenBank sequences for the strains shown in the table
below. Exclusivity was predicated based on the number of and location of
mismatches between assay primers and available strain sequences. For each
strain, multiple GenBank IDs were evaluated, corresponding to the genes targeted
by the FilmArray RP pan-influenza A and HA subtyping assays. All listed strains
are predicted to produce an Influenza A (no subtype detected) FilmArray RP
result.

Supplemental SARS Coronavirus Exclusivity Information (in silico
analyses):
In silico analysis of the SARS virus sequence (GenBank ID NC_004718.3)
against primers for each of the two non-SARS coronavirus assays (CoV HKU1
and CoV NL63) was conducted. When non-SARS coronavirus assay primers
were aligned with the corresponding target sequence from SARS virus, each
primer contained at least 6 mismatches. Based on these alignments, no reactivity
was predicted between SARS virus and the 2 FilmArray RP non-SARS
coronavirus assays.
g. Assay cut-off:
Melt Windows Determination:
Sequence diversity results in a range of melting temperatures (Tms) of the PCR2
melting curves for each of the target organism amplicons generated by the
FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP).

A mathematical model was used to predict the melting temperatures of all known
organism variants (within NCBI databases) for each assay. The distribution of
predicted Tms was used to establish an initial melt range for each assay. In
addition, the overall system variability, including for instrument, chemistry, pouch
lot and other sources of variability, was estimated using a synthetic template
melting data set generated on various FilmArray instruments using multiple pouch
lots. Historical RP Panel melting data were also considered to establish
appropriate melt ranges. In particular, the Analytical Inclusivity data and all
available patient specimen data from the clinical evaluation sites were considered.
These data sets included overall system variability and potentially included
additional organism sequence variants not accounted for in the NCBI databases.
Furthermore, data collected at the beta sites were used as an overall check and
validation for the proposed melting ranges.
For each of the pathogen assays, the lower and upper limits of the melting window
was calculated based on the minimum of the model prediction based on published
sequence variation, the clinical evaluation data, and the inclusivity data:

Melt Windows Validation
The validation of the melting windows was done in two steps. First, the Tms for
the data collected at the beta sites were compared to the melting windows
proposed. This comparison did not identify any Tm outside of the proposed
ranges. Second, as part of the FilmArray RP Melt Detector Tuning, multiple data
sets collected by the IVD and R&D groups and data collected at the clinical
evaluation sites were re-analyzed using the proposed melting ranges. This
validation did not identify any missed calls as a direct result of the window
location.
h. Interfering Substances:
An interference study was carried out to evaluate the influence of potential
interfering substances on the accuracy of test results obtained with the FilmArray
RP System. Four different organism mixes (refer to the tables below) containing
FilmArray RP analytes were spiked into a simulated NPS (sNPS) sample matrix
(human epithelial cells in VTM) at 5 x their respective LoDs. The 5 x LoD
organism concentration was chosen to be near the analyte LoD but also to provide
consistent results for sample-to-sample comparison.

substances that may be introduced into NPS specimens before or during sample
collection, such as medication, treatments, or topical applications for treating
symptoms associated with respiratory infections, were also included in this study.)
In addition, materials used to collect (swabs) or store (viral transport medium)
NPS specimens or substances that could be introduced from the clinical laboratory
environment (i.e. bleach, etc.) were tested as potential technique-specific
interfering substances. Potentially interfering test substances were spiked at a
level predicted to be above the concentration of the substance likely to be found in
an authentic NPS specimen.

On each day of testing, one specimen per organism mix was not spiked with any
test substance, to serve as a positive control. For biological test substances that
may contain genetic material (such as blood, mucin, DNA, microorganisms), one
negative specimen (blank sNPS sample matrix with no organism mix) was spiked
with only the test substance (negative control) to evaluate the potential for false
positive results due to the test substance itself. For each endogenous, exogenous,
and technique-specific test substance, one specimen per organism mix was spiked
with the appropriate amount of test substance. All specimens were tested with the
FilmArray RP System on the day they were prepared.
None of the potentially interfering endogenous, exogenous, or technique-specific
substances tested in this study were found to affect the accuracy of respiratory
pathogen detection in simulated NPS specimens using the FilmArray RP System.
In addition to the analytical interference substances study, the first phase
prospective clinical dataset was analyzed for evidence of the effects of potentially
interfering medications (prescription and over-the-counter; OTC) administered to
or taken by the study population. If clinically significant interference from
medications had occurred, it would be expected that the analyte detection rate in
the medicated population would be lower than that in the non-medicated
population. This effect was not observed in the clinical dataset. One or more
analytes was detected by the reference/comparator methods in 110 of 256 (43%)
non-medicated individuals. The FilmArray RP system correctly identified all
analytes in 104 (94.5%) of these individuals. One or more analytes was detected
by the reference/comparator methods in 313 of 597 (52%) medicated individuals.
The FilmArray RP system correctly identified all analytes in 302 (96.5%) of these
individuals. The table below lists the medications administered to or taken by the
enrolled study population (self-reported and/or recorded from patient charts).

gentamicin sulfate, monobasic potassium phosphate and dibasic potassium
phosphate. (Note: For the 2009-2010 respiratory season, a separate 2009 H1N1
variant vaccine was prepared and administered. The 2009 H1N1 variant vaccine
material was not provided by the manufacturer for testing with the FilmArray RP
system.)
Positive results were obtained for Influenza A/H1, Influenza A/H3, and Influenza
B in each of the samples tested at 10%, 1% and 0.1% (v/v) FluMist. Additional
dilutions were made and tested until each of the Influenza viruses could no longer
be detected by the FilmArray RP system (0.0001% for Influenza A H1, 0.00001%
for Influenza A H3 and 0.000001% for Influenza B). There was no reactivity with
the Influenza A/2009 H1N1 subtyping assay, which specifically detects the
pandemic 2009 A/H1 variant and was not included in the 2009-2010 FluMist
formulation.
This reactivity is documented in the FilmArray RP System product package insert
as a “limitation”.
i. Carry-Over Contamination:
An analytical carry-over study was carried out to demonstrate that when
recommended laboratory practices are followed, there is little risk of false positive
results caused by carryover or cross-contamination in the FilmArray Respiratory
Panel (RP) System. The data for this study were generated as part the exclusivity
testing examining the potential for cross-reactivity between Respiratory Panel
targets and assays. The majority of testing was performed by new users at a
contracted laboratory as part of an early performance evaluation of the FilmArray
RP system. Multiple spiked NPS (or simulated NPS) samples containing high
levels of organism (approximately 105 for viruses) were tested over several days
using 2 FilmArray instruments. Each sample was prepared and loaded into a RP
pouch one at a time in a work area (biosafety cabinet or hood) that was separated
from the location of the FilmArray instrument(s), and regular cleaning of the work
area and pouch loading station were carried out according to the recommended
testing procedures. Consecutive testing of the same organism was discouraged in
order to maximize the potential for detecting false positive results due to
carryover from a previously tested sample. Over 60 RP target organism spiked
samples were tested in a total of 63 valid runs, and at least half of the samples
were tested subsequently to a sample containing a different target organism at
high concentration. No false positive results were reported (100% negative
agreement). The consecutive set-up and testing of samples containing high
concentrations of different target organisms demonstrated that these practices are
effective in preventing false positive results due to carryover between samples.
Because the PCR2 array in each FilmArray pouch contains over 100 individual
PCR reaction wells in close proximity, the possibility of well-to-well carryover
was also examined. Individual false positive melt curves could be generated if (1)
reaction material (template and rehydrated assay specific primers) carried over
into an adjacent well early in second stage PCR cycling, or (2) amplicon from one
66

--- Page 67 ---
well entered a neighboring well prior to melt analysis. The 63 valid test results
described above (over 6000 reaction wells with no false positive organism or
assay results) were examined well-by-well and 4 false positive melt curves were
observed as a result of carryover between neighboring wells. Each carryover event
produced a single positive reaction well per assay and had no effect on the overall
accuracy of the FilmArray RP results. This well-to-well carryover analysis
resulted in an overall % negative agreement of 99.9% with the 95%CI of 99.9% to
100.0% (5342/5346 expected negative wells).
Combined, these results indicated that when proper laboratory practices are
followed, the risk of false positive FilmArray RP test results due to sample cross-
contamination or well-to-well carryover is insignificant.
j. Simulated NPS Sample Matrix Validation Study:
NPS is the intended sample type to be used with the FilmArray RP system. A NPS
is collected from an individual by inserting a flexible, fine-shafted synthetic swab
into the nostril and back to the nasopharynx. After a few seconds, the swab is
slowly withdrawn with a rotating motion and the swab is placed into a vial
containing approximately 3 mL of viral transport medium (VTM). Once in VTM,
vortexing helps to release the material collected by the swab (human cells, viral
particles, bacteria, secretions, etc.) into the medium, which is then used as the test
sample.
A series of studies was required to demonstrate the analytical performance
characteristics of the FilmArray RP system. For these types of studies, the ideal
sample matrix is NPS collected from healthy individuals that does not contain
nucleic acid from any of the pathogens detected by the panel. Initially, sample
matrix for contrived samples was obtained by collecting NPS from donors at
Idaho Technology, Inc (ITI). Each donor claimed to be healthy and free of
symptoms associated with respiratory infection on the day the NPS was collected.
Individual NPS were screened with the FilmArray RP system prior to use in the
studies, to confirm that the sample matrix was negative for RP organisms.
This process began in the early fall of 2009, at the onset of the typical respiratory
season, and it was found during screening that respiratory pathogens could be
detected in some percentage of healthy donor NPS. For example, over 2 months of
collection (November – December 2009), about 9% of the screened NPS were
positive for one or more FilmArray RP analytes. Some weeks, the rate was as high
as 26%. This pattern continued through the respiratory season with a positivity
rate of nearly 12% from January to March 2010. Furthermore, even after the
initial screening for negativity, false positive results were occasionally detected in
contrived samples and the false positive organism could often be traced to the
sample matrix.

The NPS being screened were collected from donors at ITI, following an IRB-
approved protocol. Under the terms of the protocol, the NPS specimens were de-
identified. Donations were incentivized by monetary compensation and a donor’s
healthy status was determined on the honor system. No personal information was
collected from the donors and no test results could be traced back to the donor. As
a result, if a NPS was positive for one or more RP organisms during screening, it
was not possible to follow-up with the donor to inquire about signs of infection
prior to or in the days following the date of donation.
Given the very large number of contrived samples needed for analytical studies, it
became apparent that use of a sample matrix of NPS collected from donors would
be problematic. Most importantly, the true negativity of the matrix could not be
adequately confirmed, which placed the accuracy and integrity of analytical
studies at risk. Consequently, the use of a simulated NPS matrix was investigated.
The intent was for the simulated NPS to resemble the content of an actual NPS as
closely as possible, while ensuring that the simulated NPS was free of respiratory
pathogens and did not alter the performance of the system.
Ten-fold dilutions of HeLa cells in VTM were prepared (from a starting
concentration of 2 x 105 cells/mL) and tested with the FilmArray system both
fresh and after being stored frozen (-20°C) for one week. Results were compared
to NPS collected from healthy donors and an appropriate cell concentration for the
simulated NPS was chosen by comparison of Cp values for the hRNA assay
(targets mRNA of the human beta-catenin gene) between the true and artificial
sample matrices. Once a human cell concentration was selected, contrived
samples containing multiple live respiratory pathogens at or near the estimated
system LoD were prepared in both NPS and simulated NPS sample matrices. The
organism mixes included the following:

Crossing point (Cp) values of amplification curves generated for all positive
assays were also used to compare results from samples prepared in NPS and
simulated NPS sample matrices. (Note: Though the use of Cp values in this study
was helpful in making comparisons, since the FilmArray RP is a qualitative rather
than quantitative system, and the FilmArray RP uses two-stage nested PCR,
therefore, Cps are inherently more variable than Cps in traditional real-time PCR
systems, the significance of these numbers can not be over-interpreted.). A
difference of 3 cycles or less was considered equivalent when comparing mean Cp
values between NPS and simulated NPS for the hRNA and organism assays.
All samples tested (NPS and simulated NPS) were negative for all panel
organisms and positive amplification and melt curves were recorded for the hRNA
assay. Average Cp values for the hRNA assay were calculated for each sample
type and plotted for comparison. The Cp values observed for the NPS (20.5 –
27.1) were consistent with historical data from NPS screening. The average Cp of
the hRNA assay was similar for fresh and frozen simulated NPS dilutions. The
average Cp for NPS was most similar to the Cp values obtained with simulated
NPS prepared at a concentration of 2 x 103 cells/mL. Based on this analysis, a
concentration of 2 x 103 HeLa cells/mL in VTM was selected as the composition
of simulated NPS.

The study generated no false positive results, and the results demonstrated that the
sensitivity of the FilmArray RP system was comparable between samples
prepared in nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and simulated NPS sample matrices. This
sample matrix was then used in analytical performance studies of the FilmArray
RP system in place of NPS collected from donors. Prior to use, all freshly
prepared simulated NPS were screened with the FilmArray RP system to confirm
that the hRNA assay provides the expected Cp values and that the sample matrix
was negative for all RP organisms.

k. Comparator Assays Analytical Validation Studies
In the prospective clinical trial for the FilmArray RP System, the FilmArray
results were compared to the results from standard viral culture and fluorescent
antibody testing performed by the clinical sites for several of the common
viruses (Adenovirus, Influenza A, Influenza B, Parainfluenza Virus 3, and
Respiratory Syncytial Virus). The majority of the remaining pathogens required 2
PCR comparator assays which were tested directly from the NPS specimens. The
exception to this was Influenza A subtyping, which was tested from viral culture
material with 1 assay per virus:

Analytically validated PCR followed by bi-directional sequencing assays that
target different sequences from those used in the FilmArray pouch were used by
ITI as part of a pre-defined composite comparator method for assays in the
FilmArray RP system.
ITI relied on its own Research & Development and Regulated Products groups to
develop and validate all of the comparator PCR tests used in this study. All assays
were designed to provide adequate amplicon length for sequencing while still being able
to specifically detect the organisms of interest. Some viruses possess few regions
to which a specific PCR assay can be targeted. This limited amplicon length and
gene target choice in some instances. However, all comparator assays were
designed to amplify a different sequence from that amplified by the FilmArray
assay(s).

A retrospective clinical evaluation of the FilmArray RP system was performed at
ITI to supplement the prospective evaluation data. In this study, retrospective pre-
selected archived specimens were further validated/confirmed by PCR assays
followed by sequencing analysis, and then tested with the FilmArray RP system.
Because it is possible that the provided samples had been misidentified, had
degraded during storage or contained additional pathogens (such as Rhinovirus)

Prospective Clinical Study
The clinical performance of the FilmArray RP system was evaluated during prospective
studies at 3 U.S. clinical laboratories. NP swab samples were collected and tested at 3
U.S. clinical laboratories (Sites 1, 2, and 3) during December 2009 thru May 2010
(2009/2010 respiratory season, the first phase of the prospective clinical study).
Additional patient enrollment and NP swab samples collection and testing were carried
out at 2 of the 3 sites (Sites 2 and 3) for an additional 5 month time period (September
2010 thru January 2011, 2010/2011 respiratory season, the second phase of the
prospective clinical study) for attempting to achieve increased detection of several low
prevalence analytes (i.e. PIV1, PIV2, and PIV4) during the anticipated peak season for
PIV1 and PIV2. Clinical study sites were chosen based upon the expertise of the
principal investigators, the quality of their personnel and laboratory resources, and the
desired geographic/demographic variation of the potential subject populations.
Three geographically separated clinical study sites participated in the clinical evaluation
of the FilmArray RP system. The study sites were located in the Southeast (Charleston,
SC), the Southwest (Dallas, TX), and the Midwest (Detroit, MI). The size of the
population in these locations ranges from approximately 107,000 in Charleston, SC to
approximately 1.2 million in Dallas TX (source: U.S. Census Bureau). Each study
location was representative of the intended use setting (clinical laboratories) and testing
was performed by trained clinical laboratory personnel.
The study sites enrolled subjects from diverse demographic groups. Site 1 enrolled
subjects from an adult emergency department. Site 2 enrolled primarily children from
the emergency department, but also enrolled immunocompromised adults from an
outpatient bone marrow transplant clinic (approximately 10% of the enrolled subjects at
this site). Site 3 enrolled subjects from a pediatric emergency department and associated
urgent care clinic.

A total of 1144 subjects were initially enrolled in the prospective study. Eight hundred
fifty seven (857) subjects were initially enrolled in the 2009/2010 respiratory season
and 4 (3 at Site 1 and 1 at Site 3) were withdrawn. Another 287 subjects were enrolled
in the 2010/2011 respiratory season and 20 specimens from Site 2 were excluded from
data analysis due to improper specimen storage prior to testing. Three (3) specimens
from Site 3 were without valid external control mix results acquired (a clinical protocol
deviation), and therefore excluded from data analysis.
The following table provides a summary of demographic information for the 1117
subjects that participated in the combined prospective study (2009/2010 respiratory

All specimens used in the study were prospectively collected from subjects have
signs/symptoms of respiratory infection including but not limited to fever, cough, sore
throat, runny/stuffy nose, myalgia, earache, headache, chills, or fatigue. The subject
may or may not have had respiratory infection testing ordered by a physician. Written
informed consent was acquired from each subject and/or their parent/guardian (if under
18) at the time of enrollment into the prospective study. After informed consent was
acquired, the subject was assigned a Volunteer Identification Number (VIN). The VIN
was used to de-identify the specimen used for FilmArray testing and to provide data to
the sponsor. A key that connected the subject’s identity to their assigned VIN was
maintained in a secure location at each site in order to facilitate the tracking of standard
of care testing and for monitoring purposes. Access to this key was limited to the study
coordinator or laboratory supervisor at each site. At the time of enrollment the
following information was recorded on the Case Report Form (CRF): 1) Age and sex;
2) Information about their suspected respiratory infection, i.e. signs and symptoms, date
of onset; and 3) Current medications (self-reported and/or collected from medical
records).
Two respiratory specimens were collected from each enrolled subject. One specimen
(NPS or other standard specimen type, such as nasal aspirate/wash, used by the study
site) was used for standard of care testing and for viral culture to detect seven common
respiratory viruses (Adenovirus, Flu A, Flu B, PIV1, 2, and 3, and RSV). A frozen
aliquot of viral culture material was prepared for comparator PCR/sequencing testing.
The second specimen, a NPS in 3 mL of viral transport media (VTM) was used for
FilmArray testing according to the Instructions For Use and was aliquoted and frozen
for further comparator PCR/sequencing testing. Individual specimens were delinked
from all patient identifiers and given a study sample code.
Reference and comparator methods used to assess the performance of the FilmArray RP
system include viral culture followed by fluorescent antibody identification for common
viruses (Adenovirus, Flu A, Flu B, PIV1, PIV2, PIV3, and RSV), viral culture followed
by 1 analytically validated PCR assay with bi-directional sequence confirmation (Flu A
subtyping and PIV4), and a composite comparator method of 2 analytically validated
PCR assays with bi-directional sequence confirmation (all other panel analytes):

Viral culture was performed with fresh specimens using standard methods. Sites 1 and 3
used R-Mix shell vial culture format (mixed monolayer of human adenocarcinoma
A549 cells and mink lung Mv1Lu cells) incubated for up to 72 hours. Site 2 used
traditional cell culture format, employing three separately inoculated cell lines (primary
rhesus monkey kidney pRhMK cells, human epidermoid carcinoma Hep-2 cells, and
human lung fibroblast MRC5 cells) incubated for up to 14 days. Each site confirmed
the presence or absence of the viruses (Adenovirus, Flu A, Flu B, PIV1, PIV2, PIV3,
and RSV) using a FDA-cleared direct fluorescent antibody method (D3 Ultra Viral
Respiratory Screening and ID Kit; Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc.).
Frozen aliquots of viral culture material and NPS specimens were shipped to ITI on a
weekly basis for comparator PCR/sequencing testing. PCR testing was performed by
ITI research associates in a blinded manner; specimens were labeled only with the
subject’s VIN and the FilmArray results were not available to them. A bi-directional
sequencing result for each comparator PCR positive result was required to demonstrate
sequence identity with the target organism. All comparator PCR assays were designed
at ITI to provide adequate amplicon length for sequencing while still being able to
detect the organisms of interest. The assays were also designed to amplify a different
sequence from that amplified by the FilmArray assay(s). None of the comparator PCR
assays overlapped any FilmArray amplicon sequence even if the same gene was
targeted. PCR plates containing potentially positive amplicons were not opened at ITI;
they were sent directly to the contract sequencing laboratory, for ExoSAP clean up and
bi-directional sequencing. Sequencing results that met acceptance criteria (i.e. a
minimum of 99% accuracy for at least 90% of the sequence, Phred quality score of 20
or higher) were recorded as positive for the specific analyte.
Performance of the FilmArray RP system detecting Adenovirus, Flu A, Flu B, PIV1,
PIV2, PIV3, or RSV, respectively, was compared to viral culture followed by
fluorescent antibody identification. “True” Adenovirus, Influenza A, Influenza B,
Parainfluenza Virus 1, Parainfluenza Virus 2, Parainfluenza Virus 3, or RSV positives,
respectively, were considered as any sample that was tested positive for Adenovirus,
Influenza A, Influenza B, Parainfluenza Virus 1, Parainfluenza Virus 2, Parainfluenza
Virus 3, or RSV, respectively, by viral culture followed by DFA testing. “True”
Adenovirus, Influenza A, Influenza B, Parainfluenza Virus 1, Parainfluenza Virus 2,
Parainfluenza Virus 3, or RSV negatives, respectively, were considered as any sample
that was tested negative for Adenovirus, Influenza A, Influenza B, Parainfluenza Virus
1, Parainfluenza Virus 2, Parainfluenza Virus 3, or RSV, respectively, by viral culture
followed by DFA testing.

comparator assays were designed to amplify a different sequence from that amplified by
the FilmArray assay(s). None of the comparator PCR assays overlapped any FilmArray
amplicon sequence even if the same gene was targeted. “True” Influenza A/H1, A/H3,
A/2009 H1N1 positives, respectively, were considered as any sample that was tested
positive for Influenza A by viral culture, and had bi-directional sequencing data
meeting pre-defined quality acceptance criteria that matched Influenza A/H1, A/H3, or
A/2009 H1N1 sequences deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) GenBank database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), respectively, with
acceptable E-values. “True” Influenza A/H1, A/H3, or A/2009 H1N1 negatives,
respectively, were considered as any sample that was tested negative for Influenza A by
viral culture, or any sample that was tested positive for Influenza A virus by viral
culture, but was tested negative by the respective Influenza A subtype specific PCR
assay. “True” Parainfluenza Virus 4 positives were considered as any sample for which
bi-directional sequencing data meeting pre-defined quality acceptance criteria that
matched Parainfluenza Virus 4 sequences deposited in the NCBI Genbank database
with acceptable E-values was obtained from testing of viral culture material. “True”
Parainfluenza Virus 4 negatives were considered as any sample where testing of viral
culture material with a Parainfluenza Virus 4 specific PCR assay was negative.
The E-value ranges generated from the clinical trial per organism were presented in the
following table:
Organism E-value Low E-value High
FluA/H1 subtyping NA NA

Performance of the FilmArray RP system detecting Human Rhinovirus, Enterovirus,
Coronavirus NL63, Coronavirus HKU1, or Human Metapneumovirus, respectively, was
compared to a predetermined algorithm that used composite comparator methods. The
composite reference methods consist of 2 analytically validated PCR assays followed
by bi-directional genetic sequencing. The comparator assays were designed to amplify
a different sequence from that amplified by the FilmArray assay(s). None of the
comparator PCR assays overlapped any FilmArray amplicon sequence even if the same
gene was targeted. “True” Human Rhinovirus, Enterovirus, Coronavirus NL63,
Coronavirus HKU1, or Human Metapneumovirus positives, respectively, were
considered as any sample that had bi-directional sequencing data meeting pre-defined
quality acceptance criteria that matched Human Rhinovirus, Enterovirus, Coronavirus
NL63, Coronavirus HKU1, or Human Metapneumovirus sequences deposited in the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank database
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), respectively, with acceptable E-values. “True” Human
Rhinovirus, Enterovirus, Coronavirus NL63, Coronavirus HKU1, or Human
Metapneumovirus negatives, respectively, were considered as any sample that was
tested negative by both of the comparator PCR assays. The E-value ranges generated
from the clinical trial per organism were presented in the following table:

The E-Value from NCBI BLAST Alignment indicates the statistical significance of a
given pair-wise alignment and reflects the size of the database and the scoring system
used. The lower is the E-Value, the more significant is the match. A sequence
alignment that has an E-Value of 1e-3 means that this similarity has a 1 in 1000 chance
of occurring by chance alone.

Influenza A/H1, Influenza A/H3, Influenza A/2009 H1N1, Human Rhinovirus, Enterovirus, Coronavirus
NL63, Coronavirus HKU1, Human Metapneumovirus, or Parainfluenza Virus 3 were evaluated and
established during the first phase of the prospective clinical study (data from a total of 853 subjects from
the 2009/2010 respiratory season). Performance of the FilmArray RP system detecting Parainfluenza
Virus 1, Parainfluenza Virus 2, or Parainfluenza Virus 4 were evaluated during the first and the second
phases of the prospective clinical study (combined data of a total of 1117 subjects - a total of 853 subjects
from the 2009/2010 respiratory season and a total of 264 subjects from the 2010/2011 respiratory
season). During the second phase of the prospective clinical study (2010/2011 respiratory season), only
the reference/comparator methods for Parainfluenza Virus 1, Parainfluenza Virus 2, and Parainfluenza
Virus 4 were performed on all specimens and used to calculate the performance.

Prospective Clinical Study FilmArray Software and Instrument, and Pouch
Controls Performance Analysis
A total of 1117 prospective clinical specimens were tested and analyzed during the first
phase and the second phase of the prospective clinical evaluation (2009/2010
respiratory season and 2010/2011 respiratory season). Of the 1117 analyzed prospective
clinical specimens, 94.6% (1057/1117) of these specimens yielded valid results on the
first attempt (i.e. first loaded pouch). Invalid results or no results were obtained for the
remaining 60 (5.4%) specimens (no results for 24 specimens due to incomplete runs; 36
specimens were “invalid” due to Pouch Control failures). Of the 24 incomplete runs, 3
were aborted by users (0.3%); 6 were due to software-related errors (0.6%) and 15 were
due to instrument errors (1.3%). Fifty-seven (57) of the 60 initially failed (no results or
invalid) specimens yielded valid results after a single retest using a new pouch/sample.
The remaining three (3) specimens failed on the second attempt (2 due to failed Pouch
Controls, 1 due to an instrument error), but yielded valid results following a second
retest using another pouch/sample.

Prospective Clinical Study FilmArray Pouch Performance Analysis
The FilmArray RP pouch is manufactured to contain a vacuum that draws in the
required amount of Hydration Solution and Sample/Buffer Mix when the seals are
broken by the cannula-tipped syringes in each of the pouch ports. If either the
Hydration Solution or the Sample/Buffer Mix is not drawn into the pouch, the operator
is instructed to discard the faulty pouch and obtain a new pouch to test the specimen.
Out of 1281 pouches used in the first phase of the prospective clinical evaluation
(2009/2010 respiratory season), thirty-seven (37) (37/1281; 2.9%) failed to draw
Hydration Solution or Sample/Buffer Mix. However, the majority (31/37) of these
failures occurred early in the evaluation (December 2009 through early February 2010).

Out of 521 pouches used in the second phase of the prospective clinical study
(2010/2011 respiratory season), ten (10) (10/521; 1.9%) failed to draw Hydration
Solution or Sample/Buffer Mix. It has been observed that an operator can partially
break a port seal, leading to loss of vacuum and failure to draw the solution. It may also
be possible for a pouch to be manufactured with a faulty port seal or reduced vacuum.
A decrease in the rate of this failure type over time suggested that either pouch
manufacturing improved or the operators became more adept at reliably puncturing the
port seals.
During the first phase of the prospective clinical evaluation, one operator observed a
leak in a pouch when it was removed from the instrument after testing (1/1244 loaded
pouches = 0.08% failure rate). The pouches are manufactured from durable materials
able to withstand the manipulations performed by the instrument; however, an
occasional small rupture or tear may occur. Following discovery of the pouch leak, the
operator followed recommended decontamination procedures and performed
contamination surveillance swab testing of the area surrounding the instrument. No
contamination was detected. No pouch leaks were observed in the second phase of the
prospective clinical study.
Prospective Clinical Study External Controls Performance Analysis
Four (4) frozen (-70°C) control mixes were provided to the study sites for daily testing
during the first phase of the prospective clinical study (2009/2010 respiratory season).
Three control mixes contained pooled NPS specimens spiked with whole virus with
some plasmid DNA for hard to acquire organisms. Combined, the 3 mixes covered all
panel analytes. A fourth mix was negative for all panel members and only contained
pooled NPS:
Control Mix 1 Control Mix 2 Control Mix 3 Control Mix 4
Coronavirus HKU1 Adenovirus Influenza A/2009 H1N1
Enterovirus Coronavirus NL63 Respiratory Syncytial Virus
Negative for all
Influenza B Rhinovirus Parainfluenza Virus 2

Parainfluenza Virus 1 Human Metapneumovirus Parainfluenza Virus 4
Influenza A/H3
Parainfluenza Virus 3
The operators were required to complete a valid control mix run (correct results
obtained) prior to beginning patient sample testing on each testing day. A total of 300
control mix runs were attempted during the first phase of the prospective clinical study
(2009/2010 respiratory season). Seventeen (17) runs did not complete and 6 runs had
failed pouch control(s). Of the remaining 277 runs (site 1, 99 runs; site 2, 70 runs; and
site 3,108 runs), 7 (site 1, 1 run; site 2, 2 runs; and site 3, 4 runs) (7/277; 2.5%) did not
return the correct organism results either due to the detection of an extra analyte (4/7)
and/or the failure to detect one or more spiked analytes (4/7). These failures may be due
to low level virus from the NPS donors, introduction of contamination during the
preparation or testing of the samples, or improper handling of the frozen aliquots.
Four external controls were used by study sites for daily testing during the second phase
of the prospective clinical study (2010/2011 respiratory season). Three of the controls
were freeze-dried, room-temperature stable, synthetic RNA mixes that were rehydrated

with Hydration Solution prior to being tested. Synthetic RNA mixes were used in the
second phase of the clinical study due to several more organisms becoming difficult to
obtain in the concentrations necessary for high volume external control testing. Instead
of including more plasmids in the control mixes, validated synthetic RNA mixes were
used. The RNA mixes are designed to test all assays in the pouch for each of the
analytes. Combined, these 3 mixes cover all analyte assays in the pouch. The fourth
control consisted of Hydration Solution alone (Negative):

The operators were required to complete a valid control mix run (correct results
obtained) prior to beginning patient sample testing on each testing day. A total of 137
control mix runs were attempted during the second phase of the prospective clinical
study (2010/2011 respiratory season). Seventeen (17) runs did not complete and 3 had
failed pouch control(s). Of the remaining 117 runs (site 2, 61 runs; and site 3,56 runs),
14 (site 2, 6 runs; and site 3, 8 runs) (14/117; 12.0%) did not return the correct organism
results either due to the detection of an extra analyte (1/14) and/or the failure to detect
one or more spiked analytes (13/14). These failures may be due to introduction of
contamination during the preparation or testing of the samples, improper/incomplete
rehydration of the control mixes, or introduction of RNases into the synthetic RNA
control mixes during rehydration.
Prospective Clinical Study Environmental Contamination Surveillance Analysis
The FilmArray RP system is a closed system; all steps require no user manipulation.
This dramatically reduces the possibility of contamination from environmental material
or amplicon during the testing process. However, it is still possible for contaminants to
be introduced during pouch loading. To determine if environmental contamination of
workstations might interfere with the accuracy of test results, during the first phase of
the prospective clinical study, FilmArray operators were instructed to perform
contamination surveillance swab testing at least weekly and following any pouch leaks.
Forty (40) total swab test runs were attempted; 35 of the runs completed and the
controls passed. No contamination was detected in any of the swab tests indicating that
the routine cleaning procedures recommended in the clinical trial protocol are sufficient
to prevent false positive test results caused by environmental contamination of
workstations used for preparing pouches. These routine cleaning procedures were
recommended in the package insert.

The FilmArray RP system detected a total of 86 mixed infections in the first phase of
the prospective clinical evaluation perform from December 2009 to May 2010 (853
tested and analyzed specimens). This represents 17.0% of the total positive
specimens (86/506). Eighty-one (81/86; 94.2%) were double infections, and 5 (5/86;
5.8%) were triple infections. The total number of test results comprising these co-
infections was 177. The single most common co-infection (21/86; 24.4%) was
Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus with Respiratory Syncytial Virus. These viruses were
the most prevalent in the tested population. Out of the 86 co-infections, 55 contained
one or more analytes that had not been detected with the reference/comparator
methods, i.e. discrepant co-infection.

Retrospective Clinical Study
A retrospective clinical evaluation of the FilmArray RP system was performed at ITI to
supplement the prospective evaluation data. In this study, retrospective pre-selected
archived specimens were further validated/confirmed by PCR/sequencing analysis, and
then tested with the FilmArray RP system. Samples for this study included 420
retrospective pre-selected archived specimens. Most specimens had previous positive
test results for selected organisms of interest from the source sites. Several negative
specimens (as determined at the source sites) were also included in the retrospective
sample set.
These retrospective archived samples were characterized previously at the source sites
using a variety of methods including DSFA, viral culture followed by DFA, Luminex
X-TAG RVP, and LDT PCR assays. Upon arrival at ITI, a 4-digit study number (VIN)
was assigned to each sample and a key was created in order to group samples together
into panels by organism. The organism panel was randomized such that the users testing
the samples with the FilmArray RP were blinded as to the expected test result.
Specimens were organized into “test panels” such that specimens positive for a
particular analyte could serve as a negative for another analyte, allowing for
calculations of negative percent agreement (NPA). Additional negative specimens were
also included in each panel. There were 4 different panels in total, labeled 4 through 7,
as indicated in the following table:
Panel # Organisms Number of Samples
Influenza A/H1, A/H3, A/2009
4 178
H1N1, Influenza B, and Negatives
Parainfluenza Viruses 1, 2, 3
5 148
Enterovirus, and Negatives
6 Adenovirus and Negatives 74
7 Parainfluenza Virus 4 and Negatives 20
Because it is possible that the provided samples had been misidentified, had degraded
during storage or contained additional pathogens (such as Rhinovirus) not identified by
the source laboratory, the presence of the expected analyte or the absence of the
analytes was confirmed using analytically validated “validation” PCR assays for the
analytes in the specific panel. (Note that while some validation assays share the same
gene target as the FilmArray RP panel, they targeted different regions of the gene).
Positive PCR reactions were then subjected to bi-directional sequencing for definitive
confirmation. “True” organism positives were considered as any sample that had bi-
directional sequencing data meeting pre-defined quality acceptance criteria that
matched the particular organism sequences deposited in the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), with

PIV-4 1.7E-157 2.7E-148
If this “validation” testing did not confirm the presence of the expected organism in the
sample, it was not analyzed further as this result may have reflected that the sample had
been improperly labeled or handled. If additional pathogens were identified in the
sample (those not identified by the source laboratory), the samples was also omitted
from the analysis for that specific analyte. The expected result (positive for reported
organism, or negative for presumed negative specimens) was confirmed for 367 of 420
specimens using “validation” PCR assays and sequencing (the identity of 53 specimens
could not be confirmed). Data collected from “validation” PCR assays showed that
specimens contained a broad range of analyte concentrations for all organisms tested
(based on Cp value distribution).
Validated/confirmed specimens were then analyzed on the FilmArray RP. The identity
of the specimens was unknown to the FilmArray operators. If a FilmArray error was
encountered or if a pouch failed, residual NPS specimen (when available) was used to
retest the sample. Out of 367 analyzed specimens, 2 specimens (VIN 6-052 and VIN 6-
068) failed due to instrument and software errors, and 3 specimens (VIN 4-037, VIN 4-
058 and VIN 7-018) failed due to pouch sample control failures. They were excluded
from data analysis due to insufficient volumes to retest these specimens.

* It was found that two negative specimens were positive for Adenovirus (VINs 6-025 & 6-032).
Because there was no previous test for Adenovirus on these particular specimens, the Adenovirus
PCR result was not investigated by sequencing and the Adenovirus status of these specimens was not
included in the FilmArray RP percent agreement analysis for Adenovirus. Two specimens were lost
due to incomplete FilmArray runs resulting from instrument and software errors (VINs 6-052 and 6-
068), and there was insufficient volume of either sample to repeat the test, therefore it was omitted
from further analysis.

Retrospective Clinical Study Software and Instrument, and Pouch Controls
Performance Analysis
A total of 367 retrospective clinical specimens were tested and analyzed during the
retrospective clinical evaluation. Of the 367 analyzed retrospective clinical specimens,
92.9% (341/367) of these specimens yielded valid results on the first attempt (i.e., first
loaded pouch). Invalid results or no results were obtained for the remaining 26 (7.1%)
specimens on the first attempt (no results for 7 specimens due to incomplete runs; 19
specimens were “invalid” due to Pouch Controls failures). Of the 7 incomplete runs, 6
were due to software-related errors (1.6%) and 1 was due to an instrument error (0.3%).
Eighteen (18) of the 26 initially failed (no results or invalid) specimens yielded valid
results after a single retest using a new pouch/sample. Two (2) specimens required two
retests and one (1) specimen required three retests using new pouches/samples to obtain
valid results. Five (5) could not be re-tested due to insufficient specimen volume and
were excluded from further data analysis.

a One run was aborted by the user, but the run was re-started using the same pouch.
b Three (3) additional valve controller errors were encountered, but the user was able to re-start the run.
c Known failure mode in the instrument bladder system. A new bladder material has been implemented to reduce this error mode.
d Twenty-three (23) camera communications errors occurred; however, valid results were obtained by restarting the test using the same
pouch.
e Known failure mode caused by a communication timing error between the FilmArray software and the driver of the instrument camera.
This error mode was eliminated in software version 1.1. (Validation study of a total of 872 runs using software version 1.1 demonstrated
0% error rate caused by this particular error mode.)
f Two (2) additional instrument errors occurred (instrument communication error); however, valid results were obtained by restarting the
test using the same pouch.

a Investigation into the higher than expected rate of RNA process controls revealed that the QC process used to control the amount of
control template was inadequate. The QC process has been revised to better control the concentration of control template.

N. Instrument Name:
FilmArray Instrument.
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The FilmArray instrument interacts with the FilmArray pouch mechanically, thermally,
and optically to drive a multi-step chemical process designed to detect specific nucleic
acid targets using multiplex nested PCR followed by DNA melting analysis. The
instrument follows a protocol that is defined by a set of codes that are downloaded from
the host computer at runtime. The instrument protocol defines the specific timing and
sequence parameters as the instrument performs the following key functions:
• Perform cell disruption using the bead beater
• Extract nucleic acid from the disrupted sample
• Perform stage 1 PCR thermocycling of multiplexed PCR reaction
• Perform stage 2 PCR thermocycling of the array
• Execute a DNA melt and detect fluorescent signals generated

5. Calibration:

6. Quality Control:
The FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) pouch contains two internal control assays:
1. The RNA Process Control targets an mRNA of the yeast, Schizosaccharomyces
pombe. During FilmArray RP pouch manufacture, whole yeast are freeze-dried into
the sample injection port of each pouch. When the test specimen is loaded into the
pouch, S. pombe is rehydrated and enters the pouch with the specimen. The yeast
nucleic acid is extracted, purified and tested simultaneously with nucleic acids from
the patient specimen. A positive result for the processing control indicates that all
steps in the process (nucleic acid extraction, reverse transcription, PCR, melt,
detection, and analysis) are functioning properly.
2. The second stage PCR (PCR2) control assay detects a synthetic DNA template that
is dried into triplicate wells of the array along with the corresponding primers. A
positive result indicates that PCR2 was successful.
The RNA Process Control and the PCR2 Control assays are used to Pass or Fail each
FilmArray RP pouch run. This combination of control assays monitors each of the
critical mechanical and chemical processes that occur in a pouch run, while limiting the
possibility of random control assay failures that could contribute to unnecessary pouch
failures.
Good laboratory practice recommends running external positive and negative controls
regularly. Use viral transport medium as the external Negative Control, and previously
characterized positive samples or negative sample spiked with well characterized target
organisms as external Positive Controls. External controls should be used in accordance
with local, state, federal accrediting organizations, as applicable.
