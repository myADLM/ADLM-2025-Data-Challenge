L. Test Principle:
ELITech Clinical Systems BILIRUBIN TOTAL 4+1
In the presence of cetrimide, conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin react with
diazotized sulfanilic acid to form azobilirubin. Determination of total bilirubin
according to the following reactions:
Sulfanilic acid reacts with NaNO2 to form Diazotized sulfanilic acid;
Bilirubin then reacts with Diazotized sulfanilic acid to form Azobilirubin
ELITech Clinical Systems BILIRUBIN DIRECT 4+1
In the absence of cetrimide, only conjugated bilirubin reacts with diazotized sulfanilic
acid to form azobilirubin. Determination of direct bilirubin according to the
following reactions:
Sulfanilic acid reacts with NaNO2 to form Diazotized sulfanilic acid;
Conjugated bilirubin then reacts with Diazotized sulfanilic acid to form Azobilirubin
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated with one serum control material, one natural human
serum sample, and one spiked human serum pool sample. Within-run and
total precision results were obtained by performing two runs per day, two
measures per run, for twenty days according to CLSI protocol EP5-A2 using

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
For total bilirubin assay:
A linearity study of the total bilirubin assay was performed according to the
CLSI EP6-A guideline. Two pools of patient serum samples were prepared to
obtain one high and one low concentration of serum pools. A high sample
was obtained by spiking the serum pool to obtain a high concentration of a
sample pool (20.22 mg/dL). A low sample pool was prepared by diluting a
low sample pool with buffered saline to obtain a low concentration of a
sample pool (0.28 mg/dL). Using the high and low pooled samples, eleven
levels of inter-mixtures were prepared according to the CLSI EP6-A
guideline. All samples were assayed in triplicate. Data was analyzed using 1st,
2nd, and 3rd order least square regressions. A first order linear regression was
generated as follows:
Y=1.0074X - 0.04, r = 0.9997
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claim that the total bilirubin
assay has a measuring range of 0.28 to 20.22 mg/dL.
Dilution study:
The sponsor performed a 1:5 manual dilution study with 10 spiked samples
using saline as the diluent. Ten samples with total bilirubin concentrations
between 16.5 to 98.9 mg/dL were diluted 1:5. The % recovery between the
expected values and observed values are within 10%. Therefore, the sponsor
claimed that sample with total bilirubin concentration greater than the upper
10

claimed measuring range (20.22 mg/dL) can be diluted manually 1:5 with
saline.
For direct bilirubin assay:
A linearity study of the direct bilirubin assay was performed according to the
CLSI EP6-A guideline. Two pools of patient serum samples were prepared to
obtain one high and one low concentration of serum pools. A high sample
was obtained by spiking the serum pool to obtain a high concentration of a
sample pool (6.82 mg/dL). A low sample pool was prepared by diluting a low
sample pool with buffered saline to obtain a low concentration of a sample
pool (0.18 mg/dL). Using the high and low pooled samples, eleven levels of
inter-mixtures were prepared according to the CLSI EP6-A guideline. All
samples were assayed in triplicate. Data was analyzed using 1st, 2nd, and 3rd
order least square regressions. A first order linear regression was generated as
follows:
Y=1.0293X - 0.0259, r = 0.9992
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claim that the total bilirubin
assay has a measuring range of 0.18 to 6.82 mg/dL.
Dilution study:
The sponsor performed a 1:5 manual dilution study with 10 spiked samples
using saline as the diluent. Ten samples with direct bilirubin concentrations
between 5.4 to 32.3 mg/dL were diluted 1:5. The % recovery between the
expected values and observed values are within 10%. Therefore, the sponsor
claimed that sample with direct bilirubin concentration greater than the upper
claimed measuring range (6.82 mg/dL) can be diluted manually 1:5 with
saline.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
ELICAL 2 calibrator for total bilirubin and direct bilirubin is purchased from
a commercially available source and relabeled (previously cleared in
k033501) and is traceable to a NIST traceable material, SRM 916a.
ELICAL 2 calibrator is value assigned using multiple runs on two Selectra Pro
M analyzers. The target value of ELICAL 2 calibrator is the mean of the
observed values range. After validation of the target value, a confidence range
(high and low values) is calculated. On-board calibration stability is 28 days
for both total and direct bilirubin assays. Reconstituted calibrator stability for
both analytes has been verified for the following temperatures and time limits.
For total bilirubin: 6 hrs. at 15-25° C, 1 day at 2-8° C, 2 weeks at -15° C and -
25° C. For direct bilirubin: 3 hrs. at 15-25° C, 8 hrs. at 2-8° C, 2 weeks at -
15° C and -25° C.

Control material was purchased from commercially available sources and
relabeled (previously cleared in k041227). ELITROL I and II control
solutions are value assigned using two Selectra Pro M analyzers. Each sample
is tested in triplicate over several days. The target value of Level I and II are
the median of the observed values range. After validation of the target value, a
confidence range (high and low values) is calculated. Reconstituted control
stability for both analytes has been verified for the following temperatures and
time limits. For total bilirubin: 8 hrs. at 15-25° C, 1 day at 2-8° C, 2 weeks at
-15° C and -25° C. For direct bilirubin: 4hrs. at 15-25° C, 8 hrs. at 2-8° C, 2
weeks at -15° C and -25° C.
Reagent stability for the total bilirubin and direct bilirubin were evaluated on
one Selectra analyzer with one lot of reagent using 4 controls and a linearity
set for each measurand. Real-time stability study of the reagents supports
shelf-life claims of 18 months when stored at 2 to 8oC. On board stability are
28 days for total and direct bilirubin. Protocol and acceptance criteria are
found to be acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
The Limits of Blank (LoB), Detection (LoD) and Quantitation (LoQ) studies
were conducted following CLSI EP17-A for total bilirubin and direct
bilirubin. Two Selectra Pro M analyzers and two lots of the respective
reagents were used. The LoBs were determined by analyzing a blank sample
60 times. The LoD and LoQ studies each used 4 serum pools (each measured
15 times) for the individual assays with a total of 60 measurements. The
serum pools for the LoD had concentrations of the individual measurand
approximately 4 times the LoB. LoQs were determined by analyzing 4
serum pools near the expected LoQ. Results are summarized below:
Assay LoB LoD LoQ
Total bilirubin 0.04 mg/dL 0.06 mg/dL 0.17 mg/dL
Direct bilirubin 0.04 mg/dL 0.06 mg/dL 0.17 mg/dL
The total bilirubin assay has a measuring range of 0.28 to 20.22 mg/dL.
The direct bilirubin assay has a measuring range of 0.18 to 6.82 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Testing for interfering substances was based on CLSI EP-7A for both total
bilirubin and direct bilirubin assay. Testing was performed on various
different concentrations for each interfering substances. Samples with
increasing amounts of triglycerides, hemoglobin, acetaminophen,
acetylsalicylic, and ascorbic acid were tested in triplicate and compared to the

same sample without the interfering substances. The sponsor defined non-
significant interference as the highest level tested that does not cause >10%
change between the tested samples and the control sample. Results are
summarized in the tables below:
For total bilirubin assay: Two levels of analytes concentrations were tested
(1.0 and 15.0 mg/dL)
Highest concentration tested
showing non-significant
interference (mg/dL)
Triglyceride 2779
Hemoglobin 500
Acetaminophen 30
Acetylsalicylic acid 200
Ascorbic Acid 2.0
For direct bilirubin assay: Two levels of analytes concentrations were tested
(0.5 and 4.5 mg/dL)
Highest concentration tested
showing non-significant
interference (mg/dL)
Triglyceride 2106
Hemoglobin 125
Acetaminophen 30
Acetylsalicylic acid 200
Ascorbic Acid 0.3
Based on the interference study data, the sponsor has the following limitations
in the labeling:
For total bilirubin assay:
Ascorbic acid concentrations greater than 2.0 mg/dL cause falsely elevated
total bilirubin results.
For direct bilirubin assay:
Ascorbic acid concentrations greater than 0.3 mg/dL cause falsely elevated
total bilirubin results.
Specimen requirement: Serum, free of hemolysis.
