L. Test Principle:
The eSensor® Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test uses an electrochemical detection
based microarray method for determining the genotype of a defined panel of
polymorphisms from purified genomic DNA isolated from human saliva. This
method was cleared under k073720 using gDNA from blood as the sample type. In
the process, regions of the genome containing the polymorphisms of interest are
amplified by PCR, and the resulting double stranded PCR amplicons are digested
with exonuclease lambda to generate single stranded target DNA which is then mixed
with a hybridization solution containing a pair of allele-specific oligonucleotide
signal probes for each polymorphism. Each signal probe within the pair is labeled
with a genotype-specific ferrocene derivative.
The mixture of amplified target DNA sample and signal buffer is loaded onto a test
cartridge containing single-stranded oligonucleotide capture probes that are
covalently bound to gold-plated electrodes. The cartridge is then inserted into the XT-
8 Instrument. During the hybridization in the XT-8 Instrument, each target DNA
binds to a capture probe. Each pair of working electrodes on the array contains a
different capture probe.
The signal and capture probes are designed with sequences complementary to
immediately adjacent regions on the corresponding target DNA sequence and so both
signal and capture probes bind to complementary sequences on the target DNA. In
this manner, a three-member complex is formed among capture probe, target, and
signal probe based on sequence-specific hybridization. This process brings the end of
the signal probe containing electrochemically active ferrocene labels into close
proximity to the electrode surface.
Hybridization of the three-member complex at the electrode surface and subsequent
application of an excitation voltage causes the ferrous ion in each ferrocene group to
undergo cyclic oxidation and reduction at its characteristic redox potential, leading to
loss or gain of an electron, and the generation of an alternating current at the electrode
surface that is measured using voltammetry. Higher-order harmonic signal analysis
also facilitates discrimination of ferrocene-dependent faradaic current from
background capacitive current. Signals from the ferrocene labels are detected and
measured by instrument software, and the ratio of signals from the different labels
allows identification of genotype. Genotyping boundaries and signal threshold for
each polymorphism are pre-programmed into instrument software, and genotypes are
called by comparison of the signal ratio observed for an unknown sample to the SNP-
specific genotyping boundaries and signal threshold. Sequential analysis of each
electrode allows genotyping of multiple mutations or polymorphisms.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Performance of DNA from saliva samples collected by the Oragene Dx
collection devices on the eSensor® Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test in two
reproducibility studies was demonstrated.
1. Device reproducibility using prepared sample panel: a study was
performed to evaluate the reproducibility of the performance of the
Oragene∙Dx device (OGD-500 format, k110701) with the GenMark
Diagnostics eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test across multiple sites and
operators.
Ten donors self-collected six saliva samples each (two samples per lot x three
lots of OGD-500). Two samples collected using the same OGD-500 lot were
pooled to generate three samples per donor. Triplicate aliquots of each sample
from each donor were provided to four operators at three sites for DNA
extraction (purification)1. Site 2 and 3 each had one operator and Site 1
(internal) had two operators for a study total of four operators.
All purified genomic DNA samples were tested for concentration and
A /A ratio at a single external DNA Testing Site, Site 3. The eSensor
260 280
Warfarin Sensitivity Testing was performed by the same four operators at the
three sites where DNA extraction was also performed.

collection, processing and testing procedure. Samples were directly shipped
from donors to investigational sites for analysis of DNA concentration,
A /A ratio and eSensor® Warfarin Sensitivity Test genotyping. Donors
260 280
were selected based on their naivety to the saliva collection device; all donors
had used the product at most once previously.

The study was conducted at three sites: one internal site and two external
clinical laboratories. Donors (n=15) were each shipped four OGD-500
devices. Each donor was asked to provide four samples: one sample was sent
directly by the donors to each of the three sites. (One sample was sent to DNA
Genotek for remediation purposes if needed.) Each operator extracted one
aliquot of DNA from each saliva sample they received and determined the
DNA concentration and A /A ratio using their laboratory’s standard
260 280
procedures, prior to testing the sample on the eSensor® Warfarin Sensitivity
Test. devices were shipped to 15 donors. One donor did not return any of their
samples and thus was excluded from the study. 14 samples were tested once at
each site for a study total of 42 samples.

1 This sample, F3, was tested twice (also incorrect in re-testing table below),
and both times the results were “low signal for all polymorphisms”. The
sample was cloudy suggesting that it was compromised. A new sample was
obtained from the donor, tested, and a correct result was obtained.
2 Upon sequencing the reference sample for Donor S it was determined that
this donor had an interfering mutation at the site adjacent to the 2C9*2
mutation: 429C>T. This mutation is described in the literature and is known to
impact genotyping results. The patient’s *2 genotype is heterozygous at *2 as
determined by sequencing but the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva test
result was homozygous for *2. This limitation is stated in the GenMark
Diagnostics eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test package insert.

See k073720.
d. Detection limit:
The recommended input for the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test is 10
ng of genomic DNA (5 µL of 2 ng/µL genomic DNA sample). All four
formats of the Oragene•Dx collection device provide genomic DNA with
sufficient DNA yield and concentration for the genotyping test (e.g., for the
OGD-500 model in the sample volume tolerance study of k110701, median
DNA yield was 36.1 μg and median DNA concentration was 42.1 ng/μL).
The same study in k110701 also showed that underfilling the Oragene•Dx
devices by 50% less saliva than recommended provided genomic DNA with
sufficient DNA yield and concentration for the genotyping test (e.g., for the
OGD-500, median DNA yield was 18.0 μg and median DNA concentration
was 26.6 ng/μL).
e. Analytical specificity:
Effect of Endogenous Interfering Substances: Interfering substances including
salivary α-amylase, hemoglobin, immunoglobulin A (IgA) and total protein
were spiked into saliva samples at the highest amounts found in literature. 10
donors provided five saliva samples each which were each spiked with one of
9

Effect of Exogenous Interfering Substances: Potentially interfering exogenous
substances (eating, drinking, chewing gum, using mouthwash and smoking)
introduced into saliva samples through various activities were tested. Each
activity group was composed of five donors who each provided three samples
- a baseline/control sample prior to the activity, and samples collected
immediately after the activity and then 30 minutes after the activity. Three
samples per donor were tested. There was 100% agreement between the
eSensor® Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test results and bidirectional DNA
sequencing for all activities tested in first pass, demonstrating no effect of any
interfering substances on genotyping.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison evaluation was performed in order to determine accuracy
of the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test as compared to bi-directional
DNA sequencing. Testing was conducted at one site only (internal site). The
test panel for the method comparison study consisted of 316 unique human
genomic DNA samples. These samples were isolated from saliva specimens
collected using the Oragene•Dx OGD-500 device followed by DNA
extraction using a manual method using ethanol (this method is provided in
Attachment A of the package insert). The study was performed with six lot of
eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test, two instruments, four operators over
multiple days. The total assay correct call rate is 99.05% and a 95%
confidence lower bound of 97.56%.

c Bi-directional sequencing revealed the sample had a mutation that interfered with the eSensor test. This
rare mutation and its effect on the assay is noted in the limitations section of the package insert.
d Investigation by the sponsor demonstrated that residual ethanol in the sample can lead to an incorrect
call; see below.
During the extraction process, users should ensure that any residual ethanol has been
removed prior to DNA rehydration. Excessive (≥12.5%) carryover of ethanol from the
extracted DNA into the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Saliva Test may result in an
incorrect call, as seen in the method comparison study for two samples.
