L. Test Principle:
ELITech Clinical Systems Albumin
This method involves the binding of albumin with bromocresol green. Bromocresol
green forms a complex with albumin at pH 4.20. The color intensity at 620 nm is
directly proportional to the albumin concentration in the sample.
ELITech Clinical Systems Calcium Arsenazo
This method utilizes Arsenazo III, which has a high affinity for calcium at neutral pH.
Arsenazo III forms in neutral medium a blue complex with calcium. The color
intensity at 600 nm in directly proportional to the total calcium concentration in the
sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Serum -Within run and total precision studies were performed according to
CLSI EP5-A2 for albumin and calcium. Studies were performed by
conducting two runs per day, two measures per run, for 3 levels of samples,
on 2 Selectra ProM instruments for 20 operating days. For albumin, data from
level 1 is from a diluted serum sample, level 2 is from a natural human serum
pool sample, and level 3 is from a spiked human serum pool sample. For
calcium, data from level 1 is from a control serum sample, level 2 is from a
natural human serum pool sample, and level 3 is from a spiked human serum
pool sample. Results are presented in the tables below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Serum-Linearity was evaluated for albumin and calcium according to CLSI
EP6-A by comparing observed versus expected values for 11 equally-spaced
serum samples. Samples were prepared from high and low analyte
concentration serum pools. Each sample was evaluated in triplicate on the
Selectra ProM instrument. Linear regression results from these studies are
found in the table below.

Ranges tested
ALB 0.9648 0.1082 0.9976 0.08 1.55 – 6.08 g/dL
Ca 1.0235 -0.1865 0.9993 0.10 4.96 – 15.39
mg/dL
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claims that albumin assay is
linear across the measuring range of 1.6 – 6.0 g/dL and the calcium assay is
linear across the measuring range of 5.0 – 15.0 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The sponsor claims traceability of albumin and calcium used in the ELICAL 2
calibrator, ELITROL I, and ELITRIOL II to reference materials, ERM-DA
470 and SRM 909b, respectively.

control solutions are tested against predetermined values on the Selectra ProM
analyzer using the albumin and calcium reagents. Value assignment for the
ELICAL 2 calibrator solution was performed by quadruplicate runs on the
Selectra ProM analyzer, using 2 reagent lots, and 3 test vials per lot. Value
assignment for the ELITROL I and ELITRIOL II control solutions was
performed by triplicate runs on the Selectra ProM analyzer, using 2 reagent
lots, and 3 test vials per lot. The mean analyte value is calculated and a target
value is assigned. The labeling states that obtained control solution values
should fall within the specified range provided on lot-specific value sheets and
that laboratories should establish appropriate quality control procedures when
using this product for its intended use. The labeling also states that
laboratories should recalibrate when reagents lots change, when quality
control results fall out of range, and after a maintenance operation.
Stability
Calibrator material is purchased from a commercial vendor (previously
cleared under k033501). The sponsor claimed the following for stability:
ELICAL 2 is stable until the expiration date printed on the label when stored
at 2-8˚C prior to reconstitution. After reconstitution the stability is 8 hours
when stored at 15-25˚C, 2 days at 2-8˚C or 4 weeks (when frozen once) at -
25˚and -15˚C.
Control material is purchased from a commercial vendor (previously cleared
under k041227). The sponsor claimed the following for stability: Before
reconstitution, the shelf-life of the ELITech Clinical Systems Elitrol I and
Elitrol II is 30 months at 2-8˚C. After reconstitution the stability is 12 hours
when stored at 15-25˚C, 5 days when stored at 2-8˚C or 4 weeks (when frozen
once) at -25˚ and -15˚ C.
d. Detection limit:
Serum-Limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of
quantification (LoQ) were determined according to CLSI EP17-A with the
Selectra ProM instrument for calcium and albumin. Testing was conducted
over multiple days, with one run across two instruments, and with two reagent
lots. The results are as follows:

e. Analytical specificity:
Serum-Interference studies were performed according to the CLSI EP7-A2
for albumin and calcium analytes. Different concentrations of potential
interference substances were spiked into pooled patient serum samples. The
sponsor’s definitions of no significant interference is <10% difference
between the tested and the control samples. Two albumin test concentrations:
3.50 g/dL and 5.00 g/dL, and two calcium test concentrations: 8.00 mg/dL and
12.00 mg/dL were used in these studies. There was no significant interference
for albumin and calcium when these analytes and interferents were tested in
the concentration ranges indicated in the table below:
Albumin
Triglycerides (up to 3000 mg/dL)
Unconjugated bilirubin (up to 30.0 mg/dL)
Conjugated bilirubin (up to 29.5 mg/dL)
Hemoglobin (up to 500 mg/dL)
Acetaminophen (up to 30 mg/dL)
Ascorbic acid (up to 20mg/dL)
Acetylsalicylic acid (up to 200 mg/dL)
γ globulin (up to 1500 mg/dL)
Calcium
Triglycerides (up to 1119 mg/dL)
Unconjugated bilirubin (up to 30.0 mg/dL)
Conjugated bilirubin (up to 29.5 mg/dL)
Hemoglobin (up to 500 mg/dL)
Magnesium (up to 10.91 mg/dL)
Acetaminophen (up to 30 mg/dL)
Ascorbic acid (up to 20mg/dL)
Acetylsalicylic acid (up to 200 mg/dL)
Triglyceride concentrations greater than 1119 mg/dL were found to interfere
with calcium measurement. Therefore the sponsor states in their labeling that
a positive bias is observed with triglyceride concentrations above 1119
mg/dL.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Serum and Plasma- Two sets of method comparison studies, serum and
plasma, were performed according to the CLSI EP9-A2 guideline. The serum
study was completed with 100 albumin (10 spiked and 90 unaltered samples)
and 102 calcium human serum samples (9 spiked and 93 unaltered samples)
spanning the linear range of the assay. The plasma study was completed with
(40) lithium heparinized human plasma samples spanning the linear range of
each assay. Each serum and plasma sample was analyzed in singlet using the
Selectra ProM analyzer (test method) and in duplicate on the predicates
(k921625 - Stanbio Calcium LiquiColor reagent on the SIRRUS analyzer and
k063744 - Roche Diagnostics Albumin Gen.2 on the cobas c11 analyzer).
