Quantitation; Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute; 2004.
L. Test Principle:
In the ADVIA® 1650 Chemistry β2-Microglobulin assay, a sample is diluted and
reacted with a buffer that contains latex particles coated with antibody specific for β2-
microglobulin. The formation of the antibody-antigen complex during the reaction
results in an increase in turbidity, the extent of which is measured as the amount of
light adsorbed at 545nm. The β2-microglobulin concentration in a sample is
determined by constructing a standard curve from the absorbance of a reagent blank
and a single-level calibrator.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was conducted in accordance with CLSI document EP5-A2,
Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods;
Approved Guideline. Five samples were used for the study including two β2-
microglobulin-spiked serum pools (i.e., Pool 1 and Pool 2) and three serum-
based liquid controls (i.e., Control 1, Control 2, Control 3) that were prepared
by spiking a pool of serum samples with β2-microglobulin. All samples were
analyzed in duplicate per run with 2 runs per day for 20 days using two
reagent lots and two systems with one operator. The results are summarized
below:

testing nine serum samples with concentrations of β2-microglobulin evenly
distributed throughout the assay range. The series of nine serum samples
were prepared by dilution of a sample with high concentration of β2-
microglobulin (approximately 18.88 mg/L) with a fresh normal human serum
sample with an undetectable level of β2-microglobulin. Each sample was
tested in three replicates. The % recovery was calculated as the difference of
the expected values and the observed values. The % recovery ranged from
93.6% to 104.0%, which met the established acceptance criteria. In addition,
linear regression of observed values versus expected values showed that the
slope, intercept and r2 were 0.9963, -0.0989 (mg/L) and 0.9987, respectively.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The ADVIA® 1650 Chemistry β2-Microglobulin assay is calibrated using the
ADVIA® Chemistry β2-Microglobulin Calibrator. The calibrator is traceable
to WHO 1st International Preparation for β2-microglobulin (NIBSC Code#
B2M).
Value Assignment of Calibrators:
The values of the Master Lot of Calibrators were initially assigned based on
Siemens N-latex β2-Microglobulin method and then confirmed by acceptable
recovery of the WHO first International Standard for β2-microglobulin
(NIBSC Code# B2M). The values of the ADVIA ® Chemistry β2-
Microglobulin Calibrators in each production lot are assigned based on
recovery of the Master Lot Calibrator and confirmed by testing of controls and
Master Lot Calibrators as samples in triplicate using the β-2 Microglobulin
method calibrated with the new production lot of calibrators with the newly
assigned values.
Stability:
Real time stability studies were performed to support the following stability
claims of the ADVIAÒ Chemistry β2-Microglobulin reagents and ADVIAÒ
β2-Microglobulin Calibrator:
· Onboard stability is 21days with a calibration frequency of 21 days.
· Shelf-life stability of the unopened ADVIA® Chemistry β2-
Microglobulin reagent stored at 2-8°C is 18 months.
· Shelf-life stability of the unopened ADVIA® Chemistry β2-
Microglobulin calibrators stored at 2-8°C is 24 months.
· Shelf-life stability of the opened (recapped) vial ADVIA® Chemistry
β2 Microglobulin calibrators stored at 2-8°C is 30 days.
d. Detection limit:
Testing for limit of detection (LoD) and limit of blank (LoB) was conducted
in accordance with CLSI guideline EP-17A. Sixty replicates of a blank
sample were used along with 60 replicates of a low serum sample (serum
sample with an approximate concentration of 0.74 mg/L). The following
results were obtained:
LoB = 0.20 mg/L
4

--- Page 5 ---
LoD = 0.25 mg/L
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference by endogenous and other substances was evaluated by testing β2-
microglobulin at concentrations of approximately 1, 3 and 11 mg/L within the
assay range. Aliquots of each serum pool were spiked with 5 equally diluted
concentrations of the interferent. The five concentrations were prepared by
diluting the pool with the highest concentration of interferent with the control
pool without interferent. All samples were run in duplicate using one reagent
lot on one system. The following is a list of the interferents and the respective
highest concentrations that were tested: bilirubin (conjugated and
unconjugated, 60 mg/dL); hemolysis (hemoglobin, 1000 mg/dL); lipemia
(from intralipid, 1000 mg/dL); rheumatoid factor (RF, 2500 IU/mL) and
ascorbic acid (50 mg/dL, 100 mg/dL, 150 mg/dL and 200 mg/dL); acetone
(1000mg/dL); cholesterol (500 mg/dL); creatinine (500 mg/dL); ethanol (1000
mg/dL); glucose (2000 mg/dL); immunoglobulin G (5000 mg/dL);
immunoglobulin M (1600 mg/dL); riboflavin (15 mg/dL); total protein (12
g/dL); urea (60 mg/dL) and uric acid (16 mg/dL). No significant interference
(i.e., sample recovers ±10%) was observed with the interferents tested with
the exception of the following: ascorbic acid spiked at 100 mg/dL to samples
containing 1.21 mg/L β2-microglobulin (-15.3%) and at 200 mg/dL to
samples containing 10.73 mg/L β2-microglobulin (-13.4%).
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Performance of the ADVIA® 1650 Chemistry β2-Microglobulin assay was
evaluated against the predicate, Siemens N Latex β2-Microglobulin (N B2M).
The study included a total of 88 remnant serum specimens. Samples were
analyzed on the ADVIA® 1650 Chemistry system using β2-Microglobulin
reagent and on the predicate device in parallel on the same day. Samples were
tested in duplicate on each system (ADVIA® Chemistry and predicate) using
one lot of reagents for each system. Results from least squares linear
regression of the data from the first replicates are summarized below.

b. Matrix comparison:
Serum/Plasma equivalency studies were performed to support the use of
lithium heparin and potassium EDTA tubes for the collection of serum and
plasma samples. Fifty-seven matched sets of serum and plasma (lithium
heparin and potassium EDTA) were used. Ten paired serum and plasma pairs
(from the same donors) were spiked with β2-microglobulin to achieve
concentrations of β2-microglobulin across the assay range. The samples were
analyzed using the ADVIA® 1650 Chemistry β2-Microglobulin method using
one lot of reagent, in duplicate. Results from linear regression on the data
from the first replicates are summarized below.
