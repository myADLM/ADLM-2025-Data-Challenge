2. Indication(s) for use:
VALIDATE ® GC3 Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Kit is intended for in
vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative determination of linearity, calibration
verification and verification of reportable range. See the package insert for the list
of all analytes claimed.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For In Vitro Diagnostic Use. For prescription use only.
These tests are not intended for use as routine quality materials or as calibration
materials.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The validation and stability studies were conducted using Beckman Coulter AU
680 analyzer.
I. Device Description:
Each VALIDATE® GC 3 Calibration Verification / Linearity Test Kit contains
purified chemicals in a human serum albumin base. Five levels are provided to
establish the relationship between theoretical and actual performance of each of
the included analytes.
Material of human origin used in the manufacture of this test set has been tested
using FDA approved methods and found to be non-reactive for HBsAg and
antibodies to HCV and HIV-1/2.

The sponsor provided protocol, acceptance criteria and summary data for stability
for up to 8 months that were reviewed and were accepted to be adequate. The real
time stability study is ongoing.
Traceability:
Same as k091225, there are no traceable materials or methods available for the
enzymes in GC3.
Value assignment
Value assignment for the following analytes in the predicate device have already
been cleared under k091225
Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), Amylase (AMY),
Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Creatine kinase (CK), Gamma-Glutamyl
Transferase (GGT), Lactate Dehydrogenase ( LD) and Lipase ( LIP) The data
provided by the sponsor indicates that for these analytes, each level is within the
claim range and the five levels are linear.
However, since Cholinesterase (CHE) had not been validated previously value
assignment for this analyte was provided separately.
The following table lists the Target recovery, the Mean observed, as well as the
absolute difference and % difference of the Mean / Target.
