* Test Strips
The Contour NEXT test strips utilize the same enzyme as the predicate Contour
test strips (FAD-GDH). The same fundamental technology is also used for
obtaining a blood glucose result. They differ in the fact that a different mediator is
utilized - MLB mediator (3-(2’, 5’-Disulfophenylimino-3H-phenothiazine) bis
sodium salt) while the predicate utilizes Potassium Ferricyanide. The MLB
mediator reduces background current and allows for a lower applied voltage.
The Contour NEXT test strips have a different electrode pattern that can be used
only on the Contour NEXT LINK device and are not compatible with the
predicate device Contour USB meter (K091820).

** Control Solutions
The Contour NEXT control solutions are identical in chemical composition to the
Contour control solutions (predicate k091820). They differ in the concentration of
the buffer BIS-TRIS (BT). The BT concentration in the Contour NEXT control
solution is lower. The lower concentration allows the Contour NEXT sample
identification algorithm to detect control and provide sufficient signal
differentiation between blood and control solution.
***Double Dip Function
A software feature that allows the user to add additional blood after initially
applying an insufficient sample (less than 0.6 uL) is present.
**** Moisture Damage Detection
A software feature that detects sensors that are exposed to humidity for long
periods of time is present. If this condition is detected, an error is flagged and the
glucose result is not calculated.
*****Algorithm
The Contour NEXT LINK device, when Contour NEXT test strip is utilized,
employs an algorithm where the current is measured at several points in time
(multi-pulse algorithm). The predicate device (K091820) uses an algorithm where
the current is measured at a single point in time. The multi-pulse algorithm allows
for additional mathematical compensations regarding hematocrit and temperature
effects.

ISO 15197: In vitro diagnostic test systems - Requirements for blood-glucose
monitoring systems for self-testing in managing diabetes mellitus
ISO 14971: Medical devices – Application of risk management of medical devices
L. Test Principle:
The CONTOUR® NEXT LINK wireless blood glucose test is based on measurement
of electrical current caused by the reaction of glucose with the reagents on the
electrode of the strip. The blood sample is drawn into the tip of the test strip through
capillary action. Glucose in the sample reacts with FAD glucose dehydrogenase
(FAD-GDH) and potassium ferricyanide. Electrons are generated, producing a current
that is proportional to the glucose in the sample. After the reaction time, the glucose
concentration in the sample is displayed. No calculation is required.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity for Contour Next test strip was established in this submission using
the Contour Next Link wireless meter. A fresh venous blood pool was divided
into eight aliquots and glycolyzed at room temperature or supplemented with
a glucose stock solution to produce whole blood samples with plasma glucose
concentrations across the intended measuring range. All samples were tested
on 8 Contour Next Link meters using 3 lots of test strips to generate 24 test
results and these results were plotted against the YSI reference values in the
liner regression analysis. The result of the regression analysis is summarized
in the below table:
Strip Lot /Meter Slope 95% CI slope Intercept 95% CI R2
intercept
Lot 1 1.00 0.998 to1.007 -1.5 -1.614 to -1.291 0.9993
Lot 2 1.02 1.015 to 1.027 -1.6 -1.863 to -1.417 0.9988
Lot 3 0.94 0.938 to 0.946 3.5 3.336 to 3.644 0.9993
3 lot/8 meters 0.99 0.983 to 0.993 0.2 -0.030 to 0.352 0.998
Based on these results, the sponsor claims a measuring range of 20-600 mg/dL
for the Contour Next Link wireless blood glucose monitoring system.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Traceable to NIST SRM 91, dry D-glucose.
Value assignment:
The value assignment of the Contour NEXT control solutions were
determined by an in-house procedure. The control solutions were prepared by
gravimetric addition of glucose to achieve target values of 120 mg/dL for
level 1 and 350 mg/dL for level 2. During release, each lot of Contour NEXT
Test Strips is tested with Contour NEXT Controls (n = 36 per control level),
and a range of ±11% around the mean is assigned as the control range for each
control level.
Stability:
Real time stability was performed to assess the shelf-life and open-vial
stability of the control solutions and test strips. Stability studies protocol and
acceptance criteria were provided and found to be adequate. Unopened
control solutions have an 18 month shelf life and are stable for 6 months after
first use when stored at 48-86 oF (9oC -30oC). The stability data also supports
an 18-month unopened bottle shelf life and an open-vial use-life for the

control materials.
d. Detection limit:
See linearity study above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference
The interference studies were carried out using three lots of Contour NEXT test
strips. A pool of fresh whole blood at 80 mg/dL and 300 mg/dL plasma glucose
was measured using the YSI method. The interferents were tested in a dose-
response method at different levels meeting and exceeding the maximum
concentration of the substance expected to be encountered in clinical practice. A
total of 24 replicates per sample were collected for the six most common
interfering substances (acetaminophen, ascorbic acid, bilirubin, uric acid,
maltose, galactose) on eight Contour Next meters with each of the three lots of
Contour NEXT test strips. The interference studies for the common drugs and
anticoagulants were done by collecting 10 replicates from each of the three
Contour NEXT test lots on five Contour Next Link Meters. In addition to testing
compounds that were known to interfere with electrochemical glucose monitoring
systems, testing was also conducted with a variety of common exogenous and
endogenous compounds as also listed in the below table.

The sponsor defined “significant interference” is +/-10% bias. Based on the test
results, the sponsor has provided the following statements in the labeling:
Ø Xylose: Do not use during or soon after xylose absorption testing.
Xylose in the blood will cause an interference.
Ø Lipemic Specimen: Cholesterol concentrations >1,168 mg/dL or
triglyceride concentrations >4,709 mg/dL may produce inaccurate
results.
Ø Reducing substances occurring in the blood naturally (uric acid,
bilirubin) or from therapeutic treatments (ascorbic acid,
acetaminophen) will not significantly affect results.
Ø Interference might occur when the values of the limiting
concentrations of these compounds are greater than those listed below:
Bilirubin >54 mg/dL
Uric Acid >59 mg/dL
Ascorbic Acid >10 mg/dL
Acetaminophen >35 mg/dL
Maltose no interference
Galactose no interference
Ø CONTOUR NEXT test strip results are not significantly affected by
hematocrit levels in the range of 15% to 65%.

100 participants from a diabetic clinic. A trained HCP collected fingerstick
sample from each participant. Each sample was tested in singlet using three
different glucose reagent strip lots, 10 vials per lot to yield 300 total results.
Six meters were used—two with each reagent strip lot. Fingerstick samples
were analyzed on an YSI 2300 STAT PLUS analyzer to provide reference
values. The analyses were performed at 23 ±0.5 ºC.
In most cases, samples were tested fresh from the finger without any
modification. Altered samples (10% of total) were created by either
glycolyzing a specimen to lower the glucose concentration or supplementing a
specimen with a concentrated glucose solution to increase the glucose level.
The distribution of the sample glucose concentrations is specified in the table
below.

User performance study was performed to compare the lay user self-test
results and the YSI method. Study was performed in one clinical site in US
with 110 subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, age 19-86 (mean age of 53),
and 47% male. All subjects performed fingerstick tests (i.e. capillary) and palm
tests; the results were compared to the YSI laboratory reference results from
fingerstick blood. Three test strip lots were tested in the study, with each subject
randomized to one lot.
The range of glucose values for the finger stick samples was 43-558 mg/dL
measured by YSI. Linear regressions analysis results are summarized below:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Expected blood glucose results were cited from the literature1 and presented in the
labeling as follows:
Non diabetic plasma glucose concentrations are normally maintained within a
relatively narrow 70-110 mg/dL in the fasting state. You should consult with your
healthcare provider for expected glucose values specific to your needs.

meter by the user. The meter is automatically coded.
6. Quality Control:
Glucose control solutions at 2 different concentrations can be run with this device
and Control level 2 is provided with the kit. The meter automatically distinguishes
control solution from blood and marks control solution tests with a check mark
and excludes them from average calculations. Recommendations on when to test
the control materials are provided in the labeling. An acceptable range for each
control level is printed on the test strip bottle label or on the bottom of the test
strip box. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls
outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the results showed that
the labeling (User Guide, test strip package insert and control solution package
insert) were written at or lower than the 8th grade level.
2. Customer service is available 24 hours/day, 365 days a year. Toll free phone
number is 1-800-348-8100 for Bayer Diabetes Care customer support.
3. Temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated for temperatures
ranging from 41oF-113oF (5oC to 45oC) and relative humidity from 10% to 93%
including extreme combinations of temperature and humidity, e.g. lowest
humidity with lowest and highest temperature and highest humidity with lowest
and highest temperature. Protocol and acceptance criteria were provided and
found to be acceptable. The results supported the Sponsor’s claimed operating
temperature from 41oF-113oF and relative humidity range from 10% to 93%.
4. EMC testing was performed by an accredited EMC Testing Laboratory. A test
certificate was issued to Bayer on March 30, 2011.
5. The device is intended for single-patient use only. Clorox® Germicidal Wipes
containing 0.55% sodium hypochlorite with EPA registration # 67619-12 was
validated demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus using materials from
the meter and lancing device. The sponsor also demonstrated that there
was no change in performance or in the external materials of the meter and
lancing device after 260 cleaning and disinfection cycles designed to simulate
cleaning and disinfection 1x per week for 5 years. Labeling was reviewed for
14

--- Page 15 ---
adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
6. Altitude Study
To ensure that high altitudes will not affect the system performance, a study was
conducted inside a glove box purged with ultra pure nitrogen to simulate high
altitude at 22,552 feet (6874 meters).
Two lots of reagent test strips were tested on five Contour®Next Link wireless
meters in duplicate (total n=10) with 15, 41, and 65% hematocrit whole blood
supplemented to achieve target plasma glucose levels of 40, 90, and 450 mg/dL.
Mean assay results obtained inside the glove box were compared to the plasma
YSI glucose values, and to the lab-elevation values. The difference for glucose
values <75mg/dL and the percent difference for glucose values ≥75 mg/dL was
calculated. The mean bias across all hematocrit levels for glucose values
<75mg/dL and ≥75 mg/dL are acceptable.
The results support a system claim of up to 6874 meters (22,552 feet).
7. Hematocrit study:
The hematocrit sensitivity of the Contour Next Link system was evaluated. Three
lots of reagent test strips were tested on five Contour® Next Link wireless meters
in triplicate (total n = 15) with 15, 20, 30, 42, 55 and 65% hematocrit whole blood
at 5 glucose concentrations of 40, 90, 127, 329 and 450 mg/dL. Sample bias was
calculated relative to the YSI reference method. The results support the sponsor’s
claim that the system is accurate in hematocrit range of 15-65%.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
