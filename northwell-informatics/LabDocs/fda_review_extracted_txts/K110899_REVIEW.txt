microtiter plate. Serum is added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes at 37° C.
If H. pylori IgA antibodies are present they will bind to the antigen in the well.
Unbound serum is removed by washing the wells three times. An HRP-conjugated
anti-human IgA is then added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 °C. The
wells are washed three times to remove any unbound conjugate. A TMB substrate is
added to each well and the plate is incubated for 30 minutes at 37 °C. This reaction
generates a blue color produced by the bound enzyme (peroxidase). The color
changes to yellow when the stopping solution is added and the color intensity is
measured spectrophotometrically

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
N/A
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls provided are ready to use. Units of the cut-off controls are defined as
10 units. The calculated units of the positive controls should be within the
ranges mentioned in the quality control certificate. If those requirements (OD
values, units) are not fulfilled, the test has to be repeated.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection was determined by testing the kit controls along with a
pooled positive sample and several dilutions of the pooled sample. The limit
of detection was determined at a 3.3 fold dilution of the pooled sample giving
an OD value of 0.558 with a corresponding unit value of 11.3
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity
An adsorption study was performed to evaluate cross reactivity. Briefly, sera
with different levels of antibodies to H. pylori were adsorbed with either of
the following organisms; H. pylori, Candida albicans, E. coli, Borrelia
burgdorferi, Clostridium spp., Campylobacter, Bacillus, Enterobacter,
Pseudomonas, Proteus , or two different strains of H. influenza. The identity
of the bacteria used were identified by the ATCC and confirmed by mass

the other organisms. Overall no effects on the analytical specificity were seen
with the Gold Standard Diagnostics H. pylori ELISA IgA assay.
Interfering Substances
Interference
The effect of potential interfering substances on samples using the Gold
Standard Diagnostics H. pylori ELISA IgA assay was evaluated. High levels
of hemoglobin, bilirubin, cholesterol and triglycerides in serum samples were
tested. The concentrations, recommended in the guideline "Interference
Testing in Clinical Chemistry" from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute, were used. The tested substances did not affect the performance of
the Gold Standard Diagnostics H. pylori ELISA IgA assay.

f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off was determined by testing normal sera, clinical defined samples,
proficiency samples, along with sera positive for H. pylori, borderline positive
for H. pylori, and high negative for H. pylori for a total of 254 samples. The
cutoff was determined by taking the negative average plus three standard
deviations from normal sera samples. The cutoff was further adjusted so that
the clinically defined samples were positive, the proficiency samples met their
criteria, the positive H. pylori sera were positive, and the H. pylori negative
sera were negative.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The performance of the Gold Standard Diagnostics H. pylori ELISA IgA
assay was determined by conducting a correlation study using 628 samples
being routinely tested for H. pylori. Testing was conducted at three
geographically diverse clinical sites. The samples were tested with both the
Gold Standard Diagnostics H. pylori ELISA IgA assay and the predicate
device. The results are summarized in the following table:
Predicate Device IgA ELISA
Positive Borderline Negative
Gold Standard Positive 121 31 26
Diagnostics IgA Borderline 13 8 23
ELISA Negative 7 5 394
%Positive Agreement = 94.5% (C.I. 76.0 - 100%)
%Negative Agreement = 93.8% (C.I. 88.8% - 99.5%)
Overall Agreement = 94.0% (C.I. 85.9% - 100%)
The discrepant samples were further tested with a second commercially available
assay. Of the seven samples, that were negative by the Gold Standard assay and
positive by the predicate device, five samples were positive by the second assay.
Of the 26 Gold Standard Diagnostics positive samples, which were negative by

histological examination, or the urea breath test.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):

4. Clinical cut-off:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
H. pylori is universally distributed and affects all genders, ages and races. The
prevalence of infection with H. pylori is higher in underdeveloped countries and
in the communities with a low standard of living and poor hygiene. Studies in
asymptomatic Caucasians in the United States show that there is an increase in the
prevalence of H. pylori infection with age. An expected values study was
performed with the H. pylori ELISA Ig A assay testing 628 patients from various
populations. Results showed that a total of 121 patients were positive with the
assay. The expected values result seen in this study for the H. pylori IgA assay is
19%.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports
a substantial equivalence decision.
