sodium, specific gravity, urea, and uric acid assays on various clinical chemistry
systems. This in vitro diagnostic device is intended for prescription use only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The labeling contains a statement that all human source material was tested by
FDA-approved methods and found to be non-reactive for the presence of HBsAg,
HCV and antibody to HIV 1/2.
In-vitro diagnostic use. Prescription use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Performance was evaluated on the following instrument systems: Abbott
Architect c/ci systems, Beckman Coulter AU400/500/600/800, Beckman
CX4/5/7/9/LX20/DxC600/800, Cobas Integra 400/800, Hitachi Series 717/7150/
902/904/911/912/917, Johnson and Johnson Ortho Vitros

1200/1650/2400, Siemens/Dade Dimension RxL/Max/Xpand, pH meter, freezing
point depression osmometers.
I. Device Description:
The Randox Liquid Urine Controls Level 2 and Level 3 are ready-to-use, liquid
controls derived from human urine. The source material has been tested by FDA
approved methods and found non-reactive for Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis C
and the antibody to HIV-1 and HIV-2. Each control level is purchased separately and

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and Value Assignment: Control solutions are derived from
gravimetrically prepared stock solutions and analyzed in-house. Value
assignment was determined through multiple analyses in- house on
instrumentation calibrated with a master lot of calibrator. Control values were
also confirmed in external studies with 9 different instrument families in 203
laboratories. Assigned control ranges are listed in the labeling by instrument
family and analyte methods.
Stability: Real time stability studies were conducted for closed and open
vials. Shelf-Life and Open Vial Stability testing protocols and acceptance
criteria were described and found to be adequate.
Shelf-Life – The sponsor provided real time stability data demonstrating that
the Randox Liquid Urine Controls, Levels 2 and 3, can be stored for 2 years at
2-8 °C.
Open-vial – The sponsor provided data demonstrating that upon opening a
vial, the material is stable for 30 days at 2-8 °C.
