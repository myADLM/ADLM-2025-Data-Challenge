L. Test Principle:
The cobas® CT/NG Test for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae is based on
2 major processes: (1) automated sample preparation to obtain nucleic acids, including CT
and NG DNA; (2) simultaneous PCR amplification of target DNA sequences using both CT
and NG specific primer pairs and real-time detection of cleaved fluorescent-labeled CT and
NG specific oligonucleotide detection probes. An Internal Control, containing CT and NG
DNA, is added to all samples prior to automated sample preparation and is amplified and
detected simultaneously with each sample to monitor the entire process.
Sample preparation for the cobas® CT/NG Test is automated with the use of the cobas x 480
instrument. Specimens are lysed in the collection device by the chaotropic agent in the
cobas® PCR Media. Released nucleic acids, along with added CT/NG Internal Control DNA,
are purified through binding to magnetic glass particles, washed, and finally separated from
these particles making them ready for PCR amplification and detection.
Target Selection
In addition to chromosomal DNA, C. trachomatis contains an approximately 7,500 base pair
cryptic plasmid that is common to all serovars of C. trachomatis. The cobas® CT/NG Test uses
the CT primers CP102 and CP103 to define a sequence of approximately 206 nucleotides
within the cryptic plasmid DNA of C. trachomatis. In addition, the cobas® CT/NG Test uses
the CT primers CTMP101 and CTMP102 to define a sequence of approximately 182
nucleotides within the chromosomal DNA of C. trachomatis.
The N. gonorrhoeae target site is a highly conserved direct repeat region called DR-9. The
cobas® CT/NG Test uses the NG primers NG514 and NG519 to define a sequence of
approximately 190 nucleotides (DR-9A) from this region. In addition, the cobas® CT/NG
Test uses another set of NG primers, NG552 and NG579, to define a second sequence of
approximately 215 nucleotides (DR-9B) from this region.
Target Amplification
Processed samples are added to the amplification mixture in a microwell plate, in which PCR
amplification occurs. The reaction mixture is heated to separate the isolated double-stranded
DNA and expose the primer target sequences. As the mixture cools, the primers anneal to the
target DNA. Z05 DNA polymerase, in the presence of Mn2+ and excess dNTPs, extends the
annealed primers along the target templates to produce double-stranded DNA. This
completes the first cycle of PCR, yielding a double-stranded DNA copy of the target regions
of the CT and/or NG DNA and the CT/NG Internal Control DNA. Repetition of this process
results in the amplification of DNA between the primer target sequences, producing a
double-stranded DNA molecule termed an amplicon. The cobas z 480 analyzer automatically
repeats this process for a designated number of cycles, with each cycle intended to double the
amount of amplicon DNA. The required number of cycles is preprogrammed into the cobas®
4800 Software. Amplification occurs only in the specific CT and/or NG targets between their
respective primers; the entire CT cryptic plasmid or CT and/or NG genomes are not
amplified.
6

--- Page 7 ---
Internal Control Amplification
The CT/NG Internal Control is a combination of two non-infectious recombinant plasmid
DNAs, each with primer binding regions identical to those of either the C. trachomatis or the
N. gonorrhoeae genomic target sequences. Both recombinant plasmid DNAs have an identical
randomized internal target sequence, and a unique probe binding region that differentiates the
CT/NG Internal Control from target amplicon. These features were selected to ensure
independent detection of both the CT/NG Internal Control and the C. trachomatis and N.
gonorrhoeae target DNAs. The CT/NG Internal Control Reagent is included in the cobas®
CT/NG Test and is introduced into each sample on the cobas x 480 instrument during sample
processing.
Selective Amplification
Selective amplification of target nucleic acid from the specimen is achieved in the cobas®
CT/NG Test by the use of AmpErase (uracil-N-glycosylase) enzyme and deoxyuridine
triphosphate (dUTP). The AmpErase enzyme recognizes and catalyzes the destruction of
DNA strands containing deoxyuridine, but not DNA containing deoxythymidine.
Deoxyuridine is not present in naturally occurring DNA, but is always present in amplicon
due to the use of deoxyuridine triphosphate in place of thymidine triphosphate as one of the
dNTPs in the Master Mix reagent; therefore, only amplicon contain deoxyuridine.
Deoxyuridine renders contaminating amplicon susceptible to destruction by AmpErase
enzyme prior to amplification of the target DNA. AmpErase enzyme, which is included in
the Master Mix reagent, catalyzes the cleavage of deoxyuridine-containing DNA at the
deoxyuridine residues by opening the deoxyribose chain at the C1-position. When heated in
the first thermal cycling step at the alkaline pH of Master Mix, the amplicon DNA chain
breaks at the position of the deoxyuridine, thereby rendering the DNA non-amplifiable.
AmpErase enzyme is inactive at temperatures above 55ºC, i.e., throughout the thermal
cycling steps, and therefore does not destroy target amplicon. The cobas® CT/NG Test has
been demonstrated to inactivate at least 103 copies of deoxyuridine-containing CT/NG
amplicon per PCR.
Detection of PCR Products
The cobas® CT/NG Test utilizes real-time PCR technology. The use of fluorescent probes
provides for real-time detection of PCR product accumulation by monitoring the emission
intensity of fluorescent dyes released during the amplification process. The probes include
CT cryptic plasmid, CT ompA, NG DR-9A, NG DR-9B and CT/NG Internal Control-specific
oligonucleotides, all labeled with a reporter dye and a quencher. When the fluorescent dye-
labeled probes are intact, the reporter fluorescence is suppressed by the proximity of the
quencher due to Förster-type energy transfer effects. During PCR, the probes hybridize to
their respective target sequence and are cleaved by the 5’ to 3’ nuclease activity of the
thermostable Z05 DNA polymerase. Once the reporter and quencher are separated,
quenching no longer occurs, and the fluorescent emission of the reporter dyes increases. The
amplification of CT targets, NG targets and the CT/NG Internal Control are measured
independently and at different wavelengths. This process is repeated for a designated number
of cycles, each cycle increasing the emission intensity of the individual reporter dyes.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision: In-house Precision was examined using a panel composed of CT and NG
cultures diluted into cobas® PCR Media and cobas® PCR Media mixed with negative
urine. The precision panel was designed to include members with either CT or NG at
approximately the LOD for the panel matrix, members with both CT and NG at
approximately the LOD and 2.5 x LOD for the panel matrix and a negative level. Testing
was done with three unique lots of cobas® CT/NG Test reagents and three instruments for
a total of 24 runs. A description of the precision panels and the study performance hit rate
is shown in the table below. All positive panel levels yielded the anticipated hit rates. All
negative panel levels tested negative throughout the study. An analysis of the variance of
the Ct values from valid tests performed on positive panel members yielded overall CV
(%) ranges from 1.1% to 1.8% for CT and from 1.2% to 1.9% for NG.

total tests). If cobas® PCR Media panels were combined in a run, only 1 positive and 1
negative control were included (32 total tests). The 2 operators at each site performed 2 runs
per day, for a total of 3 days of testing per operator per panel type (6 days of testing total for
each panel type and reagent lot). Testing was performed with 2 reagent lots (6 days of testing
per lot). Overall, 74 runs were performed, and 72 valid runs were obtained for urine and
swab panel types. The 2 invalid runs were due to instrument errors. A total of 1,080 tests
were performed on the 5 panel members for each panel type. There was 1 invalid test result
in the urine panel type, and 2 invalid test results in the swab panel type. These invalid tests
were due to instrument errors. All valid test results were included in the analyses of the
percent agreement for CT and NG for each panel type separately. There were no false
positive results for either analyte (CT and NG) for both panel types for negative panel
members, thus giving negative percent agreement (NPA) of 100% for each analyte.
C. trachomatis Reproducibility results: For both matrix types, percent agreement for CT
positive and negative samples was 100%. Analysis of variance components of the Ct values
performed on positive panel members yielded overall CV (%) ranges from 1.1% to 1.5% for
the urine panel type; 1.6% to 1.8% for the swab panel type.

Precision of High-Negative CT and NG Samples:
A second study was conducted internally at Roche Molecular Systems to characterize the
precision of test results at target levels below the analytical Limit of Detection of the assay.
High-negative panels were prepared by spiking CT and NG cultures into urine and vaginal
specimen stabilized in cobas® PCR Media to levels producing from 20 to 80% negative results.
Negative panel members were also prepared for each matrix. For each sample matrix, panels
were tested over the course of 12 days by two operators using two lots of reagents and three
cobas® 4800 Systems. Five replicates of each panel member were tested in each run, generating
up to 120 test results for each panel level. The high-negative panel testing yielded the
anticipated hit rates.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
One set of cobas® CT/NG Test Positive and Negative Controls are included in each run. For
any run, valid results must be obtained for both the Positive and Negative Control for the
cobas® 4800 Software to display the reportable cobas® CT/NG Test results from that run.
The CT/NG (+) Control contains non-infectious DNA plasmids of both C. trachomatis and
N. gonorrhoeae sequences and is used as a run control to monitor the target capture,
amplification, and detection steps of the test. The CT/NG (-) Control contains buffer with no
nucleic acid.
The CT/NG Internal Control is a combination of two non-infectious recombinant plasmid
DNAs, each with primer binding regions identical to those of either the C. trachomatis or the
N. gonorrhoeae genomic target sequences. The Internal Control is added to all specimens and
the Positive and Negative Controls during sample preparation on the cobas x 480 instrument.
The Internal Control confirms the reliability of test specimens by monitoring for the presence
of PCR inhibitors. The Internal Control is also required for validation of the run controls.

d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity (Limit of Detection or LOD) for the cobas® CT/NG Test was
determined by analyzing dilutions of quantified Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria
gonorrhoeae cultures. CT and NG cultures were diluted into a matrix of negative vaginal
swab specimen in cobas® PCR Media and into a matrix of negative urine specimen plus
cobas® PCR Media to determine the LOD for vaginal swab and urine specimens. All levels
were analyzed using the full cobas® CT/NG Test workflow across 3 unique lots of cobas®
CT/NG Test reagents. LOD for this test is defined as the target concentration which can be
detected as positive in ≥ 95% of the replicates tested. Since LOD evaluation is done with
samples stabilized in cobas® PCR Media, the LOD for neat urine will be twice the level
reported in the table below. The LOD for the CT serovar D culture and NG strain 19424 in
vaginal swab specimens stabilized in cobas® PCR Media and urine specimens diluted into
cobas® PCR Media are shown in the following table.

Urine 7 192* 0.75 7 192* 2.25
*Testing included one negative level with 167-168 replicates
**Testing included one negative level with 82-84 replicates
e. Inclusivity
Inclusivity testing with the cobas® CT/NG Test was performed for 14 additional CT
serovars, the Swedish new variant strain (nvCT) and an additional 44 independently isolated
strains of NG. Testing was done to demonstrate that these targets can be detected around the
LOD levels determined during analytical sensitivity testing for the CT serovar D culture and
NG strain 19424. At least 49 replicates were tested for each panel level using one lot of
cobas® CT/NG Test reagents. Results are shown in the tables below. In cobas® PCR Media
plus urine, positive hit rates for the 14 CT serovars plus the nvCT variant (Table 18) were
100% for concentrations ranging from 0.13 to 0.75 IFU/ml. All CT serovars and the nvCT
variant were tested at 10 IFU/mL in stabilized negative vaginal specimen, yielding 100%
positive hit rates. All 44 NG strains were tested at 3.75 Colony Forming Units (CFU)/mL in
cobas® PCR Media plus urine and at 100 CFU/mL in stabilized negative vaginal specimen.
Positive hit rates ranged from 96 to 100%. In the table below, all NG strains with identical
results are presented as a group, shown in the columns labeled “Numbers of NG Strains”.

g. Interference Study
Interference testing was performed using cobas® PCR Media plus negative urine and negative
vaginal swab specimen (stabilized in cobas® PCR Media) spiked with CT and NG cultures at ~
3 x LOD for each target. Eighteen over-the-counter (OTC) products, including contraceptive
jelly, lubricants, feminine sprays, anti-fungal cream and anti-itch cream, as well as whole
blood, cervical mucus and PBMC cells were tested for interference. In addition, several
prescription drugs were tested in cobas® PCR Media plus negative urine, including clindamycin
phosphate, estradiol, metronidazole and estrogen. Metronidazole vaginal gel was found to
produce invalid and/or false negative results in cobas® PCR Media plus negative urine spiked
with CT and NG cultures at ~ 3 x LOD for each target. The levels of whole blood, mucus and
PBMC cells shown in the following table represent maximum allowable concentrations
which will not interfere with cobas® CT/NG Test performance. Concentrations in urine
samples were determined using total sample volume, including stabilizing media.

h. Carry over/contamination
Sample-to-sample and run-to-run cross-contamination carryover studies were performed on
the cobas® 4800 System using the CT/NG Workflow. Testing was performed on three
instruments and included testing of five runs of high-positive and negative samples in a
checkerboard configuration, followed by a sixth run of all negative samples. The sample-to-
sample cross contamination rate for these studies was 1.24% and the run-to-run carry over
rate was 0.0%.
i. Assay cut-off:
A preliminary Ct value cut-off for both CT and NG was initially verified using data from the
Limit of Detection (LOD) studies. CT and NG spiked samples at, above and below the LOD
of the test were used to identify the Ct value range for known positive samples at
diminishingly low levels. The lowest level tested produced positive hit rates near 50%, which
would correspond to approximately 1 copy of target per PCR based on a Poisson distribution.
Samples without the addition of CT or NG were used to confirm that negative results did not
generate Ct values. Next, data from the cobas® CT/NG clinical trial were compiled and
analyzed to identify the distribution of CT and NG Ct values for all specimen types and to
validate the appropriate separation between the highest Ct value observed in positive
specimens and the assay cut-off.
j. Competitive Inhibition Studies
Panels were prepared by spiking CT and NG cultures into urine and vaginal specimens
stabilized in cobas® PCR Media to various concentration levels to examine the potential for
competitive inhibition. Panels were prepared with two strains each of CT and NG. Panels

member were tested in every run, generating a maximum of 10 test results for each level and
CT and NG strain respectively. Average Ct values for each of the panel levels are
summarized in the tables below. All CT and NG hit rates were 100% for all panel levels in
both matrices. Competitive inhibition was not seen in any combination of CT and NG levels

3. Clinical studies:
Specimen collection took place at 12 collection sites in the US, which included family
planning and Obstetrics/Gynecology (OB/GYN) clinics, and sexually transmitted disease
clinics. A total of 4 laboratory sites performed specimen testing. In the clinical study, a
total of 12/286 (4.2%) runs were classified as invalid due to instrument or operator error.
There were no invalid runs due to test controls failure. At collection sites, female subjects
provided a self-collected vaginal specimen and male subjects provided a urine specimen
in the respective cobas® media collection kits. To determine the patient infected status,
female patients provided a urine specimen and clinician-collected endocervical swab
specimen in collection media from two reference nucleic acid amplification tests
(NAAT), and a cervical specimen in PreservCyt® Solution (Hologic Corporation,
Bedford, MA) obtained with a spatula/cytobrush or a broom. To determine the patient
infected status, male subjects provided urethral swab specimens and urine specimens in
collection media from two reference nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT). Subjects
were classified as symptomatic if they reported symptoms indicative of CT or NG
infection, as listed below.
· Dysuria/pain during urination, coital pain/difficulty/bleeding, discharge, or pelvic
pain
· Abnormal vaginal discharge
· Pelvic/uterine/ovarian pain
· Urethral discharge, testicular pain/scrotal pain/swelling
Subjects were classified as asymptomatic if they did not report these symptoms.
Samples were tested for CT and NG using the cobas® CT/NG Test and two reference
nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT). Testing with all devices followed the
manufacturers’ instructions. The clinical performance of the cobas® CT/NG Test was
evaluated by comparing the results from collected sample types to a pre-specified PIS
(Patient Infected Status) algorithm as determined by combined results from 2
commercially available nucleic acid amplification tests (reference devices).

For the primary objective, sensitivity (SENS), specificity (SPEC), positive predictive
value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the cobas® CT/NG Test were
calculated separately for detection of CT or NG by using PIS as the reference standard.
For each gender and within each sample type, the analyses were performed overall and
then subset by symptom status, collection site, and age category. In addition, the
predictive values were calculated based on sensitivity and specificity with all data
combined for a range of hypothetical prevalence values.
Of the 2,985 subjects (2,195 females and 790 males) tested with the cobas® CT/NG Test,
3 were excluded from the analyses because they did not meet study entry criteria or
because they withdrew consent; 131 were considered non-evaluable and excluded from
all statistical analyses because of errors in specimen collection, transport, and storage;
unknown PIS for both CT and NG; or invalid cobas® CT/NG test results after initial
testing and/or retesting. Therefore, of 2,982 subjects enrolled, 2,851 (95.6%) were
evaluable for CT and NG primary analyses (2,083 females and 768 males). All
performance calculations were based on valid cobas® CT/NG Test results from male
urine specimens and self-collected vaginal swab specimens.
Chlamydia trachomatis (CT)
The following tables summarize the results from symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects
designated as infected or non-infected with CT (females and males, respectively)
according to the PIS algorithm. A total of 131 females and 126 males were infected with
CT. Symptoms were reported in 61.1% (80/131) of infected and 50.9% (993/1,952) of
non-infected women. Similarly, symptoms were reported in 58.7% (74/126) of infected
