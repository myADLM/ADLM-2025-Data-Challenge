by the protease present in the reagent. For the measurement of total hemoglobin, the A1c_3
Agglutinator Reagent (A1c_3 R1) is used. The assay is based on the determination of
released heme in the Soret region at 410 nm.
A latex agglutination inhibition assay is used for the measurement of specific A1c. A second
protease in the R1 reagent further hydrolyzes the HbA1c sample to a glycated pentapeptide,
which competes with the agglutinator (synthetic polymer containing multiple copies of the
immunoreactive portion of A1c) for the anti-HbA1c antibody, thereby reducing the rate of
agglutination. A concentration curve is obtained by monitoring the change the scattered light
at 694 nm as a change of absorbance. The actual change in absorbance is inversely
proportional to the concentration of A1c in the sample.
The A1c_3 and thB_3 results use the HbA1c% ratio to determine HbA1c results in NGSP
equivalent units (%). The HbA1cR Ratio is used to determine HbA1c results in IFCC
equivalent units (mmol/mol). The required assays and parameter sheets are summarized in

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A commercially available linearity set solution was used to assess the linearity across
the entire measuring range of the assay. The low and high levels of the linearity set
were mixed to make a total of nine intermediate levels on the ADVIA 1800 analyzer
using the Hemoglobin A1c3 Automated Pretreatment Assay. The range of samples
tested was 1.13 – 19.44 %A1c. The observed values versus the expected values are
95.0 – 100.7%. The regression was:
y= 1.0487x – 0.2829, r=0.999.
The data provided support the sponsor’s claims that the reportable range of this assay
is 2.9 – 15.4% A1c.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The ADVIA 1800 Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c_3 assay standardization is traceable to
the IFCC reference calibrators. The assigned A1c and total hemoglobin (tHb_3)
values of the calibrators are traceable to the NGSP reference method (Tosoh G7)
through a correlation study. The ADVIA Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c assay is
certified with the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP). The
NGSP certification expires in one year. See NGSP website for current certification at
http://www,ngsp.org.
The derived result of the ratio (%) from the NGSP correlation is calculated from the
individual quantitative results for total hemoglobin (tHb_3) and Hemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c_3). The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) units of
mmol/mol are calculated using the Master Equation:
IFCC= (NGSP-2.15)/0.092
Two different units are provided to the customers:
NGSP equivalent units (%) and IFCC equivalent units (mmol/mol)

Stability:
Shelf-life and open vial stability testing protocols for the calibrators have been
previously cleared under k081895.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined by assaying
a zero sample (blank) and five low HbA1c samples according to CLSI guideline
EP17-A. Each sample was assayed twice a day in replicates of ten (n=60) for three
days on the ADVIA analyzer. The detection limits are summarized in the table below.

A1c_3 Automated Pretreatment Assay
The assay has a reportable range of 2.9% to 15.4% A1c.
e. Analytical specificity:
i.) Studies were performed to assess common or known substances that could
interfere with the ADVIA 1800 Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c_3 Automated
Pretreatment assay. The interfering substances were evaluated in whole blood EDTA
samples that had different Hgb A1c concentrations. The low range samples ranged
from 4.87 – 5.26%HbA1c (30-34 mmol/mol); the high level samples ranged from
8.99 – 9.90% HbA1c (74-84 mmol/mol). Samples were assayed in duplicate on the
ADVIA 1800 analyzer using the Hemoglobin A1c_3 assay. The sponsor’s acceptance
criterion is analyte recovery should not vary from the base recovery by more than
10%. No significant interference was defined as the % recovery of <10%.
The sponsor claimed that there was no significant interference by the following
interferents:
• Conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin up to 60 mg/dL
• Triglycerides (Intralipid) up to 1000 mg/dL
• Rheumatoid Factor up to 936 IU/mL
ii.) An interference study was performed to assess the affect of labile A1c with the
ADVIA 1800 Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c_3 Automated Pretreatment assay. Two
levels of pooled blood samples (~5.3 and 9.9% A1c) were used and each pool was
split into two aliquots. One aliquot was used as the control sample while the other
aliquot was supplemented by dissolving 0.030 g (30mg) of glucose into the pool
sample (glucose concentration = 1500mg/dL). The sample was incubated for five
hours at 37˚C to facilitate formation of labile A1c. Both aliquots were tested on
the ADVIA 1800 analyzer. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria is ≤ 10% bias

between the tested and the control samples.
The sponsor concluded that labile A1c concentrations do not interfere with the
ADVIA 1800 Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c_3 Automated Pretreatment assay.
iii.) An interference study was performed to assess the effect of urea with the
ADVIA 1800 Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c_3 Automated Pretreatment assay. Two
levels of pooled whole blood samples (~5.1 and 9.7 A1c) were used and each pool
was split into two aliquots. One aliquot was used as the control sample while the
other was supplemented by dissolving 3 mg of urea into the pool sample (urea
concentration = 150 mg/dL). The sample was incubated for two hours at 37˚C. Both
aliquots were tested on the ADVIA 180 analyzer. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion
is ≤ 10% bias between the tested and the control samples.
The sponsor concluded that urea concentrations ≤ 150 mg/dL do not interfere with the
ADVIA 1800 Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c_3 Automated Pretreatment assay.
iv.) An interference study was performed to assess the effect of acetylsalicylic acid
with the ADVIA 1800 Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c_3 Automated Pretreatment assay.
One pooled whole blood sample (~5.9% A1c) was used and split into two aliquots.
One aliquot was used as the control sample while the other aliquot was supplemented
by dissolving 900.8 mg of acetylsalicylic acid into an ethanol stock solution and then
adding this stock solution into the pool sample. The sample was incubated for three
hours at 37˚C. Both aliquots were tested on the ADVIA 1800 analyzer. The
sponsor’s acceptance criterion is ≤ 10% bias between the tested and the control
samples.
The sponsor concluded that acetylacetic acid concentrations ≤ 10mM does not
interfere with the ADVIA 1800 Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c_3 Automated
Pretreatment assay.
v.) An interference study was performed to assess the effect of carbamylated A1c
with the ADVIA 1800 Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c_3 Automated Pretreatment assay.
A pooled whole blood sample (~4.78 %A1c) was split into two aliquots. One aliquot
was used as the control sample while the other aliquot was supplemented by
dissolving 325 mg of sodium cyanate into H O to make a stock solution in which 2.5
2
ml of this stock solution is then added to the whole blood sample. The samples were
incubated for one hour at 37˚C for one hour. Both aliquots were tested in duplicate on
the ADVIA 1800 analyzer. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion is ≤ 10% bias between
the tested and the control samples.
The sponsor concluded that carbamylated A1c does not interfere with the ADVIA
1800 Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c_3 Automated Pretreatment assay.
vi.) A hemoglobin concentration interference study was done with the ADVIA 1800
Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c_3 Automated Pretreatment assay by testing varying
7

--- Page 8 ---
concentrations of total hemoglobin at the same level of %A1c. Seven individual
normal donors were used for the study. The acceptance criterion for the hemoglobin
interference was %HbA1c at different hemoglobin levels must be within ±7.5% of
the target % HbA1c. The results met the sponsor’s predetermined criteria and the
sponsor concluded that total hemoglobin in the range of 7 to 26 g/dL does not
interfere with the ADVIA 1800 Chemistry Hemoglobin A1c_3 Automated
Pretreatment assay.
vii.) A hemoglobin variant interference study was carried out using NGSP samples
known to contain Hemoglobin variants C, S, D, E and F. These variant samples were
tested on the Primus Ultra 2 HPLC system and the ADVIA 1800 analyzer with the
ADVIA Hemoglobin A1c_3 Automated Pretreatment method. All the variants tested
showed <10% bias at 6% and 9% except Hemoglobin F at concentrations greater than
10%. Hemoglobin F variant >10% showed a negative bias therefore, the sponsor has
the following limitation in their labeling:
“Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF) consists of two alpha and two gamma chains that are not
recognized by the anti-HbA1c antibody. Samples that contain high amounts of HBF
(>10%), usually found in some people with thalassemia, in infants, and in some
pregnant women, may yield a lower than expected HbA1c result with this assay. For
blood samples containing HbF (>10%), HbA1c results obtained by this assay should
not be compared to published normal or abnormal results”.
See NGSP at http://www.ngsp.org for assay interferences with hemoglobin variants.
