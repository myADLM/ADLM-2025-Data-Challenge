510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
K110968
B. Purpose for Submission:
Modification of the previously cleared ProFlu+ Rt-PCR assay (K092500).
Two new Influenza A probes located directly upstream of the current ProFlu+
Influenza A probe and containing a degenerate nucleotide (C or T) at the 3’ terminus
were added to the supermix to improve the detection of the 2009 H1N1 influenza
viruses containing point mutation in the matrix gene at the probe binding.
C. Measurand:
Respiratory specimen virus nucleic acid (RNA) target sequences. The targeted viruses
have been associated with respiratory infections in adults and/or children. Viral types
detected: Influenza A, Influenza B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus Type A, Respiratory
Syncytial Virus Type B
D. Type of Test:
Multiplex nucleic acid assay for qualitative determination of Influenza A, Influenza
B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus Type A, Respiratory Syncytial Virus Type B) in
nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from individuals with signs and symptoms of
respiratory tract infections.
E. Applicant:
Gen-Probe Prodesse, Inc.
F. Proprietary and Established Names
ProFlu+TM assay
Common Name: Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) multiplex nucleic acid assay
G. Regulatory Information:
1. Regulation section: 866.3980 - Respiratory viral panel multiplex nucleic acid assay
2. Classification: Class II
3. Product code: OCC, OOI
4. Panel: Microbiology (83)
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use:
The ProFlu™+ Assay is a multiplex Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR) in vitro
diagnostic test for the rapid and qualitative detection and discrimination of
Influenza A Virus, Influenza B Virus, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)
1

--- Page 2 ---
nucleic acids isolated and purified from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens
obtained from symptomatic patients. This test is intended for use to aid in the
differential diagnosis of Influenza A, Influenza B and RSV viral infections in
humans and is not intended to detect Influenza C.
Negative results do not preclude influenza or RSV virus infection and should not
be used as the sole basis for treatment or other management decisions.
Conversely, positive results do not rule-out bacterial infection or co-infection with
other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease. The use
of additional laboratory testing and clinical presentation must be considered in
order to obtain the final diagnosis of respiratory viral infection.
Performance characteristics for Influenza A Virus were established when
Influenza A/H3 and A/H1 were the predominant Influenza A viruses in
circulation (2006 – 2007 respiratory season). Performance characteristics for
Influenza A were confirmed when Influenza A/H1, Influenza A/H3, and Influenza
A/2009 H1N1 were the predominant Influenza A viruses in circulation (2008 and
2009). When other Influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics
may vary.
If infection with a novel Influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical
and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities,
specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for
novel virulent Influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for
testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+
facility is available to receive and culture specimens.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Roche MagNA Pure LC System with software version 3.0.11 or bioMérieux
NucliSENS easyMAG System with Software version 1.0.1 or 2.0. Cepheid
SmartCycler II Real Time Instrument with Dx software version 1.7b or 3.0 a/b.
I. Device Description:
The ProFlu+ Assay enables detection and differentiation of Influenza A Virus,
Influenza B Virus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (Types A and B), and Internal
Control.

An overview of the procedure is as follows:
1. Collect nasopharyngeal swab specimens from symptomatic patients using a
polyester, rayon or nylon tipped swab and place into viral transport medium (refer
to Materials Required but not Provided).
2. Add an Internal Control (IC) to every sample to monitor for inhibitors present in
the specimens.
3. Perform isolation and purification of nucleic acids using a MagNA Pure LC
System (Roche) and the MagNA Pure Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Roche) or
a NucliSENS easyMAG System (bioMérieux) and the Automated Magnetic
Extraction Reagents (bioMérieux).
4. Add purified nucleic acids to Influenza A/Influenza B/RSV Mix along with
enzymes included in the ProFlu+ Detection Kit. The Influenza A/Influenza
B/RSV Mix contains oligonucleotide primers and target-specific oligonucleotide
probes. The primers are complementary to highly conserved regions of genetic
sequences for these respiratory viruses. The probes are dual-labeled with a
reporter dye and a quencher (see table below).
5. Perform reverse transcription of RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) and
subsequent amplification of DNA in a Cepheid SmartCycler II instrument. In this
process, the probe anneals specifically to the template followed by primer
extension and amplification. The ProFlu+ Assay is based on Taqman reagent
chemistry, which utilizes the 5’ – 3’ exonuclease activity of the Taq polymerase to
cleave the probe thus separating the reporter dye from the quencher. This
generates an increase in fluorescent signal upon excitation from a light source.
With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved from their
respective probes, further increasing fluorescent signal. The amount of
fluorescence at any given cycle is dependent on the amount of amplification
products present at that time. Fluorescent intensity is monitored during each PCR
cycle by the real-time instrument.

L. Test Principle:
ProFlu+ assay enables detection and differentiation of Influenza A Virus, Influenza B
Virus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (Types A and B), and Internal Control.
Nucleic acids are isolated and purified from nasopharyngeal swab specimens using a
MagNA Pure LC System (Roche) and the MagNA Pure Total Nucleic Acid Isolation
Kit (Roche) or a NucliSENS easyMAG System (bioMérieux) and the Automated
Magnetic Extraction Reagents (bioMérieux). Purified nucleic acids are added to
Influenza A/Influenza B/RSV Mix along with enzymes included in the ProFlu+
Detection Kit. The Influenza A/Influenza B/RSV Mix contains oligonucleotide
primers and target-specific oligonucleotide probes. The primers are complementary to
highly conserved regions of genetic sequences for these respiratory viruses. The
8

--- Page 9 ---
probes are dual-labeled with a reporter dye and a quencher attached to the 3’ end or
internally.
First RNA is reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) which is then
subsequently amplified in a Cepheid SmartCycler II instrument. In this process, the
probe anneals specifically to the template followed by primer extension and
amplification. Taq polymerase cleaves the probe utilizing its 5’ – 3’ exonuclease
activity thus separating the reporter dye from the quencher. This generates an increase
in fluorescent signal upon excitation from a light source. With each cycle, additional
reporter dye molecules are cleaved from their respective probes, further increasing
fluorescent signal. The amount of fluorescence at any given cycle is dependent on the
amount of amplification products present at that time. Fluorescent intensity is
monitored during each PCR cycle by the real-time instrument.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Please refer to previously FDA-cleared 510(k) Premarket Notification, K092500
for additional information.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There are no changes to the controls for the New ProFlu+ Assay. Please refer to
previously FDA-cleared 510(k) Premarket Notification, K092500.
d. Detection limits:
The analytical sensitivity (limit of detection or LoD) of the ProFlu+ Assay was
determined using 6 Influenza A strains, 1 strain each of Influenza B, RSV A and
RSV B. Each viral strain was extracted using the Roche MagNA Pure LC
instrument and tested in replicates of 60 per concentration. Analytical sensitivity
(LoD) defined as the lowest concentration at which ≥ 95% of all replicates tested
positive are summarized in the table below. The LoDs for the reformulated
ProFlu+ Assay were identical to the original ProFlu+ Assay for all strains tested.

Cross Reactivity
The analytical specificity of the ProFlu+ Assay was evaluated by testing a panel
of 58 cultures consisting of 31 viral, 26 bacterial, and 1 yeast strain representing
common respiratory pathogens or flora commonly present in nasopharynx.
Bacteria and yeast were tested at concentrations of 105 to108 CFU/mL. Viruses
were tested at concentrations of 103 to 106 TCID /mL, except where noted.
50
Samples were extracted using the Roche MagNA Pure LC instrument and tested
in triplicate. Analytical specificity of the ProFlu+ Assay was 100%.

Reactivity
The reactivity of the ProFlu+ Assay was evaluated against multiple strains of
Influenza A, Influenza B, and Respiratory Syncytial Viruses. The panel consisted of
13 Influenza A subtype H1N1, 13 Influenza A subtype H3N2, 9 swine-origin
Influenza A, 2 Influenza A subtype H5N1, 10 Influenza B, and 2 Respiratory
Syncytial Virus strains. Each viral strain was extracted using the Roche MagNA Pure
LC and tested in triplicate in each assay.

Competitive Interference of the ProFlu+ Assay was evaluated using simulated
samples containing pairs of target viruses (Influenza A and Influenza B, Influenza
A and RSV, Influenza B and RSV) at two different concentrations. One of the
concentrations was near the Limit of Detection (LoD) while the other
concentration was 1000x the LoD. Samples were extracted using the Roche
MagNA Pure LC instrument and tested in triplicate. The presence of two viruses
at varying concentrations in a single sample had no effect on the analytical
sensitivity (limit of detection or LoD) of the ProFlu+ Assay.
g. Extraction equivalency:
Extraction equivalency of the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG and Roche
MagNA Pure LC instruments was evaluated by performing a limit of detection
study and a reproducibility study using both instrument systems. For the limit of
detection study, Influenza A, Influenza B, RSV A or RSV B virus was diluted
into NP swab matrix to the study’s limit of detection. Each viral strain dilution
was extracted in replicates of 10 on each automated extractor and tested using the
ProFlu+ Assay. For the reproducibility study, a panel of 6 simulated samples that
included medium and low (near the assay limit of detection) Influenza A and RSV
A positive and negative samples was tested. The panel was run on each
automated extractor 2 times per day for a total of 5 days.
The bioMérieux NucliSens easyMAG instrument performed equivalently to the
Roche MagNA Pure LC instrument with respect to limit of detection and
reproducibility (percent agreement). The limits of detection were the same for
both instruments and the overall reproducibility percent agreement was 100%.
h. Carry-over/Cross-Contamination
In an internal study there was no evidence of carry-over/cross contamination with
the ProFlu+ Assay using either the Roche MagNA Pure LC or the bioMériuex
NucliSens easyMAG automated nucleic acid extraction instruments.
2. Comparison studies:
Clinical Comparison Results
The ProFlu+ Assay’s supermix was reformulated and performance characteristics
were established by comparing the reformulated assay to the original ProFlu+
Assay. All samples positive for Influenza A, Influenza B or RSV using either the
current ProFlu+ Assay and/or the reformulated “New” ProFlu+ Assay were
confirmed using bidirectional sequencing. The sequencing assays targeted either a
different gene than the ProFlu+ Assay or targeted a different region of the same
gene as the ProFlu+ Assay. Prospectively collected archived samples from
respiratory season years 2008 and 2009 that were collected at two clinical study
sites (Columbus, OH and Albuquerque, NM) were used for this study.

“True” influenza A, influenza B or RSV positives were considered as any sample
that tested positive for the respective analyte by the original ProFlu+ Assay.
“True” influenza A, influenza B or RSV negatives were considered as any sample
that tested negative by the original ProFlu+ Assay.

3. Clinical studies:
Clinical performance characteristics of the ProFlu+ Assay were established during
a prospective study at 3 U.S. clinical laboratories and a retrospective study at 1
U.S. site during the 2006-2007 respiratory virus season (February – April).

The prevalence of Influenza and RSV varies each year with epidemics occurring
during the fall and winter months in the US. Variables that affect the rate of
positivity observed in respiratory testing include: the efficiency and timing of
specimen collection, handling and transport of the specimen, the time of year, age
of the patient, and local disease prevalence. During the 2006-2007 U.S.
respiratory season, the combined prevalence of Influenza A and Influenza B was
13.2%8 and in 2005-2006 the combined prevalence was 12.1%9. The prevalence
of RSV during the 2005-2006 season was 16.2%10. In the 2007 ProFlu+ multi-
center clinical study (samples collected between February and April), the
prevalence as observed with culture of Influenza A was 15.8%, Influenza B was
5.4% and RSV was 4.2%. As influenza and RSV seasons overlap, dual positive
infections can occur. During this study, culture and the ProFlu+ Assay each
detected one Influenza A and RSV dual-positive (although not the same sample)
and the ProFlu+ Assay detected one Influenza A and Influenza B dual-positive
out of the 891 total samples included in the study. Because the incidence of a
triple infection of Influenza A, Influenza B, and RSV is low, it is recommended
that the samples undergo repeat testing if nucleic acids from all three analytes are
detected in a single sample.
The performance of the modified ProFlu+ assay has been demonstrated using a
subset of archived prospectively collected clinical samples from 2008 - 2009
influenza seasons. They were selected to include 20 Influenza A 2009 H1N1, 20
Influenza A H1, 20 Influenza A H3, 10 Influenza B, 10 RSV positive and 121
negative samples.
N. Instrument Name:
Roche MagNA Pure LC System with software version 3.0.11 or bioMérieux
NucliSENS easyMAG System with Software version 1.0.1 or 2.0. Cepheid
SmartCycler II Real Time Instrument with Dx software version 1.7b or 3.0 a/b.
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Roche MagNA Pure LC is an automated nucleic acid isolation and
purification system based upon binding of nucleic acids to glass particles and has
the capability to process a total of 32 reactions within one run. Nucleic acid is
purified in multiple plastic reaction tips and cartridges by several steps that
include cell lysis and binding of nucleic acid to magnetic glass particles, wash
steps, and a heated elution to unbind the nucleic acid from the glass particles.
The bioMérieux NucliSens easyMAG is an automated nucleic acid isolation and
purification system that is based upon the same silica extraction technology as the
MagNA Pure. The easyMAG is capable of processing a total of 24 reactions with
variable sample types, sample volumes, and elution volumes within a single run.

Nucleic acid is purified within a single cartridge by several steps that include lysis
and binding of nucleic acid to high affinity magnetic silica beads, a series of wash
steps and heated elution of purified nucleic acid from the silica beads.
The Cepheid Smart Cycler II Real Time instrument with Dx software version
1.7b, 3.0a/b is used to perform polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification
and detection of nucleic acid. Other nucleic acid amplification tests that use the
Smart Cycler II instrument have previously received 510(k) clearance: these tests
include Prodesse’s ProFAST+ Assay (K101855), ProParaflu+ Assay (K091053),
ProGastro Cd Assay (K090239), ProhMPV+ Assay (K082688) and others. The
Cepheid SmartCycler instrument is an integrated nucleic acid amplification and
detection instrument system based on Cepheid’s proprietary microprocessor-
controlled I-CORE module. For purified DNA samples, the SmartCycler
instrument enables PCR for the amplification of DNA and hybridization of
fluorogenic target-specific probes for the detection of the amplified cDNA.

6. Quality Control:
Positive Control (PC): The ProFlu+ Assay Control kit contains four RNA controls
that consist of non-infectious in vitro transcribed RNA of specific Influenza A,
Influenza B, RSV A or RSV B viral sequences. The PC does not go through
nucleic acid isolation and purification, but is included with each RT-PCR run. The
PC in conjunction with the IC is used to test for procedural errors in order to
verify reagent and system performance.
Internal Control (IC): The IC is a non-infectious RNA transcript that is
distinguished from the viral targets of the assay by means of a unique IC primer
and probe set present in the ProFlu+ Assay. The IC is incorporated into every
16

--- Page 17 ---
sample and is carried through all steps of the procedure from nucleic acid
isolation and purification through amplification to monitor for inhibitors present
in the specimen or reaction tube. The IC also serves as a general process control
ensuring that each step of the procedure was performed correctly, assay and
instrument parameters were set correctly, and that general reagents were working.
Negative Control (NC): A Negative Control is not provided with the kit, but is
required and described in the ProFlu+ Assay Instructions for Use. Viral transport
medium spiked with the IC is to be used as the Negative Control and is processed
starting from nucleic acid isolation. The Negative Control serves to monitor for
contamination.
