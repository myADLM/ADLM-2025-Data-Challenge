L. Test Principle:
The LabonaCheck A1c is a boronate affinity assay. When blood is added to the R1 reagent,
the erythrocytes immediately lyse and all hemoglobin is precipitated. The boronic acid
conjugate binds to the cis-diol configuration of glycated hemoglobin. An aliquot of the
reaction mixture is added to the cartridge and all the precipitated hemoglobin, conjugate-
bound and unbound, remains on top of the filter. Any unbound boronate is removed with the

and the red (total hemoglobin) color intensity respectively with LabonaCheck A1c HbA1c
analyzer, the ratio between them being proportional to the percentage of HbA1c in the
sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
An internal precision study was conducted using venous blood samples at 5 different
HbA1c concentrations over the measuring range of the device. Samples were
analyzed twice/day for 20 days using 2 analyzers and two lots of test cartridges
(n=80). Results were as follows:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Two samples with values of 3.2% and 17.5% HbA1c were mixed in varying
proportions to make 7 test samples spanning the measuring range of the device.
Testing was performed using two lots of test kits. HbA1c recoveries of the observed
versus the expected concentrations were 100-108% across the measuring range.
Linear regression is:
y=0.968x+0.238, r2=0.999
The claimed measuring range for the LabonaCheck™ A1c is 4.0 – 15% HbA1c.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls- External control materials are purchased separately. Control materials were
previously cleared under k043070.
The labeling states that venous whole blood samples can be stored up to 7 days at 2-
8˚C
Traceability-The LabonaCheck™ A1c is certified with the National
Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP). The NGSP certification expires
in one year. See NGSP website for current certification at http://www.ngsp.org.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined by assaying
a zero sample (blank) and five low HbA1c samples according to CLSI guideline
EP17-A. Each sample was assayed twice a day in replicates of ten (n=60) for three
days on LabonaCheck™ A1c.
LoB= 3.1%, LoD=3.3%
The claimed measuring range, 4% -15% HbA1c, is based on linearity. See 1b. above
e. Analytical specificity:
Studies were performed to assess common or known substances that could interfere
with the assay. Whole blood samples with A1c% concentrations of 4.5%, 8.5%, and
11.1% were evaluated in duplicate at a low and high level for each interferent.
Observed A1c% values were compared to the control samples whose A1c% was
determined by a NGSP certified method. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion is ≤10%
bias between the test and the control samples. Results are summarized below:

Hemoglobin Variant Interference
Cross-reactivity to hemoglobin variants was examined using patient samples
containing known concentrations of HbA1c and each variant. The variants and the
ranges in which they were tested are as follows: HbA0, HbA1a, HbA1b, HbF, HbC,
HbD, HbE and HbS. Each sample was tested in duplicate, and the difference between
the known concentration of the reference analyzer (Trinity (Primus) Boronate
Affinity HPLC) and the values obtained with the LabonaCheck™ A1c device were
calculated.
No significant bias of greater than ±10% was observed in the presence of HbA0,
HbA1a, Hba1b, HbC, HbD, HbE or HbS.
The labeling states “Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF) consists of two alpha and two gamma
chains that are not recognized by the anti-HbA1c antibody. Samples that contain high
amounts of HbF (>22.7%), usually found in some people with thalassemia, in infants,
and in some pregnant women, may yield a lower than expected HbA1c result with
this assay.”
Carbamylated Hemoglobin Interference
An interference study was performed to assess the affect of carbamylated A1c with
the LabonaCheck™A1c assay. Whole blood pools were prepared to create a low
(~4.7 – 5.4% HbA1c ), a medium (~7.2 – 8.0 % HbA1c) and a high (~10.6 – 10.9 %
