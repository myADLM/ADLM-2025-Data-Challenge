Colorimetric method based on that described by Jendrassik and Grof (1938). Total bilirubin
is determined in the presence of caffeine, which releases albumin bound bilirubin, by the
reaction with diazotized sulphanilic acid.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Inter-assay precision:
Precision studies were performed with three serum samples at three different
concentrations of bilirubin, on two separate Poly-Chem 90 instruments, over 10
days. Samples were tested in duplicate twice a day (N=20). Results are
summarized in the table below:

concentrations of bilirubin on two instruments. Twenty replicates of each sample
were tested within one instrument run. Results are summarized in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of bilirubin on the Poly-Chem 90 system was tested by mixing human
serum containing the analyte (0.07-30.90 mg/dL) to obtain 9 concentrations of
bilirubin. All samples were tested in triplicate on the Poly-Chem 90 analyzer and
generated a linear regression correlation of the following:
Slope: 0.996
Intercept: - 0.091
The linearity studies support the sponsor’s claimed measuring range of 0.1-27.5
mg/dL
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Bilirubin test is traceable to an internal master.
The master calibrator is traceable to NIST#916 based on diazo sulphanic acid and
DPD methods.
d. Detection limit:
A limit of detection study was performed according to the CLSI EP17-A guideline.
LoB was conducted using a blank sample measured 60 times and was calculated to be
0.0043 mg/dL. LoD and LoQ were conducted using five serum samples containing
very low concentrations of bilirubin tested in replicates of three over four days. LoQ
is defined as the concentration at which inter-assay precision is ≤10% CV. LoD was
calculated to be 0.0184 mg/dL and the LoQ is 0.08 mg/dL.
The sponsor’s claimed measuring range of the device is 0.1 to 27.5 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
An endogenous interfering substances study was performed according to the CLSI
EP7-A guideline. Serum samples containing the analyte at three levels (low, medium
and high) of the test were spiked with the potentially interfering substance—
hemoglobin and triglyceride—to several concentrations. Samples were then run in
triplicate using the Poly-Chem 90 test. The recovery of the test at each concentration
of interferents was calculated by comparing the mean result of testing with no
interferents to the mean result at each level tested. The sponsor defines non-
significant interference as bias <10% between the spiked and unspiked samples. The
highest level tested with no significant interference is listed in the table below.
