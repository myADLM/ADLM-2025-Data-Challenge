Device Name: cobas® b 123 POC System
The cobas b 123 POC system is a fully automated POC system for whole blood in vitro
measurement of pH, blood gases (BG), electrolytes Na+, K+, iCa2+ (ISE), hematocrit
(Hct), metabolites (Glu, Lac), total hemoglobin (tHb), hemoglobin derivatives (O Hb,
2
HHb, COHb, MetHb), and oxygen saturation (SO ). In addition, the cobas b 123 POC
2
system calculates derived parameters.
It is dedicated for use in a Point-of-Care environment and laboratory. The integrated
AutoQC module and the oximeter module are available as an option.
pH, pO and pCO : pH, pO and pCO measurements are used in the diagnosis and
2 2 2 2
treatment of life-threatening acid-base disturbances.
Sodium (Na+): sodium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of
aldosteronism, diabetes insipidus, adrenal hypertension, Addison's disease, dehydration,
inappropriate antidiuretic secretion, or other diseases involving electrolyte imbalance.
Potassium (K+): potassium measurements are used to monitor electrolyte balance in the
diagnosis and treatment of disease conditions characterized by low or high blood
potassium levels.
Calcium (Ca2+): calcium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of
parathyroid disease, a variety of bone diseases, chronic renal disease and tetany
(intermittent muscular contractions or spasms).
Hematocrit (Hct): hematocrit measurements are used to distinguish normal from
abnormal states of whole blood, such as anemia and erythrocytosis (an increase in the
number of red cells).
Glucose (Glu): glucose measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of
carbohydrate metabolism disorders including diabetes mellitus and idiopathic
hypoglycemia, and of pancreatic islet cell carcinoma.
Lactate (Lac): Lactate measurements are used to evaluate the acid-base status and are
used in the diagnosis and treatment of lactic acidosis (abnormally high acidity of the
blood.)
Total Hemoglobin (tHb): total hemoglobin measurements are used to measure the
hemoglobin content of whole blood for the detection of anemia.
O Hb: oxyhemoglobin as a fraction of total hemoglobin.

COHb: carboxyhemoglobin measurements are used to determine the carboxyhemoglobin
content of human blood as an aid in the diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning.

potential against which other potential differences can be measured.
Amperometry is used to measure glucose, lactate, and pO2. For this method of
measurement, the magnitude of an electrical flow of current proportional to the
concentration of the substance being oxidized or reduced at an electrode results in a
measurement of glucose, lactate, and pO2 in the blood.
Spectrophotometry is used to measure the analytes: tHb, SO2, O2Hb, HHb, COHb,
MetHb. For this method, light passes through the blood samples; specific
wavelengths are absorbed and their intensity generates an absorption spectrum used
to calculate oximetry parameters.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
All performance studies were conducted on the cobas b 123 POC system.

tonometered whole blood samples in duplicate in two runs per day for 20 days
(N=80). Testing was conducted using the cobas b 123 POC syringe mode.

Whole blood precision study (capillary mode):
An additional precision study was conducted following guidance from CLSI
EP5-A2. Whole blood was collected for use in an “in-house” precision study
and utilized twenty (20) cobas b 123 POC analyzers, two sensor lots, samples
tested in one run per day, in two replicates, and with samples at three
clinically significant concentrations. The following tables present a summary
of results:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was designed based on CLSI EP6 guidance for each analyte.
Samples were prepared by spiking 10 different levels of analyte into whole
blood for each of the analyte tested. Each sample concentration was
tonometered to the expected concentrations prior to running samples on the
candidate device. Samples were tested in a single run in replicates of 5 on a
single instrument. The observed values were plotted against expected values.
Results of this study are summarized in the following table:

Stability:
Shelf life Stability Study:
For this study, three lots of sensor cartridges (BG/ISE/Glu/Lac) were
evaluated using five sensors from each lot. Each sensor lot was stored at 2 – 8
ºC and after 4 months the following materials were tested in singlet: Quality
Control (QC) material, Calibration Verification Control material, plasma, and
whole blood. The results of the study supports the shelf life stability claim of
up to 4 months based on real-time testing on three lots for the sensor
cartridges.
Shelf life Stability Study (Fluid pack):
For this study, the fluid pack was stored at 15 – 25ºC and tested at the
following time intervals: T= 0, 6, 9, and 13 months. Each result obtained at
each time point was compared back to baseline (t=0). The results of the study
support a shelf life of 9 months when stored unopened at 15 - 25ºC.
On-board stability study:
Six sensor (BG/ISE/Glu/Lac) cartridge lots were stored on-board the system at
37 ºC. Three quality control levels were tested at regular time intervals over a
total of 28 days.
The results of the study support an on-board stability of the following:
Stability of up to 28 days at 37ºC for BG (blood gas sensor cartridges)
Stability of up to 28 days at 30ºC for glucose (sensor cartridges) and ISE (ion
selective electrode sensor cartridges)
Stability of up to 21 days at 30ºC for lactate sensor cartridges.
On-board stability study (fluid pack):
A study was conducted evaluating the cobas b 123 fluid pack which contains
five components: calibration solution 1, calibration solution 2, standby
solution, reference solution, and sol-wet solution. The fluid pack’s stability
was carried out at 32ºC for 42 days. This study supports the on-board stability
claim of 42 days.
Value Assignment for Roche AUTOTROL 123:
For lot- specific value assignment, each autoQC pack (containing 8 ampoules
per level, 5 of the new lot and 3 of the reference lot) were tested in two runs

d. Detection limit:
Refer to the linearity study data above in M.2.b. for the detection limits claim
for all analytes. In addition, the sponsor conducted a Limit of Blank (LoB),
Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) study following
the CLSI EP – 17A guideline for the following analytes: Glucose, ICa, and
Lactate. To determine LoB, zero level samples were prepared and measured
on ten cobas b 123 POC instruments to obtain blank measurements (N=60).
To determine the LoD and LoQ, whole blood samples with low levels of
analyte (approximately 4 x LoB) were measured on ten instruments (N=200).
The LoQ was determined based on the inter-assay precision (%CV). Results
of the study are presented in the following table:

e. Analytical specificity:
The interference study was performed according to the CLSI guideline EP7-A2. The
study used spiked and diluted human whole blood samples containing potential
interferents for pH, pO2, pCO2, sodium, potassium, calcium, Hct, tHb, O2Hb, HHb,
COHb, MetHb, SO2, lactic acid, and glucose. Each sample containing interferent was
evaluated against a reference whole blood sample without interferent. The following

Additional interference study testing the following analytes at two levels (low and high)
against additional potential interferents was performed. The following is a summary of
what was tested:
Na+, K+, and Ca2+: potential interference with benzalkonium, thiocyanate, salicylate,
bromide, iodide
Glucose and Lactate: potential interference with uric acid, ascorbic acid, acetaminophen,
dopamine, sodium fluoride, and oxalate
pO2: potential interference with nitrous oxide, halothane, and isoflurane
The results of this adjunctive study showed that there was interference with
benzalkonium chloride at low and high sodium concentrations.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A multi-center clinic evaluation consisting of a total of six clinics ( 2
laboratory and 4 point-of-care sites) was conducted for the following analytes:
pO2, pCO2, pH, Na, K, Ca, Hct, Glucose, Lactate, tHb, O2Hb, HHb, COHb,
MetHb, and SO2. Method comparison studies were performed using Roche
cobas b 123 and other commercially available devices. In order to cover the
hard-to-find sample range, an internal method comparison study was
performed using some altered samples that span the entire claimed measuring
ranges for all the analytes. Singlet set of data was used for the linear
regression analysis. Results are summarized in the table below:
