L. Test Principle:
The CELL-DYN 22 Plus Calibrator was designed to calibrate the Abbott CELL-DYN
Emerald 22 instrument. The assayed values are traceable to reference methods. The
product is for in-vitro diagnostic use to calibrate WBC, RBC, HGB, MCV, and PLT.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision performance: Data was collected internally and at two external sites
across seven different CELL-DYN Emerald 22 instruments with multiple
operators using 3 lots of CELL-DYN 22 Plus Calibrator. The external sites
performed 10 consecutive runs across two different instruments with separate
vials of calibrator from each lot. Internally, Streck performed 10 consecutive
runs per lot across three instruments. The acceptance criteria are based on a
compilation of the %CV for each measurand. All %CV values were within

Run-to-run precision was evaluated in a 10-run repeatability study performed
with each calibrator lot and with a fresh whole blood sample collected in
K EDTA. Parameter specific SDs and CVs reported with whole blood were
2
compared to those reported with three individual lots of the calibrator.
Repeatability attributes of the CELL-DYN 22Plus Calibrator parallel those
reported with fresh whole blood with %CV values within acceptable limits..
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Value assignment: A minimum of three vials were tested on the CELL-DYN
Emerald 22 instruments. Duplicate testing on each vial was performed
consecutively for a minimum of three test events performed on different dates.
The data were entered into the validated QC link database program to
calculate the mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation for each
parameter analyzed. Final assay assignment values were determined using
data collected and established product performance characteristics. Expected
range values assigned to the assay were based on the standard deviation of the
assay data. Assay values were assigned to the calibrator based on ±2.5 SD for
each measurand.
Open vial stability: A 5-day open-vial stability claim was verified using three
lots of the CELL-DYN 22 Plus Calibrator. Each lot was tested on days 1, 5
and at minimum one intermediate time interval.
Closed vial stability: A 45-day closed-vial stability claim was verified using
three lots of the CELL-DYN 22 Plus Calibrator. Each lot was tested at a
minimum every 14 days over a minimum period of 45 days.
The acceptance criteria for open and closed vial stability is based on a
compilation of the %CV for each measurand over the data collected across 7
different CELL-DYN Emerald 22 instruments, at 3 sites, throughout the
product dating claim. Reported %CV for each measurand was within the
threshold value (< 10% CV).
