H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use:
MicroScan® Panels are designed for use in determining quantitative and/or
qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies grown on solid media of
aerobic streptococci including S. pneumoniae.
2. Indications for use:
The MicroScan® MICroSTREP plus Panels are used to determine quantitative
and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies grown on solid
media of aerobic streptococci including S. pneumoniae. After inoculation, panels
are incubated for 20- 24 hours at 35ºC +/- 1ºC in a non-CO incubator, and read

concentrations 0.03 to 8µg/mL to the test panel.
The organisms which may be used for susceptibility testing in this panel are:
Streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin resistant strains)
Streptococcus pyogenes
Streptococcus agalactiae
Streptococcus constellatus
Streptococcus anginosus
Viridans group streptococci
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
• For prescription use only

I. Device Description:
The antimicrobial susceptibility tests are miniaturizations of the broth dilution
susceptibility test that have been diluted in water and dehydrated. The antimicrobial
agent is diluted in water, buffer or minute concentrations of broth to concentrations
bridging the range of clinical interest. Panels are rehydrated with 115μl Mueller-
Hinton broth supplemented with 3% lysed horse blood (LHB), after inoculation of the
broth with a standardized suspension of the organism. After incubation in a non-CO2
incubator for 20-24 hours, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the test
organism is manually read by observing the lowest antimicrobial concentration
showing inhibition of growth. Alternatively, the panel can be incubated in and read
by the MicroScan® WalkAway System.

L. Test Principle:
The antimicrobial susceptibility tests are miniaturizations of the broth dilution
susceptibility test that have been diluted in water and dehydrated. The antimicrobial
agent is diluted in water, buffer or minute concentrations of broth to concentrations
bridging the range of clinical interest. Panels are rehydrated with 115 μl Mueller-
Hinton broth supplemented with 3% lysed horse blood (LHB), after inoculation of the
broth with a standardized suspension of the organism. After incubation in a non-CO2
incubator for 20-24 hours, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the test
organism is manually read by observing the lowest antimicrobial concentration
showing inhibition of growth. Alternatively, the panel can be incubated in and read
by the MicroScan® WalkAway System.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using 10 isolates tested at three sites on three
separate days in triplicate. The study included the turbidity inoculum method with
reading performed manually, by WalkAway instrument. Both within site and site
to site results were >95% reproducible.

WalkAway; however, there were more results in the plus category by the manual
method.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended QC isolate, S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 was tested a
sufficient number of times with acceptable results most of the time with the
reference method. Quality control results demonstrated the ability of the
different reading parameters (manual, and WalkAway) by Turbidity
inoculation methods to produce acceptable results.
The following table provides the frequency of the results in each
concentration with the expected range stated.

*This quality control range is applicable only to broth microdilution susceptibility tests
using cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth with 2 - 5% lysed horse blood.
Inoculum density control: A turbidity meter was used for the turbidity
inoculation method. Inoculum density was controlled by monitoring the daily
results of the MicroScan® Turbidity Meter to ensure the correct final
concentration of the organisms for both the reference and test device.

tested at one site and compared to the reference broth dilution result mode that
was determined by previous testing of each isolate multiple times in the
recommended reference panel. All isolates grew in the MICroStrep panels.
Efficacy testing was performed using the turbidity inoculation method and
read manually after incubation for 20- 24 hours at 35ºC +/- 1ºC in a non-CO

incubator. A comparison to the reference method was provided with the
following agreement.

EA is when there is agreement between the reference method and the new method is within plus
or minus one serial two-fold dilution of antibiotic. Category agreement (CA) is when the new
method result interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result interpretation.
Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the new method and the reference
method and have on-scale EA.
The performance of the alternate MicroScan® WalkAway System (incubation
and read methods) was demonstrated in challenge, quality control, and
reproducibility studies with acceptable results.
