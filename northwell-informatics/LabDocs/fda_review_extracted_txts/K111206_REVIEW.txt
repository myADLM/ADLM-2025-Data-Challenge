K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
ASTM F1980-07, Standard Guide for Accelerated Aging of Sterile Barrier Systems
for Medical Devices
L. Test Principle:
The test principle of the strip is based on coupled enzymatic reactions that take place
on the pad to visualize the BAC. The first reaction is an oxidation reaction where the
ethanol in the saliva is coupled with alcohol oxidase and converted into an aldehyde
and peroxide. In the second reaction, tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) is oxidized with
the peroxide from the first reaction, with peroxidase acting as the catalyst. TMB is
the color indicator substrate, and the degree of color change corresponds to the
amount of ethanol present in the saliva.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The imprecision of the device was evaluated by reading known spiked alcohol
concentrations on three lots of strips, with 20 replicates from each lot and read
over 3 days. The alcohol concentrations were confirmed with a clinical
chemistry analyzer. The strips were read by trained technicians under

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. The device is semi-quantitative and does not report a
numerical concentration.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor states that the cutoffs are verified during manufacturing using
ethanol solutions with known concentrations verified by a clinical chemistry
analyzer.
The sponsor provided results from an accelerated stability study to verify the
claimed shelf life of 18 months for the strips when stored at 2 – 8o C. The
protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
Real-time stability studies are ongoing.
d. Detection limit:
To assess the possibility of false positives, the sponsor performed a study
analyzing alcohol-free (0% BAC) saliva samples. Each of 10 samples was
analyzed 10 times for a total n of 100. There were no false positives observed
when measuring zero concentration samples.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed studies to evaluate the effect of substances which may
be present in the saliva sample as well as a range of lighting and temperature
conditions.
Substances that are consumed or used orally:
The sponsor evaluated the effect of cigarette smoke, chewing tobacco,
mouthwash, chewing gum, cough syrup, and breath spray on the assay. For each
potential interferent, samples were collected from ten volunteers, of which
five were drinkers and five were non-drinkers. Results were read at 1 minute
and 10 minutes after consumption or use of the potential interferents.
Samples were read by untrained laypersons. There were no false positives or
false negatives when samples were read at 10 minutes after use or
consumption of the potential interferent. False positives were observed for
cigarette smoke, chewing tobacco, and mouthwash when read at one minute.
The labeling specifies that users should not consume anything or have
anything in the mouth for at least ten minutes prior to use.

Volatile Substances:
The sponsor conducted a study to assess the potential for positive or negative
interference from volatile substances. The volatile substance was spiked into
alcohol-free saliva samples and samples with alcohol concentrations of 0.02,
0.04, 0.08, and 0.30 % BAC. No interference was seen for acetone, 2-butanol,
glycerol, or isopropanol at the concentrations listed below.
Concentration at which no
Volatile Substance
interference was observed
Acetone 1.000%
2-Butanol 1.000%
Glycerol 1.000%
Isopropanol 1.000%
Methanol was found to cause positive interference at a concentration as low as
0.001 %. The Limitations section of the labeling states that the assay is for
the detection of ethanol and that other alcohols may cause positive results if
present in the saliva sample.
Temperature:
The effect of temperature on the device was evaluated by reading known spiked
alcohol concentrations at 2-8°C, 27°C, and 40°C on three lots of strips, with 5
replicates from each lot and read over 3 days. The strips were read by trained
technicians under fluorescent light. There were no deviations from the
expected results.

Lighting:
The effect of lighting on the device was evaluated by reading known spiked alcohol
concentrations in daylight, and under fluorescent, incandescent, and mercury vapor
lighting, The study used three lots of strips, with 5 replicates from each lot and read
over 3 days. The strips were read by trained technicians. There were no deviations
from the expected results.

f. Assay cut-off:
Each device provides cutoffs at 0.02%, 0.04%, 0.08%, and 0.30% BAC
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor conducted a consumer study comparing their device to results from
the predicate Mission Saliva Alcohol Test Strip.
The study included 25 participants designated as the alcohol-drinkers and 25
naïve non-alcohol drinkers designated as the readers. Each drinker provided a
negative saliva sample and then consumed varying amounts of alcohol after
which saliva samples were tested at 10 minute intervals for a total of 6 samples
per drinker. A total of 20 additional samples were spiked with alcohol to achieve
concentrations > 0.08% BAC. Therefore a total of 195 strips were read for this

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Using these types of devices, alcohol is not detectable in the saliva of persons
who have not ingested alcohol.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
