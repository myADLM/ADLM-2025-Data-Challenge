M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Run-to-run repeatability was performed using three lots of the CELL-DYN 22
Plus Control. Repeatability was tested using 10 consecutive runs per vial of
each level of control using the CELL-DYN Emerald 22 instrument. All
associated data recovered within the parameter specific assay range
assignments with %CV values within acceptable limits.
Run-to-run repeatability was also evaluated by direct comparison with fresh
whole blood: Repeatability was assessed in 10 runs using a fresh K EDTA
2
whole blood sample. Parameter specific SD and %CV were compared to
those reported with normal levels of three lots of the CELL-DYN 22 Plus
Control. Results from the whole blood run show that the precision attributes
are comparable and parallel those of the three lots of the normal control with
%CV values within acceptable limits.
Precision performance: Data was collected internally and at two external sites
across seven different CELL-DYN Emerald 22 instruments with multiple
operators using 3 lots of CELL-DYN 22 Plus Controls. The external sites
performed 10 consecutive runs across two different instruments with separate
vials of control from each lot. Internally, Streck ran 10 consecutive runs per
lot across three instruments. The acceptance criteria is based on a compilation
of the %CV for each measurand. All %CV values were within the acceptable
threshold value as shown below,

three test events on different dates, yielding a minimum of nine data points.
Off-site laboratories ran each vial in duplicate consecutively generating a
minimum of six data points. The data were entered into the validated QC link
database program to calculate the mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of
variation for each parameter analyzed. Final assay assignment values were
determined using data collected and established product performance
characteristics. Expected range values assigned to the assay were based on
±3SD of the assay data.
Open vial stability: The 8-day open vial stability claim was verified using
three lots of the CELL-DYN 22 Plus Control. Each vial was mixed and
opened daily to effectively simulate customer usage. Each level was tested
using the CELL-DYN Emerald instrument on days 1 and 8, and a minimum of
two intermediate time intervals.
Closed vial stability: A 75-day closed vial stability claim was verified using
three lots of the CELL-DYN 22 Plus Control. Each level was tested using the
CELL-DYN Emerald instrument at minimum every 14 days over a minimum
period of 75 days.
The acceptance criteria for both open and closed vial stability is based on a
compilation of the %CV for each measurand over the data collected across 7
different CELL-DYN Emerald 22 instruments, at 3 sites, throughout the
product dating claim. Reported %CV for each measurand was within the
threshold value (< 10% CV).
