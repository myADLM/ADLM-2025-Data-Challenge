analyzes the intensity and color of light reflected from the reagent areas of a urinalysis
reagent strip. The analyzer throughput is 500 tests per hour and the measuring cycle is 7
seconds per test. The analyzer stores up to 2,000 patient records and prints the results in
Conventional, SI, or arbitrary units using an integrated internal or external thermal printer.
The Mission U500 is able to recall and display measurements from memory on the LCD
display. It also has a serial interface (RS232) for connection to a computer or barcode reader
(model U211-111), and a parallel interface for connection to an external printer. The Mission
U500 uses the following compatible formats of the Mission Urinalysis Reagent Test Strips

The Mission U500 reports the semi-quantitative or qualitative ranges listed below for each
test parameter on the reagent strips.
The ranges for pH, protein, and urobilinogen differ between the Mission U500 and the
visually read test strips. The analyzer can distinguish pH of 5.5 and 8.5 whereas the visual
reading cannot. The sponsor provided data showing that the device can read 5.5 and 8.5
below in sections M.1.b and M.1.d. In addition, the analyzer does not read protein above 300
mg/dL, glucose above 1000 mg/dL, or urobilinogen above 8 mg/dL. These differences have
been included in the labeling.

L. Test Principle:
The Mission U500 contains a Central Control Unit and Photoelectric Scanning Unit. When
the urine test strip is recognized by a sensor, the strip feed motor transports the strip to a
platform where it is adjusted for testing. Test strips are analyzed in the Photoelectric
Scanning Unit by reflectance photometry at 525 nm and 635 nm. The signal is amplified and
converted by an A/D converter. From there, the signal is sent to the Central Control Unit.
The Central Control Unit functions include sending, receiving, storing and processing
signals, and coordinating operation of every component of the analyzer.
The user operates the device via a touch screen which is used for all operations and for
displaying test results.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within run precision studies were performed by the sponsor using 2 commercially
available urine controls at negative and positive ranges, and an ascorbic acid standard.
The study was performed with three lots of urine test strips on three analyzers.
Testing was performed in 10 replicates for each control level, for each lot, and on
each analyzer for 10 days (n=300 per device). Within run and total precision for each
device was 100% exact agreement. The results are summarized below:

Precision studies were also performed by the two intended users at three point-of-care
sites using 3 levels of contrived samples on 3 Mission U500 with 3 lots of test strips.
Each operator tested contrived samples at three levels: negative, low positive and
high positive using the Mission U500 and the ACON U120. Ascorbic acid was
prepared in negative urine and spiked to the target concentrations. The contrived
samples consisted of a set of coded samples with 3 target values for each analyte at
negative, low positive (with the expected result “+/- to +”), and high positive (with
the expected result “2+ to 3+”), or 3 target values at low, middle and high for
specific gravity. For pH, all contrived solutions were prepared without pH
adjustment, with pH range from 5.5 to 7. Results with pH from 2 solutions were
analyzed with pH 5.5 and 7. Testing was conducted twice a day for 20 days. Total of
40 replicates for each level of the solution were performed by each operator (n=240).
Precision was evaluated as follows for each color block:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor validated the reportable range for each color block by using negative
urine samples spiked with commercially available reagents to the specific
concentrations corresponding to the color chart for each of the 11 analytes on the
Mission Urinalysis Reagent Strips. The negative urine samples and the spiked
positive samples (except ascorbic acid, pH and specific gravity) were confirmed by
Bayer Multistix 10 SG Reagent Strips and the Bayer Clinitek U500 Urine Analyzer.
The concentration of ascorbic acid was confirmed with the predicate, the ACON
U120 Urine Analyzer.
Each sample was tested with three lots of Mission Urinalysis Reagent Strips and 3
Mission® U500 Urine Analyzers. Each sample was tested in 5 replicates with each
lot of urine test strips and analyzer for three consecutive days following the product
insert. A total of 135 strips were used for each concentration tested (3 Analyzers x 3
days x 5 strips x 3 lot strips = 135 strips). Sensitivity was calculated as the number of
exact color block on the Mission U500 / the total number of samples tested at the
same expected value X 100%. Sensitivity was also calculated for within ± 1 color
block using the same formula above, except tabulating the number of samples within
1 color block. All results matched 100% between the new device and the expected
results across the measuring range for each test pad. The measuring range for each
assay is listed below in semi-quantitative and qualitative units. pH was confirmed by

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Mission U500 performs a “self-test” and calibration each time it is turned on.
Each time a test is run the analyzer re-calibrates using a white plastic calibration bar
located at the bottom of the analyzer optical system. Reflectance measurements from
the bar must match the factory set calibration.
Temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated for the test strips and
the analyzer at temperatures ranging from -2°C to 45°C for the analyzer and 15°C to
30°C for the test strips and relative humidity from 10% to 90%. Extreme
temperatures and humidity conditions combinations were tested as follows:

Protocol and acceptance criteria were provided and found to be acceptable. The
results supported the sponsor’s claimed operating temperature for the Mission U500
analyzer of -2° C to 45° C (28.4° F to 113° F) with relative humidity ranging from
10-90% and test strip operating conditions of 15-30° C (59° F to 86° F) and relative
humidity range from 10% to 90%.
Stability studies for the Mission Urinalysis Reagent Strips were conducted in
k061559.
No urinalysis controls are provided with the device. The sponsor recommends using
commercially available positive and negative controls. Labeling also recommends
the following:
· That two levels of commercially available controls are analyzed following
laboratory policies and local, state and federal guidelines.
· Test commercially available positive and negative quality controls with each
new lot, each new shipment of strips, and when a new bottle of reagent strips
is opened.
· Test the strips monthly that are stored for more than 30 days.
· Run QC tests to ensure reagent storage integrity; train new users; confirm test
performance; and when patients’ clinical conditions or symptoms do not
match the results obtained on the test strips.
d. Detection limit:
Expected cutoffs for each color block were determined by adding the expected values
of the color block and the immediate lower color block and dividing by 2. The
analytical sensitivity for each color block was determined by using commercially
available materials and preparing standard solutions in negative human urine at the
expected cutoff concentration for each color block. Aliquots of each sample were
then diluted to 110% and 90% of the cutoff. The analytical sensitivity for each color
block for each analyte is defined by the sponsor as the lowest concentration at which
over 55% of the test results are positive. If less than 55% positive results are
achieved at 110% or 90% cutoff, then samples were diluted until > 55% sensitivity
were obtained. Further dilutions were made for ascorbic acid, glucose, bilirubin,
ketone, blood, protein, urobilinogen, and leukocytes. See the tables below.

change from the minimum concentration (5 and 1.000) to the next higher
concentrations, the sponsor spiked urine with commercially available reagents to

1.005 for specific gravity. The solutions for pH and specific gravity were confirmed
using a pH meter and a refractometer, respectively. The minimum sensitivity was
defined as the concentration where >55% of the results are positive for the next
higher color block. The minimum sensitivity for pH 5.5 is 5.4 (87.4% positive) and
minimum sensitivity for specific gravity 1.005 is 1.004 (96.3% positive).
e. Analytical specificity:
3 negative human urine pools were obtained. Two pools were spiked with test strip
analytes (pH, glucose, etc.) at 2 concentrations; one that yielded positive for the first
color block and the second at a 2+ or 3+ concentration. The concentration of each
analyte was confirmed with the Bayer Clinitek 500 urine analyzer. The negative and
two positive urine samples were then spiked with two different concentrations of
potential interferents and the results compared to samples without the interferent(s).

Interference was defined as any result other than 100% concurrence with the non-
spiked control samples. The following substances were evaluated for interference:
lithium, ammonium chloride, albumin, ascorbic acid, bilirubin, calcium chloride,
citric acid, creatine, creatinine, fructose, galactose, glucose, glycine, hemoglobin,
lactose, KCl, NaCl, oxalic acid, phenolphthalein, riboflavin, sodium bicarbonate,
sodium nitrate, sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate (Mesna), sodium nitrite, sodium
phosphate, theophylline, and urea. The interferents and affected tests are summarized

307 urine samples were collected from 3 physician office laboratory (POL) sites from
patients with Type 1, Type 2, or gestational diabetes, experiencing urinary tract
infection (UTI) symptoms, with liver disease, with kidney disease, other disease, and
patients who were undergoing routine physical examinations. Samples were coded
and 3 operators at each site (N=9) tested the samples on the new device and the
predicate. Three analyzers and three test strip lots were used during the study. The
combined results from the three sites are summarized below. Both the semi-
quantitative and qualitative values are given.
A fourth site (n=167) was added in order to increase the number of positive samples
for urobilinogen, bilirubin, nitrite, ketone, and glucose. Samples were analyzed by 3
users at that site and the patient population was similar to POL sites. Results are
summarized separately below. Both the semi-quantitative and qualitative values are
given.

N. Instrument Name:
Mission® U500 Urine Analyzer
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
There is a routine sample and STAT sample mode. In addition, a system administrator
can set up the instrument to lock out operators if QC fails.

2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X___ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
An external bar code reader, or manual entry of sample numbers are used for sample
identification. Either unique sample identification numbers or assigned sequential
specimen identification numbers up to 9999 sample IDs can be used prior to analyzing
the samples. Samples will need to be analyzed in the same order as the identification
numbers were entered. In addition, the Mission U500 Urine Analyzer automatically
assigns a sequence number to each sample that is run.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
A test strip containing sample is placed on the strip platform where its presence is sensed
by a LED. The test strip is then transported into the reading area of the analyzer and a
new strip can then be placed on the platform. A new test strip can be added to the test
platform every 7 seconds. Results for the first test strip are available after one minute.
Used strips are automatically deposited into a waste tray. The U500 Urine Analyzer
prompts the operator to empty the tray when it is full. The device also stores up to 2000
patient results which can be recalled by the operator using the specimen identification
number. The analyzer also has a STAT mode.
5. Calibration:
The instrument performs a “self-test” and calibration each time it is turned on. Each time
a test is run the analyzer re-calibrates using a white plastic calibration bar located at the
bottom of the analyzer optical system.
6. Quality Control:
Each vial of reagent strips contains a code which includes the lot number and expiration
date of the strips. This code is entered into the U500 analyzer either manually or by a
barcode reader prior to testing. An error code is generated if this is not done.
The instrument includes a quality control function (QC), and a lock out function. When
the QC function is enabled, the instrument will ask for control testing during the system
initialization prior to the routine testing run. The device expects that 2 levels of the
quality control are analyzed. When two quality control levels pass, the instrument can be
used for patient testing. If the quality control does not pass, the operator is locked out of
the device. The analyzer, however, can only be run in the STAT mode and all testing
results will be marked as not having passed QC testing. QC frequency can be
programmed so that the operator is prompted to run controls every 8 hours, daily, weekly
