L. Test Principle:
The Enzymatic Vitamin B6 Assay is based on PLP-dependent recombinant
homocysteine-α,γ-lyase (rHCYase), which is prepared in the apo-enzyme form by
stripping off the cofactor PLP (vitamin B6). The restoration of enzymatic activity by
reconstitution of the holoenzyme depends on the amount of PLP in the plasma bound
to apo-enzyme (Reaction 1) and produces hydrogen sulfide (H2S). H2S combines
with N,N – dibutyl phenylene diamine (DBPDA), which then forms a chromophore
(Reaction 2). The absorbance of this compound is read at 660 – 680 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was determined as described in Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI) Protocol EP5-T2 Evaluation of precision performance of
clinical chemistry devices. Three PLP levels plasma samples were assayed in
duplicate for two runs per day for 20 days. The results are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was performed according to the CLSI protocol EP06-A Evaluation
of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical
Approach. Pooled human plasma sample was spiked with PLP to a
concentration above the measuring range of the device and diluted with
calibrator 0 to make six intermediate levels. Each level was measured with the
device and the mean observed values were compared to the expected values.
Samples tested ranged from 251.3 to 7.85 nmol/L and the observed results
were within ±10% of the expected values for each of the concentrations tested
in the claimed measuring range. The results were plotted as a least-squares
linear regression of the expected concentration versus the observed
concentration with a resulting regression equation of: Y = 0.999X + 0.000056,
r = 0.999.
The device claims a measuring range from 15.6 to 200 nmol/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There is currently no internationally recognized reference method or reference
material for pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP). Calibrator values are assigned by
HPLC measurement for each calibrator. Multiple measurements are
performed and the mean value is calculated for value assignment. These
calibrators are used to assign the target values and ranges for the quality
control samples. These products contain human sourced and/or potentially
infectious components. Donor units of components sourced from human
plasma have been tested and found to be nonreactive for HBsAg, HIV-1 RNA
or HIV-1 Ag, anti-HCV and anti-HIV-1/HIV-2.
Real-time stability testing was conducted by the firm and the protocols and
acceptance criteria have been reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor
stated that their acceptance criteria for all stability studies was <10% difference
from the day 0 value. The reagents, calibrators, and controls are stable until the
date shown on the label when stored as instructed. Open vial stability testing was
performed and showed that the kit is stable for one month when stored at 2-8°C
after opening.
Stability of stored specimens (frozen storage and refrigerated) and the effect
of freezing/thawing on the measurement of PLP by the A/C Enzymatic
Vitamin B6 Assay were evaluated. EDTA-plasma specimens were shown to
be stable for at least one year frozen at -70°C and for two weeks when
refrigerated (2-8°C). The sponsor’s acceptance criteria for this evaluation are
recovery within ±10%. The sponsor notes care should be taken to limit the
number of freeze-thaw cycles when stored at -70°C

d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) were evaluated as
recommended in CLSI EP17-A Protocols for Determination of Limits of
Detection and Limits of Quantitation. The calculations resulted in an LoB of
9.28 nmol/L and an LoD of 13.1 nmol/L. The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was
also evaluated as recommended in CLSI EP17-A and resulted in an LoQ of
15.6 nmol/L, which met the sponsor’s requirement of a % CV of < 20%.
e. Analytical specificity:
Final Concentration

pyridoxal, 1,000.0 < 0.5
pyridosamine 1,000.0 < 0.5
pyridoxine 1,000.0 < 0.5
pyridoxamine-phosphate 1,000.0 < 3.2
The cross reactants shown below were each spiked into a plasma sample with
50 nmol/L PLP. These samples were then evaluated with the device and the
cross reactivity was calculated. Results are summarized below.
Triglyceride, bilirubin, and hemoglobin interference was evaluated by adding
each interferent to EDTA plasma samples with PLP concentrations of 32.5
nmol/L and 115.0 nmol/L. The concentration of each interferent tested and the
results are summarized below.
