L. Test Principle:
The CONTOUR NEXT EZ blood glucose test is based on measurement of electrical current
caused by the reaction of the glucose with the reagents on the electrode of the strip. The
blood sample is drawn into the tip of the test strip through capillary action. Glucose in the
sample reacts with FAD glucose dehydrogenase (FAD-GDH) and the mediator. Electrons
are generated, producing a current that is proportional to the glucose in the sample. After the
reaction time, the glucose concentration in the sample is displayed. No calculation is
required.

The claimed reportable range of the CONTOURNEXT EZ blood glucose monitoring
system is 20 to 600 mg/dL. The sponsor evaluated that samples below or above the
claimed measuring range are flagged by the meter as “LO” or “HI”, respectively, by
testing extremely low (5 mg/dL) and extremely high (900, 1200, 1500, and 1800
mg/dL glucose samples on eight meters and three lots of test strips.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The CONTOURNEXT EZ blood glucose monitoring system is factory calibrated and
further calibration by the user is not necessary for operation. The calibration is
traceable to NIST (dry-D-glucose) SRM 917a.
Test Strip Stability
Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria for the Contour NEXT EZ test
strips were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer claims shelf life
stability and open-vial stability of 18 months at the recommended storage
temperatures of 5-30°C.
Controls Value Assignment and Stability
Value assignment for the control solutions is based on replicate reading on each of
thirty-six instruments and the range is assigned as ± 11% relative to the calculated
mean.
Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria for the glucose control solutions
were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer claims a shelf life
stability of 18 months and an open-vial stability of 3 months at the recommended
storage temperatures of 9°C to 30°C.
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the CONTOURNEXT EZ blood glucose monitoring system
is 20 to 600 mg/dL. This range was verified by the linearity study (see section M.1.b
of this decision summary).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed by adding common endogenous and exogenous
substances to a pool of fresh whole blood at 80 and 300 mg/dL plasma glucose and
calculating bias relative to a control of the same samples. A minimum of ten
replicates per sample were collected for each substance on at least five CONTOUR
NEXT EZ meters with each of three lots of CONTOUR NEXT glucose test strips.
Significant interference was defined as >10% bias. No significant interference was

observed up to the levels shown in the table below for the following interfering
substances:
Substance No Interference at Listed Level
Endogenous Substance
Bilirubin 54 mg/dL

The study showed that xylose has a significant interference at 6 mg/dL. The sponsor
has added the following limitations on the product labeling:
“Do not use during or soon after xylose absorption testing. Xylose in the blood will
cause an interference.”
“Certain substances occurring in the blood naturally (uric acid, bilirubin) or from
therapeutic treatments (ascorbic acid, acetaminophen) will not significantly affect
results.” An interferences table is shown in the test strips package insert.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study:
A study was performed to evaluate the blood hematocrit (HCT) effect on the performance
of the CONTOURNEXT EZ blood glucose monitoring system across the measuring
range of the assay (40, 90, 180, 275, 360, 450, and 550 mg/dL). Venous blood samples
were tested in replicates of twelve using three lots of strip and six meters. Glucose
concentrations at each HCT level (15%, 20%, 25%, 40%, 55%, 60%, and 65%) were
compared with results obtained at 40% HCT and the YSI-2300 reference method. Data
were found adequate. The sponsor included the following limitation in the label:
CONTOUR NEXT test strip results are not significantly affected by hematocrit levels in
the range of 15% to 65%.
2. Altitude Study:
The effect of altitude was evaluated inside and outside a glove box purged with ultra pure
nitrogen to simulate a high altitude condition. Two lots of the CONTOUR NEXT test
strips were tested on five meters in duplicate with 41 and 65% HCT whole blood
supplemented with 50, 100, and 400 mg/dL plasma glucose. The mean assay results
obtained were compared to YSI reference method values and data were found adequate.
The sponsor included the following limitation in the label: “Altitude: Up to 20, 674 feet
(6,301 meters) does not significantly affect results”.
10

--- Page 11 ---
3. Temperature and Humidity Studies
Studies were performed to evaluate the effect of temperature and humidity on the
performance of the CONTOURNEXT EZ blood glucose monitoring system at 80 and
350 mg/dL glucose levels using whole blood samples. Testing was completed using
fifteen replicates per sample, two lots of CONTOUR NEXT test strips, and five
CONTOUR NEXT EZ meters. Meters were evaluated while exposed to different
temperature and humidity combinations to support the claimed ranges of 5-45°C and 10-
93% RH.
4. Sample Volume
Sample volume studies were performed at 100 and 300 mg/dL blood glucose (42% HCT)
using three lots of CONTOUR NEXT glucose test strips in triplicate on each of eight
CONTOUR NEXT EZ glucose meters at different sample volumes (0.4, 0.55, 0.6, and
0.7 uL). Test results support the claimed use of 0.6 uL of sample. The new system has a
sample re-application feature in which the user can reload sample within a 20 seconds
window prior to receiving the error code.
5. Usability Study
A usability study was performed to assess the readability of the labeling by recruiting lay
users (aged 18-79 yrs old) who were provided with the test kit containing labeling for the
US market. Participants varied in age, education, country of origin, and were about
evenly divided between men and women. Data from a questionnaire provided to these
lay users indicate that the users found the device easy to use and the instructions for use
were written in a way that makes it easy to use. Data from this study were found
adequate.
6. Readability Assessment
Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the results showed that the
labeling (user guide, test strip package insert, quick reference guide, and control solution
package insert) were written at the grade level no higher than 7.8.
7. Customer Service Telephone Number
Customer service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The toll free phone number
is 1-800-348-8100 for customer support.
9. EMC Testing

were performed on materials comprising the Contour NEXT EZ glucose meter and the
Microlet 2 lancing device by outside commercial laboratory testing services
demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus with Clorox Germicidal Wipes (EPA
Reg. No: 67619-12). The sponsor also conducted robustness studies and demonstrated
that there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the meter and
lancing device after 260 cleaning and disinfection cycles to simulate 5 years of use by
lay-users. Each robustness cycle tested consisted of one pre-clean wipe and one
disinfecting wipe. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated
cleaning and disinfection procedures.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
