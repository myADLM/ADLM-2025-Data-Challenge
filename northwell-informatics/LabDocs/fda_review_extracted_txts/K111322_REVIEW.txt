2. Indication(s) for use:
The Chemtron Biotech, Inc.’s Chemtrue® Single/Multi-Panel Drug Screen
Cassette and Dip Card Tests are rapid lateral flow immunoassays for the
qualitative detection of up to six of the following drugs in a variety of
combinations in human urine. The designed cutoff concentrations and the
calibrators used for these drugs are as follows:
Analyte Abbreviation Calibrator Cutoff
Benzodiazepines BZO Oxazepam 300 ng/mL
Barbiturates BAR Secobarbital/
Pentobarbital 300 ng/mL
Ecstasy MDMA/
XTC d,l-Methylenedioxyethamphetamine 500 ng/mL
Methadone MTD Methadone 300 ng/mL
Opiates OPI/MOR Morphine 2000 ng/mL
Oxycodone OXY Oxycodone 100 ng/mL
The Chemtrue® Single/Multi-Panel Drug Screen Cassette and Dip Card Tests are
intended for the qualitative detection of drugs of abuse for in vitro diagnostic and
prescription use ONLY. They are not intended for point-of-care settings or over
the counter use. These assays provide only a preliminary result. A more specific
alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed assay
result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) or Liquid
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) are the preferred confirmatory
methods.
Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drugs
of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
In vitro diagnostic use, prescription use only
Not for point-of-care or over the counter use
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable, as the devices are visually-read single-use devices.
I. Device Description:
The devices are for use in human urine. The Chemtrue Single/Multi-Panel Drug
Screen Cassette and Dip Card Tests are single-test test strips. The Chemtrue
Single/Multi-Panel Drug Screen Cassette and Dip Card Tests contain test cassettes
and package inserts (instructions for use).

antibodies to one of its respective drug and drug-labeled conjugate (containing a
chromagen). Binding of the drug in the sample causes the absence of a line at the test
area, i.e., a positive result. When drug is not present in the sample, the drug-labeled
conjugate binds at the test line, resulting in formation of a line, i.e., a negative result.
The absence or presence of the line is determined visually by the operator.
The device also has an internal process control (goat monoclonal anti-rabbit IgG)
which indicates that an adequate volume of sample has been added and that the
immunochromatographic strip is intact.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable, the device is intended for qualitative use
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This device has internal process controls. A colored line appearing in the
control region confirms sufficient sample volume and adequate membrane
wicking. Users are informed that the test is invalid if a line fails to appear in
the control region.
Control materials are not supplied with this device; however it is good
laboratory practice to confirm the test procedure and to verify proper test
performance. Users should follow all applicable guidelines for testing QC
materials.
Stability:
Accelerated studies have been conducted. Protocols and acceptance criteria
were described and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer claims the
following expiration date:
When stored at 2–30 ºC product is stable until expiration date which is 24
months.
Real time studies have been conducted and are on-going.
Read time stability was performed for Chemtrue Single/Multi-Panel Drug
Screen Dip Card and Cassette. A drug-free urine was spiked with the
appropriate drug at 50% cutoff, 150% cutoff, as well as a negative urine was
used to perform the study. All samples were analyzed fifteen times at each
concentration with three lots of test strips at 1-5 minute intervals from 1-20
minutes. Data supports the recommended read time of 5 minutes for each
device.
d. Detection limit:
See Precision/Reproducibility section in M 1.a above.

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was established by spiking structurally related compounds
into drug-free urine and diluting each to obtain various concentrations. Results
are expressed as a minimum concentration of metabolite or compound
required to produce a response approximately equivalent to the cutoff
concentration of the assay. Testing was performed on both devices (dip card
and cassette). Both devices produced similar results. The percent cross-
reactivity of those compounds are presented below:

Structurally un-related:
This study was performed by spiking structurally unrelated compounds and
endogenous substances at a concentration of 100 µg/mL into urine samples
containing drug at +/-25% of the respective drug cutoff concentrations. The
substances at 100 µg/mL concentration were also tested at +/- 50% respective
drug cutoff concentrations, if a false result was observed at +/- 25% cutoff levels.
Testing was performed on both devices (dip card and cassette). The following
compounds showed no interference when tested at the +/-50% drug
concentration:
Acetaminophen 5,5-Diphenylhydantoin Oxalic Acid

Evaluation of SG and pH on test results:
To evaluate the effect of pH value on the test results, urine controls at 50%,
75%, 125% and 150% of the cutoff value were used. Each control level was
adjusted by either 1N NaOH solution or 1N HCl to the pH levels at 3.0, 3.5,
4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0 and 8.5. Each test sample was tested in
duplicate.
To evaluate the effect of specific gravity, urine controls at +/-25% and +/-50%
of the cut-off values were spiked with DI water or sugar to obtain specific
gravities of 1.002, 1.010, 1.015, 1.020, 1.025, and 1.030. Each test sample was
tested in duplicate.
The testing results demonstrate that varying pH’s and specific gravities do not
affect urine testing results around each analyte cut-off.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed
cutoff concentration appears in the precision section, M1.a, above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the
device for detection of benzodiazepine, barbiturate, MDMA, opiates, methadone
and oxycodone, with 2 operators (1 operator/device). In the method comparison
study, 203 unaltered clinical samples (85 negative and 118 positive)
benzodiazepine, 190 unaltered clinical samples (85 negative and 105 positive)
barbiturate, 100 unaltered clinical samples (60 negative and 40 positive) MDMA,
106 unaltered clinical samples (65 negative and 41 positive) opiates, 104
unaltered clinical samples (60 negative and 44 positive) methadone, 106
unaltered clinical samples (59 negative and 47 positive) oxycodone were tested
with the proposed devices and compared against the results obtained with
GC/MS. The results of the studies are presented below:
