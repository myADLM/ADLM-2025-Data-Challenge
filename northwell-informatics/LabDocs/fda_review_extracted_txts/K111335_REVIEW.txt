L. Test Principle:
The ST AIA-PACK ACTH is a two-site enzyme immunoassay which is performed in
the ST AIA-PACK ACTH test cups. ACTH present in the test sample is bound with
goat polyclonal antibody immobilized on magnetic beads and enzyme-labeled
polyclonal antibody. The magnetic beads are washed to remove unbound enzyme-
labeled polyclonal antibody and are then incubated with a fluorogenic substrate, 4-
methylumbelliferyl phosphate (4MUP). The enzyme alkaline phosphatase causes
oxidation of 4MUP to 4MU. 4MU is excited at 365 nm and comes to ground state at
448 nm releasing fluorescent energy. The amount of fluorescent energy is measured
by the detector. The amount of enzyme-labeled polyclonal antibody that binds to the
beads is directly proportional to the ACTH concentration in the test sample. A
standard curve is constructed, and unknown sample concentrations are calculated
using this curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Performance in this 510(k) was evaluated on the Tosoh AIA 2000 (Model 022100.)
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision study followed the CLSI protocol, Evaluation of Precision
Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods (EP5-A2). The precision
study for the ST AIA-PACK ACTH assay was evaluated utilizing three AIA-2000
analyzers and 3 different lots of reagents. Precision was assessed by assaying
three levels of unaltered EDTA plasma specimens. Estimates of total and within-

run precision were obtained from measurements of 2 replicates in a single run, 2
times a day for 20 non-consecutive days. This equaled to a total of 40 runs and 80
determinants. One calibration curve (obtained on the first day) was used
throughout.
The following results were obtained when tested with three unaltered plasma

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor’s claimed reportable range is 2-2000 pg/mL. To evaluate linearity, high
and low samples (EDTA plasma) were serially diluted and assayed on the new device.
The high samples were prepared by spiking a plasma sample and the low samples
were prepared by diluting a low concentration sample with the AIA diluting solution.
For each level tested, the average of four replicates was determined. The recoveries
relative to expected concentrations based on dilution of the high and low samples, and
the mean and SD’s of the replicates, are listed below. (In additions see the Detection

Real time storage:
Expiration of ST AIA-PACK ACTH CALIBRATOR SET was determined by
using three different lots of CALIBRATOR SET, one AIA-2000 analyzer and
three reagent sets. Reagents were stored at 8 - 12 degree C. The system was
calibrated using the stored calibrator set on the day of assay. Each calibrator was
assayed in 5 replicates and the mean and %CV were calculated, at multiple time
points including and past the expiration date. The protocol and acceptance
criteria provided were adequate for the claim of 12 months at 2-8 degrees C.
Calibrator in-use stability:
Three sets of calibrator material were opened and reconstituted at time points
before the measurement, and stored refrigerated. The system was calibrated using
the stored (test) calibrators and recovery and precision of pooled samples stored at
-70 degree C were evaluated as unknowns. The protocol and acceptance criteria
provided were adequate to support the claim of in-use calibrator stability of one
day when stored for one day tightly sealed and refrigerated at 2-8 degrees C.
Control materials:
Stability:
Control materials opened and closed stability was evaluated as described for
calibrators, except that open control stability testing extended to 7 days. The
protocol and acceptance criteria were adequate to support shelf-life stability of
months and open vial stability is 7 days when store at 2-8 degrees C.
Value assignment:
The AIA-PACK ACTH CONTROL SET contains assigned concentration ranges
of ACTH. The assigned range is determined using two analyzers and two reagent
lots with 5 replicates per sample using the manufacturer’s working calibrators.
The range is assigned as +/- 20% of the grand mean and is designed to provide
target control levels of approximately 50 (target range approximately 40 to 60)
and 300 (230 to 350) pg/mL of ACTH.

d. Detection limit:
The lower limit of the assay range is based on the LoQ according to the CLSI EP17-
A guideline. Fifteen samples were evaluated ranging from the LoB to 4 times the
LoB. These samples were assayed 2 times a day for over 5 days. LoB is determined
to be 0.5 pg/mL. LoD is determined by testing 60 blank and 60 low samples. LoD is
determined to be 0.7 pg/mL. LoQ is determined to be 1.2 pg/mL. At that
concentration CV was between 10- 20% (and bias based on linearity was < 5%).
The sponsor claimed that the measuring range of the assay is 2.0 to 2000 pg/mL
e. Analytical specificity:
ACTH fragments and related peptides were purchased from an outside vendor (Refer
to the following table 1). ACTH fragments and related peptides were dissolved in ST
AIA-PACK ACTH SAMPLE DILUTING SOLUTION (SDS) and adjusted to 10
ug/mL to prepare a stock solution. 30 uL of fragments were diluted with 2,970 uL of
EDTA plasma to 100,000 pg/mL. Concentrations of 500 and 5,000 pg/mL were
prepared by further dilution with EDTA plasma.
The specimens were measured in duplicate using the ST AIA-PACK ACTH assay at
one site using one AIA-2000 analyzer and a single lot of reagent each. The mean and
percent recovery was calculated as (Apparent value / Control value) x 100.

negatively affect the ACTH assay. It is likely that these fragments bind to either the
antibodies on beads or the enzyme-labeled antibodies. Therefore, if these fragments were
contained excessively in the test sample, lower values may be reported.

Evaluation of Common exogenous compounds:
Specimen pools at three concentrations of ACTH were evaluated by adding interfering
substance and assaying utilizing the ST AIA-PACK ACTH assay on the AIA-2000. The
average of triplicate measurements for each level was calculated. The specimen value
without adding interfering substance was used as the reference value. The sponsor
defines non-significant interference as recovery within± 10% of the unspiked samples.
No significant interference was observed when endogenous compounds were tested up to
the following concentrations.
Heparin (up to 50 U/mL).
Acetominophen (up to 20 mg/L).
Acetylsalicylic acid (up to 300 mg/L).
Ampicillin (up to 200 mg/L).
Ibuprofen (up to 50 mg/L).
Theophylline (up to 10 mg/L).

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 160 EDTA plasma specimens were assayed in singleton utilizing the ST
AIA-PACK ACTH assay on the AIA-2000 analyzer and the Roche Elecsys-ACTH
on the MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 (Elecsys module) analyzer. A combination
of fresh and frozen specimens was utilized for this study. Sample selection criteria
included only sample stability and integrity (e.g., no known hemolysis, lipemia or
icteric). Of the 160 samples.154 were unaltered patient samples. Another 6 were
prepared by mixing patient samples. Samples exposed to repeated freeze-thaw cycles
were not used. Samples containing particulate matter were centrifuged prior to
testing. Prior to assay, frozen samples were brought to room temperature slowly, and
mixed gently.
Testing was done at one site utilizing one AIA-2000 analyzers and one MODULAR
ANALYTICS E170 (Elecsys module) analyzer. Results are shown below.

b. Matrix comparison
Not applicable; specimen collection and handling states EDTA plasma is required
for the assay.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity: Not applicable; Clinical sensitivity and specificity is not
typically provided in 510(k)s for this type of assay.
b. Clinical specificity: See a, above.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable; this is a quantitative assay.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The package insert states that each laboratory should determine a reference
interval corresponding to the characteristics of the population being tested.
Clinical results must be interpreted with regard to concomitant medications
administered to the patient.
The reference range study was conducted with reference to the CLSI protocol
entitled: How to Define and Determine Reference Intervals in the Clinical
Laboratory (C28-A3).
A total of 121 well-characterized unaltered EDTA plasma specimens from
ambulatory patients with no known history of pituitary or adrenal disease were
assayed in singleton utilizing the ST AIA-PACK ACTH assay on the AIA-2000
analyzer. Specimens from 110 males between the ages of 26 to 60 years and 11
females between the ages of 28 to 44 years were included in this study. Samples were
collected between 8 AM and noon and frozen below -70 degree C until testing.
Prior to assay frozen samples were brought to room temperature (18 - 25 °C) slowly,
and mixed gently. Samples exposed to repeated freeze-thaw cycles were not used.
Samples containing particulate matter were centrifuged prior to testing.
Testing was done at one site utilizing one AIA-2000 analyzer. Instrument
maintenance and QC records were reviewed to ensure the instrument was functioning
within normal guidelines.
