I. Device Description:
The Elecsys SHBG CalCheck 5 is a lyophilized product consisting of SHBG in human and
equine (horse) serum matrix. During manufacture, the analyte is spiked into the matrix at the
desired concentration levels. The sponsor declared in the labeling that all products derived
from human blood are prepared exclusively from the blood of donors tested individually and
shown to be free from HBsAg and antibodies to HCV and HIV. The testing methods applied
were FDA-approved or cleared in compliance with the European Directive 98/79/EC, Annex
II, List A.
During manufacture, the analyte is spiked into the matrix at the desired concentration levels.

Traceability
The Elecsys SHBG CalCheck 5 is traceable to the NIBSC 95/560 international standard.
Value Assignment:
For each Elecsys SHBG CalCheck 5 lot manufactured, the CalChecks are assayed in
duplicate on at least three E170 analyzers. The assigned value of each CalCheck is
defined as the median value obtained over at least 6 determinations of the respective
CalCheck. The assigned range is ± 30% of assigned value, in which 10% was allotted for
between-analyzer platform tolerance, 10% for stability tolerance and 10% for precision of
the assay.
Values are assigned for each lot of Elecsys SHBG CalCheck 5 in combination with each
Elecsys SHBG reagent lot available.
For additional analyzers (Elecsys 2010), the same value assignment procedure is
performed. The assigned values obtained on 2010 are compared to those obtained on the
E170. Differences between the analyzer platforms are within the 10% tolerance, therefore,
the values assigned to the E170 (and cobas e 601, e602) are transferred to and valid for
the Elecsys 2010 (and cobas e 411).
Stability:
The stability studies for SHBG CalCheck 5 were performed on the cobas e 601. Because
these studies are not analyzer-dependent, these results, in addition to real-time stability
study results, can be applied to the Elecsys 2010, MODULAR ANALYTICS E170, cobas
e 411 and cobas e 602. The stability protocol and the acceptance criteria have been
reviewed and found to be acceptable.
• Shelf-life stability:
The accelerated stability testing performed at 35°C supports an initial shelf-life claim
of 18 months at 2-8°C. Real-time testing at 2-8oC is on-going to support a claim of
36 months.
• Open-vial stability after reconstitution :
Real time testing was performed and the data support the package insert claim that
reconstituted Elecsys SHBG CalCheck 5 is stable up to 4 hours at 20-25°C.
• On-board stability:
The SHBG CalCheck 5 products are not stored on-board the analyzer, therefore no
on-board stability claims is made.
