L. Test Principle:
The On Call® Chosen Blood Glucose Monitoring System employs glucose oxidase
enzyme chemistry as the standard dry reagent assay for glucose in whole blood. This
enzyme assay, with a redox chemical “mediator” reaction, is used to generate an
electrical current proportional to the glucose concentration in the blood sample. The
system is designed as an amperometric measurement device using current generated
from the redox reaction as the measurable response.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run precision was measured by using heparinized anti-coagulated
whole blood at five different glucose concentrations. Each sample was tested
on 3 lots of test strips on 30 meters (10 meters per test strip lot). Ten
replicates were tested per meter, test strip lot, and glucose concentration,
(N=100 per test strip). Results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity study was designed based on CLSI EP6-A guideline. Eleven human
whole blood samples were drawn into heparinized tubes and spiked to the
target analyte levels. 11 target levels were prepared with glucose
concentrations ranging from 20 to 650 mg/dL (20, 30, 50, 80, 100, 170, 220,
330, 450, 550, and 650 mg/dL). All samples were tested on 3 lots of test
strips in replicates of four on two different On Call Chosen meters. All
samples were also tested on the YSI 2300 analyzer to generate the expected
values. The observed values were plotted against the expected values and an
appropriate line fitted by standard linear regression was generated with results
summarized below:

Traceability: On Call Chosen Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable
to the NIST SRM 917b reference material.
Value assignment:
The value assignment of the On Call Chosen control solutions were
determined by an in-house procedure. The control solutions were prepared by
gravimetric addition of glucose to achieve target values of 120 mg/dL for
level 1 and 350 mg/dL for level 2 and values were confirmed by the YSI
method. Verification of the control solutions were tested with 240 test strips
and 2 meters with each level and the target ranges were set at the following:
Glucose control solution Target Acceptable range
concentration
Level 1 (medium) 120 mg/dL 120 ± 20% (96-144 mg/dL)
Level 2 (high) 350 mg/dL 350 ± 20% (280-420 mg/dL)
Control ranges are lot specific and are provided on the test strip vial.
Stability:
Accelerated stability study was conducted to assess the shelf-life and open-
vial stability of the control solutions and test strips. Real-time stability studies
are still on-going. Stability studies protocol and acceptance criteria were
provided and found to be adequate. Unopened control solutions have a 24
month shelf life and are stable for 6 months after first use when stored at 2-
30oC (36-86 oF) . The sponsor claimed that the unopened test strips have a 24
month shelf-life and are stable for 6 months after first use when stored at 2-
30oC (36-86 oF). This information is provided in the labeling of the test strips
and control materials.
d. Detection limit:
See linearity study above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference study was designed according to CLSI EP7-A2 guideline. 25
common endogenous and exogenous interfering substances were evaluated by
spiking venous blood with three levels of glucose concentrations (60, 100 and
300 mg/dL). The glucose samples were spiked with the potentially interfering
compounds and tested on 3 lots of test strips using 2 different meters. Each
sample is tested in replicates of four and a total of 1008 test strips were used.
Bias was calculated as the mean percent difference in glucose reading

Based on the study data, all the substances and levels tested above have
<10% bias except for ascorbic acid > 3 mg/dL (above therapeutic levels).
Ascorbic acid levels > 3 mg/dL will interfere with the glucose reading;
therefore, the sponsor has the following limitation in their labeling.
“Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) ≤3 mg/dL does not significantly affect results.

However, abnormally high concentration (> 3mg/dL) in blood may cause
inaccurately high glucose results.”
“Critically ill patients should not be tested with blood glucose meters. Test
results can be falsely low if the patients are severely dehydrated, in shock, or
in hyper-osmolar state (with or without ketosis).”
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
System accuracy study was performed according to the ISO 15197 document
using 110 participants from a diabetic clinic. A trained healthcare
professional (HCP) collected samples from the fingertip, forearm and palm on
each participant. Capillary samples were collected and measured on the YSI
2300 analyzer (reference method) and from the same fingersticks. One patient
had a result >700; therefore, was omitted from the data analysis. In order to
obtain sufficient samples in the lowest concentration interval (< 50 mg/dL), 5
additional capillary samples from fingertip were altered. Samples that were
<50 mg/dL were contrived samples and samples between 50 to 497 mg/dL
were natural samples (109 + 5 = 114). The range of glucose values for the
fingerstick samples tested was 44.2-497 mg/dL. Forearm and palm samples
were all natural patient samples and sample range tested was 52.1 to 497
mg/dL (109). All samples were tested in duplicate using 3 different lots of
test strips and a total of 36 meters and only the first replicate was used for data
analysis. Regression analysis results are summarized below:

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
A user performance study was conducted in conjunction with the system
accuracy study. Lay users self-tested their fingertip glucose results using the
labeling provided by the sponsor without any prior training. Lay user self-test
results (with fingertip) and the YSI method fingerstick results were compared.
Study was performed in one clinical site with 110 subjects, including 45%
male and 55% female. 3 lots of test strips were used and each lay user tested
two lots of strips randomly. One patient has a result >700; therefore, was
omitted from the data analysis. The range of glucose values for the fingerstick
samples was 52.2 - 497 mg/dL. Linear regressions analysis results are
summarized below:

O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and requires a sample volume of 0.8 uL.
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer,
webserver, or mobile device?
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile
device using wireless transmission?
Yes __________ or No ___X____
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this line of product types:
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied
directly to the test strip as they are collected. The On-Call Chosen Blood Glucose
Monitoring System’s memory will store 300 test results with respective dates and
time.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger,
palm, and forearm only. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test
strip by capillary action.
Testing on Fingertips – Refer to the ON-Call Chosen Blood Glucose Monitoring
System User’s Manual for detailed meter information prior to testing.
Testing on palm and forearm- The following important notes are listed in the
package insert:
• Consult your healthcare professional before you begin using the palm or
forearm for testing.
• Under certain conditions, blood glucose test results obtained using
samples taken from your palm or forearm may differ significantly from
fingertip samples. Do not use palm or forearm testing when your blood
glucose is changing rapidly such as following a meal, an insulin dose, or
16

--- Page 17 ---
associated with physical exercise.
• Alternative site testing (AST) should not be used to calibrate continuous
glucose monitors (CGMs) nor for use in insulin dose calculations.
5. Calibration:
There is no calibration required for the On Call® Chosen meter by the user. The
meter is plasma-calibrated. However, there is a code chip that is coded with the
calibration information that comes with each test strip vial. The code chip
automatically calibrates the meter with the code number when inserted into the
meter. The code chip must match the lot number on the test strip before running a
glucose test.
6. Quality Control:
Glucose control solutions at two different concentrations (level 1 and level 2) are
available to be run with this device and are sold separately. One level of control
solution (level 1) is provided with the kit. The meter has an algorithm to
automatically recognize the control solutions to prevent control results from being
stored in the internal memory as patient results. Recommendations on when to
test the control materials are provided in the labeling. The control solution
readings are not included in the average of the patient results. An acceptable range
for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is cautioned
not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. A usability study was performed to assess the readability of the labeling by
recruiting 110 lay users (aged 21-82 yrs old) who were provided with the test kit
containing labeling for the US market. Participants varied in age, education,
country of origin, and were about evenly divided between men and women. These
lay users also completed a questionnaire to assess whether the device is easy to
use and if the Instructions for use were written in a way that makes it easy to use.
The majority of the users responded that the device is very easy to use.
2. Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the results showed that
the labeling (User’s Manual, test strip package insert, control solution package
insert, and Quick Guides) were written at ≤ 8th grade level.
3. Customer service is available 24/7, 365 days a year. Toll free phone number is 1-
800-838-9502 for customer support.
4. A sample volume study was performed to verify the test strip sample volume
requirement and the test strip fill error requirement established for the On Call®
Chosen BGMS. Three lots of test strips were tested using blood from three
17

--- Page 18 ---
donors, each adjusted to a glucose concentration of 60, 100 and 500 mg/dL.
Blood at each concentration was applied to strips at five target sample volumes of
0.4, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 and 1.0 µL. Protocols and acceptance criteria were provided and
found to be acceptable. The sponsor concluded that sample volume of ≥0.8 µL
produced accurate results and samples <0.8 µL give an error code (“E5”-
insufficient sample).
5. Temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated for temperatures
ranging from 5oC to 45oC and relative humidity from 10% to 90%. Extreme
temperatures and humidity conditions combinations were tested as follows:
10%/5oC, 10%/45oC, 90%/5oC, and 90%/45oC. Protocol and acceptance criteria
were provided and found to be acceptable. (% bias for all individual result against
YSI results are within ±10% bias).The results supported the Sponsor’s claimed
operating temperature from 5oC to 45oC (41oF to 113oF) and relative humidity
range from 10% to 90%.

was issued to ACON Laboratories, Inc. on January 31, 2011.
7. The device is intended for single-patient use only. DisCide Ultra Disinfecting
Towelette with EPA registration # 10492-4 was validated demonstrating complete
inactivation of live hepatitis B virus (HBV) for use with the meter. The towelette
is available for purchase through Palmero Health Care Company and user can
either call 1-800-344-6424 or visit their website at www.palmerohealth.com. The
sponsor also demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the
external materials of the meter after 1642 cleaning cycles and 1642 disinfection
cycles designed to simulate 4.5 years of device use. Labeling was reviewed for
adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
8. The optional RS 232 data transmitting port was reviewed and found to be
adequate to support the use of transmitting data to a Data Management Software.
The Data Management Software has been previously cleared in k101371.
9. Hematocrit Study - The sponsor performed hematocrit studies using eight
different hematocrits (Hct) (20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 65 and 70%) levels across the
glucose measuring range (20-600 mg/dL). At each hematocrit level, 4 samples at
glucose concentration of 50, 100, 250, and 500 mg/dL were tested against the YSI
method. 3 lots of test strips were tested on 2 meters, with replicates of three for
each concentration tested and the values were compared to the YSI method and
the nominal hematocrit level (40%). All results generated from the On Call
Chosen glucose meter had a bias of <10% when compared to the YSI method and
the nominal hematocrit level. Based on the data, the sponsor claims that
hematocrit between 20% to 70% do not significantly affect the glucose results.
10. Altitude Study - A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of altitude on the
On Call® Chosen BGMS. 3 lots of test strips were tested on 16 meters using

blood from three donors at three glucose concentrations (70, 240, and 450 mg/dL)
at one high altitude level (8,516 feet), and sea level (0 feet) as a control. Testing
was performed in a hyperbaric chamber. Each venous blood sample was also
tested by the YSI 2300 analyzer. The meter readings obtained were compared to
the YSI method and the percent bias was determined at each level against the YSI
results. Bias was within ± 10% for all three altitude levels tested. Based on the
data, the sponsor claims that the On Call® Chosen BMGS can be used at altitude
up to 8,516 feet.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
