OCC, OOI
4. Panel:
Microbiology (83)
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The IQuum Liat™ Influenza A/B Assay performed on the Liat™ Analyzer is an automated
multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay for the rapid in vitro qualitative detection and
discrimination of influenza A virus and influenza B virus RNA in nasopharyngeal swab
specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection in conjunction
with clinical and epidemiological risk factors. The test is intended for use as an aid in the
differential diagnosis of influenza A and influenza B in humans and is not intended to detect
influenza C.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole
basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely, positive results do not
rule-out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be
the definite cause of disease.
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established when influenza A/H1 and A/H3
were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation. When other influenza A viruses are
emerging, performance characteristics may vary.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent
Influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture should
not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and culture
specimens.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

I. Device Description:
The Liat™ Influenza A/B Assay targets a well-conserved region of the matrix gene of
Influenza A viral RNA (Inf A target) and non-structural protein gene of Influenza B (Inf B
target). An Internal Process Control (IPC) is also included. The IPC is present to control for
adequate processing of the target viruses and to monitor the presence of inhibitors in the RT-
PCR reactions.
The Liat Influenza A/B Assay is performed on the lab-in-a-tube technology platform. The
system consists of a disposable Liat Influenza A/B Assay Tube and the Liat™ Analyzer. The
Liat™ Tube uses a flexible tube as a sample vessel. It contains all required unit dose reagents
pre-packed in tube segments, separated by peelable seals, in the order of reagent use. The
Liat Analyzer performs all assay steps from clinical sample and reports assay result
automatically. During the testing process, multiple sample processing actuators of the
analyzer compress the Liat Tube to selectively release reagents from tube segments, move
the sample from one segment to another, and control reaction volume, temperature, and time
to conduct sample preparation, nucleic acid extraction, target enrichment, inhibitor removal,
nucleic acid elution and real-time RT-PCR. An embedded microprocessor controls and
coordinates the actions of these sample processors to perform all required assay processes
within the closed Liat Tube. Turnaround time for analysis of a sample is ~20 minutes.
Positive control is provided in the Liat Influenza A/B Assay Quality Control Kit. The
positive control comprises a pooled sample of inactivated Influenza A and B virus. Negative
control is provided in the Liat Influenza A/B Assay Quality Control Kit. The negative control
comprises universal transport medium (UTM). The solution is provided in unit dose quantity
and labeled as Dilution UTM. To use the negative control, an operator transfers the entire
contents of the Dilution UTM tube into the Liat tube using a transfer pipette and runs the
assay following the Instructions for Use.
The results are interpolated by the Liat Analyzer software from measured fluorescent signals
and real time curve recognition algorithm. All possible final test results are described and
depicted below.

Reasons to Repeat the Assay
If any of the test results mentioned below occur, repeat the test according to instructions in
Starting Liat Assay section using a new Liat Tube (do not reuse Liat Tubes).
• An “Assay Invalid. Repeat test.” result indicates that (1) the IPC was not detected
when Inf A and Inf B were both not detected, or (2) all detected PCR curve(s) for Inf
A and/or Inf B have abnormal PCR curve pattern. This may result from the sample
not being properly processed or the RT-PCR being inhibited.
• An “Error” is reported and the assay is aborted. Possible causes include temperature
control, motion control failure and power failure.
• An “Indeterminate” result is reported for one Influenza target and “Detected” for the
other Influenza target. This results from an abnormal PCR curve pattern for the
“Indeterminate” Influenza target. Retest is required to determine whether the
“Indeterminate” Influenza target is detected.

• Establishing Performance Characteristics of In Vitro Diagnostic Devices for Detection or
Detection and Differentiation of Influenza Viruses. DRAFT GUIDANCE. Document
issued on February 15, 2008. Docket number FDA-2008-D-0095.
L. Test Principle:
Liat Influenza A/B Assay uses an established nucleic acid test chemistry and assay protocol for
detection of viral RNA. The sample preparation methodology is based on lysis by a chaotropic
agent followed by magnetic particle based nucleic acid purification. First, the NPS sample in
UTM is diluted and mixed with an internal process control (IPC) comprising an encapsulated
RNA. Chaotropic and proteolytic reagents then disrupt the three dimensional structure of the
macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids in the sample. Second, nucleic acids are
isolated from lysates through binding to silica magnetic beads in the presence of the chaotropic
salt. Third, the beads with the bound nucleic acid are separated from the lysate using a magnetic
field, and the lysate removed. Fourth, the beads with captured nucleic acids are washed to
remove possible inhibitors in the sample. Finally, the captured nucleic acids are then eluted
under low-salt conditions into a small volume of elution buffer.
Target amplification and detection uses TaqMan-probe based real-time polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR). The Inf A primer and probe set is designed for the detection of matrix RNA
from type A Influenza virus; while the Inf B primer and probe sets are designed to specifically
detect the non-structural protein (NSP) RNA from Influenza B viruses. An IPC primer and
probe set is also included to amplify the target region of the encapsulated RNA internal control.
Eluted viral RNA is first transcribed into cDNA using reverse transcriptase. This cDNA then
undergoes a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) where the reaction mixture is repeatedly heated to
denature the nucleic acid and cooled to allow annealing of primers and extension of annealed
primers by DNA polymerase to logarithmically amplify a specific region of the cDNA. Dual-
labeled fluorogenic hydrolysis (TaqMan) probes anneal to specific target sequences located
between the binding regions of forward and reverse primers. During the extension phase of the
PCR cycle, the 5′ nuclease activity of polymerase degrades the probes, causing the reporter dyes
(e.g., FAM) to separate from the quenchers (e.g., BHQ, Black Hole Quencher), thus generating
fluorescent signals. Fluorescence intensities are monitored at each PCR cycle. When the
fluorescence intensities exceed pre-determined thresholds, cycle threshold (Ct) values are
returned for the specific analyte corresponding to the fluorescence channel.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The multi-site reproducibility study assesses the total variability of the Liat Influenza A/B
Assay across operators, study sites, testing days, Liat Analyzers, and Liat assay tube lots. The
10

--- Page 11 ---
Liat assay was evaluated at 3 sites. Two operators at each of the 3 sites tested an 8 member
reproducibility panel in triplicate on 5 different days, for a total of 720 runs (8 panel
members × 3 replicates × 2 operators × 5 days × 3 sites). Fifteen (15) Liat Analyzers and 3
Liat Influenza A/B Assay tube lots were used. The reproducibility panel comprises a high
negative, a low positive and a medium positive of each of Influenza A and B, and the assay
positive and negative controls. Percent agreement with expected result, mean Ct, and Ct
%CV for each site are shown below. The %CV for Influenza A ranged between 1.3% and
3.8% and that for Influenza B ranged between 1.1% and 3.4%. Total percent agreement was
≥99.9%.
The reproducibility panel samples were constructed by spiking viruses of known titer into
negative NPS matrix. A/NY/01/09 and B/Florida/04/06 were used in this study. The medium
positive, low positive, and high negative concentrations used for each of the strains
corresponded to C100 (4xLOD), C95 (1xLOD), and C5 (as determined by Probit analysis
using LOD data), respectively.
Positive and negative control panel members were the Liat assay positive and negative
controls. Positive control, comprising a mixture of inactivated flu A and B virus at
concentration close to LOD, was provided in a unit dose 5x solution. An additional step of
diluting the positive control 5x solution with UTM using a transfer pipette was required prior
to loading into the Liat tube. Negative control comprised UTM.

The six operators at 3 sites tested the members of the reproducibility panel in triplicate on 5
different days. Five (5) Liat Analyzers were used at each site for a total of 15 Liat Analyzers.
The sites also used different lots of Liat Influenza A/B Assay tubes for a total of 3 lots. A
total of 720 runs (8 panel members × 3 replicates × 2 operators × 5 days × 3 sites) were
performed.
The % total agreement with expected results, Ct average and Ct %CV for each panel member
from each site is shown below. For Ct data analysis, a Ct of 39.0 is used for all negative
results given the Ct cutoff of 38.5. %CV for Influenza A ranged between 1.3% and 3.8% and
that for Influenza B ranged between 1.1% and 3.4%.
Of the 90 total replicates, one Flu B high negative (C5) was detected as Inf B positive (1.1%

b. Inter-lot Precision
Inter-lot precision assesses the Liat tube manufacturing process as a potential source of assay
variability. Three lots of Liat Influenza A/B Assay tubes were tested with one Influenza A
strain at C95 (LOD, n=180), C100 (4xLOD, n=60) and C0 (negative NPS matrix, n=60).
Results from all runs agreed with expected results. Imprecision in Ct from inter-lot variability
was <1.8%.

Three Liat Influenza A/B Assay tube lots were manufactured at IQuum according to released
procedures. One hundred (100) Liat tubes were selected at random from each lot.
Influenza A/Brisbane/10/2007 was used as the sample in this study. The virus was spiked
into negative NPS matrix at C95 (LOD, 1.0x10-1 TCID /mL) or C100 (4xLOD, 4.0x10-1
50
TCID /mL). Negative samples (C0) comprised UTM without spiked virus. Samples were
50
aliquoted into unit dose quantities and stored at -80°C until use.
From each of the 3 Liat tube lots, 60 tubes were tested at C95 (n=180 total), 20 at C100
(n=60 total) and 20 at C0 (n=60 total). One operator performed all runs on one Liat Analyzer.
Testing occurred over 18 days, with an equal number of tubes from each lot being tested on
each day. A total of 300 runs were performed in this study.
Results for all tubes from all lots agreed with the expected results as shown below. One-way
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) showed no statistically significant difference in Ct between
lots (p-value = 0.63 for C95, and 0.52 for C100). Ct %CV due to inter-lot variation
(calculated as square root of the inter-lot variance (MS) divided by average Ct) was 1.6% for
C100 and 1.8% for C95 and is summarized below.

c. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
d. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Liat Influenza A/B Assay has 3 controls: (1) internal process control, (2) positive control
and (3) negative control.
Internal process control
The internal process control (IPC) comprises a bacteriophage MS2 that is pre-packed in each
Liat tube. The IPC is designed to be detected at a Ct of ~32 on the Liat Influenza A/B Assay,
similar to the Ct obtained from the 4x LOD concentration of Influenza viruses. When
conducting an assay, it is first mixed with sample and then processed through all the test
steps to monitor both the sample preparation and the RT-PCR reaction performance. The IPC
RNA is detected in a separate channel by MS2 specific primers and probe.
Positive Control
Positive control is provided in the Liat Influenza A/B Assay Quality Control Kit. The
positive control comprises a pooled sample of inactivated Influenza A and B virus. The
inactivated virus is obtained from ZeptoMetrix as individual NATtrol Influenza A and B
Viruses (NATFLUA-ST, A/Singapore/63/04 H1N1 and NATFLUB-ST,
B/Yamanishi/166/98). NATrol products are prepared from highly purified infectious viruses,
and are isolated from cell culture. Once purified, the virus is chemically and enzymatically
treated to alter its surface proteins. This treatment results in a completely intact viral particle
that is unable to bind, penetrate or infect a host cell. This viral particle, while modified on its
surface, still retains a complete viral genome in its core, making it the ideal control for all
steps of amplification assays.
The individual NATrol viruses are diluted and titered at IQuum to be detected at near LOD
Ct for Influenza A and B using Liat Influenza A/B Assay. The viruses are then pooled to
make the positive control solution. Positive control is provided in unit dose quantities as a 5x
solution. To use the positive control, an operator first dilutes the positive control using UTM
(also provided in unit dose) by transferring the entire contents of the Dilution UTM tube into
the positive control tube using a transfer pipette, mixing the sample and then transferring the
entire mixture into the Liat tube. The Liat tube is then run on a Liat Analyzer according to
the Instructions for Use.
The stability of positive control has been assessed using 3 lots. The studies show that the
positive control is stable for >3 months at 4ºC. The 3 month time point at 4ºC was the last
point tested and there was no significant change in the detected Inf A and B Ct and
amplitude. Based on this data, the labeled shelf life of the Quality Control Kit is 3 months.
The positive control is required to be run during the “Add Lot” process, where the Liat tube
lot is validated at the end user site. Additional positive control runs may be performed by the
end-user to confirm the performance of a Liat Analyzer and a Liat tube lot through positive
target detection, to check if there is a false negative result, or as required by the end user’s
quality control standards.
14

--- Page 15 ---
Negative Control
Negative control is provided in the Liat Influenza A/B Assay Quality Control Kit. The
negative control comprises UTM. The solution is provided in unit dose quantity and labeled
as Dilution UTM. To use the negative control, an operator transfers the entire contents of the
Dilution UTM tube into the Liat tube using a transfer pipette and runs the assay following the
Instructions for Use.
The negative control is required to be run during the “Add Lot” process. Additional negative
control runs may be performed by the end-user to check if contamination is present resulting
in a false positive result, or as required by the end user’s quality control standards.
e. Detection limit:
LOD studies determine the lowest detectable concentration of influenza virus at which
greater than or equal to 95% of all replicates test positive. The LOD of the Liat assay for
Influenza A and Influenza B was determined by limiting dilution studies using titered virus.
Three strains of Influenza A (A/Brisbane/10/2007, A/Brisbane/59/2007, and A/NY/01/2009)
and two strains of Influenza B (B/Malaysia/2506/04 and B/Florida/04/06) were used.
Virus strains obtained from ZeptoMetrix (Buffalo, NY) were cultured and re-titered using
TCID procedure before their use in LOD determination. Each characterized influenza
50
strain was first adjusted to the highest log10 TCID /mL in UTM as diluent. The working
50
viral stock was further serially diluted in 10 fold increments in UTM to obtain the test
concentrations.

To prepare the testing sample, the virus at different concentrations was spiked into a pooled
nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) sample matrix. NPS were collected throughout the study period
from healthy donors that did not show symptoms of flu. The swabs were eluted in UTM,
pooled, and then tested to confirm that this NPS matrix was negative for Influenza. Virus was
spiked into the NPS matrix at no more than 5% the final volume to prepare the test sample.
For each run, 100 μL of the spiked sample was added into the Liat Influenza A/B Assay Tube
according to the operation procedures indicated in the Liat Influenza A/B Assay Instructions
for Use (IFU). The Liat Tube was then inserted into the Liat Analyzer. Serial dilutions of the

characterized influenza viruses were tested in triplicates. The lowest concentration at which
all three replicates tested positive was treated as the tentative LOD for each strain. The LOD
of each strain was then confirmed by testing at least 20 replicates with concentrations at the
tentative LOD.
A total of 188 runs were performed in this study. Runs were performed on 27 Liat Analyzers
and primarily using 3 lots of Liat tubes.
The test concentrations and corresponding call rates (positive result/total replicates) for each
strain are listed below. The LOD of each strain was determined as the lowest concentration
resulting in positive detection of at least 19 out of 20 replicates.

limiting dilution studies using these titered viruses. The viruses were spiked into
nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) sample matrix, and then tested using the Liat Influenza A/B
Assay. The LOD was determined as the lowest log virus concentration that was detected
≥95% of the time (i.e. log concentration at which at least 19 out of 20 replicates tested
positive). The LOD for 3 strains of Influenza A were 10-2 to 10-1 TCID /mL, while those for

f. Analytical specificity (reactivity):
Reactivity study evaluates the ability of the Liat Influenza A/B Assay to detect influenza
strains representing temporal and geographical diversity. The Liat Influenza A/B Assay was
evaluated for reactivity with 22 Influenza A strains and 10 Influenza B strains. Influenza A
strains included 8 seasonal Influenza A/H1 strains, 8 seasonal Influenza A/H3 strains, 3
Influenza A 2009 H1N1 strains, 3 swine origin Influenza A strains. The Liat Influenza A/B
Assay detected all strains tested.
Cultured viral strains were obtained from ZeptoMetrix Corporation (Buffalo, NY), American
Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and Advanced Biotechnology (Columbia, MD). All
strains were frozen from the vendor and were accompanied by Certificate of Analysis
including TCID /mL or CEID /mL titer information.
50 50
Each viral strain under test was serially diluted in 10 fold increments in UTM using the same
procedure as that for the LOD study. The virus was then spiked in negative NPS matrix, and
100 μL of this spiked sample was tested using the Liat assay.
Each viral strain was tested in triplicate at the LOD for influenza strains used in LOD studies,
and at “near LOD” level for other strains. To estimate “near LOD” level, each strain was first
tested at 1.0×102 TCID /mL or 1.0×102 CEID /mL and then higher or lower concentrations
50 50
until a concentration that gave a Ct between 32 and 34 was determined. Given that the Ct at
LOD was 32-34 based on LOD study data, a Ct value in this range was used to estimate the
“near LOD” level. This concentration was then tested in triplicate to demonstrate reactivity.
If less than 3 / 3 runs are detected as positive, viral concentration was increased in log
increments until triplicate positive results are observed.
A total of 115 runs were performed in this study. Runs were preformed on primarily 13 Liat
Analyzers and using 2 lots of Liat tubes.

The Influenza strains tested for reactivity and the concentration of each strain that provided
3/3 positive results. At the determined “near LOD” level, all triplicate runs for each strain
were detected as positive, with average Ct in the 32-34 range. Data demonstrates that the Liat
Influenza A/B Assay is reactive against all strains tested.
g. Analytical specificity (Cross-reactivity):
Cross reactivity study evaluates the Liat Influenza A/B Assay’s potential cross-reactivity
with non-influenza respiratory pathogens and other microorganisms with which the majority
of the population may have been infected. The Liat assay was evaluated against a panel of 31
human pathogens. Bacteria were tested at 105–106 CFU/mL. Viruses were tested at 103–105
TCID /mL. The Liat Influenza A/B Assay showed no cross reactivity for the tested
50
organisms. The test panel comprised 15 viral and 16 bacterial strains. Cultured virus and
bacteria were obtained from ZeptoMetrix Corporation (Buffalo, NY), American Type
Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and Advanced Biotechnology (Columbia, MD). All
cultured viruses were frozen from the vendor and were accompanied by Certificate of
Analysis including TCID /mL titers. All bacteria were cultured and titered at IQuum
50
following receipt from vendor. Bacterial culture and titering were performed based on
methods described in Bacteriological Analytical Manual.
Each virus or bacteria was spiked individually into negative NPS matrix with the spiked
volume not exceeding 5% of the sample volume. The tested concentrations were ≥ 106

h. Interfering Microorganisms:
Interfering microorganism study evaluates whether non-influenza respiratory pathogens and
other microorganisms with which the majority of the population may have been infected can
interfere in the detection of Influenza A or B by the Liat assay. The panel of 31 human
pathogens tested in the cross-reactivity study was tested for potential interference. Bacteria
were tested at 105–106 CFU/mL and viruses were tested at 103–105 TCID /mL in the
50
presence of either A/Brisbane/59/2007 or B/Malaysia/2506/04 at 3x LOD concentration in
negative NPS matrix. One hundred microliters (100 μL) of the spiked sample was tested
using the Liat Influenza A/B Assay. Each microorganism was tested in triplicate with each of
A/Brisbane/59/2007 or B/Malaysia/2506/04. Results demonstrate that the presence of the
tested microorganisms do not interfere with the detection of Inf A or Inf B.

and using 3 lots of Liat tubes.
i. Interfering substances
The Liat Influenza A/B Assay was evaluated with potentially interfering substances that may
be encountered in respiratory specimens. Medically and/or physiologically relevant
concentrations of potential interferents were tested with 2 influenza A strains and 2 influenza
B strains at 3x LOD (10-1–10-2 TCID /mL). Results showed that substances tested did not
50
interfere in the detection of influenza A and B strains.

Each potential interferent was individually spiked into negative NPS matrix at the indicated
concentration along with one of the 4 influenza viruses. One hundred microliters (100 μL) of
these spiked samples were tested using the Liat assay. Each interferent and influenza virus
combination was tested in triplicate. Results were compared against a control containing no
spiked interferent. Nasal administered Influenza vaccine was not evaluated as part of this
study, and therefore the performance of this device in the presence of this potential
interferent can not be evaluated. A statement in the warnings and precautions has been
included.
A total of 132 runs were performed in this study. Runs were preformed primarily on 19 Liat
Analyzers and using 2 lots of Liat tubes.
All triplicate runs agreed with the expected results for all interfering substances tested. The
average Ct for testing each interfering substance is also shown below. Results showed that
substances tested did not interfere in the detection of influenza A and B strains.

j. Fresh vs. Frozen Equivalency
The Liat Influenza A/B Assay was tested by comparing its performance using fresh and
frozen specimens. One Influenza A strain (A/Brisbane/10/07) and one Influenza B strain
(B/Malaysia/2506/04) were individually spiked into negative NPS matrix at different levels
of viral load, including near LOD, and levels reflecting the clinical range. For each strain, 60

samples were tested immediately while another 60 samples were frozen at -80°C for 7 days,
thawed and then tested. The strains, test concentration, and number of replicates (n) are
shown below.
Comparing fresh and frozen sample results, Ct showed a delay of 0.5 Ct on average for flu A
and 1.2 Ct on average for flu B. Such Ct delay reflects the degradation of virus during freeze-
thaw cycle and is well established in the literature. However, fresh and frozen samples
demonstrated 100% detection across all levels of viral load, including those near LOD. This
demonstrates that sample freeze thaw had no effect on the detection of Influenza A and B by
the Liat Influenza A/B Assay. A total of 240 runs were performed in this study. Runs were
preformed on primarily 16 Liat Analyzers and using 1 lot of Liat tubes.

k. Assay cut-off:
The PCR crossing threshold (Ct) for different Influenza stains at LOD was determined to be
33.5 ± 0.8 (average ± standard deviation), with the maximum Ct average of 34.7. Using
Probit analysis for two Influenza strains (B/Florida/04/06 and A/NY/01/2009), the lowest Ct
was determined by linear regression. The Ct at the lowest detectable virus concentration (as
determined by Probit analysis) was estimated to be 37.3 for B/Florida/04/06 and 38 for
A/NY/01/2009. A Ct cutoff of 38.5 was selected for both Influenza A and Influenza B. In
order to reliably detect the Ct of 38.5 an additional 3.5 cycles are run after the indicated cut-
off Ct resulting in a total of 42 PCR cycles.
l. Carry-over/Cross-contamination:
The Liat Influenza A/B Assay utilizes a single-use consumable. All reagents are pre-packed
and stored in unit-dose quantities in tube segments contained within the disposable Liat tube.
Once the sample is loaded into the Liat tube, the tube remains closed during the entire assay

Liat Influenza A/B Assay against viral culture for Influenza A and B detection are shown
below.
No false negative results were detected in 435 NPS samples tested, while 13 false positives
according to culture results were reported for Influenza A and 24 false positive results
according to culture were reported for Influenza B. PCR and bi-directional sequencing were
used to investigate these discordant results. This method confirmed the Liat assay result in
the majority of samples tested (see footnotes in performance tables).
Overall, the Liat Influenza A/B Assay demonstrated 100% sensitivity (95% CI: 89.8% -
100.0%) and 96.8% specificity (95% CI: 94.5% - 98.1%) for Influenza A, and 100%
sensitivity (95% CI: 88.6% - 100.0%) and 94.1% specificity (95% CI: 91.3% - 96.0%) for
Influenza B.

Retrospective Samples
Data from retrospective samples were compared against PCR/sequencing as the reference
method. The two-by-two tables comparing Liat Influenza A/B Assay against
PCR/sequencing for Influenza A and B detection are shown below.
Of the 180 samples tested, 1 sample was indeterminate by PCR/sequencing, and was thus
excluded from the analysis.
Of 74 Influenza A positive retrospective samples, 44 were confirmed to be 2009 H1N1 and
20 were confirmed and A/H3 by PCR/sequencing; the remaining 10 samples were confirmed
to be Influenza A positive by PCR/sequencing but subtype sequencing was not successful.
The Liat Influenza A/B Assay detected all these samples as Influenza A positive.
In retrospective sample tests, the Liat Influenza A/B Assay demonstrated 100% positive
agreement (95% CI: 95.1% - 100.0%) and 97.1% negative agreement (95% CI: 91.9% -

N. Instrument Name:
Liat Analyzer
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Liat Analyzer functions as a point-of-care platform with sample-to-answer
capabilities in which all sample processing steps as well as detection are carried out using
a single-use, disposable Liat Tube.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes X or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Each test cartridge handles one sample and has a unique barcode identifier that is scanned
into the Liat Analyzer to code the sample ID. A nasopharyngeal swab sample is loaded
directly into a Liat assay tube using a transfer pipette. After the tube is capped, the Liat
Analyzer scans the tube barcode, and the tube is inserted into the analyzer.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimen sampling and handling is controlled using 11 sample processing modules
contained within the Liat Analyzer. The sample processing modules are composed of two
assemblies, a moving side assembly comprised of 11 sample processing plungers and 10
clamps and a fixed side assembly. When performing an assay, a Liat tube is inserted into
the tube slot of a Liat Analyzer. The plungers and clamps selectively compress the Liat
tube segments against the fixed side assembly to release reagents from the segments,
move the sample from one segment to another, and control reaction conditions.
