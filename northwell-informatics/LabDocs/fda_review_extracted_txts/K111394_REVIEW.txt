The MIC interpretive criteria for daptomycin are as follows:

Organism

Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus
agalactiae, and Streptococcus
≤ 1 - -
dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis
*Currently there are no intermediate or resistant interpretive criteria for daptomycin. The current
absence of data on daptomycin-resistant isolates precludes defining any categories other than
"Susceptible." Isolates yielding test results suggestive of a "Non-Susceptible" category should be
retested, and if the result is confirmed, the isolate should be submitted to a reference laboratory for
further testing.
*S = Susceptible: Attainable levels in blood or tissue on usual usage, including oral
administration when applicable.
I = Intermediate: The intermediate category implies clinical efficacy in body sites
where the drugs are physiologically concentrated (e.g. quinolones and B-lactams
in urine), or when a higher than normal dosage of drug can be used (e.g. B-
lactams). The “intermediate” category also includes a “buffer zone” which should
prevent small, uncontrolled, technical factors from causing major discrepancies in
interpretations, especially for drugs with narrow pharmacotoxicity margins.
R = Resistant to usually achievable systemic concentrations.

L. Test Principle:
The antimicrobial agent is diluted in water, buffer, or minute concentrations of broth
to concentrations bridging the range of clinical interest. Panels are rehydrated with
115 µg Mueller-Hinton Broth supplemented with 2-5% lysed horse blood (LHB),
after inoculation of the broth with a standardized suspension of the organism. After
incubation in a non-CO incubator for 20-24 hours, the minimum inhibitory
2
concentration (MIC) for the test organism is manually read by visually observing the
lowest antimicrobial concentration showing inhibition of growth. Alternatively, the
panel can be incubated in and read by the MicroScan® WalkAway® System.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three study sites.
Each site tested a minimum of 10 on-scale reproducibility organisms per
antimicrobial agent. Selection of isolates included organisms with on-scale
expected results for each antimicrobial agent included in this study. These
isolates may have been selected from the challenge isolates.
Reproducibility was performed using plates with long dilution range and
shortened dilution range (mapped). Because mapped dilutions have narrow
range, several MIC values were off-scale. Only reproducibility calculations
from the long dilution range are presented here.
Reproducibility was calculated as the percent of results for the combined sites
which were within +/- one doubling dilution of the mode MIC value for all

--- Page 6 ---
sites. Each reproducibility organism was tested in triplicate on the dried Test
panel and singly on the frozen reference panel on three different days at each
site. Dried test panels were tested with the turbidity inoculation method and
read manually and on the MicroScan WalkAway System.
For reproducibility calculations, off-scale values are handled in two ways;
“best case” and “worst case” scenarios. Best case calculation for
reproducibility assumes the off-scale result is within one well from the mode
MIC value. Worst case calculation for reproducibility assuming the off-scale
result is greater than one well from the mode MIC value.
The overall best case and worst case reproducibility values for manual read
and WalkAway for long dilution range are shown below. These results met
the acceptance criteria.
Inoculation Read % Reproducible % Reproducible
Method Method
(Best case-all sites) (Worst case-all sites)
Turbidity Manual 98.5 98.5
WalkAway 97.4 (94.8)* 94.8
* Value in parentheses reflect the calculation made for off-scale values which were not
included in the “Best Case” calculation because the off-scale results were several doubling
dilutions from the mode and values are confirmed to be greater than one well from the mode.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended QC isolates were tested a sufficient number of times with
acceptable results with the reference method. The MICroSTREP plus -
Daptomycin test results demonstrate that the system can produce QC results in
the recommended range.
Daptomycin quality control data from combined sites is shown below. For S.
pneumoniae, the data is from 3 testing sites. QC data was analyzed for the
long dilution range and shortened dilution range (mapped). At least 25 test
results were available at each site. The combined QC data is shown in the
following table.

All QC values were in the expected range except for two results by each
reading method, which were one doubling dilution above the range. For the
Manual read, 109/111 (98.2%) test results were in range and for Microscan
WalkAway, 107/109 (98.2%) test results were in range. QC test results with
the new device were within the expected range >95% of the time, which is
acceptable.
Inoculum density checks showed acceptable results for QC organisms, as well
as a select number of challenge and clinical isolates. All results were within
the expected range.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical testing was performed at three sites using fresh isolates supplemented
with stock isolates of Streptococcus spp. A comparison of the MICroSTREP
plus - Daptomycin test panel results was made to the reference method as
recommended in the CLSI standard M7-A6 with the following deviations
from that recommendation: Pluronic-F was used as the inoculum in the frozen
reference panels. This is composed of water which contains a very small
amount (0.1) of Pluronic to provide a smoother draw of liquid into the
inoculator. Testing of the reference method and the MicroScan panels was

performed at the same time. A challenge set was also tested at one site and
compared to the reference broth dilution result mode that was determined by
previous testing of each isolate multiple times in the recommended reference
panel. All isolates tested grew in the MicroScan panels.
MicroScan MICroSTREP plus - Daptomycin and CLSI reference broth
microdilution results were compared based on the guidelines provided in the
AST Guidance Document. Essential agreement (EA) is when the
MICroSTREP plus agree with the reference test panel results exactly or
within one doubling dilution of the reference method. Category agreement
(CA) is when the MICroSTREP plus result interpretation agrees exactly with
the reference panel result interpretation based on interpretive criteria. The
%EA and %CA results were acceptable.
According to the approved drug label for daptomycin, only a susceptible
interpretive category is defined. There are no intermediate or resistance
interpretive categories. In this study, no isolates were noted to have MICs
outside the susceptible category by the reference method. There were 2 cases in
this study in which MicroScan MICroSTREP plus results gave a Daptomycin
categorical interpretation that was not in agreement with the reference broth
dilution MIC (Reference interpretation was “susceptible” while the MicroScan
MICroSTREP plus interpretation was “non-susceptible).
Labeling will recommend that isolates yielding a “non-susceptible” category
should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.
A total of 281 (214 fresh/67 stock) clinical isolates of Streptococcus spp.
were evaluated at 3 clinical study sties. There were 107 Streptococcus
pyogenes, 145 Streptococcus agalactiae and 29 other beta hemolytic
streptococci belonging to Group C and Group G (Streptococcus dysgalactiae
subsp. equisimilis). A total of 50 stock challenge isolates were also included
and were tested at one site.
Combined results from clinical and challenge studies demonstrated an overall
EA of 97% (321/331) and an overall CA of 99.3% (329/331) for the mapped
(shortened) dilution range.
The performance evaluation summary of essential and category agreement
results for challenge and clinical strains is shown in the tables below. Only
results from manual read (primary method) are shown below for the long and
short (mapped) dilution range. WalkAway read gave similar results to manual
read.

*Daptomycin MIC values that were 2 doubling dilutions above the reference MIC were obtained for 5 isolates. However, this did not
cause a categorical error except for 1 isolate. This data is acceptable because of the high category agreement.
