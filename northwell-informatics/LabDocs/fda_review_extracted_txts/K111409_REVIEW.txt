H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The APTIMA COMBO 2 Assay is a target amplification nucleic acid probe test that
utilizes target capture for the in vitro qualitative detection and differentiation of
ribosomal RNA (rRNA) from Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and/or Neisseria
gonorrhoeae (GC) to aid in the diagnosis of chlamydial and/or gonococcal urogenital
disease using the PANTHER System as specified.
On the PANTHER System, the assay may be used to test the following specimens
from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals: clinician-collected endocervical,
vaginal and male urethral swab specimens, clinician-collected gynecological specimens
collected in the PreservCyt Solution, and patient-collected vaginal swab specimens.1
1Patient-collected vaginal swab specimens are an option for screening women when a pelvic
exam is not otherwise indicated. The vaginal swab specimen collection kit is not for home use.

I. Device Description:
The APTIMA COMBO 2 Assay combines the technologies of target capture, TMA, and
DKA.
Specimens are collected and transferred into their respective specimen transport tubes.
The transport solutions in these tubes release the rRNA targets and protect them from
degradation during storage. When the APTIMA COMBO 2 Assay is performed in the
laboratory, the target rRNA molecules are isolated from specimens by use of capture
oligomers via target capture that utilizes magnetic microparticles. The capture
oligomers contain sequences complementary to specific regions of the target molecules
as well as a string of deoxyadenosine residues. A separate capture oligomer is used for
each target. During the hybridization step, the sequence specific regions of the capture
2

--- Page 3 ---
oligomers bind to specific regions of the target molecules. The capture oligomer-target
complex is then captured out of solution by decreasing the temperature of the reaction
to room temperature. This temperature reduction allows hybridization to occur between
the deoxyadenosine region on the capture oligomer and the poly-deoxythymidine
molecules that are covalently attached to the magnetic particles. The microparticles,
including the captured target molecules bound to them, are pulled to the side of the
reaction vessel using magnets and the supernatant is aspirated. The particles are
washed to remove residual specimen matrix that may contain amplification reaction
inhibitors. After the target capture steps are completed, the specimens are ready for
amplification.
Target amplification assays are based on the ability of complementary oligonucleotide
primers to specifically anneal and allow enzymatic amplification of the target nucleic
acid strands. The APTIMA COMBO 2 Assay replicates a specific region of the 23S
rRNA from CT and a specific region of the 16S rRNA from GC via DNA
intermediates. A unique set of primers is used for each target molecule. Detection of
the rRNA amplification product sequences (amplicon) is achieved using nucleic acid
hybridization. Single-stranded chemiluminescent DNA probes, which are
complementary to a region of each target amplicon, are labeled with different
acridinium ester molecules. The labeled DNA probes combine with amplicon to form
stable RNA:DNA hybrids. The Selection Reagent differentiates hybridized from
unhybridized probe, eliminating the generation of signal from unhybridized probe.
During the detection step, light emitted from the labeled RNA:DNA hybrids is
measured as photon signals in a luminometer, and are reported as Relative Light Units
(RLU). In DKA, differences in the kinetic profiles of the CT and GC labeled probes
allow for the differentiation of signal; kinetic profiles are derived from measurements
of photon output during the detection read time. The chemiluminescent detection
reaction for CT signal has very rapid kinetics and has the “flasher” kinetic type. The
chemiluminescent detection reaction for GC signal is relatively slower and has the
“glower” kinetic type. Assay results are determined by a cut-off based on the total
RLU and the kinetic curve type.

Analytical performance of the APTIMA COMBO 2 assay on the PANTHER System
1. Analytical Sensitivity Study
Chlamydia trachomatis analytical sensitivity (limits of detection) was determined by directly
comparing dilutions of CT organisms in the APTIMA COMBO 2 assay. The analytical
sensitivity claim for the assay is 1 IFU/assay (7.25 IFU/swab, 9.75 IFU/mL, PreservCyt Solution
liquid Pap). However, dilutions of less than 1 IFU/assay tested positive in the APTIMA COMBO
2 Assay (for this study, 100% positivity was observed in samples containing CT concentrations
of 0.03 IFU/mL).
Neisseria gonorrhoeae analytical sensitivity (limits of detection) was determined by directly
comparing dilutions of GC organisms in the APTIMA COMBO 2 Assay. The analytical
sensitivity claim for the assay is 50 cells/assay (362 cells/swab, 488 cells/mL PreservCyt
Solution liquid Pap). However, dilutions of less than 50 cells/assay tested positive in the
APTIMA COMBO 2 Assay (for this study, 100% positivity was observed in samples containing
GC concentrations of 0.04 CFU/mL).
2. Within Laboratory Precision Study
APTIMA COMBO 2 Assay precision was evaluated at Gen-Probe using the PANTHER System.
Testing was performed using three PANTHER Systems and three lots of assay reagents. Testing
was performed over 24 days.
The panel members were created using negative PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap specimens and
STM. The positive panel members were created by spiking CT and/or GC organisms to the
targeted concentrations shown in the table below.

3. Carryover Studies for the PANTHER System
A multi-run analytical study was conducted using spiked panels on three PANTHER Systems.
Carryover was assessed using approximately 20% high titer GC samples dispersed between
negative samples. The runs included clusters of high positive samples with clusters of negative
samples as well as single high positives dispersed in a specific pattern within the run. High titer
samples were made using GC rRNA spiked into STM to give a final concentration equivalent to
2.5 x 105 CFU/mL. Testing was carried out using 5 runs on each of three PANTHER Systems.
Carryover was calculated from a total of 2938 valid negative results.
The overall carryover rate was 0% with a 95% confidence interval of 0–0.1%.

4. Analytical Specificity
The APTIMA COMBO 2 Assay formulation for the PANTHER System has not changed from
that used with DTS Systems or the TIGRIS DTS System. The analytical specificity study was
conducted on DTS Systems. A total of 154 culture isolates were evaluated using the APTIMA
COMBO 2 Assay. These isolates included 86 organisms that may be isolated from the urogenital
tract and 68 additional organisms that represent a phylogenetic cross-section of organisms. The
tested organisms included bacteria, fungi, yeast, parasites, and viruses. All organisms except C.
psittaci, C. pneumoniae, and the viruses were tested at 1.0 x 106 cells/assay in STM. The
Chlamydia and Neisseria organisms were tested in PreservCyt solution medium. C. psittaci and
C. pneumoniae were tested at 1.0 x 105 IFU/assay. The viruses were tested as follows: (a) herpes
simplex viruses I and II: 2.5 x 104 TCID50/assay, (b) human papilloma virus 16: 2.9 x 106 DNA
copies/assay and (c) cytomegalovirus: 4.8 x 105 infected cell culture cells/assay. Only CT and
GC samples produced positive results in the APTIMA COMBO 2 Assay.
5. Interfering Substances
The APTIMA COMBO 2 Assay formulation for the PANTHER System has not changed from
that used with DTS Systems or the TIGRIS DTS System. Blood interference was evaluated on
the PANTHER System and the results of this testing indicated that blood does not interfere with
APTIMA COMBO 2 Assay performance.
APTIMA COMBO 2 Assay performance in the presence of potentially interfering substances
was tested on DTS Systems.The following interfering substances were individually spiked into
Swab and PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap specimens: 10% blood, contraceptive jelly, spermicide,
moisturizer, hemorrhoidal anesthetic, body oil, powder, anti-fungal cream, vaginal lubricants,
feminine spray and leukocytes (1.0 x 106 cells/mL). All were tested for potential assay
interference in the absence and presence of CT and GC at the estimated rRNA equivalent of 1.0
CT IFU/assay (5 fg/assay) and 50 GC cells/assay (250 fg/assay). The rRNA equivalents were
calculated based on the genome size and estimated DNA:RNA ratio/cell of each organism. No
interference was observed with any of the tested substances. No inhibitors of amplification were
observed in the APTIMA COMBO 2 Assay.
Clinical performance of the APTIMA COMBO 2 assay on the PANTHER System
Prevalence
The prevalence of CT and GC in patient populations depends on risk factors such as age, gender,
the presence or absence of symptoms, the type of clinic, and the sensitivity of the test used to
detect infections. A summary of the prevalence of three CT and GC disease outcomes, as
determined by the APTIMA COMBO 2 Assay on the PANTHER System in the clinical trial, is
shown in Tables 2, 3, and 4 by specimen type and clinical site.

Clinical Study Results
A prospective, multicenter clinical study was conducted to establish the performance
characteristics of the APTIMA COMBO 2 Assay on the PANTHER System. Specimens were
collected from symptomatic and asymptomatic men (n=580) and women (n=1332) enrolled from
7 geographically and ethnically diverse US clinical sites, including obstetrics and gynecology,
family planning, public health, and STD clinics. Subjects were classified as symptomatic if
symptoms were reported by the subject. Subjects were classified as asymptomatic if the subject
did not report symptoms. Of the 580 male subjects, none were <18 years of age, 72 were 18 to 20
years of age, 201 were 21 to 25 years of age, and 307 were >25 years of age. Of the 1332 female
subjects, 11 were 14 to 15 years of age, 59 were 16 to 17 years of age, 319 were 18 to 20 years of
age, 401 were 21 to 25 years of age, and 542 were >25 years of age.
Up to 2 specimens were collected from each male subject (1 urethral swab and 1 first-catch
urine, in that order) and up to 4 specimens were collected from each female subject (1 first-catch
urine, 1 vaginal swab, 1 PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap specimen, and 1 endocervical swab, in
that order). All specimens were clinician-collected except urine specimens and approximately
half of the vaginal swab specimens, which were collected by the subject at the clinic.
Approximately half of the PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap specimens were collected with a
broom-type device and half were collected with a spatula and cytobrush. Samples were prepared
for APTIMA testing in accordance with the appropriate APTIMA specimen collection kit
package insert instructions.
All evaluable samples (567 male urethral swab, 1319 vaginal swab, 1330 PreservCyt, and 1310
endocervical swab samples) were tested with the APTIMA COMBO 2 Assay on the PANTHER
System in accordance with package insert instructions. The samples were split amongst three
laboratories (two external laboratories and GEN-PROBE). Samples with initial invalid,
equivocal, or error results were retested. Eighteen (18) male urethral swab, 25 vaginal swab, 1
PreservCyt, and 37 endocervical swab specimens had final invalid results and were excluded
from the analyses. Most of the invalid results were due to insufficient sample volume. One
vaginal swab and 1 endocervical swab had final CT equivocal results and 1 PreservCyt and 1
endocervical swab had final GC equivocal results and were excluded from the analyses.
Male urethral swab, male and female urine, and PreservCyt samples were tested with cleared
nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) to establish the infected status. The infected status
algorithm used results from two specimen types and two reference NAATs. Subjects were
categorized as infected if a positive result occurred in each of the 2 reference NAATs. For
female subjects, if the positive NAAT results occurred only in the urine specimens and not in the
PreservCyt specimens, the subject was categorized as infected; however, for the evaluation of the
non-urine specimen types, the specimens were considered non-infected. Subjects that could not
be categorized as infected or not infected were excluded from the performance analyses.

Chlamydia trachomatis Performance Results
Performance characteristics of the APTIMA COMBO 2 Assay were estimated by comparing
PANTHER System results to the infected status algorithm. Table 6 shows the sensitivity,
specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the
APTIMA COMBO 2 Assay for CT detection and the prevalence of CT (based on the infected
status) in each specimen type.

Reproducibility Study
APTIMA Combo 2 Assay reproducibility was evaluated at two external US laboratories and at
Gen-Probe using the PANTHER System. Testing was performed using one lot of assay reagents
and a total of six operators (two at each site). At each site, testing was performed over at least 10
days.
Reproducibility panel members were created using negative specimens processed with the
APTIMA Specimen Collection Kit. The positive panel members were created by spiking with
CT and/or GC organisms to result in panel members with expected targeted concentrations.
Table 17 shows the CT and GC concentrations for each panel member. Table 17 presents, for
each panel member, RLU data in terms of mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of
variation (CV) between sites, between operators, between days, between runs, within runs, and
overall. Percent agreement with expected results is also shown. Samples with valid results were
included in the analyses.
