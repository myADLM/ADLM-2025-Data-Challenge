L. Test Principle:
ST2 (for growth STimulation expressed gene 2; also known as IL1RL1, or Interleukin-1
Receptor-Like 1) is a member of the interleukin-1 receptor family. The ST2 protein has two
isoforms directly implicated in the progression of cardiac disease: soluble ST2 and a cell
membrane-bound isoform, ST2L. When soluble ST2 levels are low, ST2’s ligand, IL-33, is
available to bind to ST2L and has a cardioprotective effect resulting in preserved cardiac
function. However, when soluble ST2 levels are high, soluble ST2 competitively binds to IL-
33, making it less likely to bind to ST2L and thereby making IL-33 unavailable for
cardioprotective signaling. As a result, the heart is subjected to greater stress in the presence
of high levels of soluble ST2, leading to cellular death and tissue fibrosis, reduced cardiac
function, and increasing the rate of disease progression (Kakkar & Lee 2008; Seki et al.
2009).

a 96-well microtiter plate format for measurement of soluble ST2 in serum or plasma (EDTA
or heparin). A mouse monoclonal anti-human ST2 antibody is coated onto the surface of the
microtiter plate wells and acts as the capture antibody to bind ST2 molecules in solution. A
second mouse monoclonal anti-human ST2 antibody is biotinylated and functions as the
tracer antibody for detecting ST2 molecules that have bound to the capture antibody. After
binding of Streptavidin-HRP to the tracer antibody, a substrate is added which yields a blue
color that absorbs at 450 nm. The absorbance is proportional to the ST2 levels in the
specimens. The test results of the specimens are read from the standard curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Study Protocol:
Assay precision was evaluated according to CLSI EP5-A2 Guidelines at two CLIA-certified
clinical laboratories as well as the sponsor’s internal lab, for a total of 3 sites. EDTA plasma
pools at 3 different ST2 concentrations, one in the normal reference range (low), one near the
35 ng/ml cutpoint (medium) and one at an elevated concentration (high) were prepared from
plasma purchased from a commercial vender. A set of 20 aliquots of each pool was prepared
and shipped to each testing site so that all 3 sites analyzed the same test materials and all used
assay materials from the same lot of kits. All 3 sites followed the same test protocol
performing 2 runs per day with 4 replicates of each test sample per run for 20 consecutive
days.
Result Summary:
Results of within-run and total precision were summarized in the below tables.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Study Protocol:
Linearity was evaluated following CLSI guideline EP6-A. A direct dilution series of 11
test samples was prepared by mixing the high patient plasma pool and low patient plasma
pool obtained from a commercial source at different ratios. The high patient pool was
prepared at a ST2 concentration slightly greater than the 200.0 ng/ml upper limit of the
standard curve and the low concentration pool had a mean concentration of 3.2 ng/ml, a
value just above the proposed lower range of 3.1 ng/mL. Each test sample was measured
in replicates of 4.
Result Summary:
Data from the linearity analysis demonstrated that the tested replicates were highly
consistent with CV values of <5% across the entire concentration range and linear with
coefficient of R2 = 0.999, liner regression of Y=0.99 X-0.97
Conclusion:
The result support the sponsor claimed measuring range of 3.1 to 200.0 ng/ml, which is
the full dynamic range of the assay calibration curve.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and value assignment:
Calibrators
Calibrators (Standard included in each assay kit, provided lyophilized at 400 ng/vial) are
prepared using purified recombinant ST2 protein. Concentration is determined by Bradford
protein assay and confirmed using the Presage ST2 Assay. The calibrator is normalized to a
“gold standard” stock of the initial preparation of recombinant ST2 protein that was used as
the antigen to generate hybridomas of the ST2 antibody.
Controls
Controls are produced at 2 target concentrations using recombinant ST2 protein in
delipidized human serum matrix. The lower control (C1) is formulated with a target ST2
concentration between 18.8 ng/ml and 30.0 ng/ml and corresponds to a normal concentration
range. The higher control (C2) is formulated with a target ST2 concentration between 65.0
ng/ml and 85.0 ng/ml and corresponds to the concentration range of patients with severe
cardiac disease and worse prognosis. Lot-specific ranges are assigned by testing a minimum
of 3 vials per lot, each vial in duplicate, over 3 days. The average of all control values for

each level is calculated and reported on the Certificate of Analysis along with the ± 10%
performance range.
Stability:
The Presage ST2 Assay Kit and Presage ST2 Controls were evaluated for storage
stability at various temperatures and for successively longer periods of time, up to 12
months. Stability study protocol and the acceptance criteria have been reviewed and
found to be acceptable.
• Presage ST2 Assay Kit
Shelf-life Stability:
Real-time testing supports a shelf life of 12 months when stored at 2-8°. However,
exposure to elevated temperatures, 37°C or above, for even a brief time (1 day) or a
prolonged period (≥4 months) of exposure to room temperature results in
compromised performance of the product as evaluated by the characteristics of the
standard curve, specifically the decrease in standard curve slope over time.
Consequently, the sponsor stated in the labeling that care should be taken to ensure
that the product is always maintained at refrigerated temperatures until ready to use,
including the use of cold packs during shipment.
Open-Vial Stability:
Not applicable.
• Presage ST2 Control
Shelf-life Stability:
Testing has demonstrated a closed bottle shelf-life of 1 year, stored at 2-8ºC.
Open-Vial Stability:
Testing has demonstrated an open bottle stability of 7 days after reconstitution,
capped at 2-8ºC
• Test Sample
Stability of samples stored at different conditions was evaluated using 12 plasma
samples collected from the ER department of a hospital. Baseline ST2 plasma
concentrations were determined immediately after blood collection, and at the same
time the plasma samples were aliquoted into 1.5 ml plastic tubes which were stored at
the specified temperatures for various amount of time. % Recovery from the baseline
were calculated for each sample and plotted against time of storage. The sponsor’s
acceptance criterion for analyte stability was that the mean % recovery of the 12
plasma samples is >=90%.
Analyte freeze/thaw stability was evaluated at 0, 5, 10 and 15 cycles using 5
7

--- Page 8 ---
commercial EDTA plasma samples. Linear regression analysis showed that none of
the samples tested resulted in a slope that significantly deviated from the baseline
over the course of 15 freeze/thaw cycles and had an average CV of 4%. This analysis
confirms that ST2 is not significantly affected by sample freeze/thaw cycles.
Based on the testing results, the sponsor made the following recommendation in the
labeling:
Storage conditions Sample stability
-20°C and -80°C 18 months
4°C 7 days
20°C 48 hours
The sponsor also stated that “ST2 in EDTA-plasma is not significantly affected by
sample freeze/thaw cycles and has been shown to be stable for 15 freeze-thaw
cycles.”
d. Detection limit:
• Analytical sensitivity was determined per CLSI EP17-A.
For LoB determination, calibrator diluent (fetal bovine serum), was measured over 4
days, with 16 replicates per day giving 64 determinations in total. LoB was calculated
as LoB = μ + 1.645 σ where μB and σ are the mean and standard deviation values
B B B
respectively.
For LoD determination, 60 replicates of 4 different low ST2 concentration human
plasma samples ( were measured in sets of 15 replicates each over 4 consecutive
days. LoD was calculated as LoD = LoB + 1.645σ
S
The same sample measurements used for the LoD determination were used to
estimate bias and imprecision. LoQ was calculated as LoQ = bias +2xSDs
The resulting values from this analysis are summarized in the following table.
Parameter ST2 Value (ng/ml)
Limit of Blank (LoB) 0.5
Limit of Detection (LoD) 1.8
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) 2.4
• The sponsor claimed that the assay has a measuring range from 3.1 to 200 ng/mL.

Interference testing was performed on 5 most common endogenous substances i.e.
total protein (BSA); triglycerides; hemoglobin; cholesterol; and bilirubin as well as
49 common therapeutic substances.
Endogenous Substances
Three human EDTA plasma pools with low (~15 ng/ml); medium (~25 ng/ml); and
high (~100 ng/ml) concentrations of ST2 were used in this study. Potentially
interfering test substances were added at low and high levels to each plasma pool and
assayed in sets of 8 replicates. The sponsor defines no significant interference as
<10% difference between the spiked and the control (solvent only) samples. No
significant interference was observed on any of the substances/concentrations tested
as summarized in the below table.
Endogenous Concentration tested

Hemoglobin 100 200
Bilirubin 10 30
Cholesterol (total) 150 500
Triglycerides (total) 150 3000
Based on these result, the sponsor concluded in the labeling that no significant
interference was observed from: Bilirubin < 30 mg/dl, Hemoglobin < 200 mg/dl,
Triglycerides < 3000 mg/dl, Cholesterol < 500 mg/dl, Total protein (BSA) <6000
mg/dl.
Therapeutic Substances
A plasma sample pooled from 5 normal individuals was used in the testing of 49
common therapeutic substances. Each substance was tested at two concentrations per
CLSI EP7-A2 recommendations or at 1x and 5x normal therapeutic levels if the
substances are not described in CLSI EP7-A2. The mean of 8 replicate measurements
was used to calculate the deviation between the spiked and the solvent only plasma
samples. The sponsor defines no significant interference as <10% difference between
the spiked and the control samples. Among the 49 commonly used drugs tested, 6
substances had nominal >10% deviations from the controls and are tested further
using plasma pools with ST concentrations at low (~15 ng/ml), medium (~35 ng/ml)
and high (~90 ng/ml). None of the compounds tested showed an effect of >=10%
change from the control in any of the plasma pools.
Based on these result, the sponsor concluded in the labeling that no significant
interference was observed from the commonly used therapeutic substances as listed in
the below Table.

• Cross-Reactivity
Study Protocol:
ST2 is recognized to be structurally and genetically related to the interleukin-1
receptor class of molecules but has not been shown to exhibit significant sequence
homology (Tominaga et al. 1989). To confirm that the ST2 assay does not cross react
with proteins from this class of receptors, a representative set of three (3) molecules
was tested, including: 1) human interleukin-1 soluble receptor type I (IL-1 sR-1); 2)
recombinant human IL-Iα; 3) recombinant human IL-Iß". Each molecule was tested at
equimolar and 5x molar concentrations of ST2. Evaluations at each test concentration
were performed in replicates of 8.
Results and Conclusion:
Based on the results summarized in the below table, the sponsor concluded that none
of the three molecules tested, at concentrations 1x and 5x the measured ST2
concentration, exhibited measurable cross reactivity. A summary of the cross
reactivity test is presented in the below table.

The intended use of the Presage® ST2 Assay as an aid in assessing the prognosis of
patients diagnosed with chronic heart failure was established in an analysis of the HF-
ACTION (Heart Failure: A Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exercise
TraiNing) study. HF-ACTION was a multicenter, randomized, controlled, blinded trial of
2,331 patients with chronic heart failure that compared patients in the exercise training
group vs. patients in the usual care group. Patients were randomized from April 2003
through February 2007 within the United States, Canada, and France. A complete
description of the design of HF-ACTION has been published previously (Whellan et al.
2007). Plasma samples from a total of 912 patients from this cohort were available for
biomarker analysis. Sensitivity analysis was performed comparing the set of 912 HF-
ACTION subjects having evaluable ST2 values with all other HF-ACTION participants, and
it was found that the clinical validation results based on the evaluable set of subjects were
robust and representative of the larger study population.
Results:
(cid:190) A Kaplan-Meier analysis using the cutpoint of 35 ng/ml in the HF-ACTION
Study is presented in Figure 1. Mortality risk is higher in patients with ST2 >35
ng/ml (log rank p<0.001).

(cid:190) ST2 is also prognostic for clinical outcomes in addition to all-cause mortality.
Figures 2 through 4 summarize a quantitative analysis of ST2 at 35 ng/ml as a
predictor of all-cause mortality, all-cause hospitalization, cardiovascular
mortality, and cardiovascular hospitalization, respectively.

As illustrated in Figures 2-5 absolute event rates in patient with ST2 >35 ng/ml for
the endpoints of all-cause mortality, all-cause hospitalization, CVD mortality, and
CVD hospitalization are higher than for those patients with ST2 ≤35 ng/ml. These
results are summarized in the below Table. Duration of follow-up in this study is 4

(cid:190) Multivariate Covariate Risk-Adjusted Analysis
Using Cox proportional hazards models of ST2 as a dichotomous marker at 35 ng/ml
shows that ST2 is a statistically significant predictor of all clinical endpoints assessed
in this study i.e. all-cause mortality within 1 year, all-cause mortality within study,
all-cause hospitalization within study, death due to CVD within study, and
hospitalization due to CVD within study. Results from Multivariate Covariate Risk-
Adjusted Analysis are summarized in the below table. Variables in this adjusted
model include age, gender, NYHA class, eGFR, LVEF, diabetes status, hypertension
status and smoking status. Importantly the prognostic utility of the Presage ST2
Assay is not adversely influenced by the common confounders; age, gender and renal
function (eGFR).

(cid:190) Use of ST2 in Conjunction with Natriuretic Peptides
ST2 and natriuretic peptides, such as NT-proBNP, are measures of separate and
distinct biological processes. ST2 and natriuretic peptides provide independent and
complementary prognostic information. Table below summarizes an analysis of ST2,
at 35 ng/ml, and NT-proBNP, at the study median value of 852 pg/ml, for assessment
of risk of mortality within the study follow-up period.

4. Clinical cut-off:
The ST2 analysis cutpoint of 35 ng/mL was selected by choosing a Presage ST2 Assay
concentration value above the 90th and below the 95th percentile of the Reference Group
(See section M [5] Expected values/Reference range below for further details).
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Soluble ST2 concentrations representative of the general population were determined
from 490 individuals (245 women and 245 men) in a reference group of donors from two
sources selected for this purpose. Donor group one was comprised of 240 individuals
from a reference laboratory. Donor group two was comprised of 250 individuals recruited
by a commercial vender. All donors were self declared to be healthy with no history of
heart disease. No other inclusion or exclusion criteria were applied. Demographic
information collected on these donors is summarized in the Tables below. In summary
this population included apparently healthy individuals, selected without regard to
diabetes, hypertension, pulmonary disease, and renal insufficiency status.
