L. Test Principle:
Glucose in the blood sample reacts with glucose oxidase on the test strip and an electrical
current is produced. This current is measured by the meter and displayed as the blood
glucose result. The strength of these currents changes with the amount of glucose in the
blood sample. The meter automatically interprets this reaction. Glucose measurements are
reported as plasma equivalents.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
The Medisign MM1000, MM1100, MM1200, MM1000 Multi, MM1100 Multi, and
MM1200 Multi blood glucose monitoring systems are identical in technological
characteristics. All six test systems use the same test strips and are identical with the
exception of their names, meter cover appearance, and indications for use (single- vs.
multiple-patient use); therefore, one set of performance data was provided.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability studies were carried out by testing venous blood at five venous blood
glucose concentrations (HCT 42%) ranging from 42-332 mg/dL. Three lots of
MM1000 glucose test strips were tested on ten MM1000 glucose meters with ten
replicates per meter. To evaluate intermediate precision, the sponsor tested three
levels of control solutions on ten MM1000 glucose meters and three lots of MM1000
glucose test strips over the course of 10 days. The mean, standard deviation (SD),
and coefficients of variation (CV) were determined for each level as summarized
below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was carried out using nine different levels of venous whole blood
sample ranging from 18, 48, 65, 147, 272, 374, 452, 561, and 610 mg/dL (42% HCT)
as determined by the YSI reference method. Samples were altered to reach the low
and high end of the glucose concentration range. Each glucose level was measured
with one lot of glucose test strips on two MM1100 glucose meters. Least-square
regression analysis is summarized below.
Linearity Data Summary
Regression Data
Equation y=1.026x-3.57
Slope - 95% CI 1.001 to 1.014
Intercept - 95% CI -8.428 to -3.545
r2 0.998
The claimed reportable range of the MM1000, MM1100, MM1200, MM1000multi,
MM1100multi, and MM1200 multi blood glucose monitoring systems is 20 to 600
mg/dL. Samples below or above the claimed measuring range are flagged by the
meter as “LO” or “HI”, respectively.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The Medisign blood glucose monitoring systems are factory calibrated and further
calibration by the user is not necessary for operation. The calibration is traceable to
NIST SRM #917c.
Test Strip Stability
Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria for the Medisign test strips were
reviewed and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer claims a shelf life stability of
18 months and an open-vial stability of 3 months at the recommended storage
temperatures of 4-30°C.
Controls Value Assignment and Stability
Value assignment for the control solutions is based on repeat testing using twenty-
five Medisign test strips for every lot of test strips and five Medisign glucose meters.
Value ranges are as follows:

d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the Medisign blood glucose monitoring systems is 20 to 600
mg/dL. This range was verified by the linearity study (see section M.1.b of this
decision summary).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interferences studies were performed by adding common endogenous and exogenous
substances to two sets of venous blood samples at 140-180 mg/dL and 250-350
mg/dL plasma glucose and calculating bias relative to a control of the same samples.
Studies done by collecting five replicates using one test strip lot at a therapeutic and a
toxic level of each common endogenous and exogenous compound. Significant
interference was defined by the sponsor as >10% bias. No significant interference
was observed up to the levels shown in the table below for the following interfering
substances:

--- Page 14 ---
The sponsor recommends the use of at least one of two available Medisign control levels
(levels A and B) with this system. These controls are available when requested by the
customer using the contact information provided in the user manual. When the test strip
is inserted into the glucose meter, control material can be measured by following the
instructions for “Control Test” provided in the user manual for the meter.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study - A study was performed to evaluate the blood hematocrit (HCT) effect
on the performance of the Medisign MM1000 Blood Glucose Monitoring System across
the measuring range of the assay. Whole blood samples were tested in replicates of 12
with the Medisign system using one lot of strips and six meters. Glucose concentrations
at each HCT level (30%, 42%, and 55%) were compared to results obtained with the
YSI-2300 reference method. Data from samples at 30% and 55% were also compared to
results from samples at 42%. The data met acceptance criteria for the claimed HCT
range. The sponsor included the following limitation in the labeling: “Hematocrit is the
percentage of red blood cells in the blood. HCT levels of 30-55% were shown not to
affect glucose measurements with this device. If you do not know your hematocrit level,
consult with your health care professional.”
2. Altitude Study - The effect of altitude was evaluated inside a chamber to simulate sea
level and a high altitude condition of 11,480 feet. Three lots of the Medisign test strips
were tested on three meters, ten strips per meter, with 42% HCT whole blood at five
different glucose concentrations ranging from 126 to 511 mg/dL. Simulation chamber
test results were compared to the YSI reference values. Average assay bias was less than
± 5%. The sponsor included a limitation in the labeling indicating that the test strip may
be used at altitudes up to 10,000 feet.
3. Temperature and Humidity Studies - A study was performed to evaluate the effect of
temperature and humidity on the performance of the Medisign (MM1000) Blood Glucose
Monitoring System at three glucose levels (74, 120, and 302 mg/dL) using whole blood
samples. Samples were tested at each glucose level with the Medisign system using one
lot of strips and three meters. Glucose concentrations at each humidity level (10%, 40%,
and 90% RH) and temperature combination (10°C, 23°C, and 40°C) were compared with
results obtained with the YSI-2300 reference method. The study results support the
manufacturer’s claims of operating conditions within 10-90% RH and 10-40°C.
4. Sample Volume Study - A sample volume study using fresh whole blood samples at 61,
122, 257, 409, and 518 mg/dL glucose was performed by testing one lot of Medisign
glucose test strips in replicates of 5 on one Medisign glucose meter at different sample
volumes (0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 uL). Protocols and acceptance criteria were provided
and found to be acceptable. The sponsor concluded that sample volume of ≥0.5 uL
produced accurate results and samples <0.4 uL give an error code.
5. Readability Study - Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the results
14

--- Page 15 ---
showed that the labeling (user manual for single-patient use, test strip package inserts,
and control solution package insert) were written at the 8th grade level.
6. Usability Study - A usability study was performed to assess the ease of use of the labeling
by recruiting 156 lay users (ages18 to >51) who were provided with the test kit
containing labeling for the US market. Participants varied in age and education, and were
about evenly divided between men and women. These lay users also completed a
questionnaire to respond whether the device is easy to use and the instructions for use
were written in a way that makes it easy to use. The majority of the users responded the
device was easy to use and the instructions were easy to understand.
7. Customer service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Toll free phone number is
1-888-885-6677 for customer support.
8. EMC Testing - EMC testing was evaluated and certified by One Tech Corp and a
certificate test was issued to Tianjin Empecs on December 28, 2010.
9. Cleaning and Disinfection Studies - The device is intended for single- (Medisign
MM1000, MM1100, and MM1200) and multiple- (Medisign MM1000 Multi, MM1100
Multi, and MM1200 ) patient use. Caviwipes disinfecting Towelettes with EPA
registration #46781-8 were validated by an outside commercial testing laboratory
demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus using materials from the meter. The
sponsor also demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the external
materials of the meter after 11,000 cleaning and disinfection cycles designed to simulate
3 years of device use. Each robustness cycle tested consisted of one pre-clean wipe and
one disinfecting wipe. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated
cleaning and disinfection procedures.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
