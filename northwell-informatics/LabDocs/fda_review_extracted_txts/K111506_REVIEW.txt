I. Device Description:
Elecsys PreciControl Varia 3 is a lyophilized product consisting of analytes spiked
into human serum matrix at desired concentration levels. Specifically, the kit is
comprised of control material for β-CrossLaps, Ferritin, Folate, Osteocalcin,
Parathyroid Hormone and Vitamin B . All products derived from human blood are
12
prepared exclusively from the blood of donors tested individually and shown to be
free from HBsAg and antibodies to HCV and HIV. The testing methods applied were
FDA-approved or cleared in compliance with the European Directive 98/79/EC,
Annex II, List A.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:
ElecsysPreciControl Varia 3 is a multi-analyte control that combines the analytes in

Traceability and Value Assignment:
Elecsys PreciControl Varia 3 assigned values are determined with respective
Elecsys assays on the cobas e 601 and Elecsys 2010 analyzers. For each assay,
a master calibrator set is available, which is traceable to external or internal
reference material. The assigned values for ElecsysPreciControl Varia 3 are
read from the master calibration curve. The traceability of the external or
internal material used is described in the table below.

Value assignment for Elecsys PreciControl Varia on the cobas e 601 analyzer
or Elecsys 2010 analyzer was performed in the following manner. The
assigned value of each control level was determined by the median value
obtained from eight determinations (duplicate runs on four cobas e 601
analyzers or four Elecsys 2010 analyzers). The ranges are determined based
upon a specified ± percentage of the assigned value for each analyte.
Stability:
Stability testing protocols (carried out on the cobas e 601 analyzer) and
acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. Elecsys
PreciControl Varia 3 is stable for 15 months when stored unopened at 2 – 8°
C. Reconstituted Elecsys PreciControl Varia 3 vials are stable for 5 hours on
the analyzers at 20 - 25°C, 72 hours at 2 – 8°C, and 31 days at -20°C.
