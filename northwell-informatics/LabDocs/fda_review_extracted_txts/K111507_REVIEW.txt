The CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is intended
for use in rRT-PCR assays on an Applied Biosystems (ABI) 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time
PCR instrument in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological information:
• For qualitative detection of influenza virus type A or B from viral RNA in upper
respiratory tract clinical specimens (including nasopharyngeal swabs [NPS], nasal
swabs [NS], throat swabs [TS], nasal aspirates [NA], nasal washes [NW] and dual
nasopharyngeal/throat swabs [NPS/TS]) and lower respiratory tract specimens
(including bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL], bronchial wash [BW], tracheal aspirate
[TA], sputum, and lung tissue) from human patients with signs and symptoms of
respiratory infection and/or from viral culture.
• For determination of the subtype of seasonal human influenza A virus as seasonal
A/H1, A/H3, and/or A/H1pdm09 from viral RNA in upper respiratory tract
clinical specimens (including NPS, NS, TS, NA, NW and NPS/TS) and lower
respiratory tract specimens (including BAL, BW, TA, sputum, and lung tissue)
from human patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection and/or
from viral culture.
• For the presumptive identification of virus in patients who may be infected with
influenza A subtype A/H5 (Asian Lineage) from viral RNA in human respiratory
specimens and viral culture in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk
factors.
• To provide epidemiologic information for surveillance of circulating influenza
viruses.
Performance characteristics for influenza were established during a season when
influenza viruses A/H1 and A/H3 were the predominant influenza A viruses in
circulation and during a season when the A/H1pdm09 influenza virus was the
predominant influenza A virus in circulation. Performance characteristics may vary
with other emerging influenza A viruses.
Testing with the influenza H5a and H5b primer and probe sets should not be
performed unless the patient meets the most current U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services (DHHS) clinical and epidemiologic criteria for testing suspect A/H5
specimens. The definitive identification of influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) either
directly from patient specimens or from virus cultures requires additional laboratory
testing, along with clinical and epidemiological assessment in consultation with
national influenza surveillance experts.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as
the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely,
positive results do not rule-out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses.
The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities,
specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for
2

--- Page 3 ---
novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for
testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility
is available to receive and culture specimens.
All users, analysts, and any person reporting results from use of this device should be trained to
perform and interpret the results from this procedure by a competent instructor prior to use. CDC
Influenza Division will limit the distribution of this device to only those users who have
successfully completed a training course provided by CDC instructors or designees.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Applied Biosystems ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument with
Sequence Detection Software version 1.4.
I. Device Description:
The CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is used in
rRT-PCR assays on the ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument. It consists of
oligonucleotide primers, dual-labeled hydrolysis (TaqMan®) probes, and positive
controls for the in vitro qualitative detection and characterization of the human
influenza virus RNA in respiratory tract specimens from human patients presenting
with signs and symptoms of respiratory infections. These reagents are used for
detection of influenza A and B virus and characterization of influenza A viruses as
seasonal A/H1, A/H3, A/H1pdm09, or A/H5 (Asian lineage).
Primers and probes for Influenza A, 2009 Influenza A (swine origin), and B viruses
were selected from highly conserved regions of specific gene targets within the
matrix protein (M), nucleoprotein (NP), and non-structural protein (NS), respectively.
Primers and probes for detection and differentiation of seasonal influenza A/H1,
A/H3, A/H1pdm09, and A/H5 viruses are targeted for conserved regions of their
respective hemagglutinin (HA) genes. Sizes of targeted regions are between 100–200
nucleotides. Influenza-specific primers were designed to be 19–25 nucleotides long
with annealing temperatures of approximately 62–66°C (GC content of 45–60%) and
the terminal 3’ nucleotide located at the first or second residue of a predicted amino
acid codon.
Device Components (Provided)
The CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel includes the
3

--- Page 4 ---
following:
Lyophilized primer and probe sets
• InfA detects all influenza A viruses, but does not detect influenza B viruses
• InfB detects all influenza B viruses, but does not detect influenza A viruses
• H1 specifically detects influenza A, seasonal H1 subtype
• H3 specifically detects influenza A, seasonal H3 subtype
• H5a and H5b specifically detects influenza A, H5 Eurasian subtype
• pdm InfA detects classical swine influenza viruses, triple reassortant swine
influenza viruses, and A/H1pdm09 influenza virus
• pdm H1 specifically detects the A/H1pdm09 influenza virus
• RNase P (RP) detects human RNase P and is used with human clinical specimens
to indicate that adequate isolation of nucleic acid resulted from the extraction of
the clinical specimen.
Positive Controls
• Pooled Influenza Positive Control (PIPC)
For use as a positive control with the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time
RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel procedure to ensure the detection of seasonal influenza
virus A/H1, A/H3, A/H1pdm09 and influenza B. The PIPC contains noninfectious
positive control materials supplied as a liquid 500µl per vial, suspended in 0.01
,
M phosphate buffer saline (PBS) at pH 7.2–7.4. PIPC consists of four different
beta-propiolactone inactivated influenza viruses (influenza A/H1, A/H3,
A/H1pdm09, and influenza B) suspended in cultured human cells (A549). PIPC
will yield a positive result with the following primer and probe sets: InfA, InfB,
H1, H3, pdm InfA, pdm H1, and RP.
• Influenza Virus A/H5N1 Positive Control (H5VC)
For use as a positive control with the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time
RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel procedure to ensure proper detection of Influenza
A/H5 virus (Asian lineage). Noninfectious (beta-propiolactone inactivated)
positive control material supplied as a liquid, 500 µl per vial, suspended in 0.01 M
PBS at pH 7.2–7.4. The H5VC control consists of a reassortant human vaccine
candidate virus (A/Vietnam/1203/04 x PR/8/34) that was generated by reverse
genetics and cultured human cells (A549). The H5VC will yield a positive result
with the following primer and probe sets: InfA, H5a, H5b, and RP.
• Human Specimen Control (HSC)
For use as a RNA extraction procedural control with the CDC Human Influenza
Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel to demonstrate successful recovery of
RNA, as well as extraction reagent integrity. Purified RNA from the HSC
material should yield a positive result with the RP primer and probe set and
negative results with all influenza specific markers. The HSC consists of
noninfectious (beta-propiolactone inactivated) cultured human cell material
(A549) supplied as a liquid suspended in 0.01 M PBS at pH 7.2–7.4.

highly conserved regions of the matrix (M), nucleoprotein (NP), and non-structural
(NS) genes, respectively. Oligonucleotide primers and probes for characterization and
differentiation of seasonal influenza A/H1, A/H3, A/H1pdm09, and A/H5 viruses
were selected from highly conserved regions of their respective hemagglutinin (HA)
genes.

Interpretation of Results
Extraction and Positive Control Results and Interpretation
No Template Control (NTC)
The NTC consists of using nuclease-free water in the rRT-PCR reactions instead of
RNA. The NTC reactions for all primer and probe sets should not exhibit
fluorescence growth curves that cross the threshold line. If any of the NTC reactions
exhibit a growth curve that crosses the cycle threshold, sample contamination may
have occurred. Invalidate the run and repeat the assay with strict adherence to the
guidelines.
Pooled Influenza Positive Control (PIPC)
The PIPC consists of four different influenza viruses representing influenza A/H1N1,
A/H3N2, A/H1pdm09, and influenza B viruses suspended in cultured human cells
(A549). Purified RNA from the PIPC will yield a positive result with the following
primer and probe sets: InfA, InfB, H1, H3, pdmInfA, pdmH1, and RP.
H5 Virus Control (H5VC)
The H5VC control consists of a reassortant human vaccine candidate virus
(A/Vietnam/1203/04 x PR/8/34) that was generated by reverse genetics and cultured
human cell (A549) material. Purified RNA from the H5VC will yield a positive result
with the following primer and probe sets: InfA, H5a, H5b, and RP.
Human Specimen Control (HSC) (Extraction Control)
The HSC control consists of noninfectious cultured human cell (A549) material. The
HSC is used as a RNA extraction procedural control to demonstrate successful
recovery of RNA as well as extraction reagent integrity. Purified RNA from the HSC
should yield a positive result with the RP primer and probe set and negative results
with all influenza specific markers.
Specimen Results and Interpretation
RNase P (Extraction Control)
(cid:190) All clinical samples should exhibit fluorescence growth curves in the RNase P
reaction that cross the threshold line within 38.00 cycles (< 38.00 Ct), thus
indicating the presence of the human RNase P gene. Failure to detect RNase P in
any clinical specimens may indicate:
• Improper extraction of nucleic acid from clinical materials resulting in loss of
RNA and/or RNA degradation
• Absence of sufficient human cellular material due to poor collection or loss of
specimen integrity
• Improper assay set up and execution
• Reagent or equipment malfunction
(cid:190) If the RP assay does not produce a positive result for human clinical specimens,
interpret as follows:
• If the InfB or InfA along with H1, H3, pdm InfA, or pdm H1 are positive even
in the absence of a positive RP, the influenza result should be considered
valid. It is possible, that some samples may fail to exhibit RNase P growth
11

--- Page 12 ---
curves due to low cell numbers in the original clinical sample. A negative RP
signal does not preclude the presence of influenza virus RNA in a clinical
specimen.
• If all influenza markers AND RNase P are negative for the specimen, the
result should be considered inconclusive for the specimen. If residual
specimen is available, repeat the extraction procedure and repeat the test. If all
markers remain negative after re-test, report the results as inconclusive and a
new specimen should be collected if possible.
(cid:190) The RP assay may be negative when testing virus culture samples.
Influenza Markers (InfA, InfB, H1, H3, pdmInfA, pdmH1, H5a, and H5b)
(cid:190) When all controls exhibit the expected performance, a specimen is considered
negative if all influenza marker (InfA, InfB, H1, H3, pdmInfA, pdmH1, H5a, and
H5b) cycle threshold growth curves DO NOT cross the threshold line within
38.00 cycles (< 38.00 Ct) AND the RNase P growth curve DOES cross the
threshold line within 38.00 cycles (< 38.00 Ct).
(cid:190) When all controls exhibit the expected performance, a specimen is considered
positive for influenza if the influenza marker (InfA, InfB, H1, H3, pdmInfA and
pdmH1) cycle threshold growth curve crosses the threshold line within 38.00
cycles (< 38.00 Ct). The RNase P may or may not be positive as described above,
but the influenza result is still valid. When testing tissue culture derived samples,
the Rnase P result is likely to yield negative / not detected result due to the
absence of the human RNase P target.
(cid:190) When all controls exhibit the expected performance and the growth curves for the
influenza markers (InfA, InfB, H1, H3, pdmInfA, pdmH1, H5a, and H5b) AND
the RNase P marker DO NOT cross the cycle threshold growth curve within
38.00 cycles (< 38.00 Ct), the result is inconclusive. The extracted RNA from the
specimen should be re-tested. If residual RNA is not available, re-extract RNA
from residual specimen and re-test. If the re-tested sample is negative for all
markers and all controls exhibit the expected performance, the result is
“Inconclusive.”
(cid:190) When all controls exhibit the expected performance and the cycle threshold
growth curve for influenza A (InfA) marker ONLY crosses the threshold line
within 38.00 cycles (< 38.00 Ct) without any subtype markers indicating detection
(InfA positive without H1, H3, pdmInfA, pdmH1 subtypes detected), the sample
has potential for containing a novel and/or newly emerging influenza A virus. The
extracted RNA from the specimen should be re-tested IMMEDIATELY. If the
fresh unfrozen residual RNA is not available, re-extract RNA from the residual
specimen and re-test. If the re-tested sample is again positive for InfA only and all
controls exhibit the expected performance, the state public health laboratory
director, or designee, should contact the CDC Influenza Division
IMMEDIATELY at flusupport@cdc.gov to coordinate the transfer of the
specimen to CDC as quickly as possible for confirmatory testing. NOTE: Do not
test this sample using the Influenza A/H5 Subtyping Assay unless the patient
meets the current WHO epidemiological risk factors.
12

--- Page 13 ---
(cid:190) When all controls exhibit expected performance and growth curves for InfA, H5a
AND H5b markers cross the threshold line within 38.00 cycles (< 38.00 Ct):
• Report the specimen to be “Presumptive Positive for Influenza A/H5
Virus” and contact the CDC Influenza Division immediately to coordinate
transfer of the specimen to CDC for additional testing.
(cid:190) When all controls exhibit the expected performance and growth curves for InfA
and EITHER H5a OR H5b markers cross the threshold line within 38.00 cycles (<
38.00 Ct), extracted RNA from the specimen should be re-tested immediately. If
residual RNA is not available, re-extract RNA from residual specimen and re-test.
If all controls exhibit the expected performance on the repeated test and either
H5a OR H5b reactions cross the threshold line within 38.00 cycles (< 38.00 Ct):
• Report the specimen to be “Inconclusive for Influenza A/H5 virus” and
contact the CDC Influenza Division immediately to coordinate transfer of
the specimen to CDC for additional testing.

Standards-Based Electronic Laboratory Reporting for Influenza
Background
This section contains the recommendations for uniform coding and vocabulary for CDC
Human Influenza Virus Real-time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel. The following information
is provided to assist the performing laboratory in complying with new federal guidelines
for the meaningful use of electronic health information systems. The implementation of
adopted standards should be harmonized across all performing laboratories to ensure
semantic interoperability to better support electronic data exchange.
The CDC developer of this assay through collaboration has established Standard English
terminology for the test name and test results with the testing community and expert
knowledge of the processes involved. It is recognized that this terminology will differ in
countries outside the United States. However, through the use of national and
international agreements, it is possible to establish a universal set of codes and terms to
accurately characterize laboratory observations. Recommendations in this package insert
apply to the reporting of results of this assay only within the United States.
Process for achieving uniformity in laboratory test results
The laboratory performing the influenza assay may utilize a Laboratory Information
Management Systems (LIMS) with connections to a hospital or medical system
Electronic Health Record (EHR). The coding systems include LOINC - Logical
Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC® -- http://www.loinc.org) and
SNOMED CT – Systematic Nomenclature of Medicine--Clinical Terms
(http://www.ihtsdo.org/). These coding systems have specific capabilities that are
essential for achieving uniformity. The test request and results are to be incorporated into
a standard Health Level 7 (HL7) electronic format for laboratory test messaging. More
information about HL7 can be found at http://www.hl7.org.
LOINC provides for a common understanding of the medical procedure or process
related to the specific assay, in this case the process of detecting the presence of influenza
virus and the potential sub-typing of the detected influenza virus. The LOINC codes
specified here describe the important information about the methodology employed by
the assay; recovery and amplification of one or more RNA targets. Multiple LOINC
codes are utilized to convey that the assay is composed of multiple components, i.e. it is a
panel or a battery of subtests. In the case of the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time
RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel, the LOINC also provides for conveying that an interpretive
test summary is appropriate.
SNOMED CT codes provide for unambiguous representation of the test results and allow
the application of specific concepts such as “detected” or “positive” or the identification

of detected organism names. Though not further defined in this document, SNOMED CT
can also be used to provide for description of the type and source/ location of the
specimen being tested or for conveying information about failures of the test procedure or
the lack of adequate specimen.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Please refer to previously FDA-cleared, 510(k) Premarket Notifications, K080570
and K101564
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There are no changes to the internal positive control, the human RNase P; Human
Specimen Control (HSC); Influenza virus A/H5N1 Positive Control (H5VC) and
No Template Control (NTC) for the New Assay. Please refer to previously FDA-
cleared 510(k) Premarket Notifications, K080570 and K101564 for further
information.
A new positive control has been added in the new device, Pooled Influenza
Positive Control (PIPC). It contains noninfectious positive control materials
supplied as a liquid 500µl per vial, suspended in 0.01 M phosphate buffer saline
,
(PBS) at pH 7.2–7.4. PIPC consists of four different beta-propiolactone
inactivated influenza viruses (influenza A/H1, A/H3, A/H1pdm09, and influenza
B) suspended in cultured human cells (A549). PIPC will yield a positive result
with the following primer and probe sets: InfA, InfB, H1, H3, pdm InfA, pdm H1,
and RP.
An internal validation study was performed to confirm that it is acceptable to add
A/H1N1pdm09 virus to the existing Seasonal Influenza Virus Control (SIVC) to
create a new single control material for use with the CDC rRT-PCR Flu Panels. A
solution containing a 1:1 mixture of pdmPC (pdm positive control) and SIVC was
assembled and tested in triplicate against InfA, InfB, H1, H3, RP, pdm InfA, and
pdm H1 markers using procedures described in the CDC rRT-PCR Flu Panel

In brief, the performance characteristics below are aggregated and combined from
the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Detection (K080570) and
Characterization Panel and the CDC Influenza 2009 A (H1N1)pdm Real-Time
RT-PCR Panel (K101564). The clinical performance data for 2007-2008 season
was a part of CDC EUA submission.
2006 – 2007 Study
Performance characteristics of the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-
PCR Detection and Characterization Panel were established during a prospective
study at 4 U.S. state public health laboratories during the 2006-2007 respiratory
virus season (February-April). Samples used for this study were nasal and
nasopharyngeal swabs collected for routine influenza testing at each site.
The reference method was rapid culture (shell vial) followed by direct fluorescent
antibody screening and identification. Specimens tested at the public health
testing sites followed routine diagnostic influenza rapid culture protocols and the
rRT-PCR Flu Panel protocol to demonstrate performance.
A total of 415 specimens were collected and tested at the four public health
laboratory testing sites during the 2006-2007 influenza season for this prospective
clinical study. A total of 439 specimen results (415 prospective seasonal and 24
retrospective AH5 influenza samples) from nasal, nasopharyngeal swabs, or
grown culture in the case of influenza AH5 samples were tested using gold
standard virus culture. Influenza AH5 and discrepant prospective seasonal
influenza samples were further analyzed by bi-directional sequencing. Please refer
to 510(k) Premarket Notification K080570 for additional information.
2007 – 2008 Study
Performance characteristics of the rRT-PCR Flu Panel were demonstrated during
a prospective study at four U.S. state public health laboratories during the 2007-
19

--- Page 20 ---
2008 respiratory virus season (February-April). Specimens tested in this study
included nasal swabs, nasopharyngeal swabs, dual nasopharyngeal / throat swabs,
nasal aspirates and throat swabs collected for routine influenza testing from
patients presenting with ILI at each site.
The reference method was rapid culture (shell vial) followed by direct fluorescent
antibody screening and identification. Specimens tested at the public health
testing sites followed routine diagnostic influenza rapid culture protocols and the
rRT-PCR Flu Panel protocol to demonstrate performance and agreement.
A total of 323 dual nasopharyngeal / throat swabs, nasal aspirates, isolates, and
throat swabs specimens were collected and tested. A total of 313 results were
valid according to the instructions for interpretation within the IVD package
insert.

2009 – 2010 Study
Performance characteristics of the CDC rRT-PCR 2009 A(H1N1)pdm Flu Panel
were established during a prospective study at eight U.S. public health
laboratories and a Department of Defense (DoD) laboratory during the 2009-2010
respiratory virus season (February-April). A total of 1901 patient specimens
collected for routine influenza testing were evaluated at the nine clinical sites:
1191 nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and nasal swabs (NS), 50 throat swabs (TS),
519 nasal washes (NW) and nasal aspirates (NA), 99 dual nasopharyngeal swabs /
throat swabs (NPS/TS), and 42 lower respiratory specimens. Due to low
prevalence of influenza, retrospective specimens were used to supplement
prospectively collected specimens.
The reference methods utilized in this study were virus culture followed by
Immunofluorescent Antibody (IFA) or Direct Fluorescent Antibody (DFA) for
identification of influenza type and bi-directional sequencing for confirmation of
2009 influenza A (H1N1) subtype. InfA analyte results from the CDC rRT-PCR
2009 A(H1N1)pdm Flu Panel were compared to viral culture results in the
analysis. Sequencing was performed only with specimens that were first identified
as positive for influenza A by virus culture. Pdm InfA and pdm H1 analyte results
from the CDC rRT-PCR 2009 A(H1N1)pdm Flu Panel were compared to bi-
directional sequencing results in the analysis. Please refer to 510(k) Premarket
Notification K101564 for additional information.
4. Clinical cut-off: N/A
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected values are derived from the clinical studies performed during the
2006-2007 (K080570), 2009-2010 (K101564).
From August 30, 2009, through March 27, 2010, World Health Organization
(WHO) and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System
(NREVSS) collaborating laboratories in the United States tested 422,648
specimens. Of these, 89,585 (21.1%) were positive: 89,298 (99.7%) were positive
for influenza A and 287 (0.3%) were positive for influenza B. Among 66,978
influenza A viruses for which subtyping was performed, almost all (66,589
[99.4%]) were 2009 HIN1 viruses.

During October 1, 2006--May 19, 2007, World Health Organization and National
Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) collaborating
laboratories in the United States tested 179,268 respiratory specimens for
influenza viruses; 23,753 (13.2%) were positive. Of these, 18,817 (79.2%) were
influenza A viruses and 4,936 (20.8%) were influenza B viruses. Among the
influenza A viruses, 6,280 (33.4%) were subtyped; 3,912 (62.3%) were influenza
A/H1 viruses and 2,368 (37.7%) were influenza A/H3 viruses
(http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtmlml/mm5631a2.htm). In the rRT-
PCR Flu Panel multi-center prospective clinical study during the 2006-2007
influenza season, the prevalence as determined by virus culture was as follows:
influenza A/H1 (7.0%), influenza A/H3 (23.6%), and influenza B (9.9%).
