2. Indication(s) for use:
The NMR LipoProfile® test, when used with the NMR Profiler, an automated
NMR spectrometer, measures lipoprotein particles to quantify LDL particle
number (LDL-P), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides in human serum
and plasma using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. LDL-P and
these NMR-derived concentrations of HDL-C and triglycerides are used in
conjunction with other lipid measurements and clinical evaluation to aid in the
management of lipoprotein disorders associated with cardiovascular disease. This
test is performed and provided as a service by LipoScience Laboratory.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
This device is cleared as a service (in-house). Samples are sent to Liposcience
Laboratories to be run on the NMR Profiler, using software version Gen2.1.

L. Test Principle:
The NMR LipoProfile® test and NMR Profiler involves measurement of the 400
MHz proton NMR spectrum of a plasma/serum sample, deconvolution of the
composite signal at approximately 0.8 ppm to produce signal amplitudes of the
lipoprotein subclasses that contribute to the composite plasma/serum signal, and
conversion of these subclass signal amplitudes to lipoprotein subclass concentrations.
The ~0.8 ppm plasma NMR signal arises from the methyl group protons of the lipids

carried in the LDL, HDL and VLDL subclasses of varying diameters. The NMR
signals from the various lipoprotein subclasses have unique and distinctive
frequencies and line shapes, each of which is accounted for in the deconvolution
analysis model. Each subclass signal amplitude is proportional to the number of
subclass particles emitting the signal, which enables subclass particle concentrations
to be calculated from the subclass signal amplitudes derived from the spectral
deconvolution analysis. LDL subclass particle concentrations, in units of nanomoles
of particles per liter (nmol/L), are summed to give the reported total LDL particle
concentration (LDL-P). By employing conversion factors assuming that the various
lipoprotein subclass particles have cholesterol and triglyceride contents characteristic
of normolipidemic individuals, HDL cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations are
also derived.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run and within-laboratory precision were evaluated in accordance with
the methods defined in the CLSI Guideline EP5-A, “Evaluation of Precision
Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices.”
Three serum pools with different analyte concentrations were prepared and
tested in multiple runs over multiple days. For the Within-Lab, multiple
instruments, operators and reagent lots were incorporated into the testing and
a variance component analysis was conducted to estimate the individual
sources of the total system variability.
Within-run precision - A single run of 20 replicates for the low and the
medium pool was conducted on one instrument and a single run of 20
replicates for the high pool was conducted on a second NMR instrument. A
single operator conducted all three runs.

Triglycerides: 5 - 1100 mg/dL
LDL-P:
The dilution series consisted of eleven samples that were prepared by
combining selected de-identified, residual specimens from LipoScience’s
commercial laboratory. The samples covered the range from 184 nmol/L to
3868 nmol/L. All the pools were run on the same day in 4 replicates. The
study was conducted in a single run on one instrument. Significance of the
terms for both the linear and polynomial regression was examined.

In the polynomial regression, the X2 term was significant (p=0.0027). Given
the significance of the nonlinear term, acceptance criteria for allowable
nonlinearity were evaluated. Samples 5-11 met the sponsor’s pre-determined
allowable nonlinearity criteria (10%). The low concentration samples 2-3,
compared to the absolute nonlinearity criteria of 52.1 nmol/L, meet the
sponsor’s allowable nonlinearity criteria. Therefore the linearity observed for
LDL-P in this study supports the claimed measuring range of 300 to 3500
nmol/L.
HDL-C and triglycerides: Twelve concentration levels were prepared across
the range of the assays by serial dilutions of the source pools and tested. The
study was conducted in a single run on one instrument and each level was
tested in replicates of four. For HDL-C, the samples covered the range of 6.3
– 205 mg/dL; for triglycerides the samples covered the range 5.4 – 1880
mg/dL. Linear regression analysis yielded the following results:
HDL-C:
R2 = 0.9998
y = 1.004x - 0.5956
Triglycerides:
R2 = 0.9998

d. Detection limit:
The lower ends of the measuring ranges for LDL-P, HDL-C and triglycerides
were determined by linearity, above in 2b, and unchanged from the predicate
(k063841):
LDL-P: 300 mmol/L
HDL-C: 7 mg/dL
Triglycerides: 5 mg/dL
e. Analytical specificity:
A new interference study was performed to evaluate whether substances could
be potential interferents of the device and its modified software. In addition,
two new therapeutics for the intended use population became available and
were also evaluated in the new study.
In order to evaluate potential interferents with the new version of the LDL-P
software Gen2.1, LipoScience employed the following study design: first,
identify potentially interfering substances that show resonance(s) in the
vicinity of lipoprotein resonances. Each potential interferent was diluted in
the appropriate solvent and analyzed on the NMR Profiler to determine if it
demonstrated peak(s) in the 0.7 – 1.0 ppm region. Five endogenous
substances and 22 drugs were screened in this step using concentrations in
accordance to CLSI EP7-A2.
Second, once a potentially interfering substance was identified, a spiking
study was completed where the substance was added to sample pools
containing two different levels of LDL-P, HDL-C and triglycerides for a
paired difference test.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
LDL-P: The comparison was conducted in agreement with CLSI EP9-A2:
Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples. The study
involved testing singlicates followed by statistical analysis of 1600 freshly-
collected clinical de-identified specimens across the range of the LDL-P test.
Bias was calculated for LDL-P from the linear regression line at the medical
decision limits of 1000, 1300 and 1600 nmol/L as well. 1555 samples are
included in the final analysis (44 samples were outside of the claimed
10

measuring range; one sample failed QC check due to an instrument shim error
and could not be repeated due to insufficient sample volume). The range of
the samples was 315 to 3497 nmol/L.
Linear regression/least squares analysis:
r = 0.970
Slope = 0.98 95% CI: 0.97 – 0.99
Intercept = 46.42 95% CI: 22.44 – 70.40
Deming Regression analysis:
Slope = 1.01 95% CI: 1.00 - 1.03
Intercept = -7.97 95% CI: -31.45 – 15.50
In addition to conducting a method comparison for the overall data set, the
data were classified into the three following segments based on LDL-P values;
(1) results below the medical decision limits of 1000 nmol/L, (2) results
between 1000 and 1600 nmol/L and (3) results above 1600 nmol/L. For each
segment the bias was determined. The determined % Bias for each segment
was less than the acceptable allowable bias (< 5% for each level).

b. Matrix comparison:
The various specimen tubes recommended by the manufacturer for use with
this assay are serum drawn in gel barrier NMR LipoTubes (Greiner, Inc. Part
#456293), or red-top plain serum collection tubes; or plasma drawn into
EDTA or heparin collection tubes. A study was conducted to validate the
equivalence of NMR LipoProfile results using these serum and plasma
specimens. Blood was collected in the specified collection tubes and
immediately tested. The study comparing samples collected in serum tubes
(NMR LipoTube, reference) to plain serum (red-top), EDTA plasma (purple
top) or Na Heparin plasma (green top) tubes tested individual specimens from
30 volunteers. Samples tested spanned most of the assay range. Average
biases observed ranged between 2.6 to 6.1% for LDL-P. No concentration-
dependent trends were observed.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor used procedures in CLSI Guideline C28-A2 to bridge the
transference of a reference range established with the predicate method in
k063841 to the proposed device. For the predicate devices, in order to determine
the distribution of LDL-P levels expected in a representative sampling of the
general population, plasma samples (n=5,362) were analyzed from apparently
healthy men and women (mean age 61, ranging from 44 to 84 years) enrolled in
the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a large epidemiologic study
sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Results were
presented as percentiles.
In the sponsor’s bridging study, the plasma samples from the MESA study were
re-tested. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the percentiles determined for the
predicate are also valid for the proposed device.
