C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Diatron US Inc., Abacus 3CP
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Quantitative test for WBC, LYM%, LYM#, MID%, MID#, GRA%, GRA#, RBC,
HGB, HCT, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW, PLT, and MPV parameters.
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Abacus 3 Cap Piercer (Abacus 3CP) is a fully automated, bench top
hematology cell counter. It uses the impedance-method for counting cells passing
through a small aperture, and measures the hemoglobin content of red blood cells
using a photometric method.
The analyzer features a color graphical LCD display module and a foil keypad of
29 keys including 6 software buttons (with icons), 6 function keys (above LCD)
and has a START button. The Abacus 3CP instrument requires 100 uL of
K EDTA anti-coagulated venous whole blood sample and can process 60 samples
3
per hour. The Abacus 3CP hematology analyzer is composed of a Fluidic System,
Data Processing System and a Control Panel.
2. Principles of Operation:
It uses the impedance-method for counting cells passing through a small aperture,
and measures the hemoglobin content of red blood cells using a photometric
method. The Diatron Abacus 3CP System uses electronic sizing to determine
three distinct white cell subpopulations. Cells correlating to lymphocytes are
included in the small cell subpopulation. Cells correlating to granulocytes are
included in the large cell population. The remaining cells correlating to
monocytes, basophils, eosinophils, blasts, and other precursor white cells are
included in the mid-size cell population. The MCV and RDW values are derived
from statistical analysis of the RBC histogram. The HCT, MCH, and MCHC are
calculated values. The MPV value is derived from statistical analysis of the PLT
histogram.
3. Modes of Operation:
The Abacus 3CP operates in both open and closed sample tube mode.

4. Specimen Identification:
The sample ID can be entered by the operator from a keyboard or hand held
barcode reader for a manually processed specimen. For automatically processed
specimens, the sample ID can be read from a sample tube barcode or entered into
a list for one of the automatic processing list modes.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Manually presented whole blood K EDTA sample tubes must be mixed properly
3
prior to specimen analysis. Sample tubes are placed into a tube adapter inserted on
the sample rotor for closed vial or open vial single tube manual sample
processing.
6. Calibration:
The Abacus 3CP analyzer calibration is calibrated using a commercial calibrator.
The known calibrator parameter values and measured values are used to calculate
calibration factors. Diatron recommends performing calibration at installation,
when indicated by quality control, after major maintenance or service, and at
periodic time intervals as directed by laboratory regulatory agencies.
7. Quality Control:
Diatron recommends the use of CBC-3D controls from R&D Systems to verify
performance of the Abacus 3CP. Quality control is performed at intervals
established by the laboratory or as required by laboratory accreditation, licensing,
or regulatory agencies.

from the acceptance criteria for all parameters. Therefore, the method comparison
evaluation is considered to meet its acceptance criteria and all the requirements of the
data collection and its evaluation.
Predictive Value of Abacus 3CP vs. Microscopy (Reference Method)
The ability of the Abacus 3CP to flag abnormal samples was evaluated per CLSI
H20-A2 in comparison with the reference method (Manual Microscopy). A total
of 212 samples were analyzed on the Abacus 3CP in combination with manual
differential reviews. The WBC distributional flagging statistical analysis was
performed 2 ways and the data are summarized in the tables below:
Binned manual differential analysis per CLSI H20-A2:
This approach counted the total number of monocytes, eosinophils, basophils,
immature granulocytes and blast cells represented in a reference sample and
determined whether this total value was outside of the expected reference range
for “MID” cells. If that sample was outside the reference range for “MID” cells
then it was considered in this analysis to be distributionally positive for the
reference sample.
Unbinned manual differential analysis:
This approach counted each cell type, monos, eos, basos, immature grans and
blasts, represented in a reference sample and determined whether the individual
population was outside of the expected reference range for that particular
population. If any individual cell type, monos, eos, basos, immature grans or
blasts, was outside of its individual expected reference range, then it would be
considered in this analysis to be distributionally positive for “MID” cells for the
reference sample.
Conclusions: The results of the comparison of the predictive value of the Abacus
3CP versus the manual differential demonstrated performance expected for
6

instruments of this class (3-part differential). The overall sensitivity result is
attributed to the effect of binning to a 3-part differential and was found to be
comparable to other devices reporting a 3-part differential.
b. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability
The Abacus 3CP repeatability evaluation was conducted using 23 human blood
samples and three levels of control. The samples were selectively chosen to span
the analytical measuring range and to be close to clinical decision points on two
Abacus 3CP instruments. A minimum of 15 and a maximum of 21 replicates were
run for each sample. All repeatability runs passed either their SD or CV criteria
for all parameters for both instruments according to the acceptance criteria.
The following tables represent reproducibility and precision. Two replicates of a
single lot of commercial low, normal, and high control samples were run twice
per day at three different sites for 20 working days. The data from three
instruments was analyzed to determine the overall mean and precision for
between-site, between-day, within-day, and within-device. Within-day variation
represents the variability between AM and PM runs pooled across the 20 days.

c. Linearity:
The analytical measuring range (AMR) was established according to the
protocol in CLSI EP6-A by analyzing dilutions made from manipulated whole
human blood or from commercial linearity kit material. In order to demonstrate
that each parameter is within the claimed performance, a minimum of 9
proportional dilutions spanning the reportable range were run in triplicate on
two Abacus 3CP analyzers. All of the eight linearity runs produced coefficients
of determination (r2) >0.99 for each measurand. All linearity runs met their
respective specifications.

d. Carryover:
Carryover was determined using three Abacus 3CP analyzers by running whole
blood specimens with high target values (HTV) of WBC, RBC, HGB, and PLT.
Each specimen was run in triplicate followed by three aspirations of whole blood
specimens with low target values (LTV). Carryover % was calculated by using
the following equation: % Carryover = (HTV1 − LTV3) ∕ (HTV3 − LTV3) x 100.
The maximum carryover for WBC, RBC, HGB, and PLT are 1.00%, 0.50%,
0.80%, and 1.00% respectively.
Carryover
Abacus 3CP
WBC RBC HGB PLT
Analyzer #1 0.09% -0.03% -0.31% 0.03%
Analyzer #2 0.08% -0.13% 0.34% 0.00%
Analyzer #3 0.12% 0.00% 0.11% -0.01%
The carryover measurements for WBC, RBC, HGB and PLT were less than their
respective criteria. The overall carryover evaluation is therefore considered
passing.
e. Interfering Substances:
Test samples are created by adding interfering substances to normal samples such
as bilirubin and lipids based on CLSI EP07-A2. Other evaluations were made by
finding naturally occurring human blood samples with potential interferences
such as high WBC, platelet abnormalities and NRBCs. A bias of 5% or more was
considered clinically significant in the directly measured parameters. Measurands
were not impacted by bilirubin up to 30 mg/dL. The following parameters were
affected by interference from NRBC, PLT clumps/large PLT, increased WBC,
and lipids (see table below):

f. Background Counts:
Daily start-up background counts were performed on the Abacus 3CP and were
verified by each site against the specifications. Start-up background specifications
were achieved before data collection. The Abacus 3CP background specifications
are as follows:
Background
Measurand
Concentration Limits
WBC ≤ 0.1 x 103 cells/mL
RBC ≤ 0.01 x 106 cells/mL
HGB ≤ 0.3 g/dL
PLT ≤10 x 103 cells/mL
2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
Studies were conducted to support claims and attributes for whole blood sampling
and were designed to evaluate the following:
a. Sample stability:
The parameters selected for this evaluation are the directly measured parameters
(WBC, RBC, HGB, PLT), the optically measured parameters (GRA%, LYM%,
MID%) and the derived parameters (MCV, RDW, MPV). A total of 10 normal
and six abnormal K EDTA anticoagulated human whole blood samples were
3
analyzed at 0.5 hours after venipuncture and at various time intervals thereafter.
The averages of the parameters at each time point were compared to the baseline
averages. The results support sample stability at room temperature (20 - 23°C) of
7 hours.
The acceptance criteria are found in the following table:
WBC LYM% MID% GRA% RBC HGB MCV RDW PLT MPV

Percent 6% 10% 10% 10% 6% 6% 6% 6% 8% 10%
b. Comparison of open and closed vial sampling:
A total of 50 K EDTA anticoagulated human blood samples spanning the
3
reportable range were used in the study. The specimens were run in closed vial
cap pierce mode (selected as the reference as per CLSI H26-A2) and compared to

the open vial mode and to the Autosampler automatic processing mode, on two
instruments. The absolute value of the calculated predictive bias at all range and
clinical decision points for all parameters were less than the bias goals calculated
from the absolute and percent criteria for the parameter. Therefore, the overall
mode-to-mode evaluation is considered to meet its specifications.
The predictive bias acceptance criteria are found in the following table:

c. Reference ranges:
Evaluation of reference ranges for the Abacus 3CP instrument was conducted
using a data set of 120 normal human whole blood samples collected at the US
site. Of these 120 samples, 60 were from female patients and 60 were from male
patients. The established reference ranges are represented in the table below.

The lower limit of detection (LLoD) and the lower limit of quantitation (LLoQ) of
WBC, PLT, RBC and HGB were quantified as per CLSI H26-A2 section 5.8. To
determine LLoD, 12 blank runs were collected daily over five days (total 60 blank
runs) on two instruments using alternating operators. The values of WBC, PLT,
RBC and HGB for these blank runs are analyzed to determine the LLoD. Once
