510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
k111543
B. Purpose for Submission:
New device
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., Ventana Virtuoso System for HER2 (4B5)
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Computer-assisted image analysis scoring and manual scoring of digital images of
immunohistochemistry stained HER2 slides.
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Virtuoso™ System is an instrument-plus-software system designed to assist
the qualified pathologist in the consistent assessment of protein expression in
immunohistochemically stained histologic sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded normal and neoplastic tissues.
The system consists of a slide scanner (iScan), computer, monitor, keyboard,
mouse, image analysis algorithms for specific immunohistochemical markers, and
software with a Windows web browser-based user interface. Virtuoso is a web-
based, end-to-end, digital pathology software solution that allows pathology
laboratories to acquire, manage, view, analyze, share, and report digital images of
pathology specimens. Using the Virtuoso software, the pathologist can view
digital images, add annotations, make measurements, perform image analysis, and
generate reports.
The Digital Read option allows the pathologist to score the HER2 stained slide’s
digital image on a computer monitor. In the Image Analysis Application option,
slides are scored by the HER2 image analysis application. This score is then
presented on the computer screen. The pathologist then verifies the score and
confirms it.
Hardware: The iScan slide scanning device captures digital images of formalin-
fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues that are suitable for storage and viewing. The
device includes a digital slide scanner, racks for loading glass slides, computer,
scanner software, keyboard, mouse and monitor.
Software: The Virtuoso software is designed to complement the routine workflow
of a qualified pathologist in the review of immunohistochemically stained
histologic slides. It allows the user to select fields of view (FOVs) in the digital
image for analysis and provides quantitative data on these FOVs to assist with
interpretation. The software makes no independent interpretations of the data and
requires competent human intervention for all steps in the analysis process.
2. Principles of Operation:
The Virtuoso System for HER2 4B5 employs image analysis techniques to obtain
HER2 scores. Pre-defined parameters are used to obtain HER2 scores. The
identification of the nuclei and membrane are carried out automatically by the
1

--- Page 2 ---
image analysis algorithms. The steps involved in the analysis algorithms are:
1. Enhancing the image. This process increases the contrast to make the image
more suitable for analysis.
2. Identifying the epithelial area. The epithelial area is the region of the image
where there is the possibility of epithelial cell being present.
3. Identifying the nucleus
4. Identifying the cell membrane
5. Classify the cells based on the extent, intensity and thickness of membrane
staining
6. Computer score
3. Modes of Operation:
a. Manual scoring of immunohistochemically (IHC) HER2 stained slide images
on a computer monitor (Digital read).
b. Computer scoring of IHC HER2 stained slide images performed by HER2
Image Analysis Application. This score is verified by the pathologist.
4. Specimen Identification:
Glass tissue slides are identified by slide label or barcode (if provided by the user)
by scanning the whole slide including the label or barcode.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
IHC stained slides manually loaded on to the iSCAN Coreo slide scanner
individually or in slide racks. The slide racks hold a maximum of 160 slides.
Under the default setting a thumbnail view of the slide and the area of interest
(AOI) in the slide is scanned. The operator has the option of rescanning the slide
after viewing the image on the computer monitor. Under the manual scanning
option, the user has the ability to select the scan area for single or batch slides.
6. Calibration:
The iSCAN Coreo contains a diagnostics module that can be run by the user.
This application tests the scanner hardware components and functions. These
tests must be run with nine custom slides calibrated for the module which can be
obtained from the sponsor.
7. Quality Control:
Quality control is performed by the operator before releasing the images to the
pathologist for review. Slides with sub-optimal images will be rescanned.

In the second study, scanner precision was evaluated in an isolated fashion via a
cross-over design from the primary study. A subset of the clinical cases (n = 40) was
scanned two more times with two different scanners at two separate locations. This
study evaluated scanner precision of the image analysis application only for both
inter-scanner precision and intra-scanner/inter-day precision, as the image analysis
application is the more sensitive of the two applications, and it generates an
instrument-generated HER2 score that is not affected by memory bias as would be the
case with human interpretations.
a. Accuracy:
This study was conducted in 3 sites with one pathologist at each site.
There were 120 specimens that were included in this study. All
pathologists read all the slides under the three different modes – manual,
digital read and Image analysis scoring. The data were categorized as
“negative” and “positive” using HER2 classifications of 0 and 1+ to
describe negative, and 2+ and 3+ to describe positive. The acceptance
criteria of an overall agreement rate of at least 75% were set by the
sponsor. These were met in all the studies. The overall agreements across
the three sites with the 95% confidence intervals (CI) around the
agreements are shown below.

or image analysis (IA) of all the 40 slides. There was a 7-day wash-out period
between slide reading sessions. An agreement of ≥75% between each of the
three reading sessions (Session 1 vs. Session 2, Session 1 vs. Session 3, and
Session 2 vs. Session 3) for the Virtuoso digital read (DR) application was
considered acceptable intra-pathologist/inter-day scoring performance
(maximum n = 40). The same criterion was established for the Virtuoso
image analysis application (IA) (maximum n = 40). Concordance was
analyzed based upon the clinical assessment of negative (0, 1+) and positive
(2+, 3+). Reproducibility was also evaluated for the inter-pathologist
variable, by comparing the concordance data in a pair-wise manner between
Site 1 vs. Site 2, Site 1 vs. Site 3, and Site 2 vs. Site 3. This was done for both
DR and IA, and used the same 75% acceptance criterion. The agreement rate
set by sponsor were met in all these studies.

Scanner Precision: The scanner precision study was designed to assess the
performance of the Virtuoso system’s scanner (iScan) in isolation from
other variables. The primary (clinical validation) study evaluated system
performance according to the intended use, as three different pathologists
interpreted the same stained slides in the three different modalities,
(manual method, DR, and IA). As the DR and IA images were derived
from a single scanning “run,” this second study held other variables
constant so that scanner performance could be comprehensively

addressed. This study evaluated scanner precision of the image analysis
application. The scanner precision study utilized a randomly selected
subset of 40 cases from the primary study (protocol TP-000115). The
clinical cases spanned the range of the HER2 scoring categories (0, 1+,
2+, 3+) in roughly equal numbers, and the slides were stained with both
universal DAB detection kits (iVIEW and ultraView). A subset of the
clinical cases (n = 40) was scanned two more times with two different
scanners at two separate locations. When the iScan scanner was evaluated
for inter-site and intra-site/inter-day precision, the percent agreements for
three image analysis fields of view were in excess of 90% for every
comparison thus meeting the acceptance criteria of a minimum of 75%
agreement rate that was set by the sponsor.
