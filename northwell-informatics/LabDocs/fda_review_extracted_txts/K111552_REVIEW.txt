I. Device Description:
The Elecsys T3 CalCheck 5 is a lyophilized product consisting of L-3,3,5-Triiodothyronine
(T3) in human serum matrix. During manufacture, the analyte is spiked into the matrix at the
desired concentration levels. The sponsor declared in the labeling that all products derived
from human blood are prepared exclusively from the blood of donors tested individually and
shown to be free from HBsAg and antibodies to HCV and HIV. The testing methods applied
were FDA-approved or cleared in compliance with the European Directive 98/79/EC, Annex
II, List A.
During manufacture, the analyte is spiked into the matrix at the desired concentration levels.

Traceability
The assayed value of each CalCheck level was standardized against reference standards
by weighing T3 into an analyte-free human serum matrix. The reference standard used
was T3, BCR® certified Reference Material, from a commercial vendor. BCR is a
registered trademark of the European Commission.
Value Assignment:
For each Elecsys T3 CalCheck 5 lot manufactured, the CalChecks are assayed in
duplicate on four E170 analyzers. The assigned value of each CalCheck is defined as the
median value obtained from 8 determinations of the respective CalCheck. The assigned
range is ± 18% of assigned value, in which 10% was allotted for between-analyzer
platform tolerance, 4% for stability tolerance and 4% for precision of the assay.
Values are assigned for each lot of Elecsys T3 CalCheck 5 in combination with each
Elecsys T3 reagent lot available.
For additional analyzers (Elecsys 2010), The Elecsys T3 CalCheck 5 was run once a day
on 8 Elecsys 2010 analyzers for a total of 1 day. The assigned values obtained on Elecsys
2010 are compared to those obtained on the E170. Differences between the analyzer
platforms are within the 10% tolerance, therefore, the values assigned to the E170 (and
cobas e 601, e602) are transferred to and valid for the Elecsys 2010 (and cobas e 411).
Stability:
The stability studies for T3 CalCheck 5 were performed on Elecsys 2010. Because these
studies are not analyzer-dependent, these results, in addition to real-time stability study
results, can be applied to the MODULAR ANALYTICS E170, cobas e 411, cobas e 601
and cobas e 602. The stability protocol and the acceptance criteria have been reviewed
and found to be acceptable.
• Shelf-life stability:
The accelerated stability testing performed at 35°C supports an initial shelf-life claim
of 24 months at 2-8°C. Real-time testing at 2-8oC is on-going to support a claim of
36 months.
• Open-vial stability after reconstitution :
Real time testing was performed and the data support the package insert claim that
reconstituted Elecsys T3 CalCheck 5 is stable up to 4 hours at 20-25°C.
• On-board stability:
The T3 CalCheck 5 products are not stored on-board the analyzer, therefore no on-
board stability claims is made.
