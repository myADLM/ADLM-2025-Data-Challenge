H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indications(s) for use:
Wondfo Amphetamine Urine Test:
Wondfo Amphetamine Urine Test is an immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative
determination of d-amphetamine in human urine at a cutoff concentration of 1000 ng/mL.
The test is available in a cassette format and a strip format. It is intended for prescription
use and over the counter use.
The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical
method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. GC/MS is the
preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should
be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is
positive.
Wondfo Secobarbital Urine Test:
Wondfo Secobarbital Urine Test is an immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative
determination of secobarbital in human urine at a cutoff concentration of 300 ng/mL. The
test is available in a cassette format and a strip format. It is intended for prescription use
and over the counter use.
The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical
method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. GC/MS is the
preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should
be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is
positive.
Wondfo Oxazepam Urine Test:
Wondfo Oxazepam Urine Test is an immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative
determination of oxazepam in human urine at a cutoff concentration of 300 ng/mL. The
test is available in a cassette format and a strip format. It is intended for prescription use
and over the counter use.
The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical
method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. GC/MS is the

preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should
be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is
positive.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription and over-the counter use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
The tests are in different formats: strip, cassette.
The strip format is a urine test. It is a rapid test for the qualitative detection of the d-
amphetamine, secobarbital, and oxazepam. It is a lateral flow chromatographic
immunoassay. When the absorbent end of the test device is immersed into the urine sample,
the urine is absorbed into the device by capillary action, mixes with the antibody-dye
conjugate, and flows across the pre-coated membrane. When the amphetamine, secobarbital,
and oxazepam levels are zero or below the target cut off (the detection sensitivity of the
test), antibody-dye conjugate binds to the drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test
Region (T) of the device. This produces a colored Test line, which regardless of its intensity,
indicates a negative result.
When amphetamine, secobarbital, and oxazepam levels are at or above the target cutoff, the
free drug in the binding sample binds to the antibody-dye conjugate preventing the antibody-
dye conjugate from binding to the drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test region (T)
of the device. This prevents the development of a distinct colored band in the test region,
indicating a potentially positive result.
To serve as a procedure control, a colored line will appear at the Control Region (C), if the
test has been performed properly because of the antibody-dye conjugate binding to anti-
mouse IgG immobilized in the Control Region of the device.
The Cassette format comes as a test device for amphetamine, secobarbital, and oxazepam.
The cassette format is the same function or performance specification of strip. It is
composed of a functional strip and a plastic cover, which is a supporting container.

L. Test Principle:
Immunochromatograph assay using a lateral flow, one step system for the qualitative
detection of d-amphetamine, secobarbital and oxazepam in human urine. Each assay uses a
mouse monoclonal antibody -dye conjugate against drug with gold chloride and fixed drug-
protein conjugate and anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody in membrane.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision study was performed by taking negative urine samples and spiking these
with: 2000, 1750, 1500, 1250, 1000, 750, 500, 250 and 0 ng/ml of d-amphetamine,
corresponding to ± 25, 50, 75, and 100% of the 1000 ng/ml cut-off value; 600, 525,
450, 375, 300, 225, 150, 750 and 0 ng/ml of secobarbital, corresponding to ± 25, 50,
75, and 100% of the 300 ng/ml cut-off value ; and 600, 525, 450, 375, 300, 225, 150,
750 and 0 ng/ml of oxazepam, corresponding to ± 25, 50, 75, and 100% of the 300
ng/ml cut-off value. Two sets of operators performed the testing (group A ran the strip
format and group B ran the cassette format) and the samples were divided into 12 sets
of 25 (one set per lot per run for each format). Three lots of the strip and three lots of
the cassette formats of the Wondfo Amphetamine Urine Test, Wondfo Secobarbital
Urine Test, and Wondfo Oxazepam Urine Test were used. Each of three operators
tested 2 aliquot at each concentration for each lot per day (2 runs per day for 25 days),
resulting in a total of 50 determinations by each operator at each concentration. The
operators were blinded. A summary of the results is presented in the tables below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable, the assay is intended for qualitative use
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Control standards are not supplied with this device; however, this device has internal
process controls. A colored line appearing in the control region confirms sufficient
sample volume and adequate membrane wicking. Users are informed that the test is
invalid if a line fails to appear in the control region.
Stability
Accelerated stability and real time stability tests were performed on three batches of strip
and cassette Wondfo Amphetamine Urine Tests, Wondfo Secobarbital Urine Tests,
and Wondfo Oxazepam Urine Tests. Accelerated stability was performed at 50°C for 1
month to support a one year shelf life and for 2-4 months to support a two year shelf life;
the data supports an 18 month shelf life. Real time studies were performed by storing
three lots of strips and cassettes at 4° and 30°C. Performance tests were completed at
defined intervals and the results support a 23 month shelf life at 4°C for the Wondfo
Secobarbital Urine Test and 24 months for the Wondfo Amphetamine and Wondfo
Oxazepam Urine Tests; and 24 month shelf life at 30°C for the Wondfo Secobarbital
Urine Test and 23 months for the Wondfo Amphetamine and Wondfo Oxazepam Urine
Tests. Shipping studies were performed on three lots of each strip and cassette formats
for the Wondfo Amphetamine Urine Tests, Wondfo Secobarbital Urine Tests, and
Wondfo Oxazepam Urine Tests to simulate the coldest (12°C average temp) and
hottest (36.8°C average temp)months of the year. These studies showed that the
devices can be used for the international transport environment.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical performance of the device around the cutoff is described in Section f. (Assay

e. Analytical specificity:
Specificity and cross-reactivity was performed by using three batches of both the strip
and cassette formats of the Wondfo Amphetamine Urine Test, Wondfo Secobarbital
Urine Tests, and Wondfo Oxazepam Urine Tests. The samples were split into two
aliquots and one group of operators ran the strip format on one set of aliquots and a
separate group of operators ran the cassette format on the other set of aliquots.
Thirty drug-free urine samples were tested and all were found to be negative. Cross-
reactivity was determined by spiking the target drug, drug metabolites and the same
class compounds that may cross-react with the target drugs into drug-free urine at
three different concentrations and measuring the samples in triplicate using three
batches of strips and three batches of cassettes.

The pH of a drug-free urine pool was adjusted to pH 4, pH 5, pH 6, pH 7, pH 8 or pH
9; the urine was spiked with ± 25% of the cut-off concentration of d-amphetamine,
secobarbital, or oxazepam, individually and tested using three batches of strips and
three batches of cassettes of the Wondfo Amphetamine Urine Test, Wondfo
Secobarbital Urine Tests, and Wondfo Oxazepam Urine Tests, respectively. The
spiked, pH-adjusted urine was tested in triplicate. Altering the pH of the urine sample
did not affect the accuracy of any of the test results.
The specific gravity of a drug-free urine pool was measured by obtaining urine
samples with specific gravities of 1.000-1.035 and spiking with ± 25% of the cut-off
concentration of d-amphetamine, secobarbital, or oxazepam, individually using three
batches of strips and three batches of cassettes of the Wondfo Amphetamine Urine
Test, Wondfo Secobarbital Urine Tests, and Wondfo Oxazepam Urine Tests,
respectively. The spiked urines of different specific gravities were tested in triplicate.
The results indicate that there is stable performance of the Wondfo Amphetamine
Urine Test, Wondfo Secobarbital Urine Tests, and Wondfo Oxazepam Urine
Tests when urine has a specific gravity between 1.00-1.035.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut off was investigated by using three batches of both the strip and
cassette formats of the Wondfo Amphetamine Urine Test, Wondfo Secobarbital Urine
Tests, and Wondfo Oxazepam Urine Test to test 150 urine samples each. These
samples came from the Shezhen Drug Addiction Recovery Center (25 Drug urine
samples each for amphetamine, barbiturate, and benzodiazepine) and from drug-free
urine samples (125 samples) spiked with d-amphetamine, secobarbital, or oxazepam
(125 samples for each drug) diluted from the International Drug Standard (Sigma) to
concentrations that are plus and minus 25% and 50 % of the cutoff concentrations.
Drug concentrations were confirmed by GC/MS. Results were read by three
laboratory assistants with relevant experience. The cutoff studies were performed by
two separate groups of operators (one for the strip format and one for the cassette
format). Three operators in each group performed the readings and they were blinded
to the sample. Each result was confirmed by at least two assistants.

B. A lay-user study was performed to assess the suitability of the device for home
use. Six drug-free urine sample pools were spiked to ± 25%, ± 50%, ± 75% of the
cutoff of target drug, additionally a negative urine pool with no drug was tested.
These concentrations were confirmed by GC/MS and aliquoted into 40 individual
containers per concentration (20 aliquots per concentration for each strip format).
The testing was performed at three sites by 140 blinded consumers divided
between three sites (140 users for strip, 140 for cassette for each of the Wondfo
Amphetamine Urine Test, Wondfo Secobarbital Urine Tests, and Wondfo
Oxazepam Urine Test). The lay users were chosen from likely intended users at
the Shenzhen Drug Addiction Recovery Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of
Jinan University, and the No. 177 Hospital of the People’s Liberation Army. Each
participant received the package inset, 1 blinded sample, and either a test strip or
cassette. The lay persons test result was compared to the GC/MS result to
demonstrate accuracy by lay-users. The following are the results of the lay-user
study pooled together from all three sites for the strip format:
