controls for the Cystatin C POC Test. For in vitro Diagnostic Use Only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
For use on SMART Analyzer (k092911) only.
I. Device Description:
The Diazyme Cystatin C POC Test Kit consists of the following three components:
(1) twenty DRS cuvettes prefilled with Reagent 1 (100 mM TrisCl buffer, 0.125%
Triton), (2) twenty DRS caps prefilled with Reagent 2 (Suspension of anti-human
Cystatin C chicken polyclonal antibody coated latex particles) and (3) one
preprogrammed Radio Frequency ID (RFID) card which contains a lot specific
calibration curve.
The Diazyme Cystatin C POC Test Control Kit is sold separately and is comprised of
two levels of controls (1.0 mL each of 1.0 mg/L for level 1 and 2.5 mg/L for level 2)
which are lyophilized and need to be reconstituted prior to use. The controls are
prepared from human whole blood. Each donor unit of blood in the preparation of this
material was tested by FDA-approved methods and found negative for hepatitis B
surface antigen, anti-hepatitis C and anti-HIV 1 and 2 antibodies.
SMART Analyzer (k092911) is a compact cuvette based spectrophotometer (10
inches x 5.5 inches x 5.5 inches) machine for point-of-care testing designed to
analyze readings from single use reagent cuvette. The instrument only uses the
Diazyme Reagent System (DRS) cuvette and caps and performs assay with a
preprogrammed Radio Frequency ID (RFID) card. The lot specific RFID card
contains reagent addition time, mixing time, reading time and calibration curve for
estimating cystatin C concentration.

L. Test Principle:
Diazyme Cystatin C POC Test is based on a latex enhanced immunoturbidimetric
assay. The EDTA whole blood sample is lysed upon mixing with reagent R1.
Cystatin C in the sample binds to the specific anti-Cystatin C antibody, which is
coated on latex particles, and causes agglutination. The degree of the turbidity caused
by agglutination can be measured optically and is proportional to the amount of
Cystatin C in the sample. The SMART Analyzer calculates the Cystatin C
concentration of a patient specimen by use of a lot specific calibration curve that is
stored in a Radio Frequency Identification Card (RFID) card provided with each
Cystatin C POC Test kit.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the Diazyme Cystatin C POC Test was evaluated according
to CLSI EP5-A guideline in two different precision studies. The first precision
study was performed in-house. Six whole blood specimens (0.70, 1.00, 1.25,
2.70, 4.70 and 6.20 mg/L Cystatin C) were tested with 2 runs per day with
duplicates over 10 days. Testing was performed on three different SMART
Analyzers. The results are summarized in the following table.

of Cystatin C with saline according to CLSI EP6-A and were tested with the
Diazyme Cystatin C POC Test in triplicate on the SMART Analyzer. The
mean of the obtained Cystatin C results (obtained on SMART analyzer) were
plotted against the expected values and an appropriate line fitted by standard
linear regression resulted in the following equation.
y = 0.9643x + 0.0456; R2 = 0.9977.
The recovery ranged from -0.020 to 0.453 mg/L (or the percent recovery
ranged from -1.29 to 7.04%).
Based upon the linearity data and the LoQ study, the sponsor claims a
measuring range of 0.30 to 7.65 mg/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and Value Assignment:
Reagents: Cystatin C POC test calibration system is traceable to the higher
order IFCC International Reference Preparation for Cystatin C in the reference
material ERM® DA471/IFCC. Cystatin C POC Test utilizes a Calibration
Radio Frequency Identification Card (RFID) card that is preprogrammed with
a reagent lot specific calibration curve and is supplied in each kit. RFID cards
are programmed at the manufacturer site and are subject to the same quality
control checks as the reagents and controls.
Lot specific calibrator values generated for RFID card calibration curve
programming are traceable to reference Diazyme Cystatin C calibrator values
(k093680) and Cystatin C POC calibration curve values are assigned. The
whole blood Cystatin C values are normalized to plasma Cystatin C values.
Controls: The lyophilized (freeze-dried) Cystatin C POC Test Controls are
made from pooled human whole blood and value assigned in the following
manner. Pooled human whole bloods samples are tested with the Diazyme
Cystatin C POC Test kit to determine initial Cystatin C values. The samples
are adjusted with Cystatin C antigen to the manufacturing target values for
control level 1 and control level 2. With a reference lot of the Diazyme
Cystatin C POC Test kit and three SMART Analyzers, the reconstituted bi-
level control materials are then subjected to extensive replicate analysis to
obtain mean values and ranges.
Stability:
Reagents: Two lots of the Diazyme Cystatin C POC Test reagents were
evaluated to determine the shelf life. Reagents from each lot were filled in
SMART cartridges and kept in incubators at 37oC and 2-8oC. Two levels of
Whole Blood Cystatin C controls were tested in duplicate with the stressed
reagents. At the indicated time, the Diazyme Cystatin C POC Test kits were
removed from storage and tested with the two levels of the Cystatin C controls

--- Page 7 ---
above. Based upon the accelerated study results, the sponsor claims a shelf life
of 10 days at 37oC or 12 months when stored at 2-8oC. Real time stability
studies at 2-8oC are ongoing.
Controls: To determine the shelf life of the Cystatin C POC Test Controls,
stress model tests were performed. Representative number of vials from one
lot of the Diazyme Cystatin C controls (level 1 and level 2) was subject to
stress in an incubator at 37°C. At predetermined times, vials were removed
from storage, reconstituted and tested in duplicate with Diazyme Cystatin C
POC Test reagents stored at 2-8oC (unstressed). Based on the accelerated
study results, the sponsor claims a shelf life of 7 days at 37oC or 12 months
when stored at 2-8oC for the lyophilized Diazyme Cystatin C controls. Real
time stability studies at 2-8oC are ongoing
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank, Limit of Detection and Limit of Quantitation of Diazyme
Cystatin C POC Test were determined according to CLSI EP17-A in the
following manner.
To calculate the Limit of Blank (LoB) of the Diazyme Cystatin C SMART
Whole Blood Assay, the True Blank Sample (7.5% BSA) was tested with 20
replicates daily for three days. LoB was calculated as the mean of the 57th and
58th highest values for the true blanks. Based upon the results, the sponsor
claims a LoB = 0.045 mg/L.
To calculate the Limit of Detection (LoD) of the Diazyme Cystatin C POC
Test, five Low Samples were tested with 4 replicates daily for three days.
LoD = LoB + (1.645* SD of Low samples). Based upon the results, the
sponsor claims a LoD = 0.109 mg/L.
To calculate the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) of the Diazyme Cystatin C POC
Test, five patient whole blood samples from a commercial source were diluted
with 7.5% BSA to targeted concentrations of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0
mg/L. The diluted samples were tested with the Diazyme Cystatin C SMART
reagent on SMART analyzers in 5 runs with 4 replicates per run (20 replicates
total per sample). EP Evaluator software 8 was used to estimate the LOQ.
Based upon the results, the sponsor claims a LoQ = 0.30 mg/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed interference studies according to the CLSI EP7-A2
guideline. Whole blood samples containing approximately 0.85 mg/L and 2.55
mg/L Cystatin C were used. Five levels of each interferant were tested in
triplicate on a SMART analyzer. The level of interference was considered not
significant by the sponsor if there was no more than 10% difference between
the result in the presence of the interferant and the control result. The table
below lists the substances tested and the concentrations at which no

f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To demonstrate accuracy of the Diazyme Cystatin C POC Test, the candidate
device was tested with individual EDTA whole blood samples and the results
were compared to plasma results on the predicate device (k093680) using
CLSI EP9-A2 as a guideline.
A method comparison study was performed at Diazyme Laboratories. Fifty-
one unaltered and four altered paired human whole blood and plasma samples
were tested for comparison. The range of Cystatin C was 0.48 to 6.10 mg/L
for whole blood samples and 0.52 to 6.13 mg/L for plasma samples. The
whole blood samples were tested with the Diazyme Cystatin C POC Test on
SMART analyzer and the corresponding plasma samples were tested with the
predicate device (k093680) on Hitachi 917 analyzer.
Linear regression analysis of the results yielded the following:
y = 0.9535x + 0.0958, R² = 0.9867.
Another method comparison study was performed at three physicians’ office
laboratories by three (3) intended users. One hundred and fifteen unaltered
and six altered paired human whole blood-plasma samples were tested for
comparison. At each site forty whole blood samples were tested using
SMART analyzers. The corresponding plasma specimens were tested with the
predicate device (k093680) on Hitachi 917 analyzer at Diazyme Laboratories.

interval. The reference range was established to be 0.46 to 1.06 mg/L, which is
similar to the published range of 0.5 to 1.03 mg/L for serum/plasma samples (Ref.
Wu. Alan, H.B., Tietz: Clinical Guide to laboratory Tests: Fourth Edition,
Saunders Elsevier, St. Louis, MO; 2006; 328-329). The sponsor recommends in
the labeling that each laboratory should establish its own range of normal values
for the population it serves.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
