H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use:
MicroScan® panels are designed for use in determining quantitative and/or
qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies grown on solid media of
aerobic streptococci including S. pneumoniae.
2. Indications for use:
The MicroScan® MICroSTREP plus Panels is used to determine quantitative
and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies grown on solid
media of aerobic streptococci including S. pneumoniae. After inoculation, panels
are incubated for 20 - 24 hours at 35ºC +/- 1ºC in a non-CO incubator, and read

visually. Alternatively, the panels can be incubated in and read by the
MicroScan® WalkAway System, according to the Package insert.
This particular submission is for the addition of antimicrobial Linezolid at
concentrations 0.12 to 16µg/mL to the test panel.
The organisms which may be used for susceptibility testing in this panel are:
Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multi-drug resistant strains)
Streptococcus pyogenes
Streptococcus agalactiae
Viridans group streptococci
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
• For prescription use only
• Turbidity inoculation method only
4. Special instrument requirements:
MicroScan® WalkAway® System is the alternate read method for Linezolid
I. Device Description:
The antimicrobial susceptibility tests are miniaturizations of the broth dilution
susceptibility test that have been diluted in water and dehydrated. The antimicrobial
agent is diluted in water, buffer or minute concentrations of broth to concentrations

bridging the range of clinical interest. Panels are rehydrated with 115μl Mueller-
Hinton broth supplemented with 3% lysed horse blood (LHB), after inoculation of the
broth with a standardized suspension of the organism. After incubation in a non-CO2
incubator for 20-24 hours, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the test
organism is manually read by observing the lowest antimicrobial concentration
showing inhibition of growth. Alternatively, the panel can be incubated in and read
by the MicroScan® WalkAway System.

L. Test Principle:
The antimicrobial susceptibility tests are miniaturizations of the broth dilution
susceptibility test that have been diluted in water and dehydrated. The antimicrobial
agent is diluted in water, buffer or minute concentrations of broth to concentrations
bridging the range of clinical interest. Panels are rehydrated with 115 μl Mueller-
Hinton broth supplemented with 3% lysed horse blood (LHB), after inoculation of the
broth with a standardized suspension of the organism. After incubation in a non-CO2
incubator for 20-24 hours, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the test
organism is manually read by observing the lowest antimicrobial concentration
showing inhibition of growth. Alternatively, the panel can be incubated in and read
by the MicroScan® WalkAway System.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using 10 isolates tested at three sites on three
separate days in triplicates. The study included the turbidity inoculum method
with reading performed manually, by WalkAway instrument. Both within site
and site to site results were >95% reproducible.

microdilution using cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth with 2 - 5% lysed horse blood
inoculated with a direct colony suspension and incubated in ambient air at 35ºC for 20 to 24
hours.
Inoculum density control: A turbidity meter was used for the turbidity
inoculation method. Inoculum density was controlled by monitoring the daily
results of the MicroScan® Turbidity Meter to ensure the correct final
concentration of the organisms for both the reference and test device.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical efficacy testing was conducted at three external sites using fresh
isolates supplemented with stock isolates. The study included a total of 443
Streptococci isolates, with a no growth rate of 0.89% (4/447). There were 319
(72%) fresh and 124 (28%) stock isolates. There were 50 challenge isolates
tested at one site and compared to the reference broth dilution result mode that
was determined by previous testing of each isolate multiple times in the

recommended reference panel.
The recommended CLSI reference method was followed with the exception of
the use of Pluronic-F® in the final inoculum. A validation of the use of
Pluronic-F® in the frozen reference panels was conducted.
Efficacy testing was performed using the turbidity inoculation method and
read manually after incubation for 20- 24 hours at 35ºC +/- 1ºC in a non-CO

incubator. A comparison to the reference method was provided with the
following agreement.

EA is when there is agreement between the reference method and the new method is within plus or
minus one serial two-fold dilution of antibiotic. Category agreement (CA) is when the new method
result interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result interpretation. Evaluable EA is
when the MIC result is on scale for both the new method and the reference method and have on-
scale EA.
It was noted in the Efficacy and Challenge studies that the trending of the
S. pneumoniae read was generally one dilution lower when comparing to the
reference read. The S. pneumoniae isolates tested were close to the breakpoint of
2µg/mL and a limitation is in place.
The performance of the alternate MicroScan® WalkAway System (incubation and
read methods) was demonstrated in challenge, quality control, and reproducibility
studies with acceptable results.

The current absence of data on resistant strains precludes defining any categories
other than “Susceptible.” Strains yielding test results suggestive of a
“nonsusceptible” category should be retested, and if the result is confirmed, the
isolate should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
