Hitachi Clinical Analyzer
I. Device Description:
The Hitachi Clinical Analyzer is an automatic, bench-top, wet chemistry system
intended for use in clinical laboratories or physician office laboratories. The
instrument consists of a desktop analyzer unit, an operations screen that prompts the
user for operation input and displays data, a printer, and a unit cover. The analyzer
unit includes a single probe, an incubation rotor, carousels for sample cups and
reagent cartridges, and a multi-wavelength photometer. The single-use reagent
cartridges may be placed in any configuration on the carousel, allowing the user to
develop any test panel where the reagent cartridges are available.
The S TEST reagent cartridges are made of plastic and include two small reservoirs
capable of holding two separate reagents (R1 and R2), separated by a reaction
cell/photometric cuvette. The cartridges also include a dot code label that contains all
chemistry parameters, calibration factors, and other production-related information
e.g., expiration dating. The dimensions of the reagent cartridges are: 13.5 mm (W) ×

L. Test Principle:
Cholesterol
The cholesterol in the sample is cleaved into cholesterol esters and free cholesterol.
The cholesterol esters become free cholesterol through the action of cholesterol
esterase (CE). The free cholesterol is then oxidized by cholesterol oxidase (COD) to
produce hydrogen peroxide, esters and free cholesterol. The cholesterol esters become
free cholesterol through the action of cholesterol esterase (CE). The hydrogen
peroxide oxidizes and condenses 4-aminoaminoantipyrine and N-ethyl-N-sulfobutyl-
m-toluidine (ESBmT) under the influence of peroxidase (POD) to produce a reddish-
purple pigment. Total cholesterol concentration is determined by measuring the
absorbance of this reddish-purple pigment. The difference in absorbance, monitored
bichromatically at 600 nm/800 nm, is directly proportional to the cholesterol
concentration in the sample.
HDL
By using a special surface-active agent that preferentially solubilizes HDL and not
other lipoproteins (LDL, VLDL, and chylomicrons), the HDL cholesterol is measured
via a quickly initiated enzymatic reaction. Therefore, only HDL cholesterol is
specifically measured. The released hydrogen peroxide oxidizes and condenses 4-
aminoaminoantipyrine and N,N'-bis(4-sulfobutyl)-m-toluidine disodium salt
(DSBmT) in the presence of peroxidase (POD) to produce a reddish-purple pigment.
HDL cholesterol concentration is determined by measuring the absorbance of this
reddish-purple pigment. The difference in absorbance, monitored bichromatically at
600 nm/700 nm is directly proportional to the HDL concentration in the sample.
LDL
The method, using a combination of two surfactants, is based on the principle that
each lipoprotein reacts with different surfactants, depending on their intrinsic
physicochemical property. In the first reaction, Surfactant 1 changes the structure of
only those lipoproteins other than LDL (i.e., chylomicron [CM], VLDL, and HDL),
and the resulting micellar cholesterol is consumed by the cholesterol oxidase and the
cholesterol esterase in a colorless reaction. In the second reaction, the remaining LDL
is modified by Surfactant 2, and that form of cholesterol is measured in a color
reaction.

Triglyceride
Free glycerol in the sample is converted to glycerol-3-phosphoric acid through the
action of glycerol kinase (GK) and the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) substrate.
Glycerol-3-phosphoric acid is converted to hydrogen peroxide via the action of
glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase (GPO); peroxide is then decomposed into water and
oxygen via the action of catalase. The neutral fat in the sample is quickly hydrolyzed
into glycerol and fatty acid by the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) contained in the second
reagent. The glycerol product is converted to glycerol-3-phosphoric acid via the
action of GK and the ATP substrate, which in turn produces hydrogen peroxide via
the action of GPO. The hydrogen peroxide oxidizes/condenses 4-aminoantipyrine and
N-ethyl-N-sulfobutyl-m-toluidine (ESBmT), via the action of peroxidase (POD) to
produce a reddish purple pigment. The original neutral fat concentration (triglyceride)
is determined by measuring the absorbance of the reddish purple pigment produced.
The difference in absorbance between the final reading and the blank, monitored
bichromatically at 600 nm/800 nm, is directly proportional to the triglyceride
concentration.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Each S Test cartridge lot is calibrated using standard material traceable to:
• CHO: NIST SRM 911
• TG: HECTEF (Healthcare Technology Foundation) standard serum
JCCRM 224.
• HDL: HECTEF (Healthcare technology foundation) standard serum for
measuring lipids
• LDL: Beta-Quantification Reference Method (CDC)
• Methods have not been CRMLN certified
d. Detection limit:
Per CLSI EP17-A blank samples for each reagent system were assayed 20
times per day for three days for a total of 60 replicate results to determine
LOB and LOD. Low samples were assayed 20 times with the specific reagent
cartridges to determine the detection limits below:
CHO: 0.7 mg/dL
HDL: 0.6 mg/dL
LDL: 0.8 mg/dL
TG: 2.5 mg/dL
The minimum measuring ranges of the assays were established based on
linearity studies (see M1b above).
e. Analytical specificity:

The studies followed CLSI EP7-A2. The data demonstrated that none of the
four analytes were affected by high levels of the following substances at the
levels noted below. The interference claim for each is defined by the sponsor
as the highest level of interferent that is within 10% of the neat sample.
• Hemoglobin: no interference up to 1000 mg/dL for CHO and LDL; 500
mg/dL for HDL and TG
• Unconjugated bilirubin no interference up to 50 mg/dL for CHO, HDL,
and TG; 25 mg/dL for LDL
• Lipemia: no interference up to 2000 mg/dL for CHO; up to 614 mg/dL for
HDL and LDL (TG: N/A)
• Ascorbic acid: no interference up to 50 mg/dL with any of the four test
systems
