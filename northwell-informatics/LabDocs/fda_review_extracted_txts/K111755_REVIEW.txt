510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
k111755
B. Purpose for Submission:
New device
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., Virtuoso System for IHC Ki67 (30-9)
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Computer-assisted image analysis scoring and manual scoring of digital images of
Ki67 immunohistochemistry stained slides.
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Virtuoso™ System is an instrument-plus-software system designed to assist
the qualified pathologist in the consistent assessment of protein expression in
immunohistochemically stained histologic sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded normal and neoplastic tissues.
The system consists of a slide scanner (iScan), computer, monitor, keyboard,
mouse, image analysis algorithms for specific immunohistochemical markers, and
software with a Windows web browser-based user interface. Virtuoso is a web-
based, end-to-end, digital pathology software solution that allows pathology
laboratories to acquire, manage, view, analyze, share, and report digital images of
pathology specimens. Using the Virtuoso software, the pathologist can view
digital images, add annotations, make measurements, perform image analysis, and
generate reports.
The Digital Read option allows the pathologist to score the Ki67 stained slide
digital image on a computer monitor. In the Image Analysis Application option,
slides are scored by the Ki67 image analysis application. This score is then
presented on the computer screen. The pathologist verifies this score and
confirms it.
Hardware: The iScan slide scanning device captures digital images of formalin-
fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues that are suitable for storage and viewing. The
device includes a digital slide scanner, racks for loading glass slides, computer,
scanner software, keyboard, mouse and monitor.
Software: The Virtuoso software is designed to complement the routine workflow
of a qualified pathologist in the review of immunohistochemically stained
histologic slides. It allows the user to select fields of view (FOVs) in the digital
image for analysis and provides quantitative data on these FOVs to assist with
interpretation. The software makes no independent interpretations of the data and
requires competent human intervention for all steps in the analysis process.
2. Principles of Operation:
The Virtuoso System for Ki67 (30-9) employs image analysis and pre-defined
1

--- Page 2 ---
parameters to obtain Ki67 staining scores. The identification of the nucleus is
carried out automatically by the image analysis algorithms. The steps involved in
the analysis algorithms are:
a. Image Enhancement: The image is enhanced by increasing the contrast to
make it more suitable for analysis.
b. Identification of the Epithelial Area: The algorithm separates the tissue area
from the background within the selected FOV such that only the tissue area is
processed in the following steps.
c. Identification of the Nucleus: The nuclei in the epithelial area are identified.
d. Classification: Cells are classified based on the extent, intensity and thickness
of nuclear staining.
e. Scoring/Grading: Based on the classification, an overall score for the image
is computed using the numbers of stained cells, non-stained cells, and total
cells for the calculations. The score assigned is based on the guidelines
indicated in the package insert for Ki67 (30-9).
3. Modes of Operation:
a. Manual scoring of immunohistochemically (IHC) Ki67 stained slide images
on a computer monitor (digital read).
b. Computer scoring of IHC Ki67 stained slide images performed by Ki67 (30-9)
Image Analysis Application. This score is verified by the pathologist.
4. Specimen Identification:
Glass tissue slides are identified by slide label or barcode (if provided by the user)
by scanning the whole slide including the label or barcode.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
IHC stained slides are manually loaded on to the iSCAN Coreo slide scanner
individually or in slide racks. The slide racks hold a maximum of 160 slides.
Under the default setting a thumbnail view of the slide and the area of interest
(AOI) in the slide is scanned. The operator has the option of rescanning the slide
after viewing the image on the computer monitor. Under the manual scanning
option, the user has the ability to select the scan area for single or batched slides.
6. Calibration:
The iSCAN Coreo contains a diagnostics module that can be run by the user.
This application tests the scanner hardware components and functions. These
tests must be run with nine custom slides calibrated for the module which can be
obtained from the sponsor.
7. Quality Control:
Quality control is performed by the operator before releasing the images to the
pathologist for review. Slides with sub-optimal images will be rescanned.

cross-over design from the primary study. A subset of the clinical cases (n = 40) was
scanned two more times with two different scanners at two separate locations. This
study evaluated scanner precision of the IA application only for both inter-scanner
precision and intra-scanner/inter-day precision. The IA generates an instrument-
generated Ki-67 score that is not affected by memory bias as would be the case with
human interpretations.
a. Accuracy:
This study was initially conducted in 3 sites with one pathologist at each site.
There were 120 specimens included in this study. All pathologists read all the
slides under the three different modes – manual, DR and IA scoring. There was a
wash-out period of 7 days between reads with each different modality. The data
were categorized as “negative” and “positive” using Ki-67 scoring criteria as
follows: 0-10% of cells staining = Negative and >10% cells staining as Positive.
The acceptance criteria of 75% or above agreement rates were set by the sponsor.
Due to the inherent variability that is present in the manual method of scoring
these slides, FDA requested that the sponsor perform the same study at an
additional study site (site 4). This additional study site had one pathologist who
read all the slides under the three different modes as above. All other study
criteria were the same as above. In the study comparing DR scoring to manual
read and in the study comparing IA scoring to the manual method the acceptance
criteria were met in at least three sites. The percent agreements across the 4 sites
with the 95% confidence intervals (CI) around the agreements are shown below.

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility
Reproducibility of the device was assessed during slide reading sessions. A
slide reading session consisted of pathologists conducting a digital read (DR) or
image analysis (IA) of all 40 slides. There was a 7-day wash-out period
between slide reading sessions. An agreement of ≥75% between each of the
three reading sessions (Session 1 vs. Session 2, Session 1 vs. Session 3, and
Session 2 vs. Session 3) for the Virtuoso digital read (DR) application was
considered acceptable intra-pathologist/inter-day scoring performance
(maximum n = 40). The same criterion was established for the Virtuoso image
analysis application (IA) (maximum n = 40). Agreement was analyzed based
upon the following score classification: 0 to 0.99% cells staining = Negative
(0); 1 to 10% (1) and >10% (2) cells staining = Positive. The agreement rate set
by the sponsor was met in each study.

comparing the agreement data in a pair-wise manner between Site 1 vs. Site 2,
Site 1 vs. Site 3, and Site 2 vs. Site 3. This was done for both DR and IA, and
used the same 75% acceptance criterion. The discrepancy in agreement in site 1
was noted to be for specimens around the cutoff value for the Ki-67 score.

Scanner Precision
This study evaluated scanner precision of the image analysis application. The
scanner precision study was designed to assess the performance of the Virtuoso
system’s scanner (iScan) in isolation from other variables. As the DR and IA
images were derived from a single scanning “run,” this study held other
variables constant. This study utilized a randomly selected subset of 40 cases
from the accuracy study. The clinical cases spanned the range of the Ki-67
scoring categories (0, 1 and 2) and the slides were stained with both universal
DAB detection kits (iVIEW and ultraView). A subset of the clinical cases (n =
40) was scanned two more times on two different days with two different
scanners at two separate locations. The acceptance criteria set by the sponsor of
a minimum of 85% agreement rate was met in these studies.
