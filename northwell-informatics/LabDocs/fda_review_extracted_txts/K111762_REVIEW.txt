I. Device Description:
The ST AIA-PACK DHEA-S CALIBRATOR SET contains ready to use human sera
(sodium azide as a preservative) with assigned levels of DHEA-S. Calibration should be
performed according to the schedule indicated in the TOSOH AIA System Operator’s
Manual.
The sponsor declared in the labeling that the material derived from human origin used in the
preparations of these calibrators has been tested by FDA-cleared methods and found negative
for the presence of HBsAg and antibody to HIV-1 and HCV.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The assayed value of each calibrator level was standardized against reference calibrators.
The reference calibrators were prepared by weighing dehydroisoandrosterone 3-sulfate
sodium salt dihydrate (DHEA) from a commercial vendor into an analyte-free human
serum matrix.
Value Assignment:
For each calibrator set lot manufactured, the calibrators are assayed in 5 replicates each
on two AIA-1800 analyzers using 3 lots of reagent. The instruments were calibrated
using the reference calibrators. The assigned value of each calibrator is the grand mean of
30 determinations of the respective calibrator level.

Stability:
Real time testing was performed at one site using one AIA-1800 analyzer. The stability
protocol and the acceptance criteria have been reviewed and found to be acceptable.
• Shelf-life stability:
Real time testing result support the package insert claim of 12 months at 2-8oC.
• Open-vial stability:
Real time testing result support the package insert claim that the calibrator set is
stable for one day after it had been opened, sealed and stored at 2-8oC.
• Calibration stability:
Real time testing results support the package insert claim of 90 days from the date of
calibration.
