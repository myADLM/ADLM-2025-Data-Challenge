H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use:
The Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) Influenza A
& B Detection Kit is intended for use on the JBAIDS instruments, for the in vitro
qualitative detection of Influenza A and Influenza B viral nucleic acids isolated and
purified from nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and nasopharyngeal wash (NPW) specimens
from human patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. The JBAIDS
Influenza A & B Detection Kit contains reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain
reaction (rRT-PCR) assays that target the Matrix protein gene of Influenza A viruses, and
the Non-structural protein gene of Influenza B viruses. This kit is not intended to detect
Influenza C viruses.
Test results are to be used in conjunction with other clinical and epidemiological
information. Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be
used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.
Performance characteristics for detection of influenza A were established when 2009
H1N1 Influenza, Influenza A H1N1, and Influenza A H3N2 were the predominant
influenza A viruses in circulation. Due to low seasonal prevalence, performance
characteristics for detection of seasonal Influenza A/H1 were established primarily with
retrospective and surrogate clinical specimens. When other influenza A viruses are
present, performance characteristics may vary.
All users, analysts, and any person reporting diagnostic results from use of this device
should be trained to perform and interpret the results from this procedure by JBAIDS
instructors or designees prior to use. Use of this device is limited to designated
Department of Defense (DoD) laboratories equipped with the JBAIDS instruments.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent
influenza viruses and sent to state or local health departments for testing. Viral culture
should not be attempted in these cases unless a biosafety laboratory (BSL) 3+ facility is
available to receive and culture specimens.
2. Indication for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:

I. Device Description:
The JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit is a real time RT-PCR assay based on the
influenza A and Influenza B assays that are part of the “CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-
time RT-PCR Detection and Characterization Panel (rRT-PCR Flu Panel)”. These assays
have been re-optimized to work with Idaho Technology’s proprietary freeze-dried PCR
reagent formulation. Purified patient samples (using either the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path
Purification Kit or the Roche MagNA Pure Compact Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I in
conjunction with the Roche MagNA Pure Compact system) are used to reconstitute the
freeze-dried reagents which are then tested using the JBAIDS instrument.
Each JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit contains sufficient reagents for testing 20
specimens. There are eight vacuum-sealed control pouches of freeze-dried PCR reagents (4
reagent vials each), 20 vacuum-sealed sample testing pouches of freeze-dried PCR reagents
(3 reagent vials each), and eight pouches containing one tube each of reconstitution buffer
and reagent grade water. Once resuspended, each reagent vial provides enough material for
one reaction.
Each control pouch contains the following four vials:
• Positive Control (+) vials (Flu A and Flu B). Once reconstituted, each Positive
Control vial contains all reagents necessary for RT-PCR of the appropriate target,
including an assay-specific synthetic RNA target. The Positive Controls are
resuspended with 10 μL reconstitution buffer and 10 μL reagent grade water before
testing in parallel with patient specimens. Amplification in the Positive Control gives
assurance that kit reagents are functioning properly and that the assay setup has been
performed correctly. A Positive Control must be included for each assay in the
JBAIDS run.
Ingredients: Each Positive Control vial contains <0.001% DNA polymerase complex;
<0.001% Reverse Transcriptase; <0.001% target-specific forward and reverse primer;
<0.001% target-specific hydrolysis probes; <0.05% dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP;
<0.001% assay-specific synthetic target RNA; bovine serum albumin; dithiothreitol;
RNase inhibitor; and carbohydrate.
• Negative Control (-) vials (Flu A and Flu B). Once reconstituted, each Negative
Control vial contains all reagents required to perform a RT-PCR reaction except the
target RNA, and should therefore give negative results. The Negative Controls are re-
suspended with 10 μL reconstitution buffer and 10 μL nuclease-free water that has
been purified with a nucleic acid purification kit (NEC). The reconstituted negative
control is then tested in parallel with patient specimens to provide assurance that the
purification and setup procedures have been performed without contamination. A
Negative Control must be included for each assay in the JBAIDS run.
Ingredients: Each Negative Control vial contains <0.001% DNA polymerase complex;
<0.001% Reverse Transcriptase; <0.001% target-specific forward and reverse primer;
<0.001% target-specific hydrolysis probes; <0.05% dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP;
bovine serum albumin; dithiothreitol; RNase inhibitor; and carbohydrate.

--- Page 4 ---
Each sample testing pouch contains the following three vials:
• Unknown vials (Flu A and Flu B). Once reconstituted, each Unknown vial contains
all reagents necessary for RT-PCR of the appropriate target, except target template.
The Unknown vials are resuspended with 10 μL reconstitution buffer and 10 μL
purified patient sample, and will therefore give negative results unless the appropriate
template is found in the patient sample.
Ingredients: Each Negative Control vial contains <0.001% DNA polymerase complex;
<0.001% Reverse Transcriptase; <0.001% target-specific forward and reverse primer;
<0.001% target-specific hydrolysis probes; <0.05% dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP;
bovine serum albumin; dithiothreitol; RNase inhibitor; and carbohydrate.
• Flu SC vial. Once reconstituted, the Flu SC vial contains reagents that amplify and
detect the human genomic RNase P sequence. The target sequence consists of RNase
P-specific primer binding sites and an RNase P-specific probe binding site. The Flu
SC is resuspended with 10 μL reconstitution buffer and 10 μL purified patient sample
to ensure patient nucleic acid is available in the sample, and that RT-PCR-inhibiting
substances in the test specimen are detected, thereby preventing false negative results.
Ingredients: Each Flu SC vial contains <0.001% DNA polymerase complex; <0.001%
Reverse Transcriptase; <0.001% RNase P-specific forward and reverse primer;
<0.001% RNase P-specific hydrolysis probes; <0.05% dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP;
bovine serum albumin; dithiothreitol; RNase inhibitor; and carbohydrate.
Each reconstitution buffer/reagent grade water pouch contains the following two vials:
• 2X Reconstitution Buffer (2X RB). The buffer solution (purple buffer) is matched to
the Influenza assays and is used undiluted. The buffer enhances PCR kinetics and is
used to re-suspend JBAIDS freeze-dried reagents. Once reconstituted, all freeze dried
reagent vials contain all of the components required for PCR.
Contents: 600 μL
• Reagent Grade Water. Reagent grade water is molecular biology grade water used to
reconstitute the Positive Controls.

L. Test Principle:
The JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit is a real time RT-PCR assay based on the
influenza A and Influenza B assays that are part of the “CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-
time RT-PCR Detection and Characterization Panel (rRT-PCR Flu Panel)”. These assays
have been re-optimized to work with Idaho Technology’s proprietary freeze-dried PCR

conjunction with the Roche MagNA Pure Compact system) are used to reconstitute the
freeze-dried reagents which are then tested using the JBAIDS instrument.
Real-time RT-PCR involves reverse transcription of specific RNA sequences into
complementary DNA sequences, followed by logarithmic amplification and simultaneous
detection of those DNA sequences. The JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit assays use
hydrolysis probes to detect amplification of the reverse transcribed RNA sequence of
interest. Each hydrolysis probe is labeled on 5’ end with a fluorescent reporter moiety (6-
FAM) and elsewhere with a quencher (TAMRA), which prevents the probe from emitting
fluorescent signal. During PCR, the probe binds to a target sequence in the PCR product.
When the Taq polymerase replicates a template to which a hydrolysis probe is bound, the
exonuclease activity of the polymerase cleaves the probe, separating the fluorophore from
the quencher, and fluorescent signal is generated. This fluorescence is measured and
displayed by the JBAIDS instrument during the PCR reaction. The fluorescent signal
increases as additional template is amplified and more probes are hydrolyzed.
The JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit contains three assays: Influenza A (Flu A);
Influenza B (Flu B); and the RNase P Sample Control Assay (Flu SC). The Flu A assay
amplifies a sequence within the matrix protein gene (segment 7) of influenza A viruses.
The Flu B assay amplifies a sequence within the non-structural protein gene (segment 8) of
influenza B viruses. The Flu SC assay amplifies a sequence within the human gene
encoding ribonuclease P (RNase P).
The JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit is based on four major processes:
• Sample collection and purification
• Reconstitution of freeze-dried reagents
• Amplification and detection of target nucleic acid on the JBAIDS instrument
• Automated interpretation of the amplification curves and report generation using the
JBAIDS software.
The JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit can be used to test NPS and NPW specimens.
Samples must be purified prior to testing with the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit.
The purpose of sample purification is to release nucleic acid contained in the patient
sample and to remove extraneous materials (e.g., proteins and chemicals) that can interfere
with the PCR reaction. The JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit has been validated for
use with either the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit or the Roche MagNA
Pure Compact Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I on the Roche MagNA Pure Compact system.
The Platinum Path kit is a manual purification, while the Roche MagNA Pure system is
automated. Both methods have four basic steps: lysis to release the nucleic acids, binding
of the nucleic acids to a magnetic substrate, washing away extraneous materials, and
elution of the purified nucleic acid. A brief outline of the two purification kit methods is
provided below:

containing elution buffer. The nucleic acids
are released from the magnetic beads. The
beads are then removed from the sample
using the pick pen.
*All steps are automated within the Roche MagNA Pure Compact instrument.
Negative Extraction Controls (NECs) are processed along with each batch of purified
specimens. When processing NECs, the user utilizes the Sample Purification Kit to purify a
sample of nuclease-free water. The purified NEC sample is then used to reconstitute the
freeze-dried Negative Control vials. The use of an NEC allows for detection of
contamination during the entire testing process (purification to reagent setup).
Purified samples are tested using the freeze-dried reagents in the JBAIDS Influenza A & B
Detection Kit. Reagent vials that are intended for testing patient samples are labeled as
Unknowns. Each JBAIDS run requires a Positive Control and a Negative Control for each
target assay. The JBAIDS runs should be started within about 30 minutes after
reconstitution of the freeze-dried reagents. If necessary, the reconstituted reagents can be
stored for up to four hours on ice or in the refrigerator (2-8 °C).
Reagents are set up in the following order:
1. Unknowns – Reconstitute the reagent pellet in the Unknown vials (Flu A and Flu B) by
adding 10 μL of the provided reconstitution buffer and 10 μL of the purified sample.
2. Sample Control – Repeat the above process with a Sample Control vial.
3. Positive Controls – After the Unknowns and the Sample Control are set up for each
sample, set up the Positive Controls by reconstituting the pellet with 10 μL of the
provided reconstitution buffer and 10 μL of the provided reagent-grade water.
4. Negative Controls – Set up the Negative Controls last by reconstituting the pellet with
10 μL reconstitution buffer and 10 μL of the purified NEC.

5. For each reagent vial, transfer 19 μL of the reconstituted reagent to a capillary
following the same order used for reconstitution. The cap is placed on the capillary tube
before proceeding to the next capillary.
6. Centrifuge the capillary tubes to ensure that the PCR reagent is in the tip of the
capillary.
Each JBAIDS run can accommodate up to 9 samples with accompanying controls. The
Diagnostic Wizard guides the operator through the process of setting up the run in
compliance with the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit package insert. After
selecting the appropriate assays and entering sample information, the operator transfers
prepared capillaries to the instrument carousel, guided by the loading pattern displayed in
the Diagnostic Wizard. With the capillaries loaded into the instrument, the operator signals
the instrument to start the PCR run. The instrument automatically controls the temperature
heating cycle in the carousel. At intervals during temperature cycling, fluorescence
emission is monitored as the carousel rotates to position each sample above the fluorimeter.
Temperature and fluorescence data are displayed in real-time. After starting the run, no
input is required and the operator need not supervise the run. At the conclusion of the run,
the operator may proceed directly to data analysis and reporting.
Each JBAIDS test is analyzed and assigned a final result by the Detector module of the
JBAIDS Software. Possible final results are positive, negative, uncertain, sample control
failure (SC Failure) or invalid. To assign a final test result, Detector first analyzes the data
from each capillary independently. Then, the software assigns a final result, or a combined
call, based on the results of the sample and all of its controls.
Each stage of the analysis is described below:
1. Independent Capillary Call
Detector does not rely on any single aspect of the amplification curve, but rather
integrates a number of factors, such as curve shape and signal-to-noise ratio into a
combined score. Curves scoring above a threshold are called positive, curves scoring
below a threshold are called negative, and curves scoring in a small area in between are
called uncertain. The scoring system has been carefully tuned to match human expert
calls on real amplification curve data.
Detector calls are characterized as follows:
Negative – A curve is called negative if its shape can be closely approximated by a line
(or smooth curve), if it has low signal to noise, and if it shows little or no increase in
fluorescence during the PCR.
Positive – A curve is called positive if the fluorescence shows exponential growth out
of the background, if it has high signal to noise, and if the slope of the exponential
region of the amplification is consistent with PCR amplification.
Uncertain – For a small number of curves (about 0.2%) no clear call is possible and the
reaction is called uncertain.
10

--- Page 11 ---
2. Test Result or Combined Call
The final test result is a combined call (or meta-call) based on the results of the test
sample and its associated controls.
Flow chart outlining how final results are determined
3. Follow-up Testing for Invalid, Uncertain or Sample Control (SC) Failure Results
If the Flu A and Flu B assays yield a negative or positive result, then the JBAIDS
testing is complete. Any other result requires follow-up testing, as described below:
• Invalid – If either the Positive Control or Negative Control fails to give the
expected results, all Unknown samples for that specific assay are called invalid
and must be retested using the same purified sample. This testing can be done
using the Custom Testing Method.
• Uncertain – An uncertain result on a single sample requires retesting with the
same purified sample. This testing can be done using the Custom Testing
Method.
• Sample Control Failure – A failed Sample Control can occur from PCR
inhibition, inefficient sample purification, or poor specimen collection. Any
sample having a failed Sample Control assay (i.e. negative or uncertain Sample
11

--- Page 12 ---
Control assay associated with a negative or uncertain Target assay) will be
retested using the original (undiluted) purified sample as well as a ten-fold
dilution of the purified sample.
(cid:131) If the Sample Control Failure was due to an inhibitor present in the sample,
the repeat testing should yield a result of Sample Control Failure for the
undiluted sample and a valid result (positive or negative) for the sample
diluted 1:10. The results from the retesting can be used for diagnostic
applications only if the diluted sample tests target positive. A target negative
result for the sample cannot be reported for the sample diluted to 1:10,
because it is unknown if the target negative result is a true negative, is due to
inhibitors, or is due to target template being diluted below the limit of
detection.
(cid:131) If the Sample Control Failure result was caused by improper technique, or
other factors, then the repeat testing for the undiluted sample may yield a
valid target assay result (positive or negative) with a positive SC result. In
this case, the target assay result from the retesting of the undiluted sample
can be used to support diagnostic decisions.
(cid:131) If the Sample Control Failure was caused by ineffective sample purification
or an improperly collected specimen, then the repeat testing result will most
likely be Sample Control Failure. In this case, residual patient specimen can
be re-extracted and tested (provided it was appropriately stored) or a new
specimen should be requested, re-extracted, and tested.
4. JBAIDS Report
A JBAIDS report is generated automatically for each test run. With the JBAIDS
Report, the user integrates the instrument-provided results for each influenza assay to
make a final result interpretation.
5. Integrated Result Interpretation
The JBAIDS software automatically interprets the results for each of the target assays.
However, the user is required to make the final test interpretation based upon the final
test results for each of the two target assays. All possible results and interpretations
are presented in the following table:

1Recent patient exposure to the FluMist® intranasal vaccine may result in false positive
results and should be considered as a possible interferent when multiple influenza infections
are detected.
6. Custom Test Method
The Custom Test Method can be used to test individual assays from the JBAIDS
Influenza A & B Detection Kit. Reasons to use the Custom Test Method include:
• PC or NC failure invalidates the results for only one of the three assays
requiring retesting of all samples with only that assay.
• A sample is uncertain for one of the assays, requiring retesting with only that
assay.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A multicenter reproducibility study was performed to determine the overall system
reproducibility of the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit on the JBAIDS instruments.
This study was performed at Idaho Technology Inc. (ITI) and two external sites. The
study was conducted with two specimen types: nasopharyngeal wash (NPW) and
nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), both collected in viral transport medium (VTM). Both
specimen types were purified using two different Sample Purification Kits, the Roche
MagNA Pure Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I and the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path Sample
Purification Kit.
A total of four different panels of 9 samples each were prepared for the reproducibility
study.
• Panel 1 contained 9 NPS specimens that were screened with the Flu A and Flu B
assays to ensure that no influenza nucleic acid was present, each spiked with a
representative Influenza A virus strain (A/New Caledonia/20/1999) at one of the
three different concentrations (LoD/20, LoD, and 3X LoD). Therefore, Panel 1
consisted of 3 Influenza A virus spiked medium positive NPS specimens (3X
LoD), 3 Influenza A virus spiked low positive NPS specimens (LoD), and 3
Influenza A virus spiked high negative NPS specimens.
• Panel 2 contained 9 NPW specimens that were screened with the Flu A and Flu B
assays to ensure that no influenza nucleic acid was present, each spiked with a
representative Influenza A virus strain (A/New Caledonia/20/1999) at one of the

three different concentrations (LoD/20, LoD, and 3X LoD). Therefore, Panel 2
consisted of 3 Influenza A virus spiked medium positive NPW specimens (3X
LoD), 3 Influenza A virus spiked low positive NPW specimens (LoD), and 3
Influenza A virus spiked high negative NPW specimens.
• Panel 3 contained 9 simulated NPS (sNPS) specimens that were screened with the
Flu A and Flu B assays to ensure that no influenza nucleic acid was present, each
spiked with a representative Influenza B strain (B/Ohio/1/2005) at one of the three
different concentrations (LoD/20, LoD, and 3X LoD). sNPS were generated from
diluting HeLa cells into VTM. (Note: refer to the “Validation of Simulated
Sample Matrices” section for details). Therefore, Panel 3 consisted of 3 Influenza
B virus spiked medium positive sNPS specimens (3X LoD), 3 Influenza B virus
spiked low positive sNPS specimens (LoD), and 3 Influenza B virus spiked high
negative sNPS specimens.
• Panel 4 contained 9 simulated NPW (sNPW) specimens that were screened with
the Flu A and Flu B assays to ensure that no influenza nucleic acid was present,
each spiked with a representative Influenza B strain (B/Ohio/1/2005) at one of the
three different concentrations (LoD/20, LoD, and 3X LoD). sNPW were
generated from diluting HeLa cells into 50% VTM and 50% saline (0.9% NaCl).
(Note: refer to the “Validation of Simulated Sample Matrices” section for details).
Therefore, Panel 4 consisted of 3 Influenza B virus spiked medium positive
sNPW specimens (3X LoD), 3 Influenza B virus spiked low positive sNPW
specimens (LoD), and 3 Influenza B virus spiked high negative sNPW specimens.
Note: Panels 3 and 4 specimens were also co-spiked with a representative seasonal
influenza A H3N2 virus strain (A/New York/55/2004) for more efficient reproducibility
testing of the JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit. Refer to the “Co-spiking Specimen
Validation” section for details demonstrating that combining these two viruses in a
sample, even at high concentrations, had no detrimental effect on the detection of either
virus.

Each panel of 9 samples was tested twice daily for five days at each testing site. Every
testing day, two users each tested each of the nine samples. Prior to testing with the
JBAIDS assays, one user used the Roche MagNA Pure Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I and
the other user used the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit to extract viral
nucleic acid from each sample. For each panel, each sample was tested a total of 30 times
(2 runs/day/site X 5 days X 3 Sites; 15 times after purification with the Platinum Path kit
and 15 times after purification with the MagNA Pure kit), and each concentration level
per sample type was tested a total of 90 times (3 samples spiked at each concentration
level in each of the 4 panels).
Each JBAIDS run performed in this study included Positive Control (PC) and negative
extraction control (NEC) reactions. (Note: to ensure that no contamination of virus or
amplification product was contracted during sample preparation and reaction setup, a
NEC, which was an aliquot of reagent grade water, was prepared and tested with each
batch of purified samples.)
Of the 63 Flu A PC and NEC reactions tested in this study, all were valid. The Flu A PC
reactions had a mean Cp of 28.87 ± 0.69 (2.39 % CV). Of the 65 Flu B PC reactions
tested in this study, three Flu B PC reactions failed (4.6%). The other 62 Flu B PC
reactions (96.4%) yielded positive results. Two of the failed Flu B PC reactions were due
to run failures successfully detected by the controls. These run failures appear to be due
to the carousel being improperly seated by the user. This shifted the capillaries during the
test run, resulting in a loss of fluorescence detection in all samples. The JBAIDS software
correctly failed the PC reactions and the test runs were called invalid. No data were
collected from these failed runs. The purified samples from these failed runs were valid
upon retesting. The remaining failed Flu B PC was from an unknown assay vial, which
contained no PC template, being used for the PC reaction. Upon retesting the purified
samples with the correct controls, the run was successful. All Flu B NEC samples tested
in this study yielded negative results. The Flu B PC reactions had a mean Cp of 26.59 ±
0.23 (0.86 % CV).
The Flu Sample Control assay (human RNase P assay) was tested with each purified
sample to detect inhibition, poor sample extraction, or poor specimen collection. A total
of 1085 out of 1093 (99.3%) Sample Control reactions produced the expected positive

results in the reproducibility study. All 8 Flu SC negative results were from NPW or
sNPW samples, which may contain fewer human cells per volume than swab samples.
Because negative Flu SC assay results only invalidate negative influenza assays, 6 of
these 8 negative Flu SC results had no impact on the study; the corresponding influenza
assays had the expected positive metacall results. The other 2 negative Flu SC tests
resulted in SC Failures, and both occurred with the same sample. On the initial run the
sample gave an SC Failure call. According to the protocol, the purified sample was
retested; both undiluted and diluted 1:10. The retest results were again a SC Failure for
the undiluted sample. Therefore a new aliquot of the same sample was re-extracted and
tested. Results of the second retest were positive for both the Flu B and Flu SC assays.
NPS and NPW samples exhibited mean Cp values of 30.15 ± 2.36 (7.83 % CV) and 33.18
±1.88 (5.67 % CV), respectively, with the Flu SC assay. The HeLa cell concentrations
determined for sNPS and sNPW samples were chosen to mimic Flu SC Cp values of
fresh specimens. sNPS and sNPW samples had mean Cp values of 32.09 ± 1.77 (5.52 %
CV) and 34.61 ±2.12 (6.13 % CV), respectively, with the Flu SC assay. The roughly 5-8%
CV measured for each sample type is from Cp variation for the Flu SC assay between the
two sample purification kits. Typically MagNA Pure extracted samples exhibit Cp values
4 cycles earlier than respective Platinum Path extracted samples.

This reproducibility study demonstrated that as expected with all real-time PCR assays,
the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit may not generate reproducibly positive
results when testing samples that have analyte concentrations lower than the LoD
concentration, but higher than the assay cutoff concentration. This limitation should be
addressed by including the following statement in the Limitation section of the JBAIDS
Influenza A & B Detection Kit Instructions for Use: “The JBAIDS Influenza A & B
Detection Kit may not generate reproducibly positive results when testing samples that
have analyte concentrations lower than the LoD concentration, but higher than the
assay cutoff concentration.”
The variability of the Cp value can be used as an additional measure of the variability of
JBAIDS assays. Therefore, the average and %CV of Cp values obtained in this study
were used to further evaluate the precision/reproducibility of the test system.

Assay Controls
The following controls are included in the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit:
Negative Control
The NC is used to detect contamination from target-specific amplified product
(amplicon), synthetic RNA (as found in the PC vials), or virus. The NC vial is
reconstituted using the purified negative extraction control (NEC) (molecular biology
grade water). The NEC should be processed along with each batch of specimens purified.
The NC detects possible contamination during sample purification and during
reconstitution of freeze- dried reagents. Each JBAIDS run requires one NC for the Flu A
assay and one NC for the Flu B assay. For each target assay, the NC must be negative, or
the JBAIDS software will assign invalid results for that target assay to all of the samples
in that run. If the NC fails, the JBAIDS run must be repeated using the same purified
samples. If the NC fails again, all associated samples are considered to have invalid
results and should be re-purified starting from another aliquot of the original specimens.
Of the 63 Flu A NC reactions tested in the reproducibility study, all were valid. All Flu B
NC samples tested in the reproducibility study also yielded negative results.
Of 229 runs, there were a total of one (0.4%) run in which the NC failed. The failure
appears to be the result of user errors rather than failure of the test system. This failure
occurred at Site 1, and was a result of switching the positions of the NCs and PCs for
both the Flu A and Flu B assays when loading the capillaries into the JBAIDS carousel.
Positive Control
The PC serves as an amplification and detection control. Each JBAIDS run requires one
PC for the Flu A assay and one PC for the Flu B assay. For each target assay, the PC
must be positive. If the PC fails, the JBAIDS software will assign invalid results for that
target assay to all of the associated samples, and the JBAIDS run must be repeated
starting from the same purified specimens. Failure of the PCs may indicate errors in
sample setup, degradation of the reagents, or a malfunction of the JBAIDS instrument.
All of the 63 Flu A PC reactions tested in the reproducibility study were valid. The Flu A
PC reactions had a mean Cp of 28.87 ± 0.69 (2.39 % CV). Of the 65 Flu B PC reactions
tested in this study, three Flu B PC reactions failed (4.6%). The Flu B PC reactions had a
mean Cp of 26.59 ± 0.23 (0.86 % CV).
Of 229 runs in the prospective clinical study, there were a total of three (1.3%) runs in
which the PCs failed. All of the failures appear to be the result of user errors rather than
failure of the test system. Two failures occurred at Site 1. The first failure was a result of
19

--- Page 20 ---
switching the positions of the NCs and PCs for both the Flu A and Flu B assays when
loading the capillaries into the JBAIDS carousel. The second failure occurred because the
PCs for both the Flu A and Flu B assays failed to amplify. The third failure occurred at
Site 2 due to an improperly seated carousel causing the amplification curves to be
interpreted as negative. There was minimal site to site variation with the PCs. The mean
PC Cp value for Flu A was 28.3 ± 0.7 (2.3 % CV) and for Flu B was 26.5 ± 0.2 (0.9%
CV).
The final Cp cutoff value for the Flu A and Flu B assay positive controls are 35.5 and
32.0 respectively, and are based on the upper bound of the manufacturing QA Review
range for reagent lot release plus 4 x SD. The estimated standard deviation (SD) was set
to 0.9 Cp to reflect the amount of variation that is consistent with data obtained in the
JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit and the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit
analytical and clinical studies. If an amplification curve for a PC fails to amplify or has a
Cp value later than the cutoff, the PC will be interpreted as a failure and the associated
patient test results will be assigned an invalid test result.
Sample Control (SC)
The sample control assay (Flu SC) detects the human RNase P gene. This assay is
designed to guard against false negative results caused by an improperly collected
specimen, ineffective purification of nucleic acids and or inhibition of the PCR reaction.
A properly collected NPS or NPW specimen contains human cells from which the RNase
P target is recovered during sample purification. Following purification, each sample is
then tested with the Flu A and Flu B target assays, as well as the Flu SC. If purification
and amplification were successful, then the Flu SC will give the expected positive test
result. The JBAIDS software automatically assigns a result of sample control failure
when (1) the Flu SC is unsuccessful and (2) the target assay is negative (or uncertain).
Extraction Control (EC)
Positive Extraction Control (PEC) was not provided with the kit, and inclusion of a PEC
with each batch of extracted samples is not a standard part of the testing protocol
recommended in the product package insert. However, during the clinical study, a PEC
and a NEC were purified with each batch of clinical samples. Inclusion of a NEC with
each batch of purified samples is a standard part of the testing protocol recommended in
the product package insert. PECs were simulated NPS (sNPS; HeLa cells in viral
transport media) spiked with four representative influenza strains (Influenza B, seasonal
Influenza A H1N1, seasonal Influenza A H3N2, and Influenza A 2009 H1N1) at
concentrations near the LoD for the influenza assays. The PEC was processed and tested
in the same manner as a patient sample. The PEC was considered successful when all
tested target assays were positive. A failed PEC was retested using the same purified
sample and the results of the retest were accepted as the final result. If the retest was
unsuccessful, all associated samples were considered to have invalid results and required
re-purification in order to obtain a valid test result. During the clinical evaluation, four
out of a total of 190 PECs (2.11%) required retesting (three at site 1 and one at site 2). All
four PECs were successful upon retesting. The mean Cp of the PEC tested for the Flu A
assay was 28.7, with 2.2 Standard Deviation (SD) and 7.7 % CV. The mean Cp of the
20

--- Page 21 ---
PEC tested for the Flu B assay was 29.0, with 1.7 Standard Deviation (SD) and 5.9 % CV.
The NEC was a nuclease-free water sample that was processed with each batch of
specimen purifications. The purified NEC sample was then used to reconstitute the
freeze-dried NC.
Specimen Stability
The sponsor recommends that MPW and NPS specimens be collected and placed into
viral transport media (VTM). Once collected, specimens may be tested immediately after
collection, transported to an off-site testing location, or temporarily stored until testing
can be scheduled. Inappropriate handling or storage may compromise the integrity of the
specimens and cause inaccurate test results. An analytical study determining the
appropriate storage times and temperatures for both unprocessed specimens (e.g., the
NPW and NPS specimens) and processed samples (e.g., purified nucleic acid from NPW
and NPS specimens) was carried out. The specimen transport and storage conditions that
were evaluated are based on common clinical laboratory workflows.
Due to the potential combined use of the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit with the
JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit, three Influenza A subtype strains (i.e., Influenza
A/H1, Influenza A/H3, and Influenza A 2009 H1N1) were evaluated with the Flu A assay
for both unprocessed and purified samples. One influenza B strain was evaluated with the
Flu B assay.
Note: Specimens spiked with the representative Influenza B virus (B/Ohio/1/2005) were
also co-spiked with a representative seasonal influenza A H3N2 virus strain (A/New
York/55/2004) for more efficient testing of the JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit. Refer
to the “Co-spiking Specimen Validation” section for details demonstrating that
combining these two viruses in a sample, even at high concentrations, had no detrimental
effect on the detection of either virus
For the unprocessed specimen transport and storage evaluation, both negative and
positive specimens were assessed. Positive specimens were spiked with Influenza A
and/or B viruses at the established LoD for the respective assay. Eight positive (per
influenza strain) and four negative specimens were processed at each time point and
storage condition per purification kit prior to testing with the freeze-dried reagents. Both
specimen types (NPW and NPS) were evaluated independently.
For the purified sample transport and storage evaluation, sets of eight positive samples
(per influenza strain) and four negative samples that had been processed with either
purification method were tested immediately and also aliquoted for storage under various
conditions prior to retesting with the freeze-dried reagents. Purified samples were also
tested to determine the storage of reconstituted freeze-dried reagents.
The following table summarizes the final conditions that were evaluated in this study:

The performance at each time point was evaluated by comparing the JBAIDS assay result
(positive, negative, uncertain, or SC fail) to the expected result and the result at the initial
time point. To be acceptable, all negative samples must be negative for the influenza
assays and positive for the Flu SC assay, and seven of eight positive samples must test
positive for the relevant assays (Flu SC, Flu A and/or Flu B). In addition, the mean Cp
and F values of the stored sample set were compared to those obtained at the initial
max
time point. For an acceptable storage condition, the mean Cp of the influenza assays for
the positive sample set should not increase by more than 3 cycles, and the mean F
max
must not decrease by more than 50%. For the Flu SC assay, the amount of target material
in individual NPW and NPS specimens is variable; mean Cp and mean F values were
max
calculated and monitored for major shifts in performance for both positive and negative
samples.
Unprocessed Specimen Storage Conditions Test Results
At least seven of the eight positive human derived NPS and NPW specimens in each
sample set tested positive at all four time points with the respective assay. With the
exception of Influenza A/H1 NPS samples processed by MagNA Pure after 30 days of
storage, the mean Cp values for the stored specimens were all within 3 cycles of the day 0
time point, suggesting no decrease in assay performance with storage. The one set of
samples (i.e., Influenza A/H1 NPS samples processed by MagNA Pure after 30 days of
storage) that the Influenza A assay mean Cp values for the stored specimens were greater
than 3 cycles of the day 0 time point exceeded the acceptance criteria and could indicate
degradation of the samples. However, all of the samples gave the expected positive
results and this greater than 3 cycle shift in Cp was not consistent for other samples
processed with MagNA Pure at this time point, indicating that accurate test results are not
significantly compromised under this storage condition. In addition, the average F
max
values for the time points were never less than 50% of the F of the day 0 baseline
max
indicating no reduction in test system performance. All 4 negative samples for both
specimen types tested negative at all three time points. The mean Cp and F values of
max
the associated Sample Control assays were similar at all four time points.

These results indicate that NPS and NPW specimens can be stored at 18-30 °C for up to
four hours, at 2-8 °C for up to three days, and at ≤ -15 °C for up to thirty days prior to
testing without compromising the results.
Purified Sample Storage Conditions Test Results
At least seven of the eight purified human derived NPS and NPW positive samples in
each sample set tested positive at each time point with the respective assay. The average
Cp values for the stored samples were all within 3 cycles of the day 0 time point
suggesting no decrease in assay performance with storage. In addition, the average F
max

max
indicating no reduction of test system performance. All negative specimens tested
negative at each time point. The mean Cp and F values of the associated Flu SC assays

were similar at all four time points.
These results indicate that purified samples can be stored at 18-30 °C for up to four hours,
at 2-8 °C for up to one day, and frozen (≤ -15 °C for Platinum Path purified samples, ≤ -
70°C for MagNA Pure purified samples) for up to thirty days prior to testing without
compromising the results.
Reconstituted Reagent Storage Conditions Test Results
All but one of the positive samples tested positive at both the initial time point and after
four hours of refrigeration. The mean Cp values for the stored reactions were all within 3
cycles of the initial time point suggesting no decrease in assay performance with storage.
In addition, the mean F values for the stored reagents were never less than 50% of the
max
F of the initial baseline indicating no reduction of test system performance. All
max
negative reactions tested negative at both time points. The mean Cp and F values of
max
the associated Flu SC assays were similar at all both time points.
These results indicate that reconstituted reagents can be stored at 2-8 °C for up to four
hours without compromising the results.
d. Detection limit:
Initial estimates for setting the LoD were performed by spiking simulated NPW (sNPW)
and NPS samples with serial dilutions of quantified representative influenza A or B
viruses (Influenza A H1N1 strain A/New Caledonia/20/1999, Influenza A H3N2 strain
A/New York/55/2004, Influenza A 2009 H1N1 strain A/New York/18/2009, Influenza B
strain B/Ohio/1/2005, and Influenza B strain B/Florida/7/2004). The spiked samples were
then processed using the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit and the Roche
MagNA Pure Compact Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I, and the purified samples were tested
with the associated target influenza assays (Flu A or Flu B). An initial estimate of the LoD
was made by evaluating the reaction quality at each dilution. Reactions were evaluated
using multiple criteria, including the JBAIDS test results, the Cp values, and a visual
examination of the amplification curves. LoD estimates were then further evaluated by
testing human-derived or simulated samples spiked with refined serial dilutions of the
representative influenza viruses.
23

--- Page 24 ---
Once the LoD was estimated, a set of 20 specimens was collected from 20 unique donors
for each combination of specimen type (NPS or NPW) and purification kit (Platinum Path
or MagNA Pure). The samples were spiked at the estimated LoD level, processed, and
tested with the JBAIDS Flu A or Flu B assay to determine the frequency of positive
results. The LoD was confirmed if at least 19 of the 20 samples gave a positive test result.
The LoD levels for the Flu A assay were independently established using three influenza
A subtype viruses (Influenza A H1N1, A H3N2, and A 2009 H1N1). The LoD levels for
the Flu B assay were independently established using two representative influenza B virus
strains.
Based on the titration results for each strain, the LoD levels were set at the concentrations
for which ≥95% detection was observed for both sample types and both nucleic acid
purification kits. All sets of 20 samples spiked with influenza A and B viruses gave at
least 19/20 positive results with the JBAIDS Flu A or Flu B assay. The LoD for the Flu A
assay is 50 EID /mL for the seasonal Influenza A H1N1 strain A/New Caledonia/20/1999,
50
5 EID /mL for the Influenza A H3N2 strain A/New York/55/2004, and 50 EID /mL for
50 50
the Influenza A 2009 H1N1 strain A/New York/18/2009. The LoD for the Flu B assay is 5
EID /mL for the Influenza B strain B/Ohio/1/2005, and 10 EID /mL for the Influenza B
50 50
strain B/Florida/7/2004

e. Analytical Reactivity:
For inclusivity testing, sNPS samples were spiked with various strains of influenza target
viruses within the A and B genera prior to purification with the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path
Sample Purification Kit and testing with the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit.
Viruses were spiked at concentrations estimated to be near the LoD of each analyte. Due
to differences in quantification methods between primary strains (quantified in EID /mL)
50
and analytical reactivity panel strains (mostly quantified in TCID /mL), concentrations
50
spanning the primary strain LoD (0.1×, 1×, 10×LoD, assuming 1 EID was equivalent to
50
1 TCID ) were tested. If a sample containing a particular strain was positive at any of the
50
concentrations, no further testing of that strain was required. If a strain was not detected
at any of these concentrations, the strain was retested in 10-fold higher increments until a
positive result was obtained or until the maximum concentration possible for that strain
stock had been tested.
The following two tables provide a complete listing of the Influenza A and B strains that
were used to assess the analytical reactivity or inclusivity of the test system. The 25
Influenza A strains tested were representative of strains isolated from different hosts and
locations around the world as early as 77 years ago (1933) and as recently as 2009. The 9
influenza B strains were isolated from locations around the world as early as 71 years ago
and as recently as 2006.

The JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit correctly identified all 25 Influenza A
strains and 9 Influenza B strains included in the inclusivity panels. The lowest
concentration detected ranged from 0.5 TCID /mL to 5,000 TCID /mL for the Influenza
50 50
A assay and 0.5 TCID /mL to 50 TCID /mL for Influenza B. Variation in the lowest
50 50
concentration detected may be due to sequence variation. However an in silico
investigation of available sequences did not identify any significant mismatches with the
assays primers or probes. Another possible cause for the variation is differences in the
quantification method of the virus. Quantification using EID or TICD measures the
50 50
infectivity and cytotoxicity or lethality of an organism in tissue culture and is therefore
subject to many influences (strain-to-strain differences in infectivity, viability of the
original material, culturing conditions, etc.). Quantification by infectivity assay will not
be equivalent between strains or organisms. Also, since the measurand for the JBAIDS
assays is starting amount of target nucleic acid, nucleic acid concentrations established in
EID or TCID can vary dramatically between organism stocks, but may not actually
50 50
reflect significant differences in sensitivity of detection by target nucleic acid
concentration.

f. Analytical Specificity/Cross-reactivity Evaluation:
Analytical Specificity (Exclusivity) testing involved the following organisms: 1) Non-
target influenza types (those not specific to the type assay); 2) Non-influenza viruses; and
3) Other closely related organisms that colonize the upper respiratory tract, cause
respiratory symptoms, are common skin flora or laboratory contaminants, or are
microorganisms for which much of the population may have been infected.
Each organism was spiked at a high level (when possible, viruses were spiked at 105×
provided stock units, and other organisms were spiked at 106× provided stock units;
otherwise organisms were spiked at the highest allowable concentration) into a simulated
NPS (sNPS) sample prior to extraction using the Roche MagNA Pure Nucleic Acid
Isolation Kit I and testing with the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit.
The following 3 tables provide the exclusivity panels that were used to evaluate the test
system analytical specificity or exclusivity:

g. Assay cut-off:
Each JBAIDS test is analyzed with the data analysis software module called Detector.
The module determines the outcome of the tests conducted on the samples. The module
first analyzes the data from each capillary independently. Then the replicates of the
samples are analyzed together (if applicable). Finally the module interprets the outcome
of these analyses for the sample and its controls.
The analysis module algorithm consists of two parts. The first identifies samples that are
obviously positive or negative (Obvious Tests), and second that computes a refined
estimate of the samples status when the sample is not called an obvious positive or
obvious negative (Expert Test).The algorithms are based on an Expert System approach
to determining positive and negative samples, and is deterministic meaning that every
sample will have the same outcome every time the algorithm evaluates the sample. The
purpose of Obvious Tests is to call those samples that are clearly positive or negative. In
this way, only non-obvious samples will need to be processed by the more
computationally involved detector algorithms. Obvious tests produce internal scores and
compare them against fixed thresholds to return a positive/negative/uncertain call. Expert
Tests algorithm is based on mathematically modeling the expected shapes of the
amplification curves of positive and negative samples. The model itself is based on tests
for nine distinct characteristics in the amplification curves and it assigns nine test scores
to each curve. After the tests are scored, the amplification curve is scored as a weighted
sum of the tests.
Thresholds for the Obvious Tests and weights in the Expert Tests for Detector were
determined using training data sets and numerical optimization to pick parameters that
ensure Detector minimizes the number of error observed in real-world data.
Validation data from JBAIDS Customer Validation Testing, and Dugway Operational
Assessment were gathered and evaluated with Detector to validate the analysis module
algorithm. These data contain samples from five separate data sets: typical data, atypical
data, negative dominated, RNA data and Dugway field data. The data were gathered
from varied sources, including a variety of assays, instruments and users, to obtain

examples of all possible JBAIDS data. There are 28,467 samples in the data sets. 99.6%
of the samples were correctly called by the Detector. 0.19% of the samples were called
“Uncertain” and 0.21% of the samples were incorrectly called.
h. Interfering Substances:
An interfering substances study was carried out to examine whether a panel of
endogenous and exogenous potential RT-PCR inhibitors and technique-specific
substances (substances that could be introduced into the PCR reaction as contaminants
during sample purification or during reaction setup) affect the performance of the
JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit. The concentration of substances tested
represented a relevant concentration in accordance with CLSI EP7-A2 Interference
Testing in Clinical Chemistry Approved Guideline, or for test substances not listed in the
CLSI document, concentrations were determined by evaluating the scientific literature or
references from other IVD package inserts. For each endogenous, exogenous and
technique specific test substance, one sNPW specimen containing a representative
Influenza A or Influenza B virus (A/New Caledonia/20/1999 or B/Ohio/1/2005) at a
concentration equivalent to 5×LoD was spiked with the appropriate amount of test
substance.
Note: sNPW specimens spiked with the representative Influenza B virus (B/Ohio/1/2005)
were also co-spiked with a representative seasonal influenza A H3N2 virus strain
(A/New York/55/2004) for more efficient interfering substances testing of the JBAIDS
Influenza A Subtyping Kit. Refer to the “Co-spiking Specimen Validation” section for
details demonstrating that combining these two viruses in a sample, even at high
concentrations, had no detrimental effect on the detection of either virus
In each round of purifications, an influenza-containing sNPW sample that had not been
spiked with the interfering substance was also included. This sample served as a control
to which the other specimens were compared. All specimens, except those containing
Roche MagNA Pure Compact Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I technique specific substances
(i.e., MagNA Pure buffers), were purified using the Roche MagNA Pure Compact
Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I on the Roche MagNA Pure Compact System. Each purified
sample was tested with the influenza assay (Flu A or Flu B) corresponding to the virus
with which it was spiked, and also tested with the Flu SC assay. The Roche MagNA
Pure Compact Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I technique-specific substances that could be
introduced during sample purification (i.e., MagNA Pure buffers) were added to the
purified samples immediately prior to influenza assay reaction setup. Substances were
considered to be potential inhibitors if the results for the tested assays were negative.
Note: Only sNPW samples purified using the Roche MagNA Pure Compact Nucleic
Acid Isolation Kit I on the Roche MagNA Pure Compact System were evaluated. NPS
samples purified with the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit were
previously evaluated with the FDA cleared JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage)
Detection System (k100287). The Platinum Path kit was shown to remove both
endogenous and exogenous substances from NPS and throat swab samples. In addition,
the wash and elution buffers contained in the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path Sample
Purification Kit (technique-specific substances) did not interfere with detection of the

Of all of the endogenous and exogenous substances tested, only snuff (nasal tobacco)
has the potential to cause inaccurate negative test results due to inhibition. Of the
technique- specific substances tested, improper introduction of contents from four of
the MagNA Pure reagent cartridge wells to purified samples have the potential to cause
inaccurate negative test results due to inhibition:
• MagNA Pure Proteinase K Solution (well 1)
• MagNA Pure Lysis Solution (well 2)
• MagNA Pure Magnetic Glass Particles (well 3)
• MagNA Pure Wash Buffer I (well 4)
These substances, along with ethanol, bleach, and DNAZap™, which are known PCR
inhibitors, are included in the package insert as potentially interfering substances.
In addition, the study also demonstrated that the JBAIDS influenza A and B assays
react with the viral material contained in the 2009-2010 version of the FluMist
intranasal influenza vaccine (MedImmune). When NPS and NPW specimens are
collected from individuals who have recently received a dose of the nasal vaccine, the
Flu A and Flu B assays may react with the vaccine material to give inaccurate positive
results.
Note: The material being tested (FluMist® Influenza Vaccine Live, Intranasal;
Intranasal Spray, 2009-2010 Formula) was provided by the manufacturer (MedImmune)
in individual sprayers, each containing a single 0.2 mL dose. Each dose contained
approximately 106.5-7.5 FFU (fluorescence focus units) each of three live, attenuated
influenza virus reassortants including:
• A/South Dakota/6/2007 (H1N1) (A/Brisbane/59/2007-like)
• A/Uruguay/716/2007 (H3N2) (A/Brisbane/10/2007-like)
• B/Brisbane/60/2008.
Non-viral components of the vaccine listed in the provided materials include:
monosodium glutamate, gelatin, arginine, sucrose, gentamicin sulfate, monobasic
potassium phosphate and dibasic potassium phosphate.

i. Carry-Over Contamination:
An analytical study was carried out to evaluate the frequency of carryover in the
JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit when it is used as instructed by the product
insert. Significant levels of carryover will result in false positive test results for
negative samples that are contaminated by adjacent positive samples. For the JBAIDS
Influenza A & B Detection Kit, carryover could occur during sample purification or
reagent setup.
To assess the potential for carryover, sample sets consisting of negative and high
positive samples were processed in an alternating pattern using the Roche MagNA Pure
Compact Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I on the Roche MagNA Pure Compact system and
then tested with the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit.
Note: The potential for carryover in samples purified with the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path
Purification Kit was previously evaluated with JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage)
Detection Kit (k100287) and demonstrated that significant levels of carryover do not
occur when samples are processed and tested according to the instructions in the
package insert.
Positive sNPS samples were spiked with Influenza A H3N2 strain A/New
York/55/2004 at approximately 2000× LoD (~1.0 × 104 EID /mL). Five independent
50
sample sets were tested for a total of 20 positive and 20 negative samples. Positive and
negative samples were purified in an alternating pattern, and the PCR reactions for the
positive and negative samples were set up in the order in which the samples were
processed. The frequency of false positive and uncertain results for the negative
samples was evaluated using the Flu A assay as the representative assay from the
JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit.
All positive samples resulted in early Flu A assay Cp values (< 24.00 cycles) and robust
F values (> 19.00). All negative samples produced negative results, with no
max
detectable Cp values. No carryover was observed in this evaluation. The test results are
shown in the following table:

Overall, sample purification and reaction setup in this carryover study resulted in no
false positive results when samples were processed in accordance with the purification
kit and reaction setup directions. PCR is a very sensitive technique and false positives
caused by contamination are a recognized risk. Users are reminded in the product
package insert that failure to follow protocol and improper technique may result in false
positive results.
j. Validation of Simulated Sample Matrices
Nasopharyngeal wash (NPW) and nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens are the two
sample matrices evaluated with the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit and used
for most of the non-clinical evaluations. However, given the need for large numbers of
individual samples without influenza virus, simulated NPS (sNPS) and simulated NPW
(sNPW) samples were developed and validated to prevent inaccurate test results arising
from the presence of influenza viruses in human derived nasopharyngeal specimens.
Simulated samples were comprised of human HeLa cells diluted to concentrations in
viral transport medium (VTM) that produced similar Cp values as the Flu SC assay
produced when testing human derived NPS and NPW samples.
HeLa cell concentrations of 103.2 cells/mL and 104.3 cells/mL for sNPW and sNPS
sample matrix types, respectively, resulted in similar Cp values for the Flu SC assay as
human derived NPW and NPS specimens. To confirm that the simulated sample matrix
types did not have any advantageous or detrimental effects on the performance of the
system, multiple aliquots of simulated and human derived samples were spiked at the
LoD with a representative seasonal influenza A virus (H3N2 strain A/New York/55/2004)
and tested with the applicable influenza and control assays (Flu A, Flu A H3, and Flu
SC). Simulated and human derived samples exhibited equivalent rates of detection.
Mean Cp and F values were also comparable between the human derived and
max
simulated samples.
k. Co-spiked Specimen Validation
For efficient use of resources during non-clinical testing of the JBAIDS Influenza A &
B Detection and Influenza A Subtyping Kits, Influenza A H3N2 and Influenza B
viruses were co-spiked in some studies. Specifically, co-spiked samples were used in
the following analytic evaluations: Reproducibility, Sample Transport and Storage, and
Interfering Substances.

An analytical study was carried out to validate the use of specimens co-spiked with
Influenza A H3N2 and Influenza B viruses. This study was performed by evaluating
single-spiked and co-spiked samples containing Influenza A H3N2 A/New
York/55/2004 and/or Influenza B B/Ohio/01/2005. NPW specimens purified with the
Platinum Path kit were evaluated in this study because the Cp values for the Flu A
assay in NPW samples, purified with Platinum Path kit, were greater than Cp values for
the other sample type/purification kit combinations. The first part of this study
evaluated freshly collected NPW samples spiked with an influenza A H3N2 virus at
LoD only (single spike) or additionally spiked with influenza B virus at 500×LoD (co-
spiked). The second part of this study evaluated the opposite, NPW samples spiked
with influenza B virus at 1×LoD (single spike) or further spiked with influenza A
H3N2 at 500×LoD (co-spiked).
For each part of the study, 60 single and 60 co-spiked samples were prepared and
evaluated. In particular, pooled NPW samples were spiked with virus at 1×LoD. Half of
this pool was co-spiked with the alternate virus at 500×LoD, resulting in one single
spiked pool and one co-spiked pool. Following spiking, the samples were purified using
the Platinum Path kit and then tested with appropriate freeze-dried reagent test assays
(Flu A, Flu B, and Flu A H3). A total of 240 samples were evaluated.
For the samples spiked with influenza B at 1×LoD, all single (60) and co-spiked (60)
samples were detected with the Flu B assay. In addition, the influenza A H3N2 virus at
500×LoD was detected in 60/60 samples by the Flu A and Flu A H3 assays. These
results demonstrate that 100% detection was achieved for single (influenza B at 1×LoD)
and co- spiked (influenza B at 1×LoD/ influenza A H3N2 at 500×LoD) samples. For
the Flu A assay, samples spiked with influenza A H3N2 at 1×LoD were detected in
59/60 single- spiked and 58/60 co-spiked samples, resulting in 98.3 and 96.7%
detection rates, respectively. For the Flu A H3 assay the same samples were positive for
60/60 single- spiked and 59/60 co-spiked samples, resulting in 100 and 98.3% detection
rates, respectively. In addition, the influenza B virus at 500×LoD was detected in 60/60
samples by the Flu B assay.
Differences in mean Cp values between single- and co-spiked samples did not vary by
more than 0.19 cycles for the three assays, and mean F values for co-spiked samples
max
were reduced by less than 5% from mean F values for single-spiked samples. The
max
quantitative differences in mean Cp and F values between single- and co-spiked
max
samples were lower than the standard deviations for each assay and spike set.
The study results demonstrate that there is no significant quantitative or qualitative
difference between specimens single spiked or co-spiked with influenza B and
influenza A H3N2 viruses.
l. Fresh vs. Frozen Specimen Study
The JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit includes assays for the detection of
Influenza A and B viruses in NPS and NPW specimens collected from individuals
exhibiting influenza-like-illness. A prospective clinical evaluation of this test kit was
performed in order to establish the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the assays
36

--- Page 37 ---
contained in the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit. The prospective clinical
evaluation was performed from December 2010 through April 2011 at five
geographically diverse locations. During this study, sufficient positive and negative
samples were obtained to establish the clinical sensitivity and specificity for detection
of Influenza A 2009 H1N1 and Influenza A/H3 viruses. However, seasonal Influenza
A/H1 did not circulate during the trial period. In addition, it was unclear if sufficient
influenza B positive samples would be obtained to establish the performance of the
Influenza B assay, especially when testing NPS samples.
To account for the possibility that frozen archived samples might be required to
supplement the prospective clinical trial data, an analytical study was performed to
establish that the results obtained with frozen samples are equivalent to those obtained
when testing freshly collected NPS or NPW samples.
Pools of freshly collected NPS and NPW specimens were spiked at 100×LoD, 10×LoD,
3×LoD, and 1×LoD with a representative Influenza A/ H1 virus strain (A/New
Caledonia/20/1999) or Influenza B virus strain (B/Ohio/1/2005). The spiked pools were
then aliquoted. Samples that were to be tested after freezing were aliquoted from each
pool and stored at -80°C for at least 24 hours. The remainder of each pool was
aliquoted for immediate analysis. Testing of sample sets consisted of purifying
individual aliquots with either the Platinum Path or the MagNA Pure kits and assaying
with the Flu A or Flu B assays. The following table lists the number of samples tested
at each virus concentration:

Successful validation of frozen samples required that the JBAIDS test results were
equivalent to the results obtained when testing freshly collected samples. Frozen
samples were considered acceptable to use in the clinical evaluation if the JBAIDS
results are at least 90% in agreement between fresh and frozen samples with a lower
95% CI bound of 86%. If this statistical confidence was not reached with 60 samples,
additional samples were evaluated. For informational purposes only, the crossing point
(Cp) and relative maximum fluorescence (F ) values were evaluated for the fresh and
max
frozen samples. Ideally the Cp values should not vary by more than 3 cycles and the
F values should not be more than 50% different between the two data sets. The 3
max
cycle Cp and 50% F differences allow for intrinsic system variability in JBAIDS
max
Influenza A & B Detection Kit. If the observed Cp and F differences were greater
max
than these, the data were reviewed to determine if using frozen samples interferes with

detection.
For the Flu A assay, JBAIDS test results for fresh and frozen spiked NPS samples were
in 100% agreement (95% CI 96-100%). Fresh and frozen NPW samples also exhibited
100% agreement (95% CI 96-100%) for all virus spike levels. The acceptance criteria
were met for the equivalence of fresh and frozen sample sets. The Cp and F values
max
were also compared between fresh and frozen influenza A spiked NPS and NPW
samples, and they were within the Cp and F ranges outlined in the acceptance
max
criteria. Differences in Cp values for fresh and frozen samples ranged from 0.56 Cps
earlier to 0.69 Cps later for the Flu A assay with Platinum Path-purified samples and
0.45 Cps earlier to 0.73 Cps later with MagNA Pure-purified samples. F values for
max
frozen, Platinum Path purified samples were 4 to 44% greater than fresh samples. F
max
values for frozen MagNA Pure- purified samples were 17% less to 22% greater than
fresh samples.
The Flu B assay results for fresh and frozen spiked NPS samples were in 100%
agreement (95% CI 96-100%) for all virus spike levels. The acceptance criteria were
met for the equivalent fresh and frozen sample sets. The Cp and F values were also
max
compared between fresh and frozen NPS samples, and they were within the Cp and F
max
ranges outlined in the acceptance criteria. Differences in Cp values for fresh and frozen
samples ranged from 0.31 Cps earlier to 0.01 Cps later for the Flu B assay with
Platinum Path purified samples and 0.14 Cps earlier to 0.14 Cps later for MagNA Pure
purified samples. F values for frozen, Platinum Path purified samples were 17% less
max
to 13% greater than fresh samples. F values for frozen, MagNA Pure purified
max
samples were 8% less to 6% greater than fresh samples.
Note: When this study was initiated there were preliminary data from the clinical trial
sites to suggest that Influenza B positive NPW samples would be sufficiently
represented. Therefore, only Influenza B NPS spiked samples were examined to
prepare for the possibility that this sample type would be underrepresented.
The results of the fresh vs. frozen study demonstrated that there are no significant
qualitative or quantitative differences between JBAIDS test results for fresh or frozen
samples spiked with Influenza A and B viruses. All acceptance criteria were met for
this study. Accurate test results were obtained from fresh samples as well as samples
that had been subjected to a freeze-thaw cycle.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Prospective Clinical study
The clinical performance of the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit Assay was
established during prospective studies at 5 geographically separated clinical study sites
in the U.S. The study sites were located in the West (Fairfield, CA, and San Diego, CA),
the Southwest (San Antonio, TX), the Midwest (Dayton, OH), and the Southeast
(Fayetteville, NC). NP swab or wash samples were collected and tested during the
2010/2011 influenza season (December 2010 to April 2011). Subjects with signs and
symptoms of influenza-like illness were invited to participate. Upon obtaining informed
consent, an NPW or NPS specimen was collected for JBAIDS and comparator assay
testing.
Written informed consent (or assent, if appropriate) was acquired from each subject
and/or their parent/guardian (if under 18) at the time of enrollment into the study. After
informed consent was acquired, the subject was assigned a Volunteer Identification
Number (VIN). The VIN was used to de-identify the specimen used for JBAIDS testing
and to provide data to the sponsor.
Patient specimens were divided into single use aliquots for testing immediately after
collection. Typically, one sample aliquot was placed at 4°C to be purified within one
day and tested using the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit. Specimens collected
on Fridays were placed at < -15°C over the weekend and thawed for testing on Monday.
Aliquots for comparator testing were placed at < -15°C and sent to Idaho Technology,
Inc., on a weekly basis. Once received at Idaho Technology, the samples were placed at
< -70ºC until they were tested using the comparator assays.
Patient samples were purified using either the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path Purification Kit
(3 testing sites), or the Roche MagNA Pure Compact Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I in
conjunction with the Roche MagNA Pure Compact system (4 testing sites), and tested
with the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit.
Comparator PCR testing using the CDC rRT- PCR Flu Panel assays was performed by
ITI research associates in a blinded manner (i.e., specimens were labeled only with the
subject’s VIN and the JBAIDS test results were not available to them. Specimen testing
with the CDC rRT- PCR Flu Panel assays was performed in accordance with the
package insert.
A total of 231 runs were performed during the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit
prospective clinical trial and 226 (97.8%) JBAIDS runs were completed successfully.
Two runs (0.9%) that failed to complete were due to a software defect. Three (1.3%)
additional runs that failed to complete were due to run controls (NCs and or PCs)
failure. The first failure was a result of switching the positions of the NC and PC
reactions for both the Flu A and Flu B assays when loading the capillaries into the
JBAIDS carousel. The second failure occurred because the PC reactions for both the
Flu A and Flu B assays failed to amplify. The third failure occurred due to an
improperly seated carousel causing the amplification curves to be interpreted as
negative.
39

--- Page 40 ---
During the prospective clinical study, Positive and Negative nucleic acid extraction
controls (PEC and NEC, respectively) were processed with each batch of purification
specimens to ensure that the purification process was effectively performed. The PEC
was considered successful when all tested target assays were positive. A failed PEC
was retested using the same purified sample and the results of the retest were accepted
as the final result. If the retest was unsuccessful, all associated samples were considered
to have invalid results and required re-purification in order to obtain a valid test result.
During the clinical evaluation, 4 out of a total of 190 PECs (2.11%) required retesting
(3 at site 1 and 1 at site 2). All 4 PEC samples were successful upon retesting.
A total of 833 subjects were enrolled in the prospective study initially. Eighteen (18)
(2.2%) subjects withdrew or were withdrawn from the study for various reasons,
including discrepancy in consent documents (n=7), patient refusing sample collection
or withdrawal from study (n=7), or improper specimen collection (n=4). Five (5) (0.6%)
specimens were withdrawn from the study due to invalid testing results from the
comparator assay. Four (4) specimens were withdrawn due to a contamination event at
one of the testing sites. An additional 2 specimens were excluded from demographic
and clinical performance analyses due to repeated JBAIDS sample control failures. The
remaining 804 subjects (490 NPW specimens and 314 NPS specimens) were included
in the demographic and clinical performance analyses.
Of the 804 prospective specimens that were included in the clinical performance
analyses, 97% (778/804) of these specimens were successful on the first attempt (Site 1:
356/376 =95%; Site 2: 203/207 =98%; Site 3: 56/56 =100%; Site 4: 118/119 =99%;
Site 5: 45/46 =98%). The remaining 3% (26/804) required retesting: “Invalid”(16/26),
“Uncertain”(0/26), “SC Failure”(5/26), positive for both the Flu A and Flu B assays
(2/26), or were re-extracted and retested due to user labeling error (3/26) (20 samples
from Site 1; 4 samples from Site 2; 0 samples from Site 3; 1 sample from Site 4; and 1
sample from Site 5). All 26 samples were resolved upon a subsequent retest.

b. Retrospective Clinical study
The seasonal Influenza A/H1 virus was not circulating during the 2010-2011 influenza
season (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/) and was not detected during the prospective clinical
evaluation of the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit. Therefore, performance of
the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit testing seasonal Influenza A/H1 could not
be established during the prospective clinical study. A retrospective clinical study was
carried out at two different clinical sites to supplement the prospective evaluation data
by analyzing pre-selected, archived specimens that were known to be positive for
seasonal Influenza A/H1. Specimens were evaluated using both the Platinum Path and
MagNA Pure nucleic acid purification kits.
A total of 56 NPS specimens were received for testing in this study. Thirty- five (35) of
the specimens had previously tested positive for seasonal Influenza A/H1. These
specimens were obtained from the CDC and were originally collected from medical
facilities and reference laboratories where they were previously tested by CDC and
FDA-cleared laboratory methods and found to contain seasonal Influenza A/H1. No
demographic information was available for these specimens. Specimens may have
experienced as many as three freeze/thaw cycles prior to this study. The specimens
were selected only for their previous test result; there was no effort to choose specimens
with specific analyte levels. An additional 21 Influenza A negative NPS specimens
from patients with respiratory illness, but known to be negative for influenza, were
obtained from ARUP Laboratories. Upon arrival at ITI, a 4-digit study number (VIN)
was assigned to each sample and a key was created in order to randomize the specimens
such that the users testing the samples were blinded as to the expected test result.
Specimens were divided approximately evenly for testing between both purification
kits.
Because it is possible that the provided samples had been misidentified or had degraded
during storage or previous handling, the presence or absence of the expected analyte
was confirmed using “validation” PCR assays. The validation PCR assays were
identical to the comparator assays that were used for the prospective clinical evaluation
study. Briefly, specimens were first evaluated with the CDC Human Influenza Virus
Real-time RT-PCR Detection and Characterization Panel (rRT-PCR Flu Panel) for
Influenza A and B. Specimens positive for Influenza A were then subject to additional
subtype-specific PCR, in this case using the comparator validation assay used for the
prospective clinical evaluation of the JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit, an assay

specifically designed to detect seasonal Influenza A/H1. Positive PCR reactions for the
seasonal Influenza A/H1 comparator validation assay were analyzed using bi-
directional sequencing for definitive confirmation. If this validation testing did not
confirm the presence or absence of the expected organism in the sample, the sample
was not analyzed further as this result may have reflected that the sample had been
improperly labeled or handled. Validation assay operators were blinded as to the
expected result for each sample. Validated specimens with confirmed identities were
then tested. Specimens were purified using either the Platinum Path or MagNA Pure
sample purification kits then analyzed with the JBAIDS. The Influenza A (Flu A) assay
from the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit was run in a Custom Test Method
with the influenza sample control assay (Flu SC) assay.
Validation testing confirmed all 21 influenza-negative specimens and 30 of the 35
seasonal Influenza A/H1 samples. Validation PCR testing revealed that Ct values
ranged from 19.2 to 32.0 (median 25.1) out of 45 cycles, demonstrating that the
specimen population contained a diverse level of analyte. Half of the samples were
extracted using the Platinum Path purification kit and half using MagNA pure.
The following table presents the PPA and NPA for the archived clinical specimens.
Data from both extraction kits are combined due to identical performance.

c. Surrogate Clinical Specimen Testing for Seasonal Influenza A/H1
The seasonal Influenza A/H1 virus was not circulating during the 2010-2011 influenza
season (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/) and was not detected during the prospective clinical
evaluation of the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit. In addition, archived clinical
NPW samples that had previously tested positive for the seasonal Influenza A/H1 virus
were not available. Therefore, a clinical study to evaluate the performance of the
JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit was supplemented using residual clinical NPS
and NPW specimens spiked with a seasonal Influenza A H1N1 strain.
One hundred thirty-six (136) surrogate seasonal Influenza A H1N1 NPS and NPW
clinical specimens (68 of each specimen type) were prepared using residual influenza-
negative specimens that were collected during the prospective clinical trial of the
JBAIDS influenza kits. These specimens had been previously evaluated with both the
JBAIDS as well as comparator assays and shown to be influenza- negative. Residual
specimens were spiked at ITI with a representative seasonal influenza A H1N1 (A/New
Caledonia/20/1999) strain as follows:

A study number (VIN) was assigned to each sample and a key was created in order to
randomize the samples such that the users testing the samples were blinded as to the
expected test result. Frozen samples were then sent to two clinical trial sites for testing.
Samples were purified using either the Platinum Path or MagNA Pure sample
purification kits, and then analyzed with the JBAIDS Flu A, Flu B, and Flu SC assays.
Valid JBAIDS Flu A results were obtained for 62 NPW samples. Valid results were not
obtained for 6 samples: five (5) of the invalid results were due to a Flu A NC failure,
and one (1) was due to a Flu SC failure and could not be retested due to limited sample
volume. These 6 NPW samples were excluded from the performance calculation. Valid
JBAIDS Flu B results were obtained for 67 NPW samples. One (1) sample had a result
of SC Failure and could not be retested due to limited sample volume, and was
excluded from the performance calculation.
Valid JBAIDS Flu A results were obtained for 66 NPS samples. Valid results were not
obtained for two (2) NPS samples due to insufficient volume for retesting (one spiked
and one un-spiked sample. These two (2) NPS samples were excluded from the
performance calculation. Valid JBAIDS Flu B results were obtained for 65 NPS
samples. Three (3) NPS samples had a result of SC Failure and could not be retested
due to limited sample volume, and were excluded from the performance calculation.
The following table presents the PPA and NPA for the surrogate clinical specimens.
Half of the samples were extracted using the Platinum Path purification kit and half
using the MagNA pure kit.

N. Instrument Name:
Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) Instrument.
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The JBAIDS Instrument is used to perform real time reverse transcription, PCR
amplification and detection of nucleic acid. Three other nucleic acid amplification tests
that use the JBAIDS Instrument have received 510(k) clearance: JBAIDS Anthrax
Detection System (k051713), JBAIDS Plague Detection System (k072631), JBAIDS
Tularemia Detection System (k072547), JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian Lineage)
Detection Kit (k100287), and JBAIDS Q Fever Detection System (k103207). The
JBAIDS Instrument is a ruggedized, portable real-time PCR instrument designed to
withstand the conditions of transport and use likely to be encountered in a military field
laboratory. The instrument is comprised of an air thermocycler that amplifies specific
DNA sequences using PCR and a fluorimeter that measures fluorescence signals
associated with production of PCR product (amplicon) during the course of the reaction.
For thermocycling, samples contained in glass capillaries are placed in the sample
chamber where they are heated and cooled by the JBAIDS instrument.
The JBAIDS Software is preloaded on a ruggedized laptop computer. The software
controls the instrument’s thermal cycling functions, acquires the fluorescence data from
the instrument, and displays the fluorescence data for the user during the run. When the
run is finished, the software’s Detector module analyzes the data and displays test
results. The instrument and software have the ability to perform either diagnostic (IVD)
or surveillance (environmental) testing.
The IVD software includes the following diagnostic components:
• A traceable database that limits the data that the user can change in a test run and
that requires the user to enter change notes for any changes that are allowed.
• A Diagnostic Wizard that guides the operator through the process of setting up the
JBAIDS run in compliance with the package insert. IVD testing is always
performed using the Diagnostic Wizard and the traceable database. The wizard
initially presents to the operator a predefined selection of FDA cleared JBAIDS
IVD assays. JBAIDS assays under evaluation for FDA clearance are also available
in limited release software. Once the user has selected the IVD assays to test, the
Wizard guides the user through the process of setting up and loading each PCR
reaction into the instrument. The wizard requires each run to contain a Positive
Control and a Negative Control for each target included in the run as well as the
inclusion of additional controls (e.g., inhibition controls, sample controls), when
they are required.
• A Detector module that automatically analyzes the fluorescence amplification
curves and displays the final test results to the user. The Detector module ensures
that the correct rules are applied both to the interpretation of each amplification
46

curve and to the final interpretation (e.g., metacall), based on the results of the
samples and the relevant controls.
• A report certification that reflects the current regulatory status of the test being
performed. When an assay is being evaluated for FDA clearance, the JBAIDS test
report includes the statement ‘For Investigational Use Only. The performance
characteristics of this product have not been established.’ Once the assay has
received FDA clearance, the software is modified and the report certification
statement becomes ‘For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only’.

6. Quality Control:
The following controls are included in the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit:
Negative Control
The NC is used to detect contamination from target-specific amplified product
(amplicon), synthetic RNA (as found in the PC vials), or virus. The NC vial is
reconstituted using the purified negative extraction control (NEC) (molecular biology
grade water). The NEC should be processed along with each batch of specimens
purified. The NC detects possible contamination during sample purification and during
reconstitution of freeze- dried reagents. Each JBAIDS run requires one NC for the Flu
A assay and one NC for the Flu B assay. For each target assay, the NC must be negative,
or the JBAIDS software will assign invalid results for that target assay to all of the
samples in that run. If the NC fails, the JBAIDS run must be repeated using the same
purified samples. If the NC fails again, all associated samples are considered to have
invalid results and should be re-purified starting from another aliquot of the original
specimens.

Positive Control
The PC serves as an amplification and detection control. Each JBAIDS run requires one
PC for the Flu A assay and one PC for the Flu B assay. For each target assay, the PC
must be positive. If the PC fails, the JBAIDS software will assign invalid results for
that target assay to all of the associated samples, and the JBAIDS run must be repeated
starting from the same purified specimens. Failure of the PCs may indicate errors in
sample setup, degradation of the reagents, or a malfunction of the JBAIDS instrument.
Sample Control (SC)
The sample control assay (Flu SC) detects the human RNase P gene. This assay is
designed to guard against false negative results caused by an improperly collected
specimen, ineffective purification of nucleic acids and or inhibition of the PCR reaction.
A properly collected NPS or NPW specimen contains human cells from which the
RNase P target is recovered during sample purification. Following purification, each
sample is then tested with the Flu A and Flu B target assays, as well as the Flu SC. If
purification and amplification were successful, then the Flu SC will give the expected
positive test result. The JBAIDS software automatically assigns a result of sample
control failure when (1) the Flu SC is unsuccessful and (2) the target assay is negative
(or uncertain).
