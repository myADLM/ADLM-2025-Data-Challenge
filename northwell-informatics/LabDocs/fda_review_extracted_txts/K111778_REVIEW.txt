H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use:
The Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) Influenza
A Subtyping Kit is intended for the in vitro qualitative detection and differentiation of
seasonal Influenza A/H1, seasonal Influenza A/H3, and 2009 H1N1 Influenza viral
nucleic acids isolated and purified from nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and
nasopharyngeal wash (NPW) specimens from human patients with signs and
symptoms of respiratory infection, in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological
risk factors. The JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit contains reverse transcriptase
real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays for use on the JBAIDS
instruments. The Flu A H1, Flu A H3, and Flu A H1 2009 assays of the JBAIDS
Influenza A Subtyping Kit target a region of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of the
respective Influenza A virus. The Flu A Sw assay of the JBAIDS Influenza A
Subtyping Kit targets a region of the nucleocapsid protein (NP) gene of the 2009
H1N1 Influenza virus, as well as some other Influenza A viruses of swine lineage.
This kit is not intended to detect Influenza B or Influenza C Viruses.
A negative result for all assays in the JBAIDS Influenza A subtyping kit is a
presumptive negative result for Influenza A. These results should be confirmed using
the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit.
Test results are to be used in conjunction with other clinical and epidemiological
information. Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not
be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.
Due to low seasonal prevalence, performance characteristics for detection of seasonal
Influenza A/H1 were established primarily with retrospective and contrived clinical
specimens.
All users, analysts, and any person reporting diagnostic results from use of this kit
should be trained to perform and interpret the results from this procedure by JBAIDS
instructors or designees prior to use. Use of this device is limited to designated
Department of Defense (DoD) laboratories equipped with the JBAIDS instruments.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities,
specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel
virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health departments for testing. Viral
culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a biosafety laboratory (BSL) 3+
facility is available to receive and culture specimens.
2. Indication for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only

4. Special instrument requirements:
Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) Instrument
I. Device Description:
The JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit is a real time RT-PCR assay based on the
influenza A subtyping assays that are part of the “CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-
time RT-PCR Detection and Characterization Panel (rRT-PCR Flu Panel)” and the
“CDC Influenza 2009 A (H1N1)pdm Real-Time RT-PCR Panel”. These assays have
been re-optimized to work with Idaho Technology’s proprietary freeze-dried PCR
reagent formulation. Purified patient samples (using either the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path
Purification Kit, or the Roche MagNA Pure Compact Nucleic Acid
Isolation Kit I in conjunction with the Roche MagNA Pure Compact system) are used to
reconstitute the freeze-dried reagents which are then tested using the JBAIDS
instrument.
Each JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit contains sufficient reagents for testing six
specimens. There are six vacuum-sealed control pouches of freeze-dried PCR reagents
(8 reagent vials each), six vacuum-sealed sample testing pouches of freeze-dried PCR
reagents (4 reagent vials each), and six pouches containing one tube each of
reconstitution buffer and reagent grade water. Once resuspended, each reagent vial
provides enough material for one reaction.
Each control pouch contains the following eight vials:
• Positive Control (+) vials (Flu A H1, Flu A H3, Flu A H1 2009, and Flu A Sw).
Once reconstituted, each Positive Control vial contains all reagents necessary for
RT-PCR of the appropriate target, including an assay-specific synthetic RNA target.
The Positive Controls are resuspended with 10 μL reconstitution buffer and 10 μL
reagent grade water before testing in parallel with patient specimens. Amplification
in the Positive Control gives assurance that kit reagents are functioning properly
and that the assay setup has been performed correctly. A Positive Control must be
included for each assay in the JBAIDS run.
Ingredients: Each Positive Control vial contains <0.001% DNA polymerase
complex; <0.001% Reverse Transcriptase; <0.001% target-specific forward and
reverse primer; <0.001% target-specific hydrolysis probes; <0.05% dATP, dCTP,
dGTP, dTTP; <0.001% assay-specific synthetic target RNA; bovine serum albumin;
dithiothreitol; RNase inhibitor; and carbohydrate.
• Negative Control (-) vials (Flu A H1, Flu A H3, Flu A H1 2009, and Flu A Sw).
Once reconstituted, each Negative Control vial contains all reagents required to
perform a RT-PCR reaction except the target RNA, and should therefore give
negative results. The Negative Controls are re-suspended with 10 μL reconstitution
buffer and 10 μL nuclease-free water that has been purified with a nucleic acid
purification kit (NEC). The reconstituted negative control is then tested in parallel
with patient specimens to provide assurance that the purification and setup
procedures have been performed without contamination. A Negative Control must
be included for each assay in the JBAIDS run.

Ingredients: Each Negative Control vial contains <0.001% DNA
polymerase complex; <0.001% Reverse Transcriptase; <0.001% target-
specific forward and reverse primer; <0.001% target-specific hydrolysis
probes; <0.05% dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP; bovine serum albumin;
dithiothreitol; RNase inhibitor; and carbohydrate.
Each sample testing pouch contains the following four vials:
• Unknown vials (Flu A H1, Flu A H3, Flu A H1 2009, and Flu A Sw). Once
reconstituted, each Unknown vial contains all reagents necessary for RT-PCR
of the appropriate target, except target template. The Unknown vials are
resuspended with 10 μL reconstitution buffer and 10 μL purified patient
sample, and will therefore give negative results unless the appropriate template
is found in the patient sample.
Ingredients: Each Negative Control vial contains <0.001% DNA
polymerase complex; <0.001% Reverse Transcriptase; <0.001% target-
specific forward and reverse primer; <0.001% target-specific hydrolysis
probes; <0.05% dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP; bovine serum albumin;
dithiothreitol; RNase inhibitor; and carbohydrate.
Each reconstitution buffer/reagent grade water pouch contains the following two vials:
• 2X Reconstitution Buffer (2X RB). The buffer solution (purple buffer) is
matched to the Influenza assays and is used undiluted. The buffer enhances PCR
kinetics and is used to re-suspend JBAIDS freeze-dried reagents. Once
reconstituted, all freeze dried reagent vials contain all of the components
required for PCR.
Contents: 600 μL
• Reagent Grade Water. Reagent grade water is molecular biology grade water
used to reconstitute the Positive Controls.

L. Test Principle:
The JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit is a real time RT-PCR assay based on the
influenza A subtyping assays that are part of the “CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-
time RT-PCR Detection and Characterization Panel (rRT-PCR Flu Panel)” and the
“CDC Influenza 2009 A (H1N1)pdm Real-Time RT-PCR Panel”. These assays have
been re-optimized to work with Idaho Technology’s proprietary freeze-dried PCR
reagent formulation. Purified patient samples (using either the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path
Purification Kit or the Roche MagNA Pure Compact Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I in
conjunction with the Roche MagNA Pure Compact system) are used to reconstitute the
freeze-dried reagents which are then tested using the JBAIDS instrument.
Real-time RT-PCR involves reverse transcription of specific RNA sequences into
complementary DNA sequences, followed by logarithmic amplification and
simultaneous detection of those DNA sequences. The JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping
assays use hydrolysis probes to detect amplification of the reverse transcribed RNA
sequence of interest. Each hydrolysis probe is labeled on 5’ end with a fluorescent
reporter moiety (6-FAM) and elsewhere with a quencher (TAMRA), which prevents the
probe from emitting fluorescent signal. During PCR, the probe binds to a target
sequence in the PCR product. When the Taq polymerase replicates a template to which a
hydrolysis probe is bound, the exonuclease activity of the polymerase cleaves the probe,
separating the fluorophore from the quencher, and fluorescent signal is generated. This
fluorescence is measured and displayed by the JBAIDS instrument during the PCR
reaction. The fluorescent signal increases as additional template is amplified and more
probes are hydrolyzed.
The JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit contains four assays: seasonal Influenza A/H1
(Flu A H1); seasonal Influenza A/H3 (Flu A H3); Influenza A, swine lineage (Flu A
Sw); and Influenza A/2009 H1 (Flu A H1 2009). The Flu A H1, Flu A H3, and Flu A H1
2009 assays amplify a region of the hemagglutinin gene of the respective influenza A
virus. The Flu A Sw assay amplifies a region of the nucleocapsid protein gene of 2009
H1N1 Influenza viruses, as well as some other Influenza A viruses of swine lineage.
The JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit is based on four major processes:
• Sample collection and purification
• Reconstitution of freeze-dried reagents
• Amplification and detection of target nucleic acid on the JBAIDS instrument
• Automated interpretation of the amplification curves using the JBAIDS
software.

--- Page 9 ---
The JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping kit can be used to test NPS and NPW specimens.
Samples must be purified prior to testing with the JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit.
The purpose of sample purification is to release nucleic acid contained in the patient
sample and to remove extraneous materials (e.g., proteins and chemicals) that can
interfere with the PCR reaction. The JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping kit has been
validated for use with either the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit or the
Roche MagNA Pure Compact Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I on the Roche MagNA Pure
Compact system. The Platinum Path kit is a manual purification, while the Roche
MagNA Pure system is automated. Both methods have four basic steps: lysis to release
the nucleic acids, binding of the nucleic acids to a magnetic substrate, washing away
extraneous materials and elution of the purified nucleic acid. A brief outline of the two
purification kit methods is provided below:

*All steps are automated within the Roche MagNA Pure Compact instrument.
Negative Extraction Controls (NECs) are processed along with each batch of purified
specimens. When processing NECs, the user utilizes the Sample Purification Kit to
purify a sample of nuclease-free water. The purified NEC sample is then used to
reconstitute the freeze-dried Negative Control vials. The use of an NEC allows for
detection of contamination during the entire testing process (purification to reagent
setup).
Purified samples are tested using the freeze-dried reagents in the JBAIDS Influenza A
Subtyping kit. Reagent vials that are intended for testing patient samples are labeled as
Unknowns. Each JBAIDS run requires a Positive Control and a Negative Control for
each target assay. The JBAIDS runs should be started within about 30 minutes after

is used to physically disrupt the cells.	The samples are lysed by incubation with
Proteinase K and a special lysis buffer
containing a chaotropic salt.
Nucleic Acid
Binding	The bead-beaten sample is transferred to a
well of a strip tube containing magnetic
beads. The nucleic acid binds to the magnetic
beads.	Nucleic acids are immobilized on magnetic
glass particles.
Washing to remove
extraneous materials	Using a pick-pen with a retractable magnet,
the magnetic beads are collected from the
first well of the strip tube and transferred to a
new well containing a wash buffer. The
buffer removes extraneous materials while
the nucleic acid remains bound to the
magnetic beads. The beads are washed three
times (three wells of the strip tube).	Unbound substances are removed by several
washing steps.
Elution of nucleic acids	Using the pick-pen, the magnetic beads are
transferred to the last well of the strip tube
containing elution buffer. The nucleic acids
are released from the magnetic beads. The
beads are then removed from the sample
using the pick pen.	Purified nucleic acids are eluted from the
magnetic glass particles.

reconstitution of the freeze-dried reagents. If necessary, the reconstituted reagents can be
stored for up to four hours on ice or in the refrigerator (2-8 °C).
Reagents are set up in the following order:
1. Unknowns – Reconstitute the reagent pellet in the Unknown vials by adding 10 μL
of the provided reconstitution buffer and 10 μL of the purified sample.
2. Positive Controls – After the Unknowns are set up for each sample, set up the
Positive Controls by reconstituting the pellet with 10 μL of the provided
reconstitution buffer and 10 μL of the provided reagent-grade water.
3. Negative Controls – Set up the Negative Controls last by reconstituting the pellet
with 10 μL reconstitution buffer and 10 μL of the purified NEC.
4. For each reagent vial, transfer 19 μL of the reconstituted reagent to a capillary
following the same order used for reconstitution. The cap is placed on the capillary
tube before proceeding to the next capillary.
5. Centrifuge the capillary tubes to ensure that the PCR reagent is in the tip of the
capillary.
Each JBAIDS run can accommodate up to 6 samples with accompanying controls when
all subtyping assays are used to test each sample. The Diagnostic Wizard guides the
operator through the process of setting up the run in compliance with the JBAIDS
Influenza A Subtyping Kit package insert. After selecting the appropriate assays and
entering sample information, the operator transfers prepared capillaries to the instrument
carousel, guided by the loading pattern displayed in the Diagnostic Wizard. With the
capillaries loaded into the instrument, the operator signals the instrument to start the
PCR run. The instrument automatically controls the temperature heating cycle in the
carousel. At intervals during temperature cycling, fluorescence emission is monitored as
the carousel rotates to position each sample above the fluorimeter. Temperature and
fluorescence data are displayed in real-time. After starting the run, no input is required
and the operator need not supervise the run. At the conclusion of the run, the operator
may proceed directly to data analysis and reporting.
Each JBAIDS test is analyzed and assigned a final result by the Detector module of the
JBAIDS Software. Possible final results are positive, negative, uncertain, or invalid. To
assign a final test result, Detector first analyzes the data from each capillary
independently. Then, the software assigns a final result, or a combined call, based on the
results of the sample and all of its controls.
Each stage of the analysis is described below:
1. Independent Capillary Call
Detector does not rely on any single aspect of the amplification curve, but rather
integrates a number of factors, such as curve shape and signal-to-noise ratio into a
combined score. Curves scoring above a threshold are called positive, curves scoring
below a threshold are called negative, and curves scoring in a small area in between
are called uncertain. The scoring system has been carefully tuned to match human
expert calls on real amplification curve data.
Detector calls are characterized as follows:

--- Page 11 ---
Negative – A curve is called negative if its shape can be closely approximated by a
line (or smooth curve), if it has low signal to noise, and if it shows little or no
increase in fluorescence during the PCR.
Positive – A curve is called positive if the fluorescence shows exponential growth
out of the background, if it has high signal to noise, and if the slope of the
exponential region of the amplification is consistent with PCR amplification.
Uncertain – For a small number of curves (about 0.2%) no clear call is possible and
the reaction is called uncertain.
2. Test Result or Combined Call
The final test result is a combined call (or meta-call) based on the results of the test
sample and its associated controls.
Flow chart outlining how final results are determined
3. Follow-up Testing for Invalid or Uncertain Results
Failure of Positive or Negative Control results in invalid results for all associated
samples. Samples with invalid or uncertain results require follow-up testing in
order to achieve a valid (positive or negative) result as described below:
• Invalid – If either the Positive Control or Negative Control fails to give the
expected results, all Unknown samples for that specific assay are called invalid
and must be retested using the same purified sample. This testing can be done
using the Custom Testing Method.

--- Page 12 ---
• Uncertain – An uncertain result on a single sample requires retesting with
the same purified sample. This testing can be done using the Custom
Testing Method.
4. JBAIDS Report
A JBAIDS report is generated automatically for each test run. With the JBAIDS
Report, the user integrates the instrument-provided results for the prior performed
influenza A test and each of the influenza A subtyping tests to make a final result
interpretation.
5. Integrated Result Interpretation
The JBAIDS software automatically interprets the results for each of the target
assays. However, the user is required to make the final test interpretation based
upon the software test results for each of the four target assays.

detected.
6. Required Actions for No Subtype Detected Results
If the specimen tested positive for influenza A using the JBAIDS Influenza A & B
Detection Kit, but none of the subtyping assays are positive, then the interpretation
is ‘No Subtype Detected’. This result could occur when the titer of the virus in the
specimen is low and not detected by the subtyping assays. This result could also
indicate the presence of a novel and/or newly emerging influenza A strain. In both
cases, the residual purified nucleic acid from the specimen in question, or the re-
extracted nucleic acid from the residual specimen in question if residual purified
nucleic acid is not available, should be retested with the JBAIDS Influenza A & B
Detection Kit (or other FDA cleared nucleic acid-based tests detecting Influenza A)
and the JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit to confirm that the influenza A result
is positive and that no influenza A subtype is detected. (Note: the Custom Test
Method may be used to include the Influenza A test from the JBAIDS Influenza A
& B Detection Kit along with the Influenza A subtyping tests in the same JBAIDS
run). If the retest provides a different result, test the sample a third time to ensure
the accuracy of the result. If the retest provides the same result, then the function of
the JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping reagents should be verified by testing with
appropriate external control materials (known positive samples for seasonal
Influenza A/H1, seasonal Influenza A/H3 and 2009 H1N1 Influenza). A negative
control (known negative sample or viral transport media) should also be run to test
for PCR-product contamination. If the JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping reagents
accurately identify the external positive and negative controls, notify through the
chain-of command of the appropriate DoD agencies, or contact the state public
health authorities or CDC Influenza Division for confirmatory testing.
7. Custom Test Method
The Custom Test Method can be used to test individual assays from the JBAIDS
Influenza A Subtyping Kit. Reasons to use the Custom Test Method include:

• PC or NC failure invalidates the results for only one of the four assays
requiring retesting of all samples with only that assay.
• A sample is uncertain for one of the assays, requiring retesting with only
that assay.
• A sample is inconclusive for 2009 H1N1 Influenza, requiring retesting with
only the Flu A Sw and Flu A H1 2009 assays.
• A “No Subtype Detected” sample is retested using all four influenza A
subtype assays and the Influenza A assay from the JBAIDS Influenza A&B
Detection Kit.
• During an influenza outbreak, the Department of Defense may choose to
recommend use of the custom test method for more efficient and rapid
identification of a specific virus. In this case, the relevant subtyping
assay(s) from the JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit may be used in
conjunction with the influenza A assay from the JBAIDS Influenza A & B
Detection Kit.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A multicenter reproducibility study was performed to determine the overall system
reproducibility of the JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit on the JBAIDS instruments.
This study was performed at Idaho Technology Inc. (ITI) and two external sites. The
study was conducted with two specimen types: nasopharyngeal wash (NPW) and
nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), both collected in viral transport medium (VTM). Both
specimen types were purified using two different Sample Purification Kits, the Roche
MagNA Pure Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I and the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path Sample
Purification Kit.
A total of six different panels of nine samples each were prepared for the
reproducibility study.
• Panel 1 contained nine NPS specimens that were screened with the Flu A and
Flu B assays of the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit to ensure that no
influenza nucleic acid was present, each spiked with a representative seasonal
Influenza A H1N1 virus strain (A/New Caledonia/20/1999) at one of the three
different concentrations (LoD/20, LoD, and 3X LoD). Therefore, Panel 1
consisted of three seasonal Influenza A H1N1 virus spiked medium positive
NPS specimens (3X LoD), three seasonal Influenza A H1N1 virus spiked low
positive NPS specimens (LoD), and three seasonal Influenza A H1N1 virus
spiked high negative NPS specimens.
• Panel 2 contained nine NPW specimens that were screened with the Flu A and
Flu B assays of the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit to ensure that no
influenza nucleic acid was present, each spiked with a representative seasonal
Influenza A H1N1 virus strain (A/New Caledonia/20/1999) at one of the three
different concentrations (LoD/20, LoD, and 3X LoD). Therefore, Panel 2
consisted of three seasonal Influenza A H1N1 virus spiked medium positive

--- Page 15 ---
NPW specimens (3X LoD), three seasonal Influenza A H1N1 virus spiked low
positive NPW specimens (LoD), and three seasonal Influenza A H1N1 virus
spiked high negative NPW specimens.
• Panel 3 contained nine simulated NPS (sNPS) specimens that were screened
with the Flu A and Flu B assays of the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit
to ensure that no influenza nucleic acid was present, each spiked with a
representative seasonal Influenza A H3N2 strain (A/New York/55/2004) at one
of the three different concentrations (LoD/20, LoD, and 3X LoD). sNPS were
generated from diluting HeLa cells into VTM. (Note: refer to the “Validation
of Simulated Sample Matrices” section for details). Therefore, Panel 3
consisted of three seasonal Influenza A H3N2 virus spiked medium positive
sNPS specimens (3X LoD), three seasonal Influenza A H3N2 virus spiked low
positive sNPS specimens (LoD), and three seasonal Influenza A H3N2 virus
spiked high negative sNPS specimens.
• Panel 4 contained nine simulated NPW (sNPW) specimens that were screened
with the Flu A and Flu B assays of the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit
to ensure that no influenza nucleic acid was present, each spiked with a
representative seasonal Influenza A H3N2 strain (A/New York/55/2004) at one
of the three different concentrations (LoD/20, LoD, and 3X LoD). sNPW were
generated from diluting HeLa cells into 50% VTM and 50% saline (0.9%
NaCl). (Note: refer to the “Validation of Simulated Sample Matrices” section
for details). Therefore, Panel 4 consisted of three seasonal Influenza A H3N2
virus spiked medium positive sNPW specimens (3X LoD), three seasonal
Influenza A H3N2 virus spiked low positive sNPW specimens (LoD), and
three seasonal Influenza A H3N2 virus spiked high negative sNPW specimens.
• Panel 5 contained nine simulated NPS (sNPS) specimens that were screened
with the Flu A and Flu B assays of the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit
to ensure that no influenza nucleic acid was present, each spiked with a
representative 2009 H1N1 Influenza strain (A/New York/18/2009) at one of
the three different concentrations (LoD/20, LoD, and 3X LoD). sNPS were
generated from diluting HeLa cells into VTM. (Note: refer to the “Validation
of Simulated Sample Matrices” section for details). Therefore, Panel 5
consisted of three 2009 H1N1 Influenza virus spiked medium positive sNPS
specimens (3X LoD), three 2009 H1N1 Influenza virus spiked low positive
sNPS specimens (LoD), and three 2009 H1N1 Influenza virus spiked high
negative sNPS specimens.
• Panel 6 contained nine simulated NPW (sNPW) specimens that were screened
with the Flu A and Flu B assays of the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit
to ensure that no influenza nucleic acid was present, each spiked with a
representative 2009 H1N1 Influenza strain (A/New York/18/2009) at one of
the three different concentrations (LoD/20, LoD, and 3X LoD). sNPW were
generated from diluting HeLa cells into 50% VTM and 50% saline (0.9%
NaCl). (Note: refer to the “Validation of Simulated Sample Matrices” section
for details). Therefore, Panel 6 consisted of three 2009 H1N1 Influenza virus
spiked medium positive sNPW specimens (3X LoD), three 2009 H1N1
Influenza virus spiked low positive sNPW specimens (LoD), and three 2009
H1N1 Influenza virus spiked high negative sNPW specimens.
Note: Panels 3 and 4 specimens were also co-spiked with a representative Influenza B
virus strain (B/Ohio/1/2005) for more efficient reproducibility testing of the JBAIDS

Influenza A Subtyping Kit. Refer to the “Co-spiking Specimen Validation” section for
details demonstrating that combining these two viruses in a sample, even at high
concentrations, had no detrimental effect on the detection of either virus.

Each panel of 9 samples was tested twice daily for five days at each testing site. Every
testing day, two users each tested each of the nine samples. Prior to testing with the
JBAIDS assays, one user used the Roche MagNA Pure Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I
and the other user used the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit to extract
viral nucleic acid from each sample. For each panel, each sample was tested a total of
30 times (2 runs/day/site X 5 days X 3 Sites; 15 times after purification with the
Platinum Path kit and 15 times after purification with the MagNA Pure kit), and each
concentration level per sample type was tested a total of 90 times (3 samples spiked at
each concentration level in each of the 6 panels).

Each JBAIDS run performed in this study included Positive Control (PC) and negative
extraction control (NEC) reactions. (Note: to ensure that no contamination of virus or
amplification product was contracted during sample preparation and reaction setup, a
NEC, which was an aliquot of reagent grade water, was prepared and tested with each
batch of purified samples.)
Of the 63 Flu A H1 PC reactions tested in this study, all were valid (63/63; 100%).
The Flu A H1 PC reactions had a mean Cp of 31.41 ± 0.56 (1.78 % CV). Sixty-
one of the 63 Flu A H1 NEC reactions (61/63; 96.8%) tested in this study yielded
the expected negative target results and were valid. Two failed NEC reactions
were observed and the associated runs were invalid. One failed NEC was likely
due to the control capillaries being incorrectly loaded in the JBAIDS carousel, as
reported by the user. The purified samples were retested with new controls. The
other failed NEC had a positive result for the Flu A H1 assay, possibly due to
contamination. The work area was cleaned and fresh samples were re-extracted
and tested. All controls were valid on the retest run.
Sixty-two out of 65 Flu A H3 PC and NEC reactions tested in this study were
valid (62/65; 95.4%). The mean Cp of the Flu A H3 PC reactions was 30.86 ±
0.20 (0.65% CV). Three invalid runs were successfully detected by the controls.
These run failures appear to be due to the carousel being improperly seated by the
user. This shifted the capillaries during the test, resulting in a loss of fluorescence
detection in all samples. The JBAIDS software correctly assigned failure results
to the controls in these runs. The data from these invalid runs were not included in
this study. All controls were valid on the retest run.
All 63 Flu A Sw PC and NEC reactions tested in this study were valid. The
mean Cp of the Flu A Sw PC reactions was 28.27 ± 0.30 (1.06% CV). All 63
Flu A H1 2009 PC and NEC reactions tested were valid. The mean Cp of the
Flu A H1 2009 PC reactions was 32.01 ± 0.39 (1.22% CV).
Although the JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit does not contain a sample control
assay, the Flu SC assay from the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit was tested
with each sample. This assay targets the human RNaseP sequence and serves as an
external control to detect inhibition, inadequate sample extraction, or poor specimen
collection. It is recommended that any sample tested with the Influenza A Subtyping
Kit first be tested with the Influenza A & B Detection kit; therefore the Flu SC assay
would have been previously tested with each sample. Of the 1,628 Flu SC reactions
tested in this study, 1,620 Flu SC reactions gave positive results, while 8 negative
results were observed (1620/1628; 99.5%). All Flu SC negative results were from
NPW or sNPW samples, which may contain fewer human cells per unit volume than
swab samples. Because negative Flu SC results only cause a control failure for
negative influenza assays, six of the eight negative Flu SC results did not affect the
positive metacall; the corresponding influenza assays had the expected positive
metacall results. The other two negative Flu SC assays results were called SC Failures,
and both occurred with the same sample. On the initial run the sample gave an SC
Failure call. According to the protocol the purified sample was retested, both
undiluted and diluted 1:10. The retest result for the undiluted sample was again an SC
Failure. Therefore a new aliquot of the same sample was re-extracted and tested.

--- Page 18 ---
Results for the second retest were positive for the Flu A H3 and Flu SC assays.
For the Flu SC assay, NPS samples exhibited a mean Cp of 30.15 ± 2.36 (7.83% CV)
and NPW samples had a mean Flu SC Cp of 33.18 ± 1.88 (5.67% CV). The cell
concentrations used to prepare the sNPS and sNPW samples were chosen to mimic Flu
SC Cp values of fresh specimens. The sNPS samples had a mean Cp of 32.06 ± 2.00
(6.24% CV) and sNPW samples exhibited a mean Cp of 34.29 ± 2.29 (6.68% CV) for
the Flu SC assay. These Cp values are consistent with previous testing of frozen
simulated samples prepared at 104.2 and 103.7HeLa cells/mL for sNPS and sNPW
samples, respectively. The 6-8% CV in the Flu SC mean Cp values measured for each
sample type arises primarily from differences in Flu SC Cp values observed for the two
sample purification kits. Typically MagNA Pure extracted samples exhibit Cp values 4
cycles earlier than respective Platinum Path extracted samples.

Results of retest shown; first tests were inconclusive.
Note: The rate of positive test results at the high negative level was higher than
expected and is most likely the result of variation in the preparation of the samples used
for this study, potentially resulting in somewhat higher than expected levels of virus in
these samples.
This reproducibility study demonstrated that as expected with all real-time PCR assays,
the JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit may not generate reproducibly positive results
when testing samples that have analyte concentrations lower than the LoD
concentration, but higher than the assay cutoff concentration. This limitation should be
addressed by including the following statement in the Limitation section of the
JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit Instructions for Use: “The JBAIDS Influenza
A Subtyping Kit may not generate reproducibly positive results when testing samples
that have analyte concentrations lower than the LoD concentration, but higher than
the assay cutoff concentration.”
The variability of the Cp value can be used as an additional measure of the variability
of JBAIDS assays. Therefore, the average and %CV of Cp values obtained in this
study were used to further evaluate the precision/reproducibility of the test system.

Assay Controls
The following controls are included in the JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit:
Negative Control
The NC is used to detect contamination from target-specific amplified product
(amplicon), synthetic RNA (as found in the PC vials), or virus. The NC vial is
reconstituted using the purified negative extraction control (NEC) (molecular biology
grade water). The NEC should be processed along with each batch of specimens
purified. The NC detects possible contamination during sample purification and during
reconstitution of freeze- dried reagents. Each JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit run
requires one NC for each of the 4 assays (i.e., the Flu A H1, Flu A H3, Flu A H1 2009,
and Flu A Sw assays). For each target assay, the NC must be negative, or the JBAIDS
software will assign invalid results for that target assay to all of the samples in that run.
If the NC fails, the JBAIDS run must be repeated using the same purified samples. If
the NC fails again, all associated samples are considered to have invalid results and
should be re-purified starting from another aliquot of the original specimens.
Sixty-one of the 63 Flu A H1 NEC reactions (61/63; 96.8%) tested in the multi-
site reproducibility study yielded the expected negative target results and were
valid. All controls were valid on the retest run. Sixty-two out of 65 Flu A H3 NEC
reactions tested in this study were valid (62/65; 95.4%). All controls were valid on
the retest run. All 63 Flu A Sw and Flu A H1 2009 NEC reactions tested in this
study were valid.
During the prospective clinical study, of 261 runs, there were a total of 8 (3.1%)
runs in which the NCs failed. Site 1 and Site 2 had 3 NC failures each, all of
which were associated with the Flu A H1 2009 assay. Site 4 and Site 6 each had 1

run failure with the Flu A H1 2009 NC. All associated specimens were retested
and no specimens were lost due to these failures.
Positive Control
The PC serves as an amplification and detection control. Each JBAIDS Influenza A
Subtyping Kit run requires one PC for each of the 4 assays (i.e., the Flu A H1, Flu A
H3, Flu A H1 2009, and Flu A Sw assays). For each target assay, the PC must be
positive. If the PC fails, the JBAIDS software will assign invalid results for that target
assay to all of the associated samples, and the JBAIDS run must be repeated starting
from the same purified specimens. Failure of the PCs may indicate errors in sample
setup, degradation of the reagents, or a malfunction of the JBAIDS instrument.
Of the 63 Flu A H1 PC reactions tested in the reproducibility study, all were valid
(63/63; 100%). The Flu A H1 PC reactions had a mean Cp of 31.41 ± 0.56 (1.78
% CV). Sixty-two out of 65 Flu A H3 PC reactions tested in this study were valid
(62/65; 95.4%). The mean Cp of the Flu A H3 PC reactions was 30.86 ± 0.20
(0.65% CV). All controls were valid on the retest run. All 63 Flu A Sw PC
reactions tested in this study were valid. The mean Cp of the Flu A Sw PC
reactions was 28.27 ± 0.30 (1.06% CV). All 63 Flu A H1 2009 PC reactions tested
were valid. The mean Cp of the Flu A H1 2009 PC reactions was 32.01 ± 0.39
(1.22% CV).
During the prospective clinical study, of 261 runs, there were a total of 2 (0.8%)
runs in which the PCs failed. Site 2 had 1 Flu A H1 2009 PC failure. Site 6 had 1
Flu A Sw PC failure. All associated specimens were retested and no specimens
were lost due to these failures. The Flu A H1 PC reactions had a mean Cp of 32.1
± 0.6 (1.8 % CV). The mean Cp of the Flu A H3 PC reactions was 30.3 ± 0.3
(1.0% CV). The mean Cp of the Flu A Sw PC reactions was 28.9 ± 0.4 (1.5% CV).
The mean Cp of the Flu A H1 2009 PC reactions was 31.4 ± 0.3 (1.1% CV).
The final Cp cutoff values for the Flu A H1, Flu A H3, Flu A Sw and Flu A H1 2009
positive controls are 37.1, 36.3, 33.4, and 36.7 respectively, and are based on the upper
bound of the manufacturing QA Review range for reagent lot release plus 4 x SD. The
estimated standard deviation (SD) was set to 0.9 Cp to reflect the amount of variation
that is consistent with data obtained in the JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit and the
JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit analytical and clinical studies. If an
amplification curve for a PC fails to amplify or has a Cp value later than the cutoff, the
PC will be interpreted as a failure and the associated patient test results will be
assigned an invalid test result.
Extraction Control (EC)
Positive Extraction Control (PEC) was not provided with the kit, and inclusion of a
PEC with each batch of extracted samples is not a standard part of the testing protocol
recommended in the product package insert. However, during the clinical study, a PEC
and a NEC were purified with each batch of clinical samples. Inclusion of a NEC with
each batch of purified samples is a standard part of the testing protocol recommended
in the product package insert. PECs were simulated NPS (sNPS; HeLa cells in viral
transport media) spiked with four representative influenza strains (Influenza B,

--- Page 24 ---
seasonal Influenza A H1N1, seasonal Influenza A H3N2, and 2009 H1N1 Influenza) at
concentrations near the LoD for the influenza assays. The PEC was processed and
tested in the same manner as a patient sample. The PEC was considered successful
when all tested target assays were positive. A failed PEC was retested using the same
purified sample and the results of the retest were accepted as the final result. If the
retest was unsuccessful, all associated samples were considered to have invalid results
and required re-purification in order to obtain a valid test result.
During the prospective clinical evaluation, 11 out of a total of 194 PECs required
retesting. Nine retests (3 at Site 1, 3 at Site 2, 1 at Site 4, and 2 at Site 6) were required
due to an invalid assay result (PC or NC). Two PEC failures occurred as a result of one
of the four target assays giving a negative result (Flu A H1 one time and Flu A H1
2009 one time). Retesting was performed for one of the failures (Flu A H1 2009) which
resolved the failure. There was no retest performed for the other failure. This lack of
retesting was a protocol deviation. Five (5) samples associated with this run were
excluded from data analysis. The mean Cp of the PEC tested for the Flu A H1 assay
was 31.1, with 2.7 Standard Deviation (SD) and 8.6 % CV. The mean Cp of the PEC
tested for the Flu A H3 assay was 30.7, with 1.5 Standard Deviation (SD) and 4.7 %
CV. The mean Cp of the PEC tested for the Flu A H1 2009 assay was 31.2, with 1.9
Standard Deviation (SD) and 6.1 % CV. The mean Cp of the PEC tested for the Flu A
Sw assay was 29.6, with 2.0 Standard Deviation (SD) and 6.8 % CV.
The NEC was a nuclease-free water sample that was processed with each batch of
purified specimens. The purified NEC sample was then used to reconstitute the
freeze- dried NC.
Specimen Stability
The sponsor recommends that MPW and NPS specimens be collected and placed into
viral transport media (VTM). Once collected, specimens may be tested immediately
after collection, transported to an off-site testing location, or temporarily stored until
testing can be scheduled. Inappropriate handling or storage may compromise the
integrity of the specimens and cause inaccurate test results. An analytical study
determining the appropriate storage times and temperatures for both unprocessed
specimens (e.g., the NPW and NPS specimens) and processed samples (e.g., purified
nucleic acid from NPW and NPS specimens) was carried out. The specimen transport
and storage conditions that were evaluated are based on common clinical laboratory
workflows.
Three Influenza A subtype strains (i.e., Influenza A/H1, Influenza A/H3, and 2009
H1N1 Influenza) were evaluated with the JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit for both
unprocessed and purified samples.
Note: Specimens spiked with a representative Influenza A/H3 virus strain (A/New
York/55/2004) were also co-spiked with a representative Influenza B virus strain
(B/Ohio/1/2005) for more efficient testing of the JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit.
Refer to the “Co-spiking Specimen Validation” section for details demonstrating that
combining these two viruses in a sample, even at high concentrations, had no
detrimental effect on the detection of either virus.

--- Page 25 ---
For the unprocessed specimen transport and storage evaluation, both negative and
positive specimens were assessed. Positive specimens were spiked with appropriate
Influenza A viruses at the established LoD for the respective assay. Eight positive (per
influenza strain) and four negative specimens were processed at each time point and
storage condition per purification kit prior to testing with the freeze-dried reagents.
Both specimen types (NPW and NPS) were evaluated independently.
For the purified sample transport and storage evaluation, sets of eight positive samples
(per influenza strain) and four negative samples that had been processed with either
purification method were tested immediately and also aliquoted for storage under
various conditions prior to retesting with the freeze-dried reagents. Purified samples
were also tested to determine the storage of reconstituted freeze-dried reagents.
The following table summarizes the final conditions that were evaluated in this study:
Final Storage Conditions Evaluated for each Sample Matrix/Purification Kit
Combination
Sample Types Conditions
Day 0, no storage
4 Hours, ambient (18-30°C)
Unprocessed Specimens Day 3, refrigerated (2-8°C)

Day 30, frozen (≤ -70°C) MagNA Pure only
Day 0, no storage
Reconstituted Freeze Dried-Reagents 4 Hours, refrigerated (2-8°C)
The performance at each time point was evaluated by comparing the JBAIDS assay
result (positive, negative, uncertain, or SC fail) to the expected result and the result at
the initial time point. To be acceptable, all negative samples must be negative for the
influenza subtyping assays and positive for the Flu SC assay, and seven of eight
positive samples must test positive for the relevant assays (Flu A H1, Flu A H3, Flu A
H1 2009, and Flu A Sw). In addition, the mean Cp and F values of the stored
max
sample set were compared to those obtained at the initial time point. For an acceptable
storage condition, the mean Cp of the influenza subtyping assays for the positive
sample set should not increase by more than 3 cycles, and the mean F must not
max
decrease by more than 50%.
Unprocessed Specimen Storage Conditions Test Results
At least seven of the eight positive human derived NPS and NPW specimens in each
sample set tested positive at all four time points with the respective Influenza A
subtyping assay. The mean Cp values for the stored specimens were all within three
cycles of the day 0 time point suggesting no decrease in assay performance with storage.
In addition, the mean F values for the time points were never less than 50% of the
max

These results indicate that NPS and NPW specimens can be stored at 18-30 °C for up
to four hours, at 2-8 °C for up to three days, and at ≤ -15 °C for up to thirty days prior
to testing without compromising the results.
Purified Sample Storage Conditions Test Results
At least seven of the eight purified human derived NPS and NPW positive samples in
each sample set tested positive at each time point with the respective Influenza A
subtyping assay. The average Cp values for the stored samples were all within 3 cycles

These results indicate that purified samples can be stored at 18-30 °C for up to four
hours, at 2-8 °C for up to one day, and frozen (≤ -15 °C for Platinum Path purified
samples, ≤ -70°C for MagNA Pure purified samples) for up to thirty days prior to
testing without compromising the results.
Reconstituted Reagent Storage Conditions Test Results
All but one of the positive samples tested positive at both the initial time point and
after four hours of refrigeration. The mean Cp values for the stored reactions were all
within 3 cycles of the initial time point suggesting no decrease in assay performance
with storage. In addition, the mean F values for the stored reagents were never less
max
than 50% of the F of the initial baseline indicating no reduction of test system
max
performance. All negative reactions tested negative at both time points.
These results indicate that reconstituted reagents can be stored at 2-8 °C for up to four
hours without compromising the results.
d. Detection limit:
Initial estimates for setting the LoD were performed by spiking simulated (s)NPW and
sNPS samples with serial dilutions of quantified representative Influenza A viruses
(Influenza A H1N1 strain A/New Caledonia/20/1999, Influenza A H1N1 strain
A/Hawaii/15/2001, Influenza A H3N2 strain A/New York/55/2004, Influenza A H3N2
strain A/Wisconsin/67/2005, 2009 H1N1 Influenza strain A/New York/18/2009, 2009
H1N1 Influenza strain A/California/7/2009). The spiked samples were then processed
using the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit and the Roche MagNA Pure
Compact Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I, and the purified samples were tested with the
associated Influenza A subtyping assays (Flu A H1, Flu A H3, Flu A H12009, and Flu
A Sw). An initial estimate of the LoD was made by evaluating the reaction quality at
each dilution. Reactions were evaluated using multiple criteria, including the JBAIDS
test results, the Cp values, and a visual examination of the amplification curves. LoD
estimates were then further evaluated by testing human-derived or simulated samples

--- Page 27 ---
spiked with refined serial dilutions of the representative influenza viruses.
Once the LoD was estimated, a set of 20 specimens was collected from 20 unique
donors for each combination of specimen type (NPS or NPW) and purification kit
(Platinum Path or MagNA Pure). The samples were spiked at the estimated LoD level,
processed, and tested with the JBAIDS Influenza A subtyping assays to determine the
frequency of positive results. The LoD was confirmed if at least 19 of the 20 samples
gave a positive test result.
The LoD levels for detection of each virus subtype were independently established
using two representative Influenza A strains of each subtype (seasonal Influenza A
H1N1, seasonal Influenza A H3N2, and 2009 H1N1 Influenza). The LoD for detection
of the 2009 H1N1 Influenza strain required positive results for both the Flu A Sw and
Flu A H1 2009 assays. Specifically, the lowest concentration of 2009 H1N1 Influenza
virus where both assays exhibited ≥ 95% positive detection was considered the final
LoD.
Based on the titration results for each strain, the LoD levels were set at the
concentrations for which ≥95% detection was observed for both sample types and both
nucleic acid purification kits. All sets of 20 samples spiked with Influenza A viruses
gave at least 19/20 positive results with the appropriate JBAIDS Flu A subtyping assay.
The LoD for the Flu A/ H1 assay is 50 EID /mL for A/New Caledonia/20/1999 and
50
5,000 EID /mL for A/Hawaii/15/2001. The LoD for the Flu A H3 assay is 5
50
EID /mL for A/New York/55/2004 and 10 EID /mL for A/Wisconsin/67/2005. The
50 50
LoD for detection of the Influenza A/2009 H1 virus is 1,500 EID /mL for A/New
50
York/18/2009 and 5,000 EID /mL for A/California/7/2009.

Note: One possible cause for the variation in LoD concentrations between strains is
differences in the method of quantification and detection. Quantification using EID
50
measures the infectivity and cytotoxicity or lethality of an organism in egg culture, and
is therefore subject to many influences (strain-to-strain differences in infectivity,
viability of the original material, culturing conditions, etc.). In contrast, the JBAIDS
assays detect the presence of target nucleic acid using PCR; differences in detection
reflect the quantity of starting target nucleic acid present as well as the
complementarities of the assay primers and probes. Consequently, even with closely
related/identical target sequences, strains/isolates tested at similar concentrations as
quantified by EID , may contain quite different concentrations of target nucleic acid as

measured by PCR. Therefore, LoD concentrations established for the JBAIDS PCR
assays may not reflect significant differences in sensitivity of detection, rather they
reflect differences in starting concentration of target nucleic acid. This was the case for
the two representative seasonal Influenza A/H1 strains: the A/New Caledonia/20/1999
isolate appears to contain 17 to 45 times more target nucleic acid (as evidenced by a 4.1
to 5.5 Cp shift, assuming amplification efficiency is 2 ) per EID than the
50
A/Hawaii/15/2001 isolate.
e. Analytical Reactivity:
For inclusivity testing, sNPS samples were spiked with various strains of influenza
target viruses within the specific Influenza A subtyping genera prior to testing with the
JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit. Viruses were spiked at concentrations estimated
to be near the LoD of each analyte. Due to differences in quantification methods
between primary strains (quantified in EID /mL) and analytical reactivity panel
50
strains (mostly quantified in TCID /mL), concentrations spanning the primary strain
50
LoD (0.1×, 1×, 10×LoD, assuming 1 EID was equivalent to 1 TCID ) were tested. If
50 50
a sample containing a particular strain was positive at any of the concentrations, no
further testing of that strain was required. If a strain was not detected at any of these
concentrations, the strain was retested in 10-fold higher increments until a positive
result was obtained or until the maximum concentration possible for that strain stock
had been tested.
The following 3 tables provide a complete listing of the Influenza A strains
that were used to assess the analytical reactivity or inclusivity of the test
system. The 8 Influenza A H1N1 strains tested represents human isolates
collected in United States, Australia, Europe, Asia, and the Solomon
Islands between 1933 and 2007. The 10 Influenza A H3N2 strains tested
represents human isolates collected in South America, North America,
Europe and Asia between 1968 and 2009. The 11 Influenza A (swine
lineage) 2009 H1N1 strains are representative of human isolates collected
throughout the United States in 2009.

JBAIDS Influenza A/H1 assay results
The JBAIDS Influenza A/H1 assay accurately identified 7/8 individual Influenza A
H1N1 isolates. However, there was high variability in concentrations of virus that was
detected (ranging from 5-500,000 TCID /mL). The Flu A H1 assay was unable to
50
detect the A1/Denver/1/57 strain at a final concentration of 5,000 TCID /mL (higher
50
concentrations could not be tested due to low stock concentration).
Sequence alignments of isolates evaluated (or similar isolates) indicated that there
were 0-4 mismatches per primer or probe. Older strains for the virus (prior to 1957)
tended to have more mismatches than the more contemporary isolates evaluated.
A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 and A/Brisbane/59/07 isolates had zero to one mismatch

combined in primers and probe sequences; the Brisbane isolate had 1 mismatch in the
forward primer region. Sequence alignments for all available strains isolated between
2006-2011 demonstrated 0-1 mismatches per primer or probe sequence reflecting that
this assay was designed to detect contemporary virus strains. Sequence alignment of
A/PR/8/34, which was detected at 500,000 TCID /mL, has a mismatch within the first
50
few bases of the 3’ end of both the forward and reverse primers. Exact sequences for
A/Mal/302/54 and A1/Denver/1/57 were not available. However, sequences from
isolates collected in the same geographical region and in the same year were aligned.
For both isolates, the sequences had 3 mismatches in both the forward and reverse
primers and two consecutive mismatches in the probe. These mismatches may
contribute to the decrease in sensitivity of the Flu A H1 assay. Another possible cause
for the variation is differences in the quantification methods. LoD concentration
differences established in EID or TCID can vary dramatically between organism
50 50
stocks, but may not actually reflect significant differences in target nucleic acid
concentration.
JBAIDS Influenza A/H3 assay results
The JBAIDS Influenza A/H3 assay accurately identified 7/10 individual Influenza A
H3N2 isolates with a range of virus concentrations from 0.5 to 50 TCID /mL. The
50
following isolates were not detected even at the maximum concentration allowed
based upon stock concentration: A/Aichi/2/68 at 114,000 TCID /mL, A/Hong
50
Kong/8/68 at 137,000 TCID /mL, and A/MRC-2 recomb at 7,350 TCID /mL.
50 50
Sequence alignments of isolates evaluated (or similar isolates) indicated that there
were 0-1 mismatches per primer and 1-5 mismatches with the probe. More
contemporary isolates evaluated (strains isolated from 2007-2009) had significantly
fewer mismatches in the probe region. In addition, viruses isolated prior to 1975 also
had a mismatch within the first 3 bases of the reverse primer binding region. In general,
contemporary strains (strains isolated between 2006-2011) have 0-1 mismatches per
primer or probe sequence.
Of the isolates with observed decreased sensitivity or missed detection, sequences that
were available were aligned with the PCR primers and probe for the Flu A H3 assay to
determine whether sequence mismatches may be contributing to the potentially
reduced sensitivity of the JBAIDS influenza A/H3 assay. In addition to the mismatch
in the 3’ end of the reverse primer, both the A/Aichi/2/68 and A/Hong Kong/8/68
isolates had five mismatches in the probe sequence, suggesting that the observed
decreased sensitivity for these two isolates may be attributed to the high number of
mismatches under the probe. The sequence for A/MRC-2 recomb was not available.
JBAIDS 2009 H1N1 Influenza (Flu A Sw and Flu A H1 2009) assays results
The JBAIDS 2009 H1N1 Influenza (Flu A Sw and Flu A H1 2009) assays accurately
identified 11/11 individual 2009 H1N1 Influenza (swine lineage) isolates tested with a
range of virus concentration from 150 to 1,500 TCID /mL. Variation in the lowest
50
concentration detected may be due to differences in relative quantification methods as
well as virus strain sequence variation.

--- Page 32 ---
The analytical inclusivity data for the 4 Influenza A subtyping assays combined with in
silico analysis indicated that the assays detect contemporary strains of human Influenza
A viruses with acceptable analytical sensitivity.
f. Analytical Specificity/Cross-reactivity Evaluation:
Analytical Specificity (Exclusivity) testing involved the following organisms: 1) Non-
target influenza types (those not specific to the type assay); 2) Non-influenza viruses;
and 3) Other closely related organisms that colonize the upper respiratory tract, cause
respiratory symptoms, are common skin flora or laboratory contaminants, or are
microorganisms for which much of the population may have been infected.
Each organism was spiked at a high level (when possible, viruses were spiked at 105×
provided stock units, and other organisms were spiked at 106× provided stock units;
otherwise organisms were spiked at the highest allowable concentration) into a sNPS
sample prior to extraction using the Roche MagNA Pure Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I
and testing with the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit.
The following 2 tables provide the exclusivity panels that were used to evaluate the
test system analytical specificity or exclusivity:

For the non-target influenza virus exclusivity panel, the expected negative results were
obtained for all of the assays with the following exceptions. Three Influenza A viruses
were detected by the Flu A Sw assay: A/Maryland/12/1991, A/Iowa/1/2006,
A/swine/Wisconsin/125/1997. These results were not unexpected since these isolates
were all of subtype H1N1 with the first two isolated from humans but containing swine
lineage sequences and the third isolated from swine. BLAST evaluation of the Flu A
Sw assay primers and probes against recent influenza sequences (from 2009-2011)
indicated that of the top 500 sequence alignments (from 2009-2011), 8 percent of the
isolates that aligned within an E value range of 7e-06 to 3e-05 were of isolates from
swine.
In addition, Influenza A H3N2 virus isolate A/SW/IA/1/99 (isolated from swine) was
detected by both the Flu A H3 and Flu A Sw assays. Detection of swine Influenza A/H3
viruses by the Flu A H3 assay is not unexpected as the hemagglutinin sequences for
swine and human isolates are very similar.
All 36 non-influenza organisms, tested at high concentrations, (bacteria or fungi spiked
at 106 CFU/mL or TCID /mL and viruses spiked at 103 - 105 copies/mL or TCID /mL)
50 50
gave the expected negative results for all Influenza A subtyping assays. This
evaluation indicated that the primers and probes in the JBAIDS Influenza Subtyping
assays do not cross-react with the non-influenza exclusivity organisms tested.
g. Assay cut-off:
Each JBAIDS test is analyzed with the data analysis software module. The module is
called Detector. The module determines the outcome of the tests conducted on the
samples. The module first analyzes the data from each capillary independently. Then
the replicates of the samples are analyzed together (if applicable). Finally the module
interprets the outcome of these analyses for the sample and its controls.
The analysis module algorithm consists of two basic parts. The first identifies samples
that are obviously positive or negative (Obvious Tests), and second that computes a
refined estimate of the samples status when the sample is not called an obvious
positive or obvious negative (Expert Test).The algorithms are based on an Expert
System approach to determining positive and negative samples, but the approach is not
learning after release, and is deterministic, meaning that every sample will have the
same outcome every time the algorithm evaluates the sample. The purpose of Obvious
Tests is to call those samples that are clearly positive or negative. In this way, only
non-obvious samples will need to be processed by the more computationally involved
detector algorithms. Obvious tests produce internal scores and compare them against
fixed thresholds to return a positive/negative/uncertain call. Expert Tests algorithm is
based on mathematically modeling the expected shapes of the amplification curves of

positive and negative samples. The model itself is based on tests for nine distinct
characteristics in the amplification curves and it assigns nine test scores to each curve.
After the tests are scored, the amplification curve is scored as a weighted sum of the
tests.
Thresholds for the Obvious Tests and weights in the Expert Tests for Detector were
determined using training data sets and numerical optimization to pick parameters that
ensure Detector minimizes the number of error observed in real-world data.
Validation data from JBAIDS Customer Validation Testing, and Dugway Operational
Assessment were gathered and evaluated with Detector to validate the analysis module
algorithm. These data contain samples from five separate data sets: typical data,
atypical data, negative dominated, RNA data and Dugway field data. The data were
gathered from varied sources, including a variety of assays, instruments and users, to
obtain examples of all possible JBAIDS data. There are 28,467 samples in the data
sets. 99.6% of the samples were correctly called by the Detector. 0.19% of the samples
were called “Uncertain” and 0.21% of the samples were incorrectly called.
h. Interfering Substances:
An interfering substances study was carried out to examine whether a panel of
endogenous and exogenous potential RT-PCR inhibitors and technique-specific
substances (substances that could be introduced into the PCR reaction as contaminants
during sample purification or during reaction setup) affect the performance of the
JBAIDS Influenza Subtyping Kit. The concentration of substances tested represented a
relevant concentration in accordance with CLSI EP7-A2 Interference Testing in
Clinical Chemistry Approved Guideline, or for test substances not listed in the CLSI
document, concentrations were determined by evaluating the scientific literature or
references from other IVD package inserts. For each endogenous, exogenous and
technique specific test substance, sNPW specimens containing a representative
Influenza A/H1, Influenza A/H3, or 2009 H1N1 Influenza virus (A/New
Caledonia/20/1999, A/New York/55/2004, or A/New York/18/2009) at a concentration
equivalent to 5×LoD were spiked with the appropriate amount of test substance.
Note: sNPW specimens spiked with a representative seasonal Influenza A H3N2 virus
strain (A/New York/55/2004) were also co-spiked with Influenza B virus
(B/Ohio/1/2005) for more efficient interfering substances testing of the JBAIDS
Influenza A & B Detection Kit. Refer to the “Co-spiking Specimen Validation” section
for details demonstrating that combining these two viruses in a sample, even at high
concentrations, had no detrimental effect on the detection of either virus.
In each round of purifications, an influenza-containing sNPW sample that had not been
spiked with the interfering substance was also included. This sample served as a
control to which the other specimens were compared. All specimens, except those
containing Roche MagNA Pure Compact Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I technique
specific substances (i.e., MagNA Pure buffers), were purified using the Roche MagNA
Pure Compact Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I on the Roche MagNA Pure Compact
System. Each purified sample was tested with the Influenza A Subtyping assays (Flu A
H1, Flu A H3, or Flu A H1 and Flu A Sw) corresponding to the virus with which it

--- Page 36 ---
was spiked, and also tested with the Flu SC assay. The Roche MagNA Pure Compact
Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I technique-specific substances that could be introduced
during sample purification (i.e., MagNA Pure buffers) were added to the purified
samples immediately prior to influenza assay reaction setup. Substances were
considered to be potential inhibitors if the results for the tested assays were negative.
Note: Only sNPW samples purified using the Roche MagNA Pure Compact Nucleic
Acid Isolation Kit I on the Roche MagNA Pure Compact System were evaluated. NPS
samples purified with the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit were
previously evaluated with the FDA cleared JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage)
Detection System (k100287). The Platinum Path kit was shown to remove both
endogenous and exogenous substances from NPS and throat swab samples. In addition,
the wash and elution buffers contained in the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path Sample
Purification Kit (technique-specific substances) did not interfere with detection of the
JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 assays.

Of all of the endogenous and exogenous substances tested, only snuff (nasal tobacco)
has the potential to cause inaccurate negative test results due to inhibition. Of the
technique- specific substances tested, improper introduction of contents from four of
the MagNA Pure reagent cartridge wells to purified samples have the potential to
cause inaccurate negative test results due to inhibition:
• MagNA Pure Proteinase K Solution (well 1)
• MagNA Pure Lysis Solution (well 2)
• MagNA Pure Magnetic Glass Particles (well 3)
• MagNA Pure Wash Buffer I (well 4)
These substances, along with ethanol, bleach, and DNAZap™, which are known PCR
inhibitors, are included in the package insert as potentially interfering substances.
In addition, the study also demonstrated that the JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping
assays react with the viral material contained in the 2009-2010 version of the FluMist
intranasal influenza vaccine (MedImmune). When NPS and NPW specimens are
collected from individuals who have recently received a dose of the nasal vaccine, the
JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping assays may react with the vaccine material to give
inaccurate positive results.
Note: The material being tested (FluMist® Influenza Vaccine Live, Intranasal;
Intranasal Spray, 2009-2010 Formula) was provided by the manufacturer
(MedImmune) in individual sprayers, each containing a single 0.2 mL dose. Each dose
contained approximately 106.5-7.5 FFU (fluorescence focus units) each of three live,

i. Carry-Over Contamination:
An analytical study was carried out to evaluate the frequency of carryover in the
JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit when it is used as instructed by the product insert.
Significant levels of carryover will result in false positive test results for negative
samples that are contaminated by adjacent positive samples. For the JBAIDS Influenza
A Subtyping Kit, carryover could occur during sample purification or reagent setup.
To assess the potential for carryover, sample sets consisting of negative and high
positive samples were processed in an alternating pattern using the Roche MagNA
Pure Compact Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I on the Roche MagNA Pure Compact
system and then tested with the JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit.
Note: The potential for carryover in samples purified with the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path
Purification Kit was previously evaluated with JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage)
Detection Kit (k100287) and demonstrated that significant levels of carryover do not
occur when samples are processed and tested according to the instructions in the
package insert.
High positive sNPS samples were spiked with Influenza A H3N2 strain A/New
York/55/2004 at approximately 2000× LoD (~1.0 × 104 EID /mL). Five independent
50
sample sets were tested for a total of 20 positive and 20 negative samples. Positive and
negative samples were purified in an alternating pattern, and the PCR reactions for the
positive and negative samples were set up in the order in which the samples were
processed. The frequency of false positive and uncertain results for the negative
samples was evaluated using the Flu A H3 assay as the representative assay from the
JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit.
All positive samples resulted in early Flu A H3 assay Cp values (< 23.00 cycles) and
robust F values (> 49.00). All negative samples produced negative results, with no
max
detectable Cp values. No carryover was observed in this evaluation. The test results are

Overall, sample purification and reaction setup in this carryover study resulted in no
false positive results when samples were processed in accordance with the purification
kit and reaction setup directions. PCR is a very sensitive technique and false positives
caused by contamination are a recognized risk. Users will be reminded that failure to
follow protocol and improper technique may result in false positive results.
j. Validation of Simulated Sample Matrices
Nasopharyngeal wash (NPW) and nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens are the two
sample matrices evaluated with the JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit and used for
most of the non-clinical evaluations. However, given the need for large numbers of
individual samples without influenza virus, simulated NPS (sNPS) and simulated
NPW (sNPW) samples were developed and validated to prevent inaccurate test results
arising from the presence of influenza viruses in human derived nasopharyngeal
specimens. Simulated samples were comprised of human HeLa cells diluted to
concentrations in viral transport medium (VTM) that produced similar Cp values as the
Flu SC assay produced when testing human derived NPS and NPW samples.
HeLa cell concentrations of 103.2 cells/mL and 104.3 cells/mL for sNPW and sNPS
sample matrix types, respectively, resulted in similar Cp values for the Flu SC assay as
human derived NPW and NPS specimens. To confirm that the simulated sample
matrix types did not have any advantageous or detrimental effects on the performance
of the system, multiple aliquots of simulated and human derived samples were spiked
at the LoD with a representative seasonal influenza A virus (H3N2 strain A/New
York/55/2004) and tested with the applicable influenza and control assays (Flu A, Flu A
H3, and Flu SC). Simulated and human derived samples exhibited equivalent rates of
detection. Mean Cp and F values were also comparable between the human derived
max
and simulated samples.

k. Co-spiked Specimen Validation
For efficient use of resources during non-clinical testing of the JBAIDS Influenza A &
B Detection and Influenza A Subtyping Kits, Influenza A H3N2 and Influenza B
viruses were co-spiked in some studies. Specifically, co-spiked samples were used in
the following analytic evaluations: Reproducibility, Sample Transport and Storage,
and Interfering Substances.
An analytical study was carried out to validate the use of specimens co-spiked with
Influenza A H3N2 and Influenza B viruses. This study was performed by evaluating
single-spiked and co-spiked samples containing Influenza A H3N2 A/New
York/55/2004 and/or Influenza B B/Ohio/01/2005. NPW specimens purified with the
Platinum Path kit were evaluated in this study because the Cp values for the Flu A
assay in NPW samples, purified with Platinum Path kit, were greater than Cp values
for the other sample type/purification kit combinations. The first part of this study
evaluated freshly collected NPW samples spiked with an influenza A H3N2 virus at
LoD only (single spike) or additionally spiked with influenza B virus at 500×LoD (co-
spiked). The second part of this study evaluated the opposite, NPW samples spiked
with influenza B virus at 1×LoD (single spike) or further spiked with influenza A
H3N2 at 500×LoD (co-spiked).
For each part of the study, 60 single and 60 co-spiked samples were prepared and
evaluated. In particular, pooled fresh NPW samples were spiked with virus at 1×LoD.
Half of this pool was co-spiked with the alternate virus at 500×LoD, resulting in one
single spiked pool and one co-spiked pool. Following spiking, the samples were
purified using the Platinum Path kit and then tested with appropriate freeze-dried
reagent test assays (Flu A, Flu B, and Flu A H3). A total of 240 samples were
evaluated.
For the samples spiked with influenza B at 1×LoD, all single (60) and co-spiked (60)
samples were detected with the Flu B assay. In addition, the influenza A H3N2 virus at
500×LoD was detected in 60/60 samples by the Flu A and Flu A H3 assays. These
results demonstrate that 100% detection was achieved for single (influenza B at
1×LoD) and co- spiked (influenza B at 1×LoD/ influenza A H3N2 at 500×LoD)
samples. For the Flu A assay, samples spiked with influenza A H3N2 at 1×LoD were
detected in 59/60 single- spiked and 58/60 co-spiked samples, resulting in 98.3 and
96.7% detection rates, respectively. For the Flu A H3 assay the same samples were
positive for 60/60 single- spiked and 59/60 co-spiked samples, resulting in 100 and
98.3% detection rates, respectively. In addition, the influenza B virus at 500×LoD was
detected in 60/60 samples by the Flu B assay.
Differences in mean Cp values between single- and co-spiked samples did not vary by
more than 0.19 cycles for the three assays, and mean F values for co-spiked samples
max
were reduced by less than 5% from mean F values for single-spiked samples. The
max
quantitative differences in mean Cp and F values between single- and co-spiked
max
samples were lower than the standard deviations for each assay and spike set.

--- Page 42 ---
The study results demonstrate that there is no significant quantitative or qualitative
difference between specimens single spiked or co-spiked with influenza B and
influenza A H3N2 viruses.
l. PCR followed by Bi-directional Sequencing Comparator Assays
The comparator assay for the JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit is PCR
followed bi-directional sequencing of amplicons. Comparator assays for the
JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit were designed by Idaho Technology and
validated with Limit of Detection (LoD) and reactivity studies.
The research and development group designed the Influenza A/H1, Influenza
A/H3, and the 2009 H1N1 Influenza assays such that they recognized
different locations on the hemagglutinin gene(s) than targeted by the
JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping assays.

m. Fresh vs. Frozen Specimen Study
The JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit includes assays for the detection of Influenza
A subtypes in NPS and NPW specimens collected from individuals exhibiting
influenza-like-illness. A prospective clinical evaluation of this test kit was performed
in order to establish the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the assays contained in
the JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit. The prospective clinical evaluation was
performed from December 2010 through April 2011 at five geographically diverse
locations. During this study, sufficient positive and negative samples were obtained to
establish the clinical sensitivity and specificity for detection of 2009 H1N1 Influenza

and Influenza A/H3 viruses. However, seasonal Influenza A/H1 did not circulate
during the trial period.
To account for the possibility that frozen archived samples might be required to
supplement the prospective clinical trial data, an analytical study was performed to
establish that the results obtained with frozen samples are equivalent to those obtained
when testing freshly collected NPS or NPW samples.
Pools of freshly collected NPS and NPW specimens were spiked at 100×LoD, 10×LoD,
3×LoD, and 1×LoD with a representative Influenza A/ H1 virus strain (A/New
Caledonia/20/1999). The spiked pools were then aliquoted. Samples that were to be
tested after freezing were aliquoted from each pool and stored at ≤ -70°C for at least
24 hours. The remainder of each pool was aliquoted for immediate analysis. Testing of
sample sets consisted of purifying individual aliquots with either the Platinum Path or
the MagNA Pure kits and assaying with the Influenza A subtyping assays. The
following table lists the number of samples tested at each virus concentration:
Virus Concentrations and Numbers of Fresh and Frozen Samples Evaluated

10×LoD 500 EID50/mL (6)
3×LoD 150 EID50/mL (24)
1×LoD 50 EID50/mL (24)
Successful validation of frozen samples required that the JBAIDS test results were
equivalent to the results obtained when testing freshly collected samples. Frozen
samples were considered acceptable to use in the clinical evaluation if the JBAIDS
results are at least 90% in agreement between fresh and frozen samples with a lower
95% CI bound of 86%. If this statistical confidence was not reached with 60 samples,
additional samples were evaluated. For informational purposes only, the crossing point
(Cp) and relative maximum fluorescence (F ) values were evaluated for the fresh and
max
frozen samples. Ideally the Cp values should not vary by more than 3 cycles and the
F values should not be more than 50% different between the two data sets. The 3
max
cycle Cp and 50% F differences allow for intrinsic system variability in JBAIDS
max
Influenza A Subtyping Kit. If the observed Cp and F differences were greater than
max
these, the data were reviewed to determine if using frozen samples interferes with
detection.
For the Flu A H1 assay, JBAIDS test results for fresh and frozen spiked NPS samples
were in 100% agreement (95% CI 96-100%). Test results for fresh and frozen NPW
samples were also in 100% agreement (95% CI 96-100%) for all virus spike levels.
More NPW samples were tested than originally planned due to a user error in which

samples were lost. While loading frozen NPW samples into the MagNA Pure kit, the
user mishandled four samples (two at 3×LoD and two at 1×LoD). Additional samples
were prepared and tested, both fresh and frozen, to replace the lost samples.
The Cp and F values were also compared between fresh and frozen NPS and NPW
max
samples. Differences between fresh and frozen Cp values ranged between 0.76 cycles
earlier and 0.80 cycles later for the Flu A H1 assay. Differences in F values in frozen
max
samples ranged from 23% less to 38% greater than fresh samples tested with the Flu A
H1 assay.
The results of this study demonstrate that there are no significant qualitative differences
between JBAIDS test results for fresh or frozen NPS and NPW samples spiked with
seasonal Influenza A H1N1 virus and evaluated with the Flu A H1 assay. Accurate test
results were obtained from fresh specimens as well as specimens that had been
subjected to freezing. The results of this study support the use of frozen archived
seasonal Influenza A H1N1 NPS and NPW samples to supplement the performance
claims of the JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Prospective Clinical study
The clinical performance of the JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit was established
during prospective studies at 5 geographically separated clinical study sites in the U.S.
The study sites were located in the West (Fairfield, CA, and San Diego, CA), the
Southwest (San Antonio, TX), the Midwest (Dayton, OH), and the Southeast
(Fayetteville, NC). NP swab or wash samples were collected and tested during the
2010/2011 influenza season (December 2010 to April 2011). Subjects with signs and
symptoms of influenza-like illness were invited to participate. Upon obtaining
informed consent, an NPW or NPS specimen was collected for JBAIDS and
comparator assay testing.
Written informed consent (or assent, if appropriate) was acquired from each subject
and/or their parent/guardian (if under 18) at the time of enrollment into the study. After
informed consent was acquired, the subject was assigned a Volunteer Identification
Number (VIN). The VIN was used to de-identify the specimen used for JBAIDS
testing and to provide data to the sponsor.

--- Page 47 ---
Patient specimens were divided into single use aliquots for testing immediately after
collection. Typically, one sample aliquot was placed at 4°C to be purified within one
day and tested using the JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit. Specimens collected on
Fridays were placed at < -15°C over the weekend and thawed for testing on Monday.
Aliquots for comparator testing were placed at < -15°C and sent to Idaho Technology,
Inc., on a weekly basis. Once received at Idaho Technology, the samples were placed
at < -70ºC until they were tested using the comparator assays.
Patient samples were purified using either the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path Purification Kit
(3 testing sites), or the Roche MagNA Pure Compact Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I in
conjunction with the Roche MagNA Pure Compact system (4 testing sites), and tested
with the JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit.
All samples were tested for Influenza A subtypes according to the instructions in the
clinical trial protocol. All collected samples, regardless of the Influenza A test result
generated by the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit, were tested with all assays
contained in the JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping kit. Frozen aliquots of NPS or NPW
specimens were shipped to ITI on a weekly basis for comparator PCR testing using the
CDC rRT-PCR Flu Panel Assays for Influenza A & B viruses, as well as additional
subtype-specific PCR assays followed by bi-directional sequencing of amplicons. Refer
to “PCR followed by Bi-directional Sequencing Comparator Assays” section for details
regarding assays targets and analytical validation results. Comparator PCR testing was
performed by ITI research associates in a blinded manner; specimens were labeled only
with the subject’s VIN and the JBAIDS test results were not available to them.
Specimen testing with the CDC rRT- PCR Flu Panel assays was performed in
accordance with the package insert. PCR followed by bi-directional sequencing
comparator assays were performed on all specimens that were tested positive for
Influenza A by the CDC rRT- PCR Flu Panel. Bi-directional sequence data was used to
verify the identity of each amplicon. “True” seasonal Influenza A/H1, seasonal
Influenza A/H3, and 2009 H1N1 Influenza positives, respectively, were considered as
any sample that had bi-directional sequencing data meeting pre-defined quality
acceptance criteria that matched seasonal Influenza A/H1, seasonal Influenza A/H3, or
2009 H1N1 Influenza sequences deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) GenBank database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), respectively, with
acceptable E-values.
The E-value ranges generated from the prospective clinical trial per Influenza A
subtype were presented in the following table:
Influenza A Subtype E-value Low E-value High
Influenza A/H11 N/A N/A
2009 H1N1 Influenza 2.28E-55 1.62E-35
Influenza A/H3 1.2E-133 5.25E-105
1 The seasonal Influenza A/H1 virus was not circulating during the 2010-2011 influenza season
(http://www.cdc.gov/flu/) and was not detected during the prospective clinical evaluation of the JBAIDS Influenza A
Subtyping Kit, except for 1 false positive A/H1 result.
A total of 269 runs were performed during the JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit
clinical trial and 261 (97.0%) JBAIDS runs were completed successfully. Of the 8
(3.0%) runs that failed to complete, 6 occurred due to a software defect. The remaining
2 instrument errors were due to a “case blower error” causing the run to abort. There

were a total of 9 (3.4%) additional runs in which the run controls (NCs and or PCs)
failed. Eight failures were associated with the Flu A H1 2009 NC and (or) PC, and one
additional failure occurred with the Flu A SW PC. All associated specimens were
retested and no specimens were lost due to these failures.
During the prospective clinical study, positive and negative nucleic acid extraction
controls (PEC and NEC, respectively) were processed with each batch of purification
specimens to ensure that the purification process was effectively performed. The PEC
was considered successful when all tested target assays were positive. A failed PEC
was retested using the same purified sample and the results of the retest were accepted
as the final result. If the retest was unsuccessful, all associated samples were considered
to have invalid results and required re-purification in order to obtain a valid test result.
During the clinical evaluation, 11 out of a total of 194 PECs required retesting. Nine
retests were required due to an invalid assay result (PC or NC). Two PEC failures
occurred as a result of one of the four target assays giving a negative result (Flu A H1
one time and Flu A H1 2009 one time). Retesting was performed for one of the failures
(Flu A H1 2009) which resolved the failure. There was no retest performed for the other
failure. This lack of retesting was a protocol deviation. Five (5) samples associated with
this run were excluded from analysis.
A total of 833 subjects were enrolled in the prospective study initially. Eighteen (18)
(2.2%) withdrew or were withdrawn from the study for various reasons, including
discrepancy in consent documents (n=7), patient refusing sample collection or
withdrawal from study (n=7), or improper specimen collection (n=4). Seven (7)
specimens were withdrawn from the study due to invalid testing results from the
comparator assay. Four (4) specimens were withdrawn due to a contamination event at
Site 5. An additional 4 samples were excluded due to inconclusive JBAIDS Influenza A
Subtyping Kit results. All data collected from these individuals were removed from the
study analyses. Five (5) additional specimens were removed from analysis due to a
batch control failure that was not retested. The remaining 795 subjects (483 NPW
specimens and 312 NPS specimens) were included in the demographic and clinical
performance analyses.
Of the 795 prospective specimens that were included in the clinical performance
analyses, 94% (751/795) of these specimens were successful on the first attempt (Site
1: 359/370 =97%; Site 2: 191/206 =93%; Site 3: 54/56 =96%; Site 4: 110/118 =93%;
Site 5: 37/45 =98%). The remaining 6% (44/795) required retesting: “Invalid” (32/44),
“Inconclusive” (11/44), and “Unsubtypeable” (1/44) (11 samples from Site 1; 15
samples from Site 2; 2 samples from Site 3; 8 sample from Site 4; and 8 sample from
Site 5). Forty (40) out of 44 samples resolved upon a 1st retest and the remaining 4
samples required a re-extraction and retest and resolved.

b. Retrospective Clinical study
The seasonal Influenza A/H1 virus was not circulating during the 2010-2011 influenza
season (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/) and was not detected during the prospective clinical
evaluation of the JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit, except for 1 false positive A/H1
result. Therefore, performance of the JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit testing
seasonal Influenza A/H1 could not be established during the prospective clinical study.
A retrospective clinical study was carried out at two different clinical sites to
supplement the prospective evaluation data by analyzing pre-selected, archived
specimens that were known to be positive for seasonal Influenza A/H1. Specimens
were evaluated using both the Platinum Path and MagNA Pure nucleic acid
purification kits.
A total of 56 NPS specimens were received for testing in this study. Thirty- five (35)

of the specimens had previously tested positive for seasonal Influenza A/H1. These
specimens were obtained from the CDC and were originally collected from medical
facilities and reference laboratories where they were previously tested by CDC and
FDA-cleared laboratory methods and found to contain seasonal Influenza A/H1. No
demographic information was available for these specimens. Specimens may have
experienced as many as three freeze/thaw cycles prior to this study. The specimens
were selected only for their previous test result; there was no effort to choose
specimens with specific analyte levels. An additional 21 Influenza A negative NPS
specimens from patients with respiratory illness, but known to be negative for
influenza, were obtained from ARUP Laboratories. Upon arrival at ITI, a 4-digit study
number (VIN) was assigned to each sample and a key was created in order to
randomize the specimens such that the users testing the samples were blinded as to the
expected test result. Specimens were divided approximately evenly for testing between
both purification kits.
Because it is possible that the provided samples had been misidentified or had
degraded during storage or previous handling, the presence or absence of the expected
analyte was confirmed using “validation” PCR assays. The validation PCR assays
were identical to the comparator assays that were used for the prospective clinical
evaluation study. Briefly, specimens were first evaluated with the CDC Human
Influenza Virus Real-time RT-PCR Detection and Characterization Panel (rRT-PCR
Flu Panel) for Influenza A and B. Specimens positive for Influenza A were then
subject to additional subtype-specific PCR, in this case using the comparator validation
assay used for the prospective clinical evaluation of the JBAIDS Influenza A
Subtyping Kit, an assay specifically designed to detect seasonal Influenza A/H1.
Positive PCR reactions for the seasonal Influenza A/H1 comparator validation assay
were analyzed using bi-directional sequencing for definitive confirmation. If this
validation testing did not confirm the presence or absence of the expected organism in
the sample, the sample was not analyzed further as this result may have reflected that
the sample had been improperly labeled or handled. Validation assay operators were
blinded as to the expected result for each sample. Validated specimens with confirmed
identities were then tested. Specimens were purified using either the Platinum Path or
MagNA Pure sample purification kits then analyzed with the JBAIDS. The Influenza
A/H1 assay from the JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit was run in a Custom Test
Method with the Influenza A (Flu A) and influenza sample control (Flu SC) assays
from the JBAIDS Influenza A & B Detection Kit.
Validation testing confirmed all 21 influenza-negative specimens and 30 of the 35
seasonal Influenza A/H1 samples. Validation PCR testing revealed that Ct values
ranged from 19.2 to 32.0 (median 25.1) out of 45 cycles, demonstrating that the
specimen population contained a diverse level of analyte. Half of the samples were
extracted using the Platinum Path purification kit and half using MagNA pure.
One (1) seasonal Influenza A/H1 sample did not have a valid test result due to SC
failure, and was excluded from data analysis. The remaining 29 seasonal Influenza A/H1
samples and the 21 influenza-negative specimens were included in the performance
analysis.
The following table presents the PPA and NPA for the archived clinical specimens.
Data from both extraction kits are combined due to identical performance.

c. Surrogate Clinical Specimen Testing for Seasonal Influenza A/H1
The seasonal Influenza A/H1 virus was not circulating during the 2010-2011 influenza
season (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/) and was not detected during the prospective clinical
evaluation of the JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit, except for one false positive
A/H1 result. In addition, archived clinical NPW samples that had previously tested
positive for the seasonal Influenza A/H1 virus were not available. Therefore, a clinical
study was performed to evaluate the performance of the JBAIDS Influenza A
Subtyping Kit using residual clinical NPS and NPW specimens spiked with a seasonal
Influenza A H1N1 strain.
One hundred thirty-six (136) surrogate seasonal Influenza A H1N1 NPS and NPW
clinical specimens (68 of each specimen type) were prepared using residual influenza-
negative specimens that were collected during the prospective clinical trial of the
JBAIDS influenza kits. These specimens had been previously evaluated with both the
JBAIDS as well as comparator assays and shown to be influenza- negative. Residual
specimens were spiked at ITI with a representative seasonal influenza A H1N1
(A/New Caledonia/20/1999) strain as follows:

A study number (VIN) was assigned to each sample and a key was created in order to
randomize the samples such that the users testing the samples were blinded as to the
expected test result. Frozen samples were then sent to 2 different clinical trial sites for
testing. Samples were purified using either the Platinum Path or MagNA Pure sample
purification kits, and then analyzed with the JBAIDS Flu A subtyping assays.
Of the 136 surrogate samples included in this study, a valid Influenza A test
result was obtained for 128 samples (62 NPW and 66 NPS). The remaining 8
samples with invalid Influenza A test results were not included in the
analysis.
The following table presents the PPA and NPA for the surrogate clinical specimens.
Half of the samples were extracted using the Platinum Path purification kit and half

N. Instrument Name:
Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) Instrument.
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The JBAIDS Instrument is used to perform real time reverse transcription, PCR
amplification and detection of nucleic acid. Three other nucleic acid amplification
tests that use the JBAIDS Instrument have received 510(k) clearance: JBAIDS
Anthrax Detection System (k051713), JBAIDS Plague Detection System (k072631),
JBAIDS Tularemia Detection System (k072547), JBAIDS Influenza A/H5 (Asian
Lineage) Detection Kit (k100287), and JBAIDS Q Fever Detection System (k103207).
The JBAIDS Instrument is a ruggedized, portable real-time PCR instrument designed
to withstand the conditions of transport and use likely to be encountered in a military
field laboratory. The instrument is comprised of an air thermocycler that amplifies
specific DNA sequences using PCR and a fluorimeter that measures fluorescence
signals associated with production of PCR product (amplicon) during the course of the
reaction. For thermocycling, samples contained in glass capillaries are placed in the
sample chamber where they are heated and cooled by the JBAIDS instrument.
The JBAIDS Software is preloaded on a ruggedized laptop computer. The software
controls the instrument’s thermal cycling functions, acquires the fluorescence data
from the instrument, and displays the fluorescence data for the user during the run.
When the run is finished, the software’s Detector module analyzes the data and
displays test results. The instrument and software have the ability to perform either
diagnostic (IVD) or surveillance (environmental) testing.

The IVD software includes the following diagnostic components:
• A traceable database that limits the data that the user can change in a test run and
that requires the user to enter change notes for any changes that are allowed.
• A Diagnostic Wizard that guides the operator through the process of setting up
the JBAIDS run in compliance with the package insert. IVD testing is always
performed using the Diagnostic Wizard and the traceable database. The wizard
initially presents to the operator a predefined selection of FDA cleared JBAIDS
IVD assays. JBAIDS assays under evaluation for FDA clearance are also
available in limited release software. Once the user has selected the IVD assays
to test, the Wizard guides the user through the process of setting up and loading
each PCR reaction into the instrument. The wizard requires each run to contain a
Positive Control and a Negative Control for each target included in the run as
well as the inclusion of additional controls (e.g., inhibition controls, sample
controls), when they are required.
• A Detector module that automatically analyzes the fluorescence amplification
curves and displays the final test results to the user. The Detector module ensures
that the correct rules are applied both to the interpretation of each amplification
curve and to the final interpretation (e.g., metacall), based on the results of the
samples and the relevant controls.
• A report certification that reflects the current regulatory status of the test being
performed. When an assay is being evaluated for FDA clearance, the JBAIDS
test report includes the statement ‘For Investigational Use Only. The
performance characteristics of this product have not been established.’ Once the
assay has received FDA clearance, the software is modified and the report
certification statement becomes ‘For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only’.

6. Quality Control:
The following controls are included in the JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit

--- Page 56 ---
Negative Control
The NC is used to detect contamination from target-specific amplified product
(amplicon), synthetic RNA (as found in the PC vials), or virus. The NC vial is
reconstituted using the purified negative extraction control (NEC) (molecular biology
grade water). The NEC should be processed along with each batch of specimens
purified. The NC detects possible contamination during sample purification and during
reconstitution of freeze- dried reagents. Each JBAIDS Influenza A Subtyping Kit run
requires one NC for each of the 4 assays (i.e., the Flu A H1, Flu A H3, Flu A H1 2009,
and Flu A Sw assays). For each target assay, the NC must be negative, or the JBAIDS
software will assign invalid results for that target assay to all of the samples in that run.
If the NC fails, the JBAIDS run must be repeated using the same purified samples. If
the NC fails again, all associated samples are considered to have invalid results and
should be re-purified starting from another aliquot of the original specimens.
Positive Control
The PC serves as an amplification and detection control. Each JBAIDS Influenza A
Subtyping Kit run requires one PC for each of the 4 assays (i.e., the Flu A H1, Flu A
H3, Flu A H1 2009, and Flu A Sw assays). For each target assay, the PC must be
positive. If the PC fails, the JBAIDS software will assign invalid results for that target
assay to all of the associated samples, and the JBAIDS run must be repeated starting
from the same purified specimens. Failure of the PCs may indicate errors in sample
setup, degradation of the reagents, or a malfunction of the JBAIDS instrument.
