L. Test Principle:
The normal function of a molecule of factor Xa, when present in plasma, is to cleave
its natural substrate, prothrombin, to generate thrombin. Thrombin is the enzyme
responsible for the formation of the fibrin clot. In the presence of heparin,
competition occurs between this mechanism and the inhibitory mechanism exerted by
the heparin-antithrombin complex. This inhibitory mechanism is largely responsible
for the anticoagulant action of heparin.
The proposed method is a one-step reaction based on a similar principle: as soon as
factor Xa is added to the plasma-substrate mixture, two reactions take place
simultaneously, namely,
– Hydrolysis of the substrate by factor Xa
– Inhibition of factor Xa by the heparin-antithrombin complex*.
After the necessary period of time for the competitive reaction to reach equilibrium,
the quantity of paranitroaniline that is released is inversely proportional to the
concentration of heparin present in the test medium.
* The heparin-antithrombin complex is made up from the heparin and the
antithrombin (AT) specific to the patient
.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility
Reproducibility and repeatability studies were performed using six human plasma
samples spiked with various known concentrations of UF and LMW heparin. All
samples are lyophilized human plasmas reconstituted. Samples 1, 2 and 3 were
spiked with UFH and samples 4, 5 and 6 were spiked with LMWH. Within each
run, the raw data results obtained were processed using one of two different
calibrators (3 or 5 point). Testing included using 2 different lots of the assay on
alternating days at two sites. Each sample was tested for 22 operating days, twice
a day with one operator at each of the two laboratory sites.
For repeatability (within-day precision), each sample was run twice a day for 22
days with one operator per site. The overall mean, SD and %CV were calculated
for each sample tested.
For reproducibility (between-run and total-run precision), for each day, two
separate runs were performed alternating two reagent lots of STA Liquid Anti Xa
6

--- Page 7 ---
on two analyzers (STA-R and STA Compact) with one operator at each site over
22 days.
The within-run, between-run and total-run performance was assessed. The mean
SD, %CV were calculated for each of the 6 samples tested. The overall %CV for
repeatability was <7 % and reproducibility was <10%. These results were within
the acceptance criteria of ≤12% for repeatability and ≤14% for reproducibility.

Sample 5-3pt 2.6 4.0
Sample 6-5pt 2.9 5.0
Sample 6-3pt 2.4 5.1
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Assay linearity was determined using separate WHO International LMW and
UF Heparin standards diluted with normal pooled plasma. The WHO
standards and normal pooled plasma were mixed and diluted to 5 levels of
concentration ranging from 0 to 1.10 IU/mL for UFH and 0 to 2.0 IU/mL for
LMWH. Each dilution level was analyzed 10 times on representative STA®
analyzers (STA-Compact®, STA-R® and STA Satellite®) with the STA-
Liquid Anti-Xa assay and the mean value was plotted against the expected
values. Results demonstrated acceptable linearity up to 1.10 IU/mL for UHF
and up to 2.0 IU/mL for LMWH on all the analyzers in the study.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Each lot of calibrator and control are prepared from citrated plasma, and are
traceable to the 2nd International WHO Standards 07/328 (established in 2009)
and 01/608 (established in 2003) for UFH and LMWH respectively.
Stability
A real-time stability study for STA-Liquid Anti-Xa heparin reagent was
performed using three lots of heparin reagent with four different control
samples and calibrators. Heparin reagents were tested at time zero and stored
at 2-8°C. Stability testing was conducted at 6, 12, 15 and 16 months with
LMWH and UFH controls and analyzed 10 times on STA-R® analyzer using
the stored reagents and calibrators. The mean results were compared to the
mean result at time zero with a maximum shift of <0.07 IU/mL which met the
acceptance criteria of <0.15 IU/mL. Real-time stability data are available for
up to 16 months and the study is ongoing to support a 24 month claim.

The accelerated stability study for STA-Quality NHF/UHF control and Multi
Hep Calibrator was performed on 3 lots at elevated temperature of 30°C for
21 days for estimating 24 month stability at 2-8°C. Overall change compared
to time zero at 3 weeks was <0.04 IU/mL which met the acceptance criteria of
< 0.10 IU/mL for the control and calibrators. Data supported a stability claim
of 24 months.
d. Detection limit:
Detection limit was determined by spiking each of 6 human plasma samples
with a known concentration (0.03-0.16 IU/mL) of UFH and LMWH. Testing
was performed on four replicates over 3 runs on 3 different STA® analyzers
(2-STA-R® and 1-STA Compact®) using 2 lots of Liquid Anti-Xa assay. The
detection limit was determined for each test lot using the calculation LoD =
LoB +cß SDs. The UFH detection threshold is 0.07 IU/mL and the LMWH
detection threshold is 0.10 IU/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were determined on the STA® instrument line (STA-R®,
STA-Satellite® and STA-Compact®) for STA-Liquid-Xa, STA-Multi Hep,
STA-Quality HNF/UFH and STA Quality HBPM/LMWH. Normal pooled
plasma was spiked with two levels of UFH and LMWH. Interferents were
spiked into the 2 levels of spiked UFH and LMWH plasma resulting in 5
concentrations and each concentration was tested five times. Acceptance
criterion was <0.25 IU/mL when compared to the un-spiked sample results.
The maximum tolerated concentrations were:
Interferents Max tolerated concentration
Hemoglobin 1.5 g/L
Unconjugated bilirubin 236 µmol/L or 138 mg/L
Conjugated bilirubin 342 µmol/L or 288 mg/L

f. Assay cut-off:
