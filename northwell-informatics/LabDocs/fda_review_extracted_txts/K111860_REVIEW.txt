L. Test Principle:
Following a >18 hour enrichment process in Lim broth, a 15 µL aliquot of the broth is used
for detection of the presence of GBS. The aliquot of the broth is mixed with BD MAX
Sample Preparation Reagent and processed using the BD MAX System. The BD MAX
System automates and integrates DNA extraction and concentration, reagent preparation, and
nucleic acid amplification and detection of the target sequence using real-time Polymerase
Chain Reaction (PCR). An internal process control is also incorporated into the lysis,
extraction, concentration and amplification steps to monitor for the presence of potential
inhibitory substances as well as system or reagent failures. No operator intervention is
necessary once the clinical sample is loaded onto the BD MAX System.
The BD MAX System uses a combination of lytic and extraction reagents to perform cell
lysis, DNA extraction and removal of inhibitors. Following cell lysis, with a combination of
heat and lytic enzymes, the released nucleic acids are captured by magnetic affinity beads.
The beads, with the bound nucleic acids, are washed and the nucleic acids are eluted using
release solution and prepared for PCR by addition of neutralization reagent. The BD MAX
System then uses the PCR-ready DNA solution to rehydrate a freeze-dried PCR pellet
containing all the reagents necessary for amplification of the GBS-specific target. The freeze-
dried PCR pellet also contains reagents to amplify a section of the process control sequence
to enable simultaneous amplification and detection of both target and control DNA
sequences. After reconstitution of the freeze-dried amplification reagents, the BD MAX
System dispenses the prepared PCR-ready solution into one lane (per specimen) of the BD
MAX PCR Cartridge. Microvalves in the BD MAX PCR Cartridge are sealed by the system
prior to initiation of PCR to prevent evaporation as well as amplicon contamination.
The amplified targets are detected in real time using Scorpions® chemistry- based fluorogenic
oligonucleotide probe molecules specific to the amplicons for the respective target. Scorpion
chemistry features a bi-functional molecule which includes a PCR primer covalently attached
to a probe. The Scorpion primers used in the BD MAX GBS Assay have a fluorophore and
quencher held together by an internal stem loop. First, the Scorpion primer is extended on the
target DNA. The extended primer is then heat-denatured, along with the stem loop of the
5

--- Page 6 ---
probe, thereby causing the quencher and the fluorophore to disassociate. Next, the extended
Scorpion primer is rearranged and binds to the newly extended DNA strand as it cools and
begins to fluoresce in a target-specific manner, while the un-extended primer is quenched.
The difference between Scorpion chemistry and other detection systems is that the probe and
primer are on the same molecule so that signal generation is through a uni-molecular
rearrangement, as opposed to a bimolecular collision. This results in extremely rapid signal
generation kinetics for Scorpion reactions.
A Scorpion probe labeled with a fluorophore (Ex: 490 nm & Em: 521nm) at the
5’ end, and a dark quencher at the 3’ end, is used to detect GBS DNA. For detection of the
internal process control, the Scorpion probe is labeled with an alternate fluorescent dye (Ex:
590 nm & Em: 610 nm) at the 5’ end, and a dark quencher at the 3’ end. The BD MAX
System monitors the fluorescent signal emitted by the Scorpion probes at the end of each
amplification cycle. When amplification is complete, the BD MAX System analyzes the data
and provides a final result.

Reproducibility Study
A Reproducibility study was performed using a panel of samples spiked at the GBS
concentrations described below. Each panel consisted of 20 samples which included
five replicates of four GBS concentrations. Samples for the study were prepared
internally at BD using Streptococcus agalactiae (ATCC strain 27956) and shipped
frozen to the testing sites. Samples were thawed and vortexed prior to testing. The
run panels were masked to the operators according to a designated randomization
scheme. Testing was performed at two external and one internal site using the 2nd
generation BD MAX system at each site. Six runs were performed over three days at
each of the three testing sites for a total of 360 samples tested. The results of the
studies are summarized in the tables below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. The BD MAX GBS Assay is a qualitative assay.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
External controls are not provided by the manufacturer. Commercially available
control material may be used or a > 18 hour GBS culture in Lim Broth may be
utilized as positive control material. GBS ATCC BAA-22 is a recommended strain to
use for a positive control. An uninoculated GBS Sample Preparation Reagent tube or
a 15 ul aliquot of pure Lim Broth is recommended for use as an external negative
control. External positive and negative controls were included in all analytical and
clinical studies performed in support of this submission. The External positive control
was prepared by diluting a GBS pellet to a concentration of 1500 CFU/assay. The
External negative control consisted of negative clinical matrix in Sample Preparation
Buffer without GBS.
An Internal Process Control (IPC) provided in each BD MAX GBS test. The IPC is
extracted, amplified and detected along with each specimen tested and monitors the
efficacy of the DNA extraction and PCR amplification processes.
d. Detection limit:
A study was performed to confirm that the BD MAX GBS assay as performed on the
2nd generation (6-channel) BD MAX instrument was able to achieve the LoD
demonstrated by the 1rst generation (2-channel) BD MAX instrument (200 CFU/mL
Sample Preparation Reagent or 300 CFU/assay). GBS suspensions at 200 CFU/mL
and 165 CFU/mL of Sample Preparation Reagent were prepared in negative clinical
matrix with 64 replicates, resulting in respective detection rates of 100% and 98%.
An LoD study was performed with a second GBS strain, resulting in an LoD of 160
CFU/mL Sample Preparation. All LoD testing confirmed that the LoD for the BD
MAX GBS Assay on the 2nd generation BD MAX is comparable to the LoD for the
assay on the 1rst generation system.
e. Analytical Inclusivity:
A total of 12 strains including 11 different serotypes and one non-hemolytic strain of
GBS were tested to demonstrate the ability of the BD MAX GBS assay to detect
clinically relevant variants. Eight samples per strain were prepared in Sample
10

--- Page 11 ---
Preparation Reagent and negative clinical matrix. The BD MAX GBS Assay run on
the 2nd Generation BD MAX System was able to detect all major serotypes of GBS
at 300 CFU/ml and 900 CFU/ml Sample Preparation Reagent.

(3/3), Proteus vulgaris (1/3), Providencia stuartii (1/3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa
(1/3), and Streptococcus pyogenes (1/3) initially gave positive results. One replicate
of human DNA gave a positive result.
An expanded study was conducted in which twenty replicates of each of the potential
cross-reactants were tested on the 2nd Generation BD MAX System. No reactivity
was observed with the C. albicans, D. radiodurans, L. jensenii, S. pyogenes or human
DNA samples. Five organisms continued to demonstrate cross-reactivity.

* The organisms indicated with an asterisk are gram negative. Lim broth enrichment is
designed to suppress growth of gram negative organisms.
g. Interference with Non-target Organisms:
A study was conducted to determine the effect of non-target organisms present in a
clinical specimen on the detection of GBS at low concentrations. Testing included the
127 non-target organisms tested in the cross-reactivity study as well as human DNA.
Samples were prepared in negative clinical Lim Broth matrix at high concentration
levels of the potential interferent mixed with suspensions of GBS at concentrations
near the LoD. Interference was initially observed with Achromobacter xerosis,
Haemophilus influenza and Enterobacter cloacae. For these three organisms, an
expanded study was performed which included additional testing of 20 replicates. No
interference was observed with A. xerosis and H. influenzae in this additional testing.
Interference (2/20 replicates) was observed in the presence of E. cloacae when tested
with a GBS target concentration of 300 CFU/mL of Sample Preparation Reagent.
h. Interference with Exogenous and Endogenous Substances
Potential exogenous and endogenous interfering substances that may be present in
clinical vaginal/rectal specimens were tested in an interference study and are listed in
the tables below. Samples were prepared in negative clinical Lim Broth matrix with
low concentrations of GBS and each potential interfering substance. To prepare the
spermicidal insert and the rectal suppository for evaluation, one insert or suppository
was added to 5 mL of non-clinical LIM broth. The remaining samples were prepared
by placing a swab of the exogenous interfering agent into 1 mL of negative clinical
matrix. Endogenous agents were tested in a negative clinical Lim Broth matrix at the
following concentrations: blood (10%), amniotic fluid (10%), urine (43%), human
DNA (1550 ng/assay), feces (small amount of feces on a swab in 1 ml of negative

i. Carry-Over and Cross Contamination Studies
Within run carry-over and cross-contamination using the BD MAX GBS Assay on
the 2nd Generation BD MAX System was evaluated by testing five consecutive runs
on the same instrument in which high positive and true negative samples were loaded
in alternating positions. No false positives or false negative results were observed in
this study.
Between run carry-over and cross-contamination using the BD MAX GBS Assay on
the 2nd Generation BD MAX System was evaluated by testing five consecutive runs
on the same instrument. Alternating runs consisted of all high positive samples and all
true negative samples. No false positives or negative results were observed in this
study.
Four runs of top/bottom PCR row testing were performed which included testing of
the TOP row of a cartridge with a following run of testing of the BOTTOM row of
the same cartridge. This study demonstrated no cross-contamination between
cartridge rows used in successive runs.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The performance of the BD MAX GBS Assay on the 2nd Generation BD MAX
System was evaluated in a comparison study performed at three testing sites, two
external and one internal. Testing consisted of 214 residual clinical Lim Broth
specimens with approximately equal numbers of positive and negatives. The Lim
Broth specimens were obtained from five clinical laboratories that had inoculated
each vaginal-rectal swab specimen in Lim Broth and then incubated overnight for >18
hours. An aliquot of each residual specimen was tested at two external sites and
internally at BD on 2nd Generation BD MAX systems. An aliquot of each specimen
was also tested internally at BD on three 1rst Generation BD MAX systems. Results

from three (3) New Systems (A, B, and C below) were evaluated and compared to
results generated from the same clinical panel tested on three (3) Old Systems (D, E,
and F below.) The GBS status of each sample was determined by the result generated
by the 1rst Generation BD MAX System. In the event of discordant or IND results,
the result generated by two of the three 1rst Generation instruments determined the
GBS status.
Decision Algorithm for 1rst Generation System Testing

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Approximately 25-40% of pregnant women are colonized with GBS. Culture screening of
both the vagina and rectum for GBS in late gestation, during prenatal care, can detect
women who are likely to be colonized with GBS at the time of delivery. In the
investigational study for the BD MAX GBS Assay on the 1st Generation BD MAX
System (K090191), the overall GBS prevalence rate as determined by culture was 23.0 %
(143/623) with a 95 % CI of 19.7 – 26.5 %.
N. Instrument Name:
BD MAX System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The 2nd generation BD MAX system fully automates cell lysis, nucleic acid extraction,
PCR set-up, target amplification and detection. The system can process and analyze up to
24 specimens in one cartridge with two cartridges running simultaneously on the
instrument. The system includes external and internal barcode reading, ensuring
traceability throughout extraction and PCR process. The system includes a heater
module, temperature sensors, and a fluorescence detection system with six optical
channels.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X____ or No ________

--- Page 20 ---
3. Specimen Identification:
Barcodes are used to identify patient specimens. The specimen rack is also has a barcode
to identify both specimen and assay.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
An aliquot of an overnight Lim Broth culture is manually added to a BD MAX GBS
Sample Preparation Reagent tube. The tube is then inserted into the DNA Unitized
Reagent Strip and placed on the BD MAX instrument. All further specimen handling is
automated.
5. Calibration:
The system is calibrated by the manufacturer on-site as part of the installation procedure
as well as during biannual preventive maintenance.
6. Quality Control:
An Internal Process Control (IPC) provided in each BD MAX GBS test. The IPC is
extracted, amplified and detected along with each specimen tested and monitors the
efficacy of the DNA extraction and PCR amplification processes.
External controls are not provided by the manufacturer. Commercially available control
material may be used or a > 18 hour GBS culture in Lim Broth may be utilized as
positive control material. GBS ATCC BAA-22 is a recommended strain to use for a
positive control. An uninoculated GBS Sample Preparation Reagent tube or a 15 ul
aliquot of pure Lim Broth is recommended for use as an external negative control.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Not Applicable
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
