510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
k111869
B. Purpose for Submission:
New device
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., Virtuoso System for PR (1E2)
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Computer-assisted image analysis scoring and manual scoring of digital images of PR
(progesterone receptor) immunohistochemistry stained slides.
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Virtuoso™ System is an instrument-plus-software system designed to assist
the qualified pathologist in the consistent assessment of protein expression in
immunohistochemically stained histologic sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded normal and neoplastic tissues.
The system consists of a slide scanner (iScan), computer, monitor, keyboard,
mouse, image analysis algorithms for specific immunohistochemical markers, and
software with a Windows web browser-based user interface. Virtuoso is a web-
based, end-to-end, digital pathology software solution that allows pathology
laboratories to acquire, manage, view, analyze, share, and report digital images of
pathology specimens. Using the Virtuoso software, the pathologist can view
digital images, add annotations, make measurements, perform image analysis, and
generate reports.
The Digital Read option allows the pathologist to score the PR stained slide’s
digital image on a computer monitor. In the Image Analysis Application option,
slides are scored by the PR image analysis application. This score is then
presented on the computer screen. The pathologist verifies this score and
confirms it.
Hardware: The iScan slide scanning device captures digital images of formalin-
fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues that are suitable for storage and viewing. The
device includes a digital slide scanner, racks for loading glass slides, computer,
scanner software, keyboard, mouse and monitor.
Software: The Virtuoso software is designed to complement the routine workflow
of a qualified pathologist in the review of immunohistochemically stained
histologic slides. It allows the user to select fields of view (FOVs) in the digital
image for analysis and provides quantitative data on these FOVs to assist with
interpretation. The software makes no independent interpretations of the data and
requires competent human intervention for all steps in the analysis process.
2. Principles of Operation:
The Virtuoso System for PR (1E2) employs image analysis techniques and pre-
defined parameters to obtain PR scores. The identification of the nuclei and
1

--- Page 2 ---
membrane are carried out automatically by the image analysis algorithms. The
steps involved in the analysis algorithms are:
a. Area of Interest (AOI) identification: The algorithm separates the tissue
area from the background within the selected FOV such that only the tissue
area is processed in the following steps.
b. Seed Generation: The algorithm generates seed pixels within the AOI where
candidate tumor cells exist.
c. Segmentation: This processing step consists of using the seeds to extract the
objects of interest from the image. The objects of interest are epithelial cell
nuclei and the membranes around them. The objects of interest are detected,
starting at the seeds, and are separated from the rest of the identified objects
using morphological properties, such as size and shape.
d. Classification: The segmented cells are classified as stained cell membranes
or non-stained cell membranes, based on the percentage of stained pixels
within the membrane. Further, the stained cells are identified as completely
stained or partially stained.
e. Scoring/Grading: Based on the classification, an overall score for the image
is computed using the numbers of stained cells, non-stained cells, and total
cells for the calculations. The score assigned is based on the guidelines
indicated in the package insert for PR (1E2).
3. Modes of Operation:
a. Manual scoring of immunohistochemically (IHC) PR stained slide images on
a computer monitor (digital read).
b. Computer scoring of IHC PR stained slide images performed by PR Image
Analysis Application. This score is verified by the pathologist.
4. Specimen Identification:
Glass tissue slides are identified by slide label or barcode (if provided by the user)
by scanning the whole slide including the label or barcode.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
IHC stained slides manually loaded on to the iSCAN Coreo slide scanner
individually or in slide racks. The slide racks hold a maximum of 160 slides.
Under the default setting a thumbnail view of the slide and the area of interest
(AOI) in the slide is scanned. The operator has the option of rescanning the slide
after viewing the image on the computer monitor. Under the manual scanning
option, the user has the ability to select the scan area for single or batch slides.
6. Calibration:
The iSCAN Coreo contains a diagnostics module that can be run by the user.
This application tests the scanner hardware components and functions. These
tests must be run with nine custom slides calibrated for the module which can be
obtained from the sponsor.
7. Quality Control:
Quality control is performed by the operator before releasing the images to the
pathologist for review. Slides with sub-optimal images will be rescanned.

Antibody assay. The CONFIRM™ anti-Progesterone Receptor (PR) (1E2)
Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody assay is indicated for use as an aid in the
assessment of breast cancer patients for whom endocrine treatment is being
considered (but is not the sole basis for treatment).
Note: The IHC PR (1E2) Digital Read and Image Analysis applications are
adjunctive computer-assisted methodologies for the qualified pathologist in the
acquisition and measurement of images from microscope glass slides of breast
cancer specimens stained for the presence of PR protein. The pathologist should
verify agreement with the Image Analysis software application score. The
accuracy of the test results depends on the quality of the immunohistochemical
staining. It is the responsibility of a qualified pathologist to employ appropriate
morphological studies and controls as specified in the instructions for the
CONFIRM™ anti-Progesterone Receptor (PR) (1E2) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary
Antibody assay used to assure the validity of the iScan System for IHC PR Digital

J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
The performance of the Virtuoso System for IHC PR (1E2) was validated via two
studies. The first study evaluated overall system performance in terms of: (1)
agreement between the reference manual method (with a traditional microscope) and
both the digital read (DR) and image analysis (IA) applications of the Virtuoso
system, (2) intra-pathologist/inter-day reproducibility of DR and IA Virtuoso
applications, and (3) inter-pathologist reproducibility of the DR and IA Virtuoso
applications. These studies were conducted in 3 different sites.
In the second study, scanner precision was evaluated as follows: A subset of the
clinical cases (n = 40) was scanned two more times with two different scanners at two

separate locations. This study evaluated scanner precision of the image analysis
application only for both inter-scanner precision and intra-scanner/inter-day
precision, as it generates an instrument-generated PR score that is not affected by
memory bias as would be the case with human interpretations.
a. Accuracy:
This study was conducted in 3 sites with one pathologist at each site. There were
120 specimens in this study. Slides were excluded from analysis for the following
reasons: out of focus image, staining artifacts, scant or no invasive carcinoma and
non-scoring of slides. The number of slides that were analyzed (n) per site is
given in the tables below. All pathologists read all the slides under the three
different modes – manual, digital read and Image analysis scoring. The data were
categorized as “negative” and “positive” using PR scoring criteria of less than 1%
of tumor cells staining as negative and 1% or more tumor cells staining as
positive. The acceptance criterion of an overall agreement rate of at least 75%
was set by the sponsor. This was met in all the studies. The percent agreements
across the 3 sites with the 95% confidence intervals (CI) around the agreements
are shown below.

Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility of the device was assessed during 3 slide reading sessions. A slide
reading session consisted of pathologists conducting a digital read (DR) or image
analysis (IA) of all 40 slides. There was a 7-day wash-out period between slide
reading sessions. One slide could not be evaluated in sessions 2 and 3 because the
image was out of focus. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion was an agreement of
≥75% between each of the three reading sessions (Session 1 vs. Session 2, Session 1
vs. Session 3, and Session 2 vs. Session 3) for the Virtuoso digital read (DR)
application for the intra-pathologist/inter-day scoring performance (maximum n =
40). The same criterion was established for the Virtuoso image analysis application
(IA) (maximum n = 40). Concordance was analyzed based upon the clinical
assessment of negative (<1% tumor cells staining) and positive (≥1% tumor cells
staining). Reproducibility was also evaluated for the inter-pathologist variable by
comparing the concordance data in a pair-wise manner between Site 1 vs. Site 2,
Site 1 vs. Site 3, and Site 2 vs. Site 3. This was done for both DR and IA, and used
the same 75% acceptance criterion. The agreement rate set by sponsor was met in
all these studies.

Precision:
This study evaluated scanner precision of the image analysis application.
The scanner precision study utilized a randomly selected subset of 40
cases from the accuracy study. The clinical cases spanned the range of the
PR scoring categories of <1%, 1-10%, >10% tumor cells staining in
roughly equal numbers, and the slides were stained with both universal
DAB detection kits (iVIEW and ultraView). A subset of the clinical cases
(n = 40) was scanned two more times with two different scanners at two
separate locations. The data were analyzed at the 1% (negative) and ≥1%
levels and at the <1%, 1-10%, >10% tumor cell staining levels. The iScan
scanner was evaluated for inter-site and intra-site/inter-day precision. The
acceptance criterion of a minimum of 85% agreement rate that was set by
the sponsor was met in these studies.
