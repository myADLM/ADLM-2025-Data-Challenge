510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
k111872
B. Purpose for Submission:
New device
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., Virtuoso™ System for IHC p53 (DO-7)
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Computer-assisted image analysis (IA) scoring and manual scoring of digital images
(DR) of p53 immunohistochemistry stained slides.
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Virtuoso™ System is an instrument-plus-software system designed to assist
the qualified pathologist in the consistent assessment of protein expression in
immunohistochemically stained histologic sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded normal and neoplastic tissues.
Hardware: The iScan slide scanning device captures digital images of formalin-
fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues that are suitable for storage and viewing. The
device includes a digital slide scanner, racks for loading glass slides, computer,
scanner software, keyboard, mouse and monitor.
Software: The Virtuoso software is designed to aid the qualified pathologist in the
review of immunohistochemically stained histologic slides. It is a web-based,
end-to-end, digital pathology software solution that allows pathology laboratories
to acquire, manage, view, analyze, share, and report digital images of pathology
specimen slides. Using the Virtuoso software, the pathologist can view digital
images, add annotations, make measurements, perform image analysis, and
generate reports. It allows the user to select fields of view (FOVs) in the digital
image for analysis and provides quantitative data on these FOVs to assist with
interpretation. Results are reported by a qualified pathologist as semi-quantitative
scores. The software makes no independent interpretations of the data and
requires competent human intervention for all steps in the analysis process.
a. The Virtuoso™ System for IHC p53 (DO-7) consists of a slide scanner (iScan
Coreo Au), computer, monitor, keyboard, mouse, image analysis algorithms
for IHC p53 (DO-7) and software with a Windows web browser-based user

interface. The Digital Read option allows the pathologist to score the p53
stained slide digital image on a computer monitor. In the Image Analysis
Application option, slides are scored by the p53 image analysis application
and presented on the computer screen. The pathologist verifies this score and
confirms it.
2. Principles of Operation:
The Virtuoso™ System for p53 (DO-7) employs image analysis and pre-defined
parameters to obtain p53 staining scores. The identification of the nucleus is
carried out automatically by the image analysis algorithms. The steps involved in
the analysis algorithms are:
a. Image Enhancement: The image is enhanced by increasing the contrast to
make it more suitable for analysis.
b. Identification of the Epithelial Area: The algorithm identifies the epithelial
area which is the area where there is a possibility of epithelial cells being
present. This area is used in the subsequent analysis steps.
c. Identification of the Nucleus: The nuclei in the epithelial area are identified.
d. Classification: Cells are classified based on the extent, intensity and thickness
of nuclear staining.
e. Scoring: Based on the classification, an overall score for the image is
computed using the numbers of stained cells, non-stained cells, and total cells
for the calculations. Based on this score, test results are classified as negative
(≤10% of cells staining) or positive (>10% cells staining).
3. Modes of Operation:
a. Manual scoring of immunohistochemically (IHC) p53 stained slide images on
a computer monitor (digital read).
b. Computer scoring of IHC p53 stained slide images performed by p53 (DO-7)
Image Analysis Application. This score is verified by the pathologist.
4. Specimen Identification:
Glass tissue slides are identified by slide label or barcode (if provided by the user)
by scanning the whole slide including the label or barcode.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Breast cancer tissue section slides that are stained with the anti-p53 antibody IHC
stain on the Benchmark XT IHC stainer using either the iView or the UltraView
detection system are analyzed on this system. p53 IHC stained slides are
manually loaded on to the iScan Coreo Au slide scanner individually or in slide
racks. The slide racks hold a maximum of 160 slides. Under the default setting a
thumbnail view of the slide and the area of interest (AOI) in the slide is scanned.
The operator has the option of rescanning the slide after viewing the image on the
computer monitor. Under the manual scanning option, the user has the ability to
select the scan area for single or batched slides.

6. Calibration:
The iScan Coreo Au contains a diagnostics module that can be run by the user.
This application tests the scanner hardware components and functions. These
tests must be run with nine custom slides calibrated for the module which can be
obtained from the sponsor.
7. Quality Control:
The slides selected for analysis on this device must have optimum IHC staining
quality such as optimal staining intensity, minimal to no background staining, etc.
Slides with sub optimal staining should be restained.
Quality control is performed on slide images by the operator. Slides with sub-
optimal images (out of focus images, etc.) should be rescanned. The image
quality assessment module also performs an image quality assessment of the areas
in the digital images marked by the pathologist for analysis. Measures of color,
contrast and sharpness of images are used to report the quality of the images as
good, average or poor to the user. Analysis of the images is performed regardless
of the image quality. Images with poor quality can be automatically rejected by
the pathologist through customer-specific settings. In all cases, the pathologist is
provided with feedback from the quality algorithm, and if the pathologist
determines that the results of the analysis are reasonable, he/she can accept it or
reject it. If rejected, alternate areas on the slide or a new slide may be selected for
analysis.

J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
The performance of the Virtuoso™ System for p53 (DO-7) was validated via two
studies. The first study evaluated overall system performance in terms of: (1)
agreement between the reference manual method (with a traditional microscope) and
both the digital read (DR) and image analysis (IA) applications of the Virtuoso
system, (2) intra-pathologist/inter-day reproducibility of DR and IA Virtuoso
applications, and (3) inter-pathologist reproducibility of the DR and IA Virtuoso
applications. These studies were conducted in 3 different sites.
In the second study, scanner precision was evaluated in an isolated fashion via a
cross-over design from the primary study. A subset of the clinical cases (n = 40) was
scanned two more times with two different scanners at two separate locations. This
study evaluated scanner precision of the IA application only for both inter-scanner
precision and intra-scanner/inter-day precision. The IA generates an instrument-
generated p53 score that is not affected by memory bias as would be the case with
human interpretations.

a. Accuracy:
This study was initially conducted in 3 sites with one pathologist at each site.
There were 120 specimens included in this study. Slides were excluded from
analysis for the following reasons: out of focus image, staining artifacts and scant
or no invasive carcinoma. All pathologists read all the slides under the three
different modes – manual, DR and IA scoring. There was a wash-out period of 7
days between reads with each different modality. The data were categorized as
“negative” and “positive” using p53 scoring criteria as follows: ≤10% of cells
staining as Negative and >10% cells staining as Positive. The acceptance criteria
of 75% or above agreement rates were set by the sponsor. Due to the inherent
variability that is present in the manual method of scoring these slides, FDA
requested that the sponsor perform the same study at an additional study site (site
4). This additional study site had one pathologist who read all the slides under the
three different modes as above. All other study criteria were the same as above.
In the study comparing DR scoring to manual read and in the study comparing IA
scoring to the manual method the acceptance criteria were met in at least three
sites. The percent agreements across the 4 sites with the 95% confidence intervals
(CI) around the agreements are shown below.

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility
Reproducibility of the device was assessed during slide reading sessions. A
slide reading session consisted of pathologists conducting a digital read (DR) or
image analysis (IA) of all 40 slides. There was a 7-day wash-out period
between slide reading sessions. An agreement of ≥75% between each of the
three reading sessions (Session 1 vs. Session 2, Session 1 vs. Session 3, and
Session 2 vs. Session 3) for the Virtuoso digital read (DR) application was set
by the sponsor for the intra-pathologist/inter-day scoring performance. The
same criterion was established for the Virtuoso image analysis application (IA).
Agreement was analyzed based upon the following score classification: ≤10%
of cells staining = Negative and >10% cells staining as Positive. The agreement
rate set by the sponsor was met in each study.

Scanner Precision
This study evaluated scanner precision of the image analysis application. The
scanner precision study was designed to assess the performance of the Virtuoso
system’s scanner (iScan) in isolation from other variables. This study utilized a
randomly selected subset of 40 cases from the accuracy study. The study cases
included the p53 staining of 0-0.99%, 1-10%, and >10% of cells staining
positive. The slides were stained with both universal DAB detection kits
(iVIEW and ultraView). The same three FOV’s were scanned and analyzed
each time by the IA application. These 40 cases were scanned two more times
on two different days with two different scanners at two separate locations to
assess intra-scanner/inter-day precision. The acceptance criterion set by the
sponsor of a minimum of 85% agreement rate was met in these studies.
