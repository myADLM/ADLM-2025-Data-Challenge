L. Test Principle:
The FreeStyle InsuLinx Meter, in conjunction with FreeStyle InsuLinx Test Strips,
utilizes coulometric biosensor technology to quantitatively measure the glucose
concentration in whole blood samples and in FreeStyle Control Solutions. The
FreeStyle InsuLinx Meter measures glucose electrochemically. The glucose
biosensor is capable of recognizing the glucose present in whole blood or control
solutions by virtue of the glucose specificity of the enzyme glucose dehydrogenase
(GDH) present on the glucose test strip. The electrons liberated by this reaction are
transferred via a co-factor and mediator to the meter where they are read as a small
electrical current. The current is integrated over the analysis time to generate charge
which is directly proportional to the level of the glucose in the applied sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

System is the renamed brand name for “FreeStyle Lite Test Strip” which was
cleared under k092602. The test strip stability was assessed in real time study.
The testing supports the claimed shelf life of 24 months when stored at 4-
30°C in desiccated vials.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range is 20 to 500 mg/dL based on linearity/reportable range
studies above (section M.1.b.).
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed interference studies with spiked venous blood samples
at two glucose concentrations (100 and 300 mg/dL) that were prepared and
divided into a test (dosed) pool and a control pool. Studies were conducted
using three FreeStyle InsuLinx Blood Glucose Meters and three lots of test
strips. Significant interference is defined as a bias ≥ 10 % from the control
group as measured on YSI 2300 analyzer. The sponsor claims no significant
interference (≤ 10% difference) for the substances and concentrations shown
in the table below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor conducted a combined accuracy and consumer study at two sites
with trained operators and a total of 146 lay-users. Each lay user participant
performed their own finger stick and tested their blood on the FreeStyle
InsuLinx Blood Glucose meter using only the instructions in the Owner’s
Booklet and test strip insert. A trained operator then performed a second finger
stick and tested the blood on the same meter. A whole blood sample from the
subject’s fingertip was collected by the trained operator for hematocrit
determination and analysis on the YSI 2300 analyzer. The total range of
samples tested was 33 to 471 mg/dL for lay users and 30 to 495 mg/dL for
trained operators. Seven altered samples were tested by trained operators only.
Linear regression results are presented below:
Linear Regression Analysis:
Lay user vs. YSI y = 1.00x + 2.7, r = 0.990, n = 146
Professional vs. YSI y = 1.03x + 0.7, r = 0.995, n = 153
The study results met the ISO 15197 accuracy criteria where ninety-five
percent (95%) of the individual glucose results fell within ±15mg/dL of the
YSI results at glucose concentrations <75mg/dL and within ±20% at glucose
concentrations ≥75mg/dL.

whole blood from the fingertip, which is directly applied to the test strip.
5. Calibration:
The FreeStyle InsuLinx meter is programmed with a predetermined calibration
slope and intercept of the FreeStyle Lite Blood Glucose Test Strip and therefore
does not require user interface coding activities. The FreeStyle InsuLinx meter
does not require coding of the device.
6. Quality Control:
The FreeStyle Control Solutions were previously cleared under k013147. There
are three levels of Control Solution; Low (40 to 70 mg/dL), Medium (83 to 125
mg/dL) and High (248 to 372 mg/dL). The control ranges are listed on the test
strip vial.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. A usability study was performed to assess the readability of the labeling by 146
U.S. lay users (aged 19-81 yrs old) who were provided with the test kit containing
labeling in English for the US market. Participants varied in age, education, and
were evenly divided between men and women. These lay users also completed a
questionnaire to indicate whether the device is easy to use and the instructions for
use were written in a way that makes it easy to use.
8

--- Page 9 ---
2. Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the results showed that
the labeling Owner’s Booklet and test strip package insert were written at less
than an 8th grade level.
3. A sample volume study was performed to verify the test strip sample volume
requirement and the test strip fill error requirement established for the FreeStyle
InsuLinx Blood Glucose meter. Whole blood adjusted to three glucose
concentrations (48, 105 and 400 mg/dL) were measured with three meters and
two test strip lots. Protocols and acceptance criteria were provided and found to
be acceptable. Insufficient volume of less than 0.3 µL will not produce a result.
4. Infection Control studies: The FreeStyle InsuLinx Blood Glucose Monitoring
System is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were
performed on the materials comprising the meter by an outside commercial
testing facility demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV)
with the chosen disinfectant, Dispatch Hospital Cleaner Disinfectant Towels with
Bleach (EPA Reg. No: 56392-8). Robustness studies were performed by the
sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external
materials for the meter and lancing device after 522 cleanings and 522
disinfection steps with Dispatch Hospital Cleaner Disinfectant Towels. The
robustness studies were designed to simulate 5 years of single-patient use.
Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and
disinfection procedures.
5. The data transmission capability, data transmission port, software and USB
connection cable was evaluated in usability study and found to be acceptable.
Additionally, verification and validation of these functions were conducted and
found to be acceptable.
6. A test certificate for EMC testing and compliance with the relevant regulations
was issued by Elliott Laboratories on February 9, 2011.
7. Hematocrit Study: The effect of different hematocrit levels on the accuracy of the
device was evaluated on the FreeStyle InsuLinx Blood Glucose Monitoring
System with ten meters and three test strip lots. Venous blood samples at seven
hematocrit levels (15, 20, 25, 40, 55, 60 and 65%) were adjusted to five
concentrations of glucose of 47, 113, 217, 341 and 453 mg/dL. Results of samples
at each hematocrit level (N=30) were compared to samples with the same glucose
concentration at normal (40%) hematocrit as well as to the corresponding YSI
value. All individual results for each meter were within ±15% of the YSI,
supporting the claimed hematocrit range of 15 to 65%.
8. Altitude Study: A venous blood sample was adjusted to three different glucose
concentrations (48, 105 and 400 mg/dL). Each venous blood sample was tested
using ten meters and three lots of test strips. Tests were performed at two
elevations (sea level and 10,742 feet). All individual results for each meter were
9

--- Page 10 ---
within ±10% of the YSI, supporting the claimed altitude range of up to 10,000
feet for the glucose meter.
9. The sponsor claims an operating condition range of 4 to 40oC (40 to 104oF) and 5
to 90% relative humidity. Combinations of the claimed temperature and humidity
operating conditions were evaluated by measuring whole blood samples at target
glucose concentrations of 45, 100, and 400 mg/dL and comparing the meter
results to a reference method. The results demonstrated that the system produces
accurate results over the claimed range of operating conditions.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
