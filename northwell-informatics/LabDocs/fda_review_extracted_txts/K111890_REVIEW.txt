FORA Diamond Prima Blood Glucose Monitoring System and FORA Diamond Mini
Blood Glucose Monitoring System consist of three main components: the meter, test
strips and control solutions. These products have been designed, tested, and proven to
work together as a system to produce accurate blood glucose test results. Use only FORA
test strips and FORA control solutions (cleared under k093724) with the FORA Diamond
Prima Blood Glucose Monitoring System and FORA Diamond Mini Blood Glucose
Monitoring System.
The blood glucose detection method and measurement is by an electrochemical biosensor
technology using FAD-dependent glucose dehydrogenase (FAD-GDH).
The two blood glucose systems have the same technical components although the FORA
Diamond Mini Blood Glucose is smaller in size and does not have the test strip ejector,
ketone warning function and does not have the capacity to perform daily averaging of
measurements. However, they use the same test strips.

L. Test Principle:
FORA Diamond Prima and FORA Diamond Mini Blood Glucose meters, in
conjunction with the same test trips, utilize amperometric technology to quantitatively
measure the glucose concentration in whole blood samples and in control solutions. A
glucose dehydrogenase sensor based on the carbon electrode adopting the
amperometric assay utilizes the enzyme glucose dehydrogenase to catalyze the
formation of gluconolactone from the oxidation of glucose whereby two electrons are
produced. Through the mechanism of the mediator, electrical current is generated and
it is proportional to the quantity of glucose in the sample.
The reaction principle of reagent depends on following reaction equation:
GDH, FAD
Glucose + 2 ferricyanide = gluconolactone + 2 ferrocyanide
electrode
ferrocyanide = ferricyanide + e-
GDH: glucose dehydrogenase
FAD: flavin adenine dinucleotide
The glucose biosensors recognize the glucose present in whole blood or control
solutions by virtue of the specificity of the enzyme FAD dependent glucose
dehydrogenase (GDH) present on the test strip. The electrons liberated by this
reaction are transferred via a co-factor and mediator to the meter where they are read
as a small electrical current. The magnitude of the resultant current is proportional to
the concentration of glucose in the specimen and the signal is converted into a readout
displayed on the meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:

e. Analytical specificity:
The following protocol was applied to both FORA Diamond Prima Blood Glucose
Monitoring System and FORA Diamond Mini Blood Glucose Monitoring System
respectively.
The sponsor indicated that the interference study protocol was developed according to
CLSI EP 7-A2. Venous blood was obtained from fasting subjects and collected in a
heparin-Na (sodium heparin) vacutainer tube (Hct around 45%). Two concentrations of
glucose were adjusted to 70 mg/dL (low) and 150 mg/dL (high) using the YSI 2300 as a
reference instrument. The glucose samples were spiked with the potentially interfering
compounds equivalent to the highest therapeutic dosage and toxic level (or ten times the
highest therapeutic concentrations when toxic levels were not known), and tested on 3
lots of test strips. Bias was calculated as the mean percent difference in glucose reading
between the test and control concentration groups. All samples tested showed % bias
within ± 10% between the test and the control groups. For both FORA Diamond Prima
Blood Glucose Monitoring System and FORA Diamond Mini Blood Glucose Monitoring
System, the sponsor claims no significant interference (≤ 10% difference) for the
substances and concentrations shown in the table below:

The sponsor has the following limitations in their labeling of both FORA Diamond
Prima Blood Glucose Monitoring System and FORA Diamond Mini Blood Glucose
Monitoring System:
Xylose : Do not test blood glucose during or soon after an absorption test. Xylose
can give falsely elevated results.
There is no significant interference (≤ 10%) in the presence of galactose, maltose,
fructose or mannitol observed in blood glucose tests as demonstrated in studies up
to 1,000 mg/dL
Lipemic Effects: Blood triglycerides up to 2000 mg/dL (22.8 mmol/L) do not
affect the results significantly (≤ 10%), but may affect results at higher levels.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor conducted an accuracy study at three hospital sites. Trained
professionals obtained 180 samples from diabetic and non-diabetic outpatient
participants. The range of glucose values tested was 37-503 mg/dL for Diamond
Prima and 37~493 mg/dL for Diamond Mini BGMS. In order to obtain
sufficient samples in the lowest and highest concentration intervals, 12 venous
samples were obtained and either allowed to glycolyze to obtain low values or
spiked with additional glucose. Samples that were <50 mg/dL and >400 mg/dL
were contrived samples and samples between 50 to 440 mg/dL were natural
capillary samples from the fingertip.

(cleared under k093724). Recommendations on when to test the control materials are
provided in the labeling. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test
strip vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside
these ranges
P. Other Supportive Device and Instrument Information:
1. Hematocrit Study
The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated with one test strip lot and 10
FORA Diamond Prima Blood Glucose meters and 10 FORA Diamond Mini Blood
Glucose Monitoring meters respectively. In both cases, blood samples at six glucose
concentrations (20-30, 50-80, 100-150, 200-250, 350-400and 550-600 mg/dL) were
analyzed. The glucose samples were prepared from venous blood at 10 diifferent
hematocrit levels (20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60 and 65%). Glucose results for each
concentration and hematocrit level were compared to samples tested on the YSI reference
method.
The data supports the sponsor’s claim that hematocrit in the range of 20%-60% does not
significantly interfere (more than ± 15%) with glucose measurements using both test
system.
2. Altitude:
A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of altitude up to15,000 feet on performance
of the FORA Diamond Prima Blood Glucose Monitoring System and FORA Diamond
Mini Blood Glucose Monitoring System using a glove box system which simulates 4
elevations from sea level to 15,000 feet (4500 meters). Venous whole blood samples at
five glucose concentrations ranging from 50-600 mg/dL were tested at four altitudes
using three lots of test strips and 4 FORA Diamond Prima Blood Glucose meters and
FORA Diamond Mini Blood Glucose meters respectively. Each sample was also
evaluated by the YSI method. At altitudes up to 15,000 feet, test results were within +/-
10% of YSI values for both meters.
3. Test system operating conditions:
Studies were performed using four FORA Diamond Prima Blood Glucose meters and
four FORA Diamond Mini Blood Glucose meters respectively with three lots of test
strips, and three venous whole blood samples with glucose concentrations of 64.2, 124
and 318 mg/dL. Testing was performed at various conditions in the claimed conditions
50-104°F (10-40°C) and at a relative humidity from 20-85% and results compared to the
reference YSI. There were no significant differences in glucose concentrations across the
temperature and humidity ranges tested. Results demonstrated that the test system can be
used at temperatures from 50-104°F (10-40°C) and at a relative humidity from 20-85%.
4. User performance study:
For the user performance study summarized under consumer study above, the participants
were asked to complete a questionnaire to evaluate the ease of use of the device and the
clarity of the English language labeling. Overall the users indicated that they could
successfully perform the test and that the user manual was written clearly.
4. Readability assessment:
15

--- Page 16 ---
The sponsor performed a readability assessment of the labeling and states that the user
manual, strip insert, and control insert are written at 8th grade level or below based on
SMOG analysis.
5. EMC testing
EMC testing was evaluated and certified by Electronics Testing Center Taiwan and a letter
of attestation was issued and attached to file.
6. Sample volume study
A sample volume study was performed to verify the test strip sample volume requirement of
0.5 μL for both FORA Diamond Prima Blood Glucose Monitoring System and FORA
Diamond Mini Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Three samples with glucose
concentrations approximately 50, 150, and 350 mg/dL were evaluated with three lots of test
strips with 5 different FORA Diamond Prima and FORA Diamond Mini meters
respectively. Each of the three blood samples was applied to the strips at samples volumes
0.4, to 1.5 μL. Protocols and acceptance criteria were provided and found to be acceptable.
The sponsor concluded that sample volumes ≥ 0.5 μL produced accurate results and sample
volumes <0.5 μL produced inaccurate results for both meters. The labeling provides
instructions and graphics to assist the user in obtaining and applying an adequate sample
volume in both cases.
7. Infection Control
The devices are intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection studies were
performed on these meters by an outside commercial testing company to determine the
robustness of the meter to the recommended cleaning and disinfection protocol, and its
effectiveness in preventing the spread of blood borne pathogens, particularly Duck
hepatitis B virus (HBV). Micro-Kill Plus™ disposable wipes (EPA Reg. No: 59894-10-
37549) were validated, demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus for use with the
meter. The sponsor also demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the
external materials of the meter and lancing device after 5,000 cleaning and disinfection
cycles designed to simulate 5 years of use by lay users. Labeling has been reviewed for
adequate instructions in validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
8. Software validation
Software validation verification has been reviewed and the information the sponsor
provided was deemed to be sufficient.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
