I. Device Description:
Each VITEK® 2 test card contains 64 microwells. A control well which contains only
microbiological culture media is resident on all cards, with the remaining wells
containing premeasured amounts of a specific antibiotic combined with culture medium.
A suspension of organism is made in 0.45 sterile saline from a pure culture and
standardized to a 0.5 McFarland standard using the DensiChek2. The desired card(s) are
placed in the cassette along with an empty tube for the susceptibility card. The VITEK®
2 System automatically vacuum fills, seals and places the card into the incubator/reader.
The VITEK® 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing and loading operation. Cards are
then transferred from the cassette into the carousel for incubation (35.50 C) and optical
scanning during testing.
Optics systems use visible light to directly measure organism growth. This transmittance
optics is based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth has begun.
Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same well measure organism growth by
how much light is prevented from going through the well. Readings are performed every
15 minutes. An interpretive call is made between 4 and 16 hours for a "rapid" read but
may be extended to 18 hours in some instances. The VITEK® 2 Susceptibility Card test
is based on the microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) technique with
concentrations equivalent to standard method concentrations. Several parameters based
on the growth characteristics observed are used to provide appropriate input for the MIC
calculations. Discriminant analysis is used to develop the algorithm that determines the
susceptibility result for all antimicrobials on the VITEK® 2 system. The MIC result must
be linked to organism identification in order to determine a category interpretation. A
category interpretation will be reported along with an MIC. This is only an auto-read
result; manual readings are not possible.
The VITEK® 2 AST-ST Inducible Clindamycin Resistance consists of two wells at the
following concentrations in the card: Clindamycin 0.5μg/mL and
Clindamycin/Erythromycin at 0.25/0.5μg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration
by efficacy in µg/mL). The CLSI Interpretive Criteria for the VITEK® 2 Inducible
Clindamycin Resistance is Negative- Positive.

Software forcing rules for S. agalactiae and S. pyogenes are applicable dependent on the
AST-ST ICR test results.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Five S. agalactiae and five S. pyogenes isolates were tested at three sites
using both manual and automatic dilution methods. These same organisms
were tested at one site three times to determine within site reproducibility.
Acceptable reproducibility was demonstrated with only category agreement
(Negative, Positive) since that is all that is detected.
The same study was conducted at three external sites; using the secondary
VITEK®2 Compact by manual dilution with acceptable results.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
The CLSI recommended QC isolates, S. aureus ATCC BAA-977, and S.
aureus ATCC 29213 were tested at each site by the VITEK®2 AST-ST
ICR and the D test method. The reference method QC results were in range
every day they were tested. The VITEK®2 was tested a sufficient number
of times to demonstrate that the system produced QC results within the
expected ranges (i.e. positive/negative) >95% of the time for both automatic
and manual dilution methods.

2. Comparison studies:
The reference method was the CLSI standard disk diffusion (D test) procedure
with a 15µg Erythromycin disk and placing a 2µg Clindamycin disk 12 mm
away. The conditions were:
· Medium: Mueller-Hinton with 5% sheep blood
· Inoculum: Direct colony suspension
· Incubation : 35°C, in CO for 20- 24 hours

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A clinical study was conducted at four external sites using the VITEK®2
AST-ST Streptococcus Inducible Clindamycin Resistance susceptibility
test. Each isolate was tested by the VITEK®2 AST-ST Streptococcus
Inducible Clindamycin Resistance (ICR) susceptibility test and the CLSI
reference method. The ICR test wells are not supplemented with blood.
The testing included both fresh clinical isolates and stock isolates along
with a challenge set with known results. A total of 538 clinical isolates
were evaluated. There were 89 stock isolates (16.5%); all clinical isolates
grew in the VITEK®2 AST-ST Inducible Clindamycin Resistance (ICR)
test. The challenge set consisted of 100 isolates and all grew in the
VITEK®2 AST-ST cards.
Two methods of inoculation (manual and automated) were evaluated.
Clinical testing was performed using the automated method of inoculation
and the challenge set was tested using both the manual and the automated
method. Software forcing rules for S. agalactiae and S. pyogenes are
applicable dependent on the growth/no growth in the Clindamycin
0.5μg/mL, and the Clindamycin/Erythromycin 0.25/0.5μg/mL wells.
A comparison to the reference D test was provided with the following
agreement:

CA is when the interpretation of the reference D test agrees exactly with
the interpretation of the VITEK®2 results.
A challenge study was performed utilizing auto-dilution and manual
dilution at one site on 100 isolates. No differences observed between
these two types of dilutions.
