510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
k111914
B. Purpose for Submission:
New instrument system
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Olympus Corporation
Olympus Virtual Slide System, VS800 System
VS800 HER2 Manual Read (MR) application
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Manual interpretation of digital images for immunohistochemically (IHC) stained
HER2 slides
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The VS800 System is an automated digital slide creation, management, viewing
and annotating system. The VS800 System components consist of an automated
digital microscope slide scanner, operation monitor, keyboard and digital
pathology information management software. The system capabilities include
digitizing microscope slides at high resolution, storing and managing the resulting
digital slide images, retrieving and displaying digital slides, including support for
remote access over wide area networks, providing facilities for annotating digital
slides and entering and editing metadata associated with digital slides.
The remote digital slide viewing capabilities of the system support reading digital
slides on a viewing monitor, enabling pathologists to make clinically relevant
decisions analogous to those they make using a conventional microscope.
Specifically, the VS800 HER2 MR application supports the pathologist in the
detection of HER2/neu by manual examination of the digital slide of formalin
fixed; paraffin embedded normal and neoplastic tissue immunohistochemically
stained for HER2 receptors on a viewing monitor.
2. Principles of Operation:
The VS800 System is intended to provide digital images to the pathologist to
1

--- Page 2 ---
supplement the semi-quantitative interpretation of immunohistochemistry
HER2/neu stained breast cancer specimens. Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded
breast cancer specimens are stained with the Dako HercepTest™ according to the
package insert. Image acquisition is achieved by capture of numerous small
regions of a microscope slide using a 2D charge-coupled device (CCD) camera.
The resulting image tiles are stitched together and aligned to create a large
contiguous digital image of the entire slide. The pathologist manually reads and
interprets the digital image without use of image analysis software. The HER2
score is calculated by the pathologist based on the percentages of 0, 1+, 2+, and
3+ cells according to the HER2 scoring scheme in the Dako HercepTest™
product insert.
3. Modes of Operation:
Automated batch processing
4. Specimen Identification:
Specimens are identified by a barcode reader. The Macro Image camera captures
a whole slide image, including the barcode label. The pathologist should check
the relationship between the slide number on the label and system to ensure that it
is correct.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Automated loading of the glass slides is accomplished by the Autoloader
component which consists of three cassette trays that hold 100 glass slides. (Total
capacity is 3 x 100 = 300 slides.) The Autoloader contains a robotic arm
mechanism with a gripper for grabbing a slide and which moves up and pivots to
position a slide to be processed over the stage. The arm also grabs the slide after
it has been processed and replaces it in the appropriate rack.
6. Calibration:
Not applicable
7. Quality Control:
The accuracy of the system depends on the laboratory following the quality
control instructions for the Dako HercepTest™.
8. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and Software Development
processes for this line of product types:

G. Intended Use:
1. Indication(s) for Use:
The VS800 system is an automated digital slide creation, management, and
viewing system. It is intended for in vitro diagnostic use as an aid to the
pathologist in the display, detection, counting and classification of tissues and
cells of clinical interest based on particular color, intensity, size, pattern and
shape.
The VS800 HER2 Manual Read (MR) of digital slide application is intended for
use as an aid to the pathologist in the detection and semi-quantitative
measurement of HER2 by manual examination of the digital slide of formalin-
fixed, paraffin-embedded neoplastic tissue IHC stained for HER2 receptors on a
computer monitor. HER2 results are indicated for use as an aid in the
management, prognosis and prediction of therapy outcomes of breast cancer.
The VS800 HER2 MR of digital slide application is intended for use as an
accessory to the Dako HercepTest™ to aid the pathologist in the detection and
semi-quantitative measurement of HER2 by manual examination of the digital
slide of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded neoplastic tissue
immunohistochemically stained for HER2 receptors on a computer monitor.
When used with the Dako HerceptTest™, it is indicated for use as an aid in the
assessment of breast cancer patients for whom Herceptin® (trastuzumab)
treatment is being considered. Note: The actual correlation of the Dako
HercepTest™ to the Herceptin® clinical outcome has not been established.

distribution of HER2 scores in the trichotomous categorization of the HER2
scores combining 0 and 1+, and leaving 2+ and 3+ uncombined, and then re-
cut and re-stained.
At each clinical site, three different pathologists performed first a blinded read
of the glass-slides using a conventional microscope. Then, the slides were
digitized using a different scanner at each clinical site, and after a wash-out
period of at least one week and randomization, the same three pathologists at
each site performed another blinded manual read of the digital slides on their
computer monitors. Assay controls were run and provided with the slides
during the reads.
Tables 1-6 show the 4x4 tables for the agreements between the manual
microscopy reads and manual digital reads using column-wise Percent
Agreement (PA; i.e., percent of manual digital reads that agree with a given
manual microscopy read) with a Exact 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for each
of the three pathologists at site 1 and site 2. The statistical analysis is
provided for a trichotomous agreement of the HER2 scores combining 0 and
1+, and leaving 2+ and 3+ uncombined. For example, there were 33 (10 + 23)
slides with manual microscopy read either 0 or 1+ and 30 (4 + 0 + 6 + 20) of
these were called 0 or 1+ by manual digital read, resulting in a PA of 90.91%
(30/33).

scores combining 0 and 1+, and leaving 2+ and 3+ uncombined.
For comparison, a pathologist read the thirty (30) glass-slides three times
using the same conventional microscope. Then, the same pathologist read the
images of the thirty (30) glass- slides three times on a computer monitor, re-
scanned each time on the same instrument. Finally, the same pathologist read
the images of the thirty (30) glass-slides another three times on a computer
monitor, this time the slides were re-scanned each time on a different
instrument. The wash-out period between reads was at least one week and
the slides were randomized between reads.
The statistical analysis is presented across all slides, with pair-wise
comparisons of all reads by the pathologist, using Percent Agreement (PA)
with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI). The statistical analysis is provided
for a trichotomous categorization of the HER2 scores combining 0 and 1+,
and leaving 2+ and 3+ uncombined.
