L. Test Principle:
Under the alkaline conditions of the Magnesium reagent, magnesium present in the
sample, when mixed with the reagent, forms a red complex with the diazonium salt of
xylidyl blue. The concentration of magnesium in the sample is directly proportional
to the amount of xylidyl blue – magnesium complex formed and can be measured
spectrophotometrically by the decrease in absorbance measured at 660 nm.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All the performance studies were conducted using the Hitachi 717 analyzer.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated according to the CLSI Document EP5-A2, Evaluation
of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods. Total
precision and within-run precision were established by assaying human serum
pool materials, twice a day for 20 days using two reagent lots at one site.
Total Within Run
Mean
N (mg/dL) SD %CV SD %CV
Sample 1 40 0.8 0.05 6.1 0.04 5.2
Sample 2 40 2.0 0.07 3.7 0.04 2.2
Sample 3 40 4.7 0.15 3.2 0.08 1.6
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The measuring range of the assay is 0.3 to 8.0 mg/dL. Linearity was
evaluated according to the CLSI Document EP6-A2, Evaluation of the
Linearity of quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach. A
high concentration sample obtained by spiking magnesium chloride in serum
was diluted to produce eleven concentrations across the measuring range.
Each sample was assayed in quadruplicate. The resulting mean concentrations
of each sample were compared to predicted concentrations and yielded a
linear regression of y=1.01 x + 0.013. Recovery was from 90% to 100%.
Results of the study support the sponsor’s claim that the assay is linear from
0.3 to 8.0 mg/dL.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators and controls were cleared under k882258 and k874772 and are
sold separately.
The sponsor performed reagent stability studies and protocol and acceptance
criteria and found them to be adequate. Accelerated stability studies were
performed to simulate 24 months stability of the reagent when stored at 2°C to
8°C. Real time stability studies are still on-going.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of the Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of
Quantitation (LoQ) were established following the CLSI guideline EP17-A:
Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation.
The LoB was determined to be 0.15 mg/dL based on 60 determinations of 5
blank samples. The LoD was determined to be 0.25 mg/dL based on 60
determinations of 5 low level samples. Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) is the
lowest concentration of Mg that can be measured with CV≤20%. The
observed LoQ of the Mg assay is 0.3 mg/dL.
The Mg assay has a measuring range of 0.3 to 8.0 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed studies to evaluate effect of different compounds
(such as ascorbic acid, hemoglobin, intralipid, unconjugated and conjugated
bilirubin) on the performance of the Magnesium assay, following CLSI EP7-
A2, Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline. Testing
was done in the presence of three levels of Magnesium (~2 mg/dL, 4.2 mg/dL
and ~7.2 mg/dL) and different concentrations of the listed compounds. Percent
recovery was calculated relative to control samples containing Magnesium
without spiked compounds. The table below lists all substances tested at
concentrations with non-significant interference (defined by the sponsor as <
10%) :

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor performed studies to compare the performance of the Magnesium
assay with the performance of the predicate assay (k9444076) following CLSI
EP9-A2 Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples. A
total of 100 specimens in the range of 0.5 to 7.3 mg/dL, were used in this
comparison. A small number of the samples (5%) were altered (spiked) in
order to span the measuring range. Regression analysis was based on single
measurements of the candidate device and the average of duplicates for the
predicate device. Results of regression analysis are summarized below:
Deming Regression:

Predicate Candidate 100 0.98 0.981 0.00
(CI:0.947,1.016) (CI:-0.09, 0.09)
Linear regression:
b. Matrix comparison:
The sponsor performed a matrix study to compare the performance of the
assay when different sample types (serum vs. LiHeparin plasma) were tested.
The study was completed with human plasma (LiHeparin) and serum samples
spanning the linear range of the assay and following the CLSI EP9-A2
Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples guidance. A
total of 54 unaltered patient samples were tested in the range of 0.5 to 5.4
mg/dL. One single set of plasma samples was used as test samples, while
duplicate serum samples were used as references. Results of regression
analysis are summarized below:
