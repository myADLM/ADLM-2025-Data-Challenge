L. Test Principle:
The allergen of interest covalently coupled to the ImmunoCAP solid phase, reacts with the specific
IgE in the patients plasma/serum sample. After washing away non specific IgE, enzyme-labeled
antibodies against IgE are added to form a complex. After incubation, unbound enzyme-anti-IgE is
washed away and the bound complex is then incubated with the developing agent. After stopping the
reaction, the fluorescence of the eluate is measured. The higher the response value, the more specific
IgE present in the specimen. To evaluate the rest results, the response for the patient samples are
transformed to concentrations with the use of a calibration curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-Lot imprecision:
Imprecision of the individual allergen components was evaluated by using two plasma
samples (0.35 ± 25% and ≥0.7 kU /l) tested four times per day, for 20 operating days (a total
A
of 80 replicates per allergen). The study data shown below were performed on a Phadia 250
instrument according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Directions for Use. Similar assay
precision was demonstrated on the Phadia 100 and Phadia 1000 instruments.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the 12 individual allergens was assessed by diluting three positive plasma
samples per allergen in negative plasma to provide at least five 2-fold consecutive dilutions.
Undiluted and diluted samples were tested in four replicates in one assay run. The assay was
performed according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Directions for Use using instrument
Phadia 250. For each product, one lot of ImmunoCAP Allergen Component was used. The

unopened shelf-life of 24 months from the date of manufacture when stored at 2-8C. For the
real-time study, three lots of each component allergen were stored at 2-8C. At different time
intervals (0, 3, 6, 13 months), a positive and a negative human plasma sample were tested in
three replicates in one assay. The results were compared to the results of the same samples
tested at time = 0. The study is on-going.
Accelerated stability - studies performed on allergen components Hazel Nut (f425, f428);
Timothy (g205, g206, g209, g210, g212, g215) and Birch allergens (t215, t216, t220, t225)
support an unopened shelf-life of 24 months from the date of manufacture when stored at 2-
8C. For the accelerated study, three lots of component allergens were stored at 30C for
eight weeks. The same lot stored at 2-8C was used as reference. At four weeks and at eight
weeks two positive and one negative control samples (stored human plasma) were tested in
duplicate for each storage condition/lot combination. The results support the manufacture’s
claim of 24 months. Real-time stability studies are underway for these components and
currently support a claim of 13 months.

Specific IgE calibrator are detailed in k100999.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) and the Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined for each
allergen component on the Phadia 250 in alignment with CLSI EP17-A. The LoB was based

e. Analytical specificity:
Specificity of each allergen was verified through competitive inhibition studies in accordance
with CLSI I/LA20-A2. Inhibition studies should show an overall dose dependent decrease of
free specific IgE antibodies available to bind to the ImmunoCAP Allergen. This dose
dependent decrease indicates the presence of antibodies that recognize the allergen; no, or
little, decrease in response indicates that there are no antibodies specific to the allergen. The
specific inhibition demonstrates the presence of immunologically relevant and reactive
allergen bound to the solid phase.
The allergen solution was serially diluted with buffer to show an overall dose dependent
inhibition. The unrelated allergen solutions are not further diluted.
Equal volumes of a positive sample and varying dilutions of allergen solution (inhibitor)
were premixed. The mixture was incubated in a sample tube at room temperature for 1 hour
before being analyzed with the corresponding ImmunoCAP Allergen Component on
ImmunoCAP instrument according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The testing was
performed in duplicates in one assay run. Mean values were calculated.
The inhibition test was evaluated with inhibition values in %, calculated according to the
formula below:
 r b
 1   100i%
 t b
r = response [RU]
b = background response (100% inhibition) [RU]
t = total response (0% inhibition) [RU]

Inhibition studies should show an overall dose dependent decrease of free specific IgE
antibodies available to bind to the ImmunoCAP Allergen Component resulting in a decrease
in measured response, resulting in at least a 50% decrease of the measured response. At a
much higher concentration (about 10 fold), the unrelated inhibitors should not show any
appreciable inhibition.
The results of the inhibition with the allergen solution and the unrelated inhibitors indicate
that the 12 new allergens contain the immunologically relevant allergen as shown below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Refer to clinical studies.
b. Matrix comparison:
Serum, sodium heparin plasma, and EDTA plasma samples were collected from four patients
with clinical history of known specific allergies and four nonatopic patients. These samples
were tested with the ImmunoCap allergen components .This resulted in a range of results
(negative and positive) within each sample. All positive heparin plasma and EDTA plasma
samples (≥ 0.35 kU /L) demonstrated acceptable %recovery with the relevant allergens. This
A
study suggests that the three sample matrices are interchangeable.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical sensitivity and Specificity:
The performance of all 12 individual allergen components was compared to a clinical
diagnosis of allergy. Atopic samples were obtained from individuals with a clinical history of
allergy-like symptoms upon exposure to an allergen as diagnosed by a physician and/or
clinical symptoms and/or positive skin prick test to a specific allergen. Information about
clinical symptoms and manifestations was available for all atopic samples. 100 negative
samples (<0.35 kU /L) from healthy non-atopic donors were also tested.
