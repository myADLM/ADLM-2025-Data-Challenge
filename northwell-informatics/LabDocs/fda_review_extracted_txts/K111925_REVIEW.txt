2. Indication(s) for use:
The Psychemedics Microplate EIA for Cocaine is an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for the
preliminary qualitative detection of cocaine and metabolites in human head and body hair
samples using a cocaine calibrator at 5 ng /10 mg hair cutoff for the purpose of
identifying cocaine use. This product is intended exclusively for in-house professional
use only and is not for sale to anyone.
The Psychemedics Microplate EIA for Cocaine in Hair provides only a preliminary
analytical test result. To confirm a presumptive screen positive result, a more specific
alternate chemical method such as LC/MS/MS (liquid chromatography/mass
spectrometry/mass spectrometry) must be used. Clinical consideration and professional
judgment must be applied to the interpretation of any drug-of-abuse test result.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Over the counter use
4. Special instrument requirements:
The device is for use with a microplate reader capable of measuring at 450 and 630 nm.
Plate washing also requires an instrument specifically designed to effectively and
reproducibly wash all wells uniformly.
I. Device Description:
The test consists of a pre-analytical hair treatment procedure (to convert the solid matrix of
hair to a measurable liquid matrix) and the screening assay, the Psychemedics microplate
EIA for Cocaine in hair. Positive results then need to be confirmed by a more specific
alternate chemical method.
The screening portion of the test consists of 96-well microplates coated with antigen, primary
antibody directed against the antigen, secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) and substrate, 3, 3’, 5, 5’ tetramethylbenzidine (TMB).

L. Test Principle:
The test utilizes a sample of human hair. Extracts of hair samples and primary antibody

rotated gently at ambient temperature for one hour. The wells are then emptied and washed
once with wash buffer. Goat anti-mouse-HRP is added, and the plates rotated gently for one
hour. The wells are emptied and then washed with wash buffer two times, after which the
substrate (TMB) is added. The wells are then acidified with HCl and the plate is read on a
microplate reader. Results are normalized. If cocaine is present in the sample, less primary

antibody binds to the solid-phase antigen, thereby resulting in less binding of HRP-labeled
secondary antibody; the absorbance produced is inversely proportional to the amount of
cocaine in the sample (specimen, calibrator or control). For samples determined positive by
the screening assay, new aliquots of the hair sample are weighed, washed extensively to
remove externally-derived cocaine contamination on the hair, digested by a different
procedure that does not hydrolyze the cocaine, and confirmed by LC/MS/MS.
Standard and control cocaine stock solutions are purchased from multiple vendors, prepared
in the laboratory, and validated by LC/MS/MS confirmation.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
1. Intra-assay precision around the cutoff
Hair samples known to be negative to cocaine were spiked with cocaine to obtain
the following concentrations around the cutoff: 0, -75%, -50%, -25%, cutoff,
+25%, +50%, +75% and + 100% of the cutoff. The prepared samples were
assayed on the Microplate EIA for cocaine. Intra-assay precision was performed
in one run in 15 replicates and inter-assay precision was performed over 4 non-
consecutive days. The results are presented in the tables below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable. This assay is intended for qualitative screening determination.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Psychemedics manufactures calibrators and control materials using drug stocks
purchased from a commercial vendor. Each lot of drug is received with its specific
certificate of analysis. The commercially obtained stock is made into the calibrators
and controls to the desired concentrations. The concentrations are confirmed by MS.
Stability studies for both controls and calibrators have been conducted. Protocols and
acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer
claims the following expiration date for both controls and calibrators:
When stored at less than or equal to 10 ºC product is stable for 12 months.
d. Detection limit:
Not required since this is a qualitative test.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was evaluated by spiking various concentrations of each substance
into drug-free sample. Compounds chemically related to cocaine and its metabolites
were tested to determine which of them might react in the EIA cocaine assay. The
percent cross-reactivity of those compounds is presented below:

Interference by Cosmetic Treatments:
Tests were performed to determine the effects of various hair treatments (i.e.
bleaching, dyeing, relaxer, shampoo, permanent) on samples tested using the
Psychemedics Microplate EIA for Opiates. The ethnic origin, hair color and curvature
were documented.
Eighty cocaine-negative hair samples were used for this study. The study was
conducted with two different hair treatments for each hair sample. No significant
differences were observed for the negative hair samples before and after the
treatments; all samples remained negative after the treatments.
Forty eight cocaine-positive hair samples were used in this study. The study was
conducted with two different hair treatments for each hair sample. Average changes
in the absorbance values after treatment were -2.0% for bleach , -1.35% for dye, -
4.45% for perm, -2.75% for relaxer, and 0.1% for shampoo, where a negative sign
indicates a sample becoming “more negative” due to treatment and a positive sign
indicates a sample becoming “more positive.” None of the originally positive samples
tested negative after any of the cosmetic treatments.
Environmental Study
Preliminary positive hair sample results by the screening method could be due to
environmental contamination. All positive should be sent for confirmation testing on
a reference method to distinguish between true positive and those samples that were
positive due to external exposure.
