purpose of identifying methamphetamine use. This product is intended exclusively for in-
house professional use only and is not for sale to anyone.
The Psychemedics Microplate EIA for Methamphetamine in Hair provides only a
preliminary analytical test result. To confirm a presumptive screen positive result, a more
specific alternate chemical method such as LC/MS/MS (liquid chromatography/mass
spectrometry/mass spectrometry) must be used. Clinical consideration and professional
judgment must be applied to the interpretation of any drug-of-abuse test result.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Over the Counter use
4. Special instrument requirements:
The device is for use with a microplate reader capable of measuring at 450 and 630 nm.
Plate washing also requires an instrument specifically designed to effectively and
reproducibly wash all wells uniformly.
I. Device Description:
The test consists of two parts; a pre-analytical hair treatment procedure (to convert the solid
matrix of hair to a measurable liquid matrix) and the screening assay, the Psychemedics
Microplate EIA for Methamphetamine. The test system consists of microplate wells coated
with multiple antigens including methamphetamine conjugated to bovine serum albumin
(BSA). Hair samples are extracted by incubation with dithiothreitol and then neutralized.
Samples are incubated in the wells with goat anti-methamphetamine. The wells are emptied
and washed once, followed by addition of donkey anti-goat conjugated with horseradish
peroxidase (HRP), followed by washing and incubation with substrate trimethylbenzidine
(TMB), acidification and reading using a microplate absorbance reader at 450 nm with
background set at 630 nm.

Next, 100 ml of Rabbit-anti-goat-HRP is added, and the plates rotated gently for one hour.
The wells are then emptied and washed with wash buffer three times, after which 100 µl of
substrate (TMB) is added. After 30 minutes, the plate is read at 450 nm with background set
at 630 nm. Results are normalized by expression as B/B x 100. If methamphetamine is
0
present in the sample, less primary antibody will be bound to the solid-phase antigen, thereby
resulting in less binding of HRP-labeled secondary antibody; the absorbance produced is
inversely proportional to the amount of methamphetamine in the sample (specimen,
calibrator or control).
For samples that are presumptive positive by the screening assay, a new aliquot of the hair
sample is weighed, washed extensively to remove and evaluate externally-derived
methamphetamine contamination on the hair, digested by a different procedure, and
confirmed by LC/MS/MS.
Standard and control stock solutions are purchased from multiple vendors, prepared in the
laboratory, and validated by LC/MS/MS confirmation.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Hair samples known to be negative to methamphetamine or related compounds were
spiked with methamphetamine to obtain the following concentrations around the
cutoff: 0, -75%, -50%, -25%, cutoff, +25%, +50%, +75% and + 100% of the cutoff.
The prepared samples were assayed on the Microplate EIA for methamphetamine.
Intra-assay precision was performed in 15 replicates in one run and inter-assay
precision was performed over 4 non-consecutive days. The results are presented in
the tables below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable. This assay is intended for qualitative screening determination.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Psychemedics manufactures calibrators and control materials using drug stocks
purchased from a commercial vendor. Each lot of drug is received with its specific
certificate of analysis. The commercially obtained stock is made into the calibrators
and controls to the desired concentrations. The concentrations are confirmed by MS.
Stability studies for both controls and calibrators have been conducted. Protocols and
acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer
claims the following expiration date for both controls and calibrators:
When stored at less than or equal to 10 ºC product is stable for 12 months.
d. Detection limit:
Not required since this is a qualitative test.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was evaluated by spiking various concentrations of each substance
into drug-free sample. Compounds chemically related to cocaine and its metabolites
were tested to determine which of them might react in the EIA cocaine assay. The
percent cross-reactivity of those compounds is presented below:

Effects of Cosmetic Treatments of Hair
Eighty cocaine-negative hair samples were used for this study. The study was
conducted with two different hair treatments for each hair sample. No significant
differences were observed for the negative hair samples before and after the
treatments; all samples remained negative after the treatments.
.
Forty eight cocaine-positive hair samples were used in this study. The study was
conducted with two different hair treatments for each hair sample. The positive
samples showed average changes in the absorbance values of -3.9% for bleach , -
3.7% for dye, -14.3% for perm, -7.6% for relaxer, and -1.7% for shampoo, where a
negative sign indicates a sample becoming “more negative” due to treatment and a
positive sign indicates a sample becoming “more positive.” None of the originally
positive samples tested negative after any of the cosmetic treatments.
Environmental Study
Preliminary positive hair sample results by the screening method could be due to
environmental contamination. All positive should be sent for confirmation testing on
a reference method to distinguish between true positive and those samples that were
positive due to external exposure.
