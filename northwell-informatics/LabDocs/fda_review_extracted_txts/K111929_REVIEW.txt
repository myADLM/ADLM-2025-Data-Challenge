intended exclusively for Psychemedics use only and is not intended for sale to
anyone.
The Psychemedics Chemiluminscent Microplate EIA for Cannabinoids assay
provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative
chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result.
Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS/MS) is the
preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment
should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the
preliminary result is positive.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
This assay is for over the counter use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The device is for use with a microplate reader capable of measuring at 450 and
650 nm. Plate washing also requires an instrument specifically designed to
effectively and reproducibly wash all wells uniformly.
Confirmation testing is done by GC-MS/MS using a triple stage quadrupole
instrument operating in the negative chemical ionization (CI) mode. The
confirmatory method was cleared under k011426 and has not been modified.
I. Device Description:
The EIA screening test consists of two parts; a pre-analytical hair treatment procedure
to recover the cannabinoids from the hair and the screening assay, the Psychemedics
Chemiluminescent EIA for Cannabinoids in Hair. The device comprises a white
microplate coated with the antigen (11-nor-9-carboxy-delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol)
conjugated to BSA, polyclonal rabbit anticannabinoid antibody, goat anti-rabbit
secondary antibody conjugated to HRP (horseradish peroxidase), a chemiluminescent
substrate, and plate-washing buffer. Confirmation testing is done by GC-MS/MS
using a triple stage quadrupole instrument operating in the negative chemical
ionization (CI) mode.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None were referenced
L. Test Principle:
Hair extract is combined with the primary antibody in microtubes and incubated for
one hour at room temperature (RT). An aliquot of the pre-incubated mixture is
transferred to antigen-coated wells of the microplate. After incubation the plate is
washed with wash buffer and second antibody-HRP is added. After further incubation
the wells are emptied and washed with wash buffer, and chemiluminescent substrate
is added. The plate is mixed, and results are read in a reader capable of reading
luminescence. Results (expressed as RLU, or relative light units) are normalized by
expression as B/B0 x 100.
If cannabinoids are present in the sample, less primary antibody will be bound to the
solid-phase antigen, thereby resulting in less binding of HRP-labeled secondary
antibody to the primary antibody; the RLU’s produced by the action of the HRP on
the substrate are inversely proportional to the amount of cannabinoids in the sample.
Samples determined positive by the screening assay are re-weighed, washed, and by
GC/MS/MS for the presence of carboxy-THC.
Confirmation testing of samples presumptively positive from the device are
confirmed by first weighing out a new portion of the sample (approximately 12 mg).
The samples are washed for 15 minutes at 37 ºC with dry isopropanol, then three
times for 30 minutes in phosphate buffer (0.01 M, pH 6.0) containing 0.1% albumin.

Samples are then dissolved and extracted for confirmation of 11-nor-9-Carboxy-Δ9-
THC by GC/MS/MS.
Carboxy-THC standard solutions are purchased from multiple vendors, prepared in
the laboratory, and validated by GC/MS/MS confirmation. In addition, controls made
in-house of known cannabinoid-positive hair are also employed in the assay.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed by taking commercially available materials
consisting of carboxy-THC in methanol, to prepare spiking solutions at the
following concentrations; negative, ±75%, ±50%, ±25% and 100% of the
cutoff. The concentration of each sample was confirmed by LC/MS/MS. The
carboxy-THC solutions were then used to spike 15 replicates of negative hair
samples. Intra-assay precision was performed in one run and inter-assay
precision was performed over 5 non-consecutive days. The results are
presented in the tables below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. This is a qualitative assay.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Psychemedics manufactures calibrators and control materials using drug
stocks purchased from a commercial vendor. Each lot of drug is received with
its specific certificate of analysis. The commercially obtained stock is made
into the calibrators and controls to the desired concentrations. The
concentrations are confirmed by GC/MS.
Stability studies for both controls and calibrators have been conducted.
Protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable.
The manufacturer claims the following expiration date for both controls and
calibrators:
When stored at less than or equal to -20 ºC for calibrators and -10 ºC quality
control the product is stable for 12 months.
d. Detection limit:
Not required since this is a qualitative test
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was established by spiking various concentrations of each
substance into drug-free sample and evaluating the result against the cutoff
control.

Cosmetic Treatment
Tests were performed to determine the effects of various hair treatments (i.e.
bleaching, dyeing, relaxer, shampoo, permanent) on samples tested using the
Psychemedics Microplate EIA for THC. The ethnic origin, hair color and
curvature were documented.
Effects on Positive Samples:
60 specimens determined to be positive for THC were used in the study. The
study was conducted with two different hair treatments for each hair sample.
ELSIA absorbance readings before and after treatment were compared.
Average changes in absorbance values after were 1.7% for bleach, -3.5% for
dye, -1.75% for perm, -1.7% for relaxer and 3.8% for shampoo, where a
negative sign indicates a sample becoming “more negative” due to treatment
an a positive sign indicates a sample becoming “more positive.” None of the
positive samples became negative after treatment.
Effect on Negative Samples:
One hundred specimens previously determined to be negative were used in the
study. The study was conducted with two different hair treatments for each
hair sample. ELSIA absorbance readings before and after treatment were
compared. All samples determined to be negative prior to treatment remained
negative post treatment.
Environmental Study
Twelve hair samples were contaminated with marijuana smoke and stored for
two days. These samples were then split into two additional samples and
soaked in either saline or water. The washed and unwashed samples were then
analyzed by the screening method and confirmation method for the THC and
carboxy-THC. All samples were positive by the screening method. The
confirmation tests, which queries carboxy-THC, were negative for all
samples.
Preliminary positive hair sample results by the screening method could be due
to environmental contamination. All positive should be sent for confirmation
testing on a reference method to distinguish between true positive and those
samples that were positive due to external exposure.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The Cannabinoids EIA assay is the screening component in the test system which
also includes, as the second component of the cleared system (cleared under
k011426), a GC/MS/MS confirmation test of carboxy-THC in hair. The study was
performed by comparing EIA results against the full test system results on the
same head or body hair samples. A total of 315 donor hair samples were tested
first using the screening method and then confirmed by GC/MS/MS for the
presence of carboxy-THC. 183 presumptively positive samples were confirmed
positive by GC/MS/MS for carboxy-THC. Five presumptively positive samples
were negative by GC/MS/MS for carboxy-THC with GC/MS/MS results between
50% below the cutoff and the cutoff concentration. The discrepant results
between screening and confirmation parts of the system are presented in the table
below:
Screening Cutoff ELSIA THC Test Carboxy-THC
