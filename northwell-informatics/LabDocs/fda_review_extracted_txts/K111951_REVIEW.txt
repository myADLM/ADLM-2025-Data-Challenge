L. Test Principle:
The IsoAmp® HSV Assay consists of three major steps: 1) specimen preparation: 2)
isothermal HDA of HSV glycoprotein B (gB) gene using biotinylated primers; and 3)
detection of the amplified DNA by target-specific hybridization probe via a
colorimetric reaction on a lateral-flow strip which is embedded in a self-contained
disposable cassette to prevent amplicon contamination.
Specimen preparation includes a simple dilution step in which specimens in viral
transport medium are diluted 40-fold in dilution buffer. The diluted samples are
mixed with Helicase-Dependent Amplification (HDA) reagents. Incubation at 64°C
results in the release of the HSV DNA and subsequent isothermal amplification of the
target sequence. A competitive internal control (IC) is present in the reaction to
monitor inhibitory substances in negative samples, reagent failure or device failure.
After incubation for one hour, the amplified DNA targets are detected by two
detection probes, one labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) for hybridizing
to the HSV target and the other labeled with digoxigenin (DIG) for binding to the IC
target. The hybrid of FITC-labeled probe and HSV amplicon is captured at the Test
Line (T-Line) on the strip by anti-FITC antibodies, while the DIG-labeled IC
amplicon is captured at the Control Line (C-Line) on the strip by anti-DIG antibodies.
The biotin label in each amplicon captures the streptavidin-conjugated color particles

for visualization and the test result is shown as colored lines that are visually read.
The self-contained Type II BEStTM cassettes contain lateral-flow DNA detection
strips coated with anti-FITC antibodies and anti-DIG antibodies that serve as T line
and C line respectively in the assay. A positive result (detection of HSV DNA) is
reported when the T line is visible through the detection window of the cassette. A
negative result (no detection of HSV DNA is reported when only the C line is
displayed. The assay result is regarded as invalid when both the T line and C line are
not present and should be repeated.
Recording and interpretation of the assay results:
• Positive: Always read the Test (T) line first. When T line is visible (T+), report
the assay result as “HSV DNA detected”.
• Negative: When no visible T line is present (T-), a visible C line indicates that the
Internal Control DNA has been amplified and detected, eliminating the possibility of
a false negative due to failure of amplification or device, and thus the assay result
should be reported as negative - “no HSV DNA detected”.
• Invalid: If both T and C lines are not present (T-/C-), then the assay is invalid and
the test needs to be repeated.
• Any visible T line and C line, regardless of intensity of that line, are recorded as a
reactive test (“+”), while the complete absence of any visible lines are recorded as a
nonreactive test (“-”).
Interpretation of the assay results
The interpretation of the assay results is done according to the following criteria:

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The Precision/Reproducibility of the IsoAmp® HSV Assay was evaluated at three
(3) test sites. A panel of seven (7) members was prepared containing one
negative control sample (HSV negative pooled swab specimens) and six
stimulated HSV-1 and HSV-2 samples that included High Negative, Low Positive
(1 x LOD, near the assay limit of detection) and Moderate positive samples (3 x
LOD). The panel along with the external HSV-1 and HSV-2 positive and negative
controls (Remel M4 transport media) was tested at each site for five (5) days by
two operators with each operator running the panel two times a day using a single
lot of the IsoAmp® HSV Assay. One (1) site tested the panel using three (3) lots.
Results of the Precision/Reproducibility study for the IsoAmp® HSV Assay at
three sites are presented in the table below.

The competitive internal control (IC) consists of plasmid DNA. The IC target
sequence is amplified using the same primer set that amplifies the HSV target
sequence. The internal sequence of the IC target is different from the HSV target
sequence and is detected by an IC-specific probe. After amplification, the IC
amplicon-probe complexes are detected as a visible Control line on the Type II
BESt Cassette. The IC DNA and probe are pre-mixed in the Amplification Reagent

External Assay (positive and negative) controls
The Assay Positive Controls are HSV-1 or HSV-2 DNA and are intended to
monitor reagent and cassette failure. The Assay Negative Control consists of
blank viral transport medium and is used to detect reagent or environmental
contamination (or carry-over) by either HSV DNA or amplicons. HSV-1 and
HSV-2 Positive Control consist of plasmid DNA with the target sequence of
HSV-1 and HSV-2 respectively. Plasmid DNA is diluted to 246 copies/µL for
HSV-1 and 492 copies/µL for HSV-2 in Remel M4 transport medium to make the
assay positive controls. The Assay Negative Control consists of blank viral
transport medium and is used to detect reagent or environmental contamination
(or carry-over) by either HSV DNA or amplicons
Specimen processing controls
Additional external controls may be tested in accordance with the guidelines or
requirements of local, state and/or federal regulations or accreditation
organizations. HSV-1 (Catalog Number: 10-110-000) and HSV-2 (Catalog
Number: 10-111-000) viruses can be purchased from Advanced Biotechnologies
Inc. (Columbia, MD) and they can be used as specimen processing controls with
appropriate amount of viral titer.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Detection (LoD) for the IsoAmp® HSV Assay was determined using
two (2) representative strains of HSV-1 (McIntyre & HF) and HSV-2 (G & MS).
The virus strains were serially diluted to five concentrations and tested in
replicates of ten (10) using three (3) reagent lots. To confirm the observed LoD,
two additional studies were performed. In one, the four (4) representative strains
(two (2) HSV-1 and two (2) HSV-2) were diluted to the observed LoD and run in
20 replicates using three (3) reagent lots. In the second study, 20 HSV-1 and 20
HSV-2 clinical isolates with known TCID /mL concentrations were diluted to the
50
LoD and tested in triplicate using a single lot of reagents.
To dilute all representative HSV-1 and HSV-2 strains and clinical isolates (used
for LoD Confirmation testing) to the desired concentration, two pools of HSV
Negative Matrix were prepared from 112 ELVIS culture HSV negative/ IsoAmp®
HSV Assay negative clinical samples obtained from one of the clinical study
sites.
Two representative strains of HSV-1 and HSV-2 were cultured and quantified
(TCID /mL). Each strain was serially diluted using the HSV Negative Matrix
50
pools to make four (4) LoD panels (one for each strain) consisting of five (5)
concentration levels of approximately 9 x, 3 x, 1 x, 1/3 x and 1/9 x of the expected
LoD level (the expected LoD was generated from original development data) for
each virus type.
8

--- Page 9 ---
Each panel member was tested in replicates of 10 on three (3) reagent lots for a
combined total of 30 measurements per concentration level per panel. In
consideration of the total number of tests, the LoD testing for each panel was
performed in several test runs by three different operators in which two replicates
at each of the five concentration levels were tested in the same test run. Assay
positive and negative controls were included in each test run.
The observed LoD of a HSV strain was determined as the lowest concentration
level demonstrating a positive result at >95%. Since two (2) strains of HSV-1 and
HSV-2 were used, the higher of the concentrations observed were used to define
the final LoD.

ii. Clinical Isolate Testing: All twenty (20) HSV-1 and (20) HSV-2 clinical
isolates were tested in triplicate. The IsoAmp® HSV Assay was able to detect all
20 HSV-1 and 20 HSV-2 clinical isolates. One of the HSV-2 clinical isolates was
HSV negative in one of the three (3) replicates; however, when the isolate was
tested at 3x and 9x LoD, all three replicates were HSV-Positive by the IsoAmp®
HSV Assay.
The observed LoD for HSV-1 was 1.1 x 105 TCID /mL. The observed LoD for
50
HSV-2 was 1.1 x 104 TCID /mL. Since the IsoAmp® HSV Assay does not
50
differentiate viral types, the final assay LoD is defined as the higher of the HSV-1
and HSV-2 concentrations where 95% positivity was observed. The final assay
LoD claim is 1.1 x 105 TCID /mL.

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross Reactivity: A cross-reactivity study was performed to determine if any
organisms which may present with the same clinical symptoms as HSV, which
are associated with bacterial vaginosis or which are commonly found in the

genital track and oral area could give positive results with the IsoAmp® HSV
Assay reporting accurate results. Forty-eight (48) specificity panel members
including purified DNA and cultured organisms were tested with the IsoAmp®
HSV Assay in triplicate.
Three (3) methods were used to prepare the test organisms: (1) Genomic DNA
[GD] purified and quantified, (2) Quantified Cultures (QC) [bacterial/fungal
(CFU/mL), viral (TCID /mL)], and (3) In-House Cultures (IHC) cultured and
50
diluted to a bacterial concentration of 108 CFU/mL. Each organism or purified
genomic DNA was tested in triplicate at 1.0 x 107 CFU/mL (copies/mL) for
bacterial and fungal organisms and at 1.0 x 106 pfu/mL (copies/mL) for viruses
(in Remel M4 viral transport medium).
No cross-reactivity was observed with any panel member tested at clinically
significant concentrations.

f. Interference studies:
Potential interfering substances i. e. viral transport media, substances that might
be present in clinical samples and organisms/cross reactive panel members listed
under analytical specificity that might be carried over from patient samples and
co-infection of HSV-1 and HSV-2 were tested to confirm that they did not
interfere with the performance of the IsoAmp® HSV Assay.
All interference testing was carried out in the presence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 at
three times the observed LoD (3x LoD). HSV-1 HF and HSV-2 MS strains were
used. All test runs were conducted in triplicate. Controls were tested with each
run.
i. Interfering Substances
Performance of the IsoAmp® HSV Assay was characterized in the presence of
twenty-four (24) potential interfering substances which could reasonably be
expected to be present in genital and oral swab specimens. Interfering substances
were tested at the highest (“worst case”) concentration expected in clinical
samples. Each interfering substance was introduced into the assay by directly
wetting a clean, dry Remel M4 kit swab with the substance and placing the swab
directly in transport media. Calculated concentrations are based on an estimated
volume of 200µL of substance introduced by the swab. Each panel member was
tested in triplicate spiked with HSV-1 HF and HSV-2 MS strains separately at 3 x
LoD. The panel was also tested in triplicate in the absence of HSV transport
media to see if the potentially interfering substances interfere with the detection of
the internal control. No interference was observed in the presence of the potential
interfering substances tested.

ii. Viral Transport Media
The performance of the IsoAmp® HSV Assay was assessed with Remel M4,
Remel M5, Remel M4RT, Bartels VTM, and BD Universal Viral Transport
(UVT). Each medium was tested after spiking with HSV-1 HF and HSV-2 MS
strain to a final concentration of approximately 3 x LoD to determine if the viral
transport media interfere with the detection of HSV targets in positive samples.
The media were tested in the absence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 (medium only) to see
if the viral transport media interfere with the detection of the internal control in
negative samples. There was no interference observed with the Remel M4, Remel
M4RT, Remel M5, Bartels VTM, and BD UVT media for the detection of HSV-1
and HSV- 2 target or the internal control.
iii. Specificity/Cross Reactivity Panel Members
The performance of the IsoAmp® HSV Assay was characterized by testing the
organisms that were evaluated for analytical specificity and cross reactivity in the
presence of HSV-1 HF and HSV-2 MS at 3xLoD separately to see if the presence

of these organisms interferes with the detection of HSV target. Each panel
member was tested in triplicate. None of the cross reactivity panel members
interfered with the detection of HSV-1 and HSV-2 target.
g. Carry-Over/Cross Contamination:
Carry-over/Contamination studies Study was done only with HSV-1 target since
both HSV-1 and HSV-2 share a single set of primers and probes for target
amplification and detection. The HSV-1 McIntyre (6.65 x 108 TCID /mL) was
50
used directly without dilution. Remel M4 viral transport media was used as the
negative sample. Ten (10) replicates of negative sample together with assay
controls were run by two (2) operators to confirm that negative samples (Remel
M4 viral transport media) generate a negative result 100% of the time. Five (5)
replicates of high-concentration positive and negative samples were tested in a
series, alternating sample types. All results were as expected. Negative samples
tested were negative (10/10) and positive samples were positive (10/10).
h. Sample Stability:
Sample stability testing was done to confirm the stability of HSV-1 and HSV-2 in
four different viral transport media, Remel M4, Remel M5, Remel M4RT and BD
UVT. The media were spiked with HSV-1 or HSV-2 at 3 x LoD, and stored at 2 -
8ºC for one week. The IsoAmp® HSV Assay was performed with these spiked
samples every day. Each run consisted of 3 replicates with each medium, as well
as assay negative and positive controls. All the samples were shown stable in all
viral transport media for 7 days, supporting the claim for 5 day sample stability
when stored at 2 - 8ºC.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with reference method:
The clinical performance evaluation was done against a gold standard/reference
method i.e., Cell Culture using an enzyme linked virus inducible system with
HSV typing by fluorescently labeled antibodies.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
The FDA cleared MultiCode®-RTx HSV 1&2 assay was used as the Predicate
device. The performance of the IsoAmp® HSV Assay was compared with the
ELVIS® HSV ID/Typing Test System (Diagnostic Hybrid, Inc.) which is the gold
standard/reference method i.e., Cell Culture using an enzyme linked virus
inducible system with HSV typing by fluorescently labeled antibodies.
Clinical Performance
The performance of the IsoAmp® HSV Assay was evaluated at five
geographically diverse locations within the United States from 2010 - 2011. A
total of nine hundred ninety-four (994) swab samples were evaluated from male
and female genital and oral lesions collected in Viral Transport Media (Remel
M4, Remel M4RT, BD Universal Viral Transport and Bartels) from the patient
population ranging from <1 year to 92 years. Of the 994 specimens, there were
962 prospective and 32 retrospective samples. Of the 962 prospective samples,
803 genital and 159 oral samples were tested. Of the 32 retrospective samples, 15
genital and 17 oral samples were tested at a single study site. Female and male
genital swab specimens were collected from vaginal, labial, and penile lesions.
Oral swab specimens were collected from lips, gums, and mouth.
The performance of the IsoAmp® HSV Assay was compared with the reference
method which is the gold standard/reference method i.e., cell culture using an
enzyme linked virus inducible system. Quality Controls (HSV-1 positive, HSV-2
positive and HSV negative) were run on the IsoAmp® HSV Assay.

Prevalence 37.1% N/A
The combined prevalence was used to calculate the hypothetical positive
predictive values (PPV) and hypothetical negative predictive values (NPV) of the
IsoAmp® HSV Assay. The calculations are based on the sensitivity and specificity
obtained from the clinical studies: sensitivity of 97.1% and specificity of 93.4%
for genital lesion samples; sensitivity of 93.8% and specificity of 87.4% for oral
lesion samples. The prevalence observed by a laboratory may vary and the
distribution in the table below may be used to establish the frequency distributions
based on a specific laboratory’s patient population.
