I. Device Description:
The Access Folate Calibrators are a six level calibrator set intended to calibrate the Access
Folate assay for the quantitative determination of folic acid levels in human serum, plasma
(heparin) and red blood cells using the Access Immunoassay System. The calibrator set
provides calibrators at six levels – zero and approximately 1.2, 3.1, 6.2, 12.4 and 24.8 ng/mL
(2.8, 7.0, 14.0, 28.1, and 56.2 nmol/L). The calibrators are contained in 4.0 mL vials. The
calibrator vials are intended for storage at -20°C or colder.
Calibration cards are provided with each calibrator kit. Calibration cards contain bar codes
that are encrypted with the individual calibrator concentrations for each calibrator level.
Folate Calibrator S0 is intended for use with Access Folate assay to dilute patient samples
containing analyte concentrations greater than the analyte specific S5 calibrator. The Access
Folate Calibrators are a buffered matrix with human serum albumin (HSA) surfactant, <
0.1% sodium azide, and 0.25% ProClin 300.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
ISO 14971:2007 Medical Devices - Application of risk management to medical devices.
WHO International Standard Vitamin B12 and Serum Folate; 03/178
L. Test Principle:
Not applicable.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The Access Folate Calibrator (A98033) is traceable to the USP Folic Acid Reference
Standard. The reference standard is rehydrated and used to prepare six predetermined
concentrations which are then compared to the WHO International Standard 03/178.
Calibrator Value Assignment
For each calibrator level, multiple replicates of the reference calibrators and multiple
replicates of the commercial calibrators are analyzed on multiple Access 2 analyzers.
These values are then used to determine the commercial calibrator values.
A reference curve is then established using multiple Access Analyzers with a 95%
confidence interval (CI).
Stability
Real time stability study protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be
acceptable.
The claimed calibrators’ stability is 7 months at -20ºC for unopened vials and at 2-10ºC
90 days when thawed.
