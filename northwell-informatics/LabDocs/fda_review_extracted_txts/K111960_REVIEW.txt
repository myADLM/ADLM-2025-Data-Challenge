L. Test Principle:
Indirect potentiometric measurement with Ion-Selective Electrode i.e., ISE
measurements are based on the potentiometric and Nernst Equation principle. The
sample is diluted with a diluent and aspirated into ion-selective electrodes. The
measured potential difference between the reference electrode and the ion specific
electrodes is proportional to the Logarithm of the concentration of the measured ions.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed with three pooled human serum samples at
three different concentrations of CO2, on two separate Selectra ProM analyzers,
over twenty operating days. Samples were tested in duplicate twice a day
(N=80). The results are summarized in the tables below:
Within-run
Mean Within-run Within-run
n
(mEq/L) SD CV%
Low level 80 12.1 0.5 3.9
Medium level 80 19.9 0.5 2.3

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of CO2 System was studied by mixing a sample with high value
(43.0 mEq/L) and a sample with low value (10.8 mEq/L) to obtain 11 levels
with equidistant concentrations of CO2. All samples were tested in triplicate on
the Selectra ProM analyzer. The expected values were plotted against the
observed values and a linear regression line was fitted with the following
regression:
Y = 1.0387 - 0.9 mEq /L
r = 0.9998
The Standard error of the estimate, Sy.x is equal to 0.2 mEq/L.
The results of the linearity study support the CO2 assay measuring range from
10.8 to 43.0 mEq/L
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
CO2 value is traceable to the Standard Reference Material SRM 924a (of the
National Institute of Standards and Technology).
Stability:
Calibrator material is purchased from a commercial vendor (previously cleared
under k033501). The sponsor claimed the following for stability: ELITech
Clinical Systems ISE Calibrators is stable until the expiration date printed on
the label when stored at 2-8°C prior to reconstitution. After reconstitution the
stability is 8 hours when stored at 15-25°C, 2 days at 2-8°C or 4 weeks (when
frozen once) at -25°and -15°C. The labeling stated that the Calibrators should be
stored tightly capped and protected from light when not in use.
Value Assignment
ELITech Clinical Systems ISE Calibrators are value assigned using multiple
Vital Scientific Selectra ProM analyzers. Each sample is tested in triplicate over
several days. The target value of Level I and II are the median of the observed
values range. After validation of the target value, a confidence range (high and
low values) is then calculated.
It is recommended to recalibrate after setting-up of a new vial of ISE Reference
Solution or of ISE Diluent then every 4 hours when quality control results fall
outside the established range, after replacing electrode, and after ISE cleaning
and maintenance
d. Detection limit:
Detection limit is based on linearity study performed above. In addition, method
comparison study also supports the low end measuring claims of 10.8 mEq/L.

--- Page 7 ---
The sponsor’s claimed measuring range of the device is 10.8 – 43.0 mEq/L
e. Analytical specificity:
An endogenous interfering substances study was performed according to the
CLSI EP7-A guideline. Serum samples containing the analyte at two levels
(low and high) of the test were spiked with the potentially interfering substance
unconjugated bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin,, turbidity, ascorbic acid,
hemoglobin and acetylsalicylate to several concentrations. Samples were then
run in triplicate using the ProM analyzer. The recovery of the test at each
concentration of interferents was calculated by comparing the mean result of
testing with no interferents to the mean result at each level tested. The sponsor
defines non-significant interference as bias <10% between the spiked and
unspiked samples. The highest level tested with no significant interference is
listed in the table below.
Interferents Highest level tested with no interference
Turbidity 614 mg/dL
Unconjugated bilirubin 30.0 mg/dL, (513 µmol/L)
Conjugated bilirubin 29.5 mg/dL, (504 µmol/L)
Ascorbic acid 16.0 mg/dL
Concentrations above the therapeutic levels will interfere
and cause erroneous results
Acetylsalicylic acid 40 mg/dL.
Concentrations above the therapeutic levels will interfere
and cause erroneous results
Hemoglobin 300 mg/dL
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed between the predicate device
(ROCHE CO2-L reagent) on a cobas c111 analyzer and the candidate device
