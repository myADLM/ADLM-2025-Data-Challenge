Traceability and value assignment
All components used for the Audit™ Micro CV™ Urine/Fluids Chemistry
Linearity Set are obtained from commercial vendors and are inspected in-house .
For each analyte, value assignment for Level A through Level E is performed
on one instrument (Roche P-Modular) by one set of reagent. Each analyte was
measured 15 times (15 separate vials) and the mean value of each analyte was
used to establish target concentration values listed on the insert at each level.
The target ranges listed on the package insert were calculated as ± 15% of the
observed value. The results on Roche P-modular are shown in the table below:

Stability
Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to
be acceptable. Accelerated stability was performed to predict the shelf-life
and open-vial of the linearity sets. Real-time stability is ongoing to support
the stability of the linearity sets. The sponsor states that the shelf-life of the
linearity sets are 12 months when stored at 2-8° C. The open-vial stability
after reconstitution is 3 days for Set1 and 10 days for Set 2, respectively, at 2-
8° C.
