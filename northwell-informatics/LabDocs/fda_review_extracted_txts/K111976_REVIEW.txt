I. Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the
doubling dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration
(MIC). Each VITEK 2 AST card contains 64 wells. A control well which contains
only microbiological culture media is resident on all cards. The remaining wells
contain premeasured portions of a specific antibiotic combined with culture media.
The bacterial or yeast isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration
with 0.45 – 0.5% saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium
within the card. The VITEK 2 System automatically fills, seals, and places the card
into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing and
loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card
over a defined period of time. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is
generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for
each antibiotic contained on the card.
The VITEK 2 Streptococcus Erythromycin has the following concentrations in the
card: 1, 2, 4, and 16 μg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in
μg/mL). The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 card is ≤ 0.12 – ≥ 8 μg/mL.
The MIC ranges, interpretive criteria and equivalent concentrations are as follows for

L. Test Principle:
Automated growth based detection using attenuation of light measured by an optical
scanner. The optics used in the systems use visible light to directly measure organism
growth. Transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before
significant growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same
well measure organism growth by how much light is prevented from going through
the well. The VITEK 2 System monitors the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period of time. An interpretive call is made between 4 and 16 hours for a
“rapid” read but may be extended to 18 hours in some instances. At the completion of
the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the
interpretive category result for each antibiotic on the card. The VITEK 2
Streptococcus Erythromycin has the following concentrations in the card: 1, 2, 4, and
16 μg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in μg/mL). The
MIC result range for the VITEK 2 card is ≤ 0.12 – ≥ 8 μg/mL.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three external clinical sites. Ten
Streptococcus species isolates were tested at each site and testing was
performed in triplicate over three days with the VITEK 2 Streptococcus
Erythromycin card. The testing was performed using both the manual dilution
method and the automated dilution mode. Testing was conducted on the
VITEK 2 instrument.
For the sake of reproducibility calculations, off-scale values are handled in
two ways; “best case” and “worst case” scenarios. Best case calculation for
reproducibility assumes the off-scale result is within one well from the mode
MIC value. Worst case calculation for reproducibility assuming the off-scale
result is greater than one well from the mode MIC value.
The overall reproducibility was >95% with +/- one dilution observation for
the VITEK 2 and the VITEK 2 Compact system. Only Manual Dilution
testing was conducted since the VITEK 2 Compact system does not have a
functionality to support automatic dilution to inoculate the card. Results were
as follows:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended Streptococcus pneumonia QC organism was tested on
every test occasion with the reference method and the VITEK 2 System.
Ancillary quality control testing was also performed. Two gram-positive
organisms were tested throughout comparative testing at each study site by the
reference method only. This was done to perform further quality control of the
broth microdilution panels using E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and S. aureus
ATCC 29213 which have a QC range of 1-4 µg/mL and 0.25-1 µg/mL,
respectively.
The reference method QC results were in range for every day tested. The
VITEK 2 was tested a sufficient number of times to demonstrate that the
system can produce QC results in the recommended range.
Quality Control was performed during the studies using both the auto-dilution
and the manual method of diluting the organisms on the VITEK 2 System.
Results demonstrated that methods were comparable.
Quality Control Results with the VITEK 2 System for Erythromycin were as
follows:

The Quality control organism was in control in the reference on all days.
Quality Control results for the VITEK 2 System using either inoculation
dilution were at ≤0.125 µg/mL 100% of the time.
A similar QC study was conducted to evaluate the VITEK 2 Compact System.
Results were compared to the expected FDA/CLSI QC results. All results for
the VITEK 2 Compact System were within the expected QC ranges 100% of
the time.
Inoculum density control was monitored using the DensiChek2 instrument.
This was standardized weekly with all results recorded and in the expected
range.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Performance was established through a clinical study which was conducted at
four external study sites. A total of 1103 clinical isolates were tested by
VITEK® 2 Streptococcus Erythromycin with the VITEK® 2 System. The
majority of the isolates were recently isolated from clinical specimens. One
hundred and ninety six of the 1103 clinical isolates tested were stock isolates
(17.8%). A challenge set consisting of 112 isolates was evaluated with
VITEK® 2 Streptococcus Erythromycin. Testing of clinical isolates was
performed using the automated method of inoculation and the challenge
organisms were tested with both the manual dilution and automatic dilution.
Each isolate was tested by the VITEK 2 Streptococcus Erythromycin and the
CLSI broth microdilution reference method. The inoculum was prepared with
direct colony suspension. A comparison was provided to the reference
method with the following agreement. Three very major errors and three
major errors were seen. The error rates are acceptable based on the
recommended performance in the AST Guidance Document. No growth was
observed in 9 isolates.
