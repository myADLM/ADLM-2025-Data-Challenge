Stability:
Unlabeled vials are purchased from a contract manufacturer and ELITech labels and
kits the vial using their labeling. Real-time and accelerated stability studies for open
and closed-vials were performed and all lots met the acceptance criteria. The shelf life
is 36 months prior to reconstitution when stored at 2-8°C and 7 days after
reconstitution when stored at 2-8°C or 28 days when stored between -20 to -10°C
when frozen once.
Value Assignment
The target values and ranges were determined and defined by ELITech on ELITech
Clinical Systems Selectra analyzers equipped with ISE module using ELITech
Clinical Systems ISE Na, K, Cl and Total CO2 reagents and ISE calibrators.
Calibration was performed with ELITech Clinical System ISE Calibrators which is
traceable to reference material. The assignment protocol was performed on two
different analyzers with 48 measurements in total (2 analyzers, 2 lots, 3 vials and 4
measurements per vial). The results for ISE Control I are as follows:
