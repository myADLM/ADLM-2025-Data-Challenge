schemes indexed by acceptance quality limit (AQL) for lot-by-lot inspection.
L. Test Principle:
Urobilinogen - This test is based on the Ehrlich reaction in which p-diethylamino
benzaldehyde in conjunction with a color enhancer reacts with urobilinogen in a strongly
acid medium to produce a pink-red color.
Bilirubin - The direct bilirubin and dichlorobenzene diazonium produce fuchsia azo dyes in a
strongly acid medium.
Ketone - The acetoacetate and sodium nitroprusside cause a reaction in the alkaline medium,
which produces a violet color.
Blood - Hemoglobin acts as a peroxidase. It can cause peroxidase to release neo-ecotypes
oxide [O]. [O] oxidizes the indicator and causes the color change.
Protein - The test is based on the protein-error-of-indicators principle. An ion in the specific
pH indicator attracted by cation on the protein molecule makes the indicator further ionized,
which changes its color.

Nitrite - Nitrite in the urine and aromatic amino sulphanilamide are diazotized to form a
diazonium compound. The diazonium compound reacting with tetrahydro benzo(h) quinolin
3-phenol causes the color change.
Leukocytes - Granulocyte leukocytes in urine contain esterase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of
the pyrrole amino acid ester to liberate 3-hydroxy-5-pheny pyrrole. This pyrrole reacting
with diazonium forms a purple color.
Glucose - The glucose oxidized by glucose oxidase catalyzes the formation of glucuronic
acid and peroxide hydrogen. Peroxide hydrogen releases neo-ecotypes oxide [O] under the
function of peroxidase. [O] oxidizes iodide potassium, which causes the color change.
Specific Gravity - Electrolyte (M+X-) in the form of salt in urine reacts with poly methyl
vinyl ether and maleic acid (-COOH), which is a weak acid ionic exchanger. The reaction
produces hydrogenous ionogen, which reacts with a pH indicator that causes the color
change.
pH - This test is based on a double indicator principle that gives a broad range of colors
covering the entire urinary pH range.
Ascorbic Acid - Ascorbic acid, with 1,2-dihydroxy alkenes, under the alkaline condition,
deoxidizes the blue 2,6-dichloroindophenolate into colorless N- (p-phenol)- 2,6-dichloro-p-
amine phenol.
Healgen series Urine Analyzer adopts the principle of reflectance photometry to test the
quantity of biochemical component according to the color change caused by getting the
urinalysis strips react with the biochemical components in urine. The instrument uses four
kinds of monochromatic light (wavelengths: 420, 525, 560, 610, 660, and 950 nm) to scan
the reagent areas one after another, and the scanning system converts the optical signal to
electric signal. After treatment, the reflection rate of the reagent area can be calculated
according to the strength of the electric signal. The amount of the biochemical component in
the urine sample can be calculated according to the reflective rate.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The cut-off evaluation for all three formats (Healgen 4, 10, and 11) strips was
evaluated using 20 replicates from each of 3 levels of urine controls (N=60). Control
levels 1 and 2 represented the low and high samples. Level 3 controls was spiked
sample with analyte concentration adjusted to around the cutoff value. The samples
were blinded. Within-run precision was evaluated by testing 20 replicates on each of
the three levels of urine controls using strips from each of 3 lots of strips. Within-day
prevision was evaluated by testing three levels of urine controls in duplicate, one a
day, for 10 days using strips from 3 lots. Both reading methods (qualitative or semi-
quantitative) were evaluated. Instrumental readings were performed on the Healgen
500 and Healgen 800. Testing was completed at three different point-of-care (POC)
sites by six technicians at the POC sites. The technicians were provided with no other

instructions other than the instrument manual and the test strip labeling. The results
from the precision evaluation are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity for the device was evaluated by visual reading and instrumental reading on
the Healgen 500 and 800 by repeated testing of urine specimen containing known
concentration of analytes. Negative samples and samples with pH or specific gravity
at different levels were obtained by testing clinical samples with the predicate device.
Those samples confirmed to be negative or expected were selected for the study.
Positive samples were obtained by adding known amounts of analytes to negative
control and confirming the expected value using the predicate device. Samples with
specified values of pH or specific gravity were obtained by titration. Blind and
random testing of samples was completed by two experimenters. Ten replicates for
each strip from 3 manufacturing lots (n = 30) were tested with each sample. The
percentages of exact match and ±1 color block match of reported result to expected
result were calculated and recorded as shown below:

months from the manufacture date. If exposed to air with temperature of 15-30°C
and relative humidity of 65-85%, the strips can be stored at least 12 hours.”
The manufacturer claims that the temperature of working environment for the
Healgen 500 and 800 analyzers is 18-30°C with an optimum temperature range of 20-
25°C and a relative humidity should be less than 80%.
No urinalysis controls are provided with the device. The sponsor recommends using
commercially available positive and negative controls. Labeling also recommends
the following:
· That two levels of commercially available controls are analyzed following
laboratory policies and local, state and federal guidelines.
· Test commercially available positive and negative quality controls with each new
lot, each new shipment of strips, and when a new bottle of reagent strips is
opened.
· Water should not be used as a negative control.
d. Detection limit:
The cut-off evaluation was conducted using 20 replicates for each type of strip and
each reading method. Negative and positive samples at different levels were
confirmed by testing clinical samples with the predicate device. Positive samples
were prepared by adding known amounts of analyte to negative samples. The cut-off
for each analyte is defined as the value at which 50% of the test results are positive.
The cut-off values for each strip format on all reading modes are shown in the tables
below.

e. Analytical specificity:
To evaluate interferences, known amounts of potential interfering substances were
added to urine samples and tested using the Healgen 11 strip format. Five test strips
from each of 3 lots were evaluated, in replicates of 15, for each interference test using
the 3 reading modes (visual, Healgen 500, and Healgen 800). Analyte levels
(positive, negative) were confirmed with the predicate method. Two levels of each
analyte and 3 levels of interfering substance per analyte were evaluated in the study.
Interference is defined by the sponsor as: a) For negative or lower level samples, with
the presence of one potential interfering substance in a certain concentration, and no
change of other conditions in the test system, if the reported results are ≥2 color
blocks different from the expected results (any positive result for nitrite), it is
interference. And if ±1 color block match with the expected values (only negative for
nitrite), it is non-interference. B) For positive or higher level samples, with the presence
of one potential interfering substance in a certain concentration, and no change of other
conditions in the test system, if the reported results ≥2 color blocks different from the
expected results (only negative for nitrite), it is an interference. And if ±1 color block
match with the expected values (not negative for nitrite), it is non-interference.
Concentrations of the potentially interfering substances that will not have influence
on the test results are shown below:

The following limitations were observed and added to the strips instructions for use:
A high glucose concentration (≥ 2000 mg/dL) or a high specific gravity in urine may
reduce the sensitivity of the test of leukocytes.
A high concentration of ascorbic acid (≥ 50 mg/dL) may cause a false negative result
of bilirubin, blood, nitrite, and glucose.
Presence of oxidants (hypochlorite ≥ 50 mg/L, chlorine ≥ 5 mg/dL, and peroxide ≥ 5
mg/L) will reduce the sensitivity of ascorbic acid in urine and lead to false positive
results of blood in urine.
f. Assay cut-off:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Comparison studies were performed at three different POC sites between the Healgen
strips and the predicate method by visual and instrument readings. Urine samples
were collected as indicated in the instructions for use and tested by 5 persons in each
POC site (15 persons in total). The operators were blinded by masking the urine
sample receptacles before being sent to them. Number of patient samples tested for
each analyte was 100 (i.e. 33-34 patient samples tested at each of the 3 sites). The
patient samples were collected so that at least 40 to 50% of the samples were positive
across the measuring range of each analyte, and at least 10% of the samples were
around the cutoff of each analyte. Results of the comparison study for the combined
sites are shown in the table below.
