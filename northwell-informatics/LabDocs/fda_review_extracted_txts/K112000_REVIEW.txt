I. Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is essentially a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated
version of the doubling dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC). Each VITEK 2 AST card contains 64 wells. A control well
which only contains microbiological culture media is resident on all cards. The
remaining wells contain premeasured portions of a specific antibiotic combined with
culture media. The bacterial or yeast isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized
concentration with 0.45 – 0.5% saline before being used to rehydrate the
antimicrobial medium within the card. The VITEK 2 System automatically fills, seals
and places the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual
filling, sealing and loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of
each well in the card over a defined period of time. At the completion of the
incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the
interpretive category result for each antibiotic contained on the card.
The VITEK 2 AST-ST Penicillin has the following concentrations in the card: 0.06,
0.125, 0.5, and 2 µg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in
μg/mL). The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 card is ≤ 0.06 – ≥ 8 μg/mL.
The MIC ranges, interpretive criteria and equivalent concentrations are as follows:

L. Test Principle:
Automated growth based detection using attenuation of light measured by an optical
scanner. The optics used in the systems use visible light to directly measure organism
growth. Transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before
significant growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same
well measure organism growth by how much light is prevented from going through
the well. The VITEK 2 System monitors the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period of time. An interpretive call is made between 4 and 16 hours for a
“rapid” read but may be extended to 18 hours in some instances. At the completion of
the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the
interpretive category result for each antibiotic on the card.
The VITEK 2 AST-ST Penicillin has the following concentrations in the card: 0.06,
0.125, 0.5, and 2 µg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in
μg/mL). The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 card is ≤ 0.06 – ≥ 8 μg/mL.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three external clinical sites. Ten
Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were tested at each site and testing was
performed in triplicate over three days with the VITEK 2 AST-ST Penicillin
card. Only S. pneumoniae isolates were used because of the difficulty in
obtaining on-scale isolates with other Streptococcus species. The testing was
performed using both the manual dilution method and the automated dilution
mode. Testing was conducted on the VITEK 2 instrument.
For the sake of reproducibility calculations, off-scale values are handled in
two ways; “best case” and “worst case” scenarios. Best case calculation for
reproducibility assumes the off-scale result is within one well from the mode
MIC value. Worst case calculation for reproducibility assuming the off-scale
result is greater than one well from the mode MIC value.
The overall reproducibility was >95% with +/- one dilution observation for
the VITEK 2 and the VITEK 2 Compact system. Only Manual Dilution
testing was conducted since the VITEK 2 Compact system does not have a
functionality to support automatic dilution to inoculate the card. Results were
as follows:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended Streptococcus pneumonia QC organism was tested on
every test occasion with the reference method and the VITEK 2 System.
The reference method QC results were in range for every day tested. The
VITEK 2 was tested a sufficient number of times to demonstrate that the
system can produce QC results in the recommended range.
Quality Control was performed during the studies using both the auto-dilution
and the manual method of diluting the organisms on the VITEK 2 System.
Results demonstrated that methods were comparable.
Quality Control Results with the VITEK 2 System for Penicillin were as
follows:
Concentration Auto Dilution Manual Dilution
Organism (µg/mL) Reference VITEK 2 Reference VITEK 2
Streptococcus 0.06*
pneumonia ATCC 0.12*

Acceptable MIC 1* 3 2 3 9
range: 2*
0.25-1 µg/mL 4*
8*
* VITEK Card Result Range is ≤ 0.06 – ≥ 8
At least one Quality control organism was in control in the reference on all
days. Quality Control results for the VITEK 2 System using either inoculation
dilution method demonstrated that the VITEK 2 System could produce the
expected quality control results.
A similar QC study was conducted to evaluate the VITEK 2 Compact System.
Results were compared to the expected FDA/CLSI QC results. With the

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Performance was established through a clinical study which was conducted at
four external study sites. A total of 1375 clinical isolates were tested by
VITEK 2 AST-ST Penicillin with the VITEK® 2 System. The majority of the
isolates were recently isolated from clinical specimens. Four hundred fifty
seven of the 1375 clinical isolates tested were stock isolates (33.3%). The total
number of viable clinical isolates evaluated was 1366. A challenge set
consisting of 208 isolates was also evaluated with VITEK 2 AST-ST
Penicillin. Testing of clinical isolates was performed using the automated
method of inoculation and the challenge organisms were tested with both the
manual dilution and automatic dilution. Each isolate was tested by the VITEK
2 AST-ST Penicillin and the CLSI broth microdilution reference method. The
inoculum was prepared with direct colony suspension. A comparison was
provided to the reference method with the agreement shown in the following
tables. Fifty (3.2%) minor errors were seen with no major or very major
errors. No growth was observed in 9 isolates.

Because two separate breakpoints exist for penicillin when testing Streptococcus
pneumoniae depending on the infection source, data was analyzed to evaluate performance
based on the pneumonia and meningitis breakpoints separately as shown in the tables
below. For the pneumonia breakpoint, 27 (7.7%) minor categorical errors were seen with
no major errors. Of 350 total isolates of S. pneumoniae, none were considered resistant
based on the penicillin breakpoint for pneumonia. Therefore, very major error rates
could not be determined for S. pneumoniae.

Essential agreement (EA) is when the VITEK 2 panels agree with the
reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the
reference method. Category agreement (CA) is when the VITEK 2 panel
result interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result
interpretation. Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the
VITEK 2 and the reference and have on-scale EA.
The vast majority of evaluable results were based on S. pneumoniae and
viridans streptococci. A high agreement was observed for combined
Streptococci with a total EA of 99.1%, evaluable EA of 97.1% and a CA of
96.8%. Similarly, as shown in the above table, high agreement was observed
for S. pneumoniae isolates based on the penicillin interpretive criteria for
meningitis or pneumonia. This level of EA and CA is acceptable.
Because of the absence of an intermediate breakpoint, the results showed 6
(3.2%) major and 2 (1.2%) very major errors. This error rate was considered
acceptable given the very high overall CA agreement and five were within EA
and could have been minor errors if there was an intermediate category.
Performance of the VITEK® 2 and the VITEK® 2 Compact was also
evaluated with the same 208 challenge organisms using the manual dilution
method. A comparison was provided to the reference method with the
following agreement as shown below.
