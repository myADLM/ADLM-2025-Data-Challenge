L. Test Principle:
The Premier Hb9210 employs the principles of boronate affinity and high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC). The pumps transfer reagents through the analytical column. The
analytical column contains aminophenylboronic acid bonded to a porous polymer support
(gel). When the hemolysate passes through the column, the glycated component is retained
by the complexing of its diol groups with the boronate. After the unretained non-glycated
component elutes from the column, the glycated component is eluted from the column with a
reagent that displaces it from the boronate. A spectrophotometric detector will measure the
absorbance of the eluates at 413± 2 nm. The instrument can report out either the %HbA1c
(NGSP) or the IFCC mmol/mol units.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor conducted a linearity study according to the CLSI EP6-A guideline using
EDTA whole blood samples. The linearity study used a high and a low patient pool to
create additional intermediate levels of samples. A total of 7 samples with HbA1c
concentrations ranging from 3.8% to 23.1% were tested in triplicate on the Premier
Hb9210. The linear regression generated by plotting the expected values against the
observed values was:
Y= 0.9823X – 0.2297, r2= 0.9958
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claim that the assay is linear from 3.8 to
18.5% A1c. This assay has a claimed measuring range of 3.8 to 18.5% A1c.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The Premier Hb9210 method is traceable to the Diabetes Control and Complications
Trial (DCCT) Method for Measurement of HbA1c. HbA1c values are reported
according to the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP)
recommendations at the DCCT level.
The sponsor has documented traceability to the NGSP’s recommended accuracy base
for Hbg A1c by performing a direct comparison with a Secondary Reference
Laboratory (SRL) using 40 fresh human specimens. An NGSP certification was
provided with an expiration date of May 1, 2012. NGSP certification expires one
year from the certification date and needs to be renewed annually.
Calibrators and control materials are commercially available and have been
previously cleared in k936204 and k940143.
Samples stability:
A sample stability study using whole blood (and associated hemolysate) specimens at
3 different A1c concentrations were analyzed by the Premier Hb9210 method on day
0, then divided into aliquots stored at five different temperatures (37 o C, 20-25 o C, 2-
6 o C, -20 o C, and -70 o C). Hemolysates are made from the fresh whole blood sample
with a 1:100 dilution with sample diluent. Sample stability study protocol and
acceptance criteria has been provided and found to be adequate. Whole blood and
hemolysate storage stability claims are listed in the table below:
Sample type -70 o C -20 o C 2-6 o C 20-25 o C 37 o C
Whole blood 1 year 10 days 10 days 6 days 1 day
Hemolysate 1 year 10 days 7 days 1 day 1 day

The sponsor stated the following in their limitations in their labeling:
“Do not freeze/thaw samples more than once. Because the potential exists for
thawing in a “frost-free” freezer, avoid storage of specimens in a frost-free freezer.”
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit is the lowest concentration that the assay can detect by linearity.
See linearity study in M.1.b. above.
e. Analytical specificity:
i.) Studies were performed to assess common or known substances that could
interfere with the Premier Hb9210. The interfering substances were evaluated in
whole blood EDTA samples that contained two different concentrations of A1c (~6%
and ~12%). Samples containing various concentrations of potential interferents were
tested and the results compared to those obtained from control samples containing no
potential interfering substances. The sponsor’s definition of non-significant
interference is ≤ 10% difference between the tested and the control samples.
The percent difference between the control sample and the sample spiked with the
potential interfering substances was no greater than +/-10% for concentrations at or
below those listed in the following table.
Potential interfering Concentration at which no
substance significant interference
(≤10%) was observed
Acetylsalicylic acid(Aspirin) ≤ 90 mg/dL
Acetaldehyde ≤ 25 mg/dL
Bilirubin ≤ 20 mg/dL
Carbamylated Hgb ≤ 65 mg/dL
Triglyceride ≤ 3317 mg/dL
Sodium heparin ≤ 450 USP
EDTA ≤ 1440 mg/dL
Sodium fluoride ≤ 1157 mg/dL
ii.) To study the interference from labile A1c, three EDTA whole blood patients’
samples with A1c concentrations approximately at 5%, 7% and 11% were split into
aliquots. These aliquots were supplemented by the addition of an aqueous glucose
stock solution; up to 1500 mg/dL of glucose solution was tested. The samples were
incubated for three hours at 37°C to facilitate formation of labile A1c. The samples
were then run on the Premier Hb9210 in duplicate. The sponsor’s definition of non-
significant interference is ≤ 5% difference between the spiked and non-spiked
7

[Table 1 on page 7]
Potential interfering

significant interference
(≤10%) was observed
Acetylsalicylic acid(Aspirin)	≤ 90 mg/dL
Acetaldehyde	≤ 25 mg/dL
Bilirubin	≤ 20 mg/dL
Carbamylated Hgb	≤ 65 mg/dL
Triglyceride	≤ 3317 mg/dL
Sodium heparin	≤ 450 USP
EDTA	≤ 1440 mg/dL
Sodium fluoride	≤ 1157 mg/dL

samples.
The sponsor concluded that labile A1c concentrations up to 1500 mg/dL do not
interfere with the assay.
iii.) To study the interference at multiple variant concentrations for variants S, C, D,
E, and F, patient samples with known concentrations of variant were mixed together
with samples that did not have any variants in different proportions. All samples
were tested using the Premier Hb9210 and a commercially available method that was
free of interference from the variants. The sponsor’s definition of non-significant
interference is ≤ 7% difference between the candidate method and the comparative
method.
Based on the data, the sponsor claimed that no significant interference was observed
for HbAS up to 35.8%, HbAC up to 34.8%, HbAD up to 28.9%, HbAE up to 16.9%
and HbF up to 20.9%.
In the package insert the manufacturer has stated the following limitations:
Abnormal RBC survival- Correct HbA1c analysis depends on stable
hemoglobin with typical lifespan. As with all HbA1c analytical
methodologies, patients with shortened RBC life, such as occurs in
hemolytic anemia, will exhibit decreased HbA1c values, with the decreased
life span dependent upon the severity of the anemia and/or the presence of
unstable hemoglobins like Hb SS, Hb CC, and Hb SC. Patients with
extended red cell life such as polycythemia or after splenectomy, may
exhibit increased HbA1c results. Iron deficiency anemia may yield falsely
high results. GPP and/or fructosamine assays are recommended for these
conditions.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were performed according to the CLSI EP9-A2 guideline.
48 whole blood EDTA samples with % HbA1c ranging from 4.4% to 16.2 % were
analyzed in singlet on both the Premier Hb9210 analyzer (candidate device) and the
Ultra 2 analyzer (predicate device).
The linear regression correlation was calculated as follows:
8

--- Page 9 ---
Y= 1.0069X - 0.1214, r2= 0.9962 (X=predicate method, Y=candidate method)
95%CI of slope is 0.990 to 1.026
95%CI of intercept is -0.0316 to 0.2675
b. Matrix comparison:
Matrix comparison study was performed to evaluate different anticoagulants. 27
whole blood (venous) samples were collected in EDTA, Sodium heparin, and Sodium
fluoride blood collection tubes. In addition, 20 matched capillary (fingersticks)
samples were collected and compared to the venous EDTA whole blood samples. All
samples were run in singlet on the Premier Hb 9210 system. The linear regressions
results were summarized as follow:
For venous Sodium heparin samples vs. the EDTA whole blood samples:
Y= 0.999X - 0.0057, r 2= 0.9984, N=27, sample range was 4.6-17.0%
For venous Sodium fluoride samples vs. the EDTA whole blood samples:
Y= 1.0106X - 0.0885, r2 = 0.9989, N=27, sample range was 4.3-17.5%
For finger-sticks samples vs. the EDTA whole blood samples:
Y= 0.9946X - 0.0358, r 2= 0.9994, N=20, sample range was 4.4- 12.7%
The sponsor claimed that whole blood samples from capillary (finger-stick) or EDTA
venous samples are the recommended samples. In addition, anticoagulant tubes with
sodium heparin or sodium fluoride are acceptable for use with the device.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected %HbA1c value for patients with diabetes will depend on physician discretion.
The American Diabetes Association’s (ADA) most recent Clinical Practice Recommendation
of diabetes specifies a treatment goal of 7% or less and suggests additional action when the
HbA1c level is above 8%*.

--- Page 11 ---
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
There are 3 sample rack types: whole blood, hemolysate and anemic. Each rack has a
unique identification letter and number with corresponding barcode. W for whole blood,
H is for hemolysate, and A is for anemic. All racks hold standard 13x75 mm sample
tubes with septum. Whole blood samples do not need to be re-mixed (either settled or
mixed are both acceptable). Capillary fingersticks, EDTA whole blood, Sodium heparin
whole blood, and Sodium fluoride whole blood are all acceptable sample types.
5. Calibration:
Calibration with two levels of whole blood calibrators must be carried out with each
batch run and be accepted before calculations of controls and patients results. Calibrator
materials are commercially available and have been cleared in k936204
6. Quality Control:
Two levels of quality control materials (whole blood) must be run with each batch. The
QC materials are held in a 5-position QC wheel on the instrument. Control materials are
commercially available and have been cleared in k940143.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. A study to assess any potential carry-over of the Premier 9210 system was performed.
Ten different samples with different concentrations of HbA1c were tested 4 separate
times per day over a 5 day period. Multiple linear regression analyses and precision data
were calculated for all the test results. The protocol and acceptance criteria were found to
be adequate.
2. Packed red blood cells and anemic samples were evaluated to demonstrate that there is no
effect from sample hemoglobin concentration on the results generated by the candidate
assay. 3 levels of samples with different A1c concentrations (5%, 7%, and 9%) were
tested. All the results generated were within 5% bias when compared to the same sample
that had a normal hemoglobin concentration.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
