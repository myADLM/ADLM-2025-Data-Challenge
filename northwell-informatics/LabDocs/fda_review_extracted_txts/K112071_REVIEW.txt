2. Indication(s) for use:
Wondfo Cocaine Urine Test:
Wondfo Cocaine Urine Test is an immunochromatographic assay for the
qualitative determination of Benzolecgonine in human urine at a cutoff
concentration of 300 ng/mL. The test is available in a dip card format and a cup
format. It is intended for prescription use and over the counter use.
The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative
chemical method must be used in order to obtain a conformed analytical result.
GC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and
professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result,
particularly when the preliminary result is positive.
Wondfo Methamphetamine Urine Test:
Wondfo Methamphetamine Urine Test is an immunochromatographic assay for
the qualitative determination of D(+)-Methamphetamine in human urine at a
cutoff concentration of 1000 ng/mL. The test is available in a dip card format and

L. Test Principle:
Wondfo Methamphetamine and Cocaine Urine Tests are one-step lateral flow
immunoassays containing a conjugate pad with colloidal gold with anti-drug
antibodies, a nitrocellulose membrane, with a test line (T) and a control line (C). The
T line is coated with drug antigen bound to duck egg protein and the C line is coated
with goat anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibodies. The test is a competitive binding
immunoassay in which drugs and drug metabolites in a urine sample compete with
immobilized drug conjugate for limited labeled antibody binding sites. When a
sufficient amount of sample is applied, the sample migrates through the test device by
capillary action. If the concentration of drug is below the cutoff level, the anti-drug
antibodies in the colloidal gold particles will bind to the drug antigens coated in the
test zone producing a band which indicates a negative result. If the drug
concentration is at the cutoff level or higher no band will form in the test zone (test
line T) indicating a preliminary positive. A band should form in the control region
regardless of the presence of drug or metabolite in the sample.

The precision study was conducted by three operators. Three different lots
were tested for cocaine and methamphetamine using 12 devices/ lot at each
control level of negative, -75%, -50%, -25%, cut-off, +25%, +50%, +75%,
and +100% of the cut-off. Samples were prepared, concentrations of each
sample confirmed by GC/MS, and then each sample was divided into 300
aliquots. The 300 sample aliquots were divided into 12 sets of 25 for each test
format (cup/dipcard). The study was conducted over a 25 day period and ran
3 batches of each test format (cup/dipcard) in 2 runs/day. Each device was
tested and interpreted by the same operator. Summaries are presented in the
following tables:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable, the assay is intended for qualitative use.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This device has internal process controls. A colored line appearing in the
control region confirms sufficient sample volume and adequate membrane
wicking. Users are informed that the test is invalid if a line fails to appear in
the control region.
Control standards are not supplied with this device; however it is good
laboratory practice to confirm the test procedure and to verify proper test
performance. Users should follow all applicable guidelines for testing QC
materials.
Stability:
Accelerated stability and real time stability tests were performed on three
batches of cups and dip card strips for the Wondfo Methamphetamine and
Cocaine Urine tests. Accelerated stability and real time stability studies were
performed and the results support Wondfo’s claimed shelf life of 23 months
at 4°C and 30ºC for the cocaine urine tests and a shelf life of 24 months at 4ºC
and 30ºC for the methamphetamine urine tests.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical performance of the device around the cutoff is described in

Section f. (Assay cut-off) below.
e. Analytical specificity:
To evaluate specificity of the urine cocaine and methamphetamine urine
devices, three batches of urine samples were tested by taking 30 negative
urine samples and spiking these samples with three different analyte
concentration levels. Two different groups of operators were assigned to test
blinded urine samples (three operators tested the cup format and three
operators tested the dip stick format). Percent cross reactivity of a compound
was calculated by dividing the cutoff concentration by the minimum
concentration required to obtain a positive result and multiplying by 100%.
Summary of the results are as follows:
Cocaine
COC(Cocaine) Result % Cross-Reactivity
(Benzoylecgonine, Positive at 300 ng/mL 100%
Cutoff=300ng/mL)
Cocaine HCl Positive at 750 ng/mL 40%
Cocaethylene Positive at 12,500 ng/mL 2.4%
Ecgonine
Positive at 32,000 ng/mL <1%
Met:
MET(Methamphetamine) Result % Cross-Reactivity
(D(+)-Methamphetamine, Cutoff=1000 ng/mL) Positive at 1,000 ng/mL 100%
D-Amphetamine Positive at 50,000 ng/mL 2%
Chloroquine Positive at 50,000 ng/mL 2%
(+/-)-Ephedrine Positive at 50,000 ng/mL 2%
(-)-Methamphetamine Positive at 25,000 ng/mL 4%
(+/-)3,4-methylenedioxumethamphetamine(MDMA) Positive at 2,000 ng/mL 50%
β-Phenylethylamine Positive at 50,000 ng/mL 2%
Trimethobenzamide Positive at 10,000 ng/mL 10%
Interference Studies:
Interference studies were performed using the cup and dipcard tests using
urine controls at +/-25% of each analyte cut-off concentration. Potential
interferences to the Wondfo cocaine and methamphetamine urine cup and
dipcard tests were evaluated by adding various drugs, drug metabolites, and
other compounds (structurally unrelated and endogenous compounds) that are
commonly found in the urine which may interfere with testing results. The
following compounds were found not to cross react when tested at
concentrations of 100 µg/mL.

pH:
The pH of an aliquoted negative urine pool was adjusted to pH 4, pH 5, pH 6,
pH 7, pH 8, or pH 9 was spiked with +/- 25% of the cut-off concentration of
benzoylecgonine and D(+) – Methamphetamine. Each was individually tested
using three batches of strips and three batches of the cup format. The spiked,
pH-adjusted urine was tested in triplicate. Varying the pH did not affect the
accuracy of each test format (dipcard and cup).
Specific Gravity:
Twelve drug-free urine samples with specific gravities (1.000-1.035) and
spiked with +/- 25% of the cut-off concentration of benzoylecgonine and D
(+) – Methamphetamine using three batches of strips and three batches of the
cup format. The spiked urine samples were tested in triplicate. The results
show that varying the specific gravity does not affect the accuracy of each test
format (dipcard and cup).
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut off established by collecting 25 clinical urine samples
containing +/- 50% of the cocaine cutoff of 300 ng/ml and 25 clinical urine
samples containing +/- 50% of the methamphetamine cutoff of 1000 ng/mL.
Additionally, 125 drug-free clinical urine samples spiked with cocaine and
125 drug-free clinical urine samples spiked with methamphetamine were both
diluted from the International Drug Standard (Sigma) to concentrations: -50%,
-25%, cutoff, +25%, and +50% of the cocaine cutoff 300 ng/mL and
methamphetamine cutoff 1000ng/mL. The clinical urine samples were
collected from the Shenzhen Drug Addiction Recovery Center and drug
concentrations were confirmed by GC/MS. Results were read by three
laboratory assistants with relevant experience. There cutoff studies were
performed by two separate groups of operators (one for the dipcard format and
one for the cup format). Three operators in each group performed the
readings and they were blinded to the samples. Each result was confirmed by
two other assistants. The results of the study are as follows:

Performance of the Wondfo Cocaine and Methamphetamine Urine Tests
(dipcard and cup formats) were established by comparing 80 samples (40
positive and 40 negative) of each analyte against GC/MS. Ten of the 80
samples came from drug-free urine samples. Each result was read by three
laboratory assistants and a lay person. All urine samples were collected at the
Shenzhen Drug Addiction Recovery Center. A summary of results comparing
the results of the lay person to the experienced person are as follows:

methamphetamine. Additionally, a negative urine pool with no drug was
tested. The six spiked urine samples and the negative urine pool
concentrations were confirmed by GC/MS and aliquoted into 40 individual
containers per concentration (n=280 aliquots, 20 aliquots per concentration
per test format). Testing was performed at three sites by 140 blinded
consumers divided between three sites (140 lay-users for the cup format and
140 lay-users for the dipcard format). The lay users were chosen from likely
intended users at the Shenzhen Drug Addiction Recovery Center, Guangzhou
Red Cross Hospital, and Guangzhou Mental Hospital. Each participant
received the package insert, 1 blinded sample, and either a cup or dipcard test
format. The lay persons test result was compared to the GC/MS result to
demonstrate accuracy by lay-users. The following are the results of the lay-
