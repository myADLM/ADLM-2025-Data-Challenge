4. Special instrument Requirements:
VITEK® 2 and the VITEK® 2 Compact Systems
I. Device Description:
Each VITEK® 2 test card contains 64 micro-wells. A control well which contains
only microbiological culture media is resident on all cards. The remaining wells
contain premeasured portions of a specific antibiotic combined with culture
media. The bacterial or yeast isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized
concentration with 0.45 – 0.5% saline before being used to rehydrate the
antimicrobial medium within the card. The VITEK 2 System automatically fills,
seals and places the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a
manual filling, sealing and loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the
growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time. At the completion
of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along
with the interpretive category result for each antibiotic contained on the card.
The VITEK 2 AST-ST Ampicillin has the following concentrations in the card:
0.5, 1, 4 and 8μg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in
μg/mL). The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 card is ≤0.25 – ≥ 16μg/mL.

L. Test Principle:
Each VITEK® 2 test card contains 64 micro-wells. A control well which contains
only microbiological culture media is resident on all cards. The remaining wells
contain premeasured portions of a specific antibiotic combined with culture media.
The bacterial or yeast isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration
with 0.45 – 0.5% saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium
within the card. The VITEK 2 System automatically fills, seals and places the card
into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing and
loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card
over a defined period of time. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is
generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for
each antibiotic contained on the card.
The VITEK 2 AST-ST Ampicillin has the following concentrations in the card:, 0.5,
1, 4, and 8μg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in μg/mL).
The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 card is ≤0.25 – ≥ 16μg/mL.
In addition to the automatic dilution, there is also a manual inoculation dilution
procedure described in the package insert.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using 10 isolates at 3 sites on 3 separate
days in triplicates. The study included the Auto-dilution and the Manual
dilution with the VITEK®2, and the Manual dilution with the VITEK®2
Compact. All results were >95% reproducible.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
The recommended QC isolates were tested on every test occasion with the
reference method and the VITEK®2. The reference method QC results
were in range for every day tested. The VITEK®2 was tested a sufficient
number of times to demonstrate that the system can produce QC results in
the recommended range.
Quality Control was performed during the studies using both the auto-
dilution and the manual method of diluting the organisms. Results
demonstrated that methods were comparable with the same mode.
