L. Test Principle:
The Polymed Therapeutics Fastep™ hCG Pregnancy Serum/Urine Cassette Tests is
aqualitative, lateral flow sandwich immunochromatographic assay for the detection of human
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in serum and urine. The membrane is pre-coated with
monoclonal anti-hCG antibodies on the test band region and anti-mouse antibodies in the
control band region. During testing, the sample reacts with the dye conjugate (mouse anti-
hCG antibody-colloidal gold conjugate) which has been pre-coated on the test strip. The
mixture them migrates upward on the membrane chromatographically by capillary action to
react with anti-hCG antibodies on the membrane and generate a colored line. One colored
line appears in the control region “C” regardless of the presence of hCG. The presence of this
colored line in the “C” region serves as verification for sufficient volume and proper flow
and as a control for the reagents. The absence of the test line in the “T” region indicates a
negative result. Two colored lines should be observed in the viewing window at the “C” and
“T” regions in order to indicate a positive result. No line in the “C” region will indicate that
the test is invalid and needs to be repeated.

device by the intended operators. The study was conducted at 3 healthcare POC sites
by 9 healthcare professionals (HCPs) (3 operators per site). 3 different lots (one lot
per site) were used for the study. The reproducibility of the device was evaluated by
testing negative urine and serum samples spiked with hCG, traceable to WHO
International 4th Standard, (0 mIU/ml, 10 mIU/ml, 15 mIU/ml, 20mIU/ml, 40mIU/ml
and 100mIU/ml). All samples were blinded to the HCPs. Each concentration level
was tested 5 times a day for 5 consecutive days. The results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity is not applicable since this is a qualitative test.
A high dose hook effect study was performed by spiking high levels of hCG
concentrations 0-1,000,000 mIU/ml (0, 10, 20, 100, 62,500, 125,000, 250,000,
500,000 and 1,000,000) into negative urine and serum samples and evaluating the test
result lines. A positive result was observed up to 1,000,000 mIU/ml. Therefore no
hook effect was observed for urine/serum samples with hCG concentrations up to
1,000,000 mIU/ml.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Polymed Therapeutics Fastep™ hCG Pregnancy Serum/Urine Cassette and
Dipstick Test is standardized to the WHO Fourth International Standard 75/589

A shelf-life stability test of the device was performed in real-time and the results
showed that the device is stable for 24 months when stored at 2-8˚C or room
temperature (up to 30˚C). This is a single use device and labeling states that test
should be performed immediately after opening pouch.
d. Detection limit:
The sensitivity of the device was tested by spiking pooled male urine and serum with
varying concentrations (0, 10, 12.5, 15.0, 17.5, 20, 24, 30.0, 35.0, 40, and 100

e. Analytical specificity:
i.) A cross-reactivity study was performed by adding known amounts of LH, FSH
and TSH to pooled negative urine and serum samples. Samples were tested in
duplicate. Samples were tested at 0 and 20 mIU/ml of hCG. The cross-reactivity
results are shown below:
Urine hCG:
Concentration HCG 0 mIU/ml HCG 20 mIU/ml
(IU/ml) Result 1 Result 2 Result 1 Result 2
LH 300 mIU/mL (-) (-) (+) (+)
FSH 1000 mIU/mL (-) (-) (+) (+)
TSH 1000 µIU/ml (-) (-) (+) (+)
Serum hCG
Concentration HCG 0 mIU/ml HCG 20 mIU/ml
(IU/ml) Result 1 Result 2 Result 1 Result 2
LH 300 mIU/mL (-) (-) (+) (+)
FSH 1000 mIU/mL (-) (-) (+) (+)
TSH 1000 µIU/ml (-) (-) (+) (+)
No cross-reactivity was observed for either urine or serum samples at the
concentrations that were tested for LH, FSH and TSH.
ii.) An interference study was performed by adding known amounts of potential
interfering substances to urine and serum samples that contain 0 and 20, mIU/mL of
hCG. The sponsor states that none of the following substances at the stated
concentrations interfere with the assay.

iii.) A pH study was performed to evaluate the device and the sponsor concluded that
urine and serum samples with pH 3.0 – 8.5 would not affect the results.
iv.) A specific gravity study was performed to evaluate the device and the sponsor
concluded that the performance of Fastep hCG Serum/Urine Pregnancy test at
negative and cutoff points are not affected when the specific gravity range of urine
specimens is at 1.00 to 1.03.
v.) Interference studies to β-core hCG were also performed; the results indicate there
was no interference with β-core hCG up to 8.53 pmol/L

See 1.d. above
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed comparing the Fastep™ cassette panel to
the Teco One-Step Combo Card Test (predicate device). Testing was conducted by
one HCP at 4 POC sites. 19-46 individuals per site were enrolled in the study
(N=145). The samples were collected from women who fit the following categories:
childbearing age, suspected pregnant women, (e.g. within days of missing the
expected menses), women early in pregnancy, (e.g. within the first 30 days of
pregnancy), and the first trimester of pregnancy. All samples were masked prior to
analysis. Testing was performed according to the labeling.
