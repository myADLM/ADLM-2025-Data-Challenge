M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The five levels of the CalCheck 5 kit are assigned based on the measuring range of
the assay. Each level was standardized using the Elecsys Myoglobin STAT assay,
which was standardized against an in-house reference preparation as follow: 1) There
is no international standard for myoglobin. A stock solution of Myoglobin antigen is
prepared by weighing in myoglobin antigen purchased from a commercial vendor and
then dissolving it in Human sera (buffered to pH 7.0). 2) The different master
calibrators are prepared by weighing in the necessary amount of stock solution and
diluting it accordingly with the buffered human serum. 3) Finally, bottles are filled
with the master calibrators and lyophilized.
Once the produced CalChecks are determined to meet the specifications, the Elecsys
Myoglobin CalCheck 5 is released for the value assignment utilizing the Elecsys 2010
master calibration curve to calculate ng/mL from corresponding magnitudes of
chemiluminescent emission detected by a photomultiplier.
Value Assignment:
For each Elecsys Myoglobin CalCheck 5 lot manufactured, the CalChecks are assayed in
duplicate on at least three Elecsys 2010 analyzers. The assigned value of each CalCheck
is defined as the median value obtained over at least 6 determinations (duplicate runs on
at least 3 analyzers) of the respective CalCheck. The assigned range is defined as ±27%
of the assigned value for levels 2 (7% CV) and ±30% of the assigned value for level 3-
5(10% CV).
Reagent-specific value assignments were performed for each lot of Elecsys
Myoglobain CalCheck 5 in combination with each Elecsys Myoglobin 18-minute
assay and Elecsys Myoglobin STAT (9-minute assay, k083260) reagent lot using 8
Elecsys 2010 analyzers once a day in a total of 8 runs. To ensure the values assigned
using the master platform are transferrable and valid for the other instrument platforms,
the same value assignment procedure is performed separately using cobas e 411,
cobas e 601 / Cobas e 602 immunoassay analyzers. For MODULAR ANALYTICS
4

--- Page 5 ---
E170, only 18-minute reagent was performed because no STAT (9-minute)
functionality is available on this analyzer. The assigned values obtained on the
additional analyzers are compared to those obtained on the Elecsys 2010.
Acceptance criteria for all stages of the process were met. It is stated in the package
inserts that each laboratory should establish appropriate acceptance criteria when
using this product for its intended use.
Stability:
Opened-vial and accelerated Shelf-life stability studies were performed to verify the
stability claims for the Elecsys Myoglobin CalCheck 5 on the cobas e 411. Since
these studies are not analyzer-dependent, these results can be applied to the
MODULAR ANALYTICS E170, Elecsys 2010, cobas e 601, and cobas e 602.
1) Open-Vial Stability: Real-time testing was performed for the Elecsys
Myoglobin CalCheck 5. The data support the package insert claims that
reconstituted Elecsys Myoglobin CalCheck 5 is stable up to 4 hours at 20-
25°C.
2) Shelf-life stability: The accelerated stability testing performed supports an
initial shelf-life claim of 15 months when the Elecsys Myoglobin CalCheck 5
are stored under normal storage conditions of 2-8°C. Real-time testing at 2-
8°C is on-going to support a claim of 24 months.
