L. Test Principle:
This assay measures the fibrin degradation product D-dimer, which is present in the
blood after a blood clot is degraded by fibrinolysis. The Diazyme D-Dimer Assay is a
latex enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay in which anti-D-dimer coated latex
particles bind to the D-dimer proteins present in the sample, causing agglutination.
The degree of turbidity is assessed optically and is proportional to the amount of D-
dimer present in the sample. The actual amount of D-dimer is determined from a
calibration curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All analytical studies were performed on the Roche Modular P instrument.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated according to CLSI EP5-A2. Three levels of D-Dimer
controls (0.97, 2.99 and 7.47 µg/mL FEU), one unaltered pooled plasma
sample (0.6 µg/mL FEU) and two plasma pools spiked with D-Dimer stock
solution at levels of 2.41 µg/mL and 7.47 µg/mL FEU were tested. Samples
were tested in duplicate, with 2 runs per day over 20 working days using
three reagent and three calibrator lots. Acceptable criteria of CV≤ 8% for
analyte concentrations greater than 0.05 µg/mL FEU were met. The table
below represents results for the combined data.

A reproducibility study was performed at three external testing sites. Testing
included three reagent and calibrator lots. Four samples of citrated patient
plasmas ranging from 0.36 µg/mL to 7.2 µg/mL FEU were tested in duplicate
for 2 runs per day for 5 non-consecutive days. Statistical evaluation was
applied to identify sources of variability. Within-run, between-run, between-
day, between-lot (operator, site and instrument) and total precision were
calculated. Results met acceptance criteria for CV <10%; <0.5 µg/mL FEU
SD 0.05 µg/mL FEU, as summarized in the table below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was demonstrated following CLSI EP6-A. An 11-point linearity set
was prepared from a plasma sample containing 8.3 µg/mL FEU by dilution
of the plasma sample with saline at varying ratios. Samples were tested
in triplicate, and demonstrated linearity for D-Dimer concentrations from
0.003 to 8.6 µg/mL FEU. The acceptance criteria allowable total error of
<10% was met.
A hook effect study was performed by testing dilutions of a high
concentration D-dimer stock solution to levels ranging from 0.48 µg/mL
to 30 µg/mL FEU. No hook effect was observed in the claimed linear
range.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Value assignment for calibrators and controls:
Diazyme D-Dimer calibrators are derived from human serum and
value assignment is based on the predicate assay Roche TINA QUANT
D-Dimer system.
Diazyme D-Dimer controls are traceable to in-house standards. The Diazyme
D-Dimer reagents and calibrators are used to determine the mean value of the
newly prepared controls. The expected range is calculated as ± 15% of the
mean value as determined by testing with one Roche Modular P instrument,
two lots of reagents and three vials from each level over two testing days.
Reagent stability
Reagent shelf stability
All stability testing was performed using the Roche Modular P
instrument. The reagent real time stability claim at 2-8°C is based on
ongoing real time stability data available for 3 lots of reagent, 9 months
at time of clearance. The sponsor also provided data from accelerated
stability studies on 2 lots of reagents tested at 37°C and 25°C. At specified
times, assay kits were evaluated by testing D-Dimer controls ranging from 1.1
µg/mL to 4.5 µg/mL FEU after calibration. Results demonstrated that the
reagents were stable for 14 days at 37°C and for 2 months at 25°C.

Acceptance Criteria of <15% control recovery change from Day 0 value were
met.
On-board reagent stability
On board reagent stability was performed by testing 3 levels of controls with
one lot of reagents. Results demonstrated on-board stability of at least 6 weeks
(Acceptance criteria ≤10% control recovery change from Day 0 value were
met).
Calibrator stability
Calibrator shelf stability
Real time stability data for storage of three calibrator lots at 2-8 °C available
at time of clearance supported calibrator shelf life of 9 months. In addition,
sponsor provided data from accelerated studies that tested two calibrator lots
stored at 37°C or 25°C. Results demonstrated that the lyophilized calibrators
were stable for 21 days at 37°C and for 3 months at 25°C by meeting the
acceptance criteria of < 10% calibrator recovery from Day 0
Reconstituted calibrator stability
Reconstituted calibrator stability demonstrated at least 21 days stability at 2-
8ºC. Acceptance criteria of < 10% calibrator recovery from Day 0 were met in
each of these studies.
Calibration curve stability
Three levels of controls from one lot were tested repeatedly after calibration at
day 0 over a period of 28 days. This calibration stability study demonstrated a
curve stability of 4 weeks (Acceptance criteria ≤10% control recovery change
from Day 0 value were met).
Control stability
Control shelf stability
Real time stability data for storage of three control lots at 2-8 °C available at
time of clearance supported calibrator shelf life of 9 months. Accelerated
study data on two control lots stored at 37°C and 25°C and tested in duplicate
at specified times demonstrated that two lots of controls are stable for 19 days
at 37ºC, and 3 months at 25ºC. Acceptance criteria of < 15% calibrator
recovery from day 0 were met in each of these studies.
Stability of reconstituted controls
Reconstituted control stability was determined by repeat testing of 2 control
lots for up to 28 days for storage at 2-8ºC. Acceptance criteria of < 15%
calibrator recovery from day 0 were met in each of these studies. Likewise,
these criteria were met for open-vial stability of up to 14 hours at room
temperature.
Sample stability
Two citrated plasma samples were tested daily after storage at 2-8ºC. The
7

--- Page 8 ---
acceptance criteria of <10% change from day 0 were met for storage up to 4
days. One freeze- thaw cycle between day 3 and 4 further indicated freeze-
thaw stability. Testing after 3 months of storage at -20ºC demonstrated
samples were stable and met the same acceptance criteria.
Sample freeze thaw stability
Freeze thaw stability was further demonstrated by testing 10 plasma samples
ranging from 0.32 to 5.01 µg/mL FEU that had been frozen at -20ºC for
three days. Results were compared to initial assessments of the fresh samples
prior to freezing. Samples are within the predetermine acceptance criteria of
10% or ± 0.1 µg/mL FEU for samples below 0.5 µg/mL FEU.
d. Detection limit:
LOB, LOD, and LOQ of the Diazyme D-Dimer Assay were determined
according to CLSI EP17- A: Protocols for Determination of Limits of
Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline, using 7.5%
Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) in saline as the true blank, and five citrated
plasma samples on the Roche Modular P. For LOB determination, the citrated
samples were diluted 1/100, and 12 replicates of each were assayed. Five
blank samples were tested in quadruplicate on each of three testing days for a
total of 60 observations and the LOB was determined to be 0.06 µg/mL FEU.
Similarily, 5 citrated plasma samples were diluted 100 fold with saline
containing 7.5% BSA. Each sample was tested in 12 replicates. The LOD
was determined to be 0.09 µg/mL FEU. Analysis of repeated testing of five
diluted citrate plasma samples ranging in concentration from 0.02 µg/mL
to 0.93 µg/mL FEU with 5 runs in 8 replicates per run by EP evaluator-8
fitted modeling calculated an LOQ of 0.15 µg/mL FEU.
e. Analytical specificity:
Testing was performed by evaluating the effects of increasing
concentrations of potential interfering substances on assay performance
by testing spiked two plasma samples of high and low D-dimer
concentration spiked with increasing concentrations of interferent in
triplicate. The interfering substances of triglyceride, ascorbic acid,
bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin, hemoglobin, rheumatoid factor, heparin,
and human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) showed no significant
interference (< ± 10%) up to the concentrations summarized below.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The performance of the Diazyme D-Dimer assay on the Roche Modular P
instrument was compared to the predicate device (Roche TinaQuant D-Dimer
Assay (k062203)). Testing was performed on citrated plasma samples from
the intended use population (patients in intensive care, trauma patients and
post-operative patients). While one of the sites have unique sample sets, sites
1 and 3 share most samples. A total of > 40 patient samples were tested with
both assays at each site. A total of 128 measurements were performed with
each instrument with 88 unique samples. Bootstrap analysis was performed to
negate the effects of repeat testing of samples. Results met the acceptance
criteria of slope = 1.0 ± 0.1; r2>0.90 and intercept ± 0.15.
