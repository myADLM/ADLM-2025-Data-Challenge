illumipro-10™ Automated Isothermal Amplification and Detection System
I. Device Description:
The iIlumigene® Molecular Diagnostic Test System is comprised of the
illumigene® Group B Streptococcus (GBS) DNA Amplification Test Kit, the
illumigene® Group B Streptococcus (GBS) External Control Kit and the
illumipro-10™ Automated Isothermal Amplification and Detection System. The
illumigene® Group B Streptococcus (GBS) DNA amplification assay utilizes
loop‐mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technology to detect the
presence of Streptococcus agalactiae in enriched cultures obtained from
vaginal/rectal swab specimens taken from antepartum women. Each illumigene®
GBS assay is completed using illumigene® Control Reagent, illumigene® Reaction
Buffer, an illumigene® GBS Test Device and an illumigene® Heat Treatment
Tube. Samples are diluted with the illumigene® control heat‐treatment in the
illumigene® Heat Treatment Tube and DNA amplification occurs in the
illumigene® GBS Test Device.
The illumipro-10™ heats each illumigene® GBS Test Device containing prepared
samples and Control Reagent, facilitating amplification of target DNA. When
S. agalactiae is present in the enriched culture sample, a conserved sequence of
the S. agalactiae is amplified and magnesium pyrophosphate is formed.
Magnesium pyrophosphate forms a precipitate in the reaction mixture. The
illumipro-10™ detects the change in light transmission through the reaction
mixture created by the precipitating magnesium pyrophosphate. Sample results
are reported as Positive or Negative based on the detected change in light
transmission.
The illumigene® Group B Streptococcus (GBS) External Control Kit consists of a
Positive Control Reagent and a Negative Control Reagent. External Control
reagents are provided to aid the user in detection of reagent deterioration, adverse
environmental or test conditions, or variance in operator performance that may
lead to test errors. The illumigene® Group B Streptococcus External Control Kit is
required for routine Quality Control.

L. Test Principle:
The illumigene® Group B Streptococcus (GBS) Assay is based on loop-mediated
isothermal amplification technology (LAMP). Loop-mediated amplification is
accomplished by the use of specially designed primers that provide specific and
continuous isothermal DNA amplification. Magnesium-pyrophosphate is produced
as a by-product of LAMP amplification. The magnesium-pyrophosphate forms a
white precipitate in the reaction solution, giving the reaction solution a turbid
appearance. The presence of turbidity signifies a positive reaction while the absence
of turbidity represents a negative reaction.

M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
For Meridian’s reproducibility studies, blind coded panels of 10 samples were
supplied to three independent laboratories. Samples were randomly sorted
within each panel to mask sample identities. The panels included contrived
samples manufactured near the assay limit of detection (i.e., low positive
samples), n = 3 and high negative samples, n = 3. The panels also included
contrived positive (n = 3) samples and natural negative samples (n = 1).
Testing was performed by different operators at each site on the same day
(intra‐assay variability) for five days (inter‐assay variability). Three lots of
illumigene GBS and five illumipro-10™ instruments were used in this study.
The results are given in the table below:
Site 1 Site 2 Site 3 Total
Sample Type Percent agreement Percent agreement Percent agreement Percent agreement
Negative 10/10 100% 10/10 100% 10/10 100% 30/30 100%
High Negative 30/30 100% 30/30 100% 30/30 100% 90/90 100%
Low Positive 30/30 100% 30/30 100% 30/30 100% 90/90 100%
Positive 30/30 100% 30/30 100% 30/30 100% 90/90 100%
Reproducibility studies are acceptable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable as this assay is qualitative
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
Stability:
Sample storage and hold time studies were performed to characterize
illumigene® Group B Streptococcus assay ranges. Validation studies
performed at Meridian indicated that Lim broth represented the worst-case
matrix; therefore all samples except two were prepared from enriched Lim
medium. The latter two samples (one high negative and one LoD positive
sample) were prepared from TransVag broth. Results demonstrated that
undiluted samples can be held at 19-270 C for up to 6 hours or at 2-80 C
for up to 7 days after culture enrichment and prior to testing. Samples
diluted with illumigene® Control Reagent can be held at room temperature

for up to 15 minutes prior to heat-treatment. Heat-treated samples can be
held at room temperature for up to 45 minutes prior to further processing.
Sample freeze/thaw studies were also performed. Samples were enriched
18-24 hours in enrichment broth and frozen prior to initiation of testing,
then exposed to multiple freeze/thaw cycles. Results demonstrated that
freeze/thaw of samples should not be done.
Final testing demonstrated that Lim Broth in combination with
Dacron/polyester, flocked nylon, and foam swab types perform acceptably
with the illumigene® GBS assay. The Amies Clear swab type has been
identified in the Limitations section of the Package Insert as an
incompatible swab type with the illumigene® GBS assay.
d. Detection limit:
Sensitivity studies were designed to determine the analytical limit of
detection of S. agalactiae diluted in Lim broth. Six common strains of
S. agalactiae, representing six different serotypes, were evaluated using
the illumigene® GBS assay. Each strain was spiked into negative Lim
broth and then diluted serially. A minimum of twenty replicates of each
dilution were individually processed and tested to establish LoD. Testing
was performed using three production lots of illumigene® GBS and six
illumipro-10™ instruments. External Positive and Negative Controls were
tested each day throughout the study.
The LoD of the assay ranged from 60 CFU/Test to 1280 CFU/Test. The
table below shows the lowest concentration for each serotype that
produced positive results for 95% of the replicates tested.

Additional S. agalactiae strains were tested and produced positive
reactions at 1280 CFU/test with illumigene® GBS. Strains and serotypes
were tested as follows: Serotype IV: NCTC 11930; Serotype VIa: NCTC
08188; Serotype VII: VII/2; Serotype VIII: VIII/2; Serotype X: NCTC
11249; Unknown Serotype: ATCC 13813 and ATCC12386.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference Testing:
Selected substances that might be expected to be present in vaginal/rectal
swab samples taken from antepartum women were added to a negative
Lim broth sample and two contrived positive Lim broth samples. The
negative sample was prepared by pooling confirmed negative Lim Broth
samples while the contrived positive samples were prepared by spiking a
pooled, confirmed negative Lim sample with either Streptococcus
agalactiae, strain 11248 Serotype Ia (123 CFU/test) or Streptococcus
agalactiae, strain 12401 Serotype Ib (80 CFU/test). Potentially interfering
substances were added to Lim broth samples at final concentrations of
2.5% v/v or greater when the substances could be pipetted. Substances that
could not be pipetted were coated onto cotton swabs, immersed in the
negative/positive Lim broth samples and tested. Dilution Controls were
prepared by adding a phosphate buffered saline solution in place of the
potentially cross‐reactive organisms. Each inoculated sample was tested in
triplicate.
Results demonstrated that the following substances, at the specified
saturated solvent/diluents concentrations, do not interfere with illumigene®
Group B Streptococcus test results: Amniotic fluid (10% v/v), Human
DNA (100 ng/Test), Urine (30%v/v), Whole Blood (2.5% v/v),
Meconium, Stool, Hemorrhoid cream (30.65 mg/100mg), Miconazole
(fungicide), Mucin (0.5‐1.5%), Spermicidal gel (nonoxynol 9)
(4mg/100mg). Lubricating gel produced False Negative Results in 1 of 11
replicates tested. Body Powder produced False Negative Results in 1 of 10
replicates tested. Whole Blood at concentrations greater than 2.5% v/v
interferes with the illumigene® GBS assay.
Interference studies are acceptable.
Cross-reactivity Study:
Microorganisms that could potentially cross-react, expected to be present
in vaginal/rectal swab specimens were added to negative and contrived
positive Lim Broth samples. The negative sample was prepared by pooling
confirmed negative Lim Broth samples. The contrived positive sample
was prepared by spiking a confirmed negative matrix with Streptococcus
agalactiae, strain 12401, at 122 CFU/test, near the limit of detection for
this strain. Potentially cross-reactive microorganisms were added at
concentrations of 1.2 x 108 CFU/mL (bacteria and fungi) and virus at a
minimum of 1 x 105 TCID /mL. Dilution controls for each sample were
50
prepared by adding sterile saline solution in place of the potentially cross-
reactive microorganisms. Each sample was tested in triplicate. Cross-
reactivity with Enterococcus dispar was observed in one of seven
replicates tested.

3. Clinical Studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Clinical trials for the illumigene® Group B Streptococcus (GBS) assay,
including the illumipro™-10 Automated Isothermal amplification and
detection system, were conducted. Performance characteristics of the
illumigene® GBS assay were determined by comparison to GBS bacterial
culture. Four independent clinical test sites located in the Midwestern and
Southern regions of the United States evaluated a total of 826 qualified patient
samples. Samples were obtained according to established guidelines for the
collection of clinical specimens for culture of Group B Streptococcus and
enriched for 18‐24 hours in either Lim Broth or TransVag Broth prior to
illumigene® testing. Four hundred and three (48.8%) specimens were enriched
with Lim Broth and 423 (51.2%) specimens were enriched with TransVag
Broth prior to testing. The age groups of patients tested ranged from 15 years
of age to 44 years of age, with age unknown for three (0.4%) of the patient
population. No differences in test performance were observed based on
enrichment medium or patient age. Overall assay Sensitivity is reported as
97.4% [95% CI: 91.9% ‐ 99.0%] where Specificity is 92.3% [95% CI: 90.0% ‐
94.1%].
