3. Special condition for use statement(s)
Prescription Use Only
4. Special instrument Requirements:
VITEK® 2 and the VITEK® 2 Compact Systems
I. Device Description:
Each VITEK® 2 test card contains 64 micro-wells. A control well which contains
only microbiological culture media is resident on all cards. The remaining wells
contain premeasured portions of a specific antibiotic combined with culture
media. The bacterial or yeast isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized
concentration with 0.45 – 0.5% saline before being used to rehydrate the
antimicrobial medium within the card. The VITEK 2 System automatically fills
seals and places the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a
manual filling, sealing and loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the
growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time. At the completion
of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along
with the interpretive category result for each antibiotic contained on the card.
The VITEK® 2 AST-ST Clindamycin has the following concentrations in the
card: 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 and 0.5/0.1 Clindamycin/Erythromycin µg/mL (equivalent
standard method concentration by efficacy in µg/mL). The test provides only a
clindamycin result; the clindamycin MIC result range for the VITEK® 2 card is
≤0.25 to ≥ 1μg/mL.

only microbiological culture media is resident on all cards. The remaining wells
contain premeasured portions of a specific antibiotic combined with culture media.

In addition to the automatic dilution, there is also a manual inoculation dilution
procedure described in the packager insert.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using 10 isolates at three sites on three
separate days in triplicates. Results were >95% reproducible by Category
Agreement only. Of the ten isolates tested, nine had off-scale results,
preventing an evaluation of reproducibility in MIC.
The study included the Auto-dilution and the Manual dilution with the
VITEK®2, and the Manual dilution with the VITEK®2 Compact.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
The recommended QC isolates were tested on every test occasion with the
reference method and the VITEK®2. The reference method QC results
were in range for every day tested. The VITEK®2 was tested a sufficient
number of times to demonstrate that the system can produce QC results in
the recommended range.
Quality Control was performed during the studies using both the auto-
dilution and the manual method of diluting the organisms. Results
demonstrated that methods were comparable with the same mode.
