L. Test Principle:
The LITH method employs a lithium-specific chromoionophore that forms a complex
with the Li+ ion in an alkaline solution.
Li+ + Lithium Dye à Dye-Li Complex (absorbs at 510 nm)
The concentration of lithium in the sample is proportional to the increase in
absorbance, which is due to the formation of the dye-lithium complex. The reaction is
measured using a bichromatic (510 and 700 nm) endpoint technique.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing for the LITH method was performed over twenty days
according to CLSI EP5-A2. Test samples consisted of two levels of a
commercially available control, two serum pools and one plasma (Na+
heparin) pool. The two serum pools and one plasma pool were spiked with
lithium carbonate. On each day of testing, each sample was run in duplicate,
in two separate runs. Testing was performed over 20 days, two separate runs

with two test samples for each test material. The studies included one Flex
lot, one instrument and one calibrator lot.
The range of samples spans the analytical measurement range. Analysis of
variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the data consistent with
recommendations of EP5-A2.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linear range was determined according to CLSI EP6-A. Based on the
results of this study and that from the Limit of Detection study, the analytical
measuring range was established. The LITH measuring range is 0.20 - 3.00
mmol/L.
The linearity study covered the range of 0.00 to 3.16 mmol/L for serum and
0.02 to 3.22 mmol/L for plasma (Na+ heparin). Linearity testing was
performed using human serum and plasma pools spiked with lithium
carbonate and then diluted for intermediate levels by sequential mixing with
drug-free serum and/or plasma. For each sample type, nine samples were
prepared by sequential mixing and analyzed in N=5 replicates.
The expected values listed in the tables below are based on dilutions of a
standard solution of known concentration.
The predicted values from the most statistically significant polynomial
regressions were compared to the predicted values from the linear regressions
and the bias was calculated for each level.

Recovery: A recovery study was also performed. Samples were each
independently volumetrically prepared using a highly concentrated lithium
stock solution, and expected values are calculated based upon the amount of
lithium carbonate added to each sample. In addition, a control is prepared for
each sample by spiking the diluent used to prepare the lithium carbonate
stock solution (in this case, water) into the sample matrix. Recovery is
determined relative to control for each sample.

Out of range specimens (with results in excess of 3.00 mmol/L) are to be
manually diluted. Autodilution is not recommended.
Samples with results less than 0.20 mmol/L will be reported as “less than 0.20
mmol/L” by the instrument.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The calibrator is traceable to NIST SRM1 924. It is a liquid
human serum base product containing lithium packaged as two vials for each
of five levels. Level A is drug free normal human serum and Levels B - E
contain lithium carbonate material in human serum.
Value assignment: The four levels of Lithium master pool are manufactured
by weighing in the appropriate amount of NIST SRM 924 Lithium reference
material into drug free normal human serum. (Level 1 does not contain
analyte and has a concentration of 0.0 mmol/L.) Each Masterpool level is
tested on Dimension for content verification against a previous masterpool
and current calibrator lot. The estimated uncertainties in the assigned values
of calibrator material range from 0.4 to 0.7%.
Commercial calibrator lots are produced by adding lithium gravimetrically to
drug free normal human serum. Values are assigned to each lot of calibrator
from the Lithium master pool using multiple instruments and reagent lots.

Stability: The calibrators are stable until the expiration date printed on the
vial when stored unopened and opened at 2-8 °C.
Real time stability studies are ongoing for unopened, opened and punctured
calibrators. The sponsor also evaluated three freeze-thaws. Stability testing
protocols were presented in the 510(k) and sponsor’s acceptance criteria were
reviewed and found to be acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor followed CLSI Guideline EP 17-A: Protocols for Determination
of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation to determine the Limit of
Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ).
Five lithium free samples (five independent lots of Calibrator Level A (zero
level)) and five low level samples (serum samples spiked with lithium
carbonate) were tested for three days, one run per day, two replicates per run,
with two reagent lots, on two instruments. Calibration of both instruments was
performed using the same lot of calibrator and all testing was performed by
the same operator.
The Limit of Blank (LoB) for LITH was determined to be 0.05 mmol/L and
the Limit of Detection (LoD) for LITH was determined to be 0.08 mmol/L.
In order to establish the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) four unique patient
samples were gravimetrically prepared to 0.15 mmol/L lithium using NIST
SRM 924a Lithium Carbonate. Two instruments were used and two lots of
reagents (a different reagent lot per instrument). Each of the four samples
were processed in triplicate during each run. Three runs were performed on
each instrument system (one run per day). A total of 72 measurements were
obtained. The mean observed sample concentration was 0.158 mmol/L, with
overall bias (relative to the concentration based on the standard) of 0.008
mmol/L. The %CV at 0.158 mmol/L was 8.5%, and a Total Analytical Error
(TAE) of 0.035 mmol/L was determined. Consistent with this, the sponsor has
set the lower limit of the claimed measuring range to be 0.20 mmol/L.
Samples with results less than 0.20 mmol/L will be reported as “less than 0.20
mmol/L” by the instrument.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed according to CLSI Guideline EP7-A2 to
determine the effect of various endogenous and exogenous substances on the
LITH assay. For all interferents the percent bias was determined by testing a
control sample without the interferent and comparing it to the value obtained
from a test sample to which the potential interferent had been added.
Test samples were prepared by spiking the potential interferent into serum
spiked with lithium carbonate. Testing was performed at LITH concentrations
8

--- Page 9 ---
of approximately 0.60 mmol/L and 1.50 mmol/L. The low level of 0.60
mmol/L was chosen based upon its medical relevance as the lower limit of the
therapeutic range. The upper level of 1.50 mmol/L was chosen based upon
CLSI Guideline EP7-A2.
Interference testing was performed with one lot of reagents. Five replicates
were tested for each substance.
Significant interference was defined as a bias of >0.10 mmol/L for the low
LITH sample and >10% bias for the high LITH sample relative to the control
sample.
Interference was evaluated at several levels of potential interferent for the
following compounds:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The predicate device used to demonstrate substantial equivalence to the
Dimension Vista LITH assay is the Dimension LI Assay for the Dimension
Clinical Chemistry System previously cleared under k011033. The method
comparison study included 104 excess, de-identified serum samples and 40
excess de-identified Na + Heparin plasma samples containing measurable
amounts of lithium within the analytical measurement range of the DV LITH
assay. Testing was performed over 9 days by two operators at one site. One
instrument and one lot of calibrators and reagents were used.
Passing Bablock Regression Statistics:
N = 144
Slope = 0.957 95% CI: 0.956, 0.957
Intercept = 0.04 mmol/L 95% CI: 0.04, 0.04
r = 0.997
Sy,x = 0.05 mmol/L
Range = 0.23 - 2.91 mmol/L
b. Matrix comparison:
Matched serum and Na+ heparin plasma samples were collected from patients
and donors and tested on the Dimension Vista System with the Dimension
Vista LITH assay. Both fresh and frozen samples were analyzed.
Spiked samples were prepared by adding aqueous lithium carbonate to freshly
drawn matched sets of serum and Na+ heparin plasma from healthy donors.
Sample spikes were made such that the lithium carbonate stock solution
contributed to no more than 2% of the final sample matrix.

LITH values were determined with the Dimension Vista LITH assay. Samples
were run in duplicate and the first replicate was used to compare LITH in
plasma versus serum by Passing-Bablock regression analysis.
Comparison of 55 matched undiluted serum and Na+ heparin plasma samples
on the Dimension Vista System gave the following statistics using Passing-
Bablock regression:
Slope: 1.01
Intercept: -0.02 mmol/L
N: 55
r: 0.997
Range: 0.32 - 2.93 mmol/L
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The therapeutic range of 0.60 - 1.20 mmol/L. is obtained from the literature (see
below).
The following is included in the package insert:
Therapeutic lithium concentrations vary significantly, depending on the
individual. A therapeutic range of 0.60 to 1.20 mmol/L includes effective
serum/plasma concentrations for many patients; however, some individuals are
best treated at concentrations outside this range.1,2,3
Concentrations of 1.20 to 1.50 mmol/L signify a warning range, and a
concentration in excess of 1.50 mmol/L in a specimen drawn 12 hours after the
dose indicates a significant risk of intoxication.1
Concentrations greater than 2.00 mmol/L are often associated with toxic
symptoms.1,2,3

Note: The physician must ultimately determine the most appropriate lithium
therapeutic range for each patient.
