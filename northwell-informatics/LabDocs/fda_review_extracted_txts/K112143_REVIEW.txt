T-Uptake Calibration/Verification Set is a quality control material intended for use in the
quantitative verification of calibration and reportable range of the Roche T-uptake Assay
when performed on the P-Modular Analyzer. When used for quality control purposes, it
is recommended that each laboratory establish its own means and acceptable ranges and
use the values provided only as guides. The Audit® MicroCV™ T-Uptake
Calibration/Verification is for In Vitro Diagnostic use only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription Use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Performance was established on P-Modular analyzer.
I. Device Description:
The Audit® MicroCV™ T-Uptake Calibration/Verification is a human and bovine albumin
based liquid set of QC Material. Each of the five levels contains T-Uptake analyte. It is
used to confirm the proper calibration, linear operating range, and reportable range of T-
Uptake. Level A is near the lower limit level and Level E has concentrations near the
upper limit of the P-Modular analyzer. Levels B, C, and D are prepared in a manner such
that an equal distance exists between each consecutive level.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
All components of the Audit® MicroCV™ T-Uptake Calibration/Verification Set are
obtained from a commercial vendor and inspected in-house.
Stability
Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable. Stability characteristics of the Audit® MicroCV™ T-Uptake
Calibration/Verification Set were determined using an accelerated study to predict closed
vial shelf life for each level. A closed vial shelf life of 24 months is expected at the
recommended storage temperature (2 to 8°C). Real- time closed vial stability is ongoing.
Real-time opened vial stability studies were also performed. The sponsor states the open
vial stability is 10 days if stored tightly capped at 2 to 8 °C. Storage recommendations are
provided in the labeling.
