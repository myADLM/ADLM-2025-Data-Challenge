L. Test Principle:
The test format for the AQT90 FLEX is an immunoassay based on time-resolved
fluorescence using an europium (Eu) chelate as the fluorescent label. The test receptacles
(300 mL test cups) for each assay contain the biotinylated antibodies used for the capture of
the analyte, a separating layer of glucosides, and the europium-chelate labeled antibodies
used to trace the captured proteins. The sample or diluted sample is added to the test cup
together with assay buffer. The cup is then incubated to allow formation of the immuno-
complex and washed to remove unbound antibodies and sample materials. Finally, the cup is
exposed to excitation light and after a delay, the emitted light is measured by single photon
counting; this measurement cycle is repeated up to 3,300 times. The total count (the
response) is then compared to a calibration curve to obtain a quantitative measurement of the
analyte's concentration in the sample.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the AQT90 Flex Myo Test on the AQT90 FLEX analyzer was
evaluated using whole blood and plasma samples at three point of care settings (POC)
based upon the CLSI EP5-A2 guideline. Fresh native or antigen spiked lithium-
heparin whole blood samples were tested in five replicates in five separate runs
within three hours at three POC sites (one instrument, one test kit lot per site). Five
levels of frozen native or antigen spiked lithium-heparin plasma were tested in
duplicate in two separate runs for twenty days at three POC sites (one instrument,
three test kit lots per site). The results are summarized in the following tables.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the AQT90 FLEX Myo Test was evaluated on the AQT90 FLEX
analyzer by diluting two spiked plasma and whole blood samples with various levels
of diluent to obtain twelve levels for each matrix. The plasma samples had values
ranging from 0.04 to 1108 ng/mL while the blood samples ranged from 0.14 to 1766
ng/mL. The linear regression correlation is y= 0.98x – 4.21 for plasma samples and
y= 1.00 + 0.36 for whole blood samples. The data provided support the sponsor’s
claims that the reportable range of this assay is 20 to 900 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and Value Assignment
The antigen material, M0725 by Scripps, has been used to establish the metrological
traceability chain of the AQT90 FLEX Myo assay because there is no international
conventional calibrator for myoglobin. The nominal concentration of the reference
material at each concentration level has been defined by weighing the fraction of the
reference material and the buffer solution.
This material has been used to assign values for the manufacturer's working calibrator
with the manufacturer's selected measurement procedure. In summary, the reference
material (eight concentration points) and the calibrator material (eight concentration
points) have been measured with two instruments, two reagent batches, over three
days and with four replicate measurements. Altogether this yields a total of 48
individual results produced by a known amount of specific protein from all reference
and calibrator points.
The success of the value assignment and commutability of the two materials have
been estimated by measuring patient samples against the standard curves of these two
materials. The regression of averages of these concentrations was evaluated. The
slope was not statistically significantly different from the expected value of 1, and the
calculated intercept was not statistically different from the expected value of 0. This
confirms the commutability of the materials.
The traceability chain from the manufacturer's working calibrator to the product
calibrator is performed for all AQT90 FLEX Myo batches using three instruments,
two runs and five replicate measurements. The value assignment from the working
calibrator to the product calibrator and generation of the factory standard curve are
done with total of 30 individual results of the manufacturer's working calibrator.
Control material was purchased from commercial available sources. The value
assignment for each Multi-CHECK level includes two AQT90 FLEX Myo Test
reagent lots, three AQT90 FLEX analyzers, two test days and five measurement
replicates per control level for a total of 60 measurements per control level.

Stability
AQT90 FLEX Myo Test and Calibration Cartridges: The shelf life stability studies
were performed on three product lots of test and calibration cartridges. The product
was kept at 2 -8 °C and tested at different time points during ten months on the
AQT90 FLEX analyzer. On-board stability was studied with three product lots of test
and calibration cartridges stored at 2 -8 °C, placed at 32oC and tested at indicated time
points (zero, six and eight months) on the AQT90 FLEX analyzer. Based on the
results, the sponsor claims that test and calibration cartridges are claimed to have a
shelf stability of 8 months at 2 to 8 oC, while the on-board stability is 16 days at 32 oC
for the test cartridge and 48 hours at 32 oC for the calibration cartridge.
AQT90 FLEX LQC Multi-Check: Shelf life stability studies were performed on three
lots. The product was kept at -18 to -26 °C, placed at 2 to 8 °C and tested at different
time points up to fifteen months on the AQT90 FLEX analyzer. On-board stability
was studied with three product lots placed at either 8 °C or 32 oC and tested at
different time points up to fifteen hours on the AQT90 FLEX analyzer. Based on the
results, the sponsor claims a shelf stability of 12 months at -18 to -26 °C, while the
on-board stability is 4 days unopened at 2 to 8 oC or 2 hours opened at room
temperature.
AQT90 FLEX Reagent Pack: Shelf life stability studies were performed on three
product lots. The product was kept at 32 °C and tested at different time points up to
fifteen months on the AQT90 FLEX analyzer. On-board stability was studied with
one product lot placed at 32 to 40 oC and tested at different time points on the AQT90
FLEX analyzer. Based on the results, the sponsor claims a shelf stability of 5 months
at 2 to 32 °C, while the on-board stability is 25 days at room temperature.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) determination was based on 64 replicate measurements of
AQT Assay Buffer on a single AQT90 FLEX instrument according to CLSI EP 17-A.
The Limit of Blank as determined by the upper 95th percentile is 0.037 ng/mL. The
Limit of Blank claim in the package insert is 0.5 ng/mL.
Limit of Detection (LoD) determination was based on 20 replicate measurements of
four low samples on an AQT90 FLEX instrument. The LoD determination was
calculated by using the determined LoB value and pooled SD values from LoD
samples. The Limit of Detection was determined to be 0.2 ng/mL for BSA-buffer
supplemented with red blood cells. The Limit of Detection claim in the package insert
is 1.0 ng/mL.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) determination was based on 30 replicate measurements
of four low samples on two AQT90 FLEX instruments. The Limit of Quantitation
was determined to be 0.6 ng/mL for BSA-buffer supplemented with red blood cells.
The Limit of Quantitation claim in the package insert is 1.0 ng/mL.
The AQT90 FLEX Myo Test has a reportable range of 20-900 ng/mL.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were designed according to the CLSI EP7-A guideline. Two
levels of human plasma (100 and 500 ng/mL) were spiked with known interference
substances (51 drugs, 3 solvents and 13 endogenous compounds) and samples were
analyzed in five replicates on the AQT90 FLEX analyzer. No significant interference,
defined as recovery within ± 10% compared to reference without any interfering
substance, was observed with the assay. Specifically, no interference was observed
with unconjugated Bilirubin up to 270 mg/L (27.0 mg/dL), conjugated Bilirubin up to
270 mg/L (27.0 mg/dL), Hemoglobin up to 10 g/L (1000 mg/dL) and triglycerides up
to 15 g/L (1500 mg/dL).
The potential interference of thirteen endogenous compounds was evaluated in whole
blood samples. Similar to the results observed with plasma samples, no interference
was observed with unconjugated Bilirubin up to 270 mg/L (27.0 mg/dL),conjugated
Bilirubin up to 270 mg/L (27.0 mg/dL), Hemoglobin up to 10 g/L (1000 mg/dL), and
triglycerides up to 15 g/L (1500 mg/dL).
No hook effect was observed for plasma samples up to 1,950 ng/mL and up to 6,500
ng/mL with whole blood samples, which are outside of the reportable range of 20 to
900 ng/mL.
Potential positive interference from human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) and
Rheumatoid factor (RF) was evaluated (five replicate measurements) using seventeen
human plasma samples containing HAMA and/or RF. The sponsor claims no positive
interference from human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) and Rheumatoid factor (RF).
Possible negative interference from HAMA and RF was evaluated by comparing the
results of seventeen human HAMA and/or RF plasma samples spiked with myoglobin
to reference sample (HAMA/RF negative) containing the same amount of myoglobin.
No negative interference for the assay was observed, which was defined as recovery
within ± 10% of human HAMA/RF positive samples compared to a reference sample
(HAMA/RF negative). The sponsor claims no negative interference from human anti-
mouse antibody (HAMA) and Rheumatoid factor (RF).

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Paired human whole blood and lithium-heparin plasma samples were collected at four
hospitals and measurements were obtained using the AQT90 FLEX Myo Test run on
the AQT90 FLEX analyzer. Frozen plasma samples were sent to a central laboratory
and comparative measurements were obtained on the predicate device (ARCHITECT
STAT Myoglobin Immunoassay on the ARCHITECT I System). For lithium plasma,
165 samples (including nine spiked samples) were evaluated and the total range of
10

--- Page 11 ---
samples tested was 22 to 882 ng/ml. For whole blood, 157 samples (no spiked
samples), with a sample range of 24 to 856 ng/ml, were evaluated. The data was
evaluated by the Passing-Bablok linear regression analysis and the results were as
follows.
Plasma samples: y = 1.02x + 13, r2 = 0.99, n = 165
Whole blood samples: y = 1.07x + 15, r2 = 0.99, n = 157
b. Matrix comparison:
In order to demonstrate equivalence of myoglobin results between different
anticoagulant combinations, sixty four individual and five spiked samples spanning
the measuring range (24 to 889 ng/mL) were evaluated. Four matrix anticoagulant
combinations were evaluated in the study, which were Lithium-Heparin whole blood,
Lithium-Heparin plasma, EDTA whole blood and EDTA plasma. The results of
plasma versus whole blood were analyzed by Passing-Bablock regression. Results are
summarized below:
Li-Hep Plasma vs. Li-Hep WB: y = 0.99x – 1.0, r2 = 1.00, n = 69
EDTA Plasma vs. EDTA WB: y = 1.00x – 0.5, r2 = 1.00, n = 69
EDTA WB vs. Li-Hep Plasma: y = 1.02x – 0.9, r2 = 1.00, n = 64
EDTA Plasma vs. Li-Hep Plasma: y = 1.01x + 0.3, r2 = 1.00, n = 64
