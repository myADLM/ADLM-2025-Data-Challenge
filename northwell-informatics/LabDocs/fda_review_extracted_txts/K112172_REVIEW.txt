H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Quidel® Molecular Influenza A + B Assay is a multiplex Real Time RT-PCR
assay for the in vitro qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A and
influenza B viral RNA in nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs from patients with
signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. The test is intended for use as an aid
in the differential diagnosis of influenza A and influenza B viral infections in
humans in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors. The assay
does not detect the presence of influenza C virus.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used
as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other patient management decisions.
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2010-
2011 influenza season when influenza A/H3 and 2009 H1N1 influenza were the
predominant influenza A viruses in circulation. When other influenza A viruses
are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical
and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities,
specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for
novel virulent Influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for
testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+
facility is available to receive and culture specimens.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

4. Special instrument requirements:
bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG System (software version 2.0)
Applied Biosystems (ABI) 7500 FAST Dx (software version 1.4)
I. Device Description:
The assay detects influenza A and influenza B viral RNA that has been extracted
from a patient sample using the NucliSENS® easyMAG® automated extraction
platform. A multiplex RT-PCR reaction is carried out under optimized conditions in a
single tube generating amplicons for each of the target viruses present in the sample.
This reaction is performed utilizing the Applied Biosystems® 7500 Fast Dx platform.
Identification of influenza A occurs by the use of target specific primers and a
fluorescent- labeled probe that hybridizes to a conserved region within the matrix
protein gene. Identification of influenza B occurs by the use of target specific
primers and a fluorescent-labeled probe that hybridizes to a conserved influenza B
sequence within the neuraminidase gene.

The following is a summary of the procedure:
1. Sample Collection: Obtain nasal swabs or nasopharyngeal swabs using standard
techniques from symptomatic patients. These specimens are transported, stored,
and processed according to established laboratory procedures.
2. Nucleic Acid Extraction: Extract viral RNA from the specimens with the
NucliSENS easyMAG System following the manufacturer’s instructions and
using the appropriate reagents. Prior to the extraction procedure add 20 µL of the
Process Control (PRC) to each 180 µL aliquot of specimen. The PRC serves to
monitor inhibitors in the extracted specimen, assures that adequate amplification
has taken place and confirms that the nucleic acid extraction was sufficient.
3. Rehydration of Master Mix: Rehydrate the lyophilized Master Mix using the
Rehydration Solution. The Master Mix contains oligonucleotide primers,
fluorophore and quencher-labeled probes targeting highly conserved regions of
the influenza A and influenza B viruses as well as the PRC sequence. The primers
are complementary to highly specific and conserved regions in the genome of
these viruses. The probes are dual labeled with a reporter dye attached to the 5’
end and a quencher attached to the 3’ end.

--- Page 4 ---
4. Nucleic Acid Amplification and Detection: Add 15 µL of the rehydrated Master
Mix to each plate well. 5µL of extracted nucleic acids (specimen with PRC) is
then added to the plate well. Place the plate into the ABI 7500 Fast Dx
instrument. Once the plate is added to the instrument, the assay protocol is
initiated. This protocol initiates reverse transcription of the RNA targets
generating complementary DNA, and the subsequent amplification of the target
sequences occurs. The Quidel Molecular Influenza A+B assay is based on
TaqMan® chemistry, and uses an enzyme with reverse transcriptase, DNA
polymerase, and 5’-3’ exonuclease activities. During DNA amplification, this
enzyme cleaves the probe bound to the complementary DNA sequence, separating
the quencher dye from the reporter dye. This step generates an increase in
fluorescent signal upon excitation by a light source of the appropriate wavelength.
With each cycle, additional dye molecules are separated from their quenchers
resulting in additional signal. If sufficient fluorescence is achieved by 35 cycles
during the data collection stage of amplification, the sample is reported as positive
for the detected target sequence.

L. Test Principle:
The real-time RT-PCR process simultaneously amplifies and detects nucleic acid
targets in a single closed-tube reaction. Detection of influenza A, B and the Process
Control (PRC) is based on three processes: nucleic acid isolation, reverse
transcription and real time PCR amplification/detection. Human respiratory
specimens (nasal swabs and nasopharyngeal swabs) from symptomatic patients are
processed initially to isolate and purify viral nucleic acid from the cellular specimen
matrix. After initial reverse transcription of RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA),
amplification proceeds during which the probe anneals specifically to a region of the
template between the forward and reverse primers. As primer extension and
amplification occurs, the exonuclease activity of the Taq polymerase cleaves the
probe separating the reporter dye away from the quencher. This generates an increase
in fluorescent signal upon excitation from a light source of appropriate wavelength.
With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved from their respective
probes, yielding increased fluorescence signal. The amount of fluorescence at any
given cycle is dependent on the amount of PCR product (amplicons) present at that
time. Fluorescent intensity is monitored at each PCR cycle by fluorescent detection
modules within the real-time instrument.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the Quidel Molecular Influenza A and B assay was
evaluated at three laboratory sites. The reproducibility panel and controls were
tested at each site by two operators for five days in triplicate (2 operators x 5
days x triplicate testing x 3 sites = 90 results per sample). The panels and
controls were extracted using the bioMérieux easyMAG system and tested on
the ABI 7500 Fast Dx.
The reproducibility panel was composed of four simulated samples each for
influenza A and influenza B, made by diluting Influenza A H1N1
A/Mexico/4108/2009 or Influenza B Florida into negative nasal matrix. The
panel included a medium positive (5x LoD) influenza A sample, a low
positive (2x LoD) influenza A sample, a high negative (0.3x LoD) influenza A
sample, and an influenza A negative sample. The panel also included a
medium positive (5x LoD) influenza B sample, a low positive (2x LoD)
influenza B sample, a high negative (0.3x LoD) influenza B sample, and an
influenza B negative sample.

Freeze-Thaw Equivalency
The impact of using fresh clinical samples versus frozen clinical specimens on
the Quidel Molecular Influenza A+B Assay’s ability to detect influenza A and
influenza B was evaluated. Briefly, 220 clinical specimens were aliquoted
and processed fresh (< 72-hours post collection) and frozen (a minimum of 7-
days storage at -70°C). Six (6) samples were discarded from analysis due to
invalid results. The invalid rate of the fresh samples was 4/220 (1.8%) and the
invalid rate of the frozen samples was 6/220 (2.7%). Four of the invalids
overlapped between fresh and frozen. There were two influenza A and
influenza B positive samples that did not overlap between fresh and frozen in
the comparison study. The positive samples evaluated in the study spanned
virus concentrations detected from 6 Ct to 35 Ct for influenza A and 8 Ct to

Kit Stability
An evaluation of real-time stability using 3 lots of the Quidel Molecular
Influenza A+B Assay kits at 2°C - 8°C and room temperature was done over
the course of 61 days, with additional real time results to be collected for 460
days (15 months). The following information summarizes the acceptance
criteria; furthermore these criteria will also be used throughout the stability
study:
1. Quidel Molecular Influenza A+B Assay kit stability demonstrates 20
months real time stability at 2°C to 8°C.
2. Quidel Molecular Influenza A+B Assay kit stability demonstrates 15
months equivalent accelerated stability at 2°C to 8°C.
3. Quidel Molecular Influenza A+B Assay kit stability demonstrates 15
months real time stability at room temperature. (RT)
4. Influenza A and influenza B test positive at each time point tested, 3x,
100x and 1000x LoD (≥ 5 cycles and <35 cycles for 7500 Dx).
5. The NTCs test negative at each time point tested (undetermined).
No significant failure of the assay was detected at any of the experimental
conditions to date (real time stability data collected to day 61) when compared

Master Mix Stability after Rehydration
An evaluation of master mix stability after rehydration was carried out over a
5 day period using various storage conditions, including -20°C, 4°C, and 25°C
(room temperature). Mock specimens at 100X, 10X, and 3X LoD were used
in the analysis. Results show that the rehydrated master mix can be stored for
up to 24-hours at room temperature without any significant affect on the Ct
values for influenza A, influenza B or the PRC. The data demonstrates that
for times longer than 24-hours the rehydrated master mix can be stored at -
20°C for up to two weeks. Storage of the rehydrated master mix at -4°C is not
recommended.
Extracted Specimen Stability
An evaluation of the stability of extracted specimens was carried out using the
easyMAG extraction system followed by real-time RT-PCR analysis. Parallel
aliquots of samples that were influenza A (3X LoD) and influenza B (3X
LoD) positive were used for this study. Samples were analyzed at time 0
(immediately after extraction), after 2h at room temperature, after 8h at 2-8°C,
after 96 hours with up to three freeze thaw cycles, and after 1 month at -20°C.
There was no indication of degradation of the extracted specimen stored at the
conditions tested.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity (limit of detection or LoD) of the Quidel Molecular
Influenza A+B assay was determined using quantified (TCID /mL) cultures
50
of three influenza A strains (one H1N1, one 2009H1N1 and one H3N2) and
three influenza B strains, serially diluted in negative nasopharyngeal matrix.
Each dilution was extracted using the NucliSENS easyMAG System in
replicates of 21 per concentration of virus and tested on the Applied
Biosystems® 7500 Fast Dx platform. Analytical sensitivity (LoD) is defined
as the lowest concentration at which 95% of all replicates tested positive.

e. Analytical specificity (inclusivity):
The inclusivity of the Quidel Molecular Influenza A+B assay was evaluated
against multiple strains of influenza A and influenza B viruses. The clinical
panel consisted of 10 influenza A subtype H1N1, two influenza A subtype
2009H1N1, eight influenza A subtype H3N2, two influenza A subtype H5N1,
13 Influenza B strains. An additional panel of non-clinical influenza isolates
was also tested. Each panel member was extracted using the NucliSENS
easyMAG instrument and tested in triplicate.
The Quidel Molecular Influenza A+B assay detected 100% of the influenza A
(38/38) and influenza B strains (15/15) at 2 to 3x LoD levels including
pandemic and avian influenza A strains, and recent circulating influenza B
strains.

g. Interfering Microorganisms
The role of potentially interfering organisms in the ability of the Quidel
Molecular Influenza A+B assay to detect and differentiate influenza A and
influenza B viral RNA was evaluated by testing a panel consisting of 26 viral,
24 bacterial, and one yeast strain representing common respiratory pathogens
or flora commonly present in the nasopharynx (see Cross-Reactivity table for
complete list of organisms). Each organism was evaluated individually in a
specimen containing influenza A (106 TCID /mL) and influenza B (107
50
TCID /mL). Bacteria and yeast were tested at concentrations of 105 to 108
50
CFU/mL. Viruses were tested at concentrations of 102 to 108 TCID /mL.

Samples were extracted using the NucliSENS easyMAG instrument and tested
in triplicate. No interference was observed during this study.
h. Interfering Substances
The performance of Quidel Molecular Influenza A+B assay was evaluated
with potentially interfering substances that may be present in nasopharyngeal
specimens. The potentially interfering substances were evaluated in influenza
A (A/Mexico/4108/2009), and influenza B (B/Florida/04/2006) at
concentrations of 3x and 10x LoD. There was no evidence of interference
caused by the substances tested below with 3x or 10x LoD viruses.

fluorescent intensity above the background or baseline of a “negative”
reaction. If a sample exceeds the threshold in a detection channel during PCR,
the sample is considered positive for that channel. If the sample does not
exceed the threshold for a detection channel by the last PCR cycle, the sample
is considered negative for that channel.
The cut-off for the Quidel Molecular Influenza A+B Assay was determined
and confirmed through a phased approach. The preliminary threshold was
established using data obtained from the LoD studies and from the analysis of
a set of clinical specimens. Data from the analysis of multiple replicates near
the LoD of the assay were used to establish the threshold such that sensitivity
was maximized. Similarly, the latest Ct value from the LoD data was used to
set the cut-off. Using the parameters summarized in the table below, a
verification study was done to confirm the threshold and cut-off values.

*These values reflect subtraction of the first 10 cycles. Fluorescence is
monitored after the first 10 cycles during the data collection stage
of amplification.
• Results from an LoD study used to verify the threshold and cut-off values
are as follows:
o Influenza A – 119/120 (99.1%)
o Influenza B – 119/120 (99.1%)
These results demonstrated that the preliminary threshold and Ct cut-off
settings determined have been confirmed and effective for maximizing
sensitivity of the Quidel Molecular Influenza A+B Molecular Assay.
j. Carry-over Contamination Analysis
An evaluation of potential carry–over contamination during extraction and/or
amplification was carried out. High negative and positive samples were run in
alternating series to evaluate performance of the device and to monitor for
potential carry-over contamination. The evaluation included alternating
extractions high and low concentration of virus on the indicated platform.
During the amplification stage the plate was setup in a checkerboard approach
locating negative and positive samples in adjoining wells. No cross
contamination was observed in the evaluation of the Quidel Molecular
Influenza A+B Assay.

k. Comparison of transport media
Analytical performance of the Quidel Molecular Influenza A+B Assay was
evaluated with six different transport media. Stocks of influenza A and
influenza B were used to evaluate performance across the different transport
media at a level close to the LoD (3X). Briefly, dilutions of influenza A and
influenza B were made and each of the dilutions was extracted in triplicate.
Each extraction was then tested in duplicate on the ABI 7500 Fast Dx using
the Quidel Molecular Influenza A+B Assay standard protocol. No differences
between the tested transport media were observed and the results are
summarized below.

influenza A and influenza B viral RNA. Four of these specimens were invalid
on initial testing with the subject device (0.6%). Re-testing of the specimens
according to the Interpretation algorithm described above also yielded invalid
results. Seventeen (17) specimens were invalid on initial and repeat testing
(as per the device's PI) on the comparator device (2.5%). Three specimens
were invalid in both devices, therefore, a total of 18 invalid specimens were
removed from additional analysis. The tables below detail the results for the

b. Retrospective Clinical Studies:
Performance characteristics of the Quidel Molecular Influenza A+B assay
were also evaluated during a retrospective study of frozen specimens collected
during the 2010-2011 respiratory virus season (January to March of 2011).
Samples used for this study were frozen nasopharyngeal (376) swab
specimens that were collected for routine influenza testing.
For this study the comparator method was a high performance FDA-Cleared
Influenza A and B molecular device.
Three hundred and seventy six (376) frozen nasopharyngeal swabs were tested
by the subject and comparator devices for influenza A and influenza B viral
RNA. Two of these specimens were invalid on initial testing with the subject
device (0.5%). Re-testing of the specimens according to the Interpretation
algorithm described above also yielded invalid results. Two specimens were
invalid on initial and repeat testing (as per the device's PI) on the comparator
device (0.5%). The four invalid specimens were removed from performance
analyses. The tables below detail the results for the remaining 372 specimens.
