Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infections and should not be used as the
sole basis for treatment or other management decisions. The test is intended for
professional and laboratory use.
Performance characteristics for influenza A and B were established during February
through March 2011 when influenza viruses A/California/7/2009 (2009 H1N1),
A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2), and B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria-Like) were the predominant
influenza viruses in circulation according to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report
from the CDC entitled “Update: Influenza Activity--United States, 2010-2011 Season,
and Composition of the 2011-2012 Influenza Vaccine”. Performance characteristics may
vary against other emerging influenza viruses.
If infection with a novel influenza virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent
influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Virus culture
should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and
culture specimens.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as intended use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
To be used only with the Sofia Analyzer
I. Device Description:
The Sofia Influenza A+B FIA employs immunofluorescence technology that is used with the
Sofia Analyzer to detect influenza virus nucleoproteins.
The Sofia Influenza A+B FIA is a lateral-flow immunoassay that uses monoclonal antibodies
that are specific for influenza antigens and have no known cross-reactivity to normal flora or
other known respiratory pathogens.
Nasal swab, nasopharyngeal swab, and nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash specimens are used for
this test. The patient specimen is placed in the Reagent Tube, during which time the virus
particles in the specimen are disrupted, exposing internal viral nucleoproteins. After
disruption, the specimen is dispensed into the cassette sample well. From the sample well,
the specimen migrates through a test strip containing various unique chemical environments.
If influenza viral antigen is present, they will be trapped in a specific location.

The Sofia Analyzer will scan the test strip and measure the fluorescent signal by processing
the results using method-specific algorithms. The Sofia Analyzer will display the test results
(Positive, Negative, or Invalid) on the screen.

L. Test Principle:
The Sofia Influenza A+B FIA is an immunoassay that uses a sandwich design to detect and
differentiate Influenza A and Influenza B in patient specimens. This test uses a lateral flow
design with location-dependent lines and zones. The Sofia Analyzer scans the test strip and
displays the results (Positive, Negative or Invalid) after utilizing the method-specific
algorithms. Basically Sofia Influenza A+B FIA involves the disruption of Influenza A and B
viral antigens and exposure of internal nucleoproteins by placing the patient specimen in the
reagent tube. After disruption the specimen is dispended into the Cassette sample well after
which the sample is drawn by capillary action into and through the label pad, through the
nitrocellulose strip and into the adsorbent pad. Within the label pad, the specimen comes into
contact with antibodies that have been coupled to the europium chelate-impregnated
microbeads. During this interaction, the independent subpopulations of beads containing
bound anti-influenza A or anti-influenza B monoclonal antibodies bind corresponding
influenza A or B nucleoprotein antigens that are present in the specimen. The bead-coupled
antigen-antibody complexes then begin to flow through the test strip. Some of these beads
bind non-specifically to the NC line. Most migrate on and, if influenza A or B antigen are
present in the sample, they will be subsequently captured on the surface of the nitrocellulose
by the respective location-fixed, analyte-specific anti-influenza A or anti-influenza B capture
antibodies. The flow and capture of the fluorescent microbeads coated with influenza A
and/or B nucleoprotein antigens allows the accumulation of a fluorescent signal at specific
analyte line locations on the test strip. The conjugates that do not bind to the Negative
Control line and Test Lines continue to flow with the remaining specimen and soon
encounter the Reference line that is comprised of goat anti-mouse Ig. The fluorescent signal
generated at this line serves as the location marker to direct the Sofia Analyzer to the other
precise locations on the Nitrocellulose that are to be scanned. The remaining sample then
flows into the Procedural Control Zone that is also scanned to confirm that adequate flow of
the sample has occurred. The Sample with any remaining conjugate then flows on into the
Adsorbent Pad. This process takes approximately fifteen minutes, at which time the Sofia
Analyzer scans the strip, measuring the fluorescent signals across the strip’s length and
performs calculations and reports the test results. The assay’s sensitivity is derived from the
use of a unique polystyrene microbead that has been dyed with a chelate of europium that is
temperature stable, resistant to bleaching in room light and yields a very efficient conversion
of the UV energy from 365 nm to a wavelength of 618 nm.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision:
The precision study spanned a period of at least 12 days, using two operators per day.
It included the use of three different lots of the Sofia Influenza A+B FIA test cassettes
and one Sofia Analyzer. One strain each of Influenza A and Influenza B virus was
used. Viruses were spiked into the negative clinical matrix pool derived from
negative clinical nasal swab samples in VTM to prepare High negative, Low positive
(at or near the LoD) and Moderate positive (3.5 times the LoD) members of the
precision study panel. Each operator tested two aliquots of each precision study panel
member on each of the three lots of the test cassettes. A total of 1,008 observations (3
lots of cassettes x 2 operators x 2 aliquots/test runs x 12 days x 7 precision panel
members = 1008) were included in the analysis. The three different cassette lots
agreed with one another 100% of the time for the true negative (no spiked virus;
clinical negative matrix only), type A moderate positive, type A low positive, type B
moderate positive and type B low positive precision panel members. The high
negative samples (C ) for type A and type B gave 90% and 92% agreement,
5
respectively. The overall agreement between the three different lots of test cassettes
was 97% (981/1008).

Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the Sofia Influenza A+B FIA was evaluated at three different
laboratories. Two different operators at each site tested a series of coded, contrived
samples, prepared in negative nasal swab matrix, ranging from high negative to
moderate positive influenza A and influenza B using formalin inactivated virus. The
influenza strains used were Influenza A/California/07/2009 (2009 H1N1) and
Influenza B/Allen/45. Testing occurred on five different days spanning over
approximately a two-week period using six Sofia Analyzers. A total of 210 results
(105 samples x 2 operators = 210 samples) per site were obtained. A total of 630
samples were tested by the combined three sites. The inter-laboratory agreement for
negative samples (negative and high negative samples) was 94-100% and 98-100%

g. Assay cut-off:
The Sofia Analyzer uses a constant set of calculations to generate processed peak
heights. The peak heights are used by the test method file to calculate a final test
result.
11

--- Page 12 ---
Sofia Analyzer Data Processing Work Flow
The last column of the Sofia Analyzer data processing workflow describes a series of
step undertaken by the software to calculate the cutoffs (COs) and the signal over CO
ratio (S/CO) immediately prior to reporting the result. Values from reference lots
during development were used to establish the reference values used in these
algorithms. Three cutoffs are generated for each analyte in each test and the
algorithm then selects automatically the cutoff with the highest value for each
analyte. This particular cutoff is the one ultimately used to calculate the test results
for each analyte.
Cutoff Determination Type 1
Adjusts for the impact of the most strongly fluorescing Test Line on the adjacent Test
Line.
The analysis of known positive and negative specimens during development led to a
preliminary cutoff for both analytes. Additional analyses, similar to those described
in CLSI EP17-A for determining the Limit of Blank (LoB), further established that
the cutoff at 675 RFUs for influenza A and B was appropriate. These studies further
demonstrated that the most strongly fluorescing signal on one Test Line would
influence the signal on the adjacent Test Line. To adjust for this effect, the signal of
the Test Line giving the highest signal is multiplied by 0.2 and the resulting product
added to 675. This larger value becomes the cutoff for the analyte with the lower
signal. This process compensates for the impact of the signal from the Test Line with
the highest signal on the adjacent Test Line.
12

--- Page 13 ---
Cutoff Determination Type 2
Calculating cutoff when the NC value is less than the NC Threshold value.
For each test, if the NC signal is less than the NC Threshold value, then the fixed
cutoff of 675 will be used.
Cutoff Determination Type 3
Calculating cutoff when the NC value is greater that the NC Threshold value.
When the NC value of any test is greater than the NC Threshold value, then the test’s
NC value multiplied by the analyte-specific correction factor (CF) yields the cutoff
for each analyte in that test.
The method algorithm requires the calculation of the preliminary cutoffs described
above. It then selects the cutoff with the highest RFU signal to complete the
calculations of test results. These calculations and the ultimate cutoff employed are
not visible to the user of the FIA test and Sofia Analyzer.
h. Interfering Substances:
Whole blood, mucin, heparin and 16 substances, many of which are common cold
and flu medications were examined in this study. Two strains of Influenza A and B
each were diluted in viral transport medium M5 to TCID /mL titers approximately
50
three times the LoD for each virus and tested five replicates each.
None of the substances tested at the concentrations indicated interfere with the test
results of negative or positive Influenza A and Influenza B samples in the Sofia
Influenza A+B FIA. Whole blood at concentration of > 4% v/v or mucin at
concentration of > 0.5% v/v interfered in the interpretation of the test.

i. Virus Stability in Transport Media:
Saline and eight different commercially available viral transport media (VTM) were
evaluated in this study. One influenza A and one influenza B isolate were used. Five
different Sofia Analyzers were used. Two different temperature conditions were
examined, including ambient room temperature (RT) and 2-8°C. The stability of
viruses ( 2-3 times of LoD) that were stored in VTM or saline for 0 hours, 2 hours, 4
hours, 6 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours of incubation at 2-8°C and RT was
examined in the Sofia Influenza A+B FIA. The study demonstrated that viruses
stored in M4, UTM, M5, M6, M4-RT and Starplex Multitrans for up to 72 hours at
either temperature still gave 100% correct results. Saline was not useable beyond 4
hours at RT, however, it could be used for up to 24 hours, if the samples were stored
at 2°C to 8°C. Hank’s and Stuart’s were inferior and not recommended for storing
specimens at RT. However, Hank’s can be used for storing specimens up 24 hours
and Stuart’s up to 6 hours at 2°C to 8°C. All the media were shown to be compatible
with the Sofia Influenza A+B FIA; none gave false positive or invalid results under
the conditions examined.

j. Rehydrated Extraction Reagent Stability:
Rehydrated extraction solution was stored at room temperature and aliquots were
tested at various time points spanning from zero to 24 hours after rehydrating the
lyophilized extractant. Five Sofia Analyzers and one influenza A and one influenza B
virus were used in this study. Influenza A and B viruses were diluted in saline to a

LoD. Five replicates were run for each condition.
All samples—influenza A and influenza B—tested 100% in agreement with the
expected results, regardless of duration of storage of the rehydrated extractant. There
were no false positive or negative results obtained at any condition with the virus-
spiked mock specimens.

k. Extracted Specimen Stability:
One of each influenza A and B virus was diluted to a TCID /mL concentration that
50
was approximately two to three times higher than the LoD. For each virus, five
dilutions were prepared using the following diluents: M5, M4, UTM and saline. The
viruses were diluted in saline, M5, UTM or M4 to the desired concentration, thus
mimicking a swab, nasopharyngeal aspirate, wash, or sample suspended in VTM. The
rehydrated extraction solution containing the blank buffer or viruses were stored at
room temperature and tested in replicates of five at the following time points: 1 min,
5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, 4 hr, 5 hr, and 24 hr. The results showed that
extracted samples containing influenza A or influenza B viruses can be stored in the
rehydrated extraction reagent for up to 24 hours at room temperature without
significantly affecting the performance of the Sofia Influenza A+B FIA. Negative
specimens, containing neither virus, tested negative throughout the time course, as
well.
l. Comparison of Read Now/Walk Away modes:
The comparative performance of 19 Sofia Analyzers was examined when using the
Read Now and Walk Away procedure modes. The exact same kit lot of Sofia
Influenza A+B FIA was used for this study. One influenza A and one influenza B
virus were used. The viruses were diluted in M5 to a TCID /mL concentration that
50
was approximately two times their respective LoDs. The study results showed that all
the negative (blank) and positive samples performed well, giving 100% agreement
with the expected results when using either the Read Now or Walk Away modes.
There were no false positive or false negative results obtained.

m. Shelf Life/Stability studies:
Three lots of Sofia Influenza A+B FIA were selected for real-time and accelerated
stability testing. Prior to placing the lots under the stress temperature conditions,
replicates of the positive (at 0.75 of LoD and at LoD for Influenza A and 0.75 of LoD
and at 1.75 of LoD for Influenza B) and negative samples, positive and negative
controls, and various media were tested (Day 0). The test kits were then placed under
the controlled stress temperature conditions. At each time point, units from each lot
were removed from the stress temperature conditions and tested per the Package
Insert according to the test schedule.

3. Clinical studies:
The performance of the Sofia Influenza A+B FIA was compared to viral cell culture
methods followed by DFA in a multi-center clinical field study during February
through March 2011 in the United States. This study was conducted by health care
personnel at seventeen (17) distinct sites in various geographical regions within the
United States. In this multi-center, point-of-care (POC) field trial, two (2) nasal or
two (2) nasopharyngeal swabs or nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash specimens were
collected from each of two thousand forty-seven (2047) patients. Six hundred sixty-
five (665) provided a nasal swab specimen, seven hundred thirty-three (733) provided
a nasopharyngeal swab specimen and six hundred forty-nine (649) provided a
nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash specimen. All clinical samples were collected from
symptomatic patients. Seventy-one percent (71%) of the population tested were <6

Fifty-three percent (53%) were male and forty-seven percent (47%) were female.
On-site testing of one nasal swab or nasopharyngeal swab or a portion of
nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash specimen in the Sofia Influenza A+B FIA test was
performed on the fresh specimen by medical personnel in the physician’s office or
hospital facility. The remaining sample was placed in viral transport media. The
paired swab samples were randomized with respect to the order of testing in the Sofia
Influenza A+B FIA versus culture. Cell culture was performed either at a local virus
laboratory of the test site or transported cold on ice packs, not frozen, overnight to a
central laboratory for culture within 48 hours.

A total of 2047 prospective clinical specimens were tested and gave valid results during
this clinical study. These results were included in the performance tables above. There
were nineteen (19) additional specimens (less than 1% of the total collected) that gave
invalid results. The invalid results were excluded from the performance tables above
because new patient specimens were not collected for re-testing. Of these 2047, five were
dual positives by Sofia Influenza A+B FIA. Only one out of these five was positive for
both Influenza A and B by virus culture.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The prevalence observed with the reference test (virus culture) during the 2011 clinical
study for Sofia Influenza A+B FIA was 15% for influenza A and 13% for influenza B.
N. Instrument Name:
Sofia Analyzer
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Sofia Analyzer is a bench top instrument intended to be used with cassette based
immunofluorescent in vitro diagnostic assays manufactured by Quidel Corporation.
After the extracted patient sample has been added to the test cassette, the test is
developed at room temperature for a pre-specified period of time. The cassette is then
placed into the Analyzer where it is scanned, and the fluorescent signal of the test is
processed using a test-specific algorithm. The algorithm calculates the Signal to Cut-off
(S/CO) value for each test line. This is the ratio of the signal on the Test Line expressed
in RFUs divided by the calculated cutoff for each analyte expressed in RFUs. When the
S/CO ratio is equal to or greater than 1, the test result for that analyte is positive. When
the S/CO is less than 1, the test result for that analyte is negative.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X___ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
The user ID, patient ID, and order # can be entered via a handheld barcode scanner or by
19

--- Page 20 ---
manually entering the information onto the keypad of the Sofia Analyzer.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Not applicable
5. Calibration:
The Calibration cassette is shipped with the Sofia Analyzer and the calibration check
procedure details are provided in the Sofia Analyzer user manual. The Calibration check
is the required function that checks the Sofia Analyzer optics and calculation systems
using the specific Calibration Cassette. The procedure is automatic and hence requires no
user input and should be performed every 30 days.
6. Quality Control:
There are three types of Quality Control for the Sofia Analyzer and Cassette: Sofia
Analyzer calibration procedure, built-in procedural control features, and External
Controls.
Built-in Procedural Controls:
The Sofia Influenza A+B FIA contains a built-in procedural control feature. Each time a
test is run in the Sofia Analyzer, the procedural control zone is scanned by the Sofia
Analyzer and the result is displayed on the Analyzer screen.
The manufacturer's recommendation for daily control is to document the results of these
built-in procedural controls for the first sample tested each day. This documentation is
automatically logged in the Analyzer with each test result.
A valid result obtained from the procedural control demonstrates that the test flowed
correctly and the functional integrity of the Cassette was maintained. The procedural
control is interpreted by the Sofia Analyzer after the Cassette has developed for fifteen
(15) minutes. If the test does not flow correctly, the Sofia Analyzer will indicate that the
result is invalid. Should this occur, review the procedure and repeat the test with a new
patient sample and a new test Cassette.
External Quality Control
External Controls may also be used to demonstrate that the reagents and assay procedure
perform properly.
Quidel recommends that Positive and Negative External Controls be run once for each
untrained operator, once for each new shipment of kits – provided that each different lot
received in the shipment is tested – and as deemed additionally necessary by your internal
quality control procedures, and in accordance with local, state and federal regulations or
accreditation requirements.
The user must first select Run QC on the main Menu of the Sofia Analyzer and then,
when prompted, scan the QC Card (located on kit box). This card provides information
specific to the kit lot, including lot number and expiration date.
20

--- Page 21 ---
The Analyzer will then prompt the user to run the External Control swabs.
External Positive and Negative Control swabs are supplied in the kit and should be tested
using the Swab Test Procedure provided in this Package Insert or in the Quick Reference
Instructions. Note: the Influenza Positive Control Swab should give a positive result for
both influenza A and influenza B.
Do not perform patient tests or report patient test results if the control tests do not
produce the expected results. Repeat the test or contact Quidel Technical Support before
testing patient specimens.
Additional External Control swabs may be obtained separately by contacting Quidel’s
Customer Support Services.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
