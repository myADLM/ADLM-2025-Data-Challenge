L. Test Principle:
The test wells are coated with recombinant SLA/LP. The cut-off calibrator, controls,
and diluted patient samples are added to the wells and autoantibodies recognizing the
antigen bind during the first incubation. After washing the wells to remove all
unbound proteins, conjugate is added. The conjugate binds to the captured human
autoantibodies. Excess unbound conjugate is removed by another wash step. The
bound conjugate is visualized with TMB substrate. Microtiter plates are read at 450
nm and a reference wavelength of 620 to 650 nm. The controls and patient results are
interpreted by comparing them as a ratio of the cut-off.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the assay was assessed using patient sera with a range
of values. Intra-assay reproducibility was assessed by 20 determinations on
one day while inter-assay reproducibility was based on 24 determinations
performed over six different days. The same samples were used in both
experiments. The expected result was determined from the sample mean. The
results that correctly matched the expected result were tallied. The results are
summarized in the tables below:

Lot-to-lot reproducibility was assessed using patient sera with a range of
values. Each sample/lot combination was tested between six and 38 times.
The expected result was determined from the sample mean. The results that
correctly matched the expected result were tallied. The results are summarized

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There are no international standards for SLA/LP antibodies. Sample results
are expressed as ratios of the cut-off calibrator.
Calibrators and Controls:
The cut-off calibrator and controls are derived from human serum and match
pre-specified performance criteria. Each lot of cut-off calibrator and controls
are traceable to a master lot.
Stability studies:
Stability studies are conducted in accordance to CEN 13640:2002. Three
production lots of all kit reagents were tested. Real-time stability studies
(+2°C to +8°C) support a 12-month unopened stability claim. Other studies
support that the re-constituted wash buffer is stable for up to 28 days, and the
opened reagents stored at +2°C to +8°C are stable for 12 months.
Sample stability:
The sponsor recommends following the guidelines in CLSI H18-A3 for
sample storage.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous interferents:
Five samples containing various levels of anti-SLA/LP levels were spiked

with varying concentrations of hemoglobin up to 1,000 mg/dL, triglycerides
up to 2,000 mg/dL, or bilirubin up to 40 mg/dL. Comparison of all spiked
sample/interferent combinations to the unspiked sample was within ±15% of
the original sample concentration except one; a sample with a ratio of 1.0
spiked with 40 mg/dL bilirubin had 119% recovery. Lower concentrations of
bilirubin in the same sample showed recovery ±10% of the unspiked sample.
Cross-reactivity with anti-LKM-1:
Twenty-eight (28) sera serologically positive for anti-LKM-1 antibodies were
tested with the assay and found negative for anti-SLA/LP antibodies
suggesting that antibodies specific for anti-LKM-1 do not bind to the SLA/LP
antigen coating the assay wells. Sample ratios ranged from 0.1 to 0.7.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-off is 1.0. Results ≥ 1.0 are positive.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
One hundred and sixty-seven (167) clinically characterized samples were
tested with the predicate device and the EUROIMMUN Anti-SLA/LP ELISA
(IgG). These samples were from patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH),
primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), AIH/PBC overlap syndrome, and viral
hepatitis. Twenty-three (23) samples intended to challenge the assay cut-off
were created by mixing positive and negative samples.

If borderline sample is considered positive:

Negative agreement 154/159 = 96.9% 95% CI: 92.8% - 98.6%

Negative agreement 154/160 = 96.2% 95% CI: 92.1% - 98.3%
b. Matrix comparison:
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that the new devices give the
same results for lithium heparin plasma, citrate plasma and EDTA plasma as
for serum samples collected from the same patient. Normal sample pairs were
spiked with anti-SLA/LP positive sera to create 16 samples that spanned the
assay range. Serum sample ratios ranged from 0.3 – 8.9. As compared to
serum samples, bias of the heparin plasma, citrate plasma and EDTA plasma
