L. Test Principle:
The test wells are coated with recombinant cytochrome P450 IID6. The cut-off
calibrator, controls, or diluted patient samples are added to the wells and
autoantibodies recognizing the antigen bind during the first incubation. After washing
the wells to remove all unbound proteins, conjugate is added. The conjugate binds to
the captured human autoantibodies. Excess unbound conjugate is removed by another
wash step. The bound conjugate is visualized TMB substrate. The intensity of color
development is proportional to the concentration of autoantibody in the sample.
Microtiter plates are read at 450 nm and a reference wavelength of 620 to 650 nm.
The controls and patient results are interpreted by comparing them as a ratio of the
cut-off calibrator.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the assay was assessed using patient sera with a range
of values. Intra-assay reproducibility was assessed by 20 determinations on
one day while inter-assay reproducibility was based on 24 determinations
performed over six different days. The samples were the same in both
determinations. The expected result was determined from the sample mean.
The results that correctly matched the expected result were tallied. The results
are summarized in the tables below:
Intra-assay reproducibility:

Lot-to-lot reproducibility was assessed using patient sera with a range of
values distributed over the measurement range. Each sample/lot combination
was tested between six and 38 times. The expected result was determined
from the sample mean. The numbers of results that correctly match the
expected result were determined. The results are summarized in the table

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There are no international standards for LKM-1 antibodies. The results are
expressed as ratios of the cut-off calibrator.
Calibrators and Controls:
The cut-off calibrator and controls are derived from human serum and match
pre-specified performance criteria. Each lot of cut-off calibrator and controls
are traceable to a master lot.
Stability studies:
Stability studies are conducted in accordance to CEN 13640:2002. Three
production lots of all kit reagents were tested. Real-time stability studies
(+2°C to +8°C) support a 12-month unopened stability claim. Other studies
support that the re-constituted wash buffer is stable for up to 28 days, and
opened reagents stored at +2°C to +8°C are stable for 12 months.
Sample stability:
The sponsor recommends following the guidelines in CLSI H18-A3 for
sample storage.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.

e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous interferents:
Five samples containing various levels of anti-LKM-1 were spiked with
varying concentrations of hemoglobin up to 1,000 mg/dL, triglycerides up to
2,000 mg/dL, or bilirubin up to 40 mg/dL. Comparison of all spiked
sample/interferent combinations to the unspiked sample was within ±15% of
the original sample concentration except one; a sample with a ratio of 7.2
spiked with 2,000 mg/dL triglycerides had 119% recovery. Lower
concentrations of triglycerides in the same sample showed recovery ± 15% of
the unspiked sample.
Cross-reactivity with anti-SLA/LP:
Twenty-eight (28) sera serologically positive for anti-SLA/LP antibodies were
tested with the assay and found negative for anti-LKM-1 antibodies
suggesting that antibodies specific for anti-SLA/LP do not bind to the LKM-1
antigen coating the assay wells. Sample ratios ranged from 0.1 – 0.9.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-off is 1.0. Results > 1.0 are positive.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
One hundred and sixty-seven (167) clinically characterized samples were
tested with the predicate device and the EUROIMMUN Anti-LKM-1 ELISA
(IgG). These samples were from patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH),
primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), AIH/PBC overlap syndrome, and viral
hepatitis. Twenty-nine samples intended to challenge the assay cut-off were
created by mixing positive and negative samples:
Predicate*
Positive Negative Total
Positive 35 5 40
EUROIMMUNE
Negative 1 155 156
Anti-LKM-1 ELISA
Total 36 160 196
*The predicate assay has an equivocal zone for result interpretation but none
of the samples fell in this range.
Positive agreement 35/36= 97.2% 95% CI: 85.5% - 99.9%
Negative agreement 155/160 = 96.6% 95% CI: 92.9% - 99.0%
b. Matrix comparison:
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that the new devices give the
same results for lithium heparin plasma, citrate plasma and EDTA plasma for
serum samples collected from the same patient. Normal sample pairs were
spiked with anti-LKM-1 positive sera to create 16 samples that spanned the
assay range. Serum sample ratios ranged from 0.4 – 9.6. Bias of the heparin
plasma, citrate plasma, and EDTA plasma samples ranged from 93% to 109%,

87% to 106%, and 93% to 106%, respectively.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical sensitivity and specificity:
Five hundred and fifteen (515) clinically characterized samples from several
university, hospital, and private laboratories were analyzed with the
EUROIMMUN Anti-LKM-1 ELISA (IgG) test to assess the clinical
sensitivity and specificity. The samples consisted of 68 AIH-2, 65 AIH-1, 111
primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), 15 from patients with AIH/PBC overlap
syndrome, 47 hepatitis B, 71 hepatitis C, 19 primary sclerosing cholangitis
(PSC), 24 steatohepatitis, 14 toxic liver damage, and 81 samples from other
autoimmune diseases.
