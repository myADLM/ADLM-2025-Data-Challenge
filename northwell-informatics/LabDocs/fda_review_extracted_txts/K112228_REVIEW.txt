3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
The ability of the VITEK 2 Streptococcus to detect resistance to Levofloxacin in
S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes is unknown because resistant organisms were not
available at the time of comparative testing.
4. Special instrument requirements:
For use with the VITEK® 2 and VITEK® 2 Compact Systems
I. Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is essentially a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated
version of the doubling dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC). Each VITEK 2 AST card contains 64 wells. A control well
which only contains microbiological culture media is resident on all cards. The
remaining wells contain premeasured portions of a specific antibiotic combined with
culture media. The bacterial or yeast isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized
concentration with 0.45 – 0.5% saline before being used to rehydrate the
antimicrobial medium within the card. The VITEK 2 System automatically fills, seals
and places the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual
filling, sealing and loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of
each well in the card over a defined period of time. At the completion of the
incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the
interpretive category result for each antibiotic contained on the card.
The VITEK 2 Streptococcus Levofloxacin has the following concentrations in the
card: 1, 2, 4 and 16 μg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in
μg/mL). The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 card is ≤ 0.25 – ≥ 16μg/mL.
The MIC ranges, interpretive criteria and equivalent concentrations are as follows:

Supplement, M100-S19.
L. Test Principle:
Automated growth based detection using attenuation of light measured by an optical
scanner. The optics used in the systems use visible light to directly measure organism
growth. Transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before
significant growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same
well measure organism growth by how much light is prevented from going through
the well. The VITEK 2 System monitors the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period of time. An interpretive call is made between 4 and 16 hours for a
“rapid” read but may be extended to 18 hours in some instances. At the completion of
the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the
interpretive category result for each antibiotic on the card. The VITEK 2
Streptococcus Levofloxacin has the following concentrations in the card: 1, 2, 4 and
16 μg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in μg/mL). The
MIC result range for the VITEK 2 card is ≤ 0.25 – ≥ 16 μg/mL.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three external clinical sites. Ten
Streptococcus species isolates were tested at each site and testing was
performed in triplicate over three days with the VITEK 2 Streptococcus
Levofloxacin card. The testing was performed using both the manual and the
automated dilution methods. Testing was conducted on the VITEK 2
instrument.
All reproducibility isolates were inhibited at concentrations in the susceptible
range for Levofloxacin and all MIC values were on-scale. Reproducibility
was 100% with by both manual dilution and automated dilution.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended Streptococcus pneumonia QC organism was tested on
every test occasion with the reference method and the VITEK 2 System.
Ancillary quality control testing was also performed. Two gram-positive
organisms were tested throughout comparative testing at each study site by the
reference method only. This was done to perform further quality control of the
broth microdilution panels using E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and S. aureus
ATCC 29213 which have a QC range of 0.25 -2 µg/mL and 0.06-0.5 µg/mL
respectively for Levofloxacin.
The reference method QC results were in range for every day tested. The
VITEK 2 was tested a sufficient number of times to demonstrate that the
system can produce acceptable QC results.
Quality Control was performed during the studies using both the auto-dilution
and the manual method of diluting the organisms on the VITEK 2 System.
Results demonstrated that methods were comparable.

days. Quality Control results for the VITEK 2 System using either inoculation
dilution method demonstrated that the VITEK 2 System could produce the
expected quality control results.
A similar QC study was conducted to evaluate the VITEK 2 Compact System.
Results were compared to the expected FDA/CLSI QC results. All results for
the VITEK 2 Compact System were within the expected QC ranges 100% of
the time.
Inoculum density control was monitored using the DensiChek2 instrument.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Performance was established through a clinical study which was conducted at
four external study sites. A total of 1338 clinical isolates were tested by
VITEK® 2 Streptococcus Levofloxacin with the VITEK® 2 System. The
majority of the isolates were recently isolated from clinical specimens and the
growth rate was 100%. Two hundred and nine of the 1338 clinical isolates
tested were stock isolates (15.6%). A challenge set consisting of 207 isolates
was evaluated with VITEK® 2 Streptococcus Levofloxacin panel at one
external site.
Testing of clinical isolates was performed using the automated method of
inoculation and the challenge organisms were tested with both the manual
dilution and automatic dilution. Each isolate was tested by the VITEK 2
Levofloxacin Streptococcus panel and the CLSI broth microdilution reference
method. The inoculum was prepared with direct colony suspension. A
comparison was provided to the reference method with the following
agreement. Thirty-two minor errors were seen.

A CA of 97.7%/99.5 % was observed for clinical/challenge isolates,
respectively. An EA of 98.9%/100 % was observed for clinical/challenge
isolates, respectively. However, a right shift in MIC occurred around the
intermediate breakpoint.
No major or very major categorical errors occurred but a total of 32 (2.1%)
minor categorical errors were seen. Of note is that all of the minor errors seen
shifted the interpretation from “Susceptible” by the reference method to
“Intermediate” by VITEK. Those minor errors were as follows: 17 were with
S. pyogenes, 6 were with S. agalactiae, 6 were with S. mitis/oralis, 2 were
with S. dysgalactiae and 1 was with S. oralis. No Levofloxacin-resistant S.
pneumoniae or S. pyogenes isolates were tested in this evaluation.
Performance of the VITEK® 2 and the VITEK® 2 Compact was also evaluated
with the same 207 challenge organisms using the manual dilution method.
Results from those two studies showed CA of 99.5% and 98.1% and EA of
100% and 98.6% respectively for VITEK® 2 and the VITEK® 2 Compact.
All ranges were acceptable as defined in the AST Guidance Document.
