H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indications(s) for use:
Wondfo Methadone Urine Test:
Wondfo Methadone Urine Test is an immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative
determination of methadone in human urine at a cutoff concentration of 300 ng/mL. The
test is available in a dip card format and a cup format. It is intended for prescription use
and over the counter use.
The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical
method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. GC/MS is the
preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should
be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is
positive.
Wondfo Morphine (2000) Urine Test:
Wondfo Morphine (2000) Urine Test is an immunochromatographic assay for the
qualitative determination of Morphine in human urine at a cutoff concentration of 2000
ng/mL. The test is available in a dip card format and a cup format. It is intended for
prescription use and over the counter use.
The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical
method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. GC/MS is the
preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should
be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is
positive.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription and over-the counter use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
The tests are in different formats: dip card and cup
2

--- Page 3 ---
Page 3 of 20
The Dip Card format is a test with an integrated cup. It is a rapid test for the qualitative
detection of Methadone and Morphine. It is a lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay.
When the absorbent end of the test device is immersed into the urine sample, the urine is
absorbed into the device by capillary action, mixes with the antibody-dye conjugate, and
flows across the pre-coated membrane. When sample drug levels are zero or below the
target cut off (the detection sensitivity of the test), antibody-dye conjugate binds to the drug-
protein conjugate immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the device. This produces a colored
Test line, which regardless of its intensity, indicates a negative result.
When sample drug levels are at or above the target cutoff, the free drug in the binding
sample binds to the antibody-dye conjugate preventing the antibody-dye conjugate from
binding to the drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test region (T) of the device. This
prevents the development of a distinct colored band in the test region, indicating a
potentially positive result.
To serve as a procedure control, a colored line will appear at the Control Region (C), if the
test has been performed properly because of the antibody-dye conjugate binding to anti-
mouse IgG immobilized in the Control Region of the device.
The Cup format is the same function or performance specification of dip card. It is
composed of an integrated cup and a functional dip card. When the key is inserted to the cup
and rotated to activate the test, the urine is absorbed into the device by capillary action,
mixes with the antibody-dye conjugate, and flows across the pre-coated membrane. When
sample drug levels are zero or below the target cut off (the detection sensitivity of the test),
antibody-dye conjugate binds to the drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test Region
(T) of the device. This produces a colored Test line, which regardless of its intensity,
indicates a negative result.
When sample drug levels are at or above the target cutoff, the free drug in the binding
sample binds to the antibody-dye conjugate preventing the antibody-dye conjugate from
binding to the drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test region (T) of the device. This
prevents the development of a distinct colored band in the test region, indicating a
potentially positive result.
To serve as a procedure control, a colored line will appear at the Control Region (C), if the
test has been performed properly because of the antibody-dye conjugate binding to anti-
mouse IgG immobilized in the Control Region of the device.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision study was performed by taking negative urine samples and spiking these
with: 600, 525, 450, 375, 300, 225, 150, 75 and 0 ng/ml of methadone, corresponding
to ± 25, 50, 75, and 100% of the 300 ng/ml cut-off value; and 4000, 3500, 300, 2500,
2000, 1500, 1000, 500 and 0 ng/ml of morphine, corresponding to ± 25, 50, 75, and
100% of the 2000 ng/ml cut-off value. Two sets of operators performed the testing
(group A ran the cup format and group B ran the dip card format) and the samples
were divided into 12 sets of 25 (one set per lot per run for each format). Three lots of
the cup and three lots of the dip card formats of the Wondfo Methadone Urine Test
and Wondfo Morphine (2000) Urine Test were used. Each of three operators tested 2
aliquots at each concentration for each lot per day (2 runs per day for 25 days),
resulting in a total of 50 determinations by each operator at each concentration. The
operators were blinded. A summary of the results is presented in the tables below.

Specificity and cross-reactivity was performed by using three batches of both the cup
and dip card formats of the Wondfo Methadone Urine Test and Wondfo Morphine
(2000) Urine Tests. The samples were split into two aliquots and one group of
operators ran the cup format on one set of aliquots and a separate group of operators
ran the dip card format on the other set of aliquots. Thirty drug-free urine samples
were tested and all were found to be negative, five were confirmed by GC/MS to have
a concentration of zero. Cross-reactivity was determined by spiking the target drug,
drug metabolites and the same class compounds that may cross-react with the target
drugs into drug-free urine at three different concentrations and measuring the samples
in triplicate using three batches of cups and three batches of dip cards.

The pH of a drug-free urine pool was adjusted to pH 4, pH 5, pH 6, pH 7, pH 8 or pH
9; the urine was spiked with ± 25% of the cut-off concentration of methadone or
morphine, individually and tested using three batches of cup and three batches of dip
card of the Wondfo Methadone Urine Test and Wondfo Morphine (2000) Urine
Tests, respectively. The spiked, pH-adjusted urine was tested in triplicate. Altering
the pH of the urine sample did not affect the accuracy of any of the test results.
The specific gravity of a drug-free urine pool was measured by obtaining urine
samples with specific gravities of 1.000-1.035 and spiking with ± 25% of the cut-off
concentration of methadone and morphine, individually using three batches of cup
and three batches of dip card of the Wondfo Methadone Urine Test and Wondfo
Morphine (2000) Urine Test, respectively. The spiked urines of different specific
gravities were tested in triplicate. The results indicate that there is stable performance
of the Wondfo Methadone Urine Test and Wondfo Morphine Urine Tests when
urine has a specific gravity between 1.00-1.035.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut off was investigated by using three batches of both the cup and dip card
of the Wondfo Methadone Urine Test and Wondfo Morphine (2000) Urine Test to test
150 urine samples each. These samples came from the Shezhen Drug Addiction
Recovery Center (25 Drug urine samples each with Methadone or morphine) and
from drug-free urine samples (125 samples) spiked with methadone or morphine (125
samples for each drug) diluted from the International Drug Standard (Sigma) to
concentrations that are plus and minus 25% and 50 % of the cutoff concentrations.
Drug concentrations were confirmed by GC/MS. Results were read by three
laboratory assistants with relevant experience. The cutoff studies were performed by
two separate groups of operators (one for the strip format and one for the cassette
format). Three operators in each group performed the readings and they were blinded
to the sample. Each result was confirmed by at least two assistants.

1. Performance of the Wondfo Methadone Urine Test and Wondfo Morphine (2000)
Urine Test (cup and dip stick formats) was established by comparing 80 samples
of each analyte against GC/MS. These samples came from drug-free urine (10
samples each), the Shezhen Drug Addiction Recovery Center (70 samples for
each analyte) and from clinical samples with concentrations ranges as follows:
drug free urine, < -50% of the cut-off, -50% of the cut-off to the cut-off, cut-off to
+50% of the cut-off, and > +50% of the Cut-off. There were two groups of
operators (one for the cup format and one for the dip stick format) and they were
blinded to the samples. Each result was read by three laboratory assistants with
relevant experience and a lay person with no experience other than reading the
instructions for use.

B. A lay-user study was performed to assess the suitability of the device for home
use. Six drug-free urine sample pools were spiked to ± 25%, ± 50%, ± 75% of the
cutoff of target drug, additionally a negative urine pool with no drug was tested.
These concentrations were confirmed by GC/MS and aliquoted into 40 individual
containers per concentration (20 aliquots per concentration for each strip format).
The testing was performed at three sites by 140 blinded consumers divided
between three sites (140 users for cup, 140 for dip card for each of the Wondfo
