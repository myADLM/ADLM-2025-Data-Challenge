I. Device Description:
The y.b.t. Pregnancy Test will be marketed in two formats: cassette and test strip. The test
strip kit consists of one test device and a package insert. The cassette kit consists of one test
device and a disposable plastic dropper, and a package insert. The device is a qualitative
assay based on immunochromatography principle used to detect levels of hCG over the cut-
off value (25 IU/L) of the device. The device utilizes mouse monoclonal anti-β-hCG gold
conjugated antibody as a signal reagent and a goat anti- mouse anti-α-hCG polyclonal
antibody as solid phase capture antibody. The control antibodies are goat anti-mouse IgG.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None were referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The test utilizes monoclonal gold conjugated antibody as a signal reagent and a
polyclonal antibody as solid phase capture antibody. As the urine sample flows through the
absorbent sample pad, the urine reconstitutes the dried beta hCG conjugate. The hCG in the
urine sample will bind to this conjugate antibody and migrate further up the membrane to the
test line immobilized with capture hCG antibody. A complex is formed at this site indicated
by a pink line. When the concentration of hCG is lower than 25 IU/L no complex is formed
and no pink line is observed.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
An in-house precision study was performed by 1 laboratory technician using male urine
samples spiked with different concentrations of hCG. Ten different concentrations (0, 25,

combination with the precision study in section 1.a. No hook effect was observed up
to 500,000 IU/L of hCG.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The devices are traceable to the WHO 3rd International Standard for hCG.
Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable. Accelerated stability and real-time stability studies were performed on
both test strip and cassette formats. The sponsor states that the shelf-life of the device
is 18 months when stored at 25° C.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable to qualitative test
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were conducted on common interfering substances listed in the
table below using two human male urine pools: 1) negative male urine control ( 0
IU/L of hCG) and 2) male urine samples spiked with 25 IU/L of hCG, with both
strips and cassettes. Various concentrations of each interferent listed below were
added to the tested urine pools to see if the interferent will affect the reading of the
tested specimens. For each interferent tested, the highest concentration without resulting
in interference for the device is summarized below:

Cross-reactivity studies were performed to evaluate the interferences from other
glycoprotein hormones, hFSH, hLH, and hTSH. Human FSH (1000 IU/L, WHO 2nd
HMG), hLH (1000 IU/L, WHO 68/38), and hTSH (1000 IU/L, WHO 2nd HMG) were
added to male urine samples at two hCG concentrations (0 and 25 IU/L). Each sample
was run on three lots of strips and cassettes and a total of 90 urine samples were
tested. The results of these studies showed that there is no cross-reactivity at 1000
IU/L hFSH, 1000 IU/L hLH, or 1000 IU/L hTSH.
Cross-reactivity studies to β-core hCG were also performed; the results indicate there
was no cross-reactivity with β-core hCG up to 20,000,000 pmol/L.
The effects of pH and specific gravity were evaluated by testing urine samples spiked
with hCG (at 0, 25 and 100 IU/L) at pH 4-8 or specific gravity of 1.010-1.027. No
interference was observed for these pH or specific gravities tested.
f. Assay cut-off:
The sponsor performed an in-house cut-off study separately from the precision study for
the test strip and cassette formats. The claimed cut-off is 25 IU/L. Negative human urine
samples were spiked with purified hCG traceable to the WHO International 3rd Standard
to reach 5, 10, 20 (-20% cutoff), 23, 25, 30(+20% cutoff), 50 and 100 IU/L of hCG final
concentrations. For each concentration, the performance was evaluated 40 times using
three lots of the test strips and cassettes. The results are shown in the table below.

POC precision near cutoff
The detection limit was evaluated in 3 point-of-care sites by testing 40 hCG-negative
urine samples per site by three intended users. Freshly collected urine samples, from
healthy men were spiked with 0, 5, 8, 10, 20, 23, 25, and 50 IU/L of hCG. The
samples were masked and randomized prior to analysis. The intact hCG used in this
study is traceable to WHO 3rd standard. The results are shown below:

hCG and 100% % positive rate at 25 IU/L hCG (the cutoff).
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Comparison studies between 1) the test strip and predicate device; 2) the test cassette and
predicate device, were conducted by total of 7 healthcare professionals at 3 clinical sites
on 3 lots of each device format. Each site collected 60 samples (N=180) for each format.
The samples were collected from women who were of childbearing age, peri-
menopausal, or suspected of being pregnant, and those in their early or late pregnancy.
All samples were masked and randomized prior to analysis. Users performed the testing
according to the labeling. Test results are summarized below:
