L. Test Principle:
The ADVIA Centaur syphilis assay is a fully automated, antigen sandwich assay, using direct
chemiluminometric technology. The ancillary pack reagent containing acridinium-ester-labeled
T. pallidum recombinant antigens is added to the sample. These T. pallidum antigens complex
with the antibodies in the sample. The solid phase containing biotinylated T. pallidum
recombinant antigens preformed to streptavidin-coated magnetic latex particles is then added to
the sample. These particles capture the T. pallidum antigen-antibody complexes. Antibody-
antigen complexes will form if Syphilis antibodies are present in the sample. A direct
relationship exists between the level of antibodies to T. pallidum present in the patient sample
and the amount of relative light units (RLUs) detected by the system. A result of reactive,
nonreactive, or equivocal is determined according to the Index Value established with the
calibrators.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision estimates were computed according to CLSI document EP05-A2, Evaluation
of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline.
Within run and total imprecision were evaluated by testing 5 serum based samples
(serum sample pools), 3 plasma based samples (2 controls. low and high. and one
additional plasma pool) and 2 calibrators (low and high). The elevated levels were
spiked with syphilis antigen to achieve appropriate concentrations. The samples were
assayed in duplicate over the course of 20 days, two runs per day, for a total of 40 runs
and 80 replicates.

Calibrators are prepared by spiking samples positive for T. pallidum into phosphate
buffer containing BSA and preservatives to target concentrations of 0.65 and 8.0
The Negative Control is human negative plasma with a target index of <0.3. The
positive control is prepared by spiking samples positive for T. pallidum into negative
plasma to a target index of 4.0
d. Detection limit:
Samples with an Index Value < 0.90 are considered nonreactive for syphilis T. pallidum
antibodies.
Samples with an Index Value ≥ 0.90 and < 1.10 are considered equivocal.
Samples with an Index Value ≥ 1.10 are considered reactive for syphilis T. pallidum
antibodies.

Special Populations
A total of 211 cord blood samples, samples from pregnant women (1st , 2nd, and 3rd
trimester), samples from hospitalized patients, pediatric samples and transplant samples
were tested using the ADVIA Centaur Syphilis assay and the predicate device (predicate
device). Each sample was tested in singlicate using one lot of reagent on one system.
Predicate device and Centaur Syphilis results were determined reactive, non-reactive or
indeterminate/equivocal according to the respective result interpretation.

Interference
Interference by endogenous substances was evaluated in the ADVIA Centaur syphilis assay.
Serum pools were prepared at three levels (negative, low positive and high positive for T.
pallidum). Each pool was spiked with an interferent to the levels indicated in the table below.
There was no indication of interference up to the levels claimed. For positive samples all
results demonstrated < 10% change in index value, with the exception of gamma globulin at
concentrations above 30 mg/dl.

f. Assay cut-off:
The ADVIA Centaur Syphilis assay report results as reactive, non-reactive or equivocal
based on Index Values. Index values are calculated based on a two point assay calibration
curve. The cut-off value was established by evaluating negative and positive samples on
the ADVIA Centaur Syphilis assay. The analysis showed a clear separation of negative
and positive results using a cutoff index of 1. After establishment of the cut- off, an
equivocal range of +/- 10% was set bracketing the cut-off value to encourage additional
testing for index values that are close to the cut-off. The placement of the assay's cut-off
and product performance were validated during clinical trials using receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) analysis.
A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to compare the
diagnostic area under the curve of the ADVIA Centaur Syphilis assay to the
IMMULITE 2000 assay. For validation of the cut off, the populations used for the
analysis were the 806 apparently healthy subjects (negative diagnosis) and the 285
medically diagnosed subjects. The results show that the area under the curve is nearly
identical for the two assays, and that the difference observed is not statistically
significant (p = 0.5282). Results obtained using a cut-off of 1.0 in the ROC analyses
demonstrated positive and negative percentage agreement is 97.9% and 99.4%
respectively, meeting acceptance criteria.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The performance of the ADVIA Centaur Syphilis assay was evaluated at 3 clinical sites
in geographically diverse locations. Percent agreement was determined by comparing
the performance of the ADVIA Centaur SYPH assay to a commercially available syphilis
assay. A total of 2108 samples were tested. These samples were from 474 apparently
healthy subjects (including pediatrics), 285 medically-diagnosed syphilis samples, 124
samples reactive by previous laboratory testing (treponemal and non-
9

--- Page 10 ---
treponemal methods), 370 samples sent for routine syphilis testing, 339 samples from
pregnant subjects (with or without reactive treponemal result), and 516 HIV-positive
samples (with or without a reactive treponemal result). These samples were tested on the
ADVIA Centaur system, split between 2 different test lots, and compared to a
commercially available syphilis assay.
Percent Agreement: Total Study Population
The negative percent agreement of the ADVIA Centaur SYPH assay compared to the
predicate device was 99.4% (1382/1391) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 98.8 to
99.7%.
The positive percent agreement of the ADVIA Centaur SYPH assay compared to the

comparator assay was 98.4% (568/577) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 97.1 to
99.3%.
The positive percent agreement of the ADVIA Centaur SYPH assay compared to the
comparator assay was 98.2% (160/163) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 94.7 to
99.6%.

b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix study was performed to evaluate a variety of specimen tube types for
compatibility with the ADVIA Centaur Syphilis assay. Serum glass was used as the
control tube to which the following tubes were compared: Serum plastic (SST), K
2
EDTA plastic, lithium and sodium heparin plastic, sodium citrate plastic and ACD
glass. Results showed that the negative samples stayed negative across all tube types.
For positive samples, no bias was observed in all the other tube types except the ACD
tube type. There was a slight increase in index value with negative samples in the
ACD tube type so this tube type is not recommended for use with the assay.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not Applicable (See Item 2a above)
b. Clinical specificity:
Not Applicable (See Item 2a above)
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not Applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
A total of 806 apparently healthy male and female subjects [including pregnant
(332), pediatric (75), and adult/not pregnant (399)] were tested using the
ADVIA Centaur Syphilis assay. Of these samples, 5 (0.6%) were reactive, 0 (0.0%) were
equivocal, and 801 (99.4%) were nonreactive.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
