b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
New lots of material are verified to ensure the trueness of measurement are
equivalent to prior lot of the same material (± 3%) using YSI 2300 or equivalent
calibrated with solutions provided by YSI traceable to NIST SRM 917.
Value Assignment:
The analytical values for each production lot of material are confirmed by comparison
of new production lots of material to the Reference Lot of product with the same
formulation in parallel measurement on the YSI 2300 reference method in order to
maintain lot‐to‐lot variability within close tolerances.
Value assignment for each production lot of control solution was conducted with both
types (NIPRO or Liberty) of current version blood glucose meters, test strips and
quality control solutions purchased through retail outlets. Briefly, three lots of test
strips for each meter/strip type combination are evaluated following the following
sequence:
(1) Five measurements of control solution distributed with each meter (NIPRO or
Liberty branded) on each of two meters to qualify the meters and test strip lots or
use. All measurement values must fall within value assignment provided by the
manufacturer for the control solution printed on the test strip vials (total 30
measurements).
(2) Ten measurements of the Glucose Meter‐Check Solution on each of two
meters, on each of the three lots of test strips (total 60 measurements).
(3) Value assignment for Glucose Meter‐Check Control Solution for NIPRO
TRUEresult is determined as the mean of all measurements on all meters and test
strips ± 15 mg/dL (Level 1) and ± 17% of the mean value (Level 2), providing a
single acceptable value range for all test strips.
Acceptance criteria: Resulting value assignment is deemed acceptable if > 95% of all
individual measurements values fall within the range of acceptable values determined
by this method.
For each released lot, > 95% (100%) of all measurements of Meter‐Check control
Level 1 and Level 2 were found to be within these limits and therefore, the
acceptance criteria are met. The results of a representative value assignment protocol
are presented in the table below:

The acceptable range is printed on the control solution vial label. The package insert
clearly instructs users to always compare their result to the range printed on the
control solution vial, not on the test strip vial label.
Stability:
Product stability has been established based on real time studies.
(1) Open-Vial Stability: Acceptable performance (4‐30 °C storage after opening at
the end of 90‐days) is determined as less than 10% change in glucose
concentration in product stored at 30°C as measured by YSI 2300 against
reference material of the same product stored at 2‐8 °C. Product is opened and 5‐7
drops dispensed weekly during this period to simulate heavy use.
(2) Closed-Vial Stability: Acceptable performance (4‐30 °C storage at the end of
twenty‐four months) is determined as less than 10% change in glucose
concentration in product stored at 30°C as measured by YSI 2300 against
reference material stored at 2‐8 °C
(3) Transport Stability: Acceptable performance (product should withstand ≤ ‐10 °C
for at least 5 days followed by at least 5 days at +45 °C following the freeze/thaw
cycle) is determined as less than 10% change in glucose concentration in product
stored at 30°C after freeze/thaw as measured by YSI 2300 against reference
material stored at 2‐8 °C.

N. Proposed Labeling:
The following warning is displayed in the warning and precaution section of the labeling to
mitigate the risk of misuse and misinterpretation of the control solutions:
IMPORTANT: The result of a control test with this solution is NOT
automatically marked as a control solution test.
PLEASE NOTE: When using this control material on the NIPRO
TRUEresult Blood Glucose Meter, the control results can not be
differentiated from the patient’s results and therefore will be
incorporated into the calculation of the patient’s average
glucose concentration.
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
