L. Test Principle:
Glucose is phosphorylated with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the reaction
catalyzed by hexokinase (HK). The product, glucose–6-phosphate (G6P) is then
oxidized with the concomitant reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)
to NADH in the reaction catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PDH).
The formation of NADH causes an increase in absorbance at 340nm. The increase is
directly proportional to the amount of glucose in the sample.
The ion selective electrodes develop a voltage that varies with the concentration of
the ion (Na+, K+, Cl-) to which they are specific. The relationship between the
voltage developed and the concentration of the sensed ion is logarithmic and
calculated by the Nernst equation.
