2. Indication(s) for use:
Wondfo Phencyclidine Urine Test
Wondfo Phencyclidine Urine Test is an immunochromatographic assay for the
qualitative determination of Phencyclidine in human urine at a cutoff
concentration of 25 ng/mL. The test is available in a dip card format and a cup
format. It is intended for prescription use and over the counter use.
The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative
chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result.
GC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and
professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result,
particularly when the preliminary result is positive.
Wondfo Nortriptyline Urine Test
Wondfo Nortriptyline Urine Test is an immunochromatographic assay for the
qualitative determination of Nortriptyline (major metabolite of Tricyclic
Antidepressants) in human urine at a cutoff concentration of 1000 ng/mL. The test
is available in a dip card format and a cup format. It is intended for prescription
use and over the counter use.
The tests will yield preliminary positive results when the prescription drug
Nortriptyline is ingested, even at or above therapeutic doses. There are no uniformly
recognized drug levels for Nortriptyline in urine. The test provides only preliminary
test results. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to
obtain a confirmed analytical result. GC/MS is the preferred confirmatory
method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be exercised
with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is
positive.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription and over the counter use
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable, as the device is a visually-read single-use device
I. Device Description:
The devices are for use in human urine in dip card and cup formats. The Dip Card
and Cup Tests are single-test test strips. The Dip Card and Cup Tests contain test
cassettes or cup and package insert (instructions for use). Both devices are single-use
and visually read.

L. Test Principle:
The Wondfo Phencyclidine Urine Test and Wondfo Nortriptyline Urine Test are
immunochromatographic assay for Phencyclidine and Nortriptyline Urine test using a
lateral flow, one step system for the qualitative detection of Phencyclidine and
Nortriptyline (target analyte) in human urine. Each assay uses a mouse monoclonal
antibody-dye conjugate against drug with gold chloride and fixed drug-protein
conjugate and anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody in membrane.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed using drug free urine spiked to the following
concentrations: 0, +100%, +/-75% of cutoff, +/- 50% of cutoff, +/-25% of
cutoff and the cutoff for each analyte and each device. The samples were
aliquots, coded, randomized and blinded. Testing was performed twice a day
for twenty-five days by three operators. Three different lot numbers for each
device were used for the study. A total of 50 determinations were made at
each concentration and each lot. Sample concentrations were confirmed by
GC/MS. The results are displayed in the tables below:

Not applicable, the devices are intended for qualitative use.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
External control materials are not supplied with this device; however, the device
has internal process controls. A colored line appearing in the control region
indicates sufficient sample volume and adequate membrane wicking. Users are
informed that the test is invalid if a line fails to appear in the control region.
Stability
Accelerated and real time studies have been conducted. Protocols and
acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. The
manufacturer claims the following expiration date: The Wondfo
Phencyclidine Urine Test and Wondfo Nortriptyline Urine Test unopened
stability is 18 months for both formats (cup and dip card).
d. Detection limit:
Analytical performance of the device around the cutoff is described in Section f.
(assay cut-off) below.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was established by spiking similarly structured compounds
into drug free urine at various concentrations. These solutions were tested
using 3 lots/device (dip card and cup). Results are expressed as a minimum
concentration of metabolite or compound required to produce a response
approximately equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the assay. Both
devices produced similar results. The percent cross-reactivity of those
compounds are presented below:
Compound Tested Concentration % Cross-reactivity

To evaluate the effect of specific gravity, 12 having specific gravities of
1.000, 1.003, 1.007, 1.008, 1.017, 1.019, 1.020, 1.025, and 1.030, 1.031, 1.033
and 1.035 were spiked with drug at +/-25% of the cut-off values. Testing was
performed on 3 lots/device (dip card and cup).
The testing results demonstrate that varying pH’s and specific gravities do not
affect urine testing results around each analyte cut-off.
f. Assay cut-off:
Cutoff studies were performed for phencyclidine and Nortriptyline using a
combination of clinical and spiked samples for each drug (n=150 per drug).
The testing protocol was identical for each drug.
25 clinical samples were collected for each drug. Concentrations of
phencyclidine and Nortriptyline in the samples were determined by GC/MS.
An additional 125 drug free negative samples were obtained for each drug and
spiked with either phencyclidine or nortriptyline at -50% cutoff, -25% cutoff,
cutoff, +25% cutoff, and +50 % cutoff. 5 clinical samples and 25 spiked
samples were tested at each concentration for each drug in replicates of 30
using three lots and 3 operators (n=270). Results are summarized below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison for the Wondfo Phencyclidine Urine Test and
Wondfo Nortriptyline Urine Test was performed in-house with three
laboratory assistants with relevant experience and a lay person with no
experience other than reading the instructions for use. Operators ran 80 (40
negative and 40 positive) unaltered clinical samples. The samples were blind
labeled and compared to GC/MS results. The results are presented in the table
below:

Test Cup format:
A lay user study was performed with 140 lay persons/drug from three locations:
Guangzhou No. 8 People’s Hospital, Guangzhou Mental Hospital, and Guangdong
Provincial No. 2 People’s Hospital. Participants in the study were 61 females and 79
males tested the PCP samples and 58 females and 82 males tested the Nortriptyline
samples. They had diverse educational and professional backgrounds and ranged in age
from 21 to >50. Urine samples were prepared at the following concentrations; negative,
+/-75%, +/-50%, +/-25% of the cutoff by spiking drug(s) into drug free-pooled urine
specimens. The concentrations of the samples were confirmed by GC/MS. Each sample
was aliquoted into individual containers and blind-labeled. Each participant was
provided with the package insert, 1 blind labeled samples and a device. The results are
summarized below.
