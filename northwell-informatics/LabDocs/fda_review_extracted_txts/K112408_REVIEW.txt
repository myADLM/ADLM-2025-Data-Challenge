Dilution series for the assay was prepared by mixing human serum with
human serum containing the analyte to several levels of the test. The diluted
samples were tested in triplicate on the Poly-Chem 90 analyzer.
The mean of the measured concentration at each level was compared with the
expected concentration based on the dilution level and the linear fit was
assessed. The linearity claim is based on a percent deviation of < 10% through
the linear range.

d. Analytical specificity:
Serum samples containing the analyte at three levels of the test were spiked
with the potentially interfering substance—hemoglobin, bilirubin, and
triglyceride—to several concentrations. Samples were then run in triplicate
using the Poly-Chem 90 test. The recovery of the test at each concentration of
interferent was calculated by comparing the mean result of testing with no
interferent to the mean result at each level tested. Acceptable recovery at each
level was 90 – 110%.
