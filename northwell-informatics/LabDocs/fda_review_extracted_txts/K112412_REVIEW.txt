H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Refer to indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Beckman Coulter AU5800 Clinical Chemistry Analyzer is an automated chemistry
analyzer that measures analytes such as Glucose, Magnesium, and Potassium in samples,
in combination with appropriate reagents, calibrators, quality control (QC) material and
other accessories. This system is for in vitro diagnostic use only. Applications include
colorimetric, turbidimetric, latex agglutination, homogeneous enzyme immunoassay, and
ion selective electrode.
The Glucose test system is for the quantitative measurement of glucose in human serum,
plasma, urine and cerebrospinal fluid on Beckman Coulter AU analyzers. Glucose
measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of carbohydrate metabolism
disorders including diabetes mellitus, neonatal hypoglycemia, and idiopathic
hypoglycemia, and of pancreatic islet cell carcinoma.
The Potassium test system is for the quantitative measurement of potassium in serum,
plasma, and urine. Measurements obtained by this device are used to monitor electrolyte
balance in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases conditions characterized by low or
high blood potassium levels.
The Magnesium test system is for the quantitative measurement of Magnesium in human
serum, plasma and urine on Beckman Coulter AU analyzers. Magnesium measurements
are used in the diagnosis and treatment of hypomagnesemia (abnormally low plasma
levels of magnesium) and hypermagnesemia (abnormally high plasma levels of
magnesium).

L. Test Principle:
Glucose:
Glucose is phosphorylated by hexokinase (HK) in the presence of adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) and magnesium ions to produce glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) and adenosine
diphosphate (ADP). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P-DH) specifically oxidizes G-
6-P to 6-phosphogluconate with the concurrent reduction of nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide (NAD+) to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced (NADH). The change in
absorbance at 340/380 nm is proportional to the amount of glucose present in the sample.
Magnesium:
The Magnesium procedure utilizes a direct method in which magnesium forms a colored
complex with xylidyl blue in a strongly basic solution, where calcium interference is
eliminated by glycoletherdiamine-N,N,N`,N`-tetraacetic acid (GEDTA).3,4,5 The color
produced is measured bichromatically at 520/800 nm and is proportional to the magnesium
concentration.
Potassium:
The ISE module for K+ employs crown ether membrane electrodes that are specific for K+
ion in the sample. An electrical potential is developed according to the Nernst Equation.
When compared to the Internal Reference Solution, this electrical potential is translated into
voltage and then into the K+ ion concentration of the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
The purpose of the performance studies was to validate that these previously cleared reagents
have the same performance characteristics on the proposed new analyzer (AU5800) as
compared to the previously marketed AU family of chemistry analyzers. The sponsor has
chosen three representative analytes, Potassium, Magnesium, and Glucose using serum as the
representative sample matrix.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Validation of precision on AU5800 were carried out using 2 or 3 levels of serum control
pools, each sample was measured in duplicate in each run, two runs per day over a period
of 20 days. The mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficients of variation (CV) were
determined for each control level and for each assay. The results are summarized in the
below tables:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies were carried out following an internal protocol. Samples were prepared
by diluting a high serum pool with a low sample pool to obtain 11 concentrations across
the measuring range. Linear regression analyses results and claimed reportable ranges are
shown below. Results of the study support the sponsor’s measuring range claims as
established in the predicates (Potassium, k921718; Magnesium, k944407; Glucose,
k944406/k924601).

d. Detection limit:
Limits of Blank (LoB), Limits of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation were
evaluated following CLSI EP17-A guideline.
For LoB determination, saline supplemented with 5% Bovine Serum Albumin was
measured in triplicate using 2 lots of reagents on 2 analyzers over 5 days (N=60).
The LoB is defined as LoB=Mean +1.645 SD
B B
For LoD/LoQ determination, five low serum samples were prepared using low patient
serum samples diluted with the blank (Saline+5% BSA). Each sample is measured in
duplicate using 2 lots of reagents on 2 analyzers over 5 days (N=40). The LoD is
defined as LoD = LoB + (1.645 * STDEV of Low samples). LoQ is defined as the
lowest concentration at which 95% CI of the CV is less or equal to the CAP goal of
Total Error.
The results are summarized in the below Table:
Analyte LoB LoD LoQ CAP TE goal
Magnesium (mg/dL) 0.0 0.1 0.2 25%
Glucose (mg/dL) 0.6 1.3 4.9 12%
See linearity study in section M.1.b of this 510(k) decision summary for ISE methods.
e. Analytical specificity:
To validate the analytical specificity of the reagents on AU5800, the sponsor
determined the level of interference from the substances normally present in serum.
Each of the substances was spiked at different concentrations into pooled patient
serum samples with low and high analyte concentrations. The pooled serum samples are
altered when necessary to give rise to the desired analyte concentration.

* Claim based on Intralipid: a 20% IV fat emulsion used to emulate extremely
turbid samples.
For Potassium there are no specific interference claims. The sponsor declares in the
labeling that “Separate serum from blood cells as soon as possible. Avoid hemolysis
since it can lead to falsely elevated K+ values.” “Certain anticoagulants,
preservatives, drugs, and organophilic compounds may affect electrolyte
determinations. For further information on interfering substances, refer to Young for
a compilation of reported interferences with this test. Visually turbid urine specimens
should be centrifuged prior to analysis. Grossly lipemic samples may show an
inappropriate decrease in, potassium, and results due to volume displacement. Such
samples should be ultracentrifuged and the analysis performed on the infranatant
(middle clear layer).”
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Unscreened patient serum samples were used in the method comparison studies.
When necessary, samples were spiked or diluted to cover the entire measuring
range. For Magnesium, 109 patient samples were studied with 3.7% of the
samples altered. For Glucose, 173 patient samples were studied with 18% of the
