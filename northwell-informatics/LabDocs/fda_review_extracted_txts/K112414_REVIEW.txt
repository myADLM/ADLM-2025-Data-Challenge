L. Test Principle:
The EliA™ ß2-glycoprotein I IgA wells are coated with purified human ß2-glycoprotein I. If
present in the patient's specimen, antibodies bind to their specific antigen. After washing
away non-bound antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgA antibodies (EliA
IgA Conjugate) are added to form an antibody-conjugate complex. After incubation, non-
bound conjugate is washed away and the bound complex is incubated with a Development
Solution. After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the reaction mixture is measured.
The higher the value of fluorescent signal detected by the instrument, the higher the amount
of antibody bound and detected in the sample tested. To evaluate test results, the response
for patient samples is compared directly to the response for calibrators.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To determine the precision of the assays on Phadia® 100 and Phadia® 250
instrument, the variability was assessed on 8 samples. Each sample was run in 4
replicates for 7 days on 3 instruments. One batch was used to determine the precision
of the assays on Phadia® 100 (equal to 84 replicate determinations per sample).
Three batches were used to determine the precision of the assays on Phadia® 250
(equal to 252 replicate determinations per sample). The results are summarized in the
tables below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Eight patient serum samples were diluted in sample diluent and tested with one batch
of EliA™ β2-Glycoprotein I IgA and one set of system reagents on Phadia® 100 or
Phadia® 250. The ratios of observed/expected values were calculated. Depending on
the lot specific EliA™ well factor, the upper limit of the measuring range may vary
between different solid phase batches. The results are summarized below:

Hook Effect/Over the Range Results:
Hook effect was investigated by using a serum sample above the highest calibration
point. A high positive sample was diluted and the dilutions were measured in four
replicates and compared to Cal-80 (80 μg/L about 180 U/mL).
No hook effect was observed for concentrations up to 2877.2 U/mL.
Results above the upper limit of the measuring range are reported as “above”. No
recommendations are made for dilution of samples outside measuring range in the

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The IgA calibrators are traceable (via unbroken chain of calibrations) to the
International Reference Preparation (IRP) 67/86 of Human Serum Immunoglobulins
A, G and M from WHO. New batches of IgA calibrators are compared to a
secondary standard (standardized with the IRP) or the IRP directly and adjusted
accordingly to meet the correct concentration.
The instrument measures specific IgA concentrations in μg/L. By using a conversion
factor given by the lot-specific code of the EliA™ ß2-Glycoprotein I IgA Well, the
results are automatically converted to U/mL.
Stability:
The EliA™ IgA system reagents, EliA™ APS Positive Control and EliA™ Negative
Control are already FDA cleared under k063775, k091845 and k072393, respectively.
Shelf life:
Accelerated study was done to determine the shelf life EliA™ β2-Glycoprotein I IgA
wells and was determined to be 24 months. Real time stability test is ongoing.
On board stability:
The onboard stability EliA™ b2-Glycoprotein I IgA carriers (containing the antigen
coated wells) was tested over 6 weeks using 3 positive and 2 negative samples only
on the Phadia® 250 instrument since for Phadia® 100 the reagents are stored off the
instrument and are only loaded as needed for an assay. The on-board stability for the
Phadia® 250 instrument was determined to be 28 days at 2-8°C.
Open Stability:
Stability of the foilbag containing the EliA™ wells after first opening was tested
using k082759 tTG test and determined to be 9 months at 2-8°C.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) studies were done on both
Phadia® 100 and Phadia® 250. One negative and five blood donors with low
antibody concentration were measured in twelve replicates in each of six runs on six
different days (12 replicates x 6 runs x 6 days = 432 replicates per sample). On
Phadia® 250 the runs are spread on three instruments, with two runs per instrument.
On Phadia® 100 there is one run per instrument. The results are summarized in the
table below:
EliA™ β2-Glycoprotein I IgA (U/mL) LoB LoD
Phadia® 100 0.17 0.25
Phadia® 250 0.14 0.19
It was decided to use a single LoD of 0.3 U/mL for the study.

e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous Interference: A study was run to investigate whether high concentrations
of potentially interfering substances in serum, like bilirubin, hemoglobin, lipemic
factor and rheumatoid factor adversely affect the results of the new devices. Three
serum samples were prediluted in EliA™ Sample Diluent and spiked with the
different interfering substances or their respective blank solutions, and analyzed in
triplicates. A calibration curve was run in duplicate. The runs were repeated twice.
One batch of EliA™ antigen wells and one batch of system reagents were used
throughout the studies.
Samples with concentrations around 6.5, 10 and 47 U/mL were tested. The ratio of
blank/spiked sample was 0.89 – 1.04. No interference was observed up to the
concentrations listed in the table below:
Potential Interfering
Concentration
Compound
Bilirubin F 20.6 mg/dL
Bilirubin C 21.1 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 519 mg/dL
Lipemic factor 1%
Rheumatoid factor 500 IU/mL
Carry-over: A study was carried out on two Phadia® 250 instruments using the test
EliA Celikey IgA, cleared under k062787 (for tTG). A serum sample was diluted
1:100 using the instrument dilution and manual dilution. No carry over effect was
observed.
f. Assay cut-off:
A study was done on 400 apparently healthy blood donor samples from Caucasian
individuals equally distributed by sex and age in order to evaluate expected values for
each of the antigens in the submission in the normal population and to confirm the
defined cut-off. The samples were measured on the Phadia® 250 instrument. The
99th percentile of the 400 samples were calculated and taken into account for setting
of the cut-off. The following values were selected for the cut-off:
EliA™ β2-Glycoprotein I IgA
<7 U/mL Negative
7 - 10 U/mL Equivical
>10 U/mL Positive
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 424 serum samples were collected in a laboratory specialized in APS
diagnosis from patients with APS (n = 124), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE; n
= 100), viral infections (n = 60), mixed connective tissue diseases (MCTD; n = 50),

Varelisa ß2-Glycoprotein I IgA assays. Additional 88 samples with known antibody
status and unconfirmed clinical diagnosis were analyzed with ß2-Glycoprotein I IgA.
The test was run in single determination and values outside the measuring range were
excluded from statistical analyses. The results are summarized in the tables below:

b. Matrix comparison:
Serum, lithium heparin plasma, citrate plasma and EDTA plasma were collected from
the same patients (n = 50) to demonstrate that the plasma results do not deviate from
the corresponding serum results and are within the pre-defined specifications.
Samples were spiked with a serum sample of high antibody titer to cover the
measuring range. Samples were tested in duplicates. Passing & Bablok regression
plots were generated using the first replicate only and by plotting the concentration
observed from the control tube (serum) versus the concentration for each test
collection tube. The corresponding slopes of regression and coefficient determination
are summarized in the tables below:

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Same as assay cut-off
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected value in the normal population is negative. The sponsor states that the
proportion of sera from a normal population found positive by the EliA™ ß2-
Glycoprotein I IgA test is up to 3%. The proportions of positive sera in apparently healthy
and asymptomatic individuals increase with age, and men tend to show higher values.
Expected values may vary depending on the population tested.
