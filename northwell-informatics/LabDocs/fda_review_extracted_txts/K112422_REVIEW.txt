specimens are diluted 1:2 in 1x Specimen Diluent and analyzed. For the semi-
quantitative procedure, specimens are diluted 1:5 in 1x Specimen Diluent
followed by 1:2 serial dilutions. All dilutions are then analyzed as in the
qualitative procedure. Specimens are placed into an appropriate reservoir, such as
a test tube or microtiter plate, and the lateral flow device is then placed into the
reservoir allowing the specimen to come into contact with the test membrane.
The test uses specimen wicking to capture gold-conjugated, anti-cryptococcal
monoclonal antibodies and gold-conjugated control antibodies that are deposited
onto a membrane. If cryptococcal antigen is present in the specimen, it binds to
the gold–conjugated, anti-cryptococcal antibodies. The gold-labeled antibody-
antigen complex will continue to wick up the membrane where it will interact
with the Test Line (T). The Test Line is immobilized anti-cryptococcal
monoclonal antibodies. If the specimen contains cryptococcal antigen, a
sandwich is created with the gold-labeled antibodies and the immobilized
antibodies, causing a visible line to develop at the test line site (T). If proper flow
occurs and the reagents are reactive at the time of use, the wicking of any
specimen, positive or negative, will cause the gold-conjugated control goat IgG
antibody to move to the Control Line (C) which is immobilized bovine anti-goat
IgG antibody. The immobilized anti-goat antibody will bind to the gold-
conjugated goat IgG Control antibody and will cause a visible line to develop (C).
A positive test result will create two lines, while a negative test result will create
one line (Figure 1). If the control line fails to develop a line, then the test is not
valid.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The CrAg Lateral Flow Assay was evaluated for reproducibility and precision by
spiking mock CSF samples with cryptococcal antigen to produce a panel consisting
of a negative sample, a high-negative (C ) sample, a low-positive sample and a
5
moderate-positive sample. This panel was tested twice per day at three sites with a
total of five operators over a five-day period in order to determine both the inter-lab
and the intra-lab reproducibility and precision of the assay. The results of this study
are shown in the tables below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Real time stability testing is on-going. Initial accelerated stability was determined
by testing three lots of kits stored at 25°C (real-time) for 18 months and 37°C
(accelerated) for 12 months. LF specimen Diluent was spiked with cryptococcal
antigen at four concentrations: 1.5, 3.0, 6.0 and 9.0ng/ml. Non-spiked diluent was
used as a negative control. Each sample was tested in triplicate by one operator.
Each spiked sample replicate tested positive and each negative control tested
negative on all lots of the CrAg Lateral Flow kits, stored at both 25°C and 37°C
after storage for six months. At 12 months, all samples passed on all kits stored at
25°C. Kits stored at 37°C were not tested. This initial data in addition to established
stability of currently available lateral flow tests indicate that the CrAg Lateral Flow
test kit is stable at room temperature for 18 months.

Detection Limit/Analytical Cut-off
Analytical sensitivity for the CrAg Lateral Flow Assay was estimated by running
varying concentrations of cryptococcal antigen diluted in LF Specimen Diluent.
The concentration where 50% of the results were positive and 50% of the results
were negative determined our analytical cut-off. The analytical cut-off is
1.25ng/ml.

Analytical specificity:
Analytical specificity for the CrAg Lateral Flow Assay was determined by
evaluating potentially cross-reacting medical conditions unrelated to
cryptococcosis. Specimens were tested in triplicate. Percent positive was
determined for each condition (Table 3).

Additionally, cross-reactivity was assessed by testing crude culture filtrate antigens
at a range of concentrations using the CrAg Lateral Flow Assay at high
concentrations (>0.1 mg/ml), antigens from Paracoccidiodes brasiliensis exhibitied
some cross-reactivity. Antigens from Aspergillus terreus, Aspergillus fumigatus,
Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus flavus did not exhibit cross-reactivity.
The assay was not evaluated for cross-reactivity against the following organisms or
pathologies:
Candida dubliniensis Pneumocystis carinii
Candida tropicalis Trichosporon beigelii
Candida parapsidosis Zygomycetes
Candida krusei Antinuclear antibody +
Candida glabrata Hepatitis A Virus
Cladosporium Hepatitis C Virus
trichoides
Neisseria Staphylococcus spp.
meningitidis
Salmonella typhi Streptococcus pneumonia
Mycobacterium Streptococcus spp.
tuberculosis Diphtheroid
Enterovirus H. influenzae type B
Enterobacteriaceae Herpes simplex viruses
Enterococcus spp. Listeria monocytogenes
Epstein Barr Syneresis fluid condensation
Trichosporon beigelii Staphylococcus aureus
The assay was not evaluated for potential interference related to specimen
pretreatment with 2-mercaptoethanol or with specimens including the following
substances: bloody CSF, cloudy CSF, white blood cells, xanthochromic CSF,
bilirubin, protein, systemic lupus erythmatosus (SLE), sarcoidosis, or
N.memingitides.
The effect of pronase on the CrAg LFA was determined by pronase-treating five
Cryptococcal EIA positive specimens and five Cryptococcal EIA negative
specimens. The samples were analyzed both untreated and pronase-treated. All
treated, positives samples remained positive and all treated, negative samples
remained negative. Therefore, pronase does not affect the CrAg LFA.

that were collected prospectively. Percent agreement positive is 100%. Percent
agreement negative is 88.9%, and overall agreement is 96.5%. Of the 3 discrepant
results, one patient was diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis approximately 5-
6 week after the LFA was performed.
3. Clinical studies:
The CrAg Lateral Flow Assay was compared to the standard reference method for
diagnoses of cryptococcosis (culture and/or India Ink) to evaluate the sensitivity
and specificity of the assay. These studies contained prospective specimens. A
summary of the data collected is included in the following table.
CSF Culture/India Ink
Positive Negative
CrAg LFA Positive 65 1
Assay Negative 0 77
CSF Calculated 95% CI
Sensitivity 100% 94.4% -
100%
Specificity 98.7% 93.1% -
99.8%
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not Applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The frequency of cryptococcosis is dependent on several factors including: patient
population, type of institution, and epidemiology. In this study, 100% (65/65) of
true positives as determined by culture and/or India Ink were detected. The
apparent false positive in the CrAg LFA, compared to culture/India ink, could be
the result of CrAg detection having a higher sensitivity (100%) than culture (83%)
and India ink (84%). Therefore, it is expected to have culture/India Ink
negative/LFA positive results.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
