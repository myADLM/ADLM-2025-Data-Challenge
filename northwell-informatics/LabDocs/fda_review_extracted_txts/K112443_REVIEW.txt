See Indications for use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
Reagents
The ARCHITECT Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) assay is a chemiluminescent
microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) for the quantitative determination of
holotranscobalamin in human serum on the ARCHITECT i System. Active-B12
(Holotranscobalamin) is used as an aid in the diagnosis and treatment of vitamin B12
deficiency.
Calibrators
The ARCHITECT Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) Calibrators are for the calibration
of the ARCHITECT i System when used for the quantitative determination of
holotranscobalamin in human serum.
Controls
The ARCHITECT Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) Controls are for the estimation of
test precision and the detection of systematic analytical deviations of the ARCHITECT i
system (reagents, calibrators, and instrument) when used for the quantitative
determination of holotranscobalamin in human serum.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
The sponsor has the following limitations stated in their labeling:
Specimens from patients who have received preparations of mouse monoclonal
antibodies for diagnosis or therapy may contain human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA).
2

--- Page 3 ---
Specimens containing HAMA may produce anomalous values when tested with assay
kits such as ARCHITECT Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) that employ mouse
monoclonal antibodies.
Heterophilic antibodies in human serum can react with reagent immunoglobulins,
interfering with in vitro immunoassays. Patients routinely exposed to animals or to
animal serum products can be prone to this interference and anomalous results may be
observed. Additional information may be required for diagnosis.
4. Special instrument requirements:
ARCHITECT i 2000 system

L. Test Principle:
The ARCHITECT Active-B12 (Holotransobalamin) assay is a two step immunoassay using
chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology. In the first step, sample
and anti-holotranscobalamin coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined.
Holotranscobalamin present in the sample binds to the anti- holotranscobalamin coated
microparticles. After washing, anti- holotranscobalamin acridinium-labeled conjugate is
added to create a reaction mixture in the second step. Following another wash cycle, pre-
trigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting
chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs). A direct relationship
exists between the amount of holotranscobalamin in the sample and the RLUs detected by the
ARCHITECT i system optics.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed according to the CLSI EP5-A2 guideline. Testing
was conducted using 2 lots of reagents, calibrators, controls, and 2 instruments. Two
levels of controls and 5 levels of human serum samples were assayed in a minimum
of 2 replicates at 2 separate times per day for 20 different days (N=80). Precision
results are shown in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor conducted a linearity study according to the CLSI EP6-A guideline. The
linearity study used a spiked high serum pool (129.5 pmol/L) and a low serum pool
(2.5 pmol/L) to create additional intermediate levels of samples. A total of 11
samples with HoloTC concentration ranging from 2.5 to 129.5 pmol/L were tested in
replicates of 5 on the ARCHITECT i 2000 SR system. The linear regression
generated by plotting the expected values against the observed values was: Y=1.009X
– 1.46, R2=0.99
Based on the results of the linearity study the sponsor claimed that the assay is linear
from 5.0 to 128 pmol/L.
An additional dilution study was performed to support the sponsor’s claim that results
>128 pmol/L can be diluted 1:2 automatically. 5 samples with HoloTC concentrations
ranging from 152 to 254 pmol/L were tested by diluting 1:2 manually and by the
instrument. Results obtained manually were compared to the results obtained
automatically and % differences were <8% for all the samples tested. The sponsor
claimed in the labeling that samples >128 pmol/L can be diluted in a 1:2 ratio by the
instrument.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
There is currently no internationally recognized reference method or reference
material for HoloTC. The ARCHITECT HoloTC calibrators are traceable to an
internal reference material which is traceable to another commercially available
assay. The ARCHITECT Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) Primary Reference
Calibrators were manufactured by gravimetric methods using recombinant
Holotranscobalamin.
Value Assignment:
The ARCHITECT Active B-12 Calibrators are value assigned against the primary
reference calibrators with multiple testing on the ARCHITECT i analyzer at the
following target concentrations:
Calibrator Concentration Calibrator Concentration
(pmol/L) (pmol/L)
CAL A 0.0 CAL D 32.0
CAL B 8.0 CAL E 64.0
CAL C 16.0 CAL F 128.0
The ARCHITECT Active-B12 Controls are prepared using the ARCHITECT Active-
B12 calibrator stock solution and diluent with multiple testing on the ARCHITECT i
analyzer at the following target concentrations:
Control Concentration Concentration
Target Range
(pmol/L) (pmol/L)
Control L 15.0 9.6 – 21.8
Control H 48.0 29.6 – 66.7
Stability:
Stability of the calibrators and controls are determined based on accelerated studies.
Real-time stability studies are on-going. The calibrators and controls have a shelf-life
stability of 12 months and an open-vial stability of 6 months when stored at 2-8oC.
Stability study protocols and acceptance criteria are provided and found to be
adequate.
d. Detection limit:
A detection limits study was performed according to the CLSI guideline EP17-A.
Several blank samples and four low concentrations of HoloTC were used to
determine the LoB and LoD. An additional 6 low samples (range from 1.4 to 5.7
pmol/L) were assayed to determined the LoQ. All samples were tested in 2 runs over
2 days using two lots of reagents and two instruments over 5 days. LoB was

determined to be 0.4 pmol/L. LoD was determined to be 1.90 pmol/L. LoQ was
determined to be 5.0 pmol/L based on an interassay precision of <10%.
The sponsor claimed that the candidate assay has a measuring range of 5.0 to 128
pmol/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was performed according to the CLSI guideline EP7-A. Serum
samples were spiked with potentially interfering substances and tested using the
HoloTC assay in replicates of 5 to 6. Three different concentrations of HoloTC (20,
70, 109 pmol/L) were tested for various concentrations of the interfering substances.
All these tested samples were compared to those obtained from control samples
containing no potential interfering substances. The sponsor’s definition of non-
significant interference is ≤ 10% difference between the tested and the control
samples. The percent difference between the control sample and the sample spiked
with the potential interfering substances was no greater than +/-10% for
concentrations at or below those listed in the following table.
Potential interfering Concentration at which no
substance significant interference
(≤10%) was observed
Bilirubin ≤ 20 mg/dL
Hemoglobin ≤ 200 mg/dL
Triglyceride ≤ 850 mg/dL
Total protein ≤ 10 g/dL
Rheumatoid Factor ≤ 70 IU/mL
In the package insert the manufacturer has stated the following limitations:
“Do not use hemolyzed samples. Hemolyzed samples will cause erroneous results”
“Specimens from patients who have received preparations of mouse monoclonal
antibodies for diagnosis or therapy may contain human anti-mouse antibodies
(HAMA). Specimens containing HAMA may produce anomalous values when tested
with assay kits such as ARCHITECT Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) that employ
mouse monoclonal antibodies.”
“Heterophilic antibodies in human serum can react with reagent immunoglobulins,
interfering with in vitro immunoassays. Patients routinely exposed to animals or to
animal serum products can be prone to this interference and anomalous results may
be observed. Additional information may be required for diagnosis.”
A cross reactivity study was performed to evaluate the potential cross-reactants,

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were performed according to the CLSI EP9-A2 guideline.
125 serum samples with HoloTC ranging from 8.1 to 124.4 pmol/L were analyzed in
singlet on both the candidate device and the predicate device. 20 samples were diluted
to cover the low end measuring range. Results of the method comparison study
yielded the following linear regression correlation:
