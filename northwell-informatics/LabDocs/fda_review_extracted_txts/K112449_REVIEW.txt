K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None were referenced.
L. Test Principle:
QuikResponse One Step Midstream Early Pregnancy Test is a sandwich immunoassay
employing monoclonal (mouse) antibodies specific for hCG and uses chromatographic
principles to separate bound from free color label. The appearance of two lines in the test
window indicates detection of hCG while the appearance of one line in the test window
indicates no detection of hCG. If no line is in the test window the test is invalid. The test is
standardized against the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) 4th International Standard for
Chronic gonadotropin 75/589.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
The identity and concentrations of samples used in all studies were masked to the
operator.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
An inter lot precision evaluation for midstream and dip cup was performed on three
lots by three operators over multiple days, with 15 replicates for each standard tested
(0, 6.25, 25, 50 and 100 mIU/ml hCG). Standards used for spiking contain purified
hCG traceable to the WHO International 4th Standard. Samples with concentrations
of 6.25 mIU/mL and below were negative for 100% of measurements. Samples with
concentrations of 25 mIU/mL and above were positive for 100% of measurements.
See also the detection limit study in Section d below, which included testing
additional near-cutoff concentration samples using multiple test lots.
Another study was conducted to evaluate lay user reproducibility using spiked
samples. In this study samples were assayed by both lay users and professionals.
Negative urine samples were spiked with commercially available purified hCG,
traceable to the WHO International 4th Standard. Three assay lots were tested in this
study and no difference in results was observed between lots. Concentrations of 12
mIU/mL hCG and greater were consistently read as positive (100% agreement), and
negative samples were consistently read as negative. A total of 50 lay users
participated in the study, each testing one spiked sample (as well as their own urine
sample).
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. This is a qualitative device.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
QuikResponse One Step Midstream Early Pregnancy Test is traceable to the
manufacturer’s quantitative method, which is calibrated with the World Health
Organization (W.H.O.) 4th International Standard for Chronic Gonadotropin 75/589.
Stability
Real-time and accelerated stability testing showed that the QuikResponse One Step
Midstream Early Pregnancy Test device is stable and detection limit was unchanged
for 24 months when stored at 36-86°F. Protocol and acceptance criteria were
reviewed and found acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
To determine the detection limit, studies were performed by multiple operators using
both the midstream and dip-cup methods. Negative human urine samples were spiked
with commercially available purified hCG. Concentrations (shown in the table
below) are traceable to the WHO International 4th Standard. Results are expressed as
the number of positive samples to the total number of samples analyzed. See below:

limit section, 1.b.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:

In addition to the testing by professionals, 109 lay users tested their own urine
samples using the midstream method, following only the proposed package insert
instructions. There was 100% agreement between the QuikResponse One Step
Midstream Early Pregnancy Test results by lay users and professional results. The
results were also in agreement with predicate device results. Questionnaire results
were included in the 510(k) to demonstrate that lay users (of various educational
backgrounds) felt the test was easy to perform.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Detection of hCG in early Pregnancy Clinical Samples:
A total of 1020 urine samples were collected from 102 individual women. Selection
criteria for subjects in this study were women between the ages of 18-39 attempting
to become pregnant. Women were to keep a documented record of three menstrual
cycles prior to the collection of samples. Samples were collected from women whose
menstrual cycle lengths were within 25-31 days and whose start days were within +/-
3 days from the median day over three months. Samples were collected from each
study subject starting 10 days before and ending 2 days after the expected menstrual
period. The day of the expected period was estimated based on the average number
of menstrual cycle days reported for the previous 3 cycles. Women with negative
results were followed up to confirm that they were not pregnant in that cycle.
Samples were masked and randomized prior to testing. Testing was performed on 3
device lots. No differences were observed between lots. Results are summarized in
the table below.

b. Clinical specificity:
To demonstrate the incidence of false positive results in older women who may have
higher levels of pituitary hCG, samples were collected from 104 pre- menopausal
women (estimated as age 17-39), 103 peri-menopausal women (estimated as age 41-
55) and 107 menopausal women (age >55) in whom pregnancy was not suspected.
No pre-selection or pre-screening of hCG levels was performed prior to testing with
this device. No positive results were observed in this study. The product labeling
includes a statement that “If you are not sure of the result, you may want to re-test your
urine in the week after your missed period. If you are still unsure, you should consult
your doctor”.
