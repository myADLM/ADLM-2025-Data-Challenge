I. Device Description:
The Quidel Molecular hMPV Assay detects hMPV viral nucleic acids that have been
extracted from a patient sample using the NucliSENS® easyMAG® automated
extraction platform. A multiplex RT-PCR reaction is carried out under optimized
conditions in a single tube generating amplicons for each of the target viruses present
in the sample. This reaction is performed utilizing the Applied Biosystems® 7500
Fast Dx platform. Identification of hMPV occurs by the use of target specific primers
and a fluorescent-labeled probe that hybridizes to a highly conserved region in the
RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene of hMPV.
The following is a summary of the procedure:
2

--- Page 3 ---
1. Sample Collection: Obtain Nasal swab and nasopharyngeal swab specimens
using standard techniques from symptomatic patients. These specimens are
transported, stored, and processed according to established laboratory procedures.
2. Nucleic Acid Extraction: Extract Nucleic Acids from the specimens with the
NucliSENS easyMAG System following the manufacturer’s instructions and
using the appropriate reagents. Prior to the extraction procedure add 20 µL of the
Process Control (PRC) to each 180 µL aliquot of specimen. The PRC serves to
monitor inhibitors in the extracted specimen, assures that adequate amplification
has taken place and confirms that the nucleic acid extraction was sufficient.
3. Rehydration of Master Mix: Rehydrate the lyophilized Master Mix using the
Rehydration Solution. The Master Mix contains oligonucleotide primers,
fluorophore and quencher-labeled probes targeting highly conserved regions of
hMPV as well as the PRC sequence. The primers are complementary to highly
specific and conserved regions in the genome of these viruses. The probes are
dual labeled with a reporter dye attached to the 5’ end and a quencher attached to
the 3’ end.
4. Nucleic Acid Amplification and Detection: Add 15 µL of the rehydrated Master
Mix to each reaction tube or plate well. 5µL of extracted nucleic acids (specimen
with PRC) is then added to the plate well. Place the plate into the ABI 7500
FastDx. Once the plate is added to the instrument, the assay protocol is initiated.
This protocol initiates reverse transcription of the RNA targets generating
complementary DNA, and the subsequent amplification of the target sequences
occurs. The Quidel Molecular hMPV assay is based on TaqMan® chemistry, and
uses an enzyme with reverse transcriptase, DNA polymerase, and 5’-3’
exonuclease activities. During DNA amplification, this enzyme cleaves the probe
bound to the complementary DNA sequence, separating the quencher dye from
the reporter dye. This step generates an increase in fluorescent signal upon
excitation by a light source of the appropriate wavelength. With each cycle,
additional dye molecules are separated from their quenchers resulting in
additional signal. If sufficient fluorescence is achieved by 35 cycles during the
data collection stage of amplification, the sample is reported as positive for the
detected target sequences.

L. Test Principle:
The real-time PCR process simultaneously amplifies and detects nucleic acid targets
in a single closed-tube reaction. Detection of hMPV and the Process Control (PRC) is
based on three processes: nucleic acid isolation, reverse transcription, and real time
PCR amplification/detection. Human respiratory specimens (nasal swabs and
nasopharyngeal swabs) from symptomatic patients are processed initially to isolate
and purify viral nucleic acid from the cellular specimen matrix. After initial reverse
transcription of RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA), amplification proceeds
during which the probe anneals specifically to a region of the template between the
forward and reverse primers. As primer extension and amplification occurs, the
exonuclease activity of the Taq polymerase cleaves the probe separating the reporter
dye away from the quencher. This generates an increase in fluorescent signal upon
excitation from a light source of appropriate wavelength. With each cycle, additional
reporter dye molecules are cleaved from their respective probes, yielding increased
fluorescence signal. The amount of fluorescence at any given cycle is dependent on
the amount of PCR product (amplicons) present at that time. Fluorescent intensity is
monitored at each PCR cycle by fluorescent detection modules within the real-time
instrument.

The reproducibility of the Quidel Molecular hMPV assay was evaluated at three
laboratory sites. The reproducibility panel and controls were tested at each site by
two operators for five days in triplicate (2 operators X 5 days X triplicate testing
X 3 sites = 90 results per sample). The panels and controls were extracted using
the bioMérieux easyMAG system and tested on the ABI 7500Fast Dx.
The reproducibility panel was composed of four simulated samples made by
diluting hMPV-A1 into negative nasal matrix. The panel included a medium
positive (5x LoD) hMPV sample (2.65E+02 TCID /mL), a low positive (2x

The impact of using fresh clinical samples versus frozen clinical specimens on
the Quidel Molecular hMPV assay ability to detect hMPV was evaluated.
Briefly, 220 clinical specimens were aliquoted and processed fresh (< 72-
hours post collection) and frozen (a minimum of 7-days storage at -70°C).
Twelve (12) samples were discarded from analysis due to invalid results. The
invalid rate of the fresh samples was 7/220 (3%) and the invalid rate of the
frozen samples was 11/220 (5%). Six of the invalids overlapped between
fresh and frozen. There were two hMPV positive samples that did not overlap

Kit Stability
An evaluation of real-time stability using 3 lots of the Quidel Molecular
hMPV kits at 2°C - 8°C and room temperature was done over the course of 73
days, with additional real time results to be collected for 460 days (15
months). The following information summarizes the acceptance criteria;
furthermore these criteria will also be used throughout the stability study:
1. Quidel Molecular hMPV kit stability demonstrates 15 months real time
stability at 2°C to 8°C.
2. Quidel Molecular hMPV kit stability demonstrates 15 months equivalent
accelerated stability at 2°C to 8°C.
3. Quidel Molecular hMPV kit stability demonstrates 15 months real time
stability at room temperature. (RT)
4. hMPV tests positive at each time point tested, 3x, 100x and 1000x LoD
(≥ 5 cycles and <35 cycles for 7500 Dx).
5. The NTCs test negative at each time point tested (undetermined).
No significant failure of the assay was detected at any of the experimental
conditions to date (real time stability data collected to day 73) when compared
to the t=0 time point. This was calculated by assuming a maximum CV% of
5% and calculating the 95% upper confidence limit (UCL) for each t=0
sample. Also, all NTCs tested negative at each time point tested.
Master Mix Stability after Rehydration
An evaluation of master mix stability after rehydration was carried out over a
5 day period using various storage conditions, including -20°C, 4°C, and 25°C

(room temperature). Mock specimens at 100X, 10X, and 3X LoD were used
in the analysis. Results show that the rehydrated master mix can be stored for
up to 24-hours at room temperature without any significant affect on the Ct
values for the hMPV or the PRC. The data demonstrates that for times longer
than 24-hours the rehydrated master mix can be stored at 4°C or -20°C for up
to 5 days.
Extracted Specimen Stability
An evaluation of the stability of extracted specimens was carried out using the
easyMAG extraction system followed by real-time RT-PCR analysis. Parallel
aliquots of samples that were hMPV A (3X LoD) and hMPV B (3X LoD)
positive were used for this study. Samples were analyzed at time 0
(immediately after extraction), after 2h at room temperature, after 8h at 2-8°C,
after 1 month at -20°C, and after 1 month at -20°C with up to three freeze
thaw cycles. There was no indication of degradation of the extracted
specimen in the conditions tested.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) of the Quidel Molecular hMPV assay on the ABI
7500 Fast Dx instrument was determined using limiting dilutions of re-
cultured and re-titered viral stocks. The following isolates were used for the
analysis and represent both lineages and subtypes: A1 Italy #6621 MK/2
LLCMK2/25, A2 Vanderbilt TN 94-49, B1 Italy #4702 LLCMK2/18, and B2
Italy #3817 LLCMK2/30.
Each of the viral stocks were spiked in negative nasal matrix and serially
diluted. The replicate dilutions were extracted using the NucliSENS
easyMAG. In total there were 21 extraction runs per dilution level tested to
establish the LoD. Each extraction was analyzed on the ABI 7500 Fast Dx
and the LoD was established as the lowest concentration that yielded positive
result rate of ≥95%. The LoD established for hMPV A1, A2, B1, and B2 are
summarized below.

e. Analytical specificity (Cross-reactivity):
The analytical specificity of the Quidel Molecular hMPV assay was evaluated
by testing a panel consisting of 26 viruses, 24 bacteria, and one yeast strain
that represent common respiratory pathogens or flora commonly present in
nasopharynx. The bacteria and yeast were tested at concentrations of 105 to
1010 CFU/mL with the actual test concentration indicated for each organism in
the following table. Viruses were tested at concentrations of 103 to 106
TCID /mL. All samples were extracted using the NucliSENS easyMAG
50
instrument and tested in triplicate. The results are presented below. Briefly,
the analytical specificity of the Quidel Molecular hMPV assay was 100% with
no cross reactivity observed with the tested organisms.

g. Assay cut-off:
The “cutoff value” represents the fluorescent intensity signal (reported in
Relative Fluorescent Units) at which a “positive” reaction reaches a relative
fluorescent intensity above the background or baseline of a “negative”
reaction. If a sample exceeds the threshold in a detection channel during PCR,
the sample is considered positive for that channel. If the sample does not
exceed the threshold for a detection channel by the last PCR cycle, the sample
is considered negative for that channel.
The cut-off for the Quidel Molecular hMPV Assay was determined and
confirmed through a phased approach. The preliminary threshold was
established using data obtained from the LoD studies and from the analysis of
a set of clinical specimens. Data from the analysis of multiple replicates near
the LoD of the assay were used to establish the threshold such that sensitivity
was maximized. Similarly, the latest Ct value form the LoD data and those
observed in the analysis of the set of clinical specimens were used the set the
cut-off. Using the parameters summarized in the table below, a verification
study was done to confirm the threshold and cut-off values.

Instrument
Confirmed Threshold
Analyte Confirmed Ct Cut-Off*
(RFU)
hMPV A1 5.4e4 35
hMPV B1 5.4e4 35
*These values reflect subtraction of the first 10 cycles. Fluorescence is
monitored after the first 10 cycles during the data collection stage
of amplification.
Results from the comparison to an FDA-cleared molecular device to validate
the proposed cut-off and threshold are:
· The Quidel Molecular hMPV assay showed 100% (7/7) PPA with an FDA
cleared molecular comparator device.
· The Quidel Molecular hMPV assay showed 100% (58/58) NPA with an
FDA cleared molecular comparator device.
These results demonstrated that the preliminary threshold and Ct cut-off
settings determined have been confirmed and effective for maximizing

g. Comparison of transport media:
Analytical performance of the Quidel Molecular hMPV assay was evaluated
with five different transport media. A stock of hMPV-B1 was used to
evaluate performance across the different transport media at a level close to
the LoD (3X). Briefly, dilutions of hMPV-B1 were made and each of the
dilutions was extracted in triplicate. Each extraction was then tested in
duplicate on the ABI 7500 Fast Dx using the Quidel Molecular hMPV
standard protocol. No differences between the tested transport media were
observed and the results are summarized below.

h. Carry-over Contamination Analysis:
An evaluation of potential carry–over contamination during extraction and/or
amplification was carried out. High negative and positive samples were run in
alternating series to evaluate performance of the device and to monitor for
potential carry-over contamination. The evaluation included alternating
extractions high and low concentration of virus on the indicated platform.
During the amplification stage the plate was setup in a checkerboard approach
locating negative and positive samples in adjoining wells. No cross
contamination was observed in the evaluation of the Quidel Molecular hMPV
kit.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Prospective Clinical Studies:
Performance characteristics of the Quidel Molecular hMPV assay was established
in a prospective study during the 2010-2011 respiratory virus season (January to
March 2011). A total of 1116 specimens were evaluated in this study (742-fresh,
374-frozen). Of the fresh specimens, 399 specimens were nasal swabs, and 343
were nasopharyngeal swabs. The fresh specimens were collected for routine
respiratory virus testing at thirteen sites across the United States. The frozen
specimens were collected and tested at two geographically distinct locations and
were comprised of 374 nasopharyngeal swabs.
The 1116 specimens were tested by both the subject and a FDA cleared molecular
comparator device for human metapneumovirus RNA. Sixteen of these
specimens were invalid on initial testing with the subject device (1.4%). Re-
testing of the specimens according to the Interpretation algorithm described above
also yielded invalid results. Thirty-six specimens were invalid on initial and
repeat testing (as per the device's package insert) on the comparator device
(3.2%). Eight specimens were invalid in both devices, therefore, a total of 44
invalid specimens were removed from additional analysis. The remaining 1072
specimens were used in the 2x2 analysis of clinical performance.
The evaluation of the Quidel Molecular hMPV Assay was conducted at two
external laboratory sites and one internal site. Each site used the ABI 7500Fast
Dx platform for amplification/detection and the bioMerieux easyMAG for nucleic
15

acid extraction. Each site included in the study was capable of performing highly
complex laboratory tests.
Each specimen included in the study had the following testing performed.
Prospective testing performed at the trial sites was done within 72-hours post-
collection using the Quidel Molecular hMPV Assay with the bioMerieux
easyMAG for nucleic acid extraction. Archival reference testing performed at a
central testing location using samples that have been frozen within 72-hours post-
collection and stored at -70°C. The frozen specimens were analyzed with a FDA
cleared molecular device for hMPV according to the instructions for use provided
at a central location and were not preselected based on previous results and are
representative of an all-comers based study.
For inclusion in the study the specimens meet the following criteria:
· Approximately 1-mL of leftover or waste specimens in viral transport
media that were submitted for respiratory virus culture.
· Specimens were tested in a prospective manner.
· Acceptable specimen types used for the evaluation: nasal swab,
nasopharyngeal swab
· Specimens transported, received and stored at 2° to 8°C for up to 72 hours.
· No gender restrictions.
· No age restrictions.
· No results from the investigational device were made available to the
patient’s physician.
· All patient identifiers were removed and replaced with study identifiers
prior to inclusion in the study.
Exclusion of specimens from the study was based on the following criteria:
· There were no patient exclusion criteria since the specimens were from
patients that the treating physician has deemed qualified for diagnostic
testing.
· Inadequate specimen volume to perform the three devices as required.
· Specimen inadequately stored or shipped.
· Minimal patient information consisting of age or and gender was
inadequate
· Samples not received within 72 hours of collection, or stored at >8°C.
The following table summarizes the gender and age distribution of all patients
enrolled in the evaluation.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
In the Quidel Molecular hMPV Assay clinical studies, a total of 1100 (1.4%) eligible
nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and nasal swabs (NS) specimens were tested from 15
clinical laboratories across the United States during the in the winter of 2011 (January
2011 – March 2011). Originally 1116 specimens were available for the study, sixteen
of these specimens were invalid on initial testing with the subject device, resulting in
1100 specimens. The number and percentage of the hMPV RNA positive cases by
the Quidel Molecular hMPV Assay, calculated by age group, are presented in the
