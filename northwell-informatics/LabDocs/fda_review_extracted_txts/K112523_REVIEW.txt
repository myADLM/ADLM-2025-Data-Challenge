L. Test Principle:
The assay is a solid-phase, two-step, chemiluminiscent immunoassay that uses liquid
phase kinetics in a bead format. The allergens are covalently bound to a soluble
polymer/co-polymer matrix, which is labeled with a ligand. The assay specific
antibody is labeled with alkaline phosphatase. The use of an amino acid co-polymer
amplifies the amount of allergen that the matrix can support. The chemiluminiscent
detection system is a phosphatase ester of stabilized dioxatane. Cleavage of the
phosphate ester by alkaline phosphatase results in the decomposition of dioxatane and
the emission of photons, which are quantified by a luminometer.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility of the assay was assessed by testing three positive samples
and one negative control sample of each allergen: nBet v 1 (A89 Birch Tree),
nOle e 1 (A482 Olive Tree), nArt v 1 (A753 Mugwort weed), Cat Serum
Albumin (E220), and Dog Serum Albumin (E221) in duplicate twice a day for
20 different days (n = 80).
The sponsor’s acceptance criterion for the negative sample was the average
dose level must be <0.10 kU/L; all negative sample mean results were within
the acceptance criterion. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion for the positive
samples was ≤15% CV for both within-run and total precision. Three allergen
lots were tested for each allergen; representative data from one lot is shown
below for the positive samples. The intra-assay and inter-assay %CV ranges
were from 2.21% to 6.23 % and 3.75% to 9.17%, respectively (see tables
below).

were within the sponsor’s claimed acceptable criterion of ≤ 20% variability.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies: For each allergen, two clinical samples were diluted in 2-
fold serial dilutions to 5 levels. The undiluted (neat) and diluted samples were
tested with the specific allergen to demonstrate linearity at concentrations
within the assay limits. Regression statistics for each allergen comparing the
observed results to expected results are presented below:

The IMMULITE 2000 Calibrator assay range: 0.1 - 100 kU/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The calibrators and controls are traceable to the WHO 2nd IRP
75/502 reference standard for human IgE.
Stability:
Allergen stability: Accelerated allergen stability testing (15-25ºC for 57 days
at 1, 4, 8, 15, 30, and 60 day intervals; other assay kit components stored at
recommended temperature 2-8ºC). Testing was performed on two positive
samples and one negative sample on three lots. The accelerated study supports
a two year shelf-life stability claim.
On-board/ open stability:
Testing was performed on two positive samples and one negative sample for
91 days (at 1, 7, 14, 21, 29, 48, 60, 75 and 91 day intervals) for each
individual specific allergens. Stability studies supports the 90 day stability
claim.
Adjustment interval (calibration curve) stability: Testing was performed at
days 1 and 14 to validate the 2-week adjustment interval. The calibration
curve stability study supports the 2-week stability claim.
Sample stability: Stress conditions representing the storage claims were set up
at 3 and 7 days at 2-8ºC and 6 months at -20ºC. No significant variation to the
reference samples that were run at day 0 was observed. The sample stability
study supports the 7 days at 2-8ºC and 6 months at -20ºC stability claims.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB): Three runs assaying the blank sample (zero calibrator)

were performed to estimate the LoB. One instrument was used to collect a
total of 240 data points using 3 allergen lots over 20 days, at 2 runs per day, 2
replicates per run. The LoB was calculated using the formula LoB = (Mean +
1.65*SD). The Limit of Blank (highest value expected for a sample with no
analyte), determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A, is 0.03kU/L.
Limit of Detection (LoD):
A low level sample (0.35 – 0.69kU/L, Class I) was tested using 3 allergen lots
over 20 days, at 2 runs per day, 2 replicates per run to estimate the LoD. Two
instruments were used to collect a total of 480 data points. The LoD was
calculated using the LoD = LoBMax + (1.65*SDLoD). Limit of Detection
(lowest detectable concentration), determined in accordance with CLSI EP-
17-A is 0.10kU/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Inhibition studies: Specificity of each allergen was verified through
competitive inhibition testing using a single serum sample or a serum pool. A
negative sample was used to measure the background response.
To initiate the inhibition experiment, 70 µL of undiluted and 3-4 levels of 5-
fold serially diluted inhibitor extract were mixed with 250 µL of sample or
pool to achieve final inhibitor concentrations of 218.75, 43.75, 8.75, 1.75,
0.35, 0.08, 0.07, 0.02, 0.014 μg/mL inhibitor. This mixture was incubated at
room temperature (15-28ºC) for 1 hour allowing the immunological reaction
to occur. Each sample mixture containing the inhibitor extract and the
appropriate controls were assayed with 1 lot of each allergen. The percent (%)
inhibition was calculated according to the following formula:
( Response of pos. control – sample response with inhibitor extra ct)
(pos. sample – neg. sample) X 100
(Response of pos. control )
(pos. sample – neg. sample)
The inhibition plots demonstrate that the allergens tested are inhibited by the
relevant inhibitor extract in a concentration dependent fashion. Also, the target
% inhibition of 50% for the highest inhibitor concentration tested was met.
These results indicate specificity of nBet v 1 (A89 Birch Tree), nOle e 1
(A482 Olive Tree), nArt v 1 (A753 Mugwort weed), Cat Serum Albumin
(E220), and Dog Serum Albumin (E221) allergens.
Additional inhibition studies were conducted to show that the specific
allergens are not cross-reacting to unrelated allergens. Testing was performed
using one positive sample with three unrelated allergen extracts at 1 mg/mL.
A negative sample was used to measure the background response. Results on
the positive sample for the following specific allergens were below 11.92%:
nBet v 1 (A89 Birch Tree), nOle e 1 (A482 Olive Tree), nArt v 1 (A753
Mugwort weed), Cat Serum Albumin (E220), and Dog Serum Albumin
(E221).

Clinical performance of the IMMULITE® 2000 3gAllergy Specific IgE assay
for nBet v 1 (A89 Birch Tree), nOle e 1 (A482 Olive Tree), nArt v 1 (A753
Mugwort weed), Cat Serum Albumin (E220), and Dog Serum Albumin
(E221) allergens was demonstrated by testing samples from non-atopic and
atopic individuals. Atopic patients were selected from patients who had
clinical documentation of allergy to specific allergen(s) or allergen group of
interest and/or positive skin prick/ scratch test to specific allergen(s) of
interest evaluated as 2+ or greater. Information on the skin test allergen
extracts (crude or purified) was not documented. Non-atopic patients were
clinically known non-allergenic or total IgE <130 ng/mL or 54 IU/mL (2.4 ng
= 1 IU). Testing was performed on 143samples for nBet v 1 (A89 Birch Tree),
139 samples for nOle e 1 (A482 Olive Tree), 130 samples for nArt v 1 (A753
Mugwort weed), 143 samples for Cat Serum Albumin (E220), 138 samples

Refer to the Hoffman’s ’Standard’ and ‘Extended Standard’ classification system
utilizing Class 0 to Class IV cut-offs (see Tables I and II below).
Table-I: The Standard classification system utilizes the following class cutoffs:
Class kU/L Reactivity for Individual/
Component Allergen(s)
< 0.10 Absent or ND†
0*
0.10 – 0.34 Very Low
I 0.35 – 0.69 Low
II 0.70 – 3.49 Moderate
III 3.50 – 17.49 High
IV 17.5 – 52.49
V 52.5 – 99.99 Very High
VI ³ 100
* Class 0 in the standard system signifies: not detectable by second-
generation assays.
† ND: not detectable by IMMULITE 2000 3gAllergy.
