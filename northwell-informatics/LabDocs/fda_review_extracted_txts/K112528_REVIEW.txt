5 is standardized against ID-GC/MS (isotope dilution gas chromatography
mass spectrometry).
Value assignment testing is conducted and must pass pre-defined acceptance
criteria. Specifically, each of the five CalCheck levels is value assigned using
a minimum of three Elecsys 2010/cobas e411 analyzers and MODULAR
ANALYTICS E170/cobas e 601 analyzers. Each sample is tested in duplicate
for total of at least 6 measurements (duplicate runs on at least 3 analyzers).
The target value for each CalCheck is the median value obtained over at least
6 determinations of the respective CalCheck. The assigned range is calculated
as ±20% of the assigned value for levels 2-5. The % CV is 8% for levels 2-5,
while Level 1 is free of the analyte. The label states that each laboratory
should establish appropriate acceptance criteria when using this product for its
intended use.
To ensure the values assigned using the master platform are transferrable and
valid for the other instrument platforms, each Elecsys T4 CalCheck 5 level is
assayed once a day on 8 Elecsys 2010 / cobas e 411 and 8 MODULAR
ANALYTICS E170/cobas e 601/cobas e 602 analyzers. The median value for
the 8 analyses must be within 10% of the master platform assigned value
(10% for between analyzer platform tolerances). After this acceptance
criterion is met, the assigned values from the master platform are deemed
valid for the Elecsys 2010 / cobas e 411 and MODULAR ANALYTICS
E170/cobas e 601/cobas e 602 immunoassay analyzers.
Stability
Shelf-life stability:
The accelerated stability testing performed at 35°C supports an initial shelf-life
claim of 36 months at 2-8°C. Real-time testing at 2-8°C is on-going to support a
claim of 36 months.
Open-vial stability after reconstitution:
Real time testing was performed and the data support the package insert claim
that reconstituted Elecsys T4 CalCheck 5 is stable up to 4 hours at 20-25°C.
