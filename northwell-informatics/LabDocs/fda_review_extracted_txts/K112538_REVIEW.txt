ACE and ACE Alera Clinical Chemistry Systems
I. Device Description:
ACE Cholesterol Reagent
The ACE Cholesterol Reagent, used with the ACE and ACE Alera Clinical Chemistry
System, is intended for quantitative in vitro diagnostic determination of cholesterol
concentration in serum and lithium heparin plasma. It is based on a photometric test using a
coupled enzymatic reaction (cholesterol esterase, cholesterol oxidase and peroxidase), which
produces color via the Trinder reaction. It is composed of one reagent bottle, which is placed
in the reagent compartment of the ACE or ACE Alera. It is intended for in vitro diagnostic
use.
ACE HDL-C Reagent
The ACE HDL-C Reagent, used with the ACE and ACE Alera Clinical Chemistry System, is
intended for quantitative in vitro diagnostic determination of high density lipoprotein
cholesterol concentration in serum and lithium heparin plasma. It is based on a photometric
test measuring the amount of HDL present utilizing two reagents, the second of which
contains a unique detergent. This detergent solubilizes only the HDL lipoprotein particles,
thus releasing HDL cholesterol to react with the cholesterol esterase and cholesterol oxidase,
in the presence of a chromogen to produce color in the reaction cuvette. The detergent also
inhibits the reaction of the cholesterol enzymes with LDL and VLDL lipoproteins and
chylomicrons by adsorbing to their surfaces. It is composed of two reagent bottles, which are
placed in the reagent compartment of the ACE or ACE Alera. It is intended for in vitro
diagnostic use.
ACE LDL-C Reagent
The ACE LDL-C Reagent, used with the ACE and ACE Alera Clinical Chemistry System, is
intended for quantitative in vitro diagnostic determination of low density lipoprotein
cholesterol concentration in serum and lithium heparin plasma. It is based on a photometric
test measuring the amount of LDL present after other non-LDL cholesterol is solubilized by a
detergent and then consumed by cholesterol esterase and cholesterol oxidase in a noncolor
forming reaction. LDL is then solubilized by a second detergent in the presence of a
chromogenic peroxidase substrate to form a purple-red color. It is composed of two reagent
bottles, which are placed in the reagent compartment of the ACE or ACE Alera. It is intended
for in vitro diagnostic use.
ACE Triglycerides Reagent
The ACE Triglycerides Reagent, used with the ACE and ACE Alera Clinical Chemistry
System, is intended for quantitative in vitro diagnostic determination of triglycerides
concentration in serum and lithium heparin plasma. It is based on a photometric test using a
coupled enzymatic reaction (lipase, glycerol kinase, glycerol phosphate oxidase and
peroxidase), which produces color via the Trinder reaction. It is composed of one reagent
bottle, which is placed in the reagent compartment of the ACE or ACE Alera. It is intended
for in vitro diagnostic use.

Cholesterol esters in serum are completely hydrolyzed by cholesterol esterase to free
cholesterol and free fatty acids. The cholesterol liberated by the esterase, plus any
endogenous free cholesterol, are both oxidized by cholesterol oxidase to yield hydrogen
peroxide (H O ). The hydrogen peroxide then acts to oxidatively couple p-hydroxybenzoic
2 2
acid and 4-aminoantipyrine (AAP) in a reaction catalyzed by peroxidase, producing a red
colored quinoneimine complex which absorbs strongly at 505 nm.

The HDL-C Assay utilizes two reagents, the second containing a unique detergent. This
detergent solubilizes only the HDL lipoprotein particles, thus releasing HDL cholesterol to
react with the cholesterol esterase and cholesterol oxidase, in the presence of a chromogen to
produce color. The detergent also inhibits the reaction of the cholesterol enzymes with LDL,
VLDL and chylomicron lipoproteins by adsorbing to their surfaces. The amount of
chromogen formed, determined by measuring the increase in absorbance bichromatically at
592/692 nm, is directly proportional to the HDL cholesterol concentration in the sample.

Detergent 1 solubilizes non-LDL lipoprotein particles (HDL, VLDL and chylomicrons) and
releases cholesterol. The cholesterol is consumed by cholesterol esterase and cholesterol
oxidase in a non-color forming reaction. In a second reaction, detergent 2 solublizes the
remaining LDL particles and forms peroxide, via the enzymes cholesterol esterase and
cholesterol oxidase. The peroxide, in the presence of peroxidase and two peroxidase
substrates, 4-aminoantipyrine and DSBmT, results in a purple-red color.

ACE Triglycerides Reagent
The ACE Triglycerides Reagent is composed of a single reagent bottle.
The reagent contains:
Component Quantity
ACE Triglycerides Reagent
4-Aminoantipyrine (AAP) 0.4 mmol/L
Adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) 2.6 mmol/L
p-Chlorophenol 3.0 mmol/L

(Microorganism)
Lipase (Pseudomonas) >1000 U/L
Peroxidase (Horseradish) >540 U/L
Glycerol kinase (Cellulomonas) >400 U/L
Buffer, Stabilizers and Preservatives
Triglycerides in serum are hydrolyzed by lipase to form glycerol and free fatty acids. In the
presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and glycerol kinase (GK), the glycerol is
converted to glycerol-1-phosphate (G-1-P) and the ATP to adenosine diphosphate (ADP).
Glycerol-1-phosphate is oxidized by glycerol phosphate oxidase (GPO) to yield hydrogen
peroxide (H O ). The hydrogen peroxide then acts to oxidatively couple p-chlorophenol and
2 2
4-aminoantipyrine (AAP) in a reaction catalyzed by peroxidase, producing a red colored
quinoneimine complex which absorbs strongly at 505 nm.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed on one lot of the ACE Cholesterol, HDL, LDL, and
Triglyceride Reagents using three serum and three lithium heparin plasma samples
on one ACE and one ACE Alera Clinical Chemistry Systems. The low level samples
were from a normal human patient, the high levels samples were spiked with
analyte, and the mid-level samples were prepared by mixing the high and low level
samples. The samples were run two times per run, with two runs being performed
per day, with each run consisting of each sample being run on the ACE and the ACE
Alera Clinical Chemistry Systems (total n for each sample is 20). This was done for
three days (HDL) or five days (Cholesterol, LDL, Triglycerides). The results are
presented below.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed using serum samples at Physician Office
Laboratories. Operators assayed serum samples on the ACE and the ACE Alera
Clinical Chemistry Systems. The following linear regression data was obtained by
comparing samples run in house to the POL sites using Deming analysis:

b. Matrix comparison:
Matrix comparison was done by using Method Comparison and Bias Estimation
Using Patient Samples; Approved Guideline - Second Edition (2002), CLSI EP9-A2

lithium heparin plasma tubes drawn at hospital sites. Some of the samples were
spiked with a solution containing a high level of analyte obtained from commercial
sources.
