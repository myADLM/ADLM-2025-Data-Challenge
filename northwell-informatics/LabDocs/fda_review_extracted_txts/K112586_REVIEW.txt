susceptibility of bacteria to Ceftaroline. The concentration of 30μg has been
shown to be active in vitro against most strains of microorganisms listed below,
as described in the FDA approved drug insert for this antimicrobial agent

Staphylococcus aureus Microorganisms
(including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Escherichia coli
isolates) Klebsiella pneumoniae
Streptococcus pyogenes Klebsiella oxytoca
Streptococcus agalactiae Haemophilus influenzae
Streptococcus pneumoniae

4. Special instrument requirements:
None
I. Device Description:
Ceftaroline 30μg BBL™ Sensi-Disc™ is prepared by impregnating high quality
paper with accurately determined amounts of Ceftaroline supplied by the drug
manufacturer. Each Ceftaroline disk is clearly marked on both sides with the
agent and drug content. Ceftaroline cartridges each contain 50 impregnated disks
that are packed as either a single cartridge in a single box, or in a package
containing ten cartridges. Ceftaroline disks are used for semi-quantitative in vitro
susceptibility evaluations by the agar diffusion test method.

approved package insert, developed during clinical trial studies, was used for
Interpretive Criteria and Quality Control (QC) Expected Ranges.
L. Test Principle:
Disks containing a wide variety of antimicrobial agents are applied to the surface of
Mueller Hinton Agar plates [or Haemophilus Test Medium Agar for Haemophilus
influenzae or Mueller Hinton Agar with 5% Sheep Blood for Streptococcus species]
inoculated with pure cultures of clinical isolates (Bauer-Kirby method). Following
incubation, the plates are examined and the zones of inhibition surrounding the disks
are measured and compared with established zone size ranges for individual
antimicrobial agents in order to determine the agent(s) most suitable for use in
antimicrobial therapy. The categorical interpretation [susceptible (S), intermediate (I),
or resistant (R)] for the organism being tested with the antimicrobial agent is made by
comparing zone diameters to those found in the respective organism tables of FDA
drug insert and/or CLSI/NCCLS Document M2 ("Performance Standards for
Antimicrobial Disk Susceptibility Tests”) and of CLSI/NCCLS Document M100
("Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing").
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Descriptive characteristics are sufficient for susceptibility test discs, because the
drug manufacturer performed several clinical outcome studies enrolling 1300
patients, which were evaluated by FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research
in order to grant approval of the drug Ceftaroline. These studies generated the
Interpretive Criteria and Quality Control Expected Ranges which the
antimicrobial susceptibility tests disk manufactures use for interpretation of
results also. No additional in vitro diagnostic clinical studies are therefore
required.

S = susceptible, I = intermediate, R = resistant
* The current absence of resistant isolates precludes defining any results other than
“Susceptible”. Isolates yielding MIC or disk diffusion results suggestive of
“Nonsusceptible” should be subjected to additional testing.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809. 10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports
a substantial equivalence decision.
