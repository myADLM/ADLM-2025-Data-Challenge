E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Sysmex® XN-Series modules (XN-10, XN-20) are multi-parameter hematology
analyzers intended to perform tests on whole blood samples collected in K or
2
K EDTA and body fluids (pleural, peritoneal and synovial) collected in K EDTA
3 2
anticoagulant. The analyzers can also perform tests on CSF which should not be
collected in any anticoagulant. The XN-Series modules consist of four principal units:
(1) Two Main Units (XN-10, XN-20) which aspirate, dilute, mix, and analyze blood
and body fluid samples; (2) Two Auto Sampler Units (SA-10, SA-20) which supply
samples to the Main Unit automatically; (3) IPU (Information Processing Unit) which
processes data from the Main Unit and provides the operator interface with the system;
(4) Pneumatic Unit which supplies pressure and vacuum from the Main Unit.
Three configurations for the XN-Series modules are provided:
a. XN-1000 comprised of:
1) XN-10
2) XN-20
3) SA-10 (Auto Sampler for single module)
b. XN-2000 comprised of:
1) Two XN-10 or XN-20 or combination
2) SA-20 (Auto Sampler for two modules)
c. XN-9000 comprised of:
1) One to nine XN-10 or XN-20 or combination of both modules
2) One to nine conveyors (CV), one for each XN module or Slide Preparation
Unit (SP)

--- Page 2 ---
3) SP-10 (Slide Preparation Unit)
4) BT-40 (Barcode Terminal)
2. Principles of Operation:
The XN-Series analyzers perform analysis using the following methods: Radio-
frequency (RF) / Direct-current (DC) Detection Method, Sheath Flow DC Detection
Method, and Flow Cytometry Methods using a Semiconductor Laser and Sodium
Lauryl Sulfate (SLS)-hemoglobin. Particle characterization and identification is based
on detection of forward scatter, fluorescence and adaptive cluster analysis. The XN-
Series analyzers automatically classify cells from whole blood and body fluids and
carry out all processes automatically from aspiration of the sample to outputting the
results.
The body fluid analysis mode of the XN-Series analyzers uses the 4DIFF scattergram
& the RBC distribution obtained from a specialized analysis sequence to calculate and
display the WBC (WBC-BF) counts, mononuclear cell (MN) / polymorphonuclear cell
(PMN) counts & percentages, TC-BF (Total Count) & RBC (RBC-BF) counts found
in the body fluid.
Analysis results and graphics are displayed on the IPU screen. They can be printed on
any of the available printers or transmitted to a host computer.
3. Modes of Operation:
Sampler Analysis Mode
Manual (Closed and Open Cap) Analysis Modes
Pre-dilute Analysis Mode (Dilute sample 1:7)
Low WBC Mode (LWBC)
Body Fluid Analysis Mode
4. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identification input is manual (by operator) or by barcode reader.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
There are two modes of sample introduction: (1) Sampler Mode; (2) Manual Mode. In
the Sampler Analysis Mode the operator loads the sample tubes into a rack, which is
then automatically transported and analyzed by the instrument. This mode
automatically mixes, aspirates, and analyzes samples without removing their caps. In
the Manual Analysis Mode, there are two sample tube holders: (1) Normal sample
tube holder; (2) Micro collection tube holder. In this mode the operator loads and
mixes the samples tubes individually by hand.
6. Calibration:
XN CALTM is used for calibration of the instrument for WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, PLT
and RET. XN CAL PFTM is used for calibration of the instrument for PLT-F (platelet
count obtained from the PLT-F channel). Calibration is performed as needed (e.g.,
when the QC data is fluctuating) to ensure accuracy of the system.
7. Quality Control:
2

--- Page 3 ---
The XN CHECKTM whole blood quality control material (three levels) and the XN BF
CHECKTM body fluid quality control material (two levels) are used to monitor the
performance of the XN-Series analyzers. Quality control should be run according to
licensing agency regulations.

J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Method comparison:
Whole blood
Method comparison studies were performed to assess the performance of the XN-
Series (XN-10, XN-20) analyzers when compared to the XE-5000 analyzer using a
total of 304 residual clinical K EDTA whole blood samples at three US sites. All
2
samples were run in the Automated Sampling Modes in singlet on the XE-5000
and within two hours on the XN-Series analyzers. Samples covered clinical
medical decision levels, and of the full reportable measuring ranges of the XN-
Series analyzers. The results of the linear regression and bias analyses between
the XE-5000 and XN-Series Whole Blood Mode met the acceptance criteria for all
applicable parameters for correlation coefficient (r) and %Bias with the exception
of RET-He which has a slightly lower r value on the XN-10 (r=0.88); however, the
%Bias was within the acceptable %Bias Limits and the reticulocyte parameter
from which the RET-He is derived met the acceptance criteria. An example of the

results between XN-10 and XE-5000 is shown below and comparable results are
obtained with the XN-20.

clinical medical decision levels, and of the full reportable measuring ranges of the
XN-series analyzers. All body fluids tested on XN-10 and XN-20 modules
showed good correlation when compared to the XE-5000. The estimation of the
bias of the body fluids collected met the bias limits. Shown below are comparison
results for XN-10. Similar results were obtained for XN-20.

Flagging capabilities
Clinical sensitivity/specificity studies were conducted to evaluate the flagging
capabilities of the XN-Series using patient samples representing a variety of
abnormal conditions in comparison to the XE-5000. The results of the XN-Series
flagging to the XE-5000 flagging evaluation were divided into two categories: (1)
Normal, healthy adults – No Flags, Negative Judgment (2) Patients with positive
morphology/Differential – Flags present, Positive Judgment. The results obtained
from the flagging comparison study met the specification of ≥90.0% Agreement.

analytical measuring range. Ten replicates of each sample were tested in the
whole blood manual mode at three clinical sites. The mean, standard deviation
(SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) were calculated for each sample. All sites
met manufacturer’s specifications (CV%) for precision.
Precision/Reproducibility – Whole Blood Mode
Precision/Reproducibility studies were performed on the XN-Series analyzers
(XN-10, XN-20) Whole Blood Manual Mode using three levels of quality control
material (Low, Normal and High). Each level was run in duplicate twice each day
for a minimum of 25 days using a single control lot at each of the three test sites.
The results of the whole blood precision (reproducibility) included the precision
results for each site separately and then combined data to show the within-run,
between-run, between-day, between-site and total imprecision. Both XN-10 and
XN-20 have similar results and met the acceptance criteria. Table below
summarizes results from XN-10.

fluid around medical decision levels and the upper and lower limit of the analytical
measuring range. Pleural, Peritoneal and Synovial fluids were collected in
K EDTA anticoagulant. Each sample was run ten consecutive times at three
2
clinical sites. The mean, SD, and CV were calculated for each sample included in
the study. The results of the Precision/Repeatability met the performance
specifications (CV%) for the XN-Series analyzers.
Precision/Reproducibility – Body Fluid Mode
Precision/Reproducibility studies were performed on the XN-Series analyzers
(XN-10, XN-20) Body Fluid Mode using two levels of quality control material
(Low and High). Each level was run in duplicate twice each day for a minimum of
25 days using a single control lot at each of the three test sites. The results of the
body fluid precision (reproducibility) included the precision results for each site
separately and then combined data to show the within-run, between-run, between-
day, between-site and total imprecision. All results met the acceptance criteria for
both XN-10 and XN-20. Results of XN-10 are shown below.

c. Linearity:
Whole blood
Serial dilutions of known high concentration of K EDTA whole blood samples and
2
control material which spanned the full measuring range of all direct measured
parameters and related measurements were aspirated in the whole blood open cap
manual mode at three clinical sites. Each serial dilution was run in duplicate. The
method has been demonstrated to be linear from lower limit to upper limit and
within measured allowable max % diff for each interval. Results of XN-10 are
shown below. XN-20 has comparable performance.

Body fluid
Linearity studies were performed at three clinical sites using serial dilutions of
known high concentrations of body fluid samples which spanned the full
measuring range of the WBC-BF, RBC-BF and TC-BF. Pleural, peritoneal and
synovial fluids were collected in K EDTA anticoagulant. All samples were
2
aspirated in the body fluid mode. Each serial dilution was run in duplicate. For
the measured analytes, WBC-BF, RBC-BF and TC-BF by XN-Series, the method
has been demonstrated to be linear from lower limit to upper limit and within
measured allowable max % diff for each interval. Shown below are results for
XN-10. Similar results were obtained for XN-20.

2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
a. Specimen Stability Studies:
Whole blood stability - Room temperature vs Refrigerated temperature
Thirty (30) normal residual K EDTA whole blood samples were evaluated at three
2
clinical sites. Two sets of samples were collected from each donor (room
temperature (RT) and refrigerated (LT)). The samples were run in duplicate on the
XN-Series analyzers in the Automated Whole Blood Mode. Each sample was
tested within 2-hours on all methods at baseline or zero (0) time, 8 hours, 24 hours,
36 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours at RT (20-25ºC) and LT (2-8ºC). The mean, SD,
CI and mean difference and/or percent difference were recorded for each sample.
The stability for the XN-Series met the manufacturer’s specifications for 24 hours
at RT and 48 hours at LT.
Twelve (12) abnormal residual K EDTA whole blood samples were also evaluated
2
by one clinical site. The residual samples were split into two sets of samples for
each donor (RT and LT). The samples were run in singlet (due to limited sample
volumes) on the XN-20 module in the Automated Whole Blood Mode. Each
sample was tested at baseline or zero (0) time, 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours at
RT (20-25ºC) and LT (2-8ºC). The mean, SD, CI and mean difference and/or
percent difference were recorded for each sample. The results of the stability
study using abnormal whole blood samples on the XN-20 module met the
manufacturer’s specifications for 24 hours at RT and 48 hours at LT.
Body fluid short term stability
Two different residual CSF, Pleural, and Peritoneal and Synovial fluids were
evaluated at two test sites. Pleural, Peritoneal and Synovial fluids were collected
in K EDTA anticoagulant and run in duplicate in the Body Fluid Mode. Each
2
sample was carefully mixed by gentle hand inversion at least 10 times before
analyzing on the XN-Series analyzers (XN-10 and XN-20) and tested at baseline
(zero (0) time), 1 hour, 4 hours and 6 hours at room temperature (20-25ºC). Body

the short term stability study.
b. Anticoagulant Comparison Study – K EDTA vs. K EDTA whole blood:
2 3
Anticoagulant comparison studies were performed to demonstrate comparability
between K EDTA vs. K EDTA whole blood samples using the XN-Series
2 3
analyzers (XN-10 and XN-20). A total of 46 paired whole blood samples
(K EDTA vs. K EDTA) drawn from healthy Sysmex employees were used for this
2 3
study. The samples were run in singlet on the XN-Series (XN-10, XN-20) and the
results of the K EDTA sample results were compared to the corresponding results
2
of the K EDTA sample for the same donor. Testing was performed in the Whole

Blood Automated Sampler Analysis Mode. Of the 46 normal whole blood
samples tested, 4 samples contained NRBCs (range 0.0-0.02 cells/μL) which is an
insufficient number for linear correlation analysis. The results of the linear
regression analysis and bias between the K EDTA and K EDTA whole blood met
2 3
the acceptance criteria for all applicable parameters.
c. Comparison of venous whole blood samples to capillary whole blood:
Studies were performed to demonstrate comparability between K EDTA venous
2
whole blood samples to K EDTA capillary whole blood samples using the XN-
2
Series analyzers (XN-10 and XN-20). A total of 20 paired whole blood venous
samples and capillary samples drawn from healthy Sysmex employees were used
for this study. The samples were run in singlet on the XN-Series (XN-10, XN-20)
and the results of the venous whole blood sample results were compared to the
corresponding results of the capillary sample for the same donor. Testing was
performed in the Whole Blood Manual Analysis Mode. The venous whole blood
samples were placed in the Normal Tube Position of the Manual Mode and the
capillary samples were placed in the Micro-collection Tube Position of the Manual
Mode for analysis. Of the 20 normal whole blood samples tested, 4 samples
contained NRBCs (range 0.0-0.02 cells/μL) which is an insufficient number for
linear regression analysis. The results of the linear regression analysis and bias
between venous whole blood samples and capillary whole blood samples on the
XN-Series analyzers met the acceptance criteria for all applicable parameters.
d. Comparison of K EDTA tubes and micro-collection tubes:
2
A total of 47 residual K EDTA whole blood samples (less than 8 hours old)
2
collected by venipuncture blood draw were used to determine the presence or
absence of matrix effect between K EDTA tubes and micro-collection tubes on the
2
XN-Series analyzers (XN-10, XN-20). A total of 13 of these samples were diluted
with normal saline to create near zero cell counts for the WBC, RBC and PLT
parameters. Sample distribution included clinical medical decision levels and to
the extent possible of the analytical measuring range. K EDTA whole blood
2
samples were first analyzed in singlet in the Manual Mode Normal Tube position.
Within two hours of analysis in the normal tube position, the samples were
transferred to micro-collection tubes (without additive) and analyzed in the
Manual Mode Micro-collection tube position. Of the 47 samples tested in the
study, 1 sample failed to result a RET-He value. The results of the linear
regression analysis and bias between the K EDTA tube and micro-collection tubes
2
17

on the XN-Series analyzers met the acceptance criteria for all applicable
parameters.
e. Bridging Study (Pre-dilute Mode normal tube position and Pre-dilute Mode micro-
collection tube position):
A total of 20 K EDTA (4 mL tubes) whole blood samples drawn from healthy
2
Sysmex employees were used to determine the equivalency between the Manual
Whole Blood Mode Pre-dilute Normal Tube Position and the Manual Whole
Blood Mode Pre-dilute Micro-collection tube position. Pre-dilute (1:7) samples
were prepared for each of the 20 samples by dispensing 420 μL of the analyzer’s
diluent into plain top tubes (3 mL tubes) then adding 70 μL of whole blood and
mixing 10 times by gentle inversion. The plain top 3 mL tubes were analyzed in
singlet on both XN-Series analyzers (XN-10 and XN-20) within 1 hour of dilution
preparation in the Manual Whole Blood Pre-dilute Mode normal tube position.
Immediately following, the samples were mixed 10 times then transferred to
micro-collection tubes (without additive) and analyzed in the Manual Whole
Blood Pre-dilute Mode Micro-collection tube position (Cap Off). The pre-dilute
mode automatically multiplies sample results before results are displayed therefore
no additional calculation is required in this mode. The results of the linear
regression analysis and bias between the Pre-dilute Mode normal tube and Pre-
dilute mode micro-collection tube on the XN-Series analyzers met the acceptance
criteria in the Pre-dilute Mode for all applicable parameters.
f. Bridging Study – Comparison of Low WBC Mode normal tube position and Low
WBC Mode micro-collection tube position:
Twenty duplicate K EDTA anticoagulated whole blood samples drawn from
2
healthy Sysmex employees were selected to determine the equivalency between
the Low WBC Mode normal tube position and the Low WBC Mode micro-
collection tube position. One sample from each set of duplicate samples was
centrifuged, the plasma removed and used to dilute (10-30 μL whole blood added
to 400 μL plasma) the other uncentrifuged sample to create low concentrations of
WBC (≤1.0 x 10³/μL). Each sample was mixed by gentle hand inversion 10 times
and run in singlet in the Low WBC Mode Normal Tube Position on the XN-Series
analyzers (XN-10 and XN-20). The samples were then transferred to micro-
collection tubes (without additive) and run in the Low WBC Mode Micro-
collection Tube Position (Cap Off) on both XN-Series analyzers within 1 hour of
analysis of the Normal Tube Position. Statistical analysis results are not available
for basophils and immature granulocytes due to the low frequency of these cell
types seen in the normal samples. Of the 20 samples tested, there were no
basophils seen (range 0.00-0.00 cells/μL) and 4 samples with immature
granulocytes (range 0.00-0.04 cells/μL). The results of the linear regression
analysis and bias between the Low WBC Mode normal tube position and Low
WBC Mode micro-collection tube position met the acceptance criteria for the Low
WBC Mode for all applicable parameters with the exception of PLT-I and
LYMPH%. The PLT-I (r=0.9404 on the XN-20) has a slightly lower r value;
however, the difference between the two devices were within the acceptable
%Bias Limits. The LYMPH% (r=0.8472 on the XN-10) had a lower r value;
however, the difference between the two devices were within the acceptable
18

--- Page 19 ---
%Bias Limits and the WBC parameter in which the LYMPH% is derived met both
the correlation coefficient and bias acceptance limits.
g. Determination of limit of blank, lower limits of detection and quantitation:
Limit of Blank (LoB) – Whole Blood and Body Fluid Mode
The LoB was obtained from 60 repeated measurements of a single blank diluent
sample (CELLPACK DCL) analyzed in the sampling modes for whole blood and
body fluid. The mean, SD and LoB were calculated for both XN-10 and XN-20
analyzers. The LoB on both the XN-10 and XN-20 analyzers for whole blood
parameters WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, PLT-F and PLT-I is zero (0) cells/μL. The
LoB on both the XN-10 and XN-20 analyzers for body fluid parameters WBC-BF,
TC-BF, MN#, PMN# and RBC-BF is zero (0) cells/μL.
Limit of Detection (LoD), Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) – Whole Blood Mode
The LoD was obtained from three test runs of 60 repeated measurements taken
from one low concentration sample for each run. The known concentration for
each target sample was determined using the XE-5000 predicate method. The
mean, SD and LoD were calculated for both XN-10 and XN-20 analyzers. The
LoD on the XN-10 for WBC is 0.019 x 10³μ/L, RBC is 0.007 x 106μ/L, HGB is
0.064 g/dL, HCT is 0.083 %, PLT-F is 0.862 x 10³μ/L and PLT-I is 1.566 x
10³μ/L. The LoD on the XN-20 for WBC is 0.012 x 10³μ/L, RBC is 0.008 x
106μ/L, HGB is 0.041 g/dL, HCT is 0.083 %, PLT-F is 0.828 x 10³μ/L and PLT-I
is 1.314 x 10³μ/L.
The LoQ was obtained from three test runs of 40 repeated measurements taken
from one low concentration sample for each run. The known concentration for
each target sample was determined using the XE-5000 predicate method. The
mean, SD and LoQ were calculated for both XN-10 and XN-20 analyzers. The
LoQ and lower bound of the Analytical Measuring Range (AMR) on both the XN-
10 and XN-20 analyzers for WBC is 0.03 x 10³μ/L, RBC is 0.01 x 106μ/L, HGB is
0.1 g/dL, HCT is 0.1 %, PLT-F and PLT-I is 2 x 10³μ/L.
Limit of Detection (LoD), Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) – Body Fluid Mode
The LoD was obtained from three test runs of 60 repeated measurements taken
from one low concentration sample for each run. The known concentration for
each target sample was determined using the XE-5000 predicate method. The
mean, SD and LoD were calculated for both XN-10 and XN-20 analyzers. The
LoD on both the XN-10 and XN-20 analyzers for WBC-BF, TC-BF, MN#, and
PMN# is 0.002 x 10³cells/μL and RBC-BF is 0.001 x 106cells/μL.
The LoQ was obtained from three test runs of 40 repeated measurements taken
from one low concentration sample for each run. The known concentration for
each target sample was determined using the XE-5000 predicate method. The
mean, SD and LoQ were calculated for both XN-10 and XN-20 analyzers. The
LoQ and lower bound of the Analytical Measuring Range (AMR) on both the XN-
10 and XN-20 analyzers for WBC-BF, TC-BF, MN#, and PMN# is 0.003 x
10³cells/μL and RBC-BF is 0.002 x 106cells/μL.
h. Reference Intervals:
Adult reference intervals (Normal Population Reference Ranges) were assessed for
19

--- Page 20 ---
the XN-Series analyzers by comparing K EDTA anticoagulated samples collected
2
from healthy male (n=48) and female (n=56) donors >21 years of age. Pre-
established reference intervals from the XE-5000 predicate device were used as a
default normal range flag. The study results showed that less than 10 percent of
the results were outside the proposed reference interval providing verification of
the previously established reference intervals.
Due to the unavailability of obtaining normal body fluid samples, it is difficult for
laboratories to establish reference intervals; therefore, Sysmex recommends that
laboratories reference textbook values for their body fluid reference intervals.
Sysmex recommends that each laboratory establishes its own expected reference
intervals based upon the laboratory’s patient population encountered during daily
operation. Expected reference intervals may vary due to the differences in sex,
age, diet, fluid intake, geographic location.
K. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
