L. Test Principle:
The Elecsys HE4 assay is a two-step sandwich immunoassay. First, sample is incubated with
a biotinylatd monoclonal HE4-specific antibody and a monoclonal HE4-specific antibody
labeled with a ruthenium to forms a sandwich complex. After addition of streptavidin-coated
microparticles, the complex bounds to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and
streptavidin. The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the
microparticals are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound
substances are then removed. A voltage is applied to the electrode to induce
chemiluminesent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier. The results are

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of Elecsys HE4 assay was evaluated using five pooled human serum
samples and two control samples (PreciControl Elecsys HE4). The pooled serum
samples were prepared at the following levels: 25.3 pmol/L, 53.7 pmol/L, 142
pmol/L, 779 pmol/L, and 1437 pmol/L and concentrations of the controls were 45.7
pmol/L and 345 pmol/L. Samples were tested in 4 replicates (2 replicates/run), 2 runs
a day for 21 days on Roche cobas e 411 immunoassay analyzer. A total 84
observations were generated for each sample. The results are summarized in the
following table.

Lot-to-lot reproducibility was evaluated by testing a total of 126 samples with HE4
values from 29.4 to 1387 pmol/L with different lots of reagent. The regression
analysis (Passing-Bablok) by comparing the data generated by different lots of
reagent shows the following parameters: slope=0.958 (95% CI: 0.929 – 0.975),
intercept = 1.71 pmol/L (95% CI; 0.458 – 3.76 pmol/L), correlation tau=0.999.
Site-to-site precision was evaluated on two cobas e 411 immunoassay analyzers at
two external sites according to CLSI EP5-A2 using four human serum samples
(within difference concentration ranges covering the measuring range) and two

PreciControl HE4 samples. Samples were tested in 4 replicates per run for 21 days at
each site. The %CV for site-to-site precision is <5.2% for all tested samples.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
i) Linearity:
To determine the linearity of the Elecsys HE4 assay, the dilution series were
prepared using three high concentration levels of HE4 human serum samples. For
each sample, 17 concentrations (15 dilutions) throughout the measuring range
were prepared. Each dilution was tested in triplicate. The linearity data were
analyzed with regards to linear, quadratic and cubic polynomials according to
CLSI EP6-A. Regression analyses of the observed results (y) and the expected
results (x) for each sample and pooled data are presented below:
Range Regression Slope Intercept
Sample
(pmol/L) equation 95% CI 95% CI
1 0 – 1780 y=1.016x + 0.309 1.005 – 1.027 0.296 – 0.322
2 0 – 1827 y=0.947x + 0.393 0.932 – 0.963 0.156 – 0.629
3 0 – 1887 y=0.945x + 0.225 0.934 – 0.956 0.051 – 0.398
Pooled 0 – 1887 y=0.973x + 0.103 0.916 – 1.029 0.079 – 0.126
Linearity was confirmed in the range from 12.6 to 1510 pmol/L. The claimed
measuring range for Elecsys HE4 assay is 20 – 1500 pmol/L.
ii) High Dose Hook-effect:
The high dose hook effect of the Elecsys HE4 assay was assessed on the cobas e
411. Two samples were spiked with HE4 to concentrations of 48,864 pmol/L and
48,795 pmol/L, respectively. For each sample, a dilution series was made to have
5 to 6 samples above the measuring range. Each dilution was tested in triplicate.
The hook concentration reported corresponds to the analyte concentration with a
signal corresponding to at least 10% above the highest master calibrator. No hook
effect is detected with HE4 concentrations up to 40,000 pmol/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i) Traceability:
The Elecsys HE4 assay was standardized using the Fujirebio HE4 EIA method
from Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc as no international standard is available for HE4.
ii) Value Assignment:
(a) Elecsys HE4 CalCheck5: Elecsys HE4 CalCheck5 set contains 5 lyophilized
levels of human HE4 from OvCar-3 culture in equine serum and has been
standardized against the HE4 EIA method from Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc.

For additional analyzers, the same value assignment procedure was
performed. The assigned values obtained on the additional analyzers are
compared to those obtained on the Modular Analytics E170 analyzer. The
acceptance criteria for analyzer-to-analyzer variability are within 10% for
each level of CalCheck.
(b) Elecsys HE4 CalSet: Elecsys HE4 CalSet set contains lyophilized equine
serum with added HE4 protein (human, cell line OvCar-3) in two
concentration ranges (approx. 5 pmol/L and approx. 200 pmol/L).
For each lot of Elecsys HE4 CalSet manufactured, the calibrators are run in
duplicate on at least 3 Elecsys 2010 analyzers and at least 3 Modular
Analytics E170 analyzers with all Elecsys HE4 reagent lots available. The
master calibrator curve is generated from 5 master calibrators at 1, 11.59,
28.49 144.4 and 1903 pmol/L. The assigned target value of each calibrator is
the median value obtained over at least 6 determinations (duplicate runs on at
least 3 analyzers) of respective calibrator.
(c) Elecsys PreciControl HE4: Elecsys PreciControl HE4 contains lyophilized
human serum with HE4 (human, from cell line OvCar-3) in two concentration

same value assignment procedure is performed. The assigned values obtained
on the additional analyzers are compared to those obtained on the Modular
Analytics E170. The acceptance criterion for analyzer-to-analyzer variability
is 9%.
iii) Stability:
(a) Sample stability: Sample stability was evaluated for the following storage
conditions: 22°C for 6 hours, 2-8C for three days, or -20C for 13 weeks.
Ten samples for each sample type (Serum, K -EDTA-plasma, K -EDTA-
2 3
plasma, Li-Heparin-plasma) were aliquoted and evaluated directly after
collection (reference) and after the tested storage condition, respectively. In
addition, ten samples for each sample type were evaluated directly after
collection (reference) and after three/thaw cycles. Measurements were
performed with three-fold determination on a cobas e 411 immunoassay
analyzer and recovery was calculated as percent of the reference value. The
resulting data support the claim that serum, Li-Heparin-, K -EDTA- and K -
2 3
EDTA-plasma specimens are stable at the following conditions: 5 hours at 15-
25°C, 2 days at 2-8C, 12 weeks at -20C with up to two freeze/thaw cycles.
(b) Calibration curve stability: The calibration curve stability was performed
using two Elecsys HE4 reagent lots on a cobas e 411. Five human serum
samples and two control samples were tested. The data support that the
calibrator curve is stable up to 28 days. During that time period, fresh reagent
kits of the same lot can be used without calibration using the calibration curve
of the Day 0 reagent kit.
(c) Assay kit stability:
Closed-vial stability: The real-time and accelerated stability studies were
performed on cobas e 411 analyzer. Five human serum samples and two
controls were tested. For real-time stability, data were collected at point 0, 6,
13, 16, 22 and 30 months at 2-8°C. For accelerated stability study, data were
collected for 3 weeks after 35°C. The data support that Elecsys HE4 reagent
kits have a shelf life up to 12 months when stored at 2-8°C.
Open-vial stability: Stability study was done to evaluate the reagent
stability after first opening. A fresh kit was placed on the analyzer and
calibrated. Reference values for the samples tested were determined. After
the measurements, the kit was removed from the analyzer and kept at 2-8 °C
for 15 weeks. After 15 weeks the kit was placed on the analyzer again,
calibrated and the samples were run again. Five human serum samples and
two controls were tested. The results support that Elecsys HE4 reagent kits
are stable for up to 12 weeks when stored at 2-8°C after first opening.
10

--- Page 11 ---
Open-vial/On-board stability: Reagent on-board stability and calibration
stability were evaluated on one cobas e 411 and one cobas e 601 analyzers. A
fresh Reagent Rack-Pack was placed on the analyzer and calibrated. All
samples were measured on Day 1. On Day 8 and Day 36, the same samples
were measured with the same reagent kit (kept at 20°C  3°C, simulating on-
board conditions) using the calibration curves established on Day 1 and Day
29, respectively. The results support that Elecsys HE4 reagent kits can be
stored on board of the analyzers for up to 28 days. A new calibration of the
kit kept on-board is recommended every 7 days.
(d) Elecsys HE4 CalCheck 5 stability:
Open-vial stability: One lot of Elecsys HE4 CalCheck 5 was evaluated in
duplicate on the cobas e 411. The test material was reconstituted and stored at
25ºC for 6 hours (in an open vial). The reference material was a freshly
reconstituted set of CalCheck. The recovery of test material was calculated as
a percent of the reference value. The acceptance criterion is 90 – 110%
recovery of the reference material value. The data support the claimed
stability – Elecsys HE4 CalCheck 5 is stable up to 5 hours at 20-25°C.
Closed-vial stability: The real-time and accelerated stability study was done
to evaluate the shelf life of the Elecsys HE4 CalCheck 5. For accelerated
stability study, one lot of Elecsys HE4 CalCheck 5 was evaluated in duplicate
on the cobas e 411. The test material was stored at 35°C for 3 weeks. The
reference material was a freshly reconstituted set of CalCheck (stored at 2-
8°C). After 3 weeks, the test and reference materials were tested in duplicate.
The recovery of test material was calculated as a percent of the reference
value. The acceptance criterion is 90 – 110% recovery of the reference
materials. For real-time stability study, the test material is stored at 2-8°C.
Samples at 0, 6, 13, 19, 25, 31, and 37 months will be tested in duplicate.
Recovery values are calculated by comparing to the unstressed reference value
(stored at -20°C). The acceptance criterion is <15 pmol/L for CalCheck Level
1 and recovery of 90-110% for CalCheck Level 2-5.
The results from the accelerated stability and on-going real-time stability
support an initial shelf-life claim of 18 months at 2-8°C for the Elecsys HE4
CalCheck 5.
(e) Elecsys HE4 CalSet stability:
Stability after reconstitution: The test and reference materials were tested in
duplicate. The test material was reconstituted and stored in closed vials for 29
days at 2 – 8C, 13 weeks at -15 to -25C. In addition, stability for 5
freeze/thaw cycles was evaluated. The reference material was a freshly
reconstituted CalSet. The recovery of test material was calculated as
percentage of the reference value. The acceptance criterion of recovery is 95
11

--- Page 12 ---
– 105%. The data support the following stability claim for the reconstituted
Elecsys HE4 CalSet: 7 days at 2 – 8C, 8 weeks at -15 to -25C with 1
freeze/thaw cycle.
Open vial/On-board stability: Two lots of Elecsys were evaluated in
duplicate on the cobas e 411 and the cobas e 601. The test material was
reconstituted and stored for at 25ºC for 6 hours (in an open vial). The
reference material was a freshly reconstituted set of CalSet. The recovery of
test material was calculated as a percent of the reference value. The
acceptance criterion for recovery is 95 – 105%. The data support the claimed
stability – Elecsys HE4 CalSet is stable up to 5 hours on board (at 20-25°C) of
the Elecsys and cobas e analyzers. According to the sponsor, the Elecsys HE
CalSet should only be used once on MODULAR ANALYTICS E170/cobas e
601.
Closed vial stability: The stability of Elecsys HE4 CalSet was evaluated with
the real-time and accelerated stability study. For accelerated stability study,
one Elecsys HE4 CalSet lot was evaluated in duplicate on the cobas e 411.
The test material was stored lyophilized at 35°C for 3 weeks. The reference
material was a freshly reconstituted set of CalCheck (stored at 4°C). After 3
weeks, the test and reference materials were tested in duplicate. The recovery
of test material was calculated as a percent of the reference value. The
acceptance criterion is 95 – 105% recovery of the reference materials. For
real-time stability, the test material is stored at 2-8°C. Sample at time-points
at 0, 6, 13, 19, 25, 31, and 37 months will be tested in duplicate. Calibration
curves are generated using calibrators stored at 2-8C and calibrators stored at
-20C (reference). Measurement values for HE4 PreciControl 1 and
PreciControl 2 are read from the calibration curve generated using calibrators
stored at 2 – 8C and compared to measurement values read from a calibration
curve using calibrators stored at -20C (reference). The acceptance criterion
for HE4 PreciControl 1 and PreciControl 2 is recovery of 90-110% of the
reference value.
The results from the accelerated stability and on-going real-time stability
support an initial shelf-life claim of 12 months at 2 – 8C for the Elecsys
CalSet.
(f) Elecsys PreciControl HE4 stability:
Stability after reconstitution: The test and reference materials were tested in
duplicate. The test material was reconstituted and stored in closed vials for 29
days at 2 – 8C, 13 weeks at -15 to -25C or 25 hours at 25C. The reference
material was a freshly reconstituted PreciControl HE4. The recovery of test
material was calculated as percentage of the reference value. The acceptance
criterion of recovery is 90 – 110%. The data support the following stability
12

--- Page 13 ---
claim for the reconstituted Elecsys PreciControl HE4: 14 days at 2 – 8C, 4
weeks at -20C, and 24 hours at 20-25C.
Open-vial stability after reconstitution: Two lots of Elecsys PreciControl
HE4 were evaluated in duplicate on the cobas e 411 and the cobas e 601
analyzer. The test material was reconstituted and stored for 6 hours at 25ºC in
open vial on the instrument. The reference material was a freshly
reconstituted set of PreciControl HE4. The recovery of test material was
calculated as a percent of the reference value. The acceptance criterion was
90 – 110%. The data support the claimed stability – Elecsys Predicator HE4
is stable up to 5 hours at 20-25°C on the instrument.
Closed-vial stability: The real-time and accelerated stability study was done
to evaluate the shelf-life of the Elecsys PreciControl. For accelerated stability
study, one Elecsys PreciControl HE4 lot was evaluated in duplicate on the
cobas e 411. The test material was stored lyophilized at 35°C for 3 weeks.
The reference material was a freshly reconstituted set of PreciControl (stored
at 2-8°C). After 3 weeks, the test and reference materials were tested in
duplicate. The recovery of test material was calculated as a percent of the
reference value. The acceptance criterion is 90 – 110% recovery of the
reference materials. For real-time stability, the test material is stored at 2-8°C.
Samples at 0, 6, 13, 19, 25, 31, and 37 months are tested in duplicate. The
recovery of test material is calculated as percent recovery compared to the
reference value (stored at -20C). The acceptance criterion for PreciControl
HE4 is 90-110% of the reference value.
The results from the accelerated stability and on-going real-time stability
support the shelf-life claim of 9 months at 2 – 8C.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) of
the Elecsys HE4 assay were determined on cobas e 411 and cobas e 601 in
accordance with the CLSI EP17-A requirements.
For LoB, five analyte-free samples were analyzed on two cobas e 411 and two cobas
e 601 over 3 days, 2 runs per day with a single replicate per run, for a total of 60
determinations. LoB was determined as the 95th percentile of measurements of blank
samples. The LoB was 0.358 pmol/L on cobas e 411 and 0.230 pmol/L on cobas e
601.
For LoD, five human serum samples with low analyte concentration were analyzed
on two cobas e 411 and two cobas e 601 over 3 days, 2 runs per day with a single
replicate per run. A pooled estimate of the precision (SD ) for the 5 low level
total
samples was calculated, LoD = LoB + 1.653 x SD . The LoD calculated was 0.661
total
pmol/L on cobas e 411 and 0.497 pmol/L on cobas e 601.
13

--- Page 14 ---
For LoQ, a low concentration level sample set of 6 samples was prepared by diluting
3 human serum samples with an analyte-free calibrator matrix. The sample set was
tested in singlicate for three days, two runs per day on two cobas e 411 and two cobas
e 601 analyzers. Each run was calibrated separately using a two-point calibration in
combination with the master curve stored on the reagent barcode. The Elecsys
PreciControl HE4 was tested and evaluated for each run to determine assay validity.
The Total Error (TE) was calculated based on the average bias and SDs for each
member of the sample set: TE = | bias | + 1.96 *SD. LoQ is derived from a plot of the
allowable error versus the expected HE4 value at a Total Error of 30%. The
calculated LoQ was 2.15 pmol/L on cobas e 411 and 4.42 pmol/L on cobas e 601.
According to the sponsor, all other instruments meet the same specification as that for
cobas e 411 and cobas e 601. The results support a claim for LoB of 5 pmol/L, LoD
of 15.0 pmol/L, and LoQ of 20.0 pmol/L in the labeling.
e. Analytical specificity:
i) Endogenous Substance Interference:
Effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of endogenous interfering
substances using the Elecsys HE4 assay was determined on cobas e 411 analyzer
using pooled native human serum samples with 3 HE4 levels (54.2–60.6 pmol/L,
141–161 pmol/L, and 416–485 pmol/L) spiked with varying levels of interferent.
The interfering substances tested included hemoglobin, biotin, lipemia, bilirubin,
rheumatoid factor and IgG.
The resulting samples series (ten levels of interferent per sample) were tested and
the %of recovery was calculated. Bias exceeding 10% for recovery was
considered interference. No significant interference was noted for samples
containing hemoglobin (up to 1,000 mg/dL), biotin (up to 50 ng/mL), lipemia (up
to 2,000 mg/dL), bilirubin (up to 66 mg/dL), rheumatoid factors (up to 1,500
IU/mL), and IgG (up to 70 g/L).
ii) Human Anti-Mouse Antibody (HAMA) Interference:
The effect of the presence of human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) on the
Elecsys HE4 assay was assessed on the cobas e 411 analyzer. A high HAMA
serum pool (805 ng/mL) was divided into five aliquots which were further spiked
with analyte to yield five different HE4 concentrations: 49.9 (unspiked), 176, 347,
535, and 1187 pmol/L. The control samples were five aliquots containing no
HAMA and had concentrations corresponding to the test samples. Each high
HAMA serum pool was diluted in 11 steps with the corresponding control
sample. All dilutions of samples and controls were analyzed. All samples
recovered within ±10% of their controls. The data support that HAMA at levels
up to 805 ng/mL had no significant effect on the performance of the Elecsys HE4
assay.
14

iii) Exogenous Substance Interference:
Eighteen (18) pharmaceutical compounds and fourteen (14) cancer drugs were
spiked into human serum samples with two HE4 levels (~50–63 pmol/L and
~707–813 pmol/L) and examined for potential interference on HE4 determination
using Elecsys HE4 assay on the cobas e 411 analyzer. Significant interference
was defined as ± 3SD of the reference value (unspiked sample) or ±10% deviation
from the reference value. No significant interference was found for each
compound and drug at the concentration listed below.

The specificity of the Elecsys HE4 assay was determined using native human
serum samples (single donors) spiked with potential cross-reacting compounds
(related proteins): Secretory Leucocyte Protease Inhibitor (SLPI) and Elastase-
specific inhibitor (Elafin)/Skin-derived antileukoproteinase (SKALP). The spiked
and non-spiked samples were tested in duplicates on cobas e 411. No cross-
reactivity was observed for SLPI at 20,833 pmol/L and Elafin/SKALP at 54,500
pmol/L.

(EOC) compared to changes in their disease status. The sample inclusion and
exclusion criteria are as follows:
Inclusion criteria:
 confirmed diagnosis of ovarian cancer;
 appropriate clinical data/information;
 normal appearance of sample;
 minimum 0.5 ml volume available;
 informed Consent available;
 > 3 draws available.
Exclusion criteria:
 no clinical observation per visit;

Serum samples were obtained from 80 women with EOC undergoing serial
surveillance monitoring of cancer progression. Changes in clinical status were
determined by physicians based on the clinical information (medical imaging,
physical examination, and other clinical investigations). The following definition was
used to categorize the patient’s disease status:
1. No Evidence of Disease (NED) – a complete lack of clinical evidence of
disease as determined by the treating physician.
2. Stable Disease – clinical evidence that the disease had not changed since the
last assessment as determined by the treating physician.
3. Responding Disease – Clinical evidence that the primary tumor had shrunk
and there was no evidence of new tumors as determined by the treating
physician.
4. Progressive Disease – Clinical evidence of growth in the primary tumor or the
appearance of new tumors since the last assessment as determined by the
treating physician.
Among 80 subjects (age from 20 to 85 years old), 9 (11.25%) subjects were
premenopausal and 71 (88.75%) were postmenopausal. Majority of subjects (n = 69)
were Caucasian, the remaining subjects included 3 African American and 1 Asian,
and 7 others with unknown races. Of 80 subjects, 51 subjects had staging
information. Of 51 staged subjects, 18 (22.5%) were stage I, II while 43 (53.75%)
17

--- Page 18 ---
were stage III, IV. A total of 493 values consisting of 80 baseline values and 413
monitoring observations were obtained with the mean number of sample draws of
5.16 per subject.
In this study, HE4 serum levels for all serum samples were measured using the
Elecsys HE4 assay on cobas e 411. The performance of the Elecsys HE4 assay as an
aid in monitoring of disease status in ovarian cancer subjects was determined by
assessing percentage changes in HE4 levels correlated to the clinical assessment at
the time of assay.
The following table shows the median (and 1st and 3rd quartile values) %change in
HE4 in each clinical disease states:
Clinical
N Min 1st quartile Median 3rd quartile Max
Condition
NED 176 -55.4% -9.7% -1.9% 9.8% 252.0%
Stable
85 -81.4% -13.4% -0.7% 20.8% 566.8%
Disease
Responding
71 -93.3% -43.1% -15.8% 2.5% 258.1%
Disease
Progressive
81 -76.0% -2.6% 14.8% 48.9% 2642.8%
Disease
The results indicated that median %change for samples with NED and stable disease
are below 0%. The median %change for samples with responding disease was
-15.8% which was significantly below 0%change. Samples with progression had a
median %change significantly above 0% change. The results indicated that the
median %change for samples with progression and no-progression categories are
related to the disease state of the subject.
For evaluation of clinical sensitivity and specificity of Elecsys HE4 assay, the clinical
disease status was condensed into 2 categories: Progression and No-progression.
Subjects with progression contained those monitoring events defined as progressive
disease. Subjects with no-progression contained those monitoring events defined as
“NED”, “Stable disease” and “Responding disease”. Sponsor shows a receiver-
operator characteristics (ROC) curve analysis of the percentage change in HE4. The
ROC plot gives the sensitivity/specificity for all possible cutoffs.

The area under the ROC curve is 0.699 (95% CI: 0.630 – 0.767) and is significantly
better than the non-association area of 0.5. Note the observed area under the ROC
curve is statistically equivalent to the area under the ROC curve reported by predicate
in the k093957 (area=0.684; 95% CI: 0.618 – 0.750).
Currently, there is no clinically accepted cut-off for use in monitoring cancer
progression in epithelial ovarian cancer subjects with this assay. Sponsor
summarized the analysis and suggested a series of %change in HE4 cutoff values

The results indicated that for increasing % change in HE4 cutoff values, the
sensitivity decreases and the specificity increases. The labeling presents a similar
table of differing sensitivity and specificity values at different % change in HE4 so
clinicians can choose a value that reflects their own preferences in sensitivity or
specificity.
The clinical performance of the Elecsys HE4 assay at different %change in HE4 was
evaluated against that of the predicate ARCHITECT HE4. The table below compared
the clinical sensitivity and specificities between the Elecsys HE4 and ARCHITECT
HE4 using a series of %change in HE4 values as determined in two separate clinical
study.

Similar clinical sensitivity and specificity at each %change of HE4 are provided for
two assays. Note neither Elecsys HE4 assay nor ARCHITECT HE4 assay should be
used interchangeably with other manufactures’ methods for HE4 determinations for
the same patient during the monitoring of disease status.
b. Other clinical supportive data:
In this study, HE4 was determined for 80 female subjects diagnosed with epithelial
ovarian cancer (EOC) compared to changes in their disease status to evaluate the
performance of Elecsys HE4 assay. The percentage change in assay value was
chosen to ensure that the change in the test device would not be attributed to assay
variation. To evaluate the performance characteristics at a fixed %change threshold,
sponsor chose a cut-off which represented 2 times the total %CV of the assay.

Because the acceptance criterion for total imprecision is no more than 7%, a 20%
change was selected. The following table represents the number of all clinical visits
for all 80 subjects as which a clinical evolution of progression/no-progression
occurred and the percentage change of the subjects at these clinical evaluations:
Disease Status

Sensitivity: 46.9% (95% CI: 37.3 – 56.3%)
Specificity: 84.0% (95% CI: 81.7 – 86.3%)
At this cut-off, the assay is informative with respect to progression/no-progression.
The true positive rate (0.469) minus the false positive rate (0.16) is greater than zero
(difference 0.309, 95% confidence interval of difference 0.190 to 0.427).

Note for the subjects with NED, this change in HE4 is not informative as 75% of
subjects with NED has the %change in HE4 less than ± 20% (a %change in HE4
between -9.7% in the first quartile and 9.8% in the third quartile was observed).
However, a different type of cutoff may be informative in subjects with NED vs. subjects
without NED. According to the sponsor’s study, 99.7% of the apparently healthy
women had a HE4 assay value at or below 140 pmol/L (see the section 5, Expected
values/Reference range). Since 175 out of 176 (99.4%) subjects with NED had HE4
levels below 140 pmol/L, the performance of the assay was assessed by comparing a
patient’s HE4 value for elevation above the normal range to detect a change in status
from NED. The results are summarized in the following table:

The sensitivity of HE4 assay for NED at 140 pmol/L value was 99.4%. This
indicates that 99% of subjects with NED will have HE4 concentrations less than 140
pmol/L. The specificity of the HE4 assay for NED at 140 pmol/L value was 34.2%.
For subjects with responding disease, stable disease and progressive disease, assay
performance was examined in a single table to correlate these 3 different clinical
states with three categories of %change in HE4 value, e.g., a %change less than 20%,
%change between -20% and 20%, and %change greater than 20%. The table below
represents subject counts for all subjects and all visits based upon data in the clinical
study:

Specificity 80.13%
(95% CI: 74.41  85.81%)
For the three clinical disease states, responding disease, stable disease and
progressive disease, the HE4 assay is informative since the difference in sensitivity
(true positive rate) minus 1-specificity (the false positive rate) is greater than 0.
Among 80 subjects, 71 (88.75%) subjects were postmenopausal women and 9
(11.25%) were premenopausal women. The clinical performance characteristics of
Elecsys HE4 assay was analyzed based on menopausal status: The results are

4. Clinical cut-off:
Currently, there is no clinically accepted cut-off for use in monitoring cancer progression
in epithelial ovarian cancer subjects with this assay. A cut-off could be a percentage
change from a previously determined value and would be expected to correlate with the
clinical state at the time of assay and clinical evaluation. The labeling contains various
percentage changes in HE4 from a previous value as determined in the clinical study.
The assay sensitivity and specificity at each cut-off are indicated for use in a serial
surveillance monitoring situation where clinical outcome is categorized as cancer
progression/non-progression.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The distribution of HE4 was determined in samples from healthy individuals and from
patients with nonmalignant or malignant diseases.
For apparently healthy women, 198 premenopausal samples and 147 postmenopausal
samples (total=345 samples) were tested. Samples covered age ranging from 20 to 79
and consisted of 289 White/Caucasians, 52 African American, and 2 American
Indian/Alaskan Natives (the race of 2 subjects was unknown). The results are presented

The results indicated that the Elecsys HE4 values among the apparently healthy women
increase with increasing age.
Besides apparently healthy women population, the Elecsys HE4 value was determined in
samples from 60 pregnant women, 325 patients with benign conditions and 425 patients
with malignant conditions. The benign conditions included benign gynecological
diseases (e.g., fibroids, cysts, pelvic inflammatory, disease, HPV, endometriosis,
Chlamydia, Candida), congestive heart failure (CHF), and other non-gynecological
diseases (e.g., anemia, Sjögren’s syndrome, end stage renal disease, glaucoma, diabetes,
diverticulitis, arthritis, hypothyroidism). The malignant conditions included epithelial
ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, breast cancer, gastrointestinal (GI) cancer, lung
cancer and bladder cancer. The results of HE4 value in all tested cohort are summarized
in the table below:

In this study, 99.7% (344 of 345) of the apparently healthy women and 100% (60 of 60)
pregnant women had a HE4 assay value at or below 140 pmol/L.
In patients with benign gynecologic disease, 98.6% of pre-menopausal women and 88.5%
of the post-menopausal women displayed HE4 values below 140 pmol/L. Eleven women
(18.6%) presenting with benign non-gynecologic diseases such as fibrocystic changes
(n=6), Sjögren’s syndrome (n=1), coronary artery disease (n=1), end stage renal disease
(n=1), anemia (n=1) or hypothyroidism (n=1) showed HE4 values higher than 140
pmol/L. Approximately 46.7% of all subjects diagnosed with CHF presented with
Elecsys HE4 values higher than 140 pmol/L.

Among patients with malignant conditions, those with EOC, bladder cancer and lung
cancer showed the largest proportion of Elecsys HE4 values higher than 140 pmol/L.
Four different cancer entities revealed values higher than 1500 pmol/L: Epithelial
Ovarian (19), Bladder (3), Breast (2) and Endometrial (1). The post-menopausal EOC
group represented the largest group with elevated HE4 values (17.3% at >1500 pmol/L).
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
