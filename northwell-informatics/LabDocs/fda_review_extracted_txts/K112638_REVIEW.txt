K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None were referenced
L. Test Principle:
The Nova Max One Glucose Monitor measures glucose electrochemically. The glucose
biosensor is capable of recognizing the glucose present in whole blood or control
solutions by virtue of the glucose specificity of the enzyme glucose dehydrogenase
(GDH) present on the glucose test strip. The electrons liberated by this reaction are
transferred via a co-factor and mediator to the meter where they are read as a small
electrical current. The current is integrated over the analysis time to generate charge
which is directly proportional to the level of the glucose in the applied sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Day-to-day precision was evaluated using 3 levels of aqueous glucose control
solutions (33-53 mg/dL, 77-104 mg/dL and 232-313 mg/dL), 3 lots of test
strips and 2 meters. Each level was tested twice daily for 20 days on each
meter for a total of 80 tests per glucose level per lot of test strips. The results
are summarized below:
Day-to-day:
Lot Mean SD Mean CV% Mean CV%
(n=80) (n=80) (n=80)

2 43.1 1.8 91.4 2.8 275.6 2.7
3 43.0 2.6 91.5 3.1 270.2 1.9
The within-run precision study was performed using venous whole blood
samples spiked to create 5 concentration levels of blood glucose (50-100
mg/dL, 100-200 mg/dL, 200-300 mg/dL, 300-400 mg/dL and 500-600
mg/dL). Three lots of test strips and 5 meters were used in the study, with 4
tests performed on each meter for a total of 20 tests per blood glucose level
per test strip lot. The results are summarized below:

The sponsor also evaluated the within-run precision of the device using 3
levels of aqueous glucose control solutions (33-53 mg/dL, 77-104 mg/dL and
232-313 mg/dL). The results are summarized below:

3 42.5 2.7 91.7 2.3 270.8 2.2
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor performed linearity studies using venous whole blood samples
with 7 levels of blood glucose (15-30 mg/dL, 40-60 mg/dL, 80-110 mg/dL,
180-210 mg/dL, 280-310 mg/dL, 480-510 and 570-620 mg/dL) covering the
measuring range (18 to 605 mg/dL) of the proposed device. Three lots of test
strips and 5 meters were used in the study with 2 tests per glucose level per lot
performed on each meter. The YSI-2300 glucose analyzer was used as the
reference method. Linear regression analysis for each test strip lot is
summarized below:
Lot 1 y = 1.0023x – 0.2922, r2 = 0.9995
Lot 2 y = 1.0012x – 0.2569, r2 = 0.9997
Lot 3 y = 1.0007x – 0.3039, r2 = 0.9997
The sponsor claims that the device is linear from 20 - 600 mg/dL. The
measuring range of the device is 20 - 600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The glucose measurements are traceable to D-glucose (NIST SRM 917B).
The control solutions are identical in composition to those cleared under
k070255. The only difference is that they have been renamed to Nova Max
Control Solutions (Levels 1, 2, 3).
Stability Studies: The sponsor performed stability studies for the test strips.
The protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
The sponsor claims a closed-vial (shelf life) of 24 months when strips are stored
at 15 to 30 °C and open-vial stability of 90 days when strips are stored at 15 to
30 °C.
d. Detection limit:
See linearity study.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed interference studies using spiked venous whole blood
samples at three glucose concentrations (50 – 100, 250 – 350 and 450 - 550
mg/dL). Each potential interfering substance was evaluated at 2
concentrations at each glucose level along with the corresponding control (un-
dosed) sample. Each sample was tested once on 5 meters. The sponsor
defined no interference if the bias (difference between the dosed sample and
5

included with the kit). When a test strip is inserted into the meter, each control
can be measured by following the instructions for “Running Control Solution”
provided in the user’s manual. An acceptable range for each control level is

on the test strip vial, the user is instructed to contact Customer Service (available
24 hours a day, 7 days a week).
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Infection control: This device is intended for single-patient use. Disinfection
efficacy studies (viral efficacy studies) were performed by an outside service to
evaluate the virus elimination effectiveness of disinfecting wipes in preventing the
spread of bloodborne pathogens, particularly hepatitis B virus (HBV). Specifically,
Clorox Germicidal Wipes (EPA registration #67619-12) were validated
demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus. The sponsor also performed
robustness studies and demonstrated that there was no change in the performance or
the external materials of the meters after 1095 cleaning and disinfection cycles
designed to simulate 3 years of weekly cleaning and disinfecting. The sponsor also
performed robustness studies and demonstrated that there was no deterioration in the
performance or the external materials of the lancing device following 300 cleaning
and disinfection cycles designed to simulate 3 years of weekly cleaning and
disinfecting. Labeling has been reviewed for adequate instructions in validated
cleaning and disinfection procedures.
Hematocrit Study:
A study to evaluate the effect of hematocrit was conducted on samples with 4 glucose
concentrations (50-80 mg/dL, 100-150 mg/dL, 250 to 350 mg/dL and 450-550
mg/dL) at 11 hematocrit levels from 20% to 70% (with hematocrit increasing in 5%
increments). Each glucose level/hematocrit combination was tested in duplicate on 5
meters using 3 lots of test strips. Results of samples at each hematocrit level were
compared to the corresponding YSI value. The sponsor claims a hematocrit range of
25 to 65%. The study protocol and data were found adequate to support the sponsor’s
claim.
Altitude study: An altitude study was performed in an altitude simulation chamber
with venous blood samples with 3 glucose concentrations (50-100 mg/dL, 200-300
9

--- Page 10 ---
mg/dL and 450-550 mg/dL) using 3 meters and 3 lots of test strips. The study
protocol and data were reviewed and found to be adequate. The sponsor claims that
an altitude up to 10,000 feet does not affect the test results of the proposed device.
Sample volume study: Sample volume studies were conducted with venous blood
samples (45-65 mg/dL, 80-120 mg/dL, 200-250 mg/dL and 450-550 mg/dL) spanning
the measuring range of the proposed device using 4 meters and 3 lots of test strips.
The sponsor evaluated the following sample volumes: 0.30µl, 0.35µl, 0.40µl, 0.45µl
and 0.50µl. The study protocol and data across the entire measuring range were
provided and found adequate to support the sponsor’s claim that a minimum of 0.40µl
of sample volume are required for this system.
Test system operating conditions: Temperature and humidity studies were conducted
with venous blood samples (50-100 mg/dL, 200-300 mg/dL and 450-550 mg/dL) and
aqueous control solutions (levels 1, 2 and 3) spanning the measuring range of the
proposed device using 5 meters and 3 lots of test strips. The sponsor evaluated the
following environmental conditions, 5ºC and 10% relative humidity (RH), 25ºC and
50% RH and 50ºC and 90% RH. A subsequent study was performed with venous
blood samples (45-65 mg/dL, 75-100 mg/dL, 200-300 mg/dL and 450-550 mg/dL)
and aqueous control solutions (level 1, 2 and 3) spanning the measuring range of the
proposed device using 5 meters and 3 lots of test strips. The sponsor evaluated the
following environmental conditions, 5ºC and 90% RH, 25ºC and 50% RH and 50ºC
and 10% RH. The study protocol and data across the entire measuring range were
provided and found to be adequate.
Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and electrical safety testing: EMC testing was
evaluated and certified by The Compliance Management Group.

and states that the owner’s guide, strip insert and control insert are written at the 8th
grade level or below based on Flesch-Kincaid Readability Assessment.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
