L. Test Principle:
The On Call Vivid Blood Glucose Monitoring System uses glucose oxidase enzyme
chemistry as the standard dry reagent assay for glucose in whole blood. This enzyme
assay, with a redox chemical “mediator” reaction, is used to generate an electrical
current proportional to the glucose concentration in the blood sample. The system is
designed as an amperometric measurement device using current generated for the redox
reaction as the measureable response.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run precision was measured by using heparinized venous whole blood as
the anti-coagulant at five different glucose concentrations. Each blood sample
was adjusted to a 42% ± 2% hematocrit level and verified by a hematocrit
reader. Each sample was tested on 3 lots of test strips on 10 meters. Ten
replicates were tested per meter, test strip lot, and glucose concentration,
(N=100 per glucose concentration tested). Results are summarized below:
Glucose Level S trip Lot Mean (mg/dL) SD (mg/dL) %CV

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity study was designed following CLSI EP6-A guideline. Venous
whole blood samples were drawn and spiked to target analyte levels. Eleven
target levels were prepared with glucose stock solutions to glucose
concentrations ranging from 10 to 650 mg/dL (10, 25, 50, 80, 110, 170, 220,
330, 450, 550, 650). All samples were also tested on a YSI analyzer to generate
the expected values. The observed values were plotted against an average of the
expected values and an appropriate line fitted by standard linear regression was
generated with results summarized below:
Strip Lot Slope Intercept R2
1 0.9998 4.2445 0.9992
2 1.0202 2.8045 0.9989
3 1.0318 2.3263 0.9990
The sponsor’s claimed measurement range for glucose is 20 -600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: On Call ® Vivid Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to
the NIST SRM 917b reference material.
Value assignment:
The value assignment of the On Call Vivid Blood Glucose control solutions
were determined by an in-house procedure. The control solutions were prepared
by gravimetric addition of glucose to achieve target values of 120 mg/dL for
level 1 and 350 mg/dL for level 2 and values were confirmed by the YSI
method. Verification of the control solutions were tested with 240 test strips
and 2 meters with each level and the target ranges were set at the following:
Glucose control solution Target Concentration Acceptable range
Level 1 (medium) 120 mg/dL 120 ± 20% (96 – 144
mg/dL)
Level 2 (high) 350 mg/dL 280 – 420 mg/dL (280 – 420
mg/dL)
Stability:
Accelerated stability studies were conducted to assess the shelf – life and open

vial stability of the control solutions and test strips. Real-time stability studies
are still on-going. Unopened control solutions have a 24 month shelf life and
are stable for 6 months after first opening when stored at 5-30ºC (41-86ºF). The
sponsor claims that the unopened test strips have a 24 month shelf life and are
stable for 6 months after first opening when stored at 25-30ºC (77-86ºF). This
information is provided in the labeling of the test strips and control solution
materials.
d. Detection limit:
See linearity study above.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor states that the interference study was designed according to CLSI
EP7-A2 guideline. Common endogenous and exogenous interference
substances were evaluated by spiking venous whole blood (collected in tubes
containing heparin) with three levels glucose concentrations (level 1 : 40 – 60
mg/dL, Level 2: 80 – 120 mg/dL, Level 3: 300 – 400 mg/dL).
The glucose samples were spiked with the potentially interfering compounds
and tested on 3 lots of test strips. Each glucose concentration was evaluated at a
low and a high concentration of the interfering substances. Bias was calculated
as the difference between the test and control concentration groups. The
following tables show the test concentrations for each potential interfering
substance:

Ascorbic acid levels > 3 mg/dL will interfere with the glucose reading;
therefore, the sponsor has the following limitation in their labeling.
“Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) ≤3 mg/dL does not significantly affect results.

System accuracy study:
This study was conducted following guidance from the ISO Standard
15197:2003(E). This study was designed using 105 participants. A
trained technician collected fingersticks, palm, and forearm sticks on
each participant. Capillary samples were collected and measured on the
YSI 2300 analyzer (reference method) and from the same fingersticks,
the On Call Vivid BGMS was tested in duplicate (using the first result
obtained for analysis) using three different test strip lots. Samples
containing <50 mg/dL of glucose were allowed to glycolyze and to
obtain sample values >400 mg/dL, samples were spiked with a glucose
stock solution. The range of samples tested was 40.0 to 562.5 mg/dL for
fingertip samples and 48.1 to 444.0 mg/dL (according to YSI) for palm
and forearm samples. Regression analysis is summarized below:

5. Calibration:
There is no calibration required for the On Call Vivid meter by the user. The
meter is plasma-calibrated.
6. Quality Control:
Glucose control solutions at two different concentrations can be run with this
device. The meter has an algorithm to automatically recognize the control
solutions to prevent control results from being stored in the internal memory as
patient result. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are
provided in the labeling. The control solution readings are not included in the
average of the patient results. An acceptable range for each control level is printed
on the test strip vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control
result falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Altitude Study :
This study was conducted at a single site to evaluate the effect of altitude on the On
Call Vivid BGMS. The tested glucose range (obtained using YSI reference
method) was from 41.7 to 567 mg/dL at sea level and 35.7 to 525 mg/dL at 8,516 ft
above sea level. Fingerstick blood samples were collected and compared to the YSI
analyzer reference value. These blood samples were evaluated using both the On
Call Vivid BGMS and a YSI glucose analyzer. Each test strip glucose value was
compared to the YSI method and then analyzed as a percent bias. The glucose
values obtained using the On Call Vivid blood glucose meter had acceptable biases
to support the altitude claim of 8,516 feet.
2. Hematocrit Study –
The sponsor performed hematocrit studies using 8 different hematocrit (20, 25, 30,
40, 50, 60, 65, and 70%) levels across the glucose measuring range (target glucose
concentrations 50, 100, 275, and 500 mg/dL). 3 test strip lots were evaluated and
compared to the YSI method. The results support the sponsor’s claimed hematocrit
range of 20 – 70%.
3. Temperature and Relative Humidity Study:
Operating Conditions Study:
In this study, three test strip lots were tested at 7 combined temperature and
relative humidity conditions (5ºC/10% RH, 21 ºC/ 10% RH, 45 ºC/10%, 5 ºC/90%
RH, 21 ºC/ 90% RH, 45 ºC/ 90% RH, and 21 ºC/ 45% RH). Each sample was
also compared to the YSI reference method. Three blood samples were adjusted
to the following glucose concentration levels: (40-60 mg/dL, 80-120 mg/dL, 500-
550 mg/dL) The results demonstrate that accurate readings can obtained after
17

exposure to temperatures ranging from 5 - 45ºC and relative humidity conditions
ranging from 10 – 90%.
4. EMC Electromagnetic Compatibility and Electrical Safety verification testing of
the On Call Vivid Blood Glucose Monitoring System was performed following
the requirements of ISO 15197:2003 (E).
The following consumer cautionary statement is provided in the user’s manual:
“All Glucose Systems Preventive Warnings with Regard to EMC:
• This instrument complies with the emission and immunity requirements. The
requirements are described in EN61326-1 and EN61326-2-6. Do not use this
instrument in close proximity to sources of strong electromagnetic radiation.
These may interfere with proper operation of the meter.”
5. Sample volume study:
Acon performed a sample volume study to demonstrate that 0.8µL of whole blood
is sufficient volume for the On Call Vivid blood glucose meter system. For this
study, sample volumes ranging from 0.4µL – 1.0 µL were evaluated using three
different lots of test strips. The blood glucose sample results collected using the
On Call Vivid blood glucose meter were compared with glucose values obtained
with the YSI reference method and supported the minimum sample volume claim
of 0.8 µL.
6. Infection control:
The device system is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy
studies were performed on the materials comprising the meter and lancing device
by an outside commercial testing demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis
B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, (DisCide Wipes) Quaternary
Ammonium/Isopropyl Alcohol disinfectant wipe (EPA Reg. No. 10492-4).
Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there
was not change in performance or external materials of the meter and lancing
device after 3,285 times of cleaning and disinfection cycles, using (DisCide
Wipes) Quaternary Ammonium/Isopropyl Alcohol disinfectant wipes, to simulate
3 years of use by layusers. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for
the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
7. Readability:
The readability of the labeling (user guides, test strip package insert and control
18

solution package insert) using a Flesch-Kincaid analysis and were found to be
written at the 7th grade level.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
