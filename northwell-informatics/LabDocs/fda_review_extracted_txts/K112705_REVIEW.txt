I. Device Description:
The Audit® MicroLQ™ Serum Protein Control is a human serum-based protein
control mixture. The base matrix is human serum. This is the starting matrix for
building the two sets of controls: Low (Level 1) and High (Level 2) Controls. Both
sets of controls contain the following analytes: Immunoglobulin E (IgE),
Immunoglobulin M (IgM), Immunoglobulin G (IgG), Immunoglobulin A (IgA),
Prealbumin, Antithrombin III, Alpha-1-Antitrypsin (AAT), Albumin, Complement C4
(C4), Complement C3 (C3), alpha-2-Macroglobulin, Alpha-1-Acid Glycoprotein,
Ceruloplasmin, Transferrin, Haptoglobin, and Beta-2-Microglobulin. The Level 1 set
contains lower levels of each analyte (except for beta-2-microglobulin) and the Level
2 set contains higher levels of each analyte.
The product is kitted as bi-level control with three 2-mL vials for each level, for a
total of 6 vials.

Traceability
The analytes used in this control material are human derived materials
obtained from commercial vendors and QC tested in-house.
Value assignment
Each analyte value assignment for Level 1 and Level 2 was performed on the
Beckman Immage 800 analyzer. All 16 analytes have been cleared for use
with the Beckman Immage analyzer. Each analyte was measured 15 times
(over a three-day period) and the mean value of each analyte was used to
establish target concentration values at each level. The target ranges were
calculated as +15% of the target value. Expected value ranges for Level 1 and
Level 2 of each analyte are shown in the table below. There is no Level 1
value for Beta-2-Microglobulin.

Stability
A stability/shelf-life claim of 3 years at 2-8oC was determined based on an
accelerated stability study on two lots of material. All vials that were used for
stressed stability studies were first stressed in the incubator for 30 days, after
which time the vials were opened, left at room temperature for 15 minutes,
closed and left for 30 minutes at 2-8oC. The percent loss was determined in
comparison to Day Zero values and the product is considered stable when the
loss reported is < 15% loss. Confirmatory real-time stability tests are ongoing.
There is no specific claim in the product labeling for on-board vial stability.
After opening, the contents should be used according to the instrument
manufacturer’s instructions and immediately returned to 2-8°C. The control
material should not be left in the instrument and should be recapped and
returned to the refrigerator after each use.
