L. Test Principle:
The LIAISON® 25 OH Vitamin D assay is a direct competitive
chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) for quantitative determination of total
25 OH vitamin D in serum. During the first incubation, 25 OH Vitamin D is
dissociated from its binding protein and binds to the specific antibody on the solid
phase. After 10 minutes the tracer, (vitamin D linked to an isoluminol derivative)
is added. After a second 10 minute incubation, the unbound material is removed
with a wash cycle. Subsequently, the starter reagents are added to initiate a flash
chemiluminescent reaction. The light signal is measured by a photomultiplier as
relative light units (RLU) and is inversely proportional to the concentration of 25
OH vitamin D present in calibrators, controls, or samples.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Performance was evaluated on the LIAISON® Analyzer.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A twenty day reproducibility/precision validation study was performed at
DiaSorin Inc. and 2 external sites, on one LIAISON® Analyzer per site.
Samples included a coded panel of 2 low, 2 medium, 1 moderately high,
and 1 high Vitamin D concentration serum samples. The LIAISON® 25
OH Vitamin D TOTAL serum controls (2 levels) also were included in the
study. Samples and kit controls were tested on two lots of modified

assay’s full measuring range of 4 – 150 ng/mL. Each dilution was
analyzed in replicates of 4 with one lot of the modified Vitamin D Assay
on one LIAISON® Analyzer.
Expected c oncentrations for the dilutions were determined by (Vitamin D
value of high pool) x (dilution factor).
The results were analyzed by simple linear regression (slope, intercept and
R2 value) of observed results versus expected results, recovery versus
expected concentrations, and the linear, second degree and third degree
polynomial fits of the data. Results are shown below for the three
analyses:

These results support the sponsor’s claimed measuring range of 4 to 150
ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
Calibrators and control materials were cleared under k071480
d. Detection limit:

between 4.0 and 150 ng/mL. The lowest reportable value is 4.0 ng/mL
which is based on an inter-assay precision ≤ 20% CV. Values below 4.0
ng/mL are reported as < 4.0 ng/mL.,
The sponsor performed a detection limit study to support their low end
measuring range claim. For LoB and LoD determination, study was
performed on 4 reagent lots on each of the 2 analyzers and 30 replicates of
zero calibrator and 20 replicates of Calibrator A were evaluated. The LoD
was calculated to be 2 ng/mL. For LoQ determination, 8 samples with
concentrations above the LoD were tested on three reagent lots and 2
analyzers, with 5 replicates per sample i.e., n=30). The LoQ was
calculated to be 4 ng/mL based on an inter-assay precision of ≤ 20% CV.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity:
Aliquots of samples of low, moderate and high Vitamin D were spiked
with 25 OH D metabolites. Vitamin D concentrations were near 10, 30,
and 70 ng/mL. Metabolite concentrations of 30 ng/mL and 100 ng/mL
were spiked into the vitamin D samples and analyzed. Percent Cross-
Reactivity was determined based on:
(Measured Value/Concentration Spiked)*100
Cross-reactivity results are shown below:
25 OH D 100%

25 OH D3 100%
Vitamin D2 1.9%
Vitamin D3 1.9%
1,25-(OH)2-Vitamin D2 6.7%
1,25-(OH)2-Vitamin D3 9.3%
3-epi-25OH Vitamin D3 1.3%
Interference:
Vitamin D samples containing concentrations of 30 ng/mL and 60 ng/mL
were spiked with hemoglobin, triglycerides, cholesterol, and bilirubin, uric
acid, albumin, and IgG. Replicate samples (n=6 for each test and control
sample) were tested and results were compared to control samples without
the potentially interfering substances added. The highest concentrations at
which no interference, or minimal interference (defined by the sponsor as
≤ 10% bias relative to the control) are shown below.
300 mg/dL cholesterol
590 mg/dL triglycerides
20 mg/dL uric acid

12.9 g/dL human serum albumin

The sponsor has the following limitations in the labeling:
The limitations section states that heterophilic antibodies in human serum
can react with reagent immunoglobulins or other reagent material,
interfering with in vitro immunoassays.
The specimen collection section states that hemolyzed or grossly lipemic
samples should not be used.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable – this is a quantitative assay.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Serum samples from a reference laboratory spanning the assay range
(N=587) were tested with the modified LIAISON® 25 OH Vitamin D
TOTAL Assay and the DiaSorin 25-hydroxyVitamin D 125I RIA
(k983617). The samples, ranging in concentration from 4 to 150 ng/mL
spanned the claimed measuring range of the modified assay. Only neat
patient samples (no spiked samples) were used in the study.
Results of regression analysis are presented in the following table.
N Slope Intercept Correlation range Mean Bias SD of
(95% CI) (95% CI) Coefficient (ng/mL) differences
(ng/mL)

(1.02 – 1.07) (1.43 – 3.40)
b Matrix comparison:
One hundred thirty seven (137) matched sets of Serum and SST samples
were tested in singlet across 5 LIAISON® Analyzers and 2 lots of the
modified assay. In order to obtain analyte values across the reportable
range of the assay (4 to 140 ng/mL), it was necessary to dilute one sample
and to spike 19 samples with Vitamin D.

4. Clinical cut-off:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
A new reference range study was performed for the modified assay in
accordance with CLSI Guideline C28-A2. Participant enrollment took place
at four sites in the contiguous US, representing a wide distribution of sun
strength: northern, southern, and central US. Blood collection occurred over
two seasons, with 136 collected from 3 sites during the winter months
(February and March) and 260 collected from 4 sites during the summer
months (June, July and August).
The collection was conducted on adults (ages 21 – 90 years) in summer and
winter, including light and dark skin individuals, and males and females.
Three hundred and ninety six (396) samples met the inclusion/exclusion
criteria and were tested with the modified LIAISON® 25 OH Vitamin D
TOTAL Assay.
The determination of apparently healthy for this study was based on the
following definition:
· Normal serum levels of:
o Total calcium
o Intact parathyroid hormone (PTH)
o Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)
