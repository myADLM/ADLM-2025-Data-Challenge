The Audit® MicroLQTM Spinal Fluid Control is a human based, liquid set of QC
material. Each level of the set contains Chloride, Glucose, Immunoglobulin A (IgA),
Immunoglobulin G (IgG), Immunoglobulin M (IgM), Lactate, Lactate Dehydogenase
(LD), Microalbumin, Microprotein, and Sodium analytes. It is used to confirm the
proper calibration of Chloride, Glucose, Immunoglobulin A (IgA), Immunoglobulin
G (IgG), Immunoglobulin M (IgM), Lactate, Lactate Dehydrogenase (LD),
Microalbumin, Microprotein, and Sodium
All human source materials used to produce this product have been tested for HbsAg,
anti-HCV, HIV-1 and HIV-2 and found to be non-reactive by FDA cleared/approved
tests.

L. Test Principle:
Not applicable.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
All components of the The Audit® MicroLQTM Spinal Fluid Control are
obtained from a commercial vendor and inspected in-house.
Stability
Shelf life and open vial stability:
Real-time testing at 2-8ºC was conducted and is still on-going. The stability
study protocol and acceptance criteria have been reviewed and found to be
acceptable. The current accelerated stability test results and ongoing real time
stability studies support two year shelf life stability and 30 days open vial
stability when stored at 2-8ºC.
Value Assignment
The control ranges as determined using Beckman Immage 800 analyzer for
Immunoglobulin A, Immunoglobulin G, and Immunoglobulin M and Roche
Modular-P analyzer for Chloride, Glucose, Lactate, Lactate Dehydrogenase,
Microalbumin, Microprotein, and Sodium are provided in the assigned value
sheet for each lot release. Values were assigned from replicate measurements
as ± 15% CV around the mean. Representative values are shown in the table
below.
In the labeling the sponsor recommends that each end user laboratory
establish its own means and acceptable ranges and use the assigned value
sheet as guidance only.
