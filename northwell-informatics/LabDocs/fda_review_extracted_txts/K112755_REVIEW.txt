DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
k112755
B. Purpose for Submission:
New device
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Diatron US Inc., Abacus 5
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Quantitative test for WBC, NEU%, NEU#, LYM%, LYM#, MON%, MON#, EOS%,
EOS#, BAS%, BAS#, RBC, HGB, HCT, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDWcv, RDWsd,
PLT, and MPV parameters.
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Abacus 5 is a fully automated bench-top hematology analyzer featuring a
color touch screen display with a user interface capable of reporting 21
hematology parameters including CBC with a five-part WBC differential. The
analyzer is supplied with specialized reagents including Diluent, Lyse, Diff and
Cleaner. An optional Autosampler is available for automated processing of up to
100 sample tubes for increased laboratory efficiency. The main analyzer, data
module, and display station are housed as a single unit. The Abacus 5 analyzer’s
software system supports the use of commonly used external printers via USB
connections.
2. Principles of Operation:
The Abacus 5 analyzer uses volumetric impedance to determine the cellular
concentrations and volume distributions of WBC, RBC, and PLT. The HGB
concentration is determined by photometric measurement of light absorbance.
Optical measurement of light scattering and diffraction is used to determine the
five-part leukocyte differential parameters. The MCV and RDW values are derived
from statistical analysis of the RBC histogram. The HCT, MCH, and MCHC are
calculated values. The MPV value is derived from statistical analysis of the PLT
histogram.
3. Modes of Operation:
The Abacus 5 operates in both open and closed sample tube mode.
4. Specimen Identification:
The sample ID can be entered by the operator from a keyboard or hand held
barcode reader for a manually processed specimen. For automatically processed
specimens, the sample ID can be read from a sample tube barcode or entered into
a list for one of the automatic processing list modes.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Manually presented whole blood K EDTA sample tubes must be mixed properly
3
prior to specimen analysis. Sample tubes are placed into a tube adapter inserted
1

--- Page 2 ---
on the sample rotor for closed vial or open vial single tube manual sample
processing. A minimum of 30 minutes should elapse between collection of the
blood sample and analysis on the Abacus 5 to ensure that the interaction of blood
and anticoagulant has fully stabilized.
6. Calibration:
The Abacus 5 analyzer calibration process consists of running a commercial
calibrator material multiple times. The calibration procedure ends when three or
seven accepted calibration replicates are completed. The known calibrator
parameter values and the average values of multiple runs are used to calculate
calibration factors. Diatron recommends performing calibration at installation,
when indicated by quality control, after major maintenance or service, and at
periodic time intervals as directed by laboratory regulatory agencies.
7. Quality Control:
Diatron recommends the use of CBC-3K controls from R&D Systems to verify
performance of the Abacus 5. Perform quality control at intervals established by
the laboratory or as required by laboratory accreditation, licensing, or regulatory
agencies.

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
The Abacus 5 repeatability evaluation was conducted using 22 human blood
samples and three levels of control. The samples were selectively chosen to
span the analytical measuring range and to be close to clinical decision points
on two Abacus 5 instruments. A minimum of 15 and a maximum of 21
replicates were run for each sample.
The following tables represent reproducibility and intermediate precision
using commercial controls. Two replicates of low, normal, and high control
samples were run twice per day at three different sites for 20 working days.
The data from three instruments was analyzed to determine the overall mean
and precision for between-site, between-day, within-day, and within-device.

c. Linearity:
The analytical measuring range (AMR) was established by analyzing dilutions
made from manipulated whole human blood or from commercial linearity kit
material. In order to demonstrate that each parameter is within the claimed
performance, a minimum of 9 proportional dilutions spanning the reportable
range were run in triplicate on two Abacus 5 analyzers. The high
concentration sample is diluted with low concentration sample to create seven
intermediate proportional dilutions. All of the eight linearity runs produced
coefficients of determination (r2) >0.95 for each measurand. The following
parameters are linear within the stated AMR:
Measurand Units AMR
WBC 103/μL 0.21 – 100.0
HGB g/dL 1.1 – 22.2
RBC 106/μL 0.36 – 7.19
PLT 103/μL 16 – 1000
d. Carryover:
Carryover was determined using three Abacus 5 analyzers by running whole
blood specimens with high target values (HTV) of WBC, RBC, HGB, and
PLT. Each specimen was run in triplicate followed by three aspirations of
whole blood specimens with low target values (LTV). Carryover % was

calculated by using the following equation: % Carryover = (LTV1 − LTV3) ∕
(HTV1 − LTV3) x 100. The maximum carryover for WBC, RBC, HGB, and
PLT are 1.00%, 0.50%, 0.80%, and 1.00% respectively. The upper 95%
confidence intervals (CI) of the carryover point estimates for each parameter

e. Interfering Substances:
Test samples are created by adding interfering substances to normal samples
such as bilirubin and lipids based on CLSI EP07-A2. Other evaluations were
made by finding naturally occurring human blood samples with potential
interferences such as high WBC, platelet abnormalities and NRBCs. A bias of
5% or more was considered clinically significant in the directly measured
parameters. Two Abacus 5 instruments were used in the evaluation of
interfering substances. Measurands were not impacted by bilirubin up to 30
mg/dL. The following parameters were affected by interference from NRBC,
PLT clumps/large PLT, increased WBC, and lipids (see table below):
Parameter Interference
WBC > 5 NRBCs/100 WBCs , PLT clumps/large PLTs
RBC WBC Count > 75.0 x103/μL
MCV WBC Count > 75.0 x103/μL
PLT PLT clumps/large PLTs
Hemoglobin WBC count > 75.0 x103/μL , Lipids > 280 mg/dL
Differential > 5 NRBCs/100 WBCs , PLT clumps/large PLTs
f. Background Counts:
Daily Start-up background counts were performed on the Abacus 5 and were
verified by each site against the specifications. Start-up background
specifications were achieved before data collection. The Abacus 5
background specifications are as follows:
Background

The parameters selected for this evaluation are the directly measured
parameters (WBC, RBC, HGB, PLT), the optically measured parameters
(NEU%, LYM%, MON%, EOS%, BAS%) and the derived parameters (MCV,
RDWcv, MPV). A total of 10 normal and six abnormal K EDTA
3
anticoagulated human whole blood samples were analyzed on two Abacus 5
instruments at 0.5 hours after venipuncture and at various time intervals
thereafter. The averages of the parameters at each time point were compared
to the baseline averages. The results support sample stability at room
temperature (20 - 23°C) of 7 hours.
b. Comparison of open and closed vial sampling:
A minimum of 31 K EDTA anticoagulated human blood samples spanning
3
the reportable range were used in the study. The specimens were run in
closed vial cap pierce mode (selected as the reference as per CLSI H26-A2)
and compared to the open vial mode and to the Autosampler automatic
processing mode. The testing demonstrated that the Abacus 5 will process
specimens using open and closed mode sampling in the same manner.
c. Reference ranges:
Evaluation of reference ranges for the Abacus 5 instrument was conducted
using a data set of 240 normal human whole blood samples collected at the
US site. Of these 240 samples, 120 were from female patients and 120 were
from male patients. The manufacturer recommends each laboratory establish
its own reference range.

d. Determination of lower limits of detection and quantitation:
The lower limit of detection (LLoD) and the lower limit of quantitation
(LLoQ) of WBC and PLT were quantified as per CLSI H26-A2 section 5.8.
To determine LLoD, 12 blank runs were collected daily over five days (total
60 blank runs) on two instruments using alternating operators. The values of
WBC and PLT for these blank runs are analyzed to determine the LLoD.
Once the LLoD is calculated, five low level specimens are run over a period
of five days. One specimen was run each day using alternating operators.
Twelve replicates per specimen were collected for a total of 60 replicates.
The CVs of each dilution of WBC and PLT were analyzed to determine the
LLoQ of each.
