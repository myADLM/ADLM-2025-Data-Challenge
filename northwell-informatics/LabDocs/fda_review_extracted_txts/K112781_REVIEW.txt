The xTAG® Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) is a qualitative nucleic acid multiplex
test intended for the simultaneous detection and identification of multiple
respiratory virus nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal swabs from individuals
suspected of respiratory tract infections. The following virus types and subtypes
are identified using RVP: Influenza A, Influenza B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus
subtype A, Respiratory Syncytial Virus subtype B, Parainfluenza 1, Parainfluenza
2, and Parainfluenza 3 virus, Human Metapneumovirus, Rhinovirus, and
Adenovirus. The detection and identification of specific viral nucleic acids from
individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of respiratory infection aids in the
diagnosis of respiratory viral infection if used in conjunction with other clinical
and laboratory findings.
xTAG® RVP can also differentiate the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of some
Influenza A subtypes H1 and H3 strains. Differentiation of Influenza A HA
subtypes is based on both a positive result for the Influenza A matrix gene and an
accompanying positive result for the Influenza A HA subtype H1 (circulating
prior to the emergence of 2009 H1N1 pdm) or Influenza A HA subtype H3. This
device cannot differentiate the Influenza A HA subtype 2009 H1N1 pdm by
design, and may not be able to differentiate potential newly emerging Influenza A
HA subtypes.
Positive results do not rule out bacterial infection, or co-infection with other
viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease. The use of
additional laboratory testing (e.g. bacterial culture, immunofluorescence,
radiography) and clinical presentation must be taken into consideration in order to
obtain the final diagnosis of respiratory viral infection.
Negative results do not preclude respiratory virus infection and should not be used
as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other patient management decisions.
The RVP assay cannot adequately detect Adenovirus species C, or serotypes 7a
and 41. It is recommended that specimens found to be negative for Adenovirus
after examination using RVP be confirmed by an alternate method (e.g., FDA
cleared molecular test or cell culture). The RVP primers for detection of
rhinovirus cross-react with enterovirus. A rhinovirus reactive result should be
confirmed by an alternate method (e.g. cell culture).
Performance characteristics for Influenza A virus were established when
Influenza A HA subtype H3, subtype H1 (prior to the emergence of 2009 H1N1
pdm), and when subtype 2009 H1N1 pdm were the predominant Influenza A in
circulation. When other Influenza A viruses are emerging, performance
characteristics may vary.
If infections with a novel Influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical
and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities,
specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for
2

novel virulent Influenza viruses and sent to a state or local health department for
testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+
facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

hemagglutinin gene target (specify hemagglutinin target detected, e.g. H1 (prior
to circulation of Influenza A 2009 H1N1pdm), or H3).
NOTE: After the 2010-2011 season, when seasonal H1N1 has not been in
circulation (following the emergency of 2009 H1N1pdm in 2009-2010), a
positive RVP result for an Influenza A H1 should be verified using
epidemiological information available through influenza surveillance programs.
· Positive for type (i.e., Influenza A), and negative or equivocal for hemagglutinin
(HA) subtype. In the event that RVP positively identifies the Influenza A matrix
gene target but fails to identify an HA gene target, this requires follow up. This
result can be indicative of a device or user error, a known Influenza A HA
subtype in circulation that the RVP can not differentiate by design (such as
Influenza A HA subtype 2009 H1N1 pdm), or a novel Influenza A HA subtype.
The end user should follow up with further testing and use the following
algorithm:
a. To rule out device or user error, retest the sample with RVP from the
extraction step with external controls for these analytes. Run sample extract in
duplicate. In the case where the re-test on both replicates does not yield a
positive HA subtype result and external controls are properly typed, further
follow-up is required.
b. If a known Influenza A HA subtype is suspected and can not be differentiated
by the assay (such as Influenza A HA subtype 2009 H1N1 pdm), the
laboratory should test the sample with an alternative method to identify
specific Influenza subtypes when required to definitively characterize
Influenza A infections. If the sample still can not be characterized by the
alternative method, that necessitates immediate notification of the appropriate
local, state, or federal public health authorities to determine the necessary
measures for verification of results.
· A "No Call" due to an equivocal or invalid result, should not be reported but re-
tested as per recommendations. The re-test result should be considered the final
RVP result for that analyte.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
See k063765
xTAG® RVP was modified to improve reactivity to influenza A/H3 strains. No
differences between the modified and the original xTAG® RVP were observed in
cross-reactivity and analytical reactivity studies.
a. Detection limits:
5

--- Page 6 ---
See k063765
xTAG® RVP was modified to improve reactivity to influenza A/H3 strains. The
limits of detection (LoDs) of all the analytes for the modified RVP assay were
identical to the original RVP assay, except for the influenza A/H3 analyte. The
modified RVP demonstrated increased analytical sensitivity detecting the
hemagglutinin gene of certain influenza A/H3 strains when compared to the
original device.

18 of 22 replicates made the correct influenza A matrix POS call with the original xTAG
RVP. The remaining 4 replicates displayed MFI values of 226, 295, 249, and 219, just
below the cut-off value of 300, thus generating “No Call” results for Influenza A matrix.
2. Comparison studies:
Clinical Comparison Results
xTAG® RVP was modified to improve reactivity to influenza A/H3 strains and
performance was evaluated by comparing the modified assay to the original RVP
assay testing retrospective left-over clinical samples (nasopharyngeal swabs)
collected from 14 clinical sites in the United States and Canada, primarily from
the 2010-2011 influenza season.
All Influenza A matrix positive samples from either the original or modified
xTAG® RVP were bi-directionally sequenced for influenza A subtype H3. In
total, 158 influenza A positive samples by either the original or the modified
xTAG® RVP were sequenced first using alternate primers outside of the kit
primer binding region. All negative results with the first primer set were then re-
sequenced using additional sequencing primers also outside the kit primer binding
region. In addition, samples with discordant calls between the original and
modified device were sequenced for the analyte(s) in question.
Positive agreement and negative agreement for each analyte were evaluated
between the original and modified xTAG RVP devices (see Table 2).
