L. Test Principle:
Bound or dimerized homocysteine (HCT) (oxidized form) is reduced to free HCT,
which then reacts with serine catalyzed by cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) to form
cystathionine. Cystathionine is then broken down by cystathionine beta-lyase (CBL)
to form HCT, pyruvate, and ammonia. Pyruvate is then converted by lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) to lactate with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) as a
coenzyme. The rate of NADH conversion to NAD+ is directly proportional to the
concentration of HCT (Δ A340 nm).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies on the Synchron LX 20 Pro and the UniCel DxC600 were

and three human plasma samples were assayed using two lots of reagents, in
replicates of two, in two runs per day for 20 days on one instrument (n = 80).

Validation for out-of-range specimens
Three EDTA samples with approximate HCT levels of 90, 150, and 500
μmol/L were used for manual dilution recovery of out-of-range samples. All
three levels were first diluted using a 1:9 dilution factor and measured on the
reference instrument (Olympus AU400) to establish a baseline. The neat
samples were then measured on the Synchron LX 20 Pro and Unicel DxC 600
in replicates of two and the mean was calculated to demonstrate the need for
dilution at very high HCT levels. The neat samples were then diluted with a
factor of 1:2 (for the 90 and 150 μmol/L levels) and a factor of 1:9 (for the
500 μmol/L level). The % recoveries for the samples when corrected by the
dilution factors were within 10 % of the reference instrument values. The
sponsor included the following in the package insert with regard to high levels
of HCT: The linear range of the 3-Reagent Homocysteine Assay for Synchron
LX 20 Pro and UniCel DxC 600 when run as directed is 1-50 µmol/L.
Specimens > 50 µmol/L should be diluted 1 part specimen to 2 parts Cal 0
µmol/L or 1 part specimen to 9 parts Cal 0 µmol/L as appropriate.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrators were cleared under k083222 and are included in the kit.
d. Detection limit:
The determination of LoB and LoD followed guidance from CLSI document
EP17-A. A zero calibrator was used to determine LoB. For the LoD
estimation, five EDTA plasma samples were prepared with a concentration
between LoB and 4x LoB. Samples were diluted in the zero calibrator to
obtain the required concentrations and confirmed by testing on the Olympus
AU400.
Limit of Blank
For the Synchron LX 20 Pro and Unicel DxC 600, 20 replicates of the zero
calibrator were run using each reagent lot on each of 3 days (n = 60 for each
reagent lot), i.e. 1 run per day for each lot of reagents and calibrators. The
results are summarized in the table below.
Limit of Detection
For the Synchron LX 20 Pro and Unicel DxC 600, five replicates of each of
the five low level homocysteine samples were run with each reagent lot on
each of three separate days (n = 75 for each reagent lot) i.e. 1 run per day for
each lot of reagents and calibrators. The results are summarized in the table
below.

The linearity studies and detection limit studies support the sponsor’s claimed
measuring range of 1.0 to 50 μmol/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
The studies for interfering substances were carried out according to the CLSI
document EP7-A2. Control samples were in the medically important range of
12 -18 μmol/L. Each control sample was tested in replicates of five to
determine a homocysteine baseline. Each control sample was then spiked
with the relevant interfering compound up to the concentrations indicated in
the table below. All samples were tested in replicates of five. No significant
interference was defined as a difference of less than ±10% of the control
value.
The summary data is below:

Bilirubin 20 mg/dL 20 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 554 mg/dL 500 mg/dL
Triglyceride 1500 mg/dL 1000 mg/dL

Cysteine 400 μmol/L 200 μmol/L
Pyruvate 1704 μmol/L 1250 μmol/L

Other limitations:
· Cystathionine is measured with homocysteine, but in the general
population the cystathionine level (0.065 to 0.3 μmol/L) has a negligible
effect. In very rare cases, end stage renal disease and patients with severe
metabolic disturbances, cystathionine levels may rise dramatically and in
severe cases cause greater than 20% interference.
· Carbamazepine, methotrexate, phenytoin, nitrous oxide, or 6 azauridine
triacetate may affect the homocysteine concentration
· Specimens from patients on drug therapy involving S-adenosyl-

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Fifty EDTA plasma samples were tested in the method comparison study. Of
the 50 samples, 10 were spiked with L-homocysteine to obtain samples across
the assay range. The samples were assayed in singlicate. The correlation of
the candidate device used on the Synchron LX 20 Pro and Unicel DxC 600 to
the predicate device on the Olympus AU400 was determined using Passing-
Bablok method. The correlation coefficient was determined using Pearson
Correlation. The summary of results is below:

b. Matrix comparison:
Each of EDTA plasma, heparin plasma, serum, and serum separator tube types
were used to collect samples from 23 in-house volunteers. Samples were
divided into three concentration ranges: 1-10 μmol/L, 10 – 20 μmol/L, and 20
– 50 μmol/L. Samples in the range 20 – 50 μmol/L were spiked. Each sample
from all four tube types was tested in duplicate on the Unicel DxC 600 with
one lot of the reagent and calibrators. The first set of individual
concentrations of the replicates of each sample was used for analysis, along
with the percent recovery. The first set of the individual replicate values for
each sample was calculated to be ±10% of the EDTA Sample control tube
type. Each of the four collection tube types is considered suitable for use.
