H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indications(s) for use:
The Omega Laboratories Hair Drug Screening Assay for Cocaine and Cocaine
Metabolites (Cocaine) is a laboratory developed test that is intended to be used for the
qualitative determination of the presence of Cocaine in human hair from the head. The
Omega Laboratories Hair Drug Screening Assay Cocaine utilizes the International
Diagnostics Systems Corp. One-Step enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for
Cocaine Testing Kit, for the qualitative detection of Cocaine at or above 500 pg/mg of
hair for the purpose of identifying the use of Cocaine. To confirm a screen positive result,
a more specific alternate chemical method, such as Gas Chromatography/Mass
Spectrometry (GC/MS) operating in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode is the
preferred method with deuterated internal standards. Professional judgment should be
applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when presumptive positive results are
obtained.
This laboratory developed test is intended exclusively for in-house laboratory use only
and is not intended for sale to anyone. Omega offers this laboratory developed test as a
service to its clients.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative
chemical method (e.g. LC/MS/MS) must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result.
Other chemical confirmation methods are available. Clinical consideration and
professional judgment must be applied to the interpretation of any drug-of-abuse test
result.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Confirmation testing is performed using an Agilent 6890 Series Gas
Chromatograph/Agilent 5973 Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) operation in the selected ion
monitoring mode using a deuterated internal standard. MSD Chemstation™ software is
used for data collection and analysis.
I. Device Description:
Donor samples are collected using the Omega Collection Kit. The Donor Sample is shipped
to the Company facility where testing is conducted by trained scientists under the direction
of the Laboratory Director. This submission accepts Donor Samples from trained external
sources and does not conduct any Point of Care Testing (Home testing) or on-site testing
(pre-employment, insurance, court ordered, employment random screening etc.).

The assay consists of two parts; a pre-analytical hair treatment procedure (to extract cocaine
from the solid hair matrix to a measurable liquid matrix), and the screening assay. The
screening assay is an Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA).
The Hair Drug Screening Assay for Cocaine uses the International Diagnostic Systems Corp
(IDS) One-Step ELISA Cocaine micro-plate/reagents and a micro-plate reader for the
qualitative detection of Cocaine in hair samples. The test system consists of micro strip
plates coated with rabbit anti-BE polyclonal antibody, enzyme conjugate (horseradish
peroxidase conjugated to cocaine), substrate (containing tetramethylbenzidine), and wash
solution. Cut off concentration is 500 pg/mg hair.

L. Test Principle:
Approximately 10-15 mg of the test sample is used for the assay. The test sample is
pulverized and then extracted under heat with acidified methanol. After cooling, the test
sample is centrifuged/dried and then reconstituted in 0.1% BSA/BPBS buffer. The resulting
solution is applied directly to the IDS ELISA
The prepared hair sample is added to a well of the micro strip plate and enzyme conjugate is
added, followed by incubation. During this phase the enzyme-labeled drug conjugate
competes with drug in the sample for a limited number of binding sites on the rabbit anti-BE
polyclonal antibody-coated micro wells. The two bind in proportion to their concentrations.
A wash solution is applied to remove any unbound materials. Enzyme substrate solution
containing a chromagen is added. The reaction is stopped with an acid and the absorbance is
read using a plate reader at 450 nm. Color intensity is inversely proportional to the amount
of drug present in the sample.
The only materials provided to a client (the requestor of the test) is the Sample Collection
Kit. None of the laboratory materials, reagents or equipment is shipped or used outside of
Omega’s laboratory facilities. Specifically, the Calibrator and Controls used in the Cocaine
Assay are prepared for in-house use and none are shipped to clients or use by untrained non-
professionals.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The intra-assay precision study was performed by taking eleven replicates of negative
hair samples spiked with ±25%, ±50%, and 100% of the 500 pg/mg hair cut-off value
(corresponding to 125, 250, 375, 500, 625, 750, 875, and 1000 pg/mg). The material
used to spike the hair sample was commercially available cocaine in methanol. This
study was done in one run on one day with one lot of the screening assay. A summary
of the results is presented in the tables below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable, the assay is intended for qualitative use
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Omega laboratories utilized in house prepared calibrator and control solutions.
Cocaine in methanol is commercially purchased and used to make stock solutions that
are used to prepare working solutions. The assigned values of the calibrator and
control stock solutions are verified by GC/MS analysis against a current validated
GC/MS calibrator solution each time a batch is prepared. The calibrator and control
must fall within 10% of the target concentration. The commercial material is
traceable to NIST.
Stability
Control Solution: Cocaine in methanol is stable for a period of six months when stored in
an amber bottle and refrigerated. The acceptance criteria were that the cocaine value of
the control solution had to be within 10% of the target value of 500 pg/mg after six
months.
Hair: Storage of hair samples was studied by placing fifty hair samples that were
previously tested in a collection kit for 2 years at 14-30°C. A variety of hair color and
curvatures were tested. The study showed that the mean variance in cocaine
concentration was -23% over two years.
A shipping study was performed to determine whether there were any adverse effects on
hair samples when exposed to extreme temperatures and variations in humidity that might
occur during sample shipment. Eight shipping boxes containing 25 known positive and
negative samples were stored at approximately -13°C for about 15 hours and then were
heated to 47°C for about 6 hours. Each box was then shipped to a different location, held
for two days and sent back to the lab. The returned samples were screened and
quantitatively tested using GC/MS. A variety of hair color and curvatures were tested.
No hair samples had discordant results when returned and therefore it was determined

that there were no adverse effects on hair samples when exposed to extreme temperatures
and humidity variations when being shipped.
Expected Values
The calibrator should be 500 pg/mg and the controls should be 250 pg/mg and 1000
pg/mg of hair.
d. Detection limit:
See Precision/Reproducibility section in M1.a above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Specificity and cross-reactivity was performed by adding compounds to negative hair
samples. 10,000 ng/mL of 270 unrelated compounds were spiked into drug-free hair,
-50%, +125%, and +150% of cut-off cocaine-spiked hair. The result was compared to
the control which contained 500 pg/mL cocaine (cut-off). The following compounds
were found to interfere in the assay.

Additionally, inhibition curves for structurally similar compounds were generated. Serial
dilutions of each control compound were prepared in negative hair matrix extract. The
concentration of the structurally related compound that gave a similar absorbance to the
cut-off (500 pg/mg) cocaine control was determined and the percent cross reactivity was
calculated. The results were as follows:

Environmental Contamination Study
Preliminary positive hair sample results by the screening method could be due to
environmental contamination. All positive should be sent for confirmation testing on a
reference method to distinguish between true positive and those samples that were
positive due to external exposure.
f. Assay cut-off:
The Assay cut-off is 500 pg cocaine/mg hair. Analytical performance of the device
around the claimed cutoff is described in the precision section M.1a above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison was performed by testing 345 hair samples with the
candidate and comparing to the reference method, GC/MS. Each specimen was
divided into two aliquots and one was used fro screening and the other for GC/MS
confirmation. The results were:
