L. Test Principle:
The assay combines a two-step enzyme immunoassay sandwich method with a final
fluorescent detection step (ELFA).
All assay steps are performed automatically by the instrument. The sample is
transferred into the well of the Solid Phase Receptacle (SPR) containing an alkaline-
phosphatase labeled anti-FbDP monoclonal antibody. The sample/conjugate mixture
is cycled in and out of the SPR several times to increase the reaction speed. The
antigen in the sample binds to the antibodies coated on the SPR and to the conjugate.
The remaining free antigen sites are then saturated by cycling the conjugate in the
fifth well of the reagent strip in and out of the SPR. Unbound components are
eliminated during the washing steps.
Substrate is then cycled in and out of the SPR. The conjugate catalyzes the
hydrolysis of the substrate into a fluorescent product that is measured at 450 nm. The
intensity of the fluorescence is proportional to the concentration of antigen present in
the sample. Results are automatically calculated in relation to the calibration curve
stored in memory.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision study was performed per CLSI EP5-A2, Evaluation of Precision
Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods, Approved Guideline-
Second Edition. Three samples prepared from pooled human citrated plasma
were tested at three sites using two VIDAS and one miniVIDAS instruments.
Analyte concentrations included all medically relevant levels with target
concentrations of 277.97 ng/mL FEU, 544.14 ng/mL FEU and 7788.88 ng/mL
FEU. Testing was performed twice a day, in duplicate over 40 runs (n=240)
at three sites. Two lots of reagent were included in the studies.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed per CLSI EP6-A guideline, April 2003,
Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A
Statistical Approach. Two VIDAS D-Dimer Exclusion II assay lots were
tested on two VIDAS instruments. Nine samples were prepared by mixing a
high concentration FbDP (above 10,000 ng/mL FEU) of human citrated
plasma with a low concentration FbDP (below 45 ng/mL FEU) sample in
varying ratios.
Each sample was tested in triplicate in random order in the same single run.
Results showed that deviation from linearity was within ± 12% at each analyte
level which met the established acceptance criteria. The VIDAS D-Dimer
Exclusion II assay was found to be linear from 45 to 10,000 ng/mL FEU.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
VIDAS D-Dimer Exclusion II Assay was standardized using the VIDAS D-
Dimer Exclusion Assay to provide metrological traceability of the calibration
and controls. A reference standard was created by measuring samples with
the VIDAS D-Dimer Exclusion Assay. A panel of working standards and
adjustment panel traceable to the reference standards were consequently used

to assign values to the final calibrator and control material.
Real time shelf life stability was determined for three lots of assay reagents
and controls and calibrators. Thermal shocks were performed during the first
3 months of stability testing to mimic differences in temperature the kit could
encounter during transport. The results are within acceptance criteria based
on the inter kit-lot precision profile (+/-13.3% to 20.7%) and support a shelf-
life of 12 months at 2-8°C.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation
(LoQ) were determined according to CLSI EP17-A, Guideline, October 2004;
Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of
Quantitation. Two lots of VIDAS D-Dimer Exclusion II were tested on two
VIDAS instruments using 6 human citrated plasma samples (1/90 dilution of
patient sample in D-Dimer Exclusion II diluent, five low-level samples).
With each lot, the blank sample was tested in 12 replicates in a single run per
day for 5 days on one VIDAS system. Each low-level sample was tested in 4
replicates in a single run per day for 5 days on one VIDAS instrument. The
LoD was determined to be 16.471 ng/mL FEU, LoB 7.406 ng/mL FEU, and
LoQ 29 ng/mL FEU.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were conducted according to CLSI EP7-A2. Varying
concentrations of hemoglobin (5 g/L), lipids (30 g/L), bilirubin (0.35 g/L), and
albumin (60 g/L) were spiked into aliquots of 3 human plasma pools
corresponding to 3 medical decision levels of D-Dimer (7500 ng/mL FEU,
500 ng/mL FEU, and 250 ng/mL FEU) and tested with 2 assay lots on one
VIDAS instrument.
Interference studies were also conducted using the same human plasma pools
for 47 drugs at the concentrations indicated in the table below.

blood samples submitted to the laboratory for routine D-Dimer measurements.
Samples were from hospitalized patients or outpatients at three clinical sites.
Samples were tested in singlicate with both VIDAS D-Dimer Exclusion II ref
30455 or VIDAS D-Dimer Exclusion ref 30442 over a minimum of 5 days on
two VIDAS and one miniVIDAS instruments. Two lots of reagent were used
at each participating site. The bias between the VIDAS D-Dimer Exclusion II
ref 30455 and the VIDAS D-Dimer Exclusion ref 30442 at different analyte
levels was determined according to CLSI EP9-A2. Linear regression analysis
results by Passing- Bablok analysis are summarized in the table below.
Sample Level Sample Level Bias(%) Confidence Interval
Value (ng/mL) (95%)
Low 250 5.0% [2.0%; 8.1%]

High 3000 18.2% [14.5%; 22.0%]
b. Matrix comparison:
i. Samples collected in sodium citrate vs. CTAD
Two blood draws from 124 donors were collected into one tube
containing sodium citrate and one containing CTAD (0.109M sodium
citrate, theophyline, adenosine, dipyridamole) each. Eighteen (18)
contrived samples with higher D-Dimer concentrations were also
included in the study. The paired samples were tested with the VIDAS
D-Dimer Exclusion Assay II assay in singlicate. The D-Dimer
concentrations observed ranged from 54.5 ng/mL – 7053.5 ng/mL for
the CTAD tube collected samples and from 47.7 ng/mL-6730.2 ng/mL
for the sodium citrate tubes. The slope and intercept Passing and Bablok
regression was used to calculate the relationship between the two sample
matrices. The following bias estimates were derived:
Sample Level Sample Level Bias (%) Confidence Interval
Value (ng/mL) (95%)
Low 250 -0.7% [-1.4%;2.8%]
Medical Decision Level 500 -0.8% [-4.2%; 2.6%]
High 3000 -2.0% [-5.8%; 1.7%]
ii. Samples collected in 3.2% vs. 3.8% sodium citrate
Blood was collected from 91 donors into two blood collection tubes, one
containing 3.2% sodium citrate, and the other containing 3.8% sodium
citrate. Samples from each tube were analyzed using the DEX2 assay.
Eighteen (18) additional donor samples were spiked to create high D-
Dimer concentrations. The resulting 109 samples were tested in singlet.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Clinical studies were performed on banked, frozen samples collected from
patients suspected of VTE from previous VTE monitoring studies. Sample
stability was assessed with the D-Dimer Exclusion assay ref. 30442 by
comparison with results obtained prior to freezing (fresh specimen). The
results of the stability study were found to be acceptable.
Confirmation of DVT was done by objective testing (e.g. serial compression
ultrasound, CT scans, etc. according to physician request) and a 3-month
individual follow-up. Overall prevalence of VTE in the total study population
was 23.5% (74/315). Two lots each of VIDAS D-Dimer Exclusion II and
VIDAS D-Dimer Exclusion reagents were included in the study.
The sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values (NPV and
PPV) were determined using a clinical cut-off of 500 ng/mL FEU.

b. Clinical specificity:
See section 3a.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
4. Clinical cut-off:
500 ng/mL FEU
5. Expected values:
215 fresh citrated plasma samples collected from blood donors were tested on
four VIDAS instruments using three VIDAS D-Dimer Exclusion II assay lots.
After assay recalibration, each sample was tested in singlicate.
Total number of blood donors 215
Number of donors with D-Dimer value <500 ng/mL 193
Percentage of donors with D-Dimer value <500 ng/mL 90%
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
