Stability:
Carbon Dioxide Standard Kit:
Five (5) lots of carbon dioxide standards (5 levels, A through E) were
evaluated at t=15 months and compared to a reference control. The standards
used for the study were freshly prepared using standards stored for 15 months.
The results of this study support the sponsor’s claimed stability of 15 months
when stored at 2-8ºC.
Urine Chemistry Standard Kit:
Five (5) lots of urine chemistry standards (5 levels, A through E) were
evaluated at t= 19 months and compared to a reference control. The standards
used for the study were freshly prepared using standards stored for 19 months.
The results of this study support the sponsor’s claimed stability of 19 months
when stored at 2-8ºC.
Electrolyte Standard Kit:
Five (5) lots of sodium, potassium, chloride, and lithium standards (5 serum
levels of each analyte and 5 urine levels of sodium, potassium, and chloride)
and five (5) lots of carbon dioxide standards (5 levels) were evaluated and
compared to a reference control. The standards used for the study were
freshly prepared for each standard type. The results of this study support a
stability of 24 months for serum, 19 months for urine, and 15 months for CO2
when stored at 2-8 ºC.
Additionally, five (5) lots of ionized calcium standards were evaluated at five
(5) concentration levels and compared to a reference control. The standards
used for the study were freshly prepared from storage. The results of this
study supports a stability of 20 months when stored at 2-8ºC.
Cholesterol Standard Kit:
Five (5) lots of cholesterol standards (5 levels, 40 – 500 mg/dL) were
evaluated at t=30 months and compared to a reference control. The standards
used for the study were freshly prepared using standards stored for 30 months.
The results of this study support the sponsor’s claimed stability of 30 months
when stored at 2-8ºC.
Uric Acid Standard Kit:
Five (5) lots of uric acid standards (5 levels, 2.0 – 22.0 mg/dL) were evaluated
at t=26 months and compared to a reference control. The standards used for
the study were freshly prepared using standards stored for 26 months. The

results of this study support the sponsor’s claimed stability of 26 months when
stored at 2-8ºC.
ISE Standard Kit:
Five (5) lots of sodium, potassium, chloride, lithium, magnesium, and calcium
standards (5 levels of each analyte) were evaluated at t=24 months and
compared to a reference control. The standards used for the study were
freshly prepared using standards stored for 24 months. The results of this
study support the sponsor’s claimed stability of 24 months when stored at 2-
8ºC.
ISE Standard (S4):
One (1) lot of sodium, potassium, chloride, and CO2 (1 level at a single
concentration of each analyte) were evaluated at t=16 months and compared
to a reference control. The standards used for the study were freshly prepared
using standards stored for 16 months. The results of this study support the
sponsor’s claimed stability of 16 months when stored at 2-28ºC.
Multi Chemistry Standard Kit:
Five (5) lots of standard kits containing five levels of the following analytes:
creatinine, glucose, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, triglyceride,
and urea nitrogen at t=24 months for each analyte except for phosphorus (t=21
months) and compared to a reference control. The results of this study
support the sponsor’s claimed stability of 21 months for when stored at 2-8º
