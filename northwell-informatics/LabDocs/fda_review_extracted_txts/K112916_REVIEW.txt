1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability studies were performed on the TysonBio MD100 using 5 levels of
spiked EDTA venous whole blood with hematocrits of approximately 42%. The
samples were spiked with β-D-glucose to concentrations from approximately 42
mg/dL to 357 mg/dL. Glucose concentrations were determined by the YSI 2300
glucose analyzer. Samples were tested 10 times using 10 meters (n=100 total) with
each level of blood sample using 3 lots of test strips. Results are summarized below:

Based on the results of this study, the measuring range was determined to be 20-600

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The method comparison study was performed using the candidate
device and the YSI as the reference method (see section M.2.a.). The MD100
and MD100 Pro are autocoding meters.
Control Value Assignment: The three levels of glucose control solutions are
analyzed on the YSI 2300 which has been calibrated with NIST traceable
materials. Value assignment is based on testing the control materials on
multiple meters and test strip lots. The protocols were reviewed and found to
be adequate.
Stability:
MD100 Test Strips: Real time and accelerated stability studies were performed for
MD100 test strips to assess the shelf-life and open-vial stability. Stability
studies protocol and acceptance criteria for open and unopened vials were
provided and found to be adequate to support the labeling claims of 3 months
for open vial stability when stored tightly closed between 39°F and 86°F (4°C
and 30°C) and18 month shelf life for unopened vials when stored between
39°F and 86°F (4°C and 30°C).
MD100 Control Solutions: Real time stability studies were performed on open and
closed vials at three control levels. Stability studies protocol and acceptance
criteria for open and unopened vials were provided and found to be adequate
to support the labeling claims of 3 months for open vial stability when stored
tightly closed between 39°F and 86°F (4°C and 30°C) and18 month shelf life
for unopened vials when stored between 39°F and 86°F (4°C and 30°C).
d. Detection limit:
See linearity study above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Specificity studies were performed using venous whole blood samples with glucose
concentrations of 70-90 mg/dL and 200-285 mg/dL. The low and high glucose

ranged from 10-70%. Samples were analyzed on 3 lots of MD100 test systems and
the YSI. Sample distribution, linear regression and agreement with the YSI are
presented below:

14

--- Page 15 ---
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip, palm, or
forearm, or venous whole blood. Samples are applied to directly to the test strip.
5. Calibration:
No calibration is performed by the user. The calibration code is included on each test
strip and is read when the test strip is inserted into the meter.
6. Quality Control:
There are 3 levels of glucose control solutions available separately. Level 2 is provided
with the start up kit. Recommendations for the frequency of quality control testing are
provided in the labeling. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test
strip vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls
outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. EMC testing was evaluated and certified by Aerospace Industrial Development
Corporation and a certificate of compliance was issued to Tyson Bioresearch, Inc on
Aug. 20, 2010.
2. Drop tests and vibration tests were conducted and results analyzed pre and post testing
with the firm’s electronic check strip. The sponsor provided the test report to confirm that
vibration tests were conducted on 20 meters at maximum vibration intensity (60 Hz) for
45 minutes. The drop test was conducted at approximately 24 and 35 inches and 30
meters were dropped in 6 different orientations. Results of the MD100 Blood Glucose
Meter showed that the changes with the electronic check strip before and after challenge
were reviewed and deemed acceptable.
3. Sample volume testing was performed with venous whole blood spiked with glucose to
yield concentrations of 43.7, 71.4, 146, 254, 374, and 468 mg/dL as determined by the
YSI 2300. 10 measurements were obtained from 10 meters and 3 test strip lots using 0.4,
0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 micL of sample for each glucose concentration. The mean was
calculated for each glucose concentration. The data supports the sponsor’s recommended
sample volume of 0.5 mcL.
4. Altitude studies were performed using 5 venous whole blood and adjusting the glucose
concentration by spiking or glycosylation. Glucose concentrations ranged from 44-360
mg/dL. Samples were tested 10 times on 5 glucose meters and the YSI at 164 ft, 7545 ft,
and 9875 ft. The percent bias was calculated against the YSI and the results were found
to support the sponsor claims that the MD100/MD100 Pro meter can be used at altitudes
up to 7545 ft.
15

--- Page 16 ---
5. Operating Stability: The MD100 glucose meter and test strips were stored together at
various combined temperature and humidity conditions to simulate real time operating
conditions. Temperature conditions ranged from 10°C - 40°C (50°F-104°F) and 10%-
90% relative humidity (RH). Three whole blood samples with glucose concentrations
ranging from 70-300 mg/dL were tested with the stored meters and strips. Results were
compared to the YSI and met the pre-determined acceptance criteria of ± 10 mg/dL for
samples < 75 mg/dL and less than 10% bias for samples ≥ 75 mg/dL. The data supports
the claimed operating temperature and humidity ranges of 10°C - 40°C (50°F-104°F) and
10%-90%, respectively.
6. A study was conducted to evaluate the potential interference from hematocrit. Seven
different hematocrit levels ranging from 10-70% (10%, 20%, 30%, 42%, 50%, 60%,
70%) were evaluated and at 4 glucose concentrations (~ 50 mg/dL, ~ 100 mg/dL, ~ 288
mg/dL and ~500 mg/dL). Each sample was tested on 5 meters in singlicate. The
differences of the glucose meter results at each hematocrit/glucose combination were
calculated against YSI-2300 Glucose Analyzer results at 42% hematocrit.
7. Usability Study: For the user performance study summarized in section M.3.c above, the
participants were asked to complete a questionnaire to evaluate the ease of use of the
device and the clarity of the English language labeling. Overall the users indicated that
they could successfully perform the test and that the user manual was written clearly.
8. A separate usability study was performed for downloading glucose meter results to a
personal computer. The study participants were males and females of various ages and
educational backgrounds. Users found the software easy to use.
9. Readability Assessment: The sponsor performed a readability assessment of the labeling for
the MD100 and MD100 Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems. The labeling is written
below a 7th grade level according to the Flesch Kincaid assessment tool.
10. Customer Service number: 1-800-948-3894 available 24 hrs, 7 days a week. An address
and website are also provided.
11. Disinfection: The device is intended for single (MD100) and multiple (MD100 Pro)
patient use. Cavicide Surface Disinfectant with EPA registration # 46781-6 was validated
demonstrating complete inactivation of live hepatitis B virus for use with the materials
comprising the meter and lancing device. The sponsor demonstrated that there was no
change in performance or in the external materials of the meter after 36,500 cleaning and
disinfection cycles designed to simulate cleaning and disinfection 20 times a day, over 5
years of device use. The sponsor also demonstrated that there was no change in
performance or in the external materials of the lancing device for single-patient use after
7,300 cleaning and disinfection cycles designed to simulate cleaning and disinfection 4
times a day, over 5 years of device use. The lancing device is only for use with the
single-patient use system. Labeling has been reviewed for adequate instructions in
validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
