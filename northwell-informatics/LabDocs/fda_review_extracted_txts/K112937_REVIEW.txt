H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
MRSA/SA ELITe MGB® is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test for the direct detection
of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
using DNA purified from nasal swabs. MRSA/SA ELITe MGB® is intended to aid in the
prevention and control of MRSA infections in healthcare settings. It is not intended to
diagnose, guide or monitor MRSA infections, or provide results of susceptibility to
oxacillin/methicillin. A negative result does not preclude MRSA/SA (Staphylococcus
aureus) nasal colonization. Concomitant cultures are necessary to recover organisms for
epidemiological typing or for further susceptibility testing.

assay for the in vitro qualitative detection of MRSA and SA DNA extracted from
human nasal swab samples. In this system, sample preparation and amplification/real-
time detection are completed on separate instruments. Sample processing is completed
on the bioMérieux NucliSENS® easyMAG® instrument with bioMérieux NucliSENS
Nucleic Acid Extraction Reagents according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Following processing, the extracted sample is placed in the well of a 96 well plate to
which “monoreagent” is added. The monoreagent contains the primers and probes for
the genes of interest and the internal control combined with master mix. The assay is
performed on an Applied Biosystems 7500 FAST Dx System that consists of the 7500
FAST Dx instrument, a personal computer, 96-well plates and seals. A Negative
Specimen Processing Control and a Positive Specimen Processing Control are
recommended to be run in each extraction run. The design of the assay includes
systems to identify both the gene responsible for methicillin resistance and for a
conserved portion of a gene unique to S. aureus. Thus, for a true “MRSA,” both targets
will be identified in roughly equal proportions. Results are determined by using an
algorithm that compares Ct values output from the cycler.
Instrument:
The Applied Biosystems (AB) 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instrument integrates a
thermal cycler, a fluorimeter and application specific software. The instrument houses
the thermal cycler and the fluorimeter, while the application software is run on a PC
that is attached to the instrument. Samples are placed in a tube strip or 96-well low-
head space plate that is moved to a Peltier-based thermal block and positioned relative
to the optics using a tray loading mechanism. Excitation for all samples is provided by a
halogen tungsten white source that passes through 5 switchable excitation filters prior
to reaching the sample.
Fluorescence emission is then detected through a 5 color emissions filter wheel to a
charge coupled device (CCD) camera. The instrument is designed to complete
quantitative RT-PCR runs in about 40 minutes. The Sequence Detection Software
(SDS) version 1.4 for the 7500 Fast Dx Instrument is used for instrument control, data
collection and data analysis. The software can measure cycle-by-cycle real-time signals
from the sample. The software provides a variety of tools to help the user analyze the
data extracted from the samples. The software also provides lamp-life monitoring and
other instrument maintenance information. The software runs as an application on
Windows XP platform. Changes to the Dx software are subject to change control in
®
accordance with 21 CFR Part 820.40.

resistance gene. Presence of both markers at the same relative quantity measured by a
difference in cycle threshold (Ct) value is indicative of MRSA; different relative quantities or
presence of only Staphylococcus aureus-specific gene marker is indicative of SA.
Detection of MRSA/SA with the MRSA/SA ELITe MGB® relies on two major processes:
Specimen preparation by automated DNA extraction from nasal swabs and Real-time PCR
amplification and detection of target DNA by specific hybridization probes.
Each nasal swab is inserted into a tube with trypticase soy broth and thoroughly mixed to
create a cell suspension which is then subjected to automated DNA extraction using the
NucliSENS® easyMAG® instrument. Internal control plasmid template is added to the silica
solution to act as a control for the extraction process and monitor for PCR inhibitors.
The processed specimens and the MRSA/SA ELITe MGB® PCR Mix containing hot-start
non-Taq thermostable DNA polymerase are placed in the Applied Biosystems® 7500 Fast Dx
Real-Time PCR Instrument PCR plate for amplification and detection. The ELITe MGB®
Probes detect amplified target through a hybridization-triggered fluorescent mechanism.
When the probe is unbound in solution, the three-dimensional conformation brings the
quencher and MGB in close proximity to the fluorescent label, quenching the fluorescence.
When the probe anneals to a target sequence, the probe unfolds, spatially separating the
quencher from the fluorescent label to allow a strong fluorescent signal. ELITe MGB®
Probes are not degraded during the amplification. The probe specific to the SA-specific gene
is labeled with AP554 fluorophore (similar to TAMRA).The probe specific to the mecA gene
is labeled with FAM fluorophore. The probe specific to the Internal Control is labeled with
AP642 fluorophore (similar to Cy5). The Applied Biosystems® 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time
PCR Instrument monitors simultaneously the fluorescence emitted by each probe. Following
PCR, the results are interpreted to provide a final call.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was performed using a panel of 10 specimens with varying
concentrations of MRSA and MSSA in a simulated nasal matrix was tested. Two MRSA
strains (ATCC BAA-1556 and BAA-1720) and one MSSA strain (BAA-12600) were
used. Simulated matrix contained human genomic DNA and mucin to imitate a normal
human nasal matrix. For each MRSA/MSSA strain the panel included negative member,
specimen below the limit of detection, LoD (expected to yield a positivity rate of between
20 to 80%), low positive (at LoD, expected to yield a 95% positivity rate), and moderate
positive (three times LoD, expected to have 100% positivity rate). Each of the two
operators performed one run per day for 12 days on three reagent lots at one site. In two
other sites two runs per day on one reagent lot were performed for 5 days (10 specimens
x 3 replicates x 5 days x 2 runs). The negative panel member yielded negative results
100%, the below LoD specimens positivity rate was 77%, the low positive specimen
positivity rate was 98%, and the moderate positive panel members positivity rate was
100%.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The MRSA/SA ELITe MGB® includes a non-infectious plasmid DNA which serves
as an internal control.
Positive specimen processing control (PSPC; MRSA strain) and negative specimen
processing controls (NSPC; S. epidermidis) were tested daily. The PSPC Methicillin-
resistant S. aureus ATCC BAA-1556 was tested at 3xLOD per swab. The NSPC S.
epidermidis ATCC 12228 was tested at 1 x 107 CFU/mL in simulated nasal matrix.
If a PCR run included samples processed during several days, the corresponding
processing controls were included in the run. A separate MSSA strain was not tested
because the MRSA strain includes SA marker (ldh1).
External Controls may be used in accordance with accrediting institutions and
government regulations. External Controls are not provided in the test kit; however,
the outside source and the catalog numbers are provided in the “Materials
Recommended but Not Provided” section of the Package Insert.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Detection Study
The analytical sensitivity of the MRSA/SA ELITe MGB® was determined using one
strain of S. aureus and five strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA).
Cultures of these strains were quantified, diluted in simulated nasal matrix to values
spanning the range of approximately 5 to 1500 colonies forming units (CFU) and
absorbed onto swabs. All dilutions were tested, and the limit of detection (LoD) was
determined by Probit analysis. LoD for each strain represents the lowest number of
7

CFU/swab at which a positive result will be obtained with at least 95% confidence.
The LoD was then verified by testing 20 replicates at estimated LoD levels for each
strain. Results were analyzed by StatisPro software for each (mecA and “SA”)
detector separately. The results from this study indicate that the MRSA/SA ELITe
MGB® will produce a positive MRSA/SA result for over 95% of the time at LoD
range of 90-220 CFU/swab with an average LoD of 165 CFU/swab. Details are
shown in the table below:

Effect of Increasing Concentrations of MSSA or MRCoNS on MRSA detection
at the LoD level
The potential competitive inhibitory effect of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus
(MSSA) or methicillin-resistant coagulase negative Staphylococci (MRCoNS) on
MRSA at the established LoD level, was evaluated by spiking specimens with
increasing amounts of MSSA or MRCoNS (21 samples for both series for each
MRSA to MSSA/MRCoNS ratio: 1:1, 1:10, 1:102, 1:103, 1:104, 1:105and1:106).
Seven control samples with no interfering strains were also used for the study.
Results show that Cq (Ct) values for each challenged detector (“SA” and mecA) were
not significantly different (%CV<5) for every ratio examined indicating absence of
inhibition of one target at LoD level by excess of another. The study demonstrated
that detection of each target (mecA or “SA”) is not impaired by increasing amounts of
another target up to 1:106 ratio.
Analytical Inclusivity
The MRSA/SA ELITe MGB assay correctly identified all 76 well-characterized
MRSA and SA strains, as well as all MRSA/SA strains with high and low MIC values
from the challenge panel. MRSE strains were not detected because of the absence of

the “SA” gene. BORSA strains were not detected because the genome of these
organisms does not have the SCCmec element, which carries the mecA gene.
A total of 76 well characterized MRSA and MSSA isolates were tested using the
MRSA/SA ELITe MGB® assay. The isolates were representative of the global genetic
diversity, including clonal complexes and sequence types as well as various Pulse-
Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) types (e.g. USA100, 200, 300 and 400) and MIC
values, with emphasis on the USA 300 epidemic clones. All strains were absorbed
onto swabs at near detection limit and tested with MRSA/SA ELITe MGB®. In
addition to that all MSSA strains were tested at 106CFU/swab.
All MSSA strains tested positive for SA and negative for MRSA. All MRSA strains
tested positive for MRSA.
Two BORSA (Borderline Oxacillin Resistant S. aureus) isolates that lack mecA tested
SA positive and MRSA negative.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross Reactivity
The specificity of the MRSA/SA ELITe MGB® was evaluated by testing for cross-
reactivity to species phylogenetically related to S. aureus, pathogenic microorganisms
and to microorganisms commonly present in normal nasal microflora. The test panel
consisted of three fungal species, one mycoplasma species, 17 viruses, and 41
bacterial species (16 coagulase negative staphylococcus species, three coagulase
negative Staphylococcus species and 23 other Gram negative and Gram positive
species). The microorganisms were tested as cultures in concentrations of 1x106
CFU/swab for bacterial isolates and 1x105 PFU/swab for viruses. In addition human
cells in a concentration of 106 cells /mL were tested. Human cells and all tested
species were found negative for MRSA and SA with the MRSA/SA ELITe MGB®.
The analytical specificity was 100%.
Two of the potentially interfering organisms tested, Human metapneumovirus
(hMPV) and MRCoNS Staphylococcus epidermidis, strain NRS 34, caused
interference at initial testing resulting in false positive SA but negative MRSA result.
Re-testing of MRCoNS Staphylococcus epidermidis, strain NRS 34 confirmed the
interference results. MRCoNS Staphylococcus epidermidis, strain NRS 34, is
considered to interfere with MRSA/SA ELITe MGB®. This was included as a
limitation in the label.
· MRCoNS Staphylococcus epidermidis when tested in a mix with near-detection-
limit -MRSA resulted in “SA positive, MRSA negative” call.
Re-testing of Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) did not reveal interference of hMPV
with MRSA/SA ELITe MGB®.

--- Page 10 ---
Co-infection
Methicillin Susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) was also tested for microbial interference.
The microorganism was spiked at 1×106 CFU/mL (1×105 PFU/mL), or higher, into a
sample with MRSA strains at near-detection-limit and tested.
· MRCoNS S. epidermidis and MSSA, when tested in a mix with near-detection-
limit of MRSA, resulted in “SA positive, MRSA negative” call.
A limitation statement was added to indicate this finding. None of the other tested
species interfered with MRSA/SA detection.
Evaluation of BORSA Strains
Two BORSA (Borderline Oxacillin Resistant S. aureus) isolates that lack mecA tested SA
positive and MRSA negative in the MRSA/SA ELITe MGB® assay.
Interference Study
Potentially interfering substances that may be found in nasal swabs were tested at their
highest clinically relevant concentrations to determine the effect on the performance of
the assay. Substances tested were chemical substances that can either be naturally
present or that can be artificially introduced into the nasal cavity.
Positive samples (two MRSA strains spiked into simulated nasal matrix near the device
cut off (3×LOD) for each strain) were tested with each of potentially interfering
substance (mucin, human blood, nasal sprays or drops, nasal corticosteroids, nasal gels,
homeopathic relief medicine, live intranasal Influenza virus vaccine, throat lozenges,
oral anesthetic and analgesic, anti-viral drugs, nasal antibiotic ointment, systemic
antibacterial substances) at their highest clinically relevant concentrations to determine
the effect on the performance of the assay. A swab was immersed in an aliquot of
interfering substance (≈200 μL), soaked and then thoroughly rinsed into a 1 mL sample
of TSB. Simulated Nasal Matrix Sample containing 100μL aliquot of 3×LOD of MRSA
ATCC BAA-1556 or MRSA ATCC BAA-1720) was absorbed onto a swab and was
thoroughly rinsed into the test sample of TSB buffer (that already contained the
interferent).
The following substances were tested and evaluated: blood, mucin, phenylephrine
(Neo-synephrine®), oxymetazoline (Dristan®, Zicam®), sodium chloride with
preservatives, benzalkonium chloride, sodium phosphate, phenylcarbinol (Saline),

Carry-Over Contamination
An analytical study was performed to evaluate the potential for cross-contamination
between high MRSA (1×107 CFU per mL) specimens and negative specimens throughout
the MRSA/SA ELITe MGB® workflow. Two operators performed five 24-sample (11
high MRSA samples. 11 negative samples, one positive specimen processing sample and
one negative specimen processing sample per run) extraction runs in a checkerboard
(high MRSA samples interrupted by completely negative samples) pattern. The eluted
samples were then PCR amplified in five separate runs using two different checkerboard
patterns. The MRSA/SA ELITe MGB® failed to pass the cross-contamination design
requirements, resulting in one false positive sample from fifty-five TSB negative
samples. Labeling will report these results as follows: The cross-contamination testing
resulted in zero false negatives from fifty-five high MRSA positive samples and one false
positive sample from fifty-five negative samples.
f. Assay cut-off:
To assess the analytical cut off evaluation study, 106 CFU of MRSA, SA and CNS
cultures were extracted and eluted in 100 μL. Three 10 μL aliquots of each extracted
sample were analyzed by PCR. Average Ct for MRSA and SA (mecA, “SA”) were in the
range 23-24.5. Next, samples were diluted to provide a threshold cycle at 35-36 (2-3 Ct
above the expected cut-off level). Three 3-fold dilutions in 10 replicates of each culture
were analyzed in one PCR run. Analytical assay cut off for each criterion (mecA, “SA”)
was determined by means of appropriate statistical methods.
Ct threshold optimization ~ 39 for mecA was attained by minimizing the amount of false-
positive results for MRSA. Ct threshold optimization ~ 38 for “SA” was attained by
minimizing the amount of false-positive results for MRSA/SA. Delta CT = 1.8835 (~2)
for the Ct range at or near LOD level (33.54 – 39.07).

3. Clinical studies:
Clinical Sensitivity/Specificity:
Performance characteristics of the MRSA/SA ELITe MGB® were determined in a
prospective investigational study at three sites by comparing the MRSA/SA ELITe
MGB® with reference culture which included latex agglutination and susceptibility test.
Nasal swab specimens were collected from three unique geographically diverse
institutions having MRSA culture-based screening programs in place. To be enrolled in
the study, patients had to be eligible for MRSA screening according to the policies of the
respective facilities.
All specimens were inoculated into trypticase soy enrichment broth with 6.5% NaCl and
the results from this testing was used as the reference. The nasal swab was directly
inoculated onto either Remel Spectra MRSA or a BD BBL Chromagar MRSA II.
Following this step, the same swab was subjected to an extraction step in 1 mL of Tryptic
Soy Broth (TSB), vortexed for 10-15 seconds. The entire volume of the cell suspension
was tested using MRSA/SA ELITe MGB. The swab was then placed in TSB with 6.5%
Sodium Chloride for enrichment/subculture to service as a reference testing (subculture
culture on Trypticase Soy Blood agar plates). All swabs were subjected to enrichment in
trypticase soy broth with 6.5% NaCl. Confirmation of presumptive colonies was done by
latex agglutination and mecA-mediated oxacillin resistance was tested by disk diffusion
test using a 30μg cefoxitin disk and cutoff of ≤21 mm (R), ≥22 mm (S).
Performance of the MRSA/SA ELITe MGB® was calculated relative to the reference
culture (enrichment broth culture followed by latex agglutination and cefoxitin
susceptibility test results).
Overall Results
Performance of the MRSA/SA ELITe MGB® was calculated relative to the broth culture
followed by latex agglutination and cefoxitin susceptibility test results. A total of 3271
nasal swab specimens were collected from hospitalized patients. Of the 3271 specimen
tested, 3174 specimens were eligible to be included in statistical analyses (72 specimens
were considered to be ineligible due to a duplicating error during samples collection and
preparation and 25 specimens failed the extraction due to a technical error).
The overall performance of MRSA/SA ELITe MGB®is shown in the following table:

Note: The statistics shown are the calculated values with the 95%
confidence interval in the parentheses.
Discrepant Analysis: Further investigation (testing for MRSA by sequencing of SCCmec
right extremity junction) was performed on all specimens that gave discordant MRSA
results between the reference culture method and MRSA/SA ELITe MGB™.
· 16 of the 17 specimens that were MRSA-positive by culture but MRSA-negative by
MRSA/SA ELITe MGB™ were found to be MRSA positive by SCCmec right
extremity junction sequencing.
· 22 of the 143 specimens that were MRSA-negative by culture but MRSA-positive by
MRSA/SA ELITe MGB™ were found to be MRSA positive by SCCmec right
extremity junction sequencing.
Thus, after discrepant analysis, the positive and negative percent agreements for MRSA
compared to reference culture were 93% and 96%, respectively. The positive and
negative predictive values were 65.2% and 99.4%, respectively.
