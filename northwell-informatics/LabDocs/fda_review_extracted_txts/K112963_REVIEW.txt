L. Test Principle:
Same as predicate devices cleared under k101635.
The glucose biosensors recognize the glucose present in whole blood or control solutions by
virtue of the specificity of the enzyme FAD dependent glucose dehydrogenase (GDH)
present on the test strip. The electrons liberated by this reaction are transferred via a co-
factor and mediator to the meter where they are read as a small electrical current. The

magnitude of the resultant current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the
specimen and the signal is converted into a readout displayed on the meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
The current devices differ from the predicates in the modification of meter physical
appearance and data transmission method from data port to blue tooth. The modifications
do not affect the analytical function of the meter and the current devices use the same test
strips as cleared in the predicate devices in k101635.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Same as predicate devices cleared under k101635.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor claims the same measuring range as established for the predicate
devices. The sponsor claims 20-600 mg/dL for the TD-4257 Blood Glucose
Monitoring System and 10-600 mg/dL for the TD-4257 Multi Blood Glucose
Monitoring System.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: Traceable to NIST SRM 91, dry D-glucose.
The control solutions were cleared under k093724.
Test strips were cleared under k101635. Data provided by the sponsor supports closed
vial stability of TD-4239 test strips for 18 months and open vial stability of 3 months
when stored at the recommended conditions of 2º - 32ºC / 35.6º - 89.6ºF, between
10%- 85% R.H.
Calibration: calibration of the test strip is done by inserting the code strip into the
meter when opening a new vial of test strips.
d. Detection limit:
The claimed measuring ranges are the same as the predicate devices; 20-600 mg/dL
for the TD-4257Blood Glucose Monitoring System and 10-600 mg/dL for the TD-
4257 Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference Study:
7

--- Page 8 ---
Same as predicate devices cleared under k101635.
The sponsor has the following limitations in their labeling:
Xylose: Do not test blood glucose during or soon after an absorption test. Xylose can
give falsely elevated results.
There is no significant interference (≤ 10%) in the presence of galactose, maltose,
fructose or mannitol observed in blood glucose tests as demonstrated in studies up to
1,000 mg/dL
Lipemic Effects: Blood triglycerides up to 2000 mg/dL (22.8 mmol/L) do not affect
the results significantly (≤ 10%), but may affect results at higher levels.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. System accuracy as compared to YSI
The system accuracy was evaluated using 126 whole blood samples with glucose
concentrations across the measuring range. The distribution of the glucose
concentrations in these samples are depicted in the below table:
Glucose Concentration by YSI Number of samples

20-50 21
50-80 21
80-120 21
120-200 21
201-400 21

Each sample was tested in duplicate on three meters and the results are compared to
the YSI method.
Result Summary:
Glucose ≤ 75 mg/dL (42 samples)

These systems need to be calibrated with the code strip from every new vial of test strips
6. Quality Control:
Glucose control solutions are cleared under k 093724. The labeling provides instructions
on when to test control solutions.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. An accuracy test using the Quality Control current board (QC board) was conducted to
evaluate the accuracy of 10 TD-4257 meters in glucose range of 10-700 mg/dL.
The QC board is designed to simulate 12 levels of glucose concentration: 10, 20, 40, 60, 80,
100, 120, 160, 200, 280, 400, 550 and 700 mg/dL when connected with the meter, it will send
an electrical current to the meter equivalent to the total amount of charge generated by the
glucose oxidation reaction at a certain glucose concentration. The meter then process the
current and display it in mg/dL unit.
The same procedure was also performed on 10 predicate meters of TD-4239. For the current
device TD4257, the CV of the mean of 10 meter measurements was between 0.00%-0.40% at
the 13 glucose levels. For the predicate meter TD-4239, the CV of the mean of 10 meter
measurements was between 0.00%-0.32% at the 13 glucose levels. The sponsor concluded
that the accuracy of the modified TD-4257 meter was consistent through out the 13 glucose
intervals with CV significantly below the set acceptance criteria of 5%.
2. Altitude:
The sponsor claims that the TD 4257 BMGS can be used at altitude up to 15,000 feet
based on study performed on the predicate device TD4239 in k101635.
3. Hematocrit:
The sponsor claims a hematocrit range of 20-70% based on study performed on the
predicate device TD4239 in k101635.
4. Temperature and humidity:
The sponsor claims that the TD-4257 meters operates at 50 -104 oF (10oC – 40oC), and
relative humidity between 10%- 85% based on study performed on the predicate meters
k101635.
5. Drop tests and vibration tests were conducted. The study protocol and test report were
reviewed and deemed acceptable.
6. EMC testing was performed for TD4257 and TD4257 multi Blood Glucose Monitoring
Systems by an accredited EMC Testing Laboratory ETC. A test certificate was issued to
Taidoc Technology Corporation on December 28, 2009.
11

--- Page 12 ---
7. Disinfection and Robustness studies:
Due to the casing changes in the new devices as compared to the predicates, new
Disinfection and Robustness studies were performed for TD4257 and TD4257 multi
Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems.
The disinfection studies were performed on these meters by an outside commercial
testing service to determine the robustness of the meter to the recommended cleaning and
disinfection protocol, and its effectiveness in preventing the spread of blood borne
pathogens, particularly Duck hepatitis B virus (HBV). Micro-Kill Plus™ disposable
wipes (EPA Reg. No: 59894-10-37549) were validated, demonstrating complete
inactivation of live virus for use with the meters. The sponsor also demonstrated that
there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the meters and lancing
device after 10,000 cleaning and disinfection cycles designed to simulate 3 years of
healthcare professional use and 5 years of use by lay users. Labeling has been reviewed
for adequate instructions in validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
8. The software changes related to the modified functions (Bluetooth data transmission and
memory storage of up to 1000 tests) were tested and the intended functions were
validated.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
