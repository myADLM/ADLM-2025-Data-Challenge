parameters. Total bilirubin can also be quantitated from heparinized plasma samples
when analyzed in the tBili/CO-Ox mode. These parameters, along with derived
parameters, aid in the diagnosis of a patient’s acid/base status, electrolyte and metabolite
balance and oxygen delivery capacity. Total bilirubin measurements are used in the
diagnosis and management of biliary tract obstructions, liver disease and various
hemolytic diseases and disorders involving the metabolism of bilirubin. In neonates, the
level of total bilirubin is used to aid in assessing the risk of kernicterus.
Intelligent Quality Management (iQM) is used as the quality control and assessment
system for the GEM Premier 4000 system. iQM is an active quality process control
program designed to provide continuous monitoring of the analytical process with real-
time, automatic error detection, automatic correction of the system and automatic
documentation of all corrective actions, replacing the use of traditional external quality
controls. Facilities should follow local, state and federal regulatory guidelines to ensure
that a total quality management system is followed.
As part of this program, GEM CVP (Calibration Valuation Product) with CO-Ox, GEM
CVP tBili and GEM CVP Hematocrit are external solutions intended to complete the
calibration process and final accuracy assessment of the iQM cartridge calibration
following warm-up. The reported values for GEM CVP (two levels for pH, blood gases,
electrolytes, metabolites, total bilirubin, CO-Oximetry and hematocrit) must meet IL’s
specifications before the iQM cartridge can be used for patient sample measurements.
Once the cartridge calibration is verified, the internal iQM program monitors the status of
the system during the cartridge use life.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
At point-of-care or central laboratory settings.
4. Special instrument requirements:
GEM Premier 4000 Analyzer
I. Device Description:
The GEM Premier 4000 analyzer utitilizes an ion-selective electrode for the measurement of
potassium. The potassium (K+) electrode has a sensor membrane on the surface of the
electrode. The GEM Premier 4000 K sensor membrane is being modified to lower the
Valinomycin concentration, along with a proportional decrease in the amount of counterion.
This modification is to the Potassium sensor for the K+ assay on the GEM Premier 4000.
There are no changes to other analyte measurements and device components.

L. Test Principle:
The GEM Premier 4000 potassium sensor technology is based on ion selective electrode
methodology. Valinomycin is an ionophore that functions as the potassium recognition
component in the sensor. When the sensor is exposed to solutions containing potassium, an
electrical signal response (change in electrode potential in millivolts) proportional to the
concentration of potassium in the sample is measured. The measured response is converted
into potassium concentration based on the slope from the sensor calibration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed to evaluate the performance of the modified K+
sensor using three levels of whole blood samples under the syringe mode (150 µL),
the full capillary mode (150 µL) and the micro capillary (65 µL) mode. Due to the
instability of whole blood, fresh levels of whole blood were prepared (using 0.1M
KCL as the spiking solution) for each run, each day, with a target concentration of
3.0, 4.0 and 7.0 mmol/L of potassium. Testing was completed in replicates of 8 per
run, twice a day for 5 days on 2 GEM Premier 4000 instruments. The mean, standard
deviation (SD), and coefficients of variation (CV) were determined for each level and
each mode as summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed using whole blood samples according to the CLSI
EP6-A guideline. 7 different concentrations of potassium were measured in triplicate
on 3 different GEM Premier 4000 analyzers using 3 different sample modes. The
measured values were plotted against the expected values measured by the reference
method (Flame Photometer). The linear regressions analysis is summarized in the
table below:

Micro Y= 1.0791X – 0.2189 0.9998 0.17-26.14 mmol/L

The results of the study support the sponsor’s claim that the assay is linear from 0.2 to
19.0 mmol/L
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Potassium is traceable to a reference material (NIST standard). See k061974
GEM CVP 1 and 2 (Calibration Valuation Product) with CO-Ox, GEM CVP 3 and 4
(Calibration Valuation Product) Hematocrit, and GEM CVP 5 (Calibration Valuation
Product) tBili are part of the iQM quality control and assessment system for the GEM
Premier 4000 system. They have been previously cleared in k061974 and k093623.
Potassium sensor stability:
The shelf life stability study was performed on three lots of sensors and the in-use
(cartridge use life) stability study was performed on six lots of sensors. Real-time
stability study is still on-going. Based on the results, the sponsor claims that the K
sensor has a shelf life stability of 2 months at 15 to 25 oC and an in-use stability of at
least 600 samples. The stability study protocol and acceptance criteria were found to
be adequate.

d. Detection limit:
See linearity study in section M.1.b above.
e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was performed based on the CLSI EP7-A guideline. A
comprehensive interference screen was conducted, followed by a dose-response
evaluation to characterize the interference according to the CLSI EP7-A. Two levels
of human whole blood pooled samples (K approximately 3.0 and 5.0 mmol/L) were
spiked with various potential interference substances (48 drugs and endogenous
compounds). All samples were analyzed in triplicates on the GEM Premier 4000 and
the reference method (flame photometer). The sponsor defines non-significant
interference as difference within ± 0.1 mmol/L when compared to the reference
method. Results are summarized in the table below for non-significant interference
when tested at the concentrations listed:

Because hemolysis and sodium citrate have shown significant interference, the
sponsor stated the following limitations in the labeling:
“Hemolyzed samples may result in falsely elevated potassium levels.”
“Blood collection tubes containing sodium citrate as an additive will produce
clinically significant interference on Potassium and should not be used.”

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed for potassium according to the CLSI
EP9-A guideline. Six GEM Premier 400 analyzers were tested with two in each
sample mode, over a period of 18 days, against the results performed with a
commercially available blood gases analyzer. A total of 109 samples were tested.
Approximately 10% to 14% of the samples were altered in order to cover the hard-to-
find sample range. The linear regressions analysis is summarized in below:
