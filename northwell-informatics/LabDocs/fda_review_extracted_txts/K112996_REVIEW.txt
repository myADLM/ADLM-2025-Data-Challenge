L. Test Principle:
Antibodies present in patient samples bind to the antigen mixture-coated microtiter
wells during an incubation step. The unbound sample is washed away and anti-
human IgG enzyme conjugate is added. After washing away unbound enzyme
conjugate, the remaining conjugate is incubated with chromogenic substrate solution.
The reaction is stopped by adding “stop solution” and color intensity is measured as
OD units by spectrophotometer. The ODs are proportional to the amount of bound
conjugate, which in turn is proportional to the amount of antibodies bound to the
antigen mixture in microtiter wells. Results are expressed as ratios which is a ratio of
the OD of the control or patient sample to the OD value of the calibrator.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Intra- and inter-assay reproducibility of the device was evaluated using 16 and
14 serum samples with different concentrations, respectively. Intra-assay
reproducibility was assessed from 16 or 20 determinations on one day. Inter-
assay reproducibility was based on 26-30 results from 10 runs performed on 5
days with 2 runs per day. Each sample was assayed in triplicate for each run.
For all samples, 100% of the results corresponded to the expected results.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i. Traceability: A recognized international standard or reference material for
anti-nuclear antibodies is not available. Results of this assay are based on
OD reading expressed as in ratios.
ii. Calibrator and Controls: The OD values of the calibrator and the ratios of
the positive and negative controls must lie within the limits stated in the
quality control certificate provided with the relevant test kit lot.
iii. Stability:
Three lots of all kit reagents were tested in real time stability studies.
Original sealed products were demonstrated to be stable for 12 months
when stored at 2-8°C. Opened products were demonstrated to be stable
for 12 months when stored at 2-8°C. The reconstituted wash buffer is
stable for up to 28 days (4 weeks).
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
i. Interference: Four samples with different ENA concentrations (ratios from
0.7 to 8.4) were spiked with varying concentrations of hemoglobin up to
1,000 mg/dL, triglycerides up to 2,000 mg/dL, or bilirubin up to 40
mg/dL. Recoveries of all spiked sample/interferent combinations
compared to the measurements for the unspiked samples were calculated.
The individual recovery of all samples was within the range of 91% to
105%.
Six samples with ENA concentration ratios from 1.1 to 11.7 were spiked
with rheumatoid factor at 500 IU/mL. Recovery in relation to the original
unspiked sample was calculated and found to be between 96% and 106%.

ii. Cross Reactivity: The reactivity of the EUROIMMUN Anti-ENA Pool
ELISA (IgG) was verified using twelve human reference sera from the
CDC ANA reference panel. Samples characterized as
homogenous/rim/nDNA (No. 1), nucleolar/U3 RNP (Fibrillarin) (No. 6),
centromere (No. 8), and PM-Scl (No. 11) tested negative. All samples
with target antigens (Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 12) included in the kit tested
positive. CDC sample characterized as anti-Jo-1 positive (No. 10) was
also positive. Further testing was conducted to determine whether anti-Jo-
1 reactivity was due to the presence of Ro-52 antibodies in the sample.
Five samples positive for both anti-Jo-1 and anti-Ro-52 (but negative for
nRNA/Sm, Sm, SS-A 60, SS-B, Scl70, and ribosomal P proteins) were
positive with the EUROIMMUN Anti-ENA Pool ELISA (IgG). Two anti-
Jo-1 positive samples that were negative for anti-Ro-52 antibodies tested
negative with the EUROIMMUN Anti-ENA Pool ELISA (IgG). No cross
reactivity to Jo-1 is expected.
Cross reactivity was investigated in other disease conditions using 82
clinically and serologically characterized samples. The samples were as
follows: 10 celiac disease with antibodies against gliadin and tissue
transglutaminase, 17 Wegener’s granulomatosis with anti-neutrophil
cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), 39 rheumatoid arthritis with anti-CCP
antibodies, and 16 infectious diseases antibody positive. All samples
except 2 Wegener’s granulomatosis samples were negative with the
EUROIMMUN Anti-ENA Pool ELISA (IgG).
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-off is OD ratio of 1.0. Results > 1.0 are positive, and results <
1.0 are negative.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Two hundred seventy-eight (278) clinically characterized samples from
patients and control groups were tested with the predicate device and the
EUROIMMUN Anti-ENA Pool ELISA (IgG). The samples were from 49
mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), 26 systemic lupus erythrematosus
(SLE), 29 Sjögren’s syndrome, 22 systemic sclerosis, 20
polymyositis/dermatomyositis, 10 celiac disease, 17 Wegener’s
granulomatosis, 39 rheumatoid arthritis, and 16 infectious disease patients.
Fifty healthy individuals were also included.

Method comparison with individual ENA ELISAs
A comparison study was performed with six monospecific autoantibody
ELISAs to ensure that all targets are recognized by the EUROIMMUN Anti-
ENA Pool ELISA (IgG). Samples from MCTD, SLE, Sjögren’s syndrome,
systemic sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, infectious diseases and
healthy individuals. The combined positive percent agreement was 100%
(95%CI: 94.7%-100%), negative percent agreement was 91.7% (95% CI:
80.0%-97.7%) and overall agreement of 96.6% (95%CI: 91.4%-99.1%).
There were two false positive samples each for the SSA/SSB and Scl-70
comparison.
b. Matrix comparison:
Serum is the only sample specimen.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Clinical sensitivity was determined from 261 clinically characterized samples
from patients with MCTD (n=44), SLE (n=85), systemic sclerosis (n=66), and
Sjögren’s syndrome (n=66). The EUROIMMUN Anti-ENA Pool ELISA
