L. Test Principle:
The Roche Tina-quant Albumin Gen 2 assay is an immunoturbidimetric assay for the
quantitative in vitro determination of albumin in human urine on the Roche/Hitachi
cobas c 311 analyzer. The test principle is a particle enhanced immunoturbidimetric
assay. Human albumin (the antigen) agglutinates with latex particles coated with anti-
albumin antibodies. The precipitate is determined turbidimetrically following
agglutination.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To determine the linearity of the Tina-quant Albumin Gen.2 cobas c 311 urine
assay, two dilution series were prepared using high analyte level native human
urine samples. The diluent used was NaCl. Albumin levels were measured and
the recovered value was compared to the theoretical value. Pure samples (0%
and 100%) were run n=6, with mean measured value reported. Diluted
samples were run n=3 with mean measured values reported.
Data were calculated per EP6-A guidelines. The linearity data were analyzed
with regards to linear, quadratic, and cubic polynomials. A linearity check was
performed with a first order (linear) regression and then with higher order
models (quadratic and cubic).
Linear regression produces the following:
Slope: 0.97 (95% CI 0.96 to 0.98)
Intercept: 0.90 (95% CI -0.31 to 2.10)
Correlation Coefficient: 0.998
The claimed measuring range for the assay is 12 – 200 mg/L.

The extended measuring range using automated rerun with dilution was
validated by performing an experiment comparing the instrument auto-rerun
result with a simple manual dilution. Two cobas c 311 analyzers were used.
Three samples were manually diluted in triplicate per analyzer and the
recoveries were compared to the instrument auto-rerun results. All auto-rerun
results were within ± 4% of the manual dilution results.
A known high-dose hook effect occurs with this assay. Due to the antigen
excess check reagent R3, no unflagged high-dose hook effect should occur up
to an albumin concentration of 40,000 mg/L in urine samples. The sponsor
verified the correct flagging with 2 serially spiked samples up to 41,000 mg/L
analyzed on the cobas c311 analyzer.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The C.f.a.s. PUC calibrator, Precinorm PUC/Precipath PUC and Precinorm
Protein/Precipath Protein controls are traceable to the reference preparation
IRMM (Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements)
BCR470/CRM470 (RPPHS - Reference Preparation for Proteins in Human
Serum).
d. Detection limit:
The analytical limits at low levels are as follows:
Limit of Blank 2 mg/L
Limit of Detection 3 mg/L
Limit of Quantitation 12 mg/L
e. Analytical specificity:
The effects of endogenous interference on the quantitation of albumin by the
Tina-quant Albumin Gen.2 cobas c 311 urine assay were determined on the
cobas c 311 analyzer. Pooled human urine samples were spiked with varying
levels of interferents. The resulting sample series (ten dilution steps per
sample) were tested in triplicate and the median values used to calculate
recovery, by comparing the measured albumin concentration to the expected
albumin concentration (which is the albumin concentration when no
interferent was added). All recoveries were within ± 10%.
The following compounds were tested at the concentrations listed:
Conjugated bilirubin 69 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 788 mg/dL
