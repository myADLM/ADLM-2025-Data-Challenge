L. Test Principle:
The Bioland G-423 Blood Glucose Monitoring System, Model G-423 uses electrochemical
methodologies. The system quantitatively measures blood glucose levels using an
amperometric method, which involves detecting the current produced from glucose
oxidation. The electrons generated during this reaction are transferred from the blood to the
electrodes. The magnitude of the resultant current is proportional to the concentration of
glucose in the specimen and the signal is converted into a readout displayed on the meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor evaluated repeatability evaluation and intermediate precision studies
using a protocol based on the ISO 15197. Five levels of venous whole blood over the
claimed assay range were used to establish repeatability of the assay. Each sample
was analyzed on ten Bioland G-423 glucose meters by one operator using three lots of
test strips, for a total of 300 measurements per meter per level. Results are
summarized in the following tables:

Stability: The storage claims for this device are: 90 days for open vial of strips
stored at 35.6 – 89.6 oF (2 – 32 °C) and 12 months for unopened vials of strips
stored at 2 - 32°C. The study protocols (accelerated testing and real time studies),
summary of results and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
adequate.
Control Solutions were previously cleared under k093724.
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the system is 20 to 600 mg/dL. This range was verified by
the linearity study above.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed interference studies with spiked venous blood samples at
three glucose concentrations (Level 1 (~75-80 mg/dL), Level 2 (~120 mg/dL) and
Level 3 (~300 mg/dL)) that were prepared and divided into a test (dosed) pool and a
control pool. The interferents were added to the sample and each sample was
analyzed using two test strip lots and three glucose meters. The YSI 2300D glucose
analyzer was used as the reference method. The bias between control and dosed
samples were calculated for each substance. The table below lists all substances
tested at concentrations with insignificant (<10%) interference:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method Comparison:
The sponsor conducted a combined accuracy and consumer study with trained
operators and a total of 182 lay-users. Each lay user participant performed their own
fingerstick and tested their blood on the Bioland G-423 meter using only the
instructions in the user’s manual and test strip insert. A trained operator then
performed a second fingerstick and tested the blood on the same meter. Venous whole
blood was also collected and measured on an YSI analyzer. The total range of
samples tested was 35 to 578 mg/dL, with a hematocrit range of 31.3-54.4%. A total
of 20 samples (11 samples < 50 mg/dL and 9 samples > 400 mg/dL) were glycolyzed
or spiked, respectively and tested by trained operators only. Linear regression results
are presented below:
Trained operator vs. YSI-2300 y = 1.024 x - 1.602, r2 = 0.9901, x = 202
Lay user vs. YSI-2300 y = 1.013 x + 1.273, r2 = 0.9870, x = 182
The study results met the ISO 15197 accuracy criteria where ninety-five percent
(95%) of the individual glucose results fell within ±15mg/dL of the YSI results at
glucose concentrations <75mg/dL and within ±20% at glucose concentrations

Yes __x__ or No ____
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood samples from the finger.
Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip there are no special
handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
A code number is provided with each batch of test strips to calibrate the meter for that
batch. The code number is associated with the meter by inserting a test strip and requires
entering the code number to match that found on the test strip bottle. No further
calibrations are required of the user.
6. Quality Control:
Controls are not included in the G-423 Blood Glucose Monitoring System, but the labeling
explains which controls should be used with the meter. The labeling also provides
recommendations on when to test control materials. The meter will read the control solution
just like a blood sample, and control results are displayed but not stored in memory. An
acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. If the control
values fall outside these ranges, the user is told to contact customer support.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Infection Control Studies:
The device system is intended for single-patient use. Disinfection efficacy studies were
performed on the materials comprising the meter and lancing device by an outside
commercial testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus
(HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, DISPATCH® Hospital Cleaner Disinfectant Towels
with Bleach by CALTECH wipes (EPA Registration # 59894-10-37549). Robustness
studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in
performance or external materials of the meter and lancing device after 5000 cleanings
and 5000 disinfection steps with the DISPATCH® Hospital Cleaner Disinfectant Towels
with Bleach by CALTECH wipes (EPA Registration # 59894-10-37549). The robustness
studies were designed to simulate 5 years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed
for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
2. Hematocrit study:
To study the effect of hematocrit, venous blood samples at six glucose concentrations
(~30 mg/dL, 75 mg/dL, 150 mg/dL, 250 mg/dL, 400 mg/dL and 500 mg/dL) and
hematocrit adjusted to 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65 and 70 were evaluated on the
Bioland G-423 Blood Glucose Monitoring System and compared to the YSI values. In
addition, measurements obtained on the Bioland glucose meter were compared to a
normal hematocrit (40%). The data supports the sponsor’s claim that hematocrit 15%-
55% does not significantly interfere (more than ± 15%) with glucose measurements using
the test system.
3. Altitude study:
An altitude study was performed at elevations up to 10,774 feet with 5 different
concentrations of glucose spiked venous whole blood spanning 30 to 500 mg/dL
glucose range. Sea level results (98 feet above sea level) were compared to results at
higher elevations and to YSI values and were found to be acceptable.
4. Temperature and humidity studies:
Temperature and humidity studies were conducted to demonstrate that the Bioland G-423
device can be used at temperatures of 50 to 104°F (4 to 40°C) and at a relative humidity
from 60% to 90%, and stored at temperatures of -4 to 140°F (-20 to 60°C) with a relative
humidity from 60% to 90%. Studies were conducted with combinations of temperature
and humidity to include low temperature and low humidity, low temperature and high
humidity, high temperature and low humidity, and high temperature and high humidity.
Study results were reviewed and were found to be acceptable, supporting the sponsor
stated temperature and humidity claims.
5. Electromagnetic Interference Studies:
Additional electromagnetic interference study was performed to verify these new
11

--- Page 12 ---
products. The results of this study complied with standards listed in the
Standard/Guidance Document Referenced section above.
6. Specimen volume study:
A study to evaluate the effect of different sample volumes (1.00, 1.10, 1.20, 1.35, 1.50,
1.65, 1.80 and 2.50ml) was conducted to demonstrate that the meter requires a minimum
of 1.8 μl volume to obtain an accurate reading.
7. Readability:
The sponsor provided a readability study and obtained Flesch-Kincaid grade level scores
of 8 or lower for the User’s Manual (6.5), test strips (7.8).
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
