b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using 3 lots of test strips, 10 meters, and 8 venous whole
blood samples with glucose levels ranging from 13-651 mg/dL, obtained by spiking
pooled venous blood with a glucose solution. Each glucose level was analyzed 40
times over 3 test strip lots. Linear regression analysis for each test strip lot compared
to the YSI resulted in:
y = 1.018x - 0.3134; R2 = 0.9983 for Test Strip Lot 1
y = 1.031x - 3.5555; R2 = 0.9986 for Test Strip Lot 2
y = 1.021x - 2.1524; R2 = 0.9979 for Test Strip Lot 3
The claimed range of measurement for this device is 20 to 600 mg/dL. Data from
bench studies and software verification studies were provided to demonstrate that if a
sample is less than 20 mg/dL, the result is flagged by the meter as LO. If a sample result
exceeds 600 mg/dL, the result is flagged by the meter as HI.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Three levels of control material, Contrex Plus Control Solution Low (40-70mg/dL),
Contrex Plus Control Solution Level 1 (87-131 mg/dL) and Contrex Plus Control
Solution Level 2 (186-280 mg/dL), are available for use with this test system. These
control solutions have been previously cleared (k102816). See k102816 for control
solutions traceability, shelf life, storage, and stability information. The Contrex Plus
control solutions were qualified for use with the AutoSure Voice II Plus system. The

The AutoSure Plus test strips are identical to the test strips cleared under k102816,
and differ only in trade name. Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria for
the test strips were reviewed in k102816 and were found to be acceptable. The
manufacturer claims a shelf life stability of 17 months and an open-vial stability of 3
months at the recommended storage temperatures of 5°C to 30°C for the AutoSure
Plus test strips.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range is 20 to 600 mg/dL based on linearity/reportable range studies
above (section M.1.b.).
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor tested substances for interference using 1 lot of test strips (10 test strips
per interferent level), 10 meters, and 3 levels of glucose (achieved by adjusting human
venous blood glucose levels to the ranges of 70-90, 110-130, and 300-330 mg/dL).
Samples were then spiked with the following interfering substances. Each sample was
analyzed 10 times. The labeling states that elevated concentration of L-DOPA ( > 1.5
mg/dL), ibuprofen ( > 40 mg/dL), tolazamide ( > 60 mg/dL), ascorbic acid ( > 5.0
mg/dL), fructose ( > 15 mg/dL), uric acid (> 15 mg/dL), cholesterol ( > 400 mg/dL),
bilirubin conjugated ( > 25 mg/dL), bilirubin unconjugated ( > 15 mg/dL), triglyceride
( > 2000 mg/dL), and methyl-dopa (> 7.5 mg/dL) may affect test results. The
following table lists the concentrations of each substance at which no significant

N. Instrument Name:
The AutoSure Voice II Plus Blood Glucose Meter
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings.
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,
or mobile device?:
Yes or No __ X___.
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?:
Yes or No __ X___.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ____X____ or No ________
The applicant has provided documentation that indicates the device was designed and
developed under good software life-cycle processes.
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, palm, and
forearm. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip there are no
special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
The meter is a non-coding meter, therefore no coding is required by the user.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor manufactures three levels of glucose control solution, Low, Level 1, and
Level 2 to be used with the AutoSure Voice II Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
These control solutions must be purchased separately and are not provided with the
11

--- Page 12 ---
device kits. Instructions for how to purchase the control solution are provided in the user
manuals. To perform a control test the user is instructed to press the down button while
the blood drop symbol is flashing. The “ctl” symbol will then appear on the display. An
acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. If the control
values fall outside these ranges, the user is referred to the user manual and customer
support for problems and more information
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. The device is intended for single-patient use. Disinfection studies were performed on
the AutoSure Voice II Plus meter and lancet device by outside commercial laboratory
testing services to determine the disinfection efficacy of the meter and lancing device to
the recommended cleaning and disinfection protocol, and its effectiveness in preventing
the spread of bloodborne pathogens, particularly hepatitis B virus (HBV). Dispatch
Hospital Cleaner Disinfectant Towels with Bleach disposable wipes (EPA Reg. No:
56392-8) were validated, demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus for use with
the meter and lancing device. The sponsor also conducted robustness studies and
demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the
meter and lancing device after 1,825 cleaning and disinfection cycles to simulate 5 years
of use by lay-users. Each robustness cycle tested consisted of one pre-clean wipe and
one disinfecting wipe.
2. The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated with 3 lots of test strips using 10
test strips at each of 5 concentration ranges of glucose (30-50, 51-70, 111-150, 250-350,
500-600 mg/dL). The glucose samples were prepared from venous blood samples at 6
hematocrit levels at approximately 30, 33, 35, 43, 50 and 55%. Each of the results were
compared to the value obtained from the same plasma glucose concentration obtained by
YSI. The data vs. YSI was reviewed and was found to be acceptable to support the
claimed hct range of 30-55%.
3. The effect of altitude was evaluated at five whole blood samples with glucose
concentrations ranging from 48 to 470 mg/dL, testing at sea level and 3150 meters
(10,334 feet above sea level). Each glucose concentration was measured 20 times at each
altitude. The bias was calculated relative to YSI at sea level and at 3150 meters. The
results demonstrate that the system meets the acceptance criteria for testing at altitudes
up to 3,150 meters (10,334 feet above sea level).
4. The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies at the combined extremes of
10°C/RH: 18%, 40°C/RH: 20%, 10°C/RH: 88%, and 40°C/RH: 89%, with venous blood
samples (50-400 mg/dL) that demonstrated that the AutoSure Voice II Plus meter can be
used at temperatures of 50 to 104°F (10 to 40°C) and 20% to 90% relative humidity.
5. Insufficient sample studies were performed at volumes of 0.2 to 1.5µL on ten meters and
3 test strip lots. Three glucose concentrations were tested ranging from approximately
50-350 mg/dL, as determined by the YSI. Appropriate sample volume was determined
12

--- Page 13 ---
if the meter testing could start properly and if the meter results matched the YSI results.
A blood volume ≥ 0.8 µL met the criteria.
6. The sponsor provided a readability study and obtained Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level
Scores of 8.0, 7.6, and 7.8 for the AutoSure Plus test strip insert, the AutoSure Voice II
Plus User’s Manual, and Contrex Plus III package insert, respectively.
7. The sponsor stated that they conformed to the following guidelines and provided the
appropriate documentation to demonstrate compliance:
· IEC/EN 60601-1-2: Medical electrical equipment, Part 2. Electromagnetic
compatibility, 2007.
