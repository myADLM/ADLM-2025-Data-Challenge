Within-run precision was performed in one day using five blood glucose
concentrations. Each sample was tested using calibration code 49 with the UniStrip
test strips and the OneTouch®Ultra, OneTouch®Ultra2®, OneTouch UltraMini® and
OneTouch® UltraSmart® glucose meters. Three UniStrip test lots were used with
each blood glucose meter. Five different meters for each model type above were each
used to test each sample in singlicate with all three test strip lots. This resulted in a
total of n=25 for each glucose meter model and test strip lot combination for each
glucose concentration. The results are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using 11 venous blood samples with glucose concentrations
adjusted to 15, 20, 80, 150, 250, 300, 350, 400, 510, 600 and 620 mg/dL and
measured by YSI. Each sample was measured 10 times with 3 UniStrip test strip lots
using calibration code 49 with the UniStrip test strips and the OneTouch®Ultra,
OneTouch®Ultra2®, OneTouch UltraMini®, and OneTouch® UltraSmart® glucose
meters. Mean values for each sample and glucose meter were calculated and
compared to YSI values and used to perform linear regression. All of the individual
sample results were within ±10% of the YSI sample results. The linear regression
results are shown below.

The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of
20-600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The UniStrip test strips are traceable to the NIST SRM #917b D-Glucose (Dextrose).
The reference instrument used was the YSI 2300 Glucose Analyzer, which is
calibrated by YSI 2747 Glucose Standard. The results of the capillary whole blood
samples tested by ONETOUCH series Blood Glucose Meters Ultra, Ultra2, UltraMini
and UltraSmart with UniStrip Blood Glucose Test Strips are compared with the
results of the corresponded plasma samples tested by the calibrated YSI 2300 Glucose
Analyzer.
The UniStrip test strip package insert instructs the user to check their device using the
Prodigy® Control Solution. Expected control ranges for the low and high Prodigy
Control Solutions are shown on the test strip vial. The controls were previously
cleared in k060467.
Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria for the UniStrip test strips shelf-life
were provided. The manufacturer claims shelf life stability of 24 months and opened
vial stability of 3 months when stored unopened at 4-30°C (relative humidity 10-
90%) The real time and accelerated stability study protocols and acceptance critreria
for these studies were reviewed and found to be adequate.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed using three lots of UniStrip test strips and the
OneTouch®Ultra, OneTouch®Ultra2®, OneTouch UltraMini®, and OneTouch®
UltraSmart® meters by spiking venous blood to three glucose concentrations (40,
120, 340 mg/dL) and the potential interferent concentrations shown below. Each
interferent and glucose concentration were tested in replicates of five with each lot
and glucose meter then compared to the control sample. The sponsor defined no
significant interference as ≤10% difference between individual interferent samples
and the control sample. Results are shown below:
Interferant Max Concentration
with no significant
interference
Acetaminophen 15 mg/dL
Ascorbic acid 3.0 mg/dL
Caffeine 100 mg/dL
Dopamine 6.0 mg/dL
Ephedrine 1.0 mg/dL
Gentisic Acid 10 mg/dL
L-dopa 20 mg/dL
Mannitol 5.0 mg/dL
Salicylates 60 mg/dL
Tetracycline 4.0 mg/dL
Cholesterol 700 mg/dL
Triglyceride 3000 mg/dL
Uric acid 15 mg/dL
The sponsor has the following limitations in the UniStrip test strip insert:
• Hematocrit is the percentage of red blood cells in the blood. Extremes in
hematocrit may affect test results. Hematocrit levels below 30% may cause
falsely high readings. Hematocrit levels over 55% may cause falsely low
readings. If you do not know your hematocrit level, consult your healthcare
professional.
• Acetaminophen, salicylates, uric acid, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), and other
reducing substances (when occurring in normal blood or normal therapeutic
concentrations) do not affect results by more than 10%. However, more than
normally high concentrations in blood may cause inaccurately high results.
• Lipemic samples: Cholesterol levels up to 700 mg/dL (18.1 mmol/L) and
10

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A system accuracy study was performed to evaluate the system accuracy of the blood
glucose system of ONETOUCH® Series Meters with UniStrip1 Blood Glucose Test
Strips compared to Glucose Analyzer YSI 2300. Two each of the following meters
were evaluated with three lots of UniStrip1 Blood Glucose Test Strips:
OneTouch®Ultra, OneTouch®Ultra2®, OneTouch UltraMini®, and OneTouch®
UltraSmart®. All meters were set to code 49 and 100 subjects with YSI blood
glucose concentrations ranging from 47 to 444 mg/dL were evaluated over 10 days .
Hematocrit for these samples was between 30% and 55%. To obtain samples with
glucose < 50 mg/dL, samples were collected with an appropriate anticoagulant
(EDTA) and allowed to incubate at room temperature to allow glucose to glycolyze.
To obtain samples with glucose concentrations above 400 mg/dL, samples were
collected with an appropriate anticoagulant (EDTA) and spiked with glucose. No
more than three samples were adjusted with each of these procedures. For each test
subject a fingerstick was performed by a healthcare professional and the sample was
tested using one test strip for each glucose meter listed above. The procedure was
repeated for palm and forearm test sites for all meters, except for the
OneTouch®Ultra, which only tested finger and forearm sites. A healthcare
professional drew a venous sample from each subject’s arm to test hematocrit. An
aliquot of this sample was used to test each subject’s glucose concentration on the
YSI 2300. The glucose concentration from each meter was compared to the YSI
2300. Results are summarized below.

A lay user study was performed with 152 volunteers between the ages of 15-80 years
old. There were approximately equal numbers of male and female volunteers and they
did not have experience performing blood glucose tests on themselves. Each
volunteer read the user’s guide before performing the testing. This was the only
instruction provided. The users performed a fingerstick and measured their blood
glucose. This was followed by the users performing palm and forearm sticks and
testing, after which the technician performed a fingerstick and blood glucose
measurement. A technician then performed a venous blood draw to measure
hematocrit and glucose using the YSI-2300. The testing was performed with the
UniStrip test strip and the OneTouch®Ultra, OneTouch®Ultra2®, OneTouch
UltraMini®, and OneTouch® UltraSmart® meters. Results are summarized below.

3. Hematocrit Study: The effect of different hematocrit levels on the performance of the
UniStrip test strip with the OneTouch®Ultra, OneTouch®Ultra2®, OneTouch
UltraMini®, OneTouch® UltraSmart®meters was evaluated using venous whole blood
samples with hematocrit levels of 25, 30, 35, 45, 55 and 60% spiked with glucose to 5
concentrations (approximately 40, 80, 130, 200 and 320 mg/dL). Each sample was then
tested in replicates of 10 using each meter type with three lots of UniStrip test strips and
the values were compared with those obtained from YSI analyzer. The % biases relative
to YSI were acceptable within the claimed hematocrit range of 30 to 55%.
4. The UniStrip test strip labeling states that the test strips can be used at a temperature
range of 6-44°C and a relative humidity (RH), range of 10-90%. In order to demonstrate
this performance, OneTouch®Ultra, OneTouch®Ultra2®, OneTouch UltraMini®,
OneTouch® UltraSmart® meters and the UniStrip test strips were placed in
environmental chambers with the following temperature/relative humidity combinations:
6°C/10% RH, 6°C/90% RH, 25°C/10% RH, 25°C/90% RH, 44°C/10% RH and
44°C/90% RH. Fresh venous blood samples with glucose concentrations of
approximately 50, 150 and 315 mg/dL were tested five times with each glucose meter
model at all of the temperature/RH combinations shown above and the results from each
measurement were compared to the YSI values for each sample. The results from each
measurement were within the sponsor’s acceptance criteria. These results demonstrate
that the performance of the UniStrip test strips with the claimed meters is unaffected by
the temperature and humidity ranges specified in the device labeling.
5. Altitude Study: The effect of altitude on the performance of the UniStrip test strip with
the OneTouch®Ultra, OneTouch®Ultra2®, OneTouch UltraMini®, OneTouch®
UltraSmart®meters was evaluated using venous whole blood samples spiked with
glucose to 5 concentrations (approximately 40, 80, 130, 200 and 320 mg/dL). Each meter
model was used to test each sample five times at altitudes of 298, 3,608, 7,575 and
10,745 feet above sea level. The results from each measurement were compared to the
YSI values for each sample. The results from each measurement were the sponsor’s
acceptance criteria. These results demonstrate that the performance of the UniStrip test
strips with the claimed meters is unaffected by altitudes up to 10,745 feet.
The sponsor has the following limitations in the UniStrip test strip insert:
• UniStrip1 Test Strips may be used at altitudes up to 10,000 feet (3048 meters)
without an effect on test results. Accurate results were shown in clinical studies
20

performed at heights up to 5,280 feet (1609 meters) and in studies simulating heights
up to 10,745 feet (3275 meters).
• Patients going through oxygen therapy may yield falsely low results.
6. The sponsor performed a readability assessment of the test strip package insert and the
results showed the insert was readable at an 8th grade level.
7. The sponsor evaluated the minimum blood sample size required by testing sample
volumes ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 µl on each meter. 5 glucose concentrations were tested
ranging from 40~400 mg/dL, as determined by the YSI. Appropriate sample volume was
determined if the meter results matched the YSI results. The data shows that sample
volume of ≥0.8 μL is the smallest volume to produce acceptable results.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
