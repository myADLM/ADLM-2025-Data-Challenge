H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Cocaine Metabolite Enzyme Immunoassay is intended for the qualitative and
semi-quantitative determination of benzoylecgonine in human urine, at a cutoff
value of 150 ng/mL. The assay is designed for professional use with a number of
automated clinical chemistry analyzers.
The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of (1) enabling laboratories to
determine an appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a
confirmatory method such as GCMS or (2) permitting laboratories to establish
quality control procedures.
This assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific
alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed
analytical result. Gas or Liquid Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS or
LC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and
professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result,
particularly when the preliminary result is positive.
The Cocaine Metabolite Drugs of Abuse (DAU) Calibrators are for use as
calibrators in the qualitative and semi-quantitative calibration of the Cocaine
Metabolite Enzyme Immunoassay at a cutoff value of 150 ng/mL.
The Cocaine Metabolite Drugs of Abuse (DAU) Controls are for use as assayed
quality control materials to monitor the precision of the Cocaine Metabolite
Enzyme Immunoassay at a cutoff value of 150 ng/mL.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For professional use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Clinical chemistry analyzers capable of maintaining a constant temperature,
pipetting sample, mixing reagent, measuring enzymatic rates at 340 nm and
timing the reaction accurately can be used to perform this homogeneous
immunoassay.
Performance testing was conducted on the Roche Diagnostics Hitachi 717
analyzer.

I. Device Description:
The assay consists of ready-to-use liquid reagents. Reagent 1 contains a mouse
monoclonal anti-benzoylecgonine antibody, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD), stabilizers and sodium azide (0.09%) as a preservative.
Reagent 2 contains glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) labeled with
benzoylecgonine in buffer with sodium azide (0.09%) as a preservative.
The calibrators and controls are sold separately. The calibrator has 5 levels and the
control has 2 levels. They consist of human urine samples containing
benzoylecgonine with sodium azide (0.09%) as a preservative.

L. Test Principle:
The Cocaine Metabolite assay is a homogenous enzyme immunoassay with ready-to-
use liquid reagent. The assay is based on competition between drug in the sample and
dug labeled with enzyme glucose-6-phodphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for a fixed
amount of antibody in the reagent.
Enzyme activity decreases upon binding to the antibody, and the drug concentration
in the sample is measured in terms of enzyme activity. In the absence of drug in the
sample, benzoylecgonine-labeled G6PDH conjugate is bound to antibody, and the
enzyme activity is inhibited. On the other hand, when free drug is present in the
sample, antibody would bind to free drug, the unbound benzoylecgonine-labeled
G6PDH then exhibits its maximal enzyme activity. Active enzyme converts
nictinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH resulting in an absorbance change
that can be measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was determined by spiking benzoylecgonine into drug free urine at
various concentrations (zero, -75%, -50%, -25%, at the cutoff, 125%, 150%,
175% and 200% of the cutoff). Concentrations were confirmed by GC/MS.
Testing for both the with-in run and between-run studies were performed by
testing each sample in replicate, with two runs per day, for 22 days. The
qualitative and semi-quantitative results are presented below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity across the range was confirmed by serially diluting a spiked urine
pool containing 1000 ng/mL of benzoylecgonine in to concentration levels
listed in the table below. Each sample was assayed in the semi-quantitative
mode. The results were averaged and compared to the expected result and the
percent recovery was calculated. Results are presented in the table below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Five levels of calibrators (0, 75, 150, 300, 1000 ng/mL) and two levels of
control material (112.5 ng/mL, 187.5 ng/mL) are available for use with the
Cocaine Metabolite Enzyme Immunoassay. A commercially available
benzoylecgonine standard solution from Cerilliant Analytical Reference
Standards is used and traceable to NIST standard. This standard solution is
made into a secondary (lower concentration) stock solution. The secondary
stock solution is then spiked into the calibrators and controls to the desired
concentration. The concentrations are confirmed by GC/MS.
Stability Studies:
Real time and accelerated studies for both controls and calibrators have been
conducted. Protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be
acceptable. The manufacturer claims the following expiration date for both
controls and calibrators:
When stored at 2-8 ºC unopened product is stable until expiration date which
is 18 months.
On board stability is good for 14 days when stored at 2-8 ºC.
d. Detection limit:
Performance at low drug concentrations in the semi-quantitative assay was

There is the possibility that other substances and/or factors not listed above
may interfere with the test and cause false results, e.g., technical or procedural
errors.
pH and Specific Gravity
To test for possible positive and/or negative interference from pH urine
samples having pH from 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 were used. Each of these
samples were divided into two aliquots for each drug and spiked to -25% of
the cutoff and +25% of the cutoff. No positive or negative interference due to
pH was observed.
To test for possible positive and/or negative interference from specific gravity
urine samples having specific gravity from 1.000, 1.002, 1.005, 1.007, 1.010,
1.015, 1.017, 1.025 and 1.030 were used. Each of these samples were divided
into two aliquots for each drug and spiked to -25% of the cutoff and 125% of
the cutoff. No positive or negative interference due to specific gravity was
observed.
