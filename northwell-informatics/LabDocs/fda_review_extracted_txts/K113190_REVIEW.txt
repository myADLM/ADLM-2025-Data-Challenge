I. Device Description:
TRU Legionella is a single use capture immunoassay to detect Legionella
pneumophila serogroup 1 in human urine specimens. The test consists of a Conjugate
Tube, a Test Strip, and Sample Diluent/Negative Control. The Conjugate Tube
contains a lyophilized bead of colloidal gold-linked polyclonal antibody to Legionella
pneumophila serogroup 1 detector antibody. The Test Strip carries a nitrocellulose
membrane with dried capture antibodies placed at a designated Test Line for
Legionella. The Test Strip holder caps the Conjugate Tube during testing and
subsequent disposal to reduce exposure to potential pathogens.
The conjugate bead is first rehydrated in the Conjugate Tube with the Sample
Diluent/Negative Control. Patient sample is then added, the contents mixed and the
Test Strip added. Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 antigens, if present, bind to the
2

--- Page 3 ---
antibody-colloidal gold conjugate. When the sample migrates up the Test Strip to the
Test Line, the antigen-conjugate complex is bound to the capture antibody, yielding a
pink-red line. When no antigen is present, no complexes are formed and no pink-red
line appears at the Test Line. An internal control line helps determine whether the
test has been executed properly, if kit reagents are performing appropriately and that
adequate flow has occurred through the Test Strip during a test run. A visible pink-
red line at the Control position of the Test Strip should be present each time a
specimen or control is tested. If no pink-red control line is seen, the test is considered
invalid.

Results from Studies Evaluating Diagnostic Tests
L. Test Principle:
The conjugate bead is first rehydrated in the Conjugate Tube with the Sample
Diluent/Negative Control. Patient sample is then added, the contents mixed and the
Test Strip added. Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 antigens, if present, bind to the
antibody-colloidal gold conjugate. When the sample migrates up the Test Strip to the
Test Line, the antigen-conjugate complex is bound to the capture antibody, yielding a
pink-red line. When no antigen is present, no complexes are formed and no pink-red
line appears at the Test Line. An internal control line helps determine whether the
test has been executed properly, if kit reagents are performing appropriately and that
adequate flow has occurred through the Test Strip during a test run. A visible pink-
red line at the Control position of the Test Strip should be present each time a
specimen or control is tested. If no pink-red control line is seen, the test is considered
invalid.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was assessed at three clinical laboratories using a blind coded
sample panel. The panel consisted of three contrived moderately positive
samples, three low positive samples at a concentration just above the limit of
detection, three high negative samples at a concentration just below the limit
of blank, and one natural negative sample. The panels were tested in two runs
at each site by two operators each day for five non-consecutive days.
Reproducibility was 100%.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Sample storage
A sample storage study was conducted to verify the sample preservation,
handling, and storage criteria included in the TRU Legionella package insert.
Aliquots of unpreserved and boric acid preserved positive and negative
samples were stored at the following temperatures to determine the worst case
storage time for each temperature range: room temperature (20-26 C) up to
5

--- Page 6 ---
eight days, refrigerated (2-8 C) up to eight days, conventional freezer (-16 to
-28 C) up to 31 days, and ultralow freezer (-66 to -84 C) up to 31 days. Ten
contrived samples were tested: four negatives, four positives, a high negative
sample, and a limit of detection positive. Samples were tested at various
times during storage. All samples produced the expected results. The data
supports test performance with preserved and unpreserved samples that are
stored for up to seven days at 2-8 C and 20-26 C, and/or stored for up to 30
days at ≤ -16 C.
Fresh versus frozen samples
A fresh versus frozen specimen study was conducted to verify that frozen
samples can be thawed multiple times without affecting the detection of the
measurand. Ten contrived samples were tested: four negatives, four positives,
a high negative sample, and a limit of detection positive. Unpreserved and
boric acid preserved specimens were tested. Baseline tests were run, and then
aliquots were tested every cycle for three freeze thaw cycles each at -16 to -28
C and at -66 to -84 C. All samples produced the expected results. The data
supports test performance with preserved and unpreserved samples that are
frozen and thawed up to two times.
Kit stability
Reagent stability was provisionally established using accelerated (stressed)
testing methods. TRU Legionella kits were stored at 3-7 C, 21-25 C, 40-44
C, and 48-52 C. Test performance was evaluated at various time points for
up to 65 or 104 days using a sample panel containing a negative sample, low
positive sample, reference standard, and both positive and negative controls.
The 2-8 C temperature range was used as T1 (initial or baseline temperature)
when calculating stability using the Q rule, with Q = 3. The 40-44 C and
10
48-52 C ranges were used as T2. Real-time stability studies are currently on-
going with testing performed at quarterly intervals and will be completed at
the end of 27 months.
All samples produced the expected result with kits stored at the different
temperatures and times. The data supports final product storage at 2-8 0C for
18 months.
High-dose hook effect
L. pneumophila Philadelphia and Bellingham strains were spiked into negative
donor urine and then serially diluted. A false negative result obtained with a
very high level of target antigen would indicate a high-dose hook effect.

L. pneumophila Philadelphia and Bellingham strains did not produce a
high-dose hook effect when tested at high concentrations with the TRU
Legionella assay.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical limit of detection (LoD) was determined for L. pneumophila
Philadelphia and Bellingham strains diluted in a negative human urine matrix.
The L. pneumophila antigen was serially diluted two-fold and 45 replicates of
each dilution were tested to determine the LoD in the TRU Legionella assay.

Bacteria, fungi (at a final concentrations of 1.2 x 108 CFU/ml), or viruses (at
concentrations greater than 1 x 105 TCID /ml) were added to negative urine
50
samples or to urine samples spiked with L. pneumophila serogroup 1 at its
limit of detection. None of the tested microorganisms cross-reacted with the
TRU Legionella assay.
Analytical reactivity
TRU Legionella was tested for its reactivity with Pontiac and non-Pontiac
strains of L. pneumophila. Aliquots of five Pontiac and four non-Pontiac
strains of L. pneumophila were adjusted to visually match a MacFarland
Standard 4.0 (approximately 1.2 x 109 CFU/mL) and then spiked into a natural
negative urine matrix to a final concentration of 1.2 x 106 CFU/mL. Three
non-Pontiac strains did not react at the concentration of 1.2 x 106 CFU/mL
and were retested at a higher concentration of 4.8 x 106 CFU/mL.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 is an important cause of travel, community
and hospital acquired pneumonia worldwide. Legionnaires’ disease (LD) is
known to occur sporadically and in outbreak settings. Recent data indicates that
0.5-5.0% of adults hospitalized for pneumonia has LD. Approximately 8,000-
18,000 cases of LD occur each year in the USA. With this assay, 111 positive
samples were tested, 5 were misidentified as negative; and 239 negative samples
were tested, all were correctly identified.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
