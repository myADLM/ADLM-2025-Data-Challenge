L. Test Principle:
The HealthproTM blood glucose test is based on the measurement of glucose concentration in
human blood. This enzyme assay, with a redox chemical “mediator” reaction, is used to
generate an electrical current proportional to the glucose concentration in the blood sample.
The system is designed as an amperometric measurement device using current generated
from the redox reaction as the measurable response.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within run precision was performed using five venous blood samples spiked with
glucose to achieve higher glucose concentration or allowed to age and undergo
glycolysis to achieve lower blood concentration. The samples tested ranged from 43
to 332 mg/dL. Each sample was tested 10 times on three test strip lots, using 10
meters per test strip lots for a n = 100 per test strip lot. The mean values and
coefficients of variation were calculated for each sample and are summarized below.

The intermediate precision evaluation was performed using three levels of control
solutions with glucose concentrations ranging from 30 to 420 mg/dL on three lots of
test strips, 10 replicates per day for 20 days. The glucose concentration of each
sample was determined using the blood-glucose monitoring system. The mean values

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed using fourteen different levels of venous whole
blood samples supplemented with a glucose stock solution to cover the claimed
measuring range from 20.0 to 600.0 mg/dL. Five measurements were taken from
each glucose level and measured using the Healthpro system. First order regression
analysis resulted in the equation y = 0.9925x + 1.4254 with an R2 = 0.9996. The
claimed measuring range is 20 to 600 mg/dL based on the linearity data.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The glucose control standards are traceable to a NIST glucose standard and are
prepared at three concentrations (Level 1 = 50 mg/dL, Level 2 = 110 mg/dL and
Level 3 = 300 mg/dL). The reference instrument used is the YSI 2300 Glucose
analyzer and is calibrated by YSI 2747 Glucose Standard which is a NIST traceable
glucose standard.
Stability
Accelerated stability study was conducted to assess the shelf-life and open-vial
stability of the control solutions and test strips. Real-time stability studies are still on-
going. Stability studies protocol and acceptance criteria were provided and found to
be adequate.
Unopened control solutions have a 24 month shelf life and are stable for 3 months
after first use when stored at 2 - 30 oC (35.6 - 86 oF).
Unopened test strips have a 24 month shelf-life and are stable for 3 months after first
use when stored at 2 - 30 oC (35.6 - 86 oF).
Expected values
The controls are prepared at three target concentrations gravimetrically and the
glucose concentrations are verified with the YSI reference method. The expected
values are verified for each new lot of strips.
d. Detection limit:
See linearity study above in section 1.b.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference study was designed according to CLSI EP7-A2 guideline. 26 common
endogenous and exogenous interfering substances were evaluated by spiking venous
blood to three levels of glucose concentrations (60, 150 and 300 mg/dL). The glucose
samples were then spiked with the potentially interfering compounds (6 concentration
including normal or therapeutic levels and high of toxic levels). Five meters were
used for this study. Each sample is tested in replicates of five and a total of 1950 test
8

--- Page 9 ---
strips were used. Bias was calculated as the mean percent difference in glucose
reading between the test and control concentration groups. The sponsor claims no
significant interference if bias between the tested and the control sample is <10%
difference. A summary of the concentrations of the potential interfering substances
tested is summarized in the table below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The accuracy of the HealthproTM Blood Glucose Monitoring System was assessed by
comparing blood glucose results obtained from patients with those obtained using the
YSI 2300, a laboratory instrument. A total of 160 samples were tested using 6 meters
and a total of 960 HealthproTM test strips.
Only unaltered capillary blood samples are used for glucose concentrations of 50
mg/dL to 400mg/dL. If necessary to obtain sufficient samples in the lowest and
highest concentration intervals, glucose concentrations may be adjusted. For
preparing some samples in very low glucose (< 50mg/dL) or very high glucose range
(>400mg/dL), blood was collected in capillary heparin tubes and then either
incubated to allow glucose to hydrolyse or supplemented with glucose. Capillary
whole blood glucose was then measured by the HealthproTM Blood Glucose
Monitoring System. The capillary whole blood was then centrifuged, and the plasma
glucose was measured by the YSI 2300 Auto analyzer. The data is summarized
below:

Lay user studies
One hundred and fifty (150) lay users fluent in English participated in the study.
Three clinical sites were used with fifty lay users per site. Each participant was given
a readability questionnaire, the instructions and the Healthpro™ system. Layperson’s
hematocrit value was measured with NOVA system. Each participant obtained
samples from their fingertip, dorsal hand, ventral palm, upper arm, forearm, calf and
thigh and tested these samples on the HealthproTM Blood Glucose Meter using only
the instructions in the user’s manual and test strip insert. A healthcare professional
collected blood from fingertip, dorsal hand, ventral palm, upper arm, forearm, calf,
and thigh and tested the sample using the same meter. Capillary blood was also
collected by healthcare professional and measured on an YSI-2300 Glucose Analyzer.
Linear regression results from lay users and professionals are presented below.

O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip, which is
directly applied to the test strip.
5. Calibration:
The device must be coded with the code found on the current test strip label. No further
calibration is required.
6. Quality Control:
There are three levels of glucose control solution (Level 1, 2 and 3) of which Level 2 is
included with the test kit and can be run with this device. Recommendations on when to
test the control materials are provided in the labeling. An acceptable range for each
control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the
meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study: The effect of different hematocrit levels on the performance of the
Healthpro™ Blood Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated using venous whole blood
samples with hematocrit levels of 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60% spiked with glucose to achieve 8
concentrations ranging from 32 to 530 mg/dL (32, 73, 121, 185, 253, 371, 459 and 530
mg/dL). Each sample was then tested 15 times and the values were compared with those
obtained from YSI 2300. The % biases relative to YSI were acceptable within the claimed
hematocrit range of 20 to 60%.
16

--- Page 17 ---
2. Altitude study: Venous whole blood samples collected from donors were spiked with
glucose to whole blood target levels of approximately 66, 220 and 349 mg/dL. Blood
glucose target concentrations were then verified by the reference YSI glucose analyzer.
Glucose measurements were obtained using the Healthpro™ Blood Glucose Monitoring
System in an altitude chamber with adjusted pO2 from 156 to 71 mmHg by tonometry
method blowing humidified mixed gas (O2, CO2 and N2) into the blood sample to adjust the
pO2 level of the blood. The results demonstrate acceptable bias to YSI to support the claims
in the labeling that altitudes up to 10,000 feet have no significant effect on blood glucose
measurements from the Healthpro™ Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
3. Sample volume study: The sponsor performed a study to verify the test strip sample
volume requirement and the test strip fill error requirement established for the Healthpro™
Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Blood samples were tested at six sample volumes (0.3,
0.5, 0.8, 1.0 and 1.5 μL) and values obtained were compared to YSI values. Results support
the claimed sample volume of 0.5 µL and the error code for insufficient sample volume.
4. Temperature and humidity studies: The sponsor performed temperature and humidity
studies using venous blood samples to evaluate temperatures ranging from 10ºC to 40ºC and
relative humidity from 10% to 90%. Meter results were compared to YSI 2300 reference
analyzer. Four temperature and humidity combinations were tested including low
temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity, high temperature/low humidity
and high temperature/high humidity. No significant effect (relative to YSI 2300 reference
analyzer) was observed with the temperature and humidity combinations tested. The results
support the claims in the labeling that the system can be used in conditions of 10 to 40°C
with relative humidity of 10 to 90%.
5. Infection Control Studies: The device is intended for single-patient use. Disinfection
efficacy studies were performed using materials that comprise the meter and lancing device
by an outside commercial testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis
B (HBV) with CaviWipes Disinfecting Towelettes with EPA registration #46781-8. The
sponsor also demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the external
materials of the meter and lancing device after 1,095 cleaning and disinfection cycles (one
cycle includes one cleaning wipe plus one disinfecting wipe) to simulate 3 years of meter and
lancing device use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated
cleaning and disinfection procedures.
6. The data transmission capability, data transmission port and Healthpro™ Software
(firmware and communication) was evaluated in usability study and found to be acceptable.
Additionally verification and validation of these functions were conducted and found to be
acceptable.
7. EMC testing was evaluated and certified by UL Verification Service and Verification of
Compliance certificates provided.
8. Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the results demonstrated that
the User Manual, test strip package insert and control solution package insert were written at
the 7.8, 7.9 and 7.6 grade levels respectively.
