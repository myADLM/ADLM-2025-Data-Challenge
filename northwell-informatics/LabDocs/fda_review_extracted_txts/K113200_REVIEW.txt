L. Test Principle:
Each VITEK® 2 test card contains 64 microwells. A control well, that contains only
microbiological culture medium is resident on all cards, with the remaining wells
containing premeasured amounts of a specific antibiotic combined with culture
medium. A suspension of organism is made in 0.45-0.5% sterile saline from a pure
culture and standardized to a McFarland 0.5 standard using the DensiChek. The
desired card(s) are placed in the cassette along with an empty tube for the
susceptibility card. The cassette is placed in the VITEK® 2 instrument where a
susceptibility test will be automatically diluted from the ID suspension by the
VITEK® 2. The cards are then automatically vacuum filled; the tubes are cut and the
cards sealed prior to proceeding to the Incubator Loading Station. Cards are then
transferred from the cassette into the carousel for incubation (35.5o C) and optical
scanning during testing. Readings are performed every 15 minutes.

In addition to the automatic dilution, there is also a manual inoculation dilution
procedure described in the packager insert.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Studies were conducted to evaluate a new Piperacillin/tazobactam susceptibility
panel, tzp03n, which contains new media formulation and different drug
concentrations from the original test panels. This modification was made to address a
Class I recall of the previous product (tzp02n) which was on the market.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using 10 isolates at three sites on
three separate days in triplicates. The study included the Auto-dilution
and the Manual dilution for VITEK 2 and Manual dilution for VITEK
2 Compact. The majority of the MIC values were on-scale.
For reproducibility calculations, off-scale values are handled in two
ways; “best case” and “worst case” scenarios. Best case calculation for
reproducibility assumes the off-scale result is within one well from the
mode MIC value. Worst case calculation for reproducibility assuming
the off-scale result is greater than one well from the mode MIC value.
The overall reproducibility was >95% with +/- one dilution
observation for all three methods. For Automatic Dilution, the VITEK
2 Gram Negative Piperacillin/tazobactam gave overall reproducibility
values of 96.7% and 88.9% based on best case and worst case
calculations, respectively. For Manual Dilution, the VITEK 2 Gram
Negative Piperacillin/tazobactam gave overall reproducibility values
of 95.9% and 90.0% based on best case and worst case calculations,
respectively.
A similar reproducibility study was conducted by testing on the
VITEK 2 Compact instrument. The VITEK 2 Gram Negative
Piperacillin/tazobactam gave overall reproducibility values of 99.5%
and 97.2% based on best case and worst case calculations,
respectively. Only Manual Dilution testing was conducted since the
VITEK 2 Compact system does not have a functionality to support
automatic dilution to inoculate the card.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable

--- Page 6 ---
Page 6 of 10
c. Traceability (controls, calibrators, or method):
Three recommended QC (E. coli ATCC 25922, E. coli
ATCC 35218 and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853) were tested a
minimum 20 times/site by the automatic dilution and the manual
dilution. The organisms were tested by the VITEK 2 AST cards and
the reference (broth microdilution) methods.
Both the Auto dilution and the Manual dilution methods are within the
expected range >95% of the time. The Reference Results are similar to
the test results. In instances where any organism was out of range for
the reference method, all testing data was invalid and repeated.
The following table provides the frequency of results for all sites in
each concentration with the expected range stated. The Reference
method results produced QC results that are on scale and within the
expected QC ranges for all organisms 100% of the time.
The QC results obtained with the VITEK 2 Gram Negative
Piperacillin/tazobactam are not on-scale because the calling range (≤4
- ≥128 μg/mL) does not cover the low end of the expected MIC values
for any of the recommended QC strains. Although the QC strains
selected had ranges at the lower end, that were reflected in the
Reference test, the VITEK system could not detect variations at the
low end of the MIC range using these three QC strains. However,
these QC strains will allow detection of trends at the high end of the
QC range, such as would occur in cases of degradation of the drug.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A clinical study was performed at three external sites using the VITEK 2
AST-GN Piperacillin/tazobactam and broth microdilution panels
containing Piperacillin/tazobactam. The study included 2358 clinical
isolates (1253 clinical isolates and 1105 additional surveillance isolates-
referred to as “expanded” panel were tested as part of evaluating the new
formulation, tz03n) and a challenge set of 95 isolates. The expanded
surveillance study data was combined with the original clinical trial data
set. Therefore, performance is based on the combined data set of 2453
(clinical, surveillance and challenge isolates). Stock isolates were
approximately 28% of all clinical isolates.
Two methods of inoculation (manual and automated) were evaluated.
Clinical testing was performed by the automated method of inoculation
and the challenge set was by both the manual and the automated methods.
All isolates grew in the VITEK®2 cards in less than 16 hours.
The test device had a growth rate of >95% for the clinical and the
challenge study. Overall, there were 5 very major errors (0.8% error rate,
5/565 resistant isolates), 40 major errors (2.1% error rate, 40/1888
susceptible isolates), and 123 minor errors. These overall error rates are
acceptable (see separate analysis for P. aeruginosa, since a large number
of the major error rates occurred with this organism).

For P. aeruginosa, there were 24 major errors observed among 182 isolates
classified as susceptible. This represents a major error rate of 13.1%, which
does not meet the acceptable criteria of ≤3%. Since there is no intermediate
category in the susceptibility interpretative criteria for P. aeruginosa
discrepant results are either very major error (vmj) or a major error (maj).
This high major error rate for P. aeruginosa indicates that a false resistance
call occurred at an unacceptable rate. Based on this performance, and in
order to avoid reporting of false resistance to this drug, the package insert
will include a limitation instructing the user to perform an alternative
method when a resistant results is obtained with Piperacillin/tazobactam
when testing P. aeruginosa.
Manual Dilution:
The challenge set of 95 organisms was also tested at one site using the
manual method of inoculation with the following performance. There was
no difference in the overall CA agreement.
