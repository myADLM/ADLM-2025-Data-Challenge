L. Test Principle:
LA Positive control is a lyophilized preparation from human donors with anti-
phospholipid antibodies with added buffer. LA Negative control is a lyophilized
preparation of a pool of normal human citrated platelet-poor plasma. The controls are
used to assess the precision and accuracy of Lupus Anticoagulant (LA) assays

performed on IL Coagulation instrument platforms using HemosIL LA Reagents (LA

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To evaluate precision 9 vials were run over 1 day from 3 lots (27 samples
total) for each control and were analyzed on the ACL TOP base analyzer with
both the HemosIL dRVVT Screen and dRVVT Confirm assays. Normalized
Ratios (NR) were calculated as described below. Acceptance criteria were set
at a NR of ≥1.4 for the Positive Control, and a NR of ≤1.2 for the Negative
Control. Both LA Controls met precision specifications.
To evaluate reproducibility, 2 lots of each Control were tested with a single lot
of HemosIL dRVVT Screen and dRVVT Confirm assay on representative
members of the instrument families for 20 days with 2 runs per day and 2
replicates for each run for each sample level (N=80 per level/instrument/lot).
Testing was done on the following instruments: ACL TOP/500CTS, ACL
10000, ACL Advance, and ACL Classic. Acceptance criteria for both within-
run and total reproducibility were set at a CV ≤6%. Both LA Controls met
reproducibility specifications.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability:
The lyophilized shelf life for the LA Controls is 24 months at 2-8°C.
After reconstitution the LA Controls are stable for 24 hours at 2-8°C and 21
days at -20°C in the closed original vials.
The on-board stability of the LA Controls after reconstitution are:
24 hours on the ACL TOP Family
4 hours on the ACL ELITE/ELITE PRO 8/9/10000
4 hours on the ACL Futura/ACL Advance
4 hours on the ACL Classic (100-7000) System
Freezing stability claim:
Fresh vials were reconstituted and assayed at time 0 at the same time that the
frozen vials were thawed in a 37°C water bath. Two vials per time point per
lot were pooled and assayed and the results were compared to the mean of the
results from fresh vials at time 0. Each lot was assayed with the LAC Screen,
LAC Confirm, SCT Screen, SCT Confirm, dRVVT Screen, and dRVVT
Confirm assays.
Acceptance criteria are ±10% of the zero point.
%Variation = (Test clot time (sec))-(Zero point clot time (sec))/Zero point clot
time (sec) x100%
Because the LA Negative Controls were not stable at the 32 day time point,
the 22 day time point was assayed and the acceptance criteria were met.
The LA Positive Controls was stable at the 32 day time point.

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected values were based on determined normalized ratios (NR). The NR
acceptance criterion for the HemosIL LA Positive Control was set at ≥1.40, which
is the same as that for the HemosIL LA Positive Control and LA Negative Control
with the LAC and Silica Clotting Time assays. The Negative Control NR
acceptance criterion was established based on the normal cut-off for the dRVVT
assay, which is 1.2. Therefore the acceptance criterion for the negative control is
set at ≤1.2.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
