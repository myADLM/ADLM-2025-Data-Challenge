I. Device Description:
Lactate is a new parameter offered on the RAPIDPoint 500 instrument (formerly the
RAPIDPoint 405 instrument) previously cleared under k002738, k020616, and
k110277. The RP500 system is a point-of-care and laboratory testing blood gas
analyzer and currently measures pCO , p O , pH, sodium, potassium, calcium,
2 2
chloride, glucose, fO Hb, fCOHb, fMetHb, fHHb and neonatal bilirubin. The
2
measurement of lactate is accomplished through modification of the existing RP500
software and the addition of an integrated lactate sensor into a new RP500
Measurement Cartridge, which is a RP405 Measurement cartridge modified for
lactate. To facilitate the lactate measurement, the RP500 Measurement Cartridge
includes a modified reagent and the integrated lactate sensor chip.

L. Test Principle:
The lactate measurement is performed by a sensor that incorporates amperometric
technology. The lactate biosensor is a complete electrochemical cell. A constant
voltage, called a polarizing voltage, is maintained during analysis. In the lactate
sensor, lactic acid from the sample interacts with the lactate oxidase on the surface of
the measuring electrode to form pyruvic acid and hydrogen peroxide. The polarizing
voltage is sufficient to cause oxidation of the hydrogen peroxide to oxygen. The loss
of electrons in the oxidation of H O creates a current flow that is directly
2 2
proportional to the lactate concentration in the sample.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was conducted with lithium heparinized whole blood
samples ranging from 0.11 to 30.15 mmol. The samples were run in replicates
of six on one analyzer in syringe mode. The result of linear regression
analysis is summarized below:
Slope 0.979
Intercept 0.087
R2 0.9854
The execution of first, second and third order linear regression did not indicate
statistically significant non linear regression coefficients in either the 2nd order
or 3rd order models.
The reportable range of this device for lactate measurements is 0.18 to 30
mmol/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators: There is a 2 point calibration using automated on-board reagents.
The 2.0 mmol/L lactate calibrator value assignment is conducted using the
lactate oxidase spectrophotometric method and is traceable to a commercially
available standard. The production lots are value assigned against the
standard in several test runs using multiple samples in multiple replicates
against multiple replicates of the standard on one instrument. Previously
released lots are tested in each run. The protocols and acceptance criteria for
the sponsor’s pre-defined acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy were
reviewed and found to be adequate.
Quality Control Materials: Quality Control materials recommended for use
with this system were previously cleared under k970956. The automatic
quality control materials (AQC) cartridge was previously cleared under
k020616.
Reagent and calibrator stability: The sponsor evaluated the device’s stability
claims following a protocol designed to evaluate the measurement cartridge
shelf life under customer use conditions. The sponsor monitors the

performance of the device using whole blood samples, quality control samples
and calibration verification materials that are evaluated at a day (pre-
determined as the designated test point) for each monthly stability interval.
Since the calibrators are within the reagent cartridge, the stability of the
calibrators is monitored along with the reagent stability. The proposed
protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be adequate.
d. Detection limit:
For the Detection Limit studies, 2 lots of sensors and 2 lots of reagents were
used. The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined using the wash reagent (no
lactate added). One lot of wash reagent was analyzed in replicates of 11 on 2
instruments over 5 days (for a total of 5 reagent lots). The results were found
not to be Gaussian. Therefore, the LOB was determined as the non-
parametric 95th percentile. The LoB was calculated to be 0.09 mmol/L.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined using lithium heparinized
whole blood collected from 5 donors. Eleven replicates of each sample were
analyzed on 2 analyzers over 5 days. The LoD was calculated as LoD = LoB
+ C *SD where SD is the pooled standard deviation and C was calculated
b b
according to the following formula: C ¸ (1-1¸(4 x degrees of freedom of the
b
estimated SD). The LoD was calculated to be 0.11 mmol/L.
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) was determined using lithium heparinized
whole blood collected from 5 donors. Each sample was analyzed in replicates
of 5 on 4 instruments over 7 days. The LoQ was defined as the lowest
concentration tested at which the %CV of the device is less than 20%. The
LoQ was determined to be 0.18 mmol/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies:
Lithium heparinized whole blood samples were spiked to either 0.7 mmol/L or
2.6 mmol/L lactate. The samples were split and either spiked with an
interferent or an equivalent volume of solvent and then run on 2 instruments
in syringe mode using 2 lots of sensors. The low lactate samples were
measured in replicates of 8 and the high lactate samples were measured in
replicates of 5.
The bias was calculated using the following formula:
Bias = (mean test-mean control)
The percent interference was calculated using the following formula:
% interference = (bias/mean control)*100.
The sponsor defined no interference if the bias was within ± 10%.
