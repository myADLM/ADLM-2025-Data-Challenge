4. Special instrument requirements: None
I. Device Description:
Each tube of Puritan UTM – RT consists of modified Hank’s balanced salt solution,
gelatin and bovine serum albumin as stabilizers, sucrose, glutamic acid and (4-(2-
hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid )( HEPES). The presence of buffered
salts in the medium protects pathogens that are sensitive to pH changes. Gelatin and
bovine serum albumin are source of nutrition to support viability of fastidious bacteria
during storage and transport. Sucrose aids in the preservation of viruses and chlamydiae
when specimens are frozen for prolonged storage. Antimicrobial agents are incorporated
to minimize commensal bacterial and fungal contamination. Phenol red is added to act as
a pH indicator. Puritan UTM-RT is comprised of a conical polypropylene vial filled with
three 3-mm glass beads and 1.5ml or 3 mL of the transport medium, affixed with a high
density polyethylene cap. Each unit of Puritan UTM-RT is provided in a peel pouch
containing one of the following swab combinations:
· 1ml UTM with ultrafine tip HydraFlock® Swab
· 3ml UTM with one elongated tip HydraFlock® and one ultrafine tip swab
· 3ml UTM with elongated tip HydraFlock®® swab
· 3ml UTM with mini-tip HydraFlock® swab, scored shaft
· 3ml UTM with ultrafine HydraFlock® tip swab
· 3ml UTM vial with 2 regular polyester tip swabs, scored shaft
· 3ml UTM vial with regular polyester tip and one wire/plastic shaft with polyester
tip

Varicella Zoster Virus
Among bacteria, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma
pneumoniae, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were used for testing.
The survival and recovery of viruses, chlamydiae, mycoplasmas and ureaplasmas was
tested to determine the performance characteristics of Puritan Universal Transport
Medium (UTM-RT). Neat stocks of the above microorganisms were prepared for testing.
Two different dilutions of the neat stock suspensions were prepared and, from these, 100
µl were directly inoculated onto swabs in triplicate. The swabs were transferred into the
transport medium and held at both 4o C and room temperature (20-25o C) for the required
amount of time. At key time points following inoculation (0, 24, and 48 h), each sample
was vortexed after which an aliquot of the suspension was inoculated into shell vials or
suitable culture media. Viability of viruses and chlamydiae was determined by shell vial
assay followed by immunostaining and enumeration of fluorescent foci. The viability of
mycoplasmas and ureaplasmas was determined using direct culture methods onto
appropriate growth media followed by enumeration of colony forming units (CFU).
Cultures were processed by standard laboratory techniques and examined following
optimal incubation periods.
The results of the study are presented in Tables 1-3. The results demonstrate the ability
of Puritan Medical Products UTM-RT to sustain the viability and recovery of test
bacteria and viruses for at least 48 h at 4o C and room temperature (20-25oC). Viability
of microorganisms in the Puritan UTM - RT transport system other than the ones listed
above was not tested and is not known. It should be validated by the user.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
pH Stability: The pH of the test device was measured at predetermined time
intervals up to 18 month after the manufacturing date. The test was performed
using calibrated pH meter with random samples from three different lots of
Puritan UTM-RT. All samples tested were found to maintain pH within the
specified target range.
Antibiotics Stability Test: Antibiotics stability of test device was evaluated
using three expired lots and a new lot of test device and compared to the predicate
device. All products tested demonstrated the ability to control bacterial activities
up to 72 hours.
Cytotoxicity: Cytotoxicity testing using an MRC-5 cell line in conjunction with
a standard Sulforhodamine B assay demonstrated no cellular toxicity associated
with three lots of test devices when statistically compared to negative controls.
Sterilization: All plastic components of Puritan UTM-RT are validated and
sterilized following ANSI/AAMI/ISO 11137:2006, Sterilization of health care
products-Radiation or by ANSI/AAMI/ISO11135:2007, Sterilization of health

f. Interfering Substances: Not applicable
g. Assay cut-off: Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device: Method comparison is not applicable
for a transport medium. The performance of the test device is compared to the
predicate by analytical studies or bench testing concerning viral and bacterial
recovery.
Recovery comparison: For both transport systems, test viruses and bacteria were
quantified during 48 hours at the two storage temperatures as described above for
tables 1 to 3. Culture recovery data between the test and predicate devices were
statistically analyzed and compared. One-way ANOVA demonstrated statistically
significant differences (P<0.05) between the two devices under certain conditions.
The differences were considered to be the result of normal microbiological variability
and thus not significant from a clinical stand point. Qualitative and not quantitative
results are most often the critical endpoint in the clinical diagnosis of an infectious
agent.
It is concluded that under the conditions of testing the test organisms could be
recovered from the new device just as with the comparator thus making it a valid
system for the collection, storage, and transport of clinical specimens.
b. Matrix comparison: Not applicable
