L. Test Principle:
Potentiometric Chemistries
The sodium, potassium and chloride are measured using ion-selective electrodes. Each
electrode uses ion-specific membrane to measure the difference in ionic concentration
between an inner electrolyte solution and the sample. The difference causes an electro-
chemical potential to form on the membrane of the active electrode. The measured voltage
difference of the sample and CAL A are used to determine the ion concentration in the
sample. Two solutions contained in the ISE reagent pack CAL A and CAL B are used to
perform a two-point calibration of the ion selective electrodes (ISE)
Photometric Chemistries
ACE Glucose Reagent - Glucose in serum reacts with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the
presence of hexokinase (HK) and magnesium with the formation of glucose-6-phosphate (G-
6-P) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD)
catalyzes the oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate with NAD+ to form 6-phosphogluconate and
NADH. NADH absorbs strongly at 340 nm, whereas NAD+ does not. The total amount of
NADH formed is proportional to the initial amount of glucose present. The rate of increase in
absorbance, monitored bichromatically at 340 nm/450 nm, is directly proportional to the
glucose concentration in the sample.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity across the assay range was confirmed by spiking serum samples to a high
concentration of analyte, then diluting the sample to obtain 1-14 levels to cover the
measuring range of each assay. The assigned value of the highest sample was set to its
mean value. The assigned values of the other levels were calculated by multiplying the
mean value by the ratios obtained from the manufacturer. Each level was tested in
replicates of four. Results are summarized below:

Results of the study support the sponsor claims for the following measuring/linearity
ranges:
Sodium Potassium Chloride Glucose
40-205 mmol/L 1.5 – 15 mmol/L 50 – 200 mmol/L 3 – 750 mg/dL
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The ISE calibrator material was previously cleared under k933862 and glucose calibrator
(Gemcal) was previously cleared under k930104.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor determined that the detection limit was defined by the linear range study.
Please refer to the linearity study for Na, K and Cl.
In addition, the sponsor performed a detection limits study for glucose based on a
modified protocol according to the CLSI EP17-A. The limit of blank was determined by
assaying five low samples (serum samples) and five true blanks (human serum albumin
in saline). Testing was carried out over three days on two ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry
Analyzers. Serum samples and true blanks were assayed every day for a total of 60
measurements. LoD and LoQ were determined by running 5 low samples testing 8
replicates/day for 5 days for a total of 40 measurements. The LoB was calculated to be
2.5 mg/dL and LoD was calculated to be 3.1 mg/dL. The LoQ was determined to be 3
mg/dL for glucose with an inter-assay precision of <11.6% CV.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed to determine the effects from potential
interferents. The various concentration of interferent was spiked into serum pools
containing glucose, sodium, potassium and chloride at normal and abnormal
concentrations. All samples were tested in triplicate. Seven levels were tested for each
interferent. The sponsor states that interferences are considered to be non-significant
if the bias between the tested and control samples are within ±10% for all the
analytes.
The tested ranges and analyte concentrations are listed in the tables below:

Based on the hemolysis interference, the sponsor has the following limitations in their
labeling:
“Do not use hemolyzed samples for potassium since significant hemolysis may
increase K concentration because of high levels of K in erythrocytes”.
“Drugs and other substances may affect sodium, potassium, chloride, and glucose
determinations. See Young, D.S.1 for a compilation of reported interferences”

5. Calibration:
On demand calibration. It is recommended to perform a calibration measurement after
installing a new or fresh bottle of reagent and/or intervals that are defined for a particular test.
It is recommended to recalibrate ISEs after installing a new lot of calibration solution. ISE
calibration is required every 3 hours or when quality control results fall outside the
established range after replacing electrode, and after ISE cleaning maintenance.
6. Quality Control:
Controls are run manually and recommended daily. Results can be stored in instrument
memory for future use.
7. Room Temperature:
An ambient temperature study was conducted to show the affects on sample results when
room temperature fluctuates (from 59 – 80oF) . Five serum samples with analyte
concentrations covering the medical decision points were tested. Calibrations were
performed at each of these temperatures (59 oF, 70 oF, and 80oF) and testing was
performed at all the three temperatures for each calibration temperature. Room
temperatures were set and maintained by thermostats in the facility. Temperatures were
recorded during the study. Protocols and acceptance criteria provided are found to be
adequate. Based on the ambient temperature study, the sponsor claimed that ambient
temperature between 59 – 80oF will not affect the performance of the device.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
None
