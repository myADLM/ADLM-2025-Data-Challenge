L. Test Principle:
The ACE Cholesterol Reagent: Cholesterol esters in serum are completely hydrolyzed by
cholesterol esterase to free cholesterol and free fatty acids. The cholesterol liberated by the
esterase, plus any endogenous free cholesterol, are oxidized by cholesterol oxidase to yield
hydrogen peroxide (H O ), which then reacts oxidatively with p-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-
2 2
aminoantipyrine (AAP) in a reaction catalyzed by peroxidase, producing a red colored
quinoneimine complex. The amount of chromogen formed, determined by quantitatively
measuring the increase in absorbance at 505 nm/647 nm, is directly proportional to the
cholesterol concentration in the sample.
The ACE HDL-C Reagent is composed of two bottles: Buffer Reagent (R1) and Color
Reagent (R2). R2 contains a unique detergent, which solubilizes only the HDL lipoprotein
particles; the detergent also inhibits the reaction of the cholesterol enzymes with LDL and
VLDL lipoproteins and chylomicrons by adsorbing to their surfaces. The solubilized HDL
cholesterol is released and reacts with cholesterol esterase and cholesterol oxidase and a
chromogen 4-Aminoantipyrine to produce a color product measurable by the increase of

absorbance at 505/647 nm, which is directly proportional to the cholesterol concentration in
the sample.
The ACE LDL-C Reagent: There are two detergents, Detergent 1 and Detergent 2, in the
ACE LDL-C Reagents R1 and R2 respectively. In the first reaction, Detergent 1 solubilizes
non-LDL lipoprotein particles (HDL, VLDL and chylomicrons) and releases cholesterol. The
cholesterol is consumed by cholesterol esterase and cholesterol oxidase in a non-color
forming reaction. In a second reaction, detergent 2 solubilizes the remaining LDL particles
and forms peroxide, via the enzymes cholesterol esterase and cholesterol oxidase. The
peroxide, in the presence of peroxidase and two peroxidase substrates, 4-aminoantipyrine and
DSBmT, results in a purple-red color product measurable by the increase of absorbance at
505/647 nm, which is directly proportional to the cholesterol concentration in the sample.
The ACE Triglycerides Reagent: The ACE Triglycerides Reagent is composed of a single
reagent bottle. Triglycerides in serum are hydrolyzed by lipase to form glycerol and free
fatty acids. In the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and glycerol kinase (GK), the
glycerol is converted to glycerol-I-phosphate (G-I-P) and the ATP to adenosine diphosphate
(ADP). Glycerol-I-phosphate is oxidized by glycerol phosphate oxidase (GPO) to yield
hydrogen peroxide (H O ). The hydrogen peroxide then acts to oxidatively couple p-
2 2
chlorophenol and 4-aminoantipyrine (AAP) in a reaction catalyzed by peroxidase, producing
a red colored quinoneimine complex which absorbs strongly at 505 nm.
