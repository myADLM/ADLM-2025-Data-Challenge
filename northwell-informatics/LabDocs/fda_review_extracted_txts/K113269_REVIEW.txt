L. Test Principle:
In the presence of Mg2+, Zn2+ and AMP as a phosphate acceptor, alkaline phosphatase
hydrolyzes p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate into inorganic phosphate and p-
nitrophenol (yellow compound with an absorbance peak at 405 nm). The rate of the
formation of p-nitrophenol is directly proportional to the alkaline phosphatase activity
as follows:
→
p-NPP + H O Inorganic phosphate + p-Nitrophenol (yellow; can be measured
2
using a 405 nm spectrophotometer)
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
This study followed the CLSI EP5-A2 “Evaluation of Precision Performance
of Clinical Chemistry Devices” guideline. Within-run and Total Precision
studies were performed for alkaline phosphatase. Studies were performed by
conducting 2 runs per day, two measurements per run, for 3 levels of serum-
based samples and 2 levels of controls, on 2 Selectra ProM analyzers for 20
operating days. Data for level 1 is from a diluted human serum pool sample,
level 2 is from a natural serum pool sample, and level 3 is from a spiked
human serum pool sample. Two lots of reagent were used for the study. The
results are summarized in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was conducted based on the CLSI EP06-A guideline by
comparing observed versus expected values for 11 equally-spaced serum
samples. Two pools of patient serum samples were prepared to obtain one
high and one low concentration. A high concentration of sample was obtained
by spiking the serum pool (1023 U/L) and a low concentration of sample was
prepared by diluting the sample pool with buffered saline solution (20 U/L).
Using the high and low pooled samples, eleven levels of inter-mixtures with
equidistant activities were prepared, with all samples assayed in triplicate on
one Selectra ProM instrument. Data was analyzed using 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order
least square regressions. A 1st order linear regression was generated as
follows:
T Slope Intercept R2 r Standard Concentration
h Error (U/L) Ranges tested
eA LP 0.9681 3.1406 0.9996 0.9998 7 20-1023 U/L
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claim that the ALP IFCC SL
assay is linear across the measuring range of 20 to 1023 U/L.
Dilution Study:
The sponsor performed a 1:10 manual dilution study with 10 spiked samples
using saline as the diluent. Ten spiked serum samples with ALP analyte
concentrations between 991 and 9874 U/L were diluted 1:10. The %
recoveries between the expected and observed values are within 10%.
Therefore, the sponsor claimed that the ALP concentration greater than the
upper claimed measuring range (1023 U/L) can be diluted manually 1:10 with
saline.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The sponsor claims that the Elitech ALP IFCC SL assay is
traceable to the IFCC formulation (Tietz, 1983), by manual measurement.
Stability of the reagent: The shelf-life of ALP IFCC SL reagents is 18 months
(tested using 2 lots) when stored at 2 to 8°C. The shelf-life stability is based
on their real-time stability study, which is still on-going. The on-board
stability and calibration frequency is 1 day. Shelf-life and on-board stability
study protocols have been provided and found to be adequate.
d. Detection limit:
The Limits of Blank (LoB), Detection (LoD) and Quantitation (LoQ) studies
were conducted following the CLSI EP17-A guideline for ALP IFCC SL.
Two Selectra Pro M analyzers and two lots of a validated reagent were used.
The LoB values were determined by analyzing a blank sample 60 times using
2 reagent lots over 2 analyzers over multiple days. The LoD and LoQ studies
each used 4 diluted sample pools prepared from 4 different patient sample
pools of known activities in order to obtain an activity close to four times the
calculated value of the LoB or the expected LoQ, respectively. LoD and LoQ
values were determined by measuring each of the 4 diluted sample pools 15
times (measuring low activity of analyte for LoD and samples diluted in saline
for LoQ) in one run across two analyzers using two reagent lots on multiple
days (2-5 days).Results are summarized below:
LoB LoD LoQ
Detection Limits 4 U/L 6 U/L 20 U/L
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed according to the CLSI EP7-A2 guideline
for alkaline phosphatase. Seven to nine increasing concentrations of potential
interferents, tested in triplicate, were spiked into low (150 U/L), medium (250
U/L), and high (900 U/L) levels of pooled patient serum samples. The
sponsor’s definition of no significant interference is <10% difference between
the tested and the control samples. There was no significant interference
between alkaline phosphatase and interferents in the concentration ranges
indicated in the table below:
