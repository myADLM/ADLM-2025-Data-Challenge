I. Device Description:
VITEK 2 AST card containing the test is inoculated with a standardized suspension of
the organism to be tested. The VITEK 2 System automatically fills, seals, and places
the card into the incubator/reader while the VITEK 2 Compact System has manual
filling, sealing and loading operation. The incubated card is optically monitored by
the VITEK 2 Systems for growth within each well in the card throughout the
incubation cycle. At the completion of incubation, results are automatically calculated
once a predetermined growth threshold is reached. A report is then generated that

contains the MIC value and the interpretive category result (S, I, R) for each
antibiotic contained on the card.

L. Test Principle:
Automated growth based detection using attenuation of light measured by an optical
scanner. The optics used in the systems use visible light to directly measure organism
growth. Transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before
significant growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same
well measure organism growth by how much light is prevented from going through
the well. The VITEK 2 System monitors the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period of time. An interpretive call is made between 4 and 16 hours for a
“rapid” read but may be extended to 18 hours in some instances. At the completion of
the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the
interpretive category result for each antibiotic on the card. The VITEK® 2
Streptococcus Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole card has the following
Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole concentrations of 8/152, 16/304 and 64/1216

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was conducted at three study sites. Ten isolates of
Streptococcus pneumoniae were tested at each site and testing was performed
in triplicate over three days with The VITEK® 2 Streptococcus
Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole. The testing was performed using both the
manual dilution method and the automated dilution mode. Testing was
conducted on the VITEK 2 instrument.
For the sake of reproducibility calculations, off-scale values are handled in
two ways; “best case” and “worst case” scenarios. Best case calculation for
reproducibility assumes the off-scale result is within one well from the mode
MIC value. Worst case calculation for reproducibility assuming the off-scale
result is greater than one well from the mode MIC value.
There were no off-scale MIC values. The overall reproducibility was 100%
with +/- one dilution observation for Automatic and Manual Dilution
methods.
A similar reproducibility study was conducted by testing on the VITEK 2
Compact instrument. The VITEK® 2 Streptococcus
Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole card gave a reproducibility of 100% by
Manual Dilution. Only Manual Dilution testing was conducted since the
VITEK 2 Compact system does not have a functionality to support automatic
dilution to inoculate the card.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
One QC isolate of Streptococcus pneumoniae was tested on every test
occasion with the reference method and the VITEK 2 System. The reference
method QC results were in range for every day tested. The VITEK 2 and
reference testing was performed a minimum of twenty times by each method
at each site. There were some instances were either VITEK or reference
results were out of range. In such instances where any organism was out of
range for the reference method, all data from that day’s testing was considered
5

--- Page 6 ---
invalid and that day’s testing was repeated.
Quality Control was performed during the studies using both the auto-dilution
and the manual method of diluting the organisms on the VITEK 2 System.
Results demonstrated that methods were comparable.

reports MIC values as a combined concentration of Trimethoprim plus
Sulfamethoxazole based on a ratio of 1:19.
Quality Control results for the VITEK 2 System using either inoculation
dilution method demonstrated that the VITEK 2 System could produce the
expected QC ranges with an acceptable rate.
A similar QC study was conducted to evaluate the VITEK 2 Compact System.
Results were compared to the expected CLSI QC results. All results for the
VITEK 2 Compact System were within the expected QC ranges 100% of the
time.
Inoculum density control was monitored using the DensiChek2 instrument.
This was standardized weekly with all results recorded and in the expected
range.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Performance was established through a clinical study which was conducted at
four external sites. A total of 306 clinical isolates were tested by the VITEK®
2 Streptococcus Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole. The vast majority of the
isolates were recently isolated from clinical specimens. A challenge set
consisting of 50 isolates was also evaluated. Testing was done using the
VITEK® 2 Streptococcus Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole and the broth
microdilution method using cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton (MH) broth. The
MH broth was incubated at 35°C in ambient air for up to 16-20 hours. The
inoculum was prepared with direct colony suspension. The testing included
both fresh clinical isolates and stock isolates along with a challenge set with
known results. Two methods of inoculation (manual and auto dilution) were
evaluated. Clinical testing was performed using the automated method of
inoculation and the challenge set was tested using both the manual and the
auto dilution method. A comparison was provided to the reference method
with the following agreement.

Essential agreement (EA) is when the VITEK 2 panels agree with the
reference test panel results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the
reference method. Category agreement (CA) is when the VITEK 2 panel
result interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result
interpretation. Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the
VITEK 2 and the reference and have on-scale EA.
EA was not evaluated since this is a qualitative test. However, CA of 96.1% was
observed for both clinical and challenge isolates, which is an acceptable
