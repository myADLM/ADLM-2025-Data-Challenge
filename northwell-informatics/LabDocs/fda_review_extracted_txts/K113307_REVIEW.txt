L. Test Principle:
The GL GoodLife and GL GoodLife Professional Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems
use Glucose dehydrogenase-FAD enzyme chemistry as the standard dry reagent assay
for glucose in whole blood. A glucose dehydrogenase sensor based on the carbon
electrode adopting the amperometric assay utilizes the enzyme glucose
dehydrogenase to catalyze the formation of gluconolactone for the oxidation of
glucose. As a result of this reaction, two electrons are produced forming an electrical
current that is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the sample.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The GoodLife AC-300 Blood Glucose Meter was chosen as the representative meter
for the twelve meter models in the single and multiple patient use meter model series.
The AC-300 meter was used for all performance studies as the twelve meter models
are identical; the only differences between each meter are the shape of the meter and
the size and shape of the buttons; however the functions of all twelve meters are
identical. The GL GoodLife and GL GoodLife Professional Blood Glucose
Monitoring Systems utilizes test strips under two names: GL GoodLife AC Blood
Glucose Test Strips (for models: AC-300, AC-301, AC-302, AC-303, AC-304, AC-
305) and GL GoodLife AC Professional Blood Glucose Test Strips (for models: AC-
300 professional, AC-301 professional, AC-302 professional, AC-303 professional,
AC-304 professional, AC- 305 professional glucose meters)
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run precision was measured by using EDTA venous whole blood as
the anti-coagulant at six different glucose concentrations. Each blood sample
was adjusted to a hematocrit level ranging from 30-55% and verified by an
automated method. Each sample was tested on 3 lots of test strips on 30
meters (10 meters per test strip lot). Ten replicates were tested per meter, test
strip lot, and glucose concentration, (N=100 per test strip). Results are
summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity study was designed following CLSI EP6-A guideline. Venous
(EDTA) whole blood samples were drawn and spiked to target analyte levels.
Eight (8) target levels were prepared with glucose stock solutions to glucose
concentrations ranging from <20 mg/dL to >600 mg/dL (18, 40, 107, 119,
184, 276, 476, 615 mg/dL). A total of 480 strips from 3 strip lots were used
for this study. Each sample was tested on 160 strips per lot (3 lots of test
strips) using two meters. All samples were also tested on a YSI analyzer to
generate the expected values. The observed values were plotted against an
average of the expected values and an appropriate line fitted by standard linear
regression was generated with results summarized below:
Strip Lot Slope Intercept R2
1 1.01 2.51 0.997
2 0.99 3.23 0.995
3 1.01 0.36 0.997
Combined 1.01 2.03 0.996
The sponsor’s claimed measurement range for glucose is 20 -600 mg/dL.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The GL GoodLife and GL GoodLife Professional Glucose Monitoring
Systems are traceable to the NIST SRM 917a reference material.
Control solutions previously cleared: See k032985 for traceability, stability,
and expected value information.
Test Strip Stability:
Shelf Life: GL GoodLife AC blood glucose test strips were stored at
(4ºC±2ºC and 45% ±5%RH), (30ºC ±2ºC and 65% ±5%RH), and (42ºC ±2ºC
and 75% ±5%RH). For this study, one lot (28 vials, 25 strips per vial) of test
strips were used and were divided into 3 groups stored at temp/humidity
combinations specified above for real time shelf life stability testing. Glucose
values obtained using the GL GoodLife meter were compared to glucose
values obtained using YSI reference method at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12,18, and 24
months. The sponsor claims shelf life of 24 months when stored at 50-104 ºF
(10-40 ºC). Testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found
to be acceptable.
Open Vial test strip stability: 156 vials (25 strips per vial) of GL GoodLife
AC blood glucose test strips from one (1) lot were divided into 3 groups and
stored at (4ºC±2ºC and 45% ±5%RH), (30ºC ±2ºC and 65% ±5%RH), and
(42ºC ±2ºC and 75% ±5%RH). Eight (8) different blood glucose
concentrations were tested 10 times using one meter. Glucose values obtained
using the GL GoodLife meter were compared to glucose values obtained
using YSI reference method at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 13 weeks. The sponsor
claims open vial stability of 90 days after first opening when stored at 50-104
ºF (10-40 ºC). Testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and
found to be acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
See linearity study above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference study was designed according to CLSI EP7-A2 guideline.
Common endogenous and exogenous substances were evaluated for
interference by first spiking venous whole blood (collected in tubes containing
EDTA) to two levels of glucose concentrations (60-70 mg/dL and 250-350
mg/dL and then dividing each level to a control and test aliquot. The
endogenous and exogenous substances to be evaluated were then added to the
13

--- Page 14 ---
test aliquot. Each interfering substance was evaluated at 4 concentrations on 3
lots of test strips. Bias was calculated as the difference between the test and
control concentration groups. The following tables show the test
concentrations for each potential interfering substance:

System accuracy study:
This study was designed following ISO 15197:2003(E) using 100 fresh
capillary blood samples collected from participants from a diabetic clinic and
measured using two AC-300 meters. Fingerstick samples were collected by
two trained technicians over a 10 day period. Venous blood was also
collected and measured on the YSI analyzer. Pooled and altered samples were
used for glucose values less than 50mg/dL and greater than 400 mg/dL; each
sample allowed to glycolyze or spiked with a stock glucose solution to the
desired glucose level. Results obtained using the AC-300 meters were
compared to results obtained using the YSI 2300 (reference method). The
range of samples tested was 31 – 453 mg/dL. System accuracy results are
summarized below:

18

--- Page 19 ---
directly to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the
fingertip only. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by
capillary action.
5. Calibration:
There is no calibration required for the GL GoodLife meter by the user. The
meter is plasma-calibrated.
6. Quality Control:
GL Glucose control solutions at two different concentrations (Levels 1 and 2) can
be run with this device. The meter has an algorithm to automatically recognize the
control solutions to prevent control results from being stored in the internal
memory as patient result. Recommendations on when to test the control materials
are provided in the labeling. The control solution readings are not included in the
average of the patient results. An acceptable range for each control level is printed
on the control solutions vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the
control result falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Altitude Study:
This study was conducted at three sites to evaluate the effect of altitude on the
GL GoodLife BGMS. One lot of test strips was tested on 4 meters. Eight
different venous whole blood (EDTA) glucose concentrations were evaluated on
each meter in replicates of five at each site and at altitudes of 0.33 feet, 5,741
feet, and 8,800 feet. The samples tested spanned the device measuring range.
These blood samples were evaluated using both the GL GoodLife blood glucose
meter and an YSI glucose analyzer. Each test strip glucose value was compared
to the YSI method and then analyzed as a percent bias. The glucose values
obtained using the GL GoodLife glucose meter had acceptable biases compared
to YSI to support use at altitudes up to 8,800 feet. The results demonstrate
acceptable bias to YSI to support the claims in the labeling that altitudes up to
8,800 feet have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements from the
GL GoodLife and GL GoodLife Professional Blood Glucose Monitoring
Systems.

2. Hematocrit Study:
The sponsor performed hematocrit studies using seven different hematocrit (25,
30, 35, 40, 45, 55, 60%) levels distributed across the glucose measuring range
(20 – 600 mg/dL). Each glucose concentration/hematocrit level was tested in
replicates of six (6) using one (1) meter. The results support the sponsor’s
hematocrit claim of 30% - 55%.
3. Temperature and Relative Humidity Study:
In this study, two meters were evaluated at 10 combined temperature and
relative humidity conditions (8ºC, 10ºC, 25ºC, 40ºC, 42ºC with 15% RH and
(8ºC, 10ºC, 25ºC, 40ºC, 42ºC with 85%RH). Each sample was compared to the
YSI reference method. The meters and test strips were at each
temperature/humidity combination for at least 30 minutes prior to glucose
concentration testing. Eight venous whole blood samples were adjusted to the
following glucose concentration levels: (<20 mg/dL, 20-50 mg/dL, 51-110
mg/dL, 111-150 mg/dL, 151-250 mg/dL, 251-400 mg/dL, 401-600 mg/dL, and
>600 mg/dL) and were evaluated on each meter in replicates of five (2 meters x
5 replicates). The results demonstrate that accurate readings can obtained after
exposure to temperatures ranging from 50 ~ 104ºF (10 ~ 40ºC) and relative
humidity conditions at 15 and 85%.
4. EMC Electromagnetic Compatibility and Electrical Safety verification testing of
the GL GoodLife Blood Glucose Monitoring System was performed following
the requirements of ISO 15197:2003 (E). A signed technical compliance
statement was provided demonstrating that EMC testing was performed
following standards listed in the test report.
5. Sample volume study:
HMD Biomedical performed a sample volume study to demonstrate that 0.5µL
of whole blood is sufficient volume for the GL GoodLife AC-300 Blood
Glucose Monitoring System. For this study, whole blood sample volumes
ranging from 0.3µL – 0.7 µL were evaluated using three different lots of test
strips. The blood glucose sample results collected using the GL GoodLife Meter
were compared with glucose values obtained with the YSI reference method and
supported the minimum sample volume claim of 0.5µL.
6. Infection control:
The device (GL GoodLife and GL GoodLife Professional Blood Glucose
Monitoring systems) is intended for single (AC-300 - 305) or multiple patient
use (AC-300M - 305M). Clorox Commercial Solutions® Clorox Germicidal
Wipes (EPA Reg No.67619-12) were validated by virucide efficacy testing
using Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) using materials from the meter.
Robustness studies were also performed demonstrating that there was no change
in device performance or in the external materials of the meters after 520
20
