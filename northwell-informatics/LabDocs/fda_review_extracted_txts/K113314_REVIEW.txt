The claimed measuring range for this device is 20- 600 mg/dL
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The Precichek NS-101 POCT BGMS is traceable to the NIST SRM
917 reference material.
Stability: Real time stability studies were conducted to assess the shelf-life and open
vial stability of the control solutions and test strips. Real time stability studies are still
on-going. For controls, the sponsor claims an unopened shelf life of 18 months and
stability of 90 days after opening, when stored at 50-80 ˚F (10-30 ˚C). For test strips,
the sponsor claims that the unopened test strips have a 24 month shelf life and are
stable for 90 days after first opening, when stored at 10-40˚C (50-104˚ F). The
sponsor’s protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and considered acceptable.
Control Value Assignment: Previously cleared under k032985. The value
assignment of the Precichek glucose control solutions were determined by in-house
procedure. The control solutions were prepared by gravimetric addition of glucose to
achieve target values of 45 mg/dL for Level I and 300 mg/dL for Level II. Values

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor performed accuracy studies to demonstrate the performance of the
Precichek NS-101 POC meter compared to the YSI 2300 reference method. The
system accuracy evaluation was performed with 105 fresh capillary blood samples (5
spiked and 5 altered), with glucose concentrations distributed over the range of 20-
600 mg/dL. Samples were analyzed using 3 Precichek NS-101 POCT meters and 3
lots of test strips. To obtain the blood glucose concentrations <50 mg/dL and >500
mg/dL, samples were allowed to glycolize or were spiked to achieve desired
concentrations. The results relative to YSI are summarized in the tables below.

b. Matrix comparison:
The sponsor performed matrix comparison studies to demonstrate the performance of
the Precichek NS-101 POC meter compared to the YSI 2300 reference method. The
evaluation was performed 112 EDTA venous blood samples(5 spiked and 5 altered)
and 100 EDTA arterial samples (5 spiked, 5 altered) with glucose concentrations
distributed over the range of 20-600 mg/dL. Samples were analyzed using 3
Precichek NS-101 POCT meters and 3 lots of test strips. To obtain the blood glucose
concentrations <50 mg/dL and >500 mg/dL, samples were allowed to glycolize or
were spiked to achieve desired concentrations. The results relative to YSI are
summarized in the tables below.

this line of product types:
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
The applicant has provided documentation that indicates the device was designed and
developed under good software life-cycle processes.
3. Specimen Identification:
The device has a scanner lens. When you press and hold the “Scan” button, the red LED
light will be turned on to penetrate the scanner lens and read the bar coded labeled
sample.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood samples drawn from the
fingertip, venous and arterial whole blood EDTA samples. No special handling or storage
is needed.
5. Calibration:
The device is calibrated by a coding process. The code number is the last two digits of the
strip lot number. The user should input the last two digits of the strip lot number into the
memory before use. While performing the blood glucose test, the strip lot number printed
on the vial label is scanned to match the one in the memory. The meter then applies a
formula to calculate the glucose value.
6. Quality Control:
Two levels of glucose control solutions (Level 1, 2) are provided within the kit from the
12

--- Page 13 ---
sponsor. The labeling provides instructions on when to test control materials. An
acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. If the control
values fall outside these ranges, the user is referred to customer support for problems and
more information.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Altitude Studies: Venous whole blood samples, with glucose concentrations, according to
YSI, from 30-594 mg/dL were analyzed using 3 Precichek NS-101 POCT test strip lots
and 10 Precichek NS-101 POCT meters. Results were compared to YSI values and
resulted in no significant bias (≤ 10%) for all samples tested. The data submitted support
use of the device up to 8800 feet (2,750 meters).
2. Temperature and Humidity Studies: The sponsor performed temperature and humidity
studies using venous whole blood samples at 6 glucose ranges (30-50, 51-110, 151-250,
251-400 and 401-600 mg/dL), 5 Precichek NS-101 POCT meters and 2 lots of Precichek
NS-101 test strip lots. Results demonstrated that the system can be used in conditions of
50˚ - 104˚F (10˚- 40˚C) with relative humidity 20-80% and stored under conditions of 50˚
- 104˚F (10˚- 40˚C) and relative humidity of 20-80%. No significant effect (≤ 10%
relative to YSI) was observed at the temperature and humidity combinations tested. The
following combinations were tested: low temperature/low humidity, low
temperature/high humidity, high temperature/low humidity and high temperature/high
humidity. The results support the claims in the labeling that the system can be used in
conditions of 50˚ - 104˚F (10˚-40˚C) with relative humidity of 20-80%.
3. Sample Volume Studies: Sample volume studies were performed using venous whole
blood samples with concentrations of 49.3, 97, 123, 210, 336, and 488 mg/dL at 10
sample volumes (0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0. Ten Precichek POCT
meters and 2 lots of test strips were used in the study and results were compared to YSI.
Results support the claimed minimum sample volume of 0.5µL.
4. Infection Control Studies: The device is intended for multi-patient use. Disinfection
efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meter by outside
commercial testing demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with
the chosen disinfectant (Clorox Germicidal Wipes) (EPA Registration #67619-12).
Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no
change in performance or external materials for the meter after 18,250 cleanings and
18,250 disinfection cycles with the Clorox Germicidal Wipes. The robustness studies
were designed to simulate 5 years of multi-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for
adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
5. Readability Study: Not applicable. This device is for “Professional Use” only.
6. Hematocrit Study: The effect of hematocrit was evaluated using whole blood samples
spiked with seven hematocrit levels (25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 55, 65%) at glucose
13

--- Page 14 ---
concentrations distributed within the measuring range (20-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-250,
251-400, and 401-600 mg/dL) of the device. Each concentration was tested in replicates
of 6. The study incorporated 6 glucose meters. Blood analysis was also performed on the
YSI 2300 glucose analyzer. Results of samples with hct levels between 30-55% showed
bias versus the reference method of ≤ ± 15%)
7. EMC Testing: The sponsor provided the appropriate documentation certifying that
electromagnetic testing (EMC) had been performed and the Precichek NS-101 POCT
Professional Blood Glucose Monitoring System was found compliant.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
