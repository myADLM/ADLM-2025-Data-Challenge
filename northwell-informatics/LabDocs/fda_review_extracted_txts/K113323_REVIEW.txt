H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The artus® Infl A/B RG RT-PCR Kit is a multiplex real time PCR in vitro diagnostic
test for the qualitative detection and identification of Influenza A and Influenza B
virus RNA in nasopharyngeal swab specimens using the Rotor-Gene® Q MDx
instrument. The test is intended for use as an aid in the differential diagnosis of
Influenza A and Influenza B viral infections in patients symptomatic for respiratory
tract infection in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors. It is not
intended to detect Influenza C virus.
Negative results do not preclude respiratory virus infection and should not be used as
the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other patient management decisions.
Performance characteristics for Influenza A were established during the 2009/2010
and 2010/2011 flu seasons when Influenza A (H3N2) and Influenza A/2009 (H1N1)
were the predominant Influenza A viruses in circulation. When other Influenza A
viruses emerge, performance characteristics may vary.
If infection with a novel Influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities,
specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for
novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health departments for
testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility
is available to receive and culture specimens.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Not Applicable
4. Special instrument requirements:
Qiagen Rotor-Gene® Q MDx instrument with 72-well rotor
Qiagen EZ1 Advanced
I. Device Description:
The artus Infl A/B RG RT-PCR Kit contains reagents and instructions for the
detection and differentiation of Influenza A and Influenza B viral RNA in
nasopharyngeal swabs of symptomatic patients.

--- Page 3 ---
The assay utilizes the EZ1 DSP Virus Kit (QIAGEN) and the EZ1 Advanced XL
instrument with the EZ1 Advanced XL DSP Virus Card v. 1.0 for viral nucleic acid
extraction. The artus Infl A/B RG RT-PCR Kit in conjunction with the Rotor-Gene Q
MDx instrument (with 72-well rotor) and the Influenza Assay Package v. 1.0.7
(QIAGEN) is used for amplification and detection.
Pathogen detection by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
is based on the reverse transcription of the RNA into complementary DNA. In real-
time PCR the amplified product is detected via fluorescent dyes. These are linked to
oligonucleotides that bind specifically to the amplified product. Monitoring the
fluorescence intensities during the PCR run (i.e., in real time) allows the detection of
the accumulating product without having to re-open the reaction tubes after the PCR
run.
The artus Infl A/B RG RT-PCR procedure is briefly described below:
1. Sample collection: Collect nasopharyngeal swab specimens from symptomatic
patients using a polyester, nylon, or rayon swab and place it into virus transport
medium.
2. Nucleic acid extraction: Add the Influenza A/B internal control (IC) to the carrier
RNA before starting the extraction procedure. Extract viral RNA using the EZ1 DSP
Virus Kit in combination with the EZ1 Advanced XL instrument. The IC is added by
the EZ1 Advanced to each sample during extraction.
3. Real-time RT-PCR: Add the extracted RNA and positive and negative control
material to Influenza A/B Master mix. Perform real time RT-PCR using the Rotor-
Gene Q MDx instrument.
4. Result interpretation: The Influenza Assay Package evaluates the results of the
positive and negative controls to determine if the run is valid. If the run is valid, the
internal control and target-specific results of each specimen are evaluated.
Interpretation of Control Results
The Rotor-Gene Q software determines whether control results are valid or invalid and
therefore whether the run is valid or invalid.
Conditions required for a valid run
Name Influenza A result Influenza B result Status
Inf A Co Valid – Valid
Inf B Co – Valid Valid
NTC – – Valid
3

[Table 1 on page 3]
	Inf B Co			–			Valid			Valid	

--- Page 4 ---
Invalid runs
If the Influenza A Control (Inf A Co), Influenza B Control (Inf B Co), or no template
control (NTC) result is determined to be invalid, the software will provide a flag/warning
message. If the run is invalid due to failure of the Influenza A Control, Influenza B
Control, or no template control, all samples in that run must be retested using remaining
purified nucleic acids.
Interpretation of Process Control Results
For each Process Control the Rotor-Gene Q software indicates the results for influenza A
and influenza B (RNA detected or RNA not detected).
If the expected results for one or more of the Process Controls are not met the run is
considered invalid and all the samples in that PCR run must be extracted again and
retested.
Interpretation of Specimen Results
For each sample in a valid run, the Rotor-Gene Q software indicates the status of the
analysis (valid or invalid) and the results for influenza A and influenza B (RNA detected
or RNA not detected). A description of the sample results provided by the Rotor-Gene Q
software is provided in the table below.

L. Test Principle:
The real-time PCR process simultaneously amplifies and detects nucleic acid targets
in a single closed-tube reaction. Detection of Influenza RNA and Internal Control
(IC) is based on three processes: nucleic acid isolation, reverse transcription, and real
time PCR amplification/detection. Human respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal
swabs) from symptomatic patients are processed initially to isolate and purify viral
nucleic acid from the cellular specimen matrix. After initial reverse transcription of
RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA), amplification proceeds during which the
probe anneals specifically to a region of the template between the forward and reverse
primers. As primer extension and amplification occurs, the exonuclease activity of the
Taq polymerase cleaves the probe separating the reporter dye away from the
quencher. This generates an increase in fluorescent signal upon excitation from a light
source of appropriate wavelength. With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules
are cleaved from their respective probes, yielding increased fluorescence signal. The
amount of fluorescence at any given cycle is dependent on the amount of PCR
product (amplicons) present at that time. Fluorescent intensity is monitored at each
PCR cycle by fluorescent detection modules within the real-time instrument.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the artus Infl A/B RG RT-PCR test was evaluated using
3 investigational sites. A panel of 10 simulated specimens was provided for
testing. Five of the specimens contained influenza A and the other 5
specimens contained influenza B. Each half of the panel included duplicate
low-positive and moderate positive test samples. The test panel samples were
prepared from whole virus. Influenza A test samples were made using
Influenza A/California/7/09-like virus and the Influenza B test samples were
made using Influenza B/Florida/4/2006-like virus. The virus stocks were
diluted in influenza-negative clinical sample matrix that was comprised of
pooled, residual, de-identified nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Low positive
specimens where diluted to 2X the LoD, Moderate positives were made to
10X the LoD. Influenza A and Influenza B negative samples represent
dilution levels that are 0.001x LoD.
The 10-member panel plus 3 controls were tested by 2 different technologists
each day for 6 days. The overall percent agreement for the artus Infl A/B RG
RT-PCR test is summarized below.

For the negative control (No Template) and the positive controls (Influenza A
Control and Influenza B Control): The IC is added to the Influenza A/B
Master mix aliquot that is prepared specifically for use with Controls.
(Separate Influenza A/B Master mixes are prepared for Controls and
specimens; the Master mix for samples does not contain IC because it is added
to each sample prior to RNA extraction.)
In the No Template Control, a result for the IC that is outside of the
acceptance ranges identifies a failure of the PCR while a result within the
acceptance range indicates that the IC primers and probes are performing as
expected. In influenza-negative samples, the Influenza A/B Internal Control
identifies failure of the RNA extraction process or inhibition of the PCR
reaction.
Positive Controls
Two positive controls, the Influenza A Control and the Influenza B Control,
are provided with the artus Infl A/B RG RT-PCR Kit. The positive controls
are added in place of extracted sample RNA to individual PCR reaction tubes
containing Influenza A/B Master mix and Internal Control. The positive
controls identify failures of the PCR caused by reagent problems, PCR set-up
error, or failure of the Rotor-Gene Q MDx instrument. A result within the
acceptance range for both controls indicates the assay is functioning as
intended. Both controls must generate a valid result in order for the run to be
reported as valid by the artus Influenza software. (The Internal Control
Channel is not evaluated for the Positive Controls.)
The Influenza A Control is an in vitro transcript (IVT) corresponding to the
amplicon generated with the Influenza A primers. The IVT is present at a
concentration three times the limit of detection of the artus Infl A/B RG RT-
PCR Kit.
The Influenza B Control is an IVT corresponding to the amplicon generated
with the Influenza B primers. The IVT is present at a concentration five times
the limit of detection of the artus Infl A/B RG RT-PCR Kit.
Negative (No Template) Control
PCR grade water is provided with the artus Infl A/B RG RT-PCR Kit and
serves as the No Template control for the Influenza A/B Master. It is added in
place of extracted sample RNA to an individual reaction tube containing the
Influenza A/B Master mix with Internal Control. The No Template control
result identifies possible sample-to-sample carryover or contamination of the
master mix with target nucleic acid.
Controls not provided with the artus Infl A/B RG RT-PCR Kit:

Process Controls
The package insert for the artus Infl A/B RG RT-PCR Kit recommends to
include influenza A positive, influenza B positive, and influenza negative
Process Controls to be used starting from the extraction step. Since these
controls are intended to mimic patient samples, characterized clinical samples
can be used for this purpose.
Sample Stability
The stability of nasopharyngeal swab specimens, pre and post nucleic acid
purification, was evaluated by testing simulated clinical samples stored at
conditions reflecting the storage and handling instructions in the package
insert of the artus Infl A/B RG RT-PCR Kit. The stability of nasopharyngeal
swab specimens stored at -65 to -90oC (-70oC) was also demonstrated in the
clinical study using prospectively collected specimens.
Simulated clinical samples were prepared by spiking cultured influenza virus
strains A/California/7/09-like or B/Florida/4/2006-like into clinical sample
matrix. Each virus strain was present at a concentration of three times the
Limit of Detection (LoD) of the artus Infl A/B RG RT-PCR assay.
The study evaluated routine storage conditions for pre-processed samples and
purified nucleic acid samples. Additionally, the impact of leaving the purified
nucleic acid on the EZ1 Advanced XL for up to three hours was evaluated.
Although this is outside of routine storage conditions (short term at 2 – 8°C or
long term storage at -65 to -90°C). Prolonged storage of purified samples on
the EZ1 was also evaluated as it is reasonable to anticipate that a user will
occasionally not immediately retrieve the purified nucleic acids at the
conclusion of the EZ1 Advanced XL run.
For evaluation of pre-processed samples, 3 ml of each simulated sample was
placed in an empty Copan vial along with a nasopharyngeal swab and stored
at the designated temperature condition. Purified nucleic acid eluates (60μl)
were stored in the elution vials provided with the EZ1 DSP Virus Kit. A
freeze / thaw cycle is defined as the number of thaws minus one.
o
Storage of samples at 2 – 8 C for up to eight days.
For analysis of short term refrigerated storage of pre-processed samples,
simulated samples were stored at -65°C to -90°C for four weeks and then
stored for eight days at 2 - 8°C. During storage at 2 – 8°C, samples were
tested after three days, five days and eight days. (The experimental design was
chosen to conserve the negative clinical sample matrix by allowing evaluation
of frozen and 4°C storage with the same samples. The preceding storage at -
65°C to -90°C for four weeks and the resulting freeze thaw provides added
assurance of sample stability at 2 – 8°C for up to eight days by exposing the
13

samples to additional storage conditions.)
o
Storage of samples for up to six weeks at -65°C to -90 C with one freeze /
thaw at week four.
For analysis of -70°C storage and freeze-thaw stability, 3 ml of each simulated
sample was prepared and one aliquot of 0.4 ml was tested at Test Time Pont 0.
The remaining 2.6 ml was stored at -65°C to -90°C. After four weeks the
sample was thawed (5 h at 2-8°C) and split into aliquots of 0.4 ml. One
aliquot was processed and tested, the other aliquot was returned to the freezer.
After two additional weeks the remaining aliquot was thawed, processed and
tested. For each sample type, the observed result agreed with the expected
result for all replicates at each time point. For the simulated negative sample,
the IC of each replicate was within the acceptance range of Ct 26 – 36 at each
time point.
o
Storage of purified RNA at 2 – 8 C
For analysis of short term stability, eluates of simulated samples were initially
tested immediately after processing. The residual eluate was placed at 2-8°C
and tested again after six hours and eight hours of storage. All measurements
agreed with the expected results, demonstrating the stability of purified RNA
stored at 2 – 8°C for up to eight hours.
o
Storage of purified RNA at -70 C
For analysis of long term and freeze/thaw stability of purified RNA, eluates of
simulated samples were initially tested directly after processing. The residual
eluate was then stored at -65°C to -90°C. After two weeks the eluate was
thawed at 2 – 8°C for one hour and returned to storage at -65 to -90°C
(without testing). At four weeks, the eluate was thawed again for five hours at
2-8°C and tested. The remaining eluate was returned to the freezer. At six
weeks the eluate was thawed for the third time and tested. All measurements
agreed with the expected results demonstrating the stability of purified RNA
for two freeze-thaw cycles and six weeks storage at -65° to -90°C.
Storage of purified RNA on the EZ1 Advanced XL for up to three hours.
For analysis of short term stability of purified RNA on the EZ1 Advanced XL
instrument, eluates of Simulated Samples were left on the instrument for three
hours after the EZ1 Advanced XL run was finished. Testing was performed
immediately after the EZ1 Advanced XL run was complete. The eluates were
returned to the instrument platform and tested again at two hours and three
hours. All measurements agreed with the expected results, demonstrating the
stability of purified RNA that remains on the EZ1 Advanced XL instrument
for up to three hours.
Stability of nasopharyngeal swab specimens and of purified RNA from those
14

--- Page 15 ---
specimens was demonstrated by testing simulated samples stored under
defined conditions. Samples were prepared by diluting Influenza A strain
A/California/7/09-like virus or Influenza B strain B/Florida/4/2006-like virus
in clinical sample matrix to a concentration of three times the LoD. Samples
were processed for nucleic acid purification using EZ1 DSP Virus Kit with the
EZ1 Advanced XL instrument. Testing was performed with the artus Infl A/B
RG RT-PCR Kit on the RGQ instrument. The observed results agreed with the
expected result for each sample and each time point.
Stability of simulated nasopharyngeal swab specimens and purified RNA was
demonstrated for each of the sample types and storage conditions shown in the
table below:
Sample Tested Storage Condition
Simulated NP Swab Sample 8 days at 2-8 °C
6 weeks at -65 to -90°C (2 freeze thaws)
Purified RNA 8h at 2-8 °C
6 weeks at -65 to -90 (3 freeze thaws)
3h onboard EZ1 Advanced XL Instrument
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) of the artus Infl A/B RG RT-PCR Kit was
determined and confirmed for six influenza A strains (two strains representing
each of the influenza A subtypes of H1N1, H3N2, and 2009 H1N1) and two
influenza B strains. Samples were prepared from re-cultured and re-titered
virus diluted in nasopharyngeal clinical matrix. The LoD of each strain was
initially determined by limited dilution testing of three replicates per dilution
level. The result was confirmed by testing an additional 20 replicates at the
LoD concentration. The LoD, defined as the level of virus that yields at least a
95% (19/20) detection rate with the artus Infl A/B RG RT-PCR Kit, ranged
from 10e1.1 to 10e-0.1 TCID /ml. The strains included in the analysis and
50
the confirmed LoD are summarized in the table below.

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity:
The analytical specificity of the artus Infl A/B RG RT-PCR Kit was evaluated
by testing a panel of respiratory pathogens consisting of 31 virus strains
(including seven influenza A and three influenza B strains) and 18 bacterial
strains. The pathogens were tested at medically relevant levels. Human
genomic DNA and RNA were also evaluated. Test samples were prepared by
diluting the pathogen culture stock in Universal Transport Medium (UTM).
Initial test concentrations of the potentially cross-reactive pathogens ranged
from 10e3.2 to 10e6.1 TCID50/ml for viruses and from 10e2 to 10e6 cfu/ml
for bacteria. Purified human genomic DNA (hDNA) and human genomic
RNA (hRNA) were purchased and prepared at 0.1 ng/μl and 2 pg/μl,
respectively. A volume of 10μl was added directly to the master mix.
The artus Infl A/B RG RT-PCR Kit did not cross-react with 10 influenza
strains, 21 other respiratory viral pathogens, or 16 of 18 bacterial pathogens
present at medically relevant levels. Two of the 18 bacterial pathogens,
Bordetella pertussis and Streptococcus pneumoniae, generated invalid results
at concentrations of 10e3 cfu/ml and 2 x 10e5 cfu/ml, respectively. The
invalid results were generated by either absence of Ct values for the IC or Ct
values for the IC that fell out of the acceptable range. Re-extraction and
analysis of samples spiked with Streptococcus pneumoniae also generated
invalid results, suggesting the presence of a potential inhibitor. Upon dilution
of the eluates valid results were obtained. A spiked specimen was made with
a concentration 1 log lower than the initial preparation. Similarly, a new
spiked specimen containing Bordetella pertussis was also made to a final
concentration of 1 log lower than the original sample, yielding valid results.
There were no instances of cross-reactivity causing a false positive result for
Influenza A or Influenza B. A limitation has been added to the package insert
to indicate that the presence of Bordetella pertussis or Streptococcus
pneumoniae can yield invalid results.

Inclusivity:
The analytical reactivity of the artus Infl A/B RG RT-PCR Kit was
demonstrated by testing 18 strains of influenza A, including four strains
originally identified in non-human species, and six strains of influenza B at
concentrations near the limit of detection (LoD) of the test. Samples were
prepared from whole virus diluted in clinical sample matrix and were selected
to represent temporal and geographic diversity. The initial test concentration
of each virus strain was the highest LoD concentration previously determined
for the respective type or subtype. Viral stocks were obtained from ATCC or
Novartis. For each strain, three aliquots at the initial test concentration were
processed for nucleic acid extraction and purification using the EZ1 Advanced
XL. The resulting three eluates for each strain were tested with the artus Infl
A/B RG RT-PCR Kit on the RGQ. Reactivity was considered to be
successfully demonstrated if three of three eluates generated a positive result
in the appropriate target-specific channel. For strains generating fewer than
three (of three) positive results, three aliquots of a higher concentration were
processed and tested. This process was repeated until a virus concentration
generating three of three positive results was obtained. Results from the
analysis are summarized below.

Interfering Substances
The potential for blood or medications that might be present in a
nasopharyngeal swab specimen to interfere with the detection of low levels of
influenza A or influenza B by the artus Infl A/B RG RT-PCR test was
evaluated. A total of 24 substances representing the active ingredient in over-
the-counter or prescription medications were tested against two influenza
strains: A/California/7/09-like virus or B/Florida/4/2006-like virus. For each
test sample, three aliquots were processed for RNA purification using the EZ1
DSP Virus Kit with the EZ1 Advanced XL instrument. The resulting three
eluates were tested with the artus Infl A/B RG RT-PCR Kit in separate runs
on one Rotor-Gene Q MDx (RGQ).
If one or more of the three replicates was negative for the influenza A or
influenza B reference strain, testing was repeated with a lower concentration
of the interfering substance until the reference strain was successfully detected
in three of three replicates. The active ingredients from 24 over-the-counter
or prescription medications and whole blood were evaluated for interference
with the artus Infl A/B RG RT-PCR test. Samples containing the influenza
strain A/California/7/09-like virus or B/Florida/4/2006-like virus at the LoD
concentration of 10e1 TCID50/ml and the potential interferent were processed

were successfully detected in all samples except for one aliquot containing the
reference influenza B strain and Mupirocin at 10 mg/ml. The reference
influenza B strain was successfully detected in three of three aliquots with
Mupirocin at 2 mg/ml. (Mupirocin is an antibiotic ointment used to treat skin
infections. The product tested contains Mupirocin at 20mg / g of ointment.)

† The human blood sample was stored frozen before testing.
# Saline solution: a commonly used term for a sterile solution of sodium chloride
(NaCl) of 0.90% w/v, about 300mOsm/L or 9.0g per liter. Therefore it can be
assumed that a concentration of 0.9g/L was tested.
¥ Guaifenesin serves the same function as mucin. The source material, Fagusan, is
an alternative to Mucinex.
* Sample 155173 is a repeat (including RNA purification and testing) of the
originally invalid result from sample 155063. The original result was invalid
because the IC Ct was outside of the acceptance range required for samples
negative for Inf A and Inf B.
** Sample 155152 was valid and negative for Inf B. A new sample was prepared
with a five fold lower concentration of Mupirocin. The new sample was re-
extracted in triplicate and tested as sample IDs 155177 – 155179. The influenza B
reference strain was successfully detected in three of three replicates with the
lower concentration of Mupirocin.

§ The FluMist vaccine was tested without Influenza A and Influenza B reference
strains. Testing was performed as part of the Cross-Reactivity analytical
verification study (DHF-114-VER-006). Positive results for influenza A and B
were expected with the artus Infl A/B RG RT-PCR Kit because the vaccine
contains RNA from Influenza A strains A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) and
A/Perth/16/2009(H3N2) and from Influenza B strain B/Brisbane/60/2008.
f. Carry over/Contamination
The potential for carryover or cross-contamination to occur during nucleic
acid purification, using the EZ1 Advanced XL instrument with the EZ1 DSP
Virus Kit, or during amplification / detection using the artus Infl A/B RG RT-
PCR Kit with the Rotor-Gene Q MDX was evaluated by processing and
testing samples with a high concentration of Influenza A in alternating
sequence with samples containing the same analyte at a concentration that
tested positive approximately 10% of the time (high negative). The artus Infl
A/B RG RT-PCR test (including extraction using the EZ1 DSP Virus Kit with
the EZ1 Advanced XL) showed no evidence of carryover or
cross-contamination when 5 runs of a panel of 6 members of mock samples
containing influenza A at a concentration just below the limit of detection of
the assay were extracted and tested in alternating order with a panel of 6
members of mock samples of the same strain present at a high concentration.
Analysis of the negative rate of the high negative samples is not affected by
the presence of high positive samples and supporting the conclusion that
carryover and cross-contamination do not occur during RNA purification with
the EZ1 DSP Virus Kit on the EZ1 Advanced XL instrument or during testing
with the artus Infl A/B RG RT-PCR Kit on the RotoGene Q MDx.
g. LoB Study:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) was established by testing sixty influenza-negative
nasopharyngeal swab specimens with the artus Infl A/B RG RT-PCR Kit. The
robustness of the Internal Control (IC) signal was evaluated by assessing the
IC signals in the same set of samples.
Sixty residual, de-identified nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected in
UTM were tested in the study. The specimens were negative for Influenza A
and Influenza B by culture. Each of the sixty specimens was processed for
RNA purification and tested once. Specimens that generate a Ct value in the
Infl A or Infl B channel of the RGQ within 45 cycles are determined to be
positive for Influenza A or Influenza B RNA, respectively. For the Limit of
Blank study, the number of PCR cycles was changed from the usual 45 cycles
to 50 cycles to ensure that influenza-negative specimens do not generate a Ct
close to (but later than) the assay cutoff of 45 cycles. The use of a pre-launch
version of the RGQ software allows the PCR cycling profile to be manually
applied. RNA purification was performed with one lot of EZ1 DSP Virus Kits
25

--- Page 26 ---
on three EZ1 Advanced XL instruments. Testing included three lots of the
artus Infl A/B RG RT-PCR Kit, three RGQ instruments and three operators.
Sixty influenza-negative (by culture) NPS specimens were processed for RNA
purification and tested with the artus Infl A/B RG RT PCR Kit. The Influenza
A/B Internal Control demonstrated robust performance in the artus Infl A/B
RG RT PCR test. None of the 60 specimens generated a Ct for Influenza A or
Influenza B through 50 PCR cycles, indicating that the LoB for the assay is
greater than 50 Ct. The Internal Control Ct of each of the 60 specimens was
within the acceptance range of 26 – 36 Ct. The average Ct for the Internal
Control was 31.17 with a CV of 1.6%. These results support the assay cutoff
of less than 45 Ct for discriminating positive from negative specimens.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not Applicable
b. Matrix comparison:
The impact of freezing on the performance characteristics of the artus Infl
A/B RG RT-PCR Assay was assessed using prospectively collected
nasopharyngeal swab specimens. All prospectively collected specimens were
originally characterized when the UTM was fresh (i.e., portions of UTM were
subjected to viral culture and nucleic acid extraction prior to freezing). An
aliquot from all prospectively collected nasopharyngeal swab specimens were
stored at -70°C or lower for at least 21 days before retesting with the artus Infl
A/B RG RT-PCR Assay. Nucleic acid was extracted from a 400 μL portion of
frozen UTM using the EZ1 Advanced XL/DSP Virus system for testing by the
artus Infl A/BRT-PCR Kit; the eluate was either tested immediately or stored
at −70°C or below for later testing. The aliquot used for this study was the
primary backup specimen for the prospective analysis in the event that a
specimen failed or was lost. A total of 244 specimens were evaluable when
comparing the investigational artus method to viral culture, or the artus Infl
A/B RG RT-PCR result from specimens tested prior to freezing. The overall
positive agreement of testing frozen UTM with the artus Infl A/B RG RT-
PCR test relative to fresh UTM was 100% for Influenza A and 98.2% for
Influenza B. The overall negative agreement for both Influenza A and
Influenza B was 100%. The results are summarized below in a 2x2
comparison of fresh vs. frozen NP swab specimens in UTM.

3. Clinical studies:
To assess performance of the artus Infl A/B RG RT-PCR Kit a multi-center study
was performed. Three independent clinical trial testing sites, separated
geographically within the United States, were used.
The study was conducted in three parts. The first part included testing fresh
prospectively collected nasopharyngeal swab specimens from individuals with a
respiratory tract infection wherein said infection was suspected of being caused
by a respiratory virus. Only one specimen was collected per subject; specimens
were subjected to viral culture, and nucleic acids were extracted from these
specimens within 36 hours of collection for investigational artus testing. The
second part of the trial involved testing (at two clinical sites, Site 1 and Site 2) of
prospectively collected and archived clinical samples over two influenza seasons
from the Site 2. The third part of the trial involved multisite testing of
retrospectively collected specimens acquired from the CDC Influenza Banking
Program. In total, the results of 928 specimens were evaluated in this clinical
evaluation. Each part of the study is discussed in detail below.

Part 1
A total of 272 subjects were enrolled in the fresh prospective clinical study during
the 2010/2011 flu season. In order to be eligible for the study, subjects must have
signed an informed consent and must have had symptoms of an acute respiratory
tract infection for less than five days. Considering these criteria, a total of 18
subjects were considered ineligible due to unconfirmed consent (i.e. improper
consenting etc.), or subjects were excluded due to (a) the duration of the subjects
symptoms exceeding five days, or (b) the subject’s symptoms were not properly
documented. Consequently, there were 254 subjects that met the study eligibility
criteria from three sites.

The overall sensitivity of the artus Infl A/B RG RT-PCR test relative to viral
culture was 100% for both Influenza A and Influenza B. The overall specificity
of the investigational artus test for Influenza A and Influenza B was 95.0% and
94.7%, respectively. There were a total of 23 discordant results in the fresh
prospective clinical evaluation. All discordant results were positive by the artus
Infl A/B test, but negative by standard viral culture. Twelve of these were
Influenza A positive, while 11 were Influenza B positive. The Ct-values of the 12
discordant Influenza A specimens are compared with the Ct-values of the 15
concordant positive specimens in as well as the Ct-values of the 11 discordant
Influenza B specimens are compared with the Ct-values of the 45 concordant
positive specimens were compared. The distribution of Ct-values between the
concordant positive specimens and the discordant specimens formed two distinct
populations for both Influenza A and Influenza B. The comparison is presented
below.

Bi-directional sequencing was performed on 24 of the 27 Influenza A positive
specimens, and all 56 Influenza B positive specimens. Three Influenza A positive
specimens from Site 2 were not tested with bi-directional sequencing and all three
were culture negative.
Of the remaining 24 Influenza A positive specimens, only two specimens could
not be confirmed as Influenza A; both specimens were culture negative. Both
specimens had high Ct-values relative to other discordant culture negative
specimens.
All 56 Influenza B positive specimens were submitted for bi-directional
sequencing; a total of 49 were confirmed as Influenza B.
Part 2
In the second part of the clinical evaluation prospectively collected and archived
clinical specimens from Site 2 were used. The specimens enrolled in the study
spanned two influenza seasons (between 8/24/2009-1/13/2010 and 1/14/2011-
5/10/2011) and represented an all-comers study. They were included in the study
based on the inclusion criteria of the study protocol. Samples from this study
were analyzed at two sites. A total of 198 specimens were shipped to Site 1 for
artus Infl A/B testing, while 265 were tested at Site 2 with the artus Infl A/B test.
The reference method used for this study was one of two FDA cleared high
performance molecular tests for influenza. The following tables represent the
results of performance evaluation through comparison to each FDA cleared
molecular device individually at each site, at all sites combined, and finally at all
sites combined
The demographics for the prospectively collected and archived study are as

Influenza viruses often change from one season to the next, or even within a
season, due to antigenic drift. Distribution of virus types and subtypes can also
vary by geographic region. According to reports from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), during the 2010–11 flu season in the United
States, the most commonly reported virus was influenza A (H3N2) although high

levels of 2009 influenza A (H1N1) and influenza B viruses circulated as well. Of
246,128 specimens tested for influenza viruses, 54,226 (22%) were positive. Of
the positive specimens, 40,282 (74%) were influenza A viruses, and 13,944 (26%)
were influenza B viruses. By comparison, in the southeast region of the United
States, 10,026 specimens were positive for influenza, of which 6,071 (61%) were
influenza A viruses and 3,955 (39%) were influenza B viruses.
In the prospective clinical study for the artus Infl A/B RG RT-PCR Kit,
nasopharyngeal swab specimens were prospectively collected from 254 patients
with symptoms of respiratory tract infection from February to April 2011 and
analyzed fresh. Of the 254 specimens, 60 (23.6%) were positive. Of the positive
specimens, 15 (25%) were positive for influenza A and 45 (75%) were positive
for influenza B. There was no Influenza A and B dual positive specimen detected
by the artus Infl A/B RG RT-PCR Kit or the reference method during the
prospective clinical study.
In addition, a total of 462 prospectively collected archived specimens from
patients with symptoms of respiratory tract infection from August 2009 to May
2011 were tested. Of the 462 specimens, 110 (23.8%) were positive. Of the
positive specimens, 96 (87.3%) were positive for influenza A and 14 (12.7%)
were positive for influenza B. There was no Influenza A and B dual positive
specimen detected by the artus Infl A/B RG RT-PCR Kit or the reference
methods during the clinical study.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
