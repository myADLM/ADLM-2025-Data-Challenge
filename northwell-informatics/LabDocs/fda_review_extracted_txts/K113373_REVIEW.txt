c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The assigned values for the commercial LOCI 9 calibrator Levels B-E are
assigned from the following master pool levels:
Analyte Reference Master pool Levels
assignment of
Master pools
Progesterone
0.97, 8.97, 17.2 and 43.8
Progesterone
ng/mL
GC-IDMS*
*Gas chromatographic isotope dilution mass spectrometry
The zero calibrator for the progesterone master pool is fatty acid free bovine
serum albumin calibrator base.
Stability:
Real Time/Closed Vial Stability: Target shelf-life for the Dimension Vista®
LOCI 9 calibrators is 12 months when frozen (-15°C to -25°C). Shelf life is
determined by comparing results of the calibrator levels stored at -15°C and -
25°C with control calibrators stored at -70°C on intervals ranging from 0 to
395 days. Five replicates per level are tested. Three production (test) and
control (reference) lots of calibrator were tested for stability.
Thawed 2-8°C Closed Vial Stability: 7 days at 2-8°C.
Punctured/Open Vial Stability: Punctured vials are stable for 7 days when
stored on board the Dimension Vista® System. Once the cap is removed, the
product is stable for 7 days when recapped and stored at 2-8°C.
Acceptance Criteria: The reference material (control calibrator) is stored at -
70°C. The method is calibrated from this stored material. The -15°C and -
25°C calibrator levels are recovered from the control calibration. Recoveries
vs. time are monitored and allowable drift (% change in control vs. test
calibrators) was ≤ 5% deviation from reference concentration for levels B-E.

Value Assignment:
The values of the LOCI 9 Calibrators are assigned by creating anchor pools
from individual serum patient samples covering the assay range for
progesterone that are assayed by GC-IDMS. The four level Master Pools are
prepared by spiking commercially purified progesterone in bovine serum
albumin (BSA) and assigning values on the Dimension Vista® 1500
Intelligent Lab System prior to storing at -70°C. A progesterone stock
solution is made by spiking commercially available progesterone material
gravimetrically into a BSA calibrator base at appropriate concentrations for
levels B-E. The concentration of the bulk commercial calibrator is verified by
measuring recovery on a Dimension Vista® instrument calibrated with
Progesterone Master Pools. The final bottle values for commercial lots are
assigned against the master pool curves using multiple instruments and
reagent lots, where values must be within acceptable ranges of the target for
levels B-E. The bottle value for each level is the mean of 45 replicates.
The attached table outlines the target range at each level as well as the
acceptable range and precision around the target.
