b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the Albumin, Total Protein, Calcium and Phosphorus tests on
the ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry System was evaluated in accordance with
CLSI EP6-A. Serum samples were spiked and dilutions of the spiked serum
were then prepared by mixing the spiked serum in known proportions with
saline (for albumin, total protein and phosphorus or diluted serum for calcium.
Twelve levels were prepared for each analyte and each level was run in
triplicate on one analyzer. The mean value of each set of triplicate
determinations was calculated and the % recovery was calculated for each
sample. The execution of first, second and third order linear regression did
not indicate statistically significant non linear regression coefficients in either
the 2nd order or 3rd order models. Linear regression analysis of the assigned
values (x axis) versus the measured values (y axis) was also evaluated. The
results of these studies are summarized below:
Albumin:
Linear regression analysis demonstrated that the assay is linear from 0.1 to 7.1
g/dL (y = 0.997x + 0.12; r2 = 0.9979). The sponsor claims the reportable
range for the assay is from 0.3 to 7.0 g/dL.
Total Protein:
Linear regression analysis demonstrated that the assay was linear from 0.37 to
15.4 g/dL (y = 1.015x + 0.01; r2 = 0.9984). The sponsor claims that the
reportable range for the assay is from 0.4 to 14 g/dL.
Calcium:
Linear regression analysis demonstrated that the assay was linear from 0.37 to
15.9 mg/dL (y = 1.019x - 0.11; r2 = 0.9994). The sponsor claims that the
reportable range of the assay is from 0.4 to 15 mg/dL.

Linear regression analysis demonstrated that the assay was linear from 0.3 to
20.0 mg/dL (y = 1.016x – 0.10; r2 = 0.9890). The sponsor claims that the
reportable range of the assay is from 0.3 to 20 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The GEMCAL calibrators recommended for use with these reagents were
cleared under k930104.
Alfa Wassermann Level 1 and level 2 Chemistry Controls recommended for
use with these reagents were cleared under k930104.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation
(LoQ) studies were performed in accordance to CLSI EP17-A. These
determinations were performed using 60 replicates of a true blank (BSA, 7.5%
solution in saline) for the LoB and 60 replicates of five low level sample
values for the LoD. The true blank results were ranked from lowest to
highest. The LoB was calculated as the mean of the 57th and 58th highest
values for the true blank. The standard deviation of the 60 results for the low
samples was calculated. The LoD was calculated using the following
equation:
LoD = LoB + (1.645 * SD low samples)
The LoQ was determined using 40 replicates of 5 low level specimens and
defined as the lowest concentration for which the CV is less than 20%.
The estimate for LoB is 0.07 g/dL (Albumin), 0.10 g/dL (Total Protein), 0.05
mg/dL (Calcium) and 0.04 mg/dL (Phosphorus)
The estimate for LoD is 0.09 g/dL (Albumin), 0.15 g/dL (Total Protein), 0.11
mg/dL (Calcium) and 0.07 mg/dL (Phosphorus).
The estimate for LoQ is 0.09 g/dL (Albumin), 0.31 g/dL (Total Protein), 0.20
mg/dL (Calcium) and 0.22 mg/dL (Phosphorus).
e. Analytical specificity:
The interference studies were performed in accordance to CLSI EP7-A2.
Various concentrations of the potential interfering compounds were added to
aliquots of normal and abnormal serum pools. The control samples consisted
of aliquots of the same serum pools diluted with an equivalent volume of
diluent containing no interfering compound. All samples were tested in
triplicate on the ACE Axcel Clinical Chemitry System. The following
interference studies were performed:

limitation that hemolyzed, icteric or lipemic samples should not be
used.

used.
· Each product insert refers to literature for a comprehensive list of
drugs and other substances that can affect the analyte concentrations in
serum.
