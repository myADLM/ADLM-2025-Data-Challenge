L. Test Principle:
The α-GliatestÒ IgA and α-GliatestÒ IgG tests are sandwich type enzyme
immunoassays. Purified α-gliadin is attached to microwells, and antigen-specific
antibodies in the patient serum bind to the antigens. Non-specific antibodies are
removed by washing. Horseradish peroxidase labeled goat anti-human IgA or IgG
are added and bind to human antibodies in the well. The excess conjugate is washed
away; then a chromogenic substrate is added. After an appropriate incubation period,
the OD value is measured using an ELISA microtiter plate reader capable of
measuring OD at 450 nm.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity studies were assessed according to CLSI EP6-A. Four positive
serum samples (2 samples ~ 100 AU/mL and 2 samples ~ 50 AU/mL) for
each of α-GliatestÒ IgA, α-GliatestÒ IgG. α-GliaPepÒ IgA and α-GliaPepÒ
IgG were used in the study. Each sample was diluted with a low
concentration serum sample (around limit of detection) and tested in
duplicate. The observed values were graphed against the calculated values
and linear regression was performed. The results are summarized in the table
below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: There is no recognized standard for this analyte.
Stability:
Kit stability: Stability studies were performed on three lots each of the α-
GliatestÒ IgA, α-GliatestÒ IgG, α-GliaPepÒ IgA, and α-GliaPepÒ IgG test
kits after stored at 2-8°C for 2, 6, 12, and 15 months. Five (5) calibrators
were tested in the study. Testing was done at t=0 (batch release), t=2, t=6,
t=12, and t=15 months. Based on these studies, the claimed shelf life for the
test kits is 12 months when stored at 2-8°C.
Open vial stability: A study was performed on three lots each of α-GliatestÒ
IgA, α-GliatestÒ IgG, α-GliaPepÒ IgA, and α-GliaPepÒ IgG test kits after
open and after being stored at 2 – 8°C. Five (5) calibrators (S1-S5) were also
tested in the study. Testing was done at t=0 and t=2 months. The results
showed that kits are stable up to 2 months after first open and stored at 2 –
8°C.
Sample stability: Sample stability was performed and results support the
claim that specimens can be stored at 2-8°C for five days.
Calibrators:
Calibrators are prepared in-house from dilutions of the pooled serum of anti-
gliadin antibody (AGA) from patients with celiac disease. The new calibrator

is formulated from an array of AGA antibody positive sera obtained from
various commercial plasma centers. As new lots of calibrators are developed,
studies are performed to calibrate values against the previously approved lot
of the calibrators. Each lot of calibrator is also tested in comparison with
normal human sera, clinical samples and internal standards. The
concentration values of the calibrators are as follows:

Cal S3 20 20 20 20
Cal S2 10 10 10 10
Cal S1 0 2 0 0
Controls:
One positive and one negative control serum sample are included in each of
the α-GliatestÒ IgA, α-GliatestÒ IgG, α-GliaPepÒ IgA, and α-GliaPepÒ IgG
assay kit. The positive and negative controls are prepared in-house and with
an assigned range of concentrations. The assigned ranges of concentrations
for the positive and negative controls are summarized in the following table:

IgA IgG IgA IgG
Positive Control 30 – 75 50 – 100 30 – 75 30 – 75
Negative Control <5 <10 <5 <5
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity (detection limit) of the α-GliatestÒ IgA/IgG and α-
GliaPepÒ IgA/IgG were evaluated in accordance with CLSI Standard EP17-
A. The limit of blank (LoB) was determined by running six serum diluent
samples (buffer solution provided with the kit) in ten replicates for a total of
60 measurements. The limit of detection (LoD) was determined and
calculated by running six low concentration samples in the range from LoB to
approximately 4 xLoB, according to CLSI EP17-A. The samples were tested
in ten replicates each, for a total of 60 measurements. The results for LoB and
LoD are summarized in the following table.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference by endogenous substances: Study was done to evaluate the
analytical specificity of α-GliatestÒ IgA, α-GliatestÒ IgG, α-GliaPepÒ IgA,
and α-GliaPepÒ IgG tests in the presence of endogenous interfering
substances. For each assay, five serum samples including one negative, two
around the cut-off and two strong positives were tested by spiking with the
interference substance: Hemoglobin, Bilirubin, Lipid, and Rheumatoid Factor
(RF). For each test sample, the samples without spiking with interference
substance were used as control. The recovery of test sample was calculated as
percent recovery compared to the control sample. No significant interference
was noted for samples containing interference substance at concentration
listed below:

f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off of each assay was established by testing serum samples from
healthy subjects and non-celiac controls (inflammatory Bowel Disease)
patients. For α-GliatestÒ IgA and IgG assays, 248 samples were tested with
α-GliatestÒ IgA while 258 samples were tested with GliatestÒ IgG. The cut-
off was determined as the mean plus 3 standard deviations of the detection
levels of samples. For α-GliaPepÒ IgA and α-GliaPepÒIgG assays, 169
samples were tested and the cut-off was determined as the mean plus 2
standard deviations of the detection levels for the tested samples.
The assay cut-off value for each assay was determined as follows:
Negative Positive
α-GliatestÒ IgA < 8 AU/mL ≥ 8 AU/mL
α-GliatestÒ IgG < 50 AU/mL ≥ 50 AU/mL
α-GliaPepÒ IgA < 8 AU/mL ≥ 8 AU/mL
α-GliaPepÒ IgG <10 AU/mL ≥ 10 AU/mL

GliatestÒ IgA/IgG and α-GliaPepÒ IgA/IgG and their corresponding
predicate AeskulisaÒ Glia A/G. The samples consist of clinical diagnosed
celiac positives (biopsy or clinically proven diagnosis), IgA deficient celiac
patient samples, and negative samples from patients with other defined
diseases, including non-celiac autoimmune disease, Inflammatory Bowel
Syndrome (IBS), Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), infectious disease, food
intolerance and Type 1 diabetes. The study results are summarized in the
tables below:

The clinical validation study for each of α-GliatestÒ IgA, α-GliatestÒ IgG, α-
GliaPepÒ IgA, and α-GliaPepÒ IgG was performed in four sites – three
external and one in-house. The study included samples from patients who had

systemic lupus erythematosus, 4 samples of systemic sclerosis, 16 samples of
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, 9 samples Graves’ disease, 12 samples of
autoimmune hepatitis, 2 samples of Sjögren's syndrome, 13 samples of
Crhon’s disease, 9 samples of ulcerative colitis, 17 samples of IBS, 11
samples of Type 1 Diabetes and 10 samples of infectious disease (H. pylori).

4. Clinical cut-off:
Same as assay cut-off
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The study was done to test 196 healthy population with each of α-GliatestÒ IgA
and α-GliatestÒ IgG. Out of these, 190 (96.94%) were negative with α-GliatestÒ
IgA assay and 186 (94.9%) were negative with α-GliatestÒ IgG assay,
respectively. For α-GliaPepÒ IgA and α-GliaPepÒ IgG, 145 healthy population
were tested. The results showed that 140 (96.55%) was negative with α-
GliaPepÒ IgA and 132 (91.03%) was negative with α-GliaPepÒ IgG.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
