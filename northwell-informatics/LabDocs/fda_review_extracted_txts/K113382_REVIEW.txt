different reagent bottles per kit. For example, the AST Reagent kit has both R1
(buffer) and R2 (substrate) bottles (three R1 and three R2 bottles) in each kit.
The ACE ALT Reagent consists of two reagent bottles (Substrate and Coenzyme).
The combined AST Reagent consist of L-Alanine, a-Ketoglutarate, Nicotinamide

L. Test Principle:
ACE ALT Reagent
Alanine aminotransferase in serum converts the L-alanine and α-ketoglutarate
substrates, contained in the reagent, to L-glutamate and pyruvate. The pyruvate
formed reacts with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) in the
presence of lactate dehydrogenase to form lactic acid and oxidized nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). The rate of conversion of the reduced cofactor to the
oxidized cofactor results in a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm.
ACE AST Reagent
Aspartate aminotransferase in serum converts the L-aspartate and α-ketoglutarate
substrates, contained in the reagent, to L-glutamate and oxalacetate. The oxalacetate
formed reacts with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) in the
presence of malate dehydrogenase to form malate and oxidized nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide (NAD+). The rate of conversion of the reduced cofactor to the oxidized
cofactor results in a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. This rate of conversion is a
proportional to the activity of AST in the sample.
ACE g-GT Reagent
γ-GT in serum catalyzes the transfer of the γ-glutamyl group from the L-γ-glutamyl-
3-carboxy-4-nitroanilide substrate to the glycylglycine product in the reagent. The
product, 5-amino-2-nitrobenzoate, absorbs strongly at 408 nm. The rate of increase in
absorbance is directly proportional to the γ-GT activity in the sample.

The claimed measuring range of ALT is 5 - 480 U/L, AST is 7 - 450 U/L, and
g-GT is 7 - 950 U/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Studies were carried out in accordance with CLSI Guidance Document EP7-
A2.
ACE ALT Reagent
Interference studies were performed by using serum pools containing
approximately 30 U/L and 350 U/L of ALT with individual interferents at a
range of concentrations. The sera were assayed for ALT (n = 3 replicates) and the
mean result calculated. Interference was considered to be significant by the
sponsor if the analyte recovery changed by > ± 10%. The results reported were
obtained on ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry System analyzer using fresh ACE
ALT Reagent.
Interferents Claim
No Significant Interference
Interferents
At or Bellow
Unconjugated Bilirubin 30 mg/dL
Hemolysis 1000 mg/dL
Lipemia (Intralipid) 502 mg/dL
Ascorbic Acid 6 mg/dL
ACE AST Reagent
Interference studies were performed by using serum pools containing
approximately 30 U/L and 230 U/L of AST with individual interferents at a
range of concentrations. The sera were assayed for AST (n = 3 replicates) and the
mean result calculated. Interference was considered to be significant by the
sponsor if the analyte recovery changed by > ± 10%. The results reported were
obtained on ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry System analyzer using fresh ACE
AST Reagent.

* Use clear, unhemolyzed serum. Because erythrocytes contain high levels
of AST activity, hemolyzed samples should not be used
ACE g-GT Reagent
Interference studies were performed by using serum pools containing
approximately 30 U/L and 400 U/L of g-GT with individual interferents at a
range of concentrations. The sera were assayed for g-GT (n = 3 replicates) and the
mean result calculated. Interference was considered to be significant by the
sponsor if the analyte recovery changed by > ± 10%. The results reported were
obtained on ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry System analyzer using fresh ACE g-
GT Reagent.
Interferents Claim

Unconjugated Bilirubin 18 mg/dl
Hemolysis 62.5 mg/dl*
Lipemia (Intralipid) 1310 mg/dl

Because hemolysis interferes with the GGT assay, the sponsor put the following
limitations in the labeling for GGT:
“* Specimens showing any indication of hemolysis should not be analyzed.”

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Studies are carried out according to CLSI EP9-A2-IR.
In house: ACE ALT Reagent
ACE ALT Reagent was used as the predicate method, using recommended
applications and procedures on the ACE Clinical Chemistry System. One hundred
two serum samples were assayed in parallel by both the test and predicate
methods and the results compared by Deming regression. The range tested was 5
to 472 U/L. Seven samples were altered.
The comparison by Deming regression resulted in a slope of 1.041 (95%CI =
1.035 to 1.047), an intercept of 0.3 (95%CI = -0.3 to 0.9), correlation coefficient
of R2 = 0.9996, and a std. error of 2.4.
