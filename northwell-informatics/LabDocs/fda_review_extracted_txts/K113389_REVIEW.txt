L. Test Principle:
The ACE BUN/Urea Reagent is a photometric assay in which urea in serum is hydrolyzed by
urease to yield ammonia and carbon dioxide, the ammonia formed subsequently reacts with
2-oxoglutarate and NADH in the presence of glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) to yield
glutamate and NAD. NADH absorbs strongly at 340 nm, whereas NAD+ does not. The
decrease in absorbance of NADH at 340 nm is proportional to the urea concentration in the
sample.

The ACE Creatinine Reagent is a photometric assay based on Jaffe reaction, in which serum
creatinine reacts with picric acid in an alkaline medium to form a red-orange colored
complex, which absorbs strongly at 505 nm. The rate of complex formation is determined by
the increase of absorbance at 505 nrn/573 nm during a fixed time interval; this rate is directly
proportional to the creatinine concentration in the sample.
The ACE Uric Acid Reagent is based on a photometric assay in which serum uric acid is
oxidized by uricase to allantoin and hydrogen peroxide, which subsequently reacts to coupled
chromogen dichlorohydroxybenzene sulfonic acid (DHBS) and 4-aminoantipyrine (AAP) in
a reaction catalyzed by peroxidase and produces a red colored quinoneimine complex; which
are measured by the increase in absorbance at 505 nm/610 nm.
The ACE CK Reagent is a coupled enzymatic reaction in which serum creatine kinase (CK)
first catalyzes the conversion of creatine phosphate and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to
creatine and ATP. Subsequently, hexokinase (HK) uses the ATP produced to phosphorylate
D-glucose to form D-glucose-6-phosphate and ADP. In the final reaction, the enzyme
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) uses D-glucose-6-phosphate to convert
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+) into NADPH, absorbs strongly at
340 nm. The rate of conversion of NADP+ to NADPH, which is a function of the activity of
CK in the sample, is determined by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 340 nm/378 nm.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
GEMCAL Reference Serum is traceable to NIST SRM 909 for BUN and uric acid
and IDMS traceable to the NIST SRM 967 for creatinine.
For ACE CK reagent, enzyme activity (in IU/L) is determined directly by multiplying
the absorbance change per minute of the unknown sample by a factor (10956) derived
from the molar absorptivity of NADPH.
On-Board stability:
On-board stability studies were performed for all reagents by the sponsor. The
stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and determined to be
adequate. All ACE reagents in this submission demonstrated the on-board stability as
stated in the table below when stored in the ACE Axcel reagent chamber (at 10-14°C)
with Evap-Caps.
ACE Axcel On-Board

BUN 30
Creatinine 10
Uric Acid 30

d. Detection limit:
Detection limit studies (LoB, LoD, and LoQ) were performed in accordance with
CLSI Guidance Document EP17-A. For LoB and LoD, testing was carried out using

blanks and low samples (total of 60 replicates each sample) over three days on two
ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry Systems. LoQ testing was performed using 5 low
samples (total of 40 replicates for each sample). A curve was fit to estimate the
relationship between the measured value and the %CV. LoQ is defined as the lowest
concentration for which the imprecision %CV is ≤ 20%.
The sponsor’s claimed detection limits for the four analytes are summarized below:
Limit of Blank Limit of Limit of
Reagent (LoB) Detection Quantification
(LoD) (LoQ)
BUN 0.9 mg/dL 1.1 mg/dL 1.9 mg/dL
Creatinine 0.14 mg/dL 0.19 mg/dL 0.23 mg/dL
Uric Acid 0.97 mg/dL 1.13 mg/dL 1.2 mg/dL
CK 3.2 U/L 3.5 U/L 10.6 U/L
The sponsor’s claimed measuring range for BUN is 2 to 100 mg/dL, for creatinine is
0.23 to 25.0 mg/dL, for uric acid is 1.2 to 16.0 mg/dL, and for CK is 11 to 1350 U/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
ACE BUN/ Urea Reagent
Interference studies were performed by using two serum pools containing 20 mg/dL
and 50 mg/dL BUN with individual interferents at a range of concentrations. The sera
were assayed for BUN (n = 3 replicates) and the mean result calculated. Interference
was considered to be significant by the sponsor if the analyte recovery changed by ±
10%. The results reported were obtained on the ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry
System analyzer.

Unconjugated Bilirubin 54 mg/dL
Hemolysis 1000 mg/dL
Lipemia (Intralipid) 1000 mg/dL

ACE Creatinine Reagent
Interference studies were performed by using two serum pools containing 1 mg/dL
and 9 mg/dL creatinine with individual interferents at a range of concentrations. The
sera were assayed for creatinine (n = 3 replicates) and the mean result calculated.

sera were assayed for uric acid (n = 3 replicates) and the mean result calculated.
Interference was considered to be significant by the sponsor if the analyte recovery

interference, “Hemolyzed samples cannot be used. Use clear, unhemolyzed sample.”
For ascorbic acid, the following limitation was noted in the labeling: “ Ascorbic acid
concentrations as low as 1.3 mg/dL have been shown to interfere with this assay.
Non-fasting patients taking a high dose of vitamin C may cause low uric acid levels
and results should be interpreted with caution.”
ACE CK Reagent
Interference studies were performed by using two serum pools containing 100 U/L
and 600 U/L creatine kinase with individual interferents at a range of concentrations.
The sera were assayed for creatine kinase (n = 3 replicates) and the mean result
