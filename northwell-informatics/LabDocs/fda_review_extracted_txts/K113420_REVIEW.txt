L. Test Principle:
A breast tissue sample is collected into RNARetain® solution in a single-use,
prefilled container and can be stored in reagent for up to 3 days at 35 to 39°C, 7 days
at 18 to 25°C, 30days at 2 to 8°C, or 3 years at -15 to -30°C before RNA extraction.
Tissue should be submerged in RNARetain® for at least 12 hours prior to freezing.
The RNARetain® solution can rapidly permeate tissue to protect cellular nucleic
acids from nucleases that would otherwise rapidly degrade the nucleic acids within
the specimen. RNA can be extracted from preserved breast tissue and utilized in
downstream molecular testing.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision and reproducibility of breast tissue specimens preserved using
the RNARetain® device was demonstrated using the MammaPrint® device in
submission k070675. Five previously analyzed tumor samples (one
borderline, two high-risk samples, and two low-risk samples) were processed
in duplicate for RNA isolation over multiple days according to standard
MammaPrint® protocols. No statistically significant difference in
MammaPrint® risk group assignment or MammaPrint® index between the
two separate RNA isolations was observed.
A subsequent repeatability study compared RNA integrity, purity and yield
using breast tissues from each of the 3 subjects that were sectioned into 20
sections with adjacent sections split between storage in RNARetain® and
fresh frozen. Small variations were observed among replicates in RNA purity
as determined by A /A (1.51 to 6.96% CV), quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-
260 280
PCR) of a housekeeping gene (1.33 to 3.97% CV), and RNA integrity as
measured by either the ratio of 28S:18S RNA (10.3 to 18.8% CV) or RNA
Integrity Number (RIN) values. A variation is noted in RNA yield and is
likely due to the tissue composition (e.g., the amount of fat and stroma present
vs. epithelial tissue).
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability of tissues stored in RNARetain®
The effect of shipment of a tumor in RNARetain® on stability of
MammaPrint® results was demonstrated in k070675. The tumor was selected
from which both immediately snap-frozen and RNARetain® preserved
sections were available. Both sections of the tumor had a similar tumor cell
percentage and similar RNA quality. Both samples were labeled 5 times and
hybridized on MammaPrint® microarrays according to standard protocols.
MammaPrint® Indices were compared to determine if samples shipped in
RNARetain® have a greater stability than tumor sections which are
immediately stored at -70°C after excision. Results showed that the
incorporation of both Cy5 and Cy3 were significantly higher for samples
shipped in RNARetain® (Unpaired T-tests, p=0.018 and p=0.001
respectively). The variance in MammaPrint® indices was smaller for samples
that were stored in RNARetain® compared to the samples that were frozen
immediately (SDev 0.022 vs. 0.042). An unpaired T-test of the MammaPrint®
4

--- Page 5 ---
index revealed no significant difference in the actual MammaPrint® indices
for the RNARetain® and frozen samples (p=0.24). Based on these
experiments, the stability in MammaPrint® index is greater in samples stored
in RNARetain® than in samples that were immediately frozen. The difference
in MammaPrint® index between RNARetain® and frozen tissue (Δ0.027) was
within the previously determined acceptable limit of index variation.
In another subsequent study, human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 were
grown and resuspended in RNARetain®, incubated overnight at 2 to 8°C, then
subjected to up to 7 days at 35 to 39°C, up to 15 days at 18 to 25°C, up to 60
days at 2 to 8°C, and up to 3 years at -15 to -30°C. RNA Yield (A260), Purity
(A260/A280), and Integrity (28S:18S ratios) were compared to Fresh Frozen
cells. Samples are stable up to 3 days at 35 to 39°C, 15 days at 18 to 25°C, 60
days at 2 to 8°C, and up to 3 years at -15 to -30°C.

Stability studies were performed with 3 lots of the 8 mL vial (6 mL volume)
up to 20 months with storage at room temperature (18 to 25°C) and showed
acceptable performance. Additional stability studies with the 6 mL vial (5 mL
volume) and 2 mL vial (1 mL volume) configurations were also performed
and demonstrated acceptable stability of up to 36 months at room temperature.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The performance of RNARetain® was demonstrated in k070675 based on a
comparison to results obtained from fresh frozen tissue using the
MammaPrint® device. The samples for this study were collected in 2003 as a
pilot study for the Dutch Raster clinical trial sponsored by the Dutch Health
Insurance Council where tumor tissue samples were shipped in RNARetain®
from 20 hospitals. One set consisted of 33 breast tumor samples of which one
part of the sample was immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored
at -70ºC, another part was stored in RNARetain® for 3 to 5 days at room
temperature and subsequently removed from the preservation solution, snap
frozen and stored at -70ºC. Another set comprised of 18 tumors of which two
parts were available for research that were immediately snap frozen and stored
at -70ºC. RNA isolation and DNAse treatment were performed in this same
period. H&E stained sections were re-examined by a pathologist to confirm
invasive ductal carcinoma and sufficient tumor cell content. All samples were
hybridized on MammaPrint® microarrays, and passed all sample, labeling and
hybridization QCs. Analysis was performed using Feature Extraction version
8.5 and XPrint version 1.40. MammaPrint® indices of paired RNARetain®
and frozen samples have a median difference of 0.070. The Pearson
correlation (0.94) and regression analysis indicate a high similarity (R2 =
0.90). This finding is similar to the results of a series of tumors of which two
frozen samples were available and were collected in the same time period.
The median difference in MammaPrint® Index was 0.105. A comparison of
the differences in both series (RNARetain®-frozen vs. frozen-frozen) showed
no significant difference (t-test, p=0.57) indicating no variation is introduced
by RNARetain®.
b. Matrix comparison:
As described above.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:

b. Clinical specificity:

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
