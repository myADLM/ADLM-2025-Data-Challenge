L. Test Principle:
The test is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and detection system that
utilizes bi-functional fluorescent probe-primers for the detection of C. difficile in liquid or
unformed stool. The assay is composed of two principal steps: (1) Heat treatment of stool samples,
(2) Amplification of the C. difficile DNA and internal control DNA using bi-functional fluorescent
probe-primers together with reverse primers. The DNA internal control is used to monitor potential
presence of PCR inhibitors. The assay targets a sequence which is in a well conserved region of C.
difficile toxin B gene (tcdB).
The 3M Integrated Cycler is a rapid real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction thermocycler used for
the identification of nucleic acid from prepared biological samples. The instrument utilizes disc
media to contain and process samples. The instrument uses real time flourometric detection to
identify targets within the sample wells. The instrument is controlled by an external computer
running the Integrated Cycler Studio Software.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Inter-laboratory reproducibility and inter/intra-assay reproducibility were assessed at three
sites. Each of the three sites used the same panel, which consisted of contrived samples in
stool-TE buffer matrix spiked with C. difficile bacterial stock. The panel included a high
negative, low positive and medium positive sample. Each site utilized at least two testing
operators and one lot of Simplexa™ C.difficile Universal Direct kit across five days. On each
day two runs were performed, one by each operator. These results met the acceptance criteria
and are acceptable. A summary of the reproducibility results are shown in the table below.

1One replicate was declared “invalid” based on the site operator discretion. It was “Not Detected”.
2One replicate was “Invalid” at Site 2 and additional replicate was tested in Run-1, Day-1 at Site 3 because the site
had thought that one of the three replicates had a ‘bubble’ and therefore as a precaution loaded an additional
replicate at the end of one of the run.
3One replicate of the NTC is “Detected” and may be attributed to possible contamination due to handling.
Note: Two samples – “NTC” and “High Negative” were excluded from reporting Quantitative Reproducibility
Results.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Quality control ranges have been established as indicated in the table below. If the controls
are not within these parameters, patient results should be considered invalid and the assay
repeated. Each laboratory should establish its own Quality Control ranges and frequency of
QC testing based on applicable local laws, regulations and standard good laboratory
practice.

d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined for the Simplexa™ C. difficile Universal
Direct assay by performing limiting dilution studies using bacterial stocks of two strains of
each C. difficile bacteria strain. The strains (ATCC 43255 and NAP 1A) were cultured and
quantified. The LoD was determined using one lot of the Simplexa™ C. difficile Universal
Direct Kit. Tentative LoD was determined using three replicates in screening followed by
confirmation using twenty replicates. LoD was determined to be 560.7 CFU/mL or 1.12
CFU/PCR for strain ATCC 43255 and 76.3 CFU/mL or 0.15 CFU/PCR for strain NAP 1A.
These results met the acceptance criteria and are acceptable.

f. Assay cut-off:
Initial reportable range (assay cut-off) was determined by an analysis of Limit of Detection
(LoD) Studies and Method Comparison studies during the feasibility phase where 45
cycles of amplification were run. The cycling time was later reduced to 40 cycles as
testing demonstrated that samples at LoD were approximately at 38 cycles. Reportable
range (assay cut-off) was determined by analysis of a Limit of Detection study and the
Method Comparison data generated during assay verification testing. Forty cycles of
amplification were performed during assay development to allow for the confirmation of
the assay cut off. The Limit of Detection for C difficile was defined as the lowest
concentration with ≥95% detection for at least 24 replicates as determined by probit
analysis. Analysis of the Limit of Detection study shows that the range of Ct values for the
C. difficile positive samples at or just above the Limit of Detection was <39. The same
LoD sample returned an average Ct value of 36.8. Review of the Method Comparison data
showed that 95% of the positive samples have a Ct value <38.7. Samples which were
positive for C. difficile had Ct values in the range of 23.3 to 39.7. Based on the available
data, the assay cut-off was set at Ct = 40.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical specimens were tested using the Simplexa™ C. difficile Universal
Direct assay and two different FDA cleared assays. A total of 402 samples were
assayed using one FDA cleared molecular assay, and 305 samples were assayed
using another FDA cleared molecular assay. The testing was performed at two
different clinical sites. These two FDA cleared molecular assays and the
Simplexa™ C. difficile were compared to direct and enriched toxigenic
cultures.
In comparison to direct toxigenic culture, the sensitivity and specificity of the
Simplexa™ C. difficile Universal Direct Assay were 90.1% (95% CI:83.8-
94.1%) and 93% (95% CI:91-94.5%), respectively. The sensitivities and
specificities of the two FDA cleared molecular tests were 86.1% (95% CI:76.3-
92.3%) and 94.8% (95% CI:91.9-96.8%) for the first molecular assay and 81.8%
(95% CI:65.6-91.4%) and 93% (95% CI:89.3-95.5%), for the second assay.
In comparison to enriched toxigenic culture, the sensitivity and specificity of the
Simplexa™ C. difficile Universal Direct Assay were 79.6% (95% CI:73.1-
84.8%) and 95.8% (95% CI:94.2-97%), respectively. The sensitivities and
specificities of the two FDA cleared molecular tests were 78.7% (95% CI:69.0-
85.9%) and 97.1% (95% CI:94.6-98.5%) for the first molecular assay and 69.6%
(95% CI:56.7-80.1%) and 97.2% (95% CI:94.3-98.6%), for the second assay.
These results met the acceptance criteria and are acceptable.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
A total of 970 prospectively collected stool specimens were obtained from
patients with signs and symptoms of C. difficile infection from varied
geographic locations. Demographic information, including age, gender was
noted. Testing was performed at three external testing sites located on the
East Coast. Tables below show results comparing the device to direct
toxigenic culture method and to enriched toxigenic culture method.
