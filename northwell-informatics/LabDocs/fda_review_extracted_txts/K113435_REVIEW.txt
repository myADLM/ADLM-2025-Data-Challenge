L. Test Principle:
In the ACE CO2 Assay, carbon dioxide (in the form of bicarbonate HCO3-) reacts with
phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) in the presence of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) and
magnesium to yield oxaloacetic acid (OAA) and phosphate. In the presence of malate
dehydrogenase (MD), the reduced cofactor is oxidized by oxaloacetic acid. The reduced cofactor
absorbs strongly at 408 nm whereas its oxidized form does not. The rate of decrease in
absorbance, monitored bichromatically at 408 nm/692 nm, is proportional to the carbon dioxide
content of the sample.
In the ACE Direct Bilirubin Assay, sodium nitrite added to sulfanilic acid forms diazotized
sulfanilic acid. Bilirubin glucuronide in serum reacts with diazotized sulfanilic acid to form
azobilirubin, which absorbs strongly at 554 nm. The increase in absorbance, measured
bichromatically at 554 nm/692 nm, one minute after sample addition, is directly proportional to
the direct bilirubin concentration.
In the ACE Total Bilirubin Assay, sodium nitrite, when added to sulfanilic acid, forms diazotized
sulfanilic acid. Bilirubin in serum reacts with diazotized sulfanilic acid to form azobilirubin,
which absorbs strongly at 554 nm. The inclusion of DMSO in the reagent as an accelerator,
causes both direct and indirect bilirubin to react rapidly. The increase in absorbance, measured
bichromatically at 554 nm/692 nm, is directly proportional to the total bilirubin concentration.
In the ACE Magnesium Assay, magnesium ions in serum react with Xylidyl blue-1 in an alkaline
medium to produce a red complex which is measured bichromatically at 525 nm/692 nm. The
intensity of color produced is directly proportional to the magnesium concentration. EGTA
prevents calcium interference by preferential chelation of calcium present in the sample. A
surfactant system is included to remove protein interference.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity across the assay range was confirmed by spiking serum samples to a high
concentration of analyte, then diluting the sample to obtain 10 levels to cover the
measuring range of each assay. The assigned value of the highest sample was set to its
mean value. The assigned values of the other levels were calculated by multiplying the
mean value by the dilution ratios. Each level was tested in replicates of 3. Results are
presented below:

CO2
Linear Regression: y = 0.998x + 1.3, r2 = 0.9958
Based on the results of the linearity study and Limit of detection study (see below in
d), the sponsor claimed that the assay’s reportable range is 4-50 mEq/dL.
Direct Bilirubin
Linear Regression: y = 0.990x -0.113, r2 = 0.999
Based on the results of the linearity study and Limit of detection study (see below in
d), the sponsor claimed that the assay’s reportable range is 0.1 to 14.0 mg/dL
Total Bilirubin
Linear Regression: y = 1.003x + 0.18, r2 = 0.9998
Based on the results of the linearity study and Limit of detection study (see below in
d), the sponsor claimed that the assay’s reportable range is 0.2 to 40.0 mg/dL
Magnesium
Linear Regression: y = 0.987x + 0.07, r2 = 0.9983
Based on the results of the linearity study and Limit of detection study (see below in
d), the sponsor claimed that the assay’s reportable range is 0.4 to 6.0 mg/dL
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: CO2 method is traceable to NIST SRM 351. Total Bilirubin assay is
traceable to NIST SRM 916. Direct Bilirubin assay is traceable to gravimetric
standards prepared with NIST material. Magnesium method is traceable to NIST
SRM 909.
The CO2 assay is calibrated by comparing the change in absorbance of the unknown
sample to the change in absorbance of the 30 mEq/L CO2 standard included in the
reagent kit. The CO2 standard was previously cleared under k854544. The Direct
Bilirubin, Total Bilirubin and Magnesium assay is calibrated using the Gemcal
Reference Serum previously cleared under k844344.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantification (LoQ)
were determined according to CLSI EP17-A with the ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry
System. For the LoD studies, low samples and true blanks (n=60 reps, 20 reps per day)
were tested over three days on two ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry Systems. For the LoQ
studies, samples (n = 40 reps, 8 reps per run) were tested in five separate runs over five
days. The results are as follows:

(mg/dL)
Total Bilirubin 0.2 0.2 0.2
(mg/dL)
Mg (mg/dL) 0.2 0.2 0.4
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed to determine the effects from potential
interferents. The various concentration of interferent was spiked into serum pools
containing analytes at normal and abnormal concentrations. All samples were tested
in triplicate. Six interferent levels and the control were tested for each interferent.
Interference is defined as a result that is different from the control by more than the
least detectable dose of the assay (+/-0.1 mg/dL for direct and total bilirubin assay) or
+/-10% for CO2 and Magnesium. The tested ranges and analyte concentrations are
presented in the product labeling.
