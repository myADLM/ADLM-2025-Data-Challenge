H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The ACE Alkaline Phosphatase Reagent is intended for the quantitative determination of
alkaline phosphatase activity in serum using the ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry System.
Measurements of alkaline phosphatase are used in the diagnosis and treatment of liver,
bone, parathyroid and intestinal diseases. This test is intended for use in clinical
laboratories or physician office laboratories. For in vitro diagnostic use only.
The ACE Amylase Reagent is intended for the quantitative determination α-amylase
activity in serum using the ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry System. Amylase
measurements are used primarily for the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatitis
(inflammation of the pancreas). This test is intended for use in clinical laboratories or
physician office laboratories. For in vitro diagnostic use only.
The ACE LDH-L Reagent is intended for the quantitative determination of lactate
dehydrogenase activity in serum using the ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry System.
Lactate dehydrogenase measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of liver
diseases such as acute viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, and metastatic carcinoma of the liver,
cardiac diseases such as myocardial infarction and tumors of the lung and kidneys. This
test is intended for use in clinical laboratories or physician office laboratories. For in vitro
diagnostic use only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For in vitro diagnostic use only. For prescription and point-of-care use.

L. Test Principle:
The ACE Alkaline Phosphatase Reagent for the Axcel Clinical Chemistry System is an
enzymatic photometric test; alkaline phosphatase in serum catalyzes the hydrolysis of the p-
nitrophenyl phosphate substrate to produce inorganic phosphate and p-nitrophenol product
which is measured at 408 nm. The rate of increase of absorbance is directly proportional to
the amount of alkaline phosphatase activity in the serum sample.
→ →
p-nitrophenyl phosphate + H2O (ALP/Mg2+) p-nitrophenol + H3PO4
The ACE Amylase Reagent for the Axcel Clinical Chemistry System is an enzymatic
photometric test; α-amylase in serum catalyzes the reaction of the maltotrios-linked 2-chloro-
p-nitrophenol phosphate substrate to produce 2-chloro-p-nitrophenol product which is
measured at 408 nm. The rate of increase of absorbance is directly proportional to the
amount of amylase activity in the serum sample.
→ →
10CNPG3 (a-Amylase) 9CNP + CNPG2 + 9G3 + glucose
The ACE LDH-L Reagent for the Axcel Clinical Chemistry System is an enzymatic
photometric test; LDH in serum catalyzes the conversion of the L-lactate and NAD substrates
to pyruvate and NADH, and the NADH product which is measured at 340 nm. The rate of
increase of absorbance from the formation of NADH is directly proportional to the amount of
LDH activity in the serum sample.
→ →
L-lactate + NAD+ (LDH) pyruvate + NADH + H+

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity across the assay range was confirmed by spiking serum samples to a high
concentration of analyte, then diluting the sample to obtain between 12 and 15 levels
to cover the measuring range of each assay. The assigned value of the highest sample
was set to its mean value. The assigned values of the other levels were calculated by
multiplying the mean value by the dilution ratios obtained from the manufacturer.
Each level was tested in replicates of four. Data was analyzed to show linear
regression equations and also the 2nd and 3rd polynomial equations, and all data
demonstrated that the 3 devices were linear across the claimed measuring range.
Results are presented below:

Traceability:
Calibration of the LDH-L assay is traceable to a frozen Master Pool of verification
material utilized by the reagent supplier. Each lot of reagent is tested by running the
Master Pool and verifying that results of the Master Pool levels are within an
acceptable percentage of the assigned values of the Master Pool. For value
assignment, each new verification Master Pool is made by gravimetrically adding
quantities of lactate dehydrogenase to a serum pool to target concentrations. Five
levels of Master Pool are prepared, aliquoted and stored at ≤-70° C. The final
values of the Master Pool are assigned for each level by testing at least 3 replicates on
multiple instruments. The activity levels of the new Master Pool are verified using a
previously approved Master Pool lot as a control.
The ACE Alkaline Phosphatase and Amylase reagents are traceable to an IFCC
traceable method, using a linearity verification set with various levels run in triplicate
and assessed for linearity versus the assigned values from the linearity set.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection and the limit of the blank were determined by assaying five low
samples (serum samples) and five true blanks (human serum albumin in saline).
Testing was carried out over three days on two ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry
Analyzers. Serum samples and true blanks were assayed every day for a total of 60
measurements. The limit of quantitation was determined with 40 replicates of 3 low
samples, and was determined to be the mean when the %CV was ≤ 20%.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed to determine the effects from potential
interferents. The various concentrations of interferent were spiked into serum pools
containing alkaline phosphatase, amylase and LDH at normal and abnormal
concentrations. Hemolysis was simulated using a freeze-thaw method to lyse the red
cells. All samples were tested in triplicate. Seven levels were tested for each
interferent. Significant interference was defined as a difference in analyte recovery of
more than ± 10%.

Additional method comparison studies were performed at three Physician Office
Laboratories, with four operators. Operators assayed serum samples ranging from 11-
1388 U/L alkaline phosphatase, 12-1856 U/L amylase, and 18-819 LDH on the Ace
Axcel clinical chemistry analyzer and the ACE clinical chemistry System. The results
are presented in the tables below:

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable. Clinical studies are not typically submitted for this device type.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The reference range for each analyte was verified according to CLSI C28-A3. 50 normal
healthy patient samples from a diverse population with an age range from 20 to 60, were
each analyzed for ALP, Amylase, and LDH. The 95% confidence intervals were
calculated and the reference range was shown to validate the reference range stated in the
literature ( for amylase and LDH: Tietz Clinical Guide to Laboratory Tests, 4th Ed, Wu et
al; for ALP: Medline Plus reference range data base, U.S. National Library of Medicine,
National Institutes of Health).
ALP: 44 – 147 U/L
Amylase: 20 – 104 U/L
LDH: 100 – 190 U/L
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
