L. Test Principle:
Prior to the ACE Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) Reagent assay, whole blood samples require a
pretreatment step, which is done on-board the analyzer. The red blood cells in the sample are
lysed by the Hemoglobin Denaturant and the hemoglobin chains are hydrolyzed. For
determination of HbA1c, a latex agglutination inhibition assay is used. In the absence of
HbA1c in the sample, the agglutinator (synthetic polymer containing the immunoreactive
portion of HbA1c) in the HbA1c Agglutinator Reagent and the antibody-coated
microparticles in the HbA1c Antibody Reagent will agglutinate. The presence of HbA1c in
the sample competes for the antibody binding sites and inhibits agglutination. The increase in
absorbance, monitored monochromatically at 592 nm, is inversely proportional to the HbA1c
present in the sample. For the determination of total hemoglobin, all hemoglobin derivatives
in the sample are converted to alkaline hematin. The reaction produces a green colored
solution, which is measured bichromatically at 573 nm/692 nm. The intensity of color
produced is directly proportional to the total hemoglobin concentration in the sample. The
concentrations of both HbA1c and total hemoglobin are measured, the ratio is calculated and
the result reported as percent HbA1c.
The CEDIA T Uptake assay uses recombinant DNA technology to produce a unique
homogeneous enzyme immunoassay system. The assay is based the bacterial enzyme β-
galactosidase, which has been genetically engineered into two inactive fragments. These
fragments spontaneously re-associate to form fully active enzyme which, in the assay format,
cleaves a substrate, generating a color change that can be measured spectrophotometrically.
In the assay, enzyme donor thyroxine conjugate binds directly to the unoccupied thyroxine-
binding sites in the sample, preventing the spontaneous re-association of the enzyme
fragments to form the active enzyme. Thus, thyroxine-binding proteins regulate the amount
of β-galactosidase formed from the reassembly of the remaining donor and enzyme acceptor
as monitored by the hydrolysis of the substrate o-nitrophenyl-β-galactopyranoside.
The ACE T4 Assay is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay using ready-to-use liquid ACE
T4 Reagent. The assay uses 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid (ANS) to dissociate
thyroxine from the plasma binding proteins. Using specific antibodies to thyroxine, this assay
is based on the competition of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) labeled thyroxine
and the dissociated thyroxine in the sample for a fixed amount of specific antibody binding
sites. In the absence of thyroxine from the sample, the thyroxine labeled G6PD in the second
reagent is bound by the specific antibody in the first reagent, inhibiting the enzyme's activity.
The enzyme G6PD catalyzes the oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) with nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to form 6-phosphogluconate and reduced nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide (NADH). NADH strongly absorbs at 340 nm whereas NAD+ does not. The rate
of conversion, determined by measuring the increase in absorbance bichromatically at 340
8

--- Page 9 ---
nm/505 nm during a fixed time interval, is directly proportional to the amount of thyroxine in
the sample. The concentration of thyroxine is determined automatically by the ACE Clinical
Chemistry System using a logarithmic calibration curve established with calibrators, which
are provided separately.
In the Ferritin Assay, serum ferritin, in the presence of anti-ferritin conjugated latex
micorparticles, and a buffer promoting aggregation, initiates an antigen-antibody reaction,
resulting in the agglutination of the latex microparticles. The agglutination is detected
turbidimetrically by an absorbance change measured at a wavelength of 592 nm. The
magnitude of the absorbance change is proportional to the ferritin concentration in the
sample.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
17

--- Page 18 ---
Traceability:
For HbA1c, traceability is based on NGSP. Therefore, the following statement
has been added to the Calibration section of the package insert (consistent with
the predicate device package insert):
“The Hemoglobin A1c Assay has met the requirements of the National
Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program. Certification from the National
Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) requires annual renewal.
Please refer to the NGSP website at http://www.ngsp.org/ to view the current
list of NGSP certified methods.”
For T4, traceability is based on the manufacturer’s internal standards utilizing a
T4 purity of at least than 98%. The manufacturer verifies each level of the
Standard calibrators against the previous standard at ± 2% with a replicate of
n=10 per level. Additionally, the standard concentrations are verified with a
minimum of two commercial methods.
T4 calibration curves generated from standards are verified utilizing commercial
controls (n=3 per level for low, medium, and high concentrations). In addition,
a correlation requirement between standards (current and new set) of equal or
greater than 0.995 is established by the manufacturer utilizing patient samples
(n=21) and CAP (College of American Pathologists) samples (n=10). A slope
(0.95 – 1.05) and intercept (-0.70 – 0.70) are required.
For Cedia T Uptake, traceability is based on the manufacturer’s in-house
standards and method comparison testing. Calibrators and reagents are traceable
to a required % purity of the original raw material. The Hypothyroid Calibrator
level, 15%, is gravimetrically prepared from a Thyroxine Binding Globulin
Stock and T-Uptake Serum, then lyophilized and stored at 2 -8 degree C. The
Hyperthyroid Calibrator level, 50%, is gravimetrically prepared from a T4
Stock and T-Uptake Serum, then lyophilized and stored at 2 -8 degree C.
T Uptake calibration curves generated from kit calibrators are verified
utilizing commercial controls (n=3 per level for low, medium, and high
concentrations). In addition, a correlation requirement between
standards (reference and on-test set) of equal or greater than 0.980 is
established by the manufacturer utilizing patient samples (n=21). The
sponsor’s acceptance criteria are slope (0.93 – 1.07) and intercept (-2.00
– 2.00).
For the Ferritin Assay, the Ferritin calibrator is traceable to the WHO 1st
International Ferritin Standard, 1984, lot 80/602”.

d. Detection limit:
The sponsor performed the detection limit studies for ACE reagents on the ACE
Axcel Clinical Chemistry System. Limit of detection for HbA1C is based on
linearity studies and is 4.2 %. Limit of detection for T Uptake is based on linearity
studies and is 16.4 %. The LoB, LoD and LoQ were determined according to
CLSI EP 17-A for the Axcel Chemistry System for Ferritin and T4. For LoD, low
samples and true blanks (n = 60, 20 reps per day) were tested over three days on
two instruments. For LoQ, samples (N=40, 6 reps per day) were tested in 5
separate runs over 5 days. The reportable range lower limits are as follows:

Interference studies were performed to determine the effects from potential
interferents. The ACE reagents were tested for interference caused by ascorbic
acid, bilirubin, hemoglobin (with the exception of HbA1c) and
lipemia/triglycerides and other potential interferents that were spiked into serum
pools containing HbA1c, T4 , T uptake and Ferritin reagents at normal and
abnormal concentrations. All samples were tested in triplicate. Seven levels were
tested for each interferent.
For all four reagents, studies to determine the effects of interferences were
performed in accordance with CLSI Guidance Document EP7-A2.
Interference for each of these assays is considered to be significant by the sponsor
if the analyte recovery changes by more than ±10%.
The level at which there is no significant interference for each analyte is listed
