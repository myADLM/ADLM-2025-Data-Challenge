L. Test Principle:
ACE Direct Total Iron-Binding capacity (TIBC) Reagent
The Direct TIBC Color reagent releases iron from transferrin, forming a color complex with
the dye. Then the Direct TIBC Buffer is added, shifting the pH and resulting in a large
affinity of transferrin for iron. The serum transferrin rapidly binds the iron by abstracting the
iron from the dye-iron complex. The decrease in absorbance is directly proportional to the
total iron binding capacity of the serum sample. The absorbance is measured at 647 nm.
ACE Serum Iron Reagent
The transferring-bound iron in serum is released at a pH and reduced from ferric to ferrous
iron. These ions react with ferrozine to form a violet color complex, which is measured
bichromatically at 554 nm/692 nm. The intensity of color produced is directly proportional
to the serum iron concentration.
ACE Lipase Reagent
Serum lipase acts on a natural substrate, 1, 2-diglyceride, to liberate 2-monoglyceride. A
series of redox reactions take place leading to the formation of a quinine dye. The rate of
formation of the dye, determined bichromatically at an absorbance of 573nm/692 nm, is
proportional to the lipase activity in the sample.

Linearity studies were carried out using dilutions of a spiked serum samples.
Thirteen samples with increasing lipase concentrations were measured in triplicate.
The sample range tested was 14.5 to 757.7 U/L.
Claimed Measuring Range Intercept Slope r2

Based on the linearity data, the measuring range claimed from 15-700 U/L was
supported.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
ACE Direct Total Iron-Binding capacity (TIBC) Reagent
Traceable to another commercially available FDA cleared assay by method
comparison. The calibrator was previously cleared under k060264.
ACE Serum Iron Reagent
Traceable to NIST SRM 937. The calibrator was previously cleared under k961588.
ACE Lipase Reagent
Traceable to another commercially available FDA cleared assay by method
comparison. The calibrator was previously cleared under k897150.
d. Detection limit:
Detection Limits (LoB and LoD) were performed using 60 blank and 60 low serum
samples as per the recommendations of CLSI EP 17A protocol. LoB and LoD were
calculated to be: TIBC: LoB =35 µg/dL, LoD = 42 µg/dL; Total Iron: LoB = 2 µg/dL,
LoD = 5 µg/dL; Lipase: LoB = 8.44 U/L, LoD = 10.63 U/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
ACE Direct Total Iron-Binding capacity (TIBC) Reagent
Interference studies were performed by using serum pools containing 258.0 μg/dL to
296.6 μg/dL and 600 µg/dL of TIBC with individual interferents at a range of
concentrations. The sera were assayed for TIBC (n = 3 replicates) and the mean result
calculated. Interference was considered to be significant by the sponsor if the analyte
recovery changed by > ± 10%. The results reported were obtained on ACE Axcel
Clinical Chemistry System analyzer using fresh ACE Direct Total Iron-Binding
capacity (TIBC) Reagent.

Because hemolysis interferes with the above assays, therefore, the sponsor put the
following limitations in the labeling for TIBC and Iron:
“Do not use hemolyzed sample.”

ACE Clinical Chemistry System, ACE TIBC Reagent (k931786) was used as the
predicate method, using recommended applications and procedures on the ACE
Clinical Chemistry System analyzer and calibrating with ACE Direct TIBC
Calibrators. One hundred and nine serum samples were assayed in parallel by both
the candidate and predicate methods and the results compared by Deming regression.
The range tested was 96 to 598 µg/dL. Two samples were altered.
The comparison by Deming regression resulted in a slope of 0.979 (95%CI = 0.961 to
0.9998), an intercept of 2.5 (95%CI = -9.2 to 4.3), correlation coefficient of R2 =
