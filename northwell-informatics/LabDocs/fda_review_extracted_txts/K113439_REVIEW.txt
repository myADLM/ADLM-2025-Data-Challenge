DIN EN 13640:2002: Stability testing of in vitro diagnostic reagents
L. Test Principle:
The principle of the EUROLINE Profile Autoimmune Liver Disease 8 Ag (IgG) Kit
is that of an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using a membrane as the
solid phase instead of microtiter wells. Different purified antigens have been coated
and applied in easy to read lines (bands) onto a membrane strip.
Autoantibodies in patient samples bind to the bands and are detected via a secondary
antibody linked to an enzyme. The strips are evaluated visually by comparison of the
band intensity with the reaction control card or scanned and then evaluated with
EUROLineScan.
The control band on the strips contains (non-specific) anti-human IgG, which reacts
with the sample IgG to show a color reaction if the incubation was performed
correctly and so represents a function test on each single strip.
The positive control contains a mixture of the targeted antibodies which bind to the
antigen coated on the blot strips. A strip incubated with the positive control shows a
positive result. If either the control band or the strip incubated with the positive
control is negative, test results are invalid and should be repeated.
The qualitative results are reported for each individual antibody separately as positive
or negative. The intensity of the reaction is not reported but only as a means to
distinguish between a positive and negative reaction and not as an indication of
disease status. The interpretation of the test results does not include a combined score
or diagnosis.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
Test results were evaluated by visual or automated reading of the test strips.
For visual evaluation, the reaction intensity of each antigen band on the test strip
was compared to the two color bars on the reaction control card that correspond to
the intensities just below (negative) and just above (positive) the cut-off.
For automated evaluation, the test strips are scanned using a flatbed scanner and
evaluated with EUROLineScan with a cut-off of 11 grey scale units.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
i. Visual evaluation.
Assay reproducibility was determined by testing 5 to 9 samples that cover
the complete range of results (negative, positive and near to cut-off) for
each antigen (see table below). The intra-assay reproducibility is based on
20 replicates tested in one day and the inter-assay reproducibility on 20
different runs, each run performed by the same reader on a different day.
The lot-to-lot reproducibility was tested in 3 different runs using 3
different lots. The reproducibility data showed no positive sample was
4

--- Page 5 ---
found negative and vice versa.
The inter-reader reproducibility of 3 samples that cover the complete
range of results (negative, positive and near to cut-off) for each antigen
(see table below) was evaluated by 3 different technicians and under 3
different light conditions (sunlight, neon light and electric bulb light). No
deviation was observed between the individual readings and from the light
conditions.

ii. Automated evaluation.
The reproducibility of the automatic evaluation was investigated by
repeated scanning and analysis of test strips incubated with 16 different
serum samples displaying signals for different antibodies near the cut off.
The processed test strips were scanned using three different flatbed
scanners, each scanner was used 10 times scanning the same strips and the
results were evaluated by EUROLineScan. The scanner intensity values
of the 30 analyses were used to calculate coefficients of variation (CV’s).
The results are shown in the tables below.

The use of the EUROLineScan software compared to visual reading was
investigated using a panel of serum sample preparations covering the
whole range of antigens. The samples were tested in 20 different runs,
each run on a different day using the same kit lot. Each run was
performed by the same technician and evaluation was performed both

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: There are no reference standards for these analytes.
Kit Stability:
i. Real-time and Accelerated stability
The stability studies were performed in accordance with EN 13640
(Stability Testing of In Vitro Diagnostic Reagents) to demonstrate
unopened kit shelf-life stability (from the date of manufacture when stored
at recommended temperature 2-8°C) and opened kit shelf-life stability.
The acceptance criteria are that results do not differ more than one result
level [pos, pos (near the cutoff), neg (near the cutoff) and neg] from the
reference run.
For real-time stability study, three lots of all kit components stored at
recommended storage temperature 2-8°C were evaluated at different
occasions with three samples per antigen band. Original sealed kits and
opened kits were demonstrated to be stable for up to 18 and 12 months,
respectively, when stored at 2-8ºC.

For accelerated study, three lots of all kits components were stored for 7
days at 37°C and evaluated with 3 samples per antigen band. The same
lots stored at 4°C were used as reference. Reagents were shown to be
stable for 7 days at 37°C.
ii. Transport stability
To simulate transportation of kits from Europe to US, one lot of an
example EuroLine test kit with equal composition and technology as
EUROLINE Profile Autoimmune Liver Disease 8 Ag (IgG) Kit was stored
for 7 days at 4°C and -20°C and evaluated with 4 different samples.
Transportation has no significant influence on the results.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity: Cross-reactivity was investigated using a panel of samples
serologically positive for antibodies to granulocyte cytoplasm (n = 10), thyroid
gland antigens (n=10), islet cell antigens (n=10), cardiolipin /anti-
phospholipid syndrome (n=5) and the CDC ANA reference panel (n=12).
Clinical samples from the following groups were also included: autoimmune
hepatitis type 1 (n=84), primary sclerosing cholangitis (n=19), systemic lupus
erythematosus (n=10), rheumatoid arthritis (n=50), celiac disease (n=7), non-
alcoholic steatohepatitis (n=30) and viral hepatitis (HBV, HCV; n=39). Out
of 286 total samples, 9 samples tested positive.
Interferences: Interference testing was performed for each antigen using at
least 5 samples that cover the complete range of results (negative, positive and
near to cut-off) for each antigen. Each sample was spiked with three different
levels of endogenous interfering substances, namely hemoglobin, triglycerides
and bilirubin. Evaluation of test results was performed visually and no
significant interference was observed for concentrations up to 500 mg/dl for
hemoglobin, 2000 mg/dl for triglycerides and 40 mg/dl for bilirubin.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off is predefined by the visual evaluation. A sample is positive if the
respective band is clearly visible. The cutoff for each antigen on the
EUROLINE was set to the lowest limit of a clearly visible band. To achieve
the uniform cut-off for each antigen, during the production several sample
strips for each antigen are manufactured with the antigen used in different
dilutions. These sample strips are then processed with positive and negative
reference sera and the optimal dilution for each antigen is identified.
Afterwards the strips are manufactured using each antigen in its optimal
dilution.
To confirm the assay cut-off, 261 clinically characterized samples from PBC
and AIH patients, as well as 171 control samples were tested. The results
10

--- Page 11 ---
showed that negative and positive results can clearly be discriminated by the
assay.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 295 clinically characterized samples (99 from patients with
autoimmune hepatitis, 89 from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, 15 from
patients with AIH/PBC overlap syndrome, 42 from patients with viral
hepatitis, and 50 from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)) were evaluated
and results were compared to the results for the predicate devices. In addition,
6 to 29 artificial samples with antibody concentrations close to the cut-off
were created for each antigen by mixing positive samples with negative
sample as diluent of the same matrix. The results and the positive and
negative agreement between the device and the predicates are shown below.
Borderline results (from the predicate) were not included in the agreement
calculations.

b. Matrix comparison:
Comparisons between serum and each of EDTA, heparin, and citrated plasma were
performed using 8-11 sample pairs selected to cover the complete range of results
(negative, positive and close to cut-off) for each antigen. The results found no
positive sample was found negative and vice versa.
