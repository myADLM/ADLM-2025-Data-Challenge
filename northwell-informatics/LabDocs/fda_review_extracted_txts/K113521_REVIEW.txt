L. Test Principle:
The Calcium Gen. 2 test system employs a photometric test method where calcium ions
react with a calcium specific polyamino carboxylic acid under alkaline conditions to form
a complex. This complex reacts in the second step with EDTA. The calcium
concentration is directly proportional to the change in absorbance which is measured
photometrically.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All the performance studies were conducted using the cobas c501 analyzer.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated according to the CLSI Document EP5-A2, Evaluation
of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods. This study
assessed repeatability (within-run precision), and intermediate precision (total
precision based on between-day, between-run, and within-day). Imprecision
of the assay was established by assessing human serum pool and urine pool
with one reagent lot, two runs per day for 21 days on one cobas c501 analyzer
with one lot of previously cleared calibrators. Results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The measuring range of the assay is 0.8 to 20.1 mg/dL (0.20 - 5.0 mmol/L) for
serum and plasma samples and 0.8 to 30.1 mg/dL (0.20 - 7.5 mmol/L) for
urine samples. High analyte level serum and urine samples were diluted with
0.9% NaCl to produce eleven concentrations across the measuring ranges
(serum samples were in the range of 0.5 to 20. 6; urine samples were in the
range of 0.4 to 32.2). Calcium levels were measured in triplicate. The
measured vs. expected linear regression analysis for all sample types
generated a linear regression as follows:
Serum: y=1.000x-0.000 r2=0.999
Urine: y=1.0028x-0.0152 r2=0.999
Results of the study support the sponsor’s claim that the assay is linear from
0.8 to 20.1 mg/dL for serum and plasma samples and 0.8 to 30.1 mg/dL for
urine.
For urine sample only: Users can select automatic re-run with dilution for
samples above 30 mg/dL on the cobas c501 analyzer. A dilution factor of 5 is
automatically applied. There is no automatic re-run function available for
serum and plasma samples Therefore, the extended measuring range of urine
samples using automated rerun with dilution was validated by performing an
experiment comparing the instrument auto-rerun results with a simple manual
dilution. Two cobas c 501 analyzers were used in this experiment. Three
samples with calcium concentrations > 30 mg/dL were manually diluted in
triplicate per analyzer. Sample medians were compared to the instrument
auto-rerun results. Percent recovery was calculated. Results from this study
were within 90% to 110% recovery.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators were cleared in k062319 .
Precinorm U Plus and Precipath U Plus were previously cleared in k042389.
PreciControl ClinChem Multi 1 and Multi 2 were previously cleared in
k102016.
The sponsor performed reagent stability studies and protocol and acceptance
were reviewed and found to be adequate. Accelerated stability studies were
performed to simulate 24 months stability of the reagent when stored at 2°C to
8°C. Real time stability studies are still on-going.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of the Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection were established
following the CLSI guideline EP17-A: Protocols for Determination of Limits
of Detection and Limits of Quantitation. The analyte free urine and serum
samples were used for determination of LoB values. Each sample was
5

--- Page 6 ---
measured with 3 reagent lots in 5-fold determinations in 6 runs, distributed
over 3 days on 2 cobas c 501 analyzers. In total, 60 determinations were
obtained per reagent lot. Data analysis was based on determination of the 95th
percentile of the 60 measured values. The LoB was determined to be 0.24
mg/dL (0.06 mmol/L) for urine and 0.12 mg/dL (0.03) mmol/L for serum.
5 samples with low-analyte concentration (serum samples and urine samples)
were used in determination of LoD values. Specifically, the low analyte urine
and serum samples were each measured with 3 reagent lots in 1-fold
determinations in 6 runs, distributed over 3 days on 2 cobas c501 analyzers.
The sponsor concludes that these results support a performance claim of LoB=
0.4 mg/dL (0.10 mmol/L) and LoD= 0.8 mg/dL (0.20 mmol/L) for serum and
urine.
The LoQ was determined in accordance with CLSI-EP17 A requirements. For
LoQ, a low level sample set was prepared by diluting 3 human serum samples
with analyte free diluent (0.9% NaCl). The sample set was measured with 3
reagent lots in 1-fold determination in 6 runs, distributed over 3 days on 2
cobas c 501 analyzers. In total, 180 determinations were obtained per reagent
lot. To determine the LoQ, the differences between the expected values and
the measured mean value (n=12) were calculated for each member of the low
level sample set to determine the total error. The LoQ is derived from a plot
on the allowable error versus the expected calcium value at a total error of less
than 15% for serum and less than 25% for urine. LoQ was determined to be
0.8 mg/dL for both serum and urine.
The Ca Gen.2 assay has the measuring range of 0.8 to 20.1 mg/dL for serum
and 0.8 to 30.1 mg/dL for urine.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed studies to evaluate effect of endogenous interferences
for icterus (conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin), hemolysis (hemoglobin),
lipemia (intralipids), and magnesium and exogenous compounds on the
performance of the Calcium Gen. 2 assay, following CLSI EP7-A2,
Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline. Testing was
done in the presence of two levels of Calcium (~8 mg/dL and ~ 16.4 mg/dL)
and different concentrations of the listed compounds. Percent recovery was
calculated relative to control samples (serum and urine) containing Calcium
without spiked compounds. The sponsor defines non-significant interference as
<10% difference between the spiked and the control samples. Based on the
results, the sponsor concludes the following:
Serum:
Icterus: no significant interference up to an I index of 60
Hemolysis: no significant interference up to and H index of 1000
Lipemia: no significant interference up to an L index of 1000
Magnesium: no significant interference up to 15 mmol/L

--- Page 7 ---
Urine:
Icterus: no significant interference up to a conjugated bilirubin concentration
of 60 mg/dL
Hemolysis: no significant interference up to a hemoglobin concentration of
1000 mg/dL
Magnesium: no significant interference up to a concentration of 60 mmol/L
