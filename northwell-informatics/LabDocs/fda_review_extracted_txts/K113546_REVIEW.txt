L. Test Principle:
The Elecsys Vitamin D Assay is a competitive protein binding assay which uses
Vitamin D Binding Protein for detection of 25-Hydroxyvitamin D. The sample is
treated with pretreatment reagent in the first incubation period. This releases vitamin
D from the endogenous vitamin D binding protein present in the patient’s sample. In
the next incubation, vitamin D binding protein labeled with ruthenium is added and a
complex is formed between the vitamin D (25-OH) and the ruthenylated vitamin D
binding protein. In the 3rd and final incubation, streptavidin-coated microparticles are
added along with vitamin D (25-OH) labeled with biotin. Any unbound ruthenium
labeled vitamin D binding proteins become occupied with biotin-labeled vitamin D
(25-OH). The complex consisting of the ruthenylated vitamin D binding protein and
the biotinylated vitamin D (25-OH) becomes bound to the solid phase via interaction
of the biotin and streptavidin. The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring
cell where the electrochemiluminescence emission is detected. Results are
determined using a calibration curve that is generated on each instrument by a 2 point
calibration provided with the reagent bar code.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Evaluations described below were performed on the cobas e 411
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the Elecsys® Vitamin D assay was evaluated according to CLSI EP5-A2
guideline. Two reagent lots were evaluated. The protocol consisted of testing 2
replicates of each control (PC Varia = PreciControl Varia 3) and human sera (HS) per
run, 2 runs per day for 21 days. The human sera were all native, single donors.
Repeatability and Intermediate precision were calculated. Results are tabulated

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity of the Elecsys Vitamin D assay was evaluated according to CLSI EP6-A.
A high analyte serum sample was diluted with a low analyte serum sample (depleted)
to prepare concentrations throughout the measuring range and samples were assayed
in 3-fold determination within a single run.
The linear regression equation yielded slope of 1.07 and intercept of -1.13 (r2= 0.996) for
the measured sample ranged from 0 to 62 (0, 3,7,12,18,22,28,32,38,44,48,52,56,60,62)
ng/mL.
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claim that the assay is linear across the
measuring range of 5 – 60 ng/mL.

Calibrator
Calset Components:
The Elecsys Vitamin D Calset contains 25-hydroxyvitamin D in a lyophilized human
serum matrix. Target values are 2.0 [target range: 1.0 to 3.0] and 37.0 ng/mL (target
range: 33.0-41.0).
Traceability/value assignment:
The values are standardized against an LCMS/MS assay which is in turn standardized
against the NIST standard. The Elecsys Vitamin D CalSet assigned values are
determined with the Elecsys Vitamin D assay. A master calibrator set is available and
traceable to a reference method (LC-MS/MS). The assigned values for Elecsys
Vitamin D CalSet are read from the master calibration curve.
Stability:
Calset stability is evaluated under the manufacturer’s recommended storage
conditions including: after reconstitution, after freeze-thaw conditions, and unopened.
The sponsor claims that the CalSet is stable at up to hundred twenty (120) hours at 2
to 8°C; up to ninety (90) days at -15 to -25°C and for one freeze/thaw cycle (Table
14). Stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
adequate.
Control materials:
Components:
Lyophilized Synthetic 25-OH Vitamin D in a human serum matrix, at target levels of
13, 17, 32 ng/mL. This control material also contains additional analytes previously
cleared under k060755, k971833, k082340, k993706, k051297 and k070709.
Value assignment:
Values are assigned for each lot of Elecsys® PreciControl Varia 3 in combination
with each assay reagent lot available. The controls are run in duplicate on a minimum
of 3 analyzers (minimum n=6). The assigned value of each control level is defined as
the median value obtained.
Stability:
Studies to support the claimed storage for unopened at 2-8ºC up to the stated
expiration date, for reconstituted at 2 - 8ºC: 72 hours, and at -20ºC: 31 days(freeze
only once), on - analyzers at 20-25ºC: up to 5 hours were reviewed. Stability
protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be adequate.

Value assignment:
For each Elecsys Vitamin D CalCheck 5 lot manufactured, the CalChecks are run in
duplicate on at least three E170/cobas e 601/cobas e 602 analyzer measuring cells.
The assigned value of each CalCheck is defined as the median value obtained over at
least 6 determinations (duplicate runs on at least 3 analyzers) of the respective
CalCheck.
Stability:
The package insert claim for stability of reconstituted Elecsys Vitamin D CalCheck 5
is up to 5 hours at 20-25°C. The CalCheck products are not stored on-board the
analyzer, therefore no on-board stability claims are made. Stability protocols and
acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be adequate.
d. Detection limit:
The LoB and LoD were determined according to protocols in CLSI EP-17 to support
the LoB claim of 2 ng/mL and LoD claim of 3 ng/mL.
LoQ: The precision at low concentrations was determined to support the lower assay
limit. Eight native human serum sample pools with concentrations ranging from 2.25
to 20.5 ng/mL were tested once per run, 2 runs per day over 5 days. The mean,
standard deviation and coefficient of variation for each sample were calculated. LoQ
is calculated to be 5.00 ng/mL. The CV at this concentration is less than ≤ 20%.

control samples. The highest concentrations at which no significant interference was
observed are shown below:
Hemoglobin: < 200 mg/dL (The sponsor notes in the package insert that samples
showing visible signs of hemolysis may cause interference and hemoglobin >2g/dL
may lead to elevated results
Biotin: < 70 ng/mL.
Lipemia: < 400 mg/dL.
Bilirubin: No interference up to <66
Cholesterol: Cholesterol at varying levels was spiked into human serum samples
containing Vitamin D concentration near 10 ng/mL, Recoveries for samples
containing < 380 mg/dL cholesterol were within the manufacturers acceptance criteria
of +/- 90%.
Serum proteins: Albumin and IgG were spiked into human serum samples at
concentrations ranging from near 4 g/dL to > 7 g/dL. Vitamin D in the samples
ranged from near 20 ng/mL to near 45 ng/mL. Percent recovery observed up to 7
g/dL albumin was within +/- 90%.
Percent recovery for samples containing up to 3.5 g /dL IgG was within +/-10%.
Higher concentrations of IgG interfered with the assay.

f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable – this is a quantitative assay.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison was performed with a predicate device (k110619). A total of
165 human serum samples from US blood donors were measured (in singlicate).
Results of the Deming Regression analysis are presented in the following table.
N 165
Range (ng/mL) 7 – 58 ng/mL (13-63 ng/mL
on the predicate device)
Slope (95% CI) 1.01 (0.94 – 1.08)
Intercept (ng/mL) (95% CI) 0.53(-1.11 – 2.18)
Correlation Coefficient 0.92 [0.90 to 0.94]
(Pearson’s r) (95% CI)
Sy/x (ng/mL) 4.6
b Matrix comparison:
Anticoagulants:
The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of anticoagulants with the
Elecsys® Vitamin D assay was determined by comparing values obtained from
samples (single donors, native as well as spiked) drawn into Serum, Li-Heparin, K -

EDTA- , K -EDTA-plasma primary tubes and Li-Heparin Plasma Gel Separation

Tubes. Forty serum/plasma pairs per sample material were tested with one reagent lot
on one Cobas e 411 Immunoassay Analyzer. Samples range tested ranged from 5.6 to
58 ng/mL.

Not applicable; this is a quantitative assay.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Serum samples were prospectively collected from apparently healthy adult subjects at
three geographically distinct regions of the US and tested on the Elecsys® Vitamin D
during late fall season. Serum samples were first tested for calcium, magnesium and
phosphate levels. To confirm normal thyroid and parathyroid functions of the
consented subjects, T4, TSH, and PTH levels were also tested. Apparently healthy
was defined as patients with a normal medical history (based on physical knowledge)
and normal nutritional status. The subject samples with missing results, results
outside of the normal range of the above analytes or results that could be affected by
the interference were excluded.
A total of 560 eligible subjects from all sites were used to compute the reference
intervals. The intermediate 95% nonparametric reference interval was computed. The
analysis was performed separately for each site. N, min, max, 2.5, 50, 97.5, median,
coverage for the 95% reference interval, and 90% nonparametric confidence for the
2.5 and the 97.5 quantile were computed for each site.
