L. Test Principle:
The GAL-1E and GAL-1E Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System Blood Glucose
Monitoring System uses glucose oxidase enzyme chemistry as the standard dry
reagent assay for glucose in whole blood. This enzyme assay, with a redox chemical
“mediator” reaction, is used to generate an electrical current proportional to the
glucose concentration in the blood sample. The system is designed as an
amperometric measurement device using current generated for the redox reaction as
the measureable response.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The GAL-1E and GAL-1E Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems are identical
meters. The differences between these meters are that they are marketed under
5

--- Page 6 ---
different trade names and also differ in their intended use population (single-patient
use vs. multiple-patient use.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision previously reviewed in the GAL-1C submission (k102816).
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity study was designed following CLSI EP6-A guideline. Venous
whole blood was used for this study. Eight target glucose concentrations were
prepared by either spiking glucose stock solution into the sample or by
allowing the sample to undergo glycolysis to achieve the following levels:
Glucose level Glucose range
(mg/dL)
1 15 – 20
2 35 – 60
3 70 – 85
4 115 – 150
5 195 – 230
6 290 – 330
7 400 – 450
8 600 - 620
A total of 40 strips per lot (3 lots total) were used at each glucose
concentration using 10 GAL-1E meters. All samples were also tested on a
YSI analyzer to generate the expected values. The observed values were
plotted against an average of the expected values and an appropriate line fitted
by standard linear regression was generated with results summarized below:
Strip Lot Slope Intercept R2
1 1.0148 -1.939 0.9990
2 1.0359 -3.9638 0.9988
3 1.0115 -2.8838 0.9986
The study provided supports the sponsor’s claimed measurement range for
glucose is 20 - 600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: GAL-1E Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to NIST
reference material using NERL standards.

18 months when stored at 15 - 30ºC and the open vial stability is 3 months
after first opening.

System accuracy study:
This study was conducted using samples collected from 158 participants.
Samples containing <50 mg/dL of glucose were allowed to glycolyze and to
obtain sample values >450 mg/dL, samples were spiked with a glucose stock
solution. The range of samples tested was 35 mg/dL to 506 mg/dL (according
to YSI) collected by fingertip. Nine (9) GAL-1E meters and three (3) lots of
GAL-1E test strips were used. Results obtained by the trained professional
were compared to YSI. The glucose meter measurements obtained using the
GAL-1E BGMS were compared to the YSI method for fingerstick, palm, and
forearm samples. The results are shown in the following tables:

3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied
directly to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger,
palm, and forearm only. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test
strip by capillary action.
5. Calibration:
There is no calibration required for the GAL-1E and GAL-1E Multi meters by the
user. The meter is plasma-calibrated.
6. Quality Control:
Glucose control solutions at three different concentrations can be run with this
device. The meter has an algorithm to automatically recognize the control
solutions to prevent control results from being stored in the internal memory as
patient result. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are
provided in the labeling. The control solution readings are not included in the
average of the patient results. An acceptable range for each control level is printed
on the test strip vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control
result falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:

4. EMC Electromagnetic Compatibility and Electrical Safety verification testing of
the GAL-1E Blood Glucose Monitoring System was performed following the
requirements of ISO 15197:2003 (E).
5. Sample volume study:
Previously reviewed in the GAL-1C submission (k102816) and found acceptable
performance using sample volumes ≥0.8µl.
6. Infection Control Studies:
GAL-1E Blood Glucose Meter
The device system is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy
studies were performed on the materials comprising the meter and lancing device
by an outside commercial testing demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis
B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, Dispatch Hospital Cleaner
Disinfectant Towels with Bleach (EPA Registration # 56392-8). Robustness
studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no
change in performance or external materials of the meter and lancing device after
1,825 cleanings and 1,825 disinfection steps with the Dispatch Hospital Cleaner
Disinfectant Towels with Bleach wipes. The robustness studies were designed to
simulate 5 years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate
instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
GAL-1E Multi Blood Glucose Meter
The device system is intended for use in multiple patients with use of a single use,
auto-disabling lancet device. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the
materials comprising the meter and lancing device by an outside commercial
testing demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the
chosen disinfectant, Dispatch Hospital Cleaner Disinfectant Towels with Bleach
(EPA Registration # 56392-8). Robustness studies were also performed by the
sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external
materials of the meter and lancing device after 10,950 cleanings and 10,950
disinfection steps with the Dispatch Hospital Cleaner Disinfectant Towels with
Bleach wipes. The robustness studies were designed to simulate 3 years of
multiple-patient use Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the
validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
7. Readability: The readability of the labeling (user guides, test strip package insert
and control solution package insert) was previously reviewed the GAL-1C
(k102816) submission using a Flesch-Kincaid analysis and were found to be
written at the 8th grade level. The labeling of the candidate meters (GAL-1E and
GAL-1E multi) are identical to the GAL-1C meter.
8. LO/HI Detection:
11

--- Page 12 ---
The low and high detection limits were evaluated to ensure that glucose values
<20 mg/dL are reported by the meter as “LO” and values >600 mg/dL are
reported as “HI”.
9. Drop Test:
In this study, twenty five (25) GAL-1E meters were dropped from a height of 1
meter onto a concrete floor. Each meter was dropped (without a test strip) on all
6 sides, two times per side, and additionally (with a test strip), dropped on the
strip holder side two times. All meters did not break throughout the drop test
study, maintained functionality after being dropped, and provided accurate
glucose control readings (Contrex Plus III level 1) 85 – 127 mg/dL.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
