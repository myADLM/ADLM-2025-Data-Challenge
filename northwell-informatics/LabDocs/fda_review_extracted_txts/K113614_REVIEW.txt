sample was tested once on five different meters for each of three strip lots. The
values from the ACCU-CHEK Compact Plus meter were compared with those
obtained from the reference method. The results from regression analysis are
summarized below:
Lot #1: y = 0.98x – 0.89; r2 = 1.00
Lot #2: y = 0.97x + 0.99; r2 = 1.00
Lot #3: y = 0.97x + 0.52; r2 = 1.00
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of
20 to 580 mg/dL glucose.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The ACCU-CHEK Compact Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System is calibrated to
a hexokinase method on a laboratory analyzer. A method comparison was performed
using this method as the comparative method. See Comparison studies in 2a below.
The controls recommended for the ACCU-CHEK Compact Plus Blood Glucose
Monitoring System were previously cleared under k031755.
Value Assignment and Stability Testing: Two ACCU-CHEK Compact Plus Clear
Control solutions are available for use with the ACCU-CHEK Compact Plus Blood
Glucose Monitoring System. Value assignment and stability for the control solutions
were evaluated in k031755. The shelf life and opened vial stability established in
k031755 were 18 months and 3 months, respectively.
The sponsor provided a real-time protocol with acceptance criteria to verify the
closed-drum stability (shelf life) and on-board or opened-drum stability of the test
strips. The stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable. The sponsor claims a closed-drum (shelf life) of 18 months and an on-
board or opened-drum stability of 90 days when stored at 36-86° F (2-30° C). The
labeling instructs the users not to freeze the test strips.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range for the system is 20 – 580 mg/dL. This range was verified by
the linearity study (M.1.b) above.
e. Analytical specificity:

System Accuracy:
To assess system accuracy, results from the ACCU-CHEK Compact Plus Blood
Glucose Monitoring System were compared to a reference method, PCA-HK (Hitachi
917). Capillary samples from 100 participants with glucose concentrations ranging
from 36-473 mg/dL glucose (obtained using PCA-HK) were analyzed. To obtain
blood glucose concentrations <50 mg/dL and >400 mg/dL, samples were allowed to
glycolize or were spiked to achieve the desired glucose concentration. Five samples
< 50 mg/dL and five samples > 400 mg/dL were analyzed. The results relative to
reference are summarized in the tables below:

The study was performed at 1 clinical site with samples from 154 subjects using three
lots of test strips. After reviewing the system’s instructions for use, the subjects
collected their own sample from the palm without any practice tests and tested their
blood glucose using the Accu-Chek Compact Plus system. A healthcare professional
then obtained a result from the patient’s palm using the Accu-Chek Compact Plus
system. In one instance a healthcare provider result was not obtained, resulting in a
sample size of 153. Finally, a healthcare professional collected a sample from the
finger to be tested on the hexokinase reference method. The results relative to

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger and palm.
The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.
5. Calibration:
The bar code on the label of the strip drum is automatically read by the meter. No
manual coding is required.
6. Quality Control:
Controls are not included in the ACCU-CHEK Compact Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring
System starter kit, but the starter kit box labeling explains how users can obtain two
levels of controls. The labeling also provides recommendations on when to test control
materials. The meter cannot distinguish between blood samples and controls but control
results can be stored in memory. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on
the test strip vial label. If the control values fall outside these ranges, the user is referred
to a troubleshooting chart which includes information on how to contact the Customer
Care Service Center.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit study
In this study, three strip lots were tested singly on ten meters at the following hematocrit
levels: 30, 35, 40, 45, and 55%. The glucose levels in venous blood samples fell into six
categories: 20 – 30, 50 – 70, 100 – 150, 300 – 400, and 500 – 600 mg/dL. A single
replicate was obtained for each combination of test strip, glucose level, and hematocrit.
This resulted in n = 750 data points (5 glucose levels x 5 hematocrit levels x 10 replicates
per sample x 3 strip lots). Glucose concentrations were verified by the sponsor’s
reference method. The bias relative to the reference method was acceptable to support
the claim that hematocrit levels of 30 to 55% do not significantly affect the glucose
results.
2. Sample Volume Study
The sponsor performed a sample volume study to support the claimed minimum sample
volume requirement for the ACCU-CHEK Compact Plus system (1.5 µL) using blood
samples at three glucose concentration ranges (30 - 60, 80 - 120, and 400 - 580 mg/dL).
The system displays an error code when insufficient sample is detected. Results support
the claimed sample volume of 1.5 µL.

3. Altitude Study
In this study, three test strip lots were tested on ten meters with blood samples adjusted to
three glucose concentrations: 30 - 60, 80 - 120, and 400 - 580 mg/dL. The samples
were tested at three altitude levels: sea level, 8202 feet (2500 meters), and at 13,123 feet
(4000 meters). In each concentration range, a total of 50 measurements were performed
on 10 meters at each test altitude with each of the 3 test strip lots. Glucose concentrations
were verified by the sponsor’s reference method. The bias relative to the reference
method was acceptable to support the claim that altitudes up to 13, 123 feet do not
significantly affect the glucose results.
4. Temperature and Humidity Studies
In this study, three test strip lots were tested on five meters at three glucose
concentrations at seven combinations of temperature and humidity. The temperatures
tested were 53.6, 57, 86, and 104° F (12, 14, 30, and 40° C). The relative humidity levels
tested were 10, 45, and 80%. Glucose concentrations were verified by the sponsor’s
reference method. The bias relative to the reference method was acceptable to support
the claim that temperatures from 53.6 - 104° F (12 – 40° C) and relative humidities from
10 – 80% do not significantly affect the glucose results.
5. Infection Control studies
The ACCU-CHEK Compact Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for
single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials
comprising the meter by an outside commercial testing lab demonstrating complete
inactivation of hepatitis B Virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, Super Sani-Cloth
Germicidal Disposable Wipes (EPA Reg. No. 9480-4). Robustness studies were also
performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or
external materials of the meter after 260 cleaning and disinfection cycles, using Super
Sani-Cloth Germicidal Disposable Wipes, to simulate 5 years of use by lay users.
Labeling has been reviewed for adequate instructions in validated cleaning and
disinfection procedures.
6. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing.
The ACCU-CHEK Compact Plus meter in this submission is identical to the meter
cleared under k081389, which passed the testing requirements of IEC/EN 61326, IEC/EN
61326-A1, and IEC/EN 61326+A1-3.
7. Readability Assessment
Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted for the meter user’s manual and
test strip package insert and were found to be 6.8 and 8.0, respectively.
