1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indications(s) for use:
Wondfo Buprenorphine Urine Test:
Wondfo Buprenorphine Urine Test is an immunochromatographic assay for the
qualitative determination of Buprenorphine in human urine at a cutoff concentration of 10
ng/mL. The test is available in a dip card format and a cup format. For in vitro diagnostic
use only. This product is only intended for prescription use and is not intended for point-
of-care use.
The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical
method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. GC/MS or LC/MS
is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment
should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary
result is positive.
Wondfo Oxycodone Urine Test:
Wondfo Oxycodone Urine Test is an immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative
determination of Oxycodone in human urine at a cutoff concentration of 100 ng/mL. The
test is available in a dip card format and a cup format. For in vitro diagnostic use only.
This product is intended for over-the-counter and prescription use.
The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical
method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. GC/MS or LC/MS
is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment
should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary
result is positive.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription (buprenorphine and oxycodone) and over-the counter use (oxycodone).
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable.
I. Device Description:
The tests, to be used with human urine samples, are in different formats: dip card and cup.

Page 3 of 18
The Dip Card format is a test with an integrated cup. It is a rapid test for the qualitative
detection of buprenorphine and oxycodone in human urine. It is a lateral flow
chromatographic immunoassay. When the absorbent end of the test device is immersed into
the urine sample, the urine is absorbed into the device by capillary action, mixes with the
antibody-dye conjugate, and flows across the pre-coated membrane. The absence of sample
drug produces a colored test line, which regardless of its intensity, indicates a negative
result. The presence of sample drug prevents the development of a distinct colored band in
the test region, indicating a potentially positive result.
A colored line will appear in the control region to indicate that the test has been performed
properly.
The Cup format is the same function or performance specification of dip card. It is
composed of an integrated cup and a functional dip card. When the key is inserted to the cup
and rotated to activate the test, the urine is absorbed into the device by capillary action,
mixes with the antibody-dye conjugate, and flows across the pre-coated membrane. The
presence or absence of a sample drug is the same as the dip card format.

L. Test Principle:
Wondfo Buprenorphine and Oxycodone Urine Tests are competitive immunoassays that
are used to screen for the presence of buprenorphine or oxycodone in urine. Both entail a
chromatographic absorbent end where urine is absorbed into the device by capillary action,
mixes with the buprenorphine or oxycodone monoclonal antibody conjugate, and flows
across the pre-coated membrane. When sample drug levels are zero or below the target cut
off (the detection sensitivity of the test), the anti-buprenorphine or anti-oxycodone
monoclonal antibody (mouse) conjugate binds to the buprenorphine-protein or oxycodone-
protein (duck egg) conjugate immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the device. This
produces a colored Test line that, regardless of its intensity, indicates a negative result.
When sample drug levels are at or above the target cutoff, the free drug in the sample binds

to the buprenorphine or oxycodone monoclonal antibody conjugate preventing it from
binding to the buprenorphine-protein or oxycodone-protein conjugate immobilized in the
Test Region (T) of the device. This prevents the development of a distinct colored band in
the test region, indicating a potentially positive result. To serve as a procedure control, a
colored line will appear at the Control Region (C), where the Goat anti mouse IgG
polyclonal antibody is immobilized, if the test has been performed properly.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision study was performed by taking negative urine samples and spiking these
to: 20.0, 17.5, 15.0, 12.5, 10, 7.5, 5.0, 2.5 and 0 ng/mL of buprenorphine,
corresponding to (%) 100, 75, 50, 25, cut-off, -25, -50, -75, and negative of the 10
ng/mL buprenorphine cut-off value; and 200, 175, 150, 125, 100, 75, 50, 25 and 0
ng/mL of oxycodone, corresponding to (%) 100, 75, 50, 25, cut-off, -25, -50, -75, and
negative of the 100 ng/mL oxycodone cut-off value. The levels of buprenorphine and
oxycodone were confirmed by GC/MS. Two sets of operators performed the testing
(group A ran the cup format and group B ran the dip card format) and each
concentration of the samples were divided into 12 sets of 25 (one set per lot per run
for each format). Three lots of the cup and three lots of the dip card formats of the
Wondfo Buprenorphine Urine Test and Wondfo Oxycodone Urine Test were used.
Each of three operators tested 2 aliquots at each concentration for each lot per day (2
runs per day for 25 days), resulting in a total of 50 determinations by each operator at
each concentration. The operators were blinded. A summary of the results is presented
in the tables below.

Stability
Accelerated and real time studies were performed on three lots of cup and dip card
Wondfo Buprenorphine and Wondfo Oxycodone Urine Test formats. Accelerated
stability was performed at 50°C to support an 18 month shelf life. Real-time studies
were performed by storing three lots of cup and dip card formats at 4°C and 30°C
respectively. Performance tests were completed at defined intervals and the results
support a 23 month shelf life at 4°C-30°C for the Wondfo Buprenorphine and
Wondfo Oxycodone Urine Tests. This data supports their claimed 18 month shelf life
for both devices.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical performance of the device around the cutoff is described in Section f.
(Assay cut-off) below.
e. Analytical specificity:
Specificity and cross-reactivity was performed by using three batches of both the cup
and dip card formats of the Wondfo Buprenorphine and Wondfo Oxycodone Urine
Tests. The samples were split into two aliquots and one group of operators ran the cup
format on one set of aliquots and a separate group of operators ran the dip card format
on the other set of aliquots. Thirty drug-free urine samples were tested and all were
found to be negative, five were confirmed by GC/MS to have a concentration of zero.
Cross-reactivity was determined by spiking the target drug, drug metabolites and
related compounds that may cross-react with the target drugs into drug-free urine at
three different concentrations and measuring the samples in triplicate using three
batches of cups and three batches of dip cards. Percent cross reactivity was calculated
by dividing the cut-off concentration by the minimum concentration required to
obtain a positive result and multiplying 100%. A summary of the results are as
follows:

pH:
The pH of a drug-free urine pool was adjusted to pH 4, pH 5, pH 6, pH 7, pH 8 or
pH 9; the urine was spiked with ± 25% of the cut-off concentration of
buprenorphine or oxycodone, individually and tested using three batches/lots of
cup and three batches of dip card of the Wondfo Buprenorphine Urine Test and
Wondfo Oxycodone Urine Tests, respectively. The spiked, pH-adjusted urine was
tested in triplicate. Altering the pH levels to 4.0 to 9.0 of the urine sample did not
affect the accuracy of the test results for any format.
Specific Gravity:
Twelve drug-free urine samples with specific gravities of 1.000-1.035 were
collected and spiked with ± 25% of the cut-off concentration of buprenorphine
and oxycodone using three batches of cup and three batches of dip card formats of
the Wondfo Buprenorphine Urine Test and Wondfo Oxycodone Urine Test,
respectively. The spiked urines of different specific gravities were tested in
triplicate. The results indicate that there is stable performance of the Wondfo
Buprenorphine Urine Test and Wondfo Oxycodone Urine Test (cup and dip card
formats) when urine has a specific gravity between 1.00-1.035.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut off was investigated by using three batches of both the cup and dip card
of the Wondfo Buprenorphine Urine Test and Wondfo Oxycodone Urine Test to test
150 urine samples each. These samples came from the Shezhen Drug Addiction
Recovery Center (25 clinical drug urine samples each with buprenorphine or
oxycodone) and from drug-free urine samples (125 samples) spiked with
buprenorphine or oxycodone (125 samples for each drug) diluted from the
International Drug Standard (Sigma) to concentrations that are ± 25% and 50% of the
cutoff concentrations (10 ng/mL for buprenorphine and 100 ng/mL for oxycodone).
Drug concentrations were confirmed by GC/MS. Results were read by three
laboratory assistants with relevant experience who were blinded to the samples. The
cutoff studies were performed by two separate groups of operators (one for the cup
format and one for the dip card format). Three operators in each group performed the
readings and they were blinded to the sample. Each result was confirmed by at least
two assistants. The results shown below represent samples that were tested at each
concentration for each drug in replicates of 30 using three card or dip card lots (n=90)
and three operators:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
1. Performance of the Wondfo Buprenorphine Urine Test and Wondfo Oxycodone
Urine Test (cup and dip card formats) was established by comparing 80 clinical
samples (40 negative and 40 positive) of each drug against GC/MS. There were
two groups of operators (one for the cup format and one for the dip card format)
and they were blinded to the samples. Each result was read by three laboratory
assistants with relevant experience and a lay person (who is different between
Groups A and B for Oxycodone only) with no experience other than reading the
instructions for use. A summary of results comparing the results of the lay person
to the experienced person are as follows:

b. A lay-user study was performed to assess the suitability of the device for home use.
Six drug-free urine sample pools spiked to ± 25%, ± 50%, ± 75% of the cut-off of
oxycodone (100 ng/mL) and a negative urine pool with no drug were tested. These
concentrations were confirmed by GC/MS and aliquoted into 40 individual containers
per concentration (20 aliquots per concentration for each format). The testing was
performed by 140 blinded lay users divided between three sites (140 users for cup and
a different group of 140 for dip card format for the Wondfo Oxycodone Urine Test).
Each participant received the package insert, 1 blinded sample, and either a test cup
or dip card. The lay persons test result was compared to the GC/MS result to
demonstrate accuracy and precision by lay-users. The following are the results of the
lay-user study pooled together from all three sites for the cup format:

c. The subject’s were to fill out a questionnaire to evaluate the effectiveness of the
labeling. Different people tested the cup and dip card formats.
i. Cup format
Oxycodone:
The participants’ ages ranged from 21-64 and there was a fairly even
distribution between males and females. They come from a variety of career
and education backgrounds and one participant had used a home drug kit
before. They all understood the storage and expiration of the device and that the
test could not be reused. They all understood that they could not insert and
rotate the key until they were ready to test. They all understood to read the
result at 5 minutes (none after 5 minutes) and how to interpret the results.
80/140 said the test was very easy and 60/140 said it was easy. 59/140 said the
instructions were very clear and 81/140 said they were clear. 73/140 said the
interpretation of the results was very clear and 67/140 said they were clear.
When asked what they would do if the device failed to show a result, 98/140
said they would repeat the test with a new test device, 5/140 said they would

device failed to show a result.
ii. Dip Card format
Oxycodone:
The participant’s ages ranged from 21-65 and there were slightly more males
than females. They come from a variety of career and education backgrounds
and none of the participants had used a home drug kit before. They all
understood the storage and expiration of the device and that the test could not
be reused. They all understood that the dip card couldn’t be immersed in urine
above the marker line and understood to read the result at 5 minutes (none after
5 minutes) and how to interpret the results. One of the participants responded
that the strip test was difficult, 64/140 said the test was very easy and 75/140
said it was easy. 72/140 said the instructions were very clear and 68/140 said
they were clear. 80/140 said the interpretation of the results was very clear and
60/140 said they were clear. When asked what they would do if the device
failed to show a result, 110/140 said they would repeat the test with a new test
device, 2/140 said they would turn to another method, and 28/140 said they
would call the manufacturer if the device failed to show a result.
Additionally, a Flesh-Kincaid reading analysis revealed that package inserts (cup and
dip card) for oxycodone had a reading grade level of 7.
