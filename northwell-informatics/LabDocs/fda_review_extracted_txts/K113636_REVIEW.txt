L. Test Principle:
The Gmate™ VOICE system is based on measurement of a small electrical current produced
by the reaction of glucose in the blood sample with the reagents on the Gmate™ blood
glucose test strip. This current changes with the amount of glucose in the blood sample. The
glucose concentration in the sample is calculated based on the electrical current and
displayed on the meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability (between run precision) was evaluated at room temperature using venous
whole blood adjusted to five different levels of glucose with D-(+) Glucose in Phosphate
Buffer 7.4. Operator-to-operator precision was studied by having two operators measure
each sample fifty times. The results are as follows.

low and high glucose concentration pools were mixed to prepare 14 samples with a range
of glucose concentration ranging from 7 to 634 mg/dL. Glucose levels were determined
by the YSI 2300 glucose analyzer. This was performed using three different strip lots.
Each glucose level was measured 5 times using the Gmate Voice blood glucose meters
and compared with those obtained from YSI-2300. A plot of Gmate Voice data versus
YSI reference data was constructed and linear regression analysis was performed on the
data. The device was determined to be linear with the following results:

The claimed measuring range of the device is 20-600 mg/dL
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The reference instrument used is the YSI 2300 Glucose analyzer and is calibrated by YSI
2747 Glucose Standard which is a NIST traceable glucose standard. The controls are
prepared at two target concentrations gravimetrically and the glucose concentrations are
verified with the YSI reference method.
The primary calibrator is traceable to NIST SRM 917b.
Stability
Three lots of Gmate Control solutions were stored at room temperature for 112 days and
were tested using one strip lot periodically and compared to the results on a YSI analyzer
and at time zero. All three lots of control solution passed the acceptance criteria and the
shelf life of the Gmate Control solutions was determined to be 3 months when stored in a
cool, dry place out of sunlight at 4-30°C. For in-use stability, three lots of Gmate Control
solutions were stored at room temperature for three months and three strip lots were used
to test each control solution for in-use stability. All three lots of the control solutions met
the acceptance criteria and the control solutions should be stored at 4-30° and expire three
months after opening the control solution vial.
Three lots of test strips were stored between 2-40°C for 750 days and were tested using
three control solution lots and compared to the results at time zero. The results indicate a
two year shelf-life for the test strips when stored at 2-32°C in a cool, dry place out of
sunlight. Three lots of strips were tested with three lots of control solutions at room
temperature for three months to evaluate the in-use stability of the test strips. All three
lots of test strips met the acceptance criteria and the test strips should be stored at 2-32°C
in a cool, dry place out of sunlight and expire three months after opening the test strip
vial.

System Accuracy:
To assess system accuracy, the Gmate VOICE Blood Glucose Monitoring System was
compared to a YSI 2300 STAT laboratory instrument. Capillary blood samples were
collected in a capillary EDTA tube. To obtain samples below 50 mg/dL, the sample was
incubated to allow glucose to hydrolyze and adjust to human temperature. To obtain
samples above 400 mg/dL, the blood was supplemented with glucose and then incubated
to human temperature. One hundred samples were collected at a clinical center from
diabetic patients throughout one week. Samples between 33-442 mg/dL were tested in the
accuracy study. Linear regression based on single glucose measurements produced the
following: y = 0.9978x -2.1025, R2= 0.9905.The system accuracy is shown below.

There is no calibration required for the Gmate™ VOICE blood glucose meter by the user.
6. Quality Control:
Glucose control solutions at three different concentrations can be run with this device.
Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. An
acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is
cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Infection Control: The device is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection
efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meter and lancing device
by an outside commercial testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of
hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, CaviWipes with EPA registration #
46781-8. The sponsor also demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in
the external materials of the meter and lancing device after 260 cleaning and disinfection
cycles designed to simulate 5 years of single-patient device use (to represent 260
cleanings and 260 disinfections). Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the
validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
2. Usability Study: A usability study was performed to assess the readability of the labeling
by recruiting untrained lay users who were provided with the test kit containing labeling
for the US market. These lay users also completed a questionnaire regarding the clarity of
16

--- Page 17 ---
the instructions and the ease of use of the device. The majority of the users responded
that they understood the instructions and were able to successfully operate the device.
3. Readability Assessment: The sponsor performed a readability assessment of the labeling
and states that the user manual, strip insert, quick reference guide, and controls insert had
a Flesch-Kincaid reading level at the 8th grade level or below.
4. The Customer Care Service Center is available 24/7, 365 days a year. The toll free phone
number is 1-855-464-6283.
5. Temperature and Humidity Studies: The sponsor claims an operating condition range of
10 – 40° C and 10 – 90% relative humidity. Combinations of the claimed temperature
and humidity operating conditions were evaluated by measuring three levels of patient
samples at 10, 25, and 40°C at 10, 50, and 90% humidity using 10 meters. The results
demonstrated that the system produces accurate results over the claimed range of
operating conditions.
6. Altitude Study: To evaluate the effects of altitude, venous blood samples from donors
were spiked to four glucose concentrations (72, 133, 232, and 375 mg/dL) and tested in
an altitude chamber set to simulate atmospheric conditions at sea level and10,000 feet.
Additionally, one lot of glucose strips was used with 5 meters using blood that covered a
glucose range of 43-548 mg/dL. Each venous blood sample was also tested by the YSI
2300 analyzer. The meter readings obtained were compared to the YSI method and the
percent bias against the YSI results was within ± 10%. Based on the data, the sponsor
claims that the Gmate™ VOICE BGMS can be used at altitudes up to 10,000 feet.
7. Hematocrit Study: The sponsor performed a study to evaluate potential interference from
hematocrit using five different hematocrit (Hct) levels (20, 30, 40, 50, and 60%) across
the glucose measuring range. At each hematocrit level, 5 blood samples at glucose
concentration of 50, 100, 150, 230, and 330 mg/dL were tested against the YSI method.
Each sample was tested on ten meters using one lot of test strips and the values were
compared to the YSI method and the nominal hematocrit level (40%). All individual test
results met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria.
8. Sample Volume Study: A sample volume study was performed to verify the test strip
minimum sample volume requirement and the test strip fill error requirement established
for the Gmate™ VOICE BGMS. Venous blood from donors was collected into EDTA
anticoagulant tubes. The glucose level was adjusted to 40, 70, 125, 250, and 450 mg/dL.
Blood at each concentration was applied to strips at four target sample volumes of 1.0,
0.7, 0.5, and 0.3 μL. Protocols and acceptance criteria were provided and found to be
acceptable. The sponsor concluded that sample volume of ≥0.5 μL produced accurate
results and samples <0.5 μL give an error code.
9. Voice Function: The sponsor performed a study to validate the voice function of the
Gmate™ VOICE BGMS. Twenty-two lay users fluent in English were blindfolded and
were asked to interpret the voice prompts and test results. The users indicated that 95% of
17

--- Page 18 ---
the time they were able to clearly understand the voice prompts and test results and that
95.5 % of the time the users indicated that the voice function was satisfactory.
10. EMC Testing: EMC testing was evaluated and certified by IST Co., Ltd. and a
declaration of conformity was issued and attached to the file.
11. Software: The software is used to obtain the blood glucose level from the test strips. It
includes user interfaces and controls in the hardware and has USART interface. The
Sponsor has provided information required for a moderate level of concern instrument,
including a device hazard analysis, description, software design specification document,
software requirements specifications, traceability, validation and verification testing plan,
architecture design, development, and revision level history. There are no unresolved
anomalies and this is release version 1.00.00.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
