I. Device Description:
The ARCHITECT HAVAB-G assay is a two-step immunoassay for the qualitative detection
of IgG anti-HAV in human serum using CMIA technology. The presence or absence of IgG
anti-HAV in the sample is determined by comparing the chemiluminescent signal in the
reaction to the cutoff signal determined from an active ARCHITECT HAVAB-G calibration.
Specimens with signal to cutoff (S/CO) values > 1.00 are considered reactive for IgG anti-
HAV and specimens with S/CO values < 1.00 are considered nonreactive for IgG anti-HAV.

L. Test Principle:
The ARCHITECT HAVAB-G assay is a two-step immunoassay for the qualitative detection
of IgG anti-HAV in human serum using CMIA technology. In the first step, sample, assay
diluent, and hepatitis A virus (human) coated paramagnetic microparticles are combined. IgG
Anti-HAV present in the sample binds to the hepatitis A virus (human) coated microparticles.
After washing, the anti-human IgG acridinium-labeled conjugate that is added in the second
step binds to IgG anti-HAV. Following another wash cycle, pre-trigger and trigger solutions
are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as
relative light units (RLUs). The presence or absence of IgG anti-HAV in the sample is
determined by comparing the chemiluminescent signal in the reaction to the cutoff signal
determined from an ARCHITECT HAVAB-G calibration. Specimens with signal to cutoff
(S/CO) values > 1.00 are considered reactive for IgG anti-HAV and specimens with S/CO
values < 1.00 are considered nonreactive for IgG anti-HAV.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated for 20 days on 4 ARCHITECT instruments (1- i 1000 , 1- i
SR
2000, and 2- i 2000 using two controls and three panel members: ARCHITECT
SR
HAVAB-G Negative Control (NC), ARCHITECT HAVAB-G Positive Control (PC)
with a target S/CO=2.5, high negative (targeted S/CO=0.85), cut-off sample (targeted
S/CO=1.00), and a low positive (targeted S/CO=1.15). Two lots each of reagents,
calibrators, and controls were used. The test panel member sample order was
randomized per run and blinded per operator.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: N/A
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: This method has been standardized against the “Second International
Standard for Anti-Hepatitis A, Immunoglobulin, Human, NIBSC code: 97/646” of the
NIBSC (National Institute for Biological Standards and Control).
Controls: Negative Control: nonreactive human plasma with a target S/CO<0.65.
Positive Control: Reactive human plasma with a target range S/CO of 1.25-3.31.
Calibrators: Calibration of the ARCHITECT i System is performed using one (1)
calibrator. This calibrator is an anti-HAV reactive serum with an antibody
concentration of approximately 50 mIU/mL. The system calculates the cutoff RLU
from the mean chemiluminescent signal of three architect HAVAB-G calibrator
replicates. The acceptability of the calibration is assessed against a parameter. If the
calibration is acceptable, the cutoff RLU is calculated where cutoff RLU=Calibrator
mean RLU x 0.29. The acceptable calibration is stored by the system for use with any
ARCHITECT HAVAB-G reagent kit of that lot. A single sample of each control level
must be tested to evaluate the assay calibration. Once the calibration is accepted and
stored, all subsequent samples may be tested without further calibration unless a
reagent kit with a new lot number is used or the control is out of range.
d. Detection limit: LoD N/A
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity: The following sample types were used for this study: serum from
patients with conditions unrelated to HAV infection, antibodies against
microorganisms, and an HAV nonreactive specimen spiked with HAV IgM. All
samples tested negative by the AxSYM HAVAB 2.0, which measures total HAV
antibody. Cross-reactivity was seen in samples tested by the ARCHITECT HAVAB-
G: 1/19 Anti-E. coli, 2/14 Anti-CMV, 1/3 hemodialysis patient serum, and 1/13
human anti-mouse antibodies as shown in the following table:

*HAV nonreactive specimens spiked with HAV IgM.
Interference: The impact of endogenous interfering substances on the ARCHITECT
HAVAB-G potential interfering substances found in blood was tested in high
negative and low positive samples. Each of these samples was then supplemented
with unconjugated bilirubin (≤ 20 mg/dL), conjugated bilirubin (≤ 20 mg/dL),
hemoglobin (≤ 500 mg/dL), total protein (≤ 12 g/dL), or triglycerides (≤ 3000
mg/dL). The samples were tested with a minimum of 12 replicates using one lot each
of reagents, calibrator, and controls on one instrument. At these concentrations all
showed less than 15% interference (+0.15 S/CO) with the ARCHITECT HAVAB-G
assay.
f. Assay cut-off: The cutoff RLU equation for the ARCHITECT HAVAB-G US assay
was based on the cutoff RLU equation for the ARCHITECT HAVAb-IgG non-US
assay. Of the 1209 specimens from both presumed positive (patients diagnosed with
HAV, HAV vaccine recipients, and intravenous drug users) and presumed negative
populations (random blood donors and random diagnostic patients) that were tested
by both ARCHITECT HAVAb-IgG non-US assay and the AxSYM HAVAB 2.0, 674
samples were actually positive or negative and used for the ROC analysis. The
optimal sensitivity and specificity was achieved when the cut-off was set using a
multiplier of 0.29. The ARCHITECT i System calculates the S/CO result for each
sample where S/CO=Sample RLU/cutoff RLU and the cutoff RLU=Calibrator 1
mean RLU x 0.29.

The device under review is for the detection of IgG antibodies for hepatitis A virus
(HAV). Currently there are no FDA cleared devices that would detect only HAV IgG
antibodies. The cleared devices detect only IgM or both IgM and IgG (total)
antibodies. The following testing algorithm was used as a comparator algorithm for
evaluating the test device performance:

For specimens that had a reference result of “IgM only or IgM/IgG mixture,”
supplemental processing and testing was performed to determine the final HAV IgG
status. The IgG and IgM antibodies were separated from the sample using affinity
chromatography. The Abbott Clinical Chemistry Immunoglobulin G and Clinical
Chemistry Immunoglobulin M assays were utilized to create the IgM and IgG pooled
fractions which were then evaluated with the ARCHITECT HAVAB-G and
ARCHITECT HAVAB-M assays
Clinical Study Cohorts:
A prospective study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the ARCHITECT
HAVAB-G compared to the result of the composite algorithm at 3 clinical centers in
the United States. A total of 775 specimens were obtained from collection centers or
vendors, frozen, and distributed among the 3 clinical centers for comparison
algorithm testing from the following populations: individuals at increased risk
(n=260) and individuals with signs and symptoms (n=515):
Individuals at increased risk of HAV infection 120/127 were positive, 94.49%
agreement (95% confidence interval 88.97% and 97.76%) and 7 were reactive by the
comparator algorithm but negative by the ARCHITECT HAVAB-G assay. 133/133
were negative, 100.0% agreement (95% confidence interval 97.26% and 100.0%)

Prevalence Studies: The ARCHITECT HAVAB-G assay was used to evaluate the
prevalence of HAV IgG antibodies in an apparently healthy population and in
individuals at increased risk for hepatitis A. The prospective study population
consisted of 520 specimens from low prevalence (Milwaukee, WI; Port Jefferson,
NY) and high prevalence (Galveston, TX) areas. The prospective study population
was 300 (57.69%) females and 220 (42.31%) males including 246 (47.50%)
Caucasians, 149 (28.65%) African Americans, 91 (17.50%) Hispanics, 26 (5.00%)
Asians, 3 (0.58%) American Indian/Alaska Natives, 1 (0.19%) Native Hawaiian or
other Pacific Islander, and 3 (0.58%) Others. The prevalence rate for reactive anti-
HAV IgG assay in specimens collected in a low prevalence region was 25.00%, in a

Seroconversion Sensitivity: Ten seroconversion panel sets were obtained: 3 from
patients with naturally occurring HAV infection and 7 from patients immunized with
HAV vaccine. The ARCHITECT HAVAB-G detected reactive samples comparable
to AxSYM HAVAB 2.0 for the 3 naturally occurring HAV infection panels. The
AxSYM HAVAB 2.0 detected reactive samples earlier (as early as day 14) than the
ARCHITECT HAVAB-G (day 60) for the 7 HAV vaccine panels.
Method Comparison on three instruments: The percent agreement and system
differences in S/CO values between the ARCHITECT systems were evaluated by
testing IgG anti-HAV negative and IgG anti-HAV positive specimens using 1 lot each
of ARCHITECT HAVAB-G reagents, calibrator, and controls at each of 3 clinical
testing sites. An aliquot of each specimen was tested on one ARCHITECT i 1000
SR
instrument at each clinical site (3 instruments total). Site 1 also tested the same
aliquot on one ARCHITECT i 2000/i 2000 instrument. The panel of specimens
SR
consisted of 30-40% high negatives, 30-40% low positives, and 30-40% moderate
positive:
Specimen Category S/CO Range
Low and Moderate Negative < 0.50
High Negative > 0.50 – 0.99
Low Positive > 1.00 – 1.99
Moderate Positive > 2.00 – 4.00
High Positive > 4.00
A total of 208 native and prepared specimens were tested at each site: 106 HAV
nonreactive samples (101 native samples and 5 created by negative serum sample
pools) and 102 HAV reactive samples (51 native samples and 51 HAV-reactive
samples diluted with negative serum specimens or negative serum sample pools). The
correlation coefficient and Deming regression along with the corresponding 95%
confidence interval were calculated for the ARCHITECT i 1000 and ARCHITECT

4. Clinical cut-off:
Refer to assay cutoff section above for additional details.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The Abbott ARCHITECT HAVAB-G assay was used to evaluate the prevalence of HAV
IgG antibodies in an apparently healthy population. Specimens were prospectively
collected in a low prevalence region (Milwaukee, WI; Port Jefferson, NY) and a high
prevalence region (Galveston, TX) in the United States. Expected results from low and
high prevalence based on the test device are presented under the prevalence study section.
Prevalence rate for reactive anti-HAV IgG assay in specimens collected in a low
prevalence region was 25.00%, in a high region was 32.69%, and for individuals with
increased risk was 46.15%.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
