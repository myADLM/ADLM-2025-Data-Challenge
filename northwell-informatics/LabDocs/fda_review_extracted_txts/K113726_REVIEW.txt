4. Special instrument requirements:
epoc Blood Analysis System
I. Device Description:
The single use epoc blood test card is comprised of
a) a bar-coded credit-card sized fluidic housing, b) a sample entry port for the
introduction of a blood sample, c) an array of sensors on a sensor module embedded in
the housing and d) an on-board calibration fluid (~115 ul) contained within a sealed
reservoir. The calibration fluid contains the analytes with concentrations in the clinical
decision levels; for creatinine and chloride, the concentration is 1.03 mg/dL and 95 mM
respectively.

--- Page 3 ---
The single use epoc blood test card contains the sensors, reagents, calibration fluids
altogether in an individually packed cartridge to be inserted into the epoc Blood
Analysis instrument for testing. There is no separate calibration step to be performed
by the user.
The epoc Chloride and Creatinine tests are being added as additional sensors to the
existing single use test card that is used with the epoc Blood Analysis System. The epoc
Blood Analysis System with BGE test card was first cleared in k061597, the glucose
and lactate tests were added with clearance of k090109 and k093297 respectively.
The addition of the epoc Chloride and Creatinine tests comprises four changes to
the epoc System:
1. Addition of the new sensors on the test card;
2. Modification of the epoc System software application to accommodate
the new tests;
3. Labeling changes including indications for use.
4. A built-in function to calculate estimated GFR(e-GFR) using the
measured Creatinine value.

* e-GFR reporting is based on the most recent recommendation from National Kidney

limitation in the labeling:
eGFR >60 does not exclude the possibility of mild renal disease. Further laboratory
testing may be necessary to distinguish normal renal function from mild renal disease.

L. Test Principle:
Ion-selective electrode is used for the chloride measurement. Chloride measurement is
based on the potential difference between the electrode pair (sample versus a reference
electrode) follows the modified Nernst equation (Nickolsky equation). The
measurement is performed by a high input impedance operational amplifier in the card
reader connected to each of the membrane coated sensor electrode pairs comprising
sensor electrode and reference electrode. ΔV, the potential difference between sample
and the calibrator is proportional to the concentration difference of chloride in the
sample and calibrator.
The creatinine sensor comprises a three (3) layer enzyme electrode. The main reaction
layer uses the enzymes Creatinine Amidohyrdolase, Creatine Amidinohydrolase and
Sarcosine Oxidase to convert creatinine to hydrogen peroxide; which is subsequently
detected by redox-mediated horseradish-peroxidase (HRP)-catalyzed reduction on a
gold electrode. In the creatinine electrode screening layer, the background creatine is
converted to water and oxygen and the outer diffusion barrier facilitates rapid transport
of oxygen to the oxidase enzyme to assure the sensor response is linear and
proportional to the concentration of creatinine in the test fluid.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity study was performed in-house using lithium heparin whole blood
samples based on theCLSI EP6-A recommendations for evaluation of linearity.
Blood samples with analyte concentrations spanning the entire measuring range
were prepared starting with pooled blood.Contrived samples were used at lower
ends of the measuring ranges. Analyte concentrations were evaluated versus an
in-house FDA-cleared method with traceability to NIST standards. Regression
analysis was performed as per CLSI EP6-A.
The regression analysis of the linearity data is shown below:
Chloride linearity

Creatinine linearity
Test range Slope Intercept R2

Based on the results of the linearity study, the sponsor claimed that the chloride
test has a measuring range of65 to 140 mM (mmol/L) and the creatinine test
has a measuring range of 0.3 to 15 mg/dL.

Creatinine concentration values assigned to the calibrator fluids are traceable to
NIST standard SRM 967. The epoc Creatinine test is calibrated to an IDMS-
traceable whole blood method and reports plasma equivalent concentrations.
Calibrators (calibration fluid) stability:
Calibration fluid stability study protocol and acceptance criteria has been
provided and found to be adequate. The sponsor claimed that the shelf-life of
the test card with the sensor and calibration fluid is 18 months at room
temperature.
d. Detection limit:
The study was performed in-house as per CLSI EP6-A recommendations for
evaluation limits of detection and quantification. Limits of Blank (LoB) and
Detection (LoD) were obtained for both chloride and creatinine. To ensure the
reliability of creatinine measurement at the low end, a Limit of Quantification
(LoQ) study was performed with contrived whole blood samples. LoB was
based on 125 replicates of measurementsfor chloride and 69replicates of
measurements for creatinine. LoD was calculated according to the formula LoB
+ 1.645 SD. For creatinine, LoQ was based on total 240 measurements of 3 low
samples with an inter-assay precision of 15%. The detection limits study results
are summarized below:
Analyte LoB LoD LoQ
Creatinine

Chloride [mM] 55.65 56.74 Not performed
The sponsor claimed that the low end of the reportable range for the epoc
chloride test is 65 mM and the epoc creatinine test is 0.30 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was performed based on the CLSI “Interference Testing
in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline”, CLSI document EP7-A2. The
interference study was performed in-house on the epoc Chloride and Creatinine
sensors. The test sample was spiked by addition of interference substances,
while the control sample was spiked by the addition of the solvent of the
interference substances. Two levels of analyte concentrations were tested with
different levels of interference substances. All samples were tested in replicates
of six. The concentration of interfering substance considered as causing no
clinically significant interference is defined as a bias (difference between the
test and the control sample) of:
≤ 0.2 mg/dL for creatinine concentrations ≤2 mg/dL and ≤7.9% for creatinine

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were performed at a minimum of 3 POC sites by
phlebotomist or similar point of care operators with the predicate devices
(Abbott i-STAT for chloride and Roche Cobas for creatinine). Venous, arterial
and capillary patient samples were compared with a whole blood point-of-care
system. Venous samples were tested at site 1; arterial samples were tested at
sites 2 and 3; capillary samples were tested at sites 2 and 3. The results of the
overall performance of the device at all the sitesare summarized in the table
below:
