H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The eSensor Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) is a qualitative nucleic acid multiplex in vitro
diagnostic test intended for use on the eSensor XT-8 system for the simultaneous detection and
identification of multiple respiratory viral nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS)
obtained from individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of respiratory infection.
The following virus types and subtypes are identified using the eSensor RVP: Influenza A,
Influenza A H1 Seasonal Subtype, Influenza A H3 Seasonal Subtype, Influenza A 2009 H1N1
subtype, Influenza B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus subtype A, Respiratory Syncytial Virus
subtype B, Parainfluenza Virus 1, Parainfluenza Virus 2, Parainfluenza Virus 3, Human
Metapneumovirus, Human Rhinovirus, Adenovirus species B/E, and Adenovirus species C.
The detection and identification of specific viral nucleic acids from individuals exhibiting signs
and symptoms of respiratory infection aids in the diagnosis of respiratory viral infection if used
in conjunction with other clinical and epidemiological information.
Negative results do not preclude respiratory viral infection and should not be used as the sole
basis for diagnosis, treatment or other patient management decisions. Positive results do not
rule out bacterial infection, or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be
the definite cause of disease. The use of additional laboratory testing (e.g. bacterial and viral
culture, immunofluorescence and radiography) and clinical presentation must be taken into
consideration in the final diagnosis of respiratory viral infection.
Performance characteristics for Influenza A were established during the 2010/2011 influenza
season when Influenza A 2009 H1N1 and H3N2 were the predominant Influenza A viruses in

circulation. When other Influenza A viruses emerge, performance characteristics may vary.
If infection with a novel Influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent influenza
viruses and sent to state or local health departments for testing. Viral culture should not be
attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

(EEPROM) that stores information related to the cartridge (e.g., assay identifier, cartridge lot
number, and expiration date).
The eSensor XT-8 Instrument
The eSensor XT-8 is a clinical multiplex instrument that has a modular design consisting of a
base module and one, two, or three cartridge-processing towers containing eight, 16, or 24
cartridge slots, respectively. The cartridge slots operate independently of each other. Any
number of cartridges can be loaded at one time, and the remaining slots are available for use
while the instrument is running. The base module controls each processing tower, provides
power, and stores and analyzes data. The instrument is designed to be operated solely with
the touch screen interface. Entering patient accession numbers and reagent lot numbers can
be performed by the bar code scanner or the touch screen.
Each processing tower consists of eight cartridge modules, each containing a cartridge
connector, a precision-controlled heater, an air pump, and electronics. The air pumps drive
the pump and valve system in the cartridge, eliminating fluid contact between the instrument
and the cartridge. The pneumatic pumping enables recirculation of the hybridization solution
allowing the target DNA and the signal probes to hybridize with the complementary capture
probes on the electrodes. The pump in the cartridge is connected to a pneumatic source from
the eSensor XT- 8 instrument and provides unidirectional pumping of the hybridization
mixture through the channel during hybridization. Using this process to circulate the
hybridization solution minimizes the unstirred boundary layer at the electrode surface and
continuously replenishes the volume above the electrode that has been depleted of
complementary targets and signal probes.
The XT-8 instrument provides electrochemical detection of bound signal probes by ACV and
subsequent data analysis and test report generating functions. All hybridization, ACV
scanning and analysis parameters are defined by a scanning protocol loaded into the XT-8
software, and then specified for use by the EEPROM on each cartridge.

L. Test Principle:
The eSensor RVP is a multiplex microarray-based genotyping test system that accepts a
nasopharyngeal specimen. It is based on the principles of competitive DNA hybridization
using a sandwich assay format, wherein a single stranded target binds concurrently to
sequence-specific solution-phase signal probe and solid-phase electrode-bound capture
probe. The test employs reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification,
exonuclease digestion and hybridization of target DNA/RNA. In the process, the double-
stranded PCR amplicons are digested with exonuclease to generate single stranded DNA
suitable for hybridization. Hybridization occurs in the eSensor XT-8 Cartridge (described
below) where the single-stranded target DNA is mixed with a hybridization solution
containing labeled signal probes.
eSensor technology uses a solid-phase electrochemical method for determining the presence
of one or more of a defined panel of virus target sequences. Purified DNA/RNA is isolated
from the patient specimen and the extracted nucleic acid is reverse transcribed and/or
amplified using virus specific primers with an RT-PCR enzyme mix. The amplified DNA is
converted to single-stranded DNA via exonuclease digestion and is then combined with a
signal buffer containing ferrocene labeled signal probes that are specific for the different
viral targets. The mixture of amplified sample and signal buffer is loaded onto a cartridge

The cartridge is inserted into the XT-8 instrument where the single-stranded targets hybridize
to the complementary sequences of the capture probes and signal probes. The presence of
each target is determined by voltammetry, which generates specific electrical signals from
the ferrocene-labeled signal probe. The eSensor RVP provides a qualitative result, the
presence (Positive) or absence (Target Not Detected) of the viruses contained in the panel,
along with the internal MS2 control, based upon whether the underlying electrical signals are
above or below a pre-defined cut-off signal intensity.
Results are interpreted based on the following tables:

detected)
For Influenza A (no subtype detected)
If the Influenza A assay is positive, but none of the hemagglutinin subtyping assays are
positive, then the interpretation is ‘Indeterminate result between Influenza A subtypes (no
subtype detected)’. This result could occur when the titer of the virus in the specimen is low
and not detected by the subtyping assays. This result could also indicate the presence of a
novel Influenza A strain. In both cases, the sample in question should be retested. If the
retest provides a different result, test the sample a third time to ensure the accuracy of the
result. If the retest provides the same result, then the function of the device should be
verified by testing with appropriate external control materials (known positive samples for
Influenza A H1, Influenza A H3 and Influenza A 2009 H1N1), and a negative control
reaction should also be run to test for PCR-product contamination. If the eSensor RVP
accurately identifies the external and negative controls, contact local or state public health
authorities for confirmatory testing.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability was evaluated using representative cultures for each viral panel member (see
table below) at a concentration of 1x LoD. The study was executed at a single site by a
single operator on a single day. One representative culture was spiked into viral transport
media then extracted using the NucliSENS easyMAG system. A total of 20 extraction
replicates we run per analyte. Viral strains used in the repeatability study are provided

A culture stock of each selected virus was diluted in VTM to construct the positive samples
of the reproducibility study panel. The positive samples of the reproducibility study panel
were prepared so that each viral strain would be tested at two concentrations: a “low
positive” (C concentration, expected to be positive approximately 95% of the time), and a
95
“moderate positive” (3 x LoD, expected to be positive approximately 100% of the time). The
positive samples for a particular virus strain also served as “negative” samples for the other
four virus strains in the reproducibility study panel. All reproducibility study panel samples
were randomized and blinded prior to shipment to the study sites.

An additional reproducibility study was performed to supplement the original study. The
new study was requested to provide at least 90 replicates per analyte per concentration and to
include data for lot to lot variance evaluation. The additional study was performed at three
sites to evaluate the following sources of variation:
· Site instrument to site instrument
· Operator run to operator run
· Extraction to extraction
· Day to day
· Lot to Lot
A schematic of the study design is shown below:

Although the “Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Respiratory Viral Panel
Multiplex Nucleic Acid Assay” indicates that every claimed analyte should be represented by
the reproducibility study samples, the Agencies thinking regarding the reproducibility study
design for multiplexed microbiology device is evolving based on the feedback we obtained
from the FDA public meeting “Advancing Regulatory Science for Highly Multiplexed
Microbiology/MCM Devices held on October 13, 2011.” Instead of including every claimed
analyte in the additional reproducibility study again, testing a representative number of
claimed analytes was assessed to be sufficient in this case. A list of representative analytes
was reviewed prior to initiation of the additional study. The five representative analytes used
in the study are listed below:
Analyte Strain Source
Flu A H3 Aichi/2/68/H3N2 ATCC, VR-547
RSV A A2 ATCC, VR-1540
PIV 3 C243 ATCC, VR-93
hMPV B2 Zeptometrix, 810159CF
ADV B Type 7 ATCC, VR-7
The detailed numerical results from each analyte concentration level were also reported and
the variance calculations, based on the raw data, are presented below for each of the variance
components included in the study.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Assay Controls
Negative Control
A negative control is not included in the eSensor RVP kit but should be included with each
viral nucleic acid isolation run, and with each eSensor RVP run. RNase/DNase-free water
should be used as the control sample (blank transport media may also be used). These
negative controls are to be run through the assay process from viral nucleic acid isolation to
RT-PCR and XT-8 detection. The results are identified as the negative controls on the XT-8
reports and the software will determine whether the negative controls are valid. If a negative
control fails, all results of the samples in the same run are invalid and the samples should be
re-extracted and re-run.
External Controls (Positive Controls for Viral Targets)
External positive controls are not provided in the eSensor RVP kit. However, known strains
of the targeted viruses should be included in routine quality control procedures (“external
controls”). These external controls are viral target positive controls and should be included
with each batch of patient specimens. These controls may be previously characterized
positive samples or obtained commercially. External controls should be prepared and tested
in the same manner as patient samples. Results from external controls should be examined
before the results from the patient samples. If an external positive control dose not perform
as expected, all results of the batch of samples are invalid and the samples should be re-run.
Internal Control (IC)
An internal control (Bacteriophage MS2; IC) is supplied. This allows the user to control for
the viral nucleic acid isolation procedure and to check for possible RT-PCR inhibition. IC
must be added to each sample during viral nucleic acid isolation; this includes patient
samples, negative controls, and external viral controls. The XT-8 will analyze samples for
IC signal. Failure to detect IC signal in a sample or a control, in the absence of signal from
any of the RVP analytes, will be identified and the user will be required to retest the sample.
Specific instructions on adding the IC to a sample for extraction are detailed in the “Viral
Nucleic Acid Isolation” section of the product package insert.
Reagent Kit Stability
An analytical study was performed to establish stability of the eSensor RVP assay
components. Functional performance of RVP reagents were evaluated with three stability
test panels (IVT-1, IVT-2, IVT-3) composed of in vitro transcripts. Each stability test panel
consisted of a unique combination of claimed viruses, so that the three stability test panels
covered all the claimed viruses. All viruses in a particular stability test panel were tested at
least once during each stability study. Virus targets were present at a concentration of 2.0 x
104 copies/µl. Since each viral target has a unique LoD concentration, a concentration of 2.0
24

--- Page 25 ---
x 104 copies/ul represents a range of 10x to 1 x 107x LoD.

Kits were stored according to the package insert (10-25°C) for up to 6 months. Testing was
performed after time 0, 3 and 6 months of storage. One test is defined as the extraction of
one sample using the NucliSENS EasyMag kit, amplification and analysis on the eSensor. A
total of 16 tests were performed per time point and all three sets IVT panels were tested
along with a negative control at each time point. A successful time point was determined as
a statistically equivalent number of correct calls between the time point tested and the data
from time 0. The Fisher’s exact test for independence was used to determine statistical
equivalence.
Shelf life was determined by acceptable performance at the last time point tested.
Acceptable performance was defined as no statistical difference in correct call rates between
the particular time point data and the data at time zero. Final results for the reagent stability
studies are shown below.

A statistical analysis of the data was performed using the Fisher’s exact test method. There
were no statistically significant (p > 0.05) difference in the call rates up to time point T2.
These data are acceptable to support reagent kit stability claims as published in the product

After the specified storage time, aliquots were removed from storage, exonuclease digested
and mixed with hybridization buffer prior to RVP cartridge detection. A summary of the
performance at three time points using a -15 to -30 °C storage condition are shown below:
The no call results at the 5 week time point were attributed to an electrical problem with the
RVP cartridge/XT-8 interface. The electrical failures are not reagent or amplicon related.
A summary of the performance at three time points using a 2-8 °C storage condition are
shown below:

--- Page 29 ---
The time points tested exhibited no statistically significant difference in the positive detection
rate. These data are acceptable to support amplicon stability claims as published in the
product labeling. The product labeling states:
…store the amplified samples refrigerated at 2-8 °C for up
to 1 week or frozen at -15 to -30 °C for up to one month
before processing.
Single Stranded amplicon Stability
An analytical study was performed to establish performance for assay intermediates after
storage. Functional performance was evaluated with three stability test panels (IVT-1, IVT-
2, IVT-3) of in vitro transcripts. Each stability test panel consisted of a unique combination
of claimed viruses, so that the three stability test panels covered all the claimed viruses. All
viruses in a particular stability test panel were tested at least once during each stability study.
Virus targets were present at a concentration of 2.0 x 104 copies/µl. Since each viral target
has a unique LoD concentration, a concentration of 2.0 x 104 copies/ul represents a range of
10x to 1 x 107x LoD of an amplicon. Three sets of IVT viral panels were used which
covered all analytes in the RVP (same sets as presented above). Once amplification and
exonuclease digestion were complete, all replicates from the same sample set were pooled
and labeled. Aliquots from each RVP amplicon set were removed and stored according to
the test plan in the figure below. The remaining volume was used for testing the T0 time
point. Final time point performance will be considered acceptable is the number of correctly
called samples is statistically equivalent to the T0 time point.
After amplification and exonuclease cleavage, all replicates of the same sample sets were
pooled and labeled. Aliquots from each RVP amplicon set were removed and stored
according to the test plan in the figure below. The remaining volume was used for testing the
T0 time point. A schematic of the test plan is shown below.

After the specified storage time, aliquots were removed from storage mixed with
hybridization buffer prior to RVP cartridge detection. Performance was tested at three time
points using two different storage conditions ( -15 to -30 °C and 2 to 8°C) are shown below.
The overall detection rate for exonuclease cleaved amplicons stored at 2-8°C is shown
below:
No calls were a result of a software error and an electrical connection problem between the
RVP cartridge and the XT-8 instrument. These failures were non-reagent or amplicon
related.

before processing.
Open pouch stability
An analytical study was performed to establish performance of cartridges in previously
opened storage pouches. Functional performance was evaluated with three stability test
panels (IVT-1, IVT-2, IVT-3) of in vitro transcripts. Each stability test panel consisted of a
unique combination of claimed viruses, so that the three stability test panels covered all the

At time T0 all RVP cartridges were opened. All cartridges except those designated for T0
testing were stored in a re-sealable plastic bag and placed in controlled incubators for the
scheduled storage time. After storage, cartridges were used to analyze test panels according
to product labeling instructions. Final time point performance will be considered acceptable
is the number of correctly called samples is statistically equivalent to the T0 time point. A
schematic of the storage conditions and test time points is shown below:

A total of 100 tests were run for each time point and a summary of the results is shown
below:
No call results were due to hardware/software problems include electrical contacts issues
between the reader and the cartridge and software curve fitting errors.
The “no call” results during week 9 of testing were followed up and further test results
pointed to hardware/software problems but the results were not conclusive.
The time points tested exhibited no statistically significant difference in the positive detection

rate. These data are acceptable to support open package stability claims (at ambient storage
conditions) as published in the product labeling. The product labeling states:
Cartridges must be used within 4 weeks of opening the
pouch.
Extracted and Non-extracted Sample Storage and Freeze Thaw Stability
An analytical study was conducted to demonstrate that freezing samples does not affect the
accuracy of test results compared to freshly collected specimens or freshly prepared samples.
Fourteen viral targets were selected for the sample stability portion of the study, each
positive for one viral target. All viral reference strains for this study were acquired from
commercial sources and grown and titered prior to being used in the study. The viral strains
used in this study are shown below:
RVP Target Strain

Influenza A H3 H3N2 ATCC VR-547
Influenza A 2009 H1N1 NY/2009
Influenza B Florida/02/06
RSV A A2
RSV B 9320
PIV 1 C35
PIV 2 Greer
PIV 3 C 243
Metapneumovirus B2
Rhinovirus 3
Adenovirus B Type 7
Adenovirus C Type 1
Adenovirus E Type 4
Fourteen samples each containing a unique viral strain at 3x LoD were prepared in negative
patient nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples. Internal control was added to all samples per
the product labeling prior to extraction. Prior to the initiation of the study an aliquot of each
sample was extracted and used in the RNA/DNA stability portion of the study.
An outline of the study design is shown below:

Non-extracted Sample Stability
For each positive sample a total of 5 aliquots were prepared and labeled with the appropriate
storage conditions. At each time point for each storage condition, a total of 15 extractions
were performed. The 9 day and 5 week storage time points were tested at 2 temperatures
according to the schematic above.

Extracted Sample Stability
A test of the stability of extracted nucleic acid was run in parallel with the sample stability
testing employing the same storage and testing conditions. Each target dilution was extracted
6 times at time 0 (T0) to generate sets of RNA/DNA used to establish extracted stability
performance. At the start of the study (T0 time point) these sample extracts were then stored
at the specified conditions and tested according to the study schematic at the beginning of
this section.
Overall detection results for extracted samples after 9 days of storage at 2-8°C.
All no calls and miscalls were due to signals below the threshold of <3 nA (false negative) no

hardware failure was reported.
Overall detection results for extracted samples after 9 days of storage at 2-8°C.
The single no call result was due to signal below the threshold of <3 nA (false negative) no
hardware failure was reported.
The time points tested exhibited no statistically significant difference in the positive detection
rate. These data are acceptable to support extracted and unextracted sample stability claims
as published in the product labeling. Product labeling states:
Transport and Storage- Clinical specimens can be stored
between 2 ˚C and 8 ˚C for up to 7 days after collection in
viral transport media. Specimens can also be stored at <-
15 °C for up to 1 month prior to extraction and undergo up
to two freeze/thaw cycles.
Note: Purified nucleic acids have been validated for
storage between 2 ˚C and 8 ˚C for up to 7 days, at <-15 °C
for up to 1 month, and can undergo up to two freeze/thaw
cycles.
Reagent Kit Freeze Thaw (FT) Stability
An analytical study was performed to determine the stability of the RT-PCR and detection
reagents used in the eSensor RVP when subjected to storage and freeze/thaw (FT) cycles.
Reagents were evaluated for functional performance after 4 and 6 freeze thaw cycles at 4 and
6 weeks. The same set of IVT mixes (IVT1-3) were used in this study and have been
previously described above. At each time point and freeze/thaw cycle, samples were spiked
37

--- Page 38 ---
with internal control, extracted and amplified then analyzed using the eSensor RVP. An
outline of the time points and freeze thaw cycles is shown in the schematic below:
Two reagent packs designated for FT4 and FT6 were opened at the beginning of the study
and underwent three and five FT cycles respectively prior to the final thaw at the time of
testing. For each FT cycle all reagents (except the RVP enzyme mix) were thawed at 37°C
for 15-20 minutes before use or before the next FT cycle. The RVP enzyme mix was thawed
on wet ice between FT cycles. A total of 16 reactions per time point plus one negative
control were prepared. Final time point performance was considered acceptable if the
numbers of correctly called samples were statistically equivalent for each tested condition.
Overall detection results for IVT mixes tested with reagent kits upon opening (FT0) and
stored at 2 test conditions (FT4: 4 weeks of storage at -15°C to -30°C and 3 FT cycles and
FT6: 6 weeks of storage at -15°C to -30°C and 5 FT cycles ) as shown below:
Miscalls were attributed to electrical connection problems between the eSensor cartridge and
the XT-8 instrument. Miscalls for the MS2 samples (negative controls) were attributed to
carry-over contamination.
The time points tested exhibited no statistically significant difference in the positive detection
rate. These data are acceptable to support reagent kit freeze thaw stability claims as
published in the product labeling. The product labeling states:
38

§Freeze remaining reagents immediately after use.
§Store frozen reagents in a non-frost-free freezer (-15 to -30 °C).
§Reagents may be frozen and thawed up to 5 times.
d. Detection limit:
A range finding study was executed initially to estimate the LoD of each claimed virus using
pooled negative NPS specimens in viral transport media as the sample matrix. Re-grown and
quantified reference strains of one representative strain for each claimed virus was tested in
the study. Each virus strain was diluted in log intervals into transport media (a swab was not
used to transfer the virus strain into transport media). Three replicates of each virus strain
were tested per concentration starting from nucleic acid extraction. The LoD was chosen as
the lowest concentration of each virus that generated a positive result by the eSensor RVP
assay for all three replicates. The initial estimates of LoD are shown below:
The above estimated LoD concentrations were further tested to verify the LoD estimates
from the previous range finding study in a LoD confirmation study. The LoD confirmation
study tested 20 replicates of each virus strain at the estimated LoD concentrations. The LoD
is confirmed if greater than or equal to 95% detection rate is achieved (i.e., at least 19/20
replicates test positive). Results from the first LoD confirmation study are shown below:
39

--- Page 40 ---
During the first confirmation study it was observed that five virus strains (PIV 1, PIV 2,
ADV C, ADV E and Flu A 2009 H1N1) had detection rates below the target of 95%. A
second LoD confirmation study was conducted testing 20 additional extraction replicates at
the confirmed LoD concentrations for all the virus strains from the first study except for the
five virus strains that had below 95% detection rates. The concentration of these five virus
strains were increased (a lower dilution of the same stock) and tested in the second LoD
confirmation study. The results of the second LoD confirmation study are shown below:
40

--- Page 41 ---
Based on the combined results from the two confirmation studies, Flu B was retested at an
increased concentration of 3.16x10-1 TCID /mL and the Flu B LoD was confirmed in a third
50
separate study.
A summary of the final LoD claims are listed below:

e. Analytical reactivity:
An analytical reactivity (inclusivity) study was performed to determine whether the
eSensor RVP is able to detect a variety of strains (inclusivity panel) that represent the
temporal and geographic diversity of each of the RVP targeted viruses. This study
expanded upon the limit of detection studies by determining whether different strains of
the same virus can be detected at or close to the established LoD concentrations.
This study involved inclusivity test panels of diverse virus strains spiked into simulated NPS
samples. All virus identities were confirmed prior to the study. All virus titers were
confirmed except for three HRV strains where extracted RNA samples provided by Biota,
Inc. were tested directly in the eSensor RVP. A negative assay control was included with
each eSensor RVP extraction run.
Inclusivity virus strains were initially tested near the limit of detection (3x LoD) for each
strain as determined in the LoD study. If a specimen containing a particular strain was
positive (detected) at the 3 x LoD level, no further testing of that strain was required. If a
strain was not detected at the 3 x LoD concentration, the strain was retested at a higher
concentration. If necessary, the same approach was followed until a positive result was
obtained or the maximum concentration possible for that strain stock had been tested.
The inclusivity panel represented the evolutionary, temporal, and geographical diversity of
the RVP analytes. For example, the inclusivity panel included 14 different Adenovirus
serotypes, 32 Influenza A strains (subtypes H3, H1 and 2009 H1) isolated from around the
world as early as 1930 and as recent as 2009, and 17 strains of the group that comprised of
Human Rhinovirus A, B and C. However, for some analytes, the inclusivity panel is
restricted to only two strains either because of limited strain diversity, or due to limited
availability.
Each viral strain was diluted in M5 transport medium to a titer of 3x LoD for the
corresponding viral target and extracted in triplicate using the bioMerieux NucliSENS
easyMAG System. Following extraction, each replicate was tested once using the eSensor
RVP. In the case that a viral strain is not detected at 3X LoD, 1000 fold serial dilutions were
made from the viral stock and then each dilution was extracted in triplicate and tested using
the eSensor RVP.

* In silico analysis revealed little homology between the strain sequence and
the H1 primers.
# HRV strain 3, used for LoD determination, had a TCID50/ml of 0.0016.
HRV strains 1A, FO2-2547, 277G were detected at a higher LoD multiple to
the reference strain, respectively with their corresponding TCID50/ml
values of 0.9, 0.2, and 0.2.
**No concentration available since it was an extracted RNA sample.
$ Only one test done for HRV C due to limited sample availability
Two Flu A isolates from non-contemporary strains (Flu A/NWS/33 and Flu A/PR/8/34) were
successfully detected at 3x the LoD. The Flu A/NWS/33 strain subtype was differentiated as
Flu A Hl subtype at 3000 x the LoD. In silico analysis revealed several mismatches of this
strain with the Hl primers which would result in reduced sensitivity for the Hl target. The
subtype for isolate Flu A/PR/8/34 strain was not differentiated at any concentration tested. In
silico analysis revealed low homology between the strain sequence and the H1 primers.
Flu A/lowa/15/30 strain was detected as FluA only at 3x the LoD; Flu A 2009 H1N1 subtype
was detected at 1000x LoD. In silico analysis revealed several mismatches of this strain with
the 2009 H1N1 primers which would result in reduced sensitivity for the 2009 H1N1 target.
Rhinovirus strains 1A, F02-2547, 277G were detected at 450X, 89X, and 100X the LoD,
respectively with their corresponding TCID50/ml values of 0.9, 0.2, and 0.2. The HRV
strain 3, which was used for the LoD determination, had a TCIDSO/ml of 0.0016. The
detection levels for HRV reactivity strains were determined relative to this value as described
below.
Adenovirus C types 2, 5, and 6 were detected at 6x the LoD. All three strains have a single
mismatch with ADVC type 1 capture probe and ADVC type 6 has an additional mismatch
with the signal probe which would result in reduced sensitivity for these strains. One
mismatch was observed between the three target strains and the ADV C capture probe.
In addition to laboratory testing, bioinformatics resources were also used to predict reactivity
of additional species, strains and serotypes with the eSensor RVP system. Simulated
reactivity was based on the number and location of mismatches between the target sequence
and the assay primer(s).
f. Analytical specificity and cross-reactivity:
An analytical specificity study was carried out to assess the potential for false positive results
due to cross-reactivity between eSensor RVP assay targets and other RVP or non-RVP
organisms.
Cross-Reactivity Evaluation for Viruses Detected by the eSensor RVP
Cross-reactivity of each viral target (14 viral targets) was evaluated at high concentrations
with the eSensor RVP by making three serial dilutions of viral reference strains with viral
45

transport media (Remel M5) at 10,000x, 1000x and 100x the LoD. The titer of each virus
dilution and corresponding LoD values were determined and provided in the table below.
Cross-reactivity was not observed with any of the RVP viral targets at the concentrations
tested. The table below summarizes the cross-reactivity results:

Cross-Reactivity with Other Respiratory Viruses Not Targeted by the eSensor RVP
Cross-reactivity with 5 respiratory viruses known to circulate with low frequency in the
general population was assessed. All viral strains were diluted in M5 transport media to a
titer of 105 pfu/mL (except Echovirus 30 which was tested at 9.89 x 104 pfu/ml) and
extracted using the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG extraction method in triplicate.
Following extraction, each replicate was tested once in the RVP assay.

Cross-Reactivity with 17 additional viruses that are not targets of the eSensor RVP were also
assessed. All viral strains were diluted in M5 transport media to a titer of 105 pfu/mL and
extracted using the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG extraction method in triplicate
reactions prior to detection using the eSensor RVP cartridge.

*ADV C cross-reactive signal was also obtained from Adenovirus 9 (D) and
Adenovirus 41 (F) when it was diluted 1000 folds from the initial testing
concentration. Due to the genetic similarity between Adenovirus C, D, and F, the
eSensor RVP cannot reliably differentiate them. A positive eSensor RVP
Adenovirus specie C result should be followed-up using an alternative method (e.g.,
sequence analysis) if definitive Adenovirus speciation is needed.
**Due to the genetic similarity between human rhinovirus and poliovirus, the eSensor
RVP cannot reliably differentiate them. If a polio infection is suspected, a positive
eSensor RVP human rhinovirus (HRV) result should be confirmed using an alternate
method (e.g., cell culture).

#Quantification of the viral RNA contained in the Herpesvirus-3 (Varicella Zoster Virus)
sample was performed using real-time RT-PCR and provided in copies/mL
Systematic false positives observed during the cross-reactivity study will be communicated
to the user by the following three statements in the product labeling:
Due to the genetic similarity between Adenovirus species C, D
and F, and between Adenovirus species B and E, the eSensor
RVP cannot reliably differentiate between Adenovirus species
C, D and F, or between Adenovirus species B and E. A
positive eSensor RVP Adenovirus specie C result or a positive
Adenovirus species B/E result should be followed-up using an
alternative method (e.g., sequence analysis) if definitive
Adenovirus speciation is needed.
Due to the genetic similarity between human rhinovirus and
poliovirus, the eSensor RVP cannot reliably differentiate them.
If a polio infection is suspected, a positive eSensor RVP human
rhinovirus (HRV) result should be confirmed using an alternate
method (e.g., cell culture).
Due to the genetic similarity between Adenovirus species C, D
(serotype 9) and F (serotype 41), the eSensor RVP cannot
reliably differentiate between Adenovirus species C, D
(serotype 9) and F (serotype 41). A positive eSensor RVP
Adenovirus species C result should be followed-up using an
alternative method (e.g., sequence analysis) if definitive
Adenovirus speciation between species C, D (serotype 9) and F
(serotype 41) is needed.
Cross-Reactivity with Bacteria and Fungus
The non-RVP target exclusivity panel consisted of 32 bacteria, 25 viruses, and 2 fungi
(Candida albicans and Candida glabrata). The organisms included in the non-RVP
exclusivity panel were selected either because they are related to RVP target organisms, are
clinically relevant (colonize the upper respiratory tract or cause respiratory symptoms), are
common skin flora or laboratory contaminants, or are microorganisms with a high prevalence
of infection (Herpes Simplex virus, etc.).
Bacterial and fungal strains tested for cross-reactivity with the eSensor RVP were diluted in
viral transport media to a titer of at least 106 CFU/mL. Nucleic acids of these organisms,
listed below, were extracted in triplicate with the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG system.
Following extraction, each replicate was tested once using the eSensor RVP. A “not
detected” result indicates all three replicates yielded the same result.

g. Assay cut-off:
The eSensor RVP provides a qualitative result detecting the presence (Positive) or absence
(Target Not Detected) of the viruses contained in the panel, along with the internal MS2
control, based upon underlying target signals and appropriate signal boundaries. Signals are
generated from an electrode and are analyzed by electrochemical voltammetry with the units
of nanoamperes (nA). Boundary settings were based upon the negative data as a reference
point for viral target cutoffs and the internal control (MS2) data as a reference point for the
control cutoffs. Each viral target can have signal from either of two measuring electrodes. If
the target signal on at least one of the two measuring electrodes is greater than the assay cut-
off level, then that target is considered positive.
To establish the cut-off values for the eSensor RVP targets, blank negative samples
consisting of three different viral transport media (M4, M5, and UTM) were spiked with
MS2 internal control and then extracted 24 times for each transport media, resulting in a total
of 72 tests. The signals obtained from these blank negatives were then combined with results
from negative electrodes of samples used in a comparator study during assay development.
Negative electrode data from the comparator study were obtained from the negative
electrodes of samples which were positive for another viral target. The number of data points
obtained from this analysis varied between targets due to the differing number of samples
which were positive for each viral target. The total data set included between 419 and 585
observations for each target. The mean and standard deviation were calculated for each
target, and a cut-off value of 3 nA was established for all viral targets. This level was chosen
to be the largest value after applying the formula [Signal Cut-off = Mean (Target Signal from
Negative sample) + 5* Observed Std Dev (Target Signal)] was 3.02 nA (RSV A analyte).

For the MS2 control, the cut-off value was determined by analyzing the signals on MS2
electrodes from 68 samples which were tested with no MS2 and the 72 samples from the
three transport media (MS2 positive) listed above. After applying the formula [Signal Cut-
off = Mean (MS2 Signal from Negative sample) + 5* Observed Std Dev (MS2 Signal)] a 1
nA boundary was then established.

To verify the established cut-off values, signals from 200 archived patient samples positive
by either DFA or RT-PCR were compared against the 3 nA cut-off for each viral target. Out
of the 200 confirmed positive samples, 191 generated signals above 5 nA; the remaining 9
positives generated signals less than 1.5 nA. Therefore, an assay cut-off at 3 nA for the viral
targets was chosen to maximize assay sensitivity and specificity. For the MS2 control, the 1
nA boundary was compared against MS2 signals from 200 archived patient samples, a 1 nA
cut-off was chosen based on this data set.
h. Interfering substances
Potentially interfering substances were selected based on the fact that they could pre-exist in
the specimen (e.g. blood, nasal secretions or mucus, and nasal and throat medications used
to relieve congestion, nasal dryness, irritation, or asthma and allergy symptoms) as well as
those that could be introduced during specimen collection and preparation. Each potentially
interfering substance was tested individually with the exception of Luffa opperculata,
Galphimia glauca, Histaminum hydrochloricum, and Sulfur, which were tested together as
Zicam® Allergy Relief Nasal spray and Oxymetazoline and Menthol, which were tested
together as Afrin® No Drip Severe Congestion nasal spray, thereby bringing the total to 21
potentially interfering test combinations. Viral samples representative of the 14 viral targets
on the eSensor RVP were obtained from commercially available cultured cell lines as
indicated in Table 31. Seven viral mixes were made, each containing unique viral targets.
Viral mixes were added to each potentially interfering substance resulting in a final testing
concentration of 3X LoD for each analyte. Each was extracted in triplicate with each extract
tested once with the eSensor RVP. Twenty-one (21) combinations of 24 potentially
interfering substances were tested in this study. Additionally, nine potentially interfering

Raw data from the interfering microorganisms study was compared with data from the
control runs (VTM only) to generate a table of percent interference for each microorganism
and analyte combination. Percent interference is calculated by dividing the mean nA signal
of samples with interfering substance by mean nA signal of control samples without
interfering substance x 100. The results of the percent interference calculations are
summarized below:

The effect of interfering substances has only been evaluated
for those listed in the labeling. Interference by substances
other than those described in the “Interference” section
below can lead to erroneous results.
Recent administration of a live intranasal influenza virus
vaccine may cause false positive results for Influenza A,
H1, H3, 2009 H1N1, and/or Influenza B.
i. Carryover contamination
The carryover/cross-contamination study challenged the extraction, RT-PCR, and detection
portions of the assay within and between runs and operators tested over the course of five
testing days. A representative strain of Parainfluenza Virus 3 was obtained as a
commercially available cultured cell line. Positive Parainfluenza Virus 3 samples were
prepared at a concentration of 1.00 x 105 TCID /mL (3559x LoD) while negative samples
50
were un-inoculated Remel M5 transport media. All samples were extracted using the
bioMérieux easyMAG System. Five sets of alternating high concentration positive and
negative samples were extracted and tested in a checkerboard pattern. Each set of samples
contained 24 tests (12 positive and 12 negative). Total number of tests for the duration of the
study was 120 samples (60 positive and 60 negative).
No carryover/cross-contamination was observed in the eSensor RVP, as 100% of the PIV 3
negative samples were reported as ‘Target Not Detected’.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
N/A
b.Matrix comparison:
All analytical studies were performed using viral targets diluted in transport media. A
bridging study was conducted to determine the effects of natural clinical matrix (NCM) on
assay performance. Excess sample from the clinical study which tested negative for all
panel members by the eSensor RVP constituted the NCM in this study. The bridging study
compared assay performance of representative viral targets diluted in negative natural
clinical matrix (NCM) compared to targets diluted in simulated matrix (SM). Panel
members were tested by the eSensor RVP at 3x LoD in NCM and SM.
Positive rate for each target in the natural matrix is the same as the positive rate for the
corresponding target in the simulated matrix control,

An analysis of the raw data reveals that the p-values for the PIV 3, Flu A, ADV B and Flu A
H3 datasets are not statistically different (p > 0.05). The hMPV and RSV A datasets are
statistically different (p < 0.05) however there is no clinically significance difference (100%
agreement of positive calls).
3. Clinical Studies:
Prospective Clinical Study
The study was designed to collect and test prospective nasopharyngeal samples from
individuals representing the intended use population. The study was performed in two arms
at a total of 3 external clinical study sites representing a geographic diversity within the
United States. All clinical specimens in the prospective clinical study were nasopharyngeal
(NP) swab specimens, prospectively collected and tested during the 2010/11 influenza season
at three North American clinical laboratories. Clinical laboratories were located in
Cleveland, Ohio; Providence, RI; and Albuquerque, NM. Demographic details for patient
population are summarized in the table below. Study sites enrolled subjects from diverse
demographic groups; about 40% of the specimens were obtained from patients enrolled at a
hospital. The remaining specimens were collected from outpatients and patients in an
emergency department.
A total of 1182 patient samples were collected prospectively across the three clinical sites
from January 2011 until May 2011. Out of these patient samples, 1037 were evaluable. A
total of 145 samples were excluded for the following reasons: samples not tested within 5
days of specimen collection (72/145), operator and/or easyMAG mechanical errors (62/145),
samples not retested (11/145). Of the evaluable prospective clinical specimens, 93%
(963/1037) yielded valid results on the first attempt. Invalid results or no results were
obtained for the remaining 74 specimens (45 of which generated results on the first run, but
required retesting due to a negative control failure caused by operator error). Data generated
from the retests was used in the final analysis. All 74 specimens yielded valid results after a
single retest when tested according the retest recommendations.
Out of the 1037 samples collected, an even split of patients were male and female.
Approximately one quarter of the samples came from children under the age of 1; patients
aged 21-65 contributed the largest share of the samples. A summary of the patient
demographics is shown below:

The performance of the RVP assay was compared to the established gold standard reference
method of viral culture for most viral targets. For respiratory viruses in which culture was
not available, a composite (multi-test) reference method (a predetermined algorithm that
combined the results of a few tests) was used as the comparator method. Composite methods
were designed to target a different genomic region for each viral target than the one used by
the RVP assay. The comparator methods were analytically validated prior to use in this
study. As seen in the table below, viral culture followed by DFA identification testing was
used as the comparator method for Influenza A, Influenza B, RSV, Parainfluenza Viruses
(PIV1, PIV2, PIV3), and adenovirus. Since viral culture cannot determine the subtype for
influenza A, RSVs, and adenoviruses, these viruses were subtyped by an independently
developed qRT-PCR assay or qPCR assay followed by bidirectional sequencing to determine
the subtypes (Influenza A H1, Influenza A H3, Influenza A 2009 H1N1, RSVA, RSVB,
ADVB/E and ADVC). All molecular comparator and subtyping testing was performed on
extracted nucleic acids. All clinical samples, regardless of the RVP or culture/DFA result,
were sent for HMPV and HRV testing with two validated qRT-PCR assays for each viral
target. If at least one of the assays was positive for the specific target, then the positive
sample was sequenced using target specific primers.
Samples whose RVP result didn’t match the culture/DFA result were sent for discordant
testing. A third party performed DNA sequencing on the extracted nucleic acid samples
supplied by GenMark using primer pairs for the specific viral target being tested. The results
of this discordant testing were used to footnote the sensitivity and specificity tables.
Assays were developed to perform discordant testing for Flu B, PIV1, PIV2, and PIV3.
Samples that required discordant testing for Flu B were tested in the comparator qRT-PCR
assay for Flu B, and any positive samples were then sequenced using a target specific primer
for Flu B. Similarly, any sample that required testing for PIV1, PIV2, or PIV3 were tested in
the corresponding comparator qRT-PCR assay for that specific viral target and any positive
samples were sequenced using a target specific primer for the specific Parainfluenza virus. A
viral target was determined to be present in a specimen only if indicated by sequencing.

1Validated performance of the eSensor RVP assay detecting Influenza A, RSV or ADV
respectively was compared to viral culture followed by fluorescent antibody
identification. “True” Influenza A, RSV or ADV positives respectively, were considered
as any sample that tested positive for Influenza A, RSV or ADV respectively, by viral
culture followed by DFA testing. True positive samples were subtyped using one
analytically validated qRT-PCR assay with bi-directional sequence confirmation. The
comparator assays were designed to amplify a different sequence from that amplified by
the eSensor RVP assay(s). None of the comparator PCR assays overlapped any RVP
amplicon sequence even if the same gene was targeted. “True” Influenza A H1, H3, or
2009 H1N1 positives, respectively, were considered as any sample that tested positive for
Influenza A by viral culture, and had bi-directional sequencing data meeting pre-defined
quality acceptance criteria that matched Influenza A/H1, A/H3, or A/2009 H1 sequences
deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank
database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), respectively, with acceptable E-values. “True” RSV
A or RSV B positives, respectively, were considered as any sample that tested positive
for Influenza A by viral culture, and had bi-directional sequencing data meeting pre-
defined quality acceptance criteria that matched RSV A or RSV B sequences deposited in
the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank database
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), respectively, with acceptable E-values. “True” ADV C or
ADV B/E positives, respectively, were considered as any sample that tested positive for
Influenza A by viral culture, and had bi-directional sequencing data meeting pre-defined
quality acceptance criteria that matched ADV C or ADV B/E sequences deposited in the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank database
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), respectively, with acceptable E-values.

Parainfluenza Virus 1, Parainfluenza Virus 2 or Parainfluenza Virus 3 positives,
respectively, were considered as any sample that tested positive for Influenza B,
Parainfluenza Virus 1, Parainfluenza Virus 2, or Parainfluenza Virus 3, respectively, by
viral culture followed by DFA testing.
3Performance of the eSensor RVP assay detecting Human Rhinovirus or Human
Metapneumovirus, respectively, was compared to a predetermined algorithm that used
composite comparator methods. The methods consist of two analytically validated PCR
assays followed by bi-directional sequencing. “True” Human Rhinovirus or Human
Metapneumovirus positives, respectively, were considered as any sample that had bi-
directional sequencing data meeting pre-defined quality acceptance criteria that matched
Human Rhinovirus or Human Metapneumovirus sequences deposited in the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov), respectively, with acceptable E-values.
Depending on the comparator method used for a particular virus, performance is described
as sensitivity/specificity or Positive Percent Agreement (PPA)/Negative Percent Agreement
(NPA). Sensitivity or positive percent agreement (PPA) was calculated by dividing the
number of true positive (TP) results by the sum of true positive and false negative (FN)
results, while specificity or negative percent agreement (NPV) was calculated by dividing
the number of true negative (TN) results by the sum of true negative and false positive (FP)
results. A TP result was one where the positive RVP result matched the positive
reference/comparator result, while a TN result was one whereby a negative RVP result
matched a negative reference/comparator result. The two-sided 95% confidence interval
was also calculated. The detailed performance results from each viral target are
summarized below.

Mixed Infections
The eSensor RVP system detected a total of 128 mixed infections in the prospective clinical
evaluation (1037 tested and analyzed specimens). This represents 18.4% of the total positive
specimens (128/696). One hundred fourteen (114/128; 89.1%) were double infections,
eleven (11/128; 8.6%) were triple infections, and three (3/128; 2.3%) samples with four or
more RVP analytes were identified. Ninety five of the 128 samples contained one or more
analytes that the reference/comparator method failed to detect.

Retrospective Clinical Study
Banked samples previously characterized as positive for Influenza A H1, Parainfluenza Virus
1, Parainfluenza Virus 2, Adenovirus B/E, and Adenovirus C were used to supplement the
performance studies for these analytes. These frozen banked samples were collected from
various sites across the United States or from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC). Upon arrival at GenMark, banked samples were blinded and intermixed with
negative samples before being sent for testing, which was conducted by multiple sites
involved in the prospective analysis of the patient samples. Testing of the banked samples
was performed identically to prospectively-collected patient specimens. Results from the
banked samples are presented separately from the prospectively collected specimens.
A total of 343 retrospective banked samples were collected for analysis. Out of this sample
set, 11 samples were sent which didn't contain a banked viral target so these eleven samples
were not tested further. Eight additional samples were excluded as they didn't contain a
banked viral target as originally reported by the collection site and confirmed by comparator
testing. Two samples reported errors on targets but were not retested as indicated. One
sample was not sequenced. One sample had an internal control failure but was not retested
as indicated. After these data were excluded, a total of 320 banked samples (including
negative samples) for 5 viral targets were tested and analyzed.
With the exception of Flu A H1 samples, these banked samples were also sent to a third party
lab for comparator testing, and the results from the third party lab testing were compared to
the results obtained by the eSensor RVP. Since the Flu A H1 samples came from the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention and were verified to be Flu A H1, these samples were not
tested further. The individual analyte results are presented below.

N. Instrument Name:
eSensor Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP)
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The eSensor XT-8 is a clinical multiplex instrument that has a modular design consisting of a
base module and one, two, or three cartridge-processing towers containing 8, 16, or 24
cartridge slots, respectively. The cartridge slots operate independently of each other. Any
number of cartridges can be loaded at one time, and the remaining slots are available for use
while the instrument is running.
The base module controls each processing tower, provides power, and stores and analyzes
data. The base module includes the user interface, and a 15 inch portrait-orientation display
and touch panel. The instrument is designed to be operated solely with the touch screen
interface. Entering patient accession numbers and reagent lot codes can be performed by the
bar code scanner, the touch screen, or uploading a text file from a USB memory stick.
Each processing tower consists of eight cartridge modules, each containing a cartridge
connector, a precision-controlled heater, an air pump, and electronics. The air pumps drive
the diaphragm pump and valve system in the cartridge, eliminating fluid contact between the
instrument and the cartridge. The pneumatic pumping enables recirculation of the
hybridization solution allowing the target DNA and the signal probes to hybridize with the
complementary capture probes on the electrodes. The diaphragm pump in the cartridge is
connected to a pneumatic source from the eSensor XT-8 instrument and provides
unidirectional pumping of the hybridization mixture through the microfluidic channel during
hybridization. Using microfluidic technology to circulate the hybridization solution
minimizes the unstirred boundary layer at the electrode surface and continuously replenishes
the volume above the electrode that has been depleted of complementary targets and signal
probes.
The XT-8 instrument provides electrochemical detection of bound signal probes by ACV and
subsequent data analysis and test report generating functions. All hybridization, ACV
scanning and analysis parameters are defined by a scanning protocol loaded into the XT-8
Software, and then specified for use by the EEPROM on each cartridge

Level of Concern:
Moderate
Software Description:
The eSensor XT-8 system software consists of instrument software and assay specific
software called “Assay Analysis Module” or “AAM”. The instrument software consists of:
1) Application Software, which is the user interface; 2) Instrument Firmware; 3) Windows
XP Operating System; 4) Printer Software; and 5) On-line User Manual for the instrument.
The Application software was developed using C# in the Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2.0
development framework. All of the hardware functions of the instrument are controlled by
embedded firmware under the command of the Application Software. The embedded
firmware was developed using the C language with the Greenhills compiler for the CPU
firmware and Texas Instrument Code Composer for the DSP firmware.
The AAM is a software plug-in specifically designed to generate detection, contamination,
and configuration reports for specific Assays. AAM consists of four sub-components: 1)
AAM Instrument Application Interface, 2) AAM Data Analysis Module, 3) AAM Assay
Specific Report Module, and 4) AAM Assay Specific Configuration Files. The AAM
Instrument Application Interface is used to interface the AAM with XT-8 Application
Software. The AAM Data Analysis Module performs signal classification, signal error
detection, and statistics. The AAM Assay Specific Report Module performs genotyping,
while the Configuration Files are used to specify configurable parameters for the assay
specific polymorphisms. Among all the software components, only the AAM Assay Specific
Report Module and the Configuration Files are assay specific to Respiratory Viral Panel Test.
By keeping these assay-specific AAMs separate from the other modules, they are
individually validated and installed on an instrument without having to revalidate the rest of
the software such as Instrument software and two AAM sub-components (i.e., AAM
Instrument Application Interface and AAM Data Analysis Module), which have been cleared
previously by the FDA in K073720 and K090901.
FDA has reviewed the hazard analysis and software documentation for the cleared XT-8
system under 510(k) K073720. The XT-8 Instrument Software (including Application
Software, Instrument Firmware, Window XP OS, Printer Software, and On-line User Manual
for the instrument) and two AAM sub-components (i.e., AAM Instrument Application
Interface and AAM Data Analysis Module) have not been changed in this 510(k). The only
changes are to the two “assay specific” modules, AAM Assay Specific Report Module and
AAM Assay Specific Configuration Files. The validation study results are provided in
Section 7.0. The data provided in Section 7.0 also include a description of software design,
evaluation of the hazard analysis and AAM validation testing.
The XT-8 instrument is only for use with XT-8 test cartridges and is not integrated or
connected with other laboratory systems.
