H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Quidel® Molecular Influenza A + B Assay is a multiplex Real Time RT-PCR
assay for the in vitro qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A and
influenza B viral RNA in nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs from patients with
signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. The test is intended for use as an aid
in the differential diagnosis of influenza A and influenza B viral infections in
humans in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors. The assay
does not detect the presence of influenza C virus.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used
as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other patient management decisions.
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2010 to
2011 influenza season when influenza A/H3 and 2009 H1N1 influenza were the
predominant influenza A viruses in circulation. When other influenza A viruses
are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical
and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities,
specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for
novel virulent Influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for
testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+
facility is available to receive and culture specimens.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use

I. Device Description:
The assay detects influenza A and influenza B viral RNA that has been extracted
from a patient sample using the NucliSENS® easyMAG® automated extraction
platform. A multiplex RT-PCR reaction is carried out under optimized conditions in a
single tube generating amplicons for each of the target viruses present in the sample.
This reaction is performed utilizing the Cepheid SmartCycler® II or the Applied
Biosystems® 7500 Fast Dx platform. Identification of influenza A occurs by the use
of target specific primers and a fluorescent-labeled probe that hybridizes to a
conserved region within the matrix protein gene. Identification of influenza B occurs
by the use of target specific primers and a fluorescent-labeled probe that hybridizes to
a conserved influenza B sequence within the neuraminidase gene.

The following is a summary of the procedure:
1. Sample Collection: Obtain nasal swabs or nasopharyngeal swabs using standard
techniques from symptomatic patients. These specimens are transported, stored,
and processed according to established laboratory procedures.
2. Nucleic Acid Extraction: Extract viral RNA from the specimens with the
NucliSENS easyMAG System following the manufacturer’s instructions and
using the appropriate reagents. Prior to the extraction procedure add 20 µL of the
Process Control (PRC) to each 180 µL aliquot of specimen. The PRC serves to
monitor inhibitors in the extracted specimen, assures that adequate amplification
has taken place and confirms that the nucleic acid extraction was sufficient.
3. Rehydration of Master Mix: Rehydrate the lyophilized Master Mix using the
Rehydration Solution. The Master Mix contains oligonucleotide primers,
fluorophore and quencher-labeled probes targeting highly conserved regions of
the influenza A and influenza B viruses as well as the PRC sequence. The primers
are complementary to highly specific and conserved regions in the genome of
these viruses. The probes are dual labeled with a reporter dye attached to the 5’
end and a quencher attached to the 3’ end.

4. Nucleic Acid Amplification and Detection: Add 15 µL of the rehydrated Master
Mix to each plate well then add 5µL of extracted nucleic acids (specimen with
PRC) to the plate well. Place the reaction tube into the Cepheid SmartCycler® II
or the plate into the ABI 7500 Fast Dx instrument. Once the plate is added to the
instrument, the assay protocol is initiated. This protocol initiates reverse
transcription of the RNA targets generating complementary DNA, and the
subsequent amplification of the target sequences occurs. The Quidel Molecular
Influenza A+B assay is based on TaqMan® chemistry, and uses an enzyme with
reverse transcriptase, DNA polymerase, and 5’-3’ exonuclease activities. During
DNA amplification, this enzyme cleaves the probe bound to the complementary
DNA sequence, separating the quencher dye from the reporter dye. This step
generates an increase in fluorescent signal upon excitation by a light source of the
appropriate wavelength. With each cycle, additional dye molecules are separated
from their quenchers resulting in additional signal. If sufficient fluorescence is
achieved by 45 cycles for the Cepheid SmartCycler® II or 35 cycles for the
Applied Biosystems® 7500 Fast Dx, during the data collection stage of
amplification, the sample is reported as positive for the detected target sequence.

L. Test Principle:
The real-time RT-PCR process simultaneously amplifies and detects nucleic acid
targets in a single closed-tube reaction. Detection of influenza A, B and the Process
Control (PRC) is based on three processes: nucleic acid isolation, reverse
transcription and real time PCR amplification/detection. Human respiratory
specimens (nasal swabs and nasopharyngeal swabs) from symptomatic patients are
processed initially to isolate and purify viral nucleic acid from the cellular specimen
matrix. After initial reverse transcription of RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA),
amplification proceeds during which the probe anneals specifically to a region of the
8

--- Page 9 ---
template between the forward and reverse primers. As primer extension and
amplification occurs, the exonuclease activity of the Taq polymerase cleaves the
probe separating the reporter dye away from the quencher. This generates an increase
in fluorescent signal upon excitation from a light source of appropriate wavelength.
With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved from their respective
probes, yielding increased fluorescence signal. The amount of fluorescence at any
given cycle is dependent on the amount of PCR product (amplicons) present at that
time. Fluorescent intensity is monitored at each PCR cycle by fluorescent detection
modules within the real-time instrument.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the Quidel Molecular Influenza A and B assay was
evaluated at three laboratory sites. The reproducibility panel and controls were
tested at each site by two operators for five days in triplicate (2 operators x 5
days x triplicate testing x 3 sites = 90 results per sample). The panels and
controls were extracted using the bioMérieux easyMAG system and tested on
the Cepheid SmartCycler II.
The reproducibility panel was composed of four simulated samples each for
influenza A and influenza B, made by diluting Influenza A H1N1
A/Mexico/4108/2009 or Influenza B Florida into negative nasal matrix. The
panel included a medium positive (5x LoD) influenza A sample, a low
positive (2x LoD) influenza A sample, a high negative (0.3x LoD) influenza A
sample, and an influenza A negative sample. The panel also included a
medium positive (5x LoD) influenza B sample, a low positive (2x LoD)
influenza B sample, a high negative (0.3x LoD) influenza B sample, and an
influenza B negative sample.

The analytical sensitivity (limit of detection or LoD) of the Quidel Molecular
Influenza A+B assay was determined using quantified (TCID /mL) cultures
50
of three influenza A strains (one H1N1, one 2009H1N1 and one H3N2) and
three influenza B strains, serially diluted in negative nasopharyngeal matrix.
Each dilution was extracted using the NucliSENS easyMAG System in
replicates of 21 per concentration of virus and tested on the Cepheid
Smarcycler® II platform. Analytical sensitivity (LoD) is defined as the lowest
concentration at which at least 95% of all replicates tested positive.

e. Analytical specificity (inclusivity):
The inclusivity of the Quidel Molecular Influenza A+B assay was evaluated
against multiple strains of influenza A and influenza B viruses. The clinical
panel consisted of 10 influenza A subtype H1N1, two influenza A subtype
2009H1N1, eight influenza A subtype H3N2, two influenza A subtype H5N1,
13 Influenza B strains. An additional panel of non-clinical influenza isolates
was also tested. Each panel member was extracted using the NucliSENS
easyMAG instrument and tested in triplicate on the Cepheid SmartCycler II.
The Quidel Molecular Influenza A+B assay detected 100% of the influenza A
(38/38) and influenza B strains (15/15) at 2 to 3x LoD levels including
pandemic and avian influenza A strains, and recent circulating influenza B
strains.

i. Assay cut-off
The “cutoff value” represents the fluorescent intensity signal (reported in
Relative Fluorescent Units) at which a “positive” reaction reaches a relative
fluorescent intensity above the background or baseline of a “negative”
reaction. If a sample exceeds the threshold in a detection channel during PCR,
the sample is considered positive for that channel. If the sample does not
exceed the threshold for a detection channel by the last PCR cycle, the sample
is considered negative for that channel.
The cut-off for the Quidel Molecular Influenza A+B Assay was determined
and confirmed through a phased approach. The preliminary threshold was
established using data obtained from the LoD studies and from the analysis of
a set of clinical specimens. Data from the analysis of multiple replicates near
the LoD of the assay were used to establish the threshold such that sensitivity
was maximized. Similarly, the latest Ct value from the LoD data was used to
set the cut-off. Using the parameters summarized in the table below, a
verification study was performed that confirmed the threshold and cut-off
values.

j. Carry-over Contamination Analysis
An internal study was completed with the Cepheid SmartCycler® II where a
number of PCR reactions were performed in five separate extraction and PCR
runs. Each extraction run had alternating four high positive and four high
negative samples within the same disposable reaction container. Each PCR
run had alternating high positive and negative samples. All the high positive
samples were positive for influenza A and influenza B (100%). All of the
high negative samples were negative for influenza A and influenza B. The
data demonstrates that no carry-over or cross contamination was observed
with the bioMériuex NucliSENS easyMAG automated nucleic acid extraction
instrument and the Cepheid SmartCycler® II instrument.

Performance characteristics of the Quidel Molecular Influenza A+B assay
using the Cepheid SmartCycler® II instrument were established in a
prospective study during the 2010-2011 influenza virus season (January to
March 2011). Samples used for this study were fresh nasal (427) and
nasopharyngeal (352) swab specimens that were collected for routine
influenza testing at thirteen (13) sites across the United States. A single
specimen was collected per patient and tested within 72-hours of collection at
one central location.
A comparator method (a high performance FDA Cleared Influenza A and B
molecular test) was used in the evaluation of the Quidel Molecular Influenza
A+B assay.

negative by sequence analysis for influenza B.
The prospective clinical study had a dual infection rate for Influenza A and
Influenza B of 2.4% (18/753) using the Quidel Molecular Influenza A + B
Assay. Three of these dual infections were concordant with the FDA Cleared
RT-PCR comparator assay. Three of these dual infections were discordant
with the Influenza A results from the FDA Cleared RT-PCR comparator
assay. Twelve (12) of these dual infections were discordant with the Influenza
B results from the FDA Cleared RT-PCR device comparator assay.
b. Retrospective Clinical Studies:
Performance characteristics of the Quidel Molecular Influenza A+B assay
using the Cepheid SmartCycler® II instrument were also evaluated in a
retrospective study of frozen nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected during
the 2010 to 2011 influenza virus season (January to March of 2011) for
routine influenza testing. For this study the comparator method was a high
performance FDA Cleared influenza A and B molecular device.
Three hundred fifty six (356) frozen nasopharyngeal swabs were tested by
both the subject and comparator devices for influenza A and influenza B virus
viral RNA. Two of these specimens were invalid on initial testing with the
subject device (0.6%). Re-testing of the specimens according to the
Interpretation Algorithm described above also yielded invalid results. Two
specimens were invalid on initial and repeat testing (as per the device's PI) on
the comparator device (0.6%). The invalid specimens were removed from
performance analyses. The table below details the results for the remaining
352 specimens.
