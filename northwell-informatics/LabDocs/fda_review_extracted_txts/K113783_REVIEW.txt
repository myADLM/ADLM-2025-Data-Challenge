Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumonia and meningitis)
The VITEK® 2 Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) is intended to be used
with the VITEK® 2 and VITEK® 2 Compact Systems for the automated
quantitative or qualitative susceptibility testing of isolated colonies for the most
clinically significant aerobic gram-negative bacilli, Staphylococcus spp.,
Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, and S. pneumoniae.
3. Special conditions for use statement:
For prescription use only.
The ability of the AST card to detect resistance to penicillin is unknown because
resistant strains (based on the breakpoints for pneumonia) were not available at
the time of comparative testing.
4. Special instrument requirements:
For use with the VITEK® 2 and VITEK® 2 Compact Systems
I. Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is essentially a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated
version of the doubling dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC). Each VITEK 2 AST card contains 64 wells. A control well
which only contains microbiological culture media is resident on all cards. The
remaining wells contain premeasured portions of a specific antibiotic combined with
2

--- Page 3 ---
culture media. The bacterial or yeast isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized
concentration with 0.45 – 0.5% saline before being used to rehydrate the
antimicrobial medium within the card. The VITEK 2 System automatically fills, seals
and places the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual
filling, sealing and loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of
each well in the card over a defined period of time. At the completion of the
incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the
interpretive category result for each antibiotic contained on the card.
The VITEK® 2 AST – GP Penicillin for Streptococcus pneumoniae has the following
concentrations in the card: 0.06, 0.25, 1, 2 and 4 µg/mL (equivalent standard method
concentration by efficacy in μg/mL). The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 card is ≤
0.06 – ≥ 8 μg/mL.
The MIC ranges, interpretive criteria and equivalent concentrations are as follows:

L. Test Principle:
Automated growth based detection using attenuation of light measured by an optical
scanner. The optics used in the systems use visible light to directly measure organism
growth. Transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before
significant growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same
well measure organism growth by how much light is prevented from going through
the well. The VITEK 2 System monitors the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period of time. An interpretive call is made between 4 and 16 hours for a

The VITEK® 2 AST – GP Penicillin for Streptococcus pneumoniae has the following
concentrations in the card: 0.06, 0.25, 1, 2 and 4µg/mL (equivalent standard method
concentration by efficacy in μg/mL). The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 card is ≤
0.06 – ≥ 8 μg/mL.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three external clinical sites. Ten
Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were tested at each site and testing was
performed in triplicate over three days with the VITEK® 2 AST – GP
Penicillin for Streptococcus pneumoniae card. The testing was performed
using both the manual dilution method and the automated dilution mode.
Testing was conducted on the VITEK 2 instrument.
For the sake of reproducibility calculations, off-scale values are handled in
two ways; “best case” and “worst case” scenarios. Best case calculation for
reproducibility assumes the off-scale result is within one well from the mode
MIC value. Worst case calculation for reproducibility assumes the off-scale
result is greater than one well from the mode MIC value.
The overall reproducibility was >95% with +/- one dilution observation for
the VITEK 2 and the VITEK 2 Compact system. Only Manual Dilution
testing was conducted since the VITEK 2 Compact system does not have a
functionality to support automatic dilution to inoculate the card. Results were
as follows:
VITEK System Inoculation Method Best Case Worst Case
VITEK 2 AutoDilution 100% 100%
Manual 97.8% 97.8%
VITEK 2 Compact Manual 100% 100%

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended Streptococcus pneumonia QC organism was tested on
every test occasion with the reference method and the VITEK 2 System.
The reference method QC results were in range every day they were tested.
The VITEK 2 was tested a sufficient number of times to demonstrate that the
system can produce QC results in the recommended range.
Quality Control was performed during the studies using both the auto-dilution
and the manual method of diluting the organisms on the VITEK 2 System.
Results demonstrated that methods were comparable.
Quality Control Results with the VITEK 2 System for Penicillin were as
follows and include data obtained from testing additional challenge isolates:
Concentration Auto Dilution Manual Dilution
Organism (µg/mL) Reference VITEK 2 Reference VITEK 2
Streptococcus 0.06* 1

range: 2*
0.25-1 µg/mL
4*
8*
* VITEK Card Result Range is ≤ 0.06 – ≥ 8.
Quality Control results for the VITEK 2 System using either inoculation
dilution method demonstrated that the VITEK 2 System could produce the
expected quality control results.
A similar QC study was conducted to evaluate the VITEK 2 Compact System.
Results were compared to the expected FDA and CLSI QC results.
Inoculum density control was monitored using the DensiChek2 instrument.
This was standardized weekly with all results recorded and in the expected
range.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Performance was established through a clinical study which was conducted at
three external study sites. A total of 500 clinical isolates were tested by
VITEK® 2 AST – GP Penicillin for Streptococcus pneumoniae with the
VITEK® 2 System. The majority of the isolates were recently isolated from
clinical specimens. Two hundred forty seven of the 500 clinical isolates tested
were stock isolates (49.4%). The total number of viable clinical isolates
evaluated was 485; the no growth rate was 2.4% (15/500). A challenge set
consisting of 50 isolates was also evaluated with VITEK® 2 AST – GP
Penicillin for Streptococcus pneumoniae based on the pneumonia breakpoints.
An additional 87 challenge isolates of S. pneumoniae were tested to further
evaluate performance based on the meningitis breakpoint. Testing of clinical
isolates was performed using the automated method of inoculation and the
challenge organisms were tested with both the manual dilution and automatic
dilution. Each isolate was tested by the VITEK® 2 AST – GP Penicillin for
Streptococcus pneumoniae and the CLSI broth microdilution reference
method. The inoculum was prepared with direct colony suspension. A
comparison was provided to the reference method with the agreement shown
in the following tables.
Because two separate breakpoints exist for penicillin when testing
Streptococcus pneumoniae depending on the infection source, data was
analyzed to evaluate performance based on the pneumonia and meningitis
breakpoints separately as shown in the tables below.

reference method. Category agreement (CA) is when the VITEK 2 panel
result interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result
interpretation. Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the
VITEK 2 and the reference and have on-scale EA.
For the pneumonia breakpoint, 40 (7.5%) minor categorical errors were seen with
one major error. A high agreement was observed with a total EA of 97.6%,
evaluable EA of 95.9% and a CA of 92.3%. Of 535 total isolates of S.
pneumoniae, three isolates were considered resistant based on the penicillin
breakpoint for pneumonia but no very major errors occurred.

For the meningitis breakpoint, a high agreement was observed with a total EA
of 97.9%, evaluable EA of 96.9% and a CA of 96.6%. In absence of an
intermediate breakpoint for meningitis, the results showed 10 (3.1%) major
and 9 (3.0%) very major errors. The major error rate of 3.1% was considered
acceptable because of the high Category and Essential Agreements.
Performance of the VITEK® 2 and the VITEK® 2 Compact was also
evaluated with the same 137 challenge organisms using the manual dilution
method. A comparison to the reference is shown in the following tables:
