H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for Use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Homocysteine Enzymatic Assay is an in vitro test for the quantitative
determination of total L-homocysteine in human serum and plasma on
Roche/Hitachi cobas c systems. The assay can assist in the diagnosis of patients
suspected of having hyperhomocysteinemia or homocystinuria.
The Homocysteine Calibrator Kit is intended for use in the calibration of
quantitative Roche methods on Roche clinical chemistry analyzers as specified in
the value sheets.
The Homocysteine Control Kit is intended for use in quality control by
monitoring accuracy and precision for the quantitative methods as specified in the
value sheets.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
The labeling contains a prominent black-box warning:
Specimens from patients who are on drug therapy involving S-adenosyl-L-
methionine may show falsely elevated levels of homocysteine. Patients who are
taking methotrexate, carbamazepine, phenytoin, nitrous oxide, anticonvulsants and 6-
azuridine triacetate may have elevated levels of homocysteine due to their effect on
the metabolic pathway.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Performance studies were conducted on Roche/Hitachi cobas c501 system
I. Device Description:
The Homocysteine Enzymatic Assay is based on an enzyme cycling assay
principle that assesses the co-substrate conversion product, NAD, which is
measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. The reagent contains three bottles
2

--- Page 3 ---
with the following ingredients:
R1 NADH reagent: S-adenosylmethionine, TCEP, 2-oxoglutarate, NADH
R2 Enzyme reagent: homocysteine S-methyltransferase, glutamate dehydrogenase,
casein (bovine)
R3 Start reagent: adenosine deaminase (bovine), S-adenosyl-homocysteine
hydrolase, casein (bovine).
The Homocysteine Calibrator Kit is a liquid, ready-for-use calibrator based on
human serum. It is a single level calibrator with lot specific values and diluted on
board the analyzer to create a 5-point calibration curve.
The Homocysteine Control Kit consists of two ready-for-use controls based on
human serum. The adjusted concentrations of the control components are in the
low range for Control 1 and in the elevated range for Control 2.
The labeling states that all products prepared from human blood are prepared
exclusively from the blood of donors tested individually and shown to be free from
HbsAg and antibodies to HCV and HIV. The testing methods were FDA approved
or cleared in compliance with the European Directive 98/79/EC, Annex II, List A.

Hcy conversion products of Hcy. In this assay, oxidized Hcy is first reduced to free
Hcy which then reacts with a co-substrate, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), to form
methionine (Met) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), catalyzed by a Hcy S-
methyltransferase. SAH is assessed by coupled enzyme reactions where SAH is
hydrolyzed into adenosine (Ado) and Hcy by SAH hydrolase, and Hcy is cycled into
the Hcy conversion reaction to form a reaction cycle that amplifies the detection
signal. The formed Ado is immediately hydrolyzed into inosine and ammonia which
reacts with glutamate dehydrogenase with concomitant conversions of NADH to
NAD+. The concentration of Hcy in the sample is indirectly proportional to the
amount of NADH converted to NAD+ (ΔA340nm).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within run and between-run precision studies were performed following the
CLSI guideline EP5-A2 for 21 days, two runs per day on the same cobas c
501 analyzer. Two aliquots per each human sera pools (HSP), (2 diluted, 1
native, and 2 spiked) samples and controls together with one reagent lot, one
lot of calibrator were used in the study. The results are shown in the table
below:
Mean Within –Run Between –Run
Value CV CV
Control 1 12.2 μmol/L 1.5% 2.1%
Control 2 39.1 μmol/L 1.8% 2.0%
HSP 1 8.26 μmol/L 2.0% 2.3%
HSP 2 13.1 μmol/L 1.8% 2.1%
HSP 3 30.0 μmol/L 1.4% 1.8%
HSP 4 44.4 μmol/L 2.0% 2.2%
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed in-house using blood samples as per CLSI
EP6-A recommendations for evaluation of linearity. A dilution series
consisting of 11 dilutions was prepared separately using a spiked, high analyte
human serum pool and a high analyte, human plasma pool in parallel to
produce samples with values ranging from 2.78 to 50.03 μmol/L.
Homocysteine levels were measured in triplicate for each sample using cobas
c 501 analyzer, and the recovered median values were compared to the
theoretical values. The linear regression analysis of the study is shown below:

The results fulfilled the specifications for the linearity claims of 3 to 50
µmol/L.
The extended measuring range using automated rerun with dilution was
validated by performing an experiment comparing the instrument auto-rerun
results with a simple manual dilution. The test results showed the difference
between the automated dilution and the manual dilution is within the
acceptance criteria of +/- 10% recovery.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
This method has been standardized against NIST SRM 1955 reference
material. The target values for calibrator and controls are traceable to the
NIST SRM 1955 reference material.
Stability
i) Reagent stability
Shelf (real-time) Stability: 14 months
On-Board stability: 4 weeks after dilution
ii) Calibrator stability
Closed-Vial Stability: 15 months at 2-8 0C
Open-Vial Stability: 2 hours at 15-25 0C or 28 days at 2-8 0C
iii) Controls stability
Open-Vial Stability: 2 hours at 15-25 0C or 28 days at 2-8 0C

5 determinations each on 2 cobas c 501 analyzers, total 6 runs (n=60) over 3
days. Data analysis was based on determination of the 95th percentile of the
60 measured values. LoD was calculated based on LoD=LoB + 1.653 X
SD
total.
The results are LoB: 0.3 µM; LoD: 0.72 µM. The sponsor’s claimed
measuring range is 3 µmol/L to 50 µmol/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing based on CLSI “Interference Testing in Clinical
Chemistry; Approved Guideline”, CLSI document EP7-A2. Significant
interference was considered present by the sponsor if the % recovery
exceeded ±10% of the expected 100% recovery.
i) Exogenous interferences:
Individual drug was added to two separate patient sample pools with low
or high homocysteine concentrations and examined for potential effect on
homocysteine determination by the Homocysteine Enzymatic test system.
No significant interference was found for the following drugs:
Acetylcysteine, Ampicillin-Na, Ascorbic acid, Ca- Dobesilate, Cyclosporine,
Cefoxitin, Heparin, Intralipid, Levodopa, Methyldopa, Metronidazole,
Phenylbutazone, Doxycycline, Acetylsalicylic Acid, Rifampicin,
Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen, Theophylline, Cystathionine, Pyruvate,
Glutathione, S-adenosylmethoinine, H-hydroxylamine HCl and glycerol.
Physiological concentration (Sub-uM range) of S-adenosylhomocysteine
(SAH) have no significant interference on this assay, however, SAH has a
significant positive interference at high pharmacological doses.
Samples containing 3-deazaadenosine should not be used since it is known
to inhibit one of the key enzymes used in the assay.
ii) The effects of endogenous interference on the quantitation of
homocysteine by the Homocysteine Enzymatic test system were
determined on the cobas c 501 analyzer at two Homocysteine levels. The
study showed:
Icterus: No significant interference up to 20 mg/dL unconjugated
Bilirubin.
Hemolysis: No significant interference up to 100 mg/dl hemoglobin
Triglyceride: No significant interference up to 1790 mg/dL triglyceride
iii) Protein interference was investigated using two human serum pools at
homocysteine concentration of 12.6 and 41.3 µmol/L, respectively. Each
pool was used to create a dilution series of 10 test levels of protein
spanning between 13 to 128.9 g/L. The results showed no interference by
total protein up to 128.9 g/L.
