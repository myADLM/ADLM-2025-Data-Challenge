L. Test Principle:
CRP in specimen reacts with goat anti-human C-reactive protein antibody that is coated on
latex to induce agglutination. The concentration of CRP can be determined by measuring
this agglutination as the amount of change in absorbance.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/ Reproducibility: The studies followed CLSI EP5-A2, where three (3)
levels of serum samples were each tested in-house in two runs, twice a day, for
twenty (20) days. Results met the Acceptance criteria for % CV (≤ 10% for CRP up
to 50 mg/L and ≤ 5 % for CRP at or above 50 mg/L).

Precision studies were also performed at three external physician’s office laboratory
(POL) sites where three (3) blinded serum samples with low, middle, and high
concentrations of CRP were assayed six times per day for five days with 3 lots of
reagents. Results met the Acceptance criteria (maximum %CV of 10% for levels of
10 mg/L or greater, and a maximum SD of 1 for levels less than 10 mg/L).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Eleven serial dilutions were prepared using a commercial CRP calibration sample set.
They were tested in duplicate by the Hitachi Clinical analyzer. The percent recovery
was determined by comparing the measured value of CRP to the assigned reference
value. Results met the Acceptance criteria for % recovery (±10%). The CRP assay is
linear between 1 mg/L and 154 mg/L and the claimed measuring range is 1 mg/L to
150 mg/L.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The calibration material is traceable to IRMM Standard Reference
Material ERM-DA472.
Calibrators: The S TEST Reagent Cartridge CRP assay utilizes a predefined lot-
specific calibration curve that is stored in the reagent cartridge barcode.
Cartridge Shelf-life/ Stability: The S TEST reagent cartridge can be stored, unopened,
at 2-8°C for 1 year based on real-time stability testing.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB) was determined by assaying a blank sample twenty (20)
times per day for three days. The LoB value was estimated to be 0.5 mg/L. The limit
of detection (LoD) was determined by assaying five (5) samples with low CRP level
four times per day for three days. The LoD value was calculated as the LoB + 1.645
x SD of the low sample and was found to be 0.7 mg/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed according to EP7-A2 using two serum pools with
CRP concentrations of 12 mg/L and 80 mg/L. Each sample was spiked with six

different levels of interfering substances and tested in replicates of three. For non-
interference to be claimed, the mean results from the spiked samples must be within
10% or 2 mg/L (whichever is greater) of the mean of the neat samples. The data
demonstrated that the CRP test system was not affected by high levels of the
following substances: hemoglobin (up to 1,000 mg/dL), unconjugated bilirubin (up to
50 mg/dL), triglycerides (up to 2,000 mg/dL), and ascorbic acid (up to 50 mg/dL).
Carryover
The potential effect from carryover due to high concentration samples was assessed in
duplicates as follows: a high sample targeted at 120 mg/L and a low sample targeted
at 10 mg/L were assayed in alternate order with three lots of S TEST CRP cartridges
and three analyzers. The data are shown below. The data demonstrate no carryover
effect, as the low sample reported the correct low result (approximately 10 mg/L)
with multiple lots and multiple analyzers.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 88 clinical specimens, spanning the dynamic range, were assayed in
singleton and in a blinded fashion by both the S TEST reagent cartridge C-Reactive
Protein on the Hitachi Clinical Analyzer and the Roche C-Reactive Protein Latex test
on the Roche cobas 8000 system. Linear regression statistics are based on the
balance of the paired results, and the data are as follows:
n r Slope (95% CI) Intercept (95% CI)

Additional method comparison study (POL accuracy) were performed at three
external sites using approximately 55 blinded serum samples with CRP values
ranging from 1 mg/L to 130 mg/L at each site. Linear regression analysis (least
