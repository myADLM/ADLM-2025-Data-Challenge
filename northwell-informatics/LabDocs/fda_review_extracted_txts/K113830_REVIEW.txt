L. Test Principle:
Vantera Clinical Analyzer
The Vantera Clinical Analyzer is a clinical laboratory analyzer that employs nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopic detection to quantify multiple analytes in biological fluid
specimens, specifically blood plasma and serum.
The Vantera Clinical Analyzer system design is divided into 3 major subassemblies: a
sample handling assembly, an NMR subassembly, and an enclosure. The Vantera Clinical
Analyzer control system is distributed across three separate computers:
• The Host (1U) controls user interface, data handling, results calculation, system startup
and shutdown.
• The Process Control (4U) schedules and manages all activities required to process a
sample, controls all hardware in the sample handling subsystem, and manages remote
access to the system.
• The NMR Control Computer controls all magnet operations.
Two of these computers are contained within the Sample Handling Subassembly (1U and
4U) and one in the NMR Subassembly (NMR Console).
NMR LipoProfile test
The NMR LipoProfile test involves measurement of the 400 MHz proton NMR spectrum of a
plasma/serum sample, deconvolution of the composite signal at approximately 0.8 ppm to
produce signal amplitudes of the lipoprotein subclasses that contribute to the composite
plasma/serum signal, and conversion of these subclass signal amplitudes to lipoprotein
subclass concentrations. The ~0.8 ppm plasma NMR signal arises from the methyl group
protons of the lipids carried in the LDL, HDL and VLDL subclasses of varying diameters.
The NMR signals from the various lipoprotein subclasses have unique and distinctive
frequencies and line shapes, each of which is accounted for in the deconvolution analysis
model. Each subclass signal amplitude is proportional to the number of subclass particles
emitting the signal, which enables subclass particle concentrations to be calculated from the
subclass signal amplitudes derived from the spectral deconvolution analysis. LDL subclass
particle concentrations, in units of nanomoles of particles per liter (nmol/L), are summed to
give the reported total LDL particle concentration (LDL-P). By employing conversion factors
assuming that the various lipoprotein subclass particles have cholesterol and triglyceride
contents characteristic of normolipidemic individuals, HDL cholesterol and triglyceride
concentrations are also derived.

Within-run and within-laboratory precision were evaluated in accordance with the
methods defined in the CLSI Guideline EP5-A, “Evaluation of Precision Performance
of Clinical Chemistry Devices.”
Three serum pools with different analyte concentrations were tested in multiple runs
over multiple days. For the Within-Lab, multiple instruments, operators and reagent
lots were incorporated into the testing and a variance component analysis was
conducted to estimate the individual sources of the total system variability.
Within-run precision - A single run of 20 replicates for the low, medium and high
pool was conducted on one NMR instrument. A single operator conducted all three
runs.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Three serum pools were prepared from patient specimens with low, medium and high
values of LDL-P, HDL-C and Triglycerides (TG) as determined by NMR LipoProfile
test. The pools were mixed in different proportions to produce eleven (for LDL-P) or
Twelve (12) (TG and HDL-C) different samples with widely varying target
concentrations. Mean values from analysis of four replicates of each pool were
compared to the expected target values to determine the percent bias for each sample.
The serum pools were analyzed according to EP6-A. Tables and regression plots of
the linearity data for LDL-P, HDL-P and Triglycerides are given below:

HDL-C 7 – 140 mg/dL
TG 5 – 1100 mg/dL
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor states in the labeling that this device has not been certified or tested by
the Cholesterol Reference Method Laboratory Network.
Traceability for calibrator – TMA (Trimethylacetic acid, Sodium salt, from
Trimethyl acetate hydrate CAS-No 143174-36-1, and Ethylenediamine Tetraacetic
acid CAS-No 139-33-3) is used as the NMR calibrator for the NMR clinical
analyzers. TMA is used routinely as a calibrator once daily during instrument startup
to establish daily normalization factors. It also serves as a quality assessment tool to
ensure quality NMR spectra are produced by the NMR analyzer. New calibrator
material is run in parallel with the existing calibrator in five separate runs. The TMA
calibrator is characterized by the manufacturer using infrared spectrum (chemical
structure), elemental analysis, and titration.
Traceability for control – Controls are included with the NMR LipoProfile® test.
Bio-Rad Liquichek controls (k012513) are obtained by LipoScience and are assigned
target values and expiration dates in house by LipoScience prior to providing the
control sets to the users. The LDL-P specific value assignment occurs via in-house
created master calibrators which are traceable to a purchased source material
characterized by lipoprotein metabolism profiling using a combination of
electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation, and automated enzymatic quantification of
cholesterol and triglycerides (fractions HDL, LDL, VLDL, and Lp[a]). Each lot of
control set is value assigned from the master calibrators through evaluation of 5
replicate measurements per run using 3 instruments analyzing 2 runs per day for 2
days.
Stability – The stability protocol of the TMA calibrator material and the control sets
was reviewed and found to be adequate. Stability studies support a stability claim of
TMA calibrator stability for 18 months either refrigerated or at room temperature.
Stability for the quality controls is designated by the manufacturer and confirmed
using stability studies in house. The stability protocols and acceptance criteria were
reviewed and found to be adequate, with a specific stability claim for LDL-P of 6
months frozen at -20ºC
Sample Stability – The sample stability protocol and acceptance criteria were
reviewed and found to be adequate. The stability study supports a claim of the
following:

d. Detection limit:
Limit of the Blank – Five delipidated serum pools containing very low concentration
were tested in replicates of 4 for 3 days. The Limit of Blank (LoB) was calculated non-
parametrically for each analyte and determined to be the following:
LDL-P: 0.0 nmol/L
HDL-C: 2.7 mg/dL
TG: 1.1 mg/dL
Limit of Detection – Non-lipoprotein specimens were analyzed 60 consecutive times for
3 days. The Limit of Detection (LoD) was calculated parametrically for each analyte and
supported the claimed measuring range of the assay.
LDL-P: 40.7 nmol/L
HDL-C: 3.5 mg/dL
TG: 2.5 mg/dL
Limit of Quantitation – Five serum pools containing very low concentrations were
tested in replicates of 4 for 3 days. The Limit of Quantification (LoQ) was
mathematically calculated for each analyte by plotting the %CV on the Y-axis against
low concentration pools and determined to be the following:
LDL-P: 132 nmol/L
HDL-C: 4.0 mg/dL
TG: 4.0 mg/dL
The LoQ values listed above support the sponsors claimed measuring ranges of:
LDL-P 300 – 3500 nmol/L
HDL-C 7 – 140 mg/dL
TG 5 – 1100 mg/dL
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous substances normally found in blood and exogenous substances (common
and prescription drugs) were evaluated for potential interference with the NMR
LipoProfile® test by LipoScience. Each potential interferent was diluted in the
appropriate solvent and analyzed on the NMR Profiler to determine if it demonstrated

were screened for potential interfering effects to NMR LipoProfile test using
concentrations in accordance to CLSI EP7-A2 guidelines.
If a potentially interfering substance was suspected to have significant interference
defined as difference from control greater than 10%, a spiking study was completed
where the substance was added to sample pools containing two different levels of
LDL-P, HDL-C and triglycerides for a paired difference test.

In addition to conducting a method comparison for the overall data set, the data were
classified into the three following segments based on LDL-P values; (1) results below
the medical decision limits of 1000 nmol/L, (2) results between 1000 and 1600
nmol/L and (3) results above 1600 nmol/L. For each segment the bias was
determined. The determined % Bias for each segment was less than 5% for each
level).
HDL-C: The comparison was conducted in agreement with CLSI EP9-A2: Method
Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples. The study involved testing
singlicates followed by statistical analysis of 1518 freshly-collected clinical de-
identified specimens across the range of the HDL-C test on the Vantera Clinical
Analyzer (candidate device) vs the NMR Profiler (predicate device). Bias was
calculated for HDL-C from the linear regression line at the medical decision limits of
40 and 60 mg/dL as well. The range of the samples was 7.0 to 132 mg/dL.

4. Clinical cut-off:
See expected values below
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor conducted a reference range study in order to determine the normal
distribution of LDL-P levels expected in a representative sampling of the general
population. Healthy adult patient plasma samples were obtained (n=452) and analyzed
(age ranging from 18 to 84 years). Samples or patients with specific history of diabetes
or cardiac, renal or lipid disease were excluded, as well as any patients who were
pregnant or being treated for cancer. Sample results were analyzed together, and also
were partitioned into percentiles and separated based upon patient sex and age. The
results of the reference range study are listed in the tables below:

Labeling for expected values states that each laboratory should verify the validity of the
stated reference range values for the population the laboratory serves.
HDL concentration and triglycerides: The proposed device has similar reference values
as the predicate. The reference values for patient classification have been recommended
by the NCEP and taken from literature* for HDL cholesterol and triglycerides for the
assessment and management of CVD risk. The labeling states that each laboratory should
verify the validity of these reference values for the population it serves.
