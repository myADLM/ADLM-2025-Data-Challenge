3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use
4. Special instrument requirements: None
I. Device Description:
The Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi B31 IgM test is a line blot assay.
The 3 antigenic proteins specific for B. burgdorferi (sensu stricto) are either purified or
cloned and expressed in the host E.coli. The purified individual proteins are transferred
to a nitrocellulose membrane using a spraying micro-dispensing method. Positions of the
lines are defined on the filter and the antigen bands are assigned in the following order:
23, 39, and 41 kDa.
During the test procedure, antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi B31 (sensu stricto) present
in the human serum sample will bind to the antigens coated onto the nitrocellulose strips.
After removing serum and unbound antibodies by washing, the nitrocellulose strip is
incubated with an antihuman IgM antibody-enzyme conjugate. After the unbound
conjugate has been removed by a washing step, visualization of the antigen-antibody-
antibody complex is accomplished by the addition of a substrate which forms a blue-
violet precipitate at each site (antigen bands). The reaction is stopped by washing the
nitrocellulose strip with distilled or deionized water. Depending on the observed band
pattern one can interpret the presence or absence of specific IgM antibodies to B.
burgdorferi infection.

Analytical Specificity Study: For the determination of analytical specificity for the
Gold Standard Diagnostics B. burgdorferi B31 IgM Line Blot Test, testing of 234
asymptomatic samples (blood donors) from both endemic and non-endemic regions was
performed. The results are summarized in the following table:

Cross Reactivity: A cross reactivity study was performed on 215 specimens
known to contain potentially cross reactive antibodies to B.burgdorferi. Sera
from patients with infections and sera from patients with diagnoses that can be
confused with the late manifestations of Lyme disease were tested. The results
are summarized in the following table:

Two of the 20 Babesiosis samples and one each of the 23 Tick-borne relapsing
fever / Rickettsial Disease and 20 Ehrlichiosis specimens were positive on the
Gold Standard Diagnostics B. burgdorferi B31 IgM Line Blot Test. These
samples when tested on the predicate device also gave positive results.
Interfering Substances: The effect of potential interfering substances on samples using
the Gold Standard Diagnostics B. burgdorferi B31 IgM Line Blot Test was evaluated.
High levels of hemoglobin, bilirubin, cholesterol and intralipids in serum samples were
tested on six sera (two positives, one low positive, one high negative, and two negatives).
The recommended concentrations in the guideline “Interference Testing in Clinical
Chemistry” from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute were used. The
interferents at the concentrations tested did not have any influence on the band pattern. A
small variability in band intensity was seen that is in the normal range of deviation and
did not change the final interpretation. The results are summarized in the following table:
Substance Concentration Interference
Hemoglobin 2 g/l None detected
Bilirubin 342 µmol/l None detected
Cholesterol 13 mmol/l None detected
Intralipids 37 mmol/l None detected
f. Assay cut-off:
Determination of Cutoff: The cutoff was determined by testing a total of
365 sera of known anti-B. burgdorferi IgM positives and negatives. The
cutoff concentration was determined by testing several dilutions of each
antigen and choosing the concentration that met the sample criteria best.

Method Comparison Study: The performance of the Gold Standard Diagnostics
B. burgdorferi B31 IgM Line Blot test was determined by conducting a
prospective clinical study at three different geographic sites (Pennsylvania, North
Carolina, and California) in the U.S. The patient samples were tested by an anti-
B. burgdorferi total antibody ELISA test first and the resulting equivocal and
positive specimens were tested on the Gold Standard Diagnostics B. burgdorferi
B31 IgM Line Blot test and a commercially available B. burgdorferi IgM Blot
test. The results are summarized in the following table:
Predicate Device IgM Blot
Positive Negative
Gold Standard Diagnostics Positive 154 1
IgM Line Blot Negative 1 154
Positive Percent Agreement = 99.4% (154/155) [95% CI: 96.5-100%]
Negative Percent Agreement = 99.4% (154/155) [95% CI: 96.5-100%]
The discrepant samples were tested on a second commercially available assay.
On the one Line Blot negative sample that was positive by the predicate, the
second assay gave a positive result. Of the one Line Blot positive and predicate
negative samples, the second assay called the sample positive.
The 310 samples were also tested by the Gold Standard B. burgdorferi IgG Line Blot test
and 36.8% (114/310) were found to be positive and 63.2% (196/310) were found to be
negative.
Sensitivity Study: A sensitivity study for the Gold Standard Diagnostics B.
burgdorferi B31 IgM Line Blot Test was performed on 100 clinically
characterized samples. The samples encompassed early, disseminated, and late
stages of Lyme disease. The results are summarized in the following table:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The immune response to B. burgdorferi appears to follow a normal response
pattern. IgM antibodies can be detected in some patients within days after
onset, while IgG antibodies can be detected as early as two weeks after onset.
IgM antibodies often decrease some weeks to months after convalescence, but
it is also possible that IgM antibody titers remain constant up to some years.
Band patterns will differ from sample to sample due to differences in patient
immune responses and the stage to which the disease has progressed. The
following table summarizes the frequency of bands observed with the Gold
Standard Diagnostics B. burgdorferi B31 IgM Line Blot Test.
