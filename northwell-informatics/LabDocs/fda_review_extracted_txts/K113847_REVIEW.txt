(B31) in human serum. This test is intended for use in testing human serum samples
which have been found positive or equivocal using an ELISA or IFA test procedure to
provide supportive evidence of infection with B. burgdorferi.

intended for the qualitative detection of IgG antibodies to B. burgdorferi sensu stricto
(B31) in human serum. This test is intended for use in testing human serum samples
which have been found positive or equivocal using an ELISA or IFA test procedure to
provide supportive evidence of infection with B. burgdorferi.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use
4. Special instrument requirements: None
I. Device Description:
The Gold Standard Diagnostics Borrelia burgdorferi B31 IgG test is a line blot assay.
The ten antigenic proteins specific for B. burgdorferi (sensu stricto) are either purified or
cloned and expressed in the host E.coli. The purified individual proteins are transferred
to a nitrocellulose membrane using a spraying micro-dispensing method. Positions of the
lines are defined on the filter and the antigen bands are assigned in the following order:
18, 23, 28, 30, 39, 41, 45, 58, 66, and 93 kDa.
During the test procedure, antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi B31 (sensu stricto) present
in the human serum sample will bind to the antigens coated onto the nitrocellulose strips.
After removing serum and unbound antibodies by washing, the nitrocellulose strip is
incubated with an antihuman IgG antibody-enzyme conjugate. After the unbound
conjugate has been removed by a washing step, visualization of the antigen-antibody-
antibody complex is accomplished by the addition of a substrate which forms a blue-
2

--- Page 3 ---
violet precipitate at each site (antigen bands). The reaction is stopped by washing the
nitrocellulose strip with distilled or deionized water. Depending on the observed band
pattern one can interpret the presence or absence of specific IgG antibodies to B.
burgdorferi infection.

Two of the 20 Babesiosis samples and one of the 23 Tick-borne relapsing fever /
Rickettsial Disease specimens were positive on the Gold Standard Diagnostics B.
burgdorferi B31 IgG Line Blot Test. These samples were also tested on the
predicate device which also gave positive results.
Interfering Substances: The effect of potential interfering substances on
samples using the Gold Standard Diagnostics B. burgdorferi B31 IgG Line Blot
Test was evaluated. High levels of hemoglobin, bilirubin, cholesterol and
intralipids in serum samples were tested on six sera (two positives, one low
positive, one high negative, and two negatives). The recommended
concentrations from the guideline “Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry”
from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute were used. The interferents
at the concentrations tested did not have any influence on the band pattern. A
small variability in band intensity was seen that is in the normal range of
deviation and did not change the final interpretation. The results are summarized
in the following table:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method Comparison Study: The performance of the Gold Standard Diagnostics
B. burgdorferi B31 IgG Line Blot test was determined by conducting a
prospective clinical study at three different geographic sites (Pennsylvania, North
Carolina, and California) in the U.S. The patient samples were tested by an anti-
B. burgdorferi ELISA test first and the resulting equivocal and positive specimens
were tested on the Gold Standard Diagnostics B. burgdorferi B31 IgG Line Blot
test and a commercially available B. burgdorferi IgG Blot test. The results are
summarized in the following table:
Predicate Device IgG Blot
Positive Negative
Gold Standard Diagnostics Positive 112 2
IgG Line Blot Negative 1 195
Positive Percent Agreement = 99.1% (112/113) [95% CI: 95.2-100%]
Negative Percent Agreement = 99.0% (195/197) [95% CI: 96.4-99.9%]
The discrepant samples were tested on a second commercially available assay.
On the one Line Blot negative sample that was positive by the predicate, the
second assay gave negative result. Of the two Line Blot positive and predicate
negative samples, the second assay called one sample negative and the other
sample positive.
Sensitivity Study: A sensitivity study for the Gold Standard Diagnostics B.
burgdorferi B31 IgG Line Blot Test was performed on 100 clinically
characterized samples. The samples encompassed early, disseminated, and late
stages of Lyme disease. The results are summarized in the following table:

4. Clinical cut-off:
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The immune response to B. burgdorferi appears to follow a normal response
pattern. IgM antibodies can be detected in some patients within days after
onset, while IgG antibodies can be detected as early as two weeks after onset.
IgM antibody titers often decrease several weeks to months after
convalescence, but it is also possible that antibody titers remain constant up to
several years. Band patterns will differ from sample to sample due to
differences in patient immune responses and the stage to which the disease has
progressed. The following table summarizes the frequency of bands observed
with the Gold Standard Diagnostics B. burgdorferi B31 IgG Line Blot Test.
