For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
BIO-FLASH™ Instrument System (k083518)
I. Device Description:
The QUANTA Flash™ DGP IgA and IgG reagent cartridges contain the following reagents:
· DGP coated paramagnetic beads in buffer, containing protein stabilizers and preservative.
· Assay buffer – containing Tris-buffered saline, Tween 20, protein stabilizers and
preservatives.
· Tracer IgA or IgG – Isoluminol labeled anti-human IgA or IgG antibodies in buffer,
containing protein stabilizers and preservative.
The QUANTA Flash™ DGP IgA or IgG Calibrators set includes two calibrators (Calibrator
1 and Calibrator 2). These are barcoded tubes containing 0.3 mL pre-diluted, ready-to-use
reagent. Calibrators contain human IgA or human IgG antibodies to DGP in buffer. The
calibration process utilizes the 2 calibrators included in the Calibrators set to adjust the
predefined master curve into an instrument specific working curve. This working curve is
used to calculate chemiluminescent unit (CU) values from the measured relative light units
(RLU). The working curve is lot-specific, and is stored in the system for use with any
reagent pack from that lot.
The QUANTA Flash™ DGP IgA or IgG Controls contain four vials (two each of Negative
and Positive Controls) containing human antibodies to DGP in buffer, protein stabilizers and
preservatives.

L. Test Principle:
Anti-DGP antibodies present in the serum bind to DGP-coated paramagnetic beads during an
incubation step. The unbound sample is washed away and isoluminol conjugated anti-human
IgA (or IgG) antibody is added. After washing away any unbound conjugate, the remaining
isoluminol conjugate bound to the DGP-coated paramagnetic beads is exposed to a catalyst
and an oxidizing agent. The light produced from this reaction is measured as relative light
units (RLU) by the BIO-FLASH optical system. The RLU are proportional to the amount of
bound isoluminol conjugate, which in turn is proportional to the amount of anti-DGP
antibodies bound to the DGP on the beads.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility studies:
i) Reproducibility: QUANTA Flash™ DGP IgA and IgG assays reproducibility
testing was performed in accordance with CLSI EP5-A2 Guideline, at three
different testing sites (one internal and two externals sites) using three specimens
including one negative, one around-the-cutoff low positive and one medium
positive. Samples were run in duplicates four times a day for 10 days, resulting in
80 individual data points. Two reagent lots, two calibrator lots and two operators
were included as variables at the internal site. Total coefficient of variation (CV)
was calculated based on within-run, between-run, between-reagent-lots, between-
calibrator-lots, between-operators and between-sites precision.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
i) Linearity: The QUANTA Flash™ DGP IgA and IgG assay linearity studies were
evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP6-A Guideline. In each assay, six serum
samples with various DGP IgA (or IgG) concentrations were diluted with a low
negative serum to obtain values that cover the whole analytical measuring range
(AMR). The observed values were graphed against the calculated values and
linear regression was performed. The study results are summarized in the table
below:

--- Page 8 ---
The claimed reportable Analytical Measuring range is 2.8 CU - 1,936.7 CU.
ii) Dilution Recovery: The BIO-FLASH software has an Auto-rerun option available.
If this option is selected, the instrument will automatically rerun any sample that
has a result >2,367.3 CU for DGP IgA or >1,936.7 for DGP IgG, by further
diluting it by a factor of 10, and calculating the actual CU using this additional
dilution factor.
To confirm the Auto-rerun function, two high positive specimens with results
above the analytical measuring range were selected for each assay. The samples
were run with the Auto-rerun function enabled on the BIO-FLASH. Then the
specimens were manually diluted the same way as it happens in the Auto-rerun
function (10 fold dilution), and tested on the BIO-FLASH. The results were
within the analytical measuring range after auto-rerun or manual dilution for all
specimens. The differences between the manual and automatic results for DGP
IgA were 11% and 15%, and for the DGP IgG 19% and 5%.
iii) High Concentration Hook-effect: To assess hook effect, the measurement signal
(i.e., RLU) was examined for high positive specimens with results above the
analytical measuring range before and after automatic or manual dilution. All
sera produced significantly higher RLU values when used "as is" compared to the
manually or automatically diluted ones, thereby confirming that high positive
specimens above the analytical measuring range do not show hook effect up to
5167.2 CU in the DGP IgA assay and up to 4323.7 CU in the DGP IgG assay.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i) Traceability: There is currently no recognized international standard for the
measurement of IgA or IgG anti-deamidated gliadin peptide antibodies.
Calibrators are assigned values based on a 20 unit cutoff between positive and
negative during assay development.
ii) Calibrator and controls:
Calibrators: The QUANTA Flash™ DGP IgA (or IgG) chemiluminescent
immunoassay utilizes predefined lot specific master curve that is stored in the
reagent cartridge barcode. The QUANTA Flash™ DGP IgA (or IgG) Calibrators
are designed to produce an instrument specific working curve from the parameters
of the master curve, with a decision point based on the performance
characteristics and clinical evaluation of the QUANTA Flash™ DGP IgA (or
IgG) assay. Calibrators are tested on multiple instruments with multiple lots of
reagents prior to value assignment.
Stability studies demonstrated that both the QUANTA Flash™ DGP IgA and IgG
Calibrators can be used for up to 4 calibrations over an 8 hour period.
8

--- Page 9 ---
Controls: The QUANTA Flash™ DGP IgA (or IgG) Controls are made up of a
Negative Control and a Positive Control. Each contains a different amount of IgA
(or IgG) anti-DGP antibodies. The Negative Control is designed to assess
precision and accuracy of the assay at very low antibody levels. The Positive
Control is designed to assess precision and accuracy of the assay at moderate to
high antibody levels.
Stability studies demonstrated that opened Controls can be used for up to 15
times, with a maximum time of 10 minutes onboard the instrument per use. The
total time the control tubes can be uncapped onboard the instrument is 2½ hours,
or 10 minutes per use.
iii) Kit Stability: Stability studies support that the QUANTA Flash™ DGP IgA
reagent cartridge in-use (on-board) stability is 40 days, and the QUANTA Flash™
DGP IgG reagent cartridge in-use (on-board) stability is 62 days. Accelerated
stability studies also support that the QUANTA Flash™ DGP IgA and IgG
assays, as well as the Calibrators and Controls have a shelf life of one year at 2-
8oC.
d. Detection limit:
QUANTA Flash™ DGP IgA: The Limit of Detection (LoD) of the QUANTA
Flash™ DGP IgA assay is 730.3 RLU or 1.826 chemiluminescent unit (CU), which is
below the analytical measuring range of the assay. It was determined consistent with
CLSI EP17-A guideline with proportions of false positives (alpha) less than 5% and
false negatives (beta) less than 5%; based on 140 determinations, with 60 blank and
80 low level samples. The LoB is 504.9 RLU or 1.262 CU.
QUANTA Flash™ DGP IgG: The Limit of Detection (LoD) of the QUANTA
Flash™ DGP IgG assay is 469.2 RLU or 0.626 CU, which is below the analytical
measuring range of the assay. It was determined consistent with CLSI EP17-A
guideline with proportions of false positives (alpha) less than 5% and false negatives
(beta) less than 5%; based on 140 determinations, with 60 blank and 80 low level
samples. The LoB is 257.7 RLU or 0.344 CU.
e. Analytical specificity:
i) Cross-reactivity:
QUANTA Flash™ DGP IgA: To test potential cross-reactivity with
autoantibodies and infection-induced antibodies, 201 patient samples were tested
from patients with infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases and connective tissue
diseases, including those characterized with gastrointestinal symptoms. None of
those specimens were positive in the QUANTA Flash™ DGP IgA test.
9

--- Page 10 ---
QUANTA Flash™ DGP IgG: To test potential cross-reactivity with
autoantibodies and infection-induced antibodies, 185 patient samples were tested
from patients with infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases and connective tissue
diseases, including those characterized with gastrointestinal symptoms. Two out
of the 31 viral hepatitis specimens, two out of the 17 H. pylori infection
specimens, and one out of the 37 rheumatoid arthritis specimens were positive
with the QUANTA Flash™ DGP IgG assay. Altogether, only five out of the 185
specimens (3%) were positive, indicating the minimal cross-reactivity.
ii) Interference: The interference study was performed according to CLSI EP07-A2
Guideline.
QUANTA Flash™ DGP IgA: Three specimens, including one negative (5.8 CU),
one around-the-cutoff low positive (24.7 CU) and one medium positive (186.9
CU), were tested. Interfering substances were spiked into every specimen at three
different concentrations in 10% of total specimen volume, and the resulting
samples were analyzed in triplicates with the DGP IgA assay. Recovery of the
unit values was calculated compared to control samples spiked with the same
volume of diluents. No interference was detected with bilirubin up to 10 mg/dL,
hemoglobin up to 200 mg/dL, triglycerides up to 1,000 mg/dL, cholesterol up to
224.3 mg/dL and with rheumatoid factor IgM up to 500 IU/mL.
QUANTA Flash™ DGP IgG: Four specimens, including one negative (12.8 CU),
two around-the-cutoff low positive (32 and 41.3 CU) and one medium positive
(139.8 CU), were tested. Interfering substances were spiked into every specimen
at three different concentrations in 10% of total specimen volume, and the
resulting samples were analyzed in triplicates with the QUANTA Flash™ DGP
IgG assay. Recovery of the unit values was calculated compared to control
samples spiked with the same volume of diluents. No interference was detected
with bilirubin up to 10 mg/dL, hemoglobin up to 200 mg/dL, triglycerides up to
1000 mg/dL or·cholesterol up to 224.3 mg/dL and rheumatoid factor lgM up to
500 IU/mL.
f. Assay cut-off: The cut off was established in accordance to CLSI C28-A3c Guideline.
QUANTA Flash™ DGP IgA: The assay cutoff of 20 CU was determined by testing
355 serum samples from control population including 201 healthy subjects.
QUANTA Flash™ DGP IgG: The assay cutoff of 20 CU was determined by testing
292 serum samples from control population including 201 healthy subjects.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
QUANTA Flash™ DGP IgA: The clinical validation study included 54 CD samples
(39 samples from patients with CD but on gluten free diet or with unconfirmed CD),
103 non-celiac disease controls, and 21 samples from patients with DH. A separate
external study included 93 CD samples, 151 samples from individuals seeking
medical attention in whom CD was excluded based on physical exam and diagnostic
tests, and 98 disease controls. The results were analyzed to calculate sensitivity and
specificity for CD (n=147) and DH (n=21) separately using the same control
population (n=352). The results of this testing are shown in the Tables below:

b. Other clinical supportive data (when a. is not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
See Assay Cutoff above.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
QUANTA Flash™ DGP IgA: The expected result in the normal population is “negative”.
The prevalence of CD in the not-at-risk reference population is close to 1%, so occasional
positive results can be expected when healthy subjects are tested. A study of 232
apparently healthy individuals tested with the QUANTA Flash™ DGP IgA assay showed
that ~1% were positive (one positive and one weak positive).
QUANTA Flash™ DGP IgG: The expected result in the normal population is “negative”.
The prevalence of CD in the not-at-risk reference population is close to 1%, so occasional
positive results can be expected when healthy subjects are tested. A study of 232
apparently healthy individuals tested with the QUANTA Flash DGP™ IgG assay showed
that ~2% were positive (four positive and one weak positive).
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
