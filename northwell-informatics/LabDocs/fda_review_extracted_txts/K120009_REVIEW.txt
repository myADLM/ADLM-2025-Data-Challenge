L. Test Principle:
The ARCHITECT 2nd Generation Testosterone immunoassay is based on a competitive
test principle with anti-testosterone (sheep, monoclonal) coated paramagnetic
microparticles and chemiluminescence detection. In the first step, sample, assay specific
diluent and anti-testosterone (sheep, monoclonal) coated paramagnetic microparticles are
combined. Testosterone present in the sample binds to the anti-testosterone coated
microparticles. After incubation, testosterone acridinium-labeled conjugate is added to
the reaction mixture. After further incubation and washing, Pre-Trigger and Trigger
solutions are added to the reaction mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is
measured as relative light units (RLUs). The concentration of testosterone is interpolated
from a calibration curve established with calibrators of known testosterone concentration.

range of 3.82 to 1862.27 ng/dL. The measured vs. expected linear regression
analysis generated a linear regression as follows: y= 0.98x + 0.12, r2=0.998.
The data support the sponsor’s claim that the measuring range for the device
is 4.33 to 1500 ng/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Calibrators: Abbott manufactures Testosterone internal standards (primary
calibrators) gravimetrically using USP Testosterone at each concentration
level. The Testosterone calibrators (market calibrators) are manufactured and
tested against these internal standards.
Primary Testosterone Calibrators are prepared in a phosphate buffer synthetic
matrix containing Sodium Chloride, Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and an
antimicrobial agent. Calibrators are prepared gravimetrically to target 0, 2.88,
5.77, 46.14, 360.50, and 865.20 ng/dL Analyte containing calibrators are
prepared with a 1154 ng/dL (40 nmol/L) Testosterone stock solution.
Market versions of the Testosterone Calibrators are prepared the same way as
the Primary testosterone Calibrators. Each of the Market Calibrators is
prepared with testosterone stock solution and 2nd Generation Testosterone
Calibrator/Control Diluent to target concentrations 0, 2.88, 5.77, 46.14,
360.50, and 865.20 ng/dL (0, 0.1, 0.2, 1.6, 12.5, and 30.0 nmol/L).
Controls: Primary controls are prepared in a phosphate buffer synthetic matrix
containing sodium chloride, BSA and an antimicrobial agent. Controls are
prepared gravimetrically to target 8.7, 57.7, and 201.9 ng/dL (0.3, 2.0, and 7.0
nmol/L). Analyte containing controls are prepared with a 1154 ng/dL (40
nmol/L) Testosterone stock solution.
Market versions of the Testosterone Controls are prepared the same way as
the Primary testosterone Controls. Each of the Market Controls is prepared
with testosterone stock solution and 2nd Generation Testosterone
Calibrator/Control Diluent to target to target 8.7, 57.7, and 201.9 ng/dL (0.3,
2.0, and 7.0 nmol/L)
Value assignment: The concentrations of each Market Testosterone Calibrator
are determined by comparison of the relative light unit (RLU) values against
the corresponding Primary Testosterone Calibrators using the ARCHITECT
2nd Generation Testosterone i System. The Market Calibrator is compared to
the corresponding Primary Calibrator using a sample/reference ratio of the
grand mean RLU results. The concentrations are adjusted, if necessary, by
adding either testosterone stock solution or Calibrator A until they match the
Primary Calibrator concentrations within the specification limits.
7

--- Page 8 ---
Value assignment for the Market Testosterone Controls follow the same
procedure as for Market Testosterone Calibrators, please see above.
Stability: The sponsor provided the stability study protocol for reagent,
calibrators and controls. The protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed
and found to be adequate. The real time stability studies are on going.
The sponsor claims shelf-life and open-vial stability 12 months for calibrators,
11 months for controls. The on board stability for the reagent is claimed to be
9 months.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation
(LoQ) were determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A guideline.
The zero-level samples (for determination of the LoB) and the low-level
samples (for determination of the LoD) were tested with a minimum of 2
replicates for the zero-level samples and 1 replicate for the low-level samples
in 5 separate runs over a minimum of 3 days. Testing was performed on 2
ARCHITECT i 2000SR instruments using 2 lots of ARCHITECT 2nd
Generation Testosterone Reagents, 2 lots of ARCHITECT 2nd Generation
Testosterone Calibrators and 1 lot of Controls. Samples on both instruments
were tested with both reagent lots. The LoB was determined to be 1.73 ng/dL
(0.06 nmol/L) and the LoD was determined to be 2.67 ng/dL (0.10 nmol/L).
The LoQ is defined as the lowest analyte concentration that meets an inter-
assay imprecision of < 20%. The LoQ was observed to be 4.33 ng/dL with an
inter-assay CV of 15.6%.
The claimed measuring range of the device is 4.33 to 1500 ng/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Potential interference was evaluated following CLSI EP7-A2 guidance.
Test samples were prepared by spiking each compound at the concentration
level listed in the tables into a serum sample with each level of testosterone
(201.9 and 700.8 ng/dL). Reference samples were prepared by adding solvent
that was used to prepare the compound stocks to a serum sample of each of
the two levels of testosterone (201.9 and 700.8 ng/dL). Spiked samples and
reference samples were tested in a minimum of 12 replicates on one i 2000
SR
instrument using one lot each of ARCHITECT 2nd Generation Testosterone
Reagents, Calibrators, and Controls.
Results of the spiked samples were compared with the reference samples and
% recovery was calculated. Non-significant interference was defined as
recovery of < ±10% of control value, Based on the data the sponsor claims no
significant interference for the substances and concentrations listed below.

(Nandrolone), Ethisterone, 11b-Hydroxytestosterone, and 11-Ketotestosterone
was found. Do not use samples from patients receiving these compounds.”
“Heterophilic antibodies in human serum can react with reagent
immunoglobulins, interfering with in vitro immunoassays. Patients routinely
exposed to animals or to animal serum products can be prone to this interference
and anomalous results may be observed. Additional information may be required
for diagnosis.”

A method comparison study was performed according to the CLSI EP9
guideline using the Passing- Bablok regression method to compare the
ARCHITECT 2nd Generation Testosterone assay to the LCMS testosterone
method. A total of 138 serum samples ranging from 13.74 to 1429.61 ng/dL
were used in this study. The data are summarized in the tables below.

b. Matrix comparison:
The sponsor performed a matrix comparison study using 54 sample sets. Each
sample set consisted of a control tube type (Plastic serum tube) and at least one of
the blood collection tubes (Glass serum tube, Plastic serum separator tube, Plastic
serum separator II Advance tube and Plastic dipotassium EDTA tube) collected
from one donor during one draw. Samples ranging from 14.61 to 1430.75 ng/dL
were analyzed on the ARCHITECT i 2000 system. The samples collected in
control (Plastic/Serum) tube (x) were compared to the sample from one of the
paired comparator tubes (y) and the Passing/Bablok regression analysis results
are summarized in the table below:
Tube type/Anticoagulant Regression Analysis
Glass/Serum y = 1.01x – 0.01 r2= 0.999
Plastic/Serum Separator y = 0.98x – 0.01 r2= 0.998
Plastic/Serum Separator II Advance y = 0.98x + 0.01 r2= 0.999
Plastic/Dipotassium EDTA y = 1.05x – 0.01 r2= 0.998
The sponsor claimed that serum (including serum collected in serum separator
tubes) and plasma (K EDTA) are acceptable collection tubes for use with the
2
Architect 2nd Generation Testosterone assay.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected ranges for the ARCHITECT 2nd Generation Testosterone assay
were obtained from testing a minimum of 120 samples from apparently healthy
individuals in the following categories: normal males, 21-49 years of age with an
intact reproductive system, and normal females 21-49 years of age. Additional
samples were tested from apparently healthy males and females (> 50 years of
age). The data are summarized in the table below.

It is recommended that each laboratory establish its own reference range that is
appropriate for the laboratory’s patient population (i.e., a normal range that
reflects the type of specimen and demographic variables such as age and sex, as
applicable).
