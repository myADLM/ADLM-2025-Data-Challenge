L. Test Principle:
The concentration of the soluble antigen is assessed by turbidimetry. The test sample
is added to a solution containing the appropriate antibody in a reaction cuvette. A
beam of light is passed through the cuvette and is increasingly scattered by the
formation of insoluble immune complexes. Light scatter is monitored by measuring
the decrease in intensity of the incident beam of light. The antibody in the cuvette is
in excess so the amount of immune complex formed is proportional to the antigen
concentration. A series of calibrators of known antigen concentration are assayed to
produce a calibration curve of measured light scatter versus antigen concentration.
Samples of unknown antigen concentration can then be assayed and the results read
from the calibration curve. The polyclonal sheep anti-free light chain antibody is
coated onto polystyrene latex in order to increase the relative light-scattering signal of
the antigen-antibody complexes, and thereby increase the sensitivity of the assay.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed according to CLSI EP5-A2: Evaluation of
Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved
Guideline – Second Edition. Three urine samples with low, medium and high
concentrations of the measuring range were tested over 21 days with 2 runs
per day and each sample in duplicate per run. One lot of reagents and three
analyzers were used. The acceptance criterion of total precision CV < 15%
was met.

Approved Guideline. Linear ranges were established using a dilution series of
9-11 concentrations (kappa 1.10-324.493 mg/L). An unprocessed urine
sample with high analyte concentration was diluted with instrument diluent.
Clinical samples were monoclonal samples from myeloma patients. The
acceptance criteria for each concentration were met (i.e., mean recovery ±20%
and % CV < 10%).

R2 0.9977 0.9914
% Recovery 90.6-117.4 87.1-100
The measuring ranges when using the standard 1:10 dilution are 4.0-180 mg/L
for kappa free light chains. This is consistent with previously cleared
submission for serum (k062372).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There are no reference analytes or standards for this method. A calibrator set
and two controls are provided in each kit. No changes were made from the
previous cleared submissions (k062372 and k040009).
Kit Stability: No change from previous cleared submission.
Urine Stability: The stability of free light chains in urine was evaluated. A
high and a low sample were evaluated at three time points: day 0, two weeks,
and one month. Each sample was divided into two lots; one was stored at 4oC
and the other at -20oC. The difference in results compared to the initial time
point (day 0) was determined, and a difference < 20% was considered
acceptable. Kit controls were processed in each run as a quality control
measure. From the results below, it was concluded that free light chains are
stable in urine at 4oC for at least 28 days.

e. Analytical specificity:
i. Interference: Testing was conducted according to CLSI EP7-A2:
Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline – Second
Edition. High concentrations of hemoglobin, bilirubin, ascorbic acid and
albumin were spiked into urine samples (containing approximately 32
mg/L kappa) and compared to matched samples without interferent. For
albumin, a concentration series up to 5 g/L was evaluated, and the
maximum level of acceptable interference (< 15%) was observed at 1.25
g/L.

Bilirubin 40 mg/L -4.9
Ascorbic Acid 200 mg/ L -10.3
Albumin 1.25 g/L 14.4
ii. Antigen Excess: Antigen excess was studied previously for serum samples
(under k062372). The suitability of the previously determined prozone
limits was assessed for urine samples. A series of four high concentration
monoclonal urine samples with analyte levels from 3904 mg/L to 16249
mg/L were tested at 1/10 dilution. All samples were correctly flagged as
antigen excess by the SPA analyzer. The product insert warns that the
PLUS
amino acid composition of monoclonal free light chains may influence the
level at which a sample may show antigen excess. Antigen excess for
polyclonal serum samples remains unchanged.
iii. Cross Reactivity: Cross reactivity to whole immunoglobulins was
previously carried out with serum samples.

All samples were tested within 14 days of collection and stored at 4oC. 121
samples were evaluated (concentrations ranging from 0.88 mg/L to 87110
mg/L); one sample was a within method outlier with insufficient volume for
