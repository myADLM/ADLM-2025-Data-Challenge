L. Test Principle:
The device is comprised of two main parts: a bio-active electrode (test strip) which contains
the reagent enzyme glucose dehydrogenase (GDH), and the meter. The blood sample is
drawn from fingertip onto the test strip through capillary action. Glucose in the sample
reacts with glucose dehydrogenase and potassium ferricyande in the test strip producing
potassium ferrocyanide which is the product proportional to the glucose concentration in the
blood sample. During potassium ferrocyanide’s oxidation, an electrical current is produced
then converted by the meter. The result (glucose level) will be displayed on the monitor.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

System Accuracy
An accuracy study was conducted to compare performance against a reference
method (YSI 2300 analyzer). Fresh capillary whole blood samples from 100
volunteers, with glucose concentration ranges indicated below, were tested on the
PRECICHEK Cloudia Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Venous blood was
collected and measured on the YSI analyzer. For tested samples less than 50 or
greater than 400 mg/dL, the samples were pooled and glycolyzed or spiked to a
desired level. Three lots of test strips were used on 3 meters. The results are
summarized below.

O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings.
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,
or mobile device?
Yes or No __X___.
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes or No __X ___.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ____x____ or No ________
By review of the software validation report, the sponsor has demonstrated that the device
was designed and developed according to principles of good software life-cycle
processes.
3. Specimen Identification:
Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected. Samples are time and
date stamped upon measurement by the glucose meter.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The meter is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger only. Since
the sample is applied immediately and directly to the test strip there are no sample
handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
The meter is a non-coding meter. No coding is required by the user.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor recommends two levels of control glucose solution, Level I and Level II.
Both are included in the meter kit. An acceptable range is printed on each the glucose
12

test strip vial label. The meter uses an algorithm to automatically recognize the control
solution matrix and to prevent the result from being stored as a patient result.
Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. If
the control values fall outside the range, the user is referred to the user manual and
customer support for troubleshooting and more information.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Infection Control Studies: The PRECICHEK Cloudia Blood Glucose meter is
intended for single-patient use only. Virucide efficacy testing was performed by an
outside commercial testing service using Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)
demonstrating disinfection efficacy with Clorox Germicidal Wipes (EPA Reg
No.67619-12) and the materials comprising the meter. The sponsor also conducted
robustness studies and demonstrated that there was no change in the performance or
the external materials for the meter after 18,250 cleaning and disinfection cycles to
simulate 5 years of single-patient use by lay-users. Each robustness cycle consisted
of one pre-clean wipe and one disinfecting wipe. Labeling was reviewed for adequate
instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
2. The effect of hematocrit levels was evaluated using specimens at 6 glucose
concentrations within the following ranges: 20-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-250, 251-
400, 401-600 mg/dL. Each concentration was tested in replicates of 6 under the
following hematocrit levels: 25, 30, 35, 45, 55, 65%. The study incorporated 6
glucose meters. Blood analysis was also performed on the YSI 2300 glucose
analyzer. The percent bias relative to YSI was calculated for each individual result.
The study supports the sponsor’s claimed hematocrit range of 30-55%.
3. The effect of altitude was evaluated at the following elevations: sea level, 2000, 4000,
6000, 8800, and 10,000 feet, using venous whole blood specimens at 6 concentration
levels: 30-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-250, 251-400, 401-600 mg/dL. The specimens
were tested on 3 lots of test strips with 10 meters in replicates of 10. Measurements
were also taken on the YSI 2300 glucose analyzer. The percent bias was calculated
for each individual specimen concentration. The study supports the sponsor’s
claimed maximum altitude of 8800 feet.
4. The effect of temperature and humidity were evaluated using venous whole blood
specimens at 6 concentration levels: 30-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-250, 251-400, 401-
600 mg/dL. The specimens were tested on 2 lots of test strips with 5 meters in
replicates of 2. The following temperature and humidity levels were evaluated: 10
C/20% RH, 15 C/30 RH, 20 C/45% RH, 25 C/55% RH, 35 C/70% RH, 40 C/80%
RH, 10 C/80% RH, 15 C/70% RH, 20 C/55% RH, 25 C/45% RH, 35 C/30% RH, 40
C/20%. Measurements were also taken on the YSI 2300 glucose analyzer. The
percent bias relative to YSI was calculated for each individual result. The study
supports the sponsor claimed temperature range of 10-30 oC, and claimed humidity
range of 20-80%.

5. The effect of sample volume was evaluated using venous whole blood specimens at 6
concentrations levels: 30-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-250, 251-400, 401-600 mg/dL.
The specimens were tested on 3 lots of test strips with 3 meters in replicates of 9. For
each concentration, 7 sample volumes -ranging from 0.3 – 0.7 μL in increments of
0.05- were evaluated. Blood glucose results obtained by the PRECICHEK meter
were compared with those obtained by YSI. The percent bias relative to YSI was
calculated for each individual result. The study supports the sponsor’s claimed
minimum sample volume of 0.5 μL.
6. Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) (radiated emissions and immunity) testing was
performed for the PRECICHEK Cloudia Blood Glucose Monitoring System. A
signed technical compliance statement was provided to demonstrate that the EMC
testing was performed according to listed standards in the test report. The test report
indicates that the device is technically compliant with the requirements of the listed
standards.
7. A readability assessment was performed whereby lay-users were instructed to
evaluate the labeling and complete a questionnaire to gauge their comprehension of
the labeling. According to the scoring, which rated the user’s experience as a
percentage of agreement with the survey statements from 0 – 100%, more than 85%
of the lay-users scored 75% or better. A Flesh-Kincaid analysis was conducted,
yielding the following results:
