I. Device Description:
The BD MAX™ System and the BD MAX™ MRSA Assay are comprised of an instrument
with associated hardware and accessories, disposable microfluidic cartridges, master mixes,
unitized reagent strips, extraction reagents, and sample buffer tubes.
The BD MAX™ System automates sample lysis, DNA extraction and concentration, reagent
rehydration, nucleic acid amplification and detection of the target nucleic acid sequence
using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Amplified targets are detected with
hydrolysis probes labeled with quenched fluorophores. The amplification, detection and
interpretation of the signals are done automatically by the BD MAX™ System.
A nasal swab is placed in a BD MAX™ MRSA Sample Buffer Tube, which is vortexed and
placed onto the BD MAX™ System. The following automated procedures then takes place:
the bacterial cells are lysed, DNA is extracted on magnetic beads and concentrated, and then
an aliquot of the eluted DNA is added to PCR reagents which contain the MRSA-specific
primers used to amplify the genetic target, if present. The assay also includes a Sample
Processing Control (SPC). The Sample Processing Control is present in the Extraction Tube
and undergoes the extraction, concentration and amplification steps to monitor for inhibitory
substances as well as process inefficiency due to instrument or reagent failure. No operator
intervention is necessary once the clinical sample and reagent strip are loaded into the BD
MAX™ System.
The amplified DNA targets are detected using hydrolysis (TaqMan®) probes labeled at one
end with a fluorescent reporter dye (fluorophore) and at the other end with a quencher
moiety. Probes labeled with different fluorophores are used to detect MRSA and SPC
amplicons in two different optical channels of the BD MAX™ System. When the probes are
in their native state, the fluorescence of the fluorophore is quenched due to its proximity to
the quencher. However, in the presence of target DNA, the probes hybridize to their
complementary sequences and are hydrolyzed by the 5’-3’ exonuclease activity of the DNA
polymerase as it synthesizes the nascent strand along the DNA template. As a result, the
fluorophores are separated from the quencher molecules and fluorescence is emitted. The
amount of fluorescence detected in the two optical channels used for the BD MAX™ MRSA
Assay is directly proportional to the quantity of the corresponding probe that is hydrolyzed.
The BD MAX™ System measures these signals at the end of each amplification cycle, and
interprets the data to provide a result.
The BD MAX™ System software automatically interprets test results. A test result may be
called as NEG (negative), POS (positive) or UNR (unresolved) based on the amplification
status of the target and of the Sample Processing Control. IND (indeterminate) or INC
(incomplete) results are due to BD MAX™ System failure.

Achromopeptidase (ACP), a lysyl endopeptidase is used to rupture bacterial cells in the BD
MAXTM MRSA Assay. The nasal swabs are placed in sample buffer. After elution, sample
buffer is transferred to the Extraction Tube containing ACP. Following enzymatic cell lysis
at elevated temperature, the released nucleic acids are captured by magnetic affinity beads.
The beads with the bound nucleic acids are washed and the nucleic acids are eluted by heat in
Elution Buffer. Eluted DNA is neutralized with Neutralization Buffer and transferred to the
Master Mix Tube to rehydrate PCR reagents. The reconstituted amplification reagent is
dispensed into the BD MAX™ PCR Cartridge.
The amplified DNA targets are detected using hydrolysis (TaqMan®) probes labeled at one
end with a fluorescent reporter dye (fluorophore) and at the other end with a quencher
moiety. Probes labeled with different fluorophores are used to detect MRSA and SPC
amplicons in two different optical channels of the BD MAX™ System. When the probes are
in their native state, the fluorescence of the fluorophore is quenched due to its proximity to
the quencher. However, in the presence of target DNA, the probes hybridize to their
complementary sequences and are hydrolyzed by the 5’-3’ exonuclease activity of the DNA
polymerase as it synthesizes the nascent strand along the DNA template. As a result, the
fluorophores are separated from the quencher molecules and fluorescence is emitted. The
amount of fluorescence detected in the two optical channels used for the BD MAX™ MRSA
Assay is directly proportional to the quantity of the corresponding probe that is hydrolyzed.
The BD MAX™ System measures these signals at the end of each amplification cycle, and
interprets the data to provide a result.
Specific detection of MRSA organisms and discrimination from methicillin-resistant
coagulase-negative Staphylococci (MRCNS) or MSSA is achieved by simultaneously
targeting the Staphylococcus aureus species specific sequence that does not exhibit
homology with nucleotide sequences surrounding the SCCmec integration site in other
staphylococcal species (such as S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus) and since SCCmec is
absent from methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), only DNA from MRSA should be
amplified.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility and Precision of the BD MAX™ MRSA Assay using simulated nasal
specimens and the recommended processing techniques described in BD MAX™
MRSA Assay package insert were evaluated in three studies: lot-to-lot (LTL)
reproducibility, site-to-site (STS) reproducibility, and assay precision.
The MRSA strains used in the panels were Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 43300
(MREJ type ii) and IDI-19 (MREJ type vii). Serial dilutions were prepared from a
semi-logarithmic broth culture supplemented with glycerol (10%) to obtain the
required bacterial concentrations. A bacterial suspension of Staphylococcus
6

--- Page 7 ---
epidermidis (ATCC 14990) was used to simulate the flora present in the nose
(simulated negative nasal matrix). Final concentrations of S. epidermidis for the
negative nasal matrix were between 1.25+E3 and 2.07+E3 CFU/PCR reaction.
Description of the panel members and their respective concentrations were
summarized in the following table:

Panels of 18 tubes (labeled 01R to 18R) were prepared for the reproducibility and
precision studies according to the Table below). For negative panels, only
Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 14990) was used to simulate the flora present in
the nose. For low positive, moderate positive and high negative panel members, the
MRSA bacterial suspensions were mixed with the S. epidermidis suspension. All
simulated specimens contained 1.0E+05 CFU/75μL of S. epidermidis. Cell numbers
in bacterial suspensions were verified by colony counts.

· Quantitative Analysis of PCR parameters was performed as part of this study.
PCR parameters targeted for quantitative analyses were SDPA, SDPH and EP.
For each HN100, HN10, LP, and MP specimen reported as positive upon
testing in the MRSA PCR channel (FAM), the mean, standard deviation and
coefficient of variation were calculated for each parameter. For each TN,
HN100 and HN10 specimen reported as negative upon testing, the same
values were calculated for the Specimen Processing Control channel. The
acceptance criteria for the qualitative results for LTL, STS and Precision
studies were as follows:
· MP overall correct percentage of approximately 100% with 95% CI
· LP overall correct percentage of approximately 95% with 95% CI
· TN overall correct percentage of approximately 100% with 95% CI
· No specific acceptance criteria were defined for either HN100 or HN10.
Lot-to-Lot (LTL) Reproducibility
Three BD MAX™ MRSA Assay kit lots (1161004, 1194001 and 1222001) as well as
three different cartridge lots (1166001, 1168001 and 1168001), were used for the
LTL Reproducibility. The LTL Reproducibility Study was performed in-house at BD
Diagnostics. A total of 30 pre-labeled reproducibility panels were used in the study.
Each panel consisted of 18 tubes labeled 01R to 18R as shown in the above table.
Each category was represented by three specimens on the panel. Testing for each lot
was performed on five distinct days wherein two panels were tested each day (one for
each of two technologists).. This resulted in 30 assay results per lot for each MRSA
strain tested at each level. Only the LP panel was represented by two different MRSA
strains.
The overall correct percentage for each panel category was as follows:
· MP MRSA specimen category 100%
· LP MRSA specimen category 100%
· TN specimen category 100%
· HN100 specimen category at 1/100 dilution 83.3%
· HN10 specimen category at 1/10 dilution 34.4%
The rates obtained for the low and moderate positive MRSA categories as well as for
the true negative category met the targeted specifications for the Reproducibility
study. No specific acceptance criteria were defined for either of the high negative
categories.
The following tables provide qualitative and quantitative reproducibility information:
The LTL reproducibility data tabulated as percent correct and incorrect are shown for
all MREJ types pooled for all lots (pooled days, runs and Tech IDs) is shown in the
table below.

Site-to-Site (STS) Reproducibility
One BD MAX™ MRSA Assay kit lot (# 1222001) and one cartridge lot (# 1168001)
were used for the STS Reproducibility study. Each site was provided with a total
of 10 pre-labeled reproducibility panels. Each panel consisted of the 18 tubes
described as describe above. Each category was represented by three specimens on
the panel. Each site performed testing on five distinct days, wherein two panels were
tested each day (one for each of two technologists). This resulted in 30 assay results
for each MRSA strain tested at each level. Only the LP panel was represented by two
different MRSA strain.

time PCR assays, the BD MAX™ MRSA Assay may not generate reproducibly
positive results when testing samples that have analyte concentrations lower than the
LOD concentration, but higher than the assay cut-off concentration (HN100 and
HN10).
This point is addressed by the following statement in the Limitations section of
package insert: “As with all PCR-based in vitro diagnostic tests, extremely low levels
of target below the LoD of the assay may be detected, but results may not be
reproducible.”
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. The BD MAX™ MRSA is a qualitative assay.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
External controls are not provided by the manufacturer. Various types of external
controls are recommended to allow the user to select the most appropriate control for
their laboratory quality control program:
· Commercially available control materials [e.g. a reference MRSA strain
(ATCC 43300) and Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus strain (e.g.
ATCC 25923) can be used as positive and negative controls, respectively].
· Previously characterized specimens known to be positive or negative for
MRSA.
External positive and negative controls were included in all analytical and clinical
studies performed in support of this submission.
The assay also includes a Sample Processing Control (SPC).
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity (limit of detection or LoD) of the BD MAX™ MRSA was
determined by testing viable MRSA strains. Two distinct LOD determination studies
were conducted using six Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
genotypes (mec Right Extremity Junction, MREJ) type i, ii, iii, iv, v and type vii) for
each study. One study was performed in absence of nasal matrix (i.e. in the Sample
Buffer Tube) and the other was performed in the presence of nasal matrix.
For each MREJ type/condition tested, 108 swabs were soaked with bacterial
suspensions at eight different concentrations. Estimated loads per swab, based on
bacterial count were between 10 and 1600 CFU/swab. Twenty-four swabs were used
for each bacterial concentration (12 swabs x 2 dilution series). After the bacterial
suspensions were absorbed by the swabs, sample preparation was performed as
13

--- Page 14 ---
described below.
To prepare negative nasal matrix, nasal swabs obtained from patients were
characterized with the BD MAX™ MRSA Assay. Negative samples were pooled to
create the negative nasal matrix. Swabs soaked with bacterial suspension, as
described above, were placed in Sample Buffer Tubes containing negative nasal
matrix or Sample Buffer; the stem of each swab was then broken and the swabs were
discharged via vortex for 1 minute.
To evaluate the LoD of the MRSA target with viable bacteria, eight bacterial dilutions
of each MREJ type were tested with the BD MAX™ MRSA Assay. To increase
variability, three different lots of BD MAX™ MRSA Assay (including Sample
Buffer Tubes, Master Mix, Extraction Tubes and Strips) were tested with each
bacterial concentration on nine different BD MAX™ instruments.
The results were analyzed using a statistical linear logistic model that describes the
relationship between the probability of the response and the bacterial concentration.
Briefly, the method models the positive response (expressed in percentage) as a
function of Log (CFU/swab). The logistic model equation for the fitted curve allows
the computation of the LoD by inverse prediction using the parameter estimates and
their 95% confidence interval.
The data and calculations are shown in the following table for MRSA MREJ Type i.
This is shown as an example. Detailed data tables were also presented for all the
MREJ types tested.

an average LOD of 157 CFU/swab.
· With nasal matrix, the LOD ranged between 273 and 645 CFU/swab with an
average LOD of 418 CFU/swab.
e. Analytical specificity:
Inclusivity
An analytical inclusivity study was performed using a variety of Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus strains, taking into account geographic origin, MREJ
genotype, SCCmec type, pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) type, temporal
diversity and susceptibility pattern. Seventy-five (75) strains from 30 countries were
tested in this study, including strains from public collections and from well-
characterized clinical isolates, including vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(VRSA) and vancomycin- intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) strains.
The BD MAX™ MRSA Assay detected all of the MREJ types i, ii, iii, iv, v and vii
(wild and mutant) when tested at low bacterial load (2-3 x LoD). The BD MAX™
MRSA Assay detected MRSA SCCmec types I, II, III, IV, V and VI, VII and VIII, as
well as MRSA PFGE types USA 100 to 800, 1000 and 1100 at 2-3 x LoD. All
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains displaying additional resistance to
vancomycin (VRSA and VISA) were also detected.
A negative result was obtained for one strain. However, an investigation revealed that
there was a dilution error. A new dilution was prepared and the PCR test
demonstrated positive result.

Empty Cassette Variants
The package insert includes the following limitation: “The BD MAX™ MRSA Assay
does not detect the mecA gene directly nor the penicillin-binding protein (PBP 2a)
encoded by this gene. A false positive MRSA result may occur if an “empty cassette”
S. aureus variant is present”.
Well Characterized Challenge
A study was conducted to determine the assay results obtained with a challenge strain
panel containing MRSA strains with high and low oxacillin MIC values, including
PFGE types USA 100, 300, and 400 (with emphasis on USA 300), BORSA, MSSA
and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) strains using the BD
MAX™ MRSA Assay.
The challenge strain panel used in this study was composed of 17 MRSA, four
BORSA, one MRSE and five MSSA strains. All these strains were tested with FDA-
cleared methods for determination of the MIC. All the MRSA strains tested as part of
the Challenge study exhibited positive results when tested at 2-3X LoD. All BORSA,
MSSA and MRSE strains tested exhibited negative results when tested at high
concentrations.
Six different mecA variant mecA strains were tested with the BD MAX™
LGA251
MRSA Assay and the strains were negative in this assay. These strains do not belong
to MREJ genotypes i, ii, iii, iv, v and vii.
This finding is addressed by the following statement in the Limitations section of
package insert: “Methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains that carry the mecA gene
LGA251
mutation, a novel mecA variant, may not be detected by the BD MAX™ MRSA
Assay, resulting in false negative results”.
Cross-Reactivity (bacterial strains)
A study was conducted to assess the analytical specificity of the assay BD MAX™
MRSA with well-characterized isolates of Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus
aureus (MSSA), Coagulase Negative and Positive Staphylococci (CoNS and CoPS),
closely related genera and other pathogenic and commensal organisms of the flora
found in the human nares. Fifty-seven non-staphylococcal strains (representing 54
species), 38 CoNS and seven CoPS strains (representing 29 species) and 111 MSSA
strains were tested using bacterial suspensions ranging between 1.1E+07 and
1.0E+08 CFU/mL. All these species are either phylogenetically related to S. aureus
or are commonly found in the human nares.
Upon first testing of 213 non-target species with the BD MAX™ MRSA assay, five
strains showed positive results. An investigation demonstrated that the false-positive
results obtained were due to contamination, as evidenced by an electrophoresis gel
16

--- Page 17 ---
analysis and by the profile of the PCR amplification curves. New suspensions of the
strains that produced initial false-positive results were tested with a new suspension and
generated the expected negative results. Therefore, all non-target strains yielded
negative results when tested with the BD MAX™ MRSA Assay.

with different viruses that may be found in the human nares. Seventeen different
titrated viral strains were used. Viral strains were tested at >1.0 E +05 PFU/mL or
equivalent unit (e.g. TCID50 units/mL or cp/mL). The Epstein-Barr virus was tested
at 1.0 E +09 cp/mL. All 17 viral strains yielded negative results when tested with
the BD MAX™ MRSA Assay.

nasal swabs were tested at their highest clinically relevant concentrations to
determine the effect on assay performance. Substances tested were either
endogenous (naturally present) or exogenous (artificially introduced into the nasal
cavity).
The following twenty substances were tested using specimens spiked with MRSA at
2-3X LOD and the highest amount of each compound. The expected positive results
were obtained with all substances. Tobramycin, showed slight inhibition (delay of
Second Derivative Peak Abscissa), however, the expected assay results were still
obtained.

Carry over contamination
A panel made of one high positive member and one negative member was used to
prepare numerous samples for this study. An MREJ type v MRSA strain was
used for the high positive panel member (8 E+07 CFU/swab) as it is the MREJ
type with the lowest LoD. ID Broth was used as the negative panel member. Twelve
replicates of the high positive panel member and 12 replicates of the negative panel
member were tested in each run; high positive and negative panel members were

3. Clinical studies:
a. Prospective Clinical Studies:
Clinical performance characteristics of the BD MAX™ MRSA Assay were
determined in a multi-site prospective investigational study. Four geographically
diverse U.S. investigational centers participated in the study. To be enrolled in the
study, patients had to be eligible for MRSA testing according to institutional
policies. Eligibility requirements for targeted screening as per clinical site policies
included, but were not limited to: patients admitted into the particular healthcare
system; patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit; patients transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit; pre-elective surgery patients; and patients being admitted from
long term care facilities. Specimens from patients previously enrolled in the study
were excluded. All specimens in the study meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria
represented excess, de-identified left over material from normal standard of care
laboratory testing.
All clinical sites used the same comparative reference method which consisted of
direct culture complemented by enriched culture. Enriched culture analysis was
completed for all specimens that were negative for MRSA by direct culture.
The culture method consisted of an initial analysis on BBL™ CHROMagar™
Staphylococcus aureus selective chromogenic media followed by subculture on
Blood Agar (BA) of presumptive S. aureus colonies. Identification of S. aureus was
confirmed by performing a Staphaurex PlusTM agglutination test from the subcultured
BA plate. Methicillin/Oxacillin resistance was confirmed by cefoxitin disk diffusion
susceptibility testing in accordance with the CLSI standards (<= 21 mm = resistant;
>= 22 mm = susceptible). Enrichment in Trypticase Soy Broth (TSB) (BBLTM
TrypticaseTM Soy Broth with 6.5% Sodium Chloride) was completed in the event that
methicillin-resistant S. aureus was not confirmed by the initial method. The TSB was
used to inoculate additional BBL™ CHROMagar™ Staphylococcus aureus selective
chromogenic media and BA plates, and MRSA confirmation was performed as

described above.
A total of 1987 nasal swab specimens were tested with both direct culture and the BD
MAX™ MRSA Assay. Of those, 106 specimens were regarded as non-compliant per
protocol criteria for sensitivity and specificity calculations. Therefore, there were
1881 reportable results upon exclusion on noncompliant specimens from performance
analysis. Non-compliant reason description and total non-compliant specimens were
tabulated by site.
The following tables summarize the performance obtained with clinical specimens
using the BD MAX™ MRSA Assay in comparison to the combined reference culture
methods (Direct and Enriched). The overall BD MAX™ MRSA Assay sensitivity
and specificity of these 1881 specimens were 93.0% (146/157) and 95.9%
(1653/1724), respectively. For the population tested, the Negative and Positive
Predictive Value were 99.3%, and 67.3%, respectively.

BD MAX™ MRSA was also compared to the direct culture alone (i.e. without
enrichment). The BD MAX™ MRSA Assay identified 95.0% of the MRSA positive
specimens and 95.2% of the MRSA negative specimens compared to direct culture.
Ten specimens out of 1884 total specimens (0.5%) were reported Unresolved after
initial testing. The 1884 specimens include the 1881 compliant specimens used for
the sensitivity and specificity calculations plus three additional specimens that
produced compliant PCR results. These three specimens were not compliant for
the reference method but these data are included here so as not to bias the non
reportable rates.
In order to accurately reflect the Final Unresolved Rate, the following description and
table will be included in the BD MAX MRSA assay package insert:
“Out of 1884 nasal swab specimens tested with the BD MAX™ MRSA Assay, 10
(0.5%) were reported as Unresolved after initial testing. The Unresolved Rate after
repeat is based upon a total of 1882 specimen results (two specimens with
initial Unresolved results were not retested). All specimens had reportable results
after repeat testing.”
