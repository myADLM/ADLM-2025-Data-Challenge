L. Test Principle:
The principle of immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) is based on the protein separation at
alkaline pH. After protein migration, one of the gel lanes is treated with fixative to fix all
proteins to provide a reference pattern and the other gel lanes are treated with specific
antisera. Reaction with patient samples results in the formation of insoluble antigen-antibody
complex that produces a band of precipitate when the proportion of antibodies and antigen is
appropriate. The precipitation rate depends on temperature, pH, and ionic strength of the
solution. The gels are washed to remove excess un-precipitated proteins, then blotters are
applied to remove excess buffer twice. Gels are then stained with acid violet, de-stained and
dried.
The comparison of the positions of immunofixed bands and that of the suspected monoclonal
band in the reference pattern allows assessment of the biochemical identity of the protein.
IFE usually displays discrete and sharply focused bands with monoclonal proteins in
monoclonal gammopathies. In polyclonal gammopathies a diffuse zone is shown in the
corresponding antiserum.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-Run Reproducibility: Eight serum samples were run in two series in six
replicates within a run. Each series had one normal serum and seven sera with
confirmed monoclonal bands representing specific subtypes were run. For series one,
IgGκ, IgGλ, IgAκ, IgAλ, IgMκ, IgMλ, κ free were tested and for series two IgGκ,
IgGλ, IgAκ, IgAλ, IgMκ, IgMλ, λ free were tested. According to the identified
monoclonal protein, the concordant and reproducible within-run results were
obtained.

normal samples and 1-3 samples each of the 8 subtypes, including 3 IgGκ, 3 IgGλ, 2
IgAκ, 2 IgAλ, 2 IgMκ, 1 IgMλ, 1 free λ, and 1 free κ. The total Ig levels were
between 1 g/L and 5 g/L. According to the identified monoclonal component

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability: Real time stability studies were performed using four packs of IFE Kit and
four packs of antisera kit on IgGk, IgGλ, IgAκ, IgAλ, IgMκ, and IgMλ samples.
Kits were stored at room temperature and tested every 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. The
studies support the IFE kit stability of 24 months. Open kit studies were performed
using four packs of IFE Kit and four packs of antisera kits. Open IFE kits were
stored at room temperature (15 – 30ºC) and open antisera kits were stored at 2 – 8ºC.
Testings were performed at day 1 and 6 months. Results support the open kit
stability for 6 months.
d. Detection limit:
IFE Test detection limit was performed on three pathological samples with twofold
serial dilutions from 1:2 through 1:256. Dilutions were made from the dilutor on the
G26v2.0 (with auto sampler on board). The detection limit of the Immunofixation
Electrophoresis Kit was determined by the lowest concentration of the monoclonal

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference:
Twelve serum samples comprised of one normal and eleven pathological sera (1
IgGκ, 2 IgGλ, 1 IgAκ, 1 IgGλ/IgAλ, 1 IgMκ, 1 IgMλ, 2 IgGκ/free κ, 1 free λ, 1
IgGλ/free λ, with concentration levels of 7 IgG from 779 - 2,040 mg/dL, 2 IgA from
551 - 2,012 mg/dL and 2 IgM from 225 - 450 mg/dL). These samples were spiked
with endogenous substances namely bilirubin, hemoglobin, and triglycerides (lipids)
and tested on the new device using Interlab G26 v.2 Instrument. No effects were
observed with bilirubin (up to 20 mg/dL), hemoglobin (up to 500 mg/dL) and
triglyceride (up to 220 mg/dL).
Eight urine samples comprised of one normal and seven pathological urine samples (1
IgGκ, 3 free κ, 2 free λ, 1 IgGλ/free λ) with concentration ranges from 39 - 4,730
mg/dL. These samples were spiked with prepared hemolysate prepared from whole
blood with 8.8 g/L hemoglobin. No effects were observed on the monoclonal bands
in spite of greater background shown due to residual serum proteins from hemolysate.
Applicator and sample probe Carryover:
Both pathological and normal samples were processed to simulate a standard day of
laboratory analysis on the Interlab G26 instrument. Normal samples were processed
immediately following pathological samples. The final gel run was processed using
saline. Gels were examined visually to check for the appearance of bands as expected
in known samples. Successive gels were examined visually to check for the presence
or absence of the previous sample appearing as carryover. The final gel was
examined visually to check for the absence of all protein bands. No sample carryover
by the applicator was observed in the study after washing procedure protocol.

Urine Samples Study:
A total of 64 concentrated urine samples were performed on Grifols IFE Test using
Interlab G26 v1 and G26 v2Instruments. They comprised of 8 normal and 56
pathological samples, which included 5 polyclonal, 29 kappa free, 8 lambda free, 1
IgGk/kappa free, 1 IgG λ/lambda free, 1 IgG λ and10 IgGk. Of the 64 samples, 6

or 6 samples per gel).
2. Software:
The Interlab operating system Elfolab software version 16.1.0 is designed to work with
the Interlab G26 v. 2.0 instrumentation. FDA has reviewed and found the following
software documents acceptable: Device Hazard Analysis, SRS, Architecture Design

anomalies (bugs and defect) and Operation Manual for the Serum and Urine IFE line of
product types.
Yes ____X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Barcode sample identification available on version 2 with on-board sample pipette.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Samples should be collected using standard techniques following good laboratory
practice. Fresh serum and urine samples are recommended for the tests. If necessary,
serum and urine samples can be stored tightly capped up to one week at 2 - 8°C and up to
one month if stored at 20°C.
Serum
Dilute serum sample as follows:
IgG Track: 1:8 (10 μL of sample + 70 μL of Immunofixation Diluent SRE 153M)
Other tracks: 1:5 (50 μL of sample + 200 μL of Immunofixation Diluent SRE 153M)
9

--- Page 10 ---
For an abnormal band concentration of more than 15 g/L, dilute the sample with the
Immunofixation Diluent, to a final concentration between 2.5-5 g/L. For the IgG track,
dilute the sample with the Immunofixation Diluent, to a final concentration between 1-3
g/L.
If the total immunoglobulin concentration is less than 5 g/L, it is recommended to use
lower dilutions of the samples. Distribute diluted serum in all the wells. Analyze within
10 minutes after samples are added to the sample tray.
Concentrated Urine
Most urine samples must be concentrated. Concentrate the urine to a final total protein
value of about 5 g/L or to a total immunoglobulins concentration of about 1 g/L. If the
total protein or immunoglobulin concentration value is not available, concentrate the
sample in the range of 25X – 80X. Centrifuge the samples before use. If salt
concentration is high, dialyze the urine.
Distribute concentrated urine in all the wells. Analyze within 10 minutes after samples
are added to the sample tray.
The immunofixation analysis on the Interlab G26, with and without the integrated
sampler, is a semi-automated procedure.
Interlab G26 Without On-Board Sampler - application of the samples on the agarose
gel plate, electrophoretic migration, washing, drying, staining, destaining and final gel
drying.
Interlab G26 With On-Board Sampler – Sample Tray preparation from sample
primary tubes including dilutions, application of the samples on the agarose gel plate,
electrophoretic migration, washing, drying, staining, destaining and final gel drying.
Some steps require external treatment of the agarose gel after the electrophoretic
migration: application of the fixative solution and the antisera, gel incubation at 20°C, gel
blotting at 40°C and gel denaturation at 60°C.
5. Calibration:
Not applicable
6. Quality Control:
With Elfolab, it is possible to calculate quality control for both precision and accuracy of
results. The steps to perform the quality control are the following:
· Choose the traces that will be considered useful for the C.V. (coefficient of
variation) calculation (Precision);
· Create a database where the data will be inserted;
· Save the data into the database that was just created;
· Control the values: Average, Variance, Standard Deviation, CV and Levey-
Jennings curves.
The user is guided through an automated, menu-driven QC process.
