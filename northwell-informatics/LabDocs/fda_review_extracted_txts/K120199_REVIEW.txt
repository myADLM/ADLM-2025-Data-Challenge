The HbA1c (Hemoglobin A1c) reagent, when used in conjunction with Beckman Coulter
Systems, HbA1c Calibrators, and SYNCHRON and AU Hemolyzing Reagent, is
intended for the quantitative determination of hemoglobin A1c concentration in human
whole blood. For In Vitro Diagnostic Use only.
The absolute HbA1c and Total Hemoglobin (THb) values generated as part of the HbA1c
assay are intended for use in the calculation of the HbA1c/Total Hemoglobin ratio and
must not be used individually for diagnostic purposes.
The HbA1c Calibrators are an in vitro diagnostic product for the calibration of the
hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) method on the AU clinical chemistry systems.
Measurement of hemoglobin A1c is accepted as a method to measure long-term glucose
control in patients with diabetes mellitus.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
· Prescription use only.
· This assay is designed only for the measurement of mmol/mol HbA1c (IFCC) and
%HbA1c (NGSP). Individual results for Hb and HbA1c concentration should not be
reported.
· Do not use this test for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Performance characteristics for
this use have not been determined.
· This assay is not useful in judging day-to-day glucose control and should not be used
to replace daily home testing of glucose.
· Shortened red cell survival time will reduce the exposure of red cells to glucose, with a
resultant decrease in HbA1c values. Causes of reduced red cell survival time include
hemolytic anemia, or other hemolytic diseases, significant blood loss, blood transfusions
and pregnancy. Caution should be exercised when interpreting the HbA1c results from
patients with these or other conditions affecting red cell survival time, and when the total
hemoglobin is <9 g/dL (5.6 mmol/L).
· Caution should be exercised when interpreting the HbA1c results from patients with
hemolytic disease or other conditions characterized by shortened erythrocyte survival,
acute blood loss, and iron deficiency.
· As with any chemical reaction, users should be aware of the possible effect on results
due to unknown interferences from medication or endogenous substances
4. Special instrument requirements:
For use on the Beckman Coulter AU480/AU680/AU2700 Clinical Chemistry Analyzers
I. Device Description:
The AU® Systems HbA1c (Hemoglobin A1c) Test System involves the use of four reagents:
Total Hemoglobin R1, HbA1c R1, HbA1c R2, and Hemolyzing Reagent (sold separately). In
a pre-treatment step, whole blood is mixed with the Hemolyzing reagent in a 1:100 dilution
2

--- Page 3 ---
and the resultant hemolysate is used. Tetradecylmethyammonium bromide (TTB) in the
hemolyzing reagent eliminated interference from leukocytes.
The concentrations of both HbA1c and Total Hemoglobin are determined. The HbA1c/Total
Hemoglobin ratio is expressed either as mmol/mol (IFCC) or %HbA1c (DCCT/NGSP).
The HbA1c Calibrators are provided in 5 lyophilized levels which contain: Hemolystae
(human and sheep), 0.9% tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide

L. Test Principle:
Total Hemoglobin Reagent is used to measure total hemoglobin by a colorimetric method.
Change in absorbance is measured at 570/660 nm.
HbA1c reagent is used to measure hemoglobin A1c concentration by a turbidimetric
immunoinhibition method. In the reaction, Hemoglobin A1c antibodies combine with HbA1c
from the sample to form soluble antigen-antibody complexes. Polyhaptens from the reagent
then bind with the excess antibodies and the resulting agglutinated complex is measured
turbidimetrically. Change in absorbance is measured at 340/700 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed according to CLSI EP05-A2. Within-run and Total
precision were evaluated by testing a commercial low and high control treated with
hemolyzing reagent. A medium control pool was prepared by mixing the low and
high pool and treated with hemolyzing reagent. Each sample pool was assayed 2
replicates per run, 2 runs per day, for 20 days (n=80) on the Beckman AU480, AU680
and AU2700 analyzers.
An additional precision study was performed according to CLSI-EP05-A2. Within-
run and Total precision were evaluated using three natural patient EDTA blood
sample pools. A low sample (4-5% HbA1c) a medium sample (~6.5% HbA1c) a high
sample (~8.0% HbA1c) and a very high sample pool (12-14% HbA1c) were analyzed
in triplicate, once a day over 5 days (n=15).
The results of both precision studies are shown below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The claimed linearity range is 4-15% for HbA1c
Linearity was evaluated according to CLSI EP-06A. A series of eleven analyte
concentrations, covering the measuring range of the assay, were prepared by
interdilution of a high (19.6) and low (3.6) %HbA1c. Each dilution was assayed in
quadruplicate and the mean analytical results were plotted versus the relative analyte
concentration. Data was analyzed using 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order least square regressions
according to CLSI Protocol EP6-A. Sponsor chose the 3rd order because it was the
best fit. The percent bias between the 1st order and the 2nd order was <10%.
1st order y=0.22x-2.09
2nd order y=0.00x²+0.20x-2.32
3rd order y=9.61x³-0.00x²+0.16x+2.67
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Beckman Coulter HbA1c Test System assay standardization is traceable to the
IFCC reference calibrators. The Beckman Coulter HbA1c Test System assay is
certified with the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP), with
an expiration date of September 1, 2013. The NGSP certification expires one year
from the certification date and needs to be renewed annually. See NGSP website for
current certification at http://www.ngsp.org
Two different units of measure are provided to the customers: NGSP equivalent units
(%) and IFCC equivalent units (mmol/mol).
The HbA1c Calibrators are stable when unopened and stored at 2-8˚C up to the stated
expiration date printed on the bottle. Reconstituted calibrators are stable for 8 hours
when stored at 15-25˚C or 30 hours when stored at 2-8˚C until the expiration date is
reached. Calibrators are stable for 30 days when reconstituted and stored at -20˚C.
]Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable to support the
claimed conditions.
Calibrator values are assigned using multiple analyzers and multiple runs over several
days. The data generated provides set points for use on the AU480, AU680, and
AU2700 platforms. Once the calibration set points are established on the analyzers;
principal samples (IFCC calibrators, IFCC controls, freshly prepared test calibrators,
NGSP traceable samples to cover the NGSP range, and HbA1c/Thb linearity sets) are
run in triplicate and must meet the sponsor’s pre-determined acceptance criteria.
Controls- The sponsor recommends any commercially available control for HbA1c.
Alternatively, the user may use controls previously cleared in k043070

d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined by assaying
an analyte free sample (blank) and five low level HbA1c samples according to CLSI
guideline EP17A. Each sample was assayed once a day for 12 days on the Beckman
AU480, AU680 and AU2700 analyzers. The detection limits are summarized in the
table below:
HbA1c
Platform/Method LoB (%A1c) LoD (%A1c)
Beckman AU480, AU680 and 2.2 2.2
AU2700 analyzer
The assay has a reportable range of 4.0-15.0% for HbA1c on the Beckman AU480,
AU680 and AU2700 analyzer.
e. Analytical specificity:
i.) Interference studies were performed to assess common or known substances that
could interfere with the AU® Systems HbA1c (Hemoglobin A1c) Test System. The
interfering substances were evaluated using K² EDTA whole blood samples. Sample
pools were tested at two HbA1c concentrations (~5% and ~10%). Each sample was
tested in quadruplicate to give a total of four replicates per sample on the Beckman
AU460, AU680 and the AU2700 Clinical Systems using the AU CLINICAL
SYSTEMS HbA1c assay. The percent difference of the samples with and without the
potential interfering substance was calculated. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria is
analyte recovery should not vary from the base recovery by more than 6%. No
significant interference was defined as the % recovery of ≤ ± 6% for Unconjugated
Bilirubin, Rheumatoid Factor and Ascorbic Acid. No significant interference was
defined as the % recovery of ≤ ± 7% for Triglycerides.
The sponsor claimed that there was no significant interference by the following
interfering substances:
· Unconjugated bilirubin up to 30 mg/dL
· Triglycerides (Intralipid) up to 400 mg/dL
· Rheumatoid Factor up to 1000 IU/mL
· Ascorbic Acid 50 mg/dL
· Labile glycated hemoglobin up to 2000 mg/dL
ii.) An interference study was performed to assess the affect of labile A1c with the
AU® Systems HbA1c (Hemoglobin A1c) Test System. Two levels of EDTA
whole blood samples (~5% and ~10% A1c) were used and each pool was split
into two aliquots. One aliquot was used as the control sample while the other

aliquot was supplemented with glucose to a glucose concentration of 2000 mg/dL.
The aliquots were incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees Celsius and then tested on
the Beckman AU480, AU680 and AU2700 Clinical Systems using the. AU®
Systems HbA1c (Hemoglobin A1c) Test System. The percent difference of the
samples with and without the potential interfering substance was calculated. The
sponsor’s acceptance criteria is analyte recovery should not vary from the base
recovery by more than 10%. No significant interference was defined as %
recovery of ≤ ± 10%.
The sponsor claimed that there was no significant interference with labile A1c
concentrations up to 2000mg/dL
iii.) To study the effect of carbamylated hemoglobin, two EDTA whole blood
patient samples with A1c concentration of ~5% and ~10% were split into two
aliquots. Sodium cyanate (10.5 mg/ml in stock solution) was added to one aliquot
of each concentration. Samples were incubated at 37 degrees Celsius for >1 hour.
Samples were tested using the AU® Systems HbA1c (Hemoglobin A1c) Test
System. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion is ≤10% bias between the tested and
the control samples.
The sponsor concludes that carbamylated A1c does not interfere with the AU®
Systems HbA1c (Hemoglobin A1c) Test System .
iv.) An interference study was performed to assess the effect of acetylsalicylic
acid on the AU® Systems HbA1c (Hemoglobin A1c) Test System. Two EDTA
whole blood patient samples with A1c concentration of ~5% and ~10% were split
into two aliquots. One aliquot of each concentration was supplemented by adding
acetylsalicylic acid (10.1 mg/ml in stock solution). The samples were tested using
the AU CLINICAL SYSTEMS HbA1c assay. The sponsor’s acceptance criterion
is ≤10% bias between the tested and the control samples.
The sponsor concludes that acetylsalicylic acid does not interfere with the AU®
Systems HbA1c (Hemoglobin A1c) Test System.
v.) A hemoglobin variant study was performed using commercial samples known
to contain Hemoglobin variants C, D, E, S, F. These variant samples were tested
on the AU 680 Clinical System using the AU® Systems HbA1c (Hemoglobin
A1c) Test System. All variants tested showed <10% bias at ~5% and ~7% for
HbC, ~5%, ~7% and ~9% for HbD, ~6% and ~9 HbE, ~5%, ~7% and ~10% for
HbS and ~5 and ~7% for HbF.
The labeling states “Samples containing >10% HbF may result in lower than
expected HbA1c results.”
