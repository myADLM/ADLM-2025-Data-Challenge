L. Test Principle:
Free cholesterol and cholesterol produced from the enzymatic hydrolysis of cholesterol esters
are oxidized in the presence of cholesterol oxidase. The resulting hydrogen peroxide reacts
with Hydroxybenzoic acid (HBA) and 4-aminoantipyrine to produce a red quinoneimine dye
in the presence of peroxidase. The red quinoneimine dye absorbs at 505 nm. The final

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Four levels of control serum were tested on the Eon 100 analyzer two times per run,
two runs per day for 20 days (n = 80). The results are summarized in the tables
below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies were carried out using serial dilutions of a commercially available
serum cholesterol concentrate. The range tested was 5.0 – 832.0 mg/dL. A
polynomial fit analysis did not indicate statistically significant non linearity. The
linear regression analysis is provided below:

Claimed Measuring Intercept (95%CI)
Slope (95% CI)
Range (mg/dL)
6 – 775 mg/dL -0.7 (-5.4 – 4.0) 0.996 (0.989 – 1.006)
Based on the linearity data, the measuring range claim 6 – 775 mg/dL is supported.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Reagent Traceability
A Cholesterol Reference Method Laboratory Network (CRMLN) Certificate of
Traceability for the Eon Cholesterol Reagent was provided.
Reagent Stability
Closed vial/Shelf life
Accelerated heat stress stability studies have concluded that the reagent is stable for
21 months when stored at 2 – 8 °C. Initial shelf-life claims will be for 18 months;
however, real-time studies are on-going and the final claim will be reflected by real-
time results. Closed vial/Shelf life protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed
and found to be acceptable.
Open vial/On-board Stability
Open vial/On-board stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and
found to be acceptable. The Eon Cholesterol Reagent demonstrated on-board
stability of 28 days.
Eon calibrators, as referenced in the package insert, were cleared in k110394 under
the name ATAC Serum Calibrator (Direct Bilirubin and Iron)
Eon controls, as referenced in the package insert, were cleared in k111063 under the
name Vital Serum Controls
d. Detection limit:
Protocols for the determination of the limit of blank (LoB) and the limit of detection
(LoD) were performed in accordance with the recommendations in the CLSI
Guideline EP17-A. Testing was carried out using true blanks and low level samples
(total 60 each) on two Eon 100 analyzers. The calculated LoB of 0.70 mg/dL and
LoD of 1.5 mg/dL support a LoB and LoD claim of 1 and 2 mg/dL, respectively. The
measuring range of the assay is 6 to 775 mg/dL.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed by using serum pools containing cholesterol (2
levels) with individual interferents at a range of concentrations. The sera were
assayed for cholesterol (n ≥ 3 replicates) and the mean result calculated. Interference
was considered to be significant by the sponsor if the analyte recovery exceeded ±
10%. The results were obtained on the Eon 100 analyzer.

Studies were carried out according to CLSI EP09-A2-IR. Serum samples (n=101)
were assayed in parallel by both the test (Y) and predicate (X) methods. The results
were analyzed by using both Least squares and Deming regression. The range tested
10 – 750 mg/dL. Altered samples were included in the study.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
For cholesterol, the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) recommends
classifying patient results as being desirable, borderline or high based on the following
cut-off thresholds established by the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III:
Desirable: < 200 mg/dL
Borderline: 200 – 239 mg/dL
High: ≥ 240 mg/dL
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
