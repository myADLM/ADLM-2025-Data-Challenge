K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None
L. Test Principle:
This product is used in the administration of the oral glucose tolerance test. Patients
are instructed not to eat or drink anything after midnight before the test. After the
glucose load is consumed, blood samples are drawn for glucose measurements at
specific time intervals to determine potential defects in insulin secretion and/or
insulin action. Fifty gram glucose loads are typically administered for the initial
screening of gestational diabetes. Seventy-five gram glucose loads are typically
administered for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. One hundred gram glucose loads
are typically administered for the diagnosis of gestational diabetes.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not Applicable
