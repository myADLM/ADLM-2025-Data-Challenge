H. Intended Use
1. Intended use:
FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) is a multiplexed nucleic acid test intended for use with the
FilmArray instrument for the simultaneous qualitative detection and identification of multiple
respiratory viral and bacterial nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) obtained from
individuals suspected of respiratory tract infections. The following organism types and
subtypes are identified using the FilmArray RP: Adenovirus, Coronavirus 229E, Coronavirus
HKU1, Coronavirus NL63, Coronavirus OC43, Human Metapneumovirus, Influenza A,
Influenza A subtype H1, Influenza A subtype H3, Influenza A subtype 2009 H1, Influenza B,
Parainfluenza Virus 1, Parainfluenza Virus 2, Parainfluenza Virus 3, Parainfluenza Virus 4,
Rhinovirus/Enterovirus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila
pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The detection and identification of specific viral
and bacterial nucleic acids from individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of a respiratory
infection aids in the diagnosis of respiratory infection if used in conjunction with other
clinical and epidemiological information. The results of this test should not be used as the
sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other management decisions. Negative results in the
setting of a respiratory illness may be due to infection with pathogens that are not detected by

this test or lower respiratory tract infection that is not detected by a nasopharyngeal swab
specimen. Positive results do not rule out co-infection with other organisms: the agent(s)
detected by the Film Array RP may not be the definite cause of disease. Additional
laboratory testing (e.g. bacterial and viral culture, immunofluorescence, and radiography)
may be necessary when evaluating a patient with possible respiratory tract infection.
Due to the small number of positive specimens collected for certain organisms during
the prospective clinical study, performance characteristics for Bordetella pertussis,
Coronavirus 229E, Coronavirus OC43, Influenza A/H1, Influenza A/H3, Influenza
A/2009 H1, Influenza B, Mycoplasma pneumoniae Parainfluenza Virus 1, Parainfluenza
Virus 2, and Parainfluenza Virus 4 were established primarily with retrospective
clinical specimens. Performance characteristics for Chlamydophila pneumoniae were
established primarily using contrived clinical specimens.
Due to the genetic similarity between human Rhinovirus and Enterovirus, the FilmArray RP
cannot reliably differentiate them. A positive FilmArray RP Rhinovirus/Enterovirus result
should be followed-up using an alternate method (e.g., cell culture or sequence analysis).
The FilmArray RP detects Adenovirus species C serotype 2 and serotype 6 with reduced
sensitivity. It is recommended that specimens found to be negative for Adenovirus after
examination using FilmArray RP be confirmed by an alternate method (e.g., FDA cleared
molecular test or cell culture).
The FilmArray RP assay for Coronavirus OC43 may cross-react with some isolates of
Coronavirus HKU1. A dual positive result may be due to cross-reactivity or may indicate a
co-infection.
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established when influenza A/2009 H1N1,
A/H1, and A/H3 were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation. Performance of
detecting influenza A may vary if other influenza A strains are circulating or a novel
influenza A virus emerges. If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on
current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health
authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for
novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health departments for testing. Viral
culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive
and culture specimens.
2. Indication for Use: Same as Intended Use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s): For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements: FilmArray instrument.
I. Device Description:

to isolate, amplify and detect nucleic acid from multiple respiratory pathogens within a single
NPS specimen. The rigid plastic component (fitment) of the FilmArray RP pouch contains
reagents in freeze-dried form. The flexible plastic portion of the pouch is divided into
discrete segments (blisters) which, through interactions with actuators and sensors in the
FilmArray instrument, are where the required chemical processes are carried out. The user of
the FilmArray RP system loads the sample into the FilmArray RP pouch, places the pouch
into the FilmArray instrument, and starts the run. All other operations are automated. A

L. Test Principle
The FilmArray RP System is a multiplex nucleic acid test system composed of the FilmArray
instrument, the FilmArray software (preinstalled on a laptop computer) and the FilmArray
RP pouch. The FilmArray RP pouch contains freeze-dried reagents to perform nucleic acid
purification, reverse transcription, and nested, multiplex PCR with DNA melt analysis. The
Respiratory Panel (RP) pouch identifies the following 20 respiratory pathogens: Adenovirus,
Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Coronavirus HKU1, Coronavirus NL63,
Coronavirus OC43, Coronavirus 229E, Human Metapneumovirus, Human
Rhinovirus/Enterovirus, Influenza A subtype H1, Influenza A subtype H3, Influenza A
subtype 2009 H1, Influenza B, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Parainfluenza Virus 1,
Parainfluenza Virus 2, Parainfluenza Virus 3, Parainfluenza Virus 4, and Respiratory
Syncytial Virus.
A test is initiated by loading Hydration Solution and an unprocessed patient nasopharyngeal
swab (NPS) specimen (i.e., specimen mixed with Sample Buffer) into the FilmArray RP
pouch. The pouch contains all of the reagents required for specimen testing and analysis in a
freeze-dried format. The addition of Hydration Solution and Sample Buffer Mix rehydrates
the reagents. After the pouch is prepared, the FilmArray software guides the user though the
steps of placing the pouch into the instrument, scanning the pouch barcode, entering the
sample identification and initiating the run. The FilmArray instrument contains a coordinated
system of inflatable bladders and seal points, which act on the pouch to control the
movement of liquid between the pouch blisters. Two Peltier devices control heating and
cooling of the pouch to drive the reverse transcription reactions, the PCR reactions, and the
melting curve analysis. Nucleic acid extraction occurs within the FilmArray pouch using
mechanical lysis and standard magnetic bead technology. After extracting and purifying
nucleic acids from the unprocessed sample, the FilmArray performs a nested multiplex PCR
that is executed in two stages. During the first stage, the FilmArray performs a single highly
multiplexed reverse transcription PCR reaction. The products from first stage PCR are then
diluted and combined with a fresh, primer-free master mix and a fluorescent double stranded
DNA binding dye (LC Green®Plus, Idaho Technology Inc.). This second master mix solution
is then distributed to each well of the array. Array wells contain sets of primers designed
specifically to amplify sequences internal to the PCR products generated during the first
stage PCR reaction. The second stage PCR, or nested PCR, is performed in singleplex
fashion in each well of the array. At the conclusion of the second stage PCR, the array is
interrogated by melting curve analysis for the detection of signature amplicons denoting the
presence of specific viral or bacterial targets. A digital camera placed in front of the second
stage PCR captures fluorescent images of the PCR reactions in real time. The FilmArray
software automatically interprets the results of each DNA melting curve analysis and
combines the data with the results of the internal pouch controls to provide a test result for
each organism on the panel.
The melt detector module of the FilmArray Analysis software assigns positive and negative
results to melt curves generated in each well of the PCR2 array. Each assay is present in
triplicate wells distributed across the array. If at least 2 out of 3 wells have positive melt
curves with similar profiles, a positive result is assigned to that assay. If less than 2 of the
replicate wells have positive melt curves in the Tm window, or if the curves are dissimilar, a
negative result is assigned to the assay. A meta-analysis determines the final result [Detected
8

--- Page 9 ---
(positive), Not Detected (negative), or Equivocal] for each RP organism. For organisms
represented by a single PCR2 assay, the assay result and organism result are the same.
Results for Influenza A, and Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus are determined by meta-analysis
of multiple assay results. Meta-analysis for Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus incorporates the
results of 6 different assays (Entero1, Entero2, HRV1, HRV2, HRV3, and HRV4). The HRV
assays recognize both Rhinoviruses and Enteroviruses, while the Entero assays target a
unique sequence that is not found in Rhinoviruses. Any positive assay result will produce a
combined Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus organism result. Organism results for Influenza A
are determined by meta-analysis of multiple pan-influenza A and subtype targeted assay
results. The FilmArray RP System is designed to both detect Influenza A and to differentiate
commonly occurring hemagglutinin subtypes. To accomplish this, the FilmArray RP uses
two Influenza A assays, (FluA-pan1and FluA-pan2) and three subtyping assays directed at
the hemagglutinin gene (H1-pan, H1-2009 and H3).
The H1-pan assay is designed to detect Influenza A/H1, including the Influenza A/2009 H1
variant. The H1-2009 assay specifically detects the pandemic 2009 H1N1 variant. Meta-
analysis for Influenza A is outlined in the following table:

a If both of the influenza A assays are positive, but none of the hemagglutinin subtyping assays are positive,
then the interpretation is ‘Influenza A (no subtype detected).’ This result could occur when the titer of the
virus in the specimen is low and not detected by the subtyping assays. This result could also indicate the

presence of a novel Influenza A strain. In both cases, the sample in question should be retested. If the retest
provides a different result, then the sample is tested a third time to ensure the accuracy of the result. If the
retest provides the same result, then the function of the RP pouches should be verified by testing with
appropriate external control materials (known positive samples for Influenza A H1, Influenza A H3 and
Influenza A 2009 H1) and a negative control reaction should be run to test for PCR-product contamination.
If the FilmArray RP accurately identifies the external controls, contact local or state public health
authorities for confirmatory testing.
In general, Influenza A is determined to be detected if at least one of the two FluA pan assays
is positive and the corresponding subtyping assay is also positive. If neither of the pan assays
is positive, but a subtyping assay is positive, then the result is considered equivocal for that
specific subtype and the sample should be retested. If one of the pan assays is positive and no
subtyping assay is positive, the result is Influenza A Equivocal and the specimen should be
retested. If both FluA pan assays are positive and no subtyping assay is positive the result is
reported as ‘Influenza A (no subtype detected). The product literature instructs the operator
to retest the specimen. If the ‘no subtype detected’ result is repeated, the product literature
directs the operator concerning appropriate follow-up testing and, if needed, notification of
public health authorities.
If either the RNA Process Control or the PCR2 Control fails (negative assay result), all
organisms are assigned an ‘Invalid’ test result. Invalid results are also assigned to all assays if
the FilmArray instrument protocol or analysis does not complete, an Instrument Error is
reported, or a Software Error is reported. All test specimens that receive Invalid results
should be retested.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision/reproducibility study panel of twelve specimens (see table below) was created by
spiking simulated NPS sample matrix with known quantities of live RP organisms. The
specimens in the panel were designed so that all 20 RP organisms would be tested at three
concentrations (3x LoD, 1x LoD, and 0.1x LoD). Several analytes were spiked into each
specimen to simulate the possibility of co-infections with multiple pathogens at various levels.
Human Rhinovirus (HRV) and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) were included in more
specimens than the other analytes because they were the most common panel members
detected in co-infected clinical NPS specimens during the prospective clinical evaluation
performed by ITI.

Following spiking, the composition of each specimen pool was verified by testing with the
FilmArray RP system. Pools that did not perform as expected were remade. Pools that
performed as expected were aliquoted into several individual use vials, and frozen until the
scheduled day of testing. Specimen aliquots were hand-delivered (Site A) or shipped (Site
B) to external testing sites on dry ice and stored frozen (-70°C) at each testing site until the
day of testing. All specimen aliquots were tested on the same day they were removed from
the freezer. The test operators at test sites were blinded to the organisms and test levels in
each specimen.
Reproducibility testing was performed at three test sites (Site A, Site B, and Site C) by

multiple operators (4-5 per site) using multiple (26) lots of reagents, and multiple (20)
FilmArray instruments between the three sites. Each specimen was tested 4 times per day (2
operators and 2 instruments per specimen) for 5 days at each site, giving a total of 20 test
results from each test site (a minimum of 60 total test results for each analyte at each
concentration). Negative analyte results were derived from any specimen that was not spiked
with the analyte of interest. Every analyte was absent from at least six specimens, providing
a minimum of 360 expected negative results for each analyte across all sites combined.
A total of 1,056 specimens were tested over the course of the study, and 92.7% (979/1056)
of these specimens yielded valid results on the first attempt (i.e., first loaded pouch). Invalid
results or no results were obtained for the remaining 77 (7.3%) specimens (no results for 31
specimens due to incomplete runs; 46 specimens were “invalid” due to Pouch Controls
failures). The 31 incomplete runs consisted of Instrument Errors (14), Software Errors (9),
and 8 runs that were either aborted by the operator or failed to complete. All samples for
which the first pouch runs did not complete were retested using a new pouch/sample to
obtain valid results. All samples for which the pouch controls failed were also retested
using a new pouch/sample to obtain valid results.

a Known failure mode in the instrument bladder system. A new bladder material has been implemented to reduce
this error mode.
b An additional 8 errors occurred; however, valid results were obtained by restarting the sample using the same
pouch.
c Known failure mode caused by a communication timing error between the FilmArray software and the driver of
the instrument camera. The underlying cause of the errors was resolved with an update to the FilmArray software.
This error mode was eliminated in software version 1.1. (Validation study of a total of 872 runs using software
version 1.1demonstrated 0% error rate caused by this particular error mode.)

a Includes 1 run that failed because the wrong protocol was selected.
b Investigation into the higher than expected rate of RNA process controls revealed that the QC process used to
control the amount of control template was inadequate. The QC process has been revised to better control the
concentration of control template.
At each test site between 4 and 5 operators participated in the study, with at least 2 different
operators testing samples each day. The number of errors experienced by each test site was
similar, though the percentage was lower for Site C due to a higher number of runs
performed. The distribution of errors between operators at test sites A and B was somewhat
variable, but there did not appear to be a strong correlation between system errors and
particular operators.

b. Precision/(Repeatability)
The repeatability of the FilmArray RP System results was evaluated by repeated testing
of the same 12 specimens. The in-house precision testing was performed at ITI (Site C)
over the course of 12 testing days for a total of 48 test results per specimen. On each day
all 12 specimens were tested 4 times by two operators on two FilmArray instruments.
Results from the first 5 days of testing are included as the Reproducibility results for Site
C. All operators were instructed to retest any samples that produced Invalid test results
(failed controls or incomplete runs). Valid retest results were recorded as the final result.

into the sample injection port of each pouch. When the test specimen is loaded
into the pouch, S. pombe is rehydrated and enters the pouch with the specimen.
The yeast nucleic acid is extracted, purified and tested simultaneously with nucleic
acids from the patient specimen. A positive result for the processing control
indicates that all steps in the process (nucleic acid extraction, reverse transcription,
PCR, melt, detection, and analysis) are functioning properly.
(2) The second stage PCR (PCR2) control assay detects a synthetic DNA template
that is dried into triplicate wells of the array along with the corresponding primers.
A positive result indicates that PCR2 was successful.
The RNA Process Control and the PCR2 Control assays are used to Pass or Fail each
FilmArray RP pouch run. This combination of control assays monitors each of the critical
mechanical and chemical processes that occur in a pouch run, while limiting the possibility
of random control assay failures that could contribute to unnecessary pouch failures.
External controls are not provided with the FilmArray RP System. External control mixes
were provided to the clinical study sites for daily testing during the sponsor’s prospective
clinical study. These are described in the discussion of the clinical trial on page 114 below;
however the following is present in the product package insert: “Good laboratory practice
recommends running external positive and negative controls regularly. Use viral transport
medium as the external Negative Control, and previously characterized positive samples or
negative samples spiked with well characterized target organisms as external Positive
Controls. External controls should be used in accordance with local, state, federal
accrediting organizations, as applicable.”
ii. Specimen Stability
An analytical study was performed to establish the recommended transport and storage
conditions for nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens that will be tested using the Film
Array Respiratory Panel System.
For the specimen transport and storage evaluation, both positive and negative specimens
were assessed. Positive specimens consisted of simulated NPS (cultured human epithelial
cells in VTM) spiked with mixes of targeted organisms at 5x the limit of detection (LoD)
Negative data were collected from specimens that had been spiked with a different organism
mix, such that results for the organism(s) of interest were expected to be negative. Ten
independent specimens were prepared for each organism mix and tested “fresh” or without
storage (0 Hour). Additional aliquots were made and two aliquots of 10 specimens per mix
were stored at each of the conditions described below. Duplicate aliquots were stored for
each specimen to allow for retesting if needed. For each RP organism, 10 positive and 30
negative specimens were evaluated at each storage condition. At least 9/10 positive results
were required for each organism at each storage condition. In addition to positive and
negative results, the average crossing point (Cp) of amplification curves and melting
temperature (Tm) of melt curves were reviewed for each assay at each storage condition. A
shift in Tm or Cp from one storage condition to another could indicate that the integrity of
the specimen was affected by storage.

In addition, the average crossing point (Cp) of amplification curves and melting temperature
(Tm) of melt curves were also reviewed for each assay at each storage condition. The
difference in average Cp (Δ Cp) and average Tm (Δ Tm) between the test storage condition
and the initial (0 Hour) test result was calculated for each assay. When Δ Cp for all assays
was reviewed, no general trend toward later Cps (decreased sensitivity or fewer templates)
was observed for any one particular storage condition.
The results of this study support the claim that NPS specimens in Viral Transport Medium
(VTM) can be stored for up to 4 hours at room temperature (18-30°C), 3 days in the
refrigerator (2-8°C) or 30 days in the freezer (< -15°C) without affecting the accuracy of
FilmArray RP test results.
iii. Preservation of Vacuum for Pouch Hydration and Sample Loading and
Stability of Reagents and Control Material after Hydration and Loading of a
Pouch
To maintain pouch integrity and reagent stability, pouches are packaged in an aluminum
canister, which is then sealed under vacuum in opaque mylar outer packaging. Ideally, a
pouch is hydrated and sample loaded immediately after the pouch packaging is opened, and
the loaded pouch is immediately placed in the FilmArray instrument for testing. However,

laboratory workflow and instrument availability may result in a pouch being opened before
a sample can be loaded, or a pouch to be loaded before an instrument is available for testing.
The FilmArray product literature recommends the loading and testing of pouches
immediately or within a limited timeframe (30 minutes for pouch loading and 60 minutes
for testing a loaded pouch).
Analytical testing was performed to discover whether the integrity and performance of an
opened pouch is affected by longer times outside of the vacuum-sealed packaging prior to
loading and testing.
Pouches were removed from outer packaging and exposed to air at ambient temperature for
various times up to 24 hours. The preservation of vacuum for pouch hydration and sample
loading was evaluated by loading blank simulated NPS (sNPS) samples (no target analytes
present) according to standard procedure. The volume of each solution (hydration solution
and sample/sample buffer mix) drawn into the pouch was recorded and the loaded pouches
were then tested to observe the performance of the internal controls assays. The control
results from these same pouches were used to assess reagent stability. Overall, the measures
of performance for these tests included the efficiency of pouch hydration and sample loading,
visual inspection of pouches, and the results (pass or fail) of internal control assays (RNA
Process Control and PCR2 Control).
The stability of reagents and control material after hydration and loading of a pouch was also
examined. Pouches were hydrated and loaded with blank sNPS sample (no analytes present)
according to standard protocol directly after removal from outer packaging. The loaded
pouches were then stored under ambient conditions for various times up to 24 hours. The
results of internal control reactions (pass or fail) were assessed to determine whether system
performance was affected by storage of a loaded pouch prior to testing. In addition, four (4)
replicate pouches were loaded with contrived sample containing live respiratory pathogens
(Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Human Metapneumovirus, Influenza A H1N1, Parainfluenza
Virus 3, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus) at concentrations both above and below the
estimated system LoD. The loaded pouches were stored at ambient temperature for 8 hours
prior to testing. The results of both internal control and analyte assays from these 4 pouches
were compared to eight (8) control pouches that were loaded with the same contrived sample
but tested without storage (immediately after loading).
Each tested handling condition was considered successful if the variables (including mean Cp
for the relevant assay) evaluated were equivalent (within 3 cycles for Cp) to that of the
control sample (test at time 0 after pouch opening or loading). Any handling condition that
resulted in improper pouch hydration, sample loading, failed control results, or unexpected
negative analyte results was repeated to confirm the result. If the result was repeatable, then
the integrity and/or stability of the pouch were considered diminished under the handling
condition that caused the failure.
The data presented in the table below demonstrated that pouch vacuum was preserved for up
to 24 hours after the removal of a pouch from its outer packaging, allowing for proper pouch
hydration and sample uptake.

In conclusion, the data supports the conservative recommendations in the FilmArray
product package insert for the loading and testing of pouches within a limited timeframe
(30 minutes for pouch loading and 60 minutes for testing a loaded pouch).
iv. Fresh vs. Frozen Study
In order to utilize frozen banked clinical samples to supplement the prospective clinical
study data in the evaluation of the FilmArray Respiratory Panel System, an analytical
study was conducted to demonstrate that preservation of samples (by freezing at ≤-70°C
does not affect the accuracy of test results compared to freshly collected or freshly
prepared samples.
The “fresh vs. frozen” analytical study was carried out as part of a larger reproducibility
study using samples that had been stored at ≤-70°C for as long as 30 days. The test
samples were prepared in bulk and tested immediately after preparation (fresh) prior to
storage. The fresh sample tests provided a baseline of performance to which the results
from subsequent testing of the frozen samples was compared. A panel of twelve (12)
specimens was created by spiking simulated NPS sample matrix with known quantities of
live RP analytes. The specimens in the panel were designed so that all RP analytes would
be tested at different concentrations. Multiple analytes were spiked into each specimen to
simulate the possibility of co-infections with multiple pathogens. Human Rhinovirus
(HRV) and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) were included in more specimens than the
other analytes because they were the most common panel members detected in co-infected

clinical samples during the clinical evaluation performed by ITI. Immediately after sample
preparation (spiking), each fresh specimen pool was screened with the FilmArray RP
system to establish ‘baseline’ or expected results. The remaining specimen volume was
then aliquoted into several individual use vials, and frozen until the scheduled day of
testing (up to 30 days frozen at ≤-70°C). Specimen aliquots were hand-delivered or
shipped to external testing sites on dry ice and stored frozen until the day of testing. All
specimen aliquots were tested on the same day they were removed from the freezer.
In total, at least 120 samples were tested for each analyte at (1x) or near (3x) the LoD
determined in the LoD studies. All contrived samples consisted of live organisms spiked into
negative simulated nasopharyngeal swab sample matrix. (Note: The simulated sample matrix
consisted of human cells in viral transport media (VTM) and was validated in “Validation of
a Simulated NPS Sample Matrix for Use with the FilmArray Respiratory Panel System”.
This validation study demonstrated that the sensitivity of the FilmArray RP system was
comparable between samples prepared in nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and simulated NPS
sample matrices. Since the natural NPS samples are required to be diluted in VTM before
being tested by the FilmArray RP System, the simulated NPS matrix consisting of VTM and
epithelial cells is considered to be similar enough to the natural matrix (i.e., NPS in VTM)
for the purpose of this study.

a Three (3) Equivocals are not included as positive results. Samples with Equivocal results were not retested in this
study.
The results of this study demonstrated that freezing at ≤ -70°C for up to 30 days does not
alter the performance of the FilmArray RP System in comparison to testing of fresh
specimens.
e. Detection limit:
Analytical studies were carried out to determine the LoD for each FilmArray RP targeted
organism.
A preliminary estimate of sensitivity for many RP analytes was determined as part of the
“FilmArray RP Melt Detector Tuning” study using limiting dilutions of single organisms
spiked into negative NPS specimens. Based on these preliminary results, initial estimates of
LoD were set by spiking negative NPS specimens with serial 10-fold dilutions of quantified
live virus. Where possible, each stock organism was re-grown, verified, and quantified

(TCID /mL, CFU/mL, copies/mL, etc.). Coronavirus HKU1 could not be re-grown for
50
verification despite multiple attempts; instead, a clinical specimen containing a high viral
load was quantified by a non-FilmArray real-time PCR against a standard curve of synthetic
RNA transcript (Coronavirus HKU1) to obtain quantification of the stock material in RNA
genome copies/mL, respectively. The identity of the virus contained in the clinical specimen
was verified by bi-directional sequencing. The single-spiked specimens were then tested with
the FilmArray RP System. The lowest concentration of organism for which all or most
replicates were assigned a positive (detected) result by the FilmArray software was selected
for additional testing in multi-spiked specimens.
Multiple organisms were combined and tested as a mix (multi-spike; see the table below) in
replicate NPS specimens at a single concentration or as a dilution series centered on the
estimated LoD. Results from single-spiked and multi-spiked specimens were compared to
determine whether the presence of multiple organisms in a specimen would affect the system
LoD.

Both percent detection (% positive) and Cp values were used to compare results for single-
spiked and multi- spiked specimen data sets. It was concluded that multi-spiking and single-
spiking results were substantially equivalent, since the % detection was within 25% for the
two data sets and/or the mean Cp values were within 3 cycles. (Note: Based on an observed
Cp standard deviation for replicate samples of about 1-2 cycles, a 3 cycle difference is a
conservative estimate of the expected variation when testing near LoD and does not indicate
a significant difference in sensitivity.)
Additional LoD testing and confirmation of LoD for primary strains was then performed
with multi-spiked specimens. Coronavirus HKU1 was not included in a multi- spiked mix
for this study. Coronavirus HKU1 LoD was confirmed as a single-spiked sample but was
shown in subsequent studies to be detected at single-spiked LoD levels when tested in multi-
spiked specimens.
As needed, adjustments to the concentration of individual organisms within a multi-spiked
mix were made prior to confirmation of final LoD concentrations. Confirmation of the
system LoD for each organism included testing of 20 independent multi-spiked specimens at
LoD and an additional 20 specimens spiked 10- fold below LoD (0.1x LoD). For
confirmation, at least 19/20 positive results were required for each organism at the LoD
concentration and fewer than 95% positive results were required at concentrations below
LoD.
Additional sensitivity testing was performed on one or more alternate strains of several RP

organisms. These alternate strains represented different major subgroups of common
respiratory viruses (Adenovirus, Human Metapneumovirus, Human Rhinovirus and
Respiratory Syncytial Virus) and isolates of Influenza A and B from different seasons and
geographic locations. Each alternate strain was tested as 10-fold dilutions around the
previously determined LoD.
Note: Although this testing was performed in part to demonstrate that the FilmArray RP
system can detect various species and strains of an organism with similar sensitivity, it is
difficult to make comparative sensitivity evaluations between different organisms and
different strains that have been quantified by TCID . This quantification method measures
50
the infectivity and cytotoxicity or lethality of an organism in tissue culture and is therefore
subject to many influences (strain-to-strain differences in infectivity, viability of the original
material, culturing conditions, etc.). Quantification by infectivity assay will not be
equivalent between strains or organisms. Also, since the measurand for the FilmArray
system is nucleic acid, LoD concentrations established in TCID can vary dramatically
50
between targets, but may not actually reflect significant differences in sensitivity of
detection as measured by target nucleic acid concentration.
During the early stages of LoD testing, it was discovered that some NPS specimens
collected from apparently healthy individuals did in fact contain respiratory pathogens
(mostly Rhinovirus). As a result, a simulated NPS (sNPS) sample matrix, consisting of
cultured human epithelial cells (HeLa) in Viral Transport Medium, was evaluated for use in
LoD confirmation testing and subsequent analytical studies. The sensitivity of the
FilmArray RP system with this simulated sample matrix was found to be comparable to a
sample matrix comprised of pooled NPS collected from healthy individuals. The simulated
NPS sample matrix was used for final LoD confirmations and all subsequent analytical
studies.
Summary results for the LoD confirmation studies using primary strains and additional
sensitivity testing of alternate strains are presented below by organism:

f. Analytical Reactivity
The analytical inclusivity study was performed to determine whether the FilmArray RP
System is able to detect a variety of strains (inclusivity panel) that represent the temporal
and geographic diversity of each of RP target organism. This study expanded upon the limit
of detection studies by determining whether different strains of the same organism can be
detected at similar concentrations.
This study involves testing panels of various strains of organisms spiked into simulated NPS
specimens using the FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) System. Inclusivity organisms were
initially tested near the limit of detection (LoD) for each organism as determined in the LoD
study. If a specimen containing a particular strain was positive (detected) at the LoD level, no
further testing of that strain was required. If a strain was not detected at the LoD
concentration, the strain was retested at the LoD level and 10-fold higher. If necessary, the
same approach was followed until a positive result was obtained or the maximum

concentration possible for that strain stock had been tested.
The inclusivity panel represents the evolutionary, temporal, and geographical diversity of the
RP analytes. For example, the inclusivity panel includes 17 different Adenovirus serotypes
representing species A, B, C, D, E and F, over 20 Influenza A strains (subtypes H3, H1 and
2009 H1) isolated from around the world as many as 77 years ago (1933) and as recently as
2009, and 25 strains of the group that comprised of Human Rhinovirus A and B, Enterovirus,
Echovirus, and Coxsackievirus. However, for some analytes, the inclusivity panel is
restricted to only 1 or 2 strains because of limited strain diversity and availability.
For inclusivity (reactivity) testing, a total of 133 individual RP target organism strains were
tested and accurately identified with the FilmArray RP system. Each of the 131 strains tested
in this study were reactive with the FilmArray RP system. The sensitivity of detection for
Adenovirus C serotype 6 was 10,000-fold less than the system LoD due to sequence variation
(mismatches) within the primers of the second stage PCR reaction. The sensitivity of
detection for Adenovirus C serotype 2 was 100-fold less than the system LoD due to
sequence variation (mismatches) within the region targeted by the FilmArray RP Adenovirus
assay. The limited detection capability of the FilmArray RP system for these Adenovirus
serotypes is described in FilmArray RP intended use as follows: “The FilmArray RP detects
Adenovirus species C serotype 2 and serotype 6 with reduced sensitivity. It is recommended
that specimens found to be negative for Adenovirus after examination using FilmArray RP be
confirmed by an alternate method (e.g., FDA cleared molecular test or cell culture).”

a The 5’UTR sequences of these strains were aligned with the outer and inner PCR primers for the HRV
assays to determine whether sequence mismatches may be contributing to the somewhat reduced sensitivity
of the FilmArray RP system for these strains. Primers for at least one of the 4 HRV assays (inner primers)
aligned very well with published sequence for each strain (0 – 1 mismatches in the primer region),
suggesting that the observed differences in sensitivity are likely attributable to inconsistencies in
quantification of the viral stock rather than the sensitivity of the assay(s) themselves.

i. Supplemental Adenovirus Reactivity Information (clinical study data
and in silico analyses):
A subset of prospective and retrospective archived clinical specimens that were FilmArray
positive for Adenovirus was subjected to PCR and bi-directional sequence analysis. BLAST
analysis of the sequence data obtained for a region of the Adenovirus polymerase gene
identified adenovirus species B (serotypes 3, 3+11p, 7, 16 and 21), species C (serotypes 1, 2,
and 5), and species E (serotype 4) in these clinical specimens. Species B, C and E are the
most common Adenovirus species associated with respiratory illness. Species A, D, and F
(often associated with conjunctivitis and gastroenteritis) were not identified in clinical
specimens.
In addition to laboratory testing, bioinformatics resources were also used to predict
reactivity of additional Adenovirus species and serotypes with the FilmArray RP System.
Simulated reactivity was based on the number and location of mismatches between the
target sequence and the assay primer(s). The table below lists the Adenovirus types that
were not tested by the FilmArray system either in analytical or clinical testing.
Bioinformatics analysis of these Adenovirus sequences indicates that the FilmArray RP
system will react with all Adenovirus species and serotypes.

b Purified and quantified RNA from avian influenza culture was obtained from BEl Resources.
Simulated reactivity of the FilmArray RP Influenza assays with additional influenza strains
of human, swine and avian origin was generated using a bioinformatics approach. Assay
primer sequences were aligned with GenBank sequences corresponding to the appropriate
gene targets and reactivity were predicated based on the number and location of mismatches
in the targeted region. For each strain, multiple (3) GenBank IDs were evaluated,
corresponding to the gene segments targeted by the FilmArray RP assays (matrix (MA),
non-structural (NS), and hemagglutinin (HA)). The strains listed in the following table are
predicted to react with the pan-influenza A and H1, H3 or 2009 H1 subtyping assays as

g. Analytical Specificity/Cross-reactivity Evaluation
An analytical exclusivity study was carried out to assess the potential for false positive results
due to cross-reactivity between RP assays and other RP or non-RP organisms. RP organisms
and non-RP organisms were tested at high concentrations and the non-RP organism
exclusivity panel consisted of organisms that are related to, but distinct from, RP target
organisms, or that could be present in specimens collected from the intended test population.
Exclusivity (cross-reactivity) testing was performed at Idaho Technology, Inc. and an
external testing site. Samples were prepared by spiking RP and non-RP target organisms into
NPS (or simulated NPS) sample matrix at a high concentration (105TCID /mL for viral
50
targets and 106 CFU/mL for bacterial targets, or the highest concentration possible based on
the organism stock).
The RP target exclusivity panel included all of the primary strains used to establish LoD
levels for the system plus additional strains of some common organisms such as Influenza A
and B. RP target organisms tested at high concentrations were positive only for the
appropriate RP assay(s). No cross-reactivity between RP assays was observed.
The following tables list all of the RP organisms tested at high concentration. The test
concentration is listed followed by the multiple of the LoD concentration the test
concentration represents.

The non-RP target exclusivity panel consisted of 26 bacteria, 6 viruses, and 1 fungus
(Candida albicans). The organisms included in the non-RP exclusivity panel were selected
either because they are related to RP target organisms, are clinically relevant (colonize the
upper respiratory tract or cause respiratory symptoms), are common skin flora or laboratory
contaminants, or are microorganisms for which much of the population may have been
infected (Herpes Simplex Virus, etc.). None of the organisms in the non-RP target
exclusivity panel tested positive by the FilmArray RP System assays except for one measles
virus strain. The false positive was found to be caused by Adenovirus contamination of the
viral stock and not due to cross-reactivity between the Adenovirus assay and Measles virus.
The following table lists all of the non-RP organisms tested at high concentration. The test
concentration is listed:

i. Supplemental Human, Swine, and Avian Host Influenza A Virus Strains
Exclusivity Information (in silico analyses):
Laboratory testing of influenza strains was supplemented with in silico predictions of
exclusivity using bioinformatics and sequence alignments between FilmArray RP assay
primers and GenBank sequences for the strains shown in the table below. Exclusivity was
predicated based on the number of and location of mismatches between assay primers and
available strain sequences. For each strain, multiple GenBank IDs were evaluated,
corresponding to the genes targeted by the FilmArray RP pan-influenza A and HA subtyping
assays. All listed strains are predicted to produce an Influenza A (no subtype detected)
FilmArray RP result.

for each of the four non-SARS coronavirus assays (CoV HKU1, CoV NL63, CoV OC43,
and CoV 229E) was conducted. When non-SARS coronavirus assay primers were aligned
with the corresponding target sequence from SARS virus, each primer contained at least 6

mismatches. Based on these alignments, no reactivity was predicted between SARS virus
and the four FilmArray RP non-SARS coronavirus assays.
h. Assay cut-off:
i. Melt Windows Determination:
Sequence diversity results in a range of melting temperatures (Tms) of the PCR2
melting curves for each of the target organism amplicons generated by the FilmArray
Respiratory Panel (RP).
A mathematical model was used to predict the melting temperatures of all known
organism variants (within NCBI databases) for each assay. The distribution of predicted
Tms was used to establish an initial melt range for each assay. In addition, the overall
system variability, including for instrument, chemistry, pouch lot and other sources of
variability, was estimated using a synthetic template melting data set generated on
various FilmArray instruments using multiple pouch lots. Historical RP Panel melting
data were also considered to establish appropriate melt ranges. In particular, the
Analytical Inclusivity data and all available patient specimen data from the clinical
evaluation sites were considered. These data sets included overall system variability and
potentially included additional organism sequence variants not accounted for in the
NCBI databases. Furthermore, data collected at the beta sites were used as an overall
check and validation for the proposed melting ranges.
For each of the pathogen assays, the lower and upper limits of the melting window was
calculated based on the minimum of the model prediction based on published sequence
variation, the clinical evaluation data, and the inclusivity data:

ii. Melt Windows Validation
The validation of the melting windows was done in two steps. First, the Tms for the data
collected at the beta sites were compared to the melting windows proposed. This
comparison did not identify any Tm outside of the proposed ranges. Second, as part of the
FilmArray RP Melt Detector Tuning, multiple data sets collected by the IVD and R&D
groups and data collected at the clinical evaluation sites were re-analyzed using the
proposed melting ranges. This validation did not identify any missed calls as a direct result
of the window location.
i. Interfering Substances:
An interference study was carried out to evaluate the influence of potential interfering
substances on the accuracy of test results obtained with the FilmArray RP System. Four
different organism mixes (refer to the tables below) containing FilmArray RP analytes were
spiked into a simulated NPS (sNPS) sample matrix (human epithelial cells in VTM) at 5x
their respective LoDs. The 5x LoD organism concentration was chosen to be near the
analyte LoD but also to provide consistent results for sample-to-sample comparison.

The potentially interfering substances tested in this study included substances that are
normally found in the nasopharynx or may be introduced into NPS specimens during
specimen collection. Endogenous substances like blood, mucin, human genomic DNA and
various infectious microorganisms were evaluated. Exogenous substances that may be
introduced into NPS specimens before or during sample collection, such as medication,
treatments, or topical applications for treating symptoms associated with respiratory
infections, were also included in this study.) In addition, materials used to collect (swabs) or
store (viral transport medium) NPS specimens or substances that could be introduced from
the clinical laboratory environment (i.e. bleach, etc.) were tested as potential technique-
specific interfering substances. The substances were spiked at a level predicted to be above
the concentration of the substance likely to be found in an authentic NPS specimen.

On each day of testing, one specimen per organism mix was not spiked with any test
substance to serve as a positive control. For biological test substances that may contain
genetic material (such as blood, mucin, DNA, microorganisms), one negative specimen
(blank sNPS sample matrix with no organism mix) was spiked with only the test substance
(negative control) to evaluate the potential for false positive results due to the test substance
itself. For each endogenous, exogenous, and technique-specific test substance, one specimen
per organism mix was spiked with the appropriate amount of test substance. All specimens
were tested with the FilmArray RP System on the day they were prepared.
None of the potentially interfering endogenous, exogenous, or technique-specific substances
tested in this study were found to affect the accuracy of respiratory pathogen detection in
simulated NPS specimens using the FilmArray RP System.
In addition to the analytical interference substances study, the first phase prospective clinical
dataset was analyzed for evidence of the effects of potentially interfering medications
(prescription and over-the-counter; OTC) administered to or taken by the study population.
If clinically significant interference from medications had occurred, it would be expected
that the analyte detection rate in the medicated population would be lower than that in the
non-medicated population. This effect was not observed in the clinical dataset. One or more
analytes was detected by the reference/comparator methods in 118 of 257 (45.9%) non-
medicated individuals. The FilmArray RP system correctly identified all analytes in 112
(94.9%) of these individuals. One or more analytes was detected by the
reference/comparator methods in 342 of 596 (57.4%) medicated individuals. The FilmArray

i. FluMist® Nasal Influenza Vaccine (MedImmune, 2009-2010 version)
Simulated nasopharyngeal swab (sNPS) specimens were spiked with dilutions of FluMist
nasal influenza vaccine (MedImmune, 2009-2010 version), resulting in final test
concentrations of 10%, 1% and 0.1% (v/v) FluMist. Each specimen was tested with the
FilmArray RP system to determine if the vaccine material would react with any of the
FilmArray RP assays. If reactivity was observed at any or all dilutions, additional dilutions
were tested until no reactivity was observed.
FluMist® Influenza Vaccine Live, Intranasal; Intranasal Spray, 2009-2010 Formula was
provided by the manufacturer (MedImmune). The material was provided as individual
sprayers containing a single 0.2mL dose. Each dose contains approximately 106.5-7.5 FFU
(fluorescence focus units) each of three live, attenuated influenza virus reassortants

including: A/SouthDakota/6/2007 (H1N1) (A/Brisbane/59/2007-like), A/Uraguay/716/2007
(H3N2) (A/Brisbane/10/2007- like), and B/Brisbane/60/2008. Non-viral components of the
vaccine listed in the provided materials include: monosodium glutamate, gelatin, arginine,
sucrose, gentamicin sulfate, monobasic potassium phosphate and dibasic potassium
phosphate. (Note: For the 2009-2010 respiratory season, a separate 2009 H1N1 variant
vaccine was prepared and administered. The 2009 H1N1 variant vaccine material was not
provided by the manufacturer for testing with the FilmArray RP system.)
Positive results were obtained for Influenza A/H1, Influenza A/H3, and Influenza B in each
of the samples tested at 10%, 1% and 0.1% (v/v) FluMist®. Additional dilutions were made
and tested until each of the Influenza viruses could no longer be detected by the FilmArray
RP system (0.0001% for Influenza A H1, 0.00001% for Influenza A H3 and 0.000001% for
Influenza B). There was no reactivity with the Influenza A/2009 H1N1 subtyping assay,
which specifically detects the pandemic 2009 A/H1 variant and was not included in the
2009-2010 FluMist® formulation.
This reactivity is documented in the FilmArray RP System product package insert as a
limitation, i.e., “The performance of the FilmArray RP has not been established in
individuals who received influenza vaccine. Recent administration of a nasal influenza
vaccine may cause false positive results for Influenza A and/or Influenza B.”
j. Carry-Over Contamination
An analytical carry-over study was carried out to demonstrate that when recommended
laboratory practices are followed, there is little risk of false positive results caused by
carryover or cross-contamination in the FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) System. The data
for this study were generated as part the exclusivity testing examining the potential for cross-
reactivity between Respiratory Panel targets and assays. The majority of testing was
performed by new users at a contracted laboratory as part of an early performance evaluation
of the FilmArray RP system. Multiple spiked NPS (or simulated NPS) samples containing
high levels of organism (approximately 105 for viruses) were tested over several days using 2
FilmArray instruments. Each sample was prepared and loaded into a RP pouch one at a time
in a work area (biosafety cabinet or hood) that was separated from the location of the
FilmArray instrument(s), and regular cleaning of the work area and pouch loading station
were carried out according to the recommended testing procedures. Consecutive testing of
the same organism was discouraged in order to maximize the potential for detecting false
positive results due to carryover from a previously tested sample. Over 60 RP target
organism spiked samples were tested in a total of 63 valid runs, and at least half of the
samples were tested subsequently to a sample containing a different target organism at high
concentration. No false positive results were reported (100% negative agreement). The
consecutive set-up and testing of samples containing high concentrations of different target
organisms demonstrated that these practices are effective in preventing false positive results
due to carryover between samples.
Because the PCR2 array in each FilmArray pouch contains over 100 individual PCR
reaction wells in close proximity, the possibility of well-to-well carryover was also
examined. Individual false positive melt curves could be generated if (1) reaction material
(template and rehydrated assay specific primers) carried over into an adjacent well early in
second stage PCR cycling, or (2) amplicon from one well entered a neighboring well prior
81

--- Page 82 ---
to melt analysis. The 63 valid test results described above (over 6000 reaction wells with no
false positive organism or assay results) were examined well-by-well and 4 false positive
melt curves were observed as a result of carryover between neighboring wells. Each
carryover event produced a single positive reaction well per assay and had no effect on the
overall accuracy of the FilmArray RP results. This well-to-well carryover analysis resulted
in an overall % negative agreement of 99.9% with the 95%CI of 99.9% to100.0%
(5342/5346 expected negative wells).
Combined, these results indicated that when proper laboratory practices are followed, the
risk of false positive FilmArray RP test results due to sample cross- contamination or well-
to-well carryover is insignificant.
k. Simulated NPS Sample Matrix Validation Study
A nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) is the intended sample type to be used with the FilmArray RP
system. A NPS is collected from an individual by inserting a flexible, fine-shafted synthetic
swab into the nostril and back to the nasopharynx. After a few seconds, the swab is slowly
withdrawn with a rotating motion and the swab is placed into a vial containing
approximately 3 mL of viral transport medium (VTM). Once in VTM, vortexing helps to
release the material collected by the swab (human cells, viral particles, bacteria, secretions,
etc.) into the medium, which is then used as the test sample.
A series of studies was required to demonstrate the analytical performance characteristics of
the FilmArray RP system. For these types of studies, the ideal sample matrix is NPS
collected from healthy individuals that does not contain nucleic acid from any of the
pathogens detected by the panel. Initially, sample matrix for contrived samples was
obtained by collecting NPS from donors at Idaho Technology, Inc (ITI). Each donor
claimed to be healthy and free of symptoms associated with respiratory infection on the day
the NPS was collected. Individual NPS were screened with the FilmArray RP system prior
to use in the studies, to confirm that the sample matrix was negative for RP organisms.
This process began in the early fall of 2009, at the onset of the typical respiratory season,
and it was found during screening that respiratory pathogens could be detected in some
percentage of healthy donor NPS. For example, over 2 months of collection (November –
December 2009), about 9% of the screened NPS were positive for one or more FilmArray
RP analytes. Some weeks, the rate was as high as 26%. This pattern continued through the
respiratory season with a positivity rate of nearly 12% from January to March 2010.
Furthermore, even after the initial screening for negativity, false positive results were
occasionally detected in contrived samples and the false positive organism could often be
traced to the sample matrix.

The NPS being screened were collected from donors at ITI, following an IRB- approved
protocol. Under the terms of the protocol, the NPS specimens were de- identified. No
personal information was collected from the donors and no test results could be traced back
to the donor. As a result, if a NPS was positive for one or more RP organisms during
screening, it was not possible to follow-up with the donor to inquire about signs of infection
prior to or in the days following the date of donation.
Given the very large number of contrived samples needed for analytical studies, it became
apparent that use of a sample matrix of NPS collected from donors would be problematic.
Most importantly, the true negativity of the matrix could not be adequately confirmed, which
placed the accuracy and integrity of analytical studies at risk. Consequently, the use of a
simulated NPS matrix was investigated. The intent was for the simulated NPS to resemble
the content of an actual NPS as closely as possible, while ensuring that the simulated NPS
was free of respiratory pathogens and did not alter the performance of the system.
Ten-fold dilutions of HeLa cells in VTM were prepared (from a starting concentration of 2
x 105 cells/mL) and tested with the FilmArray system both fresh and after being stored
frozen (-20°C) for one week. Results were compared to NPS collected from healthy donors
and an appropriate cell concentration for the simulated NPS was chosen by comparison of
Cp values for the hRNA assay (targets mRNA of the human beta-catenin gene) between
the true and artificial sample matrices. Once a human cell concentration was selected,
contrived samples containing multiple live respiratory pathogens at or near the estimated
system LoD were prepared in both NPS and simulated NPS sample matrices. The organism

Crossing point (Cp) values of amplification curves generated for all positive assays were
also used to compare results from samples prepared in NPS and simulated NPS sample
matrices. (Note: Though the use of Cp values in this study was helpful in making
comparisons, since the FilmArray RP is a qualitative rather than quantitative system, and
the FilmArray RP uses two-stage nested PCR: Cps are therefore inherently more variable
than Cps in traditional real-time PCR systems, the significance of these numbers can not be
over-interpreted.). A difference of 3 cycles or less was considered equivalent when
comparing mean Cp values between NPS and simulated NPS for the hRNA and organism
assays.
All samples tested (NPS and simulated NPS) were negative for all panel organisms and
positive amplification and melt curves were recorded for the hRNA assay. Average Cp values
for the hRNA assay were calculated for each sample type and plotted for comparison. The Cp
values observed for the NPS (20.5 –27.1) were consistent with historical data from NPS
screening. The average Cp of the hRNA assay was similar for fresh and frozen simulated
NPS dilutions. The average Cp for NPS was most similar to the Cp values obtained with
simulated NPS prepared at a concentration of 2 x 103 cells/mL. Based on this analysis, a
concentration of 2 x 103 HeLa cells/mL in VTM was selected as the composition of simulated
NPS.
Comparison of results for FilmArray RP assays between NPS and simulated NPS sample
matrices is presented below:

a Range of delta mean Cp for the HRV I, HRV2, HRV3, and HRV4 assays.
b The delta mean Cp shown is for the FluA-HI and FluA-H3 subtyping assays only. Delta mean Cp was 1.48 for
the FluA-panl assay and 1.07 for the FluA-pan2 assay.
The study generated no false positive results, and the results demonstrated that the
sensitivity of the FilmArray RP system was comparable between samples prepared in
nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and simulated NPS sample matrices. This sample matrix was
then used in analytical performance studies of the FilmArray RP system in place of NPS
collected from donors. Prior to use, all freshly prepared simulated NPS were screened with
the FilmArray RP system to confirm that the hRNA assay provides the expected Cp values
and that the sample matrix was negative for all RP organisms.
l. Comparator Assays Analytical Validation Studies
In the prospective clinical trial for the FilmArray RP System, the FilmArray results were
compared to the results from standard viral culture and fluorescent antibody testing
performed by the clinical sites for several of the common viruses (Adenovirus, Influenza A,
Influenza B, Parainfluenza Virus 3, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus). The majority of the
remaining pathogens required 2 PCR comparator assays which were tested directly from
the NPS specimens. The exception to this was Influenza A subtyping, which was tested
from viral culture material with 1 assay per virus:

Analytically validated PCR followed by bi-directional sequencing assays that target
different sequences from those used in the FilmArray pouch were used by ITI as part of a
pre-defined composite comparator method for assays in the FilmArray RP system.
ITI relied on its own Research & Development and Regulated Products groups to develop
and validate all of the comparator PCR tests used in this study. All assays were designed to
provide adequate amplicon length for sequencing while still being able to specifically
detect the organisms of interest. Some viruses possess few regions to which a specific PCR
assay can be targeted; this limited amplicon length and gene target choice in some
instances. However, all comparator assays were designed to amplify a different sequence
from that amplified by the FilmArray assay(s).

A retrospective clinical evaluation of the FilmArray RP system was performed at ITI to
supplement the prospective evaluation data. In this study, retrospective pre- selected
archived specimens were further validated/confirmed by PCR assays followed by
sequencing analysis, and then tested with the FilmArray RP system.
Because it is possible that the provided samples had been misidentified, had degraded
during storage or contained additional pathogens (such as Rhinovirus) not identified by the
source laboratory, the presence of the expected analyte or the absence of the analytes was
confirmed using analytically validated “validation” PCR assays for the analytes in the
specific panel. These “validation” PCR assays are summarized in the table below:

3. Clinical studies:
a. Prospective Clinical Study
The clinical performance of the FilmArray RP system was evaluated during a prospective
study at 3 U.S. clinical laboratories. In the first phase of the prospective clinical study, NP
swab samples were collected and tested at 3 U.S. clinical laboratories (Sites 1, 2, and 3)
during December, 2009 through May, 2010 (2009/2010 respiratory season),. In the second
phase of the prospective clinical study, patient enrollment and NP swab sample collection
and testing were carried out at 2 of the 3 sites (Sites 2 and 3) for an additional 5 month
time period, September, 2010 through January, 2011, (2010/2011 respiratory season), in an
effort to achieve increased detection of several low prevalence analytes (i.e., PIV1, PIV2,
and PIV4) during the anticipated peak season for PIV1 and PIV2. Clinical study sites were
chosen based upon the expertise of the principal investigators, the quality of their
personnel and laboratory resources, and the desired geographic/demographic variation of
the potential subject populations.

Three geographically separated clinical study sites participated in the clinical evaluation of
the FilmArray RP system. The study sites were located in the Southeast (Charleston, SC),
the Southwest (Dallas, TX), and the Midwest (Detroit, MI). The size of the population in
these locations ranges from approximately 107,000 in Charleston, SC, to approximately
1.2 million in Dallas, TX (source: U.S. Census Bureau). Each study location was
representative of the intended use setting (clinical laboratories) and testing was performed
by trained clinical laboratory personnel.
The study sites enrolled subjects from diverse demographic groups. Site 1 enrolled subjects
from an adult emergency department. Site 2 enrolled primarily children from the
emergency department, but also enrolled immunocompromised adults from an outpatient
bone marrow transplant clinic (approximately 10% of the enrolled subjects at this site).
Site 3 enrolled subjects from a pediatric emergency department and associated urgent care
clinic.
A total of 1144 subjects were initially enrolled in the prospective study. Eight hundred fifty
seven (857) subjects were initially enrolled in the 2009/2010 respiratory season and 4 (3 at
Site 1 and 1 at Site 3) were withdrawn. Another 287 subjects were enrolled in the
2010/2011 respiratory season and 20 specimens from Site 2 were excluded from data
analysis due to improper specimen storage prior to testing. Three (3) specimens from Site 3
were without valid external control mix results acquired (a clinical protocol deviation), and
therefore excluded from data analysis.
The following table provides a summary of demographic information for the 1117
subjects that participated in the combined prospective study (2009/2010 respiratory
season and 2010/2011 respiratory season), and were included in the data analysis:

All specimens used in the study were prospectively collected from subjects with
signs/symptoms of respiratory infection including but not limited to fever, cough, sore
throat, runny/stuffy nose, myalgia, earache, headache, chills, or fatigue. The subject may or
may not have had respiratory infection testing ordered by a physician. Written informed
consent was acquired from each subject and/or their parent/guardian (if under 18) at the
time of enrollment into the prospective study. After informed consent was acquired, the
subject was assigned a Volunteer Identification Number (VIN). The VIN was used to de-
identify the specimen used for FilmArray testing and to provide data to the sponsor. A key
that connected the subject’s identity to their assigned VIN was maintained in a secure
location at each site in order to facilitate the tracking of standard of care testing and for
monitoring purposes. Access to this key was limited to the study coordinator or laboratory
supervisor at each site. At the time of enrollment the following information was recorded
on the Case Report Form (CRF): 1) Age and sex; 2) Information about their suspected
respiratory infection, i.e. signs and symptoms, date of onset; and 3) Current medications
(self-reported and/or collected from medical records).
Two respiratory specimens were collected from each enrolled subject. One specimen (NPS
or other standard specimen type, such as nasal aspirate/wash, used by the study site) was

used for standard of care testing and for viral culture to detect seven common respiratory
viruses (Adenovirus, Flu A, Flu B, PIV1, 2, and 3, and RSV). A frozen aliquot of viral
culture material was prepared for comparator PCR/sequencing testing. The second
specimen, a NPS in 3 mL of viral transport media (VTM) was used for FilmArray testing
according to the Instructions for Use and was aliquoted and frozen for further comparator
PCR/sequencing testing. Individual specimens were delinked from all patient identifiers
and given a study sample code.
Reference and comparator methods used to assess the performance of the FilmArray RP
system include viral culture followed by fluorescent antibody identification for common
viruses (Adenovirus, Flu A, Flu B, PIV1, PIV2, PIV3, and RSV), viral culture followed by
1 analytically validated PCR assay with bi-directional sequence confirmation (Flu A
subtyping and PIV4), and a composite comparator method of 2 analytically validated PCR
assays with bi-directional sequence confirmation (all other panel analytes):

cells and mink lung Mv1Lu cells) incubated for up to 72 hours. Site 2 used traditional cell
culture format, employing three separately inoculated cell lines (primary rhesus monkey
kidney pRhMK cells, human epidermoid carcinoma Hep-2 cells, and human lung fibroblast
MRC5 cells) incubated for up to 14 days. Each site confirmed the presence or absence of
the viruses (Adenovirus, Flu A, Flu B, PIV1, PIV2, PIV3, and RSV) using a FDA-cleared
direct fluorescent antibody method (D3 Ultra Viral Respiratory Screening and ID Kit;
Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc.).
Frozen aliquots of viral culture material and NPS specimens were shipped to ITI on a
weekly basis for comparator PCR/sequencing testing. PCR testing was performed by ITI
research associates in a blinded manner; specimens were labeled only with the subject’s
VIN and the FilmArray results were not available to them. A bi-directional sequencing
result for each comparator PCR positive result was required to demonstrate sequence
identity with the target organism. All comparator PCR assays were designed at ITI to
provide adequate amplicon length for sequencing while still being able to detect the
organisms of interest. The assays were also designed to amplify a different sequence from
that amplified by the FilmArray assay(s). None of the comparator PCR assays overlapped
any FilmArray amplicon sequence even if the same gene was targeted. PCR plates
containing potentially positive amplicons were not opened at ITI; they were sent directly to
the contract sequencing laboratory, for ExoSAP clean up and bi-directional sequencing.
Sequencing results that met acceptance criteria (i.e., a minimum of 99% accuracy for at
least 90% of the sequence, Phred quality score of 20 or higher) were recorded as positive
for the specific analyte.
Performance of the FilmArray RP system detecting Adenovirus, Flu A, Flu B, PIV1, PIV2,
PIV3, or RSV, respectively, was compared to viral culture followed by fluorescent
antibody identification. “True” Adenovirus, Influenza A, Influenza B, Parainfluenza Virus
1, Parainfluenza Virus 2, Parainfluenza Virus 3, or RSV positives, respectively, were
considered as any sample that was tested positive for Adenovirus, Influenza A, Influenza B,
Parainfluenza Virus 1, Parainfluenza Virus 2, Parainfluenza Virus 3, or RSV, respectively,
by viral culture followed by DFA testing. “True” Adenovirus, Influenza A, Influenza B,
Parainfluenza Virus 1, Parainfluenza Virus 2, Parainfluenza Virus 3, or RSV negatives,
respectively, were considered as any sample that was tested negative for Adenovirus,
Influenza A, Influenza B, Parainfluenza Virus1, Parainfluenza Virus 2, Parainfluenza Virus
3, or RSV, respectively, by viral culture followed by DFA testing.
Performance of the FilmArray RP system detecting Influenza A/H1, A/H3, A/2009 H1N1, or
Parainfluenza Virus 4, respectively, was compared to viral culture followed by one
analytically validated PCR assay with bi-directional sequence confirmation. The comparator
assays were designed to amplify a different sequence from that amplified by the FilmArray
assay(s). None of the comparator PCR assays overlapped any FilmArray amplicon sequence
even if the same gene was targeted. “True” Influenza A/H1, A/H3, A/2009 H1N1 positives,
respectively, were considered as any sample that was tested positive for Influenza A by viral
culture, and had bi-directional sequencing data meeting pre-defined quality acceptance
criteria that matched Influenza A/H1, A/H3, or A/2009 H1N1 sequences deposited in the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank database
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), respectively, with acceptable E-values. “True” Influenza A/H1,
A/H3, or A/2009 H1N1 negatives, respectively, were considered as any sample that was
100

--- Page 101 ---
tested negative for Influenza A by viral culture, or any sample that was tested positive for
Influenza A virus by viral culture, but was tested negative by the respective Influenza A
subtype specific PCR assay. “True” Parainfluenza Virus 4 positives were considered as any
sample for which bi-directional sequencing data meeting pre-defined quality acceptance
criteria that matched Parainfluenza Virus 4 sequences deposited in the NCBI Genbank
database with acceptable alignment E-values was obtained from testing of viral culture
material. “True” Parainfluenza Virus 4 negatives were considered as any sample where
testing of viral culture material with a Parainfluenza Virus 4 specific PCR assay was negative.
The E-value ranges generated from the clinical trial per organism were presented in the
following table:
E-values for Clinical Trial Organisms
Organism E-value Low E-value High

Performance of the FilmArray RP system for detecting Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila
pneumoniae, Coronavirus HKU1, Coronavirus NL63, Coronavirus OC43, Coronavirus 229E,
Enterovirus, Human Metapneumovirus, Human Rhinovirus, or Mycoplasma pneumoniae,
respectively, was compared to a predetermined algorithm that used composite comparator
methods. The composite reference methods consist of two analytically validated PCR assays
followed by bi-directional genetic sequencing. The comparator assays were designed to
amplify a different sequence from that amplified by the FilmArray assay(s). None of the
comparator PCR assays overlapped any FilmArray amplicon sequence even if the same gene
was targeted. “True” Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Coronavirus HKU1,
Coronavirus NL63, Coronavirus OC43, Coronavirus 229E, Enterovirus, Human
Metapneumovirus, Human Rhinovirus, or Mycoplasma pneumoniae positives, respectively,
were considered as any sample that had bi-directional sequencing data meeting pre-defined
quality acceptance criteria that matched Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae,

The E-Value from NCBI BLAST Alignment indicates the statistical significance of a given
pair-wise alignment and reflects the size of the database and the scoring system used. The
lower is the E-Value, the more significant is the match. A sequence alignment in GenBank
that has an E-Value of 1e-3 means that this similarity has a 1 in 1000 chance of occurring
by chance alone. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=handbook.section.614).
Performance of the FilmArray RP system detecting Adenovirus, Influenza A, Influenza B,
RSV, Influenza A/H1, Influenza A/H3, Influenza A/2009 H1N1, Human Rhinovirus,
Enterovirus, Coronavirus NL63, Coronavirus HKU1, Human Metapneumovirus, or
Parainfluenza Virus 3 were evaluated and established during the first phase of the
prospective clinical study (data from a total of 853 subjects from the 2009/2010 respiratory
season). Performance of the FilmArray RP system detecting Bordetella pertussis,
Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Coronavirus OC43, Coronavirus 229E, Mycoplasma
pneumoniae, Parainfluenza Virus 1, Parainfluenza Virus 2, or Parainfluenza Virus 4 were
evaluated during the first and the second phases of the prospective clinical study (combined
data of a total of 1117 subjects - a total of 853 subjects from the 2009/2010 respiratory
season and a total of 264 subjects from the 2010/2011 respiratory season). During the second
phase of the prospective clinical study (2010/2011 respiratory season), only the
reference/comparator methods for Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae,
Coronavirus OC43, Coronavirus 229E, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Parainfluenza Virus 1,
Parainfluenza Virus 2, or Parainfluenza Virus 4 were performed on all specimens and used

i. Prospective Clinical Study FilmArray Software and Instrument, and
Pouch Controls Performance Analysis
A total of 1117 prospective clinical specimens were tested and analyzed during the first
phase and the second phases of the prospective clinical evaluation (2009/2010 respiratory
season and 2010/2011 respiratory season). Of the 1117 analyzed prospective clinical
specimens, 94.6% (1057/1117) of these specimens yielded valid results on the first attempt
(i.e., first loaded pouch). Invalid results or no results were obtained for the remaining 60
(5.4%) specimens (no results for 24 specimens due to incomplete runs; 36 specimens were
“invalid” due to Pouch Control failures). Of the 24 incomplete runs, 3 were aborted by users
(0.3%); 6 were due to software-related errors (0.6%) and 15 were due to instrument errors
(1.3%). Fifty-seven (57) of the 60 initially failed (no results or invalid) specimens yielded
valid results after a single retest using a new pouch/sample. The remaining three (3)
specimens failed on the second attempt (2 due to failed Pouch Controls, 1 due to an

ii. Prospective Clinical Study FilmArray Pouch Performance Analysis
The FilmArray RP pouch is manufactured to contain a vacuum that draws in the required
amount of Hydration Solution and Sample/Buffer Mix when the seals are broken by the
cannula-tipped syringes in each of the pouch ports. If either the Hydration Solution or the
Sample/Buffer Mix is not drawn into the pouch, the operator is instructed to discard the
faulty pouch and obtain a new pouch to test the specimen. Out of 1281 pouches used in the
first phase of the prospective clinical evaluation (2009/2010 respiratory season), thirty-seven
(37/1281; 2.9%) failed to draw Hydration Solution or Sample/Buffer Mix. However, the
majority (31/37) of these failures occurred early in the evaluation (December, 2009 through
early February, 2010). Out of 521 pouches used in the second phase of the prospective
clinical study (2010/2011 respiratory season), ten (10) (10/521; 1.9%) failed to draw
Hydration Solution or Sample/Buffer Mix. It has been observed that an operator can partially
break a port seal, leading to loss of vacuum and failure to draw the solution. It may also be
possible for a pouch to be manufactured with a faulty port seal or reduced vacuum. A
decrease in the rate of this failure type over time suggested that either pouch manufacturing

improved or the operators became more adept at reliably puncturing the port seals.
During the first phase of the prospective clinical evaluation, one operator observed a leak in a
pouch when it was removed from the instrument after testing (1/1244 loaded pouches =
0.08% failure rate). The pouches are manufactured from durable materials able to withstand
the manipulations performed by the instrument; however, an occasional small rupture or tear
may occur. Following discovery of the pouch leak, the operator followed recommended
decontamination procedures and performed contamination surveillance swab testing of the
area surrounding the instrument. No contamination was detected. No pouch leaks were
observed in the second phase of the prospective clinical study.
iii. Prospective Clinical Study External Controls Performance Analysis
Four (4) frozen (-70°C) control mixes were provided to the study sites for daily testing
during the first phase of the prospective clinical study (2009/2010 respiratory season).
Three control mixes contained pooled NPS specimens spiked with whole virus with some
plasmid DNA for hard to acquire organisms. Combined, the 3 mixes covered all panel
analytes. A fourth mix was negative for all panel members and only contained pooled NPS:

The operators were required to complete a valid control mix run (correct results obtained)
prior to beginning patient sample testing on each testing day. A total of 300 control mix runs
were attempted during the first phase of the prospective clinical study (2009/2010
respiratory season). Seventeen (17) runs did not complete and 6 runs had failed pouch
control(s). Of the remaining 277 runs (site 1, 99 runs; site 2, 70 runs; and site 3, 108 runs), 7
(site 1, 1 run; site 2, 2 runs; and site 3, 4 runs) (7/277; 2.5%) did not return the correct
organism results either due to the detection of an extra analyte (4/7) and/or the failure to
detect one or more spiked analytes (4/7). These failures may be due to low level virus from
the NPS donors, introduction of contamination during the preparation or testing of the
samples, or improper handling of the frozen aliquots.
Four external controls were used by study sites for daily testing during the second phase of
the prospective clinical study (2010/2011 respiratory season). Three of the controls were
freeze-dried, room-temperature stable, synthetic RNA mixes that were rehydrated with
Hydration Solution prior to being tested. Synthetic RNA mixes were used in the second
phase of the clinical study due to several more organisms becoming difficult to obtain in the
concentrations necessary for high volume external control testing. Instead of including more
plasmids in the control mixes, validated synthetic RNA mixes were used. The RNA mixes

The operators were required to complete a valid control mix run (correct results obtained)
prior to beginning patient sample testing on each testing day. A total of 137 control mix runs
were attempted during the second phase of the prospective clinical study (2010/2011
respiratory season). Seventeen (17) runs did not complete and 3 had failed pouch control(s).
Of the remaining 117 runs (site 2, 61 runs; and site 3, 56 runs), 14 (site 2, 6 runs; and site 3, 8
runs) (14/117; 12.0%) did not return the correct organism results either due to the detection
of an extra analyte (1/14) and/or the failure to detect one or more spiked analytes (13/14).
These failures may be due to introduction of contamination during the preparation or testing
of the samples, improper/incomplete rehydration of the control mixes, or introduction of
RNases into the synthetic RNA control mixes during rehydration.
iv. Prospective Clinical Study Environmental Contamination Surveillance
Analysis
The FilmArray RP system is a closed system; all steps require no user manipulation.
This dramatically reduces the possibility of contamination from environmental material
or amplicon during the testing process. However, it is still possible for contaminants to
be introduced during pouch loading. To determine if environmental contamination of
workstations might interfere with the accuracy of test results, during the first phase of the
prospective clinical study, FilmArray operators were instructed to perform contamination
surveillance swab testing at least weekly and following any pouch leaks. Forty (40) total
swab test runs were attempted; 35 of the runs completed and the controls passed. No
contamination was detected in any of the swab tests indicating that the routine cleaning
procedures recommended in the clinical trial protocol are sufficient to prevent false
positive test results caused by environmental contamination of workstations used for
preparing pouches. These routine cleaning procedures were recommended in the package

v. Prospective Clinical Study Mixed Infection Analysis
The FilmArray RP system detected a total of 94 mixed infections in the first phase of the
prospective clinical evaluation performed from December 2009 to May 2010 (853 tested
and analyzed specimens). This represents 18.0% of the total positive specimens (94/524).
Eighty-seven (87/94; 92.6%) double infections, 6 (6/94; 6.3%) triple infections, and one
quadruple infection (1/94; 1.1%) were observed. The total number of test results comprising
these co- infections was 189. The single most common co-infection (20/94; 21.1%) was
Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus with Respiratory Syncytial Virus. These viruses were the
most prevalent in the tested population. Out of the 94 co-infections, 54 contained one or
more analytes that had not been detected with the reference/comparator methods, i.e.,
discrepant co-infection.

a A discrepant co-infection or discrepant analyte was defined as one that was detected by FilmArray RP but not
detected by the reference/comparator methods or by discrepancy investigation using bi-directional sequence analysis.
Sixty-five (65) analytes from 54 of the 94 co-infections were not detected by the reference/comparator methods.
Forty-four (44) were investigated using bi-directional sequence analysis with an alternate assay; in 37 cases the
investigative assay successfully identified the analyte in the specimen.

vi. Retrospective Clinical Study: Study 299
A retrospective clinical evaluation of the FilmArray RP system was performed at ITI to
supplement the prospective evaluation data. In this study, retrospective pre-selected archived
specimens were first validated/confirmed by PCR/sequencing analysis, and then tested with
the FilmArray RP system. Samples for this study included 508 retrospective pre-selected
archived specimens. Most specimens had previous positive test results for selected organisms
of interest from the source sites. Several negative specimens (as determined at the source
sites) were also included in the retrospective sample set.
These retrospective archived samples were characterized previously at the source sites using
a variety of methods including DSFA, bacterial culture, viral culture followed by DFA,
Luminex X-TAG RVP, and Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) PCR assays. Upon arrival at
ITI, a 4-digit study number (VIN) was assigned to each sample and a key was created in
order to group samples together into panels by organism. The organism panel was
randomized such that the users testing the samples with the FilmArray RP were blinded as
to the expected test result. Specimens were organized into “test panels” such that specimens
positive for a particular analyte could serve as a negative for another analyte, allowing for
calculations of negative percent agreement (NPA). Additional negative specimens were also
included in each panel. There were 5 different panels, labeled 4 through 8, as indicated in
the following table:
Testing Panels for Study 299
Panel # Organisms Number of Samples
Influenza A/H1, A/H3, A/2009, H1N1,
4 178
Influenza B, and Negatives

Negatives
Adenovirus, Bordetella pertussis, and
6 74
Negatives
7 Parainfluenza Virus 4 and Negatives 20
8 Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Negatives 95
Because it is possible that the provided samples had been misidentified, had degraded during
storage, or contained additional pathogens (such as Rhinovirus) not identified by the source
laboratory, the presence of the expected analyte or the absence of the analytes was confirmed
using analytically validated ‘validation’ PCR assays for the analytes in the specific panel.
(Note that while some validation assays share the same gene target as the FilmArray RP

were considered as any sample that had bi- directional sequencing data meeting pre-defined

If this “validation” testing did not confirm the presence of the expected organism in the
sample, it was not analyzed further as this result may have reflected that the sample had
been improperly labeled or handled. If additional pathogens were identified in the sample
(those not identified by the source laboratory), the samples was also omitted from the
analysis for that specific analyte. Due to a large number of samples for Bordetella
pertussis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae that failed validation, supplemental specimens
were tested and additional analyses performed (see separate sections regarding M.
pneumoniae Testing and B. pertussis Testing, below). Of the 508 samples, the expected
result (positive for reported organism, or negative for presumed negative specimens) was
confirmed for 426 of 508 specimens using “validation” PCR assays and sequencing (the
identity of 82 specimens could not be confirmed). Data collected from “validation” PCR
assays showed that specimens contained a broad range of analyte concentrations for all
organisms tested (based on Cp value distribution).
Validated/confirmed specimens were then analyzed on the FilmArray RP. The identity of
the specimens was unknown to the FilmArray operators. If a FilmArray error was
encountered or if a pouch failed, residual NPS specimen (when available) was used to
retest the sample. Of the 426 specimens, 418 were analyzed; 8 specimens were not run
due to instrument and software errors or pouch sample control failures. (These are
excluded from data analysis due to insufficient volumes to retest these specimens.)

FilmArray pouch failure) and B. pertussis positive specimens.

M. pneumoniae by PCR-testing at outside facilities were obtained as part of Study 299
(tested as Panel 8). Specimens were obtained from three outside sources and analyzed with
27 M. pneumoniae negative specimens from the original prospective study. No clinical
information regarding patient characteristics from the positive specimens was provided other

than that the nasopharyngeal swab specimens were obtained primarily from children.
All 95 specimens underwent confirmation testing prior to FilmArray testing. Confirmation
testing was performed by detecting the presence of the M. pneumoniae tuf gene by PCR with
bi-directional sequencing; confirmation testing was by a single assay, not by two assays as
was performed in the original prospective study). Of the 68 presumed positive specimens, 42
were confirmed as positive with a median Cp value of 33.2, range 25.0 – 40.0. All 27 of the
negative samples were confirmed as negative.

a Twenty-six of the original 68 presumed positive samples by
testing at outside facilities were not confirmed.
The sponsor was subsequently able to obtain an additional twenty (20) presumed positive
samples from another outside source and test them along with sixteen (16) negative samples
as an additional panel (Panel 9). No clinical information regarding patient characteristics
from the positive specimens was provided other than that the nasopharyngeal swab
specimens were obtained from ‘mostly children.’ For the negative specimens, 63% were
from female donors with a median age of 27 (range 3 – 83 years.).
Confirmation testing of these samples, also performed as above, yielded the following:

a Four of the original 20 presumed positive samples for testing at outside facilities

Due to the high overall unconfirmed rate (30 of 88 specimens were anticipated to be positive),
additional testing was performed on 24 of the 30 unconfirmed specimens with sufficient
material available for serial retesting. The first stage of additional testing included repeating
the original tuf gene assay with a larger sample volume (14 µL compared to 10 µL for the
original specimen testing); of the 24 specimens tested, 20 remained negative with 4
additional positive specimens confirmed by bi-directional sequencing. The remaining 20
unconfirmed specimens were tested by a second validated PCR assay for GyrB; from this
second stage of testing, an additional 4 samples tested positive and were confirmed by bi-
directional sequencing. Overall, of the original 30 ‘unconfirmed specimens’, 8 were
considered confirmed as positive and 22 negative. All samples were then included in the

(n = 36, panel 9). For these analyses, all samples confirmed by the additional’
testing are considered reference positive; unconfirmed samples are considered
reference test negative. Two specimens lost due to run failures were not included
b Due to a processing error, most of the residual specimen volume for several
specimens was discarded. When these samples were needed for retesting due to run
errors, the limited residual volume for these specimens needed to be diluted
approximately 3-fold for there to be sufficient material for retesting. Two of the
specimens that were negative by FilmArray testing but positive by Reference testing
were diluted 3-fold before FilmArray testing.
c Twenty-two (22) M. pneumoniae-negative specimens were originally identified by
the source lab as positive for M. pneumoniae but this could not be confirmed by
analyte specific PCR followed by bidirectional sequencing. Seven (7) of these
specimens were positive when tested with the FilmArray RP.
Several explanations for the low NPA rate are noted by the sponsor, including the possibility
that nucleic acid concentration in the specimens were affected by the freezing of specimens
to levels below detection by the ‘confirmation’ assays and that not all specimens referred to
as ‘positive’ were true positives (i.e., ‘positive’ specimens from one site were second
specimens from patients who had tested positive on a different specimen). The sponsor finds
support for the former hypothesis by noting that 5/8 false positive results were the highest Cp
values of all positive specimens.
The following table summarizes results if only samples confirmed by the original single
assay M. pneumoniae tuf are included:

viii. Additional Bordetella pertussis Testing
The FilmArray prospective clinical trial identified only six (6) B. pertussis FilmArray
positive/reference method confirmed specimens (6/1117). To supplement this limited number
of samples, the sponsor obtained 33 additional B. pertussis specimens identified as positive
during an investigation of a B. pertussis outbreak as part of Study 299, however, only 19 of
these specimens were confirmed as containing B. pertussis by validation testing, i.e., by a
composite of two PCR assays with bi-directional sequencing. The results for these 19
specimens (two of these 19 specimens did not yield valid FilmArray results, yielding 17
positive specimens) were compared with results from FilmArray testing, and are described
on page 125 above with other results from Study 299.
To address the uncertainty due to the large percentage of samples that could not be verified in
the original 33 ‘presumed’ positive specimens (summarized on page 123 above), the sponsor
obtained an additional 64 specimens that had tested positive for B. pertussis using PCR
targeting the IS481 insertion element (cycle threshold (Cp) range: 12.1 - 34.7) from a 2010-
2011 outbreak investigation at a California facility. These specimens were tested in a blinded
fashion with 50 specimens from patients with suspected pertussis but negative for IS481 by
PCR testing at a separate outside facility. Average patient age, when available, was 7.2 years,
median age 6, and range from 6 months to 91 years.
Confirmation/reference testing was performed on all specimens using the following assays:

a Assays labeled as ‘Published’ were assays developed by the sponsor following published CDC protocols for
IS481 and ptxS1. Separate analyses demonstrated similar sensitivity for these assays when compared to the
sponsor’s Bspp07 and Bspp09 assays.
Specimens that were negative for all four assays were considered negative for analysis. The
following algorithm was used for evaluating specimens positive by at least one assay:
Confirmation Algorithm for Positive Archived Specimens

In essence, specimens were identified as positive if sequencing results for either Bspp07 or
Bspp09 were positive. Following this algorithm, 54 of the original 64 samples were
confirmed as positive. Samples not confirmed as positive included the following:

a According to the published CDC protocol for interpreting B. pertussis results with the IS481 and ptxS1
assays, the IS481 assay is considered positive if the Cp value is below 35. Any Cp value equal to or greater
than 35 but less than 40 cycles considered indeterminate; a value of 40 or greater is considered negative.
b Specimen 5805-3060 was positive by PCR for amplification of Bspp07 but this result could not be
confirmed by bi-directional sequencing.
c Specimens 5805-3081 and 5805-3096 were found to be positive for B. holmesii during subsequent
discrepancy analysis investigation.
Confirmation testing also determined two of the originally ‘negative’ specimens to be
positive for B. pertussis:

During confirmation testing, samples that were not validated were analyzed as negative, i.e.,
10 samples originally identified as positive at the outside site were considered negative for
the analysis; this is in contrast to the results for Study 299 where samples that did not
validate were excluded from subsequent analyses. Final results of confirmation testing were
as follows:

1:2 as per protocol.
b Specimens 5805-3060 and 5805-3069 had been identified by the source lab as
positive for B. pertussis were not confirmed with the original validation testing. Both
of these specimens were positive for B. pertussis during subsequent discrepancy
investigation.
c Specimens 5805-3054 and 5805-3075 had been identified by the source lab as
negative for B. pertussis, but unexpectedly were found to be positive during
confirmation testing. Both of these specimens were found to be negative for B.
pertussis during subsequent discrepancy investigation. The third false negative
specimen, 5805-3063, was among the latest Cp values during confirmation testing
and may have been affected by the inadvertent additional dilution.

ix. Additional testing of Coronavirus OC43 and Coronavirus 229E
Specimens
Additional Coronavirus OC43 (n=28) and 229E (n=14) presumed positive specimens were
obtained by the sponsor in addition to 18 negative controls (samples submitted for respiratory
testing) and tested as a separate Panel (Panel 10). No clinical information was available other
than samples were almost all obtained from children. Confirmatory testing for the
Coronavirus OC43 specimens was by testing with the comparator assays for the
nucleoprotein gene target that was used during the prospective clinical study; for samples
that were not confirmed by the initial comparator assay, testing of the
Hemagglutinin/esterase gene was then performed by the same assay used during the
prospective studies. (Both assays were followed by bi-directional sequencing.) Coronavirus
229E specimens were initially confirmed by a two stage process using the same assays as
during the prospective study. Each specimen was tested for the nucleoprotein gene assay
using the same assay that was used during the prospective clinical study, followed by testing
of negative specimens for the polymerase gene, also using the same assay used during the
prospective study. For five samples testing by the second validation assay was necessary (see
below); however there was insufficient specimen volume to perform additional extractions
and residual extracted specimen was used to perform the additional testing. Confirmation
testing results were as follows:

a Two of the unconfirmed specimens were positive by PCR testing of

VIN #5805-2055, sequence data could not be generated. These two
specimens were considered reference method negative.
b The 18 negative samples were not tested by the outside laboratory for
Coronavirus OC43.

a VIN 5805-2010 was PCR negative by the nucleoprotein assay and
positive by the polymerase assay; however, sequencing confirmed the
presence of CoV 229E for only one of two strands. No sequence data
was obtained for the second strand. This specimen was considered
negative in the analysis below.
bThe 18 negative samples were not tested by the outside laboratory for
Coronavirus 229E.
Samples for Coronavirus OC43 and Coronavirus 229E were run together as Panel 10;
therefore, 36 potential negative samples were available for Coronavirus OC43 testing (of 36
negative specimens, 18 were originally referred as negative, 4 samples were not confirmed
for CoV OC43, 1 specimen that was not confirmed for Cov 229E, and 13 confirmed Cov
229E specimens), and 47 negative samples were available for Coronavirus 229E testing (of
47 negative specimens, 18 were originally referred as negative, 4 samples were not
confirmed for CoV OC43, 1 specimen was not confirmed for Cov 229E, and 24 confirmed
Cov 229E specimens). Specimens referred as positive samples but that could not be
confirmed were considered as negative reference specimens for the analyses below. Results
are presented in the following tables:

a Specimens 5805-2050 and 5805-2055 had been identified by the source
laboratory as positive for Coronavirus OC43 and were PCR positive using
confirmation PCR, but no sequence could be obtained and thus the analyte
content could not be confirmed (see above). Specimen 5805-2017 was from a
sample that had not been tested by the source lab for Coronaviruses but was
negative by confirmation PCR for Coronavirus OC43. A negative result was
obtained when re-tested with the FilmArray during discrepancy resolution.
b Testing results include the 24 confirmed positive specimens; of the 28
specimens referred, the four unconfirmed specimens were analyzed as reference
negative specimens. The 36 reference negative specimens included these 4
specimens, 18 specimens referred as negative, and 14 Coronavirus 229E
‘referred positive’ specimens.

identified (1/1117) by FilmArray/reference testing; no false negative results were seen. An
additional archived specimen was obtained from a source laboratory, and 2 additional
specimens tested positive for C. pneumoniae when being evaluated for other pathogens,
yielding a total of four C. pneumoniae specimens available for testing. Results for testing
these four specimens are summarized below:

Due to the limited number of samples available, the sponsor performed an additional
study of contrived C pneumoniae specimens using retained negative clinical specimens
from the FilmArray prospective study as sample matrix.
Fifty contrived specimens spiked with C. pneumoniae were developed for testing based on
levels of C. pneumoniae detected in clinical specimens as reported by Kuoppa et al. (2002)1.
The distribution of contrived samples had the following characteristics: minimum value > 0
and less than <1500 copies/ml, mode 9,000 – 11,000 copies/ml, mean approximately 15,000

To confirm the appropriateness of the spiking levels of C. pneumoniae contrived samples, an
additional study of contrived specimens was conducted comparing the distribution of Cp
values with contrived specimens to Cp values observed during investigation of a C.
pneumoniae outbreak.2 In this study, the sponsor generated the Cp values for contrived
specimens using an assay reproduced following Thurman et al.3 Results were as follows:

6. Quality Control
The FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) pouch contains two internal control assays:
a. The RNA Process Control targets an mRNA of the yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe.
During FilmArray RP pouch manufacture, whole yeast are freeze-dried into the sample
injection port of each pouch. When the test specimen is loaded into the pouch, S.
pombe is rehydrated and enters the pouch with the specimen. The yeast nucleic acid is
extracted, purified and tested simultaneously with nucleic acids from the patient
specimen. A positive result for the processing control indicates that all steps in the
process (nucleic acid extraction, reverse transcription, PCR, melt, detection, and
analysis) are functioning properly.
b. The second stage PCR (PCR2) control assay detects a synthetic DNA template that is
dried into triplicate wells of the array along with the corresponding primers. A positive
result indicates that PCR2 was successful.
The RNA Process Control and the PCR2 Control assays are used to Pass or Fail each
FilmArray RP pouch run. This combination of control assays monitors each of the critical
mechanical and chemical processes that occur in a pouch run, while limiting the possibility
of random control assay failures that could contribute to unnecessary pouch failures.
Good laboratory practice recommends running external positive and negative controls
regularly. Use viral transport medium as the external Negative Control, and previously
characterized positive samples or negative sample spiked with well characterized target
141

organisms as external Positive Controls. External controls should be used in accordance
with local, state, federal accrediting organizations, as applicable.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Not applicable
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
