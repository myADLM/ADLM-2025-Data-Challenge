L. Test Principle:
The test format for the AQT90 FLEX is an immunoassay based on time-
resolved fluorescence using an europium (Eu) chelate as the fluorescent label.
The test receptacles (300 µL test cups) for each assay contain the biotinylated
antibodies used for the capture of the analyte, a separating layer of glucosides,
and the europium-chelate labeled antibodies used to trace the captured
proteins. The sample or diluted sample is added to the test cup together with
assay buffer. The cup is then incubated to allow formation of the immuno-
complex and washed to remove unbound antibodies and sample materials.
Finally, the cup is exposed to excitation light and after a delay, the emitted
light is measured by single photon counting; this measurement cycle is
repeated up to 3,300 times. The total count (the response) is then compared to
a calibration curve to obtain a quantitative measurement of the analyte's
concentration in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the AQT90 Flex CKMB Test on the AQT90 FLEX
analyzer was evaluated using whole blood and plasma samples based
upon the CLSI EP5-A2 guideline.
For plasma samples evaluations, five levels of frozen native or
antigen spiked lithium–heparin plasma samples were tested in
5

--- Page 6 ---
duplicate in two separate runs for 20-25 days at three POC sites
(one instrument, three test kit lots per site). The number of
samples tested for each level ranged from 58 to 96. For whole
blood samples evaluations, fresh native or antigen spiked lithium-
heparin whole blood samples were tested in five replicates in five
separate runs within three hours at four POC sites (one instrument,
one test kit lot per site), total N=25.
The results are summarized in the following tables.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed using EDTA natural patient plasma
spiked with CKMB antigen. The high concentration and low
concentration samples were mixed together to create 10 intermediate
dilution samples. All samples were tested in replicates of ten with
samples ranging from 1.2 to 374 ng/mL.
The linear regression correlation between the expected
values and the measured values is:
2
y = 1.01x + 0.68, r = 0.9
An additional linearity study was conducted using EDTA natural
patient whole blood spiked with CKMB antigen. The high
concentration and low concentration samples were mixed together to
create 10 intermediate dilution samples. All samples were tested in
replicates of ten with samples ranging from 1.3 ng/mL to 404 ng/mL.
The linear regression correlation between the expected values and
the measured values is: y= 0.99 x + 1.08, r2 = 0.99
The linearity data provided support the sponsor’s claims that the
reportable range of this assay is 1.5 to 300 ng/mL for both whole blood
and plasma samples.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and Value Assignment
The antigen material, ERM-AD455/IFCC material, has been used to
establish the metrological traceability chain of the AQT90 FLEX CKMB
assay.
The calibrator value is internally assigned by the manufacturer and the
factory-defined calibration data is provided in the form of a barcode.
This data is used as a lot-specific reference curve, which is adjusted to
the correct instrument specific signal level by using a CAL Cartridge
with the same lot number. The protocols for value assignment and
acceptance criteria were reviewed and are acceptable.
The control value assignment for the three CKMB levels of the AQT90
FLEX LQC Multi-CHECK control material is performed by Radiometer.
The value assignment is traceable to master standards. The value
assignment for each Multi-CHECK level includes multiple reagent lots,
instruments, test days, and measurement replicates per control level, for a
total of 60 measurements per control level. The assigned analyte value
and range are lot-specific and printed on the specification label. The
specification label has a lot-specific barcode, containing the same
information that is printed (analyte level, assigned value, range levels, lot
number and expiry date). This information is assessable through the
AQT90 FLEX Analyzer. The protocols for value assignment and
acceptance criteria were reviewed and are acceptable.
Stability
AQT90 FLEX CKMB Test and Calibration Cartridges: The stability
studies were performed on three product lots of test and calibration
cartridges. Based on the results, the sponsor claims that test and calibration
o
cartridges have a shelf stability of 8 months at 2 to 8 C, while the on-
o
board stability is 23 days at 32 C for the test cartridge and 24 hours at
o
32 C for the calibration cartridge. The protocols for stability and
acceptance criteria were reviewed and are acceptable.
AQT90 FLEX LQC Multi-Check: Stability studies were performed on
three lots. Based on the results, the sponsor claims a shelf stability of 12
months at -18 to -26 °C, while the on-board stability is 4 days unopened at
o
2 to 8 C or 2 hours opened at room temperature. The protocols for
stability and acceptance criteria were reviewed and are acceptable.

d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) determination was based on 60 replicate
measurements of AQT Assay Buffer on a single AQT90 FLEX
instrument and one test kit lot number. The Limit of Blank as determined
th
by the upper 95 percentile is 0.09ng/mL. LoB is 0.5 ng/mL.
Limit of Detection (LoD) determination was based on 20 replicate
measurements of 10 low samples on 2 AQT90 FLEX instruments and 2
test kit lot numbers. The LoD determination was calculated by using the
determined LoB value and pooled SD values from LoD samples. The
sponsor claimed that LoD is 1.0 ng/mL for both EDTA plasma and
EDTA whole blood.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) determination was based on an interassay
precision of >20% for 30 replicate measurements of 10 low samples on two
AQT90 FLEX instruments and 2 test kit lot numbers. The Limit of Quantitation
was determined to be 0.57ng/mL and 0.62 ng/mL for EDTA plasma and EDTA
whole blood samples, respectively. The sponsor claimed that LoQ is 1.0 ng/mL
for both plasma and whole blood.
LoB, LoD and LoQ are summarized in the table below:
CKMB Value ng/ml
Limit of blank (LoB) 0.5
Limit of detection (LoD) 1.0
Limit of quantitation (LoQ) 1.0
The sponsor’s claimed measuring range is 1.5 to 300 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were designed according to the CLSI EP7-A
guideline. Two levels of human plasma (CKMB approximately 13 and
300 ng/mL) were spiked with known interference substances (52 drugs
and 13 endogenous compounds) and samples were analyzed in five
replicates on the AQT90 FLEX analyzer. In addition, two levels of whole
blood samples (13 and 300 ng/mL) were also tested with the 13
endogenous compounds. Non-significant interference, defined as

recovery within ±10% compared to reference without any interfering
substance, was observed with the assay. Results are summarized in the
table below for the endogenous interference substances (both plasma and
whole blood yielded similar results). The tests for unconjugated bilirubin,
conjugated bilirubin, biotin, cholesterol, creatinine, glucose, hemoglobin,
human IgG, triglycerides and urea were performed with Lithium Heparin
as the anticoagulant. All other tests were performed with K EDTA as
2
anticoagulant. The interferent study results are summarized below:
Interferents Highest concentration tested showing
non-significant interference
Bilirubin, conjugated 27 mg/dL
Bilirubin, unconjugated 27 mg/dL
Biotin 3 µ/L
Cholesterol 500 mg/dL
Creatinine 5.0 mg/dL

Human albumin 10000 mg/dL
Human IgG 5300 mg/dL
Triglycerides (Intralipid) 1500 mg/dL
Urea 200 mg/dL
Results of the 52 drugs tested that have non-significant interference
are listed in the labeling.
No hook effect was observed for concentrations up to 7600 ng/mL
with either EDTA plasma or EDTA whole blood.
Cross reactivity with CKBB and CKMM were evaluated at two
levels of CKMB concentrations (1 ng/mL and 15 ng/mL).
Samples spiked with either 2500 ng/mL of CKBB or CKMM were
used for the studies. Studies were carried out for both plasma and
whole blood samples. All the cross-reactivity results were less
than 0.1%.
Potential interference from human anti-mouse antibody
(HAMA) and Rheumatoid factor (RF) was evaluated by
comparing the results of seventeen human HAMA and/or RF

plasma samples spiked with CKMB to reference sample
(HAMA/RF negative) containing the same amount of CKMB.
No negative interference for the assay was observed, which was
defined as recovery within ± 10% of human HAMA/RF positive
samples compared to a reference sample (HAMA/RF negative).
The highest concentration test for HAMA was 1825 ng/mL and
for RF was 8530IU/mL. The sponsor claims no interference
from human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) and Rheumatoid
factor (RF).

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Paired human whole blood and lithium-heparin plasma samples were
collected at three hospitals (POC sites) and measurements were
obtained using the AQT90 FLEX CKMB Test run on the AQT90
FLEX analyzer. Frozen plasma samples were sent to a central
laboratory and comparative measurements were obtained on the
predicate device (VIDAS CKMB assay). Nine samples were spiked to
supplement the samples in the hard-to-find, upper range. Singlet set of
results from the candidate device was used to compare against the
mean results of the predicate device. The results were analyzed by
Passing-Bablok regression. The correlation data is summarized below:

The sponsor concluded that lithium heparin and EDTA are acceptable anti-
coagulant and the four anticoagulant-matrix combinations can be used.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
None
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Whole blood (lithium-heparin and EDTA) and plasma (lithium-heparin
and EDTA) were obtained from 691 apparently healthy individuals
(ages: 21 to 91 years) from a geographically diverse U.S. adult
population (388 women and 303 men) and analyzed using the AQT90
th
FLEX CKMB assay. The 97.5 Percentile was determined to be 6.9
ng/mL for women and 11 ng/mL for men. It is recommended that each
laboratory should establish its own reference range.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
