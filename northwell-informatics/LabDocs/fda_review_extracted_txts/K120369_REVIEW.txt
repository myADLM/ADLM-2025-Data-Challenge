I. Device Description:
The Hitachi Clinical Analyzer is an automatic, bench-top, wet chemistry system intended for
use in clinical laboratories or physician office laboratories. The analyzer unit includes a
single probe, an incubation rotor, carousels for sample cups and reagent cartridges, and a
multi-wavelength photometer. The single-use reagent cartridges may be placed in any
configuration on the carousel, allowing the user to develop any test panel where the reagent
cartridges are available.
The S TEST reagent cartridges are made of plastic and include two small reservoirs capable
of holding two separate reagents (R1 and R2), separated by a reaction cell/photometric
cuvette. The cartridges also include a dot code label that contains all chemistry parameters,
calibration factors, and other production-related information, e.g., expiration dating. The
dimensions of the reagent cartridges are: 13.5 mm (W) × 28 mm (D) × 20.2 mm (H).

L. Test Principle:
Glucose is phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate by hexokinase (HK) in the presence of
ATP. When the glucose-6-phosphate is converted into 6-phosphogluconic acid by glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), NADP is converted into NADPH with an increase in
absorbance at 340 nm. The concentration of glucose can be determined by measuring the
amount of change in absorbance of NADPH.

five with three lots of cartridges across six analyzers according to standard procedure.
Testing occurred at Time 0 (baseline), and again at approximately, 6, 9, 11, 12 and 13
months; the storage condition was refrigerated (2 to 8 ºC). The studies supported the
sponsor’s claimed shelf life of 12 months at 2 to 8 ºC.
d. Detection limit:
Per CLSI EP17-A, blank samples for each reagent system were assayed 20 times per
day for three days for a total of 60 replicate results to determine LOB and LOD. Low
samples were assayed 20 times with the specific reagent cartridges to determine the
detection limit below:
LoD for GLU: 0.3 mg/dL
LoB for Glu : ( mean of the 57th and 58 point) -0.28
LoQ study was performed as follows: three clinical samples were diluted to target 5.5
mg/dL glucose. Each sample was tested with one lot of cartridges 6x/day on 3
different days with three different analyzers for a total of 54 replicate results per
sample. From these data, the means, standard deviations (SDs), and percent
coefficients of variation (%CVs) were calculated. The % CVs ranged from 14.5 to
17.5 % with all three < 20 %. The data supported the sponsor’s claimed LoQ of 5
mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The studies followed CLSI EP7-A2. The data demonstrated that GLU was not
affected by the following substances at the levels noted below. No significant
interference is defined by the sponsor as the highest level of interferent that is within
10% of the neat sample.
The interference studies demonstrated that the S TEST for GLU was resistant to high
levels of ascorbic acid (up to 50mg/dL), hemoglobin up to 500 mg/dL for low
(50mg/dL) glucose levels and 1000 mg/dL for high (200 mg/dL) glucose levels,
unconjugated bilirubin up to 6.25 mg/dL for low (50mg.dL) glucose levels and 50
mg/dL for high (50mg.dL) glucose levels, and triglycerides (up to 800 mg/dL).
