H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct
The Focus Diagnostics Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct assay is intended for use on
the 3M Integrated Cycler instrument for the in vitro qualitative detection and
differentiation of influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV) RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) from human patients with signs and
symptoms of respiratory tract infection in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological
risk factors. This test is intended for use as an aid in the differential diagnosis of
influenza A, influenza B, and RSV viral infections in humans and is not intended to
detect influenza C.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus or RSV infection and should not be used
as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established with clinical specimens
collected during the 2010/2011 influenza season when 2009 H1N1 influenza and H3N2
were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation. When other influenza A viruses
are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent
influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture
should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and
culture specimens.

I. Device Description:
The test is a real-time RT-PCR amplification and detection assay that utilizes a bi-functional
fluorescent probe-primer for the detection and differentiation of human influenza A virus
RNA, human influenza B virus RNA and respiratory syncytial virus RNA in nasopharyngeal
swabs. The assay uses direct measurement of viral RNA without extraction. A bi-functional
fluorescent probe-primer is used together with a reverse primer to amplify a specific target
for each analyte and the RNA internal control (IC). The assay provides three results;
conserved regions of influenza A viruses (matrix gene), influenza B viruses (matrix gene)
and RSV (M gene) are targeted to identify these viruses in the specimen. An RNA internal
control is used to detect RT- PCR inhibition.
The instrument utilizes a consumable named the Direct Amplification Disc (DAD) to process
specimens. The DAD consumable is compartmentalized into eight separate wedges, up to
eight separate specimens or controls may be processed on each disc. Each wedge contains
sample and reagent input ports, microfluidic channels and laser activated valves to control
the fluid flow and a reaction chamber. This disc meters the amount of reagent (reaction mix)
and sample that are placed into specific ports in the disc. A foil seal is lifted and the user
adds 50 µL of reaction mix to the reagent input port using a fixed volume pipette.
Centrifugal force moves the fluid into the metering chamber. The reagent chamber measures
40 µL of reagent and the sample chamber measures 10 µL of sample. Excess reagent and
sample are forced by centrifugal forces into the waste chambers.
The Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct kit contains the reaction mix (RM), the Simplexa™
Flu A/B & RSV Direct Barcode Card with assay specific information, and Package Insert.

10. Cover the wedge sealing the wells with the peeled adhesive foil, pressing down firmly
near the edge of the wedge. If the original foil is torn it should be replaced with an
extra replacement foil wedge.
11. Tear off the tab portion of the foil cover along the perforation.
12. Repeat steps 6 to 11 for the next sample(s).
13. Load the sealed Direct Amplification Disc into the Integrated Cycler and start the run.
Interpretation of Results:
The Integrated Cycler Studio software performs all of the results interpretation automatically.
The display presents the user with a separate report box for each of the three analytes as well
as the IC. The IC can be reported as “valid” or “invalid”. Detection of the IC in test
specimens is not required for a valid result. The software reports one of four possible
outcomes after a run is completed for each sample ID:
Detected: Flu A, Flu B, or RSV was detected in the sample
Not Detected: Flu A, Flu B, or RSV was not detected in the sample
Invalid: An error occurred and the instrument could not conclusively detect Flu A, Flu B,
RSV
EC500: The software detected a data quality error
An “Invalid” result can occur from RNA Internal Control failure or failure to detect sufficient
specimen. Specimens should be retested in the event of an Invalid result. An “EC500” result
can occur if the software was unable to determine a valid amplification curve for the analyte.
Specimens should be retested in the event of an EC500 result.

L. Test Principle:
The Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV assay is a nucleic acid amplification assay that uses Real-
Time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) amplification to enable
simultaneous and distinct detection of viral RNA from influenza A, influenza B and RSV
from nasopharyngeal swabs from human patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory
infection in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors.
The assay combines real-time PCR amplification with fluorescent signal detection
technology. A bi-functional fluorescent probe-primer is used together with a reverse primer
to amplify a specific target (for each analyte and internal control). A fluorescent signal is
generated after separation of the fluorophore from the quencher as a result of the binding of a
probe element to the extended DNA fragment synthesized during amplification.
The 3M Integrated Cycler is a rapid real-time PCR thermocycler used for the identification of
nucleic acid from biological specimens. The instrument utilizes one of two types of disc
media to contain and to process specimens: the Universal Disc and the Direct Amplification
Disc (DAD). The instrument uses real time fluorometric detection to identify targets within
the sample wells. The instrument is controlled by an external computer running the
Integrated Cycler Studio Software.
The Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direct assay uses the DAD consumable. The DAD
consumable is compartmentalized into eight separate wedges, up to separate specimens or
controls may be processed on each disc. Each wedge contains sample and reagent input ports,
microfluidic channels and laser activated valves to control the fluid flow and a reaction
chamber. This disc is specifically designed to meter the amount of reagent (reaction mix) and

sample that are placed into specific ports in the disc. A foil seal is lifted and the user adds
reaction mix to the reagent input port using a fixed volume pipette. Before sealing the well
the user adds unextracted specimen to the sample input port.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility study evaluated the device’s inter-laboratory, inter-assay, and intra-
assay reproducibility for high negative, low positive and moderately positive specimens
for influenza A, influenza B, and RSV. The testing panel consisted of high negative pool
for all three targets, a low (approximately 2-4 times LoD) and medium positive
(approximately 20 times LoD) for each analyte. These specimens were generated by
spiking viral stock dilutions into pooled nasopharyngeal swab clinical matrix that was
screened to be negative for all three analytes. Each sample was tested in triplicate at
three separate sites. One run consisting of set of two discs, per operator, per day, two
operators per site, were tested at three sites for five days. Three sites assessed the
device's inter-laboratory reproducibility and inter/intra-assay reproducibility. Combined
results for all sites and results stratified by site are presented in the tables below.

An RNA internal control (IC) is used to monitor the extraction process and to detect
RT-PCR inhibition. The RNA IC consists of encapsulated RNA template and is
present in the assay reaction mix.
Reaction mix stability was assessed in a study where the reaction mix was prepared
and then frozen. After freezing, the reaction mix was thawed and tested immediately
(time 0) and every hour for three hours. The positive control was used as the sample.
For each target there was a marked decrease in the amplitude of the amplification
plots as time progressed. The amplitude of the curves did not diminish to the point
where they did not cross the threshold until 2 hours after defrosting. Focus
conservatively set the room temperature stability at 30 minutes.

Positive control (PC) for this product is a blend of inactivated viruses for influenza A,
influenza B and RSV provided in single use aliquots frozen at -20°C. The materials
used in this control are the same as materials used in the control included in the
Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV kit (k102170). Lot release criteria for the PC is a Ct
score in the low to mid 30’s with a lot-to-lot CV ≤10%. The PC, in conjunction with
the Simplexa™ RNA IC, is used to verify reagent and system performance. The PC
is meant to be a control for global failure of the assay (missing reaction component,
instrument failure, etc.). A PC should be included in each run.
No Template Control (NTC): The NTC consists of Viral Transport Media and after
addition of reaction mix is taken through the RNA extraction process, amplification,
and detection. The NTC reaction should not exhibit fluorescence growth curves that
cross the threshold line in any of the FLUA, FLUB, or RSV detection channels but
must provide a valid Ct value (CT ≤40, ≠0) for the RNA IC. If any of the FLUA,
FLUB, or RSV channels provide a Ct value CT ≤40, ≠0 for the NTC, contamination
may have occurred in one or more components of the system. The NTC should be
included in each run.
Quality control ranges have been established as indicated in the table below. If the
controls are not within these parameters, patient results should be considered invalid

ranges and frequency of QC testing based on applicable local laws, regulations and
standard good laboratory practice.

d. Detection limit
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined for the Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV
Direct assay by limiting dilution studies using viral stocks of the virus strains listed in
the tables below. The specimens used for this study were contrived from verified [re-
grown and re-titered] viral material provided by an outside vendor. The specimens
were diluted from the viral stock material with pooled negative swab clinical matrix.
This study consisted of separate runs to evaluate the LoD of the Simplexa™ Flu A/B
& RSV Direct kit; multiple runs were performed to determine the tentative LoD of
three strains of seasonal influenza A, two strains of seasonal influenza B and two
strains of RSV. Tentative LoD was confirmed by assaying 20 replicates of each
dilution identified as the tentative LoD.
To determine tentative LoD, each of the seven strains were individually spiked into
negative swab matrix and serially diluted. Four different dilutions around the
theoretical LoD were tested. Each individual level was assayed in quadruplicate.
The lowest concentration at which all four replicates are positive is treated as the
tentative LoD.
Confirmation of LoD was determined over multiple runs. Each strain was spiked into
negative swab matrix at the concentration of tentative LoD. Each sample was tested
20 times. A single extraction of Positive Control (PC) and No Template Control
(NTC) was included in each day of testing. At least 19 of the 20 replicates (95%)
must be detected to confirm the LoD.

f. Interference studies:
Interfering Substances
Potentially interfering or inhibitory substances that may be present in nasopharyngeal
swabs or interfere with the PCR reaction were evaluated for the viral strains indicated
below. A low level of virus was spiked into pooled negative clinical matrix that was
screened to be negative for influenza A, influenza B and RSV. This low pool was
evaluated for baseline performance. Potentially interfering substances were spiked
into the low sample pool at the indicated concentrations in the following tables. All
strains were tested at two to four times the LoD.

Interfering Microorganisms
The Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV assay was evaluated by testing the ability to identify
influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and RSV when potentially inhibitory organisms
are present. The panel of 32 potentially inhibitory organisms was individually spiked
into a pool with a low concentration (approximately two times LoD) of influenza A
(Influenza A/PR/8/34 H1N1), influenza B (Influenza B/Malaysia/2506/2004) and
RSV (A2). Specimens were tested in triplicate to screen for inhibition. If signal was
not detected in any detection channel (Flu A, Flu B, RSV) in any of the three
replicates, an additional five replicates were tested for confirmation.
For two of the organisms tested, coronavirus and enterovirus, one of the initial three
replicates was not detected, indicating a possibility of inhibition. Those specimens
were tested in an additional five replicates. No inhibitory effects were confirmed for
influenza A, influenza B, or RSV at the concentrations tested.

1) The C. pneumoniae used had a titer of 1.52 x 105 IFU/mL it was further quantified using a real-time qPCR assay.
2) Initial testing appeared to show possible inhibition, upon repeat testing there was no evidence of inhibition.
3) EBV was quantified by the vendor using a real-time qPCR assay.
Competitive Interference
The Competitive Interference study evaluated the effects of clinically relevant co-
infections with each of the analytes probed by the assay. The study assessed whether
a high concentration of one virus in the specimen could potentially affect the
Simplexa assay performance for another target present at low levels in the multiplex
assay. A low sample (“Baseline Strain”) was contrived at approximately two to four
times the LoD for each target (influenza A, influenza B and RSV), and a baseline Ct
was determined for each sample. Each potential concomitant infecting virus was
spiked into the low level specimen according to the table below. Interference studies
indicate there is no interference when two viruses are present at the concentrations
tested; however clinical line data suggests very high levels of influenza A may
interfere with the detection of very low concentrations of influenza B or RSV.

g. Assay cut-off:
Assay cut-off was determined by analysis of the Limit of Detection study and clinical
data generated during assay verification testing. Forty-five (45) cycles of
amplification were performed during assay development to allow for the appropriate
determination of assay cut off. Subsequently, verification studies were conducted
with 40 cycles of amplification. The Limit of Detection for each target strain is
defined as the lowest concentration of sample where ≥ 95% of 20 replicates are
detected. Data analysis of the Limit of Detection study shows that the range of Ct
values for influenza A, influenza B and RSV specimens at the Limit of Detection
(LoD) were <40. Review of clinical data show that the >95% of the positive
specimens have a Ct value ≤35: 7 out of 207 positive specimens gave Ct value of
>35. Specimens that were positive for influenza A had Ct values in the range of 18.3
to 35.2. Specimens that were positive for influenza B had Ct values in the range of
20.5 to 37.1. Specimens that were positive for RSV had Ct values in the range of
21.8 to 37.1. Based on the available data, the assay cut off was set at Ct = 40 for each
detector.
h. Carryover Contamination:
The carry-over study searched for the presence of contamination in negative
specimens. The study was designed by alternately placing high positive and negative
specimens on each disc. A total of 60 negative specimens and 60 high positive
specimens were tested across 17 runs using four different instruments. The sample
size of 60 was chosen to provide lower bound of the 95 CI > 90% for the negative
proportion of the negative sample in absence of carry-over contamination effect.
The carryover effect was evaluated by comparing the observed negative rate for the
negative sample. The 95% confidence interval for % negative of negative sample
was calculated. All sixty (60) replicates of negative sample were “Not Detected” for
all three target viruses. Therefore no evidence of carryover was observed.

c. Fresh versus Frozen comparison:
A panel of 180 contrived samples was created using multiple strains of influenza A,
influenza B and RSV. The panel was tested fresh. After testing the panel was frozen
for a period of five days; the samples were then defrosted for an hour and then
refrozen. The refrozen panel was defrosted and tested again in the Simplexa™ Flu
A/B & RSV Direct assay. The results from all 180 frozen panel members were
concordant with the results when tested fresh.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
Three external testing sites and one internal site participated in the prospective clinical
study. Reference results for influenza A, influenza B viruses and respiratory syncytial
virus were generated using culture. Culture results were carried forward from the results
obtained at the time of sample collection. A total of 722 nasopharyngeal swabs
specimens were obtained from prospectively collected specimens from patients with
signs and symptoms of viral respiratory tract infection and distributed randomly to testing
sites. Prospective samples were collected in Eastern United States from 10-November-
2010 to 11-March-2011, the Mid-Western United States from 08-January-2011 to 02-
February 2011 and in Australia from 17-August-2010 to 20-October-2010. Of the 722
specimens, 325 specimens were collected from female patients and 397 specimens were
collected from male patents. A total of 327 specimens were from patients <5 years of
age, 223 specimens were from patients between 5-22 years of age, 158 specimens were
from patients between 22 to 60 years of age and 14 specimens were from patients >60
years of age. One sample was excluded from the prospective analysis due to Invalid
result for Flu A, three samples were excluded due to an invalid result for Flu B and one
sample was excluded due to an invalid result for RSV. The percentage of specimens with
invalid results during the study was 0.4% (3/722) with a 95% CI of 0.1% to 1.2%
