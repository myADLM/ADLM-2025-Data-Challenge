L. Test Principle:
The Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System, Model GM650 uses electrochemical
methodologies. The system quantitatively measures blood glucose levels using an
amperometric method. The system employs flavin adenine dinucleotide-glucose
dehydrogenase (GDH-FAD) enzyme chemistry. The electrons generated during this reaction
are transferred from the blood to the electrodes. The magnitude of the resultant current is
proportional to the concentration of glucose in the specimen and the signal is converted into a
readout displayed on the meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems - GE300 Talking BGMS and Rightest BGMS
GM650 meters are identical to each other except for the trade names. Therefore
performance characteristics for only Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM650
have been provided.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed precision studies in accordance with the ISO 15197 and CLSI
EP-5A. Venous whole blood was adjusted to 5 glucose levels 30-50mg/dL,51-
110mg/dL,111-150mg/dL,151-250mg/dL,251-400mg/dL) were used for within-day
precision studies. Each glucose level was analyzed in replicates of 10, with 3 test strip
lots and 10 meters, for a total of 300 tests per glucose level. Results are summarized
below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using three test strip lots and 15 mixed pools of venous blood
samples in glucose concentrations (as measured by YSI) of 0, 9, 29, 50, 86,154, 210,
238, 325, 346, 401, 462, 492, 591, and 629 mg/dL. Each level was measured in
triplicate with each of 3 test strip lots and the values from the Rightest GM650 meter
were compared with those obtained from YSI-2300. Results from regression
analysis:
Test strip lot #1: y = 1.0025x - 0.0664; R2 = 0.9956
Test strip lot #2: y = 1.0226x - 5.0090; R2 = 0.9963
Test strip lot #3: y = 1.0009x +1.8628; R2 = 0.9952

--- Page 9 ---
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of
20-600 mg/dL.
The measuring range of these systems is 20-600 mg/dL. Results equal to or below 20
mg/dL are reported as “Lo” and results greater than or equal to 600 mg/dL reported as
“Hi.”
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Control solutions and test strips cleared under k110737.
Traceability:
The Bionime Rightest Model GM650 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable
to the NIST SRM 917A reference material.
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the system is 20-600 mg/dL. This range was verified by the
linearity study (M.1.b).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed by spiking venous blood with two levels of
glucose concentrations (60 - 100 and 150 - 300 mg/dL). Each of these samples was
divided into a test pool and a control pool and each of 18 potential endogenous and
exogenous interfering substances was added to the test pool. Each compound was
tested at two concentrations, normal/therapeutic and high/toxic concentrations.
Each sample was analyzed 5 times with the Rightest GM650 meter and the %
difference between the interferent containing sample and the control sample
calculated. The sponsor defines no significant interference as ≤10% difference
relative to the control sample. Results are presented in the table below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor states that this study was performed in accordance with ISO 15197.
Testing was completed by comparing the Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System
against the YSI-2300 glucose analyzer (reference method). The study was conducted
with a total 118 subjects. Three lots of test strips were used in the study.
Fresh venous blood samples and capillary blood from fingertip, palm and forearm
(ranging between 30-528 mg/dL glucose concentrations) from different individuals
were used, except for five samples with glucose concentrations <50mg/dL that were
incubated to allow glucose to glycolize. For concentrations > 400 mg/dL, four spiked
samples were used. Samples collected from fingertip, palm and forearm were tested
with the Rightest GM 650 and within 5 minutes was also tested with the YSI meter.
Accuracy for first Rightest GM650 measurement results vs. YSI results are
summarized below:

O. System Descriptions:
Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings.
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,
or mobile device?:
Yes (or No X o
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?:
Yes ___or No X o
2. Software:
FDA reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this
line of product types:.
Yes X or No______
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, palm,
and forearm only. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by
capillary action.
5. Calibration:
A single calibration code is programmed into the meters at the time of manufacturing and no
user input is required for calibration.
6. Quality Control:
Three levels of aqueous glucose control solutions are available with this system. The
meter has a function for the user to select the level of control solution they wish to run to
prevent control results from being stored in the internal memory as patient results.
Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. The
control solution readings are not included in the average of the patient results when the
measurements are performed in the “CS measurement mode”. An acceptable range for
each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is cautioned not to use
the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:

1. Hematocrit Study:
A study to evaluate the effects of hematocrit was conducted on samples with 6 glucose
concentrations (20-50, 60-80, 135-165, 180-220, 270-330 and 360-440 mg/dL) at 6
hematocrit levels (20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 65%). Each glucose level/hematocrit
combination was tested in triplicate on 3 meters using 3 lots of test strips. Results of
samples at each hematocrit level were compared to samples with the same glucose
concentration at normal (45%) hematocrit as well as to the corresponding YSI value.
Data provided for the claimed hematocrit range of 30-55% met the sponsor’s acceptance
criteria of + 15%
2. Altitude Study:
A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of altitude on the GM650 BGMS. Test
samples were tested on 3 meters in triplicate with 3 different strip vials using venous
whole blood from healthy donors. Three glucose concentrations (ranging from 43.5-
335mg/dL) at three corresponding altitude levels (3280, 6561 and 9842 feet,) were tested
in a controllable temperature /humidity chamber against a 0 meter level as a control.
Each venous blood sample was also tested by the YSI 2300 analyzer. The meter readings
obtained were compared to the YSI method and the percent bias was determined at each
level against the YSI results. The sponsor showed the bias was within ± 10 % for all
three altitude levels tested. Based on the data, the sponsor claims that the GM650 can be
used up to 9842 feet
3. Sample volume study:
A sample volume study was performed to verify the minimum test strip sample volume
requirement and the test strip fill error requirement established for the BGMS. Three lots
of test strips were used to test spiked or glycolized venous whole blood at three glucose
concentrations (40-60, 80-120 and 300-330 mg/dL). Blood at each of these
concentrations was applied to strips at 6 target sample volumes of 0.6, 0.65, 0.75, 0.8,
1.0, and 1.25µL. The sponsor concluded that sample volumes of ≥0.75 µL produced
accurate results ( the sponsor showed were within 8%), Samples <0.75 µL gave an Er 4
error code . The labeling provides instructions and graphics to assist the user in obtaining
and applying an adequate sample volume.
4. User performance study:
As part of the user performance study summarized in section M.2.a above, the
participants were asked to complete a questionnaire to evaluate the ease of use of the
device and the clarity of the English language labeling. Overall the users indicated that
they could successfully perform the test and that the user manual was written clearly.
5. Readability assessment:
The Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment of the product labeling determined that the
Owner’s Manuals and test strip inserts for both proposed devices were written at the 8th
grade level.

6. Temperature and humidity studies:
Temperature and humidity studies were conducted that demonstrated that the devices can
be used at temperatures from 6 to 40°C and at a relative humidity of 10 to 90%. The
sponsor tested the extreme combinations of temperature and humidity and the results
supported the claimed ranges.
7. Electromagnetic Compatibility:
EMC testing was performed/passed and a certificate granted to Bionime Inc. was
provided.
8. Infection Control Studies:
The device is intended for single-patient use only. Discide Ultra disinfecting towelettes
with EPA registration #10492-4 were validated demonstrating validation using hepatitis
B surface antigen testing using materials from the meter and lancing device. The sponsor
also demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the external materials of
the meters and lancing device after 550 cleaning and disinfection cycles (one cycle
includes one cleaning wipe plus one disinfecting wipe) to simulate 5 years of meter and
lancing device use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated
cleaning and disinfection procedures.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
