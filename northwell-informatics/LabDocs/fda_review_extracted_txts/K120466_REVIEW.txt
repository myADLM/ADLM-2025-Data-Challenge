--- Page 2 ---
(2C19) is indicated for use in clinical laboratories upon prescription by the
attending physician as an aid to clinicians in determining therapeutic strategy for
therapeutics that are metabolized by the CYP450 2C19 gene product, specifically
*2, *3, and *17. The Verigene CYP2C19 Nucleic Acid Test (2C19) is not
indicated to be used to predict drug response or non-response.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
The information provided from this test may supplement decision-making and
should only be used in conjunction with routine monitoring by a physician.
Because of the variability in the knowledge of clinical utility with specific drugs
that are metabolized by CYP2C19, clinicians should use professional judgment in
the interpretation of results from this test. Results from this type of assay should
not be used in predicting a patient's response to drugs for which the drug
metabolizing enzyme activity of the allele, or the drug metabolic pathway, has not
been clearly established.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Verigene® System
I. Device Description:
The Verigene CYP2C19 Nucleic Acid Test (2C19) is a molecular assay which
detects specific nucleic acid targets in a microarray format. For each of the nucleic
acid sequences detected by the 2C19 test, Capture and Mediator oligonucleotides are
utilized for gold nanoparticle probe-based endpoint detection. The Capture
oligonucleotides bind to a specific portion of the nucleic acid target and are
themselves bound onto a substrate in the microarray. The Mediator oligonucleotides
bind to a different portion of the same nucleic acid target and also allow binding of a
gold nanoparticle probe to a portion of the Mediator oligonucleotide that is
complementary to the oligonucleotides attached to the gold nanoparticle probe.
Specific silver enhancement of the bound gold nanoparticle probes at the capture
sites results in gold-silver aggregates that scatter light with high efficiency. The
2C19 test is performed on the Verigene System, a “sample-to-result”, fully
automated, bench-top molecular diagnostics workstation. The Verigene System
consists of 2 components: the Verigene Reader and the Verigene Processor SP. The
2C19 test utilizes single-use disposable test consumables and a self-contained
Verigene Test Cartridge for each sample tested. For the 2C19 test, the Verigene
System allows automated nucleic acid extraction from blood specimens and target
detection of specific DNA.
The Reader is the Verigene System’s user interface, which serves as the central
control unit for all aspects of test processing and results generation. The Reader’s
graphical user interface guides the user through test processing and test results using
a barcode scanner. The user inserts the Test Cartridge into the Verigene Processor
2

--- Page 3 ---
SP, which executes the test procedure, automating the steps of (1) sample
preparation; i.e.; cell lysis and magnetic bead-based DNA isolation from EDTA-
anticoagulated whole blood samples and (2) hybridization; i.e.; detection and
identification of DNA in a microarray format using gold nanoparticle probe-based
technology.
After test processing is complete, the user removes the Test Cartridge from the
Processor SP, removes the reagent pack from the substrate holder, and inserts the
substrate holder into the Reader for analysis. Light scatter from the capture spots is
imaged by the Reader. Presence of the gold nanoparticle probes at a particular
location on the substrate is assessed optically. The relative density of probes adhered
at each set of capture locations on the substrate is then translated into a signal
intensity which is used to assess the relative level of captured DNA target to
determine a genotype.

Test Procedure
Genomic DNA is extracted from the white blood cells in a whole blood specimen,
fragmented and denatured. This fragmented, single-stranded genomic DNA
hybridizes to complementary sequence-specific DNA oligonucleotides, known as
capture oligonucleotides, arrayed on the surface of a substrate (glass slide). A second
DNA oligonucleotide is then hybridized to the captured genomic DNA that was
captured initially. This oligonucleotide is known as a mediator oligonucleotide
containing 2 sequence domains: 1 domain is complementary to the genomic DNA
target and a second domain is complementary to a common oligonucleotide attached
to a signal generating gold nanoparticle probe. After washing away any DNA not
affixed to the captures, the probe is exposed to the captured mediator/target
compound where it hybridizes to any captured mediators. Presence of the gold
nanoparticle probes at a particular location on the substrate is assessed optically. The
relative density of probes at each set of captures on the substrate is then translated
into a signal intensity which is used to assess relative levels of captured DNA target
to determine a genotype.
Result Interpretation
A genotype result is calculated using a normalized ratio of the signal of wild type
capture locations on the microarray to the mutant capture locations on the microarray.
Ratio = (wild type signal – mutant signal) / (wild type signal + mutant signal)
When the ratio is near 1.0, the wild type signal is higher and the genotype result is
wild type. When the ratio is near 0, the wild type signal is equivalent to the mutant
signal and the genotype result is heterozygous. When the ratio is near -1.0, the
mutant signal is higher and the genotype result is mutant.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision study was conducted at 1 testing site (Nanosphere) and the
reproducibility study was conducted at 3 sites (2 external and 1 internal sites).
All 3 sites tested the same 8 member sample panel consisting of 8 whole
blood specimens containing genotypes *1/*1, *1/*2, *2/*2, *2/*17, *1/*3 (2
tested), *1/*17, and *17/*17. Precision and reproducibility results generated
by the 2C19 test were compared to results generated by bi-directional
sequencing (BDS), confirming the genotype of the panel member before prior
to testing.
Intra-laboratory precision was evaluated by testing the 8 member panel in
duplicate twice daily by 2 operators for 12 non-consecutive days at 1 testing
site, generating a total of 48 replicates per specimen and an overall total of
5

--- Page 6 ---
384 data points. Three lots of test cartridges and 3 lots of extraction trays were
used for the study. Of the 384 samples tested, there was 100% agreement for
all panel members as compared to BDS. There were 9 “No Calls” in the study
for an initial call rate of 97.7% (375/384). A final call rate of 100% (384/384)
was achieved upon repeat testing of all 9 samples. There were 2 Pre-Analysis
Errors (Pre-AE) (1 tip test error and 1 tip seal error) for a 0.6% error rate. The
precision study results are summarized below:
Reproducibility was evaluated with the 8 member panel tested in duplicate
twice daily by 2 operators for 5 non-consecutive days. The testing regimen
generated 60 replicates (20 replicates per site) per specimen for a total of 480
data points. Four lots of test cartridges and 4 lots of extraction trays were used
for the study. There were 15 initial “No Calls” in the study for an initial call
rate of 96.9% (465/480). A final call rate of 99.6% (478/480) was achieved
upon successful repeat testing of 13 samples, where 2 samples did not resolve
after re-testing. Of the 480 samples tested, with 2 un-resolved No Call
samples, the percent agreement for all panel members compared to BDS was
99.6% (478/480). There were 6 Pre-AEs in the study for a 1.4% error rate.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls: Positive or negative DNA assay quality controls are not included as
part of the assay. When external quality control is needed, the sponsor
recommends that previously-characterized clinical specimens (positive control
samples to test each genotype and at least 1 negative control wild type) be
used with the assay during instrument installation, test validation, verification
of the performance of a new lot of consumables, or when the integrity of
storage conditions is in question. The package insert outlines QC options for
evaluating (1) DNA extraction and hybridization steps together and (2) DNA
extraction and hybridization steps separately. For (1), combined QC steps
(DNA extraction and hybridization together), fresh samples of known
genotype stored at 2-8°C be used within 10 days of collection. In the event
that insufficient volume of whole blood for certain genotypes cannot be
obtained, QC option (2) can be used where the extraction and hybridization
control steps are divided. For the extraction control step, whole blood samples
(stored at 2-8°C for up to 10 days after collection) should be used where the
following results are obtained: DNA concentration range within 160 ng/µL
and 400 ng/ µL and absorbance A /A ratio range within 1.7-2.2. To QC
260 280
the hybridization control step, previously characterized genomic DNA (stored
at -20°C for up to 9 months) with a concentration range of 160 ng/µL to 400
ng/µL and absorbance A /A ratio range from 1.7-2.2 should be used and
260 280
the test results should match the expected genotype result for the sample.
All quality control requirements and testing should be performed in

conformance with local, state and/or federal regulations or accreditation
requirements.
Imaging Controls: A set of oligonucleotide spots on the substrate is used as
Imaging Controls. The imaging controls act as a quality check for proper fluid
control and movement between the Test Cartridge and the instrument. If the
imaging controls are absent, then a “No Call” is an output and the user is
informed that the reason is due to an absence of imaging controls. The
imaging control signal is due to signal probe hybridization to an
oligonucleotide on the substrate. Signal will only be present if the probe
reagent and the signal enhancement reagents are pumped into and held in the
hybridization chamber for the specified time period. A Negative Control
sequence is included as a control for non-specific binding within the test
owing to factors including inadequate hybridization stringency, fluidic failures
resulting in high non-specific signals, and other user- or instrument-related
failures. A set of background spots on the substrate is used as a background
control. The user is informed if the “No Call” result is due to the background
signal being too high. Each target oligonucleotide and background location
has 6 or more separate spots in the array. The array spots are grouped in at
least 3 different locations on the substrate surface. Mathematical algorithms,
called “spot filters”, compare the “like” array spots as a set. If individual spots
in the set differ, then they are discarded. If the total number of spots in a set
becomes less than 4 due to the spot filters, then a “No Call” results. The spot
comparison algorithms protect against some hybridization failures; they also
protect against fluidics failures such as the hybridization chamber being
partially filled.
Reagent Stability: Stability testing of the CYP2C19 test involved taking
individual test kit units arranged in the final packaging configuration and
placing them in qualified stability chambers in a temperature controlled
environment and testing at defined time intervals. For shipping stability, a
subset of 2C19 test kit lots were shipped in their intended outer packaging to
several sites and returned to Nanosphere and tested for performance.
Successful product testing for a minimum of twelve weeks nominal exposure
is required prior to marketing of the product.
Sample Stability: The sponsor has demonstrated that specimens (EDTA anti-
coagulated whole blood samples) can be kept refrigerated (2 to 8°C) 10 days
after specimen collection and used with the CYP2C19 test. Previously
characterized genomic DNA (160 ng/µL to 400 ng/µL and A /A from 1.7-
260 280
2.2) can be stored at -20°C for up to 9 months and used with the CYP2C19
test.
d. Detection limit:
The upper and lower limits of detection of the assay were assessed by analysis
of 7 whole blood samples (*1/*1, *1/*2, *1/*3, *1/*17, *2/*2, *2/*17 and
8

--- Page 9 ---
*17/*17 genotypes) with 5 input volumes (between 800 µL and 1200 µL in
100 µL increments in replicates of 40) to determine the lowest and highest
input volumes that would consistently give an initial call rate of ≥90% and
100% accuracy (vs. BDS). The blood samples were then tested with the assay
over a period of 4 days by 2 different users. No repeat testing was performed
for samples yielding a “no call” result. A total of 1,400 tests were completed.
No incorrect calls were observed for the 1,348 valid test results generated (i.e.,
>4% no-calls; n=52). Overall, the CYP2C19 test detected each genotype
consistently (≥90.0%) and accurately (100% vs. BDS) for all genotypes tested
between the specimen volume ranges of 1000 ± 200µL. There were no
incorrect calls at any of the input levels (data summarized below). The
Sponsor states that a significant degradation in test performance was not
observed when testing the blood input volumes at either end of the 20% range
around the recommended input value of 1ml (i.e., 1000 ± 200 µL). Therefore,
1.0 + 0.05mL of whole blood is the recommended sample volume tolerance
for the assay. Furthermore, an additional study evaluating the impact of test
performance at blood input volumes of 0, 500 and 750 µL (in replicates of 40
for the *1/*2 specimen) demonstrated initial call rates of 0, 67.5 (27/40) and
97.5% (39/40) for all 3 additional input volumes tested, respectively. Initial
call rate for blood input volumes greater than 800 µL are summarized in the
table below:

1) %CI values were computed using the SAS 9.1.3, exact binomial method.
a) Genotype determined by bi-directional sequencing
The Sponsor has noted in their labeling that the ability of the CYP2C19 test to
consistently detect the genotype of a specimen will be negatively impacted at
whole blood sample input volumes less than 750 µL, based on the call rates in
the study results cited above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference from potential interfering substances was evaluated to assess
the genotyping assay performance of the CYP2C19 test in the presence of
excess amounts of endogenous substances. Seven EDTA anticoagulated
whole blood control samples (each containing individually containing
genotypes *1/*1, *1/*2, *1/*3, *1/*17, *2/*2, *2/*17, and*17/*17) were
processed in replicates of 30 using 1.0 mL of blood for each replicate. These
samples were used as the base matrix into which the 5 interfering substances
were spiked and compared to unspiked control samples. The following
compounds at the following concentrations were tested: albumin (6000
mg/dL), bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated, 20 mg/dL), triglycerides
(3000 mg/dL) and cholesterol (500 mg/dL). The concentrations of these
endogenous substances were at higher levels for each of the substances than
is normally observed in human blood. Sample genotypes were verified by
BDS.
In the presence of these substances, each genotype was detected consistently
with a final call rate of 100% (except for *1/*3 in the presence of albumin,
*2/*17 in the presence of conjugated bilirubin and *17/*17 in the presence of
cholesterol that yielded final call rates of 29/30) and 100% accuracy vs. BDS.
The sponsor concluded that the compounds do not interfere with the
performance of the assay.
Sample carry-over:
To evaluate possible cross-contamination and carry-over between test runs,

samples of alternating genotypes were tested consecutively on the same
device. Demonstration of a >90% no call rate and >99% concordance with
BDS was the criteria by which to establish that there is no sample carry-over
and cross-over contamination between procedures on the Verigene Processor
SP using different sample cartridges. Whole blood with *1/*2 genotype was
tested on 10 Verigene instruments, followed immediately by whole blood
with *1/*1 genotype. Next, whole blood with *1/*17 genotype was tested on
the same 10 instruments, followed by whole blood with *1/*1 genotype. This
was repeated 3 times, such that 30 replicates were generated for *1/*2, 30
replicates for *1/*17, and 60 replicates for *1/*1 on a total of 10 instruments.
A total of 120 test runs were generated. All samples were concordance with
BDS and there were a total of 4 “no calls” during the study as summarized
below:
Genotype Total # Calls No Calls Total Call Rate (%)
Replicates
*1/*1 60 58 2 96.7
*1/*2 30 30 0 100
*1/*17 30 28 2 93.3
The sponsor concluded that the no calls observed in the study reflected the
typical performance of the CYP2C19 assay and that no sample carry-over was
illustrated between the samples.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were conducted at 3 external clinical study sites
using according to CLSI EP9-A2 guidelines. Each site utilized 1 Verigene
Reader and up to 12 Verigene Processor SP instruments, depending on each
site’s specimen enrollment and testing volume. Clinical samples, consisting
of EDTA anti-coagulated whole blood samples from the general population of
known Asian donors, were collected by 2 third party facilities and shipped to
each study site. Specimen tests resulting in a “No Call” or a pre-analysis error
(pre-AE) were repeat tested once. Residual DNA from each clinical specimen
after testing was sequenced using BDS. A total of 670 samples (125-281
samples per site) were tested. The table below shows the number of samples
tested, the initial and final call rates at each of the sites and the combined
statistics for each. There were 35 initial no calls of which 34 were
successfully repeated. The initial call rate was 94.8% (635/670) and the final
call rate was 99.9% (669/670), as summarized below:

a) SNPs in bold are the major SNPs/alterations responsible for the phenotype of the corresponding allele and
are unique to the mutation
b) The *10 mutation is adjacent to the *2 mutation, therefore the CYP2C19 Test contains two capture probes
for *10. These probes are used to ensure the accuracy of *2 allele detection; however, the *10 mutations
are not reported by the assay.

Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The package insert states:
CYP2C19*2 arises from a G→A transition in exon 5 at position 681 of
CYP2C19, creating an aberrant splice site. The CYP2C19 *2 polymorphism is
seen in approximately 15% of Caucasians, 15% of African-Americans, and 30%
of Asians. CYP2C19*3 arises from a G→A transition at position 636 in exon 4 of
CYP2C19, which produces a truncated protein. The CYP2C19 *3 polymorphism
is seen in approximately <1% of Caucasians, <1% of African-Americans, and 8%
