I. Device Description:
The KeyPath™ MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test – BT uses lytic bacteriophage, specific for
Staphylococcus aureus, as an amplification technology for detection of S. aureus and
determination of methicillin resistance or susceptibility in positive blood cultures. To
detect S. aureus the blood culture sample is inoculated into a reaction tube (ID). The
bacteriophage infect the S. aureus (if present), replicate within the host (culminating in
bacterial lysis) and over the incubation period, produce several cycles of bacteriophage
amplification. In a separate Reaction Tube (RS), the KeyPath™ Test uses cefoxitin
(methicillin analogue) which inhibits bacteriophage amplification for susceptible
organisms (MSSA) and fails to inhibit bacteriophage amplification when the organism is
resistant to methicillin (MRSA). The KeyPath™ Test then uses a self-performing
immunoassay (Detector) to detect the increase in concentration of bacteriophage using
antibodies specific to the KeyPath™ Test bacteriophage, and calibrated such that at a
known concentration, it will produce a visible signal.
To determine antibiotic susceptibility and/or resistance of the bacteria, the KeyPath™
Test uses a second sampling device and a second lane within the Detector, in parallel
with the first. The only significant difference between the two sampling devices is the
presence of the beta-lactam antibiotic, cefoxitin, used here to distinguish between
methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA) similar to a
breakpoint antimicrobial susceptibility test. Because bacteriophage amplification relies
on a viable host, susceptible organisms do not support bacteriophage amplification, and
no line on the Detector will be produced. Conversely, if the organism is resistant,
bacteriophage amplification will occur and a visible line on the Detector will be
produced. Although this test runs in parallel with the identification test, the results are
interpreted serially, as the antibiotic test result is only applicable to S. aureus. This
measure of antimicrobial susceptibility or resistance is referred to as phenotypic, like
antimicrobial disks, as opposed to genotypic, which refers to the detection of a
molecular marker.

L. Test Principle:
The KeyPath™ MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test – BT (KeyPath™ Test) is a bacteriophage
amplification-enabled immunoassay to identify Staphylococcus aureus and determine
its resistance or susceptibility to cefoxitin from positive blood cultures, which have
been determined to have gram positive cocci in singles (GPC) or gram positive cocci in
clusters (GPCC) by Gram stain. This method utilizes the specificity of
bacteriophage/bacteria interactions and their natural amplification processes to
produce a surrogate signal. In the presence of S. aureus, bacteriophage will replicate,
increasing to a detectable concentration. In the absence of S. aureus or the presence of
bacteria other than S. aureus, the KeyPath™ Test bacteriophage do not replicate and
remain undetectable. In addition, susceptible strains of S. aureus do not grow in the
presence of cefoxitin and therefore do not support bacteriophage amplification, while
resistant strains will grow and support bacteriophage amplification.
To perform the KeyPath™ Test, a sample of the positive blood culture is added to each

of the two provided reaction tubes, each comprised of KeyPath™ Test bacteriophage
and proprietary reagents that enhance the growth of S. aureus and suppress other
organisms. One Reaction Tube (Blue) is used for S. aureus identification. The second
Reaction Tube (Red) is used for resistance/susceptibility testing. Following incubation, a
small amount of the sample from each Tube is pipetted onto corresponding sample
wells on the Detector. If the specimen contains S. aureus a pink-to-dark red/ purple
Test Line (T) will appear in the Blue ID Read Window of the Detector.
If the sample is positive for S. aureus, Resistance/Susceptibility is then determined by
reading the Red RS Read Window. Resistance (MRSA) is determined by the development
of a visible pink-to-dark red/purple line at the Test Line (T) in the Red RS Read Window,
while Susceptibility (MSSA) is determined by the absence of a visible colored line at the
Test Line (T) in the Red RS Read Window.

g. Media Interference Studies

--- Page 8 ---
Page 8 of 10
A media interference study was performed using both 10 µL (recommended test
volume) and 20 µL (twice the recommended volume) of blood culture matrix
inoculum. No interference with the expected identification or susceptibility results
with the Standard/10 Aerobic/F (SA) and Standard Anaerobic/F (SN) blood culture
bottles was observed, therefore demonstrating that the SA and SN blood culture
matrix does not act as an interferent in the KeyPath™ MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture
Test – BT.
h. Validation studies:
A panel of clinical isolates obtained during the BACTEC trial MP2009-B (K102342) was
tested using the BACTEC Standard/10/Aerobic/F (SA) and Standard Anaerobic/F (SN)
blood culture bottles and the KeyPath™ MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test – BT. The
panel consisted of 22 methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 23 methicillin susceptible
S. aureus (MSSA) and 35 non-S.aureus (NSA) isolates from unique patients. BACTEC™
SA and SN bottles were charged with blood from healthy volunteers per IRB-approved
study protocol MP2007A. Bottles were inoculated with approximately 100 CFU of
organism from fresh overnight cultures, and tests were performed as indicated in the
package insert.
Results obtained in the validation studies substantiate the expanded use of the device.
Results achieved performance criteria of at least 95% positive percent agreement and
95% negative percent agreement for both identification and susceptibility results for
both the SA and SN bottles.
