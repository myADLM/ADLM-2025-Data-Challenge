1. Intended use(s):
See Indication(s) for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Alere Cholestech LDX® System is a small, portable analyzer and test cassette
system. The System is for in vitro diagnostic use only. The Lipid Profile•GLU
Cassette is for the quantitative determination of total cholesterol, HDL (high-
density lipoprotein) cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose in whole blood. A
TC/HDL (total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio and estimated values for LDL
(low-density lipoprotein) and non-HDL cholesterol are calculated by the Alere
Cholestech LDX® Analyzer.
· Cholesterol measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders
involving excess cholesterol in the blood and lipid and lipoprotein metabolism
disorders.
· HDL (lipoprotein) measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of
lipid disorders (such as diabetes mellitus), atherosclerosis, and various liver and
renal diseases.
· Triglyceride measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients
with diabetes mellitus, nephrosis, liver obstruction, other diseases involving
lipid metabolism, or various endocrine disorders.
· Glucose measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of carbohydrate
metabolism disorders including diabetes mellitus, neonatal hypoglycemia, and
idiopathic hypoglycemia, and of pancreatic islet cell carcinoma.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use.
The sponsor states the following limitations in their package insert (PI):
“If the measured value of TRG is >400 mg/dL (>4.51 mmol/L), the LDX displays
“N/A” for the LDL estimate.
The sponsor certification for CRMLN was verified with the sponsor and confirmed
at http://www.cdc.gov/labstandards/crmln_clinical.html.

system. The System is for in vitro diagnostic use only. The Analyzer uses reflectance
photometry (the amount of light reflected from a solid surface) to measure the amount
of substances in blood. The analyzer measures color changes of the four reagent pads.
The amount of color formed is converted by the analyzer to a concentration and the
results are shown on the liquid crystal display (LCD) screen. The assays for use on the
Analyzer include total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL),
triglycerides (TRG), glucose (GLU), and by calculation, low-density lipoprotein (LDL).
The modification that is the subject of this submission is with regards to a software
upgrade. The software used to run the Alere Cholestech LDX® Analyzer is provided as
an upgradable Read Only Memory (ROM) Pack that connects to the Analyzer on the
back panel. The ROM pack upgrade includes a humidity sensor attached to the front
casing of the ROM pack and is backwards compatible to all Alere Cholestech LDX®
Analyzers. The sensor is connected to the existing circuit board.

L. Test Principle:
The Alere Cholestech LDX® System combines enzymatic methodology and solid-
phase technology to measure total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and
glucose. Samples used for testing can be whole blood from a fingerstick (collected in a
lithium heparin-coated capillary tube) or venipuncture. The sample is applied to an
Alere Cholestech LDX® cassette. The cassette is then placed into the Alere Cholestech
LDX® Analyzer where a unique system on the cassette separates the plasma from the
blood cells. A portion of the plasma flows to the right side of the cassette and is
transferred to both the total cholesterol and triglyceride reaction pads. Simultaneously,
plasma flows to the left side of the cassette where the low- and very low-density
lipoproteins (LDL and VLDL) are precipitated with dextran sulfate (50,000 MW) and
magnesium acetate precipitating reagent.5 The filtrate, containing both glucose and
HDL cholesterol, is transferred to both the glucose and HDL cholesterol reaction pads.
The Alere Cholestech LDX® Analyzer measures total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol
by an enzymatic method based on the method formulation of Allain et al,5 and
Roeschlau.6 Cholesterol esterase hydrolyzes the cholesterol esters in the filtrate or
plasma to free cholesterol and the corresponding fatty acid. Cholesterol oxidase, in the

presence of oxygen, oxidizes free cholesterol to cholest-4-ene-3-one and hydrogen
peroxide. In a reaction catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase, the peroxide reacts with 4-
aminoantipyrine and N-ethyl-N-sulfohydroxypropyl-m-toluidine, sodium salt (TOOS)
to form a purple-colored quinoneimine dye proportional to the total cholesterol and
HDL cholesterol concentrations of the sample.
The Alere Cholestech LDX® Analyzer measures triglycerides by an enzymatic method
based on the hydrolysis of triglycerides by lipase to glycerol and free fatty acids.
Glycerol, in a reaction catalyzed by glycerol kinase, is converted to glycerol-3-
phosphate. In a third reaction, glycerol-3-phosphate is oxidized by glycerol phosphate
oxidase to dihydroxyacetone phosphate and hydrogen peroxide.7 The color reaction
utilizing horseradish peroxidase is the same as for the total cholesterol and HDL
cholesterol.
The Alere Cholestech LDX® Analyzer measures glucose by an enzymatic method that
uses glucose oxidase to catalyze the oxidation of glucose to gluconolactone and
hydrogen peroxide. The color reaction utilizing horseradish peroxidase is the same as
that for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. The resultant color in all
the reactions is measured by reflectance photometry.
A brown (magnetic) stripe on each cassette contains the calibration information
required for the Alere Cholestech LDX® Analyzer to convert the reflectance reading
(% R) to the total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose
concentrations.

Cholesterol and Triglycerides
The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute issued the Third Report of the
National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection,
Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment
Panel III) in May, 2001.1 The ATP III report presents NCEP’s updated clinical
guidelines for cholesterol testing and management and describes the following
classifications for cholesterol and triglyceride testing:
Analyte mg/dL mmol/L Classification
LDL cholesterol <100 <2.59 Optimal
100 –129 2.59 – 3.34 Near optimal/above optimal
130 –159 3.36 – 4.11 Borderline high
160 –189 4.14 – 4.89 High
≥190 ≥4.91 Very high
Total cholesterol <200 <5.18 Desirable
200 – 239 5.18 – 6.19 Borderline high
≥240 ≥6.22 High
HDL cholesterol <40 <1.03 Low
≥60 ≥1.55 High
Triglycerides <150 <1.69 Normal
150 –199 1.69 – 2.25 Borderline high
200 – 499 2.26 – 5.64 High
≥500 ≥5.65 Very high
The ATP III identified HDL cholesterol levels below 40 mg/dL (1.03 mmol/L) as
associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in men and women.1
A high HDL cholesterol level greater than or equal to 60 mg/dL (1.55 mmol/L) is
protective and decreases CHD risk.
TC/HDL Ratio
A ratio of 4.5 or less is desirable. A ratio greater than 6.0 suggests a high risk of
CHD.2
Non-HDL
ATP III identifies non-HDL cholesterol (total cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol)
as a secondary target of therapy in persons with high triglycerides (≥200 mg/dL).
7

--- Page 8 ---
The goal for non-HDL cholesterol in persons with high serum triglycerides can be
set at 30 mg/dL higher than that for LDL cholesterol on the premise that a VLDL
cholesterol level ≤30 mg/dL is normal.1
Glucose
The American Diabetes Association has identified categories of increased risk for
diabetes based upon glucose4:
• Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 100 -125 mg/dL (5.6 -6.9 mmol/L);
impaired fasting glucose
• 2-hr plasma glucose in the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)
140 -199 mg/dL (7.8 -11.0 mmol/L); impaired glucose tolerance
For these tests, risk is continuous, extending below the lower limit of the range and
becoming disproportionately greater at higher ends of the range.
The American Diabetes Association has criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes
mellitus based upon glucose4:
• FPG ≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/l). Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at
least 8 hr.
• 2-h plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during an OGTT. The test
should be performed as described by the World Health Organization, using
a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved in
water.
• In a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis,
a random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L).
In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, diagnosis should be confirmed by
repeat testing. When screening for diabetes, any abnormal glucose result should be
referred to a physician for further follow-up.
