I. Device Description:
HSV-1 IgG Immunoassay:
The HSV-1 IgG is a two-step sandwich immunoassay with streptavidin
microparticles, biotinylated recombinant HSV-1-specific antigen labeled with
ruthenium complex and electrochemiluminescence detection. This assay is a
qualitative test based on a cut-off formula dependent on the negative and positive
calibrators. Cut-off index (COI) is based on the ratio of assay signal to cut-off signal
(also abbreviated s/co). COI values greater than or equal to 1.0 are considered
positive for the presence of anti-HSV-1 IgG antibody. Results are determined using a
two-point calibration. The test system contains the human serum-based calibrators
intended for use with the system.
PreciControl HSV:
The PreciControl HSV consists of two controls that are used for monitoring the
accuracy of the HSV-1 IgG immunoassay. This product is manufactured as two
bottles of lyophilized human serum with added HSV-1 IgG in two different
2

concentration ranges: human serum negative for HSV-1 IgG (target value = 0.30
COI) and human serum positive to HSV-1 IgG (target value = 4.00 COI).
Note: The reagents and calibrator are packaged together in the HSV-1 IgG
immunoassay, while the associated PreciControl is packaged separately.

L. Test Principle:
The HSV-1 IgG immunoassay is a two-step sandwich electrochemiluminsecent
immunoassay. During the first step, samples are incubated with biotinylated HSV-1-
specific recombinant antigens (E. coli) labeled with a ruthenium complex: Tris (2,2’-
bipyridyl)ruthenium(II)-complex. If anti-HSV-1 IgG is present in the samples, it will
bind to the ruthenium-labeled complex (HSV-1/IgG complex). In the second step,
streptavidin-coated microparticles are added. These will bind to the biotin in the
HSV-1/IgG complex. In the third step, the reaction mixture is aspirated into the
measuring cell where the microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of

the electrode. Any unbound substances are removed with the ProCell/ProCell M.
Application of a voltage to the electrode then induces chemiluminescent emission
which is measured by a photomultiplier. Results are determined automatically by the
software by comparing the electrochemiluminescence signal obtained from the
reaction product of the sample with the signal of the cutoff value previously obtained
by the HSV-1 IgG calibration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the HSV-1 IgG immunoassay was evaluated on the cobas e 411 and
cobas e 601 analyzers. Reproducibility was evaluated on the cobas e 411 analyzer.
Both assays used Elecsys reagents and were conducted according to CLSI EP5-
A2 and CLSI EP15-A2 for precision and reproducibility, respectively.
For precision, five human sera (high positive, low positive, and moderate
positive) and two control sera (PreciControl 1 and PreciControl 2) were tested in
duplicate, two runs per day for 21 days with one reagent lot with calibration
according to the instructions for use. The results of these studies are presented
below.

Interference (Endogenous substances):
The impact of endogenous interfering substances on the HSV-1 IgG immunoassay
was determined by testing natural and spiked serum samples. Spiked serum
samples were created by diluting the serum with the interfering substance in 10%
increments. The following substances were evaluated in three pools of human
serum samples (negative for HSV-1 IgG, positive for HSV-1 IgG, and near the
cut-off):

The level of each potentially interfering substance is as follows:
Hemoglobin: 100 mg/dL (low), 1000 mg/dL (high)
Biotin: 7.0 ng/mL (low), 70 ng/mL (high)
Intralipid®: 200 mg/dL (low), 2000 mg/dL (high)
Bilirubin: 6.6 mg/dL (low), 66.0 mg/dL (high)
Rheumatoid Factor (RF): 10 IU/mL (low), 1500 IU/mL (high)
The potentially interfering endogenous substances were added to the samples
(“spiked sample”) and then samples were evaluated in duplicate. The percent
recovery COI was determined for each spiked sample and compared to the
reference (“unspiked”) sample. The % recovery was determined by dividing the
mean value of the measured concentration by the expected concentration. The
acceptance criterion was a recovery of positive samples within ± 20% of the
initial value
All positive and near cut-off samples showed a change of signal less than 5% for
all interfering substances except the near cut-off sample spiked with RF. Near cut-
off samples spiked with RF showed a dose-dependent increase in the % recovery
(maximum % recovery was 107.3 at the 1500 IU/mL dose). All positive samples
remained positive. No sample went from positive to negative or negative to
positive. Negative samples showed a deviation in COI that was ≤ 0.01 for all
interfering substances except RF. Negative samples spiked with RF showed a
dose-dependent increase in COI deviation. The maximum COI deviation was 0.05
at the 1500 IU/mL dose. No interference was produced in the assay by the
presence of hemoglobin, biotin, Intralipid®, and bilirubin.
Interference (Drugs):
A total of 21 drugs were tested for interference with the HSV-1 IgG
immunoassay. Samples were created by adding drug into human serum samples.
All drugs were evaluated in three pools of human serum samples (negative for
HSV-1 IgG, positive for HSV-1 IgG, and near the cut-off). The drugs used and
the concentration at which they were tested are listed below:
Compound Concentration
Acetylcysteine 150 mg/L
Ampicillin-Na 1000 mg/ L
Ascorbic acid 300 mg/ L
Ca- Dobesilate 200 mg/L
Cyclosporine 5 mg/L

samples Ibuprofen 500 mg/L (“spiked sample”)

Special Drugs evaluated in
Aciclovir 1.2 mg/L triplicate. The percent
recovery Famvir 0.25 mg/L COI was determined
for each Valaciclovir 3 mg/L spiked sample and
compared to the reference (“unspiked”) sample. The % recovery was determined
by dividing the mean value of the measured concentration by the expected
concentration. The acceptance criterion was a recovery of positive samples within
± 3 SD or ± 10% (whichever is a tighter criterion) of the value for the unspiked
(reference) sample.
Negative samples spiked with drug did not show a change in COI compared to the
reference. All near cut off samples showed a change in signal ≤ 0.05 COI
compared to the unspiked reference. In the near cut off samples, the maximum
COI deviation occurred in the samples spiked with Cefoxitin (-0.03 COI) and
Acetylsalicylic Acid (-0.04 COI). All positive samples showed a change in signal
≤ 0.10 COI compared to the unspiked reference. In the positive samples, the
maximum COI deviation occurred in the samples spiked with Cefoxitin (-0.43
COI), Phenylbutazone (+0.11 COI), and Acetylsalicylic Acid (-0.15 COI). These
results met the acceptance criteria as the recovery of the spiked samples was
within 10% of the value for the reference sample (reference sample for all three
was 7.13 COI therefore the acceptance criterion was ± 0.713).
f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off for the HSV-1 IgG immunoassay was initially established by
measuring 269 native human sera samples from two cohorts: sexually active
adults and pregnant women. The distribution of negative and positive samples
was determined on the cobas e 411 immunoassay analyzer using lab lot reagents.
The results from this study are summarized in the graph below.

These results were then compared to the predicate device, the Focus HerpeSelect
IgG Immunoblot. Discrepant positives (false positives) and discrepant negatives
(false negatives) were compared in the two cohorts and summarized in the
following table.

Based on these results, the cut-off was set between 25,000 and 30,000 counts.
This was selected in an effort to minimize the number of false positives.
The cut-off was verified/challenged using a selection of 85 near cut-off samples
(taken from 1248 commercially available native human sera) that were tested with
the Focus HerpeSelect IgG Immunoblot and the HSV-1 IgG immunoassay. The
percent positive agreement and the percent negative agreement were determined
for various cut-off levels. They are reported in the table below.
Figure 2. Agreement of Negative and Positive Results in Samples Near the
Cut-Off
A cut-off of 28,000 was selected as the percent negative agreement was 95% and
due to a very low number of false positives.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with reference method:
The performance of the HSV-1 IgG immunoassay was evaluated in a clinical
study by comparing the subject device against a reference method, FDA-cleared
immunoblot. When samples repeatedly tested equivocal in the reference method,
a confirmatory method, the University of Washington Western blot, was used to
resolve these results, as per the reference method labeling instructions. Any
remaining equivocal or discordant result was counted against the HSV-1 IgG
immunoassay in the performance analysis.
15

--- Page 16 ---
b. Matrix comparison:
The effect of anticoagulants on the detection of analyte in HSV-1 IgG
immunoassay was determined on the cobas e 411 analyzer by comparing values
obtained from human serum samples drawn into serum, lithium-heparin plasma,
K -EDTA-Plasma, K -EDTA-Plasma, and serum-gel separation primary tubes. At
2 3
least 35 serum/plasma pairs were tested for each of the anticoagulants. For each
anticoagulant, three serum concentrations were tested (negative, near cut-off, and
positive). Each sample was tested in triplicate. The acceptance criterion was a
recovery of positive plasma samples within ± 20% of the serum reference value
(serum drawn into primary tubes without gel). All anticoagulant –treated plasma
samples met this criterion. The results of this study are displayed in the summary
table below.

Clinical study populations:
A multi-center study was conducted in the U.S. to characterize the performance of
HSV-1 IgG immunoassay. All subjects were tested with the HSV-1 immunoassay
on the cobas e 411 analyzer and with an acceptable reference method.
All samples were collected prospectively at the specimen collection sites and then
stored frozen before shipment to Roche. Upon arrival at Roche, samples were
divided into aliquots, refrozen, and then shipped to the study sites for testing. All
testing was performed using a sample which had been frozen and thawed once.
Among the samples, 325 (40.6%) were females and 475 (59.4%) were males.
Ages ranged from 16 to 90 years. All female subjects were tested for pregnancy at
a single site using the Roche human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) +beta assay on
the Elecsys 2010 analyzer.
A total of 800 samples were obtained from multiple specimen sources,
representing subjects for whom HSV-1 testing would be ordered and a low
prevalence group. These populations included: sexually active individuals with an
HSV-1 IgG and/or HSV-2 IgG test ordered (n = 600) and low prevalence
population (n = 200). Out of the 600 samples collected from the sexually active
group, 125 samples were identified as pregnant women. The specimens were
tested with both the reference method and with the HSV-1 IgG immunoassay on
the cobas e 411 analyzer.
Samples that repeatedly tested equivocal on the predicate device (n = 13) were
resolved using a validated Western blot reference test (University of Washington,
Seattle, WA), as per the instructions of the predicate device package insert. One
sample in the sexually active cohort remained unresolved after testing with
Western blot. This sample was scored as discrepant against the HSV-1 IgG
immunoassay (see Table 8.3.6.7 below).

A panel of serum samples (n = 100) was obtained from the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and tested for confirmatory purposes. The
CDC sample panel was tested on the HSV-1 IgG immunoassay on the cobas e 411
analyzer and then results were sent to the CDC for evaluation. The panel
consisted of 52 samples negative for HSV-1 IgG and 48 samples positive for
HSV-1 IgG. The HSV-1 IgG immunoassay demonstrated 100% positive
agreement (48/48) and 100% negative agreement (52/52) with the results from the
CDC.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The HSV-1 IgG immunoassay was used to evaluate the prevalence of HSV-1 IgG
antibodies in expectant mothers and sexually active adults. The prospective study
population for the HSV-1 IgG immunoassay consisted of 800 patients. Of these
800 subjects, 200 were low-risk individuals and 600 were sexually active
individuals, with 125 of the sexually active individuals identified as a pregnant
sub-cohort. The data for the intended use population (600 specimens) have been
summarized according to age group in decades, gender, number of reactive
results, and number of non-reactive results.
