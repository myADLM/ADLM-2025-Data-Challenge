H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Piccolo HDL Test System used with the Piccolo xpress Chemistry Analyzer is
intended for the in vitro quantitative determination of HDL in capillary (fingerstick)
heparinized whole blood in a clinical laboratory setting or point-of-care location.
Lipoprotein measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of lipid disorders (such
as diabetes mellitus), atherosclerosis, and various liver and renal diseases.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
The Piccolo xpress Chemistry Analyzer
I. Device Description:
The Piccolo@ Lipid Panel Reagent Disc (which contains the Piccolo@ HDL Test
System) is designed to separate a heparinized whole blood sample into plasma and
blood cells. The disc meters the required quantity of plasma and diluent, mixes the
plasma with diluent, and delivers the mixture to the reaction cuvettes along the disc
perimeter. The diluted plasma mixes with the reagent beads, initiating the chemical reactions
that are then monitored by the Piccolo xpress Chemistry Analyzer.

L. Test Principle:
The Piccolo HDL – Capillary Test System (which contains the Piccolo HDL Test System) is
designed to separate a heparinized whole blood sample into plasma and blood cells without
operator intervention when run on the Abaxis analyzer. The disc meters the required quantity
of plasma and diluent, mixes the plasma with diluent, and delivers the mixture to the reaction
cuvettes along the disc perimeter. The diluted plasma mixes with the reagent beads, initiating
the chemical reactions that are then monitored by the analyzer.

The Abaxis HDL assay is a precipitation method that utilizes polyethylene glycol-modified
cholesterol esterase (PEG-CE) and cholesterol oxidase (PEG-CO) for additional specificity.
Minute quantities of reagents are formed into lyophilized microspheres and placed in reaction
cuvettes along the periphery of the reagent disc. Microspheres are made using proprietary
technology developed by Abaxis.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance
a. Precision and Reproducibility
Serum and plasma precision has been established in the original submission for
k023640. Additional whole blood precision studies were performed by running 5
patient samples seven times each across 4 Piccolo analyzers over a period of 3 hours,
as shown in the table below:
HDL
Sample #1 #2 #3 #4 #5
Average, mg/dL 53.1 73.9 55.8 41.0 52.6
SD 1.5 1.3 1.8 1.6 1.5
%CV 2.8 1.7 3.3 3.8 2.9
n 28 28 28 28 28
The precision results were found to be equivalent to the performance using serum
samples.
Accuracy of the Piccolo method for HDL was established by completing the
certification process of the CRMLN.
b. Linearity
Previously established in k023640
c. Traceability and Expected values for controls, calibrators, or methods
Previously established in k023640
d. Detection Limit

An interference study was performed for endogenous interferents: hemoglobin,
bilirubin and triglyceride and it was found that capillary blood determinations for
HDL are slightly more sensitive to lipemia than previously determined as shown in
the table below:

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison study was conducted at three point-of-care sites as per CLSI
EP9-A2. A total of 559 capillary whole blood samples were tested both on the
Piccolo HDL Test using the Piccolo xpress Analyzer and on the predicate device, the
Roche HDL Test using a Roche Cobas 6000 analyzer. The results are shown in the
