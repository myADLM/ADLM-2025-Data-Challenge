L. Test Principle:
Rabbit monoclonal anti-human antibody ER α, Clone EP1, specifically binds to the
estrogen receptor-α antigen located in the nuclear region of a variety of normal and
neoplastic tissues. Automated immunohistochemical staining is performed on
routinely processed, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens using a
specific heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) method and incubation with the
primary rabbit monoclonal antibody ER α, Clone EP1. The procedure employs a
ready-to-use horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked visualization reagent. And the
enzymatic conversion of the added DAB+ chromogen results in the formation of a
visible reaction product at the antigen site. Specimen may then be counterstained and
coverslipped and visualized with a light microscope.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision:
Precision study was conducted with serial sections from12 different formalin-
fixed paraffin-embedded human breast carcinoma tissue blocks, representing a
dynamic range of ER expression which included samples around the cutoff.
Testing was performed by three operators at a single site, utilizing a single
instrument (Autostainer Link 48) per operator. Tissue sections were stained
with ER α, clone EP1 antibody using Dako EnVision™ FLEX visualization
system protocol.
Study was focused on proportion scores based on a 0 to 5 scale and the goal
was to demonstrate that estrogen receptor status (positive or negative) will
remain the same within a specimen tested across all variables. A specimen is
considered estrogen receptor-positive if ≥1% tumor cells display nuclear
staining of any intensity.
Intra-run: Triplicate slides from each of 12 specimens were stained with ER α,
clone EP1 antibody on one Autostainer Link 48 instrument by one operator in
a single run. Concurrently one section from each block was also stained with a
negative control reagent.
Inter-run: A single slide from each specimen was stained with ER α, clone
EP1 antibody on the same one Link 48 instrument by the same one operator
and repeated for five non-consecutive days. Concurrently, one section from
each tissue block was also stained with a negative control reagent.
Inter-instrument/Inter-operator: A single slide from each of 12 specimens
were stained with ER α, clone EP1 antibody on three unique Autostainer Link
48 instruments by three different operators on the same day. Concurrently,
4

--- Page 5 ---
one slide from each tissue block was also stained with a negative control
reagent
All 12 specimens stained with ER α, EP1 clone antibody for intra-run, inter-
run and inter-operator had a 100% concordance agreement with regard to the
Estrogen Receptor Status (Positive or Negative). And all Specimens stained
with the NCR were negative with 0 specific staining and <1 background
staining.
Reproducibility:
Study was conducted at 2 U.S sites and 1 foreign site. A set of 18 randomized
(9 positive and 9 negative) breast cancer tissue blocks expressing different
levels of ER α which also included samples around the cutoff, were selected
by screening cut sections of FFPE tissues. Tissue sections were stained on
Dako Autostainer Link 48 instruments by performing 5 separate automated
runs at each study site for 5 non-consecutive days. The first automated run for
18 specimens included a control slide stained with ER α, clone EP1 antibody,
and a negative control reagent (NCR) slide. A total of 270 tissue sections
were employed for the staining runs performed with the ER α, clone EP1
primary antibody reagent. Comparative results for the 3 study sites were
within the established value of ≥85% set for negative percent agreement,
positive percent agreement, and total percent agreement. Summary results of

Lot-to-Lot Reproducibility study:
A single site, blinded, randomized, comparative study using 3 lots of antibody
and full tissue sections of FFPE breast cancer tissue expressing differing
levels of ER was conducted to assess lot-to-lot reproducibility. Three separate
automated runs (11, 11 and 8 specimens) using a total of 30 different FFPE
breast cancer tissue specimens, plus a positive and negative control slides, on
Dako Autostainer Link48 instruments were stained with 3 different lots of the
primary antibody and the appropriate negative control reagent (NCR). In
addition, slides were scored and staining characteristics recorded by a single
licensed pathologist. Lot-to-lot reproducibility within the 3 lots was evaluated
by calculating the negative percent agreement, positive percent agreement,
and total percent agreement of each paired lot. The range of negative percent
agreement was above 92.9% to 100% across all lots, positive percent
agreement was 100% across all lots and the total percent agreement was 96.7
to 100%.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability:
Stability was tested for 3 manufactured lots of RTU rabbit monoclonal anti-
human ER α, clone EP1 at specified time intervals in real time and in-use/on-
board stability at 2-80 C, 250C, 370C and 450C. Prior to testing one lot of the
antibody was also subjected to a rigorous transport simulation test i.e., 3
freeze/thawing cycles and incubation at 350C – 390C for 16-24 hours and at
280C – 320C for 4 days. Results demonstrated an interim shelf life of 12
months when store at 2 -80C, based on the acceptance criteria of a positive
specific staining in the nucleus of ER α-positive cells and that results of
specimens stained with the aged Rabbit Monoclonal anti-Human ER α, should
vary by no more than 0.5 grade specific staining intensity when compared to
baseline and the freshly diluted EP1 clone antibody.
Control:
Positive and negative controls should be performed with each staining run.
The pathologist is responsible for assuring that the assay is performing
properly.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
Sections from 90 normal tissues were tested with the ER α, clone EP1 and
Dako EnVision™ FLEX visualization system. Results demonstrated negative
immunoreactivity with most tissues expected to be negative and positive
nuclear staining was observed in a subset of normal cells from seven tissue
types including epithelial cells and/or stromal cells from breast, cervix,
esophagus, ovary, prostate, tonsil and uterus. The distribution of ER α, Clone
EP1 normal tissue reactivity is summarized in the table below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A blinded, randomized concordance study was conducted at 3-sites using
FFPE full tissue sections containing invasive breast cancer and ductal
carcinoma in situ (DCIS) that exhibited differing levels of ER α expression.
A set of 173 different FFPE invasive breast cancer tissue samples were pre-
screened with the ER α component of the ER/PR pharmDx kit to ensure that
there was an approximately equal distribution of ER α -positive and ER α -
negative specimens and that a number of samples expressing ER α staining
levels near the cut-off value of >1% to 10% stained tumor cells were
