2. Indication(s) for use:
The Piccolo Triglycerides – Capillary Test System used with the Piccolo xpress
Chemistry Analyzer is intended for the in vitro quantitative determination of triglycerides
in capillary (fingerstick) heparinized whole blood in a clinical laboratory setting or point-
of-care location.
Triglyceride measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with
diabetes mellitus, nephrosis, liver obstruction, and other diseases involving lipid
metabolism, or various endocrine disorders.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use
4. Special instrument requirements:
Piccolo xpress Chemistry Analyzer
I. Device Description:
The Piccolo Triglycerides – Capillary Test System is composed of an 8 cm diameter single-
use device constructed from three ultrasonically welded injection molded parts. The base and
middle layers are formed of polymethylmethacrylate plastic and create the chambers,
cuvettes, and passageways for processing the whole blood and mixing the resulting
heparinized plasma with diluent and reagents. The top layer, referred to as the bar code ring,
is molded from ABS (acrylonitrile, butadiene, and styrene) plastic. The bar code ring is
imprinted with a bar code containing disc-specific calibration information and also functions
to trap small blood spills, preventing contamination of the analyzer, and to protect the disc
optical surfaces from fingerprints.
In the center of the disc there is a molded high-density polyethylene plastic container holding
approximately 480 µL of diluent. The diluent container is sealed with polyethylene-
laminated foil. Spherical lyophilized reagent beads are placed in the cuvettes during disc
manufacture. Cuvettes are made in five different depths. As part of the optical system, the
specific depth, or pathlength, is chosen to compliment the reagent sensitivity and analyte
concentrations of each test.
The test is performed by means of an enzymatic reaction that leads to a change in color. The
measurement of the intensity of the color is directly proportional to the concentration of
triglycerides in the sample.
Upon completion of the analysis, the disc, containing the diluted heparinized plasma and
blood cells, may be placed back into its foil pouch and is disposed of in a biohazard
container.

L. Test Principle:
The Piccolo Triglycerides – Capillary Test System will initially be contained on the Lipid
Panel – Capillary Reagent Disc. The disc is designed to separate a heparinized whole blood
sample into plasma and blood cells when run on the Abaxis analyzer. This is achieved
automatically within the analyzer without operator intervention. The disc meters the required
quantity of plasma and diluent, mixes the plasma with diluent, and delivers the mixture to the
reaction cuvettes along the disc perimeter. The diluted plasma mixes with the reagent beads,
initiating the chemical reactions that are then monitored by the analyzer. The acceptable
sample that may be run on the Piccolo Lipid Panel – Capillary Reagent Disc is heparinized
whole blood from capillary (fingerstick) collection.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Point of care precision was previously established in k023639.
Additional precision studies were performed using 5 whole blood samples over a 3-
hour time frame using at least 4 different analyzers for each of 7 time points. A total
of 20 analyzers were used. The table below summarizes the data.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Roche Triglycerides Test (k893973) was used as the predicate method, using
recommended applications and procedures on a Roche Cobas 6000 analyzer. Five
hundred eighty eight capillary (fingerstick) samples were assayed in parallel by both
the test and predicate methods and the results compared by Deming regression. The
studies were performed at three point-of-care sites. The range tested was 36 to 496
mg/dL which spans the assay range of 20- 500 mg/dL. No samples were altered
(spiked or diluted). Data for each site and combined data are shown below:
