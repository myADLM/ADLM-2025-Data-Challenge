K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None were referenced.
L. Test Principle:
This enzymatic method is based on the method by Slein using hexokinase and
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzymes. The ADVIA Chemistry Glucose
Hexokinase_3 (GLUH_3) method is a two-component reagent. Sample is added to
Reagent 1, which contains the buffer, ATP, and NAD. Absorbance readings of the
sample in Reagent 1 are taken and are used to correct for interfering substances in the
sample. Reagent 2 is added, which initiates the reaction. Glucose is phosphorylated
by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the presence of hexokinase. The glucose-6-
phosphate that forms is oxidized in the presence of glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase causing the reduction of NAD to NADH. The absorbance of NADH is
measured as an endpoint reaction at 340/410 nm. The difference between the
absorbance in Reagent 1 and Reagent 2 is proportional to the glucose concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The ADVIA Chemistry Glucose Hexokinase (GLUH_3) Reagent was previously
510(k) cleared under k101854. The only change to the device in the current
submission is the addition of an additional anticoagulant, sodium fluoride/potassium
oxalate. Additional testing was performed and submitted to demonstrate that the
performance of sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate samples is substantially equivalent
to the originally cleared device. All other performance data was previously reviewed
under 510(k) number k101854, which is referenced below.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Previously cleared, see k101854
b. Matrix comparison:
Eighty two matched serum plasma sample sets were compared with the
device. Serum and plasma sample sets were each collected from the same
patient. The plasma was collected in the anticoagulant being evaluated. The
samples consisted of 56 unaltered patient samples and 26 samples that were
either spiked with glucose or diluted in order to cover the complete measuring
range of the device. Samples ranged in concentration from 5 – 691 mg/dL.
Each sample was measured n=1 on the Siemens ADVIA 1650 Chemistry
System. Linear regression was performed with the following results: y =
1.011x + 0.78 with r=0.999. The 95% confidence intervals were 1.003 –
1.019 for the slope and -1.18 to 2.73 for the y-intercept.
Urine and CSF samples are not derived from whole blood and are not directly
comparable to serum and plasma samples so they were not tested in this
evaluation.
