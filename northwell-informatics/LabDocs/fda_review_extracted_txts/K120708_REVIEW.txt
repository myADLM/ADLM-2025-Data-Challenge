ISO 15197:2003 In Vitro Diagnostic Test Systems- Requirements For In Vitro Whole
Blood Glucose
L. Test Principle:
The OneTouch Verio Blood Glucose Monitoring System employs flavin adenine
dinucleotide-glucose dehydrogenase (GDH-FAD) enzyme chemistry as the standard dry
reagent assay for glucose in whole blood. This enzyme assay, with a redox chemical
“mediator” reaction, is used to generate an electrical current proportional to the glucose
concentration in the blood sample. The system is designed as an amperometric
measurement device using current generated from the redox reaction as the measurable
response.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability
Venous blood from one donor with nominal hematocrit (37 - 45%) collected with
lithium heparin anticoagulant, was adjusted with glucose to five glucose levels
(30-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-250, 251-400) across the claimed range and tested
on three lots of production strips on 30 meters (10 meters per test strip lot). Ten
replicates were tested per meter, test strip lot and glucose concentration. The
testing for each group of 10 meters was executed by one operator over one day.

In this study, venous blood from nine donors (with nominal hematocrits of 37-
45%) was adjusted to eight target glucose levels (20, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600
and 700 mg/dL) and tested with 3 OneTouch Verio Test Strip lots on eight
OneTouch Verio Sync Blood Glucose Meters. Each sample was also assayed
with the YSI reference method. Note: The target glucose of 700 mg/dL exceeds
that of the claimed OneTouch Verio Sync Blood Glucose Monitoring System
glucose concentration range which is 20 - 600 mg/dL. The meters were modified
to display a glucose result greater than 600 mg/dL. Linear regression of the data
produced the following:
Strip Intercept (with
Slope (with 95% CI) r2
Lot 95% CI)
1 2.8 (2.1 – 3.5) 0.969 (0.965 – 0.972) 0.996
2 4.6 (3.9 – 5.3) 0.958 (0.954 – 0.961) 0.996
3 5.2 (4.4 – 5.9) 0.973 (0.969 – 0.976) 0.996
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range
of 20 – 600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The OneTouch Verio Sync Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to the
NIST SRM 917b reference material.
Test Strip Stability
Closed vial (shelf life) stability was assessed in real-time studies. The protocols
and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The testing
supported the claimed shelf life of 22 months when stored at 41 - 86° F (5 - 30°
C).
Opened vial (in-use) stability was assessed in real-time studies. The protocols
and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The testing
supported the open vial stability of six months when stored at 41 - 86° F (5 - 30°
C).
Control Solution Stability:
Control shelf-life stability (closed vial) was assessed in real-time studies. The
protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The
testing supported the claimed shelf life of 24 months when stored at 41 - 86° F (5
- 30° C).

Control in-use stability (open vial) was assessed in real-time studies. The
protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The
testing supported the open vial stability of six months when stored at 41 - 86° F (5
- 30° C).
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the OneTouch Verio Sync Blood Glucose Monitoring
System is 20 – 600 mg/dL. This range was validated by the linearity study
(M.1.b).
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed interference studies in accordance with CLSI EP7-A.
Testing was performed in parallel (control samples vs. test samples) to minimize
the effects of glucose metabolism.
Venous blood was drawn into Lithium heparin anticoagulant tubes from healthy
volunteers. The glucose levels tested were 65 and 240 mg/dL. Samples were
allowed to glycolyze or were spiked, as needed, to achieve the 65 and 240 mg/dL
glucose levels. A low and high concentration of each potential interferent was
then tested at each glucose level. The following substances were found not to
interfere at the concentrations listed:

System Accuracy Study
To assess system accuracy, results from the OneTouch Verio Sync Blood Glucose
Monitoring System were compared to a reference method (YSI 2300). Capillary
fingerstick samples from 100 participants with glucose concentrations ranging
from 40 - 434 mg/dL were analyzed with the candidate device and with YSI.
Three samples were collected from each fingerstick. The first was used for the
Verio Sync measurement, the second for the YSI measurement, and the third for a
hematocrit measurement. Two participant samples were allowed to glycolyze to
obtain a glucose concentration < 50 mg/dL and three participant samples were
spiked to obtain a glucose concentration > 400 mg/dL. The results relative to the
reference method are summarized in the tables below:

User Performance Study:
To assess the performance of the Verio Sync Blood Glucose Monitoring System
in the hands of the intended users, the sponsor performed a study with 273
untrained lay user participants. Each participant collected and analyzed their own
fingerstick sample. A second fingerstick sample was then collected and analyzed
on the YSI reference method. The study was performed at three clinical sites and
the gender breakdown was 53% male and 47% female. Three lots of test strips
were used and single measurements collected by the users were compared to the
reference method. None of the samples were altered before analysis. The range of
glucose values for the samples as measured by the reference method was 49 - 506
mg/dL. Results are summarized below:

using wireless transmission?
Yes No
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes
for this line of product types:
Yes No
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied
directly to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger only.
The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.
5. Calibration:
There is no calibration required for the OneTouch Verio BGMS by the user. The
meter is plasma-calibrated.
6. Quality Control:
Glucose control solutions at two different concentrations are supplied with the device.
The meter has an algorithm to automatically recognize when a control solution is
being analyzed. Control solution test results are stored in the meter, but are not sent
to the Apple device. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are
provided in the labeling. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the
test strip vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls
outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study
Three OneTouch Verio Test Strip lots were tested on 12 Verio Sync meters at
each of the following five hematocrit levels: 19, 30, 44, 50 and 61%. At each
hematocrit level, each lot was tested with three donor venous blood samples at
each of five glucose levels: 30, 66, 118, 233, 455, and 563 mg/dL. A single
replicate on each of the 12 meters was obtained for each combination of test
12

--- Page 13 ---
strip/glucose level/hematocrit and donor. This resulted in n = 180 data points per
strip lot at each hematocrit level (5 glucose levels x 3 donors x 12 meters).
Samples were also tested by the YSI reference method. The results demonstrated
that the OneTouch Verio Blood Glucose Monitoring System produces accurate
results over the claimed hematocrit range of 20 – 60%.
2. Sample Volume Study
The sponsor performed a sample volume study to support the claimed minimum
sample volume requirement for the OneTouch Verio Sync Blood Glucose
Monitoring System (0.4 µL) using blood samples at two glucose concentrations
(65 and 450 mg/dL). The system displays an error code when insufficient sample
is detected. Results support the claimed sample volume of 0.4 µL.
3. Altitude Study
In this study, three (3) test strip lots were tested on sixteen (16) Verio Sync meters
using venous blood from three (3) donors (with nominal hematocrit (37-45%))
and adjusting them to 70, 240 and 450 mg/dL. The samples were tested at three
altitude levels (3000, 6000 and 10,000 feet), and at sea level (0 feet) as a control.
This resulted in n = 288 data points per strip lot at each altitude level (3 donors x
3 glucose levels x 16 meters x 2 replicates). Each blood sample was also tested by
the YSI reference method. The bias relative to the reference method was
acceptable to support the claim that altitudes up to 10,000 feet do not significantly
affect the glucose results.
4. Temperature and Humidity Studies
The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies using venous blood
samples at target glucose concentrations of 65, 240 and 450 mg/dL to evaluate
temperatures ranging from 50 – 111°F (10 – 44°C) and relative humidity from 10
– 90 %. Combinations of the claimed temperature and humidity operating
conditions were evaluated by comparing meter results to the YSI reference
method. The bias relative to the reference method was acceptable to support the
claim that temperatures from 50 – 111° F (10 – 44°C) and relative humidity from
10 – 90% do not significantly affect the glucose results.
5. Infection Control Studies
This device is intended for single patient use.
Clorox Germicidal wipes (EPA registration #67619-2) were validated
demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus using materials from the meter
and lancing device. The sponsor also demonstrated (separately for each product)
that there was no change in performance or in the external materials after 310
cleaning and disinfection cycles for the meter and lancing device (one cycle
13

--- Page 14 ---
includes one cleaning wipe plus one disinfecting wipe). This simulated 3 years of
use for the meter and lancing device. Labeling was reviewed for adequate
instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
6. EMC testing
Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Testing was evaluated and certified by
Elliott Laboratories, Inc. and a letter of attestation dated September 6, 2011 was
submitted stating that the device met all of the requirements of the following
standards:
IEC 60068-2-64:1993
IEC 61010-1 :2001
IEC 61326-1 :2005, IEC 61326-2-6:2005 and IEC 61010-2-101
7. Readability Assessment
The sponsor provided a readability assessment of the Owner’s Booklet and Test
Strip Insert, The Flesch-Kincaid analysis produced a grade level of 8.3 and 7.9
respectively.
