Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline-Second Edition.
L. Test Principle:
Tri-level XN CHECK™ was designed to evaluate the accuracy and precision of the
Sysmex XN Series instruments. XN CHECK™ is for in-vitro diagnostic use only by
laboratory professionals.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Data were collected internally and at two external sites across 4 different
Sysmex XN-10 and XN-20 analyzers, throughout the product dating claim
with 3 separately manufactured lots of XN-CHECK™. Studies were
conducted for each lot at all three (3) sites, including a U.S site. The external
sites performed 10 consecutive runs on each XN Series Instrument with
separate vials of control from each lot. Control materials were shipped,
stored, mixed, and handled in accordance with the instruction for use.
Acceptance criteria were based on compilation of the CV% for each
measurand. Results collected across the three separately manufactured lots of
XN CHECK™ demonstrated consistent recovery across multiple instruments,
at multiple sites and were within the parameter specific assay assignment
ranges set forth for each measurand (shown in the tables below).

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Value assignments:
Value assignment was performed on four Sysmex (XN-10 and XN-20)
analyzers using two vials of each control level tested a minimum of five times
per vial. Data were entered into the internally validated QC link database
program (validation number PQ-062) to calculate the mean, standard
deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) for each parameter analyzed.
The database allows computation and comparison of data that is used in the
assay value assignment process as defined by controlled documents. The
expected range values assigned to the measurands were based on the ± 3.0 SD
of the total-run data and established product performance characteristics.
Total-run encompasses the values generated over multiple combined data sets
compiled for all three lots of control.
Reagent Stability
Acceptance criteria for open and closed-vial stability was based on a
compilation of the CV% for each measurand over data collected across four
different Sysmex XN-10 and XN-20 analyzers, at 3 sites, throughout the
product dating claim, with three separately manufactured lots of XN
CHECK™.
Open-vial stability: A 7 day open-vial stability claim was validated at the end
of the 84-day product expiration claim. Two vials of control/level from each
of the three reference lots were analyzed on XN series (XN-10, XN-20)
analyzer in duplicate over a period of eight days. On a daily basis, vials were
removed from storage and mixed in accordance with the instructions for use to
simulate daily customer usage/handling.
Closed-vial stability: Three separately manufactured lots of XN CHECK™
lots were set up to validate closed-vial stability performance throughout the 84
days expiration dating at refrigerated temperatures (2-8oC). Data were
collected using CLSI EP5-A2 methods on XN series (XN-10, XN-20)
analyzer.
All reported CV% values for open and closed vial reagent stability were
within the acceptable threshold values as shown in the tables above in section
M. 1(a).
