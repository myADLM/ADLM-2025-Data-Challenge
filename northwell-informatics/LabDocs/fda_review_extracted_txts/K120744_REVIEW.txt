Sysmex XN-10 and XN-20 analyzers, throughout the product dating claim
with 3 separately manufactured lots of XN-CHECK™ BF. Studies were
conducted for each lot at all three (3) sites. The external sites performed 10
consecutive runs on each XN Series Instrument with separate vials of control
from each lot. Control materials were shipped, stored, mixed, and handled in
accordance with the Instructions for Use (IFU). Acceptance criteria were
based on a compilation of the CV% for each measurand. Results collected
across the three separately manufactured lots of XN CHECK™ BF
demonstrated consistent recovery across multiple instruments at multiple sites
and were within the parameter specific assay assignment ranges set forth for
each measurand (see table below).

Streck performed analyses on four Sysmex (XN-10 and XN-20) analyzers
using two vials of each level of control, tested a minimum of five times per
vial. Data were entered into the internally validated QC link database
program (validation number PQ-062) to calculate the mean, standard
deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) for each parameter analyzed.

The database allows computation and comparison of data that is used in the
assay value assignment process as defined by controlled documents.
Expected range values assigned to each measurand were based on ± 3.0 SD
calculated from the total-run data collected. Total-run encompasses the values
generated over multiple combined datasets compiled for all three lots of
control.
Reagent Stability
Acceptance criteria for open and closed vial stability were based on
compilation of the CV% for each measurand on data collected across four
different Sysmex XN-10 and XN-20 analyzers, at 3 sites, throughout the
product dating claim, with three separately manufactured lots of XN
CHECK™ BF.
Open-vial stability:
30-day open-vial stability claim was validated at the end of the 84-day closed
vial product expiration claim on Sysmex XN-10 and XN-20 analyzer. Two
vials of each level of control from each of the three reference lots were
analyzed in duplicate at multiple testing intervals over a period greater than 30
days. On a daily basis, vials were removed from storage and mixed in
accordance with the instructions for use to simulate daily customer
usage/handling.
Closed-vial stability:
Three separately manufactured lots of XN CHECK™ BF lots were set up to
validate closed-vial stability performance throughout the 84-day expiration
dating at refrigerated temperature (2 - 8°C). Data were collected using CLSI
EP5-A2 methods on Sysmex XN-10 and XN-20 analyzers.
All reported CV% values for open and closed-vial reagent stability were
within the acceptable threshold values as shown in the tables above in section
M. 1(a).
