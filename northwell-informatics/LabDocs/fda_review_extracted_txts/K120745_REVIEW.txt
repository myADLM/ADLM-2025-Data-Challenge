XN-CAL™. Studies were conducted for each lot at all three (3) sites. The
external sites performed 10 consecutive runs on each XN Series Instrument
with separate vials of calibrator from each lot. Control materials were
shipped, stored, mixed, and handled in accordance with the instructions for
use. The acceptance criteria were based on a compilation of the CV% for
each measurand. Results across the three separately manufactured lots of XN
CAL™ demonstrated consistent recovery across multiple instruments, at
multiple sites within the parameter specific assay assignment ranges set forth
for each measurand (see table below).

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Value assignment:
Streck performed analyses on four Sysmex (XN-10 and XN-20) analyzers
using two vials of calibrator tested a minimum of five times per vial. Data
were entered into the internally validated QC link database program
(validation number PQ-062) to calculate the mean, standard deviation (SD),
and coefficient of variation (CV) for each parameter analyzed. The database
allows computation and comparison of data that is used in the value
assignment process as defined by controlled documents. Final assignment
values were determined using data collected and established product
performance characteristics. Expected range values assigned to the
measurands were based on 2.5 SD from the total-run data collected for XN
CAL™.
Reagent Stability
The acceptance criteria for open and closed-vial stability were based on a
compilation of the CV% for each measurand over data collected across four
different Sysmex XN-10 and XN-20 analyzers, at three sites, throughout the
product dating claim, with 3 separately manufactured lots of XN CAL™.
Open-vial stability: A 4 hour open-vial stability claim was validated at the end
of the 35-day product expiration claim on XN series (XN-10, XN-20)
analyzer. Two vials of calibrator from each reference lot were analyzed in
duplicate for three consecutive days (n=12) on one analyzer.

Closed-vial stability: Three separately manufactured lots of XN CAL™ were
set up to validate closed-vial stability performance throughout the 35-day
expiration dating at refrigerated temperatures (2 - 8ºC) on XN series (XN-10,
XN-20) analyzer. Data were collected using CLSI EP25-A methods.
All CV% values for reagent stability were within the acceptable threshold
values as shown in the table above in section M.1(a).
