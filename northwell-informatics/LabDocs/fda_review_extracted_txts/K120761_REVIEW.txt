H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Please see indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The LZI Opiate 2000 Immunoassay is intended for the qualitative and semi-quantitative
determination of morphine in human urine at a cutoff value of 2000 ng/mL. The assay is
designated for professional use with a number of automated clinical chemistry analyzers.
The semi-quantitative mode in for purpose of (1) enabling laboratories to determine an
appropriate dilution for the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as
GC/MS and LC/MS or (2) permitting laboratories to establish quality control procedures.
LZI Opiate 2000 Enzyme Calibrators are for use as calibrators in the qualitative and
semi-quantitative calibrations of the LZI Opiate 2000 Immunoassay at a cut off value of
2000 ng/mL.
LZI Opiate 2000 Enzyme Controls are for use as assayed quality control material to
monitor the precision of the LZI Opiate 2000 Immunoassay at a cut off value of 2000
ng/mL.
The assay provides only preliminary analytical result. A more specific alternative
chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas or
liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS or LC/MS) is the preferred
confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be
exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary test result
is positive.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use.
The assay provides only preliminary analytical test results.
A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed
analytical result. Gas or liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS or LC.MS)
is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment
should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary
test result is positive.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Testing was performed on the Hitachi 717 automatic analyzer.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

L. Test Principle:
The LZI Opiate 2000 Immunoassay is based on competition between drug in the sample and
the drug labeled with the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for a fixed
amount of antibody in the reagent. Enzyme activity decreases upon binding to the antibody,
and the drug concentration in the sample is measured in terms of enzyme activity. In the
absence of the drug in the sample, morphine-labeled G6PDH conjugate is bound to the
antibody, and the enzyme activity is inhibited. When free drug is present in the sample, the
antibody binds to the free drug; the unbound morphine-labeled G6PDH then exhibits
maximal enzyme activity. Active enzyme converts nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NAD) to NADH, resulting in an absorbance change that can be measured
spectrophotometrically at 340nm.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity across the range was confirmed by using a morphine standard obtained from
a commercial vendor and diluted several times using a pool of processed negative
urine to create a stock solution with a concentration 6000 ng/mL of morphine. This
stock was then diluted into twelve levels as presented in the table below. Each
sample was tested in replicates of 10 on the Hitachi 717 analyzer.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Five levels of calibrators (0, 1000, 2000, 4000 and 6000 ng/mL) and two levels of
control material (1500 and 2500 ng/mL) are available for use with the LZI Opiate
2000 Immunoassay. A commercially available morphine standard solution is used
and traceable to NIST standard. This standard solution is made into a secondary
(lower concentration) stock solution. The secondary stock solution is then spiked into
the calibrators and controls to the desired concentration. The concentrations are
confirmed by GC/MS.
Stability Studies:
Accelerated and long term studies for both controls and calibrators have been
conducted. Protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be
acceptable. The manufacturer claims the following expiration date for both controls
and calibrators:
When stored at 2-8 ºC unopened or opened product is stable until expiration date
which is 18 months.

d. Detection limit:
Performance at low drug concentrations in the semi-quantitative assay was
characterized by determination of recovery (see section b above).
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was established for the qualitative and semi-quantitative mode by
spiking various concentrations of each substance into drug-free urine and then
calibrated with the assay’s calibrated dose-response curve. Results are expressed as a
minimum concentration of metabolite or compound required to produce a response
approximately equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the assay. The percent cross-
reactivity of those compounds is presented below:

1.017, 1.020 and 1.022 were used. The samples were spiked to -25% of the cutoff and
125% of the cutoff. No positive or negative interference due to specific gravity was
observed.
f. Assay cut-off:
Analytical performance of the device around the claimed cutoff is described in
precision section (1 a.) above
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
One hundred and fifty unaltered clinical urine samples were evaluated by the Lin-Zhi
Opiate 2000 Enzyme Immunoassay on the Hitachi 717 analyzer and compared to
LC/MS. Results from the study are presented below:
