See Indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The LZI Oxycodone Enzyme Immunoassay is intended for the qualitative and
semi-quantitative determination of oxycodone in human urine at the cutoff values
of 100 and 300 ng/mL. The assay is designed for professional use with a number
of automated clinical chemistry analyzers.
The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of (1) enabling laboratories to
determine an appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a
confirmatory method such as GCMS and LCMS or (2) permitting laboratories to
establish quality control procedures.
The LZI Oxycodone Drug of Abuse (DAU) Calibrators are for use as calibrators
in the qualitative and semi-quantitative calibration of the LZI Oxycodone Enzyme
Immunoassay.
The LZI Oxycodone Drug of Abuse (DAU) Controls are for use as assayed
quality control materials to monitor the precision of the LZI Oxycodone Enzyme
Immunoassay.
The assay provides only a preliminary analytical result. A more specific
alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed
analytical result. Gas or Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS or
LC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and
professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result,
particularly when the preliminary test result is positive.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
Positive results should be confirmed by other affirmative, analytical methods
(e.g., chromatography), and preferably GC/MS or LC/MS.
The test is designed for use with human urine only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Performance characteristics have been validated on the Hitachi 717.
I. Device Description:
The assay consists of ready-to-use liquid reagents. Reagent 1 contains a mouse
monoclonal anti-oxycodone antibody, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), nicotinamide
2

--- Page 3 ---
adenine dinucleotide (NAD), stabilizers and sodium azide (0.09%) as a preservative.
Reagent 2 contains glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) labeled with
oxycodone in buffer with sodium azide (0.09%) as preservative.
The calibrators and controls are sold separately. The calibrator has 6 levels and the
control has 4 levels. They consist of human urine samples containing oxycodone with
sodium azide (0.09%) as preservative.

L. Test Principle:
The assay is based on competition between drug in the sample and drug labeled with
the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for a fixed amount of
antibody in the reagent. Enzyme activity decreases upon binding to the antibody, and
the drug concentration in the sample is measured in terms of enzyme activity. In the
absence of drug in the sample, oxycodone-labeled G6PDH conjugate is bound to
antibody, and the enzyme activity is inhibited. On the other hand, when drug is
present in the sample, antibody binds to the free drug; the unbound oxycodone-
labeled G6PDH then exhibits its maximal enzyme activity.
Active enzyme converts nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH,
resulting in an absorbance change that can be measured spectrophotometrically at 340
nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity across the range was tested by spiking negative urine samples to
increasing concentrations within the calibration ranges listed in the table
below. Each sample was assayed in replicates of 10 in the semi-quantitative
mode using all 6 calibrators for 100 ng/mL and 300 ng/mL cutoffs (0, 50, 100,
300, 500, 800 ng/mL). The results were averaged and compared to the
expected result and the percent recovery was calculated.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The controls and calibrators are prepared using commercially available
Oxycodone standard the accuracy of which is ensured by purity
determinations and gravimetric preparation using balances calibrated with
NIST traceable weight. Concentration of drug in the controls and calibrators
are confirmed by GC/MS analysis.
Stability
Real time testing is on going. Protocol and acceptance criterion were
described and found to be acceptable. Data obtained so far support 41 weeks
of product stability at 2-8oC for the calibrators and controls.

Interference
The potential effect of endogenous compounds and pH on the recovery of
Oxycodone was assessed by spiking known amounts of potentially interfering
substances into GC/MS verified negative urine and urine samples with
Oxycodone concentrations +/- 25% of the assay cut-off. Substances were
determined not to interfere with the assay if the recovery of the negative
sample was below the assay cut-off and if the +/-25% samples recovered
within 10% of a sample containing no interferent.

Note: All endogenous substances listed above, including specific gravity,
were also tested in “qualitative-mode”. No interference is observed. The
results are identical to the “semi-quantitative” mode as all samples gave
correct positive/negative result corresponding to the cutoff values of 100 or
300 ng/mL.

100 ng/mL cutoff
Eighty-nine (89) unaltered clinical urine specimens were tested with the LZI
Oxycodone Enzyme Immunoassay and confirmed with GC/MS or LC/MS.
Specimens having an Oxycodone concentration greater than 100 ng/mL by
GC/MS or LC/MS are defined as positive, and specimens with lower
concentrations by GC/MS or LC/MS are defined as negative in the table
below. The correlation results are summarized as follows: (near cutoff samples
