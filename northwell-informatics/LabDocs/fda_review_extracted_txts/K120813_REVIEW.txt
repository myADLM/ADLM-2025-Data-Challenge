4. Special instrument requirements
iHealth BG3 Meter
I. Device Description:
iHealth BG3 Smart Gluco-Monitoring System consist of blood glucose meter, test
strips, sterile lancets, lancing device and AGS1000I Control Solutions (Level I,
Level II and Level III) cleared under k110017.
The device iHealth BG3 Smart Gluco-Monitoring System is based on an
electrochemical biosensor technology (electrochemical) and the principle of capillary
action. Capillary action at the end of the test strip draws the blood into the action
chamber and the blood glucose result is displayed in 5 seconds. The control solution, ,
is used to test the performance of the device.

L. Test Principle:
The test is based on electrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of capillary
action. The electrical current generated by the reaction of glucose with the reagent of the
strip is measured by the meter and is displayed on an iPhone or iPod touch as the
corresponding blood glucose level. The strength of the current produced by the reaction
depends on the amount of glucose in the blood sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The device is a modification of a cleared AG-608N meter (k110017) to connect and
provide the User Interface with iOS iPhone and iPod using the same test strip and control
cleared with the AG-608N meter in k110017. Meter, strip and analytical module are
unchanged. The sponsor conducted necessary validation of the device, such as human
factors testing and bench testing (see Section P).

Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer,
webserver, or mobile device:
Yes __x__ or No ______
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile
device using wireless transmission?:
Yes __x____ or No ____
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this line of product types:
Yes ___x_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied
directly to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger and
other alternative sites (palm, forearm, upper-arm, calf and thigh). Since the whole
blood sample is applied directly to the test strip, there are no special handling or
storage issues.
5. Calibration:
Auto-coding: No calibration is required from the user, since all test strips have the
same one-code.
6. Quality Control:
No quality control (QC) tracking software is provided. The user is advised to
monitor QC material when testing is within labeled range. Three levels of
9 of 12

--- Page 10 ---
aqueous glucose control solutions are available with this system. Control solution
Level 2 is provided with the kit. Recommendations on when to test the control
materials are provided in the labeling. The control solution readings are not
included in the average of the patient results. An acceptable range for each
control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is cautioned not to use
the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Applicable temperature and humidity studies; sample volume study; Altitude study;
hematocrit study were established in k110017
1. A readability assessment was conducted by SMOG method on the instructions
for use, and they were found to be at 8th grade reading level or below.
2. Human Factors testing
A human factors study was conducted with 30 lay user participants, using 30
iPhones, 30 iPod Touch devices, 60 iHealth BG3 meters (30 will dock iPhone
and 30 will dock iPod Touch) and 3 lots of test strips. As part of the human
factors study, the 30 lay user participants used their own fingersticks to
evaluate data accuracy to the 30 iPhones, as described in section M.3.c. above.
The study participants had varied, but not advanced computer skills. The first
10 users used test strip lot 1, the second 10 users used test strip lot 2, and the
last 10 users used test strip lot 3. The users were given labeling in English
and instructed to set up and use the system as intended to be used. Results of
this study are described in section M.3.c above.
Lay user questionnaire: Lay users evaluated the ease of use of the device and
the presentation of the labeling. All users thought that the iHealth BG3 Smart
Gluco-Monitoring System was easy to use and most answered “easy” and
“very easy” to each question.
3. Bench testing performed for data from meter to iPhone or IPod device
Bench testing was performed to verify the transmission accuracy of electrical
signals between Apple's mobile operating system for iPhone and iPod
platforms (iOS) and glucose meter. This evaluation consisted of the following:
sending of data (output from the glucose meter) and receiving of data (input
10 of 12

--- Page 11 ---
into the iOS device). Data from the glucose meter and the receiving data on
iOS device, was in 100% agreement
4. Bench testing memory limits and rollover synchronization.
Testing was performed to evaluate that the iOS and device can save 10000
records and that the records can rollover properly in the iOS app. The criteria
for successful rollover of data were that when the memory is full, the new
record will replace the record that existed from the first record. The stated
acceptance criteria was met for this study
5. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing was performed/ passed. A
certificate verifying that EMC testing was performed and passed was provided.
6. The applicant provided software documentation and testing that supports the
device was developed and is under good software lifecycle processed.
7. Disinfection studies/Infection Control Studies: The devices are intended for
single-patient use (iHealth BG3 Smart Gluco-Monitoring System).
Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the
meters and lancing device by outside commercial testing demonstrating
complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant,
CaviWipes (EPA Registration #46781-8). Robustness studies were also
performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in
performance or external materials for each of the meters and lancing device
after 11,000 cleanings and 11,000 disinfection steps with the CaviWipes. The
robustness studies were designed to stimulate 5 years of single-patient use.
Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and
disinfection procedures.
The sponsor provides a disposable sleeve for the iPod or iPhone to be used with
each test strip, not to be reused and to be disposed of as bio-hazard, therefore
no disinfection studies were required of the iPod or iPhone.
8. Customer service is available Monday through Friday 8:30 am to 5:30 pm
Pacific Standard Time at the following toll-free number: 1-855-816-7705.
The labeling instructs patients to contact their healthcare provider at all other
times for help)
