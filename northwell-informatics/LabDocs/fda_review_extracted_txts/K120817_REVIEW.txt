L. Test Principle:
The principles of the QUANTA Flash β2GP1 and aCL IgA assays are similar to other solid
phase indirect immunosorbent assays. The assays are a chemiluminescent two-step
immunoassay consisting of magnetic particles coated with either human β2GP1 or bovine
cardiolipin and human purified ß2GP1, which capture, if present either the β2GP1 or the aCL
antiphospholipid antibodies from the sample.
The solid phase is paramagnetic beads and the detecting reagent is a mixture of isoluminol-
conjugated monoclonal antibodies to human IgA. A patient’s serum is diluted with sample
dilution buffer in a disposable cuvette. A small amount of this patient dilution is combined
with assay buffer and β2GP1 or aCL beads in a second cuvette, and mixed. This reaction
cuvette is incubated for 9½ minutes at 37°C. The cuvette is then exposed to a small magnet
that holds the beads in place, the liquid is aspirated, and the beads are resuspended as system
rinse is added to the cuvette and the magnet is removed. This wash cycle is repeated one
more time. During the third wash, no system rinse is added after the aspiration step, rather
the isoluminol conjugate (known as Tracer IgA) is added to the beads in the cuvette, and
mixed. Again, the cuvette is incubated for 9½ minutes at 37°C. Three wash steps, as
described in the first wash step above, are performed on the beads. In the fourth wash step,
no liquid is added to the beads after the aspiration.
The cuvette is then placed in a light-tight luminometer and the beads are exposed to a catalyst
and an oxidizing agent. These two reagents, or “Triggers”, cause the isoluminol to produce a
flash of visible light. The light produced from this reaction is measured as Relative Light
Units (RLU) by the BIO-FLASH optical system. The RLUs are proportional to the amount
of bound isoluminol conjugate, which in turn is proportional to the amount of IgA anti-
β2GP1 or anti-aCL antibodies bound to the β2GP1 or cardiolipin on the beads.
The QUANTA Flash β2GP1 and aCL IgA assay utilizes a 4 Parameter Logistic Curve
(4PLC) fit data reduction method to generate a Master Curve. The Master Curve is
predefined, lot dependent and it is uploaded to the instrument through the reagent cartridge
barcode. With the measurement of calibrators, the predefined Master Curve is transformed
to a new, instrument specific Working Curve. The concentration values of the calibrators are
included in the calibrator tube barcodes.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the QUANTA Flash™ β2GP1 and aCL IgA assays was assessed in
accordance with CLSI EP5-A2 document, by running 11-12 serum samples from
different parts of the claimed assay ranges in duplicate with two runs per day for at
least 20 days (some samples were run for 21 days) for a minimum of 80

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The QUANTA Flash™ β2GP1 and aCL IgA assay linearity studies were evaluated in
accordance with CLSI EP6-A Guideline. For each assay, 9 serum samples with
various β2GP1 IgA or aCL IgA concentrations were diluted by combining the
positive serum sample with the negative serum sample. The observed values were
graphed against the calculated values and linear regression was performed. The study
results are summarized in the tables below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
There is no international or certified reference material available for anti-β2 GP1 or
anti-aCL antibodies. The assay is calibrated in relative arbitrary units (CU or U/mL).
Value Assignment:
Control and calibrator materials are manufactured from human serum containing
high-titer IgA anti-β2 GP1 antibodies or IgA anti-aCL antibodies obtained from
commercially available sources.
The calibrators included in the QUANTA Flash β2 GP1 and QUANTA Flash aCL
IgA assays utilize a predefined lot-specific Master Curve that is stored in the reagent
pack barcode. The two calibrator values are assigned using in-house standards and a
four-parameter master curve. The assignment values of the two calibrators are used
to create a lot-specific four-parameter logistic curve, using two stored parameters
from the Master Curve and two lot-specific parameters based on the calibrator values.
The QUANTA Flash β2 GP1 IgA Controls and QUANTA Flash aCL IgA Controls
are also manufactured by diluting human serum containing high-titer IgA anti-β2 GP1
antibodies or IgA anti-aCL antibodies into buffer. A target CU value is achieved
through trial dilutions on a small scale. Once a dilution is selected, the control is
bulked, tested, and adjusted. Controls are tested on at least two instruments, on at
least two lots of reagent cartridge, in replicates of 10 to determine final value
assignment.
Stability:
Stability studies have been performed to support the following claims:
Reagent Pack Stability:
Shelf-life: The reagent pack can be stored, unopened, at 2-8°C for 1 year based on
accelerated stability testing (2 weeks at 37oC). Real time stability is ongoing.
Open/On-board/In-use Stability: Opened reagent packs must be stored on-board the
instrument. The working curve has been demonstrated to remain stable for 64 days.
Calibrators Stability:
Shelf-Life: Calibrators showed acceptable accelerated stability for 2 weeks at 37oC,
translating to at least 1 year of storage at 2-8oC. Real time stability is ongoing.
On-board Stability: On-board stability testing supported that the calibrators may be
stored open for up to 8 hours onboard the instrument.
Control Stability:
Shelf-Life: Controls showed acceptable accelerated stability for 2 weeks at 37oC,
translating to at least 1 year of storage at 2-8oC. Real time stability is ongoing.
10

--- Page 11 ---
On-board Stability: Open controls may be used up to 15 times, with a maximum of
10 minutes on-board the instrument per use. The total time the control tubes can be
used is 2.5 hours or 10 minutes per use.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB):
For the QUANTA Flash β2GP1 IgA and QUANTA Flash aCL IgA assays, the LoB
was determined according to EP17-A by running immunoglobulin stripped serum
diluted at the working dilution of 1:5 run twice in replicates of 30 to obtain 60
measurements.
For the QUANTA Flash β2GP1 IgA assay the LoB was determined to be 412 RLU
and for the QUANTA Flash aCL IgA assay the LoB was determined to be 561 RLU.
The LoB values for both assays are below the bottom limit of the 4 parameter logistic
curve that the instrument uses to calculate chemiluminescent units (CU), and
therefore cannot be converted into CU.
Limits of Detection (LoD):
For both devices, the LoD was determined using five serum samples that were
serially diluted until the RLU values no longer show a decreasing trend. The dilution
factor that gave a RLU value that is noticeably above that background noise was
chosen for each serum. A direct dilution using that dilution factor was made for each
serum so they were used as the low-level samples that are in between the LoB to
approximately 4 x LoB. These 5 samples were run in replicates of 4 for 4 days; 2
days on 1 instrument and 2 more days on another instrument to obtain 16
measurements per sample for a total 80 measurements. It was determined consistent
with CLSI EP17-A with proportions of false positives (alpha) less than 5% and false
negatives (beta) less than 5%. The LoD for each assay is below the lower limit of the
reportable range.
For the QUANTA Flash β2GP1 IgA assay the LoD was determined to be 522 RLU
and for the QUANTA Flash aCL IgA assay the LoB was determined to be 812 RLU.
The LoD values for both assays are below the bottom limit of the 4 parameter logistic
curve (CU)(4850 RLU and 4400 RLU for β2GP1 and aCL respectively)that the
instrument uses to calculate chemiluminescent units, and therefore cannot be
converted into CU. The LoD for each assay is below the lower limit of the reportable
range.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interfering Substances:
Four β2GP1 IgA and aCL IgA serum samples with different analyte concentrations
(negative, positive and two around cutoff) were mixed with known quantities of
hemoglobin (2, 1, 0.5 mg/mL), bilirubin (1, 0.5, 0.25 mg/mL), cholesterol (224, 112,
56 mg/dL) triglycerides (1000, 500, 250 mg/dL) or rheumatoid factor (about 500,
300, or 100 IU/mL) or buffer. The sera were run in triplicate. The average percent
recovery at each dilution is calculated.
11

--- Page 12 ---
No interference was observed up to the concentrations listed in the table below:
Potential Interferent Final Concentraton Tested
Hemoglobin 200 mg/dL
Bilirubin 100 mg/dL
Cholesterol 224 mg/dL
Triglycerides 1000 mg/dL
Rheumatoid Factor 500 IU/mL
A statement indicating that lipemic and/or grossly hemolyzed sera should not be used
is included in the direction insert.
Cross-Reactivity:
A study separate from the clinical sample population was used to determine cross
reactivity. Seventy-nine (79) patient samples with various antibodies to autoimmune
or infectious diseases were tested in the QUANTA Flash™ β2 GP1 and aCL IgA
assays. For infectious disease, samples tested included CMV (5), HCV (5), rubella
(5), toxoplasmosis (2), and HSV (5). For the other autoimmune disease states,
samples from patients with the following antibodies were tested: 10 rheumatoid factor
(RF), 9 anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP), 8 anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO), and
30 extractable nuclear antibodies (ENA). No cross-reactivity was observed
High dose hook effect:
To assess high dose hook effect, two high positive samples above the reportable
ranges were used neat or manually diluted 1:2, 1:4, 1:3 and 1:5 and assayed on both
the QUANTA Flash b2GP1 IgA assay and the QUANTA Flash aCL IgA assay
Since these samples ran above the top of the standard curve, standard protocol of the
machine is to report results as > 351.6 for aCL IgA and > 512 CU for b2GP1 IgA. A
formula was used to calculate higher values. Results for β2GP1 IgA, no hook effect
was demonstrated up to 823.4 and 1436.0 CU, respectively. Results for aCL IgA, no
hook effect was demonstrated up to 917.7 and 1033.0 CU, respectively.
f. Assay cut-off:
224 patient samples were tested on the QUANTA Flash β2GP1 IgA and QUANTA
Flash aCL IgA devices. The sample cohort consisted of 196 apparently normal
healthy blood donors and 28 HCV antibody positive samples. To establish the cutoff,
CLSI C28-A3C was followed along with recommendations of the International
Committee in Sydney that the cutoff between negative and positive for anti-
phospholipid antibodies should be >99% of a normal population. As a result, the cut-
off for both assays was set to 20.0 U/mL. A result below 20.0 U/mL is considered
negative, while 20.0 or greater is considered positive.

Samples for method comparison analysis included those samples from the clinical
validation study that were within the reportable range of the assays. For the first set
of tables for each analyte, only samples within the measuring ranges defined by the
lowest and highest calibrators of both the QUANTA Flash and predicate assays are
included in this method comparison. This comparison included 148 total patient
samples for the QUANTA Flash β2GP1 IgA and 99 samples for QUANTA Flash
aCL IgA. The predicate for the QUANTA Flash aCL IgA has an indeterminate zone
so data are also analyzed using the intermediate results as positive or negative.

b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study was performed for the QUANTA Flash β2GP1 IgA and
QUANTA Flash aCL IgA assays using 42 paired serum and sodium-citrate plasma
blood draws for β2GP1 IgA and 49 serum-plasma pairs for aCL IgA. Both sets of
samples were within the analytical measuring range of the assays with samples
ranging from 4 to 456 CU for β2GP1 IgA and for 1.7 to 329 CU for aCL IgA.
The resulting data support the package insert claim that serum and Na-citrated plasma
primary tube specimens are acceptable sample types for use with the QUANTA Flash
IgA assays. Results are summarized in table below:

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
The validation set consisted of sent of clinically characterized sera from Primary
APS, Secondary APS and non-APS diseased controls for a total of 632 patient
samples, none of which were used in the training set. The same validation set was
used on both IgA aCL and IgA β2GP1. The results of the QUANTA Flash b2GP1
IgA and QUANTA Flash aCL IgA devices in each disease category are shown below:
