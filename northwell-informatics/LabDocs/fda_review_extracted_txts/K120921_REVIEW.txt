L. Test Principle:
The Clever Choice Voice+ S, Clever Choice Voice+ M, Clever Choice+ S (non-voice
version), and Clever Choice+ M (non-voice version) glucose meters use glucose oxidase
enzyme chemistry as the standard dry reagent assay for glucose in whole blood. This
enzyme assay, with a redox chemical “mediator” reaction, is used to generate an
electrical current proportional to the glucose concentration in the blood sample. The
system is designed as an amperometric measurement device using current generated for
the redox reaction as the measureable response.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
This submission encompasses four meter models. Given that all four meter models are
identical with the exception of two meters including a voice function (Voice+ S and
Voice+M models), only one set of performance data is provided throughout the
submission.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run precision was measured by using heparinized venous whole blood
as the anti-coagulant at five different glucose concentrations. Each sample
was tested on 3 lots of test strips on 10 meters (two meters assigned to each
operator). Ten replicates were tested per meter, test strip lot, and glucose
concentration, (N=100 per test strip). Results are summarized below:

Medium (120 mg/dL) 100 123.9 4.0 3.20
High (320 mg/dL) 100 310.8 8.8 2.82
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Eleven venous (heparin) whole blood samples were drawn and spiked to
target analyte levels using glucose stock solutions to glucose concentrations
ranging from 20-600 mg/dL (20.1, 34.6, 91.4, 165, 220, 275, 359, 420, 501,
574, and 601mg/dL). All samples were also tested on a YSI analyzer to
generate the expected values The observed values were plotted against an
average of the expected values and an appropriate line fitted by standard linear
regression was generated of y=.9858x+5.1294 and an r2 = 0.9995.
The claimed measuring range for this device is 20 to 600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The sponsor claims that the system accuracy of the Clever Choice Voice+ S,
Clever Choice Voice+ M, Clever Choice+ S, and Clever Choice+ M blood
glucose monitoring systems are traceable to the YSI 2300 reference material.
The method comparison study was performed using the candidate device and
the YSI as the reference method.
Control Solutions and Test Strips identical to those cleared in k101307. As
such, please see k101307 for traceability, stability, and expected value
information.
d. Detection limit:

System accuracy study:
The system accuracy study was performed with 100 fresh capillary blood
samples collected from volunteers at two different hospitals and measured by
2 health care professionals on two different Clever Choice auto code voice +
meters and using 3 lots of test strips. An aliquot of each sample collected was
measured on a YSI reference method analyzer in order to evaluate the
accuracy of the candidate meters. To obtain blood glucose concentrations <50
mg/dL and > 400 mg/dL, samples were allowed to glycolyze or were spiked
to achieve the desired glucose concentrations. The range of samples tested
was 24.8 –542 mg/dL. System accuracy results are summarized below:

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Lay user performance study:
A user performance study was performed to compare lay user self test
fingerstick and AST (palm, forearm, upper arm, calf, and thigh) to the YSI
method. Visually impaired users were also evaluated in order to evaluate the
use of the speaking function. This study was conducted at two universities and
three university hospital centers, and using capillary blood samples collected
from 100 lay users (50 were visually impaired, ranging from moderately to
profoundly impaired as defined in the ICD-10 of the World Health
Organization Classification). The glucose sample ranges were from 59.7 –
385 mg/dL (according to YSI). The results of this study, linearity, and
method comparison support the claimed measuring range of 20 – 600 mg/dL.

Clever Choice+ M Blood Glucose Monitoring System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and requires a sample volume of 0.7 μL.
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer,
webserver, or mobile device?
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile
device using wireless transmission?
Yes __________ or No ____X___
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this line of product types:
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied
directly to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the
fingertip, palm, forearm, upper arm, calf, and thigh. The whole blood sample is
applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.
5. Calibration:
There is no calibration required for the Clever Choice meters by the user. The
meter is plasma-calibrated.
6. Quality Control:
There are 3 levels of glucose control solutions available separately. Level 2 is
provided with the start up kit. The meter has an algorithm to automatically
recognize the control solutions to prevent control results from being stored in the
15

--- Page 16 ---
internal memory as a patient result. Recommendations on when to test the control
materials are provided in the labeling. The control solution readings are not
included in the average of the patient results. An acceptable range for each control
level is printed on the control solutions vial label. The user is cautioned not to use
the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Altitude Study : To evaluate the effects of altitude on the Clever Choice meters,
20 whole blood venous samples were collected, using lithium heparin as the
anticoagulant, and then split into 3 environmental simulation chambers (N=80,
glucose range 72.3 - 342 mg/dL). One lot of test strips was used in the study and
each whole blood part was evaluated on four meters and compared to the YSI
2300 reference method. The environmental chambers were set to recreate three
different altitude levels: 3,280 feet (1000 meters), 6,560 feet (2000 meters), and
10,744 feet (3275 meters). Additionally, samples were evaluated at sea level.
Results obtained were analyzed as a percent bias compared to YSI. Based on the
data, the Clever Choice Voice+ S ,Clever Choice Voice+ M, Clever Choice+ S
(non-voice version), and Clever Choice+ M (non-voice version) glucose meters
can be used at altitudes up to 10,744 feet (3275 meters).
2. Hematocrit Study: The test strips and meter system for this submission are
identical to those cleared in k101307. Please see k101307 for information
regarding hematocrit effects on this test system.
3. Temperature and Relative Humidity Study: The sponsor performed temperature
and humidity studies using venous blood samples at target glucose concentrations
(70, 125, 310 mg/dL) to evaluate combined temperature and relative humidity
conditions (12.0ºC/25% RH, 23 ºC/ 25% RH, 38 ºC/25% RH, 12 ºC/80% RH, 12
ºC/ 60%RH, 38 ºC/80%RH). The results demonstrate that accurate readings can
obtained after exposure to temperatures ranging from 50 - 104ºF (10 - 40ºC) and
relative humidity conditions ranging from 25% – 80%.
4. EMC Electromagnetic Compatibility and Electrical Safety verification testing:
The sponsor provided the appropriate documentation certifying that
electromagnetic testing (EMS) had been performed and the Clever Choice meters
were found compliant (IEC 61326, IEC 61010).
5. Sample volume study: The sponsor performed a study to verify the test strip
sample volume requirement for the Clever Choice meters using blood samples at
seven glucose concentrations (44.5, 63.1, 117, 168, 249, 356 and 437 mg/dL).
Five sample volumes were evaluated in this study (0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 1.0 and 2.0 mL).
Results support the claimed sample volume of 0.7 mL.

6. Infection control: The device is intended for both single- and multiple-patient use.
Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the
meter and lancing device by an outside commercial testing demonstrating
complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant,
Cavi-Wipes with EPA registration #46781-8. The sponsor also demonstrated that
there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the meter and
lancing device (only for use with the single-patient use systems) after 11,000
cleaning and disinfection cycles designed to simulate 5 years of single-patient
device use and 3 years of multiple-patient device use.. Labeling was reviewed for
adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
7. Readability: The results from the SMOG formula readability assessment
demonstrated that the user’s manuals, test strip package insert, and control
solution package insert are at an 7.98 to 8.0 grade reading level.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
