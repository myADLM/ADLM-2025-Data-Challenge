I. Device Description:
Both TDM Multi-Constituent Calibrator and QMS TDM Multi-Constituent Calibrator
are identical calibrators and the only difference is the trade name. The calibrator set is
sold separately and may be used with any reagent lot. The calibrators in this set are
designed for use as a unit. Do not substitute or mix calibrators with those from other
lots.
Each TDM and QMS Multiconstituent Calibrator set is packaged in a rectangular
cardboard box with a 12-bottle divider, a product insert, and a value sheet. Kits are
stored refrigerated at 2-8°C. TDM Multiconstituent Calibrator set is prepared from a
bovine serum matrix and contains the following analytes (6 levels each): amikacin,
carbamazepine, digoxin, gentamicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, quinidine,
theophylline, valproic acid, and vancomycin. Sodium azide at 0.09% and ProClin
300 at 0.1% are present as preservatives. TDM Multiconstituent Calibrator levels are
provided in liquid ready to use form and can be stored at 2-8°C until the expiration
date on the label. Once opened, the opened bottles are stable for 60 days when
capped tightly and stored at 2-8°C.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None were referenced.
L. Test Principle:
Not applicable
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Both TDM Multi-Constituent Calibrator and QMS TDM Multi-Constituent
Calibrator are traceable to USP standards. The Primary Reference Standards
were prepared by gravimetric additions of the United States Pharmacopeia
(USP) grade drugs into a drug-free human serum pool. These materials were
aliquot in single-use cryo vials, and stored at -70°C.
Stability:
Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to
be acceptable. Stability characteristics of the TDM and QMS TDM Multi-
Constituent Calibrators were determined using accelerated (closed bottle)
stability studies, real time (closed bottle) stability studies and real-time opened
bottle stability studies. Based on the accelerated stress stability data, the shelf
life claim is set for 24 months at 5°C. Real-time stability studies demonstrated
a shelf life claim of 24 months at 2-8°C. Open bottle stability of 60 days was
demonstrated at the recommended storage temperature (2-8°C) and for 24
hours at 15-30°C. Open vial and closed vial expiration dates are located in the
package insert.
Value Assignment:
The values of the TDM Multi-Constituent Calibrators (TDM MCC) are
assigned by generating calibration curve using internal Primary Reference
Standards with their target values for each level of analyte. Assay controls
were used to verify that control recoveries are within the published ranges to
validate the calibration curve. Two lots of the TDM MCC were used and one
lot of control were used in the value assignment procedure. TDM MCC Level
1 values are assigned to zero, since no drugs are present. The TDM MCC and
the corresponding Primary Reference Standards were assayed on the Abbott
4

--- Page 5 ---
Architect c16000. TDM MCC values were determined by ratio calculations of
the assay recovery values of the TDM MCC and assay recovery values of the
Primary Reference Standards. Calibration curves are generated using the
TDM MCC with the new assigned values (shown in the table below).
