L. Test Principle:
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) catalyzes the reaction from L-alanine and alfa-ketoglutaric
acid to pyruvic acid and glutamic acid. When the produced pyruvic acid is converted into
lactic acid by lactate dehydrogenase (LD), NADH is converted into NAD with a decrease in
absorbance at 340 nm. The ALT activity can be determined by measuring the decreased rate
of NADH.
ALT
L-Alanine + Alfa-Ketoglutaric acid Pyruvic acid + Glutamic acid
LD
Pyruvic acid + NADH Lactic acid + NAD
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) catalyzes a reaction from L-aspartic acid and α-
ketogulutaric acid to oxaloacetic acid and glutamic acid. When the produced oxaloacetic
acid is converted into malic acid by malate dehydrogenase (MD), NADH is converted into
NAD with a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. The AST activity can be determined by
measuring the decreased rate of NADH.
AST
L-Aspartic acid + Alfa-Ketoglutaric acid Oxaloacetic acid + Glutamic acid
MD
Oxaloacetic acid + NADH Malic acid + NAD

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
20-day In-house Precision
The studies followed CLSI EP5-A2, where three levels of samples were each tested in
duplicate, twice a day, for 20 days, for a total of 80 results per level. The low and
intermediate level samples (level 1 and level 2) were commercial controls; the high
level (level 3) samples were archived (stored frozen at -20ºC) patient serum samples.
The results are as follows:
ALT Mean (U/L) Within-Run %CV Total %CV

Physician Office Precision Study at Sites 1, 2 and 3
Studies for precision were performed at three external POL-type sites to evaluate the
Hitachi Clinical Analyzer with S TEST ALT and AST reagent cartridges in one of its
targeted intended use environments, the physician’s office laboratory.
For the external site precision study, each site received three blinded serum samples
that were chosen to represent low, intermediate, and high concentrations of each
analyte. The samples at Sites 1 and 2 (Samples A, B, and C) were spiked serum
specimens where the neat sera were collected under IRB approvals and were
processed by routine procedures, frozen to -20ºC, and shipped frozen to each site.
The samples at Site 3 (Samples D, E, and F) were commercial controls targeted to
lower levels. Each sample was assayed six times per day for five days, reporting 30
results per level per analyte. Precision estimates for within-run precision and total
precision were as follows:
ALT, N = 30 replicates per sample per site

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The studies followed CLSI EP-6A. Nine to 10 serial dilutions per analyte assay
system were prepared using the commercially available linearity/calibration set. The
calibration samples were assigned their reference values arithmetically from the
labeled values and were tested in duplicate by the Hitachi Clinical Analyzer. The
mean Hitachi results (y-axis) were plotted against the assigned values (x-axis). The
ALT S TEST is linear between 6 and 400 U/L and the AST S Test is linear between 4
and 400 U/L.

AST 2.4 to 525.7 y = 1.0244x - 3.7708 4.0 to 400
R2 = 0.9998
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Each lot of S TEST cartridges (for both ALT and AST) is calibrated by the
manufacturer prior to shipment using material traceable to Japanese Enzyme
Reference Material (JCCLS CRM-001). The 2D code printed on each cartridge
provides the analyzer with lot-specific calibration data.
Cartridge Shelf-Life/Stability Study:
Real-time, shelf-life stability studies for the ALT and AST reagent cartridges were
performed. A two-level control set [37.8 U/L (normal) and 133.3 U/L (abnormal)]
was tested in replicates of five with three lots of cartridges for both ALT and AST

across six analyzers according to standard procedure. Testing was performed at Time
0 (baseline), and at approximately, 6, 11, 12 and 13 months; the storage condition was
refrigerated (2 to 8 ºC). The acceptance criterion at each time point was 90% to
110% recovery for each sample, using the label value of the controls as the target
value.
Based on the results, the shelf life for both the ALT and the AST reagent systems is
12 months, and stability at the 12 month time point met the specification in every
case.
d. Detection limit:
The studies followed CLSI EP17. For the LoB, the blank sample for each reagent
system was assayed 20 times per day for three days for a total of 60 replicate results.
The LoB was estimated as the mean of the 57th and 58th highest values for the true
blanks. For the LoD, five low samples were assayed four times per day for three
days, for a total of 60 replicate results. The LoD was calculated as the LoB + 1.645 x
(SD of the low sample). The ALT limit of detection (LoD) is 2.2 U/L, and the LOD
for AST is 1.4 U/L. For the estimation of LoQ, six samples ranging in concentration
between 5.0 and 9.9 U/L for ALT and between 3.8 to 8.8 U/L for AST were tested six
times a day for three days on three analyzers with one lot of respective reagent
cartridges (n=54). For ALT, the calculated means were 7.6, 7.9, 9.9, 5.0, 6.1 and 5.3
U/L with %CV ranging from 7.4 to 19.0%. Based on the results, the LoQ for the
ALT assay was estimated as 6.0 U/L. Similarly for AST, the calculated means were
8.8, 6.9, 8.6, 3.8, 5.9 and 5.6 U/L with %CV ranging from 5.9 to 20.4%. Based on
the results, the LoQ was estimated as 4.0 U/L.
Limits ALT AST
LoB 0.8 U/L 0.5 U/L
LoD 2.2 U/L 1.4 U/L
LoQ 6.0 U/L 4.0 U/L
The results of the LoQ studies support the sponsor’s claimed measuring range for
ALT between 6.0 to 400 U/L and for AST between 4.0 to 400 U/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
The studies followed CLSI EP7-A2. The study evaluated increasing concentrations
of potential endogenous interferents (ascorbic acid, unconjugated bilirubin,
triglyceride and hemoglobin) in the ALT and AST assays. Two levels of commercial
control sera at approximately 40 and 100 U/L ALT and AST concentrations were
spiked with six levels of interferents and tested in replicates of three. In each case,
the spiked sample result mean was compared to its neat control mean result, and
percent recoveries were calculated. The data demonstrated that the S TEST for ALT
and the S Test for AST were not affected by high levels of the following substances at
the levels noted below. The interference claim (no significant interference) for each

analyte is defined by the sponsor as the highest level of interferent that is within 10%
of the neat sample.
ALT
· Hemoglobin: no interference up to 250 mg/dL
· Unconjugated bilirubin: no interference up to 25 mg/dL
· Triglyceride: no interference up to 500 mg/dL
· Ascorbic acid: no interference up to 50 mg/dL
The sponsor has included the following statement in the ALT assay labeling:
“Use clear, unhemolyzed serum or plasma”
AST
· Hemoglobin: no interference up to 31 mg/dL
· Unconjugated bilirubin: no interference up to 50 mg/dL
· Triglyceride: no interference up to 500 mg/dL
· Ascorbic acid: no interference up to 50 mg/dL
Since hemoglobin showed significant interference for AST, the sponsor has included
the following statement in the AST assay labeling:
“Use clear, unhemolyzed serum or plasma; avoid even slight hemolysis”
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies evaluated approximately 100 serum samples.
For ALT, matched aliquots from 103 clinical specimens spanning the measuring
range were assayed in singleton by both the S Test ALT method and the Sekisui
method. The data were analyzed by linear regression (S Test ALT = y-axis), and the
results were as follows:
ALT (U/L)
N = 103 ; Less than 10% of the samples were altered samples (diluted)
sample range = 12 to 392 U/L
y= 1.0868x + 2.339
correlation coefficient (R2) = 0.9987
95% confidence interval of the slope = 1.08 to 1.09;
95% confidence interval of the y-intercept = 1.4 to 3.3
For AST, matched aliquots from 169 samples spanning the measuring range were
assayed in singleton by both the Hitachi Clinical Analyzer with S TEST AST assay
8

--- Page 9 ---
and the Roche/Hitachi cobas 6000 AST assay. The data were analyzed by linear
regression (S Test AST = y-axis), and the results were as follows:
AST (U/L)
N = 169; Less than 10% of the samples are altered samples (diluted or spiked)
sample range = 5 to 369 U/L
y= 1.0904x - 3.7481
correlation coefficient (R2) = 0.9943
95% confidence interval of the slope = 1.08 to 1.10;
95% confidence interval of the y-intercept = -4.8 to -2.7
Physician Office Accuracy Study at Sites 1, 2 and 3
Studies for field accuracy were performed at three external POL-type sites that were
used for the precision study, plus a central laboratory to determine the correlation
between the Hitachi Clinical Analyzer with the S TEST ALT and AST reagent
cartridges and their respective predicate devices when using matched serum aliquots.
For the external site method comparisons studies, each POL site received 50 (ALT) to
60 (AST) blinded serum samples that were chosen to represent as full a range of ALT
and AST levels as possible, and a central laboratory received a matched aliquot for
every serum sample. Each sample was assayed by the Hitachi system at the POL
sites, and an aliquot of each sample was assayed by a central laboratory using
appropriate predicate systems (the Sekisui method for ALT and the Roche/Hitachi
cobas 6000 AST assay). The results were analyzed by least squares linear regression
(Hitachi results = y-axis), and the performance characteristics were as follows:

b. Matrix comparison:
A study was performed to validate the use of sodium citrate, lithium heparin, and K3
EDTA plasma as alternatives to serum for the Hitachi Clinical Analyzer with S TEST
ALT and AST reagent cartridges. Approximately 30 to 40 matched serum/plasma

y-axis, serum = x-axis). Some low level samples (ALT study: Na Citrate Plasma, 5;
Heparinized Plasma, 2; EDTA Plasma, 3. AST study: Na Citrate Plasma, 1;
Heparinized Plasma, 1; EDTA Plasma, 0.), the results fell below their respective
dynamic ranges and were excluded from the statistical analysis. This resulted in an
uneven “N” in the study across the matrices. The performance characteristics were as
follows.
ALT (U/L) Sample Range (serum) = 6 to 392 U/L
Na Citrate Plasma N = 28 Heparinized Plasma N = 31 K3 EDTA Plasma N= 30
