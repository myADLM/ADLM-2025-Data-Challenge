I. Device Description:
The ALPHA Cryptococcal Antigen Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) is a direct
immunoenzymatic sandwich microplate assay which detects Cryptococcus antigens in
serum and CSF. Anti- Cryptococcus antibodies bound to microwell plates are used as
capture antibodies, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-Cryptococcus
antibodies are used as detection antibodies. The positive control and standard curve
material are composed of cryptococcal capsular polysaccharide antigen in a buffered
protein solution with a preservative.
Either serum or CSF is added to the microwells coated with the capture antibodies
and incubated. If the patient specimen contains cryptococcal antigens that are
recognized by the capture antibodies, those antigens will become bound to the
microwells. The microwells are washed to remove unbound patient material, and
HRP-conjugated detect antibody is added to the wells. If Cryptococcus antigens are
bound to the microwells by the capture antibodies, the detect antibody will also
become bound to the microwells. The wells are then washed to remove any unbound
detect antibody. Next, tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate is added to the
microwells, and in the presence of HRP, a blue color will develop. The reaction is
stopped by the addition of a stop solution. The optical density (OD) is determined
with a microplate reader at 450 nm with reference at 630 nm (reference is optional).

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The ALPHA Cryptococcal Antigen EIA was evaluated for reproducibility and
precision by spiking serum and mock CSF with cryptococcal antigen to
produce a panel consisting of a negative sample, a high negative (C5) sample,
a low positive sample and a moderate positive sample. This panel was tested
twice per day at three sites (Immuno-Mycologics, Inc., a national reference
lab, and a clinical lab) with a total of five operators over a five-day period in
order to determine both the inter-lab and the intra-lab reproducibility and
precision of the assay.
The percent coefficient of variation (CV) for the positive CSF specimens
ranged from 6.0% to 9.4% at the individual sites. The percent CV of the CSF
results averaged over all sites ranged from 21.1% to 23.3%. The percent
coefficient of variation for the positive serum specimens ranged from 7.7% to
13.6% at the individual sites. The percent CV of the serum results averaged
over all sites ranged from 13.05% to 14.16%.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range: Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls:
The Positive Control and Negative Control should be assayed with each batch
of patient specimens to provide quality assurance of the reagents. The
Positive and Negative controls are intended to monitor for substantial reagent
failure.
Reagent Acceptable Blanked
OD Parameters
Positive Control > 0.265
Negative Control < 0.090
If the blanked OD of the Positive Control is not within these parameters,
patient test results should be considered invalid and the assay should be
repeated.
High Dose Hook Effect:
The effects of high doses were determined by spiking a serum specimen pool
that was negative by the IMMY Latex-Cryptococcus Antigen Detection
System and ALPHA Cryptococcal Antigen EIA, with cryptococcal antigen at
1 mg/ml and testing it in triplicate at IMMY on one lot of ALPHA
Cryptococcal Antigen EIA, according to the package insert.
It was observed that at extremely high concentrations, the signal can be

reduced due to the high dose hook effect. Although the signal is reduced
leading to lower than expected EIA values, the result is still positive. The
semi-quantitative titration procedure can differentiate between a low EIA
score due to the high dose hook effect and a low EIA score due to low
concentrations of Cryptococcal Antigen.
Sample stability:
Three CrAg-Negative human CSF specimens and four CrAg-Negative human
serum specimens were spiked with concentrations of cryptococcal antigen
near and slightly above the cutoff of the assay. The specimens were tested on
the ALPHA CrAg EIA immediately after spiking and then they were frozen at
< -20 °C for the Day 0 time point. The specimens were then divided into
three aliquots and tested as follows:
• Aliquot 1 – Tested daily in triplicate, subjected to a freeze-thaw cycle
each day
• Aliquot 2 – Frozen for one week, thawed and tested in triplicate
• Aliquot 3 – Frozen for two weeks, thawed and tested in triplicate
A reduction in OD values was observed after multiple freeze-thaw cycles and
after storage at < -20 °C for one week. The OD value reductions were large
enough to cause some very low positive samples (near 0.300 Blanked OD) to
become negative when stored frozen for one week or subjected to more than
two freeze-thaw cycles. Specimens should be tested as soon as possible after
collection and multiple freeze-thaw cycles should be avoided.
d. Detection limit/ Analytical cut-off:
The limit of detection (LoD) was estimated at IMMY according to Clinical
and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) EP-17A. The limit of the blank
(LoB) was estimated by running 80 replicates of normal human serum and 80
replicates of artificial CSF. The initial LoD was estimated by running 20
replicates of 4 concentrations near the LoB in both serum and CSF.
The LoD was established by testing 20 replicates of both serum and CSF
spiked with Cryptococcal antigen at a range of concentrations near the initial
LoD. Results were considered positive if they yielded a blanked OD that was
greater than the cut-off.
Serum data:
Concentration % Positive
4.9 ng/mL 0% (0/24)
5.0 ng/mL 8% (2/24)

1.7 ng/mL 100% (24/24)
Analysis shows that the LoD for serum is 5.3 ng/ml and the LoD for CSF is
1.7 ng/ml.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity:
Analytical specificity for the ALPHA Cryptococcal Antigen EIA was
determined by running specimens from potentially cross-reacting medical
conditions unrelated to cryptococcosis. The following specimens were run on
one lot of the ALPHA Cryptococcal Antigen EIA. A total of 118 serum
specimen and 15 fungal culture filtrates were tested. Culture filtrates were
tested at three different dilutions: undiluted, 1:10, and 1:100. Dilutions were
made in 1X Specimen Diluent. Percent positive was determined for each
condition.

As expected, some fungal cross-reactivity was observed. One Aspergillus
galactomannan positive specimen (positive by Bio-Rad’s Platelia™
Aspergillus EIA) was positive in the ALPHA Cryptococcal Antigen EIA and
Paracoccidioides brasiliensis culture filtrates undiluted and 1:10 were
positive as well. The total percent positive for fungal pathologies was 3.9%,
well below the acceptance criteria of 10%. However, Paracoccidioides
brasiliensis culture filtrate had a total percent positive of 67%.
Rheumatoid factor is known to cause false-positive results in the Cryptococcal
latex agglutination method. Rheumatoid factor did not cause false positives in
the ALPHA Cryptococcal Antigen EIA between the range of 112 IU/ml and
6479 IU/ml. The normal reference range for rheumatoid factor is 0-14 IU/ml.
Interfering substances:
Interference testing was performed on five icteric, five hemolyzed, and five
lipemic serum specimens. Each specimen was spiked with cryptococcal
antigen at three times the C concentration. All specimens were then tested at
95
IMMY on one lot of the ALPHA Cryptococcal Antigen EIA in triplicate:
spiked and unspiked. Percent positivity was determined for each condition.
All of the unspiked specimens had negative results on the ALPHA
Cryptococcal Antigen EIA. All spiked specimens were positive, thus, these
types of serum specimens do not interfere with the ALPHA Cryptococcal
Antigen EIA.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cutoff was determined through Receiver Operator Curve (ROC)
analysis using the IMMY CrAg Lateral Flow Assay (LFA) as the means of
classifying a specimen as a true positive or negative. ROC Analysis was
performed on a dataset consisting of 995 combined serum and CSF specimens
ROC Analysis suggested a blanked OD cutoff value of greater than 0.265
which yielded a positive percent agreement of 97.4% and a negative percent
agreement of 99.9% when compared to the IMMY CrAg LFA. This cutoff

Supplemental studies:
A multi-site split-specimen comparison study was performed on both serum
and CSF specimens that had been submitted for cryptococcal antigen EIA
testing. A total of 1782 specimens (CSF n=426; serum n=1356) were tested
in both the ALPHA Cryptococcal Antigen EIA and the IMMY Cryptococcal
Antigen Lateral Flow Assay (LFA) according to their respective package
inserts. Analysis of this data yielded percent positive agreements of 96.9%
and 93.8% in serum and CSF, respectively. Analysis indicated percent
