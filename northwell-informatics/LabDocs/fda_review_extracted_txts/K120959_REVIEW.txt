1. Intended use(s):
The BioPlex® 2200 HSV-1 & HSV-2 IgG kit is a multiplex flow immunoassay
intended for the qualitative detection and differentiation of IgG antibodies to herpes
simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) in human
serum and EDTA or heparinized plasma. The test is indicated for sexually active

L. Test Principle:
The BioPlex 2200 HSV-1 & HSV-2 IgG kit is an automated system, it uses
the following procedure.
The kit contains two different populations of dyed beads are each coated with HSV 1
&2 gG1 and gG2 antigens. The BioPlex 2200 System combines an aliquot of
patient sample, sample diluent, and bead set reagent into a reaction vessel. The
mixture is incubated at 37°C. After a wash cycle, anti-human IgG antibody,
conjugated to phycoerythrin (PE), is added to the dyed beads and this mixture is
incubated at 37°C. The excess conjugate is removed in another wash cycle, and the
beads are resuspended in wash buffer. The bead mixture then passes through the
detector. The identity of the dyed beads is determined by the fluorescence of the
dyes, and the amount of antibody captured by the antigen is determined by the
fluorescence of the attached PE. Raw data is calculated in relative fluorescence
intensity (RFI).
Three additional dyed beads, an Internal Standard Bead (ISB), a Serum Verification
Bead (SVB) and a Reagent Blank Bead (RBB) are present in each reaction mixture to
verify detector response, the addition of serum to the reaction vessel and the absence
of significant non-specific binding in serum.
The instrument is calibrated using a set of four (4) distinct calibrator vials, supplied

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision panel, consisting of 8 serum panel members for each analyte, was prepared
by Bio-Rad Laboratories. For each analyte, 2 had high positive, 2 had low positive, 2 had
antibody levels near the cutoff, and 2 high negative panel members.
Precision testing was performed at Bio-Rad Laboratories on one lot of the modified
BioPlex 2200 HSV-1 & HSV-2 IgG kit. Each of the 8 panel members was tested in
duplicate on 2 runs per days for 5 days in a total of 20 results per panel member (2
replicates x 2 runs x 5 days = 20 replicates per panel member). The data were analyzed
for intra-assay and inter-assay precision in accordance to the CLSI EP5-A2 guideline.
The standard deviation (SD) and percent coefficient of variation (%CV) were calculated.
The results of the precision testing and comparison between the modified device and the
cleared device are shown below. The results demonstrate that the performance of the
modified device is substantially equivalent to the cleared device. For the precision and
reproducibility information of the BioPlex 2200 HSV-1 & HSV-2 IgG kit please refer to

samples were evaluated in replicates of ten using the modified BioPlex 2200 HSV-1 &
HSV-2 IgG Kits. The results demonstrated equivalence with the original (predicate)
device. The percent change in signal ranged from -5.0 to 10.0% and -9.1% to 9.5% for
the predicate and modified HSV-1 IgG assays respectively and -4.0 to 8.0% and -4.0% to

performance was also evaluated using the CDC HSV reference serum sample panel
(N=80). The results of this analysis are presented below and the conclusion of the
assessment is that the performance of the device remains unchanged. For the sensitivity
and specificity of the BioPlex HSV-1 & HSV-2 IgG kit versus the reference method
please refer to the K090409 package insert.

Agreement with CDC Panel
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the test results of CDC HSV-1 and HSV-2
IgG Panel between the current marketed device (Predicate, K090409) and the modified
device are equivalent for the BioPlex 2200 HSV-1 & HSV-2 IgG assay. Testing was
conducted internally at Bio-Rad Laboratories. The testing was performed using the masked,
well characterized HSV serum panel from the CDC. The panel consists of 24% HSV-1 and
HSV-2 dual-positive samples, 50% HSV-1 positive and 50% HSV-1 negative samples and
48% HSV-2 positive and 52% HSV-2 negative samples. The results are presented to
convey further information on the performance of the test kit and do not imply
endorsement of the assay by the CDC. Results are shown below.

b. Matrix comparison:
Matched serum and plasma (EDTA and heparin sodium) samples drawn from the same
donor were acquired from commercial sources. For each assay in the panel more than 40
samples were collected within the measurement range of the assay. Samples were
assayed in replicates of two using the modified BioPlex 2200 HSV-1 & HSV-2 IgG kits.
Plasma AI values were compared to matched serum AI values. The regression correlation
parameters for the slopes, intercepts, and correlation coefficient (r) are shown below.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The observed prevalence and expected values for the modified BioPlex 2200 HSV-1 &
HSV-2 IgG kit are presented in the tables below by age and gender for serum samples
from sexually active individuals where an HSV-1 (N=200) and HSV-2 (N=200) tests
were ordered. The testing was performed internally at the manufacturing site and the
results of the modified device were equivalent to those of the original cleared device. For
the BioPlex 2200 HSV-1 & HSV-2 IgG kit cleared expected values and positive and
negative predictive values for the intended use populations please refer to the decision
summary of K090409.
