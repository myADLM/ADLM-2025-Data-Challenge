The directCHECK® ACT+ Level 1 and Level 2 are whole blood assayed quality
controls reagents that are lyophilized whole blood preparations made from animal
plasma fixed with animal red blood cells for one time single use. The whole blood
preparations are lyophilized into 1 mL individual glass ampoules with an internal
separate liquid diluent. When the glass ampoule is broken, the diluent rehydrates the
lyophilized material, forming a liquid whole blood control.
The directCHECK® ACT-LR Level 1 and Level 2 are whole blood assayed quality
controls that are lyophilized whole blood preparations made from animal plasma fixed
with animal red blood cells for a one time single use. The whole blood preparations are
lyophilized into individual 1 mL glass ampoules with an internal separate liquid diluent.
When the glass ampoule is broken, the diluent rehydrates the lyophilized material,
forming a liquid whole blood control.

L. Test Principle:
The directCheck® Whole Blood Quality Controls are dried whole blood preparations
which have been assayed and are intended to be used to perform quality control on the
ACT+ and ACT-LR test cuvettes on both the HEMOCHRON® Jr. Signature+ and
HEMOCHRON® Signature Elite analyzers. The analyzers utilize the end point clot
detection with the addition of an activator (celite) to initiate the intrinsic pathway. Once a
clot end-point is detected, the clotting time is displayed.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-site repeatability was determined for 3 lots of each control level
for the ACT+ and ACT-LR controls. For each lot of control 20 replicates
were tested in duplicate on each instrument (HEMOCHRON® Jr.
Signature+ and HEMOCHRON® Signature Elite analyzers) for one day. The
%CV for each lot/instrumentation combination meets the pre-specified
acceptance criteria of CV<14.0%.
Please see the table below for a summary of results.
Controls n mean Within-run Within-run
SD %CV
ACT-LR Level 1 120 128 13.2 9.2%
ACT-LR Level 2 120 239 23.1 9.7%
ACT+ Level 1 120 154 11.0 7.1%
ACT+ Level 2 120 402 7.7 1.9%
Reproducibility was assessed in two reproducibility studies (inclusive of a
revised study) conducted on three lots of controls according to CLSI EP5-A2
guidelines.
Testing was performed twice daily in duplicate over 20 consecutive days
using two separate instruments at three sites with 2-3 operators per site.
The initial reproducibility study used only one lot of control, and the
revised study incorporated two additional control lots. Pooled data from
the combined studies tested on the HEMOCHRON® Jr. Signature+ and
HEMOCHRON® Signature Elite was assessed. The %CV and SD for
within-run, between-run, between-lot, between-site, between site and total
precision was determined for ACT+ and ACT-LR. Results met the pre-
determined overall acceptance criteria of %CV≤ 12.0 for ACT+ and %CV
≤14.0% for ACT-LR as summarized in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Value Assignment:
A revised value assignment study was conducted based on FDA
recommendations. Value assignment was performed by 3 operators with each
operator running 12 tests (3 test cuvette lots over 4 instruments). Studies were
performed in three runs using a different reagent cuvette lot for both ACT+ and
ACT-LR. Results of each run must meet a ≤5% error rate to be considered
passing. A failed run is tested no more than twice under the same conditions. If
the lot run fails after 2 additional runs, the lot is rejected and deleted from
production. Each run must meet a pre-defined target range based on a 98%
confidence level during validation of the product and aligned with literature based
therapeutic ranges for ACT. Target ranges are as follows:
Assay Mean Target Range
ACT+ Level 1 135-180
ACT+ Level 2 347-500
ACT-LR Level 1 103-157
ACT-LR Level 2 190-312
The mean, SD and %CV is calculated for each passing lot. A standard factor
(Total SD from the extended precision study) is used to account for inherent
variability of the controls and for calculation of the reference range of each
passing lot using the following formula:
Mean clotting time of lot ±2SD x total SD from the precision study
Stability:
Two real time shelf life studies were conducted. The initial real time stability
study demonstrated stability performance of ACT+ Level 1 and 2 controls,

and a revised study was conducted for the ACT-LR Level 1 and 2 controls.
Real time shelf life stability studies are currently ongoing for ACT-LR. The
shelf life stability claim is based on real time stability data available at time of
clearance for ACT-LR controls. For each level of controls, 3 lots of control
material were stored at 2-8°C and tested 30 times at time zero and 10 times at
multiple intermediate time points. The calculated mean, SD, %CV of each
time point is compared against the baseline with acceptance criteria of ±20%
maximum allowed deviation from the baseline.
Real time room temperature claim- one lot of each control level was tested
15 times at each time point: 0, 2, 3, 4 and 5 weeks. The baseline result and
measurement at each time point must be within the pre-determined lot
reference range for each lot tested in which the difference between the
baseline and designated time points are <20% maximum allowed deviation
from the baseline.
All results met the predetermined acceptance criteria of ACT+ <12% and
ACT-LR<14%. The data therefore support the following shelf life stability at
refrigerated storage between 2°C and 8°C and room temperature:
Control Material Shelf-life Room temperature
ACT+ Level 1 18 months 4 weeks
ACT+ Level 2 18 months 4 weeks
ACT-LR Level 1 5 months 4 weeks
