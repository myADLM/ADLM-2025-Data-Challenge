L. Test Principle:
In the Focus Diagnostics’ STRATIFY JCV DxSelect™ test, JC virus-like particles (VLP)
®
are pre-coated onto 96-well microtiter plates. Diluted serum or plasma specimens and controls
are incubated in the wells to allow JCV-specific antibodies present in the specimens to react
with the JC VLP antigen. Nonspecific reactants are removed by washing. Peroxidase-
conjugated anti-human antibodies are added to react with JCV-specific antibodies. Excess
conjugate is removed by washing. Enzyme substrate and chromogen are added, and the color
is allowed to develop. After adding the Stop Reagent, the resultant color change is quantified
by a spectrophotometric reading of optical density (OD). Specimen OD readings are
compared with Cut-Off Calibrator OD readings to determine results. Each specimen result is
reported as an index value. A specimen with an index value that is greater than a specified
upper cut-off is reported as positive for detectable JCV-specific antibodies, whereas a
specimen with an index value less than the specified lower cut-off is reported as negative for
detectable JCV-specific antibodies. A specimen with an index value that is equal to or
between the upper and lower cut-off values is reported as indeterminate. An indeterminate
result requires further evaluation in the confirmation (inhibition) assay.
In the confirmation assay, soluble JC VLP antigen will compete with plate bound JC VLP
antigen for the JCV-specific antibodies present in the serum or plasma specimens. After
washing away the unbound antibodies, peroxidase-conjugated anti-human antibodies are
added and bind to any captured JCV-specific antibodies. Excess conjugate is removed by
washing. Enzyme substrate and chromagen are added, and the color is allowed to develop.
After adding the Stop Reagent, the resultant color change is quantified by a
spectrophotometric reading of OD. The percent inhibition is calculated to confirm presence of
JCV-specific antibodies in the specimen. Specimens with a percent inhibition value that is
greater than the specified cut-off are reported as positive for detectable JCV-specific
antibodies, whereas specimens with percent inhibition values less than or equal to the cut-off
are reported as negative for detectable JCV-specific antibodies.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility
The reproducibility of the assay was assessed using a sample panel consisting of
four levels of sera, four levels of (EDTA) plasma samples, low and high positive
controls. Three replicates of each panel member were tested on two runs a day for
a total of five days at two external testing sites and one internal site. The four
levels included a negative, low, indeterminate and moderate positive samples
prepared in a serum and a plasma matrices. The indeterminate samples were tested
simultaneously in the confirmation assay and the detection assay.

Reproducibility around the Assay cut-off
In order to demonstrate precision near the assay cut-off, two contrived samples, one
serum and one (EDTA) plasma samples were prepared to be near the lower cut-point
of the assay. Each sample was diluted twenty times and tested in the detection assay
and the confirmation assay. As depicted in the following table the %CV was ≤ 2.6%.

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross Reactivity
Cross reactivity was evaluated in a three part study conducted at an internal testing
site.
I. The first study evaluated cross reactivity with commercially available human
antibodies spiked into JCV negative serum and plasma as determined by the
STRATIFY JCV DxSelect™ assay. The potentially cross reacting antibodies
®
were spiked in at concentrations estimated to be approximately 2-4 times higher
than the estimated detection limit of JCV antibody. Each antibody tested was not
detected with the STRATIFY JCV DxSelect™ assay. There was no observed
®
reactivity with the three potentially cross-reacting antibodies tested in this part of
the study and the results are presented in the table below.
Table: Cross Reactivity - Part One – Spiked Antibodies
Agents Detected
Cross Reactant Concentration Serum Plasma
Antibody to Escherichia coli 0.4 µg/mL 0/3 0/3
Antibody to Mycobacterium tuberculosis 0.4 µg/mL 0/3 0/3
Antibody to Pneumocystis jiroveci Unquantified 0/3 0/3
II. The second part of the study included a panel consisting of a least twenty left
over specimens that previously tested positive for each of the potential cross
reacting antibodies. Each member of the panel was evaluated using the
STRATIFY JCV DxSelect™ assay along with appropriate controls. The
®
seroprevalence of JCV in the panel was compared to the expected seroprevalence
of JCV in the normal population. If a group demonstrates a higher than expected
seroprevalence of JCV (set as >70% for the purposes of this study) it may be an
indicator of potential cross reactivity. Four groups of patients (C. pneumoniae,
HIV, CMV and HSV 1) exhibited a positivity rate that was slightly above that
observed in previously reported studies. The results suggest that these groups
demonstrate potential cross reactivity.

III. The third part of the cross reactivity evaluation consisted of an evaluation of the
potential cross reactivity with other polyoma viruses. This included a cross absorption
study using BK virus like particles (VLP). A total of 40 clinical specimens that have
previously tested positive for JCV antibodies in the STRATIFY JCV DxSelect™ assay
®
were tested in a confirmation style assay using JC VLP and BK VLP. A control set
consisted of samples spiked with JC VLP at the same concentration of VLP that is used
in the confirmation assay. The test samples were with spiked with BK VLP at the same
concentration. The tests samples would be considered to be cross reactive if the %
change in signal between the unspiked sample and the sample spiked with BK VLP is >
45%. The control set demonstrated % change in OD that was consistent with
expectations. The test samples demonstrated % change in OD values due to BK VLP that
ranged from -15 to 27%. No samples exhibited >45% change in the OD signal when
spiked with BK VLP, indicating that the assay does not cross react with BKV.
The potential cross reactivity with other human polyoma viruses was not evaluated.
However, additional analysis of the structure of the VP1 protein of other polyoma viruses
indicates that BKV and JCV are more closely related (79.4% similarity) than other
polyoma virus such as Merkel Cell virus and WU virus and KI virus (30.8 to 50.8 %
similarity). Due to the differences in viral structure a similar experiment with other
polyoma virus VLP was not conducted.
Interferences
Potential interference due to endogenous substances was evaluated using a testing
panel consisting of sera and plasma samples that exhibit JCV antibody values close to
the assay cut-off. The samples are spiked with the potential interferent as compared to
baseline of the same serum and plasma samples that did not contain the interferent.

The interferents were spiked at the highest possible endogenous level. For all of the
potential interferents with the exception of γ globulin; the observed differences in
signal did not cause any changes in interpretation of the final result. A potentially
interference is suspected if the % change from the baseline sample is > 20%.
Commercially available γ globulin is produced using normal human serum containing
IgG antibodies, due to the high seroprevalence of antibodies to JCV virus in the
normal population this may explain the observed cross reactivity.

f. Assay cut-off:
To characterize antibody responses against infectious agents in humans, it is
critical to have reference sera from both infected and non-infected individuals.
However, JCV infection is clinically asymptomatic, thereby making it difficult to
generally distinguish JCV infected from non-infected individuals. Even though
about 20-30% of JCV infected individuals shed viral DNA in the urine, JCV DNA
is often not detected in the blood or urine of infected individuals, even when the
infection results in the development of PML. There is no evidence that testing for
JCV DNA in blood or urine can identify all JCV infected individuals, however,
those who shed virus in the urine are confirmed to be infected with JCV.
Therefore, sera from viruric patients were used to establish the positive reference
sera for the assay. The assay cut point was established from the distribution of the
serological responses of samples collected from JCV viruric patients in the
STRATIFY JCV DxSelect™ assay. The lower cut point for the detection assay
®
was set at an index of 0.2 along with an upper cut point at 0.4, and inhibition cut
point of the confirmation assay was set at 45%. The assay has an estimated false
negative rate of 2.2% based on a negative JCV antibody results for 4 out of 184
serum samples collected from viruric patients in the STRATIFY-1 trial.

b. Matrix comparison:
A panel of 109 paired sera and (EDTA) plasma samples were evaluated in the
STRATIFY JCV DxSelect™ assay. Of the total 109 pairs one pair was
®
eliminated from the regression analysis because the result of the sera sample was
invalid, of the remaining 108 pairs 7 pairs were qualitatively detected with OD
values that exceeded the range of the spectrophotometer. These pairs of samples
are included in the qualitative result comparison below, but eliminated from the
regression analysis since an index value could not be calculated. Passing-Bablok
regression analysis of the pairs of sera and plasma specimens demonstrates a slope
of 1 with a 95% CI of (0.9928 to 1.0167)) and an intercept of 0 with a 95% CI of
(-0.0068 to 0.0016). Analysis of the qualitative results yielded Positive Percent

There is an increased risk of PML in natalizumab treated multiple sclerosis (MS)
and Crohn’s disease (CD) patients. Three risk factors for PML have been
identified in MS and CD patient populations undergoing natalizumab treatment:
natalizumab treatment duration, prior immunosuppressant use, and the presence of
antibodies to JCV. Utilizing these three risk factors, sub-groups of patients can be
identified with both higher and lower risk for PML. Please consult the current,
locally available, prescribing or supplemental physician information for
natalizumab for detailed information on the known risks associated with JCV
serological status and the development of PML in natalizumab-treated patients.
Patients with all three known risk factors have the highest risk for the development
11

--- Page 12 ---
of PML. The risk stratification for PML in natalizumab treated patients who are
positive for the presence of JCV antibodies is shown in the following table.
Table: Estimated Incidence of PML Stratified by Risk Factor

1-24 months <1/1,000 2/1,000
25-48 months 4/1,000 11/1,000
Notes: Based on postmarketing PML data and Natalizumab use data as of September 1, 2011.
†Data beyond 4 years of treatment are limited.
*Risk in anti-JCV antibody positive patients was estimated based on the assumptions that
18% of Natalizumab-treated MS patients have a history of prior immunosuppressant
treatment and that 55% of Natalizumab-treated MS patients are anti-JCV antibody positive.
Clinical Performance (Comparative Agreement)
Because PML is an infrequent event in natalizumab-treated patients, data collected from both
clinical trial and post-marketing reports of confirmed cases of PML were used to assess the
clinical performance of the STRATIFY JCV DxSelect™ assay for PML risk stratification. A
®
clinical plan was developed for collection of serum samples obtained from natalizumab-
treated patients prior to the onset of PML for JCV antibody testing. A total of 31 available
serum samples from confirmed PML patients collected at least 6 months prior to clinical
diagnosis of PML were tested for JCV antibody status using the STRATIFY JCV
®
DxSelect™ assay. In addition to the pre-PML samples, 1330 Samples from MS patients were
tested by the STRATIFY JCV DxSelect™ assay. A total of 707 patients receiving treatment
®
tested positive for antibodies to JCV using the test, and the positivity rate was estimated to be
58.7% (414/707) with a 95% CI of 54.9% to 62.1%. An assay is statistically informative if the
percentage of positive results in patients with the disease of interest is higher than the
percentage of positive results in the population at risk. The 100% JCV antibody positivity
demonstrated in the 31 natalizumab-treated PML patients prior to PML diagnosis was
significantly different than the 58.7% JCV antibody positivity in the MS population, and
represents an approximately 2-fold increased risk of PML compared to the PML incidence in
the overall natalizumab-treated population.
In prior clinical studies for natalizumab the risk of developing PML was estimated using
statistical modeling. The relative risk for patients who have received natalizumab for at least
18 months is shown in the table below. Risk was calculated based on statistical modeling with
an assumption that there is one hypothetical PML case with a negative test result (38 PML
cases: 37 positive and 1 hypothetical negative) and an assumption that the study has 13,227
patients.

*For the negative result, a hypothetical case was assumed in order to allow for calculation of
the point estimate.
The studies demonstrated that the positivity rate for JCV antibodies is not dependant upon
prior IS use or the duration of natalizumab treatment. The results of the STRATIFY JCV
®
DxSelect™ assay can be used along with other established PML risk factors, of prior IS use
and natalizumab treatment duration, to stratify an individuals risk for PML, please refer to
Table 1 and to the prescribing information for additional risk estimates.
Performance with pre-PML samples.
The STRATIFY JCV DxSelect™ assay was compared to an FDA cleared assay
®
(STRATIFY JCV™ Antibody ELISA) using serum samples obtained from PML patients at
least 6 months prior to PML diagnosis. Because PML is an infrequent event in natalizumab-
treated patients, data collected from both clinical trial and post-marketing reports of
confirmed cases of PML were used to assess the clinical performance of the STRATIFY
JCV DxSelect™ assay for PML risk stratification. Thirty-one available serum samples from
®
confirmed PML patients collected at least 6 months prior to clinical diagnosis of PML were
tested at one internal testing site for JCV antibody status using the STRATIFY JCV
®
DxSelect™ assay and the validated laboratory methodology. The sample set demonstrated
100% (31/31) positive agreement (95% CI: 89.0% to 100%) with the validated assay.
Performance with archived clinical specimens
Two groups of prospectively collected and archived clinical samples obtained from the
STRATIFY-2 and the AFFIRM clinical studies were used to assess the performance of the
STRATIFY JCV DxSelect™ assay compared to the validated laboratory methodology used
®
in the STRATIFY-2 and AFFIRM clinical studies. One group consisted of patients who were
receiving natalizumab, the other group of patients had not received natalizumab therapy (and
were considering receiving natalizumab). The samples were blinded and randomly distributed
to two external testing sites and one internal testing site. The data was analyzed for each
group separately. Results for the two individual groups are presented in the tables below. The
Positive and Negative Percent Agreement are shown in the table below.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The STRATIFY JCV DxSelect™ assay been used to evaluate JCV antibody
®
positivity rate in serum and plasma samples from a geographically diverse cohort of
1330 MS patients. The cohort was comprised from MS patients from clinical trials
including a completed Phase 3 clinical study of natalizumab in MS patients (AFFIRM
C-1801), an ongoing study to evaluate seroprevalence in the MS population
(STRATIFY-2 [101JC402). The clinical characteristics for the MS patients within
each study are shown in the following table. The age and gender distribution of the
MS cohort tested with the STRATIFY JCV DxSelect™ are similar to the age and
®
gender distribution of MS patients treated with natalizumab in the post-marketing
setting. JCV antibody positivity rate in the MS cohort was 55-59%. JCV antibody
positivity rate was shown to increase with age and was lower in women compared to
men, consistent with what has been reported in the literature in healthy adults using
similar assay methodologies.
Seroprevalence data was evaluated for each study. The observed seroprevalence using
the STRATIFY JCV DxSelect™ assay was 59% (467/792) in the STRATIFY-2
®
study and 55% (296/538) in the AFFIRM Study. These seroprevalence values are
consistent with the seroprevalence values observed during the clinical studies, when
the relationship between JCV serological status and PML development were
described. Additionally the STRATIFY JCV® DxSelect™ assay demonstrated 100%
concordance with 31 pre-PML samples.
