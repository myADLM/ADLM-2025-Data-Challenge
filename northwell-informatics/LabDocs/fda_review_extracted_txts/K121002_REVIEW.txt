H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Etest® is a quantitative technique for determining the antimicrobial susceptibility
testing of Gram-negative and Gram positive aerobic bacteria such as
Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus and Enterococcus species and
fastidious bacteria, such as anaerobes, N. gonorrhoeae, S. pneumoniae,
Streptococcus and Haemophilus species. The system comprises a predefined
antibiotic gradient which is used to determine the Minimum Inhibitory
Concentration (MIC), in µg/mL, of different antimicrobial agents against
microorganisms as tested on agar media using overnight incubation.
This submission is for the addition of the antimicrobial ceftaroline at
concentrations of 0.002 – 32 µg/mL to the Etest® product. Ceftaroline has been
shown to be active in vitro against most strains of the microorganism listed below,
as described in the FDA-approved label for this antimicrobial agent.
Active in vitro and in clinical infections
Skin Infections
Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates)

4. Special instrument requirements:
Manual readings only
I. Device Description:
Etest® consists of a thin, inert and non-porous plastic strip, 5mm wide and 60 mm
long. One side of the strip carries a two-letter code designating the identity of the
antibiotic and is calibrated with MIC values in terms of µg/mL. A predefined
exponential gradient of the dried and stabilized antibiotic covers a continuous
concentration range across 15 two-fold dilutions of a conventional MIC method.
Staphylococcus aureus (skin isolates only) S= < 1 µg/mL*
* The current absence of resistant isolates precludes defining any results other than
“Susceptible.” Isolates yielding MIC results other than “Susceptible” should be
submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
“Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
(AST) Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA”;
CLSI M7-A8 “Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria
That Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard, January 2009”
CLSI M100-S21“Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing:
Twentieth Informational Supplement, January 2011”
L. Test Principle:
The Etest® gradient technology is based on a combination of the concepts of dilution
and diffusion test methods for susceptibility testing. Etest® directly quantifies
antimicrobial susceptibility in terms of discrete MIC values. When the Etest® strip is
applied to an inoculated agar plate, the antibiotic is immediately released from the
plastic surface into the agar. A predefined, continuous gradient of antibiotic
concentrations is created and maintained directly underneath the strip. After
incubation whereby bacterial growth becomes visible, a symmetrical inhibition ellipse
centered along the strip will be seen. The MIC value in µg/mL is read where the
ellipse edge intersects the strip. Since Etest® generates MIC values which fall
between two-fold dilutions for interpretation; the MIC value read must be recorded to
the next two-fold dilution.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Twenty-five Staphylococcus aureus were tested at three external sites to
determine site to site reproducibility demonstrating ≥95% reproducibility.
Results were within +/- one doubling dilution agreement as compare to the
mode for all sites and there were no off-scale results.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended QC isolates were tested a sufficient number of times with
acceptable results with the reference method. The Etest® results demonstrate
that the system can produce QC results in the recommended range.

A 0.5 McFarland was used to determine the correct inoculum. Colony counts
were performed periodically at each site to demonstrate that the inoculum
procedure results were in the expected CFU/mL.

Clinical testing was performed at three external sites; there were 355 S. aureus, of
which 172 were stock (48.5%), and a challenge set of 79 S. aureus isolates.
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The CLSI recommended broth dilution reference panel was prepared
according to the CLSI recommendation. Etest was set up following Table 1
(Recommended Media, Inoculum and Incubation) of the Generic Package
Insert.
All isolates grew in the clinical studies.
The clinical testing included both fresh clinical isolates and stock isolates
along with a challenge set with known results. A comparison was provided to
the reference method with the following agreement. The ceftaroline range for
S. aureus in the studies were at 0.125 - 2 µg/mL in this submission.
