H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The PLEX-ID Flu assay is a qualitative nucleic acid in vitro diagnostic test
intended for the detection and differentiation of influenza A H1N1 (2009),
influenza A H1N1 (seasonal), influenza A H3N2 (seasonal) and influenza B viral
nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal swab specimens from patients symptomatic for
respiratory tract infection. The PLEX-ID Flu assay is intended for use on the
PLEX-ID System (version 1.2) as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza infection in
conjunction with clinical and epidemiological information. This assay is not
intended to detect influenza C virus.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used
as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient management decisions.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical
and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities,
specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for
novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health departments for
testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+
facility is available to receive and culture specimens.

I. Device Description:
The PLEX-ID Flu Assay provides identification of influenza A subtypes and detection of
B viruses. It differentiates the 2009 H1N1 influenza A from seasonal human influenza
A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 subtypes. The PLEX-ID Flu assay is a qualitative in vitro
diagnostic test used for the detection and identification directly from nasopharyngeal

(NP) swab specimens. First, nucleic acids are extracted from the NP specimens collected
from patient with signs and symptoms of influenza infection using the PLEX-ID SP.
Nucleic acids are then amplified through a reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) on the PLEX-ID TC. The RT-PCR products are then desalted and
analyzed in a mass spectrometer to determine the base composition of the amplicons.
Analysis of base compositions of PCR amplicons from influenza core gene segments
(PB1, PB2, PA, M, NS1, NP) are used to provide subspecies identification via
comparison to an influenza virus database of expected amplicons. Desalting, mass
spectrometry and data analysis are conducted on the PLEX-ID Analyzer (version 1.2).
Reported results include an identification of detected influenza A virus subtypes
(seasonal H1, 2009 H1N1, and seasonal H3) and detection of influenza B virus.

L. Test Principle:
The PLEX-ID Flu assay is a test for the detection of influenza virus nucleic acid
extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs from symptomatic patients. PLEX-ID Viral RNA
Isolation reagents are used to adsorb, wash, and elute nucleic acids on a PLEX-ID
SP
resulting in purity sufficient for a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-
PCR). The PLEX-ID loads eluted nucleic acid from each sample and assay reagents
FH
(reverse transcriptase, DNA-binding protein, and DNA polymerase) into an assay plate
containing broad-range primers targeting influenza A and B viruses. RT-PCR
amplification is performed on the PLEX-ID .
TC
After the amplification step, the PCR plate is loaded onto the PLEX-ID Analyzer for
PCR product desalting via weak anion exchange with microparticles. After desalting, the
PLEX-ID Analyzer uses electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) to measure
the masses of the desalted PCR products. PCR products are composed of the four DNA
building blocks, adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). The atomic
composition and thus, the molecular mass, of each nucleotide is known. The PLEX-ID
Analyzer calculates the base composition, the number of As, Gs, Cs, and Ts from the
mass of each PCR product. The base composition signatures from all detected segments
are compared with a database of base compositions of the known types and subtypes of
influenza viruses to identify the viral species present in the sample.

Sample Extraction
Nucleic acids are isolated and purified from samples and controls during the
sample preparation process. The nucleic acid isolation step uses a non-specific
capture chemistry. Nucleic acids in the sample are bound to magnetic beads and
non-nucleic acid sample material is washed away during multiple wash steps.
Purified nucleic acids are then released from the magnetic beads with an elution
buffer.
PCR Plate Setup and Amplification
The PLEX-ID Flu Assay Plate is a sealed, 96-well PCR plate with wells that are
pre-filled with PCR components. PCR plate setup takes place on the PLEX-ID .
FH
The purified nucleic acid solution from each processed sample and assay control,
along with PCR amplification reagents (reverse transcriptase, stabilization
reagent, and DNA Polymerase), is distributed to 8 wells, each of which contains a
unique PCR primer set. PCR amplification takes place on the PLEX-ID .
TC
Desalting of PCR Products
Following PCR amplification, the PCR plate is placed on the PLEX-ID Analyzer,
and the PCR product mixtures are desalted using a weak anion exchange method.
Desalting, or purification of the amplified product, is a necessary step prior to
analysis by mass spectrometry. The desalting process involves binding PCR
products to magnetic microparticles, followed by a series of washes. Unconsumed
deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), salts, and other low molecular
weight species that could interfere with the subsequent ESI-MS analysis are
removed by rinsing the microparticles with solutions containing volatile salts and
organic solvents. The final purified/desalted PCR products are eluted with a high
pH buffer solution containing methanol and piperidine imidazole.
Mass Spectrometry Analysis
The purified nucleic acids from each well are injected into an electrospray
ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ESI TOF-MS) that generates a
spectral signal based upon the mass-to-charge ratio of each product. The spectral
signals for each product are processed to determine its mass. Peptide-based mass
standards, which are added during the elution step of the desalting process, are
used to bracket the expected mass-to-charge range.
Conversion of Mass to Base Composition
A software algorithm converts the mass information to base composition using
the exact masses of each of the bases that comprise DNA and the known
information about the primer sets present in each well. The complementary nature
of the forward and reverse strands of each DNA product reduces the number of
possible base composition solutions.

--- Page 9 ---
Influenza Virus Identification
The PLEX-ID Analyzer identifies the influenza virus species and subtype in the
sample by comparing the base composition signature of the observed products to
a database that links base composition signature to influenza virus species and
subtype identity.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the PLEX-ID Flu assay was evaluated at 3 clinical sites.
Reproducibility was assessed using a nine member panel of contrived samples
that included a negative member, low positive panel members targeted near the
assay LOD and moderate positive panel members targeted at approximately 2 to 3
times the LOD for influenza B and the 3 influenza A subtypes detected by the
assay. Samples were tested in replicates of 4 with one replicate each of the
positive and negative control per batch. Two (2) batches were run per day and
each was run by a different operator with 2 operators per site. The study was
designed to allow for a total of 120 results for each panel member over 5 days of
testing. The PLEX-ID Flu Assay demonstrated reproducible performance within
and across all three sites for all viral levels tested when compared to the expected
outcome. The summary of the results obtained from the evaluation of multisite
reproducibility are presented in Table 3.

b. Precision
Within laboratory precision of the PLEX-ID Flu Assay was determined by testing
all nine members of the reproducibility panel in duplicate in two runs per day for
a total of twelve days. Each run contained the assay positive and negative controls
for a total of 20 samples per run. Multiple PLEX-ID Flu assay lots were used in
the study. The PLEX-ID Flu Assay demonstrated acceptable precision
performance over the twelve day test period. Table 4 is a summary of the

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls provided with the PLEX ID Flu Assay:
Internal Control
Each PCR well contains an Amplification Control. The control consists of an
in vitro synthesized RNA molecule specific to the primer pairs used, but
distinguishable from known target sequences. The Amplification Control
serves as the internal PCR control and provides scaling information for the
level of influenza RNA present in the sample. The level of influenza detected
is compared to a reporting cut-off. Although Amplification Control product
may not be detected in the presence of high levels of influenza, the total
amount of Amplification Control and influenza product detected must exceed
a validity threshold.
Positive Controls
A Positive Control, consisting of inactivated, but structurally intact, influenza
A and B viruses, is run with the PLEX-ID Flu assay as an indicator of nucleic
acid purity and recovery during sample preparation and also as a measure of
successful amplification and detection. The control is processed in the same
manner as clinical samples. Control material is prepared from highly purified
virus particles which have been isolated from cell culture and chemically and
enzymatically treated to alter their surface proteins. The resulting viral
particles and the nucleic acid are intact, but unable to bind to or penetrate host
cells. This control also serves as the process control for the entire assay and
must be run with each extraction batch. If the positive control is “negative”, it
may be indicative of incomplete extraction, amplification problems, or PLEX-
ID Flu assay reagent degradation. All clinical samples within the run are
invalid and must be repeated, starting with sample preparation. If the positive
control results in an error code, all clinical samples within the run are invalid
and must be repeated, starting with sample preparation.

Moderate Positive	48/48 (100%)	93%, 100%

--- Page 12 ---
Negative (No Template) Control
The negative control for the PLEX-ID Flu assay consists of viral transport
media. This control is processed in the same manner as samples and is run in
each extraction batch. If the negative control is “positive”, it is indicative of
possible contamination by other samples or by amplified product introduced
during sample preparation or during preparation of the PLEX-ID Flu Assay
Plate. All clinical samples within the run are invalid and must be repeated,
starting with sample preparation. If the negative controls results in an error
code, all clinical samples within the run are invalid and must be repeated,
starting with sample preparation.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LOD) for the PLEX-ID Flu assay was determined by
testing quantified (TCID /mL) influenza strains diluted in negative
50
nasopharyngeal swab matrix. Negative sample matrix was prepared from 464
pre-screened negative NP clinical swabs. Twenty confirmation replicates of
each of the following were tested: influenza A H1N1 (2009), influenza A
H1N1 (seasonal), influenza A H3N2 (seasonal), and influenza B. The LOD
was defined as the lowest influenza concentration at which > 95% of
replicates tested positive. The claimed LOD is summarized in the table
below.

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity:
The effect of 34 common respiratory microbes on the PLEX-ID Flu assay was
evaluated. Negative samples and samples containing influenza A H1N1
(2009), influenza A H1N1 (seasonal), influenza A H3N2 (seasonal), and
influenza B were also analyzed in the presence of the potentially cross-
reacting microbes. Each potentially cross-reacting bacterial strain was
acquired from ATCC or other sources, then re-grown and quantified. Each
potentially cross-reacting virus was acquired from and quantified by
ZeptoMetrix Corporation. All dilutions were made in Universal Transport

Medium (UTM). Test levels for each common respiratory microbe used in
the analysis are summarized in table 6.
This study was conducted in two parts, with each part analyzing two of the
target analytes tested with each of potential cross-reactants. For this analysis
Influenza A 2009 H1N1 and Influenza B target were analyzed together and
Influenza A H1N1 Seasonal and Influenza A H3N2 Seasonal were analyzed
together. Each flu combination was tested near the LOD (~5X) with the
indicated level of test organism from the table below spiked into the sample.
Each sample was tested in triplicate along with six replicates that only
contained the potentially cross-reacting microorganism. The influenza type or
subtypes identified and reported in the positive specimens spiked with
potential cross reactants matched the expected results. No influenza types or
subtypes were detected or reported in the negative specimens spiked with
potential cross-reactants. Table 7 summarizes the evaluation of assay
performance in the presence of potentially cross-reacting organisms.

f. Assay cut-off:
The PLEX-ID Flu Assay is a qualitative assay. The PLEX-ID analysis software
uses fixed values for two parameters, Level and Q-score, for defining the
reporting level of positive detections. These parameters are described briefly
below. Cutoff values (reporting thresholds) for these two parameters are set for
each primer group within a PLEX-ID assay, and detections must meet or exceed
these thresholds in order to be reported as positive. The assay protocol file
contains the cutoff values for the two parameters for each primer group in the
assay.
Level
PLEX-ID Flu Assay plate reaction wells each contain an Amplification
Control, a competitive PCR control whose product is distinguishable from
product generated from influenza RNA in the specimen. Since the PLEX-
ID PCR reactions run to saturation, the final levels of influenza and
control products are proportional to their initial levels. The level threshold
is derived based on the assay specific amplification controls in each well
and provides a relative amplification estimate compared to Amplification
Control.
Q-Score
The Q-score is an empirically derived metric calculated by the system
software to denote the goodness of fit of the detected signals (base

compositions of PCR-amplified fragments detected by mass spectrometry)
to the base count compositions associated with specific analytes in the
database. The Q-score integrates primer-dependent parameters such as
number of primer pairs producing signature-matched amplification
products compared to the number expected for the detected analyte and
consistency of amplitudes across multiple primer pairs. The Q-score has a
value from 0 to 1.
The cut off values for the PLEX-ID Flu assay on the PLEX-ID System were
determined empirically using the data from a set of analytical experiments.
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) plots were produced to visualize the
sensitivity and specificity for each of the target analytes over a range of possible
Q score and levels. From these plots, cutoff values of > 0.90 for the Q-score and
> 20 for the level were determined as the most appropriate for all target analytes.
These cutoff values were validated using the positive banked clinical specimens
with comparison to an FDA cleared molecular device. Furthermore, the results
from the multisite clinical study provided further support for these cutoff values.
g. Carryover
Carryover between samples was evaluated using high target concentrations (1 ×
105 viral genomes/mL) of influenza A (A/New Claedonia/20/99) and influenza B
(B/Florida/04/2006) alternately loaded with negative samples in the sample rack,
representing a worst case checkerboard configuration. This configuration was
utilized in the sample prep stage, thus offering a combined measure of potential
carryover between adjacent samples at all stages, including sample prep, PCR,
and PLEX-ID Analyzer desalting and ESI-TOF MS. Following five independent
isolations, no positive results were reported among the 120 negative samples
tested, resulting in an observed carryover rate of 0% (0/120).
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not Applicable
b. Matrix comparison:
An evaluation of various viral transport medium tubes for use with the PLEX-ID
Flu Assay was conducted. For a viral transport medium to be considered
acceptable the PLEX-ID Flu assay specimen storage requirement at 2 to 8°C and -
70°C had to be met. Copan UTM was used throughout the design verification
studies including the specimen stability study so additional testing of this medium
was not conducted. Five additional types of transport media were tested fresh,
following 4 days storage at 2-8ºC, following 1 month storage at -70ºC or colder
and following 4 months storage at -70ºC. Vials of each type were pooled, spiked
with low concentrations of both influenza A and influenza B viral cultures and
17

--- Page 18 ---
aliquoted for the test conditions. Sets of 20 replicates were tested at each
condition. The results, as summarized below for baseline, short term and long
term storage conditions in the various transport media types, demonstrated that
these additional types of viral transport media were acceptable for use with the
PLEX-ID Flu assay.

3. Clinical studies:
Clinical performance of the PLEX-ID Flu assay was assessed by testing
nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens from subjects presenting with symptoms of
influenza-like illness.
Prospectively collected clinical specimens were tested at three sites. All specimens
were tested with an assay FDA cleared for the detection and discrimination of
influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and Respiratory Syncytial virus nucleic acids
isolated and purified from NP swab specimens obtained from symptomatic patients
(Comparator 1). Specimens with a positive influenza A test result went on for further
testing with Comparator 2, an assay FDA cleared for the detection and discrimination
of influenza A virus subtypes [influenza A H1N1 (2009), influenza A H1N1
(seasonal), influenza A H3N2 (seasonal)] from nucleic acids isolated and purified
from NP swab specimens. Aliquots from the same specimens were tested with the
PLEX-ID Flu assay. For each subtype of influenza A [H1N1 (2009), H1N1
(seasonal), H3N2 (seasonal)], the point estimate for positive percent agreement (PPA)
and negative percent agreement (NPA) was calculated. PCR followed by bi-
directional sequencing was used to test discrepant samples between Comparator 1 and
Comparator 2, Comparator 1 vs. PLEX-ID Flu, and Comparator 2 vs. PLEX-ID Flu.
The results from bi-directional sequence testing were not used to calculate the
positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement of the PLEX-ID Flu
assay.

Of the 1282 specimens included in the study, 6 were unresolved by Comparator 1 and
were excluded, resulting in 1276 specimens included in the final analysis.
A total of 90 unique specimens were influenza A positive by Comparator 1 and 1186
were negative. All 90 specimens were tested by Comparator 2 to determine influenza
A subtypes [influenza A H1N1 (2009), influenza A H1N1 (seasonal), influenza A
H3N2 (seasonal)]. From these 90 unique specimens, 6 were negative for all three
subtypes by Comparator 2. The remaining 84 specimens generated a total of 88
positive results. Four specimens generated two different subtype results each by
Comparator 2. For one of these four specimens, Comparator 2 assay reported both
H1N1 and H3N2 while the PLEX-ID Flu assay reported an H1N1 (seasonal) result.
For the remaining 3 specimens, Comparator 2 reported both H3N2 and H1N1,
whereas the PLEX-ID Flu assay reported H3N2 (seasonal). These 88 positive results
comprised 32 influenza A H1N1 (2009), 7 influenza A H1N1 (seasonal) positive, and
49 influenza A H3N2 (seasonal) positive results.
From the 1287 prospective NP swab specimens collected for this study and tested,
98.7% (1285/1302) of PLEX-ID assays results generated were valid.
The comparison of the PLEX-ID Flu assay and Comparator 2 results for influenza A
H1N1 (2009) are shown in Table 10, influenza A H1N1 (seasonal) in Table 11, and

Retrospective Specimen Testing
Due to the decreased prevalence of influenza A 2009 H1N1 and the absence of
influenza A seasonal H1N1 and H3N2, the prospectively collected specimen
population was supplemented with pre-selected banked specimens that were
collected in February 2008, and from January 2009 through March 2009, and left
over archived specimens collected from April 2009 through December 2009.
A total of 1378 retrospective specimens were tested. Of these specimens, 1341
were included in the analysis (the remaining 37 were excluded either due to
unavailable results for the PLEX-ID Flu assay or Comparator 1 assay, duplicate
subjects, or failure to meet subject inclusion criteria).
Of the 1341 retrospective specimens, 634 were influenza A positive and 707 were
negative by Comparator 1. All 634 positive specimens were tested to determine
influenza A subtype (influenza A 2009 H1N1, influenza A (seasonal) H1N1,
influenza A (seasonal) H3N2). Two specimens were unresolved by Comparator 2
and, therefore, excluded, resulting in 1339 total specimens in the analysis. Fifty-
four of the 634 Comparator 1 influenza A positive specimens were negative for
all three subtypes by Comparator 2 and were included as Comparator negative
specimens. Consequently, 578 positive results were included in the analysis: 548
influenza A H1N1 (2009), 28 influenza A H1N1 (seasonal), and 2 influenza A
H3N2 (seasonal).
From the 1378 retrospective NP swab specimens tested in this study, 93.4%
(1368/1464) of PLEX-ID assays results generated were valid.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The clinical performance of the PLEX-ID Flu assay on the PLEX-ID System was
established using nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens prospectively collected from
two U.S. clinical sites and three specimen suppliers from September 2009 through
June 2010. A total of 1287 prospective NP swab specimens were collected for the
PLEX-ID Flu clinical study. Of the 1287, five specimens were excluded: duplicate
specimens were collected from two subjects (the second specimen from each subject
was excluded from the analysis), one specimen from a subject who did not meet the
inclusion criteria, and two specimens had an invalid PLEX-ID Flu result, for a total of
1282 included specimens. The prevalence of influenza A 2009 H1N1 decreased
significantly during the collection period, consequently, there were only 37 positive
influenza A 2009 H1N1, 4 positive influenza A H1N1 (seasonal), 50 positive
influenza A H3N2 (seasonal), and 24 positive influenza B specimens among the 1282
specimens. Prevalence rates and demographics are presented in Table 18 and Table
19, respectively, for four of the five sites that provided prospectively collected
specimens. No demographic information was available from supplier Site 3 (N=199)
and one subject from clinical Site 1.
