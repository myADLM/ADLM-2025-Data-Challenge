510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
k121012
B. Purpose for Submission:
The submission is to obtain clearance for FlexLab 3.6 as an accessory to clinical
laboratory analyzers such as ARCHITECT c8000 analyzer. The manufacturer uses
the ARCHITECT c8000 to demonstrate FlexLab 3.6 barcode sample ID transmission
to the analyzer and analytical equivalence to manual sample introduction versus
automated sample introduction on the analyzer.
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Inpeco, FlexLab 3.6 (distributed as: Abbott Laboratories ACCELERATOR a3600)
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Quantitative, ion selective electrode (ISE)
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The FlexLab 3.6 Automation is a modular system designed to automate Pre-
Analytical and Post-Analytical processing, sample handling in order to automate
sample processing in the Laboratory.
The system consolidates multiple Analytical instruments into a unified
workstation that communicates with Hospital information System (HIS).
The automation software provides for workload management, sample routing to
relevant analytical instrument based on sample orders coming from LIS
(Laboratory Information System) and instrument operational status monitoring.
This is accomplished through communication connections between the
automation, analytical instruments and LIS or middleware.
Pre-analytical and post-analytical processing are as follows: sample loading and
unloading and sample identification by barcode read (previously done by the
analyzer), sample transport along the system and routing to relevant modules,
loading and unloading in centrifuge, de-capping, sealing, de-sealing, storing in a
1

temperature controlled environment, aliquoting, aliquot sample capping, and
sample presentation to connected analytical instruments.
2. Principles of Operation:
Ion selective electrode (ISE) using potentiometry
3. Modes of Operation:
The FlexLab 3.6 Automation is a modular system designed to automate Pre-
Analytical and Post-Analytical processing, sample handling in order to automate
sample processing in the Laboratory.
The system consolidates multiple Analytical instruments into a unified
workstation. The automation software provides for workload management,
sample routing to relevant analytical instrument based on sample orders coming
from LIS (Laboratory Information System) and instrument operational status
monitoring. This is accomplished through communication connections between
the automation, analytical instruments and LIS or middleware.
4. Specimen Identification:
Bar coded sample tubes read directly by analyzer when placed on LSH, or sample
bar code read by FlexLab 3.6 and electronically transferred to the ARCHITECT
c8000 analyzer when presented at the aspiration point
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The analyzer interface module provides the path required to move sample tubes to
the analyzer and directly loaded into the ARCHITECT via the LSH or via
FlexLab 3.6 Sampling takes place directly from the primary tube presented to the
aspiration point by the FlexLab 3.6 track or spur.
6. Calibration:
- Provided in k093318
7. Quality Control:
