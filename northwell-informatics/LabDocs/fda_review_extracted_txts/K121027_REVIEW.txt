I. Device Description:
Diamond Diagnostics ATAC 8000/Envoy 500 ISE Calibrators consist of two
calibrators, a low level and a high level. Both low and high level calibrators consist of
an aqueous buffered solution of electrolytes and preservative in de-ionized water. It
contains no human or animal products. It is a liquid packaged in a 22ml screw top
amber vial. Each vial contains 20 ml of solution.
Each calibrator is comprised of the following concentrations of analytes:
ISE Na+ K+ Cl- CO

Value Assignment:
Commercially available salts/chemical constituents are gravimetrically
weighed and added to Type 1 deionized water to yield the desired
concentrations. To ensure that target values are met, multiple replicates of
test samples are measured at the beginning and end of the production run on
multiple analyzers and must passed the target ranges prior to release. Target
values are determined by taking the mean of multiple determinations
performed on randomly selected samples from each lot. In addition,
calibrators are also tested on the ATAC 8000 and Envoy 500 instruments
and must pass the target values specifications before release. The target
values specifications are listed below:

Stability:
Shelf-life stability was tested using an accelerated stability study. Real-time
stability study is still on-going. The accelerated stability testing protocols and
acceptance criteria were described and found to be adequated. Both calibrators
low and high has an estimated shelf life of 24 months when stored at 18-25˚C.
There is no open-vial claim since the calibrators are designed to be used once
only.
