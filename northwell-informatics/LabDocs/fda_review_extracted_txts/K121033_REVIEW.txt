G. Intended Use:
1. Indication(s) for Use:
The Virtuoso™ system provides automated digital slide creation, management, analysis,
and viewing. It is intended for in vitro diagnostic use as an aid to the pathologist in the
display, detection, counting, review and classification of tissues and cells of clinical
interest based on particular morphology, color, intensity, size, pattern and shape.
The Virtuoso™ System for Ki67 (30-9) is for digital read and image analysis
applications. This particular Virtuoso™ system is intended for use as an aid to the
pathologist in the detection and semi-quantitative measurement of Ki67 (30-9) protein
2

--- Page 3 ---
in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded normal and neoplastic tissue. This device is an
accessory to the Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. CONFIRM™ anti-Ki67 (30-9) Rabbit
Monoclonal Primary Antibody assay. The Ventana Medical Systems, Inc.
CONFIRM™ anti-Ki67 (30-9) assay is indicated for use in assessing the proliferative
activity of normal and neoplastic breast tissue. When used with this assay, the
Virtuoso™ System for Ki67 (30-9) is indicated for use as an aid in the assessment of
Ki67 status in breast cancer patients (but is not the sole basis for treatment).
Note: The IHC Ki67 (30-9) Digital Read and Image Analysis applications are
adjunctive computer-assisted methodologies for the qualified pathologist in the
acquisition and measurement of images from microscope glass slides of breast cancer
specimens stained for the presence of Ki67 protein. The pathologist should verify
agreement with the Image Analysis software application score. The accuracy of the
test results depends on the quality of the IHC staining. It is the responsibility of a
qualified pathologist to employ appropriate morphological studies and controls as
specified in the instructions for the CONFIRM™ anti-Ki67 (30-9) Rabbit
Monoclonal Primary Antibody assay to assure the validity of the Virtuoso™ System
for Ki67 (30-9) Digital Read and Image Analysis scores. The actual correlation of
CONFIRM™ anti-Ki67 (30-9) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary antibody assay to clinical
outcome has not been established.
2. Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
For prescription use only
Indicated for use with either the Benchmark XT or ULTRA™ stainers.
* A precautionary statement indicating that this device has not been tested, or its safety
and effectiveness validated, when used with a personal computer (PC) from home was
included in the Limitations section of the device package insert.

a. Accuracy:
The performance of the Virtuoso™ System for Ki67 (30-9) when used in conjunction
with the Benchmark ULTRA™ stainer was validated by assessing the positive
percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), and overall percent
agreement (OPA) between the reference manual method (with a traditional
microscope) and both the digital read (DR) and image analysis (IA) applications of
the Virtuoso™ system. Patient slides were scored as positive or negative for Ki67
status using the percent positive staining cutoff of <10% for the distinction between
positive and negative staining.
Concordance with manual scoring was assessed between scores assigned to 120
specimens for both digital reads and image analysis. The acceptance criteria of an
overall agreement rate of at least 75% were met in these studies. Concordance of
digital reads with manual scoring was assessed at one site, whereas concordance of
image analysis with manual scoring was performed at 3 study sites. The agreements
with the 95% confidence intervals (CI) around the agreements are shown below. All
confidence intervals are 2-sided 95% confidence intervals calculated using the score
method.
