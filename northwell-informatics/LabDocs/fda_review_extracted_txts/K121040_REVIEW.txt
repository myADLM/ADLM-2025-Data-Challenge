H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The SMARTLYTE is an automated, microprocessor-controlled analyzer which utilizes ion-
selective electrodes for the measurement of sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium and
lithium in serum, plasma, whole blood, dialysate and pre-diluted urine samples. In addition,
the analyzer can also measure sodium, potassium, chloride and calcium in dialysate
samples.
The SMARTLYTE Sodium Assay is intended to measure sodium in whole blood,
serum, plasma, urine and dialysate on the SMARTLYTE Electrolyte Analyzer.
Measurements obtained by this device are used to monitor electrolyte balance in the
diagnosis and treatment of aldosteronism (excessive secretion of the hormone
aldosterone), diabetes insipidus (chronic excretion of large amounts of dilute urine,
accompanied by extreme thirst), adrenal hypertension, Addison's disease (caused by
destruction of the adrenal glands), dehydration, inappropriate antidiuretic hormone
secretion, or other diseases involving electrolyte imbalance.
The SMARTLYTE Potassium Assay is intended to measure potassium in whole
blood, serum, plasma, urine and dialysate on the SMARTLYTE Electrolyte
Analyzer. Measurements obtained by this device are used to monitor electrolyte
balance in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases conditions characterized by low or
high blood potassium levels.
The SMARTLYTE Chloride Assay is intended to measure the level of chloride in
whole blood, serum, plasma, urine and dialysate. Chloride measurements are used in
the diagnosis and treatment of electrolyte and metabolic disorders such as cystic
fibrosis and diabetic acidosis.
The SMARTLYTE Calcium Assay is intended to measure ionized calcium levels in
whole blood, plasma, serum, and dialysate. Calcium measurements are used in the
2

diagnosis and treatment of parathyroid disease, a variety of bone diseases, chronic
renal disease and tetany (intermittent muscular contractions or spasms).
The SMARTLYTE Lithium Assay is intended to measure lithium (from the drug lithium
carbonate) in whole blood, plasma, and serum. Measurements of lithium are used to assure
that the proper drug dosage is administered in the treatment of patients with mental
disturbances, such as manic-depressive illness (bipolar disorder).
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
Bicarbonate based dialysis fluid should be analyzed in the Bicarbonate mode. Analysis
should be carried out as quickly as possible after collection of the sample into an air tight
container to prevent changes in Bicarbonate concentration.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Diamond Diagnostics SMARTLYTE Electrolyte Analyzer
I. Device Description:
The SMARTLYTE is an automated, microprocessor-controlled analyzer which utilizes ion-
selective electrodes for the measurement of sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium and lithium.
The analyzer self- calibrates using Diamond Diagnostics Fluid Pack (k013850) every 4 hours
through out the day or on request. Mission controls (k033063) are the recommended quality
control material to be used daily.

L. Test Principle:
The SMARTLYTE measures sodium, potassium, chloride, ionized calcium, and lithium
using ion selective electrode technology. The flow-through sodium electrode contains a
glass tube, specially formulated to be sensitive to sodium ions. The flow-through potassium,
chloride, ionized calcium, and lithium electrodes incorporate a neutral carrier ionophore
membrane. The potential of each electrode is measured relative to a fixed, stable voltage
established by the silver/silver chloride reference electrode. An ion selective electrode
develops a voltage that varies with the concentration of the ion to which it responds. The
relationship between the voltage developed and the concentration of the sensed ion is
logarithmic.

Performance studies for this submission are limited to dialysate samples only. Please
refer to the original submission (k082462) for the studies performed on whole blood,
serum, plasma, and urine samples for each analyte.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Three levels (spent dialysates) of each analyte across the measuring range were used
for the study. Within run precision was performed by running 30 replicates of each
level without calibration between measurements. The replicates were run consecutively
in one day. For run-to-run precision, the samples were measured twice a day in
duplicate for ten consecutive days resulting in n=40 replicates. The acceptance criteria
for sodium, potassium and chloride were expressed as %CV, while SD was used for
Calcium. The results are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated by preparing serially diluted solutions with 17 different
concentrations covering entire measuring range of Na+, K+, Cl-, Ca2+ in spent
dialysates. Linear regression was performed on the results using expected values
based on the stock sample dilution. The results are shown below.

The data provided in the linearity studies supports the sponsor’s claimed measuring
ranges.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators were previously cleared under k013850 and controls under k033063.
d. Detection limit:
Reportable ranges were determined based on the linearity studies (see M.1.b. above)
e. Analytical specificity:
Prepared dialysate solutions are aqueous solutions of salts typically consisting of the
analytes at the concentrations close to the following: 140 mEq/L Sodium, 1.25 mmol/L
Calcium, 1.0 mEq/L Potassium, 1.0 mEq/L Magnesium, 105.5 mEq/L Chloride, 4.00
mEq/L Acetate, 0.1 % Dextrose, and 39 mEq/L Bicarbonate. The effects of endogenous
and exogenous factors would vary depending upon the formulation of the membrane used
in the electrode. Spent dialysate may contain urea, lactate, glucose and creatinine and other
small molecules from the hemodialysis process. Interference studies were performed on
the possible interferents found in spent dialysates using dialysates spiked with the potential
interference substances. The % biases were calculated between the spiked and un-spiked
samples. All samples were tested in replicates of ten. The % bias between the spiked
samples and un-spiked samples were all within ± 10% bias for the following
concentrations tested.
Endogenous Interference:

Urea 30.81 mg/dL
Lactate 108.11 mg/dL

The sponsor has placed the following limitations in the labeling:
“A number of substances have been reported to cause physiological changes in blood,
serum and plasma analyte concentrations. These substances can also alter dialysates.
Medications and endogenous substances can affect results and clinicians must evaluate
results based on the patient’s entire clinical situation.”
“Bicarbonate based dialysis fluid should be analyzed in the Bicarbonate mode. Analysis
should be carried out as quickly as possible after collection of the sample into an air tight
container to prevent changes in Bicarbonate concentration.“

The study results indicate that ionized calcium is not stable in bicarbonate dialysate solutions.
Since prepared dialysate is not stable, spent dialysate is not expected to be stable during
storage. Dialysates should be tested as soon as possible after collection.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
