centrifugation, the supernatants are decanted or aspirated. The amount of radioactivity in
the pellets is directly proportional to the amount of antibody contained in the samples.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Intra-assay
The intra-assay precision was determined by testing six serum specimens
which included one low (5.69 U/mL), one high (17.42 U/mL), two very high
(1269 and 3244 U/L) and four samples close to the assay cut-off (0.9-1.7
U/mL). The low, high and very high serum specimens were tested 25 times
and the samples around the cut-off, 14 times. Results showed %CV ranged
from 4.59-13.5% (see table below).

Inter-assay
The inter-assay precision was determined by testing thirteen samples: two
serum specimens once a day for twenty days; eleven serum specimens once a
day for 9-10 days and two additional serum samples once a day for 15 days.
The serum specimens consisted of three specimens with anti-21-OH
concentrations close to the assay 1 U/mL cut-off (0.6, 0.7 and 1.1 U/mL); two
low levels (3.7 and 7.5 U/mL); six moderate levels (10.1, 12.9, 19.9, 22.4,
27.1, 38.6 U/mL) and two very high levels (1141 and 2861 U/mL). The
%CVs ranged from 5.85-22.4% (see table below).

*It is common for samples with low signals with a mean of 0.6 U/mL which is below the assay
0.1 U/mL cut-off to exhibit higher variability than higher signals.

Lot to lot reproducibility:
Twenty nine kit lots were tested using seven specimens (two controls and five
serum samples) over a period of 116 weeks. The values of the seven
specimens were comparable between the twenty nine lots and demonstrated
acceptable reproducibility with %CV ranging from 8.4-17.44% CV with the
low concentration samples having the high %CV.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Measuring range
Three serum specimens with an initial concentration of >5000 U/mL, 3011
U/mL and 2597 U/mL, were diluted two-folds with kit negative control. The
highest dilution for samples 1 and 2 was 1:256 and 1:96 for sample 3. Since
these three samples did not cover the lower end of the measuring range of 0.4
U/mL, three additional samples (sample 4 with 2225 U/mL; sample 5 with
2622 U/mL and sample 6 with 5513 U/mL) were tested. Sample 4 was
diluted serially from 1:2 through 1:1024 with the lowest result of 0.088 U/mL;
sample 5 was diluted from 1:2 through 1:2048 with the lowest result of 0.17
U/mL and sample 6 was diluted from 1:2 through 1:1024. The neat and
diluted specimens and the kit negative and positive controls were assayed
using the 21-OH Ab RIA kit protocol. The measuring range was determined
to be 0.4-5000 U/mL.
High Dose Hook Effect
No hook effect was observed for 21-OH Ab concentration up to 7826 U/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There is no recognized reference standard available. The 21-OH control and
calibrator production are done according to approved standard operating
procedures (purchased from approved supplier).
Shelf life
Stability was established on three lots of 21-OH Ab RIA kit. Samples used
included 2 controls (4.8-8.0 U/mL and 52-86 U/mL) and 3 patient samples
(from 11-54, 7-29 and 4-15 U/mL). Three additional lots were tested on two
patient samples covering the lower ranges (from 0.2-1.5 U/mL). Data from 6
lots support a shelf life of 8 weeks. Real-time testings were performed at 0, 4,
8 and 9 week intervals.

d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank was computed to be 0.2 U/mL from sequentially testing the
zero calibrator 25 times.
The limit of detection of 0.344 U/mL was calculated from 25 replicate
determinations each from four healthy blood donor specimens.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference by endogenous substances: No interference was observed in 10
specimens spiked with 1000 and 3000 mg/dL Intralipids. Interferences with
hemoglobin (at 500 mg/dL) and bilirubin (at 20 mg/dL) were observed in
eight out of ten samples. The Package Insert states that hemolytic and icteric
samples should not be used in this assay.
Crossreactivity with other autoimmune diseases and other conditions for
autoimmune primary adrenal insufficiency differential diagnosis: The
KRONUS 21-OH Ab RIA Assay Kit was tested with 369 sera from other
autoimmune diseases and conditions for autoimmune primary adrenal
insufficiency differential diagnosis. These samples comprised of 2 premature
ovarian failure (POF) (no Addison’s Disease [AD] or Autoimmune
Polygrandular Syndrome II [APS II]), 77 Graves Disease, 67 Hashimoto’s
Thyroiditis, 10 Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 150 Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, 35
Myasthenia gravis, 3 post-tuberculosis Addison disease, 3
hypoparathyroidism, 2 hypopituitarinism, 10 celiac disease, 2 vitiligo, 2
alopecia areata, 2 Sjogrens syndrome, 2 sarcoidosis and 2 pernicious anemia.
Three hundred sixty-one (361) of 369 specimens were negative with the
KRONUS 21-OH Ab RIA Assay Kit. Five positive sera were as follows: 1
Graves Disease serum at 2.2 U/mL; 1 Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis serum at 1.8
U/mL; 4 Type 1 Diabetes mellitus sera at 1.03, 1.06. 1.7 and 18 U/mL; and 2
2 POF (no AD or APS II) at 11.2 and 446.3 U/mL.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-off (greater than or equal to 1.0 U/mL is positive) for the
KRONUS 21-OHAb Assay Kit was determined by testing specimens from
243 healthy blood donors. Ninety-eight percent (237) were negative and 6
were positive for 21-OH Ab. For the six positive samples, two had high
concentrations (3.7 U/mL and 3.4 U/mL) and the remaining four samples had
concentrations no greater than 1.5 U/mL. The mean result was 0.08 U/mL
with a standard deviation of 0.36 U/mL.
Given these results and taking into account the analytical sensitivity of the
assay, values ≤ 1.0 U/mL are considered negative and values > 1.0 U/mL are
6

considered positive for 21-OH autoantibodies.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
The clinical performance was evaluated on 500 clinically defined patient
samples. These samples had the following diagnosis: 60 patients with AD; 50
