I. Device Description:
The Diazyme HCY POC Test Kit consists of the following components (1) DRS
Cuvettes pre-filled with Reagent 1, (2) DRS Caps Pre-filled with Reagent 2, and (3) one
preprogrammed Radio Frequency ID (RFID) card which contains a lot specific
calibration curve. Reagent 1 and 2 are comprised of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)
(0.1mM), NADH (>0.2mM), TCEP (>0.5mM), 2- oxoglutarate (5.0mM), Glutamate
dehydrogenase (10 KU/L), SAH hydrolase (3.0 KU/L), Adenosine deaminase (5.0

Smart Analyzer (k092911) is a compact cuvette based spectrophotometer machine for
point-of-care testing designed to analyze readings from single use reagent cuvettes. The
instrument only uses the Diazyme Reagent System (DRS) cuvette and caps and performs
the assay with a preprogrammed Radio Frequency ID (RFID) card. The lot specific RFID
card contains reagent addition time, mixing time, reading time and calibration curve for
estimating Homocysteine concentration.

L. Test Principle:
Diazyme Homocysteine POC Test Kit contains reagents intended for use with the SMART
analyzer for the quantitative determination of Homocysteine (HCY) in human serum or
plasma. Oxidized HCY is first reduced to free HCY which then reacts with a co-substrate, S-
adenosylmethionine (SAM) catalyzed by a HCY S-methyltransferase to form methionine
(Met) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). SAH is assessed by coupled enzyme reactions
invluding SAH hydrolase, adenosine (Ado) deaminiase and HCY by SAH hydrolase. The
formed HCY that is originated from the co-substrate SAM is cycled into the HCY conversion
reaction by HCY S-methyltransferase. This forms a co-substrate conversion product-based
enzyme cycling reaction system with significant amplification of detection signals. The
formed Ado is immediately hydrolyzed into inosine and ammonia which reacts with
glutamate dehydrogenase with concomitant conversion of NADH to NAD+ . The
concentration of HCY in the sample is indirectly proportional to the amount of NADH
converted to NAD+ which is read spectrophotometrically at 340nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Internal Testing
Precision was evaluated according to CLSI EP5-A guideline. In order to evaluate
precision three levels of serum controls containing 7.3,11.87 and 29.32 µmol/L
Homocysteine were tested in duplicate, two runs per day, over ten days (total
measurements per sample, n=40). The results are summarized in the table below:
Sample N Mean (µmol/L) Within Run Total
SD %CV SD %CV
Control 1 40 7.5 0.24 3.2 0.26 3.4
Control 2 40 11.8 0.22 1.8 0.42 3.5
Control 3 40 29.0 0.82 2.8 0.95 3.3
POC Testing
A precision study was performed at three physician office laboratories by intended
users. The study was evaluated at three physician office laboratories (POL). A total of
9 serum samples with HCY levels from 10.26 µmol/L to 42.73 µmol/L were tested at
each site. Total measurements per sample, n=20). The results are summarized in the
table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Percent recovery was assessed across the reportable range of the device (3-50
µmol/L). A serum sample containing 50 µmol/L homocysteine was diluted with
saline to create 11 sample levels across the measuring range of the device. The
samples were measured in triplicate on the SMART Analyzer. The mean of the
obtained Homocysteine results (obtained on the SMART analyzer) were plotted
against the expected values and an appropriate line fitted by standard linear regression
resulted in the following equation:
y=0.9749x+0.751; R²=0.9992
Based upon the linearity data and the LoQ study, the sponsor claims a measuring
range of 3 to 50 µmol/L
The sponsor recommends that all samples >50µM be diluted with deionized water
and a 1:1 dilution be performed. In order to support this procedure, the sponsor
provided a dilution study in which 4 serum samples were spiked and then diluted 1:1
with water and analyzed on the SMART analyzer using the Homocysteine POC test.
Sample range was 62.2-84.2 µmol/L and % Recovery was 99.79 – 104.68.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Homocysteine POC test calibration system is traceable to the higher order NIST SRM
1955. Homocysteine POC test utilizes a Calibration Radio Frequency Identification
Card (RFID) card that is programmed with a lot specific calibration curve and is
supplied in each kit. RFID cards are programmed at the manufacturer site and are
subject to the same quality control checks as the reagents and controls. According to
the sponsor, the calibration curve is stable until the printed expiration date which is 8
months.
To construct the Diazyme HCY SMART Assay RFID card calibration curve, 5 levels
of known calibrator levels are tested with the Diazyme Homocysteine POC Test
reagents on three SMART analyzers. The calibrator value and the mean absorbance
change are programmed into the RFID card.
Value Assignment (controls): previously cleared in k042448
Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank, Limit of Detection and Limit of Quantitation of Diazyme HCY
POC Test kit were determined according to CLSI EP17-A in the following manner:
To calculate the Limit of Blank (LoB) of the Diazyme HCY POC Test kit, the True
Blank Sample (water) was tested with 20 replicates daily for three days. LOB was
calculated as the mean of the 57th and 58th highest values for the true blanks. Based
upon the results, the sponsor claims a LoB=0.06µmol/L.
To calculate the Limit of Detection (LoD) of the Diazyme HCY POC Test kit, five
low samples were tested with 4 replicates daily for three days. LoD=LoB + (1.465*
SD of Low samples). Based upon the results, the sponsor claims a LoD=0.32 µmol/L.
The lowest level of the calibrator for the HCY RFID card is between 2-3 µmol/L
HCY. No values that are below this level are able to be reported by the analyzer.
To calculate the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) of the Diazyme HCY POC Test kit, 5
serum samples were prepared with HCY values at the lower range (2.1-2.61 µmol/L).
20 replicates of the low samples were run and EP evaluator software was used to
estimate the LoQ. Based upon the results and the limitations imposed by the
calibrator RFID card (cannot measure samples <2 µmol/L, the sponsor claims a LoQ
= 3µmol/L.
The claimed measuring range is 3 – 50 µmol/L based on linearity.
See linearity study in M.1.b of this 510(k) decision summary.

e. Analytical specificity:
The level of interference from substances normally present in serum was determined
by testing two HCY serum samples (12 µM and 29 µM) spiked with various
concentrations of the interferent. The following substances produced less than 10%
deviation when tested at levels equal to the concentrations listed below.
Endogenous Substances Concentration
Unconjugated Bilirubin 40 mg/dL
Conjugated Bilirubin 40 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 500 mg/dL
Triglyceride 1000 mg/dL

The labeling states “patients who are taking methotrexate, carbamazepine, phenytoin,
nitrous oxide, anticonvulsants, or 6-azauridine triacetate, may have higher levels of
HCY due to metabolic interference with homocysteine metabolism.”

Internal Site Testing
To assess the accuracy of the device, 74 samples (70 natural serum samples and 4
spiked samples were measured using the Diazyme Homocysteine POC test run in
parallel with the Diazyme HCY Two Reagent Enzymatic Assay on the Olympus
AU400 analyzer. Sample values ranged from 4.17-49.50 µmol/L. Three SMART
analyzers and two lots of reagents were used and samples were assayed in singlicate.

Forty paired serum and plasma matched sets (EDTAPlasma/Li-Heparin) samples
were tested on the on the SMART analyzer using the Homocytsteine POC test kits.
Of the 40 samples that were analyzed 32 were native samples and 8 were spiked
samples. Sample range tested was 7.97 – 47.24 µmol/L.
Linear regression analysis is as follows :
EDTA plasma vs. Serum – y=1.0197x-0.5385 R²= 0.9889
Li Heparin vs. Serum – y=0.9632x+0.3177 R²=0.99
Based on the data, the sponsor claims EDTA plasma and Lithium Heparin are
acceptable anticoagulants for this assay.
