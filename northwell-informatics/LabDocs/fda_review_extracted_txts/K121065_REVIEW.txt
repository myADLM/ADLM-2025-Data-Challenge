H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Refer to Indications for Use
2. Indication(s) for use:
Polymed Therapeutics Fastep Dipstick Drugs of Abuse Screen Device and Polymed
Therapeutics Fastep Dipcard Drugs of Abuse Screen Device are rapid chromatographic
immunoassays for the qualitative and simultaneous detection of one to seven of the
following drugs in a variety of combinations in human urine. The cutoff concentrations
and direct calibrator for these drugs are as follows:
Analyte Abbreviation Direct Calibrator Cutoff (ng/mL)
Amphetamine AMP Amphetamine 1000
Benzodiazepines BZO Oxazepam 300
Cocaine COC Benzoylecgonine 300
Marijuana THC 11-nor-Δ9-THC9-COOH 50
Morphine MOR Morphine 2000
Phencyclidine PCP Phencyclidine 25
Ecstasy MDMA 3,4-Methylenediioxy-MET 500
For prescription use in central laboratories only. This assay provides only a preliminary
analytical test result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order
to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry
(GC/MS) or Liquid Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) are the preferred
confirmatory method.
Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse
test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use in central laboratories only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable; this is a visually read single use device
I. Device Description:
The devices incorporate a one-step, colloidal gold based immunochromatographic strip for
the rapid, qualitative detection of Marijuana, Cocaine, Phencyclidine, Morphine,
Amphetamine, Benzodiazepines, and MDMA (Ecstasy) in human urine. The Dipstick device
consists of a single strip, and the Dipcard device consists of one or more strips held by a card.

L. Test Principle:
The Fastep Dipstick and Dipcard Drugs of Abuse Screen Devices are one-step immunoassays
in which chemically labeled drugs (drug-protein conjugates) compete for limited antibody
binding sites with drugs that may be present in urine. The single and multi-test device
contains one or more than one test strips in the cassette or dip card. The drug-protein
conjugates are pre-coated on the test band of the membrane and the drug antibody-colloidal
gold conjugate pads are placed at one end of the membrane. In the absence of drugs in the
urine, the solution of the colored antibody-colloidal gold conjugates move along with the
sample solution upward chromatographically by capillary action across the membrane to the
immobilized drug-protein conjugate zones on the test band region. The colored antibody-gold
conjugates then attach to the drug-protein conjugates to form visible lines as the antibodies
complex with the drug conjugates. Therefore, the formation of the visible precipitant in the
test band occurs when the test urine is negative for the drug. When drug is present in the
urine, the drug/metabolite antigen competes with drug-protein conjugates on the test band
region for the limited antibody on the colored drug antibody-colloidal gold conjugate pad.
When a sufficient concentration of the drug is present, it will fill the limited antibody binding
sites. This will prevent attachment of the colored antibody (drug-protein conjugate)-colloidal
gold conjugate to the drug-protein conjugate zone on the test band region. Therefore, absence
of the color band on the test region indicates a positive result. A control band with a different
antigen/antibody reaction is added to the immunochromatographic membrane strip at the
control region (C) to indicate that the test has performed properly.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision for each test format was evaluated in a study conducted with three operators
collecting the data in three runs per day over 17 days. This resulted in a total of 51
results per operator per each concentration for each of the seven analytes. Results are
summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. The assays produce qualitative results only.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
These devices have internal process controls. A colored line appearing in the control
region confirms sufficient sample volume and adequate membrane wicking. Users are
informed that the test is invalid if a line fails to appear in the control region.
Labeling states that control materials are not supplied with this device; however it is
good laboratory practice to confirm the test procedure and to verify proper test
performance. Users should follow all applicable guidelines for testing QC materials.
Stability:
Accelerated and real-time studies have been conducted. Real-time studies are
ongoing. Protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be
acceptable. The manufacturer claims the following expiration date:
When stored at 2–30 ºC product is stable until the expiration date which is 24 months.

Analytical performance of the device around the cutoff is characterized in section a
(precision/reproducibility) above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was evaluated by spiking various concentrations of similarly
structured drug compounds into drug-free urine. By analyzing various concentration
of each compound the sponsor determined the concentration of the drug that produced
a response approximately equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the assay. Results
of those studies appear in the tables below:

Evaluation of specific gravity and pH on test results:
To evaluate the effect of pH value on the test results, urine controls at 0%, 75%,
125% and 300% of the cutoff value were used. Each control level was adjusted by
either NaOH or HCl solution to pH levels at 3.0, 5.0, 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5. Each test
sample was tested in duplicate.
To evaluate the effect of specific gravity, urine controls at +/-25% and +/-50% of the
cut-off values were spiked or diluted to obtain specific gravities in the following four
ranges: 1.000 – 1.015, 1.016 – 1.025, 1.026 – 1.03, and > 1.03. Each test sample was
tested in duplicate.
The testing results demonstrate that the pH and specific gravity ranges tested do not
affect results around each analyte cut-off.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed cutoff
concentration appears in the precision section, above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies for each test format were performed in house by trained
operators. Samples were blinded and randomized before being given to the
operators. The percent agreement with GC-MS ranged from a low of 85% to a high
of 100%. Results are summarized below:

b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable. Urine is the only matrix that may be used with this device.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
The sponsor performed a reading time study to validate the recommended read time.
The protocol and acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. The
labeling instructs users that negative results may be read as early as 3 minutes after
sample is added. Positive results may be read from 5 – 10 minutes.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Not applicable.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
