I. Device Description:
The VITEK® 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the
doubling dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration
(MIC). Each VITEK® 2 AST card contains 64 micro wells. A control well, which
contains only microbiological culture media, is present on all cards. The remaining wells
contain premeasured portions of specific antibiotics in a culture media base. The
bacterial isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with 0.45-0.5%
saline before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium in the wells in the card.
The VITEK® 2 System automatically fills seals and places the card into the
incubator/reader. With VITEK® 2 Compact the filling, sealing and loading of the card is
done manually. The VITEK® 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over
a defined period of time. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated
which includes the MIC value and the result interpretation for each antibiotic.
The VITEK® 2 AST Streptococcus Vancomycin has the following concentrations in the
card: 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 μg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in
μg/mL). The MIC result range for the VITEK® 2 cared is 0.125 – 8 μg/mL.

** Currently only a “Susceptible” category is defined for vancomycin. Isolates yielding results suggestive of
“nonsusceptible” should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.
† Interpretative criteria is applicable only to tests performed by broth microdilution method using cation-adjusted

ψThe FDA approved drug label designates this interpretive criteria only for “Streptococci other than S. pneumoniae”.

L. Test Principle:
The VITEK® 2 System optics use visible light to directly measure organism growth.
These transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before
significant growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same well
measure organism growth by how much light is prevented from going through the well.
An interpretive call is made between 4 and 16 hours for a “rapid” read by may be
extended to 18 hours in some instances. The VITEK® 2 Susceptibility Card test is based
on the microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration technique with concentrations
equivalent to standard method concentrations. Several parameters based on the growth
characteristics observed are used to provide appropriate input for the MIC calculations.
Discriminate analysis is used to develop the algorithm that determines the susceptibility
result for all antimicrobials on the VITEK® 2 System. The MIC result must be linked to
organism identification in order to determine a category interpretation. A category

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing was performed using 10 Streptococcal isolates at 3
study sites on 3 separate days, in triplicate. The study included both the auto-
dilution and manual dilution methods with the VITEK® 2 and the manual
dilution method with the VITEK® 2 Compact. All results were >95%
reproducible.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended quality control isolate, namely, S. pneumoniae ATCC
49619, was tested on every test occasion with the reference method and the
VITEK® 2, using both auto- and manual dilution methods.
All results fell within acceptable range which demonstrates that the VITEK®
2 can consistently produce quality control results in the recommended range
for Vancomycin.

Challenge study testing was conducted, at one external site using the VITEK®
2 Streptococcus Vancomycin AST card and the broth microdilution reference
method using Mueller-Hinton broth with lysed horse blood prepared as
recommended by the CLSI. A challenge set consisting of a total of 150
isolates, including 50 isolates of S. agalactiae, 50 isolates of S. pyogenes and
50 isolates of Viridans Group Streptococcus was used for the performance
testing. Testing of the challenge isolates was performed using both auto-
dilution and manual dilution method. As is illustrated in Tables A and B
below, there is very little difference in the device performance between the
two types of dilution methods.
Challenge testing of the VITEK®2 Streptococcus Vancomycin AST card in
combination with the VITEK®2 COMPACT instrument was also conducted
against the broth microdilution reference method, at one external site, using
the same challenge set of 150 isolates. Testing was performed using the
manual dilution method. The performance data is illustrated in Table C
below.
