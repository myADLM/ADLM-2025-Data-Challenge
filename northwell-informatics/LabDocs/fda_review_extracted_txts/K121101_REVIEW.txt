L. Test Principle:
Total Galactose is measured colorimetrically following the completion of two enzyme
assisted reactions and the color formation reaction. The first reaction entails conversion of
Galactose-1-Phosphate (Gal-1-P) to Galactose (Gal), catalyzed by alkaline phosphatase.
Alkaline Phosphatase → Gal-1-P Gal

In the second reaction, Gal is converted to galactonolactone through the galactose
dehydrogenase Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide redox pair (NAD+/NADH)-coupled
reaction.
Galactose Dehydrogenase → Gal + NAD+ galactonolactone + NADH
The NADH produced is proportional to the Gal concentration.
The final reaction, catalyzed by 1-methoxy PMS, employs a tetrazolium salt (MTT) and
produces a formazan dye that is measured colorimetrically.
1-methoxy PMS → NADH + MTT Colored Formazan + NAD+
The color developed is proportional to the Total Galactose concentration in the sample.
A standard curve prepared from a stock Galactose solution is used to quantitate the
results.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The within-run and total precision of the SPOTCHECK Neonatal Total
Galactose Microplate Reagent Kit was evaluated according to the CLSI
Guideline EP5-A2: Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative
Measurement Methods with modifications.
Evaluation of precision utilized samples that were prepared from whole blood,
with hematocrit adjusted to 55%, and spiked with analyte at three different
concentrations typical for “normal” (3 mg/mL), “near cutoff” (8 mg/dL) and
“galactosemic” (27 mg/dL). Samples were analyzed over five days, one run
per day, sixteen replicates of each sample per run.
To evaluate the imprecision due to multiple calibrations, two calibration curves
were used with each run and each curve was used to quantify half of the
replicates for each sample. This precision protocol was run using both the
manual and the automatic analyzers, and precision was evaluated separately
for each method.
Testing for the automated device was conducted using a single kit lot and one
operator, and testing for the manual device was conducted using two kit lots,
one instrument, and one operators. The results are summarized in the tables
below:

ST (total precision) 0.270 0.659 1.700
C.V. (total)(%) 8.2 6.5 5.1
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The claimed measuring range for the SPOTCHECK Neonatal Total Galactose
Microplate Reagent Kit is 1.4 to 50 mg/dL for both the manual and
SPOTCHECK Pro (i.e. automated) methods. This range is supported by the
linearity and detection limits studies.
Linearity studies were performed as recommended in CLSI Guideline EP6-A:
Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A
Statistical Approach.
One human whole blood specimen with hematocrit adjusted to 55% was spiked
with 50:50 mix of galactose/galactose-1-phosphate to provide 18 concentrations
at equally spaced intervals. Four replicates at each level were analyzed in a
single run using both manual and SPOTCHECK Pro processing.
To evaluate the data for linearity, first, second and third order regressions
were performed to determine if any non-linear terms were significantly
different from zero. Significance of the non-linear terms is determined
through a t-test per CLSI EP6-A.
Fitted regression models for Manual method are:
Linear: y = 0.955x – 0.318
Second order: y = 0.00x2 + 0.959x – 0.362
Third order: y = 0.00x3 – 0.003x2 +1.033x – 0.800

--- Page 7 ---
Fitted regression models for SPOTCHECK Pro method are:
Linear: y = 1.014x – 0.710
Second order: y = 0.00x2 + 1.019x – 0.768
Third order: y = 0.00x3 - 0.001x2 +1.036x – 0.871
The t-test results for the non-linear terms of the second (b2) and third (b3) order
regression analysis indicate that non-linear terms are not significant for both
manual and SPOTCHECK Pro processing. Because there are no significant
non-linear terms and the goal for repeatability has been met, the system is
judged to be linear in the range of the LoQ to the high calibrant (1.4 to 50
mg/dL for manual and 1.4 to 50 mg/dL for SPOTCHECK Pro).
The package insert states that values below 1.4 mg/dL and above 50 mg/dL should be
reported as <1.4 mg/dL or > 50 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The kit calibrators are traceable to a purchased certified reference galactose
material. Each primary stock solution and new calibrator lot is tested and
compared to the reference standard stock solution, and acceptability of less than
2% difference of each new lot when compared to the standard stock solution is
required for lot release.
Real-time stability including shelf-life, transport, and in-use stability studies
for the entire kit are performed, including the calibrators. Additionally,
accelerated stability studies are also performed separately for the entire kit
(including calibrators). The study protocols and statistically calculated
acceptance limits were reviewed and found to be acceptable. Stability
claims include 2 years storage unopened at 2 - 8ºC, and 28 days stored after
reconstitution at 2 - 8ºC.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of the Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) Limit of
Quantitation (LoQ) studies for the SPOTCHECK Neonatal Total
Galactose Microplate Reagent Kit were conducted using CLSI
Guideline EP 17-A: Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection
and Limits of Quantitation.
Limit of the Blank was calculated for a total of 60 measurements of a
blank control (blank filter paper punch). The LoB was determined
separately on the manual TGAL operation and the SPOTCHECK Pro.
The LoB was estimated to be:
1.1 mg/dL (manual)
0.9 mg/dL (SPOTCHECK PRO)
7

--- Page 8 ---
The Limit of Detection (LoD) and the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) were
determined from low concentration (normal) samples prepared to simulate
neonatal blood and spotted on filter paper and one kit lot, analyzed 30 times per
plate on 2 separate plates for a total of 60 observations on each of 3 samples for
both manual and SPOTCHECK Pro processing. Prior to spotting, human serum
and human red blood cells are combined to approximate a representative
neonate hematocrit of 55%. To establish the LoQ, since an estimate of bias is
not assured, the following goal for Total Error (TE) was used: “imprecision at
any concentration greater than or equal to the LoQ shall not exceed 20%”. The
LoD was estimated to be:
1.4 mg/dL (manual)
1.3 mg/dL (SPOTCHECK Pro)
Since the TE was less than the LoD, LoQ = LoD. Therefore the LoQ was
estimated to be:
1.4 mg/dL (manual)
1.3 mg/dL (SPOTCHECK Pro)
However, the LoD for the kit was conservatively set as 1.4 mg/dL for
both methods.
e. Analytical specificity:
Potential interference from several compounds was tested according to CLSI
EP07-A2. Two levels of potential interferent and three levels of total galactose
(i.e., normal, near cut-off, galactosemic) were evaluated. All samples were
analyzed in a single run with 8 replicates from each control and test sample set.
Significant interference was defined as a percent difference from the control
sample of >10%. The tested compounds are listed in the following table:
Potential Interferent Highest tested concentration
Albumin 6000 mg/dL
Ascorbate 6 mg/dL
Conjugated Bilirubin 20 mg/dL
Fructose 25 mg/dL
g-Globulin 6000 mg/dL
Glucose 1200 mg/dL
Glutathione 60 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 200 mg/dL
Mannose 5 mg/dL
Sulfamethoxazole 4 mg/dL
Triglycerides 3264 mg/dL
Trimethoprim 4 mg/dL
Unconjugated bilirubin 20 mg/dL

Mannose	5 mg/dL
Sulfamethoxazole	4 mg/dL
Triglycerides	3264 mg/dL
Trimethoprim	4 mg/dL
Unconjugated bilirubin	20 mg/dL

--- Page 9 ---
The results, as summarized in the package insert, are:
“The following substances were tested and no evidence of interference found:
conjugated bilirubin up to 20 mg/dL, unconjugated bilirubin up to 20 mg/dL,
protein (albumin and gammaglobulin) up to 6000 mg/dL, hemoglobin up to
200 mg/dL, sulfamethoxazole up to 4 mg/dL, ascorbate up to 6 mg/dL,
glucose up to 1200 mg/dL, mannose up to 5 mg/dL. There is evidence that
lipemia with lipid concentrations of 3264 mg/dL, fructose concentrations of
25 mg/dL, glutathione concentrations of 60 mg/dL, or trimethoprim
concentrations of 4 mg/dL may increase assay response slightly at low
(normal) levels of total galactose, but that effect was not seen at a
concentration near the projected cutoff or at elevated concentrations for any of
the potential interferents, and is of no clinical significance.”

† One sample that was GALT deficient but had normal total galactose screening
during the initial screening performed in the laboratory was screen negative with
both the predicate and with the SPOTCHECK TGAL Pro (automated).

† Two samples that were GALT deficient but had normal total galactose
screening during the initial screening performed in the laboratory were screen
negative with both the predicate and with the SPOTCHECK TGAL Pro
(automated).
ª There were two discrepant samples when measurements obtained with the
proposed assay were compared to the predicate measurements. However, these
samples were originally classified as screen negative sample therefore of the 180
samples tested in the supplemental study; two are false positives when the 99.5th
percentile is applied.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The summary of the results from the 2037 newborn specimens and 51
manufactured blood spot specimens tested with this kit is shown in the table
below:
SPOTCHECK SPOTCHECK Pro
Manual Automated
99.5th percentile 8.5 mg/dL 8.9 mg/dL
The package insert includes precautionary language that each laboratory should
establish their own reference range and cut-off values and that cut-offs from
another galactose screening test should not be used. Also included in the labeling
is the recommendation that screening presumptive positive samples be tested
with a confirmatory diagnostic method and to follow local requirements for
follow up testing.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
