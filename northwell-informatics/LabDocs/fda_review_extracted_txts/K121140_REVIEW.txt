H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The PROLYTE Electrolyte Analyzer Na+/K+/Cl-/Li+ is an automated, microprocessor-
controlled analyzer which utilizes ion-selective electrodes for the measurement of
sodium, potassium, chloride and lithium in whole blood, plasma, and serum. Sodium,
potassium, and chloride can be measured in urine samples.
The PROLYTE Sodium Assay is intended to measure sodium in whole blood, plasma,
serum, and urine on the PROLYTE Electrolyte Analyzer Na+/K+/Cl-/Li+. Measurements
obtained by this device are used to monitor electrolyte balance in the diagnosis and
treatment of aldosteronism (excessive secretion of the hormone aldosterone), diabetes
insipidus (chronic excretion of large amounts of dilute urine, accompanied by extreme
thirst), adrenal hypertension, Addison's disease (caused by destruction of the adrenal
glands), dehydration, inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, or other diseases
involving electrolyte imbalance.
The PROLYTE Potassium Assay is intended to measure potassium in whole blood,
plasma, serum, and urine on the PROLYTE Electrolyte Analyzer Na+/K+/Cl-/Li+.
Measurements obtained by this device are used to monitor electrolyte balance in the
diagnosis and treatment of disease conditions characterized by low or high blood
potassium levels.
The PROLYTE Chloride Assay is intended to measure the level of chloride in whole
blood, plasma, serum, and urine on the PROLYTE Electrolyte Analyzer Na+/K+/Cl-/Li+.

--- Page 3 ---
Chloride measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of electrolyte and
metabolic disorders such as cystic fibrosis and diabetic acidosis.
The PROLYTE Lithium test system is intended to measure lithium (from the drug
lithium carbonate) in whole blood, plasma, or serum on the PROLYTE Electrolyte
Analyzer Na+/K+/Cl-/Li+. Measurements of lithium are used to assure that the proper drug
dose is administered in the treatment of patients with mental disturbances, such as manic-
depressive illness (bipolar disorder).
For In Vitro Diagnostic Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
PROLYTE Electrolyte Analyzer Na+/K+/Cl-/Li+
I. Device Description:
The PROLYTE Electrolyte Analyzer Na+/K+/Cl-/Li+ has all the features of the PROLYTE
Electrolyte Analyzer (Na+/K+/Cl-)(k102959), with the added feature that the Cl- ISE sensor
may be replaced by a Li+ ISE sensor by the end user. The instrument software was upgraded
to accommodate the addition of the Li+ assay.
The PROLYTE Electrolyte Analyzer Na+/K+/Cl-/Li+ uses the previously cleared Diamond
Diagnostic Fluid Pack (k031159) which contains the two levels of calibrants (Standard A
800 mL, Standard B 180 mL) required for calibration for each ion in a sealed package with a
flush solution (80 mL) and a waste container. The analyzer can be programmed to self-
calibrate at set intervals or on request. Mission Controls (k033063) are the recommended
quality control material to be used daily.

L. Test Principle:
The principles of measurement used in the PROLYTE Electrolyte Analyzer Na+/K+/Cl-/Li+
are identical to those principles existing in the Predicate GemLyte Electrolyte Analyzer
(Na+/K+/Cl- /Ca2+/Li+).
The PROLYTE Electrolyte Analyzer measures sodium, potassium, chloride in whole blood,
serum, plasma, and urine, and lithium in whole blood, serum and plasma using ion selective
electrode technology. The sodium electrode contains a glass tube, specially formulated to be
sensitive to sodium ions. The potassium and lithium electrodes incorporate a neutral carrier
ionophore membrane. The chloride contains an ionophore covalently bound to a substrate
which is sensitive to negatively charged ions. The potential of each electrode is measured
relative to a fixed, stable reference established by a silver/silver chloride electrode in
concentrated salt solution. The measured potential varies with the concentration of the ion
sensed by the electrode.

The analytical performance of Na+/K+/Cl- in whole blood, serum, plasma, and urine
was evaluated in the previously cleared 510(k) (k102959). Analytical performance of
Li+ is presented below. Sodium Heparin was the anticoagulant used in the preparation of
plasma and whole blood samples.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Five whole blood, serum, and plasma samples were analyzed with Li+ concentrations
at the low, near mid point, and high end of the reference ranges, and at the low and
high end of the reporting limits.
Within run precision was calculated with results from 30 replicates of each sample
without calibration between measurements. The replicates were run consecutively in
one day. Total precision was evaluated by measuring the same set of samples in
duplicate twice a day for ten consecutive days resulting in 40 replicates. Whole blood
total precision was conducted with calibrations after each 10 replicates on a single
day due to instability of the whole blood samples. The results are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated by preparing stock solutions with high concentrations of Li+
in whole blood, plasma, and serum. These stock solutions were diluted serially (20%)
to obtain concentrations across the measuring range for each matrix. Linear
regression was performed and the results are shown below to support the claimed
reportable range of 0.15-5.0 mEq/L.

Whole Blood 0.9854 0.0285 0.9979 0.15-5.5

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrators intended to be used with this device were previously cleared under
k031159.
d. Detection limit:
Reportable ranges were determined based on the linearity studies (see above).
e. Analytical specificity:
Plasma samples were prepared with high and low concentrations of Lithium (0.4 and
1.3 mEq/L). Clinically significant interferents were spiked into the lithium samples at
the indicated concentrations shown in the below table. Each spiked sample and the
control were measured in 20 replicates and the mean results were compared. The
below table shows the change in sample results (spiked versus control) in mEq/L
when the interferent is tested at the indicated concentrations. The change in sample
results (spiked versus control) for all tested interferents was 5 % or less.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparisons to predicate device GemLyte Li+ (k082462) were performed
with whole blood, plasma, and serum patient samples using Na heparin as the anti-
coagulant for whole blood and plasma. A small number of samples were spiked or
diluted (<10%) to fully span the claimed measuring ranges. The results are
summarized below:
Slope Intercept R2 N Conc. Tested (mEq/L)
Whole Blood 1.0096 0.0719 0.9947 94 0.15-5.0
Plasma 0.9806 0.1292 0.9971 100 0.16-5.0
Serum 0.9977 0.0133 0.9881 91 0.17-4.7
b. Matrix comparison:
Assay performance in all claimed matrices (serum, sodium heparin plasma, whole
blood) is addressed in the method comparison studies described above. Na heparin is
the only indicated anticoagulant for whole blood and plasma. The sponsor states in
the labeling that lithium heparin tubes should not be used for lithium measurements.
