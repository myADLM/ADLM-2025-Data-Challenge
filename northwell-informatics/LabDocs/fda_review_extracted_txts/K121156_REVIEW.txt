Immunoglobulin E (IgE) 510(k)s; Final Guidance for Industry and FDA
L. Test Principle:
The allergen of interest, covalently coupled to the ImmunoCAP solid phase, reacts with the
specific IgE in the patient sample. After washing away non specific IgE, enzyme-labeled
antibodies against IgE are added to form a complex. After incubation, unbound enzyme-anti-
IgE is washed away and the bound complex is then incubated with the developing agent.
After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence of the eluate is measured. The higher the
response value, the more specific IgE present in the specimen. To evaluate the rest results,
the response for the patient samples are transformed to concentrations with the use of a
calibration curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/ Reproducibility:
i) Within-Lot imprecision:
Imprecision of the individual allergen components was evaluated by using two
positive plasma samples including a low range sample (0.35 ± 25%) and a high
range sample (≥0.7 kU /L), each tested in 4 replicates in 1 assay run per day for a
A
total of 20 operating days (a total of 80 replicates per sample). The assay was
performed according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Directions for Use using
Phadia 250. Between-day and within-run coefficients of variance (%CV) were
calculated for each component and each sample separately.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the four individual allergens was assessed following the CLSI
I/LA20-A2 guidelines. For each allergen component, three positive plasma samples
were each diluted in negative plasma generating at least five 2-fold consecutive
dilutions. Undiluted and diluted samples were tested in four replicates in one assay
run. The assay was performed according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE, Directions
for Use using instrument Phadia 250. For each product one lot of ImmunoCAP
Allergen Component was used. ImmunoCAP Specific Total IgE working range is
LoD to100 kU /L.

by an on-going real time stability study and accelerated stability study. For real-
time stability study, three lots of ImmunoCAP Allergen Component were stored
at recommended storage temperature 2-8°C. Two positive plasma samples and
one negative plasma sample were tested at different occasions according to the
ImmunoCAP Specific IgE, Directions for Use, using Phadia 250. The study is
ongoing. For accelerated study, three lots of ImmunoCAP Allergen Components
were stored at 30°C and tested after 4 and 8 weeks using two positive plasma
samples and one negative plasma sample. The same lots stored at 2-8°C were
used as reference. The results support the manufacture’s claim of 24 months.
The stability of the calibration curve, real time, and on-board stability of
ImmunoCAP Specific IgE calibrator are detailed in k100999.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) and the Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined for each
allergen component on the Phadia 250 in alignment with CLSI EP17-A. The LoB
was based on single determinations of 100 negative samples (blank samples) and was
estimated as the 95% percentile of the distribution. LoD was calculated according to
the equation: LoD = LoB + c ´SD where SD, the standard deviation, was based on
b

The allergen solution was serially diluted with buffer to show an overall dose
dependent inhibition. The unrelated allergen solutions are not further diluted. Equal
volumes of a positive sample and varying dilutions of allergen solution (inhibitor)
were premixed. The mixture was incubated in a sample tube at room temperature for
1 hour before being analyzed with the corresponding ImmunoCAP Allergen
Component on ImmunoCAP instrument according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The testing was performed in duplicates in one assay run. Mean values were
calculated.
The inhibition test was evaluated with inhibition values in %, calculated according to
the formula below:
æ ær-böö

è èt-bøø
r = response [RU]
b = background response (100% inhibition) [RU]
t = total response (0% inhibition) [RU]
i = inhibition
Any negative inhibition %-values are shown as 0% inhibition.
The results of the inhibition with the allergen solution and the unrelated inhibitors
indicate that the 4 new allergens contain the immunologically relevant allergen as
shown below:
ImmunoCAP Allergen f236, Allergen Component Cow´s milk whey
The Cow´s milk whey allergen Inhibition study showed that ³ 50% inhibition was
achieved with the related inhibitor (Cow´s milk whey allergen) at a final inhibitor
concentration of 480 ng/mL. The inhibition studies using four unrelated inhibitors,
including three from unrelated groups (m36, e85, w204) and one from the
related/same group (f83) did not show any significant inhibition at the highest
inhibitor concentration of 1.4 mg/mL. The inhibition studies indicate that the
ImmunoCAP Allergen f236, Cow´s milk whey solid phase contains the
immunologically relevant allergen.
ImmunoCAP Allergen f309, Allergen Component Chick pea
The Chick pea allergen Inhibition study showed that about 50% inhibition was
achieved with the related inhibitor (Chick pea allergen) at a final inhibitor
concentration of ~0.31 mg/mL. The inhibition studies using four unrelated inhibitors,
including three from unrelated groups (m36, g6, d201) and one from the related/same
group (f83) did not show any significant inhibition at the highest inhibitor
concentration of 4.0 mg/mL. The inhibition studies indicate that the ImmunoCAP
Allergen f309, Chick pea solid phase contains the immunologically relevant allergen.
ImmunoCAP Allergen t212, Allergen Component Cedar
The Cedar allergen Inhibition study showed that about 50 % inhibition was achieved
with the related inhibitor (Cedar allergen) at a final inhibitor concentration of ~27
μg/mL. The inhibition studies using three unrelated inhibitors from unrelated groups
(m36, w204, g6) did not show any significant inhibition at the highest inhibitor
8

--- Page 9 ---
concentration of 4.0 μg/mL. An unrelated allergen f222, Cupressus arizonica did
show significant inhibition (>15%) at a final concentration of 2.7 mg/mL. In
contrast, another unrelated allergen t3, birch from the related/same group did not
show any significant inhibition at a final concentration of 2.7 mg/mL.
ImmunoCAP Allergen t222, Allergen Component Cupressus arizonica
The Cupressus arizonica allergen Inhibition study showed that about 50% inhibition
was achieved at a final inhibitor concentration of ~ 8.7 μg/mL. The inhibition studies
using three unrelated inhibitors from unrelated groups (m36, d74, w204) did not show
any significant inhibition at the highest inhibitor concentration of 4.0 mg/mL. An
unrelated allergen t212, Cedar from the related/same group did show significant
inhibition (>15%) at a final concentration of 2.7 mg/mL. In contrast, another
unrelated allergen t3, birch from the related/same group did not show any significant
inhibition at a final concentration of 0.87 mg/mL.
ii) Interference:
a) Endogenous Substance Interference:
In order to show that icteric, hemolytic or lipemic samples do not adversely
affects the results in ImmunoCAP Specific IgE assay using representative
allergens, Bilirubin C [final concentration (fc) 20 mg/dL], Bilirubin F (fc 19
mg/dL), Hemoglobin (fc 489 mg/dL) and Chyle (fc 1,440 Formazine
Turbidity Units) were spiked into 2 samples per allergen. The allergens tested
were e228 rFel d 4 Cat, f351 rPen a 1 Tropomyosin Shrimp, f354 rBer e 1
Brazil nut, f420 rPru p 3 LTP Peach and w231 nArt v 1 Mugwort. The design
of the studies was in general alignment with CLSI EP7-A2 Guideline. The
results demonstrate that icteric, hemolytic or lipemic samples do not adversely
affects the results in ImmunoCAP Specific IgE.
b) Exogenous Substance Interference:
Two literature references were provided supporting that commonly prescribed
"allergy medications" do not interfere with ImmunoCAP Specific IgE. The
references included (i) Robert G. Hamilton, Accuracy of US Food and Drug
Administration-cleared IgE antibody assays in the presence of anti-IgE
(omalizumab), J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2006; 759-766, and (ii) Linda Cox et
al., Pearls and pitfalls of allergy diagnostic testing: report from the American
College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology/American Academy of Allergy,
Asthma and Immunology Specific IgE Test Task Force, Annals of Allergy,
Asthma & Immunology, 2008; 101:580-592.
f. Assay cut-off:
Limit of Quantitation for ImmunoCAP Specific IgE is 0.1 kUA/L. All results >0.1
kUA/L are interpreted as being analytically positive.

The "Proof of Principle" study that different matrix samples (heparin plasma, EDTA
plasma and serum) are interchangeable for ImmunoCAP Allergen Components was
provided in k101251. Serum, sodium heparin plasma, and EDTA plasma samples
were collected from four patients with clinical history of known specific allergies and
four nonatopic patients. The samples contained specific IgE antibodies for one or
more of the allergen components tested. ·All sample matrices (heparin plasma, EDTA
plasma and serum) from each patient were tested with ImmunoCAP Allergen
Components in 2 replicates in one assay run. Mean concentration values for each
sample matrix were calculated. Mean logarithmic ratios for 17 results were -0.022
(Plasma heparin/Serum) and 0.054 (Plasma EDTA/Serum). The results from the
study show that samples of different matrices (heparin plasma, EDTA plasma and
serum) are interchangeable for ImmunoCAP Allergen Components.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
The performance of all 4 individual allergen components was compared to a clinical
diagnosis of allergy. The objectives of this study were (i) to show the linkage
between specific IgE antibodies to ImmunoCAP Allergen Component and the
corresponding extract based ImmunoCAP Allergen, using clinical samples, and (ii) to
demonstrate that samples from healthy, non-atopic donors with no reported clinical
reaction to the allergen have undetectable or very low levels of specific IgE to the
individual ImmunoCAP Allergen Component. At least 30 clinical serum samples
from individuals with a clinical history of allergy-like symptoms upon exposure to the
allergen, as diagnosed by a physician were used in the study. Information about
clinical symptoms and manifestations was available for all clinical samples. 100
negative samples (<0.35 kU /L) from healthy non-atopic donors with no reported
A
clinical reaction to the allergen were also tested.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected value is negative (< 0.35 kU /L) for a specific allergen in a non-allergic
A
person. The manufacturer recommends a cut-off of 0.35 kU /L. Each laboratory should
A
establish its own expected range of values.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
