I. Device Description:
The Access AccuTnI+3 Reagent packs contain:
· Paramagnetic particles coated with mouse monoclonal anti-human cardiac
troponin I suspended in TRIS buffered saline, with surfactant, bovine serum
albumin (BSA) matrix, <0.1% sodium azide, and 0.1% ProClin 300
· 0.1N NaOH
· TRIS buffered saline, surfactant, <0.1% sodium azide and 0.1% ProClin 300
· Mouse monoclonal anti-human cTnI alkaline phosphatase conjugate diluted in
ACES buffered saline, with surfactant, BSA matrix, protein (bovine, goat,
mouse), <0.1% sodium azide, and 0.25% ProClin 300
The Access AccuTnI+3 Calibrators contain multi-point calibrators for use with the
Access AccuTnI+3 Reagent. Individual vials contain zero or approximately 0.3, 1.2,
5.0, 25 and 100 ng/mL (ng/L) of recombinant cardiac troponin I complex,
respectively, in a buffered BSA matrix, with surfactant, <0.1% sodium azide, and
0.1% ProClin 300. The calibrators are sold separately.
The Access 2 Immunoassay System is a microcomputer controlled, random-access
and continuous-access instrument. The instrument performs enzyme immunoassays
utilizing paramagnetic particle solid phase and chemiluminescent detection. A
luminometer measures the amount of light generated by the reaction. The Access 2 is
designed to be used with numerous different immunoassays. The system software
was designed such that immunoassays can be added to the system without changing
the system software. A separate assay-specific protocol file, the APF, is loaded into
2

--- Page 3 ---
the system. The APF contains all assay specific parameters used to process a
particular assay.
To correct thermal sensitivity from ambient temperature fluctuations that could affect
the accuracy of troponin test results, the sponsor developed a software algorithm that
normalizes troponin results. This solution was implemented through a combination
of system and operating software changes.

L. Test Principle:
The Access AccuTnI+3 Reagent is a two-site immunoenzymatic (“sandwich”) assay.
Monoclonal anti-cTnI antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase is added to a
reaction vessel along with a surfactant-containing buffer and sample. After a short
incubation, paramagnetic particles coated with monoclonal anti-cTnI antibody are
added. The human cTnI binds to the anti-cTnI antibody on the solid phase, while the
anti-cTnI antibody - alkaline phosphatase conjugate reacts with different antigenic
sites on the cTnI molecules. After incubation in a reaction vessel, materials bound to
the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed
away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate Lumi-Phos* 530 is added to the vessel
and light generated by the reaction is measured. The light production is directly
proportional to the concentration of cTnI in the sample. The amount of analyte in the
sample is determined from a stored, multi-point calibration curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor evaluated precision in several studies based on CLSI EP5-A2.
The first 3 studies were conducted at one of 3 ambient temperature conditions.
The studies performed at 18°C and 28°C were performed internally. A low
spiked patient pool (lp), 3 commercial controls (c), and one high patient pool
(hp), were assayed in replicates of 2, 2 shifts per day, 2 runs per shift, for a
total of 21 shifts (42 runs) over 13 days. These studies were performed on 1
instrument and 1 reagent lot.
The third study was performed externally under existing laboratory conditions
(measured temperatures ranged from 20ºC to 24ºC). Six commercial controls
(ranging from 0.02 ng/mL to 15 ng/mL) were run in duplicate, 2 runs per day
for 20 days for a total of 40 runs. This study was performed on 1 reagent lot
and 1 instrument.
The fourth study was a confirmation study that was run across multiple
ambient temperatures ranging from 18ºC to 28ºC. The sponsor used a low
spiked patient pool, 3 commercial controls, and one high patient pool. These
samples were tested in duplicate in 2 runs per shift, 2 shifts per day, over 14
days. One reagent lot and on one instrument was used in this study.
The following data are representative of the results from the precision studies
and are presented in the labeling:

The sponsor also determined the precision of the device using 3 low-level
natural patient sample pools, 2 instrument, 2 reagent lots, multiple ambient
temperatures ranging from 18ºC to 28ºC and multiple calibration cycles over
14 days. The samples were assayed in replicates of 2 per run, 2 runs per shift
and 2 shifts per day. The results of the study are summarized below:

Field precision studies: The sponsor performed a precision studies in-house
to simulate the use of the device by the end user. This study was designed to
incorporate different sources of variability that may be found in the field
including: the simultaneous running of other assays; variability in test request
type (e.g., panel, reflex, stat, and individual testing); variability of ambient
temperatures; and variability of instrument age. The sponsor used quality
control material for the study, 3 instruments and 1 lot of reagent. The sponsor
cycled the temperature of the laboratory from 18 to 28 ºC over the course of 6
hours over 3 days of testing. The samples were assayed in a minimum of 44
replicates on each instrument across the 3 days of testing. The results of this
study are summarized below:

cardiac troponin I analyte. The sponsor evaluated linearity using 9 pools of
varying analyte concentration that spanned the reportable range of the assay.
A total of 8 replicates of each high and each low sample were analyzed and 4
replicates of each intermediate mixture of high and low were analyzed with
each reagent lot and instrument at each temperature. A total of 12
independent analyses were performed. The polynomial fit was significant for
all analyses but the maximum deviation from nonlinearity was 14%. The
sponsor claims acceptable linearity from 0.003 to 106.04 ng/mL.
High Dose Hook Effect: The sponsor demonstrated that there was no high
dose hook effect from the concentration of the S5 calibrator (»100 ng/mL) to
2,529 ng/mL.
The reportable range of the device is 0.02 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Access AccuTnI+3 Calibrators are standardized to an internal standard.
They are identical to the previously cleared (k010429) Access AccuTnI
Calibrators.
Calibrators are value assigned using primary reference curves and verified
using quality control material and patient samples that must meet
specifications. The value assignment process was reviewed and found to be
acceptable.
Calibrator stability: The calibrators are stable for 12 months when stored
unopened at -20°C. Once opened, the calibrators are stable for 60 days when
stores at 2 to 8°C. The calibrator stability protocols were reviewed and found
to be acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation
(LoQ) studies were performed following the recommendations in EP17-A2.
Testing was performed over 3 days using 2 reagent lots, 3 instruments, 3
calibration cycles with 3 different temperature conditions (from 18 to 28 ºC).
To estimate the LoB, 4 blank samples were measured in replicates of 10 on
each day of testing on each instrument/reagent lot combination at the different
temperature conditions. The LoB was established to be 0.003 ng/mL. The
sponsor claims that the LoB is <0.01 ng/mL.
To estimate the LoD, 6 native lithium heparin plasma samples containing low
levels of troponin I analyte were measured in 2 runs of 10 replicates each
during each day of testing on each instrument/reagent lot combination at the
different temperature conditions. The sponsor claims an LoD of 0.01 ng/mL.
8

--- Page 9 ---
To estimate the LoQ, 11 native lithium heparin plasma samples containing
low levels of troponin I analyte were measured on each instrument/reagent lot
combination at the different temperature conditions.
The sponsor claims an LoQ of 0.02 ng/mL with a performance goal of < 20%
CV (within-lab). The lowest concentration with a % CV (within-lab) < 10%
was estimated to be 0.04 ng/mL.
The sponsor provided data demonstrating that the LoQ of the device using
serum samples at 3 different temperature conditions (from 18 to 28 ºC) is
identical to the LoQ of the device using lithium heparin plasma samples.
The reportable range of the device is 0.02 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Two levels of potential interfering substances were added to lithium heparin
plasma pools containing either 0.05 or 0.5 ng/mL troponin at 3 different
temperature conditions (from 18 to 28 ºC). For the controls, the
corresponding solvent was added to the lithium heparin plasma pools
containing either 0.05 or 0.5 ng/mL troponin. Control troponin samples
(control sample) and samples spiked with the potential interferents (test
sample) were tested in replicates of 5 (for the 0.5 ng/mL samples) or 10 (for
the 0.05 ng/mL samples) and compared. The sponsor used 1 reagent lot and 6
instruments for this study. The sponsor concluded that the following
substances at the listed concentrations did not interfere with the performance
of the device.

To evaluate cross reactivity, the substances shown in the following table were
added to lithium heparin plasma pools containing 2 levels of troponin (≤ 0.02
ng/mL and approximately 0.5 ng/mL). Control and test samples were tested
on 6 instruments and 2 reagent lots at 3 temperature conditions (from 18 to 28
ºC) in replicates of 10 for the low troponin samples (<0.02 ng/mL) and
replicates of 5 for the high troponin samples (0.05 ng/mL). For each possible
cross-reactant tested, the troponin I concentration (ng/mL) obtained for the
spiked sample was compared to the troponin I concentration obtained with the
control sample and applied to the following formula: % cross reactivity =
[(mean dose of spiked – mean dose of control)/amount of cross reactant
spiked] X 100. The sponsor concluded that the following proteins at the
concentration listed did not cross react (defined as < 1% cross reactivity) with
the device.

HAMA/Heterophile antibodies: The sponsor provided results demonstrating
that their formulation reduces the effects of HAMA interferents. They include
the following in the Limitations of the Procedure section of the Instructions
for Use:
“For assays employing antibodies, the possibility exists for interference by
heterophile antibodies in the patient sample. Patients who have been regularly
exposed to animals or have received immunotherapy or diagnostic procedures
utilizing immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin fragments may produce
antibodies, e.g. HAMA, that interfere with immunoassays. Additionally,
other heterophile antibodies such as human anti-goat antibodies may be
present in patient samples. Such interfering antibodies may cause erroneous
results. Carefully evaluate the results of patients suspected of having these
antibodies.”
f. Assay cut-off:
See section 4 “Clinical cut-off”
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison:

b. Matrix comparison:
The sponsor conducted a clinical matrix comparison study to compare
matched lithium heparin plasma samples and serum samples randomly
selected from among the entire pivotal trial cohort. Results of Passing-Bablok
regression analysis of singlicate results are provided below (the sponsor
excluded 26 samples with troponin levels below the LoQ from these
analyses):

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
A clinical study was performed to evaluate the clinical performance of the
device at the different cut-offs. A multicenter prospective study enrolled 1929
patients from Emergency Departments presenting with chest pain or
equivalent ischemic symptoms suggestive of Acute Coronary Syndromes.
Final diagnoses were adjudicated by an independent panel of expert
physicians using criteria consistent with the 2007 Universal Definition of
Myocardial Infarction. Serial samples were collected from patients within 9
hours of presentation to the ER. The sample collection times were at baseline,
1 to 3 hours, 3 to 6 hours and 6 to 9 hours after presentation to the ER.
Investigators and adjudicators were blinded to the proposed device’s results.
Adjudicators were also blinded to site diagnoses. All results presented below
were based on the adjudicated diagnoses. Testing was performed using
lithium heparin plasma samples. The results are summarized below:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor conducted a multicenter prospective study to establish the 99th
percentile upper reference limit in a population of apparently healthy adults with
no known diseases of the cardiovascular system or other serious acute or chronic
diseases or infections. Lithium heparin plasma samples were evaluated. 527
subjects were enrolled at seven geographically diverse locations. Both male and
female subjects were included in the reference range study to determine the 99th
percentile upper reference limit.
The 99th percentile upper reference limit was demonstrated to be 0.02 ng/mL
(95% CI: 0.01 to 0.05).

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Ambient temperature method comparison studies: The sponsor provided data from 4
studies to demonstrate the impact of ambient temperature differences on the test
result. Three of these studies focused on troponin concentrations around the cut-offs
(0.02 to 0.4 ng/mL for study 1; 0.02 to 0.6 ng/mL for studies 2 and 3). Study 4
evaluated the full reportable range (FR) of the device (0.03 to 94 ng/mL) and
regression analysis of low dose (LD) samples with troponin concentrations around the
cut-off (0.03 to 0.4 ng/mL) was also performed. In total, 751 lithium heparin plasma
samples were tested at different temperature conditions (ranging from 18 to 28ºC) on
multiple instruments using multiple reagent lots. Samples were divided into aliquots,
and tested at different temperature conditions. The sponsor performed Passing-
Bablok regression analyses of singlicate test results. The results of the 19 different
comparisons provided by the sponsor from the 4 different studies are summarized
below:
