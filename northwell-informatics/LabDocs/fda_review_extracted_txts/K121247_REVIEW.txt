2. Indication(s) for use:
ALCO-SCREEN® Saliva Alcohol Test is a semi-quantitative screening test used to
estimate the Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) using human saliva. The test strip
estimates BAC at the 0.00%, 0.02%, 0.04%, 0.08% and 0.3% levels. Results are used in
the diagnosis of alcohol use or intoxication.
For in vitro diagnostic use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Over the counter use
4. Special instrument requirements:
None – each device is single use and self-contained
I. Device Description:
ALCO-SCREEN Saliva Alcohol Test is a visually read semi-quantitative test for the
detection of alcohol in saliva. The test strip indicates the relative Blood Alcohol
Concentration (BAC) at 5 different cut-off levels (0.00%, 0.02%, 0.04%, 0.08% and 0.3%).
The device consists of a box of 24 individually packaged single test strips each designed for
single use,, and instructions for use. The resultant color on the test strip is compared to the
color blocks and BAC percentages printed on the test package.
The active reagents in the enzymatic solution include: alcohol oxidase enzyme from yeast,
peroxidase enzyme from horseradish, and tetramethylbenzidine.

L. Test Principle:
The ALCO-SCREEN® Saliva Alcohol Test consists of a plastic strip with a containing
alcohol oxidase on the tip. On contact with saliva a pair of coupled enzymatic reactions that
catalyze the oxidation of tetramethylbenzidine in the presence of short-chain, linear aliphatic
alcohols such as methanol or ethanol will take place. A semi-quantitative estimation of
blood alcohol concentration (BAC) can be made at 5 different cut-off levels (negative,
0.02%, 0.04%, 0.08% and 0.3%) by comparing the resultant color on the test strip to a color
chart printed on the foil package.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Device precision was evaluated by reading standards prepared by volumetric ethanol
addition to saliva to concentrations corresponding to 0, 0.002, 0.004, 0.008, 0.012,
0.016, 0.02, 0.04, 0.032, 0.064, 0.08, 0.120, 0.128 0.30 and 0.480 % ethanol. Three
lots of test strips were used, with 20 replicates from each lot read over 3 days. The
alcohol concentrations were confirmed with a commercially available enzymatic
NAD-ADH reagent kit. The strips were read by untrained volunteers (lay-users).
Samples were presented blindly from each of the fifteen saliva alcohol standards and
were randomly presented for testing. The results are presented in the tables below:

previously cleared enzymatic NAD-ADH Reagent kit. The control results from the
test strips are read visually by comparing to the color chart and then the color
intensity verified using a spectrophotometer.
The sponsor states the shelf-life of the device is 12 months. Shelf-life stability
protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and deemed acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
As part of the precision study, the sponsor analyzed 180 “zero” concentration samples
using three strip lots. No false positives were observed.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed studies to evaluate the effect of substances which may be
present in the saliva sample as well as a range of lighting and temperature conditions.
Substances that are consumed or used orally:
The sponsor evaluated the effect of cigarette smoke, chewing tobacco, mouthwash,
chewing gum, cough syrup and breath spray on the assay. For each potential
interferent, samples were collected from ten volunteers, of which five were drinkers
and five were non-drinkers. Results were read at 1 minute and 15 minutes after
consumption or use of the potential interferents. Samples were read by trained
technicians. There were no false positives or false negatives when samples were read
at 15 minutes after use or consumption of the potential interferent. False positives
were observed for cigarette smoke, chewing tobacco, and alcohol containing
mouthwash, breath spray and cough syrup when read at one minute. The labeling
specifies that users should not consume anything or have anything in the mouth for at
least fifteen minutes prior to use.
Volatile Substances:
The sponsor conducted a study to assess the potential for positive or negative
interference from volatile substances. The volatile substance was spiked into alcohol-
free saliva samples and samples with alcohol concentrations of 0.008, 0.016, 0.02,
0.04, 0.032, 0.064, 0.08, 0.120, 0.128 0.30 and 0.480 % BAC. No interference was
seen for acetone, 2-butanol, glycerol, isopropanol, or methanol at the concentrations
listed below.

Those substances and their concentrations are documented in the Package Insert.
Temperature:
The effect of temperature on the Alco-Screen® Saliva Alcohol Test was evaluated
using alcohol-free saliva from volunteers and control solutions prepared at
concentration levels of 0%, -60%, 100% and +60% of the 0.02%, 0.04%, 0.08% and
0.3% BAC tested at 2 different temperature conditions: 10 and 40°C. The
concentration of the alcohol in the prepared solution was confirmed using an
enzymatic NAD-ADH reagent supplied by Pointe Scientific. All samples and test
strips were placed at different temperatures and allowed to equilibrate for 2 hours
prior to testing. The test pad of each strip was saturated with each sample and allowed
to stand for 2 minutes prior to reading the result. A total of 20 replicates were tested
for each sample at each temperature.
There was no additional variability due to the different temperatures tested. The
labeling instructs the user to bring all test items to room temperature before use.
Lighting:
The effect of lighting on the device was evaluated by reading known spiked alcohol
concentrations in daylight, under fluorescent, incandescent, sodium vapor and
mercury vapor lighting. The study used three lots of strips. Twenty replicates were
tested for each of the standards (0%, 0.008, 0.016, 0.020, 0.032, 0.04%, 0.064, 0.08,
0.0120, 0.128, 0.300 and 0.480% BAC) under each of five different lighting
conditions using the standard test procedure. The strips were read by trained
technicians. There were no deviations from the expected results using daylight, under
fluorescent and incandescent lighting. When Alco-Screen® was evaluated under
mercury vapor lighting some interpretation variation was found, but the results were
within one color block of the actual sample concentration. Under the sodium vapor
lighting for the negative and 0.008% sample, the undeveloped reactive chemical
stripe was more evident as noted by the trained technician. In the hands of an
untrained user, this may be erroneously identified as a positive signal. The labeling
for the Alco-Screen instructs the user not to read the test results under mercury or
sodium vapor light. The labeling also states that the test should not be interpreted by
persons who are color-blind or visually impaired.
f. Assay cut-off:
Each device provides cutoffs at 0.02%, 0.04%, 0.08%, and 0.30% BAC.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor conducted a consumer study comparing the Alco-Screen device to
results from the Alco-Sensor IV (Intoximeters Inc.) which is an alcohol breath test

which is listed on the NHTSA/DOT Conforming Products List for Evidential Breath
Testing Devices. The study was performed at 3 sites. After reading the package
insert forty two volunteers, designated as the testing volunteers performed the Alco-
Screen test on forty three participants (32 drinkers and 11 non-alcohol drinkers).
Results were interpreted by the testing volunteers (lay user). The trained facilitators
also performed the breath alcohol test on the participants using the Alco-Sensor IV.
The studies were performed with a total of 210 test strips used for the study. Results
obtained by the lay-user compared to Alco-Sensor IV are provided below:

The effect of various reading times on the Alco-Screen Saliva Alcohol Test were
evaluated using negative saliva samples and saliva spiked with control solutions to
obtain alcohol concentrations at the cut off and at +/-60% of the cut off for each of
the color blocks. The test pad for each strip was saturated with sample and read at 2
and 2 ½ minutes. A total of 20 replicates were tested for each read time for each
sample.

The results support the suggested read time of 2 minutes. The labeling states that the
test results must be interpreted 2 minutes after sample application, and no longer than
2 ½ minutes after sample application.

Using these types of devices, alcohol is not detectable in the saliva of persons who have
not ingested alcohol.

The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
