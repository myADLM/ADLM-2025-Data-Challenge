I. Device Description:
ALCO-SCREEN® 02 is a visually read qualitative test for the detection of alcohol using
saliva. It consists of a visually interpreted test strip that develops a distinctly colored line
across the test pad when wetted with human saliva with a BAC of greater than or equal to
0.02%. The test strip indicates the relative Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) at 0.02% or
greater. The device consists of a box of 24 individually packaged single test strips each
designed for single use and to be disposable, and instruction for use.
The active reagents in the enzymatic solution include: alcohol oxidase enzyme from yeast,
peroxidase enzyme from horseradish and tetramethylbenzidine.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None were referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The Alco-Screen® 02 test consists of a plastic strip containing alcohol oxidase on the tip. On
contact with saliva a pair of coupled enzymatic reactions that catalyze the oxidation of
tetramethylbenzidine in the presence of short-chain, linear aliphatic alcohols such as
methanol or ethanol will take place. Samples containing a BAC greater than or equal to
0.02% will develop a distinctly colored line across the reagent pad after an incubation time of
4 minutes. The absence of a distinctly colored line after incubating with saliva for 4 minutes
indicates a negative result i.e. a BAC less than 0.02%.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
1. Intra-assay precision around the cutoff
The imprecision of the device was evaluated by reading known spiked
alcohol concentrations (0%, 0.008%, 0.02% and 0.032%) on three lots
of strips, with 20 replicates from each lot and read over 3 days. The
alcohol concentrations were confirmed with a commercially available
enzymatic NAD-ADH reagent kit. The strips were read by trained
technicians. Samples were presented blindly from each of the four
saliva alcohol standards and were randomly presented for testing. The
results are presented in the tables below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable. This assay is intended for qualitative screening determination.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Each lot of test strips is verified during manufacturing by using control solutions that
have been prepared from purchased ethanol solutions that are confirmed using a
previously cleared enzymatic NAD-ADH Reagent kit. The control results from the
test strips are read visually by comparing to the color chart and then the color
intensity verified using a spectrophotometer.
d. Detection limit:
To assess the possibility of false positives, the sponsor performed a study analyzing
alcohol-free (0% BAC) saliva samples. Three lots were analyzed 20 times for a total
n of 60. There were 0 false positives observed when measuring zero concentration
samples.
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed studies to evaluate the effect of substances which may be
present in the saliva sample as well as a range of lighting and temperature conditions.
Substances that are consumed or used orally:

The sponsor evaluated the effect of cigarette smoke, chewing tobacco, mouthwash,
chewing gum, cough syrup and breath spray on the assay. For each potential
interferent, samples were collected from ten volunteers, of which five were drinkers
and five were non-drinkers. Results were read at 1 minute and 15 minutes after
consumption or use of the potential interferents. Samples were read by trained
technicians. There were no false positives or false negatives when samples were read
at 15 minutes after use or consumption of the potential interferents. False positives
were observed for cigarette smoke and alcohol containing mouthwash, breath spray
and cough syrup when read at one minute. The labeling specifies that users should not
consume anything or have anything in the mouth for at least fifteen minutes prior to
use.
Volatile Substances:
The sponsor conducted a study to assess the potential for positive or negative
interference from volatile substances. The volatile substance was spiked into alcohol-
free saliva samples and samples with alcohol concentrations of 0.008, 0.02, and 0.032
% BAC. No interference was seen for acetone, 2-butanol, glycerol, or isopropanol at
the concentrations listed below.
Concentration at which no

interference was observed
Acetone 1.0%
1-Butanol 0.0005%
2-Butanol 1.0%
Glycerol 1.0%
Isopropanol 0.5%
Methanol 0.0002%
The concentration at which no interference is observed in Alco-Screen® 02 test results
was determined for each substance. Those substances and their concentrations are
documented in the Package Insert.
Temperature:
The effect of temperature on the Alco-Screen® 02 test was evaluated using alcohol-
free saliva from volunteers and control solutions prepared at the cutoff level and at +/-
60% of each cut off level tested at 2 different temperature conditions: 10 and 40°C.
The concentration of the alcohol in the prepared solution was confirmed using an
enzymatic NAD-ADH reagent supplied by Pointe Scientific. All samples and test
strips were placed at different temperatures and allowed to equilibrate for 10 min
prior to testing. The test pad of each strip was saturated with each sample and allowed
to stand for 2 minutes prior to reading the result. A total of 20 replicates were tested
for each sample at each temperature. Results are summarized in the table below.

The labeling instructs the user to bring all test items to room temperature before use.
Lighting:
The effect of lighting on the device was evaluated by reading known spiked alcohol
concentrations of 0, 0.008, 0.020 and 0.032% in daylight, under fluorescent,
incandescent, sodium vapor and mercury vapor lighting. The study used three lots of
strips. Twenty replicates were tested for each of the standards under each of five
different lighting conditions using the standard test procedure. The strips were read
by trained technicians. There were no deviations from the expected results using
daylight, under fluorescent, incandescent and mercury vapor lighting. Under the
sodium vapor lighting for the negative and 0.008% sample, the undeveloped reactive
chemical stripe was more evident as noted by the trained technician. In the hands of
an untrained user, this may be erroneously identified as a positive signal. The labeling
for the Alco-Screen® will therefore instruct the user not to read the test results under
sodium vapor light.
f. Assay cut-off:
Analytical performance of the device around the claimed cutoff is described in
precision section (1a.) above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The Alco-Screen® 02 test results were compared to results from the Alco-Sensor IV
(Evidential Breath Testing Device). After reading the package insert thirty five
participants, designated as the testing volunteers performed the Alco-Screen® 02 test
on fifty two participants (27 drinkers and 25 non-alcohol drinkers). Results were
interpreted by the lay user followed by the trained facilitators. The trained facilitators
also performed the breath alcohol test using the Alco-Sensor IV. A total of 279 test

Reading Time Study:
The effect of various reading times on the Alco-Screen 02 Saliva Alcohol Test were
evaluated using negative saliva samples and saliva spiked with control solutions to
obtain alcohol concentrations at the cut off and at +/-60% of the cut off. The test pad
for each strip was saturated with sample and read at 4, and 5 minutes. A total of 20
replicates were tested for each read time for each sample.
The results support the suggested read time of 4 to 5 minutes. The labeling states that
the test results must be interpreted 4 minutes after sample application, and no longer
than 5 minutes after sample application.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Using these types of devices, alcohol is not detectable in the saliva of persons who have
not ingested alcohol.
