K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced:
CLSI - EP17A - “Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of
Quantitation; Approved Guideline”.
L. Test Principle:
The SHIGA TOXIN QUIK CHEK test utilizes specific antibodies against Stx1 and
Stx2. The membrane device contains a reaction window with three vertical lines of
immobilized antibodies. The “1” test line contains monoclonal antibodies against
Stx1. The control line (“C”) is a dotted line that contains anti-horseradish peroxidase
(HRP) antibodies. The “2” test line contains monoclonal antibodies against Stx2.
The conjugate consists of antibodies to Stx1 and Stx2 coupled to horseradish
peroxidase. To perform the test, the sample is added to a tube containing a mixture of
diluent and conjugate. The diluted sample-conjugate mixture is added to the sample
well and the device is allowed to incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes.
During the incubation, any Stx1 and/or Stx2 present in the sample binds to the
antibody-peroxidase conjugates. The toxin-antibody-peroxidase complexes migrate
through a filter pad to a membrane where they are captured by the immobilized Stx1
and Stx2 specific monoclonal antibodies in the test lines. The reaction window is
subsequently washed with wash buffer, followed by the addition of substrate. After a
10 minute incubation period, the reaction window is examined visually for the
appearance of vertical blue lines on the “1” and “2” sides of the reaction window. A
blue line on the “1” side of the reaction window is a positive result indicating the
presence of Stx1. A blue line on the “2” side of the reaction window is a positive
result indicating the presence of Stx2. A positive “C” reaction, indicated by a vertical
dotted blue line under the “C” portion of the reaction window, confirms that the test is
working properly, the procedure was followed, and the results are valid.

M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the SHIGA TOXIN QUIK CHEK test was determined using 12
masked fecal specimens Testing was performed at 2 independent laboratories and
on-site at TECHLABâ, Inc. The samples were tested, twice a day over a 5-day period
by multiple technicians at each site using 2 different kit lots. A positive and negative
control was run with each panel of the masked samples. The results from each
laboratory were submitted to TECHLAB®, Inc. and compared with in-house results.
The results were consistent among the different locations, and exhibited a correlation
of 100%. The samples produced the expected results 100% of the time.
Precision – Intra-Assay
For the determination of intra-assay performance, 6 positive fecal specimens (two
positive for Stx1, two positive for Stx2, two positive for both Stx1 and Stx2) and six
negative fecal specimens were analyzed. Each specimen was assayed on 5 cassettes.
All positives remained positive and all negatives remained negative.
Precision – Inter-Assay
The inter-assay precision of the SHIGA TOXIN QUIK CHEK test was determined
using 12 fecal specimens (six negative, two positive for Stx1, two positive for Stx2,
and two positive for both Stx1 and Stx2). The samples were tested, twice a day over a
5-day period using 2 different kit lots. A positive and negative control was run on
each day. All positives remained positive and all negatives remained negative.

d. Detection limit:
From direct fecal testing
The cutoff point for Stx1 was determined by using highly purified Stx1, and
was defined as the concentration of toxin which yielded positive results 95%
of the time, and negative results 5% of the time. The cutoff point was
5

--- Page 6 ---
determined empirically by testing dilutions of Stx1 in a negative fecal pool, in
replicates of 20. Using this method, the cutoff was found to be 0.042 ng/mL.
A concentration of 0.025 ng/mL was positive 50% of the time, and a
concentration of 0.022 ng/mL was negative 95% of the time.
The cutoff point for Stx2 was determined by using highly purified Stx2, and
was defined as the concentration of toxin which yielded positive results 95%
of the time, and negative results 5% of the time. The cutoff point was
determined empirically by testing dilutions of Stx2 in a negative fecal pool, in
replicates of 20. Using this method, the cutoff was found to be 0.039 ng/mL.
A concentration of 0.025 ng/mL was positive 50% of the time, and a
concentration of 0.013 ng/mL was negative 95% of the time.
From broth cultures
The cutoff point for Stx1 was determined by using highly purified Stx1, and
was defined as the concentration of toxin which yielded positive results 95%
of the time, and negative results 5% of the time. The cutoff point was
determined empirically by testing dilutions of Stx1 in overnight GN broth
culture of non-toxin producing E. Coli O157 (ATCC 043888), in replicates of
20. Using this method, the cutoff was found to be 0.042 ng/mL. A
concentration of 0.025 ng/mL was positive 50% of the time, and a
concentration of 0.010 ng/mL was negative 95% of the time.
The cutoff point for Stx2 was determined by using highly purified Stx2, and
was defined as the concentration of toxin which yielded positive results 95%
of the time, and negative results 5% of the time. The cutoff point was
determined empirically by testing dilutions of Stx2 in overnight GN broth
culture of non-toxin producing E. Coli O157 (ATCC 043888), in replicates of
20. Using this method, the cutoff was found to be 0.039 ng/mL. A
concentration of 0.025 ng/mL was positive 50% of the time, and a
concentration of 0.013 ng/mL was negative 95% of the time.

Interference from High Analyte Concentrations
A study was performed to ensure that a high concentration of Stx1 toxin does not
interfere with the detection of Stx2 toxin, or high concentrations of Stx2 toxin do not
interfere with the detection of Stx1 toxin. Low and high concentrations were based
on either 100x (high) or 3x (low) concentrations of Stx1 and Stx2 toxin. Low
samples were prepared by spiking a negative fecal pool with 3x the 95% cutoff
(LOD) for either toxin. High samples were prepared by spiking a negative fecal pool
with 100x the 95% cutoff for either toxin. Testing was performed in triplicate
according to the Package Insert instructions for direct testing. The results
demonstrated that elevated levels of one analyte did not affect the detection of the
other analyte.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cutoff for the SHIGA TOXIN QUIK CHEK test was established at
concentrations of 0.04 ng/mL Stx1 and 0.04 ng/mL Stx2.
