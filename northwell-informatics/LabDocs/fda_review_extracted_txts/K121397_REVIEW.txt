L. Test Principle:
The OSOM iFOB (Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood) Test is a rapid test which can
detect the presence of occult blood in human fecal samples by detecting the presence of
human hemoglobin (hHb). The OSOM iFOB Test is a qualitative assay that employs
immunochromatographic, lateral flow technology. The fecal sample collected using an
OSOM iFOB sample collection card is placed into a prefilled vial containing extraction
buffer. This test solution is then dispensed, through a dropper tip containing human
hemoglobin antibody conjugated to latex, into the sample well of the test device. The
sample migrates across the membrane containing a Test line coated with anti-human
hemoglobin antibody and a Control line. If hemoglobin is present at or above the level of
detection of the test, an antigen/antibody complex will be formed. The appearance of a
visible blue Test line and a red Control line in the result window indicates the presence of
human hemoglobin in the sample. A red control line must appear for the results to be
valid. If a detectable level of hemoglobin is not present, only the red Control line will
appear in the result window. An invalid test occurs when no control line appears.

The Control line serves as an internal procedural control, indicating that the test system is
functioning correctly and that the operator added a sufficient volume of sample. In
addition to the internal control in each test device, external controls are available in a
separate OSOM iFOBT control kit. The Negative Control (buffer solution) and the
Positive Control (hHb in buffer solution) are run in the iFOB Test in the same manner as
an extracted fecal sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
To demonstrate the reproducibility of the OSOM iFOB Test, an evaluation was
conducted at three external physician office laboratories (POL) and one internal
site using three OSOM test kit lots. Each site tested randomly coded panels of
fecal samples spiked with human blood, with known concentrations of hemoglobin
A (HbA) at five different concentrations: 0, 37.5, 50, 62.5, and 2000 ng/mL.
Testing was performed at the external POL sites by 3 intended users per site, with
varying levels of education and work experience. Testing at Sekisui Diagnostics
was performed by two experienced laboratory professionals. Each panel consisted
of 15 test samples, 3 of each of the 5 hemoglobin concentration levels, dried onto
an OSOM iFOB sample collection card. Each POL operator tested, in a random
fashion, 1 panel on each of the 3 lots of the OSOM iFOB Test. The internal site
tested the same number of samples across the 3 lots, with the panels divided
between the two operators. Testing was performed over three non-consecutive
days and all operators were blinded to the test sample analyte levels.
The results obtained by the three POL sites and the reference laboratory had an
overall agreement of 98.5% (95% CI: 97.4 – 99.0%) to the expected results, with a
positive percent agreement of 98.5% (95% CI: 96.4 – 99.3%), and a negative
percent agreement of 98.6% (95% CI: 96.0 – 99.5%). A summary of the
reproducibility study result is provided in the table below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The device and controls are not traceable to any recognized reference materials.
Internal Control: Procedural controls are included in the test device. The control
line serves as an internal procedural control, indicating that the test system is
functioning correctly and that the operator added a sufficient volume of sample.
External Quality Control: In addition to the internal control in each test device,
external controls are available in a separate OSOM iFOBT control kit. The
negative control (buffer solution) and the positive control (hHb in buffer solution)
are run in the iFOB Test in the same manner as an extracted fecal sample. It is
recommended that positive and negative controls be performed to verify proper
test performance.
Sample Stability: Fecal samples with negative (0 ng/mL hHbA) and positive (50
ng/mL hHbA) were applied to sample collection cards, dried, and stored in mailing
envelopes at room temperature for 46 days. Testing was performed (n=5) at
intervals with the OSOM iFOB Test. All positive samples were positive and all
negative samples were negative, demonstrating that fecal sample is stable for 46
days when stored at room temperature.
Sample Shipping Stress test: To assess the effects of exposure to transportation
stress and environmental extremes on the stability of dried fecal samples, negative
(0 ng/mL hHbA) and positive (50 ng/mL hHbA) fecal samples were prepared,
applied to sample collection cards, dried, and placed in mailing envelopes. In
evaluating the effect of exposure to elevated temperatures, fecal samples were
stored for 8 hours at 50°C, 55°C, and 60°C and for 2 days at 45°C. To evaluate
the effect of low temperature exposure, samples were stored for 2 days at 2 - 8°C
and 2 days at -20°C with two freeze/thaw cycles. Stressed samples were tested
(n=5) with the OSOM iFOB Test. All results were acceptable, demonstrating that
dried fecal samples are stable in the mailing envelope up to 8 hours at
temperatures as high as 60°C and up to 2 days at temperatures as low as -20° C
with up to two freeze/thaw cycles.
iFOB Test Kit Stability Study: Real time stability of the device (cassette, conjugate
vial tips, extraction reagent vials) was tested with 3 lots of the device. Devices
were stored at ambient room temperature (25°C) for ten months. Three devices
from each lot were tested with spiked fecal samples at time points 0, 9, and10
months in support of an initial nine months shelf-life. All test results were
acceptable demonstrating an initial stability of nine months when store at room
temperature. Stability testing with spiked fecal samples, in triplicate will continue
for the duration of the stability study to extend the expiration dating based on
passing stability results.

--- Page 7 ---
iFOB Test Kit Shipping Stress Test: To evaluate the effect of exposure to elevated
temperatures, iFOB reagents were stored for 8 hours at 50°C, 55°C, and 60°C and
for 2 days at 45°C. To evaluate the effect of low temperature exposure, reagents
were stored for 2 days at 2 - 8°C and 2 days at -20°C with two freeze/thaw cycles.
Reagents were also stored at room temperature (unstressed) as a control condition.
Spiked fecal samples and liquid hemoglobin controls (negative and low level
positive HbA control) were then tested with these stored reagents. At zero time
point testing was performed with five replicates and testing was performed in
triplicate for other time points. All test results were acceptable, demonstrating that
iFOB Test Kit performance was unaffected by the extreme temperatures tested.
iFOBT Control Kit Stability Study: Shelf life for iFOBT Controls was estimated
by accelerated stability testing of two lots of controls conducted at 2-8°C, 25°C
and 37°C. Testing was performed with one lot of iFOB Test reagents and included
five replicates on day zero and three replicates on all other days. The observed
accelerated stability results for 65 days of testing predict 24 months shelf life for
the OSOM iFOBT Control Kit at a storage temperature of 2° to 8°C. Accelerated
stability studies will continue up to 100 days, and confirmatory real time stability
studies at 2° to 8°C and at room temperature will continue for 24 months.
In addition to studies to determine expiry dating, open vial stability studies were
performed for the iFOB Controls. Three vials each of two lots of the negative and
positive controls were tested after opening on day zero, vials were re-capped and
stored at room temperature. Testing of all vials was performed in triplicate on
day-15 and day-31. All results were acceptable, demonstrating 30 days open vial
stability at room temperature.
iFOBT Control kit Shipping Stress Test: iFOBT test kits and two lots of the
control (positive and negative) stored at 50°C, 55°C, 60°C for 4 and 8 hours and at
45°C for 2 days were tested. Effect of low temperature exposure was evaluated by
storing controls at 2 - 8°C for 2 days and at -20°C for 2 days with two freeze/thaw
cycles. Control materials were also stored at room temperature (unstressed) as a
control condition. At zero time point testing was performed with five replicates
and testing was performed in triplicate at other time points. Test results showed
that positive and negative controls were not stable at 60°C and stable at all other
conditions tested.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit of the device was determined by spiking hemoglobin free stool
samples with known concentrations of hemoglobin A at five different
concentrations: 0, 37.5, 50, 62.5 and 2000 ng hHb/mL. The cut-off level was
determined to be 50 ng hHb/mL and no prozone effect was seen at up to 2000 ng
hHb/mL.
7

--- Page 8 ---
e. Analytical specificity:
The ability of the OSOM iFOB Test to detect human hemoglobin variants was
demonstrated in testing of known levels of hemoglobin-S (HbS) and hemoglobin-
C (HbC) across three reagent lots. All three lots of iFOB Test detected the
presence of both HbS and HbC at concentrations of 50 ng/mL and higher.
