Quantitation.
L. Test Principle:
The SHIGA TOXIN CHEK test uses antibodies to Stx1 and Stx2. The microassay
wells supplied with the kit contain immobilized monoclonal antibodies against Stx1
and Stx2. The detecting antibody consists of a mixture of anti-Stx1 and anti-Stx2
polyclonal antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. In the assay, an aliquot of
a fecal specimen or culture is emulsified in the Diluent and the diluted specimen is
then transferred to the microassay well containing the detecting antibody. If Stx1
and/or Stx2 are present in the specimen, they will bind to the detecting antibody and
to the immobilized monoclonal antibodies during the incubation phase. Any unbound
material is removed during the washing steps. Following the addition of substrate, a
color is detected due to the enzyme-antibody-antigen complexes that form in the
presence of toxin.

M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the SHIGA TOXIN CHEK test was determined using 11
fecal specimens that were coded to prevent their identification during testing.
Testing was performed at 2 independent laboratories and on-site at
TECHLABâ, Inc. The samples were tested, twice a day over a 5-day period
by multiple technicians at each site using 2 different kit lots. A positive and
negative control was run with each panel of the masked samples. The results
from each laboratory were submitted to TECHLAB®, Inc. and compared with
in-house results. The results were consistent among the different locations,
and exhibited a correlation of 100%. The samples produced the expected
results 100% of the time.
For the determination of intra-assay performance, 6 positive fecal specimens
and 6 negative fecal specimens were analyzed. Each specimen was assayed in
replicates of eight. All positives remained positive and all negatives remained
negative.
The inter-assay precision of the SHIGA TOXIN CHEK test was determined
using 12 fecal specimens (six negative, two positive for Stx1, two positive for
Stx2, and two positive for both Stx1 and Stx2). The samples were tested,
twice a day over a 5-day period using 2 different kit lots. A positive and
negative control was run each day. All positives remained positive and all
negatives remained negative.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
N/A
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
N/A
d. Detection limit:
From direct fecal testing
The limit of detection (LoD) for Stx1 was determined by using highly purified
Stx1, and was defined as the concentration of toxin which yielded positive
results 95% of the time, and negative results 5% of the time. The LoD was
determined empirically by testing dilutions of Stx1 in a negative fecal pool, in
replicates of 20. Using this method, the cutoff was found to be 0.280 ng/mL.

--- Page 6 ---
A concentration of 0.275 ng/mL was positive 50% of the time, and a
concentration of 0.260 ng/mL was negative 95% of the time.
The LoD for Stx2 was determined by using highly purified Stx2, and was
defined as the concentration of toxin which yielded positive results 95% of the
time, and negative results 5% of the time. The LoD was determined
empirically by testing dilutions of Stx2 in a negative fecal pool, in replicates
of 20. Using this method, the cutoff was found to be 0.230 ng/mL. A
concentration of 0.200 ng/mL was positive 50% of the time, and a
concentration of 0.150 ng/mL was negative 95% of the time.
From broth culture
The limit of detection (LoD) for Stx1 was determined by using highly purified
Stx1, and was defined as the concentration of toxin which yielded positive
results 95% of the time, and negative results 5% of the time. The LoD was
determined empirically by testing dilutions of Stx1 in overnight GN broth
culture of non-toxin producing E. Coli O157 (ATCC 043888), in replicates of
20. Using this method, the cutoff was found to be 0.180 ng/mL. A
concentration of 0.120 ng/mL was positive 50% of the time, and a
concentration of 0.110 ng/mL was negative 95% of the time.
The LoD for Stx2 was determined by using highly purified Stx2, and was
defined as the concentration of toxin which yielded positive results 95% of the
time, and negative results 5% of the time. The LoD was determined
empirically by testing dilutions of Stx2 in overnight GN broth culture of non-
toxin producing E. Coli O157 (ATCC 043888), in replicates of 20. Using this
method, the cutoff was found to be 0.300 ng/mL. A concentration of 0.200
ng/mL was positive 50% of the time, and a concentration of 0.170 ng/mL was
negative 95% of the time.

Strains/Serotypes
Various E. coli Shiga toxin-producing strains and serotypes were tested in the
SHIGA TOXIN CHEK test by both the Sorbitol MacConkey Agar (SMAC)
plate and MacConkey broth culture methods. Escherichia coli O157 strains
were also tested using CT-SMAC and ChromAgar O157 plate cultures. Each
strain is a clinical isolate and each was tested by a cytotoxin assay and by a
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to confirm the presence of the Shiga toxin
gene(s). All organisms generated positive results for the appropriate toxin(s)
when tested.
Following is a list of the serotypes tested, the number of strains tested in that
group type and the type of toxin produced by each strain.

Shiga toxin E. coli is the source of an estimated 110,000 cases (0.04% of the
population) of foodborne illness annually in the United States (11). Reported
incidence rates in fecal samples submitted for testing range from 0% - 4.1% and
vary depending upon the season, geographical location, and patient population,
with higher incidence rates seen in the summer months and in preschool-aged
children and the elderly (28). A positive result in the SHIGA TOXIN CHEK
test confirms the presence of Shiga toxin in the sample; a negative result indicates
the absence of toxin or insufficient levels of toxin for detection.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
1. The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports
a substantial equivalence decision.
