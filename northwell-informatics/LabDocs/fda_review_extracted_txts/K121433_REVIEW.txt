L. Principle:
When the blood is drawn into the blood reaction zone of the test strip, the glucose in the blood
sample mixes with a special chemical in the test strip, which produces a small electric current. The
reaction current is proportional to the amount of glucose in the blood. The result is displayed on
the LCD monitor and automatically stored in the meter for future use.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability was evaluated by analyzing venous whole blood samples spiked to six
different glucose concentrations. The hematocrit of all samples was between 30 and 55%.
Three lot numbers of test strips and ten meters were used in the study and each of the six
samples was measured ten times per strip lot per meter for a total of 100 measurements per
glucose concentration. Results are summarized below:

d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the device is 20 - 600 mg/dL. This range was validated by the
linearity study (M.1.b).
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed interference studies in accordance with CLSI EP7-A. Testing was
performed in parallel (control samples vs. test samples) to minimize the effects of glucose
metabolism. The glucose levels tested were approximately 65 and 310 mg/dL by the
reference method, and were produced by spiking into venous blood samples. Four
concentrations of each potential interferent were tested at each glucose level. The sponsor
defined no significant interference as ≤ 10%. The following substances did not cause
significant interference at the concentrations listed:

System Accuracy Study (capillary blood)
For this study, 90 capillary blood samples from the finger with concentrations from 50 –
391 mg/dL were collected and analyzed by a healthcare professional on the GoodLife CS-
200 Professional Blood Glucose Meter. Five additional samples at concentrations < 50
mg/dL and five additional samples at concentrations > 400 mg/dL were also analyzed.
Low concentrations were achieved by allowing samples to glycolyze and high
concentration samples were achieved by spiking. Three lots of test strips were used to
collect the data and all results were compared to the YSI glucose reference method.

Lay User Study (capillary blood only)
For this study, 150 naive lay users collected and analyzed their own fingerstick capillary
blood samples using the GoodLife CS-200 Blood Glucose Meter. The participants did not
receive any training other than to read the English labeling provided with the GoodLife CS-
200 Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Within 5 minutes a second capillary fingerstick
sample was collected for analysis on the YSI reference method. Three lots of test strips
were used to collect the data. Results are summarized below:

are included in the starter kit. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are
provided in the labeling. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the glucose
strip vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these
ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study
In this study, one strip lot was tested on one meter in replicates of six at each of the
following hematocrit levels: 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 55, and 60%. The glucose levels in venous
blood samples fell into six categories: 20 – 50, 51 – 110, 111 – 150, 151 – 250, 251 – 400,
and 401 – 600 mg/dL. A single replicate was obtained for each combination of test
strip/glucose level/hematocrit and donor. This resulted in n = 252 data points (6 glucose
levels x 7 hematocrit levels x 6 replicates per sample). Glucose concentrations were
verified by the YSI reference method. The bias relative to the reference method was
acceptable to support the claim that hematocrit levels of 30 to 55% do not significantly
affect the glucose results.
2. Sample Volume Study
The sponsor performed a sample volume study to support the claimed minimum sample
volume requirement for the GoodLife CS-200 Blood Glucose Monitoring System (0.5 µL)
using blood samples at six glucose concentrations (44, 80, 131, 207, 314, and 508 mg/dL).
Results support the claimed sample volume of 0.5 µL.
3. Altitude Study
In this study, one test strip lot was tested on four meters on blood samples adjusted into six
categories: 20 – 50, 51 – 110, 111 – 150, 151 – 250, 251 – 400, and 401 – 600 mg/dL. The
samples were tested at three altitude levels: sea level, 5,741 feet, and at 8,800 feet. Each
combination of altitude / sample / meter was tested in replicates of 5. This resulted in n =
360 data points (3 altitudes x 6 glucose levels x 4 meters x 5 replicates). Glucose
concentrations were verified by the YSI reference method. The bias relative to the
reference method was acceptable to support the claim that altitudes up to 8,800 feet do not
significantly affect the glucose results.
4. Temperature and Humidity Studies
In this study, one test strip lot was tested on two meters at eight glucose concentrations at
ten combinations of temperature and humidity. Each combination of environmental
conditions / glucose concentration / meter was tested in replicates of 5. This resulted in n =
800 data points (10 environmental conditions x 8 glucose concentrations x two meters x 5
replicates). The temperatures tested were 46, 50, 77, 104, and 108° F. The relative
humidities tested were 15 and 85%. Glucose concentrations were verified by the YSI
15

--- Page 16 ---
reference method. The bias relative to the reference method was acceptable to support the
claim that temperatures from 10 – 40° C (50 – 104° F) and relative humidities from 20 –
80% do not significantly affect the glucose results.
5. Infection Control Studies
The GoodLife CS-200 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for single-patient
use. The GoodLife CS-200 Professional Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for
multiple-patient use. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials
comprising the meter by an outside commercial testing facility demonstrating complete
inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, Clorox Germicidal
Wipes (EPA Registration Number 67619-12). Robustness studies were also performed by
the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials
for the meter after 13,688 cleaning and disinfection cycles with Clorox Germicidal Wipes.
The robustness studies were designed to simulate 5 years of multiple-patient use. Labeling
was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection
procedures.
6. EMC testing
Electromagnetic Compatibility and Electrical Safety testing were performed in accordance
with EN 60601-1, EN 60601-1-2, EN 61010-1, EN 61010-2-101and EN 61326-1. The
device satisfied all of the requirements.
7. Readability Assessment
The sponsor provided a readability assessment on the User Guide, Test Strip Insert, and
Control Solution Insert. The Flesch-Kincaid analysis produced a grade level of 7.8, 7.9,
and 7.9 respectively.
