BacT/ALERT® Microbial Detection System
I. Device Description:
The BacT/ALERT Microbial Detection System provides both a microbial detection
system and a culture medium bottle with suitable nutritional and environmental
conditions for microorganisms commonly encountered in blood taken from a
patient suspected of having bacteremia/fungemia. In the BacT/ALERT PF Plus
bottle, charcoal is eliminated and is replaced with two types of absorbent resins as
the antimicrobial neutralization agents. The PF Plus bottle is to increase the clarity
of Gram stains in comparison to the predicate BacT/ALERT PF Culture Bottle.
An inoculated bottle is placed into the instrument where it is incubated and
continuously monitored for the presence of microorganisms that will grow in the
BacT/ALERT bottles.
The BacT/ALERT Microbial Detection System utilizes a colorimetric sensor and
reflected light to monitor the presence and production of carbon dioxide (CO ) that is
2
dissolved in the culture medium. If microorganisms are present in the test sample,
carbon dioxide is produced as the microorganisms metabolize the substrates in the
2

--- Page 3 ---
culture medium. When growth of the microorganisms produces CO , the color of the
2
gas-permeable sensor installed in the bottom of each culture bottle changes from
blue-green to yellow. The lighter color results in an increase of reflectance units
monitored by the system. Bottle reflectance is monitored and recorded by the
instrument every 10 minutes.

L. Test Principle:
The BacT/ALERT (BTA) Microbial Detection System utilizes a colorimetric sensor and
reflected light to monitor the presence and production of carbon dioxide (CO ) that is
2
dissolved in the culture medium. If microorganisms are present in the test sample, carbon
dioxide is produced as the microorganisms metabolize the substrates in the culture
medium. When growth of the microorganisms produces CO , the color of the gas-
2
permeable sensor installed in the bottom of each culture bottle changes from blue-green
to yellow. The lighter color results in an increase of reflectance units monitored by the
system. Bottle reflectance is monitored and recorded by the instrument every 10 minutes.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
Antimicrobial Neutralization
An internal seeded study was conducted to demonstrate an acceptable rate of
recovery and detection of microorganisms in the presence of antimicrobials. The
targeted inoculum for each organism was 125 CFU/bottle. Bottles without
adsorbent (i.e. SA) were used as negative controls during the study. In this
seeded study, blood containing antimicrobials, in clinically relevant
concentrations, was added directly to the BacT/ALERT® PF Plus Culture Bottles
and inoculated with susceptible strains of aerobic and facultative anaerobic
microorganisms. Antimicrobial neutralization was tested on at least three
validation lots of PF Plus Culture Bottles. Initial testing of all antimicrobials was
evaluated at 120% Peak Serum Level (PSL). When bottles fail to recover
microorganism for a particular antimicrobial/microorganism combination when
the antimicrobial is at 120% PSL, that antimicrobial/microorganism pair was
tested at 100% PSL or lower as necessary to achieve 100% recovery of the
organism seeded. Antimicrobials were considered effectively neutralized by the
BacT/ALERT PF Plus medium based on 100% recovery of the organisms tested
at the indicated percent of peak serum level tested.
The study demonstrated that antimicrobials from the following categories were
neutralized by BacT/ALERT® PF Plus Culture Bottle resulting in a positive bottle
signal within five days or less after inoculation: penicillins, glycylcyclines,
polyenes, macrolides, triazoles, echinocandins, aminoglycosides,
fluoroquinolones, lincosamides, glycopeptides, and oxazolidinones. Antimicrobial
neutralization was also achieved for cefazolin, cefoxitin, ceftaroline.
Antimicrobial neutralization was not achieved for ceftazidime or cefepime.
Less than complete neutralization was observed for cefotaxime and ceftriaxone.
Cefotaxime was neutralized at ranges of 50% PSL to 2% PSL depending on the
microorganism. Ceftrixone was neutralized at ranges of 50% PSL to 1% PSL
depending on the microorganism. The antimicrobial neutralization study results

Delayed Entry
A multi-center study was conducted to evaluate the effect of a delay, from the time the
BacT/ALERT® PF Plus is inoculated, to the time the bottle is placed on the instrument.
This seeded study was conducted at three study sites (one in-house, and two external
sites), each using a different lot of BacT/ALERT® PF Plus Culture Bottles. Three
replicates each of 11 species* at target concentrations 100 CFU per bottle (acceptable
range of 30 to 300 CFU per bottle) were generated at three sites. Actual inoculum
levels ranged from 35 CFU/bottle to 290 CFU/bottle. All bottles contained human
blood from healthy volunteers and were held at specified temperatures and times prior
to loading into the BacT/ALERT instrument. Percent recovery reflects positive flag by

the instrument and Gram stain/subculture consistent with the seeded isolation of target
organisms.
BacT/ALERT® PF Plus were tested at five different combinations of holding
temperature/holding period, as indicated below, prior to being loaded on to the
instrument. This was done to evaluate the instrument’s ability to detect the organisms
within 5 days of incubation based on a panel of microorganisms that have been seeded
into simulated blood cultures.
The study demonstrated that all holding conditions showed ≥90% percent recovery
except for culture bottles held at 35 to 37°C for 24 hours or longer before loading. At
this holding temperature/period combination, the PF Plus may not detect
microorganisms and should be subcultured. The study results are illustrated in Table 2
below.

Within-Laboratory Precision (Repeatability)
Within-laboratory precision was evaluated from in-house seeded studies
conducted on 12 days on multiple instruments by multiple operators.
Organisms were grown in the presence of clinically relevant concentrations
of antimicrobials to which they are susceptible. In this seeded study
BacT/ALERT PF Plus bottles were subcultured at least 24 hours after being
flagged positive by the instrument. A minimum of 108 replicates were tested
for each organism/antimicrobial combination:

Reproducibility
A reproducibility study was conducted at three study sites (two external and
one internal) using a target of at lest162 replicates per site on three (3) days
with a minimum of two operators per site. Reproducibility was evaluated on
each of 9 organisms. Two organisms organisms (C. albicans and S.
pneumoniae) were prepared by serial dilution and the other seven organisms
were prepared using Bioballs. C. albicans and S. pneumoniae were seeded
into the PF Plus bottle, at a target inoculum of 100 CFU/bottle, with an
acceptable range of 30-300 CFU/bottle and the other 7 organisms at a target
range of 1-17 CFU/bottle. The actual inoculum ranged from 6 CFU/bottle to
700 CFU/bottle for the 30-300 CFU/bottle range, and from 1 CFU/bottle to
270 CFU/bottle for the 1-17 CFU/bottle range. Percent recovery reflects
positive flag by the instrument and Gram-stain/subculture consistent with the
seeded organism. The study results are illustrated in Table 4 below:

Stability of the BacT/ALERT PF Plus bottles (shelf life)
Studies were conducted to demonstrate the PF Plus bottles shelf-life. Three
lots each of PF Plus bottles produced for product validation and for product
verification were tested until they were 13 month old. At the beginning of the
study, bottles were thermally stressed, or not thermally stressed, and then
stored at either 15-30oC or 2-8oC for a total of 4 treatment/storage conditions.
At each time point, growth performance, antimicrobial neutralization, and
physical parameters were evaluated. Bottles were also tested to determine if
they possessed sufficient vacuum to direct draw 10 ml blood, and if
coagulation was prevented when direct blood draw was allowed to continue
until bottle vacuum was exhausted. Initial stability studies were conducted
using a high target inoculum and were not challenging enough based on the
claimed LoD. Additional studies were conducted using levels of organisms
around the LoD using aged bottles and demonstrated that stability can be
achieved for the claimed shelf life.
It was noted that the vacuum remains as ≥11 Hg for the PF Plus. There are
the potential risk(s) of drawing more than 4 mL of blood in the event of direct
draw in the pediatric population, which could be as low as 50 mL. A caution
statement was in place in the package insert.
Quality Control
Quality control testing was conducted at the clinical sites. Overall QC results
were found to be acceptable at the clinical sites. Unacceptable QC results
were observed due to technical errors such as colony counts out of range, site
failure to change bottles status after positive instrument signal and positive
subculture, and no supplement added.
The isolates listed below were inoculated with test organisms with growth
within 5 days being the acceptable result. All test organisms were inoculated
into PF Plus bottles at a target concentration of 100 CFUs.

bottle was positive. A culture bottle was determined to be a “True Positive” if
the bottle was flagged positive by the BacT/ALERT System and resulted in
growth of the isolate upon subculture of this bottle. True positive rates were
calculated for the PF Plus and PF culture bottles, and the ratio of PF Plus true
positives to PF true positives was calculated to compare performance. Clinical
isolates recovered were classified as significant, contaminant, or unknown
based on determination by the clinical trial sites.
A total of 172 isolates were recovered from all compliant pediatric blood bottle
pairs with a positive status. There were a total of 145 bottle pairs that recovered
at least 1 isolate by subculture of PF Plus or PF bottles. A total of 126 bottle pairs
recovered a single isolate, 12 bottle pairs recovered two isolates, 6 bottle pairs
recovered 3 isolates, and 1 bottle pair recovered 4 isolates. The total population
reported in Table B comprises the 172 isolates recovered from positive bottle
pairs and 2043 negative bottle pairs for a total of 2215 results. The BacT/ALERT
PF Plus bottle detected a total of 140 isolates compared to the BacT/ALERT
PF bottle that detected 128 isolates. Of the significant isolates, the
BacT/ALERT PF Plus bottle detected a total of 91 isolates compared to the
BacT/ALERT PF bottle that detected 77 isolates. One (1) false positive was
identified by subculture of a positive BacT/ALERT PF Plus bottle and
comprised 0.05% (1/2215) of the study population.
The tables below compare results of the BacT/ALERT PF Plus to BacT/ALERT
PF blood cultures for all compliant blood culture bottles that yielded any number
of isolates on subculture (Tables A, B), a single isolate alone on subculture (Table
C), and multiple isolates on subculture (Table D).
