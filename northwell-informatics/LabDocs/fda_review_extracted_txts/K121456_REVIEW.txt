AUTION HYBRID Fully Automated Integrated Urine Analyzer (model AU- 4050)
I. Device Description:
The AUTION HYBRID™ AU-4050 Fully Automated Integrated Urine Analyzer
contains a test strip chemistry urine analyzer for the measurement of glucose, protein,
bilirubin, urobilinogen, pH, blood, ketones, nitrite, leukocytes, specific gravity,
turbidity, and color using Uriflet 9HA test strips and a flow cytometry module that
analyzes the following parameters: RBC, WBC, epithelial cells, casts, bacteria, and
flags the presence of the following: pathologic cast, crystal, sperm, small round cell,
yeast like cell and mucus.
Urine Chemistry Module (CHM)
The CHM consists of an automated urine analyzer, sampler, and accessories. The
sampler automatically feeds sample racks to the analyzer. The sampler contains a bar
code reader for urine specimen identification. The analyzer uses reflectance
spectroscopy for the measurement of the urine parameters: glucose, protein,
3

--- Page 4 ---
bilirubin, urobilinogen, pH, blood, ketones, nitrite, leukocytes, specific gravity,
turbidity, and color. Specific gravity is determined using the refractive index
method, and turbidity is evaluated by measuring the transmission and scattering of
light passing through the urine specimen. The CHM is designed to be used with
Uriflet™ S 9HA multi-parameter test strips. The Uriflet™ S 9HA multi-parameter
test strips contain reactive pads on a non-reactive plastic backing. The reactive pads
are impregnated with reagents formulated to detect a specific urine analyte or
characteristic. Each strip also contains a correction pad for urine color
determination. The Uriflet™ S 9HA test strip (for use with the AU-4050) is
identical to the AUTION Sticks 9EB test strip (for use with the AX-4030) which was
cleared under k093098 with regard to specific urine analyte, reagent composition and
performance. The only difference is the barcode on the bottom of the test strip
which provides for exclusive use of the Uriflet™ S 9HA test strip on the AU-4050.
Flow Cytometry Module (FCM)
The FCM consists of an automated urine particle analyzer for the analysis of
microscopic formed elements in urine specimens. The FCM consists of three
principal units: (1) Main Unit which aspirates, dilutes, mixes and analyzes urine
samples; (2) Auto Sampler Unit supplies samples to the Main Unit automatically; (3)
IPU (Information Processing Unit) which processes data from the Main Unit and
provides the operator interface with the system. The IPU also contains a modular work
area management (WAM) system for data processing and acts as an independent data
manager system that interfaces with the AU-4050 and the LIS (Laboratory Information
System). This data manager has the capability for patient demographics, test orders, and
test results. The FCM is equipped with a Sampler that provides continuous automated
sampling for up to 50 tubes. The FCM uses flow cytometry using a red semiconductor
laser for analyzing organized elements of urine. Particle characterization and
identification is based on detection of forward scatter, fluorescence and adaptive cluster
analysis. Using its own reagents, the FCM automatically classifies organized elements
of urine and carries out all processes automatically from aspiration of the sample to
yielding the results.
Test Strip Analysis (CHM) Methodology and Sample Flow
Specialized test strips are analyzed with the dual-wavelength reflectance method (one
wavelength for BLD). Test strips set in the feeder are fed, one at a time, onto the test
strip tray inside the instrument, and they are moved by the guide arms to the sample
drop application position. After drop application, the test strip is moved to the light
measurement area.
The test strip reacts within around 60 seconds of drop application, changing color, and
its reflectivity is measured at that time. In the light measurement area, a 5-wavelength
LED emits 2-wavelength light that shines onto the reagent pad. The light reflected from
the pad is picked up by one sensor. Light from the color compensation pad of the test
strip is also measured to compensate for variable factors such as the amount of reflected
light and the coloration of the sample.
Specific gravity is measured by the transmission refractometry method. The
turbidity/color hue measurement unit built into the instrument uses transmitted light to
4

--- Page 5 ---
measure color hue. For color hue measurement, R (635 nm), G (525 nm) and B (470
nm) light are shone onto the sample in the cylindrical cell, and the hue and shade of the
sample are analyzed from the amounts of each color transmitted through the sample.
The colors are YELLOW, ORANGE, BROWN, RED, VIOLET, BLUE, and GREEN,
and these 7 colors each have LIGHT, normal, and DARK graduations. Additional color
determinations are COLORLESS and OTHER, for a total of 23 colors. The
turbidity/color hue measurement unit built into the instrument uses transmitted light and
scattered light to measure turbidity.
Flow Cytometry (FCM) Methodology and Sample Flow
This analyzer uses the flow cytometry method to analyze elements contained in urine.
After the staining reaction, laser light is shone onto the sample flow within sheath flow
in the flow cell, generating a forward scattered light signal, a laterally scattered light
signal and a fluorescent light signal from each urine particle. These are converted into
electrical signals, which are detected and used to identify each particle. The fully
automated integrated urine analyzer AU-4050 uses Flow Cytometry (FCM) technology
to obtain the parameters of forward scattered and forward fluorescent light of urine
cells. After specific substances in the cells are given fluorescent staining and placed in
suspension, they are then covered in sheath fluid and ejected through a nozzle in a
single row. Here each urine cell is illuminated by a tightly focused laser beam. The
individual cells fluoresce and scatter light to varying degrees. It is the analysis of these
electrical signals which allows each urine cell to be discriminated by generating a one
dimensional histogram, based on fluorescent intensity, and a two-dimensional scatter
gram, based on fluorescent intensity and scattered light intensity.

L. Test Principle:
The AU-4050 uses flow cytometry (FCM) to detect and characterize formed elements in
the urine through the use of forward scattered and forward fluorescent light of urine cells.
Chemical testing is performed with urine reagent test strips which use dual-wavelength
reflectance photometry. Specific gravity is measured by transmission refractometry. Color
hue of the urine is measured using the reflectivity of transmitted light. Turbidity is
measured using transmitted and scattered light.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the urine chemistry (CHM) and the flow cytometry (FCM)
portions of the AU-4050 were assessed by a 15- day precision study performed
at 3 clinical laboratory sites. The CHM precision samples consisted of a high-
positive control; a mid-positive control, and a negative control. Precision samples
for the FCM portion of the instrument included a high and low control. Each
precision sample was run in duplicate during 2 runs per day; each run was
separated by at least 4 hours. Repeatability and reproducibility were calculated
across 3 clinical sites, 3 users (1 per site), 3 instruments (1 per site), and 3 lots of
reagents (1 per site). The data were analyzed according to CLSI EP5-A2
guidelines, Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement
Methods. The tables below present the combined Precision results for the urine
chemistry analytes (CHM) and urine sediments/flow cytometry (FCM).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Urine Chemistry Module (CHM)
The linear range of the AU-4050 chemistry module was evaluated by measuring
negative urine and negative urine spiked with known concentrations covering the
entire measuring range of each analyte present on the Uriflet S 9HA urine strip.
Sample measurement was performed on 3 lots of reagent strips in replicates of 7 for
a total of 21 measurements per sample tested. The spiked samples were also
measured on the predicate device to confirm the results. A pH meter was used to
confirm the pH results. Specific gravity samples were prepared by diluting sucrose
in deionized water at 0.010 intervals from 1.000 to 1.060. Specific gravity
measurements were tested in replicates of 20 on each of 3 AU-4050 analyzers. The
specific gravity values were confirmed by a clinical, handheld refractometer.
Color tone samples were designed and prepared in accordance with the
International Commission of Illumination (CIE) XYZ color system. Color tone
measurements were tested in singleton, performed over 3 separate runs on one
AU-4050 analyzer for a total of 3 measurements per color tone sample.
Turbidity samples were prepared at the negative, 1+, and 2+ ranks using a latex
turbidity standard solution diluted with deionized water. Turbidity
measurements were performed in replicates of 20 on one AU-4050 analyzer and
one predicate analyzer. The linear range of the AU 4050 is summarized
below:

Flow Cytometry Module (FCM)
Linearity studies were performed to assess the performance of the Flow
Cytometry Module (FCM) over a wide range of cell type concentrations.
High and Low Pools were created by concentrating or diluting samples
which spanned the full measuring range of RBC, WBC, Epithelial Cell, Cast
and Bacteria parameters in accordance with CLSI EP6A approved guidelines.
FCM dilution tubes were prepared by mixing low and high urine pools for each
parameter to achieve a minimum of five dilution points that were evenly
distributed across the measuring range for each parameter. Each tube was
tested 2 to 5 times using manual mode for FCM analysis. Slope, intercept and
Mean Replicate % differences were calculated for each FCM parameter. FCM
Mean replicate percent difference values recovered within the maximum
allowable % difference as shown below:

lower limit to upper limit of the analytical measuring range and
within measured allowable maximum percent difference for each
parameter.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability- Control Value Assignment
The control value assignment was performed using 3 analyzers and 3 bottles of
each of the two levels of control solutions (L and H). To determine the target
value of each control, for each cell type measured, a mean result was
calculated from the 15 replicate results from each of the 3 analyzers. A
grand mean of replicates from all three analyzers (n=45) was then
calculated. The %CV of each analyzer’s 15 replicates was calculated
and checked for acceptability against the predetermined acceptance
criteria for each cell type.
Stability
AUTION Control Solution
Stability studies were performed to assess the open and closed bottle stability
for the AU-4050 FCM controls, AUCTION Control Solutions L and H. The
procedure used to evaluate open bottle stability was to assay three lots of
AUCTION Control Solutions L and H stored at 12º C. Testing occurred at pre-
determined time-points throughout the study. The procedure used to evaluate
closed bottle stability was to assay a single lot of AUTION Control Solutions L
and H stored at 12º C. Testing occurred at pre-determined time-points
throughout the study. The stability testing results demonstrated opened urine
controls used on the AUTION HYBRID™ AU-4050 are stable for 217 days.

Unopened controls used on the AUTION HYBRID™ AU-4050 are stable for
1 year. The labeling states that the open vial stability is 30 days at 2-10º C.
Storage stability (closed vial) is until expiration date at 2-10º C.
Chemistry Module (CHM) Stability
Stability studies were performed to assess the open and closed bottle stability
for the urine chemistry strips used on the AUTION HYBRID™ AU-4050.
The procedure used to evaluate open bottle stability was to assay bi-level
control materials using a single lot of ARKRAY urinalysis strips stored at room
temperature in replicates of three and AUTION Check Strips in replicates of
two at pre-determined time-points throughout the study. The procedure used to
evaluate closed bottle stability was to assay spiked urine samples using three
lots of ARKRAY urinalysis strips stored at room temperature in replicates of
five at pre-determined time-points throughout the study. All testing was
conducted in percent reflectance. The stability testing results revealed that
opened ARKRAY urinalysis strips are stable for 31 days. Unopened ARKRAY
urinalysis strips are stable for 2 years.

AU-4050 CHM Strip Sensitivity Evaluation
Study 1: Sensitivity Study 1 was done to determine the concentration at
which each analyte on the Uriflet S 9HA strip changed from negative to the
lowest positive color block. Samples were prepared by spiking the specified
analyte into negative urine to obtain the target concentrations to determine the
sensitivity between the negative color block and the next lowest color block for
each analyte on the Uriflet S9HA urinalysis strip. Each analyte tested a
target concentration of the analyte, plus a concentration on each side of the
target in order to determine the sensitivity concentration. Each pool was
spiked with the specified analyte concentration, and then analyzed in replicates of
5 on each of 3 strip lots, for a total of 30 replicates. The analytical sensitivity for
each color block for each analyte is defined as the lowest concentration at
which >50% of the test results are positive between the negative color block and the
first positive color block. The results are summarized in the following table:

Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) Flow Cytometry Module (FCM)
The LoQ study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP17A. The study was
performed by preparing three low concentration samples for each cell type
measured by the AU-4050. Each sample was measured 15 times on the AU-
4050 for a total of 45 replicates. A mean value was calculated for each sample.
Each sample was also measured 5 times on the predicate device to obtain a
reference value. The mean bias was calculated by averaging the individual
sample bias. The LoQ was determined to be equal to the LoD for each of the
5 cell types measured by the FCM module of the AU-4050.

Each sample was measured on the AU-4050 in replicates of 5 and a mean result was
calculated. The mean result from samples with no interfering substance was
compared against the mean result of the sample spiked with the interfering substance at
the stated concentrations. Interference was determined based on the acceptance
criteria stated below. Negative Samples: If sample results are 1+ (75 for Leukocytes) or
greater, interference is considered positive. pH results will be considered positive for
interference when the results differ by greater than +/- 2 ranks from the pH sample
containing no interfering substance.
Positive Samples: If sample results differ by greater than +/- 1 color block between
samples containing the interfering substance and samples without it, interference will
be considered positive.

Flow Cytometry Module (FCM) Interfering Substances:
The sponsor includes the following statement in the labeling:
Based on the technological characteristics of the flow cytometry method, when
measuring the following sample types on the AUTION HYBRID™ AU-4050, there
is a possibility that correct results will not be obtained.
(1) High viscosity
Samples with high viscosity may form blockages in the sample
sample containing pus
filter preventing sample aspiration which in turn may prevent
output of correct measurement results.
(2) Samples with gross Flow cytometry analysis is used to optically detect
hematuria individual particles such as cells based on signal waveform
characteristics . With gross hematuria, there are a great number of red
blood cells and there is a possibility that multiple red blood cells or
other substances in the urine may be detected at the same time
(simultaneous flow-through).
If simultaneous flow through occurs, the characteristics of the signal
waveform may not match with the Operating Manual (10.2.4 FCM
Measurement Particle Analysis Principle) and correct measurement
may not be obtained.
(3) Samples with high Flow cytometry analysis is used to optically detect
numbers of individual particles such as cells based on signal waveform
indeterminate particles characteristics. With indeterminate particles, there is a possibility that
such as mucus strings. multiple indeterminate particles or other substances in the urine may
be detected at the same time (simultaneous flow- through).
If simultaneous flow through occurs, the characteristics of the signal
waveform may not match with the Operating Manual (10.2.4 FCM

Even if particulate preservative appears to have dissolved, it
(4) Samples that may not have completely dissolved on a micrometer scale. As
contain preservative specified in the Operating Manual (10.2.4 FCM Measurement Particle
Analysis Principle), analysis is performed according to the size of the
particle and the degree of luminescence that emanates from them as
well as other factors. Where preservative particles are equivalent in
size as red blood cells etc, misdetection may occur resulting in a
failure to obtain correct measurement results.
(5) Stored urine Cells in the presence of hypersthenuria or hyposthenuria
may become deformed due to the osmotic potential. Red or white
blood cells may lyse and the nucleus of epithelial cells may become
exposed. It is known that red blood cells lyse easily in low osmotic
potential environments and in the presence of alkaline urine.
At room temperature, bacteria may proliferate which may increase the
alkalinity of the urine. This may result in the detection or non-
detection of crystals in urine or encourage the lysing of red blood cells.
As such, where stored urine is used, correct measurement results may
not be obtained.
Carryover
Chemistry Module (CHM) Carryover
Carryover studies were performed to assess the amount of sample carried over by the
AUTION HYBRID™ AU-4050 CHM from one specimen reaction into subsequent
specimen reactions. The procedure used to evaluate carryover was to create high and
low concentrations of each analyte by spiking analytes into a negative urine pool.
Testing consisted of two runs in the following order: Low 1, Low 2, High 1, High 2,
Low 3, Low 4. Carryover (%) was calculated using the following formula:
Carryover (%) = [(Low 3) - (Low 4)] / [(High 1) - (Low 4)] × 100
Results of the carryover testing for the urine chemistry analytes demonstrated zero
carryover by the AUTION HYBRID™ AU-4050

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were conducted to evaluate the performance of the
AUTION HYBRID™ AU-4050 for the measurement of urine chemistry analytes
(CHM) and urine sediment/flow cytometry (FCM) in human urine specimens.
Results from the AUTION HYBRID™ AU-4050 were compared to those from two
commercially available systems, the ARKRAY AUTION MAX™ AX-4030
Automated Urine Chemistry Analyzer and the Sysmex UF-1000i™ Automated Urine
Particle Analyzer.
Testing was performed at three external clinical sites in the United States. Each
clinical site tested approximately 640 urine samples. The urine samples for analysis in
these method comparison studies were provided by the external clinical sites. Samples
were collected within 2 hours of testing if maintained at room temperature or were
stored for up to 8 hours prior to testing if maintained at 2-8°C. In order to obtain the
desired range of abnormal values, a pool of negative urine samples were spiked to
elevated levels with the analytes to be evaluated. These spiked samples represent less
than 15% of the total samples tested and are identified in the line data. A total of
1931urine samples (native urine samples + spiked samples) were tested in parallel
using the AUTION HYBRID™ AU-4050 System, the AX-4030 and the UF-1000i. For
each urine chemistry analyte and urine sediment type, the values obtained for the
individual urine samples were referred to the respective cut-off values for each system
to discriminate between the negative (normal) and positive (abnormal) findings, if
applicable. Percent positive agreement (relative sensitivity) and percent negative
agreement (relative specificity) were determined. The data are also presented in
concordance charts showing percent exact agreement and percent agreement within 1

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Analysis of samples
Sampler analysis: Multiple samples are analyzed consecutively, using a sample rack.
Using the Sampler Unit, sample racks can be transported automatically, and the
samples analyzed sequentially. Up to ten samples can be set in one sample rack, and up
to six racks (60 samples) can be set in one Sampler Unit at once. Analysis results are
managed by sample number. Manual analysis (only compatible with FCM analysis
parameters): Samples can be analyzed manually, without using sample racks, but only
for FCM analysis. After inputting the information necessary for analysis into the IPU,
the operator mixes one sample each and set the sample on the aspiration port of the
Main Unit for analysis. Even when performing a sampler analysis, manual analysis can
be performed by stopping the sampler analysis.
5. Calibration:
Automatic Background check
After the temperature has stabilized, the automatic rinsing/background check
dialog box is displayed. A background check is performed. The analysis will
be repeated a maximum of three times. The background analysis results will
automatically be displayed in the automatic cleansing/background check
dialog box. If the figure is below the allowable value, the dialog box will be
closed and the Main Unit will enter stand-by status.
Specific gravity calibration
The instrument is calibrated using specific gravity standard solutions prepared by the
customer (Low solution and High solution). The sponsor recommends performing
specific gravity calibration once per month.
Check measurement
White Check Strips are provided by the manufacturer to verify calibration. The
manufacture recommends to measure the check strips to verify that the CHM analyzer
is working correctly any time CHM analysis results appear suspect.
6. Quality Control:
Recommendations for quality control are described in the labeling. Additionally, users
should follow local, state and federal regulations.
CHM QC analysis
The sponsor recommends the use of commercially available controls intended for
monitoring urine dipstick results for the following parameters: glucose, protein,
bilirubin, urobilinogen, pH, blood, ketones, nitrites, leukocytes, and specific gravity.

FCM QC analysis
• AUTION Control Solution (AUTION Control Solution (H)/AUTION Control
Solution (L))
The AU-4050 operator’s manual reads as follows:
Perform QC analysis daily at start-up according to individual laboratory standard
procedures. Quality control analysis is performed to verify accuracy of instrument. For
QC analysis of CHM analysis parameters, the sample racks provided can be used to
analyze three types or three concentrations of control material at once. Use manual
analysis for QC analysis of FCM analysis parameters. There are two levels of quality
control for FCM analysis: With X-Bar control, the control material is analyzed twice in
succession, and the average is used as the control data. With L-J control, the control
material is analyzed once and the value is used as the control data.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above: none
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and
supports a substantial equivalence decision.
