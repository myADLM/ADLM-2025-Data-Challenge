I. Device Description:
The new BacT/ALERT FA Plus Culture Bottle is a modified blood culture
bottle that is different from the cleared charcoal formulation BacT/ALERT FA
Culture Bottle. The BacT/ALERT FA Plus Culture Bottles are used with the
BacT/ALERT Microbial Detection Systems in qualitative procedures for
recovery and detection of microorganisms from blood.
The predicate BacT/ALERT FA Culture Bottle contains charcoal, for its
antimicrobial neutralization properties, in a complex growth medium. Charcoal
has been eliminated in the BacT/ALERT FA Plus Culture Bottle, and is
replaced with two types of adsorbent resins in a complex growth medium.
The BacT/ALERT FA Plus Culture Bottle was modified to optimize
antimicrobial neutralization properties, and to increase the clarity of Gram
stains in comparison to the predicate BacT/ALERT FA Culture Bottle.
The BacT/ALERT Microbial Detection System provides both a microbial
detection system and a culture medium bottle with suitable nutritional and
2

--- Page 3 ---
environmental conditions for microorganisms commonly encountered in blood or
other normally sterile body fluid samples (except urine) taken from a patient
suspected of having bacteremia/fungemia. An inoculated bottle is placed into the
instrument where it is incubated and continuously monitored for the presence of
microorganisms that will grow in the BacT/ALERT bottles.
The BacT/ALERT Microbial Detection System utilizes a colorimetric sensor
and reflected light to monitor the presence and production of carbon dioxide
(CO ) that is dissolved in the culture medium. If microorganisms are present in
2
the test sample, carbon dioxide is produced as the microorganisms metabolize
the substrates in the culture medium. When growth of the microorganisms
produces CO , the color of the gas-permeable sensor installed in the bottom of
2
each culture bottle changes from blue-green to yellow. The lighter color results
in an increase of reflectance units monitored by the system. Bottle reflectance is
monitored and recorded by the instrument every 10 minutes.

L. Test Principle:
If microorganisms are present in the test sample inoculated into the BacT/ALERT®
FA Plus Culture Bottle, CO will be produced when the organisms metabolize the
2
substrates in the culture medium. The BacT/ALERT Microbial Detection System
utilizes a colorimetric sensor and reflected light to monitor the presence and
production of carbon dioxide (CO ) that is dissolved in the culture medium. If
2
microorganisms are present in the test sample, carbon dioxide is produced as the
microorganisms metabolize the substrates in the culture medium. When growth of the
microorganisms produces CO , the color of the gas-permeable sensor installed in the

results in an increase of reflectance units monitored by the system. Bottle reflectance
is monitored and recorded by the instrument every 10 minutes. An analysis of the rate
and amount of CO increase enables the BacT/ALERT Microbial Detection System to
2
determine if the bottle is positive, i.e., that the test sample contains viable
microorganisms.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
Antimicrobial Neutralization Study
An in-house study was conducted to assess the ability of the BacT/ALERT® FA
Plus Culture Bottle to recover and detect microorganisms in the presence of
antimicrobials. In this seeding study, blood containing antimicrobials, in
clinically relevant concentrations, was added directly to the BacT/ALERT® FA
Plus Culture Bottles and inoculated with susceptible strains of aerobic and
facultative anaerobic microorganisms. Antimicrobial Neutralization was tested
on at least three validation lots of FA Plus Culture Bottles. Initial testing of all
antimicrobials, or combinations of antimicrobials was done at 120% PSL. If
bottles fail to recover a microorganism for a particular
antimicrobial/microorganism combination when the antimicrobial is at 120%
PSL, that antimicrobial/microorganism pair was tested at 100% PSL or lower as
necessary to achieve 100% recovery of the organism seeded. Antimicrobials were
considered effectively neutralized by the BacT/ALERT FA Plus medium based on
100% recovery of the organisms tested at the indicated percent of peak serum
level tested. The effectiveness of the antimicrobials was confirmed by parallel
testing using a non-neutralizing culture medium as a control.
The study demonstrated that antimicrobials from the following categories were
neutralized by the BacT/ALERT® FA Plus Culture Bottle resulting in a positive
bottle signal within five days or less after inoculation: penicillins, glycylcyclines,
polyenes, macrolides, triazoles, echinocandins, aminoglycosides,
fluoroquinolones, lincosamides, glycopeptides, and oxazolidinones. Antimicrobial
neutralization was also achieved for cefazolin, cefoxitin, ceftaroline.
Antimicrobial neutralization was not achieved for ceftazidime or cefepime.
Less than complete neutralization was observed for cefotaxime and ceftriaxone.
The percent recovery varied by organism and drug concentration and required
lowering the drug concentration to levels as low as 1% of peak serum level before
observing neutralization.
The antimicrobial neutralization study results are summarized in Table 1 below.

Delayed Entry Study
A multi-center study was conducted to evaluate the effect of a delay, from the
time the BacT/ALERT® FA Plus Culture Bottle is inoculated, to the time the
bottle is placed on the instrument. This seeding study was conducted at three
study sites (one in-house, and two external sites), each using a different lot of
BacT/ALERT® FA Plus Culture Bottles. Three replicates each of 11 species at
target concentrations 100 CFU per bottle (acceptable range of 30 to 300 CFU per
bottle) were generated at three sites. Actual inoculum levels ranged from 35
CFU/bottle to 290 CFU/bottle. All bottles contained human blood from healthy
volunteers and were held at specified temperatures and times prior to loading into

the BacT/ALERT instrument. Percent recovery reflects positive flag by the
instrument and Gram stain/subculture consistent with the seeded isolation of
target organisms.
BacT/ALERT® FA Plus Culture Bottles were tested at five different combinations
of holding temperature/holding period, as indicated below, prior to be loaded on
to the instrument. This was done to evaluate the instrument’s ability to detect the
organisms within 5 days of incubation based on a panel of microorganisms that
have been seeded into simulated blood cultures.
The study demonstrated that all holding conditions showed a percent recovery of
100% except for culture bottles held at 35 to 37°C for 24 hours or longer before
loading. At this holding temperature/period combination, the FA Plus Culture
Bottles may not detect microorganisms and should be subcultured. The study
results are illustrated in Table 2 below.

minimum of two operators per site. Reproducibility was evaluated on each of
9 organisms. The reproducibility of the FA Plus Culture Bottles was evaluated
using three different instruments (one instrument per site). Three lots of FA
Plus Culture Bottles were used. For each test day/operator event, three
uninoculated (negative) control bottles were incubated along with inoculated
bottles (one for each inoculated repetition). Ten representative organisms were
evaluated by spiking each bottle. C. albicans and S. pneumoniae were seeded
into the FA Plus bottle, at a target inoculum of 100 CFU/bottle, with an
acceptable range of 30-300 CFU/bottle and the other 7 organisms at a target
range of 1-17 CFU/bottle. The actual inoculum ranged from 6 CFU/bottle to
700 CFU/bottle for the 30-300 CFU/bottle range, and from 1 CFU/bottle to
270 CFU/bottle for the 1-17 CFU/bottle range. Percent recovery reflects
positive flag by the instrument and Gram stain/subculture consistent with the
seeded organism. The study results are illustrated in Table 3 below.

Within-Laboratory Precision (Repeatability)
A repeatability study was conducted in-house to test the ability of FA Plus
culture bottles to recover and detect microorganisms in the presence of
antimicrobials to which the microorganisms are susceptible. This differs from
a limit of detection study, in which microorganism growth is not challenged
by antimicrobials. A target inoculum level of twenty five times the LoD was
used for repeatability validation. Seeded studies were conducted on multiple
instruments by multiple operators. Three replicates of each organism were
tested on each of three bottle lots for 12 days, resulting in a total of 108
replicates per organism per bottle type; replicates were tested for each
organism/antimicrobial combination. Organisms were grown in the presence
of clinically relevant concentrations of antimicrobials to which they are
susceptible. In this seeded study, BacT/ALERT FA Plus bottles were
subcultured at least 24 hours after being flagged positive by the instrument.
Results are shown in Table 4 below.

Quality Control was performed during the clinical study on each of 13
organisms listed in Table 5 below. Isolates were tested at least 20 test
sets/day, one organism/bottle) according to a rotating schedule. Growth within
48 hours for bottles was the expected result.
Isolates were prepared via serial dilution and seeded into the FA Plus bottle at
a target inoculum of 100 CFU/bottle, with an acceptable range of 30-300
CFU/bottle. Overall quality control results were found to be acceptable.
Instances where unacceptable quality control results were observed were

Stability
The sponsor conducted studies to determine stability (shelf-life).
Three lots each of FA Plus bottles produced for product validation and for
product verification were tested until they were 13 month old. At the
beginning of the study, bottles were thermally stressed, or not thermally
stressed, and then stored at either 15-30oC or 2-8oC for a total of 4
treatment/storage conditions. At each time point, growth performance,
antimicrobial neutralization, and physical parameters were evaluated. Bottles
were also tested to determine if they possessed sufficient vacuum to direct
draw 10 ml blood, and if coagulation was prevented when direct blood draw
was allowed to continue until bottle vacuum was exhausted. Initial stability
studies were conducted using a high target inoculum and were not challenging
enough based on the claimed LoD. Additional studies were conducted using
levels of organisms around the LoD using aged bottles and demonstrated that
stability can be achieved for the claimed shelf life.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Detection (LoD) performance was validated for given
organisms. LoD is defined as the lowest inoculum level for which the
detection proportion is 95%. Aerobic FA Plus bottles were inoculated
with target inocula of 5, 30, and 100 CFU/bottle and loaded into a
BacT/ALERT 3D Microbial Detection System. All testing was done
in the absence of blood with the exception of 1 ml human blood for
Haemophilus influenzae. Additional testing was performed when a
LoD of approximately 5 CFU was not obtained. A minimum of thirty
replicates were tested for each organism at each inoculum level.

Growth Performance
An in-house study analytical was conducted to assess the ability of the
BacT/ALERT® FA Plus Culture Bottle to grow and detect
microorganisms. In this seeding study, multiple strains were tested for
each species at target inoculum levels of 125 CFU per bottle which
included blood obtained from healthy human volunteers. The actual
inoculum levels ranged from 3 CFU/bottle to 298 CFU/bottle. The
species listed are representatives of clinically prevalent organisms in
blood. The data is shown in Table 7 below.

e. Analytical specificity:
Potentially Interfering Substances
The influence of potentially interfering substances was evaluated in studies
conducted in-house. Seeded studies were conducted with cerebrospinal fluid,
pleural fluid, synovial fluid, plasma, blood, and blood clots. Aliquots of each
of these fluids also received white blood cells at concentrations relevant to
bacteremia in each given body fluid. Testing was conducted with and without
microorganisms. These substances neither interfered with recovery and
detection of organisms, nor did they generate false positive results in the
absence of organisms.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A clinical study was conducted at five study centers to evaluate the clinical
performance of the BacT/ALERT FA Plus Culture Bottle using either blood
or Sterile Body Fluid (SBF) samples from adult patients suspected of having
either bloodstream or SBF bacterial/fungal infections.
Clinical Study (Blood Culture)
A multi-center clinical study was conducted at three different geographic sites
in the U.S. comparing the performance of the FA Plus and FA blood culture
bottles for aerobic culture pairs that received blood volumes between 6 ml and
10 ml (compliant pairs). A total of 1656 bottle pairs were obtained from 728
adult patients suspected of blood stream bacterial/yeast infections. Subcultures

of both bottles were performed when either bottle in the set was determined to
be positive by the BacT/ALERT system. A pair of bottles was determined to
have a positive status if the subculture of either the FA Plus or FA bottle was
positive. A culture bottle was determined to be a “True Positive” if the culture
was flagged positive by the BacT/ALERT System and resulted in growth of
the isolate upon subculture of this bottle. True positive rates were calculated
for the FA Plus and FA culture bottles, and the ratio of FA Plus true positives
to FA true positives was calculated to compare performance. Clinical isolates
recovered were classified as significant, contaminant, or unknown based on
determination by the clinical trial sites.
A total of 267 isolates were recovered from all compliant aerobic culture pairs
with a positive status. There were a total of 238 bottle pairs that recovered at
least 1 isolate by subculture of FA Plus or FA bottles. A total of 214 bottle
pairs recovered a single isolate, 19 bottle pairs recovered two isolates, and 5
bottle pairs recovered 3 isolates. The total population reported in Table 8
comprises the 267 isolates recovered from positive bottle pairs and 1418
negative bottle pairs for a total of 1685 results.
The BacT/ALERT FA Plus bottle detected a total of 208 isolates compared to
the BacT/ALERT FA bottle that detected 194 isolates. Of the significant
isolates, the BacT/ALERT FA Plus bottle detected a total of 159 isolates
compared to the BacT/ALERT FA bottle that detected 135 isolates. Five false
positives were identified by subculture of positive BacT/ALERT FA Plus
bottles and comprised 0.30% (5/1685) of the study population.
The tables below compare results of the BacT/ALERT FA Plus to
BacT/ALERT FA blood cultures for all compliant blood culture bottles that
yielded any number of isolates on subculture (Tables 8 and 9), a single isolate
alone on subculture (Table 10), and multiple isolates on subculture (Table 11).

Clinical Study Results (Sterile Body Fluids)
A multi-center clinical study was conducted at four different geographic sites
in the U.S. and Canada comparing the performance of the FA Plus and FA
culture bottles with sterile body fluid specimens (SBF). A total of 404 bottle
pairs were obtained from 369 adult patients suspected of SBF bacterial/yeast
infections. Sterile body fluid types evaluated were amniotic fluid, continuous
ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) fluid, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
peritoneal fluid, pleural fluid, and synovial fluid. Clinical isolates recovered
were classified as significant, contaminant, or unknown based on
determination by the clinical trial sites.
A total of 92 isolates were recovered from all aerobic SBF culture pairs with a
positive status. There were a total of 75 bottle pairs that recovered at least 1
isolate by subculture of FA Plus or FA bottles. A total of 62 bottle pairs
recovered a single isolate, 9 bottle pairs recovered two isolates, and 4 bottle
pairs recovered 3 isolates. The total population reported in Table 13
comprises the 92 isolates recovered from positive bottle pairs and 329
negative bottle pairs for a total of 421 results. The FA Plus bottle detected a
total of 85 isolates compared to the FA bottle that detected 67 isolates. Of the
significant isolates, the FA Plus bottle detected a total of 65 isolates compared
to the FA bottle that detected 59 isolates. No false positives were observed for
the FA Plus bottle from the study population (0/421).
