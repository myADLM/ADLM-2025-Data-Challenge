Immunoglobulin E (IgE) 510(k)s; Final Guidance for Industry and FDA.
L. Test Principle:
The allergen of interest covalently coupled to the ImmunoCAP solid phase, reacts
with the specific IgE in the patients plasma/serum sample. After washing away non-
specific IgE, enzyme-labeled antibodies against IgE are added to form a complex.
After incubation, unbound enzyme-anti-IgE is washed away and the bound complex
is then incubated with the developing agent. After stopping the reaction, the
fluorescence of the eluate is measured. The higher the response value, the more
specific IgE present in the specimen. To evaluate the rest results, the response for the
patient samples are transformed to concentrations with the use of a calibration curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
i. Within-Lot Imprecision:
Imprecision of the allergen was evaluated by using two positive plasma
samples, including a low range sample (0.35 ± 25%) and a high range
sample (≥0.7 kU /L). Each sample was tested in 4 replicates in 1 assay run
A
per day for a total of 20 operating days (a total of 80 replicates per sample).
The assay was performed according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE
Directions for Use using Phadia 250. Between-day and within-run
coefficients of variance (%CV) were calculated for each component and
each sample separately. The results are summarized in the following tables:
Sample n Mean Between Days Within Run Total
(kU /L) (CV%) (CV%) (CV%)

1 80 2.35 1.25 2.49 2.79
2 80 0.30 2.63 3.19 4.14
ii. Lot-to-Lot Imprecision:
Three different lots of the updated ImmunoCAP Allergen k82 from routine
production were tested using two positive samples (0.35 ± 25% and ≥0.7
kU /L) and one negative sample (< 0.1 kU /L). For each lot the samples

were tested in 12 replicates in one assay run. The assay was performed

according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE, Directions for Use using Phadia
250. Mean concentration values, %CV and concentration quotients between
lots were calculated for the positive samples. The acceptance criteria for
lot-to-lot precision include:
· Positive sample quotient of mean concentration: 0.7 to 1.3
· Negative sample mean concentration: < 0.1 kU/l
· CV: < 12% for sample concentrations ≥ 0.1 kU/l
The results for lot-to-lot precision study were within company’s assay

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity was assessed following the CLSI/LA20-A2 guidelines using one
lot of the updated ImmunoCAP Allergen k82, Latex. The assay was
performed according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE, Directions for Use
using instrument Phadia 250. The working range for ImmunoCAP Specific
Total IgE is LoD to 100 kU /L.

Three positive samples were each diluted in negative sample generating at
least five 2-fold consecutive dilutions (the highest level tested was 147.54
kU /L). Undiluted and diluted samples were tested in four replicates in one
A
assay run. The results of the replicates from all three samples for each level
were pooled. The observed values were graphed against the expected values
and linear regression was performed. The provided regression equation is as
follows:
y=0.98x + 0.01 (R2 = 0.99)
(95% CI for slope 0.97 to 0.98 and for intercept 0.00 to 0.03)

The IgE calibrators are traceable (via an unbroken chain of calibrations) to the
2nd International Reference Preparation (IRP) 75/502 of Human Serum
Immunoglobulin E from World Health Organization (WHO).
Stability:
The real time stability study was performed to demonstrate 24-month stability
of the updated ImmunoCAP Allergen k82, Latex at recommended storage
temperature of 2-8°C. The study was planned in accordance with CEN 13640
(Stability Testing of In Vitro Diagnostic Reagents). Three lots of the updated
ImmunoCAP Allergen k82, Latex were stored at recommended storage
temperature, 2-8°C. The assay was performed according to the ImmunoCAP
Specific IgE, Directions for Use, using Phadia 250. Two positive and one
negative control samples (stored human plasma) were tested in duplicates in
one assay at different time intervals (0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 25 months). The mean
concentrations were calculated for each sample at each test occasion. The
results were compared to the results of the same samples tested at time 0. The
results support the manufacture’s claim of 24 months stability at 2-8°C.
The stability of the calibration curve, real time, and on-board stability of
ImmunoCAP Specific IgE calibrator are detailed in k100999.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined for
the updated ImmunoCAP Allergen k82, Latex on the Phadia 250 in alignment
with CLSI EP17-A. The LoB was based on single determinations of 100
negative samples (blank samples) and was estimated as the 95% percentile of
the distribution. LoD was calculated according to the equation: LoD = LoB +
c • SD where SD, the standard deviation, was based on 20 determinations of
ß
3 low positive samples, in total 60 determinations. The results are shown in
the table below.

e. Analytical specificity:
Immunological specificity of latex allergen solution as bound to the updated
ImmunoCAP Allergen k82, Latex was verified through competitive inhibition.
The study was planned in accordance with CLSI I/LA20-A2.
The allergen solution was serially diluted with buffer to show an overall dose
dependent inhibition. A positive sample with the specific IgE concentration at
10.1 kU /L was used in the study. Equal volumes of the positive sample and
A
varying dilutions of allergen solution (inhibitor) were premixed. The mixture

was incubated in a sample tube at room temperature for 1 hour before being
analyzed with ImmunoCAP Allergen k82, Latex on Phadia 250 according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. The testing was performed in duplicates in
one assay run. Mean values were calculated.
The inhibition test was evaluated with inhibition values in %, calculated
according to the formula below:
æ ær-böö
ç ç1-ç ÷÷ ÷´100=i%
è èt-bøø
r = response [RU]
b = background response (100% inhibition) [RU]
t = total response (0% inhibition) [RU]
i = inhibition
Any negative inhibition %-values are shown as 0% inhibition.
The results of inhibitions study showed that about 50% inhibition was
achieved with related inhibitor (k82, Latex) at a final inhibitor concentration
of ~3.4 µg/mL. The inhibition studies using four unrelated inhibitors,
including three from unrelated groups (Aspergillus terreus, Storage mite, and
Sunflower) and one from the related/same group (k84, Sunflower seed) did
not show any significant inhibition at 3.4 mg/mL inhibitor concentration. The
inhibition studies indicate that the ImmunoCAP Allergen k82, Latex solid
phase contains the immunologically relevant allergen.
f. Assay cut-off:

at least the same as the currently cleared device with no detectable levels of
specific IgE in samples from healthy, non-atopic donors. Seventy-five (75)
clinical and 100 negative samples were tested with the updated and the
currently cleared ImmunoCAP Allergen k82, Latex. The clinical samples
were defined as samples from individuals with a clinical history of allergy-
like symptoms upon exposure to the specific allergen, as diagnosed by a
physician. Negative samples were collected from healthy non-atopic donors.
The samples were tested in singlicate using ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Assay
on Phadia 250. One lot of the updated and one lot of currently cleared
ImmunoCAP Allergen k82, Latex were used in the study. The results for the
updated ImmunoCAP Allergen k82, Latex are shown in the table below:

By using relevant clinical samples, the updated ImmunoCAP Allergen k82,
Latex showed higher sensitivity [100% (75/75)] compared to the currently
cleared product [96% (72/75)]. No specific IgE antibodies to the updated
ImmunoCAP Allergen k82, Latex were detected with samples from healthy,
non-atopic donors.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected value is negative (< 0.35 kU /L) for a specific allergen in a non-
A
allergic person. The manufacturer recommends a cut-off of 0.35 kU /L. Each
A
laboratory should establish its own expected range of values.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
