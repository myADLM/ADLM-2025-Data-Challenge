Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline
CLSI EP25-A Methods, Evaluation of Stability of In vitro Diagnostic Reagents;
Approved Guideline
L. Test Principle:
Eurotrol Hct Control and epoc® Hematocrit Verification Fluids are electrolyte
solutions with conductivity at three and five levels respectively, appropriate to
simulate clinically relevant hematocrit concentrations useful to evaluate the
measurement of the epoc® Blood Analysis System.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Data were collected internally and at two external sites across different epoc
Blood Analysis systems (i.e. Epocal epoc reader and Epocal epoc cartridge). Each
study site performed two runs per day in duplicate for 20 distinct days on different
epoc® Blood Analysis systems using 3 lots of the 3 levels of Eurotrol Hct Control
and 5 levels of epoc® Hematocrit Verification Fluids. Acceptance criterion was
predetermined to be ≤9.0% CV for the total variance which was based on
compilation of the CV% for Hct Control and epoc® Hematocrit Verification
Fluids at the different levels. Results collected across the three manufactured lots
of Hct Control and epoc® Hematocrit Verification Fluids demonstrated consistent
recovery across multiple Epocal epoc® Blood Analysis System at multiple study
sites and were within the specified assay assignment ranges.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Value assignment:
Value assignment is performed in two steps. The initial step is a quality
control calculation of gravimetric values and measurements on different
instruments at Eurotrol B.V to verify if the fluid has been manufactured
within acceptable ranges. Final value assignment is performed using the
BGEM cards and the epoc® Blood Analysis system to obtain values for end
users. The value assignment is performed for each new fluid lot of Eurotrol
Hct Control and epoc® Hematocrit Verification Fluids and on existing fluid
lots after release of each new epoc System sensor configuration. Assigned
values are only applicable for the particular epoc System Sensor
Configuration.
Closed-vial Stability:
To demonstrate the shelf life of Eurotrol Hct Control and epoc® Hematocrit
Verification Fluids, multiple ampules of batches from all levels and stored at
temperatures between 15-30°C for 3 months. Hematocrit/conductivity values
are measured at the following time points (0, 3, 6, 7 months). Results are
analyzed using the measurand drift analysis method according to CLSI EP25-
A using a 95% confidence interval (CI). The acceptance criterion is based on
±5% maximum allowed relative deviation from the mean. Real time stability
studies are- ongoing at time of clearance; however sponsor has provided data
that supports 3 months stability.
Open-ampule stability: The claimed stability for opened ampules is 15 minutes at
room temperature.
d. Detection limit:
