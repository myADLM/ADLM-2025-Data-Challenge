G. Intended Use:
1. Indication(s) for Use:
The Virtuoso system provides automated digital slide creation, management, analysis,
and viewing. It is intended for in vitro diagnostic use as an aid to the pathologist in the
display, detection, counting, review and classification of tissues and cells of clinical
interest based on particular morphology, color, intensity, size, pattern and shape.
The Virtuoso™ System for IHC HER2 (4B5) is for digital read and image analysis
applications. This particular Virtuoso system is intended for use as an aid to the
pathologist in the detection and semi-quantitative measurement of HER2 protein in
2

formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded normal and neoplastic tissue. This device is an
accessory to Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. PATHWAY® anti-HER2/neu (4B5) Rabbit
Monoclonal Primary Antibody. The PATHWAY® anti-HER2/neu (4B5) Rabbit
Monoclonal Primary Antibody is indicated for use as an aid in the assessment of breast
cancer patients for whom HERCEPTIN® (Trastuzumab) treatment is being considered.
NOTE: The IHC HER2 4B5 Digital Read and Image Analysis applications are
adjunctive computer-assisted methodologies for the qualified pathologist in the
acquisition and measurement of images from microscope glass slides of breast cancer
specimens stained for the presence of HER-2/neu receptor protein. The pathologist
should verify agreement with the Image Analysis software application score. The
accuracy of the test results depends on the quality of the immunohistochemical staining.
It is the responsibility of a qualified pathologist to employ appropriate morphological
studies and controls as specified in the instructions for the PATHWAY® anti-HER-2/neu
(4B5) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody assay used to assure the validity of the iScan
System for IHC HER2 4B5 Digital Read and Image Analysis scores. The actual
correlation of PATHWAY® anti-HER-2/neu (4B5) to clinical outcome has not been
established.
2. Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
For prescription use only
Indicated for use with either the Benchmark XT or ULTRA™ stainers.
* A precautionary statement indicating that this device has not been tested, or its safety
and effectiveness validated, when used with a personal computer (PC) from home was
included in the Limitations section of the device package insert.
H. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate Device Name(s) and 510(k) number(s):

a. Accuracy:
The performance of the Virtuoso™ System for HER2 (4B5) when used in
conjunction with the Benchmark ULTRA™ stainer was validated by assessing the
positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), and overall
percent agreement (OPA) between the reference manual method (with a traditional
microscope) and both the digital read (DR) and image analysis (IA) applications of
the Virtuoso™ system. Patient slides were scored as positive or negative for HER2
status defining negative as 0 and 1+ and positive as 2+ and 3+.
Concordance with manual scoring was assessed between scores assigned to 120
specimens for both digital reads and image analysis. For digital reads, only 106
specimens were analyzed due to quality control failures. Concordance of digital
reads and image analysis with manual scoring was assessed at one site. The
agreements with the 95% confidence intervals (CI) around the agreements are shown
below. All confidence intervals are 2-sided 95% confidence intervals calculated
using the score method.

using two Ventana DAB detection kits (iVIEW™ vs. ultraView™). Reanalysis of
the results summarized in the two tables above by stratification by detection kit also
yielded results that met the pre-established acceptance criteria.
Precision/Reproducibility:
