I. Device Description:
The Cepheid Xpert GBS LB Assay is an automated in vitro diagnostic DNA test for the
qualitative detection of Group B Streptococcus (GBS, S. agalactiae) DNA from enriched
vaginal/rectal swab specimens, using fully automated real-time polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) with fluorogenic detection of the amplified DNA. The assay is performed on the
Cepheid GeneXpert® Instrument Systems.
The GeneXpert Instrument Systems automate and integrate sample lysis, nucleic acid
purification and amplification, and detection of the target sequence in complex samples using
real-time PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) assays. The GeneXpert Instrument System family
comprises a GeneXpert Dx instrument (GX-I, GX-IV, GX-XVI), the GeneXpert Dx XVI
available with 4, 8, 12, or 16 modules; a GeneXpert Infinity-48, available with 16, 24, 32, 40
or 48 modules, or a GeneXpert Infinity-80 available with 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, or 80
modules. The individual testing modules are identical for all instrument systems. The
instrument systems also contain a computer, and preloaded software for running tests and
viewing the results. The GeneXpert Infinity Systems contain robotic features for cartridge
handling.
The Xpert GBS LB Assay includes reagents pre-loaded in the Xpert GBS LB cartridge for
the simultaneous detection of the target GBS DNA. A Sample Processing Control (SPC), an
Internal Control (IC) and a Probe Check Control (PCC) are also included in the cartridge.
The SPC is present to control for adequate processing of the target DNA; the IC is present to
monitor the presence of inhibitors in the PCR reaction. The PCC verifies reagent rehydration,
PCR-tube filling in the cartridge, probe integrity, and dye stability. The GBS primers and
probe detect a target within a 3´ DNA region adjacent to the cfb gene of S. agalactiae.
After collecting and transporting a swab sample to the laboratory, the swab is placed in Lim
broth for enrichment overnight, after which a clean swab (Cepheid part number SDPS-120)
dipped into the enrichment broth specimen is transferred to the designated chamber of the
cartridge. The GeneXpert Instrument System performs sample preparation by eluting the
specimen material from the swab, mixing the sample with the SPC (Bacillus globigii in the
form of a bead within the cartridge) and treatment reagent, capturing cellular material on a
3

--- Page 4 ---
filter, lysing the cells, and eluting the DNA. The DNA solution is then mixed with dry PCR
reagents and transferred into the integrated reaction tube for real-time PCR and detection.
The results are interpolated by the GeneXpert Instrument Systems from measured fluorescent
signals and embedded calculation algorithms. Results may be viewed and printed. The test
process takes approximately 55 minutes. Sample preparation, amplification, and real-time
detection are all fully automated and completely integrated.

L. Test Principle:
The GeneXpert instrument systems automate and integrate sample lysis, nucleic acid
purification and amplification, and detection of the target sequence in complex samples using
real-time and reverse transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and PCR assays.
The systems consist of an instrument, personal computer, and preloaded software for running
tests and viewing the results. The systems require the use of single-use disposable GeneXpert
cartridges that hold the PCR reagents and host the PCR process. Because the cartridges are
self-contained, cross-contamination concerns are minimized.
The Xpert GBS LB Assay includes reagents for the simultaneous detection of the target GBS
DNA, a sample-processing control (SPC) to monitor processing conditions, and an internal
control (IC) to monitor PCR conditions and the absence of reaction inhibition. The probe
check feature verifies reagent rehydration, PCR-tube filling in the cartridge, probe integrity,
and dye stability. The GBS primers and probe detect a target within a 3´ DNA region
adjacent to the cfb gene of S. agalactiae.
After collecting and transporting a swab sample to the laboratory, the swab is placed in Lim
broth for enrichment overnight at 35° – 37°C. A clean swab is dipped into the Lim broth after
enrichment and is then transferred to the designated chamber of the cartridge. The GeneXpert
System performs sample preparation by eluting the specimen material from the swab, mixing
the sample reagent with the SPC (Bacillus globigii in the form of a bead within the cartridge)
and treatment reagent, capturing cellular material on a filter, lysing the cells, and eluting the
6

--- Page 7 ---
DNA. The DNA solution is then mixed with dry PCR reagents and transferred into the
integrated reaction tube for real-time PCR and detection. The results are interpolated by the
GeneXpert System from measured fluorescent signals and embedded calculation algorithms.
Results may be viewed and may be printed. The test process takes approximately 55 minutes
or less.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility Study: A panel of seven samples with varying concentrations of two
different GBS strains (ATCC # 13813 GBS Type II and ATCC # 49446 GBS Type
IV) were tested by 2 operators each in triplicate on 5 different days at 3 sites for a
total of 90 replicates tested for each sample (7 panel members x 2 operators x 3
times/day x 5 days x 3 sites). One lot of Xpert GBS LB was used at each of the 3
testing sites. Testing of the Xpert GBS LB Assays was performed on the GeneXpert
Infinity-48 at Site 1, GeneXpert Dx at Site 2 and GeneXpert Infinity-80 at Site 3.
Known concentrations of GBS cell stocks were serially diluted in a simulated
background matrix to achieve moderate positive (~3-4 X LOD) and low positive
(~1X LOD) concentrations. The high negative samples were prepared by further
diluting "low positive" samples to a concentration below the LoD such that results of
repeated tests would be negative approximately 20% to 80% of the time. All study
participants were blinded to the identity and expected result for each sample.
External negative and GBS positive controls were run on each day that samples were
tested. Study samples were not run until correct results were obtained for both the
negative and positive controls.
Xpert GBS LB testing yielded initial valid results 95.6% of the time with 10 ERROR
and 18 NO RESULT outcomes for which repeat testing was performed. Twenty
seven of 28 repeated tests yielded valid results with an overall rate of assay success in
this study of 99.8% (629/630.)
All of the negative (89/89) study samples were correctly classified as negative. All of
the moderate positives for both GBS strains 1 and Strain 2 (90/90) study samples
were correctly classified as positive. The low positive samples were prepared at
concentrations near the LoD to target a positive result ~95% of the time. The GBS
strain 1 low positive samples yielded a positive result in 98.9% (89/90) of the runs.
The GBS strain 2 low positive samples yielded a positive result in 100.0% (90/90) of
the runs.

--- Page 8 ---
The high negative samples were prepared to target a negative result ~ 20% to 80% of
the time. The GBS strain 1 high negative samples yielded a negative result in 72.2%
(65/90) of the runs. The GBS strain 2 high negative sample yielded a negative result
in 80.0% (72/90) of the runs. The results are summarized by instrument in the
following table.

Precision Study:
An in-house precision study was conducted to compare the performance of the
GeneXpert D and the Infinity-80 instrument systems. A panel of 7 samples with
varying concentrations of 2 different GBS strains (ATCC # 13813 GBS Type II and
ATCC # 49446 GBS Type IV) was tested on 12 different days by 2 operators. The 7
panel members used for this study contained the same organisms and concentration
levels and were prepared in the same manner as those used in the reproducibility
study. Each operator conducted 4 runs of each panel specimen per day on each of the
2 instrument systems (7 specimens x 4 times/ day x 12 days x 2 operators x 2
instrument systems). One lot of Xpert GBS LB Assay was used for the study. All
study participants were blinded to the identity and expected result for each sample.
For the panel specimens, the cartridges were prepared by adding the sample
according to instructions in the package insert instructions. The prepared cartridges
were then subjected to an upfront hold time of 60 minutes (maximum hold time
allowed by the system) before analyzing on each platform. For the GeneXpert,
cartridges were loaded into the appropriate module and the test was initiated 60
minutes after cartridge preparation. For the Infinity, the prepared cartridges were

scanned on the barcode reader, placed onto the accumulator belt, and the test initiated
60 minutes after preparation. In addition to challenging both instruments with the 60
minute delay in test initiation, this precision study was designed to challenge the
“worst case” situation for the Infinity-80 System which entailed loading of test
cartridges continuously (28 plus 28) by the 2 operators onto the Infinity instrument
conveyor belt.
External negative and GBS positive controls were run by each operator on each day
that samples were tested. Study samples were not run until correct results were
obtained for both the negative and positive controls.
Xpert GBS LB assays for 99.1% (1332/1344) of samples were successful on the first
attempt. All 12 samples that gave error or invalid results yielded expected results
upon repeat testing. All negative samples yielded negative results and all moderate
positive samples yielded positive results as expected. The low positive samples which
were prepared at a ~1X LoD concentration level, yielded positive results for strain #1
100% of the time and for strain #2, 98.4% of the time. The high negative samples
were prepared at a concentration level that would produce negative results
approximately 20-80% of the time. GBS strain #1 produced a negative result in
76.6% of tests and strain 2, 83.9% of tests.
Results from this study demonstrated that there were no significant differences in
assay performance between the 2 instrument systems for any of the panel
concentration levels. The study results validated the potential worst case sample
hold times (maximum wait time of one hour) on the Infinity System. Results from
this study are summarized by instrument in the following table.

Vaginal/rectal swab stability: The stability of vaginal/rectal swab specimens was
evaluated at room temperature for up to 24 hours and up to 7 days at 2-8ºC.
Positive and negative swab samples were prepared using a background matrix. Two
serotypes of GBS were evaluated with positive samples containing 5x the LoD of
the Xpert GBS LB assay. Swabs were stored at 2ºC, 8ºC and 25ºC for the claimed
storage times, followed by inoculation and incubation of Lim broths. A total of 325
tests were performed on 15 Xpert instruments. Under the conditions of this study,
all positive and negative swab samples were identified correctly, and there was no
significant difference in performance at any time point tested.

Lim Broth Stability: The stability of enriched Lim broths was evaluated at T=0 and
daily after storage of up to 4 days after storage at 2ºC, 8ºC, and 25ºC followed by
testing with the Xpert GBS LB assay. Two serotypes of GBS were evaluated with
preparation of positive samples using swabs spiked with background matrix and
GBS organisms at 5x the LoD, followed by placement into Lim broth media.
Negative swab samples were prepared with matrix and placed into Lim broth for
incubation. Lim broth samples were incubated for 18 hours at 35ºC and then
aliquotted and stored at 2ºC, 8ºC, and 25ºC for the specified storage times. A total
of 205 tests were performed in this study resulting in all positive (both Serotypes II
and IV) and negative specimens correctly identified using the Xpert GBS LB Assay
for up to 4 days of storage at 2-8ºC. No significant difference in results was
observed between serotypes, storage temperatures, or storage times.
For the most extreme storage conditions (swab storage at 2-8ºC for 7 days followed
by storage of the enriched Lim broth at 2ºC for 4 days before testing with the Xpert
GBS LB assay), a total of 36 samples were tested with all tests yielding correct
results and no significant difference in results.
Cartridge Hold Time Stability for Infinity Instruments: An analytical study was
performed to evaluate the maximum cartridge hold time of one hour for the GBS
LB Assay product between sample addition and cartridge processing. Positive
samples were prepared using GBS diluted in Lim broth with background matrix to
simulate clinical samples. Negative samples consisted of background matrix in Lim
broth. A total of 288 tests were performed at T=0 and T= 1 hour and all completed
positive and negative specimens were correctly identified using the Xpert GBS LB
Assay. There was no significant difference in results between testing at T= 0 versus
T=1 hour. The data from this study supports a 1 hour maximum hold time for
inoculated Xpert GBS LB cartridges prior to testing on the Infinity Instruments.
Controls
Sample Processing Control (SPC): The SPC verifies that specimen processing is
adequate for each cartridge tested. The SPC which is included in each cartridge
consists of the organism Bacillus globigii in the form of a dry bead. The SPC
PASSES if a valid cycle threshold (Ct) is generated in a negative sample. The SPC
may not amplify in a high-positive specimen. If the SPC fails, the test result will be
INVALID and the test should be repeated.
Internal Control (IC): The IC is present in each reaction to verify functional
PCR reagents and the absence of inhibition that may prevent PCR amplification.
In any test, where the GBS result is negative, the growth curve for the IC must
meet specific criteria of cycle threshold (Ct) value and Endpoint Fluorescence
(EPF) value to be considered acceptable. If the IC fails, the test result will be
INVALID and the test should be repeated.
Probe Check Control (PCC): Before the start of the PCR reaction, the GeneXpert
17

--- Page 18 ---
Instrument System measures the fluorescence signal from the probes to monitor
bead rehydration, reaction-tube filling, probe integrity and dye stability.
Fluorescence readings are obtained at multiple temperatures. These readings are
then compared to default settings established by Cepheid. The PCC is considered to
PASS if the fluorescence generated meets the validated acceptance criteria. If the
PCC fails for GBS target, IC or SPC, a probe check error is reported and the
specimen should be retested.
External Controls: One external positive control (NATtrol positive, S. agalactiae) and
one external negative control (NATtrol negative, L. acidophilus) were run on each
day of the analytical and clinical studies. Testing with the Xpert GBS LB assay was
not performed until these external controls provided the expected correct results.
d. Detection limit:
A study was performed to determine the limit of detection (LoD) of the Xpert GBS
LB Assay with 11 GBS strains representing 9 known GBS serotypes. The LoD is
defined as the number of colony forming units (CFU/ml) of GBS that can be
reproducibly distinguished from negative samples with 95% confidence or the lowest
concentration at which a minimum of 19 of 20 replicates were positive.
The strains tested were diluted into a simulated sample matrix. The LoD was
determined by testing a total of 20 replicates at 3-4 concentrations per strain as well
as testing 20 negative samples. All concentrations were verified by plating on Tryptic
Soy Agar plates incubated at 37ºC for 18-24 hours.
Testing of all 11 GBS isolates yielded positive results as expected, confirming
analytical inclusivity. The estimated LoD and confidence intervals were determined
using logistic regression over a range of 3-4 concentrations (CFU/mL.)
The LoD was determined to be 333 CFU/mL for 8 of 11 strains tested. The LoD for 3
additional strains was determined to be 173 CFU/mL, 76 CFU/mL, and 133 CFU/mL.
The confirmed LoD and LoD point estimates with 95% upper and lower confidence
intervals for each strain tested are provided in the following table.

e. Inclusivity
See LoD studies above.
f. Interference
The potentially interfering endogenous and exogenous substances listed in the table
below were tested in an analytical study. Substances were tested at concentrations
close to saturation.
Negative samples (n = 8) were tested per substance to determine the effect on the
performance of the sample processing control (SPC) and internal control (IC).
Positive samples (n=8) were tested per substance with 2 GBS serotypes (II and
IV) at 2 levels: 3X (75 CFU/swab) and 5X (125 CFU/swab) the LoD. Statistical
significance was determined by comparing cycle threshold (Ct) values from tests
run in the presence and in the absence of each substance.
Results of the study yielded no significant inhibitory effects for both GBS negative
and GBS positive specimens in the presence of any of the interfering substances. All
replicates of positive specimens using GBS serotype II and IV were correctly
reported as GBS POSITIVE at GBS levels 3X and 5X LoD using the Xpert GBS LB
Assay. All GBS-negative specimens yielded the correct negative result.
The lubricating gel had an inhibitory effect on the performance of the SPC in
negative samples (average Ct of 35.9 for sample with lubricating gel versus 32.6 for
the Lim Broth Control); however, correct assay results for both positive and negative
samples were obtained.

h. Assay cut-off:
The valid minimum cycle threshold setting for the GBS target is 15 and the earliest
GBS Ct reported from positive results during pre-clinical testing was greater than 15
cycles. The valid maximum cycle threshold setting for the GBS target is 42. To obtain
a valid GBS Positive test results, the GBS Ct must be reported within the valid cycle
range (Ct = 15 – 42) and the GBS fluorescent signal must be higher than the
fluorescence unit threshold. To obtain a valid GBS negative test result, the GBS Ct
must not be reported within the valid cycle range and the SPC Ct and IC Ct must be
reported within their valid cycle range. Pre-clinical results from 235 samples were
used to set these cutoffs. Assay settings were chosen to maximize the sensitivity
(highest priority) and specificity of the assay. Upper and lower assay cutoffs of Ct =
15 and Ct = 42 were subsequently validated in the pivotal clinical study using
receiver operator characteristics analysis.
2. Comparison studies
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable, performance of the assay was evaluated in comparison to the gold
standard/reference method (Lim broth culture).
b. Matrix comparison: Evaluation of Different Enrichment Media
Two additional enrichment broths (Trans-Vag Broth (Todd Hewitt Broth
w/Gentamicin and Naladixic acid), and Strep B Carrot broth) were tested in an
analytical study. GBS Serotypes II and IV were tested at 5X LoD in Lim broth,
Trans-Vag broth, and Carrot broth that had been incubated with simulated
background matrix for 18 hours at 35C. Negative samples consisted of background
matrix only. Replicates of eight positive and negative samples were run for each broth
and serotype. All positive and negative specimens were correctly identified by the
Xpert GBS LB Assay. The average Ct and fluorescent values for GBS, SPC, and IC
were compared for each enrichment broth tested. No statistically significant
differences were observed in the analytical performance of the Xpert GBS LB assay
with Lim Broth, Carrot broth, or TransVag broth media.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Prospective Clinical Studies:
Performance characteristics of the Xpert GBS LB Assay were evaluated at 3
institutions in the U.S. using the GeneXpert Dx, Infinity-48, and the Infinity-80
instrument systems. Subjects included individuals whose routine care called for
collection of vaginal/rectal swab specimens for GBS testing. Prospectively collected
and tested specimens consisted of excess leftover deidentified enriched Lim Broth
22

--- Page 23 ---
specimens collected for standard of care antepartum GBS testing from women at 35-
37 weeks gestation.
Specimens were collected using a double swab per physician's orders for antepartum
GBS testing. Swab 1 was placed in Lim broth for overnight incubation. Swab 2 used
for additional testing was not related to this submission. After enrichment, an aliquot
of the Lim broth was used for standard of care testing. The leftover Lim broth was
used for Xpert GBS LB and for the reference culture testing.
External positive and negative quality control samples were tested daily during the
clinical studies. Study specimens were not run until correct results were obtained with
both external controls.
In the event of indeterminate results (INVALID, ERROR, or NO RESULT), a
single retest of the Lim Broth specimen was performed. If the repeat test result was
also indeterminate, it was reported as such. If the repeat test result generated a valid
result, the result was reported.
The Xpert GBS LB Assay performance was compared to the reference culture
procedure consisting of Lim Broth enrichment of the vaginal/rectal swab by
incubating for 18 to 24 hours at 35-37ºC. Enriched Lim broths were then subcultured
to 5% sheep blood agar plates and incubated for 18-24 hours at 35-37ºC with 5%
CO . Plates with no GBS colonies at 24 hours were incubated for an additional 24
2
hours before being called negative. Suspected GBS colonies (both hemolytic and non-
hemolytic) were tested with catalase reagent and gram stained. Catalase negative,
gram-positive cocci were then confirmed by latex agglutination.
A total of 826 specimens meeting the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria
were tested for GBS by the Xpert GBS LB Assay and culture. Xpert GBS LB
Assays for 98.1% (810/826) of eligible specimens were successful on the first
attempt. The indeterminate cases included seven ERROR results, two INVALID
results, and two NO RESULT outcomes. All of the 16 indeterminate cases were
retested and yielded valid results upon repeat assay. The overall rate of assay
success was 100% (826/826).
The Xpert GBS LB Assay demonstrated an overall sensitivity and specificity for
detection GBS colonization of 99.0% and 92.4%, respectively, relative to Lim broth
culture.

Assay Overall
Performance vs. Culture
aTesting result by sequencing: 47 of 48 GBS specimens were sequenced, 42 were GBS positive, 5 were GBS negative and one
Lim broth was not sequenced.
bTesting result by sequencing: 2 of 2 GBS specimens were sequenced, both were GBS negative.
Bi-directional sequencing of Lim broth specimens using different primers than those in
the Xpert GBS LB assay was performed on specimens with discrepant results. Of the
specimens that yielded a false positive result with the Xpert GBS LB assay as
compared to the reference culture, 47/48 specimens were tested by bi-directional
sequencing. Testing resulted in 42 GBS positive and 5 GBS negative. One discrepant
specimen was not tested. Two specimens that yielded false negative results with the
Xpert GBS LB assay as compared to the reference culture were also tested by bi-
directional sequencing. Both specimens yielded a negative result. Results of the
additional testing are presented as additional supportive information as footnotes under
the performance table above and in the package insert.
