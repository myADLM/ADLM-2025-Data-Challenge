4. Special instrument Requirements:
Not Applicable
I. Device Description:
The VITEK® 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of
the doubling dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC). Each VITEK® 2 AST card contains 64 micro wells. A
control well, which contains only microbiological culture media, is present on all
cards. The remaining wells contain premeasured portions of specific antibiotics
in a culture media base. The bacterial isolate to be tested is diluted to a
standardized concentration with 0.45-0.5% saline before being used to rehydrate
the antimicrobial medium in the wells in the card. The VITEK® 2 System
automatically fills seals and places the card into the incubator/reader. With
VITEK® 2 Compact the filling, sealing and loading of the card is done manually.
The VITEK® 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period of time. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is
generated which includes the MIC value and the result interpretation for each
antibiotic.
The VITEK® 2 Gram Negative Doxycycline has the following concentrations in
the card: 1, 4, and 16 μg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by
efficacy in μg/mL). The MIC result range for the VITEK® 2 cared is 0.5 – 16
μg/mL.

L. Test Principle:
Each VITEK®2 test card contains 64 microwells. A control well, that contains only
microbiological culture medium is resident on all cards, with the remaining wells
containing premeasured amounts of a specific antibiotic combined with culture
medium. A suspension of organism is made in 0.45-0.5% sterile saline from a pure
culture and standardized to a McFarland 0.5 standard using the DensiChek. The
desired card(s) are placed in the cassette along with an empty tube for the
susceptibility card. The cassette is placed in the VITEK®2 instrument where a
susceptibility test will be automatically diluted from the ID suspension by the
VITEK®2. The cards are then automatically vacuum filled; the tubes are cut and the
cards sealed prior to proceeding to the Incubator Loading Station. Cards are then
transferred from the cassette into the carousel for incubation (35.5o C) and optical
scanning during testing. Readings are performed every 15 minutes.
In addition to the automatic dilution, there is also a manual inoculation dilution
procedure described in the packager insert.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Studies were conducted to evaluate a Doxycycline susceptibility panel.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using 10 isolates at three sites on three
separate days in triplicates. The study included the Auto-dilution and the
Manual dilution for VITEK 2 and Manual dilution for VITEK 2 Compact.
All results demonstrated >95% reproducibility.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A clinical study was performed at three external sites using the VITEK
2 AST-GN Doxycycline and broth microdilution panels containing
Doxycycline. The study included 409 clinical isolates and a challenge
set of 98 isolates. The vast majority of clinical isolates were fresh
(stock isolates represented 2.2%). Clinical isolates were composed of
306 species included in the IFU and 103 other Enterobacteriaceae
isolates within the spectrum of Doxycycline.
Testing of the clinical isolates was performed using the automated
method of inoculation. Performance data comparing the VITEK 2
AST-GN Doxycycline and the reference method is illustrated in the
tables below. Testing of challenge isolates was conducted at one
external site and was performed using both auto-dilution and manual
dilution method. As is illustrated in the tables below, no difference
was noted in the device performance between the two types of dilution
methods.
