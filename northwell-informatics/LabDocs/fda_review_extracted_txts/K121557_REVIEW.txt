Wondfo Cannabinoids Urine Test is an immunochromatographic assay for the
qualitative determination of 11-nor-Δ9-THC-9-COOH (major metabolite of
Cannabinoids) in human urine at a cutoff concentration of 50 ng/mL. The test is
available in a dip card format and a cup format. It is intended for prescription use
and over the counter use.
The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative
chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result.
GC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and
professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result,
particularly when the preliminary result is positive.
Wondfo Propoxyphene Urine Test
Wondfo Propoxyphene Urine Test is an immunochromatographic assay for the
qualitative determination of d-Propoxyphene in human urine at a cutoff
concentration of 300 ng/mL. The test is available in a dip card format and a cup
format. It is intended for prescription use.
The test provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative
chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result.
GC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and
professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result,
particularly when the preliminary result is positive.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription and over the counter use for Cannabinoids.
For prescription use for Propoxyphene. Propoxyphene has not been evaluated for
Point-of-care use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable, as the device is a visually-read single-use device
I. Device Description:
The devices are for use in human urine in dip card and cup formats. The Dip Card
and Cup Tests are single-test test strips. The Dip Card and Cup Tests contain test dip
card or cup and package insert (instructions for use). Both devices are single-use and
visually read.

L. Test Principle:
The Wondfo Cannabinoids Urine Test and Wondfo Propoxyphene Urine Test are
immunochromatographic assay for Cannabinoids and Propoxyphene Urine test using
a lateral flow, one step system for the qualitative detection of 11-nor-Δ9-THC-9-
COOH and d-Propoxyphene in human urine. Each assay uses a mouse monoclonal
antibody-dye conjugate against drug with gold chloride and fixed drug-protein
conjugate and anti-mouse IgG polycolonal antibody in membrane.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed using drug free urine spiked to the following
concentrations: 0, +100%, +/-75% of cutoff, +/- 50% of cutoff, +/-25% of
cutoff for each analyte and each device. The samples were aliquots, coded,
randomized and blinded. Testing was performed twice a day for twenty-five
days by three operators. Three different lot numbers for each device were used
for the study. A total of 50 determinations were made at each concentration
and each lot. Sample concentrations were confirmed by GC/MS. The results
are displayed in the tables below:

acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. The
manufacturer claims the following expiration date: The Wondfo Cannabinoids
Urine Test and Wondfo Propoxyphene Urine Test unopened stability is 18
months for both formats (cup and dip card) when stored at 4-30º C.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical performance of the device around the cutoff is described in Section f.
(Assay cut-off) below.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was established by spiking similarly structured compounds
into drug free urine at various concentrations. These solutions were tested
using 3 lots/device (dip card and cup). Results are expressed as a minimum
concentration of metabolite or compound required to produce a response
approximately equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the assay. Both
devices produced similar results. The percent cross-reactivity of those
compounds are presented below:

Evaluation of SG and pH on test results:
To evaluate the effect of pH value on the test results, a negative urine sample
were adjusted to pH levels 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0 and 9.0.The samples were
then spiked with each drug at +/-25% of the cutoff values. Testing was
performed on 3 lots/device (dip card and cup).
To evaluate the effect of specific gravity, 12 urine samples having specific
gravities of 1.000, 1.003, 1.007, 1.008, 1.017, 1.019, 1.020, 1.025, and 1.030,
1.031, 1.033 and 1.035 were spiked with each drug at +/-25% of the cut-off
values. Testing was performed on 3 lots/device (dip card and cup).
The testing results demonstrate that varying pHs and specific gravities do not
affect urine testing results around each analyte cut-off.
f. Assay cut-off:
Cutoff studies were performed for cannabinoids and propoxyphene using a
combination of clinical and spiked samples for each drug (n=150 per drug).
The testing protocol was identical for each drug.
25 clinical samples were collected for each drug. Concentrations of
cannabinoids and propoxyphene in the samples were determined by GC/MS.
An additional 125 drug free negative samples were obtained for each drug and
spiked with either cannabinoids and propoxyphene at -50% cutoff, -25%
cutoff, cutoff, +25% cutoff, and +50 % cutoff. 5 clinical samples and 25
spiked samples were tested at each concentration for each drug in replicates of
30 using three lots and 3 operators (n=270). Results are summarized below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison for the Wondfo Cannabinoids Urine Test and
Wondfo Propoxyphene Urine Test was performed in-house with three
laboratory assistants with relevant experience and a lay person with no
experience other than reading the instructions for use. Operators ran 80 (40
negative and 40 positive) unaltered clinical samples. The samples were blind
labeled and compared to GC/MS results. The results are presented in the table
below:

Lay-user study for Cannabinoids
Test Cup format:
A lay user study was performed at three intended user sites with 140 lay persons.
Participants in the study were 66 females and 74 males tested the cannabinoids samples.
They had diverse educational and professional backgrounds and ranged in age from 21 to
>50. Urine samples were prepared at the following concentrations; negative, +/-75%, +/-
50%, +/-25% of the cutoff by spiking drug(s) into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The
concentrations of the samples were confirmed by GC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted
into individual containers and blind-labeled. Each participant was provided with the
package insert, 1 blind labeled samples and a device. The results are summarized below.

All study participants completed questionnaires after the performed the test and recorded
their results. The questionnaires covered evaluation of the package insert regarding
expiration date of the device, storage, the directions for performing the test, the ease of
performing the test, directions for interpreting the results, and ease of interpretation of the
results. These questionnaires demonstrated that the test instructions were easy to
understand and that the testing procedure was easy to perform and the results were easy
to read.
