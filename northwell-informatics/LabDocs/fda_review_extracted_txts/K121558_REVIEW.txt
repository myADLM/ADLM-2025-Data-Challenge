L. Test Principle:
Diazyme’s hsCRP POC Test Kit is based on a latex enhanced
immunoturbidimetric assay on Diazyme’s SMART analyzer. (The SMART
Analyzer was cleared under k092911). When an antigen-antibody reaction occurs
between CRP in a sample and anti-CRP which has been sensitized to latex
particles agglutination results. This agglutination is detected as an absorbance
change (700 nm), with the magnitude of the change being proportional to the
quantity of CRP in the sample. The instrument calculates the CRP concentration
of patient specimen by use of a lot specific calibration curve that is stored in an
RFID card provided with each hsCRP POC kit. The RFID card is inserted in the
SMART analyzer and is needed for every single run.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A set of eleven levels of linearity materials were prepared by diluting a
whole blood sample containing 28.0 mg/L of C Reactive Protein (CRP)
with saline according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute EP6-
A and were tested with the Diazyme C Reactive Protein POC Test in
triplicate on the SMART Analyzer. Testing included samples with
concentrations near the LoQ. Conclusion: Linearity data and the LOQ
data support Analytical Measuring Range (AMR) of 0.47 mg/L to 23.00
mg/L.
The regression equation yielded slope of 0.996; intercept of -0.0065 and
R2 of 0.9999.
The package insert recommends diluting samples with CRP > 23.0 mg/L
1:1 with saline. To demonstrate validity, 3 whole blood samples (spiked)
containing CRP near the upper detection limit of 26.0 mg/L CRP were
diluted 1:1 with saline and tested on the SMART analyzer. Recoveries
based on dilutions were all within 95% of the expected concentrations.
No high does hook effect was observed for samples with concentrations up to
200 ng/mL.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or
methods):
Calibrator
The instrument calculates the CRP concentration of patient specimen by use
of a lot specific calibration curve that is stored in an RFID card provided with
each hsCRP POC kit. The RFID card is inserted in the SMART analyzer and
is needed for every single run.
The hsCRP POC assay calibration is traceable to Diazyme CRP calibrators
(k103557) which are in turn traceable to IFCC International Reference
Preparation for C Reactive Protein in the human serum reference material
ERM®-DA472/IFCC.
Control material
Control material target values are assigned based on the mean of replicate
values on the SMART analyzer. The range is assigned as the mean +/- 15%.
Stability protocols and criteria were included within the 510(k).
Stability testing was provided to support the claim of 1 month at 2-8 degrees
C for opened vials, and 12 month shelf life. Real-time stability studies are
ongoing.
d. Detection limit:
LOB and LOD were calculated based on CLSI EP17-A: Protocols for
Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation using
whole blood samples (except for true blanks which were phosphate
buffered saline. Based on this analysis:
LoB was estimated as 0.055 mg/L. LoD was estimated as 0.15 mg/L.
To calculate the LoQ of the Diazyme hsCRP POC Test, five patient whole
blood samples were diluted to concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0
mg/L. The diluted samples were tested with the Diazyme hsCRP POC
Test on SMART analyzers for 20 replicates over 5 days. At the claimed
LoQ of 0.47 (CV observed in this evaluation was 17% and observed bias
was 8.4%.
The sponsor’s claimed measuring range is 0.47 – 23 mg/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Common endogenous substance interference
Potential interferents were evaluated using whole blood samples containing
7

--- Page 8 ---
“low” (near 1 mg/dL CRP) and “high” (4-5 mg/dL CRP) C Reactive Protein
spiked with various concentrations of substances according to Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute EP7-A “Interference Testing in Clinical
Chemistry”: dose-response guidelines. Each sample spiked with interference
substances was tested in triplicates and compared to control samples without
potential interferents.
