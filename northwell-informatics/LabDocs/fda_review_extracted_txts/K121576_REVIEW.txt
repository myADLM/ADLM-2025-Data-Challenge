L. Test Principle:
The IMMULITE® 2000 Anti-CCP IgG assay is a solid phase, chemiluminescent
immunometric assay. The solid phase, a polystyrene bead, is coated with a cyclic citrullinated
peptide (CCP) antigen. The liquid phase consists of protein-based buffer and alkaline
phosphatase (bovine calf intestine) conjugated to a monoclonal murine anti-human IgG
antibody in buffer. In the first cycle, the patient sample and the buffer are incubated together
with the coated bead for 30 minutes. During this time, human IgG in the sample binds to
CCP on the bead. Unbound sample is then removed by centrifugal washes. In the second
cycle, the enzyme conjugated monoclonal murine antihuman IgG is added to the original
reaction tube for additional 30 minutes incubation. The enzyme conjugated monoclonal
murine anti-human IgG antibody binds to immobilized anti-CCP IgG on the bead. The
unbound enzyme conjugate is removed by centrifugal washes. Finally, chemiluminescent
substrate is added to the reaction tube containing the bead and the signal is generated in
proportion to the bound enzyme. The signal is converted to a value from an internal standard
curve and is reported in U/mL.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated according to CLSI EP05-A2. Eleven samples were tested:
the positive control supplied in the kit, five serum samples, and five lithium heparin
plasma samples. Precision panels were prepared by pooling the samples and spiking
to the desired concentration with a stock Anti-CCP reactive sample with a
concentration of 1382.29 U/mL.
Each sample was tested in duplicate in two runs per day over 20 days. Two
instruments were used, and two lots of the device were tested for a total of 320
replicates per sample. Precision was calculated using Nested Analysis of Variance:

ratios to produce dilutions covering the claimed assay range. Each sample was read
in triplicate. Sample concentration tested ranged from 0.74-211.64 U/mL. Samples
outside the assay range (1.5-200 U/mL) were not included in the calculation of
linearity. Regression analysis yielded y = 1.03x – 0.40, R2 = 0.999 in 11 samples
ranging from 2.4 U/mL to 182.9 U/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
There is no standard reference material for anti-CCP. The IMMULITE 2000 anti-
CCP IgG assay, Calibrator Verification Material (CVM) Adjustors, and control
materials are traceable to an internal standard material and manufactured using
qualified materials and measurement procedures.
The instrument-stored assay calibration curve is based on a series of calibrators
covering the claimed assay range and is specific for each lot of the assay.
Assay and component stability:
Real time stability testing to support the following claims for unopened devices and
opened components:
Acceptance criteria for all components of the assay was the dose value of the
component should be within 20% for sample values >6 U/mL and 30% for sample
values ≤6 U/mL of the Day 0 values except if below the LoD of 1.46 U/mL where
recovery cannot be properly determined. At each time point, all Control results must
be within Quality Control established range, to validate the run. Percent recovery
was calculated by comparing dose values of Adjustors from the latest time point to
Day 0 dose value.
Closed vial testing (kit stored at 2 – 8 °C) was conducted at 0, 1, 2, 7, 30, 45, 60, 90,
120, 150, 180, 210, 224, 238, 360, and 390 days. Four replicates for the Low and
High Adjustors and two replicates for each of the Kit Controls (LPIC1-2) and in-
house reference panel (CCP1-5) were run on each day of the study. Dose values of
the controls and samples were calculated from the Day 0 adjustment and from the
adjustment performed on each subsequent day of testing.
Open vial/kit testing of components stored at 2 – 8°C was conducted at Days 0, 2, 7,
14, 21, 28, 30, and 35. Open vial testing of aliquotted components stored at -20°C
was conducted on Days 0, 30, 60, 90, 180, 270, 300, 360, and 390. Four replicates of
each Adjustor and three replicates of each Control were run on each day of the study.

CVM, opened 2 – 8°C 30 days
Sample stability:
The sample stability study supports the claim of stability for two days at 20 - 25°C
and 7 days at 2 – 8ºC for serum and plasma. Serum was shown to be stable for 6
months at -20ºC while plasma was stable for 4 months at -20ºC.
Adjustment interval (calibration curve) stability:
Real time testing supported the recommended adjustment interval of two weeks.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB): An Anti-CCP nonreactive donor sample was used as a blank
and was analyzed on three IMMULITE® 2000 instruments over 5 days. The sample
was tested twice daily using two lots of reagent with two replicate per run. The LoB
result was determined by applying a nonparametric principle based on ranked ordered
value using the following equation where p= (100-α) = 95 and NB = number of blank
measurements = 732:
LoB = [N (p/100)+0.5]
B
The LoB was the average of the ranked results at positions 695 and 696. The LoB
was determined to be 0.26 U/mL.
Limit of Detection (LoD): Five Anti-CCP serum samples (mean concentrations
ranging from 0.26 to 2.5 U/mL) were assayed in replicates of 6 using 2 reagent kit
lots run for 5 days with 2 runs per day. Two instruments and 2 operators generated
960 observations. The LoD was determined by applying the following equation:
LoD = LoB +median -5th percentile
The LoD was determined to be 1.46 U/mL.
The functional sensitivity of the assay is 2.34 U/mL, where functional sensitivity is
defined as the concentration at which the percent (%) CV is ≤ 20%.
e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous interferents:
Six serum pooled with concentrations across assay range were prepared then spiked
separately with endogenous interferents. A control sample was prepared for each

interfering substance by spiking the appropriate diluent at the same volume as the
interfering substance; each sample was tested in triplicate. The interferents tested
were: Human Serum Albumin (12g/dL); Triglycerides (1.5 g/dl); Hemoglobin (500
mg/dL); Bilirubin: Conjugated and Unconjugated (0.2 mg/mL each); and Rheumatoid
Factor (200 IU/mL).
While no interference (≤ 10% different than control sample) was found when the
means of control samples were compared to the means of the spiked samples,
occasional individual samples spiked with bilirubin or RF showed > 10%
interference. The sponsor has included limitations to this effect in the package insert:
“Bilirubin concentrations ≥ 0.23 mg/mL may have an unpredictable effect on patient
sample results” and “Rheumatoid Factor (RF) may have unpredictable effects on
patient samples with low concentrations of anti-CCP antibodies.”
Samples spiked with a five-fold excess of EDTA or heparin anticoagulants were
compared to normal serum to investigate the effect of a short blood draw on anti-CCP
assay results. Eight samples were tested; all but one showed recovery within ± 10%
of the serum control value. The sample that did not recover within ± 10% of the
serum control value was a sample below the assay cut-off; clinical results were not
changed by the discrepancy.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cutoff of the IMMULITE® 2000 Anti-CCP IgG assay was determined with
positive and negative patient samples by a ROC analysis, with a balanced
consideration of sensitivity and specificity. A total of 388 samples were used,
consisting of 212 apparently healthy samples, 106 RA positive samples, and 70 anti-
CCP positive samples (as determined by a predicate method). A result ≥ 4 U/mL
indicates that anti-CCP IgG antibodies were detected in the sample. A result of < 4
U/mL indicates that anti-CCP IgG antibodies were not detected in the sample.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Serum specimens were obtained from 1966 subjects including RA patients and
patients with diseases other than RA were tested on the Siemens anti-CCP assay and
the predicate. Each sample was tested at one of four sites: Siemens or one of the
clinical trial sites (see below). Samples outside the measuring range of either assay
were excluded from the analysis, leaving 255 samples (245 R, 5 SLE, 2 psoriatic
arthritis, and 3 non-RA diseases) for comparison:

discrepant sample was 29.6 U/mL by IMMULITE anti-CCP
Positive agreement 199/213 = 86.9% 95% CI: 81.0% – 91.5%
Negative agreement 12/26 = 46.2% 95% CI: 28.8% – 64.5 %
The low percent negative agreement is likely due to the limited number of negative
samples in this study. To further support substantial equivalence, samples from the
clinical study were tested also with the predicate for comparison of clinical sensitivity
and specificity.
b. Matrix comparison:
Thirty-nine sets of matched serum and plasma samples were collected in the
following anti-coagulant tubes: serum clot tube, lithium heparin plasma tube, serum
separator tube (SST), and EDTA plasma tube. Twenty-one of the 39 sample sets
were spiked to achieve Anti-CCP levels across the assay measuring range. Serum
sample concentrations ranged from <1.5 to 184.4 U/mL, including several samples
around the cut-off. Data was analyzed using Deming regression plots:

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
A total of 1512 patient serum samples with RA (1048 samples) or potentially cross-
reacting diseases (464 samples) were collected for the study. The samples were
collected from two clinical sites and two vendors (US and Canada) and were tested at
four different test sites (three external, one internal). The samples were enrolled on
the basis of diagnosis alone; their predicate anti-CCP status and RF status were not
known by the sponsor. Roughly 65% of the samples were from women, and
approximately half of the samples were from patients that were between 50 and 70
years of age.
At the clinical trial sites, samples were collected from patients enrolled by board
certified rheumatologists following the 1987 ACR guideline. Samples from vendors
were provided as diagnosed with RA. Of the 791 RA samples collected prospectively
from the clinical sites, 204 had been diagnosed less than two years before sample
collection. Of note, most of the prospectively enrolled patients were taking anti-
rheumatic medication(s).

connective tissue disease (4), fibromyalgia (4), pseudogout (4), miscellaneous or
undifferentiated arthritides (14), and miscellaneous others (31).
The samples tested at the external clinical sites (n= 1255) were also tested with the
predicate for comparison of clinical sensitivity and specificity:
Predicate IMMULITE anti-CCP
Sensitivity 63.8% 58.9%
(95% CI) (60.4 – 67.2%) (55.4 – 62.4%)
Specificity 96.1% 97.0%
(95% CI) (93.9 – 97.7%) (95.0 – 98.3%)
b. Other clinical supportive data (when a. is not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
A total of 200 serum samples from presumed healthy male and female donors were
analyzed using the IMMULITE® 2000 Anti-CCP IgG assay. Three samples (1.5%, two
female and one male) were positive. The median of the test samples was <1.5 U/mL
while the nonparametric 99th percentile range was 4.06 U/mL.
The device labeling cautions that each laboratory should establish a reference range
appropriate to their patient populations and clinical practice.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
