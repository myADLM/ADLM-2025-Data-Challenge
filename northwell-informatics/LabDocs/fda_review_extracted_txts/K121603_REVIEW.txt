Calcitonin, Gastrin, and Procalcitonin to monitor the precision of the laboratory
testing systems listed in the package insert. This in vitro diagnostic device is
intended for prescription use only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For in vitro diagnostic use
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:

I. Device Description:
Randox Immunoassay Speciality Control (II) is manufactured at three levels, Level 1,
Level 2 and Level 3. Each control is prepared from human serum with added
constituents of human origin, chemicals, stabilizers and preservatives. They are
supplied in lyophilized form in 5x1ml vials and require reconstitution with 1ml of
distilled water.
Human source material from which this product has been derived and has been tested at
the donor level for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV1 & HIV2) antibody,
Hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) and the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody and were
found to be non-reactive based on FDA approved methods.

accelerated stability. Closed vials are stable until the date printed on
individual vials. Real-time closed vial stability studies are on-going. In
reconstituted serum Procalcitonin is stable for 1 day, Gastrin and Calcitonin
are stable for 8 hours at +2 to +8oC if kept capped in original container and
free from contamination. The control is stable if frozen once for 28 days at -
20oC. All storage recommendations are provided in the labeling.
Value Assignment
Value assignment was determined for each analyte contained in the Randox
Speciality Immunoassay Control (II) Levels 1, 2 and 3 using multiple analyzer
platforms.
Value assignment data were collated and an appropriate target value was
assigned to each analyte based on the average of the observed values. Ranges
were then assigned as +/- 25% of the target. The labeling states that obtained
values should fall within the specified range provided on lot-specific value
sheets and that laboratories should establish appropriate acceptance criteria
when using this product for its intended use.
