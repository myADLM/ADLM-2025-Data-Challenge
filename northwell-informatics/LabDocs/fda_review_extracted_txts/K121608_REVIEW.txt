L. Test Principle:
VITROS 25 OH Vitamin D assay is a direct, competitive chemiluminescent
immunoassay for quantitative determination of total 25 OH vitamin D in serum. During
the first incubation, 25 OH Vitamin D is dissociated from its binding protein and binds to
the specific antibody on the solid phase. After 10 minutes the tracer (vitamin D linked to
an isoluminol derivative) is added. After additional 10 minute incubation, the unbound
material is removed with a wash cycle. Subsequently, the starter reagents are added to
initiate a flash chemiluminescent reaction. The light signal is measured by a
photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) and is inversely proportional to the
concentration of 25 OH vitamin D present in calibrators, controls, or samples. The light
signal is measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) and is inversely
proportional to the concentration of 25 OH Vitamin D present in calibrators, controls, or

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The method was based on CLSI EP6-A (“Evaluation of the Linearity of
Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical approach; Approved
Guideline”). Two lots of VITROS 25-OH Vitamin D Total Assay (tVitD)
were tested using three VITROS Systems (one VITROS ECi/ECiQ
Immunodiagnostic System, one VITROS 3600 Immunodiagnostic System,
and one VITROS 5600 Integrated System). Two pools of VITROS 25-OH
Vitamin D Total Assay samples were prepared with patient samples and were
selected near the extremes of the calibration range. The low pool had an
estimated concentration of 6.73 ng/mL. The high pool had an estimated
concentration of 175 ng/mL. The low and high concentration pools were
sequentially mixed to give 7 further pools of intermediate concentrations.
All results from both Master Lot 1 and 2 and all three VITROS Systems
supported a measuring range of 12.8 to 126 ng/mL.
The regression statistics for linearity are as follows:
System Equation from the
linearity study
VITROS ECi/ECiQ Y = 1.039x + 0.626
Immunodiagnostic System ng/mL R2= 0.9954
VITROS 3600 Y = 1.035x + 0.790
Immunodiagnostic System ng/mL R2= 0.9956
VITROS 5600 Integrated Y = 1.017x + 3.54
System ng/mL R2= 0.9948
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrator traceability and value assignment
VITROS 25-OH Vitamin D Total calibrators are value assigned using in
house reference calibrators. The in house reference calibrators are value
assigned using patient samples that are traceable to Liquid Chromatography
Mass Spectrometry values.

The value assignment was carried out as part of the Master Curve generation.
Twenty four individual reference calibrator curve assays were performed.
Each assay contains reference calibrators, in-house controls and the selling
calibrators, all in singleton. The test is performed using 4 VITROS Systems, 8
VITROS 25-OH Vitamin D Total Reagent Packs, and 12 sets of VITROS 25-
OH Vitamin D Total calibrators.
Each assay is checked for validity against the curve-shape limits and in-house
control test limits. At least 20 runs must be used to generate the Master Curve.
The Master Curve was checked for validity against the curve shape and in-
house control release limits. The mean values for the selling calibrators were
checked against their release limits. The acceptance criteria for the selling
calibrators are shown below.
Target Release limits
value (ng/mL)
(ng/mL)
Calibrator 1 28 20 – 36
Calibrator 2 120 105 – 135
Stability
The calibrator shelf-life and open-vial stability testing protocols and
acceptance criteria were described and found to be adequate. Current
shelf life studies support an eight week shelf life at 2-8°C (supported by
real time studies), with real-time studies on-going.
Once opened calibrators are stable for up to 4 weeks off board at 2-8°C
and at -20 °C and onboard stability of 4 weeks.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank study was designed to run ten (10) replicates of a
negative sample on 2 occasions per day for 5 days, giving 100
determinations in total. The 5 testing days also incorporated three
calibration events.
These determinations were run using two VITROS 25-OH Vitamin D
Total reagent lots run across a VITROS ECi/ECiQ Immunodiagnostic
System, a VITROS 3600 Immunodiagnostic System, and a VITROS 5600
Integrated System.

The Limit of Blank (LoB) is 4.34 ng/mL
The Limit of Detection study was designed to run 10 replicates of each of
six LoD pools, on 2 occasions per day for 5 days, giving 100
determinations of each pool in total. The 5 testing days incorporated three
calibration events. The six LoD pools were made by selecting samples that
give estimated 25-OH Vitamin D concentrations of approximately 8.00 to
30.0 ng/mL.
These determinations were run using two VITROS 25-OH Vitamin D
Total reagent lots run across a VITROS ECi/ECiQ Immunodiagnostic
System, a VITROS 3600 Immunodiagnostic System, and a VITROS 5600
Integrated System.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) for VITROS 25-OH Vitamin D Total Assay
is 8.64 ng/mL determined consistent with CSLI document EP17 and with
proportions of false positives (α) less than 5% and false negatives (β) less
than 5%; based on 700 determinations, with 1 blank and 6 low-level
samples.
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) is 12.8 ng/mL as determined by the
lowest concentration at which precision design of <20%CV.
At 12.8ng/mL, the observed imprecision (%CV) is < 20% across lots and
analyzers.
The sponsor’s claimed measuring range is 12.8 to 126 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Potential interfering and cross-reacting substances for the VITROS 25-OH
Vitamin D Total assay were studied using the VITROS 3600
Immunodiagnostic System consistent with CSLI EP7-A2.
Point estimates of the effects of test levels of potential cross reactants and
interferents have been made with patient samples with values near 30
ng/mL and 80 ng/mL Vitamin D. To calculate the % interference or %
cross reactivity, the mean value of a solution of each test substance was
compared with that of a corresponding “control” in two VITROS 25-OH
Vitamin D Total Assay lots. The sponsor defined non-significant
interference as ≤ 10% bias between the tested and the control samples.
Paricalcitol (Zemplar) interferes with the VITROS 25-OH Vitamin D
Total Assay. Of the other compounds tested for interference, none was
found to cause a >10% bias at the test concentrations.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method was consistent with CSLI document EP9-A2-IR (“Method
Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples”; Approved
Guideline - Second Edition) Interim Review.
A minimum of 117 human serum samples were assayed using the VITROS®
Immunodiagnostic Products 25-OH Vitamin D Total assay on the VITROS
Systems and the IDS-iSYS® 25-Hydroxy Vitamin D assay on the IDS-iSYS
System All human serum samples were run in singleton on all systems.
Seven (7) -spiked and one pooled sample were used for this test.
Passing & Bablok Regression was performed for all comparisons. In each
case, the VITROS 25-OH Vitamin D Total assay results were plotted as the
“y” variable and those from the IDS-iSYS assay as the “x” variable. For the
quantitative comparison, only those data within the measuring range of the
compared IDS-iSYS and VITROS assays were analyzed (12.8 - 126
ng/mL). The parameters of the Passing & Bablok Regressions were used to
state the equations for the product claim.
The comparisons of VITROS to IDS-iSYS are as follows:
1. VITROS 5600 Integrated System 25-OH Vitamin D Total = 0.99 x -5.12
ng/mL, n = 102, r = 0.92. The 95% CI for the slope is 0.86 to 1.12 and for
the Intercept is -10.2 to -0.53.
2. VITROS 3600 Immunodiagnostic System 25-OH Vitamin D Total = 1.08 x
-7.87 ng/mL, n = 103, r = 0.93. The 95%CI for the slope is 0.96 to 1.22
and for the Intercept is -12.4 to -2.95.
3. VITROS ECi/ECiQ Immunodiagnostic System 25-OH Vitamin D Total =
0.96 x -9.07 ng/mL, n = 102, r = 0.94. The 95%CI for the slope is 0.86 to
1.09 and for the Intercept is -14.2 to -4.69.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
A study was conducted using 399 apparently healthy adults between the ages of
21–79. Samples came from individuals who live in the North, South and Central
regions of the United States and were collected in both summer and winter. These
samples were tested using the VITROS 25-OH Vitamin D Total assay Serum
samples from apparently healthy individuals were collected at three US sites
using the following criteria:
· Approximately 50% male and 50% female
· Include ages 21 to 90 years old
· Approximately 50% of the study samples were collected in the
summer and 50% of the study samples were collected in the winter
· Individual will live in the north, south and central United States
· The individuals enrolled in the study must include different skin tones
(minimum 30% dark skin and 30% light skin)
· No history of parathyroid or calcium regulatory disease.
· No history of kidney disease, gastro-intestinal disease, liver disease or
had bariatric surgery
· Currently not taking any medications including Vitamin D
supplements greater than 1000IU per day
The data was analyzed for each system separately and as a mean of the
system results. The data was also analyzed for mean, median, minimum
and maximum for gender, skin type and geographic location by system
and as the mean of the three VITROS systems, The VITROS 3600,
VITROS 5600, and VITROS ECi/ECiQ. The reference interval was
calculated using the mean value across the VITROS systems for each of
the 399 samples as this would result in representative data for the VITROS
family of analyzers
The observed values are summarized below:
Observed Values
Median 25 OH Vitamin D 33.4 (ng/mL) 83.5( nmol/L)
Observed Range 2.5th to 14.7 to 68.3 36.8 – 171
97.5th Percentile (ng/mL) (nmol/L)

It is recommended in the labeling that each laboratory establishes its own
expected values for the population it serves. A review of the most recent literature
1 suggests the recommendation for 25-OH Vitamin D levels are:
Level Range
Deficient <20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L)
Insufficient 20–29 ng/mL (50–72.5 nmol/L)
Sufficient 30–100 (75–250 nmol/L)
Potential Toxicity >100 (250 nmol/L)

N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
