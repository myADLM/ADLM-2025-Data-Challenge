assay is an in vitro diagnostics reagent system intended for quantitative determination of
mmol/mol hemoglobin A1c (IFCC) and % hemoglobin A1c (DCCT/NGSP) in whole
blood on the Roche/Hitachi cobas c 501 clinical chemistry analyzer.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
This device has significant negative interference with fetal hemoglobin (HbF). HbA1c
results are invalid for patients with abnormal amounts of HbF including those with
known Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin.
Glycated HbF is not detected by the assay as it does not contain the β-chain that
characterizes HbA1c. However, HbF is measured in the total Hb assay and as a
consequence, specimens containing high amounts of HbF (>7%) may result in lower than
expected mmol/mol HbA1c values (IFCC) and % HbA1c values (DCCT/NGSP).
Hemoglobin A1c should not be used to diagnose diabetes mellitus in patients with a
hemoglobinopathy but normal red cell turnover (e.g. sickle cell trait)
Hemoglobin A1c should not be used in pregnant patients, patients with homozygous
sickle cell trait, hemolytic anemia, or other hemolytic diseases, and recent significant or
chronic blood loss.
Hemoglobin A1c should not be used to diagnose diabetes mellitus in patients with
hereditary spherocytosis, malignancies or severe chronic hepatic and renal disease.
Hemoglobin A1c should not be used in the diagnosis of gestational diabetes.
In cases of rapidly evolving type 1 diabetes the increase of HbA1c values might be
delayed compared to the acute increase in glucose concentrations. In these conditions
diabetes mellitus must be diagnosed based on plasma glucose concentration and/or the
typical clinical symptoms.
Hemoglobin A1c testing should not replace glucose testing for type 1 diabetes, in
pediatric patients and in pregnant women.
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
All performance data was conducted using the Roche cobas c 501Analyzer
I. Device Description:

L. Test Principle:
Anticoagulated whole blood is hemolyzed prior to determination of HbA1c by a
turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay (TINIA). Liberated hemoglobin (Hb) in the hemolyzed
sample is converted to a derivative having a characteristic absorption spectrum and measured
biochromatically. The instrument calculates the %HbA1c from the HbA1c/Hb ratio
according to a user selected protocol.
This method used Tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTAB) as the detergent in the
hemolyzing reagent to eliminate interference from leukocytes (TTAB does not lyse
leukocytes). Sample pretreatment to remove labile HbA1c is not necessary.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed by testing 4 levels of HbA1c in anticoagulated
venous whole blood patient samples at the following targeted HbA1c values: 5%,
6.5%, 8% and 12%. Additionally 2 controls, PreciControl HbA1c norm and path,
were evaluated in this precision study. Precision was evaluated using 3 cobas c 501
chemistry analyzers and 3 lots of reagent on each analyzer. Two aliquots per sample
were analyzed twice a day in singlicate for 21 days. All testing was completed within
a single calibration cycle for each instrument.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated across the measuring range of the device using a whole blood
patient sample pool with a high analyte concentration and a diluent pool. Sample
pools were mixed in different ratios to obtain a 20-level dilution series with varying
concentrations of Hb and HbA1c covering the entire range (low to high) of the assay
The sponsor chose to perform 1st and 3rd order polynomial regression analysis on each
of the dilution series. The 3rd order regression was found to generate the best linear
fit. The linear regression is
Y=correlation coefficient =0.9927
Intercept= -0.019, slope=1.066, r2=0.995
The linearity study was reviewed and found acceptable. Based on linearity results, the
sponsor claims the assay is linear across the reportable measuring range of 4.2-20.2

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The assigned HbA1c and total hemoglobin values of the cobas c Tina-quant
Hemoglobin A1c Gen.3 assay is certified with the National Glycohemoglobin
Standardization Program (NGSP). The NGSP certification expires in one year. See

The derived result of the ratio (%) from the NGSP correlation is calculated from the
individual quantitative results for total hemoglobin and Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).
The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) units of mmol/mol are
calculated using the Master Equation:
IFCC = (NGSP- 2.15) / 0.092
Two different units are provided to the customers:
NGSP equivalent units (%) and IFCC equivalents units (mmol/mol)
Calibrator and Control materials:
Value assignment for calibrators (Roche C.f.a.s HbA1c) and controls (Roche
PreciControl HbA1c norm and PreciControl HbA1c path) that are recommended for
use with this device were previously established under 510(k) numbers k052101 and
k103099 respectively.
Stability
Stability for calibrators (Roche Cfas HbA1c) and controls (Roche PreciControl

respectively.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined by assaying
an analyte free sample (blank) and five low HbA1c samples according to CLSI
guideline EP17A. Each sample was assayed twice a day for three days on two Roche
cobas c 501 analyzers using the hemolysate application. The detection limits are
summarized in the table below.

e. Analytical specificity:
i.) Endogenous Interference
Interference studies were performed to assess common or known substances that
could interfere with the cobas c 501 Tina-quant HbA1cDx Gen.3 assay. Pooled
whole blood was spiked with the maximum level of interferent and the same whole
blood pool, without interferent (control), was analyzed and compared to the samples

which contained the interferent. The interfering substances were evaluated at two
HbA1c levels (~6.2 and ~8.5% HbA1c). Serial dilutions were performed and
samples were analyzed to establish at which point the interferent may affect the assay.
No significant interference was defined as the % recovery of ≤ ± 7% of the expected
100% recovery. Results showed that no significant interference was found with the
following substances up to the stated concentrations below:
Lipemia 600 mg/dL
Conjugated Bilirubin 60 mg/dL
Unconjugated bilirubin 60 mg/dL
Rheumatoid Factor 750 IU/mL
Glucose 1000 mg/dL
Total Protein 21 g/dL
ii.) Drug interferences were also evaluated. Two HbA1c concentrations of pooled whole
blood (~6.3% and ~8.6%) were spiked with the maximum level of potential
interference and% HbA1c values were compared to the same sample with no potential
interferent present. Significant interference was considered present if the % recovery of
HbA1c exceeded ± 7% of the expected 100% recovery. Results showed that no
significant interference was found with the following substances up to the stated
concentrations below:

Glycated Albumin, and Labile HbA1c were evaluated. Two HbA1c concentrations of
pooled whole blood (~6.3% and~ 8.7%) were spiked with the prepared potential
interferent, (HbA0: 12mg/mL, HbA1a+b: 0.16mg/mL, acetylated Hb: 0.2 mg/mL,
Carbamylated Hb: 0.2 mg/mL and glycated albumin: 1mg/mL). The % HbA1c values
were compared to the same sample with no potential interferent present. Ten replicates
of each sample pool and different mixing ratios of the pools were analyzed on the cobas
c 501 analyzer. Significant interference was considered present if the % recovery of
HbA1c exceeded ± 7% of the expected 100% recovery. The sponsor states that there
were no cross reactions at physiologically occurring concentrations with HbA0,
HbA1a, HbA1b, acetylated hemoglobin, carbamylated hemoglobin, glycated albumin
and labile HbA1c.
iv.) Hemoglobin Variant Interference:
A hemoglobin variant interference study was performed using a total of 116 samples
known to contain Hemoglobin variants S, C, E, D, A2 and F. Testing of the samples
was performed in singlicate on the cobas c 501 analyzer and compared to results
obtained by a reference method that has been demonstrated to be free from the
hemoglobin interference being tested. The following is a table of samples that were
measured:
Hemoglobin Number of % Content of Range in
Variant Samples Variant in Concentration
sample in % HbA1c
HbS 20 31-42% S 4.6-13.0
HbC 19 33-44% C 4.7-13.0
HbE 20 27-33% E 5.0-9.7
HbD 20 34-42% D 4.8-9.8
HbF 20 2-28% F 5.8-10.1
HbA2 17 4-7% A2 4.9-8.6

The results show there is significant interference due to the presence of HbF in the
sample. The extent of interference is directly proportional to the amount of HbF
contained within the sample. The labeling states that, “Specimens containing high
amounts of HbF (>7%) may result in lower than expected mmol/mol HbA1c values
(IFCC) and % HbA1c values (DCCT/NGSP). No significant interference is observed
among specimens tested that contain <7% HbF. A negative bias with HbF is directly
proportional in magnitude to the %HbF content. For example, significant interference
that produces a negative bias of 7% was observed with specimens containing 7%
HbF.”
In addition, the device labeling contains the following prominent boxed warning:
“This device has significant negative interference with fetal hemoglobin (HbF).
HbA1c results are invalid for patients with abnormal amounts of HbF including those
with known Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin. Refer to the Limitations-
interference section of this package insert for details.”
The device contains the following additional warnings:
“Whenever it is suspected that the presence of an Hb variant (e.g. HbSS, HbCC or
HBSC) affects the correlation between the HbA1c value and glycemic control,
HbA1c must not be used for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.”

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison study was conducted using 141 variant free samples ranging
from 4.7 to 12.2% HbA1c were evaluated using the candidate assay method cobas c
501 Tina-quant HbA1cDx Gen.3 assay method. Samples were tested in singlicate
over a 3 day period. The results were compared to testing performed at a secondary
NGSP reference laboratory using a cleared HPLC-based HbA1c assay. To support the
diagnostic claim, the distribution of samples spanned a concentration around the
clinical decision points as follows:
Hemoglobin A1c level Number of samples %samples tested
≤ 5% 5 3.5%
5 – 6% 21 14.9%
6 – 6.5% 28 19.9%
6.5 – 7% 33 23.4%

Total Error Near the Cutoff
Using the results of bias estimation (%Bias) in the method comparison study and
precision estimates in the reproducibility study, Total Error (TE) three concentrations:
(5.2%, 6.5% and 8.0%) was calculated as follows: %TE =|%Bias| + 1.96
*%CV*(1+%Bias). The results are presented in the tables below.
Decision Level %Bias %CV %TE
5.2 -1.98% 2.07% 6.0%
6.5 -1.45% 1.7% 4.7%
8.0 -1.06% 2.1% 5.1%

recommendations of the American Diabetes Association values above 48 mmol/mol
HbA1c (IFCC) or 6.5 % HbA1c (DCCT/NGSP) are suitable for the diagnosis of diabetes
mellitus. Patients with HbA1c values in the range of 39-46 mmol/mol HbA1c (IFCC) or
5.7-6.4 % HbA1c (DCCT/NGSP) may be at a risk of developing diabetes. 1, 2
HbA1c levels may reach 195 mmol/mol (IFCC) or 20 % (DCCT/NGSP) or higher in
poorly controlled diabetes. Therapeutic action is suggested at levels above 64 mmol/mol
HbA1c (IFCC) or 8 % HbA1c (DCCT/NGSP). Diabetes patients with HbA1c levels
below 53 mmol/mol HbA1c (IFCC) or 7 % HbA1c (DCCT/NGSP) meet the goal of the
American Diabetes Association.3, 4
HbA1c levels below the established reference range may indicate recent episodes of
hypoglycemia, the presence of Hb variants, or shortened lifetime of erythrocytes.
Each laboratory should investigate the transferability of the expected values to its own
patient population and if necessary determine its own reference ranges.
