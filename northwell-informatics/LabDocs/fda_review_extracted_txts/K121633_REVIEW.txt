H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The BD VeritorTM System for Rapid Detection of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a
chromatographic immunoassay with an instrumented read for the direct and qualitative
detection of RSV fusion protein from nasopharyngeal washes/aspirates and
nasopharyngeal swabs in transport media from patients suspected of having a viral
respiratory infection. This test is intended for in vitro diagnostic use to aid in the
diagnosis of RSV infections in infants and pediatric patients under the age of 20 years.
Negative results do not preclude RSV infection and should not be used as the sole basis
for treatment or for other management decisions. A negative test is presumptive. It is
recommended that negative test results be confirmed by viral cell culture or an alternative
method, such as a FDA-cleared molecular assay. The test is intended for professional
and laboratory use. It is to be used in conjunction with the BD VeritorTM System Reader.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

4. Special instrument requirements:
Requires the use of the BD VeritorTM System Reader
I. Device Description:
The BD RSV test is a chromatographic assay to qualitatively detect RSV fusion protein in
samples processed from respiratory specimens. The patient specimen is mixed in a prefilled
unitized tube containing mucolytic agents that function to break down mucus in a patient
specimen thereby exposing viral antigens. The processed specimen is added to the test
device where RSV viral antigens bind to anti-RSV antibodies conjugated to detector particles
on the RSV test strip. The antigen-conjugate complex migrates across the test strip to the
reaction area and is captured by an antibody line on the membrane. Results are interpreted
by the BD Veritor™ System Reader, a portable electronic device which uses a reflectance-
based measurement method to evaluate the line signal intensities on the assay test strip, and
applies specific algorithms to determine the presence or absence of any target analyte(s). A
liquid crystal display (LCD) on the instrument communicates the results to the operator.

L. Test Principle:
The BD Veritor™ System RSV test is a chromatographic assay to qualitatively detect RSV
viral fusion protein in respiratory specimens. The patient specimen is mixed in a prefilled
unitized tube containing RV Reagent C and added to the test device. RV Reagent C contains
mucolytic agents that function to break down mucus in a patient specimen thereby exposing
viral antigens and enhancing detection in the assay device. Processed specimens are
expressed through a filter tip into a single sample well on the BD VeritorTM System RSV test
device.
The specimen is mixed and added to the test device where RSV antigens bind to anti-
respiratory syncytial antibodies conjugated to detector particles on the BD Veritor™ System
RSV test strip. The antigen-conjugate complex migrates across the test strip to the reaction
area and is captured by an antibody line on the membrane. The assay utilizes a proprietary
enhanced colloidal-gold particle at the test lines as the means for identifying the presence of
RSV viral antigens.
The BD Veritor™ System RSV test devices are designed with four spatially-distinct zones
including positive and negative control line positions, test line for the target analyte, and a
background zone. The test line for the target analyte is labeled on the test device as ‘T’ for
test position. The onboard positive control ensures the sample has flowed correctly and is
indicated on the test device as ‘C’. Two of the four distinct zones on the test device are not
labeled. These two zones are an onboard negative control line and an assay background
zone. The onboard negative control zone addresses non-specific signal generation and is not
labeled on the test device. The remaining zone is used to measure the assay background and

Background
The BD Veritor™ System RSV assay incorporates an active negative control feature in each
test to identify and compensate for sample-related, nonspecific signal generation. The BD
Veritor™ System Reader uses a proprietary algorithm which subtracts nonspecific signal at
the negative control line from the signal present at the test line. If the resultant test line
signal is above a pre-selected assay cutoff, the specimen is scored as positive. If the resultant
test line signal is below the cutoff, the specimen is scored as negative. Use of the active
negative control feature allows the BD Veritor™ System reader to correctly interpret test
results that cannot be scored visually because the human eye is unable to accurately perform
the subtraction of the nonspecific signal.
The BD Veritor™ System Reader measures the amount of light reflected from various zones
along the assay strip. The measurement of the assay background zone is an important factor
during test interpretation as the reflectance is compared to that of the control and test zones.
A background area that is white to light pink indicates the device has performed correctly.
The instrument analyzes the reflectance data to provide the proper interpretation.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A study was conducted over a period of 12 days with two different operators in order
to evaluate the precision of the BD RSV test. Each day, each operator tested a group
of 20 swab samples that were blinded and randomized and included negatives and
positives (~5% positive, ~95% positive and 100% positive). These specimens were
prepared by dipping the swabs into various dilutions of virus and then letting them
dry. All positive and negative swab specimens were masked and randomized prior to
testing with the BD RSV test. The procedure in the package insert for the swab
control was followed. To extract the viral material from the swab the sample was
inserted into a unitized tube and plunged up and down for 15 seconds. The swab was
then removed while squeezing the tube to expel the excess liquid and the attached
filter tip was snapped in place. The processed sample was mixed and three drops
were added to the sample well of the BD RSV device. After 10 minutes at room
temperature the device was inserted into the BD Veritor™ System Reader for
interpretation.

The reproducibility of the BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of RSV test was
evaluated at three clinical laboratory sites. The reproducibility panel was composed
of 12 simulated RSV samples that were prepared in the same manner as for the
precision study. The panel included moderate positive samples, low positive samples,
high negative samples and negative samples. The panels were masked and
randomized by BD prior to shipment to the clinical trial sites. Each site had two
operators and each operator tested each panel for five consecutive days, resulting in a
total of 60 samples tested per operator and 120 samples per site.

e. Analytical specificity:
A total of 55 microorganisms (including 40 bacteria, one yeast and 14 viruses) were
tested for potential cross reactivity. Bacteria and yeast were tested at a target
concentration of 5 X 106 CFU/mL with the exception of Fusobacterium nucleatum
which was tested at 1.5 X 105 CFU/mL. The 14 viruses were evaluated at
concentrations of 103 TCID /mL or higher.
50
All bacteria, yeast and viral frozen stock cultures were thawed and brought to room
temperature prior to preparing target concentrations for testing. 300 mL of each
organism suspension were added to the unitized tube of RV Reagent C and the
attached filter tip was snapped in place. The sample was mixed and three drops of the
suspension were added to the test well of a BD Veritor™ system RSV device. After
10 minutes at room temperature, the device was inserted into the BD Veritor™
System Reader for interpretation. All determinations were performed in triplicate
with no cross reactivity observed for any of the tested organisms.

g. Specimen storage and stability:
Transport media listed in the Table below were evaluated for specimen storage and
stability with the BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of RSV test. Testing was
performed using two RSV strains (Long subgroup A and 9320 subgroup B). Each
transport medium was spiked with RSV virus at 4-5XLoD and used for testing on
Day 1, Day 2, Day 3 and Day 4. 300µL of the spiked media were added to a unitized
tube containing RV Reagent C. The attached filter tip was snapped into place, the
suspension was mixed and three drops were added to the sample well of the BD
Veritor™ System RSV device. After 10 minutes at room temperature the device was
inserted into the BD Veritor™ System Reader for interpretation. Each transport
media was tested on three different BD Veritor™ System RSV devices. The
remaining volume of each spiked transport media were stored in a refrigerator (2-
8°C) and tested again on Day 2, Day 3 and Day 4. No virus stability issues were
noted for any of the transport medium spiked with RSV Strain Long and RSV Strain
9320 when stored for up to 3 days at 2-8°C.

b. Matrix comparison:
Transport media compatibility:
Various transport media commonly used for the preservation and transport of
respiratory specimens were evaluated for compatibility with the BD Veritor™ System
for Rapid Detection of RSV test. The effects of frozen storage of transport media
samples on the stability of the antigen were also evaluated in this study. Unspiked
transport media were tested to determine if any of the media displayed compatibility
issues (generation of a false positive or background problems) with the BD Veritor™
System RSV test. 300µL of non-frozen media were added to a unitized tube
containing RV Reagent C and the attached filter tip was snapped into place. The
suspension was mixed and three drops were added to the sample well of the BD
Veritor™ System RSV device. After 10 minutes at room temperature the device was
inserted into the BD Veritor™ System Reader for interpretation. Additionally, each
media type was subjected to one freeze/thaw cycle and then tested in triplicate to
evaluate effects of overnight storage at –20 + 5 °C. Testing was performed as
described above for the non-frozen media. Similarly, the RSV positive samples were
evaluated to assure no interference was caused by any of the media (generation of a
false negative) in the assay. Positive samples were prepared by diluting stock
concentrations of an RSV antigen suspension to a concentration correlating to a weak
positive. No compatibility issues were noted for any of the media tested at room
temperature with either unspiked or spiked samples.

Matrix comparison:
An additional matrix comparison study was conducted to evaluate matrix effects on
the assay’s sensitivity. The matrix effect study was designed using two RSV strains
VR-26 (Long subgroup A) and VR-955 (9320 subgroup B) which were serially
diluted in BD Universal Transport Media (UTM) and in a negative pooled
wash/aspirate matrix (pool of around 70 specimens). LoD was determined using a
minimum of 20 replicates. The results of the study showed that there were no
significant differences in the LoD between the two matrices tested, UTM and
negative clinical wash/aspirate matrix.
3. Clinical studies:
Performance characteristics for the BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of RSV
test were established in multi-center clinical studies conducted at five U.S. trial sites
during the 2011-2012 respiratory season. A total of 1174 prospectively collected
specimens received in the laboratory with an order for respiratory virus testing were
enrolled in the study, of which, 26 were noncompliant with the study protocol and
inclusion criteria and one was noncompliant on the viral cell culture reference testing
level. Removal of these specimens yields a total of 1147 specimens. One additional
specimen had a final undetermined viral cell culture reference result which could not be
verified. Removal of this specimen results in a total of 1146 specimens. A total of 1146
were evaluated using the BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of RSV test and viral
cell culture. The prospective specimens consisted of 440 Nasopharyngeal Wash
/Aspirates (NPWA) and 706 nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) in transport media from
symptomatic patients. 44.3% of the samples were from females and 55.7% from males.
80% of patients were 2 years and under.
For testing specimens with the BD Veritor™ System RSV test, sites were instructed to
follow the procedural instructions outlined in the draft package insert. Briefly, NP
wash/aspirate specimens and NP swab in transport media specimens were vortexed or
thoroughly mixed and 300 µL of the specimen was transferred into the unitized tube

containing RV Reagent C using the disposable volumetric pipette. The attached filter tip
was snapped in place, the contents were mixed by agitating the tube, and three drops of
the mixture were added to the sample well of the BD Veritor™ System RSV device.
After 10 minutes at room temperature the device was inserted into the BD Veritor™
System Reader for result interpretation. Visual interpretation of results was not permitted
from the device.
The performance of the BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of RSV test was
compared to viral cell culture followed by DFA using an FDA cleared D3 Duet DFA
Influenza A/ Respiratory virus screening test. The data were tabulated using the
reference method results to categorize the BD RSV test results into the following
categories:
1. True Positive: Any BD RSV test result which exhibits a positive result and
has a reference positive result shall be deemed a true positive.
2. False Positive: Any BD RSV test result which exhibits a positive result but the
reference result is negative shall be deemed a false positive.
3. True Negative: Any BD RSV test result which exhibits a negative result for
which the reference result is negative shall be deemed a true negative.
4. False Negative: Any BD RSV test result that exhibits a negative result but for which
the reference result is positive shall be deemed false negative.

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The rate of positivity observed in RSV testing will vary depending on the method of
specimen collection, handling/transport system employed, detection method utilized, time
of year, age of the patient, geographic location and most importantly, local disease
prevalence. In the 2011/2012 clinical trial, the overall prevalence of RSV as determined
by viral cell culture for the NP swabs in transport media was 24.5% (range of 5.6% to
31.8%). The overall prevalence of RSV as determined by viral cell culture for the
NPWA specimens was 37.7% (range of 10.5% to 49.6%).

N. Instrument Name:
BD Veritor™ System Reader
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Veritor™ System Reader is a small, battery powered, bench top instrument that is
used to read the Veritor lateral flow test cassette. After the extracted patient sample has
been added to the test cassette, the test is developed at room temperature for 10 minutes.
The cassette is then placed into the reader where it is scanned. The cassette is divided
into distinct zones where the analyzer reads the negative background, positive control,
and the Influenza A and B specific zones. The reader applies an algorithm to determine
the background of the test as well as the specific signal from the A or B test zones. The
reader has a finite number of reads and will prompt the end-user as the total number of
reads approaches the lifetime of the unit.
2. Software:
The Veritor™ System Reader is the identical instrument that has been reviewed and
cleared with the BD influenza A and B assay k112277. FDA has reviewed applicant’s
instrument Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this instrument.
Please refer to decision summary for k112277.
Yes __ X___ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Not Applicable
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Not Applicable
5. Calibration:
The Veritor™ Reader is not configurable by the end user and is designed to have a finite
lifetime based on number of tests performed or shelf life from date of manufacture.
Device calibration is not required, however, a verification device is provided with the
reader to monitor the device function.
6. Quality Control:
Each BD Veritor™ System RSV test strip is designed with spatially-distinct zones
containing a positive and negative internal control. The positive control zone ensures that
15

--- Page 16 ---
the sample has flowed correctly, and the negative control zone serves to address non-
specific signal generation. The BD Veritor™ System Reader determines the line intensity
at each of the spatially-defined control zones and utilizes specific algorithms to determine
the presence or absence of any target analyte. The BD Veritor™ System Reader must be
used to read the BD Veritor™ RSV test devices, as these devices cannot be interpreted
visually by the user.
In addition to the two internal controls, each BD RSV kit contains the following external
controls:
1. Control + is a dry swab control that may be used as an external control. A positive
RSV test result on the reader LCD display confirms that the operator performed the
test correctly.
2. Control − is a dry swab control that may be used as an external control. A negative
RSV test result on the reader LCD display confirms that the operator performed the
test correctly.
At a minimum, the external dry swab controls should be run as a quality control
procedure for each new lot and new shipment received. Controls should be tested in
accordance with local, state and/or federal regulations or accreditation requirements and
the standard Quality Control procedures. If desired, appropriate reagent performance and
proper testing technique may also be determined by using specimens qualified as positive
or negative for the RSV virus. The user is instructed not to use the BD Veritor™ System
RSV test if control + and control do not yield appropriate results.
