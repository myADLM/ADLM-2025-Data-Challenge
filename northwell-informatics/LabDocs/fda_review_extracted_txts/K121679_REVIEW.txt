L. Test Principle:
The test is based on electrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of capillary
action. The electrical current generated by the reaction of glucose with the reagent of the
strip is measured by the meter and is displayed as the corresponding blood glucose level.
The strength of the current produced by the reaction depends on the amount of glucose in the
blood sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability studies were performed with venous whole blood samples at five
glucose concentration ranges. A total of 50 strip vials/lot were used. Ten runs were
performed on each sample with 5 replicates per vial/strip lot resulting in a total of 100
replicates collected for test strip lot and each glucose level tested. Results are

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using 9 venous blood samples ranging in glucose
concentrations from 2.0 to 629.7 mg/dL (2.0, 14.5, 36.5, 57.8, 79.8, 151.9, 307.0,
474.2, 629.7 mg/dL) as measured by the reference method. Each sample was tested
in replicates of 4 on each of 8 strip lots resulting in a total of 32 replicates for each
strip lot and glucose level. The values from the Inform II meter were compared with
those obtained from the reference method. The results from regression analysis are
summarized below:
Lot #1: y=0.9593x+2.92; R2 = 0.999
Lot #2: y=0.9884x+3.447; R2 = 0.998
Lot #3: y=0.9946x+3.80; R2 = 0.998
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of
10 to 600 mg/dL.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
According to the sponsor, the ACCU-CHEK Inform II system is traceable to the
NIST SRM 917 glucose reference material. A method comparison was performed
using the candidate device and a hexokinase method (Hitachi 917) as the reference
method (see Section 2.a.)
The ACCU-CHEK Inform II control solutions used with the ACCU-CHEK Inform II
Blood Glucose Monitoring System were previously cleared under k043474.
Value Assignment and Stability Testing: Two ACCU-CHEK Inform II control
solutions (Levels 1 and 2) and 6 levels in the ACCU-CHEK Inform II Linearity Test
Kit (Levels 1 to 6) are available for use with the ACCU-CHEK Inform II test system.
The Linearity Solutions levels 2 and 4 are the same as the Control solution levels 1
and 2, respectively. Value assignment for the control solutions and linearity set is
based on the mean of repeated measurements compared to the established target
values for each level. The target values for the linearity levels are provided in the
linearity kit package insert and the control solution ranges are printed on the test strip
vial label.
Open vial and closed vial (shelf-life) stability is assessed using real-time testing for
the control solutions and linearity set solutions. Protocols and acceptance criteria
were reviewed and found to be acceptable to support the shelf life stability claim of
24 months and an open-vial stability claim of 3 months when stored at the
recommended storage temperatures of 39°F to 86°F (4°C to 30°C). Labeling
instructs the user not to freeze the solutions.
The sponsor provided a protocol and acceptance criteria to verify the closed-vial
stability (shelf life) and open vial stability of the test strips. The stability protocols
and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor
claims a closed-vial (shelf life) and open-vial stability of 18 months when stored at
36-86°F. The labeling instructs the users not to freeze the test strips.
c. Detection limit:
The reportable range for the ACCU-CHEK Inform II Blood Glucose Monitoring
System is 10 to 600 mg/dL. This range was verified by the linearity study (M.1.b).
d. Analytical specificity:
To assess potential interference the sponsor used venous whole blood samples
adjusted to 5 different glucose levels of approximately 25, 55, 120, 350 and 500
mg/dL (concentrations of 10, 15, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 200 and 300 mg/dL glucose
were used in testing galactose) and split into a control sample and a test sample.
Various endogenous and exogenous substances were then added to the test sample
only. Concentrations tested were at least three times the upper therapeutic level (for
drugs) or three times the highest expected concentration (for endogenous substances).

Each sample was analyzed in duplicate per meter per test strip lot for a total of 32
measurements per sample. The % difference between the test sample and the control
sample was calculated and concentration at which no significant interference was
observed is presented in the table below:

The sponsor has the following limitations in their labeling:
– Lipemic samples (triglycerides) in excess of 1800 mg/dL may produce
elevated results.
– Intravenous administration of ascorbic acid which results in blood
concentrations of ascorbic acid > 3 mg/dL will cause overestimation of
glucose results.
– Blood concentrations of galactose >15 mg/dL will cause overestimation of
blood glucose results.

Sodium:
A separate study was conducted using over 4000 hospitalized venous and arterial patient
samples with sodium concentration bins of <125 mmol/L, 125-134 mmol/L, 135-144
mmol/L, 145-150 mmol/L and >150 mmol/L with glucose concentrations that reasonably
spanned the glucose measuring range of the system. Samples were adjusted to achieve
glucose concentrations to reasonably span the glucose measuring range in each of the
sodium bins. Overall glucose concentrations ranged from 11.4 mg/dL to 583.8 mg/dL.
Results obtained using the ACCU-CHEK Inform II Blood Glucose Monitoring System
were compared to those obtained with the reference method (Hitachi 917) and
demonstrated no significant bias with samples containing extreme sodium concentrations.
e. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To assess system accuracy, results from the ACCU-CHEK Inform II Blood Glucose
Monitoring System were compared to a reference method, PCA-HK (Hitachi 917).
Capillary samples from 100 participants with glucose with concentrations ranging
from 21-547 mg/dL glucose obtained using PCA-HK. To obtain blood glucose
concentrations <50 mg/dL and > 400 mg/dL, samples were allowed to glycolize or
were spiked to achieve the desired glucose concentration. The results relative to
reference are summarized in the tables below:

b. Matrix comparison:
Anticoagulant study:
Venous blood was drawn from ten donors having glucose levels in 5 different glucose
bins: <70, 71-110, 111-150, 151-250, >251 mg/dL. The donor blood was collected
into each of 4 vacutainer tubes (lithium heparin, sodium heparin, EDTA, and sodium
fluoride/potassium oxalate) and into vacutainer tubes containing no anticoagulant.
Each anticoagulant was tested in replicates of sixteen. Results of the study
demonstrate no significant bias when results from samples containing EDTA, lithium
heparin, or sodium heparin were compared to results from samples containing no
anticoagulant and support the use with the ACCU-CHEK Inform II system.
The sponsor includes the following limitation in the labeling: Iodoacetate or fluoride-
containing anticoagulants are not recommended.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip, capillary
heel stick samples from neonates, venous, and arterial whole blood. After an operator ID
is entered and the login is completed a patient sample can be run by first entering the
patient ID either manually or by using the barcode scanner; the test strip lot is compared
to the test strips in use; the test strip is inserted and the blood sample is applied.
5. Calibration:
The system contains a code key reader that is separate from the meter. Each test strip vial
contains a code key that contains the test strip code information specific to that test strip
lot number. The code key is inserted into and read by the code key reader. The coding
information that includes lot specific test strip properties is sent via infrared transmission
to the meter where it (the code file) is stored.
6. Quality Control:
The ACCU-CHEK Inform II Control Solutions are used as a quality control checks to
make sure that the ACCU-CHEK Inform II system and ACCU-CHEK Inform II test
strips are working correctly. The labeling provides instructions on when quality control
testing should be performed.
The ACCU-CHEK Inform II Linearity Test Kit is intended for use for periodic
verification of linearity of the ACCU-CHEK Inform II system using ACCU-CHEK
Inform II test strips. Linearity tests can help you to check the function and
accuracy of the entire system over the full range of specified values. Linearity samples
should be treated in exactly the same manner as described in the labeling for control
solution testing. The labeling contains instructions on how to perform linearity testing
with the linearity solutions and, using the target values provided, how to plot the results
of the 6 levels of linearity test kit solutions. The labeling includes recommendations for
when the linearity of the system should be checked.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1) Hematocrit study:
The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated using venous whole blood
samples with hematocrit levels of 10 – 65% (10,15, 20, 25, 30, 43, 50, 55, 60, 65 and
70%) spiked with glucose to achieve target concentrations of 25, 55, 120, 350, and 500
mg/dL. Three strip lots were evaluated, and there were 30 measurements for each
combination of strip lot, glucose concentration, and hematocrit level tested. The results
demonstrated that the ACCU CHEK Inform II Blood Glucose Monitoring System
produces results within an acceptable bias over the claimed hematocrit range of 10 –
65%.

2) Altitude study:
To evaluate the effects of altitude on the Inform II system results, altered (spiked and
glycolysed) venous blood samples from three donors were spiked to 5 glucose
concentrations that reasonably spanned the measuring range of the system. The blood
samples were tested at 10,150 feet above sea level and the results compared those
obtained with the reference method (PCA-HK; Hitachi 917). The results demonstrate
acceptable bias to the reference to support the claims in the labeling that altitudes up to
10,000 feet have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements from the ACCU
CHEK Inform II Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
3) Temperature and humidity studies:
The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies using venous blood samples at
target glucose concentrations of 70, 120, and 250 mg/dL to evaluate temperatures ranging
from 61-95°F (16-35°C) and relative humidity from 10-80%. Combinations of the
claimed temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated meter results
compared to a reference method. The results support the claimed range of operating
conditions: 61-95°F and 10-80% relative humidity.
4) Sample volume study:
The sponsor performed a sample volume study to support the claimed minimum sample
volume requirement for the ACCU-CHEK Inform II system (0.6 mL) using blood
samples at three glucose concentrations (45, 120, 450 mg/dL). The system displays an
error code when insufficient sample is detected. Results support the claimed sample
volume of 0.6 mL.
5) Infection Control Studies: The device is intended for multiple-patient use. Clorox
Germicidal wipes (EPA registration #67619-2) were validated demonstrating complete
inactivation of live virus for use with the meter. The sponsor also demonstrated that there
was no change in performance or in the external materials of the meter after 12,045
cleaning and disinfection cycles (one cycle includes one cleaning wipe plus one
disinfecting wipe) to simulate 3 years of device use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate
instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
6) Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing was performed and found to be adequate
for the Accu-Chek Inform II system.
7) ACCU-CHEK Customer Care Service Center is available 24 hours a day, 365 day a year
by calling 1-800-440-3638.
