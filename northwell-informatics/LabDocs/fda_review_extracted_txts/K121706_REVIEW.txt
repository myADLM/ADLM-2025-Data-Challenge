L. Test Principle:
The system quantitatively measures the concentration of glucose in whole blood with an
amperometric glucose biosensor embedded in the meter that measures the volume of
electrical signal generated by the reaction of glucose in the blood sample with the
metabolizing enzyme system (glucose oxidase) implanted on the test strip. The electrical
signal is then translated into the glucose concentration which is displayed on the LCD screen
of the meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run precision was evaluated using venous whole blood samples spiked to
achieve five different glucose concentrations, three reagent strip lots, and 10 FORA
V10 No Code blood glucose meters. Each level was evaluated 10 times for a total of
100 tests per each glucose level.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity testing was performed using venous blood samples which were adjusted to
10 different glucose concentrations ranging from 10~20, 21~50, 51~80, 81~120,
121~200, 201~300, 301~400, 401~500, 501~600, and 601~700 mg/dL, as measured
by the YSI-2300. Three lots of test strips and 5 FORA V10 No Code glucose meters
were used. Each concentration was measured 15 times (with 5 measurements per lot)
using the FORA V10 No Code glucose meters. The values obtained using the FORA
V10 No Code glucose meter were compared to those obtained by the YSI-2300. The
linear regression analysis is as follows:

Lot 3 0.9986 0.9872-1.0086 -1.9360 -5.6567-1.7846 0.9986
The claimed measuring range for this device is 20-600 mg/dL
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The method comparison was performed using the proposed device and YSI 2300
glucose analyzer. The YSI 2300 is calibrated with NIST (SRM) 917A reference
material.
The FORA control solutions solutions are traceable to NIST SRM 917A reference
material and YSI-2300. Value assignment was performed with 25 meters, 25 vials of
test strips from the same lot and 3 levels of control solutions. The mean, standard
deviation and CV are calculated for each new lot of control material.
Test strips stability previously evaluated under k093035. The sponsor states that the
unopened test strips are stable for 24months when stored at 35.6˚F-89.6˚F.
Control solutions stability previously evaluated under k093724. The sponsor states
that the control solutions have an unopened shelf-life of 2 years (24 months) at the
recommended storage temperature of 36˚-86˚F. Open vial stability is 90 days at the
recommended storage temperature of 36˚-86˚F.
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the system is 20-600mg/dL. This range was verified by the
linearity study stated above (section M.1.b)
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor indicated that interference testing was performed according to CLSI
EP7-A2.Venous blood was obtained from fasting subjects and collected in sodium
heparin vacutainer tubes. Two concentrations of glucose were adjusted to 70 mg/dL
(low) and 150 mg/dL (high) using the YSI 2300 as a reference analyzer. Glucose
samples were then spiked with the potentially interfering compounds equivalent to
the highest therapeutic dosage and toxic level (or ten times the highest therapeutic
concentrations when toxic levels were unknown). Bias was calculated as the mean
percent difference in glucose reading between the test and control concentration
groups. All samples tested showed % bias within ± 10% between the test and the
control groups. The sponsor claims no significant interference (≤10% difference) for
the substances and concentrations listed in the table below.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study:
The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated with one lot of test strips and six
FORA V10 No Code Blood Glucose meters. Blood samples at six concentrations (20-30,
50-80, 100-150, 201-250, 351-400, 551-600 mg/dL) were analyzed. The glucose samples
were prepared from venous blood at five different hematocrit levels 20, 30, 40, 50, and
60%. Glucose results for each concentration and hematocrit level were compared to
samples tested on the YSI reference method. The data supports the sponsor’s claim that
hematocrit in the range of 20-60% does not significantly interfere (more than ± 15%) with
glucose measurements using the FORA V10 No Code Glucose Monitoring System.
2. Altitude:
An altitude study was conduct to evaluate the effect of altitude up to 10,742 feet on
performance of the FORA V10 No Code Blood Glucose Monitoring System using a glove
box system which simulates 4 elevations from sea level to 15,000 feet (4500 meters),
atmospheric pressure from 429 - 760 mmHg, and P02 from 32-102 mmHg. Venous whole
blood samples at five glucose concentrations ranging from 50-600mg/dL were tested at
four altitudes using three FORA V10 Blood Glucose meters and one lot of test strips. Each
sample was also evaluated by the YSI method. At altitudes up to 15,000 feet, test results
were within ± 10% of the YSI values.
3. Test System operating conditions:
Studies were performed using four FORA V10 No Code Blood Glucose meters, three lots
of test strips, and three venous whole blood samples with glucose concentrations of ~65,
~125 and ~320 mg/dL. Testing was performed at four combined temperature and humidity
conditions (50˚F/10% RH, 50˚F/85%RH, 50˚F/10%RH and 40˚C/85%RH) as well as the
claimed conditions 50-104˚C (10-40˚C) and at a relative humidity from 10-85% and results
compared to the reference YSI. There were no significant differences in glucose
concentrations across the temperature and humidity ranges tested. Results demonstrated
that the test system can be used at temperatures from 50-104˚F (10-40˚C) and at a relative
humidity from 10-85%.
4. User performance study:
During the lay user study described above in Section M.3.c, the participants were asked to
complete a questionnaire to evaluate the ease of use of the device and the clarity of the
English language labeling. Overall the users indicated that they could successfully perform
the test and that the user manual was written clearly.
17

--- Page 18 ---
5. Readability Assessment:
The readability of the labeling (user guides, test strip package insert and control solution
package insert) using a Flesch-Kincaid analysis were found to be written at the 8th grade
level.
6. EMC Testing:
The sponsor provided the appropriate documentation certifying that electromagnetic testing
(EMC) had been performed and the FORA V10 No Code Blood Glucose Meter was found
compliant.
7. Speaking Function:
The sponsor has provided the validation studies for the Speaking Functions of the FORA
V10 No Code Blood Glucose Monitoring System. The Speaking Function Validation test
was deemed to be acceptable
8. Infection Control:
The device is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were
performed on the materials comprising the meter by an outside commercial testing lab
demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B Virus (HBV) with the chosen
disinfectant, Micro-Kill Plus™ disposable wipes (EPA Reg. No: 59894-10-37549).
Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no
change in performance or external materials of the meter after 5,000 cleaning and
disinfection cycles, using Micro-Kill Plus™ disposable wipes, to simulate 5 years of use
by lay users. Labeling has been reviewed for adequate instructions in validated cleaning
and disinfection procedures.
9. Software validation:
Software validation and verification has been reviewed and the information provided was
deemed to be adequate..
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
