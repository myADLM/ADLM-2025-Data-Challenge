I. Device Description:
The Xpert CT/NG Assay is a rapid, automated in vitro diagnostic test for qualitative
detection and differentiation of DNA from Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and/or
Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG). The assay is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert
Instrument Systems. The GeneXpert Instrument Systems automate and integrate
sample purification, nucleic acid amplification, and detection of the target sequences
in urogenital samples using real-time PCR for gene specific sequence amplification.
The GeneXpert Instrument Systems, comprised of the GeneXpert Dx System, the
GeneXpert Infinity-48 System and the GeneXpert Infinity-80 System, have 1 to 80
randomly accessible modules, depending upon the instrument, that are each capable
of performing sample preparation and real-time PCR tests individually for each
patient. Each module contains a syringe drive for dispensing fluids (i.e., the syringe
drive activates the plunger that works in concert with the rotary valve in the cartridge
to move fluids between chambers), an ultrasonic horn for lysing cells or spores, and a
proprietary I-CORE® thermocycler for performing real-time PCR and detection.
The system consists of an instrument, personal computer, and preloaded software for
running the tests on collected samples and viewing the results. The system is designed
to minimize cross-contamination during the testing process by the use of assay
specific single-use disposable cartridges that hold the PCR reagents and host the PCR
process.
The Xpert CT/NG Assay includes reagents for the 5’ exonuclease real-time PCR
detection and differentiation of CT and NG. Reagents for the detection of a Sample
Processing Control (SPC), a Sample Adequacy Control (SAC), and a Probe Check
Control (PCC) are also included in the cartridge. The SPC is present to control for
adequate processing of the target bacteria and to monitor the presence of inhibitors in
the PCR reaction. The SAC reagents detect the presence of a single copy human gene
and monitor whether the specimen contains human DNA. The PCC verifies reagent
rehydration, PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe integrity, and dye stability. The
primers and probes in the Xpert CT/NG Assay detect chromosomal sequences in the
bacteria.

The Xpert CT/NG Assay is designed for use with genital and urine specimens (first-
catch male urine, female urine, endocervical specimens and vaginal swab specimens)
collected in specific Urine and Endocervical /Vaginal Specimen Collection kits
designed to preserve patient specimens to allow transport to the laboratory for
analysis with Xpert CT/NG Assay and GeneXpert Instrument System. The specimen
is briefly mixed and transferred to the sample chamber of the Xpert CT/NG cartridge
using the supplied transfer pipette. The provided Binding Reagent is manually added
into the designated chamber of the Xpert CT/NG cartridge. The cartridge is loaded
onto the GeneXpert Instrument System platform, which performs hands-off,
automated sample processing, and real-time PCR for detection of DNA. Test results
are obtained in approximately 90 minutes and are displayed in tabular and graphic
formats.

L. Test Principle:
Detection of the amplified DNA is by fluorogenic target-specific probe hybridization
followed by 5’-nuclease cleavage of the probe to release the fluorophore. The primers
and probes in the Xpert CT/NG Assay are designed to amplify and detect one unique
chromosomal gene sequence for Chlamydia trachomatis and two unique
chromosomal gene sequences for Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
The GeneXpert Instrument Systems perform hands-off, automated sample preparation
by first mixing the sample with Lysis Reagent and then taking the mixture to
re-suspend the Sample Processing Control in the form of a lyophilized bead within
the cartridge. Lysis of bacterial cells with Lysis Reagent is followed by mixing with
Binding Reagent which allows capture of the nucleic acids on the glass fiber column.
The column is then washed to remove contaminants and finally, the purified nucleic
acids are eluted with an elution reagent. The nucleic acid solution is mixed with dry
real-time PCR reagents and transferred into the PCR tube for real-time PCR and
detection of chromosomal DNA gene sequences for Chlamydia trachomatis and/or
Neisseria gonorrhoeae. During real time-PCR cycling, optical signals from five (5)
sequence specific fluorescent probes within the reaction are monitored in real time.
The probes correspond to the one CT and two NG targets, SAC target and the SPC
target.

Controls:
Internal Controls:
The Xpert CT/NG Assay includes three internal controls contained in each cartridge:
· The Probe Check Control (PCC) performs a check on the amplification
portion of the assay. It controls for missing or incompletely hydrated beads of
enzyme and target specific reagent. It also controls for the generated
fluorescence which must meet internal acceptance criteria.
· The Sample Processing Control (SPC) contains DNA from Bacillus globigii
and verifies the sample processing and target amplification.
· The Sample Adequacy Control (SAC) ensures that the sample contains human
cells and that the cells are adequately lysed in order to extract nucleic acids.
Additionally, the GeneExpert Instrument performs a System Control Check for
Temperature. This check ensures that the instrument is operating within validated
heating and cooling specifications.
External Controls:
External Controls are not included with the kit and must be obtained by the user.
Interpretation of Results:
The results are interpolated by the GeneXpert System from measured fluorescent
signals and embedded calculation algorithms. The diagnostic algorithm is based on
the results for the optical curves associated with the CT and NG targets as well as the
Sample Processing Control (SPC) and Sample Adequacy Control (SAC). A cycle
threshold (Ct) is obtained for each curve. The values for Ct are used to determine the
presence or absence of the targets being detected (CT, NG, SAC, and SPC). The
optical curves for the CT and/or NG target are interpreted as positive if they satisfy
fixed criteria for valid threshold fluorescence crossing. The optical curves for the CT
and/or NG targets are interpreted as negative if they fail to satisfy fixed criteria for a
valid threshold crossing. The following table shows the possible final test results:
Xpert CT/NG– IVD, Decision Summary Page 9 of 40

--- Page 10 ---
There are 3 possible outcomes that require a re-test of the specimen:
INVALID indicates that the SPC and/or the SAC failed. The sample was not properly
processed, PCR was inhibited, or the sample was inadequate.
ERROR indicates that the PCC failed and the assay was aborted possibly because
the reaction tube was filled improperly, a reagent probe integrity problem was
detected, pressure limits were exceeded, or a valve positioning error was detected.
NO RESULT indicates that insufficient data were collected. For example, the
operator stopped a test that was in progress.
A re-test is performed on the leftover sample from the CT/NG Transport Reagent
tube using a new cartridge.
M. Performance Characteristics
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility Study:
Reproducibility of the Xpert CT/NG Assay was evaluated at three sites using
specimens comprised of CT and NG organisms seeded into pooled, negative male
urine (urine matrix) or pooled, negative female vaginal swab samples (swab matrix).
The specimens were prepared at concentration levels representing low positive (1X
LoD), moderate positive (2-3X LoD), and high positive (>20X LoD) for each
organism. The panel members prepared with high concentrations (>20xLoD) of one
organism and low concentrations (1xLoD) of the other organism allowed for the
evaluation of potential competitive inhibition of one organism by the other one.
Xpert CT/NG– IVD, Decision Summary Page 10 of 40

--- Page 11 ---
Negative panel members were also included, and were comprised of pooled, negative
male urine and pooled, negative vaginal swab samples. A panel of 22 specimens (11
in urine matrix and 11 in swab matrix) was tested on five different days by two
different operators four times per day at three sites (22 specimens x 2 operators x 5
days x 4 replicates per day x 3 sites). Three lots of Xpert CT/NG reagents were
included in the study, with two lots being tested at each site. Xpert CT/NG Assays
were performed according to the Xpert CT/NG Assay procedure. The rate of
agreement with expected results of CT and NG for each panel member was calculated
for each site. The results are presented separately for swab samples and urine
samples.

The reproducibility of the Xpert CT/NG Assay was also evaluated in terms of the
fluorescence signal expressed in Ct values for each target detected. The mean,
standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) measures between-sites,
between-lots, between-days, and between-runs for each panel member, for each target
detected, are presented below.

Agrmt=Agreement, Conc=concentration, CV=coefficient of variation, N/A=Not Applicable for negative samples, SD=standard deviation
Note: Variability from some factors may be numerically negative, which can occur if the variability due to those factors is very small. When this occurs, the variability as
measured with SD and CV is set to 0.
1A run is defined as the four samples per panel member run by one operator at one site on one day

Instrument Precision Study:
An in-house precision study was conducted to compare the performance of the
GeneXpert Dx and the Infinity-80 Instrument Systems using specimens comprised of
CT and NG organisms seeded into negative urine simulated swab matrix. The
specimens were prepared at concentration levels representing low positive (0.25-0.5X
LoD), moderate positive (2-3X LoD), and high positive (>20X LoD) for each
organism. Negative panel members were also included and were comprised of
negative urine and negative diluent. A panel of 20 specimens (10 in urine matrix and
10 in swab matrix) was tested on 12 different days by two operators. The samples
were tested in a different order throughout the study; the specimens were blinded with
a Specimen ID, which was used to define the order in which the samples were tested.
Each operator conducted four runs of each panel specimen per day on each of the two
instrument systems (20 specimens x 4 times/ day x 12 days x 2 operators x 2
instrument systems). One lot of Xpert CT/NG Assay was used for the study. Xpert
CT/NG assays were performed according to the Xpert CT/NG Assay procedure.
External controls were run on each instrument by each operator on each day that
samples were tested. The study challenged the Infinity-80 system by loading the test
cartridges continuously by the two operators, which resulted in the worst-case
scenario where the maximum number of cartridges was loaded and analyzed
simultaneously. Xpert CT/NG assays were performed according to the Xpert CT/NG
Assay procedure.
The rate of agreement with expected results of CT and NG for each panel member, in
swab matrix, is presented below.

The precision of the Xpert CT/NG Assay in this study was also evaluated in terms of
the fluorescence signal expressed in Ct values for each target detected. The mean,
standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) between-instruments,
between-days, and between-runs for each panel member, for each target detected, are
presented below.

Urine Specimens
Preserved urine:
Aliquots of pooled negative urine were diluted into Xpert CT/NG Urine Transport
Reagent at a ratio of 7:1 (v/v) consistent with Package Insert instructions. C.
trachomatis LGVII (ATCC 434/VR-902B0) and N. gonorrhoeae (ATCC 19424)
were spiked into the preserved pooled negative urines. Specimens were stored at 2°C,
15°C and 30°C and tested at several time points out to 45 days. Female urine and
male urine were evaluated separately. The data supported stability of preserved
female urine specimens up to 45 days when stored at refrigerator temperatures
(approximately 4°C) and up to 3 days when left at room temperature. The preserved
male urine was stable for 45 days when stored at temperatures from 2°C to 15°C and
up to 30 days at temperatures not exceeding 30°C.
Unpreserved urine:
Spiked unpreserved urines were stored at 4°C and at room temperature and tested at
several time points out to 14 days. The data supported stability of unpreserved female
and male first catch urine specimens for 1 day at room temperature and for up to 8
days when stored in a refrigerator (4°C).
Swab Specimens
C. trachomatis LGVII (ATCC 434/VR-902B0) and N. gonorrhoeae (ATCC 49226)
were spiked into preserved pooled negative endocervical swabs and pooled negative
vaginal swabs. Specimens were stored at 2°C and 30°C and tested with Xpert CT/NG
Assay at several time points out to 60 days. The study data indicate that endocervical
and vaginal swab specimens transferred into the Xpert CT/NG Swab Transport
Reagent tube (preserved endocervical/vaginal swab specimen) can be stored up to 60
days at temperatures from 2°C to 30°C prior to testing with the Xpert CT/NG Assay.
d. Detection limit:
Studies were performed to determine the analytical limit of detection (LoD) of the
Xpert CT/NG Assay with purified CT elementary bodies seeded into negative natural
human pooled vaginal swab and pooled male urine matrices and NG cells seeded into
negative pooled simulated swab and pooled male urine matrices.
Limit of Detection for CT in Pooled Vaginal Swab Matrix
Elementary bodies from two CT serovars, ATCC vr885 serovar D and ATCC vr879
serovar H, were purified by centrifugation through a 30% sucrose cushion and titered
by enumeration of elementary bodies using transmission electron microscopy. Each
serovar was diluted into pooled negative vaginal swab matrix and tested with the
Xpert CT/NG Assay. Replicates of 20 were evaluated at eight concentrations for CT
2 2

--- Page 23 ---
serovar D and at seven concentrations for CT serovar H and LoDs were estimated by
probit analysis. The claimed LoDs were confirmed by analyzing at least 20 replicate
samples with elementary bodies diluted to the estimated LoD concentrations. For this
study, the claimed LoD is defined as the lowest concentration at which 95% of at
least 20 replicates are positive.
The claimed LoD for purified CT serovar D elementary bodies (EB) in vaginal swab
matrix is 84 EB/mL. The claimed LoD for purified CT serovar H elementary bodies
in vaginal swab matrix is 161 EB/mL (Table 13). In this study, LoDs for the
remaining purified CT serovars (in EB/mL) are A (600), B (6), Ba (1900), C (34), E

e. Inclusivity
Analytical reactivity of additional 13 serotypes and 30 additional NG strains was
evaluated in the LoD studies above.
f. Interference
The analytical performance of the assay was evaluated in the presence of potentially
interfering substances that may be found in vaginal/endocervical swab and urine
specimens. Potentially interfering exogenous substances were diluted into
vaginal/endocervical swab simulated matrix and urine matrix containing two different
mixtures of CT and NG cells. The first mixture contained CT serovar D and NG
strain ATCC 49226, each at the 5x LoD concentration. The second mixture contained
CT serovar H and NG strain ATCC 19424, each at the 5x LoD concentration.
The following table lists the highest concentration of each potential interferent tested,
at which no assay interference was observed for samples in vaginal/endocervical
matrix.

h. Carryover/Cross-contamination
A study was conducted to demonstrate that single-use, self-contained GeneXpert
cartridges prevent carry-over contamination in negative samples run following very
high positive samples in the same GeneXpert module. The study consisted of a
negative sample processed in the same GeneXpert module immediately following a
sample with high CT spike (1.9 x 104 EB/mL) and a high NG spike (5.2 x 105
CFU/mL). Two sample types were used for this testing: a) known pooled negative
urine samples; and b) known pooled negative swab samples. Each sample type was
tested in each of four GeneXpert modules for a total of 44 runs for both swab and
urine samples resulting in 20 positives and 24 negatives. All 40 positive samples
were correctly reported as CT DETECTED; NG DETECTED. All 48 negative
samples were correctly reported as CT NOT DETECTED; NG NOT DETECTED.
There was no cross-contamination observed during this study.
i. Assay cut-off:
The valid cycle threshold (Ct) range for the C. trachomatis CT1 analyte, the N.
gonorrhoeae analyte 1 (NG2), the N. gonorrhoeae analyte 2 (NG4), and the Sample
Adequacy Control (SAC) is 12 to 45. The valid Ct range for the Sample Processing
Control (SPC) is 25 to 45. For a valid “NG DETECTED” result, Cts for both N.

These cutoffs maximize sensitivity without specificity falling below 98%. The cutoff
of 45 Cts for each target was validated in the clinical study.
2. Comparison studies
a. Comparison with predicate device:
The comparison studies were conducted in a clinical study with prospectively
collected samples (see the Clinical studies section below).The performance of the
Xpert CT/NG assay with patient specimens was evaluated by comparison to a Patient
Infected Status (PIS) algorithm based on a combination of results from two sample
types (matrices) each tested by two predicate devices. A patient was considered
infected (I), for CT or for NG, if at least one positive result for the respective
organism was obtained from each reference assay. Any other combination of results
was categorized as not infected (NI). In this study, reference testing was performed
using endocervical swab specimens and urine specimens from females, and urethral
swabs and urine specimens from male patients. Result obtained by Xpert CT/NG
assay for each claimed specimen type (female endocervical swabs and self-collected
vaginal swabs, female urine specimens and male urine specimens) was evaluated
against the Patient Infected Status (PIS). One exception was made for females with
positive results on both reference urine specimens and negative results on both
reference swab specimens; these patients were categorized as infected (I) for urine
and not infected (NI) for the swab specimens.
The table below shows the results from symptomatic and asymptomatic females
designated as infected or not infected with CT based on the PIS algorithm.

b. Matrix comparison:
Each claimed specimen type was evaluated individually against the Patient Infected
Status algorithm, as presented above.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Prospective Clinical Studies:
The performance of the Xpert CT/NG assay was evaluated in a multi-site investigational
study comparing the Xpert CT/NG Assay on the GeneXpert instrument systems to a
patient infected status algorithm (PIS) based on results from the BD ProbeTec™ ET
Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae Amplified DNA Assays, and the
Gen-Probe® APTIMA Combo 2® Assay. The study included prospectively collected
male urine, male urethral swab, female urine, endocervical swab, and patient-collected
vaginal swab (collected in a clinical setting) specimens. Specimens included in the study
were collected at 36 geographically diverse sites (including four sites located in the
United Kingdom) from consenting asymptomatic and symptomatic, sexually active males
and females seen at locations including, but not limited to: OB/GYN, sexually
transmitted disease (STD), teen, public health, and family planning clinics. All reference
testing was conducted at one of two central testing laboratories. Collection-only sites also
shipped specimens to laboratories for Xpert testing. Collection and testing sites
conducted Xpert testing on site. There were 36 collection sites and 15 testing sites. Nine
testing sites used the GeneXpert Dx system, five sites used the GeneXpert 16 system and
one site used the Infinity 48 and the Infinity 80 systems. Site personnel performing the
Xpert CT/NG Assay testing were trained prior to performing any study procedures. The
training included the minimum requirements to be eligible for CLIA moderate
complexity. Three external controls (commercially available), one positive for Neisseria
gonorrhoeae, one positive for Chlamydia trachomatis and one negative (human cell line)
control, were run each day of testing to monitor the performance of the Xpert CT/NG
Assay. A total of 1525 controls were run during the study (502 negative, 525 CT positive,
498 NG negative).
The study subjects ranged from 17 to 61 years of age. Each female study participant
provided three endocervical swabs, one self-collected vaginal swab (collected in a

clinical setting), and one urine specimen. Each male study participant provided one urine
specimen and two urethral swabs.
Performance of the Xpert CT/NG Assay was calculated relative to the PIS for each of the
three female sample types (endocervical swabs, patient-collected vaginal swabs and
urine), and male urine.
Performance with Chlamydia trachomatis
Among the 3781 females, a total of 212 female subjects were infected with CT.
Symptoms were reported in 41.0% (87/212) of infected and 34.1% (1221/3579) non-
infected female subjects. Among the 3444 males, 196 male subjects were infected with
CT. The calculated sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values (based on the prevalence
of infection observed during the study) of the Xpert CT/NG Assay for CT, compared
against the PIS algorithm, are presented by gender, sample type, and symptom status in
the following table.

5. Expected values:
The prevalence of infection with CT and/or NG in patient populations depends on risk factors
such as age, gender, the presence or absence of symptoms, the type of clinic, and the
sensitivity of the test used to detect infections. During the clinical evaluation of the Xpert
CT/NG Assay, the observed CT prevalence rates in females and males were 5.4% and 5.7%,
respectively. The observed NG prevalence rates in females and males were 1.4% and 3.5%,
respectively.
Positive and Negative Predictive Values
Hypothetical estimated positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) for different
prevalence rates using the Xpert CT/NG Assay are shown in tables below. These
calculations are based on a hypothetical prevalence and the overall sensitivity and specificity
(compared to the patient infected status) of the Xpert CT/NG Assay observed during the
multi-center clinical study.
In patient-collected vaginal swab specimens, the overall sensitivity and specificity for CT
were 99.5 and 99.1%, respectively. The overall sensitivity and specificity for NG were 100%
and 99.9%, respectively. The following table shows PPV and NPV for patient-collected
vaginal swab specimens using hypothetical prevalence rates.

· GeneXpert Infinity-80 System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Automated
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this
line of product types:
Yes ___x___ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identification is performed with a barcode scanner or by manually entering the
information into GeneXpert system software.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimen handling (once loaded test cartridge) is performed in either an Automation Mode
or in a Manual Mode. In the Automation Mode, test cartridges are placed on a conveyor belt,
picked up by a gantry, and introduced into an available module for processing.
5. Calibration:
Calibration is performed by Cepheid prior to installation. Cepheid recommends the
GeneXpert Infinity-80 System be recalibrated after 1 year of use or at 2000 tests per
instrument module, whichever comes first. The user does not calibrate or perform any
serviceable functions on the instruments.
6. Quality Control:
The integrity of the system is verified and controlled by specific hardware/software checks
during the cartridge load process, and during the test itself. During each test, the system uses
internal controls included in each cartridge to monitor the sample processing, check for PCR
inhibition and to ensure that the sample used is adequate. In addition to the internal controls,
the GeneXpert instrument performs a probe check during the first stage of the test. A probe
check verifies the presence and the integrity of the labeled probes. A probe-check status of
Pass indicates that the probe check results meet the programmed acceptance criteria. The
instrument also contains an internal temperature control which ensures that the GeneXpert is
operating within validated heating and cooling specifications. The system is capable of
generating Control Trend reports to check for reagent degradation over time.
