L. Test Principle:
The Avie™ Total Hemoglobin Test utilizes general chemistry reactions to quantify total
hemoglobin in fresh capillary blood and venous blood. The reagent strip consists of two
plastic parts (top and bottom) that “sandwich” the sample between the primary chemistry and
other reaction components. The strip is designed to automatically drive the sequence of
reactions in conjunction with the electronics. When the blood sample is applied to the test
strip, an exact amount is automatically aspirated into the reaction well within the strip. In the
reaction well, the blood sample is incubated and stabilized, and total hemoglobin is then
quantified photometrically. The concentration of total hemoglobin is based on the optical
intensity of the reaction within the quantitative area of the test strip.
M. Performance Characteristics:

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision:
An internal precision study was conducted according to CLSI EP5-A2 using three
samples (low, middle, and high Hb levels). Frozen aliquots of each sample were
thawed daily at room temperature and tested with Avie™ Hb test system. Each
sample was tested twice in the morning and twice in the afternoon (4 replicates per
day) by two operators for 20 days, to generate 80 results per level. For each sample,
the %CVs was calculated for within-day and between-day (total) precision.
All CV% values across all three samples were within the acceptable threshold value
of ≤ 3% for within-run, between-run, between-day and total precision. Results are
summarized below:

An external precision study was conducted at 3 point-of-care sites. The study was
performed with three levels of control materials that represented a low, middle and
high total hemoglobin sample (i.e. targeted at 5.0 g/dL, 10.0 g/dL, and 14.0 g/dL).
Each sample was tested three times a day (beginning, middle, and end of the test day),
and a total of 19 different operators performed the testing using 4 Avie readers and 3
lots of test strips. Summarized combined results are presented in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Eleven samples that spanned a wide range of Hb concentrations were prepared by
mixing various proportions of low and high concentration samples. Testing was
performed in quadruplicate on one Avie™ test system with one lot of test strips.
Observed results were compared to expected results, based on the mathematical
calculations of the proportions. Acceptance criteria were based on recoveries that
were within 10% of the expected values, and r2 value from the linear regression
should be ≥ 0.95. Linear regression was: y=1.0202x-0.1862, R2=0.9953. Based on
the data in this study, the Avie Total Hb Test System is linear between 4.9 and 24.3
g/dL, and the claimed range is 5 to 24 g/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibration is traceable to hemiglobincyanide (HiCN) method.
Controls:
Commercial controls are recommended for use with the Avie™ Hb system. The
controls are marketed under the name Eurotrol (New Jersey, USA), and were cleared
under k963908.
Test Strip Stability:
Closed-vial stability was tested with two whole blood samples (one low and one high

Hb concentration) at specified time intervals (1, 2, 3 and 6 months) at 2-8°C, 25°C,
37°C and 45°C, and at 25°C for in-use stability. Stability results demonstrated an
interim shelf life of 9 months when store at 2–8°C and at room temperature. Shelf
life will be extended upon completion of real-time stability and meeting the
predetermined acceptance criteria. Shipping stress study was performed using test
strips stressed for 3 days at 37°C and then stored at 25°C and strips were also frozen
and thawed for 5 days then stored at 25°C. Data demonstrated interim 9 months
stability for Avie Total Test Strip when stored under these stressed conditions.
d. Detection limit:
See item M.1.b., linearity, above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Studies were performed to assess the effect of potential interferents on the Avie™
Total Hb Test System according to the CLSI EP7-A guideline. Ten (10) substances
(biological and therapeutic) were prepared at noted concentrations, and three levels of
whole blood sample (low, middle, and high levels Hb) were assayed for both neat
(control) and with each substance (on-test) in sextuplicate by the Avie™ system. The
on-test results were compared to the control results. For each interferent, the mean
result, standard deviation (SD), and %CV were calculated for each set of replicates.
The percent recovery was calculated for each sample for each interferent, and
compared to its appropriate control without interferent. All observed differences
were within the 10% specification for all substances across the Hb range. Results are
summarized in the table below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed at 3 U.S clinical sites including an
internal study site to determine the correlation between the AvieTM Total Hb Test
system, against both the HemoCue system and the reference HiCN method. Patient
samples [capillary (fingerstick, FS) and venous blood (K2 EDTA)] were tested using
9 Avie™ Total Hb Readers and 4 test strip lots by staff who are typical of physician’s
office. Fifty to 85 subjects were enrolled at each site, a total of 185 volunteers were
tested. The subjects included males (47%) and females (53%) within the age range of
18 year to 87 years. An additional 40 banked samples were altered for Hb
concentrations at the extremes of the dynamic range, and were tested in order to
assess performance at the lower and upper ends of the dynamic range (5 and 24 g/dL,
respectively).
The acceptance criterion was defined as the correlation coefficient (r) ≥0.9 and slope
was defined as 1.0 ±0.1. In addition, Allowable Total Error (ATE) boundaries for
analytical testing for total hemoglobin were defined to be ± 7.0% of the reference
method.
The summarized regression statistics are shown below for each of the four method
comparisons.

Two sites met all the acceptance criteria except for study site 2, in which the Avie
(venous) versus HiCN (venous) comparison had a slope slightly exceeding the 10%
specification. Sponsor claimed that this was due to the relatively low number of samples
at the extremes of the dynamic range. However, the combined data set across the three
study sites met the specification (slope = 1.04), where the sample set (n = 224) includes
samples at the extremes.

All results were within the pre-specified ATE except for the results for Avie venous
vs. Hemocue. However, a 100% ATE was achieved for Avie venous vs. HiCN
venous, and HiCN is the recognized reference method. No points fell outside the
LER limits for all comparative analyses.
b. Matrix comparison:
An internal matrix comparison study was conducted to establish the equivalency of
fresh and frozen whole blood samples when tested on the Avie™ Total Hb Test
System. Three whole blood samples, targeted at low, middle, and high levels of Hb
(7 to 10 g/dL, 13 to 15 g/dL, and 20 to 22 g/dL, respectively) were tested (n=10) on
the Avie™ system on the day of collection. Aliquots of each sample were prepared
and stored frozen at -70°C overnight, and then re-assayed the next day with the same
lot/serial number of materials. All observed absolute values of the t-statistic were at
≤0.5 within the pre-specified acceptance criteria and the data showed that there was
no significant difference between fresh and frozen whole blood samples.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Reference range was established according to CLSI C28 A3 guidelines. Samples from
185 self-reported healthy individuals were collected and tested with the Avie test system.
Of the 185 volunteers, there were 87 males and 98 females with age ranges between 18
and 87 years. No specific acceptance criteria were pre-established, as this was an
observational study. The Hb results were sorted from low to high concentrations, and the
95% central interval for the Avie Total Hb Test System was identified to be 10.8 g/dL to
17.2 g/dL.

N. Instrument Name:
AvieTM Total Hb Reader
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The test strips are single use and must be replaced in order to perform a new test.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant's Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes __X__ or NO ____
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Fingerstick, capillary whole blood, or a drop of venous whole blood is directly applied
from the finger or vial to the test strip. The test strip is then inserted into the reader.
5. Calibration:
The AvieTM Total Hb reader is factory calibrated and is not user adjustable.
6. Quality Control:
The AvieTM Total Hb reader has an internal control system that performs operational self
checks (optics and software) when the device is turned on. If a malfunction is detected
the reader will display an error message. The sponsor recommends that 3 levels of
external controls be tested prior to running the first patient of the day, at least monthly if
the device has not been used, every 3 months to check storage conditions, to become
familiar with the testing process, to perform training or retraining of testing personnel,
and whenever results do not match other clinical findings or symptoms.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Sample Volume:
11

--- Page 12 ---
Study was performed on three whole blood samples targeted at low, middle, and high levels
of total Hb (approximately 7 to 9, 13 to 15, and 20 to 22 g/dL, respectively) to determine the
effect of sample volume on the device. Each sample was tested in replicates (n = 5) at the
following volumes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 µL. Averages of the replicate results were compared
to the true value as determined by the in-house HiCN method. Based on the acceptance
criteria of the on-test value and true value not greater than 10%, the results demonstrated that
3 µL is the minimum volume required for the Avie™ Total Hb Test system. The system is
resistant to over-sampling, as the blood collection stops once the capillary is filled.
Qualification of In-house HiCN reference method:
The sponsor performed an in-house qualification study due to unavailability of commercial
kits for the HiCN method, or reference laboratories that offer HiCN testing as a routine
service. Studies were performed to qualify HiCN reference method that was used as the
primary accuracy comparator for the Avie™ Total Hb Test System. Experiments to establish
the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) were conducted according to
CLSI EP17-A guide lines. For the in-house qualification study, inter-day precision was
determined by calculating the %CV at each concentration evaluated and should be within 5%
CV. Accuracy was determined by comparison of the measured results to the theoretical
values and recovery was within 90% to 110%. Based on the data generated, the MEC HiCN
in-house method was qualified for use.
Disinfection studies:
The device is intended for point-of-care use. The sponsor claimed that the AvieTM Total Hb
reader is same as Avie A1C reader (k093548) i.e. same foot print, same on-off switch, same
location for strip or/cartridge insertion, and most importantly, the same external plastic
materials are used, therefore allowing the disinfection studies data for Avie A1C to apply to
AvieTM Total Hb reader. Sponsor has provided the cleaning and disinfection studies that
were performed on the Avie A1C meter by an outside commercial testing service to
determine the robustness of the meter to the recommended cleaning and disinfection
protocol, and its effectiveness in preventing the spread of blood borne pathogens, particularly
hepatitis B virus (HBV). Fresh 10% bleach solution (EPA Reg. No: 5813-50) were
validated, demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus for use with the meter. The
sponsor also demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the external
materials of the meter after 650 disinfection and 650 cleaning cycles designed to simulate 3
years of healthcare professional use.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
