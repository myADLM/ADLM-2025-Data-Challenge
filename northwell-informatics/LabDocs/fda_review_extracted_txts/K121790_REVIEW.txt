Instrument The UniCel DxI 800 Access Immunoassay System is a
microcomputer controlled, random-access and continuous-
access instrument. The instrument performs enzyme
immunoassays utilizing paramagnetic particle solid phase and
chemiluminescent detection. A luminometer measures the
amount of light generated by the reaction. The UniCel DxI 800
Access Immunoassay System is designed to be used with
numerous different immunoassays. The system software was
designed such that immunoassays can be added to the system
without changing the system software. A separate assay-specific
protocol file, the APF, is loaded into the system. The APF
contains all assay specific parameters used to process a
particular assay.
To correct thermal sensitivity from ambient temperature
fluctuations that could affect the accuracy of troponin test
results, the sponsor developed a software algorithm that
normalizes troponin results. This solution was implemented
through a combination of system and operating software
changes.

L. Test Principle:
The Access AccuTnI+3 Reagent is a two-site immunoenzymatic (“sandwich”) assay.
Monoclonal anti-cTnI antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase is added to a reaction
vessel along with a surfactant-containing buffer and sample. After a short incubation,
paramagnetic particles coated with monoclonal anti-cTnI antibody are added. The human
cTnI binds to the anti-cTnI antibody on the solid phase, while the anti-cTnI antibody -
alkaline phosphatase conjugate reacts with different antigenic sites on the cTnI molecules.
After incubation in a reaction vessel, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a
magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent
substrate Lumi-Phos* 530 is added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is
measured. The light production is directly proportional to the concentration of cTnI in the
sample. The amount of analyte in the sample is determined from a stored, multi-point
calibration curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor evaluated precision in several studies based on CLSI EP5-A2.
The first 3 studies were conducted at one of 3 ambient temperature conditions. The
first 2 studies performed at 18 and 28°C were performed internally each on 1
instrument and 1 reagent pack lot; however, instruments and reagent lots were
different for the 2 studies. A low spiked patient pool (lp), 3 commercial controls (c),
and one high patient pool (hp), were assayed in replicates of 2, 2 shifts per day, 2 runs
per shift, for a total of 21 shifts (42 runs) over 13 days for a total of 84 test results (n)
per sample.
The third study was performed externally under existing laboratory conditions
(measured temperatures ranged from 21.3ºC to 23.6ºC). Five commercial controls
(ranging from 0.04 to 13.6 ng/mL) were run in duplicate, 2 runs per day for 20 days
for a total of 40 runs for a total of 80 test results (n) per sample. This study was
performed using 1 reagent lot and 1 instrument.
The fourth study was a confirmation study that was run across 8 multiple ambient
temperatures ranging from 18 to 28ºC. The sponsor used a low spiked patient pool
(lp), 3 commercial controls (c), and one high patient pool (hp). These samples were
5

--- Page 6 ---
tested in duplicate per run in a total of 48 runs over 14 days for a total of 96 test
results (n) per sample. The coefficients of variability (CV) were calculated. One
reagent lot and 1 instrument were used in this study. The data from this study is
presented below:

The sponsor also determined the precision of the device using 3 low-level natural
patient sample pools, 2 instrument, 2 reagent lots, multiple ambient temperatures
ranging from 18 to 28ºC and multiple calibration cycles over 12 days. The samples
were assayed in replicates of 2 per run, 2 runs per shift and 2 shifts per day for a total
of 576 test results (n) per sample. The results of the study are summarized below

Field precision studies: The sponsor performed a precision study in-house to
simulate the use of the device by the end user. This study was designed to
incorporate different sources of variability that may be found in the field including:
the simultaneous running of other assays; variability in test request type (e.g., panel,
reflex, stat, and individual testing); variability of ambient temperatures; and
variability of instrument age. The sponsor used quality control material for the study,

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated in accordance with the CLSI EP6-A guideline utilizing 2
reagent lots and 2 instruments at 3 different temperature conditions (from 18 to 28 ºC)
using lithium heparin plasma samples spiked with native cardiac troponin I analyte.
The high and low samples were tested neat in replicates of 8 while each of the 7
intermediate mixtures was tested in replicates of 4. A total of 12 analyses were
performed. The polynomial fit was significant for 10 of the 12 analyses but the
maximum deviation from nonlinearity was 12%. The sponsor claims acceptable
linearity across the reportable range (0.03 to 80 ng/mL).
High Dose Hook Effect: The sponsor demonstrated that there was no high dose hook
effect from the concentration of the S5 calibrator (»80 ng/mL) to 2,094 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Access AccuTnI+3 Calibrators are standardized to an internal standard.
Calibrators are value assigned using primary reference curves and verified using
quality control material and patient samples that must meet pre-determined
specifications.
Calibrator stability: The sponsor claims that the calibrators are stable for 12 months
when stored unopened at -20°C. Once opened, the sponsor claims that the calibrators
are stable for 60 days when stored at 2 to 8°C.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ)
studies were performed following the recommendations in EP17-A2. Testing was

performed over 3 days using 3 reagent lots, 3 instruments and 3 different calibration
and run temperature conditions (from 18 to 28 ºC).
To estimate the LoB, 4 blank samples were measured in replicates of 10 on each day
of testing on each instrument/reagent lot combination at the different temperature
conditions. The sponsor claims that the LoB is 0.004 ng/mL.
To estimate the LoD, 6 native lithium heparin plasma samples containing low levels
of troponin I analyte were measured in 2 runs of 10 replicates each during each day of
testing on each instrument/reagent lot combination at the different temperature
conditions. The sponsor claims an LoD of 0.008 ng/mL.
To estimate the LoQ, 11 native lithium heparin plasma samples containing low levels
of troponin I analyte were measured in 2 runs of 10 replicates each during each day of
testing on each instrument/reagent lot combination at the different temperatures.
The sponsor claims that the LoQ is 0.03 ng/mL with a performance goal of < 20%
CV (within-lab). The lowest concentration with a CV (within-lab) < 10% was
estimated to be 0.04 ng/mL.
The sponsor provided data demonstrating that the LoQ of the device using serum
samples at 3 different temperature conditions (from 18 to 28 ºC) is identical to the
LoQ of the device using lithium heparin plasma samples.
The reportable range of the device is 0.03 to 80 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Two levels of potential interfering substances were added to lithium heparin plasma
pools containing either 0.05 or 0.5 ng/mL troponin. For the controls, the
corresponding solvent was added to the lithium heparin plasma pools containing
either 0.05 or 0.5 ng/mL troponin. Control troponin samples (control sample) and
samples spiked with the potential interferents (test sample) were tested in replicates of
5 (for the 0.5 ng/mL samples) at 3 different temperature conditions (from 18 to 28 ºC)
or 10 (for the 0.05 ng/mL samples) and compared. The sponsor used a total of 4
reagent lots and 5 instruments for the studies; however, each individual condition,
(paired sample and test, at a given temperature) was tested on one instrument and one
reagent lot. The sponsor concluded that the following substances at the listed
concentrations did not interfere with the performance of the device.

Cross-reactivity: To evaluate cross reactivity, the substances shown in the following
table were added to lithium heparin plasma pools containing 2 levels of troponin (<
0.03 ng/mL and approximately 0.5 ng/mL). Control and test samples were tested on
5 instruments and 3 reagent lots at 3 temperature conditions (from 18 to 28 ºC) in
replicates of 10 for the low troponin samples (<0.03 ng/mL) and replicates of 5 for
the high troponin samples (0.05 ng/mL). Each individual condition (paired sample
and test, at a given temperature) was tested on one instrument and one reagent lot.
For each possible cross-reactant tested, the troponin I concentration (ng/mL) obtained
for the spiked sample was compared to the troponin I concentration obtained with the
control sample and applied to the following formula: % cross reactivity = [(mean
dose of spiked – mean dose of control)/amount of cross reactant spiked] X 100. The

HAMA/Heterophile antibodies: The sponsor provided results demonstrating that
their formulation reduces the effects of HAMA interferents. They include the
following in the Limitations of the Procedure section of the Instructions for Use:
“For assays employing antibodies, the possibility exists for interference by
heterophile antibodies in the patient sample. Patients who have been regularly
exposed to animals or have received immunotherapy or diagnostic procedures
utilizing immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin fragments may produce antibodies,
e.g. HAMA, that interfere with immunoassays. Additionally, other heterophile
antibodies such as human anti-goat antibodies may be present in patient samples.
Such interfering antibodies may cause erroneous results. Carefully evaluate the
results of patients suspected of having these antibodies.”

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
A clinical study was performed to evaluate the clinical performance of the device at
the different cut-offs. A multicenter prospective study enrolled 1929 patients from
Emergency Departments presenting with chest pain or equivalent ischemic symptoms
suggestive of Acute Coronary Syndromes. Final diagnoses were adjudicated by an
independent panel of expert physicians using criteria consistent with the 2007
Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction from the ESC/ACC/AHA/WHF Task
Force for the Redefinition of Myocardial Infarction. Serial samples were collected
from patients within 9 hours of presentation to the ER. The sample collection times
were at baseline, 1 to 3 hours, 3 to 6 hours and 6 to 9 hours after presentation to the
ER. Investigators and adjudicators were blinded to the proposed device’s results.
Adjudicators were also blinded to site diagnoses. All results presented below were
based on the adjudicated diagnoses. Testing was performed using lithium heparin
plasma samples. The results are summarized below:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor conducted a multicenter prospective study to establish the 99th percentile
upper reference limit in a population of apparently healthy adults with no known diseases
of the cardiovascular system or other serious acute or chronic diseases or infections.
Lithium heparin plasma samples were evaluated. Five-hundred twenty seven (527)
subjects were enrolled at seven geographically diverse locations. Both male and female
subjects were included in the reference range study to determine the 99th percentile upper
reference limit.
The 99th percentile upper reference limit was < 0.03 ng/mL (the LoQ of the assay).

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
The sponsor performed several studies to evaluate the performance of the corrective thermal
algorithm designed to correct thermal sensitivity from ambient temperature fluctuations that
could affect the accuracy of troponin test results.
Ambient temperature method comparison studies: The sponsor provided data from 2 studies
to demonstrate the impact of ambient temperature differences on the test result. These
studies focused on troponin concentrations around the cut-offs (0.03 to 0.477 ng/mL for
study 1; 0.03 to 0.590 ng/mL for study 2). At least 382 unaltered lithium heparin plasma
patient samples were tested at different temperature conditions (ranging from 18 to 28ºC) on
multiple instruments using multiple reagent lots. Samples were divided into 3 aliquots, and
tested at 3 different temperature conditions (either 18, 22 and 26 ºC or 20, 24 and 28 ºC).
Using Passing-Bablok regression analyses comparing the test results obtained at the different
temperatures (i.e., 18 vs 26 ºC, 18 vs 22 ºC and 22 vs 26 ºC or 20 vs 28 ºC, 20 vs 24 ºC and
24 vs 28 ºC), the sponsor demonstrated that there was no significant systemic bias observed
when comparing test results obtained between 18 and 28°C.
The sponsor performed an additional study using at least 118 lithium heparin plasma patient
samples, 2 instruments and 1 lot of reagents. The samples were divided into 3 aliquots and
were tested at each of three temperatures (18, 23 and 28 ºC). A calibration curve was
established at each of the 3 temperatures. Individual sample results were calculated from the
calibration curve established at each temperature (i.e., results generated at 18 ºC were
calculated from the calibration curves at 18, 23, and 28 ºC). Using Passing Bablok
regression analyses comparing the test results obtained at the different calibration and run
temperatures (i.e., 18 vs 23 ºC, 23 vs 28 ºC and 28 vs 18 ºC), the sponsor demonstrated that
there was no significant systemic bias observed when comparing test results obtained when
samples were run and calibrated at temperatures between 18 and 28°C.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
