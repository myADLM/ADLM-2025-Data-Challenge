H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of Flu A+B is a rapid chromatographic
immunoassay for the direct and qualitative detection of influenza A and B viral nucleoprotein
antigens from nasopharyngeal wash/aspirate and swab samples in transport media from
symptomatic patients. The BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu A+B is a
differentiated test, such that influenza A viral antigens can be distinguished from influenza B
viral antigens from a single processed sample using a single device. The test is to be used as
an aid in the diagnosis of influenza A and B viral infections. A negative test is presumptive
and it is recommended that these results be confirmed by viral culture or an FDA-cleared
influenza A and B molecular assay. Negative test results do not preclude influenza viral
infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management
decisions. The test is not intended to detect influenza C antigens.
Performance characteristics for influenza A and B nasopharyngeal (NP) wash/aspirates were
established during January through March of 2011 when influenza viruses A/2009 H1N1,
A/H3N2, B/Victoria lineage, and B/Yamagata lineage were the predominant influenza
viruses in circulation according to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from the CDC
entitled “Update: Influenza Activity—United States, 2010-2011 Season, and Composition of
the 2011-2012 Influenza Vaccine.” Performance characteristics may vary against other
emerging influenza viruses.
Performance characteristics for influenza A and B NP swabs in transport media were
established during February through April of 2012 when influenza viruses A/2009 H1N1,
A/H3N2, B/Victoria lineage, and B/Yamagata lineage were the predominant influenza
viruses in circulation according to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from the CDC
entitled “Update: Influenza Activity—United States, 2011-2012 Season, and Composition of
the 2012-2013 Influenza Vaccine.” Performance characteristics may vary against other
emerging influenza viruses.
If infection with a novel influenza virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent
influenza viruses and sent to the state or local health department for testing. Virus culture
should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and

I. Device Description:
The BD Flu A+B test is a chromatographic assay to qualitatively detect influenza A and B
viral nucleoprotein antigens in samples processed from respiratory specimens (NP
wash/aspirates and NP swab samples in transport media). The patient specimen is mixed in a
prefilled unitized tube containing mucolytic agents that function to break down mucus in a
patient specimen thereby exposing viral antigens. The processed specimen is added to the test
device where influenza A or influenza B viral antigens bind to anti-influenza antibodies
conjugated to detector particles on the A+B test strip. The antigen-conjugate complex
migrates across the test strip to the reaction area and is captured by an antibody line on the
membrane. Results are interpreted by the BD Veritor™ System Reader, a portable electronic
device which uses a reflectance-based measurement method to evaluate the line signal
intensities on the assay test strip, and applies specific algorithms to determine the presence or
absence of any target analyte(s). A liquid crystal display (LCD) on the instrument
communicates the results to the operator.

L. Test Principle:
The BD Flu A+B test is a chromatographic assay to qualitatively detect influenza A and B
viral antigens (nucleoproteins) in NP wash/aspirates specimens and NP swabs in transport
media. The patient specimen is mixed in a prefilled unitized tube containing RV Reagent C
and added to the test device. RV Reagent C contains mucolytic agents that function to break
down mucus in a patient specimen thereby exposing viral antigens and enhancing detection
in the assay device. Processed specimens are expressed through a filter tip into a single
sample well on the BD Flu A+B test device.
The processed specimen flows through the test device where influenza A or influenza B viral
antigens bind to anti-influenza antibodies conjugated to detector particles on the A+B test
strip. The antigen-conjugate complex migrates across the test strip to the reaction area and is
captured by an antibody line on the membrane. The assay utilizes a proprietary enhanced
colloidal-gold particle at the test lines as the means for identifying the presence of influenza
A or B viral antigens and requires the use of the BD Flu A+B Veritor System Reader.
The BD Flu A+B test devices are designed with five spatially-distinct zones including
positive and negative control line positions, separate test line positions for the target analytes,
and a background zone. The test lines for the target analytes are labeled on the test device as
‘A’ for flu A position, and ‘B’ for flu B position. The onboard positive control ensures the
sample has flowed correctly and is indicated on the test device as ‘C’. Two of the five
distinct zones on the test device are not labeled. These two zones are an onboard negative
control line and an assay background zone. The onboard negative control zone addresses
non-specific signal generation and is not labeled on the test device. The remaining zone is
used to measure the assay background and is also not labeled.
The BD Flu A+B assay incorporates an active negative control feature in each test to identify
and compensate for sample-related, nonspecific signal generation. The BD Veritor™ System
Reader uses a proprietary algorithm which subtracts nonspecific signal at the negative control
line from the signal present at both the Flu A and Flu B test lines. If the resultant test line
signal is above a pre-selected assay cutoff, the specimen is scored as positive. If the resultant
test line signal is below the cutoff, the specimen is scored as negative. Use of the active
negative control feature allows the BD Veritor™ System reader to correctly interpret test
results that cannot be scored visually because the human eye is unable to accurately perform
the subtraction of the nonspecific signal. The BD Veritor™ System Reader measures the
amount of light reflected from various zones along the assay strip. The measurement of the
assay background zone is an important factor during test interpretation as the reflectance is
compared to that of the control and test zones. A background area that is white to light pink
indicates the device has performed correctly. The instrument analyzes the reflectance data to
provide the proper interpretation.

Clinical Performance NP Wash/Aspirates 2010-2011 (k120049):
Performance characteristics for the BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu A+B
test were established using NP wash/aspirate specimens in multi-center clinical studies
conducted at two U.S. trial sites and one Hong Kong trial site during the 2010-2011
respiratory season. A total of 1502 prospective specimens (1002 in the U.S and 500 in
Hong Kong) were evaluated using the BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu
A+B test and PCR. Five specimens were not evaluable because of data reconciliation
issues, an additional 13 were excluded because of insufficient sample volume for
reference method testing and 13 samples were excluded as “Result Invalid” (for an
invalid rate of 0.9% [13/1484]).
The prospective specimens consisted of NP washes and aspirates from symptomatic
patients. 49% of the samples were from females and 51% from males. 56.6% were from
patients less than or equal to 5 years of age, 21.9% of the patients tested were in the 6-21
year age group, 5.7% were from 22-59 years of age, and 15.8% were obtained from
persons greater than or equal to 60 years (the patient age was not provided for 0.1% of
samples). The performance of the BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu A+B
test was compared to an FDA-cleared Influenza A and B molecular assay (PCR).

Clinical Performance NP Swab in Transport Media 2011-2012; U.S.
Performance characteristics for the BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu A+B
test were established using NP swabs in transport media in multi-center studies conducted
at six clinical trial sites located in geographically diverse areas within the United States.
A total of 217 prospective specimens were evaluated using the BD Veritor System for
Rapid Detection of Flu A+B test and PCR. Two specimens were not evaluable because of
data reconciliation issues, one was eliminated because of an invalid control reading and
13 were excluded because the PCR results were unresolved.
The specimens consisted of NP Swab in transport media from symptomatic patients.
55.8% of the samples were from females and 44.2% from males. 16.1% were from
patients less than or equal to 5 years of age, 25.3% were from patients 6-21 years of age,
47.5% were from patients 22-59 years of age, and 11.1% were obtained from patients
greater than or equal to 60 years of age.
For testing specimens with the BD Veritor Flu A+B test, sites were instructed to follow
the procedures outlined in the draft package insert. Briefly, NP swab in 1 mL of transport
media was vortexed or thoroughly mixed and 300 µL of the specimen was transferred
into the unitized tube containing RV Reagent C using the exact volume disposable
pipette. The attached filter tip was snapped in place and three drops of the mixture were
added to the sample well of the BD Flu A+B device. After 10 minutes at room
temperature the device was inserted into the BD Veritor™ System Reader for
interpretation. Visual interpretation of results was not permitted from the device.
The performance of the BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu A+B test was
compared to an FDA-cleared Influenza A and B molecular assay (PCR). Briefly, nucleic
acids were extracted from specimens using the indicated extraction system according to
the package insert. An internal control (IC) was added to each specimen prior to
extraction in order to monitor for inhibitors of PCR present in the extracted samples.
Amplification was carried out for 50 cycles using the indicated instrument according to
the assay procedure described in the package insert. Interpretation of PCR results for all

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The overall prevalence observed with an FDA-cleared influenza A and B molecular assay
in the U.S. during the 2010-2011 clinical study was 23.9% for influenza A and 7.5% for
influenza B. At the clinical site located in Hong Kong, the prevalence observed with the
same FDA-cleared influenza A and B molecular assay was 7.2% for influenza A and
3.4% for influenza B.
The prevalence from the six participating U.S. sites during the 2011-2012 clinical study
with an FDA-cleared influenza A and B molecular assay was 31.7% for influenza A and
4.5% for influenza B. At the five clinical sites located in Japan, the prevalence observed
with the same FDA-cleared influenza A and B molecular assay was 0% for influenza A
and 89 % for influenza B.
N. Instrument Name:
BD Veritor System Reader
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Veritor System Reader is a small, battery powered, bench top instrument that is used
to read the Veritor lateral flow test cassette. After the extracted patient sample has been
added to the test cassette, the test is developed at room temperature for 10 minutes. The
cassette is then placed into the reader where it is scanned. The cassette is divided into
distinct zones where the analyzer reads the negative background, positive control, and the
Influenza A and B specific zones. The reader applies an algorithm to determine the
background of the test as well as the specific signal from the A or B test zones. The
reader has a finite number of reads and will prompt the end-user as the total number of
reads approaches the lifetime of the unit.
2. Software:
The Veritor System Reader is the identical instrument that has been reviewed and cleared
with the 510(k) BD influenza A and B assay k112277. FDA has reviewed applicant’s
instrument Hazard Analysis and software development processes for this instrument and
for this analyte. Please refer to decision summary for k112277.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Not Applicable
5. Calibration:
The Veritor Reader is not configurable by the end user and is designed to have a finite
lifetime based on number of tests performed or shelf life from date of manufacture.
Device calibration is not required, however, a verification device is provided with the
reader to monitor the device function.
6. Quality Control:
Each BD Flu A+B test strip is designed with spatially-distinct zones containing a positive
and negative internal controls. The positive control zone ensures that the sample has
flowed correctly, and the negative control zone serves to monitor non-specific signal
generation. The BD Veritor™ System Reader determines the line intensity at each of the
spatially-defined control zones and utilizes specific algorithms to determine the presence
or absence of any target analyte. The BD Veritor™ System Reader must be used to read
the BD Flu A+B test devices, as these devices cannot be interpreted visually by the user.
In addition to the two internal controls, each BD Flu A+B kit contains the following
external controls:
1. Control A+/B- is a dry swab control that contains inactivated recombinant influenza A
nucleoprotein antigen and is tested in a similar manner as patient specimens and is used
as an external control. A positive flu A test result and a negative flu B test result on the
reader LCD display confirm that the operator performed the test correctly.
2. Control B+/A- is a dry swab control that contains inactivated recombinant influenza B
nucleoprotein antigen and is tested in a similar manner as patient specimens and is used
as an external control. A positive flu B test result and a negative flu A test result on the
reader LCD display confirm that the operator performed the test correctly.
The BD Flu A+B device is to be read only by the instrument and cannot be read
manually. At a minimum, the external dry swab controls should be run as a quality
control procedure for each new lot and new shipment received. Controls should be tested
in accordance with local, state and/or federal regulations or accreditation requirements
and the standard Quality Control procedures. If desired, appropriate reagent performance
and proper testing technique may also be determined by using specimens qualified as
positive or negative for the influenza A or B virus. The user is instructed not to use the
BD Flu A+B test results if control A+/B- and control B+/A- do not yield appropriate
results.
