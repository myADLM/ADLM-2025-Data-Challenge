L. Test Principle:
The ChloroChek Chloridometer sweat chloride analyzer operates according to the principle
of coulometeric titration. Two silver electrodes (anode and cathode), are dipped into a
measuring vessel filled with working solution consisting of an acid buffer and a colloid
stabilizer. A constant current (generator current) flows between the anode and cathode. The
acid buffer provides hydrogen ion (H+) which is reduced to H at the cathode. A generator
2
current flows between the anode and cathode at a constant rate thereby releasing a constant
number of silver ions (Ag+) from the anode. Any chloride (Cl-) from the sample dissociates
and binds to the free silver ions in solution forming silver chloride (AgCl) which is kept in
solution with the colloid stabilizer. The measuring electrode senses the change in potential
when excess Ag+ are present due to the exhaustion of available Cl- from the sample. The
results are a direct readout of the titrated Cl- ions.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Using CLSI EP5A2, repeatability was performed using 1 ChloroChek Chloridometer
sweat chloride analyzer and 1 reagent lot.
Within run precision was obtained by performing 2 runs per day, two measurements
per run for 1 standard (100 mmol/L) and 3 concentrations of control materials (Low,
Medium, and High ), using one ChloroChek analyzer and one reagent lot (n=80) for
20 days. The results were:
Sample Mean(mmol/L) SD %CV
Low Sweat Control 23.0 0.55 2.4%
Medium Sweat Control 49.7 0.72 1.4%
High Sweat Control 98.9 0.82 0.8%
Total precision study was performed using 2 ChloroChek analyzers, 2 reagent lots
and 3 operators. 3 levels of control materials, and 2 Standard Solutions were

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity study was based on CLSI EP6-A. 11 samples covering the measuring
range of the ChloroChek test system were formulated using NIST traceable NaCl
(SRM 2201) and analyzed in triplicate on 1 instrument with one reagent lot. Results
were analyzed using 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order least-squared regression to obtain the linear
and non-linear regression coefficients. Results were as follows:
Dilution Mean Expected values mmol/L Difference Observed - Expected
0% 8.4 8.4 0.0

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The ChloroChek Chloridometer is factory calibrated. Calibration is verified using the
100 mmol/L NaCI/H2O Standard Solution.
The 100 mmol/L NaCI/H2O Standard Solution and is purchased from a
commercially available source. The value is gravimetrically assigned and verified on
the Wescor ChloroChek. Stability and storage protocols were reviewed and found to
be acceptable. Conditions were evaluated and verified for the following temperature
and time limits: open vial stability 23-34°C for 30 minutes, closed vial stability 5-
45°C for 60 months.
The Wescor Sweat Controls consist of Low, Medium and High chloride
concentrations and are purchased from a commercially available source. Value
assignment of the controls for the ChloroChek Chloridometer is performed by
averaging multiple replicates on one instrument and multiplying the means by ± 0.10
to determine the expected assigned ranges for each control level. Stability and
storage conditions protocols were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor
claims open vial stability 23-34°C for 60 minutes and closed vial stability 25°C until
expiration date in labeling.
Shelf life stability for the ChloroChek Reagent protocols were reviewed and found to
be acceptable. Conditions were evaluated and verified for the following temperature
and time limits: stability for 3 years after manufacturing when stored at 5-45°C.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of the Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) studies were based on CLSI
EP17-A2. Distilled water was used as a blank solution and analyzed 60 times. Mean,
median and SD were calculated.
LoB = 0 mmol/L
LoD studies were performed using 4 diluted sample pools prepared from 4 different
Sweat Control lots in order to obtain a concentration close to four times the calculated
value of the LoB. The data were not Gaussian, therefore, the sponsor calculated the
LoD with the formula LoD = LoB+D where D is determined by calculating the
sβ sβ
median minus the 5th percentile of low concentration of the sample distribution.
LoD = 0.0 + [(4.6 + 4.7)/2] = 4.65 mmol/L

e. Analytical specificity:
CLSI C34-A3, Sweat Testing: Sample Collection and Quantitative Chloride
Analysis; Approved Guideline—Third Edition was referenced for specificity
information for the ChloroChek based on the technology used by this device. CLSI
states in section 9.6 that "In addition to chloride, other halides such as bromide and
iodide are also detected using a chloridometer. Therefore, if a sweat sample contains
other halides in addition to chloride, they will be detected and can falsely elevate the
sweat chloride result."
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Sweat samples were collected from 2 locations using an FDA cleared sweat collection
device (k853973) from 80 individuals. The ages of the participants ranged from 17
months to 67 years old. The natural samples ranged from ≤ 10 to 100 mmol/L. In
order to cover the measuring range, 9 spiked samples were added (n=89) to cover the
high end of the range (131-160). Singlicate results from the ChloroChek test system
were compared to the calculated mean of duplicate analyses for each sample on the
predicate. Linear regression was calculated with results shown below:
Slope (95% CI) Intercept (95% CI) R2
0.9999 (0.976, 1.022) 0.875 (-0.659, 2.410) 0.9886
Classification of samples as negative, intermediate, and indicative of Cystic Fibrosis
(CF) were made following the labeled instructions for expected ranges for sweat
chloride.
