L. Test Principle:
The ARCHITECT HbA1c assay is a two-step pre-treatment immunoassay for the quantitative
determination of percent hemoglobin A1c (% HbA1c) in human whole blood using CMIA
technology, with flexible assay protocols, referred to as Chemiflex.
Sample is incubated with pre-treatment reagent to lyse the red blood cells. Pre-treated
sample is then incubated with magnetic microparticles with a silica surface. Hemoglobin and
HbA1c in the sample bind to the silica surface of the microparticles. Following a wash cycle,
anti-HbA1c acridinium- labeled conjugate chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative
light units (RLUs).
The hemoglobin and HbA1c that are bound to the surface of the microparticles represents the
total percentage present in the sample however, only the HbA1c result is required to
determine the % HbA1c in the sample. A direct relationship exists between the amount of
HbA1c in the sample and the RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT i System optics.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed in accordance with the CLSI EP5-A2 guideline.
Two ARCHITECT i 2000SR analyzers and two lots of ARCHITECT HbA1c reagents
and calibrators were used throughout the study. One reagent lot and one calibrator lot
were assigned to each instrument.
Three levels of HbA1c, derived from natural patient samples were assayed for
imprecision assessments in replicates of two, twice daily, for 20 days (n=80)
observations for each control per combination. A summary of the imprecision data is
summarized in the tables below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated according to CLSI-06A. A high HbA1c patient sample (15.8%
HbA1c) was diluted in Calibrator A (4.0% HbA1c) to achieve a total of 9 intermediate
samples covering the assay range. All intermediate dilutions were run in replicates of 5
with randomized run orders. The mean observed %HbA1c value was determined for
each intermediate dilution and plotted versus the relative analyte concentration.
The linear regression equation is as follows:
y=0.96x- 0.09, r2 = 0.98
The study supports that the Architect HbA1c assay is linear across the range of 4.0 to
15.8 % HbA1c.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The Architect HbA1c assay standardization is traceable to the International Federation of
Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) reference calibrators. The Architect HbA1c assay is NGSP
certified. The NGSP certification expires in one year. See NGSP website for current
certification at http://www.ngsp.org.
Two different units of measure are provided to the users: NGSP equivalent units
(%HbA1c) and IFCC equivalent units (mmol/mol).
Value Assignment
The ARCHITECT HbA1c calibrators are aligned to IFCC reference calibrators through
internal value assignment in which calibrator values must meet the sponsor’s pre-
determined acceptance criteria fall within a set specification, determined by the
manufacturer.
The sponsor recommends using commercially available control material containing
HbA1c.
Stability
Shelf-life claims: Un-opened calibrators can be stored at -20°C until expiration date (52
weeks).
Open-vial claims: The recommended storage condition for in-use calibrators is -20°C and
is stable for 30 days. The labeling recommends not to freeze-thaw calibrator more than 3
times.
On-board stability for the ARCHITECT HbA1c was established by real time studies on
the ARCHITECT i2000SR instrument and demonstrated on-board reagent stability of 30
days. The ARCHITECT HbA1c is stable until the expiration date printed on the label
when stored at 2 to 8°C.
The storage and stability study protocols and acceptance criteria provided by the
sponsor were reviewed and found acceptable to support the claimed conditions.

d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by assaying an in vitro non glycated
hemoglobin material (blank) for a total of 60 measurements. Each sample was
assayed in two runs over 2 days using two ARCHITECT i2000SR analyzers with
two reagent lots (each lot tested on each analyzer) to give a total of four data sets
with 15 results per sample according to CLSI guideline EP17A.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined by assaying 4 low level (< 4.0%)
HbA1c samples in two runs over two days using two ARCHITECT i2000SR
analyzers with two reagent lots (each lot tested on each analyzer) to give a total of 60
results per reagent/instrument combination (15 results per sample) according to CLSI
guideline EP17A.
Limit of Quantitation: The sponsor states that the standard calibrators for the assay
have a lower limit of 4.0% and the instrument will report results below 4% as
“<4.0%”.
The ARCHTECT HbA1c assay detection limits are summarized in the table
below:
ARCHITECT i2000SR HbA1c
LoB LoD LoQ
2.7% 2.8% 4.0%
The assay has a reportable range on the ARCHITECT HbA1c of 4.0-15.8%.
e. Analytical specificity:
i.) An interference study was performed based on CLSI EP7-A2 guideline to
assess common or known substances that could interfere with the ARCHITECT
HbA1c assay. The potential interferents listed below were spiked into human
EDTA whole blood samples with different levels of % HbA1c (approximately 6.5
and > 8.0% HbA1c). Each sample was tested in duplicate. The % HbA1c values
of the spiked samples were compared to reference samples. The sponsor
considered ≤ ±10% as their acceptance criterion.
The interferents study results are summarized in the following table

interference (≥±10%) was observed

ii.) Effect of Total Hemoglobin Levels on Percent HbA1c:
A hemoglobin concentration interference study was performed with the ARCHITECT
HbA1c assay by testing three IFCC reference controls with a target value of 6.96%
HbA1c. Three levels of HbA1c control samples were used in this study with
hemoglobin concentrations of 7g/dL, 13g/dL and 20g/dL. These samples were
analyzed in duplicate using the ARCHITECT HbA1c assay. The mean concentration
and %CV for the samples of each hemoglobin concentration sample were calculated.
The difference and percent difference between the low hemoglobin and the high
hemoglobin and normal hemoglobin concentration sample were calculated. The
percent difference of HbA1c was all within the sponsor acceptance criteria of ±10%.
The sponsor concluded that total hemoglobin values between the ranges of 7 to 20
g/dL do not interfere with the ARCHITECT HbA1c assay.
iii.) Effect of labile glycated A1c with the ARCHITECT HbA1c assay. High
concentrations of glucose (1400 mg/dL) were spiked into 2 human EDTA whole
blood samples with different levels of % HbA1c (approximately 6.5and > 8.0%) and
incubated for 3 hours at 37°C to generate labile glycated hemoglobin. Mean percent
differences were obtained when comparing samples with glucose levels of 1400
mg/dL to the reference samples (control samples containing no labile HbA1c). The
sponsor concluded that labile A1c does not interfere with the ARCHITECT HbA1c
assay.
iv.) A hemoglobin variant interference study was performed using samples known to
contain Hemoglobin variants HBA2, HbC, HbD, HbE, HbF HbJ and HbS. These
variant samples were tested in duplicate using the ARCHITECT HbA1c assay on
ARCHITECT i 2000SR analyzer. All variants tested showed <10% bias at a HbA1c
concentrations between 4.7 -11.3%.
The sponsor states in the labeling that hemoglobinopathies may interfere with
glycated hemoglobin analysis and that samples containing the following hemoglobin
variants have been shown to interfere with the ARCHITECT HbA1c assay:
Hemoglobin D, Hemoglobin E, Hemoglobin F (>9%) and Hemoglobin S.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study using human EDTA whole blood specimens (n=127)
was performed based on NCCLS Document CLSI EP9-A2 guideline. Each sample
was analyzed in singlicate on the candidate and predicate device. The sample range
tested was 4.07 to 13.61% HbA1c. The linear regression correlation is summarized
below:

b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix study was performed to determine the suitability of different anticoagulant
collection tube types for use in the ARCHITECT HbA1c assay. Twenty (20)
matched non-diabetic samples and twenty (20) matched diabetic samples were
obtained for a total of 40 samples in the following blood collection tubes:
Dipotassium-EDTA (control), Sodium-Fluoride/potassium-EDTA, Fluoride oxalate,
and Lithium Heparin. The actual observed HbA1c levels of samples ranged from
4.4% to 13.3% HbA1c to include samples across the measurable range of the assay.
