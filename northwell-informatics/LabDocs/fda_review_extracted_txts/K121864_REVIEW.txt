a printed card that may be incorporated along with a tear-apart form for the collection
of demographic information. A drop of blood is applied to the filter paper and
allowed to soak through the paper. The sample is then air dried and sent to a
laboratory for analysis in newborn screening.

The PerkinElmer 226 Sample Collection Device is intended to be used directly as a
blood collection device for newborn screening. The device is filter paper card printed
with circles and affixed to a rigid carrier device. The filter paper is touched to a
sufficiently large blood drop to completely fill a preprinted circle. Blood should be
applied to only one side of the filter paper and allowed to uniformly penetrate and
fully saturate the filter paper. The filter paper is then placed in the horizontal position
and allowed to air dry at room temperature away from direct sunlight.

e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was performed to show that printing ink used to
manufacture the device would not interfere with newborn screening assays
across representative platform and assay types. TSH, 17 a-OH-progesterone,
T4 and total galactose assays (incorporating immunometric, competitive and
enzymatic test methods) were run with samples punched to exclude (control)
or include ink on commercially available platforms. Samples were DBS
prepared from heparinized whole blood adjusted to a hematocrit of 47.5%
spiked with analyte concentrations at low, high and near the relevant clinical
decision point. Each concentration was tested in replicates of 12. Results of
the study are summarized in the table below.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study performed by an independent laboratory used
adult whole blood adjusted to a hematocrit of 55% supplemented with various
analytes spotted on both a commercially available device and PKI 226 and
then tested with assays that screen for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH),
hypothyroidism, cystic fibrosis (CF), maple syrup urine disease, fatty acid
oxidation disorders (FAO), and disorders of amino acid metabolism including
phenylketonuria, tyrosinemia, and citrulinemia. The analytes were added at
concentrations below, at, and above relevant clinical cutoffs. Dried blood spot
samples on PKI 226 and the comparator were prepared at a central laboratory.
Six external laboratories performed testing in duplicate using routine testing
assays and provided the line data to the independent lab for statistical analysis
of mean and standard deviation. The assays tested included direct and

competitive immunoassays using both fluorometric and colorimetric readouts
as well as mass spectrometric-based assay methodologies.
All data from PKI 226 for each analyte shows a strong overlap at one standard
deviation with the data derived with samples collected with the comparator
device with a difference of 4-5%. Concurrent longitudinal testing of mean
serum volume testing on six lots of the PKI 226 device showed a similar lot-
to-lot variability (4.66%), therefore the difference between newborn screening
assay data from the two DBS cards is not dissimilar from the lot-to-lot
variability detected for the proposed device.

3. Clinical studies:

b. Clinical specificity:

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
To support the use of PKI 226 in the intended use setting by the intended
users with clinical patient samples, results from a clinical study were
provided. In this study a central laboratory received dried blood spot samples
collected by nurses and/or phlebomists from newborns in a hospital. These
samples provided a population comparison study using 2000 randomly
selected patient samples per disorder that included screening assays for
biotinidase deficiency, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, hypothyroidism, cystic
fibrosis, galactosemia, homocystinuria, maple syrup urine disease,
phenylketonuria, tyrosinemia, citrulinemia, and hemoglobinopathies. The
assays tested included direct and competitive immunoassays using
fluorometry, mass spectrometry, and high performance liquid chromatography
assay methodologies. The testing results for each assay were analyzed for the
mean, median value of each analyte and SD as well as the observed ranges for
the 2000 samples. Results for samples from PKI 226 and a commercially
available device were compared based on the difference between their
calculated medians for the 2000 samples. The median of each analyte for the
PKI 226 data exhibits a percent difference from the predicate that’s within 2-
6% for the immunoassays and 2-10% for the mass spectrometric assays. PKI
226 Data and descriptive statistics are included below.

that PKI 226 appears to recover the same results for hemoglobinopathies.
From a larger population, 2000 samples were randomly selected for PKI 226
and a commercially available paper for comparison in an HPLC-based method
to detect hemoglobinopathies. The frequency results showed that the 95%
confidence intervals for each paper overlapped and had no significant
statistical differences.
