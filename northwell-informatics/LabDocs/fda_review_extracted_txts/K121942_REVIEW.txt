H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
Adenovirus R-gene® US assay is a Real Time PCR in vitro diagnostic test for the rapid
and qualitative detection of Adenovirus viral DNA isolated and purified from
nasopharyngeal swab or nasopharyngeal wash/aspirate specimens obtained from
individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of acute respiratory infection. The intended use
for this test is to aid in the diagnosis of respiratory Adenovirus infections in humans in
conjunction with other clinical and laboratory findings. The test detects, but does not
differentiate, Adenovirus species (A, B, C, D, E, F and G). Negative results do not
preclude Adenovirus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or
other patient management decisions.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
To be used with the Cepheid SmartCycler II utilizing Dx software version 1.7b or 3.0
I. Device Description:
The test is a Taqman-based real-time PCR amplification and detection assay for the detection
of human adenovirus DNA in nasopharyngeal swab and nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash
specimens. The assay uses the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG nucleic acid extraction
system to extract adenovirus DNA from swab or wash specimens obtained from patients with
signs and symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Extracted adenovirus DNA is then
amplified using the Adenovirus R-gene US assay components. Amplification is performed on
the Cepheid SmartCycler II using Dx software versions 1.7b or 3.0.
The Adenovirus R-gene US assay contains the reaction mix (Rx10), internal control (IC2),
molecular-grade water (W0), positive control (PC10), and Package Insert.

collect and test a new sample.
Invalid: Not determined; error code 4098
ND: (Not Determined) if the specimen result is unavailable because the run is in progress or an
error or warning occurred during the run.
* Detection of Internal Control in the Cy3 channel is not required for a positive result. High
viral load can lead to reduced or absent Internal Control signal.
Error Code 3079 can be observed with positives (Adenovirus Positive Control, Adenovirus
positive swab/wash samples) when the fluorescence signal is too high. In this case, all results
for that sample are reported by the Dx software as ND (Not Determined). If a Ct value ≥ 5 is
reported in the Adenovirus Ct columns, the sample results can be recorded as positive for the
specific analyte. There were no 3079 type errors reported among the 1576 prospective clinical
study specimens analyzed.
Error Code 4098: An invalid assay run will display Error Code 4098. One of the controls has
failed and repeat testing should be done starting from the purified nucleic acid and using a new
aliquot of the Positive Control. If repeated results are still invalid, results should not be
reported and testing should be repeated from the original sample or a new sample should be
collected and tested. There were no 4098 type errors reported among the 1576 prospective
clinical study specimens analyzed.

L. Test Principle:
The real-time PCR process simultaneously amplifies and detects nucleic acid targets in a
single closed-tube reaction. The Adenovirus R-gene US assay enables simultaneous detection
of AdV and Internal Control DNA. The whole process is based on two steps: nucleic acid
isolation and Real Time PCR amplification/detection. Human respiratory specimens
(nasopharyngeal swabs, washes/aspirates) from symptomatic patients are processed initially to
isolate and purify viral nucleic acid from the cellular specimen matrix. Each purified nucleic

acid sample is added to the Rx10 amplification premix (Ready to use, Taq polymerase
included). The Rx10 amplification premix contains oligonucleotide primers complementary to
a fragment of the Hexon gene region coding for the hexagonal capsomers for AdV and target-
specific oligonucleotide probes dual-labeled with a reporter dye and a quencher dye. As the
amplification proceeds, the probe anneals specifically to a region of the template between the
forward and reverse primers. As primer extension and amplification occurs, the exonuclease
activity of the Taq polymerase cleaves the probe separating the reporter dye away from the
quencher. This generates an increase in fluorescent signal upon excitation from a LED light
source of appropriate wavelength. With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are
cleaved from their respective probes, yielding increased fluorescence signal. The amount of
fluorescence at any given cycle is dependent on the amount of PCR product (amplicons)
present at that time. Fluorescent intensity is monitored at each PCR cycle by fluorescent
detection modules within the real-time instrument.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The study evaluated the device’s inter-laboratory, inter-assay, and intra-assay
reproducibility for high negative (0.01x LoD), low positive (2x LoD), and moderately
positive (10x LoD) specimens. The precision (repeatability and reproducibility) of the
Adenovirus R-gene US assay was evaluated using human nasal matrix spiked with 3
viral inputs (moderate positive sample, low positive sample, high negative sample). A
within-laboratory (repeatability) precision study was performed at an internal site (5
days, 2 operators, 1 instrument, 1 lot of reagent) and a between laboratory
(reproducibility) precision study was performed at 3 external sites in the U.S. (5 days, 2
operators, 1 instrument at each site, 1 lot of reagent. Test panels consisted of 14
members (12 Adenovirus positive specimens plus two negative controls). Samples
were extracted each day by both operators (5 days x 2 operators = 10 tests per sample)
and tested in triplicate. For the moderate positive samples, 5 samples were present in
the panel for a total of 150 tests (5 samples x 10 tests per sample x 3 replicates = 150)
For low positive samples, 4 samples were present in the panel for a total of 120 tests ( 4
samples x 10 tests x 3 replicates). For high negative samples, there were 3 samples per
panel for a total of 90 tests (3 samples x 10 tests x 3 replicates). Combined results for
all sites and results stratified by site are presented in the tables below.

case, all results for that sample are reported by the Dx software as ND (Not
Determined). If a Ct value ≥ 5 is reported in the Adenovirus Ct columns, the sample
results can be recorded as positive for the specific analyte.
* Detection of Internal Control is not required in the Cy3 channel for a positive
Adenovirus result. High viral load can lead to reduced or absent Internal Control
signal. Detection of IC2 is required for a valid negative Adenovirus result.
d. Detection limit
Prior to the LoD determination, a sequence homology study was performed to classify
the 60 known Human Adenoviruses into 21 different groups. Homology groups were
established according to the number and the position of base mismatches with the best
primer (forward and reverse) and the best probe which comprise the Adenovirus R-
gene US amplification/detection premix.
One Human Adenovirus (AdV) type was chosen from each group of homologies to
represent each of the 21 different sequences. The LoD study was set up so that each
virus was tested using 4, 5, or 6 different dilutions near the estimated LoD and 15
replicates per dilution. Each replicate was taken through the DNA extraction step to
amplification and detection. A total of 22 LoD’s were determined comprising the 21
selected Human Adenoviruses, plus Adenovirus serotype 2 (a member of adenovirus
species C). The homology groups and Adenovirus subtypes/species are displayed in the
table below:

The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined for the Adenovirus R-gene US assay by
limiting dilution analysis of representative Adenoviruses from each of the 21 homology
groups listed above as well as Adenovirus serotype 2. Fifteen replicates of viral
dilutions were tested for Adenovirus positivity over a wide range of dilutions that
surround the empirical LoD. The LoD was established by selecting the highest dilution
of virus which could be detected at least 95% of the time.

* HAdV 52 was not available via organism collections and therefore the LoD was
determined using plasmid DNA. The LoD was calculated to be 5000 copies/ml by qPCR.
e. Analytical reactivity
Cross-Reactivity
A panel of 61 potentially cross-reacting microorganisms (34 viral samples and 27
bacterial samples), representing respiratory pathogens or flora commonly present in the
nasopharynx, was evaluated for cross-reactivity. Each potential cross-reactant was
individually spiked into an Adenovirus negative nasal wash/aspirate at a challenging
concentration. Adenovirus positive samples at 100 and 3 times the limit of detection
(100x LoD and 2x LoD) were also tested. The Adenovirus R-gene US assay did not
cross-react with any of the cross-reactants tested.

Reactivity
No additional strains beyond the 22 tested for LoD were tested for reactivity in
analytical studies.
f. Interference studies:
Interfering Substances
Potentially interfering or inhibitory substances that may be present in nasopharyngeal
swabs or interfere with the PCR reaction were evaluated for the viral strains indicated
below. To determine the potential interference of endogenous and exogenous chemical
PCR inhibitors on Adenovirus detection, clinically relevant amounts of interfering
substances were added to nasopharyngeal samples spiked with Adenovirus at 2x LoD
and 10x LoD. A reference sample with no interfering substance was included at both
10x and 2x LoD.

Detailed chemical interference results are presented in the following table. Note that
the study was performed in two separate runs with half of the potential interferents
tested in run 1 and the other half in run 2. “Reference run 1” is the Adenovirus only
control for the first run. “Reference run 2” is the Adenovirus only control for the
second run. The two Adenovirus only reference samples were tested at concentrations
of 10x LoD and 2x LoD. The data in the column indicating delta Ct values were
calculated by taking the difference in average Ct cycles between the sample containing
the potential chemical interferent and the “reference run” associated with that test.

Microbial Interference
To determine the potential interference of common nasal microorganisms on
qualitative Adenovirus detection, a panel of microorganisms was spiked into
Adenovirus positive NP washes/aspirates containing Adenovirus at two times the limit
of detection (2x LoD). Crossing threshold (Ct) values were compared with a reference
sample with no additional microorganism.

g. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off determination was performed through testing of 218 samples: 98 negative,
67 high negative, and 53 positive. Of the 98 negative samples, all but four were below
20 AFU, four were between 20 and 30 AFU and none were over 30. Of the 67 high
negative samples, 31 were below 20 AFU and 36 were between 20 and 30 AFU. Of the
53 positive samples, all were over 40 AFU. No fluorescence values were obtained
between 30 and 40 AFU among the 218 samples tested. The threshold default value (30
AFU) of the SmartCycler II was confirmed to be the correct cut-off value for the
Adenovirus R-gene US assay.
This cut-off value was further confirmed in a preliminary clinical study, performed at
Caen Hospital (France), on 184 clinical samples, prior to US clinical studies. The cut-
off was then confirmed by analysis of the U.S. clinical studies results at the 3 sites,
New York, Chicago and Memphis. The 30 AFU value was confirmed as the cut-off to
achieve the best sensitivity and specificity.
h. Carryover Contamination:
This study was performed to examine potential carry-over/cross-contamination with
the Adenovirus R-gene US assay by testing simulated human adenovirus (HAdV) high
positive samples run in series with HAdV negative samples. The high positive samples
consisted of negative nasal washes/aspirates spiked with HAdV type 4 at four logs
above the Limit of Detection (LoD). The samples were processed and extracted in a
high positive/negative alternating fashion on the bioMérieux NucliSENS® easyMAG®
extraction system and likewise processed and run on the Cepheid SmartCycler II

3. Clinical studies:
Prospective clinical study:
Performance characteristics of the Adenovirus R-gene US assay were determined in a
multi-center prospective investigational study employing 3 geographically diverse
institutions in the US. The study began with recruitment and testing commencing on
September 28, 2010. Specimens used in the study represent excess nasal specimens
(NPS and NPA) that were collected from symptomatic men and women of all ages
suspected of respiratory infection and submitted for routine care or analysis. Age
ranges for patients providing specimens in the study ranged from 1 month to 101 years.
The database was frozen on November 21, 2011 after testing 1186 swab and 395 NP
wash/aspirate specimens and this dataset was used in the analysis. Two NP
aspirate/wash specimens and three NPS were excluded from the analysis due to

protocol deviations. The Adenovirus R-gene US assay was compared with rapid
culture (shell vial) followed by direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) screening and
identification using the D3Ultra™ Direct Fluorescent Antibody (DFA) Respiratory
Virus screening & ID kit from Diagnostic Hybrids (DHI). Each US site analyzed
around 280-650 samples (swabs and washes/aspirates), for a total of 1576 samples. The
studies were performed on the remnant of the specimen collected from children and
adults after the routine clinical care.
Each sample was tested by Adenovirus R-gene US assay and rapid culture (shell vial)
followed by DFA screening and identification. The Argene and DHI test were
performed according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The shell vial
culture was performed following standard laboratory procedures. The chosen sites were
hospital virology laboratories experienced in DFA, cell culture and real time PCR.
Performances (sensitivity and specificity) of the Adenovirus R-gene US assay were
calculated as compared to the method of viral culture followed by DFA staining with
DHI test.
