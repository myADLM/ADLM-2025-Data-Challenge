I. Device Description:
LIAISON® Direct Renin is an in vitro diagnostic device consisting of reagents
provided in individual compartments within a plastic container called the Reagent
Integral and reagents supplied ready to use in vials. The Reagent
Integral includes: magnetic particles (2.3 ml) and conjugate (13 ml). The assay
configuration allows performance of 100 tests. The components, provided in the
unitized Reagent Integral include: PMP (paramagnetic particles) and conjugate. The
two calibrators A and B are provided in the same box, but separate from the Reagent
Integral. The calibrators are made from recombinant human renin, phosphate buffer,
BSA, an inert yellow dye, preservatives and antibiotics. The calibrators are
lyophilized and must be reconstituted using distilled water prior to use. L1AISON@
Control Direct Renin kit consisting of two levels of control materials are made from
recombinant human rennin phosphate buffer, BSA, preservatives and antibiotics.
Control level 1 is intended to provide an assay response characteristic of low level
patient specimens (target value: 15 pg/mL). Control level 2 is intended to provide an
assay response characteristic of high level patient specimens (target value: 55 pg/mL).

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None identified
L. Test Principle:
The method for the quantitative determination of renin is a sandwich
chemiluminescence immunoassay that uses two anti-renin monoclonal antibodies. One
specific mouse monoclonal antibody is coated on the magnetic particles (solid phase),
that recognizes both renin and prorenin; another monoclonal antibody (specific for
renin) is linked to an isoluminol derivative (isoluminolantibody conjugate). During the
incubation, renin bound to the solid phase and a sandwich is formed only in the
presence of renin molecules that bridge both antibodies. The unbound material is
removed with a wash cycle during post-incubation period. Finally a flash
chemiluminescence reaction is thus induced by a starter reagent and the light signal is
measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) using LIAISON®
Analyzer.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A twenty day reproducibility/precision study was performed to demonstrate the
precision of the assay using six (6) EDTA plasma samples and two controls
that were measured multiple times at three different locations. These studies
were tested on two lots of L1AISON® Direct Renin - 2 lots at each site in two
replicates per run, 2 runs per day for 20 operating days. The overall results are
as follows:

Value Assignment of Calibrators and Controls
The initial lot of calibrator materials is value assigned through an internal
procedure. The value ranges of calibrator A and B are 5-10 pg/ml and 85-125
pg/ml respectively. The calibrators will be tested using the assay and they must
fall within above target ranges. Otherwise, the calibrators will be adjusted by
dilution.
The value of control materials was assigned through an internal procedure. The
procedure includes 1) Check of the bulk preparation 2) Check after
lyophilization and value assignment using approved Reagent Integral lots to
assign the target value 3) Check after labeling and packaging.
The target values of Control level 1 and 2 are 15 pg/mL and 55 pg/mL,
respectively.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of
Quantitation (LoQ) were calculated based on CLSI EP17-A.
Five aliquots of calibrator matrix (without renin) were tested in triplicates in
four runs with two different kit lots on two different instruments (60
determinations per lot), and used to calculate the Limit of Blank (LoB) on
each kit lot, as 95th percentile. The overall assay’s LoB is the higher of the
two kit lot LoBs.
LoB = Mean+ 1.671*SD where SD is the mean standard deviation. The
LoB was calculated to be 0.1.
Then four samples at low renin level were tested in triplicates in four runs
with two different kit lots and instruments. The results of two lots were
used to calculate the Limit of Detection (LoD) (48 determinations per lot)
of each assay lot. The overall assay’s LoD is the higher of the two kit lot
LoDs.
LoD = LoB + 1.68*SD where SD is the mean standard deviation. The LoD
was calculated to be 1.03.
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined as the mean concentration
at which the mean %CV exceeded 20%. It was calculated by testing six
specimens at low renin doses and assayed in 72 determinations on two
different kit lots and two different instruments. The mean, standard
deviation, and %CV was then determined for each sample. The LoQ was
calculated to be 2.1.
The data provided support the sponsor’s claim that the measuring range of this
assay is 2.1 to 300 ng/mL.

e. Analytical specificity:
A n interference study was evaluated according to CLSI EP17-A2
guideline. No significant interference was observed when samples were
spiked with the following potential interference substances. These testings
were based on CLSI-EP07-A2 guideline. Non-significant interference was
defined as difference from control (unspiked sample) within ±10%. Results
of the interference study are summarized in the table below.

A hook effect study was performed using 3 high renin concentration samples,
out-of-range (up to 609.7 pg/mL). Samples were serially diluted in renin-
stripped plasma and Liaison® Endocrinology Diluent. The neat sample and the
dilutions were tested in triplicates using one kit lot on one Analyzer. For each
sample the signal obtained were plotted versus the concentration and no hook
effect were observed with Renin concentration up to 609.7 pg/mL.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A study was performed to compare the results of the LIAISON® Direct
Renin test to CisBio Renin Assay (Predicate) using 173 renin samples based
on CLSI EP9-A guidelines. The range of results observed with the DiaSorin
LIAISON® Direct Renin test ranged 2.4 to 285 pg/ml. Passing Bablok
regression analysis and difference plots were applied to these samples,
yielding the following regression: Y = 1.02 X - 0.11, r2 = 0.9732. The 95%
confidence interval for the slope was 0.99 to 1.07, and the 95% confidence
interval for the intercept was -0.70 to 0.59 pg/mL.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
In order to determine the normal range of LIAISON® Direct Renin assay, 266
EDTA samples from 133 subjects, apparently healthy subjects’ ages 18 to 65
years were analyzed using the LIAISON® Direct Renin kit. Blood was collected
between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. with the subjects either in an upright or supine
position. Upright samples were collected with individuals sat down to have their
blood withdrawn and tested using the LIAISON® Direct Renin kit after standing
for 30 minutes; supine samples were collected after the individuals lay in supine
position for at least 30 minutes. The results are shown in the Table below.
