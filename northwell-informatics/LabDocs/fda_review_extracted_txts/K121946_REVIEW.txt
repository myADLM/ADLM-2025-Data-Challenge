L. Test Principle:
The enzyme immunoassay is a two step assay. The microtitre wells are coated with a
highly specific monoclonal antibody for Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin). During
the first incubation, holotranscobalamin in serum specifically binds to the antibody-
coated surface. In the second incubation, the murine anti-human transcobalamin
alkaline phosphatase conjugate binds to any captured holotranscobalamin. The wells
are then washed using the wash buffer to remove unbound components. The bound
holotranscobalamin is detected by incubation with the substrate pNPP. Addition of
the stop solution terminates the reaction, resulting in a colored end-product. The
concentration of holotranscobalamin in pmol/L is directly related to the color
generated and can be estimated by interpolation from a dose-response curve based on
the calibrators. All calibrators, controls, and patient samples are assayed in duplicate
and the mean results will be used to generate the calibration curve and obtain the final
patient results.

high real patient serum sample at approximately 156.0 pmol/L HoloTC
concentration and a low human serum based buffer at approximately 5.0
pmol/L were use to prepare a dilution series of a total of ten samples ranging
in concentration from 5.28 to 156.04 pmol/L. The samples were tested in
replicates of four with one lot of reagent by one operator. The linear
regression analysis of the data suggested a linear fit. The results are
summarized below:
Range tested Correlation Slope Intercept
(pmol/L) Coefficient (R2) (95% CI) (95% CI)
5.28 to 156.04 1.00 1.00 1.30
(0.98 to 1.02) (-0.42 to 3.01)
Based on the results, the measuring range of the Axis-Shield Active-B12
assay is claimed from 10.0 to 128.0 pmol/L. Samples read at concentrations
greater than 128.0 pmol/L should be reported out as >128.0 pmol/L.
A high dose hook effect was performed and showed no hook effect with HoloTC
concentration up to 2236 pmol/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
There is currently no international recognized reference method or reference
material. HoloTC calibrators are prepared gravimetrically from a stock
solution of recombinant HoloTC following an internal procedure. The purity
of the recombinant HoloTC stock solution is determined (i) by HPLC and (ii)
spectroscopically from the ratio between the protein component and the
cobalamin component.
Value assignment
HoloTC calibrators are value assigned against internal reference standards and
concentrations values are lot specific and may vary between lots.
HoloTC Controls are prepared from HoloTC calibrator stock solution and
HoloTC calibrator diluent, and assigned values with reference to the HoloTC
calibrators.
Stability
The Axis-Shield Active-B12 (Holotranscobalamin) EIA assay kit was
evaluated for shelf life and in-use storage stability. A shelf-life of 52 weeks
when stored at 2 to 8ºC was assigned to the Axis-Shield Active-B12
(Holotranscobalamin) EIA assay kit based on an accelerated stability study
performed at 25ºC. The real-time storage stability studies are on-going to
support the shelf-life. Based on the in-use kit storage stability studies, a kit
once opened can be reused on three occasions over a three month period. In
addition, the sponsor has provided suggestion on the handling and storage of

the kit in the labeling. Stability study protocols and acceptance criteria has
been reviewed and found to be adequate.
d. Detection limits:
Analytical detection limits studies were performed according to the CLSI
EP17-A guidelines.
For LoB estimation, two serum based buffer samples were tested by two
operators in replicates of 15 in two runs over two days using two reagent lots
(N=120 per reagent lot). The LoB was determined to be 4.9 pmol/L.
For LoD estimation, five patient samples at holotranscobalamin
concentrations between LoB and 4 x LoD were tested in replicates of six in
two runs over two days using two reagent lots (N=120 per reagent lot). LoD
was calculated using the formula: LoD = LoB + (1.653 x pooled SD). The
LoD was determined to be 8.1 pmol/L.
For LoQ estimation, the LoD study data from the five patient samples were
used to estimate LoQ. A precision plot was generated to determine the inter-
assay precision at the low end concentration range. LoQ is defined as the
concentration where the inter-assay precision is <20%CV. LoQ was
determined to be 8.3 pmol/L.
The claimed measuring range of the Axis-Shield Active-B12 assay is 10.0 to
128.0 pmol/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference study was performed following the CLSI EP7-A2 guidelines.
Serum samples at three HoloTC concentrations (approximately 30, 72 and 120
pmol/L) were spiked with potentially interfering substances at a range of
target concentrations and tested in replicates of five in the Axis-Shield Active-
B12 (HoloTC) assay. Non-significant interference is defined by a percent
difference of within or equal to ±10% between the control non-spiked sample
and the test samples spiked with interfering substances.

and haptocorrin was performed using the HoloTC assay. Apotranscobalamin
at 500 pmol/L concentration was added to an Active B-12 negative serum-
based buffer. Haptocorrin at 5000 pmol/L concentration was added to three
serum samples at approximately 35, 71 and 125 pmol/L HoloTC
concentrations. Parallel control samples were prepared in the respective base
matrices with no added apotranscobalamin and haptocorrin. The test and
control samples were assayed in replicates of ten using one lot of reagents,
calibrators and controls. The following vitamin B12 binding proteins did not
cross-react in the Axis-Shield Active-B12 (HoloTC) assay as defined by a
percent cross-reactivity of within or equal to ±10% from the corresponding
non-spiked control samples.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison study was performed following the CLSI EP9-A2
guidelines. 120 patient serum samples ranging in holotranscobalamin
concentration from 10.0 to 128.0 pmol/L were tested in duplicate over three
days using three lots of reagents by multiple operators. Only 111 sample
results were analyzed since nine samples measured >128.0 pmol/L either in
the predicate or the candidate assay. The mean of duplicate results were
analyzed by Passing & Bablok analysis to determine the slope, intercept, and
coefficient of regression respectively. The results are shown below:
No. of Observations 111
Correlation Coefficient (95% Cl) 0.93 (0.90 to 0.95)
Slope (95% Cl) 0.95 (0.89 to 1.01)
Intercept (95% Cl) 8.39 (5.73 to 11.77)
b. Matrix comparison:
Matrix comparison study was performed to evaluate the suitability of the
plastic serum separator tubes (SST) for use in the Axis-Shield Active-B12
assay. Thirty six fresh blood samples were collected in plastic serum tubes
(control) and the SST tubes and processed for serum following manufacturer’s
instructions. Each serum sample was tested in replicates of four by one

using the Axis-Shield Active-B12 (HoloTC) assay. The mean HoloTC
concentration was 72.0 pmol/L with a range from 15.0 to 147.0 pmol/L. The
central 95% of the population defined the expected range of 21.0 to 123.0pmol/L.
In the labeling the sponsor recommends that each laboratory establishes their own
expected reference range based upon its unique population characteristics
including geographical, patient, dietary and environmental factors.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
