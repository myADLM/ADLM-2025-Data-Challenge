L. Test Principle:
The LIAISON® FT4 assay’s method for quantitative determination of FT4 is based
on the Solid Phase Antigen Linked Technique (SPALT) principle. A T4-protein
conjugate is coated on the magnetic particles (solid phase), and a monoclonal anti-T4
antibody is linked to an isoluminol derivative (isoluminol-antibody conjugate).
During the incubation, FT4 competes with the T4-protein-conjugate for the binding
sites on the labeled antibody. After incubation, the unbound material is removed with
a wash cycle. Subsequently, the starter reagents are added and a flash
chemiluminescence reaction is thus induced. The light signal, and hence the amount
of isoluminolantibody conjugate, is measured by a photomultiplier as relative light
units (RLU) and is inversely proportional to the FT4 concentration present in
calibrators, patient samples or controls. All assay steps and incubations are
performed automatically by the LIAISON® Analyzer.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision performance of the DiaSorin LIAISON FT4 assay was
evaluated by a twenty day reproducibility/precision study performed at
DiaSorin Inc. and 1 external site according to CLSI EP05-A2 using a panel of
4 frozen serum samples that contained 2 samples each at FT4 concentrations
of medium (1.21 and 1.91 ng/dL) and high (5.67 and 5.84 ng/dL). All samples
were tested on one lot of reagent, in two replicates per run, 2 runs per day for
20 days for a total of 80 replicate results per sample. The LIAISON Control
Thyroid Level 1, 2 and 3 (Kit Control) were also tested in the study.
The 20 day results for a typical site are summarized below.

The sponsor performed an additional 5 day study at DiaSorin and 1 external
site to support the precision performance of this assay at FT4 concentrations
that approximate the medical decision points.. Samples were assayed once per
day in replicates of 12 for a total of 60 replicate results per sample.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor provided a linearity study with one run using one lot of reagents
with each sample tested in replicates of 4. Eleven diluted samples with FT4
concentrations evenly distributed were prepared by diluting a high FT4
sample. This yielded linearity samples with FT4 levels that spanned a range
from 0.12 to 7.7 ng/dL. The sponsor calculated linear regressions from mean
observed values versus expected values using an unweighted regression model
and observed maximum % difference from observed values versus linear fit of
10%.
The fitted linear model regression is:
Measured FT4 = 1.025 (Expected FT4) + 0.084, R = 0.998.
Based on this linearity study and the limits of detection study (below), the
sponsor claimed that the measuring range of this device is 0.29 – 7.7 ng/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Currently there is no reference method for the FT4 assay. The LIAISON FT4
assay kit calibrators are traceable to concentrations of internal primary reference
standards of a synthetic T4 antigen in T4-stripped human serum prepared by
symmetric dialysis.
Stability:
LIAISON FT4 assay kits are stable for two weeks, when stored either on
board at 12-19oC or at refrigerated conditions of 2-8oC. LIASON FT4 assay
kits are stable for at least 12 month (shelf life) when stored at 2-8oC. The
stability study protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
adequate.
Value assignment of the calibrators and controls:
The kit calibrators (level 1 and 2) are manufactured by diluting a stock
solution of T4 with a human serum based matrix. The kit calibrators are
tested with a specific reagent lot against the master standards (10 points) to
assess the FT4 concentration. The target ranges of the calibrators are:
Calibrator 1 is between 0.45 - 0.55 ng/dL
Calibrator 2 is between 5.0 - 7.0 ng/dL.
Controls for FT4:
The controls (level 1 and 2 and 3) are prepared from pooled human serum
with added constituents of human serum, pure chemicals and therapeutic
drugs. The controls are tested on 3 LIAISON analyzers, using two reagent
lots for a minimum of 3 days to yield a minimum of 60 valid test results. FT4
mean values and standard deviations are calculated from the results. The
target ranges are established using the mean values ± 3SD. The target values
6

--- Page 7 ---
of the controls are:
Control 1 is targeted to 1 ng/dL
Control 2 is targeted to 3 ng/dL
Control 3 is targeted to 6 ng/dL.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor provided a detection limits study to determine the LoB, LoD, and
LoQ for the FT4 assay.
LoB Test Protocol
One blank sample was tested on 2 LIAISON® Analyzers with 2 reagent lots
and 2 technicians over 4 runs (three replicates/sample/run) yielding 60 results.
LoD Test Protocol
Four samples in the range of the LoB to 4 times the LoB were tested on 2
LIAISON® Analyzers with 2 reagent lots and 2 technicians over 4 runs (three
replicates/ sample/run) yielding a minimum of 192 results.
LoQ Test protocol
Eight samples with FT4 concentrations ranging from the LoB to 4XLoB were
tested using two analyzers by two technicians using 3 reagent lots over several
days generating 40 results per sample. LoQ was defined as inter-assay
precision of < 20% CV. The sponsor claimed the following detection limits:
LoB = 0.06 ng/dL
LoD = 0.13 ng/dL
LoQ = 0.29 ng/dL.
The Liaison FT4 assay has a measuring range of 0.29 to 7.7 ng/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
i. Interference from endogenous substances.
Interference testing was performed to determine whether the presence of
endogenous substances such as hemoglobin, triglycerides, rheumatoid factor,
conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin may interfere with assay results. Two
human serum samples were used with FT4 concentrations of 1.0-1.3 ng/dL
and 2.5 – 3.4 ng/dL. Each sample level was spiked with a single high
concentration of interferent. The spiked results were used to calculate the %
recovery (measured concentration compared to FT4 concentration with zero
interferent). Non-significant interference is defined as within ±10% recovery
for the tested analyte concentrations when compared against the non-spiked
sample. The non-significant interference substances with the highest
7

--- Page 8 ---
concentration tested are summarized in the table below.
Substance Highest Tested Concentration
Hemoglobin 1000 mg/dL
Triglycerides 3000 mg/dL
Bilirubin (conj) 20 mg/dL
Bilirubin (unconj) 20 mg/dL
Rheumatoid Factor 54 IU/mL
Albumin 6 g/dL
ii. Interference from cross-reactive substances.
The sponsor assessed the following substances for cross-reactivity according
to their internal protocol: D-T4, 3-iodo-L-Tyrosine, 3,5-diiodo-L-Tyrosine,
and 3,3’,5,5’-tetra-iodothyroacetic acid by triplicate measurement of spiked
samples in T4-free zero sample and evaluating displacement versus a T4-
spiked sample. Results are summarized in the table below.

D-T4 150 ng/dL 100 %
3-iodo-L-tyrosine 1400 ng/dL 0%
3,5-diiodo-L-tyrosine 1500 ng/dL 0%
3,3′,5,5′-tetra-iodothyroacetic acid 11 ng/dL 0%
iii. Interference from common drugs
Ten human serum samples divided into two aliquots were used with FT4
concentrations ranging from 0.878 to 1.75 ng/dL. One aliquot was not spiked
with any drugs and was used as the reference sample. The remaining samples
were spiked with the respective amount of drug. Then the concentration of
FT4 was determined using two kit lots compared to the reference aliquot. FT4
recovery was within ±10% for the tested analyte concentrations. Non-
significant interference is defined as within ±10% recovery for the tested
analyte concentrations when compared against the reference sample. Non-
significant interference was found at therapeutic concentration of any of the
following drugs: salicylic acid, acetylsalicylic acid, phenylbutazone,
diphenylhydantoin, amiodarone, 8-anilino-1-napthalene sulfonic acid
ammonium salt, furosemide, iopanic acid, and DL-propranolol.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed with 212 human serum samples
with concentrations ranging from 0.29 – 6.99 ng/dL tested by the DiaSorin
FT4 assay (expressed as ng/dL) and the predicate device. Sixteen samples
were engineered by spiking in human FT4 to achieve hard-to-find high FT4
concentrations. Ten samples were diluted to obtain samples with low FT4
concentrations. Eleven samples with FT4 concentrations outside the
measuring range were excluded from data analysis. Samples were tested in
duplicate on the candidate device and the first replicate result was analyzed by
linear regression.
Data were analyzed by least squares linear regression with 95% CI indicated
in parentheses:
Slope = 1.07 (1.03 to 1.09), intercept = - 0.12 (-0.17 to -0.08), r = 0.9633
