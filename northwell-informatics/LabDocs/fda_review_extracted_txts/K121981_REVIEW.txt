L. Test Principle:
The ADVIA Centaur Intact PTH assay is a two-site sandwich immunoassay using direct
chemiluminometric technology. PTH in the sample reacts with the first antibody which is a
polyclonal goat anti-human PTH (N-terminal 1-34) antibody labeled with acridinium ester. This
complex is then captured by the solid phase (a second antibody which is a biotinylated
polyclonal goat anti-human PTH (39-84 region) antibody that is preformed to streptavidin coated
paramagnetic latex particles). Unbound materials are then removed by washing. Acid Reagent
and Base Reagent are then added to initiate the chemiluminescent reaction. A direct relationship
exists between the amount of PTH present in the patient sample and the amount of relative light
units (RLUs) detected by the system.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated following CLSI guideline EP5-A2. Two replicates of each of
11samples, to include 6 EDTA plasma pools from patients, 2 calibrators and 3 levels
of commercial control materials, were assayed in duplicate over the course of 20
days, on 2 instruments using 2 lots of reagent, two runs per day, for a total of 40 runs
and 80 replicates. A representative lot is summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Fourteen (14) levels of linearity samples spanning the assay range were prepared by
dilutions of a high EDTA plasma pool (~2200 pg/ml) with iPTH diluent (buffered
goat serum with no analyte). The sample range tested was 5.5 pg/mL-2173.4 pg/mL.
Linearity was evaluated following CLSI guideline EP6-A. The sponsor chose to
perform 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order polynomial regression analysis on each of the dilution
series. The first order generates the best linear fit. The linear regression is
Y=1.008x-2.500, R=0.997
Based on linearity results, the sponsor claims that the assay is linear across the
reportable range (5.5-1900 pg/mL)
Hook Effect Study
A high dose hook effect study was performed by preparing two high activity iPTH
samples and spiking EDTA plasma samples with human PTH. The concentration
range was 195-200,000 pg/mL (195, 391, 781, 1563, 3125, 6250, 12500, 25000,
50000, 100000, 200000). A serial two fold dilution was performed using Multi-
diluent 11 (buffered goat serum). The neat (undiluted) samples and the diluted
samples were assayed on the ADVIA Centaur XP system using two reagent lots.
Sponsor states that no hook effect was seen in samples with a concentration up to
200,000 pg/mL iPTH.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The ADVIA Centaur Intact PTH assay standardization is maintained with internal
standards manufactured using purified human iPTH (1-84); values have been
assigned to correlate to a commercially available iPTH assay.
Calibrators and controls were previously cleared in k020217
On-board stability for the ADVIA Centaur Intact PTH assay was established by real
time studies on the ADVIA Centaur XP system. The stability study protocol and the
acceptance criteria have been found acceptable. The on board stability of the reagent
is 28 days with a calibration interval of 14 days. The ADVIA Centaur Intact PTH
assay reagent is stable until the date printed on the label when stored at 2-8˚C.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
were determined following guideline EP17-A.

--- Page 6 ---
For LoB determination, 5 replicates of the assay specific diluent, 2 runs per day for
five days using 2 ADVIA Centaur XP systems with two reagent lots of ADVIA
Centaur iPTH reagents – giving 100 determinations in total.
For LoD determination, 7 low analyte sample pools were each measured in 5
replicates per run, 2 runs per day for 5 days using 2 lots of ADVIA Centaur iPTH
reagent for a total of 200 replicates using two ADVIA Centaur XP systems.
For LoQ determination, 7 low analyte sample pools were each measured in 5
replicates per run, 2 runs per day for 5 days using 2 lots of ADVIA Centaur iPTH
reagents-giving 200 determinations. The seven low analyte samples were the same
used for the LoD study. The level of imprecision used to accept LoQ was less than
20%.
Result Summary
Based on the study results, the following detection limit claims were made:
LoB LoD LoQ
1.93 pg/mL 3.44 pg/mL 5.55 pg/mL
The measuring range of the assay is 5.5 – 1900 pg/mL
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference
The sponsor evaluated the effect of the interfering substances using three patient
serum pools.. Each potential interfering substance was spiked into each of the three
serum pools. A control sample was prepared by spiking with the appropriate diluent
at the same volume as the interfering substance stock. Interference was defined by the
sponsor as ≤ 10% difference from the control sample.
Highest Concentration Tested that
showed no interference
Hemoglobin (red blood cell hemolysate) 500 mg/dL
Triglycerides (Intralipid) 3,000 mg/dL
Bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated) 40 mg/dL
Biotin 1000 ng/mL
Cross Reactivity
The sponsor evaluated cross-reactivity by using a normal EDTA plasma sample (~40
pg/mL) and the assay specific Multi diluent 11 (control sample). The potential cross
reactants were spiked into each matrix and serially diluted with their respective
controls that had not been spiked with the cross reactant. The % cross-reactivity was

The sponsor has included a limitation in their labeling which states “The Advia Centaur
iPTH assay will detect non-Intact PTH (1-84) such as PTH fragment (7-84). PTH
fragment (7-84) may cause falsely elevated Intact PTH results in patients with abnormal
renal function because these patients may have various concentrations of PTH fragment
(7-84) in their blood. In patients with abnormal renal function, please interpret the Intact
PTH result with caution and do not make patient management decisions on the iPTH
result alone. A study of characterized PTH fragments is provided in Lopez et al (Selected
Reaction Monitoring-Mass Spectrometric Immunoassay Responsive to Parathyroid
Hormone and Related Variants)Clin Chem 2010;56:281-290.
