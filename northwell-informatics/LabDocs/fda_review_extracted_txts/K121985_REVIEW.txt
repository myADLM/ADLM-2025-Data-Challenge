2. Indication(s) for use:
The ARCHITECT Total Bilirubin assay is used for the quantitation of total
bilirubin in human serum or plasma on the ARCHITECT c8000 system.
Measurement of total bilirubin, an organic compound formed during the normal
and abnormal destruction of red blood cells, is used in the diagnosis and treatment
of liver, hemolytic hematological and metabolic disorders, including hepatitis and
gall bladder block.
A bilirubin (total and unbound) in the neonate test system is a device intended to
measure the levels of bilirubin (total and unbound) in the blood (serum) of
newborn infants to aid in indicating the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy
(kernicterus).
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Abbott ARCHITECT c8000
I. Device Description:
The total bilirubin reagent kit is packaged as two liquid, ready-to-use reagents, R1
and R2. The following reactive ingredients are presented in the following table:

L. Test Principle:
The total bilirubin assay is a quantitative colorimetric measurement of total bilirubin
in human (adult and neonates) serum or plasma. Total (conjugated and unconjugated)
bilirubin couples with the diazo reagent in the presence of a surfactant to form
azobilirubin. The increase in absorbance at 548 nm due to azobilirubin is directly
proportional to the total bilirubin concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was performed for 20 days using one lot of reagent, one lot of
calibrators, and one lot of controls following guidance outlined in CLSI EP5-
A2. All testing was performed on the ARCHITECT c8000. Four control
levels (level 1, level 2, level 3, and level 4) were tested in replicates of two, in
two runs per day for 20 days (N=80). Results are summarized in the
following table:

An additional 5 day precision study was performed using patient samples,
with one lot of reagent, one lot of calibrators, and one lot of controls. All
testing was preformed on the Architect c8000. Three levels of serum
concentrations were tested in replicates of five for five days (N=50). Results
are summarized in the following table:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed following guidance from CLSI EP6-A. Nine
samples were prepared by diluting a high patient sample with a low patient
sample to obtain concentrations that span the entire claimed measuring range.
Each serum sample was tested in replicates of four using one lot of reagent on
the ARCHITECT c8000 instrument. The concentrations of samples tested
spanned the claimed measuring range 0.1 to 25 mg/dL. Three linearity studies
were conducted with the following components of total bilirubin: 75%
Conjugated and 25% Unconjugated, 50% Conjugated and 50% Unconjugated,
25% Conjugated and 75% Unconjugated. The observed values were plotted
against the expected values and an appropriate line fitted by standard linear
regression. The following is a representative summary of results from these
studies:
Serum
Correlation (r) 1.00
Slope 0.98
Intercept 0.06
The linearity data support the sponsor’s claim that the measuring range for
serum is 0.1 - 25 mg/dL
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators were previously cleared- See k060574 for traceability, stability,
and expected value information.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor conducted a Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) study following the CLSI EP-17A guideline. The
LoB was determined using three ARCHITECT instruments (N=60 per
instrument) using three blank samples. This study was conducted over one
day. LoD and LoQ study was performed on two ARCHITECT c8000
Systems in 5 runs over 3 days with several low samples. LoQ is defined as

These detection limit studies support the claimed measuring range 0.1 – 25
mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
A study of common interferents was conducted. Solutions of human serum
albumin were spiked with two levels of bilirubin (a high normal total bilirubin
and an abnormal high total bilirubin). These two solutions were spiked with
varying levels of interferent. The spiked samples were tested in seven
replicates and these results were compared to seven replicates of a reference
sample (without spiked interferent). Interference was evaluated at two
medical decision points for total bilirubin. The percent recovery was
determined by dividing the mean result of replicates for each interferent level
by the mean result of the replicates for the reference sample. The sponsor’s
acceptance criteria was set at ± 10% or ± 0.3 mg/dL difference between the
interferent results and the reference results, whichever is greater (The
acceptance criteria of ≤ 10% or ± 0.3 mg/dL is applied using the ≤10% criteria
first. If the percentage is > 10%, the observed vs. target values must be within
0.3mg/dL). The following is a summary of results:
Intralipid at concentrations > 750 mg/dL have been shown to interfere with
the measurement of Total Bilirubin at the target concentration of 1.2744
mg/dL. Indican concentrations > 0.175 mmol/L have been shown to interfere
with Total Bilirubin target concentrations at 1.3241 mg/dL. Hemoglobin
tested up to 2000 mg/dL do not interfere with the total bilirubin assay.
Other interferences from medications or endogenous substances may affect
results and the sponsor refers user to the literature for more information in the
labeling.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was conducted using 138 adult serum samples
ranging from 0.11 to 23.96 mg/dL. All samples were tested on the Architect
c8000 System and the candidate device was compared against the predicate
device. The following table provides a summary of the regression analysis:
Adult Sample comparison:
Sample type N Range (mg/dL) Slope Intercept Correlation
Coefficient
Serum 138 0.11 – 23.96 0.98 0.07 0.9991
In addition, 54 neonate serum samples ranging from 0.94 to 19.05 mg/dL
were compared using the candidate device evaluated on the Architect c8000
System against another FDA cleared device (Roche total bilirubin on Hitachi
717). The following table provides a summary of the regression analysis:
Neonatal Sample comparison:
Sample type N Range (mg/dL) Slope Intercept Correlation
Coefficient
Serum 54 0.94 – 19.05 0.99 0.32 0.9967
b. Matrix comparison:
Thirty subjects’ total bilirubin results using glass serum tube (control) were
compared to plastic K2 EDTA, Lithium heparin with and without a gel barrer,
and sodium heparin tubes. All the results generated from the plastic tubes
(SST tube, lithium heparin, sodium heparin, and plasma lithium heparin with
gel separator) had less than 10% differences when compared to the glass tube
(control). Total bilirubin concentrations tested range from 0.1 to 25 mg/dL.
