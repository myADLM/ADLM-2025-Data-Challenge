L. Test Principle:
The LOCI Vitamin B12 method is a homogeneous, competitive chemiluminescent
immunoassay based on LOCI technology. LOCI reagents include two synthetic bead
reagents and biotinylated intrinsic factor (IF). The first bead reagent (Chemibead) is coated
with a B12 derivative and contains a chemiluminescent dye. The second bead reagent
(Sensibead) is coated with streptavidin and contains photosensitive dye. The patient sample
is pretreated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and dithioerythritol (DTE) to release the serum
B12 from its carrier proteins. Potassium cyanide (KCN) is added to convert all the forms of
B12 into a single, cyanocobalamin form, and dicyanocobinamide is added to keep the B12
from rebinding with the carrier proteins. After the sample pretreatment, the biotinylated IF
and chemibead reagents are added sequentially to the reaction vessel. Vitamin B12 from the
sample competes with the B12-chemibead for a limited amount of biotinylated IF. Sensibead
reagent is then added and binds to the biotin to form bead pair immunocomplexes.
Illumination of the complex at 680 nm generates singlet oxygen from the Sensibeads which
diffuses to the Chemibeads triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is
measured at 612 nm and is an inverse function of the concentration of vitamin B12 in the
sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision study was designed based on the CLSI document EP5-A2. Bio-Rad
Liquichek Control materials, patient serum and lithium heparin plasma pools were
used for the precision study. One lot of reagent and one instrument was used (Vista
1500 analyzer). For each sample, a single test from two independent cups was
analyzed twice per day for 20 days. The within-run and within-lab standard
deviations were calculated by the analysis of variance method.
The results are summarized below.

pools covering the intended assay range. All 9 pools were measured 5 times on a
single instrument (Vista 1500 analyzer). Sample ranges tested were between 22 to
2109 pg/mL. The linear regression was determined by plotting the observed values
against the expected values and generated the following equation: y= 0.99x + 0.22.
A summary of the linearity results are listed in the table below.

The linearity study supports the sponsor’s claim that the B12 assay has a reportable
range of 60 to 2000 pg/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The Dimension Vista B12 calibrators are traceable to USP grade
vitamin B12 by gravimetric method. Ferritin is traceable to the WHO Standard for
ferritin, 3rd IS 94/572. Folate is traceable to the US Pharmacopeia Grade folic acid.
Value assignment:
Vitamin B12: The anchor pool consists of 5 levels of VB12 in human serum based
material. The assigned value of the anchor pool is based on the Roche Elecsys. To
provide stability, a large reserve of anchor pool is stored frozen at 70 ±20 ˚C.
Aliquots of the anchor pool are used to produce the master pools. Values are
assigned to each lot of calibrator from the master pool using the Dimension Vista
System. The master pool is a frozen liquid, five-level material. The master pool has
the same composition as the calibrator which is held in reserve. The value
assignment is derived from 9 runs (n=5 replicates) on 3 instruments using 3 reagents
lots.
Folate: The anchor pool consists of 6 levels of Folate in human serum base material.
The assigned value of the anchor pool is based on the ADVIA Centaur folate method
at 3 external sites. To provide stability, a large reserve of anchor pool is stored frozen
at -70 ±20 ˚C. Aliquots of the anchor pool are used to produce the master pools.
Values are assigned to each lot of calibrator from the master pool using the
Dimension Vista System. The master pool is a frozen liquid, five-level material. The

master pool has the same composition as the calibrator which is held in reserve. The
value assignment is derived from 9 runs (n=5 replicates) on 3 instruments using 3
reagents lots.
Ferritin: The anchor pool is based on WHO Standard for Ferritin 3rd IS 94/572.
Nine levels of ferritin are gravimetrically prepared. To provide stability, a large
reserve of anchor pool is stored frozen at -70 ±20 ˚C. Aliquots of the anchor pool
are used to produce the master pools. Values are assigned to each lot of calibrator
from the master pool using the Dimension Vista System. The master pool is a
frozen liquid, five-level material. The master pool has the same composition as the
calibrator which is held in reserve. The value assignment is derived from 9 runs
(n=5 replicates) on 3 instruments using 3 reagents lots.
Stability of calibrators (folate, ferritin, and vitamin B12): Real–time stability
protocols and acceptance criteria for shelf-life and in-use (open vial) stability were
reviewed and found to be acceptable. Unopened thawed calibrator material is stable
for 30 days at 2-8 ˚C. Once the stopper of the vial is punctured, assigned values are
stable for 7 days when stored aboard the instrument. Once the cap is removed,
assigned values are stable for 30 days when recapped immediately and stored at 2-8
˚C.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) for the VB12 method was
determined based on the CLSI document EP17-A. Blank samples (N=5) were
prepared using five lots of HEPES buffer to determine the LoB. Low analyte samples
(N=5) were serum samples with low endogenous B12 ranging from 32 to 62 pg/mL
to determine the LoD. Each sample was tested in duplicate, using two lots of
reagents once a day over 3 days for a total of 12 results per sample (total N=60).
The limit of quantification (LoQ) is defined as the lowest analyte concentration that
can be reproducibly measured with a total CV of ≤20%. Seven serum pools with low
endogenous B12 levels ranging from 40 to 180 pg/mLwere analyzed in duplicate,
once a day for twenty days for a total of 40 results per sample.
The results are summarized in the below table.
LoB LoD LoQ
Serum 18.0 pg/mL 28.0 pg/mL 52 pg/mL
The B12 assay has a measuring range of 60- 2000 pg/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference: Interference testing was performed according to CLSI EP7-A2
guideline to determine the effect of various endogenous and exogenous substances on
the Dimension Vista VB12 assay. For all interferents, except rheumatoid factors
(RF), the percent bias was determined by testing a control sample without the
interferent and comparing it to the value obtained from a test sample to which the
7

[Table 1 on page 7]
	LoB	LoD	LoQ
Serum	18.0 pg/mL	28.0 pg/mL	52 pg/mL

--- Page 8 ---
potential interferent had been added. For RF interference, a human serum sample
with a RF level of 500 IU/mL and a normal human serum sample were spiked with
the same level of vitamin B12. Interferents were tested at two levels of vitamin B12,
approximately 200 pg/mL and 1000pg/mL. For each spiked sample, the % recovery
was determined. The acceptance criteria of ≤ 10% relative deviation from the control
were met for all interferents tested except Dextran 40 and Hemoglobin. Dextran 40
and Hemoglobin with a >10% bias were repeated at lower concentrations to
determine a level where the bias became less than 10%. The sponsor states in the
Instructions for Use labeling that Dextran 40 at 6 g/dL decreases VB12 by -11.9% at
200 pg/dL and that hemoglobin at 500 mg/dL increases VB12 results by 19.8% at 200
pg/dL.
The hemolysis, icterus, and lipemia (HIL) limits where the interference bias does not
exceed 10% were determined to be as follows:
· Bilirubin ≤ 60 mg/dL
· Hemoglobin ≤ 300 mg/dL
· Triglycerides ≤ 3000 mg/dL
The sponsor states in the Instructions for Use labeling to avoid using hemolyzed
samples.
Cross reactivity: Cross reactivity of cobinamide with the Dimension Vista VB12
antibody was challenged at a concentration of 200 ng/mL. Cobinamide was added to
a serum pool with a vitamin B12 level of 200 pg/mL. The cross-reactivity was
determined by testing a control sample (n=5) without cobinamide and comparing it to
the value obtained from a test sample (n=5) to which cobinamide (200 ng/mL) had
been added. The percent cross-reactivity was calculated and the sponsor concluded
that there is no cross-reactivity (≤ 1%) with cobinamide.
Intrinsic Factor Blocking Antibody (IFBA) interference:
An IFBA interference study was performed to assess the interference effects of IFBA
on VB12 measurements. Patient samples with both positive and negative IFBA were
assayed by both the candidate and the predicate device (Roche Elecsys). The VB12
concentration of the samples ranged from 60-2000 pg/mL. The sponsor concludes that
test performed demonstrates that the Dimension Vista Vitamin B12 assay effectively
mitigates the interference of IFBA. Results from the candidate device (Y) were plot
against the predicate device (X) and a linear regression analysis was performed. The
table below summarizes the IFBA interference study results:

The sponsor included the following limitation in their labeling:
Intrinsic blocking antibodies are present in approximately half of pernicious anemia
patients. There is a low frequency possibility that these antibodies may not be
completely inactivated during the reaction pretreatment step. If test results are in
conflict with the clinical diagnosis, the sample can be tested for intrinsic factor
blocking antibodies.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The Dimension Vista VB12 assay was compared to the Vitamin B12 assay on the
Roche Elecsys System by evaluating one hundred sixty-two native serum samples
across the claimed measuring range. The samples ranged from 69 to 1829 pg/mL on
the Roche Elecsys, and 68 to 1963 pg/mL on the Dimension Vista. The sample set
included 32 samples with known Intrinsic Factor Binding Antibody (IFBA) titers
ranging from 7 to 133.85 U/mL.
Passing-Bablok regression analysis of the results yielded the following:
Regression Bias 95% CI
Constant (Y-intercept) -7.64 -17 to -0.48
Proportional (X-slope) 0.985 0.965 to 1.004
The correlation coefficient for this data set (R) is 0.993
b. Matrix comparison:
Serum, EDTA plasma, lithium heparin plasma and sodium heparin plasma are the
recommended specimen types for the Dimension Vista VB12 assay. Seventy-one
matched sets of serum, lithium heparin, sodium heparin, and EDTA plasma
freshly drawn from healthy donors were tested on the Dimension Vista VB12
assay. Sixty-four sets were native samples with serum B12 levels ranging from
125 to 1174 pg/mL. Seven sets were spiked with B12 in equal amounts to all
sample types to cover ranges from 1116 to 1821 pg/mL. All samples were tested
(n=2) with the VB12 assay on the Dimension Vista 1500 System. The first
replicate of the results were used for analyzing the linear regression analysis.
Ordinary least squares linear regression was used to fit the mean B12 results of each
