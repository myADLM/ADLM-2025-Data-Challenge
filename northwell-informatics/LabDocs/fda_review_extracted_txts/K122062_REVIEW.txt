I. Device Description:
The ATV assay is a nucleic acid amplification test intended for the in vitro qualitative
detection of ribosomal RNA from T. vaginalis in clinician collected vaginal swabs,
endocervical swabs and ThinPrep Pap Test specimens collected in Cytyc Preservcyt solution.
The assay may be used to test specimens from symptomatic and asymptomatic women to aid
in the diagnosis of trichomoniasis using the PANTHER System automated analyzer. This
ATV Assay is similar to the ATV Assay originally cleared (ref: K102911) for use on the
TIGRIS System, except for the formulation of the TCR. The TCR is a HEPES-buffered
solution containing lithium salts and derivatized magnetic beads. The ATV Assay uses
Target Capture (TC), Transcription Mediated Amplification (TMA), and Hybridization
Protection Assay (HPA) technologies to qualitatively detect ribosomal RNA (rRNA) from
Trichomonas vaginalis.

L. Test Principle:
The APTIMA Trichomonas vaginalis Assay involves the technologies of target capture,
transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), and hybridization protection assay (HPA).
Specimens are collected and transferred into their respective specimen transport tubes. The
transport solution in these tubes releases the rRNA target and protects it from degradation
during storage. When the APTIMA Trichomonas vaginalis Assay is performed in the
laboratory, the target rRNA is isolated from the specimens by the use of a specific capture

oligomer and magnetic microparticles in a method called target capture. The capture
oligomer contains a sequence complementary to a specific region of the target molecule as
well as a string of deoxyadenosine residues. During the hybridization step, the sequence-
specific region of the capture oligomer binds to a specific region of the target molecule. The
capture oligomer:target complex is then captured out of solution by decreasing the
temperature of the reaction to room temperature. This temperature reduction allows
hybridization to occur between the deoxyadenosine region on the capture oligomer and the
poly-deoxythymidine molecules that are covalently attached to the magnetic particles. The
microparticles, including the captured target molecule bound to them, are pulled to the side of
the reaction vessel using magnets and the supernatant is aspirated. The particles are washed
to remove residual specimen matrix that may contain amplification inhibitors. After the target
capture steps are completed, the specimens are ready for amplification.
Target amplification assays are based on the ability of complementary oligonucleotide
primers to specifically anneal and allow enzymatic amplification of the target nucleic acid
strands. The GEN-PROBE TMA reaction amplifies a specific region of the small ribosomal
subunit from T. vaginalis via DNA and RNA intermediates and generates RNA amplicon
molecules. Detection of the rRNA amplification product sequences is achieved using nucleic
acid hybridization (HPA). A single-stranded chemiluminescent DNA probe, which is
complementary to a region of the target amplicon, is labeled with an acridinium ester
molecule. The labeled DNA probe combines with amplicon to form stable RNA:DNA
hybrids. The Selection Reagent differentiates hybridized from unhybridized probe,
eliminating the generation of signal from unhybridized probe. During the detection step, light
emitted from the labeled RNA:DNA hybrids is measured as photon signals in a luminometer
and are reported as Relative Light Units (RLU).
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Reproducibility
Reproducibility of the APTIMA Trichomonas vaginalis Assay was evaluated on the
PANTHER System at two external US laboratories and at Gen-Probe.
Reproducibility panel members were created by using pooled TV-negative
PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap specimens and specimen transport medium (STM).
The positive panel members were created by spiking the PreservCyt Solution liquid
Pap matrix with the appropriate amount of T. vaginalis lysate. Final T. vaginalis
concentrations were .003 TV/mL for the high negative panel, .02 TV/mL for the
moderate positive panel member (expected positivity: 100%), and 1.00 TV/mL for
the high positive panel member (expected positivity: 100%). The fourth panel
member contained TV-negative PreservCyt specimen matrix and STM only.
Testing was performed using two lots of assay reagents and a total of six operators
(two at each site). At each site, testing was performed over at least 6 days. Two
operators performed testing at each site with only one operator performing testing
5

--- Page 6 ---
each day. At each site, each operator performed two runs per day, each run using a
different lot of reagents. Each run included three replicates of each panel member.
The following table presents, for each panel member, RLU data in terms of mean,
standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) between sites, between
operators, between lots, between runs, within runs, and overall (Total). Percent
agreement with expected results is also shown. Samples with valid results were
included in the analyses. In summary, the ATV assay on the PANTHER
demonstrated high agreement with the expected results in the negative panel
member and panel members containing target levels at or above the assay LoD. The
results indicate reproducible performance within and across all three sites for all
panel members tested when compared to the expected outcome.

decimal point truncated.
Variability from some factors may have been numerically negative. This occurred if the variability due to those
factors was very small. In these cases, SD and CV are shown as 0.
b. Precision
The precision of the ATV Assay on PANTHER was evaluated in-house by multiple
operators who performed multiple runs over multiple days with three different
reagent lots on three different PANTHER Systems. A 4-member reproducibility
panel was prepared in PreservCyt (ThinPrep) liquid cytology specimen-STM matrix.
Prior to sample preparation, PreservCyt sample pools were screened with the ATV
Assay to confirm that T. vaginalis was not present. The pools were then spiked with
T. vaginalis lysate to produce high negative (expected positivity: >0% and <100%),
moderate positive (expected positivity: 100%) and high positive (expected
positivity: 100%) panel members. Unspiked PreservCyt pools served as the negative
panel members. Each panel member was tested in triplicate by three operators, in
6

--- Page 7 ---
two runs per day using three reagent lots on three instruments. Testing was
performed over 13 days with 162 replicates per panel member tested.
The negative and positive panel members yielded ≥99% agreement with the
expected results as shown by the following chart. The results from this study
demonstrate that the ATV Assay can be performed reproducibly on the PANTHER
System.

c. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The ATV Assay (PANTHER System) test results are automatically interpreted by the
PANTHER System APTIMA Trichomonas vaginalis software. A test result may be
negative, positive or invalid as determined by the total Relative Light Units (RLU) in
the detection step. A test result may be invalid due to RLU values outside the normal
expected ranges. Initial invalid results should be retested.
Test Interpretation Total RLU (x 1000)
Negative 0* to <100
Positive 100 to <2400
Invalid 0* or >/= 2400
*If the RLU measured on the PANTHER System is between 0 and 999, a result of “0” is reported in the
“Total RLU (000s)” column in the run report. Measured RLU values less than 690 are reported as invalid.
RLU values between 690 and 999 are reported as valid
d. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Specimen Stability Studies: Data to support the recommended shipping and storage
conditions for vaginal swab and PreservCyt liquid Pap specimens was generated with
negative clinical specimens spiked with T. vaginalis. For vaginal swab specimens
(100% of replicates) studies demonstrated stability of samples for storage up to 60
days at 30ºC followed by storage up to two years at -20ºC. For PreservCyt
specimens (>98%), studies demonstrated stability of samples up to 30 days stored at
30C followed by storage up to 2 years frozen at -20ºC. For either sample type, there
was no statistical difference in RLU values from initial testing at T to various time

and temperatures.
Quality Control Results and Acceptability: The APTIMA Negative Control for
Trichomonas and APTIMA Positive Control for Trichomonas act as controls for the
target capture, amplification and detection steps of the assay. The Positive Control
contains non-infectious Trichomonas vaginalis rRNA.
The ATV Assay Controls must produce the following test results:

Negative Control 0* and <20 Negative
Positive Control >/=500 and < 2400 Positive

the
“Total RLU (000s)” column in the run report. Measured RLU values less than 690 are reported as
invalid. RLU values between 690 and 999 are reported as valid.
e. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LOD) for the APTIMA ATV Assay on PANTHER was
determined by testing quantified (TV/mL) strains of T. vaginalis lysates diluted into
pooled TV-negative residual PreservCyt liquid Pap specimen and swab matrices.
Sensitivity panels were prepared with two strains of T. vaginalis (one Metronidazole-
susceptible strain and one Metronidazole-resistant strain).
For each strain and dilution, twenty replicates of each panel member were tested with
each of three reagent lots on different PANTHER instruments over 3 days for a total
of 60 replicates. The LOD was defined as the lowest TV concentration at which >
95% of replicates tested positive.
Greater than 97% positivity for both strains was observed at a concentration of 0.003
TV/mL for swab samples and 100% positivity was observed for both strains at 0.01
TV/mL for PreservCyt specimens. The LOD results are summarized in the table
below.

f. Analytical specificity:
Analytical Specificity of the ATV Assay on the PANTHER System was evaluated by
testing 42 microorganisms of the genitourinary tract, opportunistic organisms, and
closely related organisms. Organisms tested included bacteria, fungi, yeast, and
viruses (see table below).
Panels were prepared in Specimen Transport Media (STM, representative of vaginal
and endocervical samples) and PreservCyt specimens diluted 1:2.9 in STM. Panel
members were prepared by spiking each of the potentially interfering microorganisms
in both sample matrices at > 106 CFU/mL for bacteria and parasites and > 105
TCID /mL for viruses. Controls for each sample matrix, with and without TV were
50
also prepared.
Testing of 25 replicates of each isolate was conducted in both matrices. No false
positive results were observed with any of the organisms tested. Samples with P.
hominis and T. tenax yielded slightly elevated RLUs although these results were
negative and far below the assay cut-off. In summary, no cross-reactivity or
significant effect on ATV Assay specificity was observed with any of the organisms
tested.

Microorganisms tested for Potential Cross Reactivity
The ATV assay on PANTHER was also evaluated in STM and PreservCyt
matrices by testing the organisms listed in the table above in TV-positive samples.
Samples containing each potentially interfering organism were spiked with TV
lysate at 0.01 TV/mL with the exception of Trichomonas tenax and
Pentatrichomonas hominis which were spiked at 2.5 TV/mL. Twenty-five replicates
were tested. All results were positive as expected with the exception of samples
containing Trichomonas tenax and Pentatrichomonas hominis, two organisms
closely related to T. vaginalis. For these two organisms, false negative results were
observed when testing at concentrations of 106 CFU/mL. Further testing was performed
at lower concentrations of the two organisms and TV positivity was recovered at
300,000 CFU/mL. The following limitation is included in the package insert regarding
the potential interference of TV detection in the presence of T. tenax or P. hominis:
"A negative result does not preclude a possible infection because the presence of
Trichomonas tenax or Pentatrichomonas hominis in a specimen may affect the
ability to detect T. vaginalis rRNA."
In summary, no significant interference was observed for detection of TV in the
presence of high concentrations of the potentially interfering organisms tested with the
exception of the closely related P. hominis and T. tenax organisms, both of which are
rarely found in the genitourinary tract.

g. Interference
The effect of endogenous and exogenous substances that may be present in urogenital
specimens on the sensitivity and specificity of the APTIMA Trichomonas vaginalis
(ATV) Assay on the PANTHER System was evaluated in an interference study.
The table below describes the substances that were individually spiked into STM and
PreservCyt in STM sample matrices. Testing included 25 replicates containing each
potentially interfering substance alone as well as 25 replicates containing each
substance spiked with T. vaginalis lysate to a final concentration of 0.01 TV/mL.

Study results yielded no false positive results for all substances tested (100%
specificity) in both specimen matrices.
No interference with the detection of T. vaginalis (≥ 95% sensitivity) was observed
with any of the substances tested with the exception of Astroglide personal lubricant,
porcine gastric mucus, and glacial acetic acid. Astroglide personal lubricant and
glacial acetic acid interfered with the detection of T. vaginalis when tested at a
concentration of 0.01 TV/mL, however all specimens were positive as expected at
concentrations of 0.3 TV/mL. Porcine gastric mucus did not yield any false negative
results with the detection of T. vaginalis when tested at a concentration of 1 TV/mL
(100% sensitivity), however the RLU signal was suppressed. The package insert
includes the following limitation regarding potential interference from the presence
of mucus:
"TV-positive mucoid samples may exhibit decreased RLU values. To ensure proper
endocervical sampling, excess mucus should be removed."
h. Assay cut-off:
The ATV Assay on the PANTHER System is designed for and validated on the
PANTHER System. The assay test results are automatically interpreted by the
PANTHER System APTIMA Trichomonas vaginalis software. A test result may be
negative, positive or invalid as determined by the total Relative Light Units (RLU) in
the detection step. A test result may be invalid due to RLU values outside the normal
expected ranges. Initial invalid results should be retested.
Test Interpretation Total RLU (x 1000)
Negative 0* to <100
Positive 100 to <2400
Invalid 0* or >/= 2400
*If the RLU measured on the PANTHER System is between 0 and 999, a result of “0” is reported in the
“Total
RLU (000s)” column in the run report. Measured RLU values less than 690 are reported as invalid. RLU
values between 690 and 999 are reported as valid.
i. Carryover Study
Two studies were conducted to assess PANTHER instrument carry-over with the
ATV Assay. In the first study, high-titer T. vaginalis samples were prepared by
spiking TV lysate into specimen transport media (STM) to a final concentration of
10,000 TV/mL. The negative samples were comprised of STM. Testing included
four runs on each of three different PANTHER instruments. The first run was
comprised of all negative samples. The remaining runs were comprised of
approximately 30% TV-positive samples (n=78) interspersed amongst the negative
samples (n=170) in various patterns. In the second study, high positive and negative
samples were similarly prepared as described above. This study included runs

consisting of ~50% alternating TV-positive and negative samples in a checkerboard
pattern. Each of the studies yielded no false positive results and therefore a 0%
carryover contamination rate.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Agreement between APTIMA Trichomonas vaginalis Assay results on the
PANTHER System and the TIGRIS DTS System was assessed with prospectively
collected specimens from asymptomatic subjects. Women were enrolled from six US
clinical sites, including obstetrics and gynecology, family planning, and STD clinics.
One vaginal swab, one endocervical swab, and one PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap
specimen were collected from each subject. All specimens were clinician-collected.
PreservCyt liquid Pap specimens were collected with a broom-type device or a
spatula and cytobrush.
APTIMA Trichomonas vaginalis Assay testing was conducted in accordance with the
package insert instructions. PANTHER System testing was conducted at three sites
(two external laboratories and internally at Gen-Probe). TIGRIS DTS System testing
was conducted at Gen-Probe.
Eighteen APTIMA Trichomonas vaginalis Assay runs were initiated on the
PANTHER System; all were valid. A total of 227 vaginal swab, 227 endocervical
swab, and 227 PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap specimens were tested. Of these
specimens, one vaginal swab specimen (0.4%, 1/227) had an initial invalid result due
to hardware error. The specimen with an initial invalid result was retested and had a
valid result.
Of the samples with final valid APTIMA Trichomonas vaginalis Assay results on the
PANTHER System, 227 vaginal swabs, 227 endocervical swabs, and 226 PreservCyt
Solution liquid Pap specimens had valid, paired results on the TIGRIS DTS System.
The following table shows positive and negative percent agreements of APTIMA
Trichomonas vaginalis Assay results on the PANTHER System and the TIGRIS DTS
System in each specimen type for asymptomatic subjects.

3. Clinical studies:
Clinical performance of the ATV Assay on the PANTHER System was evaluated using
leftover specimens collected from consenting subjects during a previous, prospective,
multicenter clinical study of the ATV Assay on the TIGRIS DTS System. Symptomatic
and asymptomatic women were enrolled from nine US clinical sites, including obstetrics
and gynecology, family planning, and STD clinics. Patients > 14 years of age were
enrolled. Three vaginal swabs, one endocervical swab, and one PreservCyt Solution
liquid Pap specimen were collected from each subject. All specimens were clinician-
collected.
PreservCyt liquid Pap specimens were collected with a broom-type device or a spatula
and cytobrush. Two of the vaginal swab specimens were tested with a commercially
available culture system and wet mount microscopic examination to establish infected
status. The remaining specimens were prepared for APTIMA Trichomonas vaginalis
Assay testing in accordance with the appropriate APTIMA specimen collection kit
package insert instructions. PANTHER System testing with the APTIMA Trichomonas
vaginalis Assay was conducted at three sites (two external laboratories and Gen-Probe) in
accordance with package insert instructions.
Performance characteristics of the APTIMA Trichomonas vaginalis Assay were
estimated by comparing results to a patient infected status algorithm. In the algorithm, the
designation of a subject as being infected or non-infected with T. vaginalis was based on
results from vaginal swab specimens tested by culture and/or wet mount microscopic
examination. At least one of the reference test results was required to be positive to
14

--- Page 15 ---
establish an infected patient status. Both reference tests were required to be negative to
establish a non-infected patient status.
Twenty-three APTIMA Trichomonas vaginalis Assay runs were initiated on the
PANTHER System. Of these 23 runs, 1 (4.3%, 1/23) was aborted due to a fatal hardware
error that led to a software failure. Specimens tested in the aborted run were retested. A
total of 689 vaginal swab, 737 endocervical swab, and 791 PreservCyt Solution liquid
Pap specimens were tested in the 22 valid runs. Of these specimens, 12 vaginal swab
(1.7%, 12/689), 24 endocervical swab (3.3%, 24/737), and 29 PreservCyt Solution liquid
Pap (3.7%, 29/791) specimens had initial invalid results due to hardware or software
errors. Specimens with initial invalid results were retested. Eleven vaginal swab (1.6%,
11/689), 24 endocervical swab (3.3%, 24/737), and one PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap
(0.1%, 1/791) specimens had final invalid results due to hardware or software errors;
these specimens were excluded from the analyses.
The following table shows the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the APTIMA
Trichomonas vaginalis Assay on the PANTHER System and the prevalence of T.
vaginalis (based on the infected status) in each specimen type by symptom status and
overall. Subjects were classified as symptomatic if symptoms were reported by the
subject. Subjects were classified as asymptomatic if the subject did not report symptoms.
Prevalence was higher in symptomatic women.
