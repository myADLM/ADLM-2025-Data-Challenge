2. Indication(s) for use:
The ForSure One Step Buprenorphine Drug Cup Test Device is an
immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative determination of buprenorphine
in human urine at cutoff level of 10 ng/mL. The test is intended for prescription
and over-the-counter use.
The buprenorphine assay will yield preliminary positive results when
buprenorphine is ingested at or above therapeutic doses. There are no uniformly
recognized drug levels for buprenorphine in urine. The ForSure One Step
Buprenorphine Drug Cup Test Device shows the drug was or was not present at
the cutoff level. The assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A
more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a
confirmed analytical result. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) or
Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) are the preferred
confirmatory methods. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should
be applied to any drugs of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive
results are indicated.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription and over the counter use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable, as the devices are visually-read single-use devices.
I. Device Description:
The device is for use with human urine. The ForSure One Step Buprenorphine Drug
Cup Test Device is a single-test test strip. The ForSure One Step Buprenorphine Drug
Cup Test Device contains a test cup, test strip, and package insert (instructions for
use).

L. Test Principle:
The ForSure One Step Buprenorphine Drug Cup Test Device is based on lateral flow
immunochromatographic technology. Buprenorphine in urine sample competes with
the colloidal gold labeled monoclonal antibody-conjugates for binding to
Buprenorphine protein conjugates on the test zone area. In the absence of drug in the
sample, the Buprenorphine-protein conjugate binds to labeled antibody and produces
a magenta band in the test zone area, i.e., a negative result. If drug is present in the
sample, labeled antibody does not binds to the Buprenorphine-protein conjugate and
produces no magenta band in the test zone area, i.e., a positive result. The absence or
presence of the line is determined visually by the operator.
The device also has an internal process control which indicates that adequate volume
of sample has been added and that the immunochromatographic device is intact. A

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed using drug-free urine spiked to the
following concentrations: cutoff, +/-25%, +/-50%, +/-75% and 200% of the
cutoff. Also, negative urine was tested. The samples were aliquots,
randomized and blinded. Within-run reproducibility testing was conducted
using one lot tested by one operator in one run for a total of 30 determinations.
The between-run reproducibility testing was conducted using 3 lots tested by
three operators over 20 days. A total of 30 determinations were made at each
concentration for each lot. Sample concentrations were confirmed by GC/MS.
The results are displayed in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable, the device is intended for qualitative use
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This device has internal process controls. A colored line appearing in the
control region confirms sufficient sample volume and adequate membrane
wicking. Users are informed that the test is invalid if a line fails to appear in
the control region.
Control standards are not supplied with this device; however labeling states it
is good laboratory practice to confirm the test procedure and to verify proper
test performance. Users should follow all applicable guidelines for testing QC
materials.
Stability:
Accelerated studies have been conducted. Protocols and acceptance criteria
were described and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer claims the
following expiration date:
When stored at 2–30 ºC product is stable until expiration date which is 24
months.
Real time studies have been conducted and are on-going.
d. Detection limit:
See Precision/Reproducibility section in M1.a above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was established by spiking structurally related compounds
into drug-free urine. Results are expressed as a minimum concentration of
metabolite or compound required to produce a response approximately
equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the assay. The percent cross-
reactivity of those compounds are presented below:

Evaluation of Specific Gravity and pH on test results:
To evaluate the effect of pH value on the test results, urine samples at +/-25%
of the cutoff value were used. Each sample was adjusted to pH levels at 4.0,
4.5, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0 and 9.0. Each test sample was tested in duplicate.
To evaluate the effect of specific gravity, urine samples at +/-25% of the cut-
off values were spiked to obtain specific gravities of 1.003, 1.005 1.010,
1.015, 1.020,1.025, and 1.030. Each test sample was tested in duplicate.
The testing results demonstrate that varying pH’s and specific gravities do not
affect urine testing results around the analyte cut-off.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed
cutoff concentration appears in the precision section, M1.a, above.

A lay user study was performed at three intended user sites with 104 lay
persons. Participants in the study (53 females and 51 males) tested the
buprenorphine samples. They had diverse educational backgrounds and
ranged in age from 18 to 70. Urine samples were prepared at the following
concentrations; negative, +/-50%, +/-25% of the cutoff and at the cutoff by
spiking drug(s) into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The concentrations of
the samples were confirmed by GC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into
individual containers and blind-labeled.
Each participant was provided with the package insert, 1 blind labeled sample
and a device. The results are summarized below.
