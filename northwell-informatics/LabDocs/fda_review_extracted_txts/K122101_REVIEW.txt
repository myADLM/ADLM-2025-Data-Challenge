L. Test Principle:
The CAPILLARYS 2 FLEX Piercing HbA1c assay employs the principle of capillary
electrophoresis in free solution. With this technique, charged molecules are separated by their
electrophoretic mobility in an alkaline buffer with a specific pH. Separation also occurs
according to the electrolyte pH and electroosmotic flow.
The assay has silica capillaries functioning in parallel allowing 8 simultaneous analyses for
HbA1c quantification from a whole blood sample. A sample dilution with hemolysing
solution is prepared and injected by aspiration at the anodic end of the capillary. A high
voltage protein separation is them performed and direct detection of the hemoglobins is made
at the cathodic end of the capillary at 415 nm, which is the absorbance wavelength specific to
hemoglobins. Before each run, the capillaries are washed with a wash solution and prepared
for the next analysis with buffer.
Direct detection provided accurate relative quantification of individual hemoglobin A1c
fraction. In addition, the high resolution of CAPILLARYS HbA1c procedure allows the
quantification of HbA1c, and particularly, even in the presence of labile HbA1c,
carbamylated and acetylated hemoglobins, and major hemoglobin variants.
By using alkaline pH buffer, normal and abnormal (or variant) hemoglobins are detected in
the following order, from cathode to anode: A2/C, E, S/D, F, A0, other Hb (including minor
HbA1) and then A1c.
At the end of analysis, relative quantification of individual HbA1c fraction is performed
automatically. The HbA1c concentrations are standardized and indicated in %HbA1c
(DCCT/NGSP) and in mmol/mol (IFCC) units.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the CAPILLARYS HbA1c procedure was evaluated based on CLSI
EP6-A guideline “Evaluation of the Linearity Quantitative Measurement Procedures:
A Statistical Approach”. Two blood samples, including a normal sample with HbA1c
concentration at 4.0% and an elevated HbA1c level sample with HbA1c
concentration at 14.7% were mixed within different proportions and the dilutions
were electrophoresed with the CAPILLARYS HbA1c assay kit using the
CAPILLARYS 2 FLEX-PIERCING instrument. Samples were analyzed in duplicate.
A polynomial regression analysis was performed and the sponsor determined that the
3rd order regression provided the best fit. However, the % difference between 1st order
regression and the best fit 3rd order regression is less than 0.3%(A1c units) at all
linearity levels tested as summarized in the table below.

The shelf life of the freeze dried Hb A1c CAPILLARY Calibrators is 3 years at-
30˚C/-18˚C (-22˚F/0˚F). When reconstituted the in use storage stability is 1 week at 2-
8˚C (36-46˚F), 6 months at -22˚C / -18˚C (-8˚F/0˚F). The labeling states that the Hb
A1c CAPILLARY Calibrators should not be frozen and thawed more than 3 times.
The shelf life of the Hb A1c CAPILLARYS controls are 3 years at 2-8˚C (36-46˚F).
When reconstituted the controls are stable for 1 day at 2-8˚C (36-46˚F), 6 months at -
22˚C/-18˚C (-8˚F/0˚F). When hemolyzed the controls are stable for 1 month at -
22˚C/-18˚C (-8˚F/0˚F). The labeling states that the HbA1c CAPILLARYS controls
should not be frozen and thawed more than 3 times.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined by assaying
a zero sample (blank) and five low HbA1c samples according to CLSI guideline
EP17-A . The results are as follows:
LoB= 0.3%, LoD = 1.2%
The claimed measuring range, 4.0- 14.7%, is based on linearity. See 1b. above
e. Analytical specificity:
i.) Studies were performed to assess common or known substances that could
interfere with the CAPILLARYS HbA1c assay kit. The interfering substances were
evaluated in whole blood K3EDTA samples that contained three different
concentrations of A1c (~5.3%, ~7.0% and ~10.3%). Samples containing various
concentrations of potential interferents were tested and the results compared to those
obtained from control samples containing no potential interfering substances. The
sponsor’s definition of non-significant interference is ≥ 0.3% HbA1c between the
tested and the control samples.
The results are as follows:
Potential interfering substance Concentration at which no significant
interference (≤0.3%) was observed
Bilirubin ≤ 25.6 mg/dL
Triglycerides ≤ 1120 mg/dL
Rheumatoid Factor ≤ 2178 IU/mL

ii.) To study interference from Carbamlyated hemoglobin, three K3EDTA whole
blood patient samples with A1c concentrations at ~5.1%, ~7.0% and ~10.1% were
split into two aliquots. One aliquot, at each A1c level, was spiked with 1mmol/L of
Potassium Cyanate and incubated for 3 hours at 37˚C. Another aliquot, at each A1c
level, was incubated for 3 hours at 37˚C. Samples were then analyzed on the
CAPILLARYS 2 FLEX-PIERCING instrument using the CAPILLARYS HbA1c
assay kit, Samples were analyzed in triplicate. The sponsor’s definition of non-
significant interference is ≤ 0.3 HbA1c% between the tested and the control samples.
The sponsor concluded that Carbamylated hemoglobin does not interfere with this
assay.
iii.) To study interference from labile hemoglobin, three K3EDTA whole blood
patient samples with A1c concentrations at ~5.3%, ~7.7% and ~11.3% were split into
two aliquots. One aliquot, at each A1c level, was spiked with glucose (100
mmol/mol; glucose concentration= 1800 mg/dL) and incubated for 90 minutes at
37˚C. Another aliquot, at each A1c level, was incubated for 90 minutes at 37˚C.
Samples were then analyzed on the CAPILLARYS 2 FLEX-PIERCING instrument
using the CAPILLARYS HbA1c assay kit. Samples were tested in triplicate. The
sponsor’s definition of non-significant interference is ≤ 0.3 HbA1c%.
The sponsor concluded that labile A1c does not interfere with this assay.
iii.) To study interference from acetylated hemoglobin, two whole blood K3 EDTA
samples with A1c concentrations at ~4.9% and ~ 8.3% were split into two aliquots.
One aliquot, at each A1c level, was used as the control sample and the other aliquot
was spiked with acetylated hemoglobin (180 mg/dL conc.) and incubated for 6 hours
at 37˚C. All aliquots were tested on the CAPILLARYS 2 FLEX-PIERCING
instrument using the CAPILLARYS HbA1c assay kit. Samples were tested in
triplicate. The sponsor’s definition of non-significant interference is ≤ 0.3 HbA1c%.
The sponsor concluded that acetylated hemoglobin up to 180 mg/dL does not
interfere with this assay.
iv.) To study interference from acetylsalicylic acid, two whole blood K3EDTA
samples with A1c concentrations at ~4.9% and ~8.3% were split into two aliquots.
One aliquot, at each A1c level, was used as the control sample and the other aliquot
was incubated at 37˚C for 6 hours with acetylsalicylic acid (180 mg/dL). The control
samples which did not contain acetylsalicylic acid were incubated at 37˚C for 6 hours.
All aliquots were tested on the CAPILLARYS 2 FLEX-PIERCING instrument using
the CAPILLARYS HbA1c assay kit. Samples were tested in triplicate. The sponsor’s
definition of non-significant interference is ≤ 0.3 HbA1c%.

Urea	≤291 mg/dL
Ascorbic Acid	≤ 60 mg/dL
Glybenclamide	≤3 mg/dL

The sponsor concluded that acetylsalicylic acid up to 180 mg/dL does not interfere
with this assay.
v) A hemoglobin variant interference study was carried out using samples known to
contain Hemoglobin variants S, E, D and C. These variant samples were tested on the
CAPILLARYS 2 FLEX-PIERCING instrument using the CAPILLARYS HbA1c
assay kit. The sponsor’s definition of non-significant interference is ±10% difference
between the candidate method and the comparative method.
The testing results show there is no significant interference for HbS (≤ 40%), HbE (≤
32%), HbD (≤ 42%) and HbC (≤ 44%).
The sponsor includes the following limitation in their labeling: “due to the number of
variants, the presence of another hemoglobin variant may be observed in the HbA1c
migration zone; in the case of a shoulder on HbA1c, no result will be reported by the
software.
vi) An additional variant interference study was carried out to study the variant
interference from Hemoglobin F. Two whole blood samples with HbA1c
concentrations of ~5.5% and ~8.3% contained varying concentrations of HbF and
were tested on the CAPILLARYS 2 FLEX-PIERCING instrument using the
CAPILLARYS HbA1c assay kit.
The testing results show there is no significant interference for HbF ≤ 15% therefore
the sponsor has included the following limitation in their labeling: Samples that
contain high amounts of HbF (>15%), usually found in some people with
thalassemia, infants, and in some pregnant women, may yield a lower than expected
HbA1c result with this assay.
