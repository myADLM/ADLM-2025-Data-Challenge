G. Intended Use:
1. Indication(s) for Use:
The Virtuoso™ system provides automated digital slide creation, management, analysis,
and viewing. It is intended for in vitro diagnostic use as an aid to the pathologist in the
display, detection, counting, review and classification of tissues and cells of clinical
interest based on particular morphology, color, intensity, size, pattern and shape.
The Virtuoso™ System for IHC PR (1E2) is for digital read and image analysis
applications. This particular Virtuoso™ system is intended for use as an aid to the
2

--- Page 3 ---
pathologist in the detection and semi-quantitative measurement of progesterone
receptor (PR) protein in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded normal and neoplastic
tissue. This device is an accessory to the Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. CONFIRM™
anti-Progesterone Receptor (PR) (1E2) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody assay.
The CONFIRM™ anti-Progesterone Receptor (PR) (1E2) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary
Antibody assay is indicated for use as an aid in the assessment of breast cancer patients
for whom endocrine treatment is being considered (but is not the sole basis for
treatment).
Note: The IHC PR (1E2) Digital Read and Image Analysis applications are adjunctive
computer-assisted methodologies for the qualified pathologist in the acquisition and
measurement of images from microscope glass slides of breast cancer specimens stained
for the presence of PR protein. The pathologist should verify agreement with the Image
Analysis software application score. The accuracy of the test results depends on the
quality of the immunohistochemical staining. It is the responsibility of a qualified
pathologist to employ appropriate morphological studies and controls as specified in the
instructions for the CONFIRM™ anti-Progesterone Receptor (PR) (1E2) Rabbit
Monoclonal Primary Antibody used to assure the validity of the Virtuoso System for IHC
PR Digital Read and Image Analysis scores. The actual correlation of CONFIRM™ anti-
PR antibody to clinical outcome has not been established.
2. Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
For prescription use only.
Indicated for use with either the Benchmark XT or ULTRA™ stainers.
* A precautionary statement indicating that this device has not been tested, or its safety
and effectiveness validated, when used with a personal computer (PC) from home was
included in the Limitations section of the device package insert.
H. Substantial Equivalence Information:
1. Predicate Device Name(s) and 510(k) number(s):
Ventana Virtuoso™ System for IHC PR (1E2) for use with the Benchmark XT stainer

a. Accuracy:
The performance of the Virtuoso™ System for PR (1E2) when used in conjunction
with the Benchmark ULTRA™ stainer was validated by assessing the positive
percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), and overall percent
agreement (OPA) between the reference manual method (with a traditional
microscope) and both the digital read (DR) and image analysis (IA) applications of
the Virtuoso™ system. A total of 120 patient slides were scored as positive or
negative for PR status using the percent positive staining cutoff of <1% for the
distinction between positive and negative staining. . The agreements with the 95%
confidence intervals (CI) around the agreements are shown below. All confidence
intervals are 2-sided 95% confidence intervals calculated using the score method.
