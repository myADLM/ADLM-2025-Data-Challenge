H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The AggreGuide A-100 Aspirin assay is a qualitative system to aid in the detection of
platelet dysfunction due to aspirin ingestion by those 18 years of age or older in 3.2%
citrated venous whole blood. For professional use.
This test is not for use in patients with underlying congenital platelet abnormalities or in
patients receiving non-aspirin anti-platelet agents.
The test results should be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory
data available to the clinician.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as intended use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
Limitations:
Pre and Post 325 mg Aspirin study - The study results used to demonstrate the
performance of the AA assay are based predominantly on healthy subjects (i.e. having 2
or less cardiovascular disease risk factors) ingesting non-coated aspirin. Ten percent
(10%) of study subjects showed platelet dysfunction at baseline without ingesting aspirin.
Post 81 mg Aspirin Study - Sixty (n=60) healthy subjects were studied at one time point
post-aspirin ingestion of non-coated aspirin. Twelve (n=12) of subjects were on chronic
aspirin, and forty eight (n=48) subjects took aspirin for one week. Eighty-two percent
(82%) of the subjects showed platelet dysfunction post aspirin ingestion. The prevalence
of platelet dysfunction at baseline for patients taking 81 mg aspirin has not been
established.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The AggreGuide A-100 instrument is required to test the AggreGuide A-100 AA assay.
I. Device Description:
The AggreGuide A-100 system consists of a stand-alone AggreGuide A-100 instrument and
single use AggreGuide A-100 AA cartridge. Sodium citrated venous whole blood is added to
the cartridge in the reaction chamber containing freeze dried arachidonic acid. The amount
of platelet aggregation is measured by detecting the laser light scattered. Result is reported
as Platelet Activity Index (PAI). The PAI is related to the number of platelets aggregated.

--- Page 3 ---
Higher PAI values represent a higher level of platelet aggregation. Lower PAI values
represent a lower level of platelet aggregation.

L. Test Principle:
The AggreGuide A-100 is a laser light scattering system that detects the level of platelet
aggregation induced by arachidonic acid agonist when whole blood is added to the
AggreGuide A-100 AA assay cartridge. Arachidonic acid in the platelet is oxygenated and
rearranged by cyclooxygenase (COX-1) into endoperoxide and subsequently into
thromboxane. When thromboxane is released from the platelets and binds to the
thromboxane receptors, platelet aggregation occurs. Aspirin irreversibly inactivates COX-1
which renders the platelets unresponsive to arachidonic acid, causes platelet dysfunction.
The amount of platelet aggregation is measured by detecting the laser light scattered. Result
is reported as Platelet Activity Index (PAI).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
i. Simple Precision: Blood samples from three donors with low, mid, and high PAI
levels were tested. Twenty replicates of each donor were used to assess the
repeatability of the AggreGuide A-100 system.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Not applicable
Stability:
AggreGuide A-100 AA Assay Cartridge: To support a 12 month shelf life, the study
was conducted at different time points for a 14 month period. Multiple lots were used
in the study. At each time point, the aged cartridge was tested and results were
compared to a freshly made cartridge using split fresh whole blood samples. Results
were within acceptable limits.
Controls:
§ Each reagent cartridge is checked by the AggreGuide instrument to ensure the
cartridge is functioning properly.
§ The electronic QC cartridge is performed weekly to verify that there have been no
changes in the light scattering signal from the factory calibration.
§ There are no manufactured external controls for AggreGuide A-100 AA assay.
The manufacturer recommends that laboratories should establish their own donor
reagent controls and may consider the following when establishing control donor
groups:
1) Normal PAI value: Blood drawn from healthy adults may be used for
normal controls. The donor must not have taken any medication that is
known to affect platelet function for at least 7 days and should have prior
platelet aggregation tests that have fallen within the normal range
established by the laboratory. The manufacturer recommends using
donors whose PAI value is >5.
2) Abnormal PAI value: Blood drawn from a donor who has been on aspirin
may be used for abnormal controls. The donor must be on chronic aspirin
treatment. The manufacturer recommends using donors whose PAI value
is <4.
Aggredyne recommends that normal and abnormal donor control checks be
performed for each new lot of AA assay cartridges. Additional QC check may be
performed on a monthly, weekly, daily or shift basis based on the laboratory’s

quality control policies. The end user should follow the recommendations of
local and state regulatory agencies as well as facility policies.
Calibrators:
No calibrators are provided. Calibration is established by the manufacturer.
d. Detection limit:
To determine the blank/noise level for the AggreGuide A-100, three instruments and
two assay cartridges specifically prepared (without reagents, without agonist) were
used in the study. Blood samples from three donors were tested on each type of
cartridge for 28 to 30 replicates. The study demonstrated that the PAI values 0-2
represent the blank/noise level, no detectable aggregation.
e. Analytical specificity:
i. Bilirubin: Blood was collected from 3 donors and spiked with bilirubin
solution yielding control and elevated bilirubin samples. The AA assays were
conducted in duplicate. The study demonstrated that there is no significant
difference in platelet aggregation between the control samples and elevated
bilirubin samples up to 10 mg/dL.
ii. Hemolysis: Blood was collected from 3 donors and spiked with hemoglobin.
The AA assays were performed in singlicate. The results indicate that there is
no significant difference in platelet aggregation between the control samples
and samples with elevated hemoglobin up to 600 mg/dL.
iii. Lipid: Measurements of PAI from the AA assay were compared to the
baseline and elevated triglyceride from 3 donors subsequent to a high fat
meal. The study demonstrated that there is no significant difference in platelet
aggregation between the control samples and samples with elevated
triglyceride up to 360 mg/dL.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
At one study site, results for the AggreGuide A-100 AA assay were compared to the
predicate device VerifyNow® Aspirin assay for detection of aspirin effect in 63 adult
subjects regardless of their aspirin status who were not taking warfarin or other
anticoagulant medications.

The clinical performance of the AggreGuide A-100 AA assay was evaluated at three
sites with 169 healthy adults for pre and post 325 mg aspirin ingestion. Sixteen (16)
subjects were not evaluable because pre-aspirin ingestion PAI results were below 4.
Thirteen (13) subjects did not return for post-aspirin ingestion, two (2) subjects did
not pass inclusion criteria, yielding 138 evaluable subjects. Each test subject had a
baseline AA assay measurement. Then subjects took a single dose of 325 mg non-
