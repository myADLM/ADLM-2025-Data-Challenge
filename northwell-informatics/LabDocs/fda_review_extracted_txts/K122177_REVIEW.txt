ELITech Clinical Systems Urine Total Protein Standard 100 mg/dL
i. Traceability: The ELITech Clinical Systems Urine Total Protein
Standard 100 mg/dL is traceable to NIST SRM 927.
ii. Stability: Accelerated and real-time testing (on-going) have been
conducted using multiple lots of the ELITech Clinical Systems Urine
Total Protein Standard 100 mg/dL. In addition, open vial stability has
been evaluated. The claimed stability for closed vial shelf life of the
ELITech Clinical Systems Urine Total Protein Standard 100 mg/dL is
18 months when stored at 2°-8° C. Open vial stability is 3 months
when stored at 2°-8° C. The stability study protocols and the sponsor
defined acceptance criteria have been reviewed and found to be
acceptable.
iii. Value assignment: Value assignment of the ELITech Clinical Systems
Urine Total Protein Standard 100 mg/dL is obtained by assaying the
new calibrator sets as unknowns, run in triplicate on one each of the
Selectra Pro analyzers. The mean is calculated based upon comparison
with an already approved calibrator lot and control materials. The newly
assigned values are validated against reference materials, the previous lot
of standard, and controls. The value assignment protocols and the
sponsor defined acceptance criteria have been reviewed and found to
be acceptable.
ELITech Clinical Systems Urine Control Bi-Level
i. Stability: Control material is purchased from a commercial vendor
(previously cleared under k020817) with no change to the content and
the packaging except the labeling change. The sponsor claims the
following stability determined by the provider is: Closed vial 24
months at 2°-8° C, open vial—30 days at 2°-8° C.
ii. Value assignment: Value assignment was determined for urine total
protein using multiple analyzer platforms. Value assignment data were
collated and an appropriate target value was assigned to each analyte
based on the average of the observed values. Ranges were then
assigned as +/- 20% of the target. The labeling states that obtained
values should fall within the specified range provided on lot-specific
value sheets and that laboratories should establish appropriate
acceptance criteria when using this product for its intended use.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Not applicable.
