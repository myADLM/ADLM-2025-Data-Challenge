I. Device Description:
The eBchek Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the eBchek Blood
Glucose Meter, eBchek Blood Glucose Test Strips, Lancing device, Lancets, Code
card, two AAA Batteries, User’s Manual, and Carrying Case. eB-series Control
Solutions (Level 1 and Level 2 are available but sold separately.
Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional
readings. A calibration card is provided with each batch of test strips to calibrate the
meter for that batch. No further calibrations are required of the user.
The eB-series Control Solutions contain a known amount of glucose that reacts with
eBchek Test Strips. Two different concentrations of eB-series control solutions,
Level 1 and Level 2 , are used to check if the meter and test strips are working
together properly and that users are performing the test correctly. The test result
using control solution should fall within an expected range of results printed on the
vial of test strips.
The eBchek Blood Glucose Meter has a speaker function but is not intended for use
by the visually impaired.

L. Test Principle:
The eBchek Blood Glucose Monitoring System uses electrochemical methodologies
to quantitatively measure blood glucose levels by amperometry. The device detects
the current produced from oxidation of blood glucose by the enzyme glucose oxidase
impregnated in the test strip. The electrons generated during this reaction are
transferred from the blood to the electrodes. The magnitude of the resultant current is
proportional to the concentration of glucose in the specimen and the signal is
converted into a readout displayed on the meter.

Traceability
This assay is traceable to the YSI method and NIST material SRM965.
Stability - eB-series Controls:
Stability for the eB-series Controls was established when the controls were
previously cleared under k062555 with the name eBsensor Control Solutions.
Stability – eBchek Glucose Test Strips
Opened vial test strip stability was evaluated in real-time and accelerated
studies. Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable. The data from these studies supports the claimed open vial
stability of 90 days when stored at 4-30°C and 10 – 85% relative humidity
Real time studies to evaluate the shelf life (closed-vial) stability of the test
strips were conducted. Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and
found to be acceptable. The data from these studies supports the claimed
closed vial stability of two years when stored 4-30°C and 10 – 85% relative
humidity.
This information is provided in the labeling of the test strips and control
materials.
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the device is 20 - 600 mg/dL. This range was
validated by the linearity study (M.1.b).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies for endogenous and exogenous studies were conducted
on 10 eBchek meters, with three lots of test strips using venous blood
samples. Five glucose concentrations covering the measuring range of the
device were analyzed. Potential interference was evaluated for 25 common
endogenous and exogenous potential interferents at two concentrations (low
and high) as recommended in CLSI EP7-A guideline. Significant
interference is defined as a bias ≥ ± 10 % from the control group as measured
by the reference method.
The sponsor claims no significant interference from the following
substances at the concentrations shown in the table below:

User Performance Study:
A user study was conducted with 150 volunteer lay users who tested his or her
own blood samples. The study subjects ranged in age from 33 to 89 years and
were about equally divided between males and females. There was a range of
educational backgrounds but none had any experience with self-testing for
glucose. The only training provided was for the participants to read the User
Manual. After reading the User Manual in English only, the subjects
performed their own fingerstick without any practice tests and tested their
blood glucose using the Visgineer system. Immediately afterwards, a
technician collected another fingerstick sample to be tested using the
Visgineer system. Finally, a capillary blood sample from the finger was
collected and analyzed on the reference analyzer. The samples tested had
glucose concentrations ranging from 58 to 451 mg/dL as measured by the
reference method. The results of linear regression analysis are as follows:

The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the
fingertips only. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by
capillary action.
5. Calibration:
The device must be coded with the code card provided with each vial of test
strips. No further calibration is required.
6. Quality Control:
Two levels of glucose control solution (Level 1 and Level 2) are available for
the eBchek Blood Glucose Monitoring System. The meter cannot automatically
recognize the control solution, so the user needs to switch to the control mode for a
control solution test so the result will not be stored in the meter memory as a blood
glucose result. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are
provided in the labeling. An acceptable range for each control level is printed
on the test strip vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the
control result falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered
In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study:
The effect of different hematocrit levels on the accuracy of the device was
evaluated on the eBchek Blood Glucose Monitoring System with 5 meters
and one test strip lot. Blood samples at 8 hematocrit levels from 20% to 60%
(20, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60 %) were adjusted to 8 concentrations of
glucose covering approximately 20 to 600 mg/dL. Five replicates were tested
for each hematocrit level and glucose concentration. Glucose concentrations
were compared to YSI. The study results indicate samples with hematocrit
from 20% - 60% do not cause unacceptable bias with glucose concentrations
between 20 - 600 mg/dL.
2. Altitude study:
Venous whole blood samples were spiked with glucose to five target
ranges: <30, 30 – 50, 50 – 100, 250 – 350, and 500 – 600 mg/dL. Blood
glucose target concentrations were verified by the reference YSI glucose
analyzer. Glucose measurements were obtained using the eBchek Blood
Glucose Monitoring System at an altitude of 8125 ft. The results
demonstrate acceptable bias for samples with glucose concentration > 35
mg/dL; the results support the claims in the labeling that altitudes up to
8,000 feet have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements from
the eBchek Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

3. Sample volume study:
A sample volume study was performed to verify the claimed test strip
minimum sample volume Samples were tested at 5 volumes (0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5
and 1.0 μL) and values obtained were compared to YSI values. Results
support the claimed sample volume of 0.5 µL.
4. Temperature and humidity studies:
The sponsor performed studies using venous whole blood samples (glucose
concentrations 103, 255, and 552 mg/dL) to evaluate the effect of temperatures
ranging from 39 – 108° F (4 - 42° C) and relative humidity from 10% - 90%.
Meter results were compared to YSI 2300 reference analyzer. Four temperature
and humidity combinations were tested including low temperature/low
humidity, low temperature/high humidity, high temperature/low humidity and
high temperature/high humidity. The results support the claims in the labeling
that the system can be used in conditions of 10 - 40°C with relative humidity of
10 - 85%
5. Infection Control Studies:
The device is intended for single-patient use. Disinfection efficacy studies were
performed using materials that comprise the meter and lancing device by an
outside commercial testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of
hepatitis B (HBV) with Dispatch Hospital Cleaner Disinfectant Towels with
Bleach (EPA Reg No. 56392-8). The sponsor also demonstrated that there was
no change in performance or in the external materials of the meter and lancing
device up to 260 cleaning and disinfection cycles (one cycle includes one
cleaning wipe plus one disinfecting wipe) to simulate 5 years of meter and
lancing device use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the
validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
6. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Testing
EMC testing was performed by SGS Taiwan LTD. The testing lab provided a
certificate dated Sept 27, 2010 stating that the device met all applicable
requirements. Please also see section K above for specific standards related to
EMC testing.
7. Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the result show grade
level for eBchek user manual, test strip insert and control solution insert were
7.7, 7.4 and 8.1 respectively.
