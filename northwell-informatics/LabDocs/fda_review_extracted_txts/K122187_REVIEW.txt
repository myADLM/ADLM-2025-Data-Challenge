1. Intended use:
VRESelect™ is a selective and differential chromogenic medium, containing
8 μg/mL of vancomycin, for the qualitative detection of gastrointestinal
colonization of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) and
vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VREfs) and to aid in the prevention
and control of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) in healthcare settings.
The test is performed on rectal swabs, or fecal specimens from patients to be
screened for VRE colonization. VRESelect™ is not intended to diagnose VRE
infection nor to guide or monitor treatment of infection. Results can be
interpreted after 24 to 28 hours incubation. Subculture to non-selective media
(e.g., trypticase soy agar with 5% sheep blood) is needed for further identification,
susceptibility testing and epidemiological typing.

4. Special instrument requirements:
Not Applicable.
I. Device Description:
VRESelect™ is a selective medium for the detection of vancomycin-resistant
Enterococcus (VRE). The selectivity of this medium is based on the presence of an
antifungal/antibiotic mixture that inhibits the growth of most yeast, Gram negative
and Gram positive bacteria, with the exception of VRE. Vancomycin-resistant E.
faecium will appear as pink colonies on the agar medium. Blue colonies on the agar
medium, suggestive of vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis should be confirmed by
catalase and antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

L. Test Principle:
VRESelect ™ is a selective medium for the detection of vancomycin-resistant
Enterococcus (VRE). The selectivity of this medium is based on the presence of an
antifungal/antibiotic mixture that inhibits the growth of most yeasts, Gram negative
and Gram positive bacteria, with the exception of VRE.
Detection is based on the cleavage of chromogenic substrates by specific enzymes of
Enterococcus faecium which produces pink colonies and Enterococcus faecalis which
produces blue colonies.
Enterococcus gallinarum and Enterococcus casseliflavus are intrinsically resistant to
vancomycin and may grow on the VRESelect™ medium as colorless or white
colonies because they do not metabolize the chromogenic substrates. Vancomycin-
susceptible enterococci are inhibited.
After 24 to 28 hours incubation pink colonies can be reported as vancomycin-resistant
E. faecium and blue colonies should be confirmed by a catalase test and susceptibility
testing.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated at three sites using a blinded panel of six
ATCC reference strains including two vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis
strains, three vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains and one strain of
vancomycin-susceptible E. faecalis. At each site, three technicians tested the
panel on three lots of the VRESelect™ each day, for three days. The strains
produced the expected results with the VRESelect™ 100% of the time both at
24 and 28 hours.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The following recommended quality control (QC) organisms were used: E.
faecium (vanA) ATCC 700221 and E. faecalis (vanB) ATCC 51299 as
positive controls, and E. faecalis ATCC 29212 as negative control. Quality
control was performed on each day of testing by preparing a 0.5 McFarland
suspension of each QC strain then diluting is 1:10 and transferring 10 µL of
5

--- Page 6 ---
this suspension to the VRESelect™ agar surface streaking for isolation.
Quality control data was compiled across all three sites and overall QC results
were acceptable.
QC Data Summary
QC Strain Expected Results after 24- 28 hours at
35- 37°C
Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 51299 Growth- small blue colonies
Enterococcus faecium ATCC 700221 Growth- small pink colonies
Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 No growth
d. Detection limit:
The minimum concentration of VRE reliably detected by VRESelect ™ is 103
CFU/mL. Details of the recovery study are found in Section f below.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity Study
A Cross-reactivity study was performed using at total of 119 strains of Gram
negative rods, Gram positive cocci and yeast. No cross-reactivity was
observed with any of the organisms tested and no variation was seen between
the 24 and 28 hour incubation time.
Interference Study
The following substances were evaluated at physiologically or biologically
relevant concentrations for potential interference with the performance of the
VRESelect™ medium:
· Dulcolax, Adult Glycerin Suppositories, Vaseline, Preparation H, Original
Boudreaux’s Butt Paste, Tuck’s Medicated Cooling Pads, Pepto-Bismol,
Miconazole cream, Nonoxynol-9 (spermicide), KY Jelly, and Pepcid AC
Max strength.
· Blood and Mucins
· Three commonly used transport media – Amies without charcoal, Cary
Blair and LQ Stuart
The interfering substances tested caused no significant differences between
the number of colonies observed on the control plates and the number of
colonies observed on the VRESelect™ plates. The only exceptions were
Tuck’s Medicated Cooling Pads and Miconazole cream. Regarding Tuck’s
Medicated Pads, no pink coloration was observed after 24 hours on the
VRESelect™ plates that had been inoculated with vancomycin-resistant
E. faecium (ATCC 700221). Regarding Miconazole cream, an inhibitory
effect on the growth of Enterococcus colonies on the VRESelect™ plates was

observed. Blood and mucin (3% to 5%) caused delayed colonial growth of
one strain of vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis (ATCC 51299) tested. The
growth of the same strain of vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis was inhibited at
blood and mucin concentrations of 30% to 50%.
Mixed Infection Study
A mixed infection study was conducted to demonstrate that high levels
(1X107 CFU/mL or higher) of E. gallinarum and/or E. casseliflavus will not
suppress the growth of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium or E. faecalis. The
results of the study revealed E. faecium or E. faecalis are still detected on the
VRESelect ™ medium in the presence of high levels of E. casseliflavus and
E. gallinarum.
f. Analytical Sensitivity
Recovery Study
The minimum concentration of VRE reliably detected by VRESelect ™ is 103
CFU/mL.
To determine the percent recovery for the VRESelect ™ media a panel of
eighteen (18) vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE)– (8) strains of
vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and (10) strains of vancomycin-resistant E.
faecalis – were tested at varying dilutions. A 0.5 McFarland suspension of
each strain was prepared. A series of 10-fold serial dilutions in saline were
carried out and inoculated onto three lots of VRESelect ™ plates and one lot
of Blood Agar plates. The plates were incubated at 35-37°C ambient air and
read at 24 and 28 hours. The color and number of colonies were recorded. The
Blood Agar plates were used to confirm the inoculum concentration at each
dilution. Data confirm that the minimum concentration of VRE reliably
detected by VRESelect ™ is 103 CFU/mL.
g. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The performance of the VRESelect™ agar medium was evaluated at three
laboratory sites. A total of 946 fecal samples were evaluated. Fecal samples
were inoculated using the indirect inoculation method where approximately
0.5 g of stool is placed in 1 mL of saline, then mixed by vortexing. Using a
swab or a disposable loop, approximately 10-50 μl is transferred onto the
VRESelect™ agar medium and the Bile Esculin Azide Agar with 6μg/ml of
7

Vancomycin (BEAV). The BEAV plates were observed for growth at 24 and
48 hours. The VRESelect™ plates were observed at 24 and 28 hours.
Colonies with blue or pink pigment (VRESelect™) or brown to black pigment
diffusing into the medium (BEAV), were identified by a combination of
conventional reference methods to include Gram stain, catalase, PYR, VITEK
2 identification, and vancomycin MIC E-Test.
Percent agreement of the VRESelect™ compared to BEAV and conventional
methods is presented in Table 1. Specimens that were positive on the
VRESelect (i.e. grew pink or blue colonies between 24 and 28 hours
incubation) were compared to specimens that were confirmed positive based
on growth and pigment on BEAV combined with Gram stain, catalase test,
PYR test, biochemical identification, and E-test MIC)
