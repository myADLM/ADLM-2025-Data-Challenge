510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number: K122189
B. Purpose for Submission: The purpose of this submission is to show that the Quidel
Molecular RSV + hMPV Assay is substantially equivalent to Prodesse’s ProFlu™ Assay and Pro
hMPV+ Assay. The ProFlu Assay detects RSV RNA while the Pro hMPV+ assay detects hMPV
RNA.
C. Measurand: This assay detects the presence of RSV and hMPV nucleic acid using RT-PCR.
Both viruses have negative single-stranded RNA genomes. The RT-PCR primers are developed
to bind to conserved regions of L viral polymerase and NS2 genes for RSV and RNA polymerase
gene for hMPV.
D. Type of Test: This is a nucleic acid based test using reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR). The negative sense RNA genomes of RSV and hMPV are reverse
transcribed and then amplified during the RT-PCR reaction. The presence of RSV or hMPV
RNA is then detected through sequence-specific labeled probe that is cleaved during PCR
amplification releasing the fluorescence reporter dye from the quencher dye.
E. Applicant: Quidel Corporation
F. Proprietary and Established Names: Quidel® Molecular RSV + hMPV Assay
G. Regulatory Information:
1. Regulation section: 21 CFR866.3980, Respiratory viral panel multiplex nucleic acid assay
2. Classification: Class II
3. Product code: OEM, OCC
4. Panel: Microbiology (83)
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Quidel Molecular RSV + hMPV assay is a multiplex Real Time RT-PCR assay for the
qualitative detection and identification of respiratory syncytial virus and human
metapneumovirus RNA extracted from nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs specimens from patients
with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. This in vitro diagnostic test is intended to aid
in the differential diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus
infections in humans in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors. This test is
not intended to differentiate the two subtypes of RSV or the four genetic sub-lineages of hMPV.

Negative results do not preclude RSV infection and/or hMPV infection and should not be used as
the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other patient management decisions.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as intended use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Cepheid SmartCycler II or ABI 7500 Fast Dx
I. Device Description: The Quidel Molecular RSV + hMPV Assay detects viral nucleic acids
that have been extracted from a patient sample using the NucliSENS® easyMAG® automated
extraction platform. An RT-PCR reaction is then performed in a single tube generating
amplicons for each of the target viruses present in the sample. This reaction is performed
utilizing either the Cepheid SmartCycler® II or the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast DX.
Identification of RSV and hMPV and the PRC occurs by the use of target-specific primers and
fluorescent-labeled probes that hybridize to conserved regions in the genomes of RSV and
hMPV and the PRC. Results are analyzed by either the Cepheid or ABI software and reported to
the user.

L. Test Principle:
This is a nucleic acid based test using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
Viral infection is detected through the use of PCR to amplify and detect viral RNA. The
negative sense RNA genomes of RSV and hMPV are reverse-transcribed and then amplified
during the RT-PCR reaction. The presence of RSV or hMPV RNA is then detected through
sequence-specific labeled probe that is cleaved during PCR amplification releasing the
fluorescence reporter dye from the quencher dye.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility studies were performed on both thermal cycler instruments, the Cepheid
SmartCycler II and ABI 7500 Fast Dx. The studies were conducted at three separate testing sites
where two users tested each virus sample in triplicate over 5 days. The hMPV-A2 or RSV A
viruses were tested at High Negative (0.05xLoD), Low Positive, close to the detection limit (2x
LoD) and Medium Positive (5x LoD) concentrations. The viruses were diluted in a negative
nasal matrix. Negative and positive controls were included in the study. The positive control
was each virus diluted in UTM and the negative controls were UTM only (Negative control) and
negative nasal matrix (RSV and hMPV negative). To conduct each test, the contrived samples
were extracted using the bioMérieux easyMAG system and tested on either the Cepheid
SmartCycler II or the ABI 7500 Fast Dx.

matrix as was used in the Reproducibility Study. Briefly, hMPV-A2 and RSV were diluted into
negative clinical matrix at 5x LoD, 2x LoD and 0.15x LoD. The viral panel was tested before
freezing and then after frozen storage at -70°C for 22-56 days; each sample was tested in
triplicate. No intermediate time points were tested for the stability studies. Additionally, 99
clinical samples were tested within 72 hours of collection and once again after 7 days at -70°C.

Sample storage at -70°C for up to 56 days did not impact the ability of the Quidel Molecular
RSV + hMPV Assay to detect either RSV or hMPV positive near the clinical cut-off. 2x and 5x
LoD samples were both detected 100% (90/90) of the time. There was also no statistical
difference in Ct value before and after freezing for the 2x LoD and 5x LoD samples. The data of
the 99 clinical samples, not shown here, also did not show any significant change in Ct value
over time when samples were stored at -70°C.
Stability studies were also performed on rehydrated master mix and extracted RNA samples.
hMPV or RSV viruses at 3x LoD were added to negative sample matrix, extracted for RNA and
the RT-PCR reaction was performed; the master mix study was performed in triplicate while the
RNA extraction study was performed in quadruplicate. The master mix was stable at room
temperature and 2° to 8°C for 2 days and for 5 days at -20°C. Extracted RNA stability studies
showed that hMPV and RSV extracted RNA was stable for 6 hours at 2°to 8°C, 4 hours at room
temperature, one month at -20°C and for 96 hours at -20°C with up to 3 freeze/thaw cycles.
There was no significant change in Ct value during any of the stability studies which supports the
stability claims.
d. Detection limit:
The LoD was determined for hMPV and RSV using each of the 4 genetic sub-lineages and 2
subtypes of each virus respectively. Virus was diluted in pooled negative NP swab clinical
matrix. Each virus sub-lineage/subtype was diluted and each dilution was extracted and run 20
times using both the Cepheid SmartCycler II and ABI 7500 Fast Dx, The LoD was determined to
be the lowest titer at which the virus was detected greater than 95% of the time (19/20 or 20/20).
For hMPV-A2, hMPV-B2, RSV A and RSV B three separate kit lots were tested and a
representative titer was chosen that showed the best repeatability. The final LoD titers were
reported for each instrument and all future calculations used the LoD for the specific virus and
thermal cycler on which an experiment was being conducted.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference:
To evaluate the potential interference of other common respiratory pathogens the organisms in
the table below were tested. Samples were prepared by adding RSV B or hMPV-B2 and the
potential interference organism into negative clinical matrix at 3x LoD. The potential
interference organisms were tested at one clinically relevant concentration, for viruses 104-106
TCID50/mL and for bacteria 106-108 CFU/mL. Additionally RSV and hMPV were tested for
interference when both organisms are in the same sample. For the intra test interference RSV B
was tested at 33,300x LoD, 333x LoD, 100x LoD, 30x LoD and 3x LoD. hMPV-B2 was tested
at 10,000x LoD, 100x LoD, 30x LoD, 3x LoD. The prepared samples were extracted and run on
both the Cepheid SmartCycler II and ABI 7500 Fast Dx.
There was no interference seen between any of the organisms tested, all tests were positive for
either RSV or hMPV. A decrease in Ct value was seen in the presence of Neisseria
gonorrhoeae, but sequence analysis showed no homology between the test probe sequence and
Neisseria gonorrhoeae sequence. At very high levels (at or above 1,000x LoD) RSV may
interfere with the detection of hMPV. However, during the clinical trial co-infection was found

and for bacteria 106-108 CFU/mL (the same titers as in the Interference table above). The
prepared samples were extracted and run on both the Cepheid SmartCycler II and ABI 7500 Fast
Dx.
There was no cross-reactivity seen between any of the organisms tested, all tests were negative
for both RSV or hMPV.
Inclusivity:
Each virus was diluted into negative clinical matrix at 1x-3x LoD. Samples were extracted and
tested in triplicate on either the ABI 7500 Fast Dx or Cepheid SmartCycler II. Virus was
detected in all positive samples in all but one virus strain, hMPV B1 Peru3. Only 2/3 samples
were positive during testing of hMPV B1 Peru 3. This result was probably due to a combination
of small differences in LoD among different genetic sub-lineage and titer variability near the
LoD. The study adequately shows that the assay can detect the two RSV subtypes and four
hMPV genetic sub-lineages.

The Quidel Molecular RSV + hMPV assay detected 100% of the RSV and hMPV on both the
ABI 7500 Fast Dx and Cepheid SmartCycler® II platforms.
f. Assay cut-off:
Threshold: The threshold for the ABI 7500 Fast Dx was established using the background
fluorescence from cycle 3-15. The threshold is set to above the background fluorescence, below
the plateau and linear regions of the amplification curve, within the exponential phase of the
amplification curve. The threshold is designed to maximize sensitivity and specificity. The
threshold settings for each analyte were determined individually using positive and negative
clinical specimens.
The threshold for the Cepheid SmartCycler II was established using the background subtraction
performed by the software algorithm and adjusting the threshold based on amplification curves
obtained from positive and negative clinical samples.
Assay cut-off: The Ct cut-off was determined after testing clinical specimens and choosing a Ct
value that was higher than the Ct value of the lowest positive concentration of analyte.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison was performed against the gold standard of culture for RSV testing and a
FDA cleared device for hMPV. The testing description and data are listed in the Clinical studies
section.
b. Matrix comparison:
A transport media study was conducted to show efficacy of 5 different transport media (UTM,
M4, M4-RT, M5 and M6). RSV and hMPV were spiked into the media at 3x LoD. Each
condition was extracted in triplicate, and each extraction was tested twice. There was not
statistical difference in Ct value among the media tested on either the ABI 7500 Fast Dx or the
Cepheid SmartCycler II.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
The clinical study for this device was performed during the 2012 respiratory virus season,
January – March, 2012. All 1014 nasal swab and nasopharyngeal swap specimens were
collected prospectively. One specimen per patient was collected at four US study sites. A total
414 samples where tested fresh and 600 were frozen and tested at a later date. Reference testing
for RSV was DSFA or culture with DFA, performed immediately after collection. A FDA
cleared hMPV molecular test was used as the hMPV comparator for the Quidel Molecular RSV
+ hMPV Assay.
The performance of the Quidel assay in detecting RSV and hMPV was acceptable. The Quidel
assay detected an additional 21 and 28 positive RSV samples not detected by DSFA and cell
culture with DFA respectively. This was confirmed by an FDA-cleared RT-PCR assay. The
detection of hMPV was equivalent to a FDA cleared hMPV molecular test. Discrepant samples
were not further tested for hMPV.
