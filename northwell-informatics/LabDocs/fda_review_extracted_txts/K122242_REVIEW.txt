b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
There is no international standard available for CA 15-3. The Elecsys CA 15-
3 II CalCheck 5 was initially standardized against the Elecsys CA 15-3 assay.
This in turn was standardized against CA 15-3 RIA by Fujirebio Diagnostics.
Value assignment:
For each Elecsys CA 15-3 II CalCheck 5 kit manufactured, value assignment
for each level was tested once a day on Modular Analytics E170 analyzers
(with two modules and two measuring cells) for a total of eight runs on two
days. The MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 master calibration curve was
used to calculate U/mL from counts. The assigned target value of each
CalCheck is the median of the observed values. The assigned range is ± 21%
of assigned value, in which 8% was allotted for between-analyzer platform
tolerance, 8% for stability tolerance and 5% for precision of the assay. The
representative summary data for the value assignment process for lot that used
in the submission on E170 are shown below:

Target Value Median Value Assigned Value Assigned
Level
[U/mL] [U/mL] [U/mL] Range
Check 1 2.0 1.65 ≤ 2.5 ≤2.5
Check 2 25 24.8 24.8 19.6 – 30.0
Check 3 150 159 159 126 – 192
Check 4 240 250 250 198 – 303
Check 5 300 306 306 242 – 370
For Elecsys 2010, the same value assignment procedure was performed. The
assigned values obtained on this analyzer were compared to those obtained on
the MODULAR ANALYTICS E170. The acceptance criterion for analyzer-
to-analyzer variability is less than 10%. The results showed that the values
assigned to the E170 (and cobas e 601, e 602) are valid for the Elecsys 2010
(and cobas e 411).
Stability:
Stability studies were performed on cobas e 411 in order to verify the stability
claims for the Elecsys CA 15-3 II CalCheck 5. Because these studies are not
analyzer-dependent, these results, in addition to real-time stability study
results, can be applied to the Elecsys 2010, MODULAR ANALYTICS E170,
cobas e 601 and cobas e 602.
Open vial (after reconstituted) stability:
The open-vial stability of Elecsys CA 15-3 II CalCheck 5 was performed by
testing the on-test and reference materials in duplicate. The on-test material
was reconstituted and stored for 5 hours at 25ºC (in an open vial). The
reference material was a freshly reconstituted set of CalChecks. The recovery
of test material was calculated as a percent of the reference value. The data
support the claimed stability – reconstituted Elecsys CA 15-3 II CalCheck 5 is
stable up to 4 hours at 20-25°C.
On-Board stability:
The CalCheck products are not stored on-board the analyzer. No on-board
stability claims are made.
Closed vial stability:
The accelerated stability study was performed to verify the stability claims for
the Elecsys CA 15-3 II CalCheck. The on-test material was stored lyophilized
at 35°C for 3 weeks. The reference material was a freshly reconstituted set of
CalChecks (stored at 4°C). After 3 weeks, the test and reference materials
were tested in duplicate. The recovery of test material was calculated as a
5

percent of the reference value.
In addition, the real time stability is on-going. The test material is stored at 2-
8°C. Sample at time-points 0, 10, 16, 19, 25, and 37 months will be tested in
duplicate and the recovery value will be calculated by comparing to the
unstressed reference value (stored at -20°C).
The results from the accelerated stability and on-going real time stability
support an initial shelf-life claim of 18 months when the Elecsys CA 15-3 II
CalCheck 5 is stored under normal storage conditions of 2-8°C.
d. Dilution Study:
A dilution study was performed to demonstrate that the values are within the
assay’s measuring range of 1.00 U/mL – 300 U/mL if CalCheck level 1 and 5
produce results that exceed the reportable measuring range of the assay, .
Check 1&2 and Check 4&5 were mixed in a 1:1 ratio and measured in
duplicates. Results are summarized in the following table and both CalCheck
dilution values are within the assay’s measuring range after dilution.
