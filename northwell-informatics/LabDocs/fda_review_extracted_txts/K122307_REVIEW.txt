b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using 3 lots of test strips, 5 meters, and 10 venous whole
blood samples with glucose levels ranging from 10-700 mg/dL, obtained by spiking
pooled venous blood with a glucose solution. Each glucose level was analyzed 5
times over 3 test strip lots. Linear regression analysis for each test strip lot compared
to the YSI resulted in:
y = 0.9898x + 1.282; R2 = 0.9988 for Test Strip Lot 1
y = 0.9996x + 2.998; R2 = 0.9983 for Test Strip Lot 2
y = 0.9979x – 1.936; R2 = 0.9986 for Test Strip Lot 3
The claimed range of measurement for this device is 20 to 600 mg/dL. Data from
bench studies and software verification studies were provided to demonstrate that if a
sample is less than 20 mg/dL, the result is flagged by the meter as LO. If a sample result
exceeds 600 mg/dL, the result is flagged by the meter as HI.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The Diavue Prudential Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to the NIST
SRM 917b reference material. The method comparison study was performed using
the candidate device and YSI as the reference method (see Section M.2.a.).
Control Stability:
Diavue Control Solutions Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 are available for use with this
test system. The control solutions are not provided with the meter. The sponsor
provided a protocol and acceptance criteria to verify the closed-vial stability (shelf
life) and open vial stability of the control solutions. The stability protocols and
acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable. The sponsor claims a
closed-vial (shelf life) of 24 months and open-vial stability of 3 months when stored
at 36-86°F (2-30° C).

Control Value Assignment:
Values for each level of Diavue control solution are assigned by repeat analysis using
25 Diavue glucose test strips from one lot and 25 Diavue Prudential glucose meters.
The mean, SD and CV are used to establish the ranges for each control solution level
which are provided on the test strip vial label.
Test Strip Stability:
The sponsor provided a protocol and acceptance criteria to verify the closed-vial
stability (shelf life) and open vial stability of the test strips. The stability protocols
and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor
claims a closed-vial (shelf life) of 24 months and open-vial stability of 6 months
when stored at 39-104°F (4-40° C) and between 10% to 85% relative humidity.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range is 20 to 600 mg/dL based on linearity studies above (section
M.1.b.).
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor tested substances for interference using 1 lot of test strips (4-7 test strips
per interferent level), 4 meters, and 2 levels of glucose (achieved by adjusting human
venous blood glucose levels to 70 mg/dL and 150 mg/dL). Samples were then spiked
with the following interfering substances. Each sample was analyzed 4 times. The
labeling states that elevated concentration of acetaminophen (> 6.25 mg/dL), ascorbic
acid (> 5 mg/dL), bilirubin (un-conjugated) (> 20 mg/dL), dopamine (> 1.25 mg/dL),
glutathione reduced (> 46 mg/dL), levo-dopa ( > 1.4 mg/dL), methyl-dopa ( > 1.25
mg/dL), tolazamide (> 12.5 mg/dL), uric acid (> 10 mg/dL), galactose (> 250 mg/dL),
mannose (> 250 mg/dL), triglycerides (> 3000 mg/dL), hemoglobin (> 100 mg/dL),
and pralidoxime iodine ( > 5 mg/dL) may affect test results. The following table lists

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger. Since the
whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip there are no special handling or
storage issues.
5. Calibration:
The meter is a non-coding meter, therefore no coding is required by the user.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor manufactures three levels of glucose control solution, Level 1, Level 2, and
Level 3 to be used with the DIAVUE Prudential Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
These DIAVUE Control Solutions must be purchased separately and are not provided
with the device kits. Instructions for how to purchase the control solution are provided in
the user manuals. To perform a control test the user is instructed to press the “M” button
when the test strip and blood symbol appears on the screen. The “ctl” symbol will then
appear on the display. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test
strip vial label. If the control values fall outside these ranges, the user is referred to the
user manual and customer support for problems and more information
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. The device is intended for single-patient use. Disinfection studies were performed on
the DIAVUE Prudential meter by outside commercial laboratory testing services to
determine the disinfection efficacy of the meter to the recommended cleaning and
disinfection protocol, and its effectiveness in preventing the spread of bloodborne
pathogens, particularly hepatitis B virus (HBV). Micro-Kill Disinfecting wipes (EPA
Reg. No: 59894-10-37549) were validated, demonstrating complete inactivation of live
virus for use with the meter. The sponsor also conducted robustness studies and
demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the
meter after 5,000 cleaning and disinfection cycles to simulate 5 years of use by lay-
users. Each robustness cycle tested consisted of one pre-clean wipe and one disinfecting
wipe.
2. The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated with 3 lots of test strips using 10
test strips at each of 6 concentration ranges of glucose (20-30, 50-80, 100-150, 200-250,
350-400, 550-600 mg/dL). The glucose samples were prepared from venous blood
samples at 5 hematocrit levels at approximately 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60%. Each of the
results were compared to the value obtained from the same plasma glucose concentration
obtained by YSI. The data vs. YSI was reviewed and was found to be acceptable to
support the claimed hct range of 20-60%.
3. The effect of altitude was evaluated at five whole blood samples with glucose
concentrations ranging from 60 to 568 mg/dL, testing at sea level to 15,000 feet (4500
meters) above sea level. Each glucose concentration was measured 4 times at each
altitude. The bias was calculated relative to YSI at sea level up to 15,000 feet. The
13

--- Page 14 ---
results demonstrate that the system meets the acceptance criteria for testing at altitudes
up to 11,500 feet (3,500 meters) above sea level.
4. The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies at the combined extremes of
10°C/RH: 10%, 40°C/RH: 10%, 10°C/RH: 85%, and 40°C/RH: 85%, with venous blood
samples (66-300 mg/dL) that demonstrated that the DIAVUE Prudential meter can be
used at temperatures of 50 to 104°F (10 to 40°C) and 10% to 85% relative humidity.
5. Insufficient sample studies were performed at volumes of 0.4 to 1.5µL on five meters
and one test strip lot. Three glucose concentrations were tested ranging from
approximately 40-330 mg/dL, as determined by the YSI. Appropriate sample volume
was determined if the meter testing could start properly and if the meter results matched
the YSI results. A blood volume ≥ 0.7 µL, the stated minimum sample volume
requirement, met the criteria.
6. The sponsor provided a readability study and obtained Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level
Scores of 7.3 for the test strip insert, 7.2 for the the DIAVUE Prudential User’s Manual,
and 7.2 for the control solution package insert.
7. The sponsor stated that they conformed to the following guidelines and provided the
appropriate documentation to demonstrate compliance:
· IEC/EN 61010-1: General Requirements Part 1. Safety requirements for electrical
equipment for measurement, control, and laboratory use, 2001.
· IEC/EN 61010-2-101: Particular Requiremnents for in vitro diagnostic medical
equipment, 2002
· EMC testing was evaluated and certified by SGS Taiwain Ltd. and a letter of
attestation was issued to BioCare Corporation.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
