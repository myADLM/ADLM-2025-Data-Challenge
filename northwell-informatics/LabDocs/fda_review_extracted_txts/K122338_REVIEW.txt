L. Test Principle:
The Preferred Blood Glucose Monitoring System uses an electrochemical method. It is
based on the quantitative measurement of glucose in whole blood using amperometric
method, which detects the current produced from glucose oxidation. Glucose in the sample
mixes with specific chemicals on the test strip producing a small amount of electrical current.
The meter measures the current and displays the corresponding blood glucose level in the
sample. The strength of the current produced by the reaction depends on the amount of
glucose in the blood sample.

d. Detection limit:
The reportable range is 20 to 600 mg/dL based on the linearity/assay reportable range
study above (section M.1.b).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference study was designed according to CLSI EP7-A2 guideline.
Twenty four potential endogenous and exogenous interfering substances were
evaluated by spiking lithium heparin anti-coagulated venous whole blood with three
levels of glucose concentrations within the ranges 50 – 100, 200 - 275 and 400 -500
mg/dL (measured by YSI). The blood samples were spiked with the potentially
interfering compounds and tested on five meters using three test strip lots. Several
concentrations of the interfering substances were tested. The interferent
concentrations tested in this study were higher than the therapeutic and toxic levels.
Bias was calculated as the individual percent difference in glucose reading between
the test (individual measurements) and control (mean value) concentration groups.
Significant interference is defined by the sponsor as a bias ≥ ±10 % of the test
samples from the control group.
The sponsor claims no significant interference (< 10% difference) for the substances
and concentrations shown in the table below for both the devices:

Lay User Performance Study:
Lay user studies for fingerstick, palm, forearm, upper arm, calf and thigh were
performed by 150 lay users and healthcare professional using fresh capillary blood
samples. Labeling was provided only in English and users followed it to perform the
testing. The lay user first performed the testing followed by the healthcare
professional of the finger, palm, forearm, upper arm, calf and thigh. Then,
immediately after the above tests were completed (within 5 minutes), venous whole
blood samples were collected in EDTA tubes, plasma was separated, and tested on
YSI. The samples were tested using two meters and one lot of test strips (out of 3 lots
in use alternatively). All results were compared to the YSI. The studies met ISO
15197:2003 accuracy criteria, e.g. 95% of glucose results < 75 mg/dL were within ±

Yes _____X___ or No _______
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, the
palm, the forearm, the upperarm, the thigh and the calf. The whole blood sample is
applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.
5. Calibration:
The Prodigy Preferred Blood Glucose meter does not require coding.
6. Quality Control:
Glucose control solutions at two concentration levels can be run with this device. The
meter has to be set in control solution test mode to prevent control results from being
stored in the internal memory as patient result. Recommendations on when to test the
control materials are provided in the labeling. The control solution readings are not
included in the average of the patient results. An acceptable range for each control level
is printed on the control solutions vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if
the control result falls outside these ranges. Low level control solution is provided with
the complete kit. The meter only kit label states that control solutions are not included,
and must be purchased separately.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. A usability study was performed to assess the readability of the labeling by recruiting 150 lay
users (aged 25-75 yrs old) who were provided with the test kit containing labeling in English
for the US market. Participants varied in age, education, country of origin, and both men (n
11

--- Page 12 ---
= 110) and women (n = 40) were included in the study. These lay users also completed a
questionnaire to indicate whether the device is easy to use and the Instructions for use were
written in a way that makes it easy to use. The majority of the users responded that the
device is very easy to use.
2. Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the results showed that the
labeling (User Guide, test strip package insert, quick reference guide and control solution
package insert) were written at grade levels ranging from 7.0th to 8.0th grade.
3. Customer service is available 24 hours, 7 days a week. The telephone number is 1-800-
243-2636 for customer support.
4. The effect of different hematocrit levels on the accuracy of the Prodigy Blood Glucose
Monitoring System was evaluated using ten meters in duplicates using two lots of test
strips. Blood samples (anticoagulant lithium heparin) at six hematocrit levels from 20%
to 60% (15, 20, 30, 40, 60 and 65%) were evaluated in five concentrations of glucose of
approximately 42.8, 77.5, 127, 200 and 317 mg/dL (measured by YSI). Individual
glucose measurements were compared to the reference method (YSI) and 40% HCT. The
sponsor calculated individual %bias vs. YSI and 40% HCT. Results demonstrated that
hematocrit levels between 20 to 60% do not significantly interfere with glucose
measurements.
5. Minimum sample volume study was provided by testing a range of volumes between 0.5
to 1.5 µL (0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2 and 1.5 µL) of heparinized venous blood samples (at
five glucose concentration levels – 40, 77, 112, 177 and 336 mg/dL, measured by YSI)
using eight meters and two lots of test strips. Individual glucose measurements were
compared to the reference method (YSI), and percent bias were calculated. Results
demonstrated that the Prodigy Meter and Prodigy No Code Test Strips require a
minimum sample volume of 0.7 µL for obtaining accurate results.
5. Temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated for temperatures ranging
from 50oF to 104oF (10oC to 40oC) and relative humidity between 10 to 85% R.H. using
three glucose concentration levels of heparinized venous blood (49, 150 and 320 mg/dL,
measured by YSI), seven meters and three lots of test stips. Individual glucose
measurements were compared to the reference method (YSI), and percent bias were
calculated. Results demonstrated that glucose measurements on the Preferred BGMS
were not affected at temperatures ranging from 50oF to 104oF (10oC to 40oC) and relative
humidity between 10 to 85% R.H.
6. The effect of altitude on the accuracy of the device was evaluated on the Prodigy
Preferred Blood Glucose Monitoring System with three meters and three test strip lots. A
range of altitudes (298, 2920, 4790, 6234, 8536 and 11161 feet) was tested using
heparinized venous blood samples (at five glucose concentration levels – 49, 120, 152,
253 and 400 mg/dL, measured by YSI). Individual glucose measurements were
compared to the reference method (YSI), and percent bias were calculated. Results
demonstrated that glucose measurements on the Preferred BGMS were not affected up to
an altitude of 11,161 feet (3,402 meters).

7. The Preferred Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for home use by single
person. Disinfection studies were performed on the Preferred meter to determine the
robustness of the meter to the recommended cleaning and disinfection protocol, and its
effectiveness in preventing the spread of bloodborne pathogens, particularly hepatitis B
virus (HBV). Dispatch® Hospital Cleaner Disinfectant Towel with Bleach (EPA Reg.
No. 56392-8) was validated, demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus for use
with the Preferred meter. The sponsor demonstrated that there was no change in
performance or in the external materials of the Preferred meter after 5000 cleaning and
disinfection cycles to simulate an estimated 31 cleaning and disinfection cycles per week
over three years of use at home by a single person,. Labeling has been reviewed for
adequate instructions on the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
8. EMC testing was evaluated and certified by AUDIX Technology Corporation and a
certificate of conformity was issued to Prodigy Diabetes Care LLC on December 25,
2012.
