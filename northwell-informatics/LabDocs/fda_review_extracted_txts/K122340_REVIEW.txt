e. Analytical specificity:
Interference
An interference study was performed to evaluate the effects of endogenous and
exogenous substances on the glucose test results generated by the Prodigy Choice
Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Venous blood samples were collected into
Lithium heparin tubes. Three glucose levels were achieved (50-100, 200-275, and
400-500 mg/dL) by adding a dextrose solution to the blood pool. Potential
interferents were aliquotted into samples. The control pool (without an interfering
compound) and test pool were measured by YSI and then on five meters using three
test strip lots for each glucose concentration. The results are summarized below to
show the highest concentration without significant interference (defined by the
sponsor as ±10% bias).

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
System Accuracy
To assess system accuracy, results from the Prodigy Choice Blood Glucose
Monitoring System were compared to a reference method, YSI. Finger, palm,
forearm, upper-arm, calf, and thigh capillary samples were collected by
healthcare professionals from 100 participants with unaltered glucose
concentrations ranging from 53.4 – 394 mg/dL (according to reference) were
tested using three test strip lots. To obtain blood glucose concentrations <50
mg/dL and > 400 mg/dL, samples were allowed to glycolize or were spiked to
achieve the desired glucose concentration. Ten samples were altered (5
glycolyzed, 5 spiked). The results relative to YSI are summarized in the
tables below:

User Performance Study
To assess the performance of the Prodigy Choice Blood Glucose Monitoring System
in the hands of the lay-users the sponsor performed a study with 151 lay-user
participants, who collected 151 each of finger, palm, forearm, upper-arm, calf, and
thigh capillary samples using only English-written labeling materials with no other
instructions or coaching. Results from 3 test strip lots and 300 meters were analyzed
by comparing blood glucose results from the Prodigy Choice meter obtained by the
lay-user against the YSI reference value. The glucose concentration of the samples
ranged from 50.3 to 355 mg/dL as measured by YSI. The results are summarized
below.
The data obtained in the lay user study were not as accurate as meters on the market.
Therefore the sponsor added the following caution to the test strip insert, meter
manual, and the meter kit box:

CAUTION
Blood Glucose Meter Accuracy is the most important criteria in determining
glucose meter quality. The Prodigy Choice® Blood Glucose Monitoring System
is less accurate than most other blood glucose meters sold today. The Prodigy
Choice® meter does not provide reliable accuracy readings beyond the following
margins of error:
For glucose concentrations < 75 mg/dL, 95% of the results shall be within ± 15
mg/dL.
For glucose concentrations > 75 mg/dL, 95% of the results shall be within ± 20%.
DO NOT USE THE PRODIGY CHOICE® TO CALCULATE INSULIN
DOSAGES.
DO NOT USE THE PRODIGY CHOICE® TO CALIBRATE CONTINUOUS
GLUCOSE MONITORS

meter as a kit. The user has to change the setting on the meter to control so that the
result is not saved.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study: The effect of different hematocrit levels on the performance of the
Prodigy Choice Blood Glucose System was evaluated using venous whole blood
samples with hematocrit levels 15, 20, 30, 40, 60 and 65 %,, and spiked or glycolyzed
to achieve 6 glucose concentrations ranging from 50 to 500 mg/dL (30-50, 51-110,
111-150, 151-250, 251-400 mg/dL). Each sample was then tested 20 times using 10
Prodigy Choice meters and two lots of test strips. The meter values were compared
with those obtained from average YSI analyzer values at the tested hematocrit level
and normal hematocrit (40%). The percent biases relative to YSI were acceptable
within the claimed hematocrit range of 20 to 60%.
2. Altitude study: Venous whole blood samples collected and adjusted to obtain 5
glucose concentrations of 30-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-250, and 251-400 mg/dL were
tested at 298, 2,920, 4,790, 6,234, 8,563, and 11,161 feet above sea level. The study
included 3 meters and 3 test strip lots. Results were compared to YSI values. The
results demonstrate acceptable bias and indicate acceptable performance to the claimed
altitude of 11,161 ft. The sponsor has claimed an altitude of 10,742 feet in their
labeling.
3. Temperature and Humidity studies: The sponsor performed temperature and humidity
studies using venous blood samples with glucose concentrations of 30-50, 96-144, and
280-420 mg/dL to evaluate temperatures ranging from 10 to 40oC (50 to 104 ºF) and
relative humidity from 10% to 85%. Meter results were compared to YSI values.
Four temperature and humidity combinations were tested including low
temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity, high temperature/low
humidity, and high temperature/high humidity. No significant bias (relative to YSI)
was observed with the temperature and humidity combinations tested. The results
support a temperature claim of 10 to 40oC (50 to 104 ºF) with relative humidity of 10
to 85%.
4. Sample Volume: The sponsor performed a study to verify the test strip minimum
sample volume requirement (0.7 µL) and the test strip fill error requirement
established for the Prodigy Choice Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Blood samples
with glucose concentrations of 30-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-250, and 251-400 mg/dL
were tested at seven sample volumes (0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.5 µL) and values
obtained were compared to YSI values. Results support the claimed minimum sample
volume of 0.7 mL.
5. Readability Evaluation: SMOG readability assessment was conducted and the results
demonstrated that the User Manual and test strip package insert were written at the 8th
grade level and below.
17

--- Page 18 ---
6. Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing was performed by Audix Technology
Corporation., Taipei Hsien, Taiwan. Verification of Compliance certificates were
provided.. The results are for the Prodigy Preferred Meter, model Prodigy-C which is
identical to the Prodigy Choice. The only difference is the location of the strip
connector touch pin on the test strip.
7. Infection Control Studies: The meter is intended for single-patient use only. The
Dispatch Hospital Cleaner Disinfection Towel with Bleach (EPA registration #56392-
8) was used to validate disinfection efficacy using the PMA approved (P030049) HBV
antigen assay demonstrating the absence of HBV antigen on meter surface coupons.
8. Robustness: The sponsor demonstrated that there was no change in performance
(compared to YSI) or in the external materials of the meter after 10,950 cleaning and
disinfection cycles (one cycle includes one cleaning wipe plus one disinfecting wipe).
Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and
disinfection procedures.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
