For use with the VITEK® 2 and VITEK® 2 Compact Systems
I. Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is essentially a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated
version of the doubling dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC). Each VITEK 2 AST card contains 64 wells. A control well
which only contains microbiological culture media is resident on all cards. The
remaining wells contain premeasured portions of a specific antibiotic combined with
culture media. The bacterial or yeast isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized
concentration with 0.45 – 0.5% saline before being used to rehydrate the
antimicrobial medium within the card. The VITEK 2 System automatically fills, seals
and places the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual
filling, sealing and loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of
each well in the card over a defined period of time. At the completion of the
incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the
interpretive category result for each antibiotic contained on the card.
The VITEK® 2 Streptococcus Ceftriaxone has the following concentrations in the
card: 0.125, 0.25, 1, and 4 µg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by
efficacy in μg/mL). The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 card is ≤ 0.125 – ≥ 8
μg/mL.
The MIC ranges, interpretive criteria and equivalent concentrations are as follows:

L. Test Principle:
Automated growth based detection using attenuation of light measured by an optical
scanner. The optics used in the systems use visible light to directly measure organism
growth. Transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before
significant growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same
well measure organism growth by how much light is prevented from going through
the well. The VITEK 2 System monitors the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period of time. An interpretive call is made between 4 and 16 hours for a
“rapid” read but may be extended to 18 hours in some instances. At the completion of
the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the
interpretive category result for each antibiotic on the card.
The VITEK® 2 Streptococcus Ceftriaxone has the following concentrations in the
card: 0.125, 0.25, 1, and 4 µg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by
efficacy in μg/mL). The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 card is ≤ 0.125 - ≥ 8
μg/mL.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three external clinical sites.
Eight isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and one isolate each of
Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus anginosus were tested at each site and
testing was performed in triplicate over three days with the VITEK® 2
Streptococcus Ceftriaxone card resulting in a total of 270 test results. The
testing was performed using both the manual dilution method and the
automated dilution method. Testing was conducted on the VITEK 2

--- Page 6 ---
instrument.
For reproducibility calculations, off-scale values are handled in two ways;
“best case” and “worst case” scenarios. Best case calculation for
reproducibility assumes the off-scale result is within one well from the mode
MIC value. Worst case calculation for reproducibility assuming the off-scale
result is greater than one well from the mode MIC value. All isolates tested by
VITEK 2 gave on-scale MIC values but a few results were off-scale for
isolates tested by the VITEK 2 Compact.
The overall reproducibility was >95% with +/- one dilution observation for
the VITEK 2 and the VITEK 2 Compact system. Only Manual Dilution
testing was conducted since the VITEK 2 Compact system does not have a
functionality to support automatic dilution to inoculate the card. Results were
as follows:
VITEK System Inoculation Method Best Case Worst Case
VITEK 2 AutoDilution 100% 100%
Manual 100% 100%
VITEK 2 Compact Manual 99.3% 99.3%
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended Streptococcus pneumonia QC organism was tested on
every test occasion with the reference method and the VITEK 2 System.
The reference method QC results were in range for every day tested. The
VITEK 2 was tested a sufficient number of times to demonstrate that the
system can produce QC results in the recommended range.
Quality Control was performed during the studies using both the Auto-dilution
and the manual method of diluting the organisms on the VITEK 2 System.
Results demonstrated that methods were comparable.

options of the VITEK 2.
A similar QC study was conducted to evaluate the VITEK 2 Compact System.
Results were within the expected QC ranges.
Quality Control results for the VITEK 2 System using either inoculation
dilution method demonstrated that the VITEK 2 System could produce the
expected quality control results.
Inoculum density control was monitored using the DensiChek2 instrument.
This was standardized weekly with all results recorded and in the expected
range.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Performance was established through a clinical study which was conducted at
four external study sites. A total of 1425 clinical isolates were tested by
VITEK® 2 Ceftriaxone with the VITEK® 2 System. The majority of the
isolates were recently recovered from clinical specimens. Four hundred fifty-
nine of the 1425 clinical isolates tested were stock isolates (32.2%). Nine of
the isolates failed to grow in the VITEK card giving a no growth rate of 0.6%
(9/1425). Therefore, the total number of viable clinical isolates evaluated was
1416.
A total of 301 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae were tested and
the performance data was analyzed using the meningitis and non-meningitis
breakpoints for Ceftriaxone. None of the isolates failed to grow in the VITEK
2 AST card. One hundred fifty one of the 301 clinical isolates tested were
stock isolates (50.2%).
A challenge study was conducted using a set consisting of 200 Streptococcus
species isolates (50 isolates each of S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes,
and viridans group streptococci). S. pneumoniae data was analyzed using the
meningitis and non-meningitis breakpoints. The challenge set was tested with
both of the VITEK® 2 System card inoculation options, automatic dilution and
manual dilution.
Testing of clinical isolates was performed using the automated method of
inoculation and the challenge organisms were tested with both the manual
dilution and automatic dilution. Each isolate was tested by the VITEK 2
Streptococcus Ceftriaxone and the CLSI broth microdilution reference
method. The inoculum was prepared with direct colony suspension. A
comparison was provided to the reference method with the agreement shown
in the following tables.
There are different sets of breakpoints for Streptococcus spp in the FDA drug
label for Ceftriaxone. The viridans group streptococci and S. pneumoniae
(non-meningitis) data was analyzed using the same set of FDA breakpoints
[≤1 (S), 2 (I), ≥4 (R)]. In addition, S. pneumoniae data was analyzed using the
FDA breakpoints for meningitis [≤0.5 (S), 1 (I), ≥2 (R)].
The data was analyzed separately for the beta hemolytic streptococci because
the breakpoint is different and there is a susceptible only category (S ≤0.5
µg/mL). A summary of the data is shown in the tables that follow.
