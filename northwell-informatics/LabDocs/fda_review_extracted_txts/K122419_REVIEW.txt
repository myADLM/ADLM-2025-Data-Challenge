The test configuration comes with single drug screening test or any combinations of
multiple drug screening tests. The test is intended for over-the-counter (OTC) users as the
first step in a two step process to provide consumers, with information concerning the
presence or absence of the above stated drugs or their metabolites in a urine sample.
Information regarding confirmatory testing – the second step in the process, along with the
materials for shipping the urine specimen to the laboratory, is provided. The test is also
intended for health care professional users.
The tests will yield preliminary positive results when the prescription drugs Barbiturates,
Benzodiazepines, Oxycodone, Tricyclic Antidepressants are ingested, even at or above
therapeutic doses. There are no uniformly recognized drug levels for Barbiturate,
Benzodiazepines, Oxycodone, Tricyclic Antidepressant in urine. The tests provide only
preliminary data, which should be confirmed by other methods such as
gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Clinical considerations and professional
judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test results, particularly when preliminary
positive results are indicated. The tests are not intended to be used in monitoring drug levels.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For over-the-counter use and prescription use by health care professional users
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable, as the device is a visually-read single use device.
I. Device Description:
The UCP Home Drug Screening Test Cups is capable of measuring 12 drugs listed in the
intended use at a time. The UCP Home Drug Screening Test Cups can contain up to five strips
that are capable of measuring up to three drugs per strip. The test includes user instructions,
collection cups, transportation bag with absorbent pad, mailing box and identification labels
with personal identification number to be used when sending positive urine specimens to the
laboratory for confirmation.

technology based on the principle of competitive binding. Drugs, if present in concentrations
below the cutoff level, will not saturate the binding sites of antibody coated particles in the
device. The antibody-coated particles will then be captured by immobilized drug-specific
conjugate and a colored line will appear in the test line region. The colored line will not form
if the sample contains drug in excess of the cutoff level because the drug will saturate all the
binding sites of the drug-specific antibody. Each strip in the device contains
a procedural control that appears in the control line region indicating that the sample has
migrated properly on the test strip.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed using drug-free urine spiked to the following
concentrations: negative (0%), 50% below the cutoff, 25% below the cutoff,
25% above the cutoff, 50% above the cutoff for each analyte and each device.
Sample concentrations were confirmed by GC/MS. The samples were aliquots,
coded, randomized and blinded. Each specimen, at each concentration analyte,
was tested by total sixty (60) test devices from three different lots by three operators
within 10 to 20 non-consecutive days. The results are displayed in the tables below:

process controls. A colored line appearing in the control region reflects that sufficient sample
volume was applied and that adequate membrane wicking occurred. Users are informed that the
test is invalid if a line fails to appear in the control region. For professional users, the sponsor
states in the labeling when external QC materials should be tested.
Stability
Accelerated and real time stability studies have been conducted. Stability protocols and
acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable. The information supports that UCP
Home Drug Screening Test Cups unopened stability is 18 months.
Real time stability testing is ongoing.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical performance of the device around the cutoff is described in Section f.
(Assay cut- off) below.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was established by spiking similarly structured compounds into drug free
urine at various concentrations. These solutions were tested using 3 lots of the UCP Home
Drug Screening Test Cups. Results are expressed as a minimum concentration of metabolite
or compound required to produce a response approximately equivalent to the cutoff
concentration of the assay. The percent cross-reactivity of those compounds is presented
below. This information is also provided in the labeling of the device.

Structurally un-related and interference:
The following unrelated compounds were found not to cross-react with UCP Home Drug
Screening Test Cups when tested spiked (100 mg/mL) into drug free urine or urine spiked
with each drug at ±50%, ± 25% of the cut-off values:
Acetaminophen, Acetylsalicylic Acid, Amikacin, Ampicillin, Arterenal, Aspirin, Atropine,
Benzoic Acid, Oxalic Acid, Caffeine, Methanol, Ethanol, Lidocaine, Thioridazine,
Trifluoperazine, Penicillin-G, Phenylpropanalamine, Ranitidine, Salicyclic Acid, Albumin,
Bilirubin, Creatinine, Hemoglobin, Glucose,Vitamin C (L-Ascorbic Acid), and Uric Acid
Evaluation of Specific Gravity and pH on the test results:
To evaluate the effect of pH value on the test results, negative urine samples were adjusted
to pH levels 4.5, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, and 9.0. The samples were then spiked with each drug at
±50%, ± 25% of the cut-off values. Testing was performed on 3 lots of UCP Home Drug
Screening Test Cups.
To evaluate the effect of specific gravity, the urine samples having specific gravities of
1.005, 1.01, 1.02, 1.025, and 1.030, 1.032, and 1.035 were spiked with each drug at ±50%,
± 25% of the cut-off values. Testing was performed on 3 lots of UCP Home Drug Screening
Test Cups.
The testing results demonstrate that varying pHs and specific gravities do not affect urine
testing results around each analyte cut-off.
f. Assay cut-off:
Cutoff studies were performed by validating the test performance around the claimed cutoff
concentration of each test. The targeted drugs were spiked into human urine known to be
drug- free in each test to the following concentrations: 0, +/-50% of the cutoff,
+/-25% of the cutoff.
The concentrations of each drug were confirmed by GC/MS. To determine the analytical
sensitivity, 20 replicates at each concentration of each drug were run by 3 operators with
total 60 replicates from three lots. The results were summarized below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison for UCP Home Drug Screening Test Cups was performed in-
house with total 120 (60 negative and 60 positive) unaltered clinical samples by three
operators, two operators have relevant experience, one operator has no experience other
than reading the instructions for use. The samples were blinded and device results were
compared to GC/MS results. The results are presented in the table below:

b. Lay user study:
A lay user study was conducted in three locations with 115 lay persons. Fifty-eight
females and fifty-seven males from ages of 18 to 77 years of age, with a range of
educational backgrounds participated in the study. None of the participants had
experience with a point of care drug testing product.
Quality control samples for test cups were prepared to contain a strong negative (0
% of the cutoff), a very weak negative (-50% of cutoff), a weak negative (-25% of
cutoff), a weak positive (+25% of cutoff), a strong positive (+50% of cutoff) and a
very strong positive (+300% of the cutoff) of each drug. Pure drug or metabolite
was spiked into drug free human urine. All specimens (except TCA samples) were
verified by GC/MS. TCA samples were verified by HPLC. There were 456
observations. The results are summarized below:

A Flesh-Kincaid reading analysis was performed on package inserts and the score
revealed a reading grade level of 7.
Each participant was given a pre and post-study questionnaire. The pre-study
questionnaire collected personal information about each participant. The post-study
questionnaire was used to determine if the lay users understood the test instruction and
the meaning of the results. Consumers were asked questions about the test, control line,
prescription drug and food interference and confirmation of results. The results from the
post-questionnaire were acceptable as nearly all of the participants answered the
questions correctly (99.1%).
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable. The assay is intended for urine samples.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Not applicable.
