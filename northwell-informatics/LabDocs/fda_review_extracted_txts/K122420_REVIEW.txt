L. Test Principle:
Assay is based on the competition (for a 25-OH Vitamin D antibody) between a 25-OH
Vitamin D conjugate coated on a microplate and the 25-OH Vitamin D content of a serum
sample. Following kit instructions, Vitamin D is extracted using reagent EX and deep-well
pre-dilution strips. The extracted Vitamin D samples are transferred to the coated microplate.
Reagent R1 containing the 25-OH Vitamin d antibody is added to the microplate. After an
incubation and a wash step, R2 containing the HRP-labeled secondary antibody is added to
the microplate. Next is a second incubation followed by the addition of R3 containing the
TMB substrate. After a final incubation the reaction is stopped using the STOP solution and
the colorimetric signal is read. The 25-OH Vitamin D concentration of a patient sample is
inversely proportional to the measured absorbance at 450 nm. Assay time is 2 hours.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Performance was tested using a Dynex automated microplate reader.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed precision studies in accordance with the CLSI EP5-A2
guideline. Over 20 days, 10 precision levels including 2 serum based control samples
(26.0 ng/mL and 52.3 ng/mL vitamin D) and 8 serum samples from 10.5 ng/mL to
116.2 ng/mL vitamin D were measured daily. Each sample was run in replicates of 2
per run, 2 runs per day for a total of 80 results per sample. Precision results are
summarized in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The claimed linearity range of this device is 8.3 ng/mL to 143.6 ng/mL.
The sponsor performed a linearity study in accordance with the CLSI EP6-A
guideline using one lot of calibrator and one lot of reagent. Eleven levels of serum
based samples (5.0, 12.03, 19.06, 33.12, 47.18, 61.24, 75.3, 89.36, 103.42, 117.48,
145.6 ng/mL) were prepared by diluting a high serum sample containing 145.6 ng/mL
of 25-OH Vitamin D. Samples were measured in triplicate. The assay was linear
between 6.7 ng/mL and 143.6 ng/mL. The results between the expected concentrations
and the measured concentrations yielded a linear regression of y=1.005x + 1.1674.
Based on the results of the LoQ and linearity studies, the sponsor’s claimed measuring
range is 8.3 ng/mL to 143.6 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The master calibrator batch stock was prepared in house gravimetrically in DMSO. The
alue assignment of the stock is made by UV absorbance spectrometry calibrated with
NIST SRM 935a, based on NIST recommended molar extinction coefficients. The
DMSO stock of 25-OH Vitamin D3 was used to make calibration levels by dilution into
pooled human serum.
Value assignments
Normal (higher than 30 ng/mL) and Abnormal (lower than 29.9 ng/mL) 25-OH
Vitamin D controls prepared in human serum were tested with released Diazyme 25-
OH Vitamin D kits in 120 replicates, obtained from 5 independent runs, on 2
automatic analyzers. The obtained mean values were assigned as control target
values. The controls target ranges were assigned as mean ± 25% (ng/mL).
Calibrator value assignments are based on an internal procedure. The initial value

assignment for calibrators was performed using the predicate assay. Subsequent
patient samples were tested against the predicate assay and the final calibrator values
were adjusted and verified.
Stability
Stability study was based on accelerated study and real-time stability study is on-
going. Stability study protocol and acceptance criteria has been provided and found
to be adequate. The kit is stable until the expiration date if stored at 2-8 °C.
Calibrators, controls, and the 25-D Biotin solution are stable for 8 weeks at 2-8 °C. If
opened, the unused antibody coated microplate is stable for 8 weeks at 2-8 °C only if
returned to the foil pouch and sealed. The 20X wash solution is stable at room
temperature for 8 weeks and the 1X working wash solution is stable at room
temperature for 4 weeks.
d. Detection limit:
A detection limits study was performed by the sponsor based on the CLSI EP17-A
guideline. To determine the LoB, serum containing undetectable levels of 25-OH
Vitamin D from a commercial source was assayed in three independent runs with 20
replicates per run (N=60). The LoB was calculated as the mean 57th and 58th highest
values for the blanks. LoB is determined to be 3.0 ng/mL
To determine the LoD five low Vitamin D serum samples were measured in three
independent runs, with four replicates per run (N=60). The LoD is defined as LoD =
LoB + (1.645 * STDEV of Low samples). LoD is determined to be 5.6 ng/mL.
The LoQ was measured using five samples (6.7, 12.4, 18.3, 22.3, 28.8 ng/mL). Each
sample was assayed in 40 replicates obtained in five independent runs. LoQ is defined
as the lowest concentration for which %CV is <20%. A curve fit was used to obtain
an estimate of %CV as a function of mean. LoQ was determined to be 8.3 ng/mL.
The sponsor’s claimed measuring range is 8.3 to 143.4 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference study:
An interference study was performed by the sponsor to evaluate different potential
interference substances. Two unaltered serum samples (one deficient and one
normal) were used for the testing. One aliquot of the samples were spiked with 5
concentrations of potential interfering substances and an aliquot of unspiked samples
were used as a control. All samples were tested in duplicates. The sponsor defined
non-significant interference as within ± 10% difference between the spiked and
unspiked samples.

The sponsor states the following in their labeling: “Do not use hemolysed samples.”
Cross-reactivity study:
To test for cross-reactivity with potential cross-reactants, six identical serum aliquots
(10 mL) were each spiked with one of the cross-reactant listed below. Cross-reactants
stock solutions were made with 100% DMSO. A seventh serum aliquot of 10 mL was
spiked with 100% DMSO (devoid of Vitamin D) and served as a negative control. All
7 spiked sera were then quantified in quadruplicates. % Cross-reactivity was
calculated using the following the equation:
% Cross-reactivity = spiked sample – unspiked sample x 100

The sponsor performed a matrix comparison study using 66 matched sets of serum
(ng/mL), Li-heparin (ng/mL), and K -EDTA (ng/mL) to evaluate the effect of the
3
anticoagulants on the Diazyme 25-OH Vitamin D EIA kit results. The reported values
for each sample and for each matrix were obtained from single measurements. The
total number of matched sets tested was 66. Seven spiked patient samples were
included in the study to cover the hard-to-find samples range. The linear regression
results yielded the following comparisons results for each matrix.
· Li-Heparin vs. Serum: y= 0.993x + 1.855 (sample range tested was 10.9 to 130.2
ng/dL) and r2 = 0.961.
· K - EDTA vs. Serum: y= 1.006x + 2.901 (sample range tested was 8.3 to 119.5

The sponsor demonstrated lithium heparin plasma and K3 EDTA plasma are
acceptable anticoagulants to be used with their assay.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
To determine a reference range for the Diazyme 25-OH Vitamin D EIA, the 25-OH
Vitamin D serum concentrations of a U.S. population of 157 apparently healthy
individuals (age between 21 and 80 years old), were measured with the Diazyme method.
These samples were collected from three different geographical locations, with 47
samples collected from Pennsylvania (Northern U.S.), 56 samples collected from
Tennessee (Central US) and 54 samples collected from Texas (Southern US). The study
population consisted of 72 light skin individuals (46%) and 85 dark skin individuals
(54%). There was no family history of parathyroid or calcium regulatory disease. There
was no participant history of kidney disease, GI disease, liver disease, calcium-levels
related disease, thyroid disease, parathyroid disease, calcium related disease, seizures,

affect absorption or catabolism of Vitamin D. All serum samples were collected during
the fall season (October 2010-November 2010).
The following results were obtained:
Lowest 25-OH Vitamin D concentration: 8.4 ng/mL
Highest 25-OH Vitamin D concentration: 61.3 ng/mL
