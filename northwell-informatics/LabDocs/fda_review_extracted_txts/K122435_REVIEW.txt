L. Test Principle:
The Nova One Glucose Monitor measures glucose electrochemically. The glucose
biosensor is capable of recognizing the glucose present in whole blood or control
solutions by virtue of the glucose specificity of the enzyme glucose dehydrogenase
(GDH) present on the glucose test strip. The electrons liberated by this reaction are
transferred via a co-factor and mediator (FAD) to the meter where they are read as a
small electrical current. The current is integrated over the analysis time to generate
charge which is directly proportional to the level of the glucose in the applied sample.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with reference method (YSI):
The system accuracy on finger stick samples was evaluated in the predicate
k112638.
To evaluate system accuracy on venous and arterial samples, healthcare professionals
tested three lots of Nova One test strips on a total of 160 venous and arterial samples
collected in Lithium Heparin tubes. Among the samples tested, 10 of the 29 arterial
samples and 6 of 23 venous samples were spiked to ensure adequate coverage of the
high reportable range.
The distribution of the sample glucose concentrations is specified in the table

b. Matrix comparison:
Venous blood samples (N=60) is drawn into Sodium Heparin tubes. Each
sample was measured in singlet using 2 Nova One monitors and 3 lots of
strips. To obtain samples in the extreme low and high glucose concentration
range, 5 native samples were subjected to glycolysis to obtain low glucose
results and 5 samples were spiked to obtain high glucose results. The
reference glucose concentration was determined using the YSI method. The
results are summarized below.

device using wireless transmission?
Yes __________ or No __ X __
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this line of product types:
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied
directly to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger
and forearm, as well as venous and arterial whole blood collected in sodium or
lithium heparin tubes. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip
by capillary action.
5. Calibration:
Calibration is performed by the manufacturer and does not need to be performed by
the end user. The meter does not require coding.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor has three levels of control solutions (level 2 control solution is included
with the kit). When a test strip is inserted into the meter, each control can be
measured by following the instructions for “Running Control Solution” provided in
the user’s manual. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test
strip vial label. If the test results fall outside the range printed on the test strip vial,
the user is instructed to contact Customer Service (available 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week).
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In

EMC testing was evaluated and certified by The Compliance Management Group. A
test certificate was issued to Nova on June 28, 2012.
· Altitude Study
The sponsor claims that an altitude up to 10,000 feet does not affect the test results
of the proposed device as established in k112638.
· Hematocrit study
The sponsor claims a hematocrit range of 25 to 65% as established in k112638.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
