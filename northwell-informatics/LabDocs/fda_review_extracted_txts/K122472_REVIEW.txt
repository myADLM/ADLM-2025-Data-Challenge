L. Test Principle:
The VARIANT II TURBO HbA1c Kit- 2.0 is based on chromatographic separation of
HbA1c on a cation exchange cartridge. The various forms of hemoglobin exhibit charge
differences (positive) at the acidic pH of the mobile phase, and thus can be separated on a
support that is negatively charged (cation exchange). The use of ion-exchange
chromatography allows molecules to be separated based upon a molecule’s charge.
Separation is optimized to eliminate interferences from hemoglobin variants (HbS, HbC,
HbD and HbE trait), labile A1c, hemoglobin F and carbamylated hemoglobin.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Previously established in submission k090699.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The reportable range of 3.5 to 19.0% HbA was previously established in submission
1c
k090699.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators were previously cleared in k070452. The recommended control materials
were cleared in k070546 and k052838.
The modified device is certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization
Program (NGSP) as having documented traceability to the Diabetes Control and
Complications Trial (DCCT) reference method.
d. Detection limit:
Previously established in submission k090699.
e. Analytical specificity:
The interference claims for icterus (bilirubin), lipemia (triglyceride), EDTA,
hemoglobin F, labile A and carbamylated hemoglobin were previously established
1c
in submission k090699.
The possible interferant effects from hemoglobin variants C, D, E, F, S and A2 (HbC,
HbD, HbE, HbF, HbS and HbA2) were evaluated. Two fresh, EDTA non-variant

human blood sample pools at 6.5% and 8.0-9.0% HbA were collected. Fresh,
1c
homozygous EDTA-whole blood samples containing each of the hemoglobin variants
(E, D, S, and C) were obtained. EDTA-whole blood samples were prepared by
spiking purified HbF or HbA2. For the interference testing of each variant, a series of
test sample pools (0, 25, 50, 75, 100% and additional intermediate pools) were
prepared by the dilution of a homozygous variant patient sample (as interferant) in the
non-variant patient sample pool. The samples were run in duplicate on two
VARIANT II TURBO Hemoglobin Testing Systems. Non-significant interference
was defined by the sponsor as less than ±10% bias from control.
Based upon the data in the study, the sponsor claims no interference at the following
concentrations: HbC ≤72%, HbD ≤55%, HbE ≤41%, HbF ≤25%, HbS ≤67% and
HbA2 ≤10%.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To demonstrate the correlation between samples analyzed on devices using CDM
Software Versions 5.1 (candidate device) and samples run on devices using CDM
Software Version 4.03 (predicate device), 40 EDTA whole blood patient samples, 60
commercially purchased EDTA whole blood patient samples and 16 contrived
samples prepared by mixing EDTA whole blood samples with either purified HbA0
or purified HbA1c (8 samples cover 3.5% to 4.5% and 8 samples cover 14.2% to
19.5%) were analyzed by the VARIANT II TURBO HbA1c Kit - 2.0 run on the
VARIANT II TURBO Hemoglobin Testing System using both software versions. .
The samples were run in singlet on the subject device and on the predicate device.

N. Instrument Name:
Bio-Rad VARIANT II TURBO Hemoglobin Testing System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
A completely closed, fully automated, high-throughput analyzer consisting of a
chromatographic and a sampling station.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Samples are identified from the barcode on blood collection test tube. The code is read
automatically by the analyzer. The system software (CDM 5.1.1) detects and prevents
mismatch of results with sample ID. If a mismatch is detected, the sample result will not
be sent to the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and the operator will be notified.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Blood is drawn into normal vacuum test tube. The blood collection tube is placed directly
into a sample rack, which is part of the analyzer. A volume of sample is automatically
drawn from the tube through its rubber seal.
