uncomplicated parapneumonic effusions. All pleural fluids with a pH measurement < 7.3
are referred to as complicated parapneumonic, and exudative in nature.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A Precision study was conducted to evaluate pleural fluid precision on the
RAPIDPoint® 400/405/500 systems. The precision study consisted of two runs per
day, an n=2 per sample run on the RP400/405/500 and performed over the course of
20 days for an n=80. Pleural fluid samples were adjusted to three levels of pH within
7.0 to 7.5 units. All samples were stored frozen until the time of use. Each run was
performed in Pleural Fluid mode and spaced a minimum of to hours apart, contained
Calibration Verification Material (CVM) and pleural fluid samples. Results for CVM
controls and pleural fluid pH are contained in the tables below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity data for pleural fluid collected in the method comparison study (see Section
M.2a. below) was used to demonstrate linearity on the RAPIDPoint® 400/405/500
systems. Linear regression analysis of the results yielded the following:
RP400: y=1.066x (-0.437), r2=0.99
RP405: y=1.008x (-0.09), r2=0.95
RP500: y=1.059x (-0.373), r2=0.99
The measuring range for pleural fluid samples is pH 7.0 to 7.5.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There is no unique calibration measurement for pleural fluid pH. The pH calibration
measurement is used for pleural fluid pH.
The traceability, stability and expected value of the RAPID QC Complete were
previously cleared in k970956.
