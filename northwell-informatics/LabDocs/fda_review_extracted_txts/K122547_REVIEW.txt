I. Device Description:
The VITEK 2 AST card is essentially a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated
version of the doubling dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC). Each VITEK 2 AST card contains 64 wells. A control well
which only contains microbiological culture media is resident on all cards. The
remaining wells contain premeasured portions of a specific antibiotic combined with
culture media. The bacterial or yeast isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized
2

--- Page 3 ---
concentration with 0.45 – 0.5% saline before being used to rehydrate the
antimicrobial medium within the card. The VITEK 2 System automatically fills, seals
and places the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual
filling, sealing and loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of
each well in the card over a defined period of time. At the completion of the
incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the
interpretive category result for each antibiotic contained on the card.
The VITEK® 2 AST-GP Clindamycin has the following concentrations in the card:
0.06, 0.25, and 1 μg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in
μg/mL). The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 card is £ 0.12 - ≥4 μg/mL.

L. Test Principle:
Automated growth based detection using attenuation of light measured by an optical
scanner. The optics used in the systems use visible light to directly measure organism
growth. Transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before
significant growth has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same
well measure organism growth by how much light is prevented from going through
the well. The VITEK 2 System monitors the growth of each well in the card over a
defined period of time. An interpretive call is made between 4 and 16 hours for a

“rapid” read but may be extended to 18 hours in some instances. At the completion of
the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the
interpretive category result for each antibiotic on the card.
The VITEK® 2 AST-GP Clindamycin has the following concentrations in the card:
0.06, 0.25, and 1 μg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in
μg/mL). The MIC result range for the VITEK 2 card is £ 0.12 - ≥4 μg/mL.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was conducted at three external clinical sites.
Six isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and four isolates of Staphylococcus
epidermidis were tested at each site and testing was performed in triplicate
over three days with the VITEK® 2 AST-GP Clindamycin card resulting in a
total of 270 test results. The testing was performed using both the manual
dilution method and the automated dilution method. Testing was conducted
on the VITEK 2 instrument.
For the sake of reproducibility calculations, off-scale values are handled in
two ways; “best case” and “worst case” scenarios. Best case calculation for
reproducibility assumes the off-scale result is within one well from the mode
MIC value. Worst case calculation for reproducibility assuming the off-scale
result is greater than one well from the mode MIC value. All isolates tested by
VITEK 2 gave on-scale MIC values but a few results were off-scale for
isolates tested by the VITEK 2 Compact.
The overall reproducibility was >95% with +/- one dilution observation for
the VITEK 2 and the VITEK 2 Compact system. Only Manual Dilution
testing was conducted since the VITEK 2 Compact system does not have a
functionality to support automatic dilution to inoculate the card. Results were
as follows:
VITEK System Inoculation Method Best Case Worst Case
VITEK 2 AutoDilution 100% 55.6%
Manual 99.63% 51.1%
VITEK 2 Compact Manual 100% 61.5%

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Staphylococcus
aureus ATCC 29213 QC organisms were tested on every test occasion with
the reference method and the VITEK 2 System.
The reference method QC results were in range for every day tested. The
VITEK 2 was tested a sufficient number of times to demonstrate that the
system can produce QC results in the recommended range.
Quality Control was performed during the studies using both the Auto-dilution
and the manual method of diluting the organisms on the VITEK 2 System.
Results demonstrated that methods were comparable.
Quality Control Results with the VITEK 2 System for Clindamycin were as
follows:
Clindamycin Auto Dilution Manual Dilution

Staphylococcus 0.016

* VITEK Card Result Range is ≤ 0.12 – ≥ 4.
For S. aureus ATCC 29213, results for the VITEK 2 AST-GP Clindamycin
were within the expected QC results range > 95% of the time for both the
automatic and manual dilution options of the VITEK 2.
A similar QC study was conducted to evaluate the VITEK 2 Compact System.
Results were within the expected QC ranges.
Quality Control results for the VITEK 2 System using either inoculation
dilution method demonstrated that the VITEK 2 System could produce the
expected quality control results.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Performance was established through a clinical study which was conducted at
three external study sites. A total of 492 clinical isolates were tested by
VITEK® 2 GP-Clindamycin with the VITEK® 2 System. The majority of the
isolates were recently recovered from clinical specimens.
Two hundred and thirty-three of the 492 clinical isolates tested were stock
isolates (47.4%). None of the isolates failed to grow in the VITEK card giving
a no growth rate of 0.0%.
The clinical isolates were distributed as follows: 302 were S. aureus and 144
were S. epidermidis. The remainder 46 isolates were other coagulase negative
species. A challenge study was conducted using a set consisting of 139
isolates (78 S. aureus and 61 S. epidermidis). The challenge set was tested
with both of the VITEK® 2 System card inoculation options, automatic
dilution and manual dilution. Testing of clinical isolates was performed using
the automated method of inoculation and the challenge organisms were tested
with both the manual dilution and automatic dilution. Each isolate was tested
by the VITEK 2 AST-GP Clindamycin and the CLSI broth microdilution
reference method. The inoculum was prepared with direct colony suspension.
A comparison was provided to the reference method with the agreement
shown in the following tables.
