Mission® Plus Hemoglobin (Hb) Testing Meter
I. Device Description:
Major components of the Mission® Plus Hemoglobin (Hb) Testing System include the
Mission® Hemoglobin (Hb) Testing Meter, Test cartridge, Control Solutions, and Optical
Verifier.
The test cartridges are used with the meter for monitoring hemoglobin concentration and for
estimation of Hematocrit (Hct) within the normal range of hemoglobin in capillary or venous
whole blood. The test cartridge includes a mesh covered sample reaction zone, which
contains assay reagents, sodium deoxycholate and sodium nitrite. Erythrocytes in the
specimen are lysed by the action of sodium deoxycholate to release hemoglobin. Then the
hemoglobin is converted to methemoglobin by the action of sodium nitrite causing a color
change in the reagent area. The meter is a portable, battery-powered device that analyzes the
intensity and color of light reflected from the reagent area of the test cartridge. A code chip
is used to store and transfer calibration information for the test cartridges and is provided
with each canister of test cartridges.

The Mission® Plus Hemoglobin (Hb) Testing System contains 3 levels (0, 1, 2,) of control
solutions with known concentration of hemoglobin used to confirm that the meter and test
cartridges are working together properly.
The optical verifier works with the meter to ensure the optical system of the meter works
properly.

L. Test Principle:
The Mission® Plus Hemoglobin (Hb) Testing System utilizes quantitative reflectance
photometry for measurement of hemoglobin.
The test cartridge includes a mesh covered sample reaction zone. Specimen is applied to the
center of the reaction zone and the mesh functions to separate the sample evenly on the entire
reaction zone. The reagents on the reaction zone function to hemolyze red blood cells and
release the hemoglobin. The hemoglobin is converted to methemoglobin to generate a color
change. The meter reads the intensity of the reflected light at 525 nm every second until the
5

--- Page 6 ---
end point of the reaction is detected. The light intensity at the end point is directly
proportional to the hemoglobin concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was conducted using fresh venous blood specimens. Hemoglobin
concentration was adjusted to 8 levels. One specimen at each level was tested on 6
meters. Each meter was tested in 5 replicates on each lot of test cartridge by one
technician in one day. Three lots of test cartridges were tested in this study. For
sample level 1, four readings were below the reportable range of the device. Results
are summarized in the following table. The acceptance criterion was SD ≤0.4 g/dL
when Hb <10 g/dL or CV ≤3% when Hb ≥10 g/dL.

using a series of standard solutions. This calibration equation is stored in a code chip,
which is provided to the user with each canister of test cartridges. Hemoglobin
concentrations of the standard solutions are confirmed by the hemiglobincyanide
(HiCN) method.
Kit Stability
An accelerated stability study was conducted at 37°C, 45°C, and 55°C to estimate
closed canister stability of the three lots of stored test cartridges. Another accelerated
stability study was conducted at 45°C to estimate the stability of the test cartridges
stored in an “open/closed” form using three lots of test cartridges. Closed canister
stability (shelf life) of the test cartridge was estimated to be 2 years and 3 months in
the “open/closed” form. A real time stability study was conducted using 3 lots of test
cartridges at 2~8°C and 30±3°C to verify the stability of the test cartridges stored in
either the “closed” form or the “open/closed” form. At each testing time point, fresh
human blood was collected and hemoglobin concentration was adjusted to three
predetermined levels. One specimen at each hemoglobin level was tested in 10
replicates with each lot of test cartridges. Real time stability testing is still in progress
and shelf life of the test cartridges will be updated upon completion of this study and
meeting the following criteria.
Hb Level Precision Bias vs. Target Hb Level
<10 g/dL SD ≤0.4 g/dL ±0.7 g/dL

Controls
The Mission® Plus Hemoglobin (Hb) Testing System includes 3 levels (0, 1, 2,) of
control solutions. A control value assignment study was conducted to determine the
value assignment of the control solutions in the Mission® Plus Hemoglobin (Hb)
Testing System. Three levels of controls were prepared with target hemoglobin
values listed in the table below.
Control Solution Target Hemoglobin Value (g/dL)
Level 1 8.1-10.2
Level 2 13.2-14.9
Level 3 17.0-18.8
Each level of the controls was tested on 5 meters, 2 replicates on each meter. Each
lot of controls was tested with 3 lots of test cartridges. Three lots of controls were
tested. The control value assignment was determined to be the total average result ±
9% of the average value.
A control precision study was conducted to examine the precision of the controls
tested with the Mission® Plus Hemoglobin (Hb) Testing System. Three bottles of
control solutions from the same lot were tested for each level of controls. Each bottle
was tested with 5 meters, 4 replicates on each meter. Within-run CV was calculated
for each bottle and total CV was calculated for each level of controls. All within-run

	Control Solution			Target Hemoglobin Value (g/dL)	
Level 1			8.1-10.2		
Level 2			13.2-14.9		
Level 3			17.0-18.8		

--- Page 9 ---
CVs and total CVs were less than 3.0%. All individual testing results were within the
assigned control value range.
An accelerated stability study was conducted at 37°C and 45°C to estimate the
stability of the controls in “closed” form using three lots of control solutions.
Another accelerated stability study was conducted at 37°C to estimate the stability in
an “open/closed” form using three lots of control solutions. The accelerated stability
studies demonstrated that the control solutions have an estimated shelf life of 1 year if
stored at 4°C in either the “closed” form or the “open/closed” form. A real time
stability was conducted to test product stability using three lots of control solutions
stored at 2~8°C in either the “closed” form or the “open/closed” form. Real time
stability study demonstrated that when stored at 2~8°C, the control solutions have a
shelf life of 6 months in the “closed” form and a shelf life of 30 days after the bottle
is opened.
Sample
Sample Volume Flex Study
Multiple sample volumes were evaluated at three hemoglobin levels. Each sample
was tested on the Mission® Plus Hemoglobin (Hb) Testing System in 5 replicates
using one lot of test cartridges on five meters. Hemoglobin concentration was
confirmed with a Sysmex pocH-100i Hematology Analyzer, which was used as the
reference method. Test result was determined to be acceptable if the bias against the
reference method was less that ±7%. The appropriate sample volume range was
determined to be 5-40 µL. The sponsor recommends use of a pipette or the provided
capillary blood transfer tube with fixed volume of 10 µL for blood application.
Sample Storage Time Flex Study
The effect of sample storage time was evaluated at various time points using EDTA-
K as the anticoagulant. Fresh venous blood collected from a single donor was
2
adjusted to three hemoglobin levels. Samples at each hemoglobin level were divided
into four containers and stored at 25°C. Each container was tested at a pre-
determined time point. Each sample was tested on the Mission® Plus Hemoglobin
(Hb) Testing System in 5 replicates using one lot of test cartridges on five meters.
Hemoglobin concentration was confirmed with a Sysmex pocH-100i Hematology
Analyzer, which was used as the reference method. A test result was determined to
be acceptable if the bias against the reference method was less that ±7%. The sample
storage time was determined to be within 8 hours at 25°C.

b. Matrix comparison:
A specimen matrix comparison study was conducted to compare the performance of
the Mission® Plus Hemoglobin (Hb) Testing System on venous blood and on
fingerstick capillary blood. A total of 50 participants were enrolled in this study.
Venous blood and capillary blood was collected at the same time from each donor.
The venous blood specimens were collected using EDTA-K as the anticoagulant and
2
tested within 8 hours after collection. The capillary blood specimens were tested
immediately after collection. Difference of hemoglobin concentration between
venous blood and capillary blood was within the acceptable range.
Effect of Anticoagulants
A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of anticoagulants on the performance of
the Mission® Plus Hemoglobin (Hb) Testing System. Fresh venous blood was
collected to tubes contained different anticoagulants: EDTA-K , EDTA-K , EDTA-
2 3
Na , or sodium heparin. Two tubes were used for each anticoagulant. Hemoglobin
2
concentration in the first tube was kept unadjusted. Hemoglobin concentration in the
second tube was adjusted to five target levels: 4.5~5.5 g/dL, 10~11 g/dL, 12~14 g/dL,
17~18 g/dL and 24.6~25.6 g/dL. Hemoglobin concentration, adjusted and
unadjusted, in tubes with EDTA-K was tested immediately with a Sysmex pocH-
2
100i Hematology Analyzer, which was used as Control 1. The fresh venous blood
was also collected without anticoagulant and tested immediately with the Mission®

Operating Temperature and Humidity Study
Test cartridges and meters were stored in chambers at different temperatures and
humidity for 2 hours. Tests were performed in the same chamber using samples at three
hemoglobin levels. Each sample was tested on 2 meters, 5 replicates on each meter. One
lot of test cartridges was used. Testing result at 20±3°C and 40~60% relative humidity
was used as the control. A test result was determined to be acceptable if the bias against
the control was less that ±7%. Studies demonstrated that the Mission® Plus Hemoglobin
(Hb) Testing System can be operated over a temperature range of 10-40°C and relative
humidity <90%.
Meter Storage Study
Meters were stored in chambers at different temperature and humidity for a pre-
determined period. The meters were then removed from the chambers and left at ambient
condition for a pre-determined period. Tests were performed at ambient condition using
samples at three hemoglobin levels. Each sample was tested on 2 meters, 5 replicates on
each meter. One lot of test cartridges was used. Testing result from the meters stored at
20±3°C and 40~60% relative humidity was used as the control. A test result was
determined to be acceptable if the bias against the control was less that ±7%. Studies
demonstrated that the test meter can be stored over a temperature range of 0-50°C and
relative humidity <90%.
Control Temperature Flex Study
One lot of test cartridges, one lot of control solutions and one meter were stored at
different temperature for 30 minutes. Each level of control solution was tested on the
meter in 5 replicates at each temperature. Result at 25°C was used as the control. Test
results were determined to be acceptable if the bias against the control was less that ±7%.
It was demonstrated that the control solutions can be used a temperature range of 2~8°C
to 37°C.
