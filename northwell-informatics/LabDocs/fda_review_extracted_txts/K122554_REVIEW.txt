510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
k122554
B. Purpose for Submission:
Addition of the GenASI ALK System Application to the GenASI ScanView System
for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of gene rearrangements involving the
Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) gene (2p23)
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Applied Spectral Imaging Ltd.
GenASIs ScanView System
GenASI ALK System
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Automated fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detection and enumeration of
rearrangements involving the ALK gene (2p23) in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded
(FFPE) human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissue specimens treated with the
Vysis® ALK Break Apart FISH Probe Kit
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The GenASIs ScanView is an integrated digital imaging system constructed of a
microscope, motorized multi-slide stage, camera, and a workstation. It is designed
to acquire images of cells and enables identification and examination of cells of
interest. Pathologists can view and scan cells and record the image, using both
bright field and fluorescent illumination. The acquired images can be enhanced,
archived, retrieved and printed. The automated microscope enables Z motion of
the slide and the motorized stage enables its X-Y motions. The microscope also
includes motorized filter turret containing fluorescence filters. The Gen ASIs
ALK System software application evaluates FISH in human NSCLC tissue
specimens hybridized with the Vysis® ALK Break Apart FISH Probe Kit.

2. Principles of Operation:
The Gen ASIs ScanView System works with the Gen ASIs ALK System software
application to evaluate FISH stained human NSCLC tissue specimens by the
Vysis® ALK Break Apart FISH Probe Kit. The probe kit contains a mixture of
two probes that are on opposite sides flanking the breakpoint of the ALK gene.
The 3’-ALK probe hybridizes telomerically at the breakpoint and is labeled with
Spectrum Orange and the 5’-ALK probe hybridizes centromerically at the
breakpoint and is labeled with Spectrum Green. After hybridization with the ALK
Probe, the 2p23 ALK region in its native state will be seen as two immediately
adjacent or fused orange/green (yellow) signals (2F). However, if a t(2;5) or other
chromosome rearrangement at the 2p23 ALK breakpoint region has occurred, one
orange and one green signal will be seen, while the native ALK region will
remain as an orange/green fusion signal. The user defines the regions containing
tumor cells and manually captures cells from these regions. The system
automatically defines the cells of interest and the pathologist then either chooses
specific cells for analysis or the system analyzes all of the cells from the selected
regions. At least 100 cells should be counted. The GenASIs ALK System
application reports the counts of the orange, green and fused (yellow) signals in
each cell and classifies it according to predefined cell categories. After the
scanning, each cell is presented in a gallery and the pathologist can approve,
modify or reject the call for each cell. The overall statistics are updated
accordingly. Only after the pathologist confirms the final score is the calculated
percent positive cells for the gene rearrangement printed out in a final report.
3. Modes of Operation:
Semi-automated; manual capture of selected regions with computer-assisted
interpretation
4. Specimen Identification:
Barcode Reader
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimens are FFPENSCLC tissue specimens on glass slides hybridized with the
Vysis® ALK Break Apart FISH Probe kit.
Scanning more than one slide requires a specialized stage that supports a tray
holding up to nine slides for automatic scanning

PathVysion™kit is further indicated as an aid to predict disease-free and
overall survival in patients with stage II, node positive breast cancer, treated
with adjuvant cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil (CAF)
chemotherapy.
3. Cells in urine specimens, stained by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
usingVysis UroVysion™ Bladder Cancer Kit to detect aneuploidy for
chromosomes 3, 7, 17, and loss of the 9p21 locus, from persons with
hematuria suspected of having bladder cancer. The results are intended for
use, in conjunction with and not in lieu of current standard diagnostic
procedures, as an aid for initial diagnosis of bladder carcinoma in patients
with hematuria and subsequent monitoring for tumor recurrence in patients
previously diagnosed with bladder cancer.
4. Gene rearrangements involving the ALK gene (2p23) via fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissue specimens, using Vysis® ALK (Anaplastic

the FDA approved Vysis ALK Break Apart FISH Probe Kit according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
At each clinical site, archived slides from NSCLC tissue specimens,
previously counted and analyzed manually in the last 6 months, were used for
the test. Negative cases were selected sequentially from a known bank of
negative samples. All positive and equivocal slides that were available during
the period of the comparison studies were used for the analysis in order to
have an adequate number of slides in each of the categories.
Patients with NSCLC that were negative for the EGFR test were included in
the study. At four clinical sites, a total of 179 slides including 9 cases in the
equivocal zone (10-50%) were analyzed. The GenASIs ScanView operator
had no prior knowledge of the manual counting results. Method comparison
results for all four sites combined are presented below in Table 1:

sites combined

GenASIs Negative 147 0 147
ScanView Positive 0 32 32

Overall agreement: 100%% (95% CI: 98%-100%)
Negative percent agreement: 100% (95% CI: 97.5%-100%)
Positive percent agreement: 100% (95% CI: 89.1%-100%)
b. Precision/Reproducibility:
A panel of 10 slides chosen by the manual counting results, 4 of which were
negative (<10%) , 3 equivocal (10-50%) and 6 positive (>50%)were evaluated
for repeatability and reproducibility of diagnosis (positive/negative) for the
following:
· Within-day/within system: each one of the slides was evaluated three
times on the same system on the same day.
· Between days: slides were assessed on three separate days on the same
system (interval between assessments was at least five days).
· Between systems: three GenASIs ScanView ALK Systems were used
at three different sites by three different operators.
Diagnoses over different days and systems were 100% concordant for positive
vs. negative results, as were within-day results. Both repeatability and
reproducibility in the study were 100%.

Mean percent positive cells, standard deviation and % coefficient of variation
for each study are presented in Table 2 below. For the negative specimens
%CV values are not applicable as a higher degree of variance is to be
expected in negative or low positive specimens due to the fewer signals.
