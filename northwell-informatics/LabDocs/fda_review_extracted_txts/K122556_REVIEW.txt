L. Test Principle:
Estrogen Receptor Clone 6F11 (ER 6F11) is recommended for use in an
immunohistochemical procedure, which allows the qualitative identification by light
microscopy of antigens in sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue, via
sequential steps with interposed washing steps. Prior to staining, endogenous peroxidase
activity is blocked and sections are subjected to epitope retrieval. The tissue section is
subsequently incubated with the mouse primary antibody that binds with the human tissue
antigen. A polymeric enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody that recognizes mouse
immunoglobulins is used to detect the primary antibody. Sections are further incubated with
the substrate/chromogen, 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and DAB Substrate Buffer. Reaction
with the peroxidase produces a visible brown precipitate at the antigen site. Sections are
counterstained with hematoxylin and coverslipped. Results are interpreted using a light
microscope.

also evaluated at this site on FFPE breast cancer tissue on the Bond III staining
platform. The following testing configuration was used in each of the above studies:
Testing was conducted using 3 slides mounted with tissue micro arrays (TMAs) of
human breast carcinomas samples. Each slide contained 13 TMA cores as follows: 3
cores each of high, medium and low positive ER staining and 3 cores of negative ER
staining breast cancer tissue and 1 core of normal breast (non-neoplastic) tissue
serving as a control tissue. In addition, 1 test slide with negative control antibody and
1 assay control slide were also used. Staining was performed three times over three
different days (3 slides x 3 tests = 9 TMA slides incorporating 108 breast cancer
specimens). Two cores were unevaluable due to tissue loss. All test slides were
blinded, randomized and assessed by a single observer. The scoring was performed
per the ASCO/CAP scoring method [American Society of Clinical Oncology/College
of American Pathologists Guideline Recommendations for Immunohistochemical
Testing of Estrogen and Progesterone Receptors in Breast Cancer (Arch Pathol Lab
Med. 2010;134:e48–e72), i.e. positive for ER if finding of ≥ 1% of tumor cell nuclei
are immunoreactive and negative for ER if finding of < 1% of tumor cell nuclei are
immunoreactive in the presence of evidence that the sample can express ER (positive
intrinsic controls are seen)]. In addition the staining intensity was also assessed. The
acceptance criteria set by the sponsor was 85% agreement (overall, positive and
negative) at the lower bound of a two-sided 95% confidence interval. The acceptance
criteria were met in these studies.
Inter-run/inter-day precision
Inter-run precision of the Estrogen Receptor Clone 6F11 Ready-to-Use Primary
Antibody for Bond™ (RTU) was evaluated at a single site on FFPE breast cancer
tissue on the Bond III staining platform. Similarly the Estrogen Receptor Clone 6F11
Liquid Concentrate Primary Antibody, Novocastra™ (concentrate) was also
evaluated at this site on FFPE breast cancer tissue on the Bond III staining platform.
The following testing configuration was used in each of the above studies: Testing
was conducted using 3 slides mounted with TMAs of human breast carcinomas
samples. Each slide contained 13 TMA cores as follows: 3 cores each of high,
medium and low positive ER staining and 3 cores of negative ER staining breast
cancer tissue and 1 core of normal breast (non-neoplastic) tissue serving as a control
tissue. In addition, 1 test slide with negative control antibody and 1 assay control
slide were also used. Staining was performed five times over five different days
performed over a twenty (20) day period (3 slides x 5 tests = 15 TMA slides
incorporating 180 breast cancer specimens). All test slides were blinded, randomized
and assessed by a single observer. Four cores were unevaluable due to tissue loss.
The scoring criteria were the same as above. The acceptance criteria were the same
as above. The acceptance criteria were met in these studies.
Within Instrument Precision Study (intra-instrument)
Within-instrument precision testing of the Estrogen Receptor Clone 6F11 Ready-to-
Use Primary Antibody for Bond™ (RTU) was evaluated on FFPE breast cancer tissue
on three Bond III staining platforms. Similarly the Estrogen Receptor Clone 6F11

evaluated on FFPE breast cancer tissue on three Bond III staining platforms. Three
slides – one TMA slide (12 breast cancer cores as described in 1a above), 1 with
negative control antibody and 1 assay control slide, were stained three times over
three different days (3 slides x 3 runs x3 instruments, 108 test data points) for each
combination of the antibody format and the staining platform. Samples spanned the
range of ER expression. All test slides were blinded, randomized and assessed by a
single observer. Five cores were unevaluable due to tissue loss. The scoring criteria
were the same as above. The acceptance criteria were the same as above and were
met in these studies.
Inter-Site Reproducibility
Inter-site reproducibility testing of the Estrogen Receptor Clone 6F11 Ready-to-Use
Primary Antibody for Bond™ and the Estrogen Receptor Clone 6F11 Liquid
Concentrate Primary Antibody, Novocastra™ was evaluated at 3 investigational sites
on whole tissue sections using the Bond III stainer. The test cohort consisted of 18
cases. Samples spanned the range of ER expression. Testing was performed over a
span of 5 non-consecutive days (Day1, Day3, Day 5), with each site staining a full set
of cases on each day. This provided 9 replicates of 18 cases. The scoring criteria
were the same as above. In addition, all aspects of staining quality was assessed and
reported for each case i.e. staining intensity, proportion of cells staining, background
staining, tissue morphology, staining of benign ductal cells, stromal cells, endothelial
cells and lymphocytes for each study case. The acceptance criteria set by the sponsor

Positive and negative control slides should be stained with each staining run. The
pathologist is responsible for assuring the proper performance of this test.
The stability of the Estrogen Receptor Clone 6F11 Ready-to-Use Primary Antibody
for Bond™ and the Estrogen Receptor Clone 6F11 Liquid Concentrate Primary
Antibody, Novocastra™ was assessed by subjecting the device to temperature
extremes and the intended use storage conditions. Testing was performed on breast
cancer tissue sections that expressed estrogen receptor at a high, medium, low
intensity and negative ER expression and on normal breast tissue. Testing was
performed at specified intervals. Acceptance criteria were as follows: Test case
passes if the stain intensity score and proportion score (≥ 1% of tumor cell nuclei
staining = Positive; < 1% of tumor cell nuclei staining = Negative) are identical for
each of the test estrogen expressive breast cancer cases used when compared to a
control score. Based on the studies the shelf-life of the device is 18 months.

The test device Estrogen Receptor Clone 6F11 Ready-to-Use Primary Antibody for
Bond™ and the staining platform Bond III using the DS9800 Bond Polymer Refine
Detection kit was tested in an independent clinical outcome study. This study used a
retrospective patient cohort (n=532) composed of breast cancer patients diagnosed
between 1985 and 2000 in the Tom Baker Cancer Center in Calgary, who were
treated with primary adjuvant tamoxifen regardless of their ER and PR status. This
cohort had a greater than 5 years of follow-up, it was enriched for events to increase
its statistical power and it included ER negative patients so as to remove treatment
selection bias. There were 473 samples available for evaluation with the test device.
A Kaplan-Meier survival plot by Leica ER (6F11) status showed strong separation
between Leica ER positive and ER negative cases. As expected, ER positive patients
had longer survival times than ER negative patients when tamoxifen treatment was
administered.
