L. Test Principle:
Prothrombin Time- the thromboplastin reagent included in the ReadiPlasTin kit, after
mixing with the ReadiPlasTin Diluent, is a liposomal preparation that contains
recombinant human tissue factor (RTF), relipidated in a synthetic phospholipid blend.
In the Prothrombin Time (PT) test, the addition of the tissue thromboplastin
(ReadiPlasTin reagent) to the patient plasma in the presence of calcium ions initiates
the activation of the extrinsic pathway. This results ultimately in the conversion of
fibrinogen to fibrin, with formation of a solid gel.
Fibrinogen- derived- fibrinogen is quantitated (PT-based method) by relating the
absorbance during clotting to a calibrator.

The acceptance criteria were met for all samples within each study.
Repeatability for HemosIL ReadiPlasTin was performed by testing a three lots
of the applicable controls and calibrators with one lot of HemosIL
ReadiPlasTin on a representative member of the ACL TOP instrument family
(ACL TOP 700), for 5 days, 1 run/day, and 4 replicates per run for each
sample level (N=20 per level/ instrument/ lot). The within-run CV% for PT
seconds were ≤5% and for Fibrinogen PT-derived were ≤15% employing the
controls and calibrators. All result met acceptance criteria.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Fibrinogen linearity testing was performed in accordance with CLSI EP06,
using one lot of HemosIL ReadiPlasTin reagent, on a representative member
of the ACL TOP Family (ACL TOP 700). Two samples, a high-fibrinogen
donor sample (~800 mg/dL) and a fibrinogen-deficient donor plasma sample
(< 60 mg/dL), were used to prepare 10 samples ranging from ~40 mg/dL to
~800 mg/dL. Fibrinogen concentrations were determined by HemosIL
Fibrinogen C and were tested against ReadiPlasTin in quadruplicate.
Theoretical fibrinogen values were calculated as the weighted average of the
highest and lowest fibrinogen in the series. Acceptance criteria were as
follows: slope, 0.85 – 1.15; R2 ≥ 0.95. The results of the study fell within
acceptable limits and demonstrated that HemosIL ReadiPlasTin is linear
within the range of 60 to 700 mg/dL.
Extrinsic factor linearity testing was performed with factor deficient plasma
for FII, FV, FVII and FX, using one lot of ReadiPlasTin on a representative

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Real Time Stability (closed vial):
The general storage condition for the ReadiPlasTin kit is at 2-8°C. Three lots
were stored and at periodic times sample vials were removed for stability
testing. The lots were tested on an ACL TOP 700 and ACL TOP 500 CTS for
the recovery of ReadiPlasTin for the plasma controls. Using the mean of the
ReadiPlasTin values for each control plasma sample at month zero as a
baseline, the change (%) for each time point was calculated for PT and PT-
based Fibrinogen. Real time stability was tested for 18 months for the first
and second lot, and 15 months for the third lot. All the real time stability tests
performed were within the established acceptance range. Results for real time
stability support a 15-month shelf-life claim of the ReadiPlasTin kit when
stored at 2-8 °C. Ongoing real-time stability testing will be used to update the
shelf-life.
On-board Stability (open vial):
On-board stability testing was performed on 2 different lots of HemosIL
ReadiPlasTin on a representative member of the ACL TOP Family (ACL TOP
500 CTS). Two lots of ReadiPlasTin reagent were placed in the reagent block
of an ACL TOP 500 CTS. Each of the control levels listed above was tested
for PT and PT-based Fib at 0, 3, 7, 10 & 11 day time points. Each control
plasma sample was tested in quadruplicate. Using the mean of the
ReadiPlasTin values of each control plasma sample on day zero as a base line,
the change (%) for each time point was calculated for PT and PT-based
Fibrinogen. Acceptable performance was determined if the percentage change
in the recovery, relative to the initial baseline value, met the following
specifications:

Low Fibrinogen Control NA baseline mean ± 15%
The data from both HemosIL ReadiPlasTin lots support an on-board stability
of 10 days at 15°C.
Reconstituted stability at 2-8° C:
Vials of two lots of ReadiPlasTin reagent were prepared according to the
insert, placed at 2-8°C and taken out periodically to be tested on an ACL TOP
500 CTS. Each of the control levels listed above was tested in quadruplicate
for PT and PT-based Fib at 0, 3, 10, 11, 14 and 21 day time points. After
testing, the vials of reagent were returned to 2-8ºC. Using the mean of the
ReadiPlasTin values of each control plasma sample on day zero as a baseline,
the change (%) for each time point was calculated for PT and PT-based Fib.
Performance of the reagent was judged to be acceptable if the percentage
change in the recovery, relative to the initial baseline value met the
specification listed in Table 3. The data supports the claim of reconstituted
stability for 10 days at 2-8°C.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference limits were established for the following substances:
Unfractionated Heparin (UHF), Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH),
Hemoglobin, Bilirubin, Triglycerides and the antibiotic Daptomycin. An
interference study was performed with one lot of ReadiPlasTin on a
representative member of the ACL TOP® Family (ACL TOP (base)). Two
levels of plasma were used: 1.) a commercially available normal platelet poor
plasma pool from 20 or more male and female donors; 2.) a commercially
available pool of oral anticoagulant patient samples with an INR 2.0-3.0. The
two sample levels were spiked with multiple levels of the indicated interferent
and tested in quadruplicate. The data was then compared to the unspiked
control result. Performance of the reagent was judged to be acceptable if the
ReadiPlasTin reagent met the following recovery specifications:

b. Matrix comparison:
Fresh vs. Once Thawed Samples- Plasma samples (n=245) were collected in
accordance with CLSI H21-A5. Samples included both normal (n=140) and
abnormal (n=105) samples. Abnormal samples included patients receiving
Daptomycin, heparin (LMWH and UHF) and oral anticoagulation therapy
(OAT), as well as patients with liver disease. Testing was performed on a
representative member of the ACL TOP Family (ACL TOP 700), with the
new HemosIL ReadiPlasTin assay. After testing the fresh samples, the
samples were stored at or below -65ºC for at least 24 hours, prior to being
thawed and re-tested. The HemosIL ReadiPlasTin results obtained from once-
thawed when compared to those from fresh samples, must meet the following
acceptance criteria:
Table 14- Acceptance Criteria Fresh vs. Once Thawed Plasma Samples
Slope r
PT-based FIB 0.85-1.15 ≥ 0.95
PT/INR 0.90-1.10 ≥ 0.95
The regression analysis was performed by plotting the results from once-
thawed patient samples against those from freshly drawn patient samples. The
results for PT seconds and PT-based Fibrinogen are reported below:

The results demonstrate that HemosIL ReadiPlasTin delivers comparable
results on fresh samples and once-thawed samples.

Comparison of 3.2% and 3.8% sodium citrate plasma- Two parallel blood
samples were drawn, from a total of 30 ostensibly normal donors, using both a
3.2% and 3.8% sodium citrate sample tube. Plasma from each donor was
promptly recovered after centrifugation. A portion of donor plasmas was
pooled and depleted of vitamin-K dependent proteins. This pool was used to
create a set of abnormal samples with a wide range of PT values. Samples
were run in duplicate on an ACL TOP 500 CTS. Acceptance criteria were as
follows:
Table 16- 3.2% and 3.8% sodium citrate comparison
Slope Correlation coefficient (r)
Prothrombin Time 0.90 – 1.10 ≥ 0.95
Fibrinogen PT-derived 0.85 – 1.15 ≥ 0.90
The method comparison between samples collected with 3.2% citrate tubes
and the same samples collected into 3.8% citrate tubes demonstrated
acceptable correlation for PT with a Deming regression slope, intercept and
correlation coefficient of 1.071, 0, and 0.9983 respectively. The Deming
regression slope, intercept and correlation coefficient for Fibrinogen PT
derived were 0.902, 1.4, and 0.9326 respectively.

a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Extrinsic Factor Sensitivity: To demonstrate extrinsic factor sensitivity, a
study was performed to evaluate the performance of the HemosIL®
ReadiPlasTin assay and determine the factor level at which the Prothrombin
Time rises above the upper limit of the reference interval. Samples were
prepared by mixing HemosIL factor deficient plasma with normal pool plasma
of known assayed factors to create 11 dilutions. Concentrations ranged from
7% to 110% factor activity. Prothrombin time was determined on each
plasma dilution in duplicate on a representative member of the ACL TOP
Family (ACL TOP 700). “Factor sensitivity” is defined as the factor level at
which PT rises above the upper limit of the reference interval. PT values in
seconds (Y-axis) were plotted against % Factor value (X-axis). The cut-off
for each factor was determined as the point where the % Factor intersects the
upper limit of the reference interval. The assay is sensitive to factors II, V,

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
A reference interval study was performed using one lot of HemosIL ReadiPlasTin
reagent kit on a representative member of the ACL TOP Family (ACL TOP 700).
One hundred ninety nine (199) clinical samples (104 male and 95 female) from
ostensibly “normal patients” were used in this study. Normal patient samples
were tested for Prothrombin time and derived Fibrinogen values. The results
were statistically analyzed for their distribution in order to verify the normal range
for ReadiPlasTin:
Table 17- Reference Range Verification
Reference Intervals Lower Limit Upper Limit
PT (seconds) 10.2 12.9
Fibrinogen -PT derived (mg/dL) 282 553
The sponsor labeling indicates ReadiPlasTin results were obtained using a
specific lot of reagent. Due to many variables which may affect clotting times,
each laboratory should establish its own normal range.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
