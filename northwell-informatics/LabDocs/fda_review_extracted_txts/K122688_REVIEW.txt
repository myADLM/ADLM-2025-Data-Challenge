L. Test Principle:
Glucose measurement is based on electrochemical biosensor technology using the
enzyme glucose dehydrogenase - FAD. The glucose in the sample is oxidized to
produce glucoronic acid. The electrical current resulting from this enzymatic
reaction is measured and correlated to glucose concentration by the meter. The
magnitude of the current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the
sample. The test strip is calibrated to display the equivalent of plasma glucose
values to allow comparison of results with laboratory methods. Using the same
technology, β-hydroxybutyrate (β- ketone) is converted by β-hydroxybutyrate
dehydrogenase and the magnitude of electrical current resulting from this
enzymatic reaction is proportional to the amount of β- hydroxybutyrate present in

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The glucose test strips (Glucose dehydrogenase-FAD enzyme) utilized in the Nova
Max Mini Blood Glucose and β-Ketone Monitor are the same as the Nova Max One
glucose test strips, previously cleared in k112638 and the ketone test strips are the
same as the Nova Max Plus Ketone test strips, previously cleared in k091547.
The Nova Max Mini Blood Glucose and β-Ketone Monitor, while smaller than
both the Nova Max Plus (k091547) and the Nova Max One (k112638) Monitors, has
the same fundamental scientific technology and user interface. The only changes
made to the components of the system as compared to the cleared systems (k091547
and k112638) are the smaller housing and display.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Whole Blood Glucose:
Within-run precision was measured using heparinized venous whole blood
samples at six different glucose concentrations. Each sample was tested on 3
lots of test strips on six meters. Five replicates were tested per meter, test
strip lot, and glucose concentration, (N=90 per glucose concentration tested).

1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and requires a sample volume of 0.4 µL for glucose
measurements and 0.8µL for ketone measurements.
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer,
webserver, or mobile device?
Yes ________ or No __X______
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile
device using wireless transmission?
Yes __________ or No ___X____
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this line of product types:
Yes __X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied
directly to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger,
and forearm only. The β-ketone test is intended to be used with capillary whole
blood from fingerstick only. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test
strip by capillary action.
5. Calibration:
There is no calibration required for the Nova Max Mini Blood Glucose and B-
Ketone monitor by the user. The meter is plasma-calibrated for glucose..
6. Quality Control:
Glucose and β-ketone control solutions at two different concentrations can be run
with this device. The meter has an algorithm to recognize the control solutions to
prevent control results from being stored in the internal memory as patient result.

Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the
labeling. The control solution readings are not included in the average of the
patient results. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the
glucose and β-ketone test strip vial labels. The user is cautioned not to use the
meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Usability Study:
A usability study was conducted at one site with forty enrolled participants.
The participants were divided into two focus groups. Each participant was
identified as either having type 1 or type 2 diabetes performing regular self-
monitoring of blood glucose levels at home (≥1month regular self-
monitoring). Each enrolled participant was at least 18 years of age and
willing to complete all study procedures. Each participant was asked to read
the following labeling material: Owner’s guide, quick reference guide,
glucose and β-ketone control solution (levels 1,2,3) package inserts, and
glucose and β-ketone test strip package inserts. Subsequently, each
participant was given a questionnaire evaluating each reading material
provided for the study. The ease of use of the Nova Max Mini meter was
evaluated by asking each participant to perform testing functions and by
using the meter with glucose and β-ketone control solutions. Additionally,
each participant’s ability to distinguish between glucose and β-ketone
measurements was evaluated using control solution materials.
Overall, the study participants found the labeling materials easy to
comprehend and the Nova Max Mini Blood Glucose and β-ketone monitoring
system easy to use. All participants were able to differentiate between a
glucose and a β-ketone measurement.
2. Altitude Study :
The effect of varying altitudes previously reviewed in the Nova Max Plus Blood
Glucose and β-ketone submission (k091547).
3. Hematocrit Study:
The effect of hematocrit previously reviewed in the Nova Max Plus Blood
Glucose and β-ketone submission (k091547)
4. Temperature and Relative Humidity Study:
The effect of temperature and relative humidity previously evaluated in the Nova
Max Plus Blood Glucose and β-ketone submission (k091547).
5. EMC Electromagnetic Compatibility and Electrical Safety verification testing of
14

--- Page 15 ---
the Nova Max Mini Blood Glucose and β ketone Monitoring System was
performed following the requirements of EN60601-1-1-2:2007, EN61000-4-2,
EN61000-4-3, EN61000-4-8, and EN55011 with a “Certification of Test” issued
by The Compliance Management Group on June 28, 2012.
6. Sample volume study:
The effect of varying sample volumes previously evaluated in the Nova Max Plus
Blood glucose and β-ketone submission (k091547).
7. Infection control:
The device system is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy
studies were performed on the materials comprising the meter and lancing device
by an outside commercial testing demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis
B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, Clorox Germicidal Wipes, EPA Reg.
No. 67619-12. Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor
demonstrating that there was not change in performance or external materials of
the meter and lancing device after 1,095 times of cleaning and disinfection cycles
for the meter and 300 times for the lancing device, using Clorox Germicidal
Wipes, EPA Reg. No. 67619-12 disinfectant wipes, to simulate 3 years of use by
lay users. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated
cleaning and disinfection procedures.
8. Readability: A Flesch-Kincaid analysis was conducted and the resulting grade
level at which the device labeling is written is as follows:
Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level
Labeling Score
User’s Manual 6.0
Glucose Test Strip Insert 7.0
Ketone Test Strip Insert 6.8
