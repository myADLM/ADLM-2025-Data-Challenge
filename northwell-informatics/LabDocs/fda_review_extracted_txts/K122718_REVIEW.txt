I. Device Description:
The BD Veritor™ System for rapid detection of Group A Strep is a qualitative, lateral flow
immunoassay for the detection of Strep A carbohydrate antigen in a throat swab. In this test,
antibody specific to Strep A carbohydrate antigen is coated on the test line region of the. Assay
device. During testing, the processed throat swab specimen reacts with an antibody to Strep A
that is conjugated onto detector particles. The mixture migrates up the membrane to react with
the antibody to Strep A on the membrane and is captured by the line of antibody on the
membrane. A positive result for Strep A is determined by the BD Veritor ™ System Reader
when antigen-conjugate is deposited at the Test "T" position and the Control "C" position on
the BD Veritor™ System Strep A assay device.

L. Test Principle:
The BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of Group A Strep is a chromatographic assay to
qualitatively detect the presence of the Group A Strep antigen. For each test, three drops of
GAS Reagent 1 are added to a prefilled tube of GAS Reagent 2, the swab added and incubated
for two minutes. A filter tip is attached to the tube and three drops of solution are dispensed
into the sample well of a BD Group A Strep test device. After five minutes at room
temperature the device is inserted into the BD Veritor™ System Reader for interpretation.
The extracted specimens are added to the test device where Group A Strep carbohydrate
antigens bind to antibodies conjugated to detector particles on the test strip. The antigen-
conjugate complex migrates across the test strip to the reaction area and is captured by an
antibody line on the membrane. The assay utilizes a proprietary enhanced colloidal-gold
particle captured at the test line as the means for identifying the presence of the analyte.
The assay test strips are designed with spatially-distinct zones including positive and negative
control line positions, a test line position (labeled ‘T’ on the device) for the analyte, and a
background zone. The onboard positive control ensures the sample has flowed correctly and is
indicated on the test device as ‘C’. The onboard negative control zone addresses non-specific
signal generation and is not labeled on the test device. The remaining distinct zone on the test
device is closest to the sample well and the location is not labeled. This zone is used to
measure the assay background. The test kit also contains external swab controls to ensure the
assay has been performed correctly and that the entire system is performing as intended.

The BD Veritor™ System Reader is a portable electronic device used to interpret BD Veritor
lateral flow test devices. It is a battery powered electronic reader which uses a reflectance-
based measurement method to evaluate the line signal intensities on the assay test strip, and
applies specific algorithms to determine the presence or absence of any target analyte(s). The
reader determines the line intensity at each of the spatially-defined test and control line
positions, interprets the results using the scoring algorithm, and reports a positive, negative, or
invalid result based on pre-set thresholds. A liquid crystal display (LCD) on the instrument
communicates status and results to the operator. The reader supports the use of different assays
by reading an assay-specific barcode on the test cartridge. The instrument is not configurable
by the user and is maintenance free with a finite lifetime based on either the number of tests
performed, the number of days from first use by the end user, or a maximum shelf-life from the
date of manufacture.
The bacterial antigens detected by the BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of Group A
Strep test are carbohydrate antigens, not M proteins. Organisms classified as Group A Strep
are prone to minor point mutations (i.e., antigenic drift) of the surface M proteins. The BD
Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of Group A Strep test is not affected by antigenic drift
and shift because it detects the carbohydrate antigen and not the M protein.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Repeatability
A study was conducted to demonstrate the BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of
Group A Strep has acceptable precision near the Limit of Detection (LOD), and that
performance characteristics are independent of normal variances that occur between
operator to operator and day to day activities.
The sponsor conducted the study over a period of 12 days with two different operators in
order to evaluate the precision of the BD Group A Strep test. Each day each operator tested
a group of swabs samples that were blinded and randomized and ranged from negative to
5% positive, 95% positive and 100% positive. To assess the day-to-day repeatability, one
operator also tested 24 blind and randomized swabs.
Swabs were prepared in the same manner that the control swabs are normally prepared. In
this case the swabs were dipped in solutions containing various dilutions of Strep A to
achieve the requested levels. The swabs were allowed to completely dry and were then
pouched with desiccant. These dilutions were determined based on the criteria that one
sample be targeted around a high negative, the second sample was targeted to a low positive
sample, and the final dilution was targeted to a moderate positive.
All positive and negative swab specimens were masked and randomized prior to testing
with the BD Strep A test. For each test, three drops of GAS Reagent 1 were added to a
5

prefilled tube of GAS Reagent 2 and incubated for two minutes. A filter tip was attached to
the tube and three drops of solution were dispensed into the sample well of a BD Group A
Strep test device. After five minutes at room temperature the device was inserted into the
BD Veritor™ System Reader for interpretation. All processed samples were tested in
triplicate.

The results tables above indicate that similar rates of positivity were obtained within each
sample category by both operators for all samples tested and that the confidence intervals
overlapped indicating that the BD Strep A test met acceptable criteria for precision.
Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of Group A Strep was
evaluated at one clinical and two point-of-care (POC) sites. The panel was composed of 4
simulated Group A Strep samples. These included high negative samples (i.e., samples
containing a very low concentration of Group A Strep), a low positive sample (near the
limit of detection), a moderate positive sample and a negative sample. The panel was tested
by two operators at each site over five days. The results are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability:
Various types of transport media commonly used for the preservation and transport of
respiratory specimens were evaluated for specimen storage and stability with the BD
Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of Group A Strep test. Testing was performed using
dilutions of a liquid culture of S. pyogenes diluted to a test signal corresponding to a low
positive. BD determined that for a transport medium to be considered acceptable for
specimen storage, the BD Group A Strep test must generate a positive test for all spiked
samples. Spiked samples that generate a false negative result would not be acceptable for
specimen storage.
In this study, various transport media were stored at 2-8°C and brought to ambient
temperature prior to spiking. The two transport media and normal saline were spiked with
S. pyogenes to an amount corresponding to a low positive and tested in triplicate. 50 µL
were added to Veritor System™ Strep A combined GAS Reagents 1 and 2 (360 µL). After
one minute the processing solution was tested according to the Veritor System™ Strep A
Package Insert. The remaining spiked transport media and spiked saline were stored at 30°C
and in the refrigerator for additional time points. An amount of S. pyogenes corresponding
to the antigen concentration near to the cutoff was applied to dry swabs and dried for 2
hours at 18-25°C and RH ≤15%. Three swabs were extracted and tested immediately at the
2 hour time point. The remaining dry swabs were stored at 30°C and in the refrigerator for
additional time points.

Strep A antigen (associated with intact bacteria) was observed to be stable on dry Rayon
swabs up to 96 hours (the duration of testing in this study) either refrigerated or stored at
room temperature (15-30°C). Test values ranged between 50 and 100% of values observed
at time zero. In liquid Amies and liquid Stuart medium stored at 2-8°C Strep A antigen
levels were stable up to 96 hours. In liquid Amies and liquid Stuart medium stored at 30°C
Strep A antigen levels increased approximately 4-fold over 96 hours, indicating bacterial
growth under these conditions. In normal saline stored at either 2-8°C or 30°C Strep A
antigen levels decreased continuously with storage time. A 50% decrease was observed
between 24 and 48 hours. Testing within 72 hours regardless of transport conditions would
appear to be a reasonable recommendation for dry swabs and swabs in either liquid Amies
or Stuart Medium. Storage and transport in saline beyond 24 hours is not recommended,
Strep A antigen was shown to be stable either refrigerated or at room temperature on Rayon
swabs either dry, or in contact with liquid Amies or liquid Stuart media for up to 96 hours.
Normal saline is not indicated as an acceptable storage or transport medium beyond 24
hours.
Kit Stability Dating:
A combination of real time and accelerated was used to establish the current kit dating of 24
months at 2-30°C.
d. Detection limit
The limit of detection for Streptococcus pyogenes was established with the BD Veritor™
System for Rapid Detection of Group A Strep test. For this study, the limit of detection
(LOD) is defined as the lowest concentration that produces an approximate 95% positive
reaction when tested with 60 replicates.
Testing was performed on Lancefield Group A Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 12384,
19615 and 25663. A frozen liquid culture of S. pyogenes (4.4 x 107 CFU/mL) was thawed
to room temperature and serial ten-fold dilutions were performed using saline. For each
test, three drops of GAS Reagent 1 were added to a prefilled tube of GAS Reagent 2. 50μL
of each 10-fold dilution was added to the combined extraction reagent and incubated for 2
minutes. A filter tip was attached to the tube and three drops of solution were dispensed
into the sample well of a BD Group A Strep test device. After five minutes at room
temperature the device was inserted into the BD Veritor™ System Reader for interpretation.
All processed samples were tested in triplicate. The lowest ten-fold dilution that was
detected as positive in all three BD Group A Strep test devices was further diluted in two-
fold serial increments in saline and tested as described above to determine the LOD.
The Limit of Detection for S. pyogenes was calculated to be 1.0 x 105 CFU/mL.
The sponsor tested 3 strains of S. pyogenes to determine LoD.
Limit of Detection studies are acceptable.

To screen for potential interference, Group A positive samples were prepared to yield a
final concentration corresponding to a weak positive. All potentially interfering substances
were evaluated by spiking Group A positive samples with the concentrations listed in the
table above. Prior to spiking antigen suspensions, the solid interfering substances were
dissolved in water or DMSO.
Fifty microliters of each solution were added to the unitized tube containing GAS Reagents
1 and 2. The sample processed for one minute and the attached filter tip was snapped in
place. Three drops of the sample were added to a BD Group A Strep test device. After five
minutes at room temperature the device was inserted into the BD Veritor™ System Reader
for interpretation. All determinations were performed in triplicate.
Substances were considered non-interfering with the BD Group A test if the following
criteria were met:
· All three replicates showed a Negative result on the Veritor™ System Reader display
for Group A Strep using a Strep A Strep negative sample
· All three replicates showed a Positive result on the Veritor ™ System Reader display
for Group A Strep using a Group A Strep Positive sample
Of the substances tested in this study, none exhibited interference when either Group A
positive or Group A negative samples were tested with the BD Veritor™ System for Rapid
Detection of Group A Strep test.
Media Compatibility:
Various types of transport media and culture plate media commonly used in Strep A testing
were evaluated for compatibility with the BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of
Group A Strep test. The effects of frozen storage of transport media samples on the stability
of the antigen were evaluated in this study. The media tested were: Modified Amies,
Modified Stuart’s, Normal Saline and Phosphate Buffered Saline. The agar tested were
Tryptic Soy Agar with 5% Sheep Blood and Selective Strep Agar.
Of the four media tested in this evaluation, all four demonstrated the expected results and
met the acceptance criteria for both room temperature and overnight frozen storage
conditions. Therefore, this suggests that these four media are all compatible with the BD
Group A Strep test. Although the media were non-interfering, dry swab transport and
storage is recommended for testing with the BD Group A Strep test. Storage and transport
of Strep A specimens in liquid transport will likely dilute the antigen while streaking on

solid culture media may remove some organism from the swab, thus resulting in a lower
number of bacteria introduced into the extraction reagent.
No interference was seen with the agars tested. Interference studies are acceptable.
Cross-Reactivity Studies:
The cross-reactivity of various Streptococcal strains was determined with the BD Veritor™
System for Rapid Detection of Group A Strep test. Lancefield Groups A, B, C, D, F and G
were tested at 1X109 CFU/mL in triplicate and yielded negative results. Various
microorganisms (including bacteria and yeasts) that might be found in specimens were
evaluated for potential cross reactivity with the BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of
Group A Strep test.

Analytical Reactivity:
The reactivity of various Streptococcal strains was determined with the BD Veritor™
System for Rapid Detection of Group A Strep test by evaluating a panel of six
Streptococcal strains representing Lancefield Groups A, B, C, D, F and G. In this study,
Bacterial strains obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) were grown
on Trypticase Soy Agar with 5% Sheep Blood and further isolated by centrifugation and
resuspended in normal saline. Lancefield Groups B, C, D, E, F and G were tested at a
concentration of 1 x 109 CFU/mL. Fifty microliters of each diluted bacterial suspension
were added to the unitized tube containing GAS Reagents 1 and 2 and the attached filter tip
was snapped in place. Three drops of the extracted sample were added to the test well of a
BD Group A Strep device. After five minutes at room temperature the device was inserted
into the BD Veritor™ System Reader for interpretation. All determinations were performed
in triplicate. Analytical Reactivity testing was considered acceptable if the Lancefield

swab was inoculated onto a separate blood agar plate and then tested with the site’s
standard of care rapid assay.
Bacterial culture was performed following the procedure in the Manual of Clinical
Microbiology, 9th Edition: A bacitracin disk was placed on each BAP and the plates were
incubated for 18-24 hours at 35-37oC. Presence of beta-hemolytic colonies >0.5 mm in
diameter and any zone of growth inhibition around the bacitracin disk was considered
presumptive for Group A streptococci. Beta-hemolytic colonies from the BAP were
confirmed as Group A streptococci using a commercially available streptococcal latex
agglutination test. If the bacterial culture was negative at 18-24 hours the BAP was re-
incubated and read again at 48 hours. If beta-hemolytic growth was found at 48 hours,
preliminary identification and confirmation were conducted as described above. If no beta-
hemolytic colonies were found on the bacterial culture plate at 48 hours, the specimen was
considered negative for Group A streptococci.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Approximately 15% of pharyngitis in children ages 3 months to 5 years is caused by
group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus. In school-aged children and adults, the incidence of
Strep throat infection is about 40%. This disease usually occurs in the winter and early
spring in temperate climates.
N. Instrument Name:
BD Veritor System Reader
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Veritor System Reader is a small, battery powered, bench top instrument that is used to
read the Veritor lateral flow test cassette. After the extracted patient sample has been added
to the test cassette, the test is developed at room temperature for 10 minutes. The cassette is
then placed into the reader where it is scanned. The cassette is divided into distinct zones
where the analyzer reads the negative background, positive control, and the Influenza A and
B specific zones. The reader applies an algorithm to determine the background of the test as
well as the specific signal from the A or B test zones. The reader has a finite number of
reads and will prompt the end-user as the total reads approaches the lifetime of the unit.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes X or No___
3. Specimen Identification:
Not Applicable
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Not Applicable
5. Calibration:
17

--- Page 18 ---
The Veritor Reader is not configurable by the end user and is designed to have a finite
lifetime based on number of tests performed or shelf life from date of manufacture. Device
calibration is not required, however, a verification device is provided with the reader to QC
the device function.
6. Quality Control:
During the course of the clinical studies, quality control (QC) testing was performed for the
BD Veritor Group A Strep assay each day testing was performed. QC for the system
consisted of a verification cartridge for the instrument, a Group A Strep positive control for
the system and a Group A Strep negative control for the system. Results were not used if
the QC failed. A QC summary is shown in the Table below:
