I. Device Description:
The Tina-quant Lp(a) Gen.2 test principle is a particle-enhanced
immunoturbidimetric assay. Reagents are packaged in two bottles labeled with their
instrument positioning, R1 and R3. R1 is glycine buffer solution that contains BSA
and 0.1% rabbit serum. R3 is a suspension of latex particles coated with polyclonal
anti-human Lp(a) antibodies (rabbit) in glycine buffer.
The Preciset Lp(a) Gen.2 calibrator set consists of five lyophilized calibrators based
on a stabilized and lyophilized pool of human plasma. Vials are reconstituted with
water to yield approximate concentration values of 6.5, 12.5, 29.0, 62.5, and 90
mg/dL.
The PreciControl Lp(a) Gen.2 control set contains two lyophilized controls based on
a human plasma matrix. Vials are reconstituted with water to yield approximate
concentrations of 20 and 48 mg/dL.
All human material should be considered potentially infectious. All products derived
from human blood are prepared exclusively from the blood of donors tested
individually and shown to be free from HBsAg and antibodies to HCV and HIV using

L. Test Principle:
The Roche cobas c Tina-quant Lipoprotein (a) Gen.2 test system is based on a latex
enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay. Human lipoprotein (a) agglutinates with latex
particles coated with anti-Lp(a) antibodies (rabbit). The precipitate is determined
turbidimetrically.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
All studies were performed on the cobas c 501Analyzer
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Assay within lot precision was determined according to CLSI EP5-A2 with a
study that measured pooled human sera samples (7.0, 16.1, 30.9 and 79.4
mg/dL) and plasma-based control samples using one lot of reagent in two
aliquots per run and 2 runs per day for 21 days.
The 20 day results for the single site are summarized below as sample overall
mean Lp(a) concentration in mg/dL, computed SDs and %CVs for within run
precision and total precision between runs and between days.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity of this Lp(a) assay for pooled human sera and pooled human plasma
samples was assessed according to CLSI EP6- A, Evaluation of the Linearity
of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach, in one run
using one lot of reagents with each sample tested in triplicate. Two separate
dilution series of 9 samples each from high to low concentration Lp(a) were
prepared by adding 0.9% NaCl to pooled human sera and to pooled human
plasma that contained Lp(a) at a concentration above the measuring range.
This yielded linearity samples with Lp(a) levels that spanned a range from 1.3
to 95 mg/dL.
A polynomial evaluation of linearity was used for the data analysis that
included unweighted regression models. Nonlinearity did not deviate more
than 10% from linearity for serum samples. Nonlinearity did not deviate more
than 2% from linearity for plasma samples.
A linear regression line and second and third order polynomials were fitted to
the data. Sponsor evaluated results and significance of the second and third
order polynomials by comparing to in-house acceptance criteria for deviation
from linearity.
The fitted linear models are:
Serum: y = 0.0008 + 1.0000x
Plasma: y = -0.2896 + 1.0039x
where y = Lp(a) (mg/dL) and x = theoretical concentration.
The sponsor demonstrated linearity across the claimed measuring range of the
device from 6.0 mg/dL to 80 mg/dL (from assay LoQ to upper limit).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Preciset Lp(a) Gen.2 calibrators are a set of five lyophilized pooled plasma
standards that are value assigned to an in-house primary reference standard
known as Standard Human Lp(a) and secondary in house standard via a
commercially available method. For routine calibrator lots, samples are
assayed in triplicate and value assigned according to the secondary in house
reference material and checked per value assigned controls.
PreciControl Lp(a) Gen.2 controls are lyophilized pooled human plasma and
set to low (20 mg/dL) and high (48 mg/dL) Lp(a) levels. These Lp(a) controls

are value assigned to the secondary in-house reference material by assaying in
triplicate on the cobas c 501Analyzer.
Stability:
Reagent, calibrator and control stability is based on shelf-life and open on
board stability studies and includes studies with storage at 35°C for 150 hrs to
mimic transport. The proposed protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed
and found to be adequate.
d. Detection limit:
LoB, LoD and LoQ studies were performed based upon CLSI EP-17A,
Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation
(LoQ).
LoB Test Protocol
One (1) blank sample was tested on two (2) cobas c 501 analyzers with three
(3) reagent lots for six runs of 5 replicates each run yielding 60 measurements
per lot.
LoB was defined as the concentration at which there is a 95% probability that
the sample is analyte-free and was calculated as the 95th percentile of 60 runs
which was the average of the 57th and the 58th value.
LoD Test Protocol
Five samples with low analyte concentration (up to 4X LOB) were measured
on two (2) cobas c 501 analyzers with three (3) reagent lots for six runs of
singlicates for each run yielding 60 measurements per lot.
LoD was calculated using equation 3 from CLSI Document EP17-A (page 17)
LOD = cbSDs.
LoQ Test Protocol
A low level sample set of six was measured in singlicate using 3 reagent lots
on two (2) cobas c 501 analyzers for 3 days with 2 runs per day. The LoQ
sample was observed to have ≤19.9% total error between the measured value
and the calculated value.
LoB = 3.0 mg/dL
LoD = 4.0 mg/dL
LoQ = 6.0 mg/dL
e. Analytical specificity:
i. Interference from endogenous substances/cross reactants.
7

--- Page 8 ---
Testing was performed to determine whether the presence of endogenous
substances such as hemoglobin, lipids (using intralipid as a mimic),
rheumatoid factor, conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin may interfere with
assay results.
Two human serum samples were used with Lp(a) concentrations of 20 mg/dL
and 55 mg/dL. Each sample level was spiked with varying levels of
interferent for a total of 11 dilution steps per interferent (8 for RF, 5 for
plasminogen and apolipoprotein B). The two sets of samples were tested in
triplicate and median values used to calculate % recovery (measured
concentration compared to Lp(a) concentration with zero interferent).
Observed maximum interference was 5% at the following levels of interferent:
Endogenous Substance/Cross Reactant Highest Tested Concentration
Hemoglobin 1000 mg/dL
In tralipid 2000 mg/dL
Bilirubin (conj) 60 mg/dL
Bilirubin (unconj) 60 mg/dL
Rheumatoid Factor 1200 IU/mL
Plasminogen 150 mg/dL
Apolipoprotein B 200 mg/dL
ii. Interference from common drugs
Two human serum samples were used with Lp(a) concentrations of 20 mg/dL
and 45 mg/dL. Each sample pool was divided into 17 aliquots. One aliquot
was not spiked with any drugs and was used as the reference sample. The
remaining samples were spiked with the respective amount of drug. Then the
concentration of Lp(a) was determined in triplicate and compared to the
reference aliquot. Lp(a) recovery was within ±5% for the tested analyte
concentrations.
No intereference was found at therapeutic concentration of any of the
following drugs: acetylcysteine, ampicillin-Na, ascorbic acid, cyclosporine,
cefoxitin, heparin, levodopa, methyldopa, metronidazole, doxycycline,
acetylsalicylic acid, rifampicin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, theophylline.

measuring range was diluted manually and automatically (1:3). The manually
and automatically diluted and the neat samples were measured with 3-fold
dilutions. All results were within 10%.
High dose hook effect studies.
Two samples with high concentrations of Lp(a) (higher than the measuring
range claim of 80 mg/dL) were diluted with native serum with an Lp(a)
concentration of about 1-2 mg/dL Lp(a). These samples are diluted in 11
steps. Each dilution was measured in triplicate.
No hook effect was seen up to 190 mg/dL.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To demonstrate substantial equivalence, a method comparison study was
performed on 159 human serum samples ranging from 6 to 79.9 mg/dL Lp(a)
were tested by the Roche cobas c 501 Tina-quant Lp(a) assay (expressed as
mg/dL) and predicate on the Hitachi 917 (expressed as mg/dL). The method
comparison study was performed according to CLSI EP9-A2 guideline.
Samples were tested in singlicate and no spiked or diluted samples were
included.

The sponsor provided additional method comparison data to support that
Roche Tina-Quant Lp(a) assay was not sensitive to the size heterogeneity of
protein (a) isoforms. Experiments were done using samples with Lp(a)
concentrations that covered the measuring range and compared to an ELISA
method that was standardized via Western Blot analysis to known protein(a)
isoforms.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor provides the following information in the package insert.
The defined threshold of Lp(a) concentration at which individuals can be
classified as being at increased risk varies greatly among studies, ranging from 20
mg/dL to 40 mg/dL. A Lp(a) concentration of 30 mg/dL, corresponding to the
75th percentile in a male Caucasian reference population is widely used as cut-off

point or threshold value.1,2
The European Atherosclerosis Society recommends screening for elevated Lp(a)
in those at intermediate or high CVD/CHD risk and defines a desirable Lp(a)
level ≤ 50mg/dL.3
Different Lp(a) levels can be found in different racial/ethnicity groups.4,5
Since Lp(a) levels are largely influenced by hereditary factors, they vary with
ethnic populations. Therefore, reference ranges have not been established for this
assay for different ethnic populations or disease states. The sponsor states that
each laboratory should investigate the transferability of the expected values to its
own patient population and if necessary determine its own reference range.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
