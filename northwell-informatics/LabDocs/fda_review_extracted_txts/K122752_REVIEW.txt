These tests provide visual qualitative results and are intended for in vitro diagnostic
use only. It is for prescription point-of-care use only and not intended for over-the-
counter sale to non-professionals.
These tests provide only a preliminary test result. For a quantitative result or to
confirm preliminary positive results obtained by the QuickTox® Drug Screen
Dipcard, Fastect® II Drug Screen Dipstick or Fastect® II PPX Drug Screen Dipstick
tests, a more specific alternative method such as Gas Chromatography/Mass
Spectrometry (GC/MS) must be used. Clinical Consideration and professional
judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test results, particularly when a
preliminary positive result is indicated.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
These tests are for prescription point-of-care use only and not intended for over-
the-counter use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable
I. Device Description:
The Fastect® II Drug Screen Dipstick with Propoxyphene and QuickTox® Drug
Screen Dipcard with Propoxyphene contain multiple drugs and drug metabolites in
addition to Propoxyphene. Propoxyphene is added as a new analyte. The Fastect® II
PPX Drug Screen Dipstick only contains the propoxyphene analyte. All dipstick and
dipcard devices are based on the principle of highly specific immunochemical
reactions between antigens and antibodies and all devices utilize a competitive
immunoassay procedure in which an immobilized drug conjugate competes with the
2

--- Page 3 ---
drug present in urine for limited antibody binding sites.
The Fastect® II PPX Drug Screen Dipstick, Fastect® II Drug Screen Dipstick and
QuickTox® Drug Screen Dipcard devices are standardized to detect Propoxyphene in
human urine at a cutoff concentration of 300 ng/ml. These tests can be performed
without the use of any additional instruments.
A control band with a different antigen/antibody reaction is added to the
immunochromatographic membrane strip and should always appear regardless of the
presence of drug or metabolite. The appearance of the control band during testing
indicates that the test has completed and the test is valid.

Precision studies were performed over ten days at three point-of-care sites
using drug-free normal urine spiked with drug standards to the following
concentrations: cutoff, ±25%, ±50%, ±75% and ±100% of the cutoff. A total of
30 samples were tested at cutoff, ±25%, ±50%, ±75% and +100% cutoff levels,
respectively. A total of 60 samples were tested at negative (zero) level.
Sample concentrations were confirmed by GC/MS. The intended users

cutoff concentration appears in the precision section, M.1.a, above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 84 urine specimens were evaluated with the QuickTox® Drug
Screen Dipcard and Fastect® II Drug Screen Dipsticks devices. Of these 84
urine specimens, 42 were negative urine samples with 5 of them between cut-
off and -50% cut-off levels. 42 were positive urine samples with 7 of them
between cut-off and +50% cut-off levels. Both the QuickTox® Drug Screen
Dipcard and Fastect® II Drug Screen Dipstick devices were compared against
the values obtained through GC/MS analysis. The results are presented in the
