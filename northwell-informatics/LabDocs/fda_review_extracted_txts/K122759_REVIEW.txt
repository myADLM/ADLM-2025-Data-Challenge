The test consists of two parts; a pre-analytical hair treatment procedure (to remove
THCA from solid hair matrix to a measurable liquid matrix), and the screening assay.
The screening assay is an Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA).
Sample is added to a well of the micro strip plate and enzyme conjugate is added,
followed by incubation. During this phase the enzyme-labeled drug conjugate
competes with drug in the sample for a limited number of binding sites on the rabbit
antibody-coated micro wells. The two bind in proportion to their concentrations. A
wash solution is applied to remove unbound materials. Enzyme substrate solution
containing a chromagen is added.
The reaction is stopped with an acid and absorbance is read using a plate reader at
450 nm. A background reading is also taken at 630 nm. Color intensity is inversely
proportional to the amount of drug presented in the sample.
Confirmatory Testing:
Confirmation testing of samples is performed on a 20 mg aliquot of the original
specimen. The hair is washed with methylene chloride and then dried under a gentle
stream of nitrogen at 40 ºC. After digesting the sodium hydroxide, samples are
processed by Solid Phase Extraction (SPE). Extraction retentates are derivatized with
PFAA (pentafluoroacetic anhydride)/HFIP (1,1, 1, 3, 3, 3 hexafluoro-2-propanol) and
reconstituted with toluene. The samples are analyzed using the GC/MS/MS Agilent
7890A Gas Chromatograph (GC)/ Agilent 7000 GC MS Triple Quad (MS) operating
in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode using deuterated internal standards.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed by taking commercially available materials
consisting of THCA in methanol to prepare spiking solutions at the following
concentrations; negative, ±75%, ±50%, ±25% and 200% of the cutoff. The
concentration of each sample was confirmed by GC/MS/MS. Each solution
was than used to spike 10 replicates of negative hair samples. Intra-assay
precision was performed in one run and inter-assay precision was performed
over 20 days. The results are present in the tables below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To assess linearity of the confirmation method, a series of standards were
extracted and analyzed and compared to the target concentrations. The Limit
of Quantitation (LoQ) was defined as the lowest concentration of analyte that
exhibited acceptable chromatography, ion ratios within ± 25% of the
calibrator, and a calculated concentration within ± 20% of the target value.
The LoQ for carboxy-THC is 0.005 pg/mg.
The highest reportable concentration (upper limit of linearity) was defined as
the highest concentration that exhibited acceptable chromatography, ion ratios
within ± 25% of the calibrator, and a calculated concentration within ± 20% of
the target value. The upper limit of linearity of the confirmation method for
Carboxy-THC is 100 pg/mg
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Commercially purchased materials consisting of (-)-11-nor-9-carboxy THC in
methanol are used to prepare stock solutions. Stock solutions are then used to
prepare calibrator and control working solutions. The cerillant (-)-11-nor-9-
carboxy THC standard is traceable back to NIST.
Assigned values of the prepared calibrator and control working solutions are
verified by GC/MS/MS analysis each time a new batch is prepared. The
calibrator must fall with 10% of the targeted concentration.
Protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable.
When stored refrigerated in an amber bottle the shelf life is 12 months for
both the controls and calibrators. Open-vial stability is also 12 months for
both.
Shipping Study:
A total number of 201 previously confirmed THCA positive and negative
head and body hair samples were used in the study. A variety of hair color and
curvatures were tested. Four separate shipping boxes each containing 25
previously screened negative samples , 25 previously confirmed positive

samples were stored in a freezer at approximately -5ºC for approximately 15
hours then heated to approximately 38ºC for a period of approximately six
hours. This represented exposure to extreme temperatures.
Each box was then shipped to a different location in the US. The boxes were
held for two days at each location than shipped back.
The samples were run on both the screening method and GC/MS before and
after shipping. Results from the screening method showed that samples that
were positive or negative before shipping remain the same after shipping. The
GC/MS average mean % of change in results prior to shipping and after
shipping was compared. The results show there is no difference in average
mean % change in the results.
Sample Stability:
Fifty head and body hair samples previously confirmed THCA positive or
negative were used in the study. A variety of hair color and curvatures were
tested. Samples were stored in a climate-controlled space and then analyzed a
second time approximately 1 and 2.5 years later. The average mean % of
change in results prior from first analysis to second analysis was -30.7% and -
47.4%%. The results are shown in the table below:

Structurally unrelated:
Negative head hair extracts were spiked with phencyclidine to -50%, 125%
and 150% of the cutoff. Several (270) structurally related and unrelated
compounds were added to methanol to a concentration of 10,000 ng/ml then
added to the hair matrix tubes. Samples were evaluated in triplicate and the
listed compounds can be found in the package insert. Compounds that are not
structurally similar to (-) 11-nor-9-Carboxy-delta9-THC 6 have not been
observed to produce an interference with the assay.
There is the possibility that other substances and/or factors not listed above
may interfere with the test and cause false results.
Hair Treatment:
The effects of various head hair treatments (i.e. bleaching, dyeing, relaxer,
shampoo, permanent) on the ELISA screening and GC/MS conformation for
both positive and negative THCA samples was performed. Study information
and results are provided separately below for effects on positive samples and
effects on negative samples.

Effect on Negative Samples:
Fifty two specimens previously confirmed negative for THCA and each
sample was divided into 2 aliquots. One aliquot of each sample were
randomly assigned into one of 10 groups, 11-14 samples in each group and
subjected to the treatment. ELSIA Absorbance readings before and after
treatment were compared. GC/MS measurements before and after treatment
were also compared. Of the 52 samples 48 samples remained negative after
treatment. The percent difference between the mean normalized absorbance
values of the treated and untreated groups for all treatments was -19%.
Conclusion:
Bleach and relaxer treatments had the greatest effect on positive samples
resulting in an average decrease in THCA concentration of 19%. This was
followed by dying and permanents resulting in an average decrease in THCA
concentration of 16% and 14%, respectively. The mean effect of shampoos
was 6%.
Environmental Contamination:
Twelve head hair specimens of various hair color and texture were
contaminated with marijuana smoke. The samples were then split into two
additional samples and soaked in either water or saline. The washed and
unwashed samples were then analyzed by the confirmation method for THC

and THCA (Carboxy-THC). All samples were? positive by the screening
method. For the confirmation test, all of the washed and unwashed samples
tested positive for THC parent drug but negative for THCA. The sponsor
states that the THCA metabolite (Carboxy-THC) that is confirmed is not
known to be present except as a metabolite. Therefore, these samples would
have been reported as negative.
Preliminary positive hair sample results by the screening method could be due
to environmental contamination. All positive should be sent for confirmation
testing on a reference method to distinguish between true positive and those
samples that were positive due to external exposure.
f. Assay cut-off:
Analytical performance of the device around the claimed cutoff is described in
precision section M.1a above
2. Comparison studies:
The study was performed by comparing ELSIA results against the GC/MS results
on the same hair sample. A total of 421 donor body and head hair samples were
tested (152 negative and 269 positive). The results are presented in the table

Extraction Recovery Study:
Forty head and body hair samples that previously confirmed positive for
THCA were used for these studies. Samples were aliquoted in duplicate; one
aliquot was taken through the screening assay acidic-methanol extraction and
the other was taken through the 100% recovery extraction.
One aliquot for each hair sample was taken through the screening extraction
and assay procedures (described in the Test Principle Section above) up to the
point of evaporating the acidic-methanol extract. At this point, GC/MS
confirmation Procedure for THCA in hair was followed.
The method representing 100% recovery was accomplished by adding 1.0 ml
of 1N NaOH to 20 mg of hair and incubated at 70ºC for 30 minutes. The hair

sample is totally liquefied and the entire drug originally bound to the hair is
now dissolved in the base solution. At this point the GC/MS conformation
procedure for THCA was followed.
The GC/MS results of the acidic-methanol extraction were compared to the
results of the 100% recovery base hydrolysis extraction to determine the
relative recovery of THCA using the acidic-methanol incubation. The mean
recovery for the acidic-methanol extraction was 84%. The results are in the
