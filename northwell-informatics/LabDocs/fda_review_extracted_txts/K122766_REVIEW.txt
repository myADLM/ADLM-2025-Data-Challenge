transplant patients receiving Everolimus therapy.This in vitro diagnostic device is
intended for clinical laboratory use only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use.
See expected values section, below. The manufacturer also includes the
following in the package insert.
In addition, the manufacturer includes the following in the package insert:
On average, the assay is designed so that bias for patient samples relative to LC-
MS/MS systems is within 0 to ±10%. However, as with other immunosuppressant
immunoassays, caution should be exercised because results for individual patient
samples may vary (in a positive or negative direction) due to the difference in
metabolite accumulation or other errors.
The assay should not be used for patients who have recently been administered
sirolimus (until sirolimus parent compound and metabolites are fully cleared)
since the assay cross-reacts with sirolimus and its metabolites.
Certain conditions that can affect the parent compound to metabolite ratio in
patient samples may affect performance (e.g. bias relative to an LC-MS/MS
assay). For such patients, consider confirming results with an LC-MS/MS method
specific for the parent compound.
Test findings should always be assessed in conjunction with the patient's medical
history, clinical examinations and other findings.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Performance was evaluated on the Hitachi 917.

L. Test Principle:
The QMS Everolimus Assay is a homogeneous particle-enhanced turbidimetric
immunoassay based on competition between drug in the sample and drug coated onto
a microparticle for antibody binding sites of the everolimus antibody reagent. The
principle is based on everolimus-coated microparticle reagent agglutinating in the
presence of the anti-everolimus antibody reagent and in the absence of any competing
drug in the sample. The rate of absorbance change is measured photometrically at a
wavelength of 700 nm. When a sample containing everolimus is added, the
agglutination reaction is partially inhibited, slowing down the rate of absorbance
change. A concentration-dependentclassic agglutination inhibition curve can be
obtained with maximum rate of agglutination at the lowest everolimus concentration
and the lowest agglutination rate at the highest everolimus concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Performance was validated on the Hitachi 917.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Three levels of control samples containing everolimus and three patient
sample pools (from liver transplant patients treated with everolimus) were
assayed using two lots of QMS® everolimus reagents. Over 20 days, two
individual aliquots from each sample assayed by QMS® Everolimus Assay,
once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Each sample in the evaluation
was extracted separately. Runs were separated by a minimum of two hours.
Results are shown below.

Precision at external sites was presented within k100144.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity/recovery by dilution:
The claimed assay range is 2.0 to 20 ng/mL. Linearity studies were performed
by diluting a high concentration liver transplant patient sample pool to produce
samples with everolimus concentrations across the assay range. The dilutions
were made with whole blood hemolysate. The theoretical concentrations were
based on the high sample concentration determined by LC-MS/MS methods.
The theoretical target concentrations were calculated by multiplying the high
level sample concentration by the dilution factor. Samples were assayed by
QMS® Everolimus Assay using two lots of reagents. Values shown below are
the mean of 5 replicates for each lot.

Linear regression equation for lot 1 and 2 respectively were y=1.061x-0.148;
y=1.090x-0.375.
In addition, high concentration patient samples were diluted as described in
the package insert instructions. Recoveries of all samples were within +/-
10% of expected values.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators and Controls were cleared under k100144. Please see k100144.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of quantitation was evaluated using a (liver transplant) patient pool
with a low everolimus value was further diluted with normal human
hemolysate to prepare samples at six levels near and below 2.0 ng/mL. Target
values were determined using the LC-MS/MS system. Each LOQ level was
assayed with duplicate measurements, twice a day for 5 days. All
measurements were from separately extracted sample. Two reagent lots were
assessed. Data demonstrated that at the claimed LoQ concentration of 2.0
ng/mL, theupper 95% confidence intervals were within 20% CV and +/-15%
recovery.
Data supported the previous claimed LoQ of 2.0 ng/mL cleared under
k100144.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference and cross-reactivity were reviewed under k100144. Additional
drugs were tested tofurthersupport the new 510(k). The following
commonly co-administered drugs were tested: Sulfamethoxazole (to 0.525
mg/mL); Valganciclovir hydrochloride (to 0.036 mg/mL); Pantoprazole
sodium(to 0.015 mg/mL); Trimethoprim (to 0.045 mg/mL). Three levels of
everolimus samples were prepared by spiking everolimus into normal human
hemolysate: 1) Drug-free (0 ng/mL everolimus), 2) Low level (2.6 ng/mL
everolimus), and 3) Therapeutic level (6.0 ng/mL everolimus). The
potentially interfering drugs were spiked into these hemolysate levels for the
study.
Percent recoveries observed in this evaluation (based on test sample/ control
sample concentration of everolimus) ranged within 101-107%.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable – this is a quantitative assay.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed using 179 banked samples from
130 patientsliver transplant patients. (No more than 2 samples per donor
were included in this analysis and the two blood samples from single donors
were drawn at a minimum of 7 days apart). Patient time post-transplant
rangedmostly between 9-26 months. Co-administered drugs were largely
tacrolimus and corticosteroids. Donor samples were measured by two LC-
MS/MS Systems and by the QMS® Everolimus Assay using 2 lots of reagents
on a Hitachi 917 clinical analyzer. The regression analysis below is based on
single measurements per sample by each method. All samples were pre-dose
except for a few of the samples closer to the assay upper limit. Regression
results and bias analyses for this evaluation are shown in the table below.
(Results supporting the indication for kidney transplant patients were
reviewed under k100114).

4. Clinical cut-off:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The following is stated in the package insert:
The recommended everolimus therapuetic range using an LC-MS/MS method is 3
to 8 ng/mL for pre-dose samples. See therapeutic drug monitoring information in
the drug package insert.
The QMS Everolimus assay has been calibrated using a set of trough samples
from adult renal transplant patients administered everolimus in combination
with basiliximab and concurrently with reduced doses of cyclosporine and
corticosteroids, so that the average bias for this population across the assay range
should be within ±10% of the LC-MS/MS system used. However this may vary
depending on the nature of the samples, individual metabolite
concentrations and the specific assay used. Test findings should always be
assessed in conjunction with the patient’s medical history, clinical signs and
symptoms and other laboratory parameters. Assay values cannot be used as
the sole indicator for making changes in treatment regimen.
Values obtained with different methods cannot be used interchangeably due
to differences in methods and cross-reactivity with metabolites, nor should

correction factors be applied. Consistent use of the same assay for
