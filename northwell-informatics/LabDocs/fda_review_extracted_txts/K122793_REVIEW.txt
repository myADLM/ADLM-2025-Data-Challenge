L. Test Principle:
The method for quantitative determination of the LIAISON® Testosterone assay is a
direct, competitive, chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA). Specific antibody to
testosterone is bound to magnetic particles (solid phase) and testosterone is linked to
an isoluminol derivative. During the incubation, testosterone is dissociated from its
binding protein and competes with labeled testosterone for binding sites on the
antibody. After the incubation, the unbound material is removed with a wash cycle.
Subsequently, the starter reagents are added and a flash chemiluminescent reaction is
initiated. The light signal is measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units
(RLU) and is inversely proportional to the concentration of testosterone present in
calibrators, controls, or samples.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Following CLSI document EP5-A2, the sponsor evaluated the precision using
8 samples (2 serum controls and 6 patient serum samples) with concentrations
spanning the working range of the assay. The samples were run at several test
sites, using multiple LIAISON® Testosterone kit lots, and 2 runs per day for
20 days (N=480 measurements per sample). Results of within-run and total
precision are summarized in the table below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor performed linearity studies in accordance with CLSI EP6-A
guidelines using three high samples of each tube type (serum, SST serum, and
EDTA plasma). High endogenous or spiked samples were diluted to span the
working range of the assay. A total of 9 samples ( 1 high and 8 diluted) for
each linearity sample set were tested in duplicate on the LIAISON® analyzer.
Samples tested ranged from 15 to 1528 ng/dL. The observed values were
plotted against the expected values and linear regression was performed. All
three samples tested with each tube type yielded similar linear regressions. A
representative of each tube types are summarized below.
Serum: y = 0.9944x – 16.12, R2 = 0.9959,
SST Serum: y = 1.0189x – 14.59, R2 = 0.9965
EDTA Plasma:, y = 1.0057x – 13.19, R2 = 0.9913.
The data support the claimed measuring range of this device, 16 to 1500
ng/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The LIAISON® Testosterone Calibrators and Controls are
traceable to testosterone USP reference material.
Stability: Shelf life stability studies were performed with assay reagents,
calibrators, and controls and demonstrated that they are stable until the
expiration date shown on the product labeling when stored as instructed.
Calibrators and controls are stable until the expiration date printed on the label
when stored as directed and for 28 days once opened when stored as
instructed.
Calibration curve stability and reagent open vial stability were performed by
the sponsor and demonstrated that the calibration curve is stable for 7 days
and open reagent vials are stable for 28 days when stored at 2-8°C.
Value assignment: Kit calibrators and controls concentrations are assigned
through an internal procedure. Master calibrators are prepared from a stock
solution made from reference material whose concentration is determined
spectrophotometrically by the sponsor. The master calibrators are then used
to assign values to the kit calibrators and controls using multiple LIASON
analyzers with several kit calibrator and control vials over several run and the
mean results are used to determine the target values. The mean of the results
+ 2SD are used for establishing the control ranges.

--- Page 7 ---
Testosterone Calibrators have the following target values:
Level 1= 30 -50 ng/dL
Level 2= 680 – 920 ng/dL
Testosterone Controls have the following target ranges:
Level 1= 150- 250 ng/dL
Level 2= 560 -840 ng/dL
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of
Quantitation (LoQ) were determined in accordance with CLSI document
EP17-A. LoB was calculated using 5 blank samples tested on 2 LIAISON®
analyzers over three days using 6 runs with two reagent lots. LoD was
calculated using 4 low concentration samples, at and above the mean LoB,
tested on 2 LIAISON® analyzers over 3 days using 6 runs and 2 reagent lots.
LoQ was calculated using 8 samples tested on 2 LIAISON® analyzers over 3
days using 6 runs and 2 reagent lots.
The LoB was determined to be 3.1 ng/dL and the LoD was determined to be
9.8 ng/dL. The LoQ, which was defined as the lowest concentration for which
the CV is less than 20%., was calculated to be 16 ng/dL.
The claimed measuring range of the device is 16 to 1500 ng/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference:
Following CLSI guidance document EP7-A2, interference studies were
performed using two different concentrations of testosterone samples spiked
with a single concentration of 5 different endogenous substances (see below
chart) and compared to unspiked control samples. The two sets of matched
spiked and control samples containing each interferent were tested in the
LIAISON® Testosterone assay using multiple replicates (24 replicates for 80
ng/mL testosterone and 15 replicates for 200 ng/dL testosterone) with 1
reagent lot. HAMA (Human anti-mouse antibodies) interference was
performed using 5 HAMA samples with testosterone concentrations ranging
from 15 to 795 ng/dL. The sponsor defines non-significant interference as
bias within 10% between the spiked and the control samples. Results of non-
significant interference are summarized in the table below.

In addition, common pharmaceutical compounds were spiked into native
human serum samples and tested with the LIAISON ® Testosterone assay.
Two serum samples pools containing approximately 80 ng/dL and 200 ng/dL
testosterone were spiked with potential interferents. The reference sample
(control) without interferent was spiked with the respective amount of solvent.
