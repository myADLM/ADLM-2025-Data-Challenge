The Advin Multi-Drug Screen Test consists of three formats: a Cassette, a Dip Card and a
Cup, which may be configured in any combination of the drug analytes listed in the
above table.
Advin Multi-Drug Screen Test is used to obtain a visual, qualitative, preliminary test
result for prescription use in point of care sites, laboratory settings, and is also intended
for workplaces and over-the-counter use. The Propoxyphene test strip is not intended for
over-the-counter use.
The Advin Multi-Drug Screen Test will yield preliminary positive results when
prescription drugs TCA, Barbiturates and Benzodiazepine, Methadone, Buprenorphine
and Opiates are ingested, even at or above therapeutic doses. There are no uniformly
recognized drug levels for TCA, Barbiturates and Benzodiazepine in urine.
The Advin Multi-Drug Screen Test provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A
more specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed
analytical test result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), Liquid
Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry/Mass (LC/MS/MS) and High Performance Liquid
Chromatography (HPLC) are the preferred confirmatory methods. Clinical consideration
and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly
in the evaluation of a preliminary positive test result.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
This assay is intended for prescription use and over the counter use
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable; this is a visually read single use device
I. Device Description:
The Advin Multi-Drug Screen Test consists of multi-drug test strips with one or two drug
tests on each strip. Each of the two-drug test strips detects two drugs. Each two-drug test
strip can also be formulated into two 1-drug test strip, where each test strip only detects one
drug. The Advin Multi-Drug Screen Test has three types of test formats: a Cassette, a Dip
Card and a Cup. All three formats use identical test strips made with same chemical
formulation and manufacturing procedures.
The differences between the test formats are that (1) the Cassette format has a plastic cassette
to hold the test strip; urine sample can be applied onto the sample well; (2) the Dip Card has
a plastic card to hold the strips for dipping and a cap to expose the sample pads; and (3) the
Cup format has an integrated cup with lid to hold the strips.

L. Test Principle:
The Advin Multi–Drug Screen Test is a lateral flow immunochromatographic competitive
binding assay and is intended for prescription, workplace and OTC use. It is used as in vitro
diagnostic to visually and qualitatively detect some of the most common drugs of abuse
and/or their metabolites in human urine specimens. The test is based on the principle of
competitive binding antigen-antibody immunochemistry. Urine migrates via capillary action
along the nitrocellulose (NC) membrane strip pre-coated with a drug-protein conjugate band
on the test line region and a colored antibody-colloidal gold conjugate pad, and rehydrates
the antibody colloidal gold conjugate on test strip. This urine-gold conjugate mixture then
migrates along the NC membrane to the immobilized drug-protein band. When a drug is
absent in the urine, the colored antibody-colloidal gold conjugate and immobilized drug-
protein bind specifically to form a visible color line on the test region. A drug-positive urine
specimen will not generate a colored-line in the designated test region. To serve as a
procedural control, a colored-line will always appear at the control region, indicating that
proper volume of urine specimen has been added and membrane wicking has occurred.
These visual read tests are performed without the use of an instrument.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the device was characterized at three Physician’s Lab Office (POL) sites
using office personnel of varying educational backgrounds and laboratory experience.
Several samples were prepared for this study using drug-free urine specimens
collected and pooled from volunteers. Drug standards were spiked into the drug-free
urine to the following drug concentrations: 0% cutoff, -50% cutoff, - 25% cutoff, at
cutoff, +25% cutoff and +50% cutoff. Each concentration was confirmed with
GC/MS. Each sample was analyzed in 10 replicates by each of the testing personnel
at each POL site, using each of the three assay formats. Results are presented below
for each test format.

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross Reactivity Study:
Each compound was tested for cross reactivity with certain compounds, drugs, and
drug metabolites. Each compound was spiked to drug-free urine to 100μg/mL. Each
sample was tested in 3 replicates. If any positive result was observed, the compound,
drug/drug metabolites were further diluted sequentially to different concentrations
and tested in triplicates until the highest concentration that generates negative result.
The cross reacting substances with the lowest concentration that produces a positive
result was identified and are presented in the product package insert. Results are
shown below.

Evaluation of Specific Gravity and pH on test results:
To evaluate the effect of pH value on the test results, negative urine samples were
adjusted to pH levels 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0 and 9.0.The samples were then spiked
with drug at +/-25% of the cutoff values. Testing was performed on 3 lots/device (dip
card, cassette and cup).
To evaluate the effect of specific gravity, samples specific gravities of 1.010, 1.020,
and 1.030, were spiked with drug at +/-25% of the cut-off values. Testing was
performed on 3 lots/device (dip card, cassette and cup).
The testing results demonstrate that varying pH’s and specific gravities do not affect
urine testing results around each analyte cut-off.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off characterization study results can be found in the precision section of this
summary.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
In order to characterize performance of the Advin Multi–Drug Screen Tests compared
with Mass Spectrometry testing, forty drug–free urine samples were collected from
presumed non-user volunteers and at least 40 drug positive unaltered urine specimens
for each drug test were obtained from several reference labs. Each specimen was
tested with Advin Multi–Drug Screen Test Cassette, Dip card and Cup by 3 operators
at 1 POC site. Results are presented below.

Consumer Study:
Drug-free urine samples were spiked with following different drugs to different
concentrations: +/ 50% cutoff, +/-25% cutoff and 0% cutoff. Each solution was
labeled with different code numbers.
One hundred male and female persons age 18 or older participated in the lay person
user study for the Advin Multi -Drug Screen Test. Each participant performed 2–5
tests on provided specimens with each of the three formats of Advin Multi-Drug
Screen Test (Cassette, Dip Card and Cup) by following the instructions in the product
package inserts. The test solutions were blinded and randomized for different test
formats. Each level of the drug solutions was randomly tested with 20- 24 replicates.
Over 100 test results for a total of 6 drug concentration levels were obtained from the
lay users study. Study participants recorded the test results on provided data sheets.
Results are shown below.

A post-test survey of volunteers showed that 100% thought that the test was easy to
use and easy to read. A Flesh-Kincaid reading analysis resulted in a reading grade
level of 7.8.
Read Time
Drug standards at the concentration of 0, -50% and +50% cutoff level were tested in
triplicates with the Advin Multi-Drug Screen Test Cassettes, Dip Card and Cup
formats following the procedures described in the proposed package inserts. The
result was read visually as positive or negative at 5, 10, 30, 60 and 120 minutes.
Results showed that the test results are stable for up to 120 minutes.
Adulteration Testing
To demonstrate that the technicians at POC sites are able to follow the product
package insert to perform Advin urine adulteration test when the urine adulteration
strips are included in Advin Multi-drug Screen Test Cassette, Dip Card and Cup, drug
standards were spiked into drug-free urine samples at 0% cutoff, -50% cutoff, - 25%
cutoff, at cutoff, +25% cutoff and +50% cutoff, and bleach, nitrate, sodium chloride,
and glutaraldehyde were spiked into samples as adulterants. Each adultered sample
was tested in triplicates on each of the Advin Urine Adulteration test formats, by
three office technicians at three POC sites. Results showed that the Advin Urine
Adulteration tests were able to detect adulteration under these specific conditions
100% of the time.
