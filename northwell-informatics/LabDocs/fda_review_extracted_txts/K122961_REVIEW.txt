GC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and
professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result,
particularly when the preliminary result is positive.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
The sponsor has followed two FDA issued guidance: In Vitro Diagnostic Devices:
Guidance fore the Preparation of 510(k) Submission, HHS Publication FDA 97-4224;
Premarket Submission and labeling Recommendations for Drugs of Abuse Screening
Tests, Draft Guidance, December 2, 2003.
L. Test Principle:
The AMP 300 and MET 500 Urine Tests employ lateral flow
immunochromatographic technology, and are based on competitive binding for the
qualitative detection of d-Amphetamine and D(+)-Methamphetamine respectively in
human urine. Each assay uses a monoclonal antibody-dye conjugate against drug
with gold chloride, fixed drug-protein conjugate and anti-mouse IgG polyclonal
antibody coated in a nitrocellulose membrane. When the absorbent end is immersed
into the urine specimen, the urine is absorbed into the device by capillary action,
mixes with the antibody-dye conjugate, and flows across the pre-coated membrane.
When the sample drug level is zero or below the target cut off, the antibody-dye
conjugate binds to the drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test Region (T) of
the device. This produces a colored Test line that indicates a negative result. When
the sample drug level is at or above the target cutoff, the free drug in the sample binds
to the antibody-dye conjugate preventing the antibody-dye conjugate from binding to
the drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the device. This
prevents the development of a distinct colored band in the test region, indicating a
potentially positive result. To serve as a procedure control, a colored line will appear
at the Control Region (C), if the test has been performed properly because of the
antibody-dye conjugate binding to anti-mouse IgG immobilized in the Control
Region(C) of the device.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision study was conducted by three operators each testing one of the
three lots of the devices used in the study. Precision studies were carried out
for samples with concentrations of -100% cut off, -75% cut off, -50% cut off,
-25% cut off, cutoff, +25% cut off, +50% cut off , +75% cut off and +100%
cut off. Samples were prepared, concentrations of each sample confirmed by
GC/MS, and then each sample was divided in to 300 aliquots. The 300
sample aliquots were divided in to 12 sets of 25 (one set per lot per run for
each format). For each concentration, tests were performed two runs per day
per lot for 25 days. The results obtained are summarized in the following

good laboratory testing practice to confirm the test procedure and to verify
proper test performance, the sponsor recommends that the user test these
devices using external controls following the appropriate federal, state and
local guidelines.
Accelerated stability and real time stability tests were performed on three lots
of dip cards and cups for AMP 300 and MET 500 urine test devices using
samples at -50% cutoff and +50% cutoff, and negative urine. The stability
study results support the claimed shelf life of 18 months at 4 to 30 ºC. The
transport simulation studies supports that the devices are stable for 3 weeks
when exposed to extreme temperatures of -20 ºC and 40 ºC.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical performance of the device around the cutoff is described in item
M1f (Assay cut-off) below.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross Reactivity Studies:
To evaluate cross reactivity of the AMP 300 and MET 500 Urine Test
devices, the target drug, drug metabolites and the structurally related
compounds that may cross-react with the target drugs are tested with three lots
of the devices using both the Cup and the Dip Card formats. All compounds
are added to drug-free urine to a high target concentration of 100,000 ng/mL.
Compounds that tested positive at 100,000 ng/mL concentration were serially
diluted and retested until the concentration at which the initial negative result
is obtained. Two different groups of operators were assigned to test blinded
samples (three operators tested the Cup format and three tested the Dip Card
format). Each sample testing and reading is performed by a laboratory
assistant using a device from one lot. Each result is confirmed by two other
laboratory assistants with relevant experience. Percent cross reactivity of a
compound is calculated by dividing the cutoff concentration by the minimum
concentration required to obtain a positive result and then multiplying by 100.
Identical results were obtained with the cup and dip card formats for the AMP
300 and MET 500 Urine tests. Summary of the study results is as follows:

pH:
The pH of an aliquoted negative urine pool was adjusted to a pH range of 4.00
to 9.00 in increments of one pH, and was spiked with ±25% cutoff
concentration of each analyte. Two different groups of operators were
assigned to test blinded samples (three operators tested the Cup format and
three tested the Dip Card format). Each sample testing and reading is
performed by a laboratory assistant using a device from one lot. Each result is
read by two other laboratory assistants with relevant experience. Identical
results were obtained with the cup and dip card formats for the AMP 300 and
MET 500 Urine tests. The pH range of 4.00 to 9.00 does not affect the
accuracy of the cup and dip card formats for the AMP 300 and MET 500
Urine tests.
Specific gravity:
The specific gravity of an aliquoted negative urine pool was adjusted to 1.000,
1.003, 1.007, 1.008, 1.017, 1.019, 1.020, 1.025, 1.030, 1.031, 1.033 and 1.035,
and was spiked with ±25% cutoff concentration of each analyte. Two
different groups of operators were assigned to test blinded samples (three
operators tested the Cup format and three tested the Dip Card format). Each
sample testing and reading is performed by a laboratory assistant using a
device from one lot. Each result is read by two other laboratory assistants
with relevant experience. Identical results were obtained with the cup and dip
card formats for the AMP 300 and MET 500 Urine tests. The specific gravity
range of 1.000 to 1,035 does not affect the accuracy of the cup and dip card
formats for the AMP 300 and MET 500 Urine tests.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cutoff is established using 25 clinical samples ranging in
concentrations from ~ -50% to ~ +50% of amphetamine cutoff of 300 ng/mL
for AMP 300 urine test, and 25 clinical samples ranging in concentrations
from ~ -50% to ~ +50% of methamphetamine cutoff of 500 ng/mL for MET
500 urine test. Additionally, 125 drug-free urine samples were spiked with
amphetamine and 125 drug-free urine samples were spiked with
methamphetamine to prepare samples at concentrations of -50%, -25%, cutoff,
+25% and +50% respectively of AMP cutoff of 300 ng/mL and MET cutoff of
500 ng/mL. The true drug concentrations in each sample were read by
GC/MS. Each sample is tested with three lots of the cup format and the dip
card format by two separate groups of operators (one for the cup format and
one for the dip card format). Three operators in each group who are blind to
the samples, performed the test. Each result was confirmed by two other
laboratory assistants with relevant experience. The results of the assay cutoff
study are as follows:

MET 500 Urine Tests (both the Dip Card and the Cup formats) with the
GC/MS reference method. Eighty unaltered samples collected from a drug
addiction recovery center were studied using one lot of each format for each
analyte. These samples range from drug-free urine (10), < -50% cutoff, -50%
cutoff ~ cutoff, Cutoff ~ +50% cutoff and > +50% cutoff of AMP. Each
result was read by three experienced laboratory assistants. A summary of
results of the method comparison studies is as follows:
