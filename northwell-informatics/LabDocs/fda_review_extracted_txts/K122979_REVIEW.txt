I. Device Description: The VIDAS Lyme IgM assay principle combines a 2-step
enzyme immunoassay sandwich method with a final fluorescent detection (ELFA). The
Solid Phase Receptacle (SPR®) serves as the solid phase as well as the pipetting device
for the assay. Reagents for the assay are ready-to-use and predispensed in the sealed
reagent strips. All of the assay steps are performed automatically by the instrument. The
reaction medium is cycled in and out of the SPR several times.
After a preliminary wash step and a sample dilution step, the antibodies to B. burgdorferi
present in the specimen will bind to the B. burgdorferi specific recombinant proteins
coating the interior of the SPR. Unbound sample components are washed away. Anti-
human IgM antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase will attach to the
immunocomplex bound to the SPR wall.
A final wash step removes unbound conjugate. During the final detection step, the
substrate (4-Methyl-umbelliferyl phosphate) is cycled in and out of the SPR. The
conjugate enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of this substrate into a fluorescent product (4-
Methyl-umbelliferone) the fluorescence of which is measured at 450 nm. The intensity
of the fluorescence is proportional to the quantity of anti-B.burgdorferi IgM antibody
present in the sample.
At the end of the VIDAS Lyme IgM assay, results are automatically calculated by the
instrument. A test value is generated and a report is printed.

Interfering Substances: Interferences were studied according to the
recommendations of CLSI® document EP7-A2. None of the following factors
have been found to significantly influence this assay:
- hemolysis (after spiking samples with hemoglobin:
5 g/L [monomer]),
- lipemia (after spiking samples with lipids: 30 g/L equivalent in
triglycerides),
- bilirubinemia (after spiking samples with bilirubin:
0.3 g/L),
- human albumin (after spiking samples with albumin up to 60 g/L).
It is recommended not to use samples that are hemolyzed, lipemic or icteric and,
if possible, to collect a new sample.
f. Assay cut-off: The clinical cut-off of the assay was determined using a
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. 211 negative sera
and 211 positive sera were used to determine the cut-off value that gave the
best discrimination between the sensitivity and the specificity of the assay.
The cut-off index value for VIDAS Lyme IgM was determined to be equal to
0.12.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method Comparison: A prospective study was performed on 975 fresh or
frozen prospectively collected sera submitted for routine Lyme disease testing
from an endemic area of the United States. Testing was performed in three
laboratories. At each laboratory, the samples were tested in parallel using a
commercially available Lyme IgM EIA method (predicate) and the VIDAS Lyme
IgM assay. Positive % Agreement (PPA) is calculated for the positives and
equivocals together since the 2-tier testing does not make a distinction and calls
for both of them to be tested by Western Blot. Combined results from the three
sites are shown below:

2-tier Lyme disease testing scheme, the VIDAS Lyme IgM positive and equivocal
results and the predicate Lyme IgM positive and equivocal results were confirmed
using a commercially available Lyme IgM Western Blot method. The percent

Matrix Equivalency: A matrix equivalency study for the claimed sample matrix
types (serum and plasma) and tube types (a dry serum tube, a separation gel
serum tube, a sodium heparinate plasma tube and a lithium heparinate plasma
tube) was performed by testing thirty five samples with Index values covering the
dynamic range of the assay. A 24% (2 x 12%) allowable total error was used
when the VIDAS Lyme IgM index was > 0.10. At or below a 0.10 VIDAS Lyme
IgM index, the allowable total error of 0.024 in terms of absolute difference was

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Expected values: The following tables summarize the expected (observed) values
for the sensitivity, analytical specificity, and method comparison studies performed
with VIDAS Lyme IgM assay.
Sensitivity study: The table below shows the results of testing with the VIDAS
Lyme IgM assay (LYM) using a population of 202 patients with case-defined Lyme
disease. This population was 65.3% male, 34.7% female with a mean age of 48
years. The VIDAS LYM test values ranged from 0.00 to 5.87 with overall positivity
of 59.4%. The VIDAS Lyme IgM sensitivity for stage I samples increased with
increasing duration of symptoms, with a positivity rate of 38.7% in the first week,
but reaching 70.0% by week 4 of symptoms. The positivity rate for stage II samples
reached 93.8% by week 2 of post-onset of symptoms. The positivity rate for stage
III samples was 66.7%.

Analytical Specificity Study: The table below shows the results of testing with the
LYM assay using a population of 200 apparently healthy individuals in the US. This
population was 56.0% male, 44.0% female with a mean age of 35 years. Fifty
percent (50%) of the samples were collected in a non-endemic area of the US and
50% in an endemic area. VIDAS LYM test values ranged from 0.00 to 0.72 with
overall negativity of 87.0%.

Method Comparison Study: The table below shows the results of a prospective
study conducted in an endemic area of the US. This study included samples from
975 patients subjected to routine Lyme disease testing. The population was 44.9%
male, 55.1% female with a mean age of 44 years. VIDAS LYM test values ranged
from 0.00 to 6.14 with overall positivity of 13.9%.
