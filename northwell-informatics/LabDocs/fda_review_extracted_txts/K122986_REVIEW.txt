4. Special instrument requirements: VIDAS and miniVIDAS instruments
I. Device Description: The VIDAS Lyme IgG assay principle combines a 2-step
enzyme immunoassay sandwich method with a final fluorescent detection (ELFA) (see
User’s Manual). The Solid Phase Receptacle (SPR®) serves as the solid phase as well as
the pipetting device for the assay. Reagents for the assay are ready-to-use and
predispensed in the sealed reagent strips. All of the assay steps are performed
automatically by the instrument. The reaction medium is cycled in and out of the SPR
several times.
After a preliminary wash step and a sample dilution step, the antibodies to B. burgdorferi
present in the specimen will bind to the B. burgdorferi specific recombinant proteins
coating the interior of the SPR. Unbound sample components are washed away. Anti-
human IgG antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase, will attach to the
immunocomplex bound to the SPR wall.
A final wash step removes unbound conjugate. During the final detection step, the
substrate (4-Methyl-umbelliferyl phosphate) is cycled in and out of the SPR. The
conjugate enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of this substrate into a fluorescent product (4-
Methyl-umbelliferone) the fluorescence of which is measured at 450 nm. The intensity of
the fluorescence is proportional to the quantity of anti-B.burgdorferi IgG antibody
present in the sample.
At the end of the VIDAS Lyme IgG assay, results are automatically calculated by the
instrument. A test value is generated and a report is printed.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision: For the precision study, 4 serum samples were tested in duplicate in
40 different runs (2 runs per day over 20 days) with 2 reagent lots at 1 site (n =
80). The precision was calculated following the recommendations of the CLSI®
document EP5-A2. The total precision data in the table reflect the 80 values
generated per sample for Site 1 and takes into account replicate, run, day,
calibration, and lot as potential sources of variation. The total precision for
controls includes between-run, between-day and between-calibration variability
and is lot specific.

- bilirubinemia (bilirubin: 0.3 g/L),
- human albumin (albumin up to 60 g/L).
It is recommended not to use samples that are hemolyzed, lipemic or icteric and,
if possible, to collect a new sample.
f. Assay cut-off: The clinical cut-off of the assay was determined using a
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. 268 negative sera
and 250 positive sera were used to determine the cut-off value that gave the
best discrimination between the sensitivity and the specificity of the assay.
The cut-off value for VIDAS Lyme IgG was determined to be equal to 0.20.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method Comparison: A prospective study was performed on 975 fresh or
frozen prospectively collected sera submitted for routine Lyme disease testing
from an endemic area of the United States. Testing was performed in three
laboratories. At each laboratory, the samples were tested in parallel using a
commercially available Lyme IgG EIA method (predicate) and the VIDAS Lyme
IgG assay. Positive % Agreement (PPA) is calculated for the positives and
equivocals together since the 2-tier testing does not make a distinction and calls
for both of them to be tested by Western Blot. Combined results from the three
sites are shown below:

Second-Tier Testing: In accordance with Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
recommendations for use of a 2-tier Lyme disease testing scheme, the VIDAS
Lyme IgG positive results and the predicate Lyme IgG positive and equivocal
results were confirmed using a commercially available Lyme IgG Western Blot
method. The percent agreement between VIDAS and predicate Lyme IgG
positives and the percent agreement between VIDAS–predicate–Western Blot IgG
positives and Predicate–Western Blot IgG positives is shown below.

b. Matrix comparison:
Matrix Equivalency: A matrix equivalency study for the claimed sample matrix
types (serum and plasma) and tube types (a dry serum tube, a separation gel
serum tube, a sodium heparinate plasma tube and a lithium heparinate plasma
tube) was performed by testing thirty five samples with Index values covering the
dynamic range of the assay. A 24% (2 x 12%) allowable total error was used
when the VIDAS Lyme IgG index was > 0.10. At or below a 0.10 VIDAS Lyme
IgG index, the allowable total error of 0.024 in terms of absolute difference was
used. A Passing-Bablok regression was used to compare the results of each
sampling tube to the results of the reference tube, the dry serum tube. For all
conditions, the proportional bias was < 12% and no sample exceeded the
allowable total error. The comparison study results are shown below.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Expected values: The following tables summarize the expected (observed) values
for the sensitivity, analytical specificity, and method comparison studies performed
with VIDAS Lyme IgG assay.
Sensitivity study: The table below shows the results of testing with the VIDAS
Lyme IgG assay (LYG) using a population of 202 patients with case-defined Lyme
disease. This population was 65.3% male, 34.7% female with a mean age of 48
years. The VIDAS LYG test values ranged from 0.01 to 8.86 with overall
sensitivity of 64.4%. The VIDAS Lyme IgG sensitivity for stage I samples increased
with increasing duration of symptoms, with a positivity rate of 35.5% in the first
week, but reaching 80.0% by week 4 of symptoms. The positivity rate for stage II
samples reached 100% by week 2 of post-onset of symptoms. The positivity rate for
stage III samples was 90.9%.

Analytical Specificity Study: The table below shows the results of testing with
the LYG assay using a population of 200 apparently healthy individuals in the
US. This population was 56.0% male, 44.0% female with a mean age of 35 years.
Fifty percent (50%) of the samples were collected in a non-endemic area of the
US and 50% in an endemic area. VIDAS LYG test values ranged from 0.00 to
1.33 with overall negativity of 98.5%.

from 975 patients subjected to routine Lyme disease testing. The population
was 44.9% male, 55.1% female with a mean age of 44 years. VIDAS LYG test
values ranged from 0.00 to 9.18 with 13.3% positive samples.
