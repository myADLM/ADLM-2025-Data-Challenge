L. Test Principle:
Glucose in the blood sample reacts with glucose oxidase (GOD) on the test strip
and a DC Electrical current is produced. This current is measured by the Veri-Q
meter and displayed as the Blood glucose result. The strength of these currents
changes with the amount of glucose in the blood sample. The Veri-Q meter
automatically interprets this reaction.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The Veri-Q self-testing MGD-1001 and Veri-Q plus MGD-1001 meters are the same
meters that use the same test strip; however the systems, meters, and test strips have
separate names due to their different indications for use. Therefore, only one set of
performance data is presented below.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The Veri-Q MGD -1001 BGM system was evaluated for repeatability using
spiked or glycolyzed venous whole blood ( hematocrit level 30%-50%) at the
following glucose concentrations. (30 to 50, 51 to 110, 111 to 150, 151 to 250,
and 251 to 400 mg/dL).
Each concentration was tested 10 times each on 10 meters, using 500 test
strips from 3 test strip lots. Results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor performed linearity studies using adjusted venous blood samples
with 11 different glucose concentrations ranging from18.1 to 602.5 mg/dL (18.1,
27.8, 47.1, 56.9, 66.8, 85.5, 90.9, 164.5, 237.5, 310.5, 382.5, 455.0, 530.0 and
602.5 mg/dL) for the Veri-Q MGD -1001 BGM system. These measurements
were made using the reference method (YSI 2300 STAT Plus).
Each sample was tested in replicates of 5 on the Veri-Q MGD-2001 using 3 test
strip lots. The values from the Veri-Q MGD-1001 meter were compared with
those obtained from the reference method (YSI). The resulting data was
compared and the linear regression analyses were as follows:
Linear
Strip Lot slope Y-Intercept R2
Regressions
Lot. #1 y=0.9985x+0.1285 0.9985 0.1285 1.000
Lot. #2 y=0.9988x-0.0066 0.9988 -0.0066 1.000
Lot. #3 y=0.9999x+0.0213 0.9999 0.0213 1.000
Combined y=0.9991x+0.0477 0.9991 0.0477 1.000
The MGD-1001 meters display “Low” with glucose values below 20 mg/dL,
“Hi” with glucose values over 600 mg/dL.
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement
range of 20 to 600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor states that the Veri-Q MGD-1001 system is traceable to the NIST
SRM 917b glucose reference material. A method comparison was performed
using the candidate device and YSI as the reference method (see Section 2.a.).
Control Solution Value Assignment and Stability:
Value assignment: Three levels of aqueous control solutions are available for
use with the Veri-Q MGD 1001 test system: Level 1 (30-50 mg/dL), Level 2
(94-144 mg/dL) and Level 3 (280-420 mg/dL). Value assignment for use of
the control solutions with the Veri Q MGD-1001 blood glucose test strips is
based on replicate measurements using the YSI 2300. . The values for each
of the control solutions are assigned by repeat analysis using the Veri-Q
MGD-1001 meter and MGD-01 each test strips and the mean used to
establish the ranges for each control solution level which are provided on the
test strip vial label.

Control Solution Stability: Stability was assessed using real-time and
accelerated testing for each control solution level (Level 1, 2 and 3).
Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable to
support the shelf life stability claim of 24months and an open-vial stability
claim of 3 months when stored at the recommended storage temperatures of
46°F to 86°F (8-30°C). Labeling instructs the user not to refrigerate the
solutions.
Test Strip Stability: The sponsor provided a real-time and accelerated testing
protocol and acceptance criteria to verify the closed- (shelf life) and open vial
stability of the test strips. The stability protocols and acceptance criteria were
reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor claims a closed-vial
(shelf-life) of 20 months and open-vial stability of 3 months when stored
at 46-86°Fand 10-90% relative humidity. The labeling instructs the users not to
refrigerate or freeze the test strips.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range is 20 to 600 mg/dL based on linearity/reportable range
studies above in M.1.b.
e. Analytical specificity:
To assess potential interference the sponsor used venous whole blood samples
adjusted to three glucose concentration intervals of 30 to 50 mg/dL and 100 to
120 mg/dL and 480-520 mg/dL. Each of these samples was divided into a test
pool and a control pool and each of the potential endogenous and exogenous
interfering substances was added to the test pool. Each substance was tested at
a minimum of two concentrations, normal/therapeutic and high/toxic
concentrations. Each sample was analyzed in replicates of 5. The %
difference between the test sample and the control sample was calculated. The
sponsor defines no significant interference as ≤ ±10 mg/dL difference relative
to the control sample with glucose concentrations <75 mg/dL and ≤ ±10 %
with glucose concentrations ≥75 mg/dL. Results are presented in the table
below:

User Performance Study:
To assess the performance of the Veri-Q MGD-1001 Blood Glucose
Monitoring System in the hands of the intended users the sponsor performed a
study with 152 lay user participants. Following the user’s self-test, healthcare
professionals obtained a separate sample for the reference measurement (YSI).
Results were analyzed by comparing fingerstick blood glucose results from
the Veri-Q MGD-1001 system obtained by the lay user against YSI. The
samples ranged from 61 to 427 mg/dL as measured by the reference method.
The results of the Veri-Q MGD-1001 system relative to reference are
summarized in the tables below:

2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this line of product types:
Yes X or No .
The applicant has provided documentation that indicates the device was designed
and developed under good software life-cycle processes.
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied
directly to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger,
palm, and forearm only. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test
strip by capillary action.
5. Calibration:
The system is designed to be non-coding. The test strips are coded a test strip lot-
specific code. When the test strip is inserted into the meter it provides the
appropriate calibration code information to the meter, therefore, the user is not
required to enter any coding information or verify the coding.
6. Quality Control:
Three levels of aqueous glucose control solutions are available with this system
(Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3). Control solution Level 2 is provided with the kit.
The control solution readings are not included in the average of the patient results
when the ‘M’ or ‘C’ buttons are pushed after the measurement.
Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the
labeling. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip
vial label.
P. Other Supportive Device and Instrument Information:
1) Hematocrit study:
The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated using venous whole blood
samples with hematocrit levels of 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60% spiked with glucose to
achieve target concentrations of 42, 85, 127, 237, and 360 mg/dL. Three test strip
lots were evaluated and 10 meters. Each sample was tested in replicates of 21 for
each hematocrit level and glucose level tested. The % bias of the Veri-Q MGD
meter results relative to YSI was demonstrated adequate performance to support
the claimed hematocrit range of 20 – 60%.

2) Altitude study:
To evaluate the effects of altitude on the Veri-Q MGD Blood Glucose Monitoring
System a study was performed to simulate pressure and oxygen changes from
altitude differences. Altered (spiked and glycolysed) venous blood samples from
three donors were spiked to 3 glucose concentrations (63, 194 and 437 mg/dL).
The blood samples were tested using 3 test strip lots and 5 meters at the simulated
altitude and the results compared to those obtained with the reference method
(YSI). The results demonstrate acceptable bias to the reference to support the
claims in the labeling that altitudes up to 10,000 feet have no significant effect on
blood glucose measurements from the Veri-Q MGD Blood Glucose Monitoring
System.
3) Temperature and humidity studies:
The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies using venous blood
samples at target glucose concentrations of 42, 123, and 351 mg/dL to evaluate
temperatures ranging from 50-104°F and relative humidity from 10-90%. Four
combinations of the claimed temperature and humidity operating conditions were
evaluated (low temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity, high
temperature/low humidity, and high temperature/high humidity). Meter results
were compared to the reference method. The results support the claimed range of
operating conditions: 50-104°F and 10-90% relative humidity.
4) Sample volume study:
The sponsor performed a sample volume study to support the claimed minimum
sample volume requirement for the Veri-Q MGD-2001 system using blood samples
of 0.3 µL, 0.5 µL, 0.8 µL, 1.0 µL, and 1.5 µL at five glucose concentrations (45, 83,
135, 272, 452 mg/dL according to the reference method). The system displays an
error code (Er 3) when insufficient sample is detected. Results support the claimed
minimum sample volume of 0.5 µL.
5) EMC and electrical safety testing was conducted in accordance to EN 61326- 1,
EN 61326-2-6, IEC 60068-2-1, IEC 60068-2-2, IEC 60068-2-78, IEC 61010-1,
IEC 60068-2-64, and IEC 60601-2-101 and the certification was provided.
6) Readability: Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the results
demonstrated that both User Manual versions, inserts for both test strip versions
and the control solution package insert were written at or below the 8th grade
reading level.
7) Infection Control Studies: The device is intended for single- and multiple-patient
use. CaviWipesXL (EPA registration #46781-8) was validated demonstrating
complete inactivation of live virus for use with the meter and lancing device. The
sponsor also demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the
external materials of the meter after 10,950 cleaning and disinfection cycles (one
cycle includes one cleaning wipe plus one disinfecting wipe) and the lancing
device after 1,950 cycles to simulate 3 years of device use. Labeling was
reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection
