17. CLSI EP-6 Evaluation of Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A
Statistical Approach
L. Test Principle:
The On Call® Vivid Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System is a quantitative assay for the
detection of glucose in fresh capillary whole blood from the fingertip. Amperometric
technology is used for the detection of glucose from testing the strip (with whole blood
sample) on the meter.
Reagent consisting of glucose oxidase and mediator is deposited onto the reaction cell
section of the test strip with printed electrodes. When a drop of whole blood sample is
applied to the reaction cell on the test strip, glucose in the blood sample reacts in the presence
of glucose oxidase and mediator, and the reaction yields electrons. Thus, a current signal is
produced from the reaction and detected by the meter. The detected current signal is then
calculated by the meter, and glucose concentration reading is then displayed on the meter
display.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed within-run precision studies using heparinized venous blood
samples at five different glucose concentrations. Each sample was tested on 3 lots of
test strips on 10 meters. Ten replicates were tested per meter, test strip lot, and
glucose concentration, (N=100 per test strip) for a total 300 measurements for each
glucose level. Results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using 11 venous blood samples ranging in glucose
concentrations from 11.9 to 638.9 mg/dL (11.9, 28.0, 48.0, 78.7, 110.7, 168.5, 220.2,
326.4, 449.8, 549.4 and 638.9 mg/dL) as measured by the reference method. Each
sample was tested in replicates of 4 on each of 3 test strip lots. The values obtained
®
from the On Call Vivid Pro Blood Glucose meter were compared to those obtained
from the reference method. The results from regression analysis are summarized
below:
Lot #1: y=0.9998x+4.2445; R²=0.999
Lot#2: y=1.0202x+2.8045; R²=0.998
Lot#3: y=1.0318x+2.3263; R²=0.999
The results of the study support the claimed glucose measuring range of 20 to 600
mg/dL.

The On Call® Vivid Pro Blood Glucose Control solutions are traceable to the NIST
SRM 917b reference material.
Control Value Assignment:
Value assignment is based on testing the control materials on multiple meters and test
strip lots. Several replicates are performed on each level of control and a mean value
is obtained. The mean value is then compared to a target value which has been
established for each lot of control solution. Control solution ranges are provided on
the test strip vial label. The protocols were reviewed and found to be adequate.
Stability:
Control Solutions: Accelerated stability studies were conducted to assess the shelf-
life and open vial stability of the control solutions and test strips. Real-time stability
studies are still on-going. Unopened control solutions have a 24 month shelf life and
are stable for 6 months after first opening when stored at 2-30˚C (36-86˚F).
Test Strips: The sponsor claims that the unopened test strips have a 24 month shelf
life and are stable for 6 months after opening when stored at 25-30˚C (77-86˚F).
This information is provided in the labeling of the test strips and control solution
materials.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range is 20 to 600 mg/dL based on the linearity/reportable range
studies above. The low and high detection limits for this device have been set at 20
and 600 mg/dL. Readings below 20 mg/dL and above 600 mg/dL will indicate a “Lo”
and “Hi” on the meter display, respectively. See linearity study in Section M1b
above.
e. Analytical specificity:
To assess potential interferences with the OnCall Vivid Pro system the sponsor used
whole blood samples that were spiked to nominal glucose concentrations of 40-60
mg/dL, 80-120 mg/dL and 300-400 mg/dL. The interfering substances were prepared
at 2 concentrations to include normal (therapeutic) and high (toxic). Each sample was
analyzed in quadruplicate using three different lots of test strips. The sponsor defines
no significant interference as ≤10% difference. Results are presented in the table
below:

The sponsor has the following limitations in their labeling:
Acetaminophen, uric acid and ascorbic acid (vitamin C) (when occurring in blood at
normal or at high therapeutic concentration) do not significantly affect results.
However, abnormally high concentration in blood may cause inaccurately high
results.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To assess system accuracy, results from the On Call® Vivid Pro Blood Glucose
Monitoring system were compared to results from YSI Model 2300 Stat Plus Glucose
Analyzer (reference). Capillary samples from 105 participants with glucose
concentrations ranging from 40.0- 562.5 mg/dL (capillary) by YSI method were
analyzed. To obtain blood glucose concentrations <50mg/dL and > 400 mg/dL, 8
samples were allowed to glycolize or were spiked to achieve desired glucose
concentrations. Three lots of test strips were used in the testing. The results relative to
the reference method are summarized in the tables below:

N. Instrument Name:
On Call® Vivid Pro Blood Glucose Meter
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use only and requires a sample volume of 0.8µL.
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,
or mobile device?:
Yes ________ or No ___X_____
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?:
Yes _____ or No ______X__
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip. The
whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.
5. Calibration:
There is no calibration required for the On Call® Vivid Pro Blood Glucose meter. The
meter is plasma-calibrated and is an auto coding meter. The coding information is on
each test strip so the meter can recognize the coding information when each strip is
inserted into the meter.

6. Quality Control:
Glucose control solutions (On Call® Vivid Pro Blood Glucose Control Solutions) at two
different concentrations (control solution 1 and control solution 2)can be run with this
device. The control solution 1 and control solution 2 are not provided with the meter. The
ranges for the control solution are test strip dependant. An example of a lot specific range
would be: control solution 1 (93-139mg/dL) control solution 2 (285-427 mg/dL). The
meter has an algorithm to automatically recognize the control solutions to prevent control
results from being stored in the internal memory as a patient result. Recommendations
on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. The control solution
readings are not included in the average of the patient results. An acceptable range for
each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is cautioned not to use
the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Altitude Study:
This study was conducted at a single site to evaluate the effect of altitude on the On Call
Vivid Pro BGMS. The tested glucose range (obtained using YSI reference method) was
tested at 8 different glucose concentrations from 41.7 to 567 mg/dL at sea level and 35.7
to 525 mg/dL at 8,516 ft above sea level. The glucose results obtained obtained using the
On Call Vivid Pro blood glucose meter had acceptable biases to the reference to support
the claim in the labeling that altitudes up to 8,516 feet have not significant affect on
blood glucose measurements from the On Call Vivid Pro System.
2. Hematocrit Study:
The effect of different hematocrit levels on the performance of the On Call Vivid Pro
BGMS was evaluated using venous whole blood samples with 8 different hematocrit
levels (20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 65, and 70%) across the glucose measuring range (target
glucose concentrations 50, 100, 275, and 500 mg/dL). Three test strip lots were
evaluated and results from the On Call Vivid Pro BGMS compared to the YSI method.
The results support the sponsor’s claimed hematocrit range of 20 – 70%.
3. Temperature and Relative Humidity Study:
Operating Conditions Study:
The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies using venous whole blood
samples to evaluate temperatures ranging from 5˚C to 45˚C and relative humidity from
10% to 45%. In this study, three test strip lots were tested at 7 combined temperature and
relative humidity conditions (5ºC/10% RH, 21 ºC/ 10% RH, 45 ºC/10%, 5 ºC/90% RH,
21 ºC/ 90% RH, 45 ºC/ 90% RH, and 21 ºC/ 45% RH). Three blood samples were
adjusted to the following glucose concentration ranges: (40-60 mg/dL, 80-120 mg/dL,
500-550 mg/dL). Each sample was also compared to the YSI reference method. The
results demonstrate that accurate readings can be obtained at temperatures ranging from 5
- 45ºC and relative humidity conditions ranging from 10 – 90%.
4. EMC Electromagnetic Compatibility and Electrical Safety verification testing of the On
Call Vivid Pro Blood Glucose Monitoring System was performed and found to be
adequate.
5. Sample volume study:
The sponsor performed a sample volume study to demonstrate that 0.8µL of whole blood
is sufficient volume for the On Call Vivid Pro blood glucose meter system. For this
study, sample volumes ranging from 0.4µL – 1.0 µL were evaluated using three different
lots of test strips. The blood glucose sample results collected using the On Call Vivid Pro
blood glucose meter were compared with glucose values obtained with the YSI reference
method and supported the minimum sample volume claim of 0.8 µL.

6. Infection control:
The device system is intended for multiple–patient use. Disinfection efficacy studies
were performed on the materials comprising the meter by an outside commercial testing
demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen
disinfectant, (DisCide Wipes) disinfectant wipe (EPA Reg. No. 10492-4). Robustness
studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was not change in
performance or external materials of the meter after 10,950 times of cleaning and
disinfection cycles, using DisCide disinfectant wipes, to simulate 3 years of use by
professional users. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated
cleaning and disinfection procedures.
7. Readability Assessment:
A readability assessment was conducted on the user guides, test strip package insert and
control solution package insert. It was determined that the readability of the labeling,
using a Flesch-Kincaid analysis, were found to be written at the 7th grade level.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
