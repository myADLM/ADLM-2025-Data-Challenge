L. Test Principle:
The Veri-Q and Veri-Q plus MGD-2001 Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems are based on
electrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of capillary action. The systems
quantitatively measure blood glucose levels using glucose oxidase enzyme chemistry. The
electrons generated during this reaction are transferred from the blood to the electrodes. The
magnitude of the resultant current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the
specimen and the signal is converted into a readout displayed on the meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The Veri-Q self-testing MGD-2001 and Veri-Q plus MGD-2001 meters are the same meters
that use the same test strip; however the systems, meters, and test strips have separate names
due to their different indications for use. Therefore, only one set of performance data is
presented below.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed repeatability studies using venous whole blood samples
spiked or glycolyzed to achieve five different glucose concentrations (30 to 50, 51 to
110, 111 to 150, 151 to 250, and 251 to 400 mg/dL). Each glucose level was
analyzed in replicates of 10, with 3 test strip lots and 10 meters, for a total of 300 tests
per each glucose level, for each meter. Results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using 12 venous blood samples ranging in glucose
concentrations from 19.9 to 601.5 mg/dL (19.9, 29.5, 45.2, 54.2, 66.0, 84.3, 92.5,
154.8, 244.9, 325.0, 397.2, 465.6, 569.5, 601.5 mg/dL) as measured by the reference
method (YSI 2300 STAT Plus). Each sample was tested in replicates of 5 on the
Veri-Q MGD-2001 using 3 test strip lots. The values from the Veri-Q MGD-2001
meter were compared with those obtained from the reference method (YSI). The
results from regression analysis are summarized below:
Lot #1: y=1.0064x-0.753; R2 = 0.999
Lot #2: y=1.009 x-1.277; R2 = 0.999
Lot #3: y=1.0035x-0.8047; R2 = 0.999
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of
20 to 600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor states that the Veri-Q MGD-2001 system is traceable to the NIST SRM
917b glucose reference material. A method comparison was performed using the
candidate device and YSI as the reference method (see Section 2.a.).
Control Solution Value Assignment and Stability:
Value assignment: Three levels of aqueous control solutions are available for use
with the Veri-Q MGD-2001 test system: Level 1 (30-50 mg/dL), Level 2 (94-144
mg/dL) and Level 3 (280-420 mg/dL). Value assignment for use of the control
solutions with the Veri Q MGD-2001 blood glucose test strips is based on replicate
measurements using the YSI 2300. The values for each of the control solutions are
assigned by repeat analysis using the Veri-Q MGD-2001 meter and Veri Q MGD-01
test strips and the mean used to establish the ranges for each control solution level
which are provided on the test strip vial label.
Control Solution Stability: Stability was assessed using real-time and accelerated
testing for each control solution level (Level 1, 2 and 3). Protocols and acceptance
criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable to support the shelf life stability

claim of 24 months and an open-vial stability claim of 3 months when stored at the
recommended storage temperatures of 46°F to 86°F (8-30°C). Labeling instructs the
user not to refrigerate the solutions.
Test Strip Stability: The sponsor provided a real-time and accelerated testing
protocol and acceptance criteria to verify the closed- (shelf life) and open vial
stability of the test strips. The stability protocols and acceptance criteria were
reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor claims a closed-vial (shelf life) of
20 months and open-vial stability of 3 months when stored at 46-86°F and 10-90%
relative humidity. The labeling instructs the users not to refrigerate or freeze the test
strips.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range for the Veri-Q MGD-2001 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is
20 to 600 mg/dL. This range was verified by the linearity study (M.1.b).
e. Analytical specificity:
To assess potential interference the sponsor used venous whole blood samples
adjusted to three glucose concentration intervals of 30 to 50 mg/dL and 100 to 120
mg/dL and 480-520 mg/dL. Each of these samples was divided into a test pool and a
control pool and each of the potential endogenous and exogenous interfering
substances was added to the test pool. Each substance was tested at a minimum of
two concentrations, normal/therapeutic and high/toxic concentrations. Each sample
was analyzed in replicates of 5. The % difference between the test sample and the
control sample was calculated. The sponsor defines no significant interference as ≤
±10 mg/dL difference relative to the control sample with glucose concentrations <75
mg/dL and ≤ ±10 % with glucose concentrations ³75 mg/dL. Results are presented in
the table below:

To assess the performance of the Veri-Q MGD-2001 Blood Glucose Monitoring
System in the hands of the intended users the sponsor performed a study with 152 lay
user participants. Following the user’s self-test, healthcare professionals obtained a
separate sample for the reference measurement (YSI). Results were analyzed by
comparing fingerstick blood glucose results from the Veri-Q MGD-2001 system
obtained by the lay user against YSI. The samples ranged from 61 to 427 mg/dL as
measured by the reference method. The results of the Veri-Q MGD-2001 system
relative to reference are summarized in the tables below:

Alternative Site Testing Study:
To assess the performance of alternative site testing using the Veri-Q Blood Glucose
Monitoring System in the hands of the intended users the sponsor performed a study
with 100 lay user participants, who collected their own palm and forearm samples.
Results were analyzed by comparing blood glucose results from the Veri-Q meter
obtained by the lay user against the YSI 2300 reference value obtained by a trained
technician. The samples ranged from 53 to 443 mg/dL as measured by YSI. The
results are summarized in the tables below:

[Table 1 on page 11]
Time of day	People without diabetes
Fasting and before meals	<100 mg/dL
1-2 hours after meals	<140 mg/dL

--- Page 12 ---
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, palm,
and forearm only. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by
capillary action.
5. Calibration:
The system is designed to be non-coding. The test strips are coded a test strip lot-specific
code. When the test strip is inserted into the meter it provides the appropriate calibration
code information to the meter, therefore, the user is not required to enter any coding
information or verify the coding.
6. Quality Control:
Three levels of aqueous glucose control solutions are available with this system (Level 1,
Level 2, and Level 3). Control solution Level 2 is provided with the kit. The control
solution readings are not included in the average of the patient results when the ‘M’ or
‘C’ buttons are pushed after the measurement. Recommendations on when to test the
control materials are provided in the labeling. An acceptable range for each control level
is printed on the test strip vial label.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1) Hematocrit study:
The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated using venous whole blood
samples with hematocrit levels of 20 – 60% (20, 30, 40, 50, and 60%) spiked with
glucose to achieve target concentrations of 35, 92.3, 131, 245, and 375 mg/dL. Three test
strip lots were evaluated and 10 meters. Each sample was tested in replicates of 21 for
each hematocrit level and glucose level tested. The % bias of the Veri-Q MGD meter
results relative to YSI demonstrated adequate performance to support the claimed
hematocrit range of 20 – 60%.
2) Altitude study:
To evaluate the effects of altitude on the Veri-Q MGD Blood Glucose Monitoring
System a study was performed to simulate pressure and oxygen changes from altitude
differences. Altered (spiked and glycolysed) venous blood samples from three donors
were spiked to 3 glucose concentrations (65, 194 and 437 mg/dL). The blood samples
were tested using 3 test strip lots and 5 meters at the simulated altitude and the results
compared to those obtained with the reference method (YSI). The results demonstrate
acceptable bias to the reference to support the claims in the labeling that altitudes up to
10,000 feet have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements from the Veri-Q
MGD Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

3) Temperature and humidity studies:
The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies using venous blood samples at
target glucose concentrations of 42, 123, and 351 mg/dL to evaluate temperatures ranging
from 50-104°F and relative humidity from 10-90%. Four combinations of the claimed
temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated (low temperature/low
humidity, low temperature/high humidity, high temperature/low humidity, and high
temperature/high humidity). Meter results were compared to the reference method. The
results support the claimed range of operating conditions: 50-104°F and 10-90% relative
humidity.
4) Sample volume study:
The sponsor performed a sample volume study to support the claimed minimum sample
volume requirement for the Veri-Q MGD-2001 system using blood samples of 0.3 mL,
0.5 mL, 0.8 mL, 1.0 mL, and 1.5 mL at five glucose concentrations (40, 78, 142, 285, 467
mg/dL according to the reference method). The system displays an error code (Er 3)
when insufficient sample is detected. Results support the claimed minimum sample
volume of 0.5 mL.
5) Infection Control Studies: The device is intended for single- and multiple-patient use.
CaviWipesXL (EPA registration #46781-8) was validated demonstrating complete
inactivation of live virus for use with the meter and lancing device. The sponsor also
demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the
meter after 10,950 cleaning and disinfection cycles (one cycle includes one cleaning wipe
plus one disinfecting wipe) and the lancing device after 1,950 cycles to simulate 3 years
of device use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning
and disinfection procedures.
6) Certificates of Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing compliance were provided
for the MGD-2001 Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
7) Readability: Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the results
demonstrated that both User Manual versions, inserts for both test strip versions and the
control solution package insert were written at or below the 8th grade reading level.
