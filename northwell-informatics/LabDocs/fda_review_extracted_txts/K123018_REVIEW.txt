L. Test Principle:
ACE Glucose Reagent
Glucose in serum reacts with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the presence of hexokinase (HK) and
magnesium with the formation of glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP).
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) catalyzes the oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate with
NAD+ to form 6-phosphogluconate and NADH. NADH absorbs strongly at 340 nm, whereas NAD+ does
not. The total amount of NADH formed is proportional to the initial amount of glucose present. The rate
of increase in absorbance, monitored bichromatically at 340 nm/450 nm, is directly proportional to the
glucose concentration in the sample.
ACE Ion Selective Electrode (ISE) Module
The sodium, potassium and chloride are measured using ion-selective electrodes. Each electrode uses ion-specific
membrane to measure the difference in ionic concentration between an inner electrolyte solution and the sample.
The difference causes an electro-chemical potential to form on the membrane of the active electrode. The
measured voltage difference of the sample and CAL A are used to determine the ion concentration in the sample.
Two solutions contained in the ISE reagent pack CAL A and CAL B are used to perform a two-point calibration
of the ion selective electrodes (ISE)

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was confirmed for ISE and Glucose assays on the ACE Alera Clinical Chemistry
System by spiking serum samples with a high concentration of analyte, then diluting the
spiked sample with saline or water to obtain at least 7 levels that span the measuring range of
each assay. The assigned value of the highest sample was set to its mean value. The assigned
values of the other levels were calculated by multiplying the mean value by the dilution
ratios obtained from the manufacturer. Each level was tested in triplicate. The linear
regression correlation between the expected values and the measured values is summarized
below:

Glucose (mg/dL) 4 - 750
Na (mmol/L) 40 – 205
K (mmol/L) 1.5 – 15
Cl (mmol/L) 50 - 200
Automatic dilution study:
The ACE Alera Clinical Chemistry System can perform automatic 1:3 dilutions of samples
that exceed the upper limit of the glucose assay. To examine the accuracy of the auto-dilution
function for the ACE Glucose Reagent, serum samples were spiked with high concentrations
of glucose and were then either run directly on each of the ACE systems or they were
manually diluted 1:3 using system diluent (3 samples per instrument system in triplicate).
The results from the auto-dilution and the manually diluted samples, run on the same ACE
systems, were compared. All samples recovered within 10% recovery. The auto-dilution
function is not available for ISE analytes.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and stability: The ISE calibrator material was previously cleared under k933862
and the glucose calibrator was previously cleared under k930104.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor performed a detection limit study for glucose on the ACE Alera Clinical
Chemistry System, based on a modified protocol according to the CLSI EP17-A. For Na, K
and Cl detection limits, please refer to their linearity studies, as the sponsor determined that
the limits of detection are defined by the linear range studies for these assays on the ACE
Alera Clinical Chemistry System.
Limit of Blank (LoB) determination was based on 60 replicate glucose measurements of 5
blank samples (human serum albumin) on 2 ACE Alera Clinical Chemistry Systems, and 1
lot of assay reagents. The limit of blank, as determined by the upper 95th percentile was 0.80
mg/dL for the ACE Alera Clinical Chemistry System.
Limit of Detection (LoD) determination was based on 60 replicate glucose measurements of
5 low human serum-based samples on 2 ACE Alera Clinical Chemistry System, and 1 lot of
assay reagents. The limits of detection were calculated using the determined LoB value and
pooled SD values from LoD samples. The sponsor claimed that the LoD for serum samples

Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) determination was based on inter-assay precision of 20% for 40
replicate measurements of 5 low serum samples, per day for 5 days, on 1 ACE Alera Clinical
Chemistry System. The LoQ was determined to be 2.88 mg/dL for the ACE Alera system.
The sponsor claimed the following measuring range:
Analyte tested Assay range
Glucose (mg/dL) 4 - 750
Na (mmol/L) 40 – 205
K (mmol/L) 1.5 – 15
Cl (mmol/L) 50 - 200
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed according to CLSI guidance document EP-7A to
determine the effects from potential interferents on the ACE Glucose and ISE assays.
Various concentrations of interferents were spiked into serum pools containing glucose,
sodium, potassium and chloride at normal and elevated concentrations. All samples were
tested in triplicate on the ACE Alera system. Seven levels were tested for each interferent.
The sponsor states that interference is considered to be non-significant if the bias between the
tested and control samples are within ±10% for each of the analytes.
The analytical specificity study results are summarized as follows:
No Significant Interference at or below the listed concentration (mg/dL)
Glucose Sodium Potassium Chloride
Bilirubin 26 50 50 50
Ascorbic Acid 6 6 6 6
Hemoglobin 1000 1000 125 1000
Intralipid 104 125 125 125
Triglycerides 525 656 420 420
Since lipemia affects all test results and hemolysis affects K results, the sponsor has the
following limitations in the labeling:
“Do not use hemolyzed samples for potassium since significant hemolysis may increase
K+ concentration because of high levels of K+ in erythrocytes.”
“Do not use lipemic samples.”
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were completed at 3 POC sites following CLSI document EP9-
A2. Samples were run on the ACE Clinical Chemistry System at Alfa Wassermann and the
results were compared against those gathered on ACE Alera Clinical Chemistry Systems at 3
Physician Office Labs. For each test method, at least 41 determinations were made in
singlicate for serum samples drawn from the same individuals on each platform. To test
across the assay reportable ranges, additional sets of 4 samples and 6 samples were either
spiked with analyte or diluted with saline for the Glucose and ISE POL studies, respectively.

3. Specimen Identification:
Barcoding or manual entry
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Samples are manually placed on the instrument either by sample tube or sample cup. The system can
run an individual sample or a batch of samples. Once tested the samples are removed.
5. Calibration:
On demand calibration. It is recommended to perform a calibration measurement after installing a
new or fresh bottle of reagent and/or intervals that are defined for a particular test. It is recommended
to recalibrate ISEs after installing a new lot of calibration solution. ISE calibration is required every 3
hours or when quality control results fall outside the established range after replacing electrode, and
after ISE cleaning maintenance.
6. Quality Control:
Controls are loaded onto the instrument manually by the user into the sample wells and are run
automatically by the instrument. Labeling recommends two levels of controls run daily.
