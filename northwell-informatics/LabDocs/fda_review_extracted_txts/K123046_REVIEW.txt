The ADVIA® Chemistry Lipoprotein (a) calibrator is intended for use in the
calibration of ADVIA® Chemistry systems for the ADVIA Chemistry
Lipoprotein(a) (LPA) assay.
2. Indication(s) for use:
See intended use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
For use on the ADVIA 1650Analyzer
I. Device Description:
The Lipoprotein(a) reagents are ready-to-use liquid reagents packaged for use on
the automated ADVIA 1650 Chemistry system. They are supplied as a 100
tests/wedge, 2 wedges/kit. The kit includes two reagents, R1 and R2. R1 is
glycine-EDTA buffer. R2 is a suspension of latex particles coated with anti-
human Lp(a) antibodies (rabbit) in glycine buffer.
ADVIA Chemistry Lipoprotein(a) calibrator is a single analyte, human serum
based product containing human lipoprotein (a). The kit consists of 1 vial each of
5 calibrator levels which are lyophilized. The volume per vial (after reconstitution
with deionized water) is 1.0 mL. Deionized water is recommended to be used as a
zero calibrator.
Contains human source material. While each human serum or plasma donor unit
used in the manufacture of this product was tested by FDA-approved methods and
found nonreactive for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antigen, and
antibody to HIV-1/2, all products manufactured using human source material
should be handled as potentially infectious.

L. Test Principle:
In the ADVIA Chemistry Lipoprotein(a) assay, sample is diluted and then mixed with
the R1 reagent (a buffer), followed by an addition of the R2 reagent (which contains
latex particles coated with antibodies specific for Lipoprotein (a). The formation of
the antibody-antigen complex during the reaction results in an increase in turbidity.
This turbidity is measured at 694 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
All studies were performed on the ADVIA 1650Analyzer
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the Siemens Lp(a) assay was evaluated according to CLSI
document EP05-A2. In this study, 2 human serum pools spiked with Lp(a) to
final concentrations 50 and 80 mg/dL and 3 samples of a serum-based control
material with approximate Lp(a) concentrations 7, 13 and 18 mg/dL were
assayed 2 times per run at 2 runs a day for 20 days. Experiments were
performed using two reagent lots on two ADVIA 1650Analyzers . The
sponsor provided representative results from a single lot that are included in
the table below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor assessed linearity with one run using one lot of reagents with
each sample tested in triplicate. Nine diluted samples with Lp(a)
concentrations evenly distributed were prepared by mixing a high Lp(a)
concentration serum pool and a low Lp(a) concentration serum pool in
varying amounts. This yielded linearity samples with Lp(a) levels that
spanned a range from 7.75 to 102.30 mg/dL.
The sponsor calculated linear regressions from mean observed versus
expected value using an unweighted regression model and observed maximum
% difference from observed values versus linear fit of 4%.
The fitted linear model is:
Serum: y = -0.18 + 0.99x
where y = Lp(a) (mg/dL) and x = expected concentration.
The studies supported the sponsor’s claimed measuring range of 10 – 85
mg/dL.
High Dose Hook Effect
Sponsor performed additional hook effect studies and demonstrated no hook
effect up to Lp(a) concentrations of 493 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators are traceable to in-house Master Lot calibrators of human Lp(a)
prepared volumetrically in human serum and value assigned via method
comparison to a commercially available device.
Each lot of calibrators is then traceable to the Master Lot via the ADVIA

Lp(a) assay tested in multiple replicates. Newly value assigned lot calibrators
are then confirmed through use in the Lp(a) assay by creating a calibration
curve and then testing Master Lot, calibrators and controls against this
calibration curve.
Reagent shelf life and on board stability protocols and acceptance criteria
were provided and found acceptable.
Calibrators are the same material as cleared in k011568. The claimed shelf
life (closed) is 36 months. The sponsor demonstrated open vial stability of 14
days at 2-8°C.
d. Detection limit:
LoB, LoD and LoQ studies were performed based upon CLSI EP-17A.
LoB Test Protocol
One blank sample was tested on two analyzers with 2 reagent lots for 4
replicates per run at 2 runs per day for 5 days yielding a total of 40
measurements per lot/analyzer.
LoB was defined as the concentration at which there is a 95% probability that
the sample is analyte-free and was calculated as the 95th percentile of 40 runs.
LoD Test Protocol
Five samples of the LoB pool were spiked with Lp(a) to yield samples with
low analyte concentrations of 3.6, 4.8, 7.2 and 9.6 mg/dL were measured on 2
analyzers using 2 reagent lots for 4 replicates per run at 2 runs per day for 5
days yielding a total of 40 measurements per lot/analyzer.
LoD was then calculated nonparametrically as the lowest level material in
which the 5th percentile equals or exceeds the LoB.
LoQ Test Protocol
LoQ was determined from the same 40 point data set used to generate LoD
with an observed bias of 12.4%. Sponsor provided data to support LoQ =
LoD.
Based on linearity studies and detection limit studies the sponsor provided
data to support the following claims:
LoB = 6.0 mg/dL
LoD = 9.0 mg/dL
LOQ = 10.0 mg/dL
e. Analytical specificity:

Testing was performed according to CLSI EP07- to determine whether the
presence of hemoglobin, triglycerides (using Intralipid as a mimic),
conjugated and unconjugated Bilirubin may interfere with assay results.
Three human sera samples were used with Lp(a) concentrations of 15, 30 and
50 mg/dL. Each sample level was spiked with increasing amounts of
interferents for a total of 5 samples with interferent with controls samples at
each level that were not spiked. Then the spiked and unspiked samples were
tested in duplicate and used to calculate % recovery (measured concentration
compared to Lp(a) concentration with zero interferent). Lp(a) recovery of
±10% of reference value was defined as acceptable by the sponsor.
Substance Tested Concentration
Hemoglobin Up to1000 mg/dL
Intralipid Up to 1000 mg/dL
Bilirubin (conj) Up to 60 mg/dL
Bilirubin (unconj) Up to 60 mg/dL
The sponsor provided information that the apo(a) isoforms that are
heterogenous with respect to size do not interfere with the assay. The assay
gives an accurate test result for Lp(a) across apo(a) isoforms. The sponsor
also provided information that plasminogen and apolipoprotein B do not
interfere with the assay up to concentrations of 150 mg/dL and 225 mg/dL
respectively.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To characterize correlation to the predicate, a method comparison study was
performed with 68 human sera samples with concentrations ranging from 11 –
81.6 mg/dL tested by the Siemens ADVIA Lp(a) Assay (expressed as mg/dL)
and predicate on the Hitachi 717 (expressed as mg/dL). Samples were tested
in duplicate and the first replicate analyzed by linear regression.
Data were analyzed by least squares linear regression with 95% CI indicated
in parentheses:
slope = 1.01 (1.00 – 1.02)
intercept = - 1.02 (-1.47 – 0.57)
r = 0.99

b. Matrix comparison
To characterize correlation to the predicate for lithium heparin plasma, a
method comparison study was performed with 44 human plasma samples with
Lp(a) concentrations ranging from 12 – 80.1 mg/dL tested by the Siemens
ADVIA Lp(a) Assay (expressed as mg/dL) and the predicate device on the
Hitachi 717 (expressed as mg/dL). Samples were tested in duplicate and the
first replicate analyzed by linear regression.
Data were analyzed by least squares linear regression with 95% CI indicated
in parentheses:
slope = 1.01 (0.99 – 1.02)
intercept = -0.98 (-1.49 – -0.47),
r = 0.99.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor states the individual concentration of Lp(a) in the serum depends on
genetic factors. The range of variation in a population is relatively large.1 Lp(a)
values are known to vary with ethnicity. The sponsor recommends a cutoff for
this assay of < 30 mg/dL, however this is to be considered as a guideline. It is
also recommended that each laboratory should determine its own reference ranges
for the diagnostic evaluation of patient results.
