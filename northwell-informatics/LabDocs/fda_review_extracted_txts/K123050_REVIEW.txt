--- Page 3 ---
The Test Strip kit consists of one test device in a foil pouch and a package insert. It is a lateral
flow chromatographic immunoassay. When the absorbent end is immersed into the urine
specimen, the urine sample is introduced into a chromatographic membrane. As it contacts the
membrane, the sample dissolves the lyophilized conjugate. In a reactive sample, the HCG
antigen will attach to the antibodies in the colloidal solution. As the conjugate moves forward
on the membrane, anti-HCG will attach to the antibody affixed on the test zone (“T”) will bind
the HCG-gold conjugate complex, forming a pink line (“T”). Any sample will cause a pink
line to appear in the control zone (“C”). This line is formed by the binding of the polyclonal
antibodies (Anti-mouse IgG) affixed onto the control zone to the sample- colloidal gold
conjugate. Presence of this line indicates that the test has been performed correctly. In less than
5 minutes, levels of HCG as low as 25 mIU/mL can be detected.
The Cassette kit consists of one test device in a foil pouch, a dropper, and a package insert. The
Cassette format has the same performance specifications as the Test Strip format. The difference
is that the urine sample is dispensed by dropper onto the sample well on the cassette.
The Midstream I kit consists of one test device in a foil pouch and a package insert. The
Midstream I format has the same performance specifications as the Test Strip format. The
difference is that the device is placed into the urine stream or dipped into the urine collection
cup for 5 to 10 seconds.
The Midstream II kit consists of one test device in a foil pouch and a package insert. The
Midstream II format has the same performance specifications as the Midstream I kit. The
difference is how a positive result appears on the device. A vertical line is printed on the test
area of the device. If the test is positive, a horizontal line forms a pink-colored cross with the
vertical line in the test area of the device.
Human source materials was tested by FDA approved methods and found to be negative for
the presence of antibodies to HIV-1, HIV-2, HbsAg, and HCV.

L. Test Principle:
One Step HCG Urine Pregnancy Test measures the presence of the hormone Human Chorionic
Gonadotropin (HCG) in human urine for the early detection of pregnancy. When the absorbent
end is immersed into the urine specimen, the urine sample is introduced into a chromatographic
membrane. As it contacts the membrane, the sample dissolves the lyophilized conjugate. In a
reactive sample, the HCG antigen will attach to the antibodies in the colloidal solution. As the
conjugate moves forward on the membrane, anti-HCG will attach to the antibody affixed on the
test zone (“T”) will bind the HCG-gold conjugate complex, forming a pink line (“T”). Any
sample will cause a pink line to appear in the control zone (“C”). This line is formed by the
binding of the polyclonal antibodies (Anti-mouse IgG) affixed onto the control zone to the
sample- colloidal gold conjugate. Presence of this line indicates that the test has been
performed correctly.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity is not applicable since this is a qualitative test.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
One Step HCG Urine Pregnancy Test is calibrated against reference material traceable to
WHO International Standard 3rd edition.
A shelf-life stability test of the devices was performed in real-time and accelerated testing.
The results showed that the devices were stable for 24 months when stored at 39-86oF (4-
30oC) in the sealed foil pouch. Protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and are
acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limit was evaluated in conjunction with the precision testing. Refer to the
precision data in 1.a. The detection limit was demonstrated to be 25 mIU/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
To evaluate cross-reactivity, negative and positive urine samples (0 and 25 mIU/mL) were
spiked with various concentrations of glycoprotein hormones such as LH (500mIU/mL), FSH
(1000 mIU/mL) and TSH (1000µIU/mL). Tests were performed using 3 different lots of the
cassette format by 3 different health care professionals at EGENS laboratories. The results of
these studies showed that there is no interference at 1000 IU/L FSH, 500IU/L LH, or 1000 IU/L
TSH for both negative and positive urine samples.
To evaluate the potential for interference by certain exogenous compounds, each
interferent was prepared by diluting stock interferent material to the desired concentration.
Male urine samples containing 0 and 25 mIU/mL hCG were spiked with the interferents to
obtain the desired test concentration. The samples were tested using 3 different lots of the cassette
format and the results were read after at 5 and 10 minutes. No interferences were observed
from exogenous compounds at the following concentrations for both negative and positive
hCG urine samples:
Interferent Test concentration
Acetaminophen 20 mg/dL
Acetoacetic Acid 2000 mg/dL
Ascorbic Acid 20 mg/dL
B-hydroxybutyrate 2000 mg/dL
Caffeine 20 mg/dL

To evaluate potential interference from changes in pH, negative and positive urine
samples containing 0 and 25 mIU/mL hCG were tested at pH values of 4, 5,6,7,8 and 9
using 3 different lots by 3 different operators. The results indicated that changes in pH
range of 4-9 do not interfere in the results that were either positive (25 mIU/L) or
negative (0 mIU/L) for HCG.
To evaluate potential interference from changes in specific gravity, negative and
positive urine samples containing 5 and 25 mIU/mL hCG were tested at density values
ranging from 1.000, 1.010, 1.015, 1.025 and 1.035 using 3 different lots and by 3
different operators. The results indicated that changes in specific gravity do not
interfere in the results that were either positive or negative for hCG.
Each test format was evaluated for high dose or hook effect. Negative urine samples were
spiked with varying hCG concentrations (62,500, 125,000, 250,000, 500,000,
1,000,000 and 2,000,000 mIU/mL). All tested concentrations gave a positive result.
The spiked samples were tested by 3 different lots and 3 different operators. The results
demonstrated that no hook effect was observed at hCG concentrations ranging from
62,500 to 2,000,000 mIU/mL.
The sponsor evaluated the effects of the hCG β-core fragment on the performance of the
device. A urine sample with 25 mIU/mL was spiked with varying concentrations of β-

f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off for a positive test for One Step HCG Urine Pregnancy Test is 25
mIU/mL.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Urine samples were collected from 400 women presenting at a clinic to test for pregnancy.
Approximately half of the women were pregnant in the early stage of less than 5 weeks.
Samples were randomly collected at various times throughout the day. Ages were from 20
to 49 years. All subjects performed self-test and collected samples for tests by laboratory
professionals using the proposed and the predicate devices. A total of 100 samples were
tested for each format (strip, cassette, midstream I and midstream II). The tests performed
by laboratory professionals were conducted at different sites. Each person tested three
different lots of the candidate device and one lot of the predicate device at the same time,
but not sequentially. The summary for each format is presented below:

Lay User Study:
To evaluate its suitability to be used by the home use consumers (lay persons), natural and
spiked urine samples were tested by the lay persons and the results were compared with
professional laboratory results.
Negative urine sample pools were spiked with 20 and 30 mIU/mL hCG to create samples
with concentrations near the cut-off concentration (25 mIU/mL). Each concentration sample
pool was further aliquoted into 200 individual containers for a total of 400 aliquots (50
aliquots per concentration for each test format). All aliquots were blindly labeled by a non-
participant.
Four hundred women with various education backgrounds and ages ranging from 20-45
years participated in the lay user study. The study was performed at 3 different point –of- care
sites. For each of the four formats, 100 female participants suspecting pregnancy tested
their own urine and one masked sample using the English package insert as guide to
perform the test. Aliquots of the participants’ urine and spiked urine were tested by
professional laboratory personnel and the results were compared.
All 400 consumer cases were analyzed. Data analysis demonstrated that all of the
participants performed the test correctly and the results showed acceptable accuracy.
Accuracy for the Strip format was 98%; Cassette format 99%; Midstream I 100%; and
Midstream II 98%. Results of the lay user study are summarized in the tables below:

Each patient was given an English questionnaire to assess the readability of the labeling. A
Flesch-Kincaid reading analysis was performed on all package inserts and the score
revealed a reading Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level 7. The results of the questionnaire
reflected that the consumers found the test easy to use and that they did not have trouble
understanding the labeling and interpreting the results.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Not applicable
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
