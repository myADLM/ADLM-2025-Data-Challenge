b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Ten venous blood samples were prepared by mixing a low glycolyzed sample (15
mg/dL) and a high spiked sample (622 mg/dL) to cover the device measuring range of
20 to 600 mg/dL (42.5% hematocrit). Glucose concentrations (16.2, 53.2,
92.1,,166.0, 247.3, 322.5, 397.0, 474.3, 558.0 and 622.0 mg/dL) were confirmed by
the YSI2300. One operator performed the study using ten calibrated meter and ten
vials of test strips each from three lots in duplicate (N=20 per test strip lot). The
results from the linear regression analysis of the data are summarized below:

BeneCheck Premium GLU Control Solutions:
Traceability and value assignment – The BeneCheck™ Premium GLU and PRO
GLU Monitoring System’s glucose assay is traceable to the N.I.S.T SRM 917c and
the YSI-2300 STAT PLUS (glucose oxidase) analyzer.
Value assignment for the BeneCheck™ Premium GLU and PRO GLU Control
Solutions is performed with ten BeneCheck™ Premium GLU meters using 20 vials of
BeneCheck™ Premium GLU test strips from each of the three lots. The mean,
standard deviation and CV are calculated for each new lot of control material. If the
three CVs, each from three lots of test strips, are ≤5%, then the control range for each
strip lot is calculated. If the CV is > 5%, the product is judged defective and
discarded.
Stability - The sponsor has provided a control solution (levels - 1, 2 and 3) storage
stability study protocol and acceptance criteria to support their storage stability claim
for the open vial of 90 days and for shelf life of 24 months when stored at 50 oF to 86
oF (10oC to 30oC). The accelerated testing at 122oF (50oC) for 95 days of closed vial
supports the shelf life of 24 months, and the real time testing is on-going. The real
time testing of open vial supports the storage claim of 90 days.
BeneCheck™ Premium GLU Test Strips:
Stability - The sponsor has provided a test strip storage stability study protocol and
acceptance criteria to support their storage stability claim for the open vial of 90 days
and for shelf life of 24 months when stored at 50 oF to 86 oF (10oC to 30oC) and 10%
to 90% RH. The accelerated testing at 122oF (50oC) for 90 days of closed vial
supports the shelf life of 24 months, and the real time testing is on-going (180 days of
testing completed). The real time testing of open vial supports the storage claim of 90
days.
This information is provided in the labeling of the test strips and control materials.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range is 20 to 600 mg/dL based on the linearity/assay reportable range
study (section M.1.b).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference study was designed according to CLSI EP7-A2 guideline.
Twenty six potential endogenous and exogenous interfering substances were
evaluated by spiking venous blood (HCT 42.5%) to two levels of glucose
concentrations within the ranges 60 - 100 mg/dL and 200 -300 mg/dL. The glucose
samples were spiked with the potentially interfering compounds and tested on five
meters using one test strip lot. Several concentrations of the interfering substances
were tested. Bias was calculated as individual percent difference in glucose reading
between the test and control concentration groups. Significant interference is defined
by the sponsor as a bias > 10 % of the test samples from the control group.
The sponsor claims no significant interference (≤ 10% difference) for the substances

Lay User Performance Study:
Lay user studies for fingerstick, palm and forearm were performed by 151 lay users
and healthcare professionals using fresh capillary blood samples at eight locations in
US. Labeling was provided only in English and users followed it to perform the
testing. The lay user first performed the testing of the finger, palm and forearm
followed by the healthcare professional performing the testing. Then within 5
minutes, capillary whole blood samples were collected in heparin tubes, plasma was
separated, frozen and sent for testing on YSI. The samples were tested using three
lots of Premium test strips which were distributed randomly to the lay users. All
results were compared to the YSI. Results are summarized below:

--- Page 13 ---
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, palm
and forearm. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary
action.
5. Calibration:
The BeneCheck Premium Glu meter and the BeneCheck Premium PRO Glu meter are
autocoding devices.
6. Quality Control:
The BeneCheck Premium Glu and BeneCheck Premium PRO Glu control solutions at
three concentration levels (1, 2, 3) can be run with this device. The meter has to be set in
control solution test mode to prevent control results from being stored in the internal
memory as patient result. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are
provided in the labeling. The control solution readings are not included in the average of
the patient results. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip
vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside
these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. A labeling comprehension study was performed as a part of the lay user clinical study. The
recruited 152 lay users (aged 18-83 yrs old) were provided with all labeling in English for the
US market and a questionnaire. Participants varied in age, education, country of origin, and
both men (n = 90) and women (n = 62) were included in the study. These lay users
completed the questionnaire to indicate whether the device is easy to use and the Instructions
for use were written in a way that makes it easy to use. The majority of the users responded
that the device is very easy to use.
2. Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the results showed that the
labeling (User manual, Quick Guide, test strip package insert and control solution
package insert) were written at grade levels ranging from 7.0th to 8.0th grade.
3. The effect of different hematocrit levels on the accuracy of the device was evaluated on
the Premium Blood Glucose Monitoring System using eight meters (tested in eight
replicates) and three lots of test strips. Venous blood samples at six hematocrit levels
from 25% to 60% (25, 30, 42.5, 50, 55 and 60%) were evaluated at four concentrations of
glucose (47, 97, 222 and 455 mg/dL. Individual glucose concentrations were compared
to mean YSI and normal HCT (42.5%) values and individual percent biases were
calculated. Results demonstrated that hematocrit levels between 30 to 55% do not
significantly interfere with glucose measurements.

5. Minimum sample volume studies were performed at volumes starting from 0.7 µL to 1.5
µL (i.e. 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 and 1.5 µL) using 30 vials of test strips from
two lots. Three glucose concentrations of venous blood at 63.6, 109.5 and 267.0 mg/dL,
as determined by the YSI, were tested. Each sample was tested with 5 meters in
singlicate (N= 5 per sample at each test volume per test strip lot). Results supported a
minimum sample volume of 0.9 µL.
6. Temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated for temperatures 50oF
and 104oF (10oC and 40oC) at relative humidity ranging from 10% to 90% R.H using an
environmental stat chamber (thermal-stat and humidity-stat incubator). Three glucose
concentration levels of approximately 70.0, 150.0 and 250.0 mg/dL as determined by YSI
were tested. At each operating condition of temperature and humidity, each sample was
tested with 6 meters and one test strip lot N=6). Results supported accurate performance
of the device at temperature and humidity conditions of 50oF to 104oF and 10% to 95%
RH.
7. The effect of altitude on the accuracy of the device was evaluated on the Premium Blood
Glucose Monitoring System using a simulated hypobaric chamber. Venous blood
samples at three glucose levels of approximately 83.0, 155.0 and 365.0 mg/dL (HCT
within 43%), were used. The blood samples were tested in duplicate at two altitudes; sea
level and 10500 feet, with five meters and one lot of test strips. Results supported the
claim that the candidate device performs accurately up to an altitude of 10,000 feet.
8. The BeneCheck Premium Glu Monitoring System is intended for home use by single
person and BeneCheck Premium PRO Glu Monitoring System intended for multi-patient
use in a professional healthcare setting. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on
the materials comprising the meter demonstrating the efficacy of the chosen Super Sani-
Cloth germicidal disposable wipes (EPA Reg. No. 9480-4) against hepatitis B virus using
HBsAg testing. Robustness studies were also performed demonstrating that there was no
change in performance or in the external materials of the meter after 12,000 cleaning and
disinfection cycles. The robustness studies were designed to simulate three years of
single-patient use and 3 years of multiple-patient use. Labeling has been reviewed for
adequate instructions on the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
9. EMC testing was evaluated and certified by TUV Rheinland Taiwan Ltd. and a certificate
of conformity was issued to General Life Biotechnology Co., Ltd on 02-07-2012.
10. The Premium meter was tested for its reliability to vibration testing. The meter
performance and functions were not affected after the standard vibration tests.
