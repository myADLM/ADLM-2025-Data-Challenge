--- Page 2 ---
1. Intended use(s):
VALIDATE® PSA Calibration/ Verification/ Linearity Test Kit solutions are intended
for in vitro diagnostic use in the quantitative determination of linearity, calibration
verification and verification of reportable range for the following analytes: Total
prostrate-specific antigen (PSA) and free prostrate-specific antigen (fPSA) on automated
systems.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For In Vitro Diagnostic Use. For prescription only.
The kit is not intended for use as routine quality control material or as calibration
materials.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Automated analyzer systems
I. Device Description:
Each test kit consists of one bottle each of Levels 1 through 6 plus a Base matrix. Each
bottle contains 2.5 mL each level, ready to use. There exists a linear relationship among
Levels 1 through 6.
Material of human origin used in the manufacture of this test kit has been tested using
FDA or CE approved methods and found to be non-reactive for HBV, HCV and HIV.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A total of six linear dilution levels of Total PSA and Free PSA were tested in
triplicate ranging between 0.01 - 148.2 ng/mL for Total PSA and 0.008 - 62.6 ng/mL
for Free PSA on representative automated analyzers. Linear regression analysis
results are tabulated below. Criteria of acceptability with total allowable error of 0.3
ng/mL or 32% whichever is greater. Linearity claims for these products are: Total
PSA: 0.008-150 ng/mL and Free PSA: 0.005-50 ng/mL.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: Values of this product are linked to the WHO PSA standard based on
the respective instrument calibration traceability.
Stability: The sponsor provided protocol, acceptance criteria, and line data with
summary.
Real time stability study on the 6 level vials is on-going. Data from 3 lots support 3
months shelf life and 2 lots for 4 months for opened vial.
Open vial freeze-thaw study on 6 levels of Total PSA and Free PSA were performed
for 6 freeze-thaw cycles. Data support maximum of 4 freeze/ thaw cycle.
