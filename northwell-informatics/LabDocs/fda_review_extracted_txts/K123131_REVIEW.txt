L. Test Principle:
The ST AIA-PACK 25-OH Vitamin assay consists of a pretreatment step to release
25-OH Vitamin D from its serum transporter. Pretreated samples are then added to a
ST AIA-PACK 25-OH Vitamin D test cup that contain 25-OH vitamin D-specific
monoclonal antibody immobilized on magnetic beads to which 25-OH Vitamin D
binds. Next, 25-OH vitamin D conjugated to bovine alkaline phosphatase is added to
the reaction mixture, which competes with 25-OH vitamin D for binding to the
antibody on magnetic beads. Subsequently, the magnetic beads are washed to remove
the unbound enzyme labeled 25-OH vitamin D and are then incubated with a
fluorogenic substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (4MUP). The amount of
enzyme-labeled 25-OH vitamin D that binds to the beads is inversely proportional to
the 25-OH vitamin D concentration in the test sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the ST AIA-PACK 25-OH Vitamin D assay was evaluated
according to CLSI EP5-A2. Three reagent lots and three analyzers were
utilized in the study. Two replicates of each of the three levels of pooled and
spiked Na-heparinized plasma, EDTA plasma and serum specimens were
tested on two separate occasions per day for 20 non-consecutive days, leading
to the generation of 80 data points for each sample type. Mean, within-run
CV and total precision CV are summarized in the table below.

Precision of the ST AIA-PACK 25-OH Vitamin D Control Set was evaluated
according to CLSI EP5-A2. The protocol consisted of testing 2 levels of
controls in 2 replicates per run, 2 runs per day for 20 non-consecutive days on
one analyzer generating a total of 80 data points for each control level. Mean,
within-run CV and total precision CV are summarized in the table below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated according to CLSI guideline EP6-A. Samples were
prepared by mixing a high spiked serum sample with a low serum sample to
obtain 11 concentrations across the range 2.6 ng/mL to 158.7 ng/mL, with
each sample being assayed in 4 replicates. The data showed the following
linear regression: Y= 1.0366X + 0.1327, r= 0.9975
The sponsor claimed that the assay range is 4 to 120 mg/dL.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The calibrators for use with the ST AIA-PACK 25-OH Vitamin D are
prepared gravimetrically. The commercially available stock of 25-
hydroxycholecalciferol is used to make the internal standards by gravimetrical
dilution into vitamin-free serum. The initial value for the internal material is
assigned using the candidate device compared to the predicate device.
Value Assignment
ST AIA-Pack 25-OH Vitamin D Calibrator Set contains 6 levels of different
concentrations of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol in steroid free human serum
devoid of detectable vitamin D at target values of 0 (base material),10, 20, 40,
80, and 165 ng/mL.
AIA-PACK 25-OH Vitamin Control Set contains 2 levels of 25-
hydroxycalciferol in steroid free human serum at target values of 20 and 80
ng/mL.
Production lots of kit calibrators and control materials are value assigned
against internal standards using 3 reagent lots, 5 runs on two different
instruments for a total of 30 replicates. The assigned value is the mean of the
replicates. The controls are labeled with the assigned values as mean ±20%.
Shelf-life Stability
Real-time stability studies were performed for the control materials and the
calibrators. The stability study protocol and the acceptance criteria have been
reviewed and found to be acceptable. The real time stability study supports a
stability of 6 months when materials are stored at 2-8oC.
Open-Vial Stability
The stability study protocol and the acceptance criteria to determine open-vial
stability of the control materials and the calibrators have been reviewed and
found to be acceptable. The reconstituted controls were stable for 1 day when
stored at 18-25° C, for 14 days when stored at 2-8° C, 60 days when stored at
-20° C. Reconstituted calibrators were stable for 1 day when stored at 2-8° C.
For the calibration frequency, the sponsor claimed that the calibration is stable
for up to 90 days.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor performed a detection limit study to support their low end
measuring range according to the CLSI guideline EP17-A.
For LoB determination, three blank samples were measured in three
independent runs with 60 replicates per run giving 180 determinations in total.
The LoB is calculated as the mean of the 57th and 58th highest values for the
blanks. The LoB was estimated to be 1.6 ng/mL.
7

--- Page 8 ---
For LoD determination, six low level samples were measured in 3
independent runs with 10 replicates per run generating 180 measurements.
The LoD samples were made by diluting commercial serum samples to yield
concentrations ranging from 1.23-6.38 ng/mL. The LoD was calculated to be 2.6
ng/mL.
For LoQ determination, the test results from the LoD determination were used
to calculate the functional sensitivity of the assay. Sponsor defines the LoQ as
the interassay precision ≤ 20% CV. The LoQ was determined to be 2.9
ng/mL.
The measuring range of the ST AIA-PACK 25-OH Vitamin D assay is 4.0 to
120 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity
To estimate cross reactivity of various Vitamin D metabolites with 25-OH
Vitamin D, aliquots of samples of moderate Vitamin D levels were spiked
with 25-OH Vitamin D metabolites.
Cross reactivity from compounds listed below were evaluated. Results are
tabulated:

Interference
The sponsor performed studies to evaluate the effects of potential interferents
on the performance of the ST AIA-25-OH Vitamin assay, following CLSI
EP7-A2. Testing was done in the presence of 14 to 80 ng/mL 25-OH vitamin
D and different concentrations of the listed compounds. All samples were run
in triplicate. Percent recovery was calculated relative to control samples
