L. Test Principle:
Calcium ions (Ca2+) react with Arsenazo III (2,2’-[1,8-Dihydroxy-3,6-
disulphonaphthylene-2,7-bisazo]-bisbenzenearsonic acid) to form an intense purple
colored complex. The absorbance of the Ca-Arsenazo III complex is measured
bichromatically at 660/700 nm. The resulting increase in absorbance of the reaction
mixture is directly proportional to the calcium concentration in the sample.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A serum sample linearity study was performed according to CLSI guidance
document EP6-A recommendations. A series of 10 samples was prepared by
combining various volumetric proportions of a high concentration calcium
human serum pool with a low concentration calcium sample to produce
samples with calcium values ranging from 3.39 to 21.0 mg/dL. Each level was
measured in quadruplicate using 1 instrument and 1 lot of reagent. Linear
regression analysis of a plot of expected values and experimentally
determined values produced a curve fit with the following equation: y = 1.01x
- 0.24, R2 = 0.9994.
A urine sample linearity study was performed according to CLSI guidance
document EP6-A recommendations. A series of 12 samples was prepared by
combining various volumetric proportions of a high concentration urine pool
with saline to produce samples with calcium values ranging from 0.33 to 18.9
mg/dL. Each level was measured in quadruplicate using 1 instrument and 1 lot
of reagent. Linear regression analysis of a plot of expected values and
experimentally determined values produced a curve fit with the following
equation: y = 0.933x - 0.345, R2 = 0.9996.
The linearity studies provided by the sponsor support reportable range claims
for the ABX Pentra Calcium AS CP device of 4 - 18.05 mg/dL calcium for
serum samples, and 0.64 - 18.05 mg/dL calcium for urine samples.
Automatic Dilution
The Pentra 400 performs automatic dilutions (1:3) on calcium samples if the
value is > 18.05 mg/dL. A study was performed comparing manual dilutions
to the Pentra 400 automated dilutions of 7 pooled serum samples and 7 pooled
urine samples spiked with calcium. Samples ranged from 18.4 mg/dL to 54.15
mg/dL, and were measured in duplicate. Manual and automated dilution

factors were the same and each sample was run in duplicate. All results are
within +/- 10% recovery. These studies support the sponsor’s claim that urine
and serum/plasma samples with calcium concentrations up to 54.15 mg/dL
can be run on the Pentra 400 system.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The calibrators and controls used in this submission are previously cleared
in k052007 for ABX Pentra Multical, ABX Pentra N Control and ABX
Pentra P Control and in k070249 for ABX Pentra Urine Control L/H. The
calcium material introduced into the calibrators and its corresponding value
is traceable to NIST reference material SRM909b. In this submission,
calcium values for this assay are being added to the existing calibrator and
control materials.
Stability:
Real-time testing was conducted. The stability study protocol and the
acceptance criteria have been reviewed and found to be acceptable. The
study results support the following stability claims in the labeling:

P Control: 13.4 mg/dL
Urine control L: 71.4 mg/dL
Urine control H: 99.4 mg/dL
Calibrator: The target value is determined by the median of 150 results from 6
ABX PENTRA 400 analyzers. The nominal calcium value expected for the
ABX Pentra 400 analyzer is 10.55 mg/dL.
Calibration Interval:
ABX Pentra Calcium AS CP assay calibration stability was assessed, and the
sponsor claims that calibration is stable for 10 days. The protocol and
acceptance criteria have been provided and found to be adequate to support
the sponsor’s claims. The sponsor also recommends using quality control
samples at least once a day, after each calibration.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor performed a detection limit study for the ABX Pentra Calcium
AS CP assay on the ABX Pentra 400 instrument system, following CLSI
guidance document EP17-A.
Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by assaying 30 replicate measurements
of a blank sample, performed on each of 3 ABX Pentra 400 instruments over
2 days (N = 180). The LoB was calculated as 0.20 mg/dL.
Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined in serum and urine by assaying 20
replicate measurements of 4 serum and 4 urine samples, respectively, with
concentrations ranging between LoB and LoB x 4. The LoDs for serum and
urine were calculated as 0.28 mg/dL and 0.23 mg/dL, respectively.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined by assaying 10 replicate
measurements of 10 low calcium concentration samples for both serum and
urine, over 3 days. The LoQ was based on inter-assay precision less than 10%
CV. The LoQ in serum and urine were determined as 1.54 mg/dL and 0.64
mg/dL, respectively.
The ABX Pentra Calcium assay has a measuring range of 4 - 18.05 mg/dL for
serum sample, and 0.64 - 18.05 mg/dL for urine sample.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed to determine the effects from potential
interferents on the ABX PENTRA Calcium AS CP assay. Various
concentrations of interferents were spiked into pooled human serum or pooled
human urine containing calcium at low (~8.5 mg/dL) and elevated (~15
9

--- Page 10 ---
mg/dL) concentrations. All samples were tested in quadruplicate. Non-
significant interference was defined by the sponsor as the highest interferent
level tested with bias ≤5% of the control for serum samples or ≤10% of the
control for urine samples. Below is a summary table of the highest
concentration of interferent tested and found not to interfere based on the
stated acceptance criteria.
Concentration
Test Interferent Serum Urine
Magnesium 10.7 mg/dL 13.0 mg/dL
Ascorbic Acid (L) 60.0 mg/dL 60.0 mg/dL
Total Bilirubin 46.1 mg/dL N/A
Direct Bilirubin 26.0 mg/dL 25.3 mg/dL
Intralipid ( Turbidity) 500 mg/dL 613 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 500 mg/dL 500 mg/dL
Ibuprofen 50.1 mg/dL N/A
Acetaminophen 20.0 mg/dL N/A
Acetylsalicylic acid 65.2 mg/dL N/A
In addition, the effect of acidification or alkalinization of urine samples on
calcium concentration was evaluated. Two urine samples with different
calcium concentrations were either acidified (to pH 1.7) or alkalinized (to pH
11.5), and were run in triplicate. In comparison to untreated urine samples no
interference was observed for acidification, while significant interference was
observed for urine samples with pH greater than pH 7.0.
Since alkaline pH affects the urine calcium results, the sponsor includes the
following limitation in their labeling:
“24 hours urine specimens have to be collected with HCI 6N. Non acidified
urines which have been refrigerated should be acidified and/or heated at 56°C
for 15 minutes to re-dissolve any precipitate.”

human serum samples, 16 of which were altered, were assayed using the
subject and predicate methods. Samples were measured in singlicate and
ranged in calcium concentration from 4.17 to 15.9 mg/dL. Linear regression
analysis, resulting from a plot of calcium concentrations obtained on the
subject (Y-axis) and predicate (X-axis) devices, resulted in the following line
fit equation: y = 1.007x + 0.028, r2 = 0.9902.
Urine:
A method comparison study was performed to assess the performance of the
ABX Pentra Calcium AS CP assay with the Olympus calcium arsenazo
reagent (predicate device), following CLSI guidance document EP9-A2. 143
human urine samples using the subject and predicate methods were analyzed.
Samples were measured in singlicate and ranged in calcium concentration
from 0.64 to 17.8 mg/dL. Linear regression analysis, resulting from a plot of
calcium concentrations obtained on the subject (Y-axis) and predicate (X-
axis) devices, resulted in the following line fit equation: y = 0.977x + 0.097, r2
= 0.9930.
b. Matrix comparison:
The sponsor performed a matrix comparison study to compare the
performance between serum and lithium-heparin plasma samples. The study
included 32 paired serum and plasma samples (Lithium-Heparin Plasma)
ranging in calcium concentration from 4.0 mg/dL to 17.5 mg/dL; 3 samples
were altered. Each sample was tested in singlicate using the ABX Pentra
Calcium AS CP assay reagent. Linear regression analysis of the plot of serum
(x-axis) and plasma (y-axis) samples showed the following relationships
between the matrix types:
y = 1.006x – 0.0022, r2 = 0.996
The sponsor concluded that Li-Heparin plasma is an acceptable anti-coagulant
to be used with the ABX Pentra Calcium AS CP assay.
