SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification
Decision Summary
To: Sekisui Diagnostics, LLC RE: K123182
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own
Class II or Class I device requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable
1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device:
Trade Name: OSOM® Influenza A&B Test
510(k) number: K092633
2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in
its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for
use, package labeling.
3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S). The modification presented in this 510(k) is the
inclusion of the H3N2v influenza A virus strains below, to the analytical reactivity information. The
submitter tested the ability of the OSOM® Influenza A&B Test to detect H3N2v influenza A viruses.
The viruses used were diluted viral stocks obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. Analytical reactivity testing was performed in duplicate on each virus and reported as the
lowest dilution/concentration of the H3N2v virus that the OSOM® Influenza A&B Test was able to
detect. The following H3N2v viruses were tested:
A/WEST VIRGINIA/06/2011
A/PENNSYLVANIA/14/2010
A/MINNESOTA/11/2010
A/KANSAS/13/2009
A/INDIANA/08/2011
A/INDIANA/10/2011
The OSOM® Influenza A&B Test package insert has been updated to include the additional
analytical reactivity information
4. The FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.
5. Comparison Information (similarities and differences) to applicant’s legally marketed predicate

analytical reactivity information section:

**Although this test has been shown to detect these 2009 H1N1 and H3N2v viruses cultured from
positive human respiratory specimens the performance characteristics of this device with clinical
specimens that are positive for these H3N2v influenza viruses have not been established. The
OSOM® Influenza A&B Test can distinguish between influenza A and B viruses, but it cannot
differentiate influenza subtypes.
6. Design Control Activities Summary:
a) Risk Analysis:
A Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) method was used evaluate risk for the proposed
changes to the labeling. The methods of risk analysis were consistent with 21 CFR 860, ISO: 14971.
The following table is a summary of the risk analysis:

b) Analytical Reactivity Testing was conducted as described in section 3, Device Modifications.
c) Declaration of Conformity
A “Declaration of Conformity” statement was submitted for the manufacturing facility and validation
activities and signed by the Director of Quality Assurance and the Senior Director of Technical
Operations respectively. The statements indicate that;
1. The manufacturing facility is in conformance with design control procedure requirements as
specified in 21 CFR 820.30 and the records are available for review.
2. The validation activities, as required by the risk analysis, for the modification were performed by
the designated individuals and the results demonstrated that the predetermined acceptance
criteria were met.
In conclusion, based on both the results of the analytical reactivity testing and the risk management
report, the modified labeling is truthful and accurate. The changes do not affect the performance of
the test and it is therefore substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.
7. A Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary, and the Indications for
Use Enclosure.
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended
use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the
particular modification and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices
demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided
the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and, on this basis, I
recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.
