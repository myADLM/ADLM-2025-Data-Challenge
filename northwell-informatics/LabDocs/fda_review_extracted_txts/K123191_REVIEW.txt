510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number: K123191
B. Purpose for Submission: The submission is for a modification to the previously
cleared Xpert® Flu Assay (K103766, K120911). The modification is the addition of a
reverse primer that targets the matrix gene segment of the influenza A virus strain
A/Victoria/361/2011. The primer was added to improve the Xpert® Flu Assay
detection of this virus strain which is predicted to be the dominant circulating H3N2
virus type during the 2012-2013 influenza season. The A/Victoria/361/2011 virus is
also included in the trivalent influenza vaccine for the 2012-2013.
C. Measurand: Influenza A and/or influenza B nucleic acid isolated from nasal
aspirates/washes or nasopharyngeal swabs and amplified by real-time RT-PCR.
D. Type of Test: The Xpert® Flu Assay is a real-time RT-PCR assay that measures the
presence of influenza A and/or influenza B nucleic acid.

--- Page 2 ---
detection and differentiation of influenza A, influenza B and 2009 H1N1 influenza
viral RNA. The Xpert Flu Assay uses nasal aspirates/washes and nasopharyngeal
swab specimens collected from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory
infection in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors. The Xpert Flu
Assay is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of influenza.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as
the sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions.
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2009-2010
influenza season when 2009 H1N1 influenza was the predominant influenza A virus
in circulation. Performance characteristics for influenza A were confirmed when
influenza
A/H3 and influenza A/2009 H1N1 were the predominant influenza A viruses in
circulation (2009-2010, 2010-2011 and 2011-2012). When other influenza A viruses
are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities,
specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for
novel virulent influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for
testing. Viral culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility
is available to receive and culture specimens.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as intended use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements: The Xpert Flu Assay requires the use of either
the GeneXpert® Dx System (Software version 4.3 or higher), or the GeneXpert®
Infinity-48 System (Software version 4.3 or higher), or the GeneXpert® Infinity-80
System (Software version 6.0 or higher) from Cepheid.
I. Device Description:
The Xpert Flu Assay is a rapid, automated in vitro diagnostic test for qualitative
detection and differentiation of influenza A, influenza B and influenza A, subtype
2009 H1N1. The assay is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert® Instrument Systems.
The GeneXpert® Instrument Systems automate and integrate sample purification,
nucleic acid amplification, and detection of the target sequence in simple or complex
samples using real-time PCR and RT-PCR assays. The systems require the use of
2

--- Page 3 ---
single-use disposable cartridges that hold the PCR reagents and host the PCR process.
Because the cartridges are self-contained and specimens never come into contact with
working parts of the instrument modules, cross-contamination between samples is
minimized.
The Xpert Flu Assay includes reagents for the detection and differentiation of
influenza A, influenza B, and influenza A, subtype 2009 H1N1 directly from nasal
aspirates/washes (NA/W) and nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens from patients
suspected of having influenza. A Sample Processing Control (SPC) and a Probe
Check Control (PCC) are also included. The SPC is present to control for adequate
processing of the target viruses and to monitor the presence of inhibitors in the PCR
reaction. The Probe Check Control (PCC) verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube
filling in the cartridge, probe integrity and dye stability.
The liquid specimen (NA/W) or swab specimen (NP) is collected according to the
institution’s standard procedures and placed into Universal Transport Medium (3mL
UTM tubes). Following a brief mixing by inverting the UTM tube five times, the
eluted material and one single-use reagent (Reagent 1), that is provided with the
assay, are transferred to different, uniquely-labeled chambers of the disposable fluidic
cartridge (the Xpert® Flu cartridge). The user initiates a test from the system user
interface and places the cartridge into the GeneXpert® instrument platform, which
performs hands-off real-time, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for
detection of DNA. In this platform, additional sample preparation, amplification, and
real-time detection are all fully automated and completely integrated.
The single-use, multi-chambered fluidic cartridges are designed to complete sample
preparation and real-time PCR for detection and differentiation of influenza A,
influenza B and influenza A, subtype 2009 H1N1 in 75 minutes. The GeneXpert®
Instrument Systems, which consist of the GeneXpert® Dx System, the GeneXpert®
Infinity-48 System, and the GeneXpert® Infinity-80 System, have 1 to 80 randomly
accessible modules that are each capable of performing separate sample preparation
and real-time PCR tests. Each module contains a syringe drive for dispensing fluids
(i.e., the syringe drive activates the plunger that works in concert with the rotary
valve in the cartridge to move fluids between chambers), an ultrasonic horn for lysing
cells or spores, and a proprietary ICORE®thermocycler for performing real-time PCR
and detection.

--- Page 8 ---
Each virus was tested with the modified Xpert® Flu Assay in 20 replicates at
four concentrations to obtain the LoD. The LoD was determined to be the
lowest concentration at which there were 19/20 or 20/20 positive test results.
The LoDs reported in this study were equivalent to or better than those
reported for the predicate device.
e. Analytical specificity:
Influenza viruses were diluted in a simulated background matrix of 2.5%
porcine mucin and 1% human whole blood in 0.85% sodium chloride in 1X
PBS solution with 15% glycerol diluted with UTM at a 1:6 ratio. A
representative virus was chosen for each test analyte, influenza A, influenza A
2009 H1N,1 and influenza B. A total of 40 strains of viruses (18), bacteria
(21), and yeast (1) were then spiked into the test sample to determine the
specificity of the Xpert Flu Assay in the presence of contaminants that are
commonly found in the nasopharyngeal flora.

The results of this study show that the modified Xpert® Flu Assay has 100%
analytical specificity under the test conditions used. This is the same
analytical specificity that was reported for the predicate.
f. Analytical reactivity:
All virus strains were tested at either the LoD or the lowest concentration
where all three replicates generated appropriate positive results for Flu A,
2009 H1N1, or Flu B. All influenza viruses were diluted in a simulated
background matrix of 2.5% porcine mucin and 1% human whole blood in
0.85% sodium chloride in 1X PBS solution with 15% glycerol diluted with
UTM at a 1:6 ratio. All dilutions made for testing were prepared on the day of
the test and kept on ice prior to testing. The analytical reactivity data for the
modified Xpert® Flu Assay is acceptable. All virus strains were detected and
the titers tested are appropriate for evaluating reactivity.

g. Interfering Substances:
Ten potentially interfering substances were tested on the Xpert® Flu Assay
platform to look for any significant changes in the reported Ct value. Each
potentially interfering substance was added to either a negative control
reaction, where change in sample processing control Ct was evaluated, or a
simulated clinical sample with A/Victoria/361/2011at a titer of 3.2x LoD,
where a change in Flu A Ct was evaluated.
Samples containing blood or mucin and A/Victoria/361/2011 had significantly
increased Ct value indicating an inhibitory effect of these two substances.
This inhibition is addressed in the Limitations Section of the Package Insert.

h. Assay cut-off:
The addition of one primer (oligonucleotide) did not impact the Assay cut-off
of this assay. This was confirmed in the clinical study for the modified Xpert®
Flu Assay.
i. Validation of Internal Controls
Three internal controls were evaluated in testing with the clinical sample
results from the Study Protocol 166. The Sample Processing Control (SPC)
was reported as “INVALID” in 0.1% of the 689 total runs. A two-sample t-
test indicates that false negative and true negatives occur at the same rate,
suggesting that the SPC is functioning properly as an internal control.
The Probe Check Control (PCC) is designed to verify, reagent rehydration,
PCR tube filling, probe integrity and dye stability. Eleven test results
reported and “ERROR” due to PCC failure (1.6%). This is an adequate
control and an acceptable level of error.

The Maximum Pressure (Max PSI) detects fluidic movement within the
cartridge and aborts any run that generates a pressure of over 120PSI which
may result in failure of the cartridge integrity. There were no Max PSI errors
reported during any runs.
The internal controls for the modified Xpert ® Flu Assay are appropriate and
adequate to control for the various steps of sample processing, PCR reaction
and detection.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The modified Xpert ® Flu Assay was compared to the currently cleared Xpert ®
Flu Assay.
b. Matrix comparison:
The matrix comparison study was not needed since device modification did not
affect the matrices.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Retrospective clinical study:
The modified Xpert ® Flu Assay was compared to the current Xpert ® Flu
Assay. The modified assay detected more positive samples than the current
assay, detecting not only additional A/Victoria/361-like viruses, but also
A/Perth/16/2009-like viruses. The positive and negative percent agreement of
based on testing 166 samples are listed in the table below. The modified
Xpert ® Flu Assay with the additional A/Victoria/361 primer demonstrated an
improved ability of the test to detect this virus. In addition to testing archived
clinical samples, ten contrived specimens (5 NP swab and 5 NA/W
background matrices) spiked at LoD with A/Victoria/361 were tested. These
specimens were tested blinded as part of the clinical specimens and all were
reported as Flu A Positive; 2009 H1N1 NOT Detected; Flu B negative.

Assay.

4. Clinical cut-off:
The clinical cut-off is reported as Ct value of 37 for the sample processing control
and a Ct of 40 for Influenza A, Influenza A, 2009 H1N1, and Influenza B analytes.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
In the prospective Cepheid Xpert Flu clinical study there was a total of 639 samples
collected. Of the 639 samples, 348 were collected from male subjects and 291 from
female subjects. The age distribution among study subjects was: 59.3% (379/639) <
5 years; 16.1% (103/639) 6-21 years; 16.9% (108/639) 22-59 years; and 7.7%
(49/639) ≥60 years. A total of 342 prospective NA/W specimens were tested for
influenza A, influenza A subtype 2009 H1N1 and influenza B by the Xpert Flu Assay
and viral culture plus DFA. A total of 297 prospectively collected NP swab
specimens were tested for influenza A, influenza A subtype 2009 H1N1 and influenza
B by the Xpert Flu Assay and viral culture plus DFA. These samples were collected
during the 2010 influenza season at three clinical laboratories in Australia from
August through October of 2010 and from a U.S. clinical site from May to mid-
August. The number and percentage of influenza A, influenza A subtype 2009
H1N1, and influenza B prospectively collected positive cases as determined positive
by the Xpert Flu Assay are: For NA/W prospective samples influenza A is 2.6%
(9/342), influenza A subtype 2009 H1N1 is 2.3% (8/342), and influenza B is 2.6%
(9/342). For NP swab prospective samples influenza A is 4.0% (12/297), influenza A
subtype 2009 H1N1 is 2.7% (8/297), and influenza B is 2.7% (8/297).
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
