I. Device Description:
The Verigene® C. difficile Nucleic Acid Test (CDF) is a molecular assay which relies on
detection of specific nucleic acid targets in a microarray format. For each of the bacterial
nucleic acid sequences detected by the CDF test, the assay utilizes unique Capture and
Mediator oligonucleotides, followed by gold nanoparticle probe-based endpoint
detection. The Capture oligonucleotides are covalently bound to the microarray substrate
and hybridize to a specific portion of the nucleic acid targets. The Mediator
oligonucleotides have a region which bind to a different portion of the same nucleic acid
targets and also have a sequence which allows binding of a gold nanoparticle probe.
Specific silver enhancement of the bound gold nanoparticle probes at the capture sites
results in gold-silver aggregates that scatter light with high efficiency and provide
accurate detection of target capture.
The CDF Test is performed on the Verigene System, a “sample-to-result,” fully
automated, bench-top molecular diagnostics workstation. The System enables automated
nucleic acid extraction from unformed stool specimens (liquid or soft) and detection of
specific bacterial target DNA. The Verigene System consists of two components: the
Verigene Reader and the Verigene Processor SP.
The Reader is the Verigene System’s user interface, which serves as the central control
unit for all aspects of test processing, automated imaging, and result generation using a
touchscreen control panel and a barcode scanner. The Verigene Processor SP executes
the test procedure, automating the steps of (1) Sample Preparation and Target
Amplification (i.e., cell lysis and magnetic bead-based bacterial DNA isolation and
nucleic acid amplification), and (2) Hybridization (i.e., detection and identification of
bacterial-specific DNA in a microarray format by using gold nanoparticle probe-based
technology). Once the specimen is loaded by the operator, all other fluid transfer steps
are performed by an automated pipette that transfers reagents between wells of the trays
and finally loads the specimen into the Test Cartridge for hybridization. Single-use
disposable test consumables and a self-contained Verigene Test Cartridge are utilized for
each sample tested with the CDF assay.
3

--- Page 4 ---
To obtain the test results after test processing is complete the user removes the Test
Cartridge from the Processor SP and inserts the substrate holder into the Reader for
analysis. Light scatter from the capture spots is imaged by the Reader and intensities
from the microarray spots are used to make a determination regarding the presence
(Detected) or absence (Not Detected) of a bacterial nucleic acid sequence/analyte. This
determination is made by means of software-based decision algorithm resident in the
Verigene Reader.
To prevent reagent dispensing errors, all reagents are prepackaged in single-use
disposables, including Stool Lysis Buffer (SLB) Tubes, reagent trays, and cartridges.
Several layers of controls built into the CDF test ensure that failures at any step are
identified during the procedure or in the end-point image analysis of the Test Cartridge.
An artificial DNA construct serves as an amplification or PCR control (i.e., Internal
Processing Control 1 [IC1]) and is included within the Amplification Tray. Bacillus
subtilis serves as a specimen preparation & amplification control (i.e., Internal Processing
Control 2 [IC2]) and is automatically added by the Verigene SP to each specimen prior to
the extraction step. Additional positive controls are immobilized on the Test Slide and
are used to determine that hybridization was performed correctly. The CDF algorithm
requires that these controls be valid before decisions regarding the presence or absence of
any other target on the panel can be determined.
The Verigene® CDF Test Kit contains sufficient reagents to process 20 specimens or
quality control samples. The kit contains the following:
Verigene® CDF Test Kit

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Establishing the Performance Characteristics of In Vitro Diagnostic Devices for the
Detection of Clostridium difficile – Draft Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff (FDA
document 1715, issued on November 29, 2010)
L. Test Principle:
The Verigene® Clostridium difficile Nucleic Acid Test (CDF Test) is a rapid, automated in
vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative detection of C. difficile DNA directly from unformed
(liquid or soft) stool specimens of patients suspected of having C. difficile infection (CDI).
The CDF Test detects toxin A (tcdA), toxin B (tcdB), and tcdC gene sequences of toxigenic
strains of C. difficile. Presumptive identification of the PCR ribotype 027 strain of C.
difficile is by detection of the binary toxin (cdt) gene sequence and the single base pair
deletion at nucleotide 117 in the tcdC gene. The tcdC gene encodes for a negative regulator
in C. difficile toxin production. The test is performed on the Verigene® System and utilizes
automated specimen preparation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification,
combined with a nanoparticle-based array hybridization assay to detect the toxin gene
sequences associated with toxin-producing C. difficile.
Prior to initiating a test on the Verigene Processor SP, the Extraction Tray, the Amplification
Tray and Tip Holder are loaded into the Verigene Processor SP. The barcode located on the
CDF Test Cartridge is entered via the scanner attached to the Reader, and the associated
sample information is entered either using the barcode-scanner or the Reader touch-screen
interface (this links specific patient information to a specific Test Cartridge number). The
CDF Test Cartridge is then inserted into the Processor SP. Once the consumables are loaded,
150 µL of liquid stool sample is added to Stool Lysis Buffer, vortexed, and then centrifuged.
A 100 µL aliquot of this Stool Lysis Buffer is then pipetted into the designated Sample Well
within the Extraction Tray and the Drawer Assembly is closed to initiate the test. The
Processor SP identifies the Test Cartridge via an internal barcode scanner and communicates
with the Reader to receive test instructions. Once the Processor SP module completes
processing (approximately 2.0 hours), the CDF Test Cartridge is removed and inserted into
the Reader for automated identification of the gene-specific DNA amplification products by
nanoparticle-based array hybridization detection.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The inter-laboratory reproducibility of the CDF Test was determined by conducting a
reproducibility study at three external sites. A seven sample panel for the
reproducibility study was comprised of two different strains at three different
8

--- Page 9 ---
concentrations (six positive samples) and one (1) negative sample. Each of the seven
samples in the panel was tested daily in triplicate by two operators for five non-
consecutive days at three sites for a total of 90 tests per sample (3 sites x 2
operators/site x 3 replicates/operator x 5 days = 90 tests per sample). The study tested
a total of 630 samples. Positive and negative controls were run by each site once per
combination of consumable lots received
The results of the Reproducibility Study are provided in the table below. The results
indicate the Verigene CDF Test was reproducible in this multi-center study.

d. Detection limit:
Analytical sensitivity (LoD) of the CDF Test was determined for seven strains of C.
difficile, representing all major toxinotypes found in North America and including
two PCR Ribotype 027 strains. The LoD was defined as the concentration at which
the test produces a positive result greater than 95% of the time. Serial dilutions of the
strains were tested and the putative LoD confirmed with 20 replicates. The LoDs for
the seven strains are shown in the table below and ranged from 63 to 1250 CFU/ml of

*Per information provided by the CDC, this strain was tentatively identified as toxinotype XI
All tests correctly reported the expected results for the detection of gene sequences
for toxigenic C. difficile and for presumptive PCR ribotype 027, with one exception:
Strain CDC 2009048 strain, classified by the CDC as Toxinotype XIV/XV, is
associated with non-027 strains (Ribotypes 111/122). However, the Verigene CDF
Test reported detection of the tcdA, tcdB, binary and tcdC-MUT targets as would be
expected for a PCR ribotype 027 strain. Subsequent sequencing of the tcdC gene
verified the presence of the Δ117 deletion.

f. Analytical specificity:
Ninety-four (94) microorganisms, including two (2) non-toxigenic C. difficile strains
and fourteen (14) non C. difficile Clostridium species, seventy-seven (77) other
microorganisms, and one (1) human cell line, were tested with the CDF Test to
determine analytical specificity. In addition, the cross-reactivity of Clostridium
botulinum was evaluated by in silico analysis.
Each bacterial strain was prepared in Negative Stool Matrix and tested in triplicate in
concentrations of 5×106 CFU/mL stool. Two (2) organisms, Cryptosporidium parvum
and Giardia lamblia, were tested using genomic DNA at a concentration of 1×106
copies of gDNA. For the viruses, Echovirus 11 and Coxsackievirus were tested at
5×105 PFU/mL stool. Adenovirus, Enterovirus, Cytomegalovirus and Rotavirus were
also tested using genomic DNA or RNA at a concentration of 1×106 copies per
reaction. Noroviruses were tested as clinical samples.

In addition, the cross-reactivity of Clostridium botulinum was evaluated by in silico
analysis, which assessed the specificity of the CDF Capture, Mediator and primer
oligos to GenBank sequence information for C. botulinum. Analytical specificity was
observed to be 100%, including that determined by in silico analysis.
g. Microbial Interference:
The CDF Test was tested against the same ninety-five (95) organisms/cell line that
were used for analytical specificity, at the same medically relevant concentrations,
using two strains of toxigenic C. difficile (ATCC BAA-1805 [toxinotype III] and
ATCC 43255 [toxinotype 0]) at 1.5x LoD and 3x LoD, respectively, to evaluate the
potential for microbial interference. No interference was observed with the CDF Test
for any of the samples tested.
h. Interfering Substances:
Thirty-four products/exogenous substances (shown in the table below) that are
possibly encountered in stool samples were evaluated for potential inhibitory effects.
Each interfering substance was evaluated at its “worst case” concentration, against
two C. difficile strains (ATCC BAA-1805, ATCC 43255). Additionally, Cary-Blair
media was tested. None of the 34 substances or the Cary-Blair media tested in this
study showed any inhibitory effect on the detection of C. difficile when using the
CDF Test.

i. Assay cut-off:
The presence or absence of each target analyte was determined by the mean intensity
of target capture spots relative to the Signal Detection Threshold (filter 1). With PCR
amplification of the extracted sample DNA, a significant difference was expected in
the signal intensity from toxigenic C. difficile bacteria-containing samples versus that
obtained from negative samples. The capture, mediator, and PCR primer
oligonucleotides in the CDF Test were designed to eliminate sequence-related cross-
reactivity, thereby ensuring that the non-specific target signal intensities at capture
spots are similar to the microarray background signal. In contrast, amplicon
hybridization to complementary capture and mediator probes were expected to give
high positive signals, well-separated from negative capture spots. When reading a
test slide, multiple images of each array were taken at increasing exposures times and
the final target group mean intensity value for an analyte was assigned at the shortest
exposure at which the value exceeds the Signal Detection Threshold. If the target
signal did not exceed the threshold for any exposure, the mean spot intensity was

The tcdC target was identified by unique captures that detect the tcdC-wild type (WT)
and tcdC-mutant (∆117) (MUT) genotypes. If one of the captures exceeded the
Signal Detection Threshold then tcdC was “Detected.” A second filter, the tcdC
Genotype Threshold, then distinguished between the tcdC-wild type and tcdC-mutant
(∆117). A tcdC genotype ratio was calculated from the individual tcdC-WT and -
MUT group mean intensities.
In order to demonstrate the appropriateness of the cut-off values for these two
thresholds, the target mean intensity values were examined for a panel of 59 C.
difficile strains in Negative Stool Matrix at a concentration of 3750CFU/mL – 5000
CFU/mL stool. Each strain was tested twice and the six probes on the microarray
(tcdA, tcdB, binary, tcdC, and the internal controls IC1, IC2) were compiled to
generate a set of 708 data points (118 tests x 6 targets per test).

Positive signals were well separated from the negative target signals, and the
threshold value distinguished the “True Positives” from the “True Negatives.”
j. Carry-Over & Cross-Contamination Study:
The potential for carry-over and cross-contamination to occur with the CDF Test on
the Verigene system was assessed by testing C. difficile negative samples after
running high positive (HP) samples. The toxigenic PCR ribotype 027 C. difficile
strain BAA-1805 was used for the study, and was added at a high titer of 5x106
CFU/mL stool into the Negative Stool Matrix to prepare the high positive sample.
The same Negative Stool Matrix was utilized as the C. difficile negative sample. In
the execution of the study, the high-titer sample was alternated with the negative
sample three times on three unique Verigene SP Processors, for a total of eighteen
individual tests.
CDF target analytes were not detected by the CDF Test in any of the nine negative
samples run immediately following the high-titer sample on three separate SP
Processors. Additionally, all nine high-titer samples accurately detected the expected
tcdA, tcdB, binary, and tcdC MUT targets. The study demonstrated that the CDF
assay does not exhibit carry-over or cross- contamination that could result in a false
positive test result.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical performance was determined by comparing the CDF Test results to reference
culture (i.e., direct toxigenic culture or enriched toxigenic culture) followed by cell
cytotoxicity testing on the isolates. Subsequent strain typing of the toxigenic strains
by PCR Ribotyping and bi-directional sequencing methods was used to confirm
toxigenic strains of C. difficile.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable
3. Clinical studies:
Clinical performance characteristics of the CDF Test were determined in a multi-site
prospective investigational study at five U.S. institutions using 1,877 unformed stool
specimens from subjects whose routine care called for C. difficile testing. A portion of
each leftover residual unformed stool specimen was obtained for testing. The clinical
evaluation was carried out by comparing the CDF Test results to reference culture
followed by cell cytotoxicity testing on the isolates. Subsequent strain typing on
toxigenic strains by PCR ribotyping and bi-directional sequencing methods was used to
confirm toxigenic strains of C. difficile.
In parallel to Verigene CDF Testing, an aliquot of the same specimen was sent to a
reference laboratory for the reference culture and cytotoxin isolate testing. Each stool
specimen was inoculated onto pre-reduced CCFA-D (cycloserine-cefoxitin-fructose agar-
direct plate; “direct culture”) and CCMB-Tal (cycloserine cefoxitin mannitol broth with
taurocholate lysozyme cysteine). After 24 hours the CCMB-TAL was sub-cultured onto
a second CCFA-E plate (CCFA-Enriched; “enriched culture”).
If C. difficile was isolated from the CCFA-D plate and the isolate was positive by the cell
cytotoxicity assay, the specimen was classified as “toxigenic C. difficile positive” and the
CCFA-E plate was not further analyzed. If no C. difficile was isolated from the CCFA-D
plate or if the isolate was negative by the cell cytoxicity assay, the CCFA-E plate was
further analyzed. If CCFA-E was positive for C. difficile and the isolate was positive for
cell cytotoxicity assay, the specimen was classified as “toxigenic C. difficile positive.”
The specimen was reported as “negative” if CCFA-E was negative for C. difficile or the
isolate was tested negative by the cell cytotoxicity assay.
After central reference laboratory culture testing, the toxigenic C. difficile positive
isolates were sent for strain identification by PCR Ribotyping to an external third-party
17

--- Page 18 ---
site. In parallel, Verigene CDF Test extracted DNA from the culture-confirmed C.
difficile positive isolates were sent for tcdC bi-directional sequencing.
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Assay Performance vs. Direct Culture & PCR Ribotyping
Relative to direct culture with PCR ribotyping, the CDF Test demonstrated a sensitivity
and specificity for toxigenic C. difficile of 98.7% and 87.6%, respectively. The CDF Test
also demonstrated a 97.5% positive agreement and 97.8% agreement for the
hypervirulent C. difficile strain 027 by PCR ribotyping. The results are summarized in
the table below (this data combines all investigational sites).

aThere were 1,877 evaluable specimens enrolled in the clinical trial; 71 specimens (3.8%) required repeat
testing: 46 specimens (2.4%) had an initial “No Call” result due to assay internal control errors; 17
specimens (1.0%) had an initial “Indeterminate” call (No Call-IND), and 8 specimens (0.4%) had pre-
analytical errors (four motor stalls, two tip failures, one cracked slide and one cartridge not detected). The
eight specimens that experienced pre-analytical errors, and the 46 No Call specimens, were called upon
repeat testing; however, two of the No Call specimens required a second repeat test before being called.
Repeat testing of the 17 No Call-IND specimens called all but two specimens (five specimens required a

a There were 1,877 evaluable specimens enrolled in the clinical trial; 71 specimens (3.8%) required repeat
testing: 46 specimens (2.4%) had an initial “No Call” result due to assay internal control errors; 17
specimens (1.0%) had an initial “Indeterminate” call (No Call-IND), and 8 specimens (0.4%) had pre-
analytical errors (four motor stalls, two tip failures, one cracked slide and one cartridge not detected). The
eight specimens that experienced pre-analytical errors, and the 46 No Call specimens, were called upon
repeat testing; however, two of the No Call specimens required a second repeat test before being called.
Repeat testing of the 17 No Call-IND specimens called all but two specimens (five specimens required a
second repeat test before calling). Therefore, two specimens had a final “Indeterminate” call and were not
included in the clinical data analysis of evaluable results. Thus, 1,875 specimens were analyzed in this
clinical evaluation.
bOf the 1,875 specimens evaluated, two specimens were culture positive but were not sequenced because the
isolate was either not sent or the result was inconclusive. These two specimens were not included in the
performance characteristics above.

N. Instrument Name:
Verigene® System (Verigene Processor SP and Verigene Reader)
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Verigene System allows random access, fully automated ‘sample to result’ operation.
The Verigene System is comprised of two components: a Reader (user interface, central
control unit, optics for reading the absence or presence of bacterial DNA on the
microarray) and the Processor SP. The CDF test, performed on the Verigene System,
involves two steps:
· Sample preparation-Cell lysis and magnetic bead-based bacterial DNA isolation
from prepared Stool Lysis Buffer (SLB) samples, and
· Verigene Hybridization Test-Hybridization of bacterial-specific DNA to capture
oligonucleotides on a microarray, using gold nanoparticles probe-based
technology to aid detection.
Operationally, single use disposables (Extraction Tray, Utility Tray, and Test Cartridge)
are loaded into separate modules within the Processor SP. The only ‘user-performed’
pipetting step required to perform the assay is the addition of the prepared SLB sample
into the extraction tray. The sample preparation occurs within the Processor SP’s
Extraction Tray and is also aided by reagents present in the Utility Tray, while the
Verigene Hybridization Test occurs within the Test Cartridge. An automated pipette
