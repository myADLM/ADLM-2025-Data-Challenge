incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. After incubation the microtiter well strips are
washed with wash buffer to remove unbound antibodies and 100 µL of the anti-human IgG
enzyme conjugate reagent is added to each microtiter well. After additional 30-minutes
incubation at room temperature, the microtiter wells are again washed 3 times with 300 µL of
wash buffer to remove any unbound enzyme conjugate and 100 µL of the chromogen
substrate is added. The strips are incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature and 100 µl
stop solution is added. The microtiter plates are placed in an ELISA reader and read at a
wavelength of 450 nm and a reference wavelength of between 620 nm and 650 nm within 30
minutes.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Intra- and inter-assay reproducibility: The reproducibility of each of eight tests was
investigated for in the intra- and inter-assay using sera with values at different ratio.
The intra-assay based on 20 determinations and the inter-assay based on 40
determinations performed in 5 days, 2 runs/day with 4 replicate/run. The precision
data for all samples was analyzed to generate a summary of the qualitative
reproducibility of the assay. The results are summarized below:

Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, USA). The ANA reference panel include
native DNA, SS-B, RNP/SS-B/SS-A, RNP, Sm, U3-RNP, SS-A, Centromeres, Scl-
70, Jo-1, PM-Scl, and ribosomal P-proteins. All eight devices showed the expected
reactivity against the reference panel.
Calibrator and Controls: The cut-off calibrator and controls are derived from human
serum and match pre-specified performance criteria. Each lot of cut-off calibrator and
controls are traceable to a master lot.
Stability: Real time stability studies were conducted using three production lots of kit
reagents. The results support a shelf life claim of 12 months for all components when
stored at 2 – 8°C. The opened reagents are stable for 6 months when stored at 2 –
8°C. The reconstituted Wash Buffer is stable for up to 28 days.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity: To investigate the quality of the antigen coated on the plates to
ensure a high specificity of the ELISA, cross reactivity was investigative using a
panel of 30 sera containing antibodies serologically positive against the known
antigens. The panel of antibodies used to test antigen coated for each device listed in
the following table:

No cross reactivity is observed with the tested antibody panel for each device.
Endogenous interference: For each device, interference testing was performed by
using 5 serum samples with various ratio of each analyte (negative, positive and near
to cut-off). Samples were spiked with potential interfering substances, hemoglobin
(250, 500, and 1000 mg/dL), triglycerides (500, 1000, 2000 mg/dL), bilirubin (10, 20,
and 40 mg/dL) and rheumatoid factor (RF) (500 IU/mL). Recoveries of all spiked
sample/interferent combinations compared to the measurements for unspiked samples
were calculated. No significant interference was observed for concentrations of up to
1000 mg/dl for hemoglobin, 2000 mg/dl for triglyceride, 40 mg/dl for bilirubin and
500 IU/mL for RF,
f. Assay cut-off:
For each device, the assay cut-off is OD ratio of 1.0. Results > 1.0 are positive, and
results < 1.0 are negative.

from SLE patients and 500 from control groups) were evaluated for clinical
sensitivity and specificity with EUROIMMUN Anti-ribosomal P-proteins ELISA
(IgG). The results are summarized in the following table:
Anti-ribosomal P-proteins ELISA (IgG):

Panel N Positive % Positive 95% CI
SLE 376 20 5.3% 3.3 – 8.1%
Clinical Specificity
Panel N Negative % Negative 95% CI
Polymyositis/Dermatomyositis 151 149 98.7% 95.3 – 99.8%
RA 90 90 100.0% 96.0 – 100.0%
Systemic sclerosis 66 66 100.0% 94.6 – 100.0%
Sjögren’s syndrome 55 54 98.2% 90.3 – 100.0%
MCTD 45 44 97.8% 88.2 – 99.9%

Borreliosis(5) 30 30 100.0% 88.4 – 100.0%
Total 500 496 99.2% 98.0 – 99.8%
* Samples include: autoimmune hepatitis (n=8), primary biliary cirrhosis (n=9), Grave’s
disease (n=12), Hashimoto (n=11), celiac disease (n=11), Diabetes Type I (n=12)
b. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The levels of anti-nRNP/Sm, anti-Sm, anti-SS-A, anti-SS-B, anti-Scl-70, anti-
Centromeres, anti-Jo-1 in healthy people were investigated with a total of 200 samples
from apparently healthy blood donors (including 120 men and 80 women with an average
age of 40 years old; age range from 19 to 68 years). For anti-ribosomal P-proteins, 150
healthy blood donor samples were tested. The samples included 79 mean and 71 women
with an average age of 38 and age range from 18 to 67. The results are summarized in
the following table:
