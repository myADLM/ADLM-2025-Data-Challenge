I. Device Description:
This submission is for a single drug in the gram negative ID/AST or AST only panel.
The ID System was not reviewed.
The Phoenix AST method is a broth based microdilution test. The Phoenix panel is a
sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene tray, with 136 micro-wells containing
dried reagents. The ID/AST combination panel includes an ID side (51 wells) with dried
substrates for bacterial identification and an AST side (85 wells). The AST panel
contains a wide range of two-fold doubling dilution concentrations of antimicrobial
agents and growth and fluorescent controls at appropriate well locations. The AST panel
does not include wells for isolate identification.
The Phoenix System utilizes a redox indicator for the detection of organism growth in the
presence of an antimicrobial agent. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and
be preliminarily identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then
suspended in ID broth, and equated to a 0.5 McFarland suspension using a nephelometer
device. A further dilution is made into AST broth (a cation-adjusted formulation of
Mueller-Hinton broth containing 0.010% Tween 80), to which the redox-buffered
oxidation-reduction AST indicator solution is added producing a blue color in the wells.
The concentration of organisms in the final AST broth suspension is approximately 5 X
105 CFU/mL.
The Phoenix AST Broth is poured into the inoculation port of the AST panel and the
inoculum flows into the panel, filling panel wells. Polyethylene caps are applied to seal
the inoculation ports. An air admittance port is located in the panel lid to ensure adequate
oxygen tension in the panel for the duration of the test. Inoculated panels are barcode
scanned and loaded into the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System instrument
where panels are continuously incubated at 35˚ C ± 1˚ C.
Continuous measurements of changes to the indicator as well as bacterial turbidity are
used in the determination of bacterial growth. The instrument takes readings every 20
minutes. Organisms growing in the presence of a given antimicrobial agent reduce the
indicator (changing it to a pink color). This signals organism growth and resistance to
that antimicrobial agent. Organisms killed or inhibited by the antimicrobial agent do not
cause reduction of the indicator and therefore do not produce a color change. The
Phoenix instrument reads and records the results of the antimicrobial tests contained in
the panel and interprets the reactions (based on the organism identification) to give a
minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) value and category interpretations (susceptible,
intermediate, resistant or not susceptible). AST results are available within 4 to 16 hours.
This is an autoread result; no manual readings are possible with this system. Additional
comments concerning specific organism/antimicrobial combinations is provided from the
software-driven “EXPERT” system, using rules derived from CLSI documentation.
Ertapenem is a penem antibacterial indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe
infections caused by susceptible bacteria.

The AST portion of the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System is a broth-based
microdilution method that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-reduction) to
enhance detection of organism growth. The MIC is determined by comparing growth in
wells containing serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the growth in growth control
wells which contain no antibiotic.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing was conducted at two external sites and one internal site.
Testing was performed using inocula prepared manually and standardized using both
the PhoenixSpec nephelometer and using the BD Phoenix AP instrument. Results
were compared to the modal range.
Ten on-scale organisms were provided to the testing sites by BD with isolate
identification and expected MIC results blinded to the testers. Isolates were prepared

A sufficient number of tests were performed and all quality control results fell within
the acceptable ranges demonstrating that the BD Phoenix System can consistently
produce quality control results in the recommended range for ertapenem.
Growth Failure Rate: All clinical isolates tested grew in the Phoenix panels; the
overall growth rate was 100%.
Purity Check Plates were inoculated from the standardized organism suspensions
for both the Phoenix and reference methods. Any isolate that showed mixed growth
on the purity check plate was considered noncompliant and not included in result
analysis.
Inoculum Density Control: The BD PhoenixSpec Nephelometer was used to
prepare the inocula for testing of the clinical, challenge, reproducibility and QC
isolates. The same inoculum suspension was used for both the Phoenix System and
reference method testing. The BD Phoenix AP instrument and the BD PhoenixSpec
were used to standardize the inocula for challenge, QC and reproducibility isolates.
The calibration of both instruments was verified each day of testing. Validation data
for both the PhoenixSpec and the Phoenix AP instrument was provided and found to
be acceptable.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The accuracy of results obtained with the Phoenix System was determined by
comparison to the CLSI-recommended broth dilution method (reference method) at
three testing sites in the U.S. Reference panels were prepared according to CLSI
M07-A8 guidelines. Sites performed testing on gram-negative isolates using Phoenix
and reference panel formats appropriate for gram negative organisms. Antimicrobial
agents in the test and reference panels had identical dilution ranges which were
appropriate for the interpretive breakpoints of the drug. Testing was performed using
at least two different production lots of Phoenix panels, AST broth and AST indicator
at each study site. A minimum of three different lots of the Phoenix panel were used
across all sites for the entire study. Phoenix and reference panels were inoculated
using the same organism suspension.

--- Page 8 ---
Growth in the Phoenix panels was determined from data recorded by the instrument.
Performance was analyzed using FDA breakpoints for ertapenem, and results were
compared to results obtained in the reference method based on the guidelines
provided in the Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial
Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems.
A total of 1064 clinical isolates were tested at the three study sites and included both
fresh and stock isolates. Clinical isolates tested included representatives of all species
listed in the FDA pharmaceutical drug label. Clinical isolates were tested using
inocula prepared using the PhoenixSpec nephelometer.
A total of 137 challenge isolates were supplied to the testing sites by the sponsor.
Challenge isolates were obtained from BD’s internal collection and from external
laboratories. Results obtained for Challenge isolates using the Phoenix System were
compared to expected MIC results; expected MIC values and categorical
interpretations were derived from testing with multiple lots of reference microbroth
dilution panels over a three-month period. The challenge set was divided into subsets
and an individual subset was distributed to each of the three study sites.
Identification and expected results were masked to the study sites. The inocula for
the challenge isolates were prepared using both the PhoenixSpec (primary method)
and the Phoenix AP instrument (secondary method).
In response to a request from the FDA, additional challenge isolates, some with MICs
close to the established breakpoints, were tested in house. Results from these
additional isolates are included in the Challenge isolate results below.
The performance evaluation summary of essential and categorical agreement results
for clinical, challenge and additional challenge isolates with inocula prepared using
the PhoenixSpec (manual method) is shown in the table below:

EA = Essential Agreement CA = Category Agreement
R = Resistant Isolates min = minor discrepancies
maj = major discrepancies vmj = very major discrepancies
Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the result of the
reference method and that of BD Phoenix within plus or minus one serial two-fold
dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that are on scale for both the BD
Phoenix panel and the reference method. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the
interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees exactly with the
interpretation of the BD Phoenix result.

For the clinical and challenge organism testing performed for ertapenem using the BD
Phoenix, the overall % EA and % CA consistently met the acceptance criteria of
greater than or equal to 90%. There were 2 major errors (0.2%) (acceptance criteria ≤
3%) and no very major errors.
Essential agreement of evaluable results was 88.5%, partly due to a limited number of
on-scale results for both clinical and challenge isolates. The majority of isolates that
gave Phoenix results that differed from the reference method by more than one serial
two-fold dilution showed more resistance than did the reference method. Overall
there were 2 major errors and no very major errors.
There were no instances of growth failure with either clinical or challenge isolates.
For challenge isolates two methods of organism suspension standardization were used
in the evaluation of ertapenem with the Phoenix System. Suspensions were prepared
using both the PhoenixSpec (manual method) and the automated Phoenix AP
instrument (automated method).
