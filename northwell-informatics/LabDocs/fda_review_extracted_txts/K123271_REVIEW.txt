microparticle for antibody binding sites of the phenobarbital antibody reagent (mouse). The
phenobarbital-coated microparticle reagent is rapidly agglutinated in the presence of the anti-
phenobarbital antibody reagent and in the absence of any competing drug in the sample. The
rate of absorbance change is measured photometrically, and is directly proportional to the
rate of agglutination of the particles. When a sample containing phenobarbital is added, the
agglutination reaction is partially inhibited, slowing down the rate of absorbance change. A
concentration dependent classic agglutination inhibition curve can be obtained, with
maximum rate of agglutination at the lowest phenobarbital concentration and the lowest
agglutination rate at the highest phenobarbital concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Performance was established on the Abbott ARCHITECT c8000 Clinical Chemistry
Analyzer. The data summarized below is the data generated on the ARCHITECT c8000
System.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The inter-assay precision study was performed on one Abbott ARCHITECT c8000
systems clinical analyzer with two reagent lots. Three serum based control levels and
6 serum samples (pooled patient serum samples and negative serum pools spiked with
phenobarbital concentrations at 5 levels (5, 10, 20, 40 and 80µg/ml)) were used for
the precision study. Each phenobarbital sample was assayed in replicates of two,
twice a day for 20 days for a total of 40 runs resulting in a total of 80 replicates for
each instrument/lot. Results are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The claimed assay range is 2.0μg/mL to 80.0μg/mL. The high sample contained
human serum spiked with a phenobarbital reference standard. The high sample was
diluted with negative serum for 10 concentrations across the entire assay range (and
included samples extending above and below the assay range). Each dilution was
tested in replicates of four. Regression analysis of each dilution showed that the
samples were linear throughout the claimed range (y=1.0555x-0.5813, R2=0.998).
The recovery of all serum samples relative to the expected concentration based on the
standard material and dilution factors, ranged between 92.7 – 109.4%
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrators used in this submission were cleared under k120936. The controls
used in this submission were cleared under k032826.
d. Detection limit:
CLSI EP17-A2 was followed to determine the limit of blank (LoB). The samples
were run with two lots of reagents on one instrument. Testing consisted of 4
replicates of five phenobarbital-free human serum samples tested each day for 3 days.
Calculations were performed according to CLSI EP17-A2. The LoB was determined
at 0.29µg/mL.
CLSI EP17-A2 was followed to determine the limit of detection (LoD). The Samples

replicates of six low level samples at phenobarbital concentrations of 0.25, 0.50, 0.82,
1.21, 1.61 and 2.00µg/mL tested each day per day for 3 days. The LoD was
determined at 0.41µg/mL.
CLSI EP17-A2 was followed to determine the limit of quantitation (LoQ). The
samples were run with two lots of reagents. Testing consisted of 3 replicates of five
low level samples at phenobarbital concentrations of 0.25, 0.50, 1.00, 2.50 and
5.00µg/mL tested twice per day for 7 days. Results from one lot of reagents yielded
bias (SD) ≤ 0.12 ug/mL when these five samples were compared to the reference
value. LoQ is based on an inter-assay precision of 7% CV at 2.0 ug/ml. The sponsor
concluded that LoQ is 2.0 ug/mL.

e. Analytical specificity:
Serum samples spiked with two levels of phenobarbital near the upper and lower
therapeutic ranges were supplemented with the below interfering compounds. Each
test and control sample were run in duplicates and the percent cross reactivity (%
cross reactivity) was calculated (Measured concentration minus Expected
concentration) divided by Drug Concentration Tested multiplied by 100. All %
recovery results were within 100%±10%.

The Phenobarbital assay (On-test) for the ARCHITECT c8000 System was compared
to the Abbott Aeroset® Phenobarbital Assay by testing 118 serum specimens
commercially obtained (all natural ) with phenobarbital concentrations ranging from 5
to 80ug/mL. Correlation studies were performed using a modified CLSI guideline
EP9-A2 and analysis was based on a single measurement of each sample. Results are

b. Matrix comparison:
The suitability of additional matrices, anticoagulants, or collection tubes was
evaluated using drug-free paired donor samples to compare serum in glass (method
used in method comparison) with the matrices listed below. Twenty-two to twenty-
five samples were spiked with phenobarbital into each paired matrix sample at
multiple concentrations spanning the assay range. A singlet set of data was evaluated
and the slope, intercept and correlation coefficient determined.

4. Clinical cut-off:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor has referenced the following expected values from literature1 in the package
insert:
The desired therapeutic effect is usually achieved in the serum concentration range of 15
to 40µg/mL (65 to 172 umol/L). Concentrations of 35 to 80µg/mL (151 to 345umol/L)
are associated with slowness, ataxia, and nystagmus. Concentrations of 65 to 117 µg/mL
(280 to 504 umol/L) are associated with coma with reflexes. Concentrations of >100
µg/mL (>430 umol/L) are associated with coma without reflexes. For effective treatment,
some patients may require serum levels outside these ranges. Therefore, the expected
range is provided only as a guide, and individual patient results should be interpreted in
light of other clinical signs and symptoms.
