H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use:
The Prodesse® ProGastro SSCS Assay is a multiplex real time PCR in vitro
diagnostic test for the qualitative detection and differentiation of Salmonella,
Shigella, and Campylobacter (C. jejuni and C. coli only, undifferentiated) nucleic
acids and Shiga Toxin 1 (stx1) and Shiga Toxin 2 (stx2) genes. Shiga toxin
producing E. coli (STEC) typically harbor one or both genes that encode for Shiga
Toxins 1 and 2. Nucleic acids are isolated and purified from preserved stool
specimens obtained from symptomatic patients exhibiting signs and symptoms of
gastroenteritis. This test is intended for use, in conjunction with clinical
presentation and epidemiological risk factors, as an aid in the differential
diagnosis of Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter jejuni/Campylobacter coli, and
STEC infections in humans.
The results of this test should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis,
treatment, or other patient management decisions. Positive results do not rule out
co-infection with other organisms that are not detected by this test, and may not be
the sole or definitive cause of patient illness. Negative ProGastro SSCS Assay
results in the setting of clinical illness compatible with gastroenteritis may be due
to infection by pathogens that are not detected by this test or non-infectious causes
such as ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, or Crohn’s disease.
2. Indication for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
The bioMerieux NucliSENS easyMAG system is used for nucleic acid isolation
from stool samples.
The Cepheid SmartCycler II Real Time instrument with Dx software version 1.7b
or 3.0a/b is used to perform PCR amplification and detection of nucleic acid.
Several other Prodesse Assays have been cleared for use with the above
instrumentation systems: Prodesse ProFlu+ (k110968), Pro hMPV+ (k082688),

I. Device Description:
The ProGastro SSCS Assay enables detection and differentiation of Salmonella,
Shigella, Campylobacter (C. jejuni and C. coli only, undifferentiated) and an
Internal Control in the SSC Mix, and Shiga Toxin 1 (stx1) and Shiga Toxin 2 (stx2)
genes and an Internal Control in the STEC Mix. Shiga toxin producing E. coli
(STEC) typically harbor one or both genes that encode for Shiga Toxins 1 and 2.
An overview of the procedure is as follows:
1. Collect raw stool specimens from symptomatic patients placed into Cary Blair
(CB) or ParaPak C&S Transport Medium (C&S).
2. Dilute stool preserved in CB or C&S 1:10 in CB or C&S Medium. Add an
Internal Control to every sample to monitor for inhibitors present in the
specimens.
3. Perform isolation and purification of nucleic acids using a NucliSENS
easyMAG System (bioMérieux) and the Automated Magnetic Extraction
Reagents (bioMérieux).
4. Add purified nucleic acids to the SSC Mix included in the ProGastro SSCS Kit.
The SSC Mix contains target-specific oligonucleotide primers and
oligonucleotide probes for detection of Salmonella, Shigella, and
Campylobacter (C. jejuni and C. coli only). The primers are complementary to
highly conserved regions of genetic sequences for these organisms. The probes
are dual-labeled with a reporter dye and a quencher (see table below).
5. Add purified nucleic acids to the STEC Mix included in the ProGastro SSCS
Kit. The STEC Mix contains target-specific oligonucleotide primers and
oligonucleotide probes for detection of the Shiga Toxins 1 and 2 genes (stx1 and
stx2). The primers are complementary to highly conserved regions of genetic
sequences for these organisms. The probes are dual-labeled with a reporter dye
and a quencher (see table below).
6. Perform amplification of DNA in a Cepheid SmartCyclerII instrument. In this
process, the probe anneals specifically to the template followed by primer
extension and amplification. The ProGastro SSCS Assay is based on Taqman
reagent chemistry, which utilizes the 5’ – 3’ exonuclease activity of the Taq
polymerase to cleave the probe thus separating the reporter dye from the
quencher. This generates an increase in fluorescent signal upon excitation from
a light source. With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved
from their respective probes, further increasing fluorescent signal. The amount
of fluorescence at any given cycle is dependent on the amount of amplification
products present at that time. Fluorescent intensity is monitored during each
PCR cycle by the real-time instrument.

• Draft Guidance on Establishing the Performance Characteristics of In Vitro
Diagnostic Devices for the Detection of Clostridium difficile
L. Test Principle:
The real-time PCR process simultaneously amplifies and detects nucleic acid targets
in two separate closed-tube reactions. The ProGastro SSCS Assay enables detection
and differentiation of Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter (C. jejuni and C. coli
only, undifferentiated) and an Internal Control in the SSC Mix (the first tube), and
Shiga Toxin 1 (stx1) and Shiga Toxin 2 (stx2) genes and an Internal Control in the
STEC Mix (the second tube), and is based on two processes: nucleic acid isolation
and Real Time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification/detection. The
Gastro RNA/DNA Internal Control (GIC) is added to each preserved stool specimen
from symptomatic patient to monitor for inhibitors present. Nucleic acids are
isolated and purified from the stool specimen. Purified nucleic acid is added to the
SSC Mix and the STEC Mix. The SSC Mix and STEC Mix contain target specific
oligonucleotide primers and oligonucleotide probes dual-labeled with a reporter dye
attached to the 5’ end and a quencher dye attached to the 3’ end. Amplification
proceeds during which the primers and probes anneal specifically to the templates
(if present) followed by primer extension and amplification. The ProGastro SSCS
Assay is based on Taqman chemistry, which utilizes the 5’ – 3’ exonuclease activity
of the Taq polymerase to cleave the probe thus separating the reporter dye from the
quencher. This generates an increase in fluorescent signal upon excitation from a
light source. With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved from
their respective probes, further increasing the fluorescent signal. The amount of
fluorescence at any given cycle is dependent on the amount of amplification product
present at that time. Fluorescent intensity is monitored during each PCR cycle by
the real-time instrument.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Inter-Laboratory Reproducibility Study
An Inter-Laboratory Reproducibility study was conducted at three independent
clinical laboratories: two external sites and one internal site at Gen-Probe
Prodesse Inc. Panels of samples were tested by two operators at each site and
each operator tested for a total of five days resulting in 10 runs per Mix per site.
Panel samples were generated by dividing and spiking a ProGastro SSCS
negative stool pool with combinations of five different bacterial strains detected
by the ProGastro SSCS Assay including Salmonella enterica serotype
Enteritidis (Salmonella Enteritidis), Shigella sonnei, Campylobacter jejuni,
Campylobacter coli, and Shiga Toxin producing E. coli (STEC). The simulated
positive samples were spiked at two different concentrations with each spiked
sample containing the following combined targets: Salmonella (Sal)/C. jejuni
(CJ) or Shigella (Shi)/C. coli (Cc)/STEC. The simulated High Negative samples
8

--- Page 9 ---
were spiked at one concentration with each spiked sample containing all five of
the targets: Salmonella/C. jejuni/Shigella/C. coli/STEC. Each Reproducibility
Panel consisted of three Medium Positives and three Low Positives for each of
the two sample group (n= 2 x 6 =12), and three High Negatives (n=3) for a total
of 15 samples per panel. The High Negative concentration for each organism
was at 4 logs below each bacterial strain’s LoD. The Low Positive
concentration was at 2x Assay LoD and the Medium Positive concentration was
at 1 log above the Assay LoD for all target strains except the C. jejuni and C.
coli strains. C. jejuni Low Positives were tested at 20x LoD and Medium
Positives at 2 logs above LoD and the C. coli Low Positives at 0.5 log above 2x
LoD, and Medium Positives at 1.5 logs above LoD. The Campylobacter strains
were tested at higher concentrations because Campylobacter is very sensitive to
environmental stressors including freezing where it loses viability. In-house
studies (QC testing of Positive Matrix Controls and Verification Panels for the
Clinical Study and QC testing of spiked stool pools for Reproducibility) have
demonstrated decreased amount of Campylobacter DNA (increasing Ct values)
over time.
Note: The average Ct value for the C. jejuni (ATCC 33291) Low Positives was
37.3, which is very close to the average Ct value of 38.8 for the same C. jejuni
strain tested at the estimated LoD level in the Analytical Reactivity Study. The
average Ct value for the C. coli (ATCC BAA-371) Low Positives was 35.6,
which is very close to the average Ct value of 34.4 for the same C. coli strain
tested at the estimated LoD level in the Analytical Reactivity Study. It appears
that the effective DNA concentrations of the C. jejuni (ATCC 33291) and C.
coli (ATCC BAA-371) low positive samples tested in the Reproducibility Study
are very close to the estimated LoD DNA concentrations for these two strains
tested in the Analytical Reactivity Study. Therefore the levels of the C. jejuni

The Panels were stored at ≤–70oC and delivered frozen. One Panel was used for
each of the five testing days per operator per site, generating a total of 90 data
points per organism target per concentration (i.e., 3
replicates/organism/concentration/operator/day/site x 2 operators/site x 3 sites x
5 days = 90 data points/organism/concentration). The samples were extracted
each day using the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG and the extracted nucleic
acids were tested with the ProGastro SSCS Assay on the Cepheid SmartCycler
II. ProGastro SSCS Assay controls (Positive, Positive Matrix, and Negative)
were also included with each panel run. Two lots of ProGastro SSCS Assay
SSC and STEC Mixes were used by each of the three sites.
A summary of the Reproducibility Study data is presented in the two tables

* Note: The Campylobacter strains were tested at higher concentrations because Campylobacter is very
sensitive to environmental stressors including freezing where it loses viability. However, the average Ct value
for the C. jejuni (ATCC 33291) Low Positives was 37.3, which is very close to the average Ct value of 38.8 for
the same C. jejuni strain tested at the estimated LoD level in the Analytical Reactivity Study. The average Ct
value for the C. coli (ATCC BAA-371) Low Positives was 35.6, which is very close to the average Ct value of

34.4 for the same C. coli strain tested at the estimated LoD level in the Analytical Reactivity Study. Therefore,
the effective DNA concentrations of the C. jejuni (ATCC 33291) and C. coli (ATCC BAA-371) low positive
samples tested in the Reproducibility Study are very close to the estimated LoD DNA concentrations for these
two strains tested in the Analytical Reactivity Study.

Intra-Laboratory Reproducibility Study
An Intra-Laboratory Precision study was conducted internally at Gen-Probe Prodesse
Inc. Panels of samples were tested by two operators and each operator tested for a total
of 12 days resulting in 24 runs per PCR Mix. Panel samples were generated as
described previously in the Inter-Laboratory Reproducibility Study. One Panel was
used for each of the 12 testing days per operator. The samples were extracted each day
using the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG and the extracted nucleic acids were
tested with the ProGastro SSCS Assay on the Cepheid SmartCycler II. ProGastro
SSCS Assay controls (Positive, Positive Matrix, and Negative) were also included with
each panel run. Two lots of ProGastro SSCS Assay SSC and STEC Mixes were used
by each of the operators.
A summary of the Intra-Laboratory Precision Study data is presented in the tables

* Note: The Campylobacter strains were tested at higher concentrations because Campylobacter is very sensitive to
environmental stressors including freezing where it loses viability. However, the average Ct value for the C. jejuni
(ATCC 33291) Low Positives was 37.3, which is very close to the average Ct value of 38.8 for the same C. jejuni strain
tested at the estimated LoD level in the Analytical Reactivity Study. The average Ct value for the C. coli (ATCC BAA-
371) Low Positives was 35.6, which is very close to the average Ct value of 34.4 for the same C. coli strain tested at the
estimated LoD level in the Analytical Reactivity Study. Therefore, the effective DNA concentrations of the C. jejuni
(ATCC 33291) and C. coli (ATCC BAA-371) low positive samples tested in the Precision Study are very close to the
estimated LoD DNA concentrations for these two strains tested in the Analytical Reactivity Study.

Assay Controls
The following controls are provided in the ProGastro SSCS Assay kit:
Positive Controls (PCs): The ProGastro SSCS Assay kit contains an SSCS Positive
DNA Control and a C. Coli Positive DNA Control. Both PCs are DNA plasmids
containing portions of the Assay target genes of interest. The SSCS Control (PC1)
plasmid contains approximately 200 bp of target sequence for each of the following
organisms or genes: Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella, Shigella, stx1 and stx2. The
SSCS Control is used with both the SSC Mix and the STEC Mix. The C. coli Control
(PC2) plasmid contains a 403 bp target sequence specific for Campylobacter coli. The
C. Coli Control is used with the SSC Mix only. The PCs do not go through nucleic
acid isolation and purification, but are included during set-up of the PCR reaction.
The PCs in conjunction with the IC are used to verify reagent and system performance.
The SSCS Control (PC1, SAP# 403324) and the C. coli Control (PC2, SAP# 403328)
are sold at 1x104 c/µL and should be used at 1x103 copies/µL.
Because the PC is meant to assess global failure of the assay (reagent, technical,
instrument failure, etc.) and the customer variance components were to be determined
during the clinical trial, a broad Ct range was desired. The acceptable Ct range was set
to 20.0 to 45.0 in the Clinical Trial Protocol for all targets (except Shigella: 20.0 to
37.0).

Of a total of 77 PC1 tested by the ProGastro SSCS Assay during the clinical trial,
100% (77/77) of these controls gave correct results. The average Ct of the PC1s tested
was 31.5 (Min 29.1- Max 34.4), with 1.1 Standard Deviation (STDEV) and 3.6% CV;
27.6 (Min 25.3- Max 30.8), with 1.1 STDEV and 4.0%; 29.2 (Min 27.2- Max 31.2),
with 1.1 STDEV and 3.6 % CV; 30.7 (Min 29.6- Max 32.5), with 0.6 STDEV and 1.8
% CV; and 28.5 (Min 27.5- Max 30.3), with 0.6 STDEV and 2.2%, for the
Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella, Shigella, stx1, and stx2, respectively. The
prospective clinical study data validated the pre-determined PC1 Ct acceptance range
of 20.0 to 45.0 for Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella, stx1, and stx2, and 20.0 to 37.0
for Shigella.
Of a total of 77 PC2 tested by the ProGastro SSCS Assay during the clinical trial,
100% (77/77) of these controls gave correct results. The average Ct of the PC2s tested
was 28.9 (Min 26.8- Max 34.2), with 1.6 Standard Deviation (STDEV) and 5.6% CV
for Campylobacter coli. The prospective clinical study data validated the pre-
determined PC2 Ct acceptance range of 20.0 to 45.0 for Campylobacter coli.
Internal Control (IC): A Gastro RNA/DNA Internal Control (GIC) consisting of a
pooled non-infectious DNA plasmid and RNA transcript is incorporated into every
sample and is carried through all steps of the procedure from nucleic acid isolation and
purification through amplification to monitor for inhibitors present in the specimen or
reaction tube. The GIC contains a DNA and an RNA portion to allow for one nucleic
acid extract to be used with multiple RT-PCR/PCR assays whether the assay detects a
DNA or an RNA target. The GIC also serves as a general process control ensuring
that each step of the procedure was performed correctly, assay and instrument
parameters were set correctly, and that general reagents were working. The GIC
should be used at 5x105 c/µL for the RNA and 1x103 c/µL DNA portion, and sold at
5x107 c/µL for the RNA and 1x105 c/µL for the DNA portion.
The IC is meant to assess global failure (reagent or process) and monitor for PCR
inhibition. Because the IC is assessing global failure and the customer variance
components were to be determined during the clinical trial, a broad Ct range was
desired. The acceptable range for the Internal Control (IC) was set to 13 - 45 Ct in the
Clinical Trial Protocol. For the SSC Mix, the average Ct of all eligible prospective
ProGastro SSCS Assay negative clinical specimens was 33.8 (Min 31.2- Max 44.2),
with 1.60 Standard Deviation (STDEV) and 4.70 % CV. The average Ct of all eligible
ProGastro SSCS Assay Negative Control was 34.4 (Min 33.0- Max 36.2), with 0.6
Standard Deviation (STDEV) and 1.90% CV. For the STEC Mix, the average Ct of all
eligible prospective ProGastro SSCS Assay negative clinical specimens was 33.6 (Min
31.3- Max 42.6), with 1.60 Standard Deviation (STDEV) and 4.80 % CV. The average
Ct of all eligible ProGastro SSCS Assay Negative Control was 34.1 (Min 33.1- Max
36.2), with 0.5 Standard Deviation (STDEV) and 1.50% CV. The prospective clinical
study data validated the pre-determined IC Ct acceptance range of 13.0 to 45.0.

Kit Control Final Release Specifications
Final release specifications were established during Test Method Characterization
(TMC) and then validated against the appropriate analytical performance
characteristics of specificity and total imprecision.
Final release specifications were developed to ensure First Pass Acceptance (FPA)
rates of ≥ 99% at lot release and customer rejection rate of ≤ 1% for a lot released at
Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) (i.e. 95% probability of QC lot acceptance at lot
release). For customer specifications, the maximum allowable customer lot rejection
rate at the Rejectable Quality Level (RQL) Limit (i.e. 10% probability of QC
acceptance at lot release) is 1%. A false valid risk of ≤ 5% was used to determine the
validity specifications.
QC release specification ranges were set using Operator Characteristics (OC) curve
analysis. Lot, technician, instrument, run, and replicate variance components were
obtained during test method characterization. Observed Ct means were adjusted for
stability effects and specifications determined to meet the validity and specification
requirements above.

transport media (SPTM, Para-Pak C&S or Cary-Blair) spiked with the GIC is to be
used as the negative control and processed starting from nucleic acid isolation. The
negative control serves to monitor for contamination.
A Positive Matrix Control was included in the ProGastro SSCS Clinical Study
but is not provided in the ProGastro SSCS Assay kit:

Positive Matrix Control (PMC): The Positive Matrix Control used in the clinical study
is a pool of the ProGastro SSCS Assay target organisms (see the table below) diluted
in SPTM and spiked into negative stool matrix. The PMC was included with each
nucleic acid isolation run performed for the Clinical and Reproducibility/Precision
studies. The PMC served to monitor for lysis and during nucleic acid isolation.

A total of 136 runs were attempted in the clinical trial and there were no run failures
due to PMC failure.
The sponsor is also recommending the following in the product package insert: “Good
laboratory practice recommends including a positive extraction control (e.g.
previously characterized positive sample or negative sample spiked with a well
characterized ProGastro SSCS Assay target strain) in each nucleic acid isolation run.
The extraction control should be treated like a sample during assay performance and
analysis.”
Specimen and Nucleic Acid Stability Study (Fresh vs. Frozen Study)
An analytical study was conducted to determine the effect that storing (refrigerated)
and freezing stool preserved in Stool Preservation and Transport Media (SPTM,
ParaPak C&S) as well as the effects of freezing the resultant purified nucleic acids
have on the performance of the ProGastro SSCS Assay
In this study, contrived samples were generated using separate aliquots from a
ProGastro SSCS negative stool pool spiked with one strain of Salmonella, Shigella,
Campylobacter jejuni, and Shiga Toxin producing E. coli (STEC) representing the four
bacterial targets of the ProGastro SSCS Assay. Due to the fact that natural fresh
positive samples were not available for this study, samples were made at varying
concentrations in negative stool matrix preserved in SPTM (ParaPak C&S).
The contrived sample panel was prepared so that approximately 60% of the samples
had analyte levels close to their LoD. Of the samples near LoD, approximately 50%
were tested at LoD and the other half were Moderate Positive (3 x LoD) samples. The
remaining positive samples were tested at 1, 2, and 3 logs above the LoD for each
bacterial strain. Therefore, for each of the four strains, ten samples were generated
(n=40) in the following manner: one sample each at 3 logs, 2 logs, and 1 log above
LoD, four samples of 3x LoD, and three samples at LoD. See the table below:

After sample generation, a portion of each fresh prepared sample was extracted on the
bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG. The remaining portions of the samples were stored
refrigerated (2-8°C) for five days (120 hours) and then extracted again as described
above. After refrigeration for five days, the remaining portion of each sample were
frozen solid at ≤-70ºC for a minimum of 24 hours and then thawed and extracted as
described above. At each time point, the nucleic acids were run “fresh” (i.e.,
immediately subsequent to extraction) in a single replicate using one lot of ProGastro
SSCS reagents. The remaining nucleic acids (NA) were then frozen at <-70°C for a
minimum of 24 hours and later thawed on ice and subject to PCR as described above.
The data generated was analyzed for possible negative effects of storing and freezing
preserved stool samples and freezing purified nucleic acids when used in conjunction
with the ProGastro SSCS Assay.
Positive and Negative percent agreements were calculated and compared to the Fresh
Stool Sample/Fresh NA (FR ST/FR NA) data. Each bacterial strain and each
concentration were required to not test statistically significantly different in terms of
positive/negative result (percent agreement) (p<0.05) for all testing
points/concentrations to be deemed equivalent. A paired t-test of Ct values compared
to FR ST/FR NA was also performed for positive samples at all testing points and
analyzed for informational purposes.
First, the number of positive samples was identified at each concentration at each
strain for the fresh samples. The remaining testing points were compared to those
numbers to determine the percent agreement to the initial control result:

The data in the table above show that there are statistically significant differences
between the testing points indicated in the boxes with an “*” and the original testing
point (fresh stool and fresh nucleic acid). The “Mean Ct Difference to initial FR
ST/FR NA Data” table shows that the largest mean difference is associated with the C.
jejuni samples after they were frozen. A noticeable difference in the performance of
simulated Campylobacter samples upon freezing has also been observed by comparing
initial QC testing data for the Positive Matrix Control, and the Reproducibility
samples. Even though statistically significant differences in Mean Ct do exist for each
PCR Mix at different testing points via the paired t-test analysis, the ProGastro SSCS
Assay is not a quantitative, but a qualitative assay. The fact that all samples tested
positive for their correct target at all testing points meeting the requirement stated in
the study plan (i.e., all samples must not test statistically significantly different
(p≤0.05) from their fresh testing point in terms of positive/negative result) supports the
claim that there are no significant negative effects due to freezing samples/nucleic
acids. However, the observed negative effects of freezing samples with regard to
Campylobacter detection are included in the “Sample Collection, Handling, and
Storage” and the “Warnings and Precautions” sections of the package insert.
In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate there is no significant negative
effect on the ProGastro SSCS Assay in target organism detection due to storing
samples at refrigerated temperature (2-8°C) for up to five days, samples undergoing a
single freeze/thaw, or nucleic acids undergoing a single freeze/thaw. The data does
show a marked, statistically significant difference in Mean Ct for the contrived C.
jejuni samples once they are frozen and tested. This freezing effect had also been
noted subsequent to performing this study. This phenomenon has also been described
in literature in that Campylobacter is very sensitive to environmental stressors
including freezing where it loses viability. In addition, the ProGastro SSCS Clinical
Study data supports the use of frozen samples as the majority of Prospective Clinical
Study samples were stored frozen prior to testing, and the performance of the
ProGastro SSCS Assay is acceptable. This study results also support the use of frozen
banked retrospective clinical samples in the evaluation of the ProGastro SSCS Assay
to supplement the prospective clinical study data.

Reagent Stability and Freeze/Thaw Study
An Accelerated Stability study concluded that the ProGastro SSCS Assay Mixes (SSC
Mix and STEC Mix) and controls (closed and open tubes) can be stored at ≤ -70oC for
up to 18 months. Real time stability studies are currently ongoing at Gen-Probe
Prodesse, Inc.
A Freeze/Thaw Study demonstrated that the SSC Mix and the STEC Mix can each
undergo up to 10 freeze-thaws. The controls (Positive and Internal Controls) can
undergo up to two freeze-thaws. For the controls, the ProGastro SSCS Assay Package
Insert specifies that they should not undergo more than one freeze-thaw cycle,
although internal studies demonstrated that up to two freeze-thaws of controls would
not adversely affect performance.
d. Detection limit:
To determine and confirm the Limit of Detection (LoD) of the ProGastro SSCS Assay
on the Cepheid SmartCycler II, an analytical study was carried out using fresh
bacterial cultures for each detection target (Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter (C.
jejuni and C. coli only), and Shiga Toxin producing E. coli, STEC). Analytical
Sensitivity (LoD) is defined as the lowest concentration of bacteria detected ≥95% of
the time.
Fresh bacterial cultures were used for both the LoD Determination and the LoD
Confirmation studies, as well as plating for CFU/mL counting. The bacterial strains
tested in the studies are outlined in the table below:
Limit of Detection Panel Strains
Strain Strain ID
Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi ATCC6539
Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium BAA-1603
Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis BAA-1045
Shigella boydii ATCC9207
Shigella dysenteriae ATCC29027
Shigella flexneri ATCC12025
Shigella sonnei ATCC29029
Campylobacter jejuni BAA-224

STEC O26:H/NM (stx1-/stx2+) TW08569
STEC O157:H7 (stx1+/stx2-) TW00975
The LoD Determination portion of this study included freshly cultured bacteria that
were serially diluted, spiked into pooled negative stool matrix, and tested minimally at
five concentrations: 1 log above, 0.5 log above, at, 0.5 logs below, and 1 log below the
preliminary LoD level as predetermined during product development. Each bacterial
strain was tested in quintuplicate extractions and real-time PCR reactions using either
the SSC or STEC Mix (depending on the strain) for a total of five data points per
bacterial concentration. LoD was estimated as the lowest concentration where 5/5

replicates were detected. The same bacterial dilutions were also cultured on the
appropriate solid media for CFU/mL counting to enable calculation of LoDs in
CFU/mL of stool and CFU/reaction. The estimated LoD for each strain was then
confirmed by the generation of 20 independent samples/data points using the specific
spiked stool concentration utilized during the LoD Determination portion of the study.
For some of the strains, more than one concentration was included for the confirmation
portion of the study, typically the two lowest concentrations that yielded 100%
detection to ensure achievement of >95% detection for each strain. Each of the 20
replicates was subject to the entire test system from sample preparation and extraction
to PCR with either the SSC or STEC Mix (depending on the strain). All samples were
extracted using the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG Instrument. In the event that
the initial estimated LoD concentration was not confirmed (i.e., <19 replicates were
positive), the LoD confirmation was repeated using the next half-log higher
concentration. At least 95% (19/20) of the replicates were required to test positive to
confirm the LoD for each bacterial target.
The table below outlines the results of the LoD Determination portion of the study.

e. Analytical Reactivity:
The Analytical Reactivity study was performed to determine whether the ProGastro
SSCS Assay is able to detect a variety of strains (reactivity panel) that represent the
genetic diversity of each of the targeted organisms. This study expanded upon the
Analytical Sensitivity Study by determining whether different strains of the same
organism (Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter and Shiga Toxins 1 and 2 (stx1 and
stx2) producing strains of E. coli) can be detected at similar concentrations, near the
assay detection limit.
In addition to the eleven strains used for the LoD Study, the analytical reactivity of the
ProGastro SSCS Assay was evaluated with multiple strains of bacteria. The strains
were selected to include those isolated primarily from human infections (when
available) and various geographical locations in order to incorporate the genetic
variation that may be encountered by ProGastro SSCS users. A Limit of Detection
(LoD) was estimated for most of the strains during pre-verification studies (Note:
Salmonella bongori is not reactive and, thus, did not have a preliminary LoD). The
strains used in this study were tested at 2x the estimated LoD, or at the highest
concentration possible for the Salmonella bongori strain. One sample was generated
for each strain by spiking cultured and quantified bacteria into aliquots of a ProGastro
SSCS negative stool matrix pool. The Gastro RNA/DNA Internal Control (GIC) was
added to each sample just prior to extraction on the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG
and each resultant nucleic acid sample was tested in triplicate PCR reaction on the
Cepheid SmartCycler II (Dx Software Version 3.0).
Mean Cts and standard deviations for reactive strains were calculated and presented in
the following table:

* If more than one concentration was tested, the lowest concentration that tested positive for 3/3 reactions was
reported.
† Shigella dysenteriae strains typically contain a Shiga Toxin, therefore this strain tested positive with both the STEC
and SSC Mixes.
¥ Genomic DNA was used to test the reactivity of the SSC and STEC Mixes towards the enterohemorragic E. coli
(EHEC) strain associated with the outbreak in Europe during the Spring/Summer of 2011.
In silico analysis of a single sequenced strain available for Salmonella enterica subsp.
Enterica serotype Schwarzengrund demonstrated 100% homology of the ProGastro
SSCS Assay Salmonella oligonucleotide primers and probes with the Schwarzengrund
strain.
In conclusion, all of the strains used for this study with the exception of Salmonella
bongori, Salmonella enterica subsp. salamae, Salmonella enterica subsp. arizonae,
Salmonella enterica subsp. diarizonae, and Salmonella enterica subsp. houtenae

tested positive with the ProGastro SSCS Assay. All these exceptions are documented
as non-reactive strains in the ProGastro SSCS Assay Instructions for Use (Package
Insert) as limitations.
Shigella dysenteriae strains typically contain a Shiga Toxin, therefore this strain tested
positive with both the STEC and SSC Mixes. This is documented in the ProGastro
SSCS Assay Instructions for Use (Package Insert) as a limitation: “Shigella
dysenteriae strains typically contain a Shiga Toxin, but not always. A positive call of
STEC stx1/stx2 may be from either STEC or Shigella dysenteriae”.
f. Analytical Specificity/Cross-reactivity Evaluation:
To determine the analytical specificity of the ProGastro SSCS Assay, an analytical
cross-reactivity evaluation was carried out using cultured and titered strains of
common gastrointestinal pathogens that are genetically related, cause similar disease
states as the ProGastro SSCS Assay target organisms (Salmonella, Shigella,
Campylobacter and Shiga Toxin producing E. coli (STEC)), or are commonly found in
stool.
Analytical specificity is defined as an assay’s ability to exclusively identify the target
organisms while not cross-reacting with other organisms in a sample. The Analytical
Specificity of the ProGastro SSCS Assay was determined with a panel of 54
organisms. Cyclospora cayetanensis was subject to an in silico analysis only because it
was not available for “wet” testing.
All the ProGastro SSCS Assay target organisms (Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter
jejuni, Campylobacter coli, and STEC) in the specificity panel were serially diluted in
Stool Preservation and Transport Media (SPTM) and spiked into a ProGastro SSCS
negative stool matrix pool at high concentrations of 106-107 CFU/mL. This was done
to test the specificity of each mix for the target organisms and to also demonstrate that
the assay is functioning as expected. The remaining members of the Specificity Panel
were spiked into negative stool matrix pool at concentrations of 103.5 – 107.5
TCID /mL for viral targets and 106 – 8.8x108 CFU/mL for bacterial and fungal
50
targets. The Specificity Panel Organisms were not diluted prior to spiking into stool in
order to test them at the highest concentration possible. Norovirus was only available
in the form of a positive sample (raw stool) obtained from a Public Health Laboratory.
This sample was diluted in SPTM according to the manufacturer’s instructions and
then processed according to the ProGastro SSCS Instructions for use.
Analytical Specificity Study results are presented in the table below. In silico analysis
of the Cyclospora cayetanensis genome showed that each primer and probe included
with the mixes had no similarity to the organism.

genetically very similar to Shigella and was detected by the SSC Mix as positive for
Shigella as expected. This cross-reactivity is reported in the Package Insert as a
limitation. No cross-reactivity was observed between the two Mixes (SSC and STEC).
The ProGastro SSCS Assay demonstrates no cross reactivity with the organisms that
are commonly found in stool, genetically related or cause similar disease states as the
ProGastro SSCS Assay target organisms.
g. Assay cut-off:
To establish the cutoff threshold value of all targets of the ProGastro SSCS Assay on
the Cepheid SmartCycler II, negative stool samples and spiked stool samples
containing varying levels of Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter jejuni,
Campylobacter coli and Shiga Toxin producing E. coli (STEC, Shiga Toxin 1 and
Shiga Toxin 2 genes) were used. The ProGastro SSCS Assay is comprised of two
PCR mixes, one used to detect and differentiate Salmonella, Shigella and
Campylobacter (C. jejuni and C. coli only, not differentiated) (SSC Mix) while the
other detects and differentiates the Shiga Toxin 1 (stx1) and Shiga Toxin 2 (stx2) genes
in bacteria such as Shiga Toxin producing E. coli (STEC Mix). The accuracy of the
chosen Relative Fluorescent Units (RFU) threshold for each channel was confirmed
with retrospective clinical samples with the objective to obtain ≥ 90% positive and
negative agreement to reference methods.
The “cutoff value” represents the signal level, reported in RFU, at which a “positive”
reaction rises significantly above the background or baseline of a “negative” reaction.
If a sample exceeds the threshold in a detection channel during PCR, the sample is
considered positive for that channel. If the sample does not exceed the threshold for a
detection channel by the last PCR cycle, the sample is considered negative for that
channel.
Sources of variability incorporated into the Cutoff Determination and Confirmation
Study included: operators, unique samples, multiple bacterial and control dilutions,
extractions and reagent lots. Cutoff values were determined upon completion of the
Cutoff Determination Study which included testing of spiked stool samples and
controls. The cutoff values were then verified in the Cutoff Confirmation Study
against a set of retrospective clinical samples and controls.
Cutoff Determination Study:
The cutoff value of the ProGastro SSCS Assay was determined with a panel of
negative and spiked samples prepared from 82 individual negative stool clinical
samples that were tested by each of the two operators (n=164). Individual samples (n
= 12) were spiked with each ProGastro SSCS target bacteria (Salmonella, Shigella, C.
jejuni, C. coli, stx1 and stx 2) at three logs above the preliminary Limit of Detection
(LoD) concentration representing high positive stool samples. Individual samples (n =
36) were spiked with each of the six ProGastro SSCS targets at two times the
33

--- Page 34 ---
preliminary LoD concentration representing low positive stool samples. Thirty four
(34) samples were left un-spiked (negatives).
The high and low positive samples, as well as 30 of the negative samples were spiked
with the Gastro Internal Control (GIC). The GIC monitors for PCR inhibition as well
as any reagent, procedural or instrumentation failure. Four negative samples were not
spiked with the GIC.
Replicates of the SSCS Control and C. coli Control (SSC Mix only) were included
with each PCR run to test for global errors (absence of reagents, instrument failure,
etc.). The SSCS Control and C. coli Positive Controls did not require nucleic acid
isolation and were diluted in molecular grade water just prior to set up of the PCR
reactions. Six replicates of each positive control were included during set-up of the
PCR reactions (C. coli Control only used in conjunction with the SSC Mix). Six
Negative Controls (NC) consisting of Stool Preservation and Transport Media (SPTM,
Para-Pak C&S) spiked with GIC were also tested. The NC served to monitor for
contamination during the testing procedure.
Samples were extracted using the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG. The extracted
nucleic acids and the ProGastro SSCS and C. coli Controls, as well as GIC diluted in
water were run using two different lots of both the SSC and STEC Mixes contained in
the ProGastro SSCS Assay on the Cepheid SmartCycler II.
Initial cutoff values used for the Cutoff Determination Study were based on
preliminary testing during product development.
Data analysis of the Cutoff Determination Study included 1) calculation of lower limit
of the acceptable range for cutoff threshold (RFU) based on negative samples; and 2)
calculation of upper limit of the acceptable range for cutoff threshold (RFU) based on
spiked positive samples. For a given detection, a range of possible cutoffs was
generated by determining lower and upper boundaries of the threshold, based on final
RFUs that would minimize false positives and false negatives. A Receiver Operator
Characteristics (ROC) analysis was performed for all of the channels utilized by the
ProGastro SSCS Assay’s SSC and STEC Mixes. In addition, population distribution
and statistics were analyzed to aid in selecting a cutoff threshold. Histograms of the
final RFU values were used to assess the nature of the distributions and the percentile
rankings.
Acceptable ranges for the potential cutoff were generated in the following manners:
• The distributions of the negatives and positives were first assessed for normality.
If the population distributions were normal, the averages and standard deviations
of the final RFUs were calculated for all detections. For the negatives, the lower
limit of the acceptable range for cutoff threshold is defined as the average final
RFU plus three standard deviations, that is, the point at which 99.7% of true
negatives are expected to fall below assuming normality. Similarly, for the
34

--- Page 35 ---
positives, the upper limit of the acceptable range for cutoff threshold is defined as
the average final RFU minus three standard deviations. This is the point at which
at least 99.7% of true positives are expected to be greater than, assuming
normality.
• Population statistics were also analyzed for each detection channel. The lower
limit of the cutoff threshold range is defined minimally as the 99.5% percentile
from the quantile analysis for negative samples. This is the RFU value at which at
least 99.5% of true negatives are expected to be lower than. For the positives, the
upper limit of the cutoff threshold range is defined maximally as the 0.5%
percentile. This is the RFU value at which at least 99.5% of true positives are
expected to be greater than.
• A ROC curve analysis was generated and assessed for all channels used with the
ProGastro SSCS Assay’s SSC and STEC Mixes. ROC curves for the SSC Mix
(Campylobacter (FAM), Salmonella (TET), Shigella (TxRed), and GIC (CY5))
and the STEC Mix (stx2 (FAM), stx1 (TET), and GIC (CY5)) cutoffs were
generated. The threshold range that yielded the maximum accuracy was identified.
• The cutoff threshold ranges determined by statistical analysis were used in
conjunction with all data to select the cutoff settings. The following tables present
the cutoff ranges and settings chosen from the Cutoff Determination Study for the
SSC and STEC Mixes.

Cutoff Confirmation Study:
The Cutoff Confirmation Study goals were to achieve ≥90 Percent Positive and ≥90
Percent Negative Agreement of the ProGastro SSCS Assay using the preliminary
cutoff values chosen after the Cutoff Determination Study as compared to the
reference method results using retrospective positive and negative clinical stool
samples.
Data analysis of the Cutoff Confirmation Study included 1) calculation of percent
positive agreement for all retrospective ProGastro SSCS Assay positive clinical
samples; and 2) calculation of percent negative agreement for all retrospective
ProGastro SSCS Assay negative clinical samples.
The results of the Cutoff Confirmation Study are presented in the table below:

Additional Cutoff Validation Studies:
The final cutoff values confirmed in the Cutoff Confirmation Study were further
validated during the clinical studies and all subsequent analytical studies.
h. Internal Control Interference:
Competitive inhibition of the ProGastro SSCS Assay due to the presence of the Gastro
RNA/DNA Internal Control (GIC) was assessed in an analytical study. Simulated
samples were tested with and without the GIC to determine if the presence of the GIC
affected the detection of the Assay target organisms. For this study, one cultured and
titered strain each of Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli,
and Shiga Toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC, stx1+/stx2+) were diluted and
individually spiked into a negative stool pool at 2x and at 1 log below each strain’s
Limit of Detection (LoD) as estimated in the Analytical Reactivity Study. Shigella was
also generated and tested at 2 logs below LoD. All dilution series were extracted in
triplicate on the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG.
The strains used for the GIC Interference Study are listed below:
• Salmonella Enteritidis ATCC 6961 (stock concentration 1.06x109 CFU/mL)
• Shigella flexneri ATCC 12022 (stock concentration 9.0x109 CFU/mL)
• Campylobacter jejuni ATCC 29428 (stock concentration 1.10x108 CFU/mL)
• Campylobacter coli ATCC BAA-371 (stock concentration 7.20x108 CFU/mL)
• STEC (stx1+/stx2+) STEC Center Accession# TW07926 (stock concentration
1.75x109 CFU/mL)
The extracted nucleic acids were tested by PCR in triplicate using the ProGastro SSCS
Assay reagents on the Cepheid SmartCyler II. This resulted in a total of nine data
points for each strain at each concentration spiked with the GIC and nine data points
for each strain at each concentration without the GIC.
For the GIC to be considered “non-interfering”, the following criteria were required to
be met:
• The LoD of samples without GIC must be within one log of the samples with GIC.
• The mean Cts for concentrations with and without IC must differ by less than 3.3
Cts for all concentrations tested.
All data were analyzed and Mean Cts, Standard Deviation, % Coefficient of Variance,
and the number of positive results were calculated for each strain at each
concentration. The Mean Ct difference between the samples with and without GIC at
each concentration was also calculated (See the table below).

No competitive inhibition near the assay LoD was observed for detection of
Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli, and STEC
(stx1+/stx2+) in the presence GIC using the ProGastro SSCS Assay. The assay
demonstrated equivalent detection of LoD concentrations for the different target
strains with Mean Ct differences for each strain and concentration (with and without
the GIC) ranging from -1.0 to 0.0.
i. Interfering Substances:
An analytical study was carried out to evaluate and assess the potential inhibitory
effects of exogenous and endogenous substances that may be present in stool samples
on the ProGastro SSCS Assay.
This study examined whether a panel of potential inhibitory endogenous and
exogenous substances (The Interfering Substances Panel) affects the performance of
the ProGastro SSCS Assay. The panel consisted of endogenous substances (blood,
mucus, and fecal fats), over the counter and prescription medicines (antacids,
laxatives, anti-diarrheal medications, antibiotics, etc.), and miscellaneous substances
(such as spermicidal lubricant and moist towelette residue) that could potentially be
found in stool samples. Twenty (20) aliquots of negative stool matrix were spiked with
a single cultured and titered strain of Campylobacter coli (CC), 20 aliquots were
spiked with a single strain of STEC (stx1+/stx2+), 20 aliquots were dual-spiked with a
single cultured and titered strain of Salmonella (Sal) and a single strain of
Campylobacter jejuni (CJ), and 20 aliquots were spiked with a single strain Shigella
(Shi) only. All organisms were tested at a final concentration of 2x Limit of Detection
(LoD). Each interfering substance was then spiked into a single aliquot each of CC
spiked stool, STEC spiked stool, Sal/CJ spiked stool, and Shi spiked stool. Interfering

each spiked sample type was not spiked with any interference substance for
comparison purposes (control).

The ProGastro SSCS Assay did not appear to be affected by the presence of any
endogenous or exogenous potential PCR inhibitors tested in this study.
j. Microbial Interference:
An analytical study was conducted to evaluate the ProGastro SSCS Assay for potential
interference by microorganisms that are not detected by the assay using clinically
relevant concentrations of potentially interfering microorganisms (same as those used
in the Analytical Specificity Study).
Potentially interfering microorganisms (37 bacteria, six viruses, four parasites, and one
yeast) were added to contrived positive sample groups (described below) at
concentrations of 106 – 108 CFU/mL (bacteria and fungi) or at a minimum of 2.85 x
103 TCID /mL (viruses). The contrived positive samples were prepared from a pool
50
of stool matrix that was confirmed negative by the ProGastro SSCS Assay.
The ProGastro SSCS target organisms were combined to form two contrived positive
sample groups and tested at 2x Limit of Detection (LoD). One positive sample duo
group contained Salmonella and Campylobacter jejuni, which have been found in co-
infections the most frequently. Shigella, Campylobacter coli, and STEC (stx1 and stx2
positive) made up the second positive sample trio group. Each positive duo/trio
sample group was aliquoted and spiked with a potential microbial interfering organism
at high concentrations. Also, each duo/trio positive sample group was extracted
without a microbial interferent to serve as a reference point. Final concentrations of
each sample component can be found in the table below. Each sample was tested in
replicates of three.

* Sample contains a high concentration of EIEC; therefore the Ct value is very low
Enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC) is genetically very similar to Shigella and was
detected by the SSC Mix as positive for Shigella as expected. This cross-reactivity is
reported in the Package Insert as a limitation.

In conclusion, the presence of high clinically relevant concentrations of potentially
interfering microorganisms did not appear to affect the performance of the ProGastro
SSCS Assay detecting low concentrations (close to the LoD concentrations) of assay
target organisms.
k. Competitive Interference
To evaluate the effects of Competitive Interference on the ProGastro SSCS Assay’s
SSC Mix and STEC Mix when various combinations of the Assay’s target organisms
were present in a single sample, an analytical study was carried out.
Competitive Interference may occur when the detection of one target in a multiplex
PCR Mix is outcompeted by another target(s) in that same multiplex PCR Mix for
essential reaction components (dNTPs, Mg2+ etc.). Competitive Interference was
assessed by generating contrived samples containing a single target analyte
(organism) present at a concentration near the Limit of Detection (LoD) with one
or more different target analytes at a higher concentration in the same sample.
This study utilized one cultured and titered strain each of Salmonella, Shigella,
Campylobacter jejuni, and Campylobacter coli for use with the SSC Mix. For the
STEC Mix testing, two Shiga Toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strains
(stx1+/stx2- and stx1-/stx2+) were used. The bacterial strains were diluted in Stool
Preservation and Transport Media (SPTM, ParaPak C&S) and spiked into aliquots
of a ProGastro SSCS negative stool matrix pool with one or two of the targets at 3
logs above their particular LoD and a second or third target analyzed close to the
LoD depending on the particular sample. (See tables below).

The Competitive Interference Panel samples and the required Negative Controls
were extracted on the bioMériuex NucliSENS easyMAG and samples tested in
triplicate (Positive and Negative Controls in a single replicate per PCR Run) on a
Cepheid Smartcycler II using one lot of ProGastro SSCS reagents.
The results were analyzed and any organism(s) that prevented the detection of any of
the target organisms were reported as a competitive interferent of the ProGastro SSCS
Assay.
The Competitive Interference summary data stratified by the SSC Mix and the STEC
Mix is presented in the two tables below. The tables present a summary of the data
generated in the study, highlighting (in yellow) the organism combinations that
exhibited competitive interference.

Competitive Interference was observed for several samples using the ProGastro SSCS
Assay’s SSC Mix. In samples where Campylobacter jejuni is present in high
concentrations and Shigella is present in low concentrations (near the assay limit of
detection), competitive interference may occur hindering the detection of Shigella by
the ProGastro SSCS Assay SSC Mix. In samples where Salmonella is present in high
concentrations and C. jejuni or C. coli are present in low concentrations (near the assay
limit of detection), competitive interference may occur hindering detection of these
Campylobacter strains by the ProGastro SSCS Assay SSC Mix. These limitations are
added to the ProGastro SSCS Assay Instructions for Use.
Competitive Interference for STEC strains was not observed using the ProGastro
SSCS Assay’s STEC Mix.
l. Carry-Over Contamination:
A Carry-Over Contamination Study was conducted to demonstrate the degree of
Carry-Over/Cross-Contamination that may occur when High Positive (HP) samples
were processed alongside True Negative (TN) samples during nucleic acid extraction
on the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG and during subsequent PCR setup of the
ProGastro SSCS Assay on the Cepheid SmartCycler II.
This study assessed the level of carry-over contamination with the ProGastro SSCS
Assay by testing simulated dual positive Shigella (Shigella flexneri ATCC12022) and
Shiga Toxin producing E. Coli (STEC) (E. coli Strain 3215-99 O111:H8, stx1+/stx2+)
high positive stool samples run in series with negative stool samples over the course of
five runs (one run/day). This study used bacterial targets that are typically found at the
highest level in clinical samples, which based on development and analytical studies
were Shigella and STEC. The High Positive (HP) samples consisted of negative stool
matrix spiked with a concentration of 5 logs above the Limit of Detection (LoD) for
Shigella and 4 logs above the LoD for STEC. These concentrations were used to
represent the earlier Ct range for these organisms as observed in the Cutoff
Determination and Confirmation Study. True Negative (TN) samples consisted of
negative stool matrix. The samples were processed and extracted in a HP/TN
alternating fashion (i.e. checkerboard pattern) on the extraction instrument and
likewise processed and run using both the SSC and STEC Mixes on the Cepheid
SmartCycler II instrument in an alternating fashion.
Eleven (11) HP, 11 TN samples, and a Negative Control were extracted per run on the
easyMAG for a total of 55 HP samples and 55 TN samples over five runs. The table
below presents the order of samples run on the easyMAG. Sample cartridges were
placed in a linear array on the easyMAG instrument such that Cartridge A / Vessel 8
(TN 4) was adjacent to Cartridge B / Vessel 1 (HP 5) and Cartridge B / Vessel 8 (TN
8) was adjacent to Cartridge C / Vessel 1 (HP 9), maintaining the alternating pattern.

nucleic acid in duplicate were negative for Campylobacter
**Sample TN 40 false positive for Salmonella (SSC Mix), results from repeat testing from
nucleic acid in duplicate were negative for Salmonella
The results of this study demonstrate no evidence of Carry-Over Contamination over a
five day course of processing High Positive Shigella and STEC samples alongside
True Negative samples using the ProGastro SSCS Assay. 100% of the True Negative
samples were negative for Shigella, stx1 and stx2.
The false positive Campylobacter and Salmonella results in the samples tested
indicates that environmental contamination can occur during PCR set up, most likely
from the SSCS Positive Control, as these organisms were not used for this study. The
following statement is included in the “Limitations” section of the product package
insert: “There is a risk of false positive values resulting from cross-contamination by

m. Stool Preservation Transport Medium (SPTM) Comparison Study:
An analytical study was carried out to demonstrate equivalent performance of the two
stool preservation media, Meridian ParaPak C&S (C&S) and the Remel Cary Blair
(CB) Transport Medium, used for collection and transport of stool samples for use
with the ProGastro SSCS Assay.
Meridian Para-Pak (C&S) and Remel Cary Blair Transport Medium with Indicator
Transport Media (CB) are the two most utilized Stool Preservation and Transport
Media (SPTM) in clinical laboratory settings. The intended use of C&S and CB is for
the routine collection, transportation, preservation, and culture of clinical stool
specimens for bacterial enteric pathogens. The SPTMs have essentially the same
ingredients and it was anticipated that there would be minimal differences in assay
performance using either of the materials (see the table below).

For the CB to be considered equivalent to C&S:
• All three replicates for at least one concentration must test positive and within
one log of the lowest concentration in which all 3 replicates of C&S are positive.
• The average Ct values at all concentrations in which 3 of 3 replicates are positive
shall not differ by more than 3.3 Cts from the average Ct of that concentration
diluted in C&S. If the sample differs by more than 3.3 Cts the media will not be
considered equivalent.
The Mean Ct difference between the two media for the average of each strain at each

medium. In addition, none of the organisms revealed a difference in average Ct value
of more than 3.3 between the different media at any concentration tested. Therefore,
the performance is considered equivalent. Stool samples may be collected in CB
and/or C&S for use with the ProGastro SSCS Assay.
n. Comparator Assays Analytical Validation Studies
The ProGastro SSCS Assay is a Real Time PCR Assay comprised of two Mixes, one
used to detect and differentiate Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter (C. jejuni
and C. coli only, not differentiated, SSC Mix) while the other Mix detects and
differentiates the Shiga Toxin 1 (stx1) and Shiga Toxin 2 (stx2) genes in bacteria such
as Shiga Toxin producing E. coli (STEC Mix). The ProGastro SSCS Assay Clinical
Study established performance by comparing ProGastro SSCS results to broth
enrichment/EIA for Shiga Toxin producing bacteria. The broth enrichment/EIA Kit
(Meridian Biosciences Premier EHEC EIA Kit) does not differentiate between stx1
and stx2 positive STEC samples and as a result, a sequence reference method (SRM)
for the detection and differentiation of stx1 and stx2 was developed. Any STEC
positive sample via one or both testing methods (EIA or ProGastro SSCS STEC Mix)
was further tested for stx1 and stx2 using these sequencing assays. The SRM is
comprised of two different PCR mixes, one targeting a different area of the stx1 gene
than the ProGastro SSCS Assay’s STEC Mix and the second targeting a different area
of the stx2 gene than the STEC Mix. Samples yielding a PCR product from one or
both of the SRM PCR Mixes were sent to an external facility for bi-directional
sequencing.
Analytical Sensitivity, Reactivity, and Specificity studies were conducted to verify the
analytical performance of these SRM stx1 and stx2 sequencing assays.
Limit of Detection
The limit of detection (LoD) of the STEC SRM was determined using previously
titered (CFU/ml) cultures of STEC, including a single strain of STEC O157:H7
(stx1+/stx2-) for the stx1 SRM Mix and STEC Non-O157 (stx1-/stx2+) for the stx2
SRM Mix. Two strains of previously cultured and titered bacteria were serially
diluted, spiked into a ProGastro SSCS Assay negative stool matrix pool, and tested at
three concentrations: 1 log above, at, and 1 log below the tentative LoD. Each
dilution series was extracted on the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG in a single
replicate and tested in five replicate PCR reactions using the required STEC SRM Mix
depending on the strain (stx1+ strain with the stx1 Mix and stx2+ strain with the stx2
Mix). PCR products generated with the SRM Mixes were analyzed using the Qiagen
QIAxcel capillary electrophoresis instrument. LoD was determined to be the lowest
concentration of bacteria detected >95% of the time (5/5 replicates). The LoD for each
strain was confirmed by the generation of 20 independent extraction data points using
the specific spiked stool concentration utilized during the LoD Determination portion
of this study. The required spiked sample was used to perform 20 independent
extractions (per strain) on the easyMAG with each purified nucleic acid sample run in

a single replicate using a single lot of the required STEC SRM Mix depending on the
strain. Subsequent to capillary electrophoresis during the LoD Confirmation portion
of the study, one representative sample containing the least concentrated product for
each strain was confirmed for the correct gene target by bi-directional genetic
sequencing and NCBI BLAST Analysis (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/BLAST.cgi).
At least 95% of the 20 replicates were required to test positive to confirm the LoD for
each bacterial strain.
The results of the LoD estimation portion of the study are presented in the following
table. Concentrations that are bolded were used for the subsequent Confirmation
portion of the study.

Analytical Specificity
The STEC SRM Assay did not react with any of the non-target organisms included in
this study, other than Escherichia hermannii. This strain produced a band with
interpretable sequencing results with the stx2 Mix which was identified as E. coli by
BLAST analysis, but further analysis revealed no positive hits for stx2, so it is not in
fact reactive with the STEC SRM assay. The stx1 target strain was detected using the
stx1 Mix, but negative with the stx2 Mix. The stx2 target strain was detected using the
stx2 Mix, but negative with the stx1 Mix. The STEC SRM Assay demonstrates no
cross reactivity with the organisms that are commonly found in stool, genetically
related or cause similar disease states as the ProGastro SSCS Assay target organisms.
In silico analysis of the Cyclospora cayetanensis genome showed that each primer and
probe included with the SRM Mixes had no similarity to the organism.
In conclusion, the STEC SRM demonstrated similar analytical sensitivity (limit of
detection, LoD) and reactivity as compared to the ProGastro SSCS Assay STEC Mix.
The STEC SRM was also reactive to the same set of STEC used in the Analytical
Specificity Study for the ProGastro SSCS Assay STEC Mix. The STEC SRM was not
cross-reactive with any common stool organisms or organisms that cause similar
disease states as the ProGastro SSCS Assay target organisms. Based on these

Prospective Clinical Study
The prospective clinical performance study was conducted at four U.S. clinical
laboratory sites using prospectively collected samples. All four sites enrolled and
tested prospective samples that were collected from July 2011 through November
2011. One of the four sites also enrolled and tested approximately 250 prospective
samples collected in May 2012 – July 2012. All specimens used in the study meeting
the inclusion criteria represented excess remnants of stool specimens that were
prospectively collected from symptomatic individuals suspected of gastrointestinal
infection, and were submitted for routine care or analysis by each site, and that
otherwise would have been discarded.
Demographic details for the patient population included in the prospective study are
summarized in the following table.

the ProGastro SSCS Assay using both the SSC and STEC Mixes on the Cepheid
SmartCycler II.
Performance of the ProGastro SSCS Assay was assessed and compared to the
reference method of culture (Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Shigella) or broth
enrichment followed by FDA cleared EIA test (Shiga Toxin producing E. coli, STEC).
Samples positive for STEC by broth/EIA and/or the ProGastro SSCS Assay underwent
PCR/bi-directional sequencing to confirm the presence of the stx1 and/or stx2 genes.
Two PCR/sequencing assays were used that each targeted different regions of the stx1
or stx2 gene than the ProGastro SSCS Assay. “True” STEC positives were considered
as any sample that tested positive for STEC by the broth/EIA method, and “True”
STEC negatives were considered as any sample that tested negative for STEC by the
broth/EIA method. “True” stx1 or “true” stx2 positives were considered as any sample
that tested positive for STEC by the broth/EIA method and by PCR/sequencing. Bi-
directional sequencing data was required to meet pre-defined quality acceptance
criteria for both the forward and the reverse sequences that matched stx1 or stx2
sequences deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
GenBank database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), respectively, with acceptable E-values.
The E-Value from NCBI BLAST Alignment indicates the statistical significance of a
given pair-wise alignment and reflects the size of the database and the scoring system
used. The lower the E-Value, the more significant the hit is. A sequence alignment
that has an E-Value of 1e-3 means that this similarity has a 1 in 1000 chance of
occurring by chance alone.
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=handbook.section.614).
Discrepant results between the ProGastro SSCS Assay and the reference methods were
also evaluated using analytically validated PCR/sequencing assays and results are
footnoted in the performance tables below.
A total of 1214 patients were initially enrolled in the prospective clinical trial. Sixty-
one patient/samples were excluded from the performance calculations due to
deviations from the clinical study protocol. Fourteen specimens were excluded for the
SSC Mix and 14 were excluded for the STEC Mix from the prospective clinical study
data analysis because they remained “Unresolved” after repeat testing with the
respective ProGastro SSCS Assay Mix. Unresolved results occur when the sample is
negative for all target detections and the Internal Control, indicating potentially PCR-
inhibited samples. This resulted in a total of 1139 eligible prospective specimens to be
included in the prospective clinical study data analysis.
The prospective study performance data (all sites combined) are presented in the
following tables stratified by analyte:

Retrospective Clinical Study
In addition to the prospective clinical study, two of the four clinical sites also
performed testing using retrospective samples that were collected from 2007 - 2011. A
total of 105 stool samples were included in the retrospective study.
These samples had been previously determined to be positive or negative by culture
and/or Broth Enrichment/EIA. The ProGastro SSCS Assay was compared to the same
reference method that was employed for the prospective study to determine positive
and negative percent agreement.
Demographic details for this patient population are summarized in the table below:

ProGastro SSCS Assay Failure Rate Due to Controls (Prospective and
Retrospective Studies Combined)
There were a total of four ProGastro SSCS runs out of 136 (75 SSC and 61 STEC)
runs that were invalid, three from the prospective study and one from the retrospective
study. Two of the run failures were due to Negative Control contamination. Another
invalid run was due to the PC1 failure for STEC and it is hypothesized that the SSCS
PC1 and the C. coli PC2 were mistakenly switched in the SmartCyler II. The final

invalid run was due to 3084/3089 error with an SSC run, where the SmartCycler II run
is started before the I-CORE Lid has been closed. For each initially invalid run, all
samples, the Negative Control, and the PMC (Extraction Control) were re-run using
the ProGastro SSCS Assay starting from the purified nucleic acid and repeat test
results were valid and used in analysis.
“Unresolved” Samples (Prospective and Retrospective Studies Combined)
An “Unresolved” result is generated when the Gastro Internal Control (GIC) fails to be
detected in a clinical specimen. A failure of the GIC to be detected can occur if
inhibitors are present in a sample or due to technical error (e.g., GIC not added prior to
nucleic acid extraction). According to the Assay Instructions for Use and the
ProGastro SSCS Clinical Study Protocol all “Unresolved” samples were to be retested
starting from the purified nucleic acids. (Note: Detection of the GIC in the Cy5
detection channel is not required for reporting negative results for a sample when at
least one analyte is detected in the sample in the proper detection channel, since high
bacterial load can lead to reduced or absent Internal Control signal.) Samples with a
repeat “Unresolved” result were excluded from the final data analysis. Valid repeat
negative and positive results were included in the final analysis of the Clinical Study.
The following table summarizes the ProGastro SSCS Assay “Unresolved” samples
from the prospective and the retrospective study.
