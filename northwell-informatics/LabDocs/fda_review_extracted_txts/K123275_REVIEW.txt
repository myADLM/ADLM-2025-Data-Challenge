L. Test Principle:
The allergen of interest, covalently coupled to ImmunoCAP, reacts with the specific IgE in
the patient sample. After washing away non-specific IgE, enzyme-labeled antibodies against
IgE are added to form a complex. After incubation, unbound enzyme-anti-IgE is washed
away and the bound complex is then incubated with a developing agent. After stopping the
reaction, the fluorescence of the eluate is measured. The higher the response value, the more
specific IgE is present in the specimen. To evaluate the test results, the responses for the
patient samples are transformed to concentrations with the use of a calibration curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
i) Within-Lot imprecision:
Imprecision of the individual allergen components was evaluated by using two
positive plasma samples, including a low range sample (0.35 ± 25%) and a high
range sample (≥0.7 kU /L). Each sample was tested in 4 replicates in 1 assay run
A
per day for a total of 20 operating days (a total of 80 replicates per sample). The
assay was performed according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE Directions for
Use using Phadia 250. Between-day and within-run coefficients of variance
(%CV) were calculated for each component and each sample separately.

ii) Lot-to-lot imprecision:
For each allergen, three different ImmunoCAP Allergen Component lots were
tested using two positive plasma samples (0.35 ± 25% and ≥0.7 kU /L) and one
A
negative plasma sample (< 0.1 kU /L). For each lot the samples were tested in 12
A
replicates in one assay run. Each lot represented a different preparation of the
allergen from routine production. The assay was performed according to the
ImmunoCAP Specific IgE, Directions for Use using Phadia 250. Mean
concentration values, %CV and concentration quotients between lots were
calculated for the positive samples.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the 2 individual allergens was assessed following the CLSI I/LA20-
A2 guidelines. For each allergen component, three positive plasma samples were
each diluted in negative plasma generating at least five 2-fold consecutive dilutions.
Undiluted and diluted samples were tested in four replicates in one assay run. The
assay was performed according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE, Directions for Use
using instrument Phadia 250. For each product one lot of ImmunoCAP Allergen
Component was used. ImmunoCAP Specific Total IgE working range is LoD to100
kU /L.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i) Traceability:
The IgE calibrators are traceable (via an unbroken chain of calibrations) to the
2nd International Reference Preparation (IRP) 75/502 of Human Serum
Immunoglobulin E from World Health Organization (WHO).
ii) Kit Stability:
Real-time and Accelerated stability: The stability studies were performed in
accordance with EN 13640 (Stability Testing of In Vitro Diagnostic Reagents) to
demonstrate 24 month unopened shelf-life stability (at recommended storage
temperature of 2-8°C) of the ImmunoCAP Allergen i3 and i4 by an on-going real
time stability study and accelerated stability study. For real time stability study,
three lots of each ImmunoCAP Allergen Component i3 and i4 were stored at
recommended storage temperature, 2-8°C. Two positive plasma samples (2.8 and
7.8 kU /L) and one negative plasma sample (<0.1 kU /L) were tested at different
A A
occasions according to the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE, Directions for Use, using
Phadia 250. The study is ongoing. For accelerated study, three lots of
ImmunoCAP Allergen Components i3 and i4 were stored at 30°C for 8 weeks.
The same lot stored at 2-8°C was used as reference. They were tested after 4 and
8 weeks when stored in 30°C, using two positive plasma samples and one
negative plasma sample. The results support the manufacture’s claim of 24
months.
The stability of the calibration curve, real time, and on-board stability of
ImmunoCAP Specific IgE calibrator are detailed in k100999.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined for each
allergen component on the Phadia 250 in alignment with CLSI EP17-A. The LoB
was based on single determinations of 100 negative samples (blank samples) and was
estimated as the 95% percentile of the distribution. LoD was calculated according to
the equation: LoD = LoB + cß • SD where SD, the standard deviation, was based on
20 determinations of 3 low positive samples, in total 60 determinations. LoQ for
allergen specific IgE antibodies was determined to be 0.1 1 kUA/L according to CLSI
EP 17-A (see k051218). The results are shown in the table below.
Allergen component LoB LoD
i3 0.028 0.035
i4 0.031 0.038
e. Analytical specificity:

i4			0.031			0.038		

--- Page 7 ---
i) Inhibition studies:
Immunological specificity of the allergen components was verified through
competitive inhibition. The studies were planned in accordance with CLSI
I/LA20-A2. The specific IgE concentration for the positive samples is shown in
the table below.
Allergen component kU /L
A
i3 9.5
i4 8.0
The allergen solution was serially diluted with buffer to show an overall dose
dependent inhibition. Equal volumes of a positive sample and varying dilutions
of allergen solution (inhibitor) were premixed. The mixture was incubated in a
sample tube at room temperature for 1 hour before being analyzed with the
corresponding ImmunoCAP Allergen Component on ImmunoCAP instrument
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The testing was performed in
duplicates in one assay run. Mean values were calculated.
The inhibition test was evaluated with inhibition values in %, calculated
according to the formula below:
æ ær-böö
ç ç1-ç ÷÷ ÷´100=i%
è èt-bøø
r = response [RU]
b = background response (100% inhibition) [RU]
t = total response (0% inhibition) [RU]
i = inhibition
Any negative inhibition %-values are shown as 0% inhibition.
The results of the inhibition with the allergen solution and the unrelated inhibitors
indicate that the 2 modified allergens contain the immunologically relevant
allergen as shown below:
ImmunoCAP Allergen i3, Common wasp venom (Yellow jacket)
The Allergen i3, Common wasp venom (Yellow jacket) Inhibition study showed
that >50% inhibition was achieved with related inhibitor (i3 solution allergen) at a
final inhibitor concentration of 10 µg/mL. The inhibition studies using six
unrelated inhibitors, three from unrelated groups (f428 Hazel nut, g6 Timothy
grass, and t3 Birch tree) and three from the related/same group (i206 Cockroach,
i1 Honey bee venom and i205 Bumble bee venom) did not show any significant
inhibition at 0.5 mg/mL. The inhibition studies indicate that the ImmunoCAP
Allergen i3, Common wasp venom (Yellow jacket) solid phase contains the
immunologically relevant allergen.

ImmunoCAP Allergen i4 Paper wasp venom
The Allergen i4 Paper wasp venom Inhibition study showed that >50% inhibition
was achieved with related inhibitor (i4 solution allergen) at a final inhibitor
concentration of 0.075 mg/mL. The inhibition studies using six unrelated
inhibitors, three from unrelated groups (f428 Hazel nut, g6 Timothy grass, and t3
Birch tree) and three from the related/same group (i206 Cockroach, i1 Honey bee
venom and i205 Bumble bee venom) did not show any significant inhibition at a
final inhibitor concentration of 0.2 mg/mL. The inhibition studies indicate that
the ImmunoCAP Allergen i4, Paper wasp venom solid phase contains the
immunologically relevant allergen.
ii) Interference:
a) Endogenous Substance Interference:
In order to show that icteric, hemolytic or lipemic samples do not adversely
affect the results in ImmunoCAP Specific IgE assay using representative
allergens, Bilirubin C [final concentration (fc) 20 mg/dL], Bilirubin F (fc 19
mg/dL), Hemoglobin (fc 489 mg/dL) and Chyle (fc 1,440 Formazine
Turbidity Units) were spiked into 2 samples per allergen. The allergens tested
were e228 rFel d 4 Cat, f351 rPen a 1 Tropomyosin Shrimp, f354 rBer e 1
Brazil nut, f420 rPru p 3 LTP Peach and w231 nArt v 1 Mugwort. The design
of the studies was in general alignment with CLSI EP7-A2 Guideline. The
results demonstrate that icteric, hemolytic or lipemic samples do not adversely
affects the results in ImmunoCAP Specific IgE.
b) Exogenous Substance Interference:
Two literature references were provided supporting that commonly prescribed
"allergy medications" do not interfere with ImmunoCAP Specific IgE. The
references included (i) Robert G. Hamilton, Accuracy of US Food and Drug
Administration-cleared IgE antibody assays in the presence of anti-IgE
(omalizumab), J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2006; 759-766, and (ii) Linda Cox et
al., Pearls and pitfalls of allergy diagnostic testing: report from the American
College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology/American Academy of Allergy,
Asthma and Immunology Specific IgE Test Task Force, Annals of Allergy,
Asthma & Immunology, 2008; 101:580-592.
f. Assay cut-off:
All results >0.1 kUA/L are interpreted as being analytically positive.

b. Matrix comparison:
The "Proof of Principle" study that different matrix samples (heparin plasma, EDTA
plasma and serum) are interchangeable for ImmunoCAP Allergen Components was
provided in k101251. Serum, sodium heparin plasma, and EDTA plasma samples
were collected from four patients with clinical history of known specific allergies and
four non-atopic patients. The samples contained specific IgE antibodies for one or
more of the allergen components tested. ·All sample matrices (heparin plasma, EDTA
plasma and serum) from each patient were tested with ImmunoCAP Allergen
Components in 2 replicates in one assay run. Mean concentration values for each
