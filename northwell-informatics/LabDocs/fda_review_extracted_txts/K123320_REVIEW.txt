L. Test Principle:
The Dimension® Ammonia assay (AMM) is an enzymatic method that uses glutamate
dehydrogenase (GLDH) and a stabilized NADPH analog. Ammonia reacts with α-
ketoglutarate and reduced cofactor to form L-glutamate and the cofactor. The reaction is
catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase. The decrease in absorbance due to the oxidation of
the reduced cofactor is monitored at 340/700 nm and is proportional to the ammonia
concentration.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP5-A2. The testing was
performed over 20 days, with two separate runs per day and two results per run,
resulting in a total n of 80. Three levels of commercial control materials were
evaluated. The results are summarized in the following table:
Repeatability Within Lab
Mean
Material Standard Standard
(µg/dL) % CV % CV
Deviation Deviation
Level 1 40 2.1 5.2 3.7 9.3
Level 2 187 2.6 1.4 3.7 2.0
Level 3 565 3.3 0.6 7.3 1.3
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP-6A on the Dimension RxL
Max analyzer.
Seventeen levels were prepared using Dimension Vista CHEM 3 CAL B (887
µg/dL) diluted by sequential mixing with CHEM 3 CAL A (0 µg/dL). The mean of 3
replicates was used to evaluate linearity at each level. The range of samples tested
was 0 – 1380 µg/dL.
Linear regression of the data produced the following:
y = 1.00x + 0.95
r2 = 1.00
Based on the results of this testing and the Limit of Quantitation testing, the
analytical measurement range was determined to be 17 – 1277 µg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The calibrators for this assay were cleared under k123321. Please refer to that
submission for more information.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Detection (LoD) for AMM is 11 μg/dL, determined consistent with
CLSI guideline EP17-A 11 and with proportions of false positives (α) less than 5%

and false negatives (β) less than 5%; based on 96 determinations, with 4 blank and 4
low level samples. The Limit of Blank (LoB) is 5 μg/dL.
LoD is the lowest concentration of analyte that can be detected reliably. LoB is the
highest concentration that is likely to be observed for a blank sample.
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for AMM is 17 μg/dL determined consistent with
CLSI Guideline EP17-A and an inter-assay imprecision of <20 % Coefficient of
Variation (CV).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference was evaluated according to CLSI EP7-A2. Bias is the difference in the
results between the control sample (without the interferent) and the test sample
(contains the interferent) expressed in percent. Bias exceeding 10% is considered
interference. The concentrations in the table below represent the highest
concentration of the potential interferent tested that did not cause bias greater than
+/- 10% at ammonia concentrations of 85 and 426 ug/dL.
