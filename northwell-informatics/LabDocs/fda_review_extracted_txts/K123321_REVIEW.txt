I. Device Description:
The Dimension® Chemistry III Calibrator (CHEM III CAL) is a multi-analyte,
aqueous product containing ammonium bicarbonate, ethyl alcohol and sodium
carbonate. It is packaged as a kit of six vials with two vials each of Levels 1, 2 and 3,
containing 2.5 mL per vial. Level 1 is made by adding preservatives to purified water
and is also the base for Levels 2 and 3. Levels 2 and 3 are prepared by adding the
targeted quantities of ammonia, carbon dioxide, and ethyl alcohol to levels 2 and 3.
J. Substantial Equivalence Information:

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The traceability of the three analytes in the Dimension Chemistry III
Calibrator (CHEM III CAL) is as follows:
Ammonia – traceable to ACS Grade Ammonium Sulfate
Carbon Dioxide (CO ) – traceable to NIST SRM 351
2
Ethyl Alcohol – traceable to USP Grade Ethyl Alcohol
Value assignment:
Ammonia – the assigned values for ammonia are based on results from 3
instruments, 3 reagent lots, and 9 test runs. Each run generates 10
replicates per calibrator level resulting in 90 total replicates per level.
Carbon Dioxide - the assigned values for CO are based on results from 3
2
instruments, 3 reagent lots, and 9 test runs. Each run generates 5 replicates
per calibrator level resulting in 45 total replicates per level.
Ethyl Alcohol - the assigned values for alcohol are based on results from 3
instruments, 3 reagent lots, and 9 test runs. Each run generates 5 replicates
per calibrator level resulting in 45 total replicates per level.
The labeling states that obtained values should fall within the specified range
provided in the labeling and that laboratories should establish appropriate
acceptance criteria when using this product for its intended use.
Stability:
Calibrator shelf life is determined in real-time. Protocols and acceptance

criteria were reviewed and determined to be acceptable. The testing supports
the sponsor’s claimed shelf life stability of 12 months when stored at 2-8ºC.
Calibrator opened vial stability is determined in real-time. Protocols and
acceptance criteria were reviewed and determined to be acceptable. The
testing supports the sponsor’s claimed opened vial stability of 30 days when
stored at 2-8ºC.
Storage recommendations are provided in the labeling.
