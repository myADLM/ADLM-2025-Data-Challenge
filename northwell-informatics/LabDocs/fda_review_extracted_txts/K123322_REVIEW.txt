L. Test Principle:
The ACE BUN/Urea Reagent is a photometric assay in which urea in serum is
hydrolyzed by urease to yield ammonia and carbon dioxide. The ammonia formed
subsequently reacts with 2-oxoglutarate and NADH in the presence of glutamate
dehydrogenase (GLDH) to yield glutamate and NAD. NADH absorbs strongly at
340 nm, whereas NAD+ does not. The decrease in absorbance of NADH, monitored
bichromatically at 340 nm/647 nm, is proportional to the urea concentration in the
sample.
The ACE Creatinine Reagent is a photometric assay based on Jaffe reaction, in which
serum creatinine reacts with picric acid in an alkaline medium to form a red-orange
colored complex, which absorbs strongly at 505 nm. The rate of complex formation is
determined by the increase of absorbance at 505 nm/573 nm during a fixed time
interval; this rate is directly proportional to the creatinine concentration in the sample.
The ACE Uric Acid Reagent is based on a photometric assay in which serum uric
acid is oxidized by uricase to allantoin and hydrogen peroxide, which subsequently
reacts to coupled chromogen dichlorohydroxybenzene sulfonic acid (DHBS) and 4-
aminoantipyrine (AAP) in a reaction catalyzed by peroxidase and produces a red
colored quinoneimine complex; which are measured by the increase in absorbance
at 505 nm/610 nm. This increase is directly proportional to the uric acid
concentration in the sample.
The ACE CK Reagent is a coupled enzymatic reaction in which serum creatine
kinase (CK) first catalyzes the conversion of creatine phosphate and adenosine
diphosphate (ADP) to creatine and ATP. Subsequently, hexokinase (HK) uses the
ATP produced to phosphorylate D-glucose to form D-glucose-6-phosphate and
ADP. In the final reaction, the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-
PDH) uses D-glucose-6-phosphate to convert nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate (NADP+) into NADPH, absorbs strongly at 340 nm. The rate of
conversion of NADP+ to NADPH, which is a function of the activity of CK in the

--- Page 7 ---
sample, is determined by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 340 nm/378
nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the BUN, Creatinine, uric acid and CK assays on an in-house
ACE Alera analyzer was evaluated using human serum samples at 3
concentrations of the respective measurand using 20 day precision study. The
study was performed measuring each sample 2 times per run, 2 runs per day for
20 days for a total of 80 measurements per sample using 1 reagent lot. The results
are provided in the table below.

Plasma and Serum in house precision study:
The precision of the BUN, Creatinine, uric acid and CK assays for matched
serum and Lithium heparin plasma samples at 3 concentrations of the respective
measurand was evaluated in house over a period of 3 to 5 days. In this study,
matched serum and plasma with a low concentration of measurand from a single
donor was spiked to a high concentration of measurand with commercially-
available analyte and then the remaining sample prepared by intermixing. CK
was measured 2 times per run for 3 runs per day for 3 days (N=18). For BUN,
Creatinine, and UA the study was performed measuring each sample 2 times per
run, 2 runs per day for multiple days using 1 reagent lot for a total of 16
measurements per sample for BUN, 20 measurements per sample for Creatinine,
16 measurements per sample for UA. All samples were tested on the ACE, ACE
Alera and ACE Axcel analyzers. The precision results are summarized in the
table below.

Serum POL precision study:
The precision of the BUN, Creatinine, uric acid and CK assays at in-house and 3
physician office laboratories (POLs) for matched serum samples at 3
concentrations of the respective measurand was evaluated using a multiple day
precision study. In this study, serum with a low concentration of measurand from
a single donor was spiked to a high concentration of measurand with
commercially-available analyte and then the remaining sample prepared by
intermixing. The study was performed measuring each sample 2 times per run, 2
runs per day for 5 days using 1 reagent lot for a total of 20 measurements per
sample on the ACE Alera analyzer. The precision results are provided in the table
below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor assessed linearity on the ACE Alera analyzer with one run using
one lot of reagents with each sample tested in triplicate. Six diluted samples
with measurand concentrations evenly distributed were prepared by diluting a
high measurand concentration serum pool. This yielded linearity samples with
levels that spanned the measuring range of each of the four analytes (BUN,
Creatinine, UA and CK) measured.
The sponsor calculated linear and polynomial regressions from mean observed
values versus expected values using an unweighted regression model. The
linear regressions between the expected values and the measured values are
found in the table below:

the Uric Acid assay is 1.5 – 16 mg/dL, and the CK assay is 11 – 1350 U/L.
Autodilution dilution study:
Sponsor performed additional auto-dilution studies to confirm the auto-dilution
function (1:3) on the ACE Alera analyzer for each measurand for plasma and
serum samples by comparing the autodiluted results to the manual dilution results.
All samples recovered within ±10% bias.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
BUN method is traceable to NIST SRM 909. Creatinine assay is traceable to
NIST SRM 967. UA assay is traceable NIST SRM 909. CK assay is
traceable to a commercially available human enzyme.
The BUN, Creatinine, UA and CK calibrators have been previously cleared in
k930104.
d. Detection limit:
LoB, LoD and LoQ studies for each measurand were evaluated based upon
CLSI EP-17A using the ACE Alera analyzer.
LoB Test Protocol
True blank samples (n = 5) were measured in replicates of 4 for 3 days for a

total of n = 60 measurements. The LoB was calculated as the mean of the 57th
and 58th highest values for the true blanks.
LoD Test Protocol
Low serum-based samples (n = 5) and true blanks (n = 5) were measured in
replicates of 20 per day for 3 days for a total of n = 120 measurements.
LoQ Test Protocol
LoQ was determined by evaluating 5 low level samples with multiple
replicates over multiple days for a total of 40 measurements per sample.
Sponsor defined LoQ as concentration with 20% CV inter-precision at the
95% confidence limit.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed according to CLSI EP07 to determine
whether the presence of hemoglobin, triglycerides (using Intralipid as a
mimic), icterus (bilirubin), and ascorbic acid may interfere with test results for
each measurand using the ACE Alera analyzer.
Human serum samples were used with two different concentrations (normal
and abnormal) of measurand (BUN, creatinine, UA, and CK). Each sample
level was spiked with increasing amounts of interferents for a total of 7
samples with interferent. Controls samples at each level that were not spiked
were used to compare with the spiked samples. The spiked and unspiked
samples were tested and used to calculate % recovery (measured
concentration compared to measurand concentration with zero interferent).
Measurand recovery of <10% of control value was defined as non-significant
interference. The results of the highest concentration tested without
significant interference are summarized in the table below.
Icterus Hemolysis Lipemia Ascorbic Acid
Measurand
(mg/dL) (mg/dL) (mg/dL) (mg/dL)
BUN 70 500 2080 6
Creatinine 6.0 1000 2080 6
UA 16.9 125 893 1.3
CK 30 125 2372 6
Since hemolysis affects UA and CK results, the sponsor has the following
limitations in the labeling:
“Specimens showing any indication of hemolysis should not be analyzed.
Use clear, unhemolyzed sample” For UA and CK.
Sponsor also has the following limitation for ascorbic acid in the labeling for
Uric acid:
“Ascorbic acid concentrations above 1.3 mg/dL have been shown to •
interfere with this assay. Non-fasting patients taking a high dose of
vitamin C may cause low uric acid levels and results should be interpreted
with caution. The literature has reported that ascorbic acid has disappeared
from serum samples, as an interfering substance, in less than 90 minutes.”

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were completed at 3 POC sites and in house
following CLSI document EP9-A2. Samples were run on the ACE Clinical
Chemistry System at Alfa Wassermann and the results were compared against
those gathered on ACE Alera Clinical Chemistry Systems at 3 Physician
Office Labs. At least 40 determinations were made in singlicate for serum
samples drawn from the same individuals on each platform. To test across the
assay reportable ranges, additional sets (< 6 sets) of altered samples (spiked or
diluted) were used to cover the full measuring range of each analyte. Results
are summarized in the table below:
