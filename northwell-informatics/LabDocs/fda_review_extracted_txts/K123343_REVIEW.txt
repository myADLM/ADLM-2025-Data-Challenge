“This product contains human sourced and/or potentially infectious components.
Components sourced from human blood have been tested and found to be nonreactive
for HBsAg, anti-HIV 1/2, and anti-HCV. No known test method can offer complete
assurance that products derived from human sources or inactivated microorganisms
will not transmit infection. Therefore, it is recommended that all human sourced
materials be considered potentially infectious and handled with appropriate biosafety
practices.”

L. Test Principle:
The Thermo Scientific QMS Tacrolimus Assay is a homogeneous particle-enhanced
turbidimetric immunoassay based on competition between drug in the sample and
drug coated onto a microparticle for antibody binding sites of the tacrolimus
antibody reagent. The tacrolimus-coated microparticle reagent is agglutinated in the
presence of the anti-tacrolimus antibody reagent and in the absence of any
competing drug in the sample. The rate of absorbance change is measured
photometrically at 700 nm. When a sample containing tacrolimus is added, the
agglutination reaction is partially inhibited, slowing down the rate of absorbance
change. A concentration-dependent agglutination inhibition curve can be obtained

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Performance was validated on the Beckman AU 680 Analyzer.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was determined at various concentration levels across the assay
range. Three whole blood pools were comprised of samples obtained from
patients taking tacrolimus and three negative whole blood pools spiked with
tacrolimus were tested for precision. Following CLSI protocol EP5-A2, each
tacrolimus sample was assayed in replicates of two, twice a day for 20 days
for a total of 40 runs on two reagent lots. Each run per day was separated
by at least two hours. Evaluations were performed at the manufacturer’s site
and at external sites. Results were similar across lots. Representative results
from manufacturer site testing are shown below:

Results of the linearity and recovery studies are consistent with the Sponsor’s
claimed range of 1-30 ng/mL.
High tacrolimus samples (including spiked whole blood and pooled patient
samples) were serially mixed with tacrolimus-free samples to attain 13
concentrations ranging from 0.8 to 30 ng/mL tacrolimus. The high sample
expected concentration was based on a chromatographic method; the remainder
were based on percent dilution of the high sample. Replicate samples (n=4)
were measured using the QMS method and the means were compared to
expected values. Linear regression results are as follows:

concentration of known concentrations of USP tacrolimus were spiked into
negative whole blood samples to yield final expected concentrations of 3, 10,
15, 22, and 25 ng/mL of tacrolimus. Replicates of each concentration level
were separately extracted and measured with the QMS assay. Mean values for
each concentration level were compared with the expected values based on
USP materials (and verified using chromatographic methods). Two reagent lots
were evaluated. Results were similar for both lots. Representative results are

Manual dilution:
Testing was performed to validate the manual dilution protocol recommended
by the manufacturer in the package insert. The following types of samples
were prepared for testing: (i) spiked tacrolimus in negative whole blood at a
concentration of 45 ng/mL, (ii) patient sample with additional tacrolimus
added to 40 ng/mL, and iii) tacrolimus patient samples with concentration
close to but within the upper limit of the reportable range. The samples were
diluted 1:1 with Calibrator A and measured by the Thermo Scientific QMS
Tacrolimus Immunoassay. Percent recoveries (based on measured/expected
concentration) were determined for each sample (tested with two reagent lots).

blood matrix at 0, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 30 ng/mL target concentrations to form Cal
A to Cal F. Calibrators are traceable to USP material. Value assignment is
based on USP material and verified by chromatographic methods. The
QMS® Tacrolimus Calibrators are traceable to USP reference standard,
through value assignment. The reported estimated uncertainty in assigned
values range from 0.21 ng/mL for Cal B to 0.65 ng/mL for Cal F.
Stability:
Real-time testing for opened and closed Thermo Scientific QMS®
Calibrators was performed. Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed
and deemed acceptable. The Sponsor’s claims of stability up to 15 months at
-20°C and for 42 days at 2-8°C when stored tightly capped are supported.
d. Detection limit:
To determine the Limit of Quantitation (LOQ), low concentration samples
were prepared gravimetrically using USP tacrolimus gravimetrically spiked
into negative whole blood at low concentrations. Each sample was tested
once per run, twice a day for 30 days for a total of n=60. All replicate
measurements were from separately extracted samples. LoQ was defined as
the point where the upper 95% confidence interval of %CV was < 20 and
mean recovery was within +/-10% (relative to material assigned based on USP
standards). Based on these criteria, a LoQ of 0.9 ng/mL was determined.
To verify precision and accuracy (by recovery) at the claimed LoQ, samples
were further tested by preparing spiked samples to 0.9 ng/mL and evaluating
precision and recovery on two instruments with two reagent lots. Each
sample was tested in 4 replicates per day for a total of 5 days. Summary
results are shown below:

e. Analytical specificity:
Specificity studies were conducted for (i) major metabolites of tacrolimus, (ii)
medications routinely co-administered with tacrolimus, and (iii) other over-
the-counter drugs. Concentrations tested and results are tabulated below.

QMS® Tacrolimus assay and by an LC-MS/MS (as well as by the Abbott
ARCHITECT® Tacrolimus assay). The majority of samples were from
patients > 9 months post-transplant. Patients within the population tested
received drug regimens of tacrolimus either alone or with co-administered
immuosuppressants such as mycophenolic acid, or corticosteroids. Samples,
were tested on the Beckman AU680® clinical analyzer with the QMS assay at
both Thermo Fisher Scientific and two external evaluation sites. Two QMS
reagent lots were evaluated. Results of regression analyses are shown below.
These results are based on analyses of single measurements for each sample
by the QMS assay.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable .
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable; this is a quantitative assay.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The following is stated in the package insert:
The optimal therapeutic range for tacrolimus in whole blood has not been
established with this assay. The therapeutic ranges for tacrolimus may vary
depending on clinical factors and on the methodology used. Given the
heterogeneity of the patient's clinical state, clinicians should establish a desired
therapeutic management range based on their own experience as well as each
patient's clinical requirements. Changes to treatment regimen should not be based
solely on tacrolimus values. Differences in sensitivity to immunosuppressive and
nephrotoxic effects of tacrolimus, co-administration of other
immunosuppressants, type of transplant, time post-transplant and a number of
other factors contribute to different requirements for optimal blood levels of
tacrolimus. Optimal ranges may vary depending on the test used, and therefore
should be established for each commercial test. Values obtained with different
assay methods cannot be used interchangeably due to differences in methodology
and cross reactivity, nor should correction factors be applied. Consistent use of
one assay for individual patients is recommended.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
