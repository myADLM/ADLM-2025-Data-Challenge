L. Test Principle:
The DIAsource 25 OH Vitamin D Total ELISA Test is an enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay to detect total 25OH Vitamin D (D2 and D3) present in human
serum. During the first incubation at room temperature, 25OH Vitamin D is
dissociated from binding serum proteins to fix on binding sites of a specific
monoclonal antibody. After washing, a fixed amount of 25OH Vitamin D-labeled
with biotin in presence of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) compete with unlabeled
25OH Vitamin D2 and 25OH vitamin D3 present on the binding sites of the specific
monoclonal antibody. After another incubation at room temperature, the
microtiterplate is washed to stop the competition reaction. A chromogenic solution
(TMB) is added and then stopped with a Stop Solution after the last incubation
period. The amount of substrate turnover is determined colorimetrically by measuring
the absorbance which is inversely proportional to the total 25OH Vitamin D
concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The inter-assay and intra-assay precision were performed in two separate
studies to cover the entire claimed range. Precision was calculated by running
four serum samples in singlicate at the given n value for 20 days using 3
different lots. The results are summarized in the table below:

D 24 81.2 ± 2.0 2.5 D 42 85.4 ± 4.0 9.4
The reproducibility of the assay was done by testing 60 serum samples each at 3
concentrations in duplicate for five days, twice a day, at three sites with two
technicians per site. The mean results are summarized in the table below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Two samples with known concentrations (96.7 and 122.9 ng/mL) were
tested at equidistant dilutions to determine the linear range of the assay. A
linear regression analysis was performed. The data showed the following
linear regression: Y= 1.005X + 0.435, r= 0.99.
The sponsor claimed that the assay range is 7.7 to 122.9 ng/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability and value assignment of calibrator:
The master calibrator stock is an ethanolic solution prepared in house by
weighing 25OH Vitamin D3. The value assignment for the calibrator stock
is made by UV absorbance at 254 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of
-1 -1
18000 L mol cm . The stock solution of 25OH Vitamin D is then used
to make calibrators by diluting into horse serum. Calibrator values for all six
levels have been assigned by using native serum samples that have been

assayed by LC/MS-MS. The LC/MS-MS method has been validated
against a reference method.
Value assignment for 2 levels of controls:
The mean values of multiple replicates obtained from 10 independent runs
wer assigned as the control target values. The controls target ranges were
assigned using the mean with specified precision values.
Stability:
Open Vial Stability – Calibrators and Controls are provided in lyophilized
form. Once reconstituted with DI water, they were stored at 4ºC for 7 days,
and frozen at -20ºC for one month, two months and three months with one
thawing. The study protocol and acceptance criteria have been reviewed and
found to be acceptable. The sponsor claims that the calibrators and controls
can be stored for 7 days at 4ºC or up to three months at -20ºC.
Closed vial stability and kit stability:
The shelf life studies were based on accelerated studies that supported the
sponsor’s claim of is 18 months at 4ºC. Real time studies are ongoing.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Detection:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and the Limit of
Quantitation (LoQ), were determined in accordance with the CLSI guideline
EP17-A.
The LoB was calculated by measuring the blank several times and calculating
th
the 95 percentile of the distribution of the test values. The LoB was calculated
to be 1.69 ng/ml.
The LoD was calculated by using the formula LoD = LoB + 1.65 x SDs (from
the CLSI EP17-A) where SDs is the standard deviation of a low value serum
tested 50 times. The LoD was calculated to be 2.81 ng/ml.
For LoQ determination, 5 samples with concentrations above the LoD were
tested 10 times. The LoQ was calculated to be 4.32 ng/mL based on an inter-
assay precision of 20% CV.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interfering Substances
The effect of potential interfering substances on samples using the DIAsource 25
OH Vitamin D Total ELISA test was evaluated. Different levels of
Hemoglobin, Bilirubin, Triglyceride, Vitamin C, Bilirubin Conjugate and
Unconjugated and Zemplar in serum samples were tested on samples with
different 25OH Vitamin D Concentration. The sponsor defined the acceptance
criteria of < 10% difference to be non significant. The labeling states that
hemolyzed samples should not be used.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The performance of the DIAsource 25OH Vitamin D Total ELISA test was
determined by conducting a correlation study tested at three different sites
using a total of 359 serum patient samples. The samples were tested on
both the DIAsource 25OH Vitamin D Total ELISA test and a commercially
available 25OH Vitamin D ELISA test manufactured by ImmunoDiagnostics
System (IDS). The results ranged from 8.0 ng/mL to 123.0 ng/mL,
The correlation coefficient between the two methods was 0.917, with the
95% confidence interval of 87.3% to 93.6%, slope of 0.954 and y-intercept of
3.05.
