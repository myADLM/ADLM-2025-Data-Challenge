--- Page 2 ---
The BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System is intended for the in vitro rapid
identification (ID) and quantitative determination of antimicrobial susceptibility by
minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Gram Negative aerobic and facultative
anaerobic bacteria belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae and non-
Enterobacteriaceae.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is intended for in vitro quantitative
determination of antimicrobial susceptibility by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)
of most Gram-negative aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria isolates from pure
culture for Enterobacteriaceae and Non-Enterobacteriaceae and most Gram-positive
bacteria isolates from pure culture belonging to the genera Staphylococcus, Enterococcus
and Streptococcus.
Imipenem has been shown to be active in vitro against most strains of microorganisms listed
below, as described in the FDA-approved package insert for this antimicrobial agent.
Active In Vitro and in Clinical Infections Against:
Acinetobacter spp.
Citrobacter spp.
Enterobacter cloacae
Escherichia coli
Klebsiella spp.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Serratia marcescens
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
For use with BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System
I. Device Description:
This submission is for the AST Panel only. The ID system was not reviewed.
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and software,
sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells containing dried
reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for ID and AST indicator. The organism
to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily identified as gram positive or gram
negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth, and equated to a 0.5 McFarland with the
recommendation to use BD nephelometer devices. A further dilution is made into an AST
broth, which turns to blue after AST broth indicator is added prior to inoculating the panel.
The AST broth is a cation-adjusted formulation of Mueller-Hinton broth containing 0.01%

Tween 80, and has a final inoculum of approximately 5 x 105 CFU/mL. After inoculation and
incubation, the color changes to pink then to colorless as reduction in the panel well
proceeds. Inoculated panels are barcode scanned and loaded into the BD Phoenix™
Automated Microbiology System instrument where the panels are incubated at 35°C and
continuously measured of changes to the indicator as well as bacterial turbidity to determine
the bacterial growth in the presence of an antimicrobial agent. Organisms growing in the
presence of a given antimicrobial agent reduce the indicator, signaling organism growth and
resistance to the antimicrobial agent. Organisms killed or inhibited by a given antimicrobial
do not cause reduction of the indicator and therefore do not produce a color change.
Additional interpretation is done using software driven “EXPERT” System using rules
derived from the CLSI documentation.
Readings are taken every 20 minutes with an AST result available between 4-16 hours. This
is only an autoread result; no manual readings are possible with this system.

Grow Aerobically”

L. Test Principle:
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth based microdilution method
that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-reduction) to enhance detection of
organism growth. The MIC is determined by comparing growth in wells containing serial
two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the growth in “growth control wells” which contains no
antibiotic.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Eighteen organisms were evaluated at three sites (one internal and two external) in
triplicate on three separate days using inoculum prepared manually or by the
automated BD Phoenix AP. Inter-site and Intra-site testing demonstrated
reproducibility of ≥95%.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The FDA and CLSI recommended QC isolates, E. coli ATCC 25922 and P.
aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were used with the reference method and the BD Phoenix™
Automated Microbiology System. Inoculum density was standardized by manual
(CrystalSpec or BD PhoenixSpec) or automated (BD Phoenix AP) methods. The BD
Phoenix™ was tested sufficient number of times to demonstrate that the system can
produce acceptable range results >95% of the time by both inoculum preparation
methods.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The broth dilution reference panel was prepared according to CLSI recommendation
and was used to compare with the BD Phoenix™ results. Clinical testing was
performed at three sites. The testing included both fresh clinical isolates and stock
isolates along with a challenge set with known results. The test device had a growth
rate of >95%. A comparison was provided to the reference method with the
following agreement.

EA-Essential Agreement maj-major discrepancies
CA-Category Agreement vmj-very major discrepancies
R-resistant isolates min- minor discrepancies
Essential agreement (EA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panels agree with the reference test panel
results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference method. Category agreement (CA)
is when the BD Phoenix™ panel result interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result
interpretation. Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the BD Phoenix™ and the
reference and have on-scale EA.
The overall performance was acceptable. There was one very major discrepancy with
P. aeruginosa resulting in an acceptable category agreement of 91.2% when
analyzing separately. Of the three major discrepancies, two were from Enterobacter
cloacae (maj discrepancy rate 2.1%) and one from E. coli (maj discrepancy rate
0.2%). The overall vmj rate and maj rate were 0.6% and 0.3% respectively; they
were acceptable. In the clinical studies, the trend was more resistant (1 dilution
higher) when comparing to the reference for these organisms: E. coli, K. oxytoca, K.
pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa.
The performance of the BD Phoenix AP was also evaluated in the challenge study
with acceptable results:
