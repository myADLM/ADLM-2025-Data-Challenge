H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The illumigene Mycoplasma DNA amplification assay, performed on the illumipro-
10™, is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test for the direct detection of DNA from
Mycoplasma pneumoniae in human throat and nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from
patients suspected of having Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection.
The illumigene Mycoplasma assay utilizes loop-mediated isothermal DNA
amplification (LAMP) technology to detect Mycoplasma pneumoniae by targeting a
segment of the Mycoplasma pneumoniae genome.
Results from the illumigene Mycoplasma DNA amplification assay should be used in
conjunction with clinical presentation, other laboratory findings, and epidemiological
risk factors as an aid in the diagnosis of Mycoplasma infection and should not be used
as the sole basis for treatment or other patient management. Positive results do not
rule out co-infection with other organisms and negative results in persons with
respiratory tract infections may be due to pathogens not detected by this assay.
Lower respiratory tract infection due to M. pneumoniae may not be detected by this
assay. If lower respiratory tract infection due to M. pneumoniae is suspected,
additional laboratory testing using methods other than the illumigene Mycoplasma
DNA Amplification assay may be necessary.
illumigene Mycoplasma is intended for use in hospital, reference or state laboratory
settings. The device is not intended for point-of-care use.

4. Special instrument requirements:
Testing is performed on the illumipro-10™ Automated Isothermal Amplification and
Detection System from Meridian Bioscience, Inc.
I. Device Description:
The illumigene Molecular Diagnostic Test System is comprised of the illumigene®
2

--- Page 3 ---
Mycoplasma DNA Amplification Assay Test Kit, the illumigene® Mycoplasma External
Control Kit and the illumipro-10™ Automated Isothermal Amplification and Detection
System.
The illumigene Mycoplasma assay utilizes loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)
technology to detect the presence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in human respiratory
specimens (throat and nasopharyngeal swab specimens). Each illumigene Mycoplasma
assay is completed using an illumigene Assay Control Reagent containing Control
material, an illumigene Reaction Buffer, an illumigene Mycoplasma Test Device and
microcentrifuge tubes. Respiratory specimens are combined with the illumigene Assay
Control Reagent. The Specimen/Control sample is manually extracted and purified using a
commercially available extraction kit (Qiagen, QIAamp® DSP DNA Mini Kit). Extracted
DNA is heat-treated. Target and Control DNA are made available for isothermal
amplification via heat- treatment. The heat-treated Specimen/Control sample is added to the
illumigene Reaction Buffer. DNA amplification occurs in the illumigene Test Device.
The illumipro-10™ heats each illumigene Mycoplasma Test Device containing prepared
sample and control material, facilitating amplification of target DNA. When M. pneumoniae
is present in the specimen, a 208 base pair sequence of the M. pneumoniae genome is
amplified and magnesium pyrophosphate is generated. Magnesium pyrophosphate forms a
precipitate in the reaction mixture.
The illumipro-10™ monitors the absorbance characteristics of the reaction solutions at the
assay Run Start (Signal , S) and at the assay Run End (Signal , S ). The illumipro-
initial i final f
10™ calculates the ratio of the Run End (Signal or S) reads with the Run Start
final f
(Signal or S) reads and compares the ratio to an established cut-off value. The
Initial i
illumipro-10™ performs this ratio calculation for both the TEST chamber and the
CONTROL chamber.
The illumigene Mycoplasma External Controls Kit contains a Positive and Negative Control
Reagent. External Control reagents are provided to aid the user in detection of reagent
deterioration, adverse environmental or test conditions, or variance in operator performance
that may lead to test errors. External Control reagents are provided for use in routine
Quality Control testing.

L. Test Principle:
The illumigene Mycoplasma assay is based on loop mediated isothermal amplification
technology (LAMP). Loop mediated amplification of DNA is accomplished by the use of
specially designed primers that provide specific and continuous isothermal amplification.
Magnesium pyrophosphate is produced as a by product of LAMP amplification. The
magnesium pyrophosphate forms a white precipitate in the reaction solution, giving the
reaction solution a turbid appearance. Change in sample absorbance created by precipitation
of magnesium pyrophosphate indicates the presence of target DNA and is considered a
positive reaction. The absence of target DNA results in no detectable change in sample
absorbance and is considered a negative reaction.

Reproducibility Study:
Blind coded panels of 10 samples were supplied to three independent laboratories.
Samples were randomly sorted within each panel to mask sample identities. Each
panel consisted of true negative (1 replicate), high negative (three replicates), low
positive (three replicates), and moderate positive (three replicates) concentrations.
Panel members were prepared in natural negative matrix in M4 non-nutritive
transport medium (polyester swab inoculated with normal nasal flora, screened
negative for M. pneumoniae) and were spiked with M. pneumoniae strain M129 to the
final concentrations indicated in the table below. The low positive sample
concentration was set near the Limit of Detection (LoD) which should generate

positive (2x LoD) concentrations.
Testing was performed in triplicate for each storage condition; (1) upper limit of
room temperature (32.5ºC) and (2) refrigerated (2-8ºC). All samples tested yielded
the correct results for sample storage of up to 49 hours for elevated room temperature
storage and up to 6 days at 2-8ºC. Study results demonstrated that throat and
nasopharyngeal swabs (both rayon and polyester) in the above described transport
media can be held at the claimed storage conditions: 19-29ºC for up to 48 hours
or at 2-8ºC for up to 5 days prior to testing.
Extracted Specimen Stability:
Studies were performed to evaluate storage parameters for storage of specimen
extracts prior to heat treatment. Samples consisting of rayon and polyester swabs with
M5 media in a simulated negative matrix were spiked with M. pneumoniae at high
negative, LoD and 5x LoD concentrations. Contrived negative samples were also
tested. Extracted samples were held at the upper limit of room temperature (29ºC)
prior to heat treatment and testing on the illumipro-10™. All extracted samples
yielded the expected results for storage up to 75 minutes. Study results validated the
claimed stability of 19-29ºC for up to 1 hour prior to heat treatment for specimen
extracts.
Controls
External Controls: The illumigene Mycoplasma External Control Kit includes
external positive and negative controls and is sold separately from the illumigene
Mycoplasma DNA Amplification Assay Kit. The positive external control contains
non-infectious plasmid DNA with M. pneumoniae and S. aureus inserts. The negative
external control consists of non-infectious plasmid DNA with a S. aureus insert.
Testing of external controls was performed for all analytical and clinical studies with
no discordant results. It is recommended that external controls are run with each new
lot and new shipment of illumigene Mycoplasma kits. External control testing should
be performed thereafter in accordance with appropriate federal, state and local
guidelines. Results from the illumigene Mycoplasma test kit should not be reported if
external controls do not produce the expected results.
Internal Control: Primers for amplification of the internal control are incorporated
into each device in the CONTROL chamber. Internal control DNA (Assay Control II
Reagent- phosphate-buffered solution containing formalin-treated E. coli harboring
plasmid containing a segment of the Staphylococcus aureus genome) is combined
with each specimen and processed through all steps of the procedure. The internal
control is present to monitor for sample processing, amplification inhibition, and
assay reagent integrity.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical Sensitivity studies were designed to determine the analytical limit of
detection (LoD) of the illumigene Mycoplasma DNA Amplification Assay. The
7

--- Page 8 ---
LoD is the lowest number of colony forming units (CFUs) per test aliquot that can
be distinguished from negative samples with a high degree of probability (95%).
Two M. pneumoniae strains, FH (ATCC 15531) and M129, were evaluated.
Aliquots from the two strains were sent to an independent testing facility for
concentration determination by colony count. Samples were prepared in a natural
negative matrix (rayon swabs in M4 non-nutritive Transport Medium inoculated
with normal nasal flora previously screened negative for M. pneumoniae).
Replicates for each dilution were tested with the illumigene Mycoplasma DNA
Amplification Assay; however, testing for a specific concentration was discontinued
when more than one negative result was obtained. The lowest dilution producing
positive results in a minimum of 19 of 20 replicates was identified as the LoD.
Testing was performed using three lots of reagents and six illumipro-10™
instruments. External Positive and Negative Controls were tested each day
throughout the study. The LoD for the assay was confirmed as 88 CFU/Test (2,350
CFU/mL) for the FH strain (ATCC 15531) and 7.5 CFU/Test (200 CFU/mL) for the
M129 strain.
e. Analytical Reactivity/Inclusivity:
Nine additional strains (see table below) of M. pneumoniae were tested with the
illumigene Mycoplasma DNA Amplification Assay and produced the expected
positive results at or below stated assay LoD of 88 CFU/Test (2,350 CFU/mL).
Samples were diluted in sterile saline and spiked into negative matrix which consisted
of rayon swabs inoculated with normal nasal flora and placed into M4 Transport
Media. The nasal matrix was previously screened as negative for M. pneumoniae.
Three replicates of each strain were tested resulting in 100% detection. Both M.
pneumoniae Type 1 and Type 2 strains were represented.

An interference study was carried out to evaluate the effect of potentially interfering
substances on the accuracy of test results obtained with the illumigene Mycoplasma DNA
Amplification Assay. Potentially interfering substances were diluted in sterile saline and
added to M4 medium with rayon swabs (negative sample) and to M4 medium with
polyester swabs (positive samples). Two sets of positive samples were spiked separately
with M. pneumoniae strain M129 and with M. pneumoniae strain FH (ATCC 15531) at

concentrations near the LoD. Testing included three replicates for each interferent alone
(negative sample) and three replicates for each interferent mixed with each of the two M.
pneumoniae strains (six positive samples per interferent).
Testing of the following biological substances at the concentrations indicated
demonstrated no interference (no false positive or false negative results): Mucus (5.0
mg/mL), White blood cells (0.5% v/v), and whole blood (5% V/V).
Testing of the following chemical substances at the concentrations indicated
demonstrated no interference (no false positive or false negative results):
Acetaminophen (18.1 mg/mL), Albuterol Sulfate (20 mg/mL), Aspirin (9.1

Robitussin® Cough+Chest Congestion Cough Syrup [Dextromethorphan HBr (0.20
mg/mL), Guaifenesin (2.0 mg/mL)], Saline Nasal Spray [Sodium chloride (0.65
mg/mL)].
The presence of phenylephrine HCl (found in nasal decongestants and flu and cold
tablets) at concentrations above 0.595 mg/mL yielded false negative results with M.
pneumoniae strain M129. This information is included as a limitation in the package
insert.
g. Analytical specificity/Cross-reactivity:
Potentially cross-reacting microorganisms expected to be present in throat or
nasopharyngeal swab specimens were added to samples both negative and positive
for M. pneumoniae. Negative samples were prepared with M4 transport medium
inoculated with nasal flora on rayon swabs and did not contain M. pneumoniae.
Positive samples were prepared by spiking confirmed negative sample matrix (M4
transport medium inoculated with nasal flora on polyester swabs) with Mycoplasma
pneumoniae, FH strain (ATCC 15531) at concentrations near the LoD. Three
replicates were tested for both positive and negative samples and for each potential
cross-reacting organism.
Samples of each potentially cross-reactive (or interfering) microorganism were
prepared at minimum concentrations of > 1.0 x 106 CFU/mL for bacteria/fungi and
>1.0 x 105 TCID /mL for viruses. Human DNA was tested at 2.0 ng/test.

negative results in one of three M. pneumoniae-positive replicates tested. Testing of
an additional four replicates for each of the three potentially interfering organisms
was performed with all additional replicates yielding the expected positive results.
Therefore for each of the three organisms, false-negative results occurred in one
of seven replicates.
h. Assay cut-off:
The illumigene Mycoplasma is manufactured with fixed cut-off values. The product
is designed around a pre-selected cut-off value and amplification reagent
concentrations are optimized to ensure appropriate reactions are obtained.
Development optimization includes evaluation of characterized positive and negative
clinical specimens. Amplification reagent concentrations are adjusted during design
as needed to ensure illumigene results are aligned with clinical specimen reported
results.
Cut-off values are applied in the following manner:
The illumipro-10™ calculates the ratio of the Run End (Signal final or Sf) reads with
the Run Start (Signal Initial or Si) reads and compares the ratio to an established cut-
off value. The illumipro-10™ performs this ratio calculation to both the TEST
chamber and the CONTROL chamber.
Fixed cut-off values for the CONTROL chamber are used to determine
validity. CONTROL chamber Sf:Si ratios less than 90% are considered valid and
allow for reporting of TEST chamber results (POSITIVE, NEGATIVE). CONTROL
chamber Sf:Si ratios greater than or equal to 90% are considered invalid. Test
chamber results are not reported for samples with an "INVALID" control result. More
stringent cut-off criteria are applied to the Control chamber reaction in order to ensure
that amplification is not inhibited, reagents are performing as intended, and sample
processing was performed appropriately.
10

--- Page 11 ---
Fixed cut-off values for the TEST chamber are used to report sample results. TEST
chamber Sf:Si ratios less than 82% are reported as ‘POSITIVE’ and TEST chamber
Sf:Si ratios greater than or equal to 82% are reported as ‘NEGATIVE’. Numerical
values for the CONTROL and The TEST chamber results are not displayed for the
user.
i. Fresh/Frozen Studies:
Meridian performed a fresh versus frozen study with 60 samples contrived from 30
fresh nasal wash specimens determined to be negative for M. pneumoniae using a
validated PCR assay. Each nasal wash specimen was tested both with and without M.
pneumoniae spiked into the sample. Spiked specimens were prepared at
concentrations near the LoD (7.5 CFU/test or 200 CFU/mL, initially tested with the
illumigene assay, and tested again after each of three freeze/thaw cycles. Study
results demonstrated 100% agreement for all negative samples for each freeze/thaw
cycle. For positive specimens, 29/30 specimens demonstrated the expected positive
result. One positive sample gave a false negative result after the first freeze/thaw
cycle but this same sample was positive after the second and third freeze/thaw cycles,
indicating that the sample had not deteriorated. Results of the study sufficiently
demonstrated that fresh and frozen specimens should provide equivalent results with
the illumigene Mycoplasma DNA Amplification Assay.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable, performance of the assay was evaluated in comparison to a composite
reference method of culture and PCR followed by bi-directional sequencing.
b. Matrix comparison:
Sample Type Equivalence Study:
Sample type equivalency studies were performed to confirm the suitability of several
swab types as well as several non-nutritive transport media for use with the
illumigene Mycoplasma DNA Amplification Assay. The following swab types were
evaluated: Cotton, Flocked Nylon, Foam, Polyester, and Rayon. The following non-
nutritive transport mediums were evaluated: M4, M4-RT, M5, Liquid Stuart, 0.85%
Saline and UTM-RT (Universal Transport Medium).
Contrived positive samples were prepared by combining confirmed M. pneumoniae-
negative matrices with the FH strain of M. pneumoniae at concentrations near the
LoD (2670 CFU/mL for NP swabs, and 920 CFU/mL for throat swabs. Leftover nasal
wash and throat specimens were used to prepare specimens for the study. Replicates
of both positive and negative samples were tested for all possible combinations of
specimen matrix, swab, and media type. All negative samples yielded correct results.
11

--- Page 12 ---
Three positive samples gave unexpected negative results: One replicate of a NP
matrix/rayon swab/M5 media combination and two replicates of a throat
matrix/polyester swab/M4 media combination.
Testing of four additional NP/rayon/M5 media samples yielded no discordant results.
Additionally, each of three variables (NP, rayon, M5) was challenged in combination
with other matrices, swab types and media types resulting in no additional false
negative results. Therefore, it is likely that the one original discordant result was
likely due to the use of M. pneumoniae concentrations near the LoD.
Twenty additional samples prepared in throat matrix/polyester swab/M4 media were
tested in a simulated matrix equivalency study with all 20 samples yielding expected
positive results. Therefore, it is likely that the two original discordant results for this
swab/media combination were likely due to the use of M. pneumoniae concentrations
near the LoD.
Swab and transport medium types with demonstrated performance are described in
the illumigene Mycoplasma DNA Amplification Assay Package Insert.
3. Clinical Studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and specificity
The illumigene Mycoplasma DNA Amplification Assay was evaluated in 2012 by
five independent clinical test sites located in the Midwestern, Southern, and Central
regions of the United States. A total of 334 throat and nasopharyngeal (NP) swab
specimens, collected from patients suspected of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection
were evaluated with the test device to establish performance characteristics.
The study included testing of leftover de-identified specimens submitted to the testing
laboratories for routine M. pneumoniae testing. Specimens were presumed to be from
symptomatic patients. Testing included prospectively collected and tested fresh
specimens, prospectively collected and retrospectively tested frozen specimens (all
comers), and retrospectively tested frozen selected specimens.
The performance of illumigene Mycoplasma DNA Amplification Assay was
compared to a composite reference method that included M. pneumoniae culture and
identification and a validated real-time PCR assay followed by bi-directional
sequencing for positive specimens. The culture portion of the composite reference
method was performed at four of the testing sites with one testing site sending
specimens to a reference laboratory for culture. All reference PCR assays were
performed by Meridian BioScience, Inc with sequencing performed by a reference
laboratory for positive specimens. For performance calculations, specimens positive
by culture or positive by real-time PCR and bi-directional sequencing were
considered positive. Specimens negative by both culture and PCR were considered
negative.
A total of 12 specimens were excluded from the performance analysis due to
inconclusive culture results and negative PCR results. A total of 103 (30.8%)

a. Four specimens originally identified by culture as positive were not confirmed by either the illumigene
assay or the independent PCR method. Results suggest sample degradation during storage.
b. One specimen originally identified by the illumigene assay and culture as positive was negative by the
independent PCR method. This specimen is classified as a false positive relative to PCR.
Age information was known for 83.5% (269/322) of patients included in the
performance analysis. Seven (2.6%) patients tested were between 0-28 days of age;
38 (14.1%) patients were between 29 days and up to 2 years of age; 139 (51.7%)
patients were between 2 and up to 12 years of age; 61 (22.7%) patients were
between12-18 years, and 9(3.3%) patients were between 18-21 years of age. The
remaining 15 (5.6%) study patients were 21 years or older. No performance
differences were noted based on chronological age.
The study population included 90 (27.9%) female patients and 91 (28.3%) male
patients. Gender was unknown for 141 (43.8%) of the study participants. No
performance differences were noted based on gender.
Clinical performance of the illumigene Mycoplasma DNA Amplification Assay was
assessed by testing de-identified nasopharyngeal and throat swab specimens lacking
clinical information; accordingly, the number of patients with M. pneumoniae
pneumonia included in the clinical studies was unknown and performance for this
group cannot be described separately.

The illumipro-10™ instrument heats each illumigene Mycoplasma Test Device
containing prepared samples and Control Reagent, facilitating amplification of target
DNA. When M. pneumoniae is present in a nasopharyngeal or throat swab specimen, a
conserved M. pneumoniae DNA sequence is amplified and magnesium pyrophosphate is
generated. Magnesium pyrophosphate forms a precipitate in the reaction mixture. The
illumipro-10™ instrument detects the change in light transmission through the reaction
mixture created by precipitating magnesium pyrophosphate. Sample results are reported
as Positive or Negative based on the detected change in light transmission.
