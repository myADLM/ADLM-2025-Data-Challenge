The FIRST RESPONSE Early Result Pregnancy Test is an over-the-counter
chromatographic immunoassay for the qualitative detection of human chorionic
gonadotropin (hCG) in urine. The device is intended for use as an aid in early
detection of pregnancy, in some cases as early as five (5) days before the expected
period, i.e., as early as six (6) days before the day of the missed period.

Important note regarding negative results:
Some pregnant women will not be able to detect hCG in their urine 5 days before
the expected period. If you test negative before your missed period, but think you
may still be pregnant, you should test again a few days after your missed period.
Important note regarding positive results:
Because this test detects low levels of hCG, it is possible that this test may give
positive results even if you are not pregnant. If you test positive, but think you may
not be pregnant, you should check with your doctor.
All results should be confirmed by your healthcare provider, especially when making
decisions about future medical care.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For over the counter use
4. Special instrument requirements:
None
I. Device Description:
The FIRST RESPONSE® Early Result Pregnancy Test is a screening device intended
for the early detection of pregnancy by the lay user through the qualitative detection of
human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) hormone in urine, in some cases as early as 5 days
before the expected period. The device consists of a chromatographic test strip
enclosed in plastic housing and the package insert. The test strip contains streptavidin-
biotin chemistry, mouse monoclonal and goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibodies. The
test result is displayed at the housing window for reading by the lay user after the
elapse of 3 minutes. Two pink lines indicate that hCG has been detected (pregnant);
one pink line indicates that no hCG has been detected (not pregnant).

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity is not applicable since this is a qualitative test.
The high dose effect was evaluated using intact hCG standards (WHO 4th IS)
ranging from 0.1 to 500 IU/mL hCG concentrations, and hCG βcf at 500,000
and 1,000,000 pmol/L levels. All samples yielded the expected positive results.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The test is calibrated against the WHO 4th IS for hCG.
The stability testing protocol and acceptance criteria used to support the shelf
life were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor claims a 24-
month shelf life for the test when stored below 86ºF (30ºC).
d. Detection limit:
Urine standards containing intact hCG at concentrations of 0, 3, 6, 10, 15, 25
mIU /mL were prepared in negative urine pool and calibrated against the WHO
4th IS for hCG. Each standard was tested in replicates of 20 with three lots of
the new device using the dip method, and with one lot of the new device using a
simulated midstream method. The results are summarized in the table below:

The results demonstrated that the analytical sensitivity of the new device (the
lowest concentration that yields 100% positive results) is 10 mIU/mL and the
cut-off level (at which approximately half of the devices yield positive results
and the remainder yield negative results) is 6 mIU/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Various prescription and OTC drugs (acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid,
ascorbic acid, ampicillin, atropine, caffeine, gentisic acid, phenothiazine,
phenylpropanolamine and tytracycline, all at 10 µg/mL), potential endogenous
interferents (glucose and albumin at 20 mg/mL, hemoglobin, bilirubin, and
estriol at 10 μg/mL) and homologous hormones (hLH and hFSH at 1000
mIU/mL, hTSH at 1 mIU/mL) were added to aliquots of urine pools that tested
negative for hCG and urine pools that contained hCG at 10mIU/mL. Samples
were tested in replicates of 10. No affects on test performance were observed.
f. Assay cut-off:
See detection limit section above.
2. Comparison studies:

Detection of hCG in Early Pregnancy Clinical Samples
A total of 454 urine samples from 50 characterized cycle segments of
conceptive cycles collected from 50 different pregnant women were tested by a
laboratory technician. Urine samples were masked and randomized. Each
urine sample was tested with one device selected from three device lots
according to a randomization table.
The new device detected hCG in 76% of the cycles five days before the
expected menstrual period and in 100% of the cycles on the day of the expected
menstrual period. The sensitivity of the new device with patient samples is
consistent with that of the predicate device. The following table summarizes
detection of hCG with the new device relative to the day of the expected
menstrual period (EMP) for the conceptive cycles tested.

urinary concentration of luteinizing hormone (LH), i.e., day of LH peak plus 15 days
(LH+15).
Lay user study
The sponsor performed two studies with lay user consumers:
In the first study, one hundred and two female subjects (89 non-pregnant and 13
pregnant) between the ages of 18 and 45 were recruited. The devices used in
this study were randomized from three lots prior to use by the lay users. Of the
total number of participants, 69 (68%) performed the test in mid-stream and the
remainder 33 (32%) used the dip method. Consumer interpretation of results
compared to lab technicians are tabulated below.

In the second study, forty eight lay users were recruited to interpret test results
from masked samples containing varying concentrations of intact hCG using
three lots of new devices. The results are summarized in the table below:
hCG concentration Lot #1 Lot #2 Lot #3
0 mIU/mL 16/16 negative 16/16 negative 16/16 negative
3 mIU/mL 14/16 negative 16/16 negative 16/16 negative
6 mIU/mL 8/16 positive 10/16 positive 7/16 positive
10 mIU/mL 16/16 positive 16/16 positive 15/16 positive
15 mIU/mL 16/16 positive 16/16 positive 16/16 positive
25 mIU/mL 16/16 positive 16/16 positive 16/16 positive
A few positive samples were detected at a low hCG concentration (3 mIU/mL).
The labeling states that it is possible that this test may give positive results even
if the user is not pregnant. Users are instructed to check with their doctor if
they test positive, but think they may not be pregnant.
All lay users were instructed to read the proposed package insert (in English) to
operate the device for the studies above. Each lay user was also given a
questionnaire to rate how well they understood the instructions. All lay users
agreed that the user instruction was written in a manner that was easy to use
and understand.
Non-pregnant urine sample analysis
A study was performed to determine the incidence of positive results in urine
from non-pregnant females when tested with the candidate device. Urine
specimens from non-pregnant women in pre-menopausal (ages 18-40), peri-
menopausal (41-55 years) and post-menopausal (>55 years) age groups were
evaluated. No pre-selection or pre-screening based on hCG was performed
prior to testing with three (3) lots of devices. The results are summarized in the
table below.
Age Group Urine specimens (N) Positive results (%)
18-40 years old 102 0/102 (0%)
41-55ears old 102 0/102 (0%)
