places on the display. Users are instructed to power on the device by depressing the
on/off button for 2 – 3 seconds, and to insert a new mouthpiece. The display will read
“Blow” with a moving zero, indicating that it is ready for a measurement to be taken.
Users are then instructed to breathe in deeply and to blow evenly into the mouthpiece for
3 – 5 seconds. The device will beep during the measurement and users are instructed to
stop blowing when the device stops beeping. Results are displayed a few seconds later.
2. Principles of Operation:
The PAS Alcovisor Satellite and the PAS Alcovisor Mars are breath alcohol analyzers
designed to sample a user’s deep lung breath to test for the presence of alcohol. The
sensor is an electrochemical fuel cell which will only respond to alcohol. After the user
blows into the device using a disposable mouthpiece a small sample of breath is drawn
into the fuel cell by an automatic pump and a chemical reaction occurs between the
alcohol and fuel cell. This reaction generates an electrical current which is directly related
to the amount of alcohol in the sample. The current is then converted to a Blood Alcohol
Concentration (BAC) level and displayed for the user. The relationship between alcohol
in a person’s deep lung breath and in their blood is well established using Henry’s law,
which gives a ratio of 2100:1.The Satellite and Mars are handheld devices made from
durable plastic with an internal circuit board. The Satellite uses an internal rechargeable
battery and the Mars uses three AAA batteries.
3. Modes of Operation:
Both devices have an automatic and manual sampling mode. The manual sampling mode
is designed for persons with reduced lung capacity who may not be able to activate the
automatic sampling mode. The labeling instructs users that when using the manual mode
they should blow into the device for a minimum of 6 seconds, and that failure to do so
may result in an inaccurate reading.
4. Specimen Identification:
There is no mechanism to identify the specimen; however, the Satellite Alcovisor device
can recall the last 10 tests taken. The Alcovisor Mars can recall only the last
measurement taken.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The user provides a breath sample by blowing into the device.
6. Calibration:
The device is calibrated at the factory and sent directly to the end user. The sponsor
recommends a recalibration interval of every 250 tests or every 12 months, whichever
comes first. These intervals are based on calibration stability data collected internally.
The unit must be sent back to the factory for calibration.

J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy:
The sponsor performed a consumer study to determine if consumers could correctly
use and interpret the device using only the supplied instructions for use. Results were
compared to an evidential breath alcohol tester (the Alcovisor Mercury).
Satellite
Twenty-eight participants took their breath alcohol reading with the candidate device
and recorded the result. Immediately afterward, the participants were administered a
breath alcohol test using the evidential device. The breath alcohol concentrations
ranged from BAC of 0.000 to 0.045 by the evidential device. Linear regression
analysis of the data showed a slope of 0.9638, a y-intercept of 0.0007 and a
correlation coefficient of 0.9680. After the study, participants were asked to respond
to statements about ease of use and interpretation of the device. Results are
summarized as follows:

Twenty-eight participants took their breath alcohol reading with the candidate device
and recorded the result. Immediately afterward, the participants were administered a
breath alcohol test using the evidential device. The breath alcohol concentrations
ranged from BAC of 0.000 to 0.047 by the evidential device. Linear regression
analysis of the data showed a slope of 0.9981, a y-intercept of 0.0018 and a
correlation coefficient of 0.9083. After the study, participants were asked to respond
to statements about ease of use and interpretation of the device. Results are

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision and accuracy of the Satellite and Mars devices has previously been
demonstrated through testing at the US Department of Transportation (DOT). For
precision and accuracy, these requirements (referred to as Model Specifications)
consist of 20 trials at a Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) of 0.008, 20 trials at a
BAC of 0.032, and 20 trials at a BAC of 0.000. Blood Alcohol Concentrations are
simulated in breath by a Breath Alcohol Sample Simulator (BASS), which provides
an alcohol-in-air test sample with known alcohol concentrations, flow rate, and air
composition. The acceptance criteria for the Model Specifications are: not more than
one negative result at 0.032 BAC, not more than one positive result at 0.008 BAC,
and not more than one negative greater than zero and no positives at 0.000 BAC.
NOTE: for the purposes of this study, a BAC of 0.020 is used to distinguish a positive
from a negative result. The Satellite and Mars devices met all of the applicable
NHTSA requirements for precision and accuracy.

c. Linearity:
The Satellite and Mars devices will report concentrations from 0.000 to 0.400% BAC.
However, the DOT Model Specifications require accuracy and precision testing up to
a concentration of 0.032 only; therefore, true linearity over the entire measuring range
of the device was not evaluated by DOT. Both devices met all of the applicable
NHTSA requirements for precision and accuracy as described above.
d. Carryover:
Carryover studies are not required by NHTSA and were not performed using these
devices.
e. Interfering Substances:
The DOT Model Specifications require testing with cigarette smoke to assess any
possible interference. Five trials are required at 0.000 BAC. An alcohol free
individual who smokes cigarettes is appropriate for this trial. The subject is asked to
smoke approximately one half of a cigarette. Within one minute after smoking, or
after a waiting period specified in the manufacturer’s instructions*, the subject
performs the breath alcohol test according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
subject is then asked to smoke another inhalation and repeat the test to produce a total
of five trials. The acceptance criterion for this trial is: no positive results. The Satellite
and Mars devices had no positive results.
*The sponsor’s labeling recommends the user wait 15 minutes after consuming
alcohol, smoking, or eating to test a breath sample.
2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
a. Limit of Detection
The DOT Model Specifications do not specifically address the detection limit of
breath alcohol devices. However, the devices must be tested at a BAC of zero
(blank reading) to assess the possibility of false positives. This consists of 20
trials under normal laboratory conditions at a BAC of 0.000. Non-alcoholic
human breath is to be used as the sample. For devices capable of providing a
reading of greater than 0.000 BAC and less than 0.020 BAC, the acceptance
criterion is: not more than one such result. The Satellite and Mars devices had no
false positives in this trial.
b. Temperature
The DOT Model Specifications require testing 10 and 40o C to assess any
possible effects of temperature. At 10o C, 20 trials are required at 0.008 BAC and
20 trials are required at 0.032 BAC. Acceptance criteria are: not more than one
8

--- Page 9 ---
positive result at 0.008 BAC, and not more than one non-positive result at 0.032
BAC. The PAD – Personal Alcohol Detector had no positive results at 0.008 BAC
and no non-positive results at 0.032 BAC. At 40o C, the requirements are
identical. The Satellite and Mars devices had no positive results at 0.008 BAC and
no non-positive results at 0.032 BAC.
c. Vibration
The DOT Model Specifications require vibration testing to assess any possible
vibrational effects. Twenty trials are required at 0.008 BAC and 0.032 BAC.
Acceptance criteria are: not more than one positive result at 0.008 BAC, and not
more than one non-positive result at 0.032 BAC. The Satellite and Mars devices
had no positive results at 0.008 BAC and no non-positive results at 0.032 BAC.
d. Cutoff
For the purposes of performance testing, a BAC cutoff of 0.020 was used to
distinguish positive from negative samples.
K. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
L. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
