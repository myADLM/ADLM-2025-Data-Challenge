L. Test Principle:
The Abbott carbamazepine assay is a homogenous particle-enhanced turbidimetric
inhibition immunoassay (PETINIA) used for the analysis of carbamazepine in serum
or plasma. The assay is based on competition between drug in the sample and drug
coated onto a microparticle of antibody binding sites of the carbamazepine antibody
reagent. The carbamazepine-coated microparticle reagent is rapidly agglutinated in
the presence of the anti-carbamazepine antibody reagent and in the absence of any
competing drug in the sample. The rate of absorbance change is measured
photometrically, and is directly proportional to the rate of agglutination of the
particles. When a sample containing carbamazepine is added, the agglutination
reaction is partially inhibited, slowing down the rate of absorbance change. A
concentration-dependent classic agglutination inhibition curve can be obtained, with
maximum rate of agglutination at the lowest carbamazepine concentration and the

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All studies were performed on the Architect c8000.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated following the CLSI EP5-A2 guidance. Pooled patient
samples at five carbamazepine concentrations and negative serum pools
spiked with carbamazepine stock solution (1 mg/mL) at five carbamazepine
concentrations were tested. Testing was performed at two locations (an
internal and an external site) on an Architect c8000 clinical chemistry
analyzer using one lot each of the reagents and the calibrators. Each
carbamazepine sample was assayed in replicates of two, twice a day for 20
days with a total of 40 runs and n=80. Each run per day was separated by at
least two hours. The mean, within-run and total-run SD, and with-run and
total-run %CV were calculated. The results obtained are as shown in the table
below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The claimed assay range is 1.9 to 20 ug/mL. To evaluate linearity, a series of
carbamazepine concentrations in serum were prepared by spiking into
negative serum and diluting the high sample to ten concentrations spanning
(and exceeding) the assay range. Concentrations included carbamazepine
ranged from 1.24 to 20.6 ug/mL. Four replicates were measured for each

concentration and the mean of measured concentration was compared with its
expected concentration. The expected concentration was based on dilution
factors and the high sample concentration. The concentration of the high
sample was determined by chromatographic testing traceable to purified
carbamazepine.
The linear regression results are:
Study Site Slope Intercept R2
Manufacturer Site 1.073 0.029 0.9990
External Site 0.983 0.065 0.9984
Recoveries relative to the target concentrations were within ±10% or within ±
0.4 ug/mL.
This evaluation supports linearity across the claimed measuring range of 1.9
to 20.0 ug/mL.
Spike/Recovery
Purified carbamazepine was gravimetrically spiked into negative human
serum at 2, 8 and 18µg/mL. Twenty one replicates for each sample were
tested in the assay. The average measured concentration was compared to its
expected concentration for each spiked sample, as determined by a
chromatographic method. The percent recoveries were less than ±10% for the
mid and high samples (8 and 18µg/mL) and were within 0.4µg/mL for
samples < 4µg/mL.
To validate labeling recommendations for dilution of high samples, high
concentration carbamazepine samples were prepared by adding reference
material to serum. Samples were manually diluted into Calibrator 1 or saline.
Three high sample concentrations (20, 25, and 30 ug/mL) were tested with
three replicates and two separate 4-fold dilutions each for a total of 18
measurements diluted into saline and 18 measurements diluted into Calibrator
1. Recoveries ranged from 101-107% of expected. The automated dilution
into saline was similarly tested and recoveries were within 95-101% of
expected.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators were previously cleared under k120936. See k120936 for
traceability, stability, and expected values information on calibrators.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor performed a study following CLSI EP17 guidelines to determine
the LoB and LoQ of the Abbott Carbamazepine assay on the Architect c8000
analyzer. The LoB was calculated to be 0.1018µg/mL.

--- Page 6 ---
Precision and bias at the LoQ were evaluated by adding reference material to
carbamazepine-free serum and carbamazepine- free plasma to attain
concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 3.2 ug/mL. Four replicates per day were
measured over 17 days with 2 lots of reagent. At the claimed lower limit of
1.9 ug/mL the upper 95% confidence limit of the CV was within <7%, and
bias relative to the known concentration was within ± 0.4 ug/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference by metabolites, drugs, and endogenous compounds was tested by
spiking the potential interferents into human serum containing carbamazepine
at concentrations of 4, 8, and 12 ug/mL. Corresponding control samples were
prepared by adding the equal volume of solvent that was in the stock solution
of the compound tested. Samples were measured in duplicate by the
carbamazepine assay. The compounds listed below did not interfere at the
concentrations shown below in the table. Recoveries were all within ± 6% of
expected.

concentrations expected from the intended use population into human serum pool
containing approximately 4, 8, and 12 μg/mL of carbamazepine. The potential
interference of Rheumatoid Factor (RF) and triglyceride was assessed using RF
patient specimens and two triglyceride specimens naturally high in these
substances and then spiking with carbamazepine at approximately 8μg/mL.
Corresponding control samples were prepared by supplementing the human serum
pool with the equal volume of solvent that was in the stock solution of the
compound tested or by spiking carbamazepine into negative human serum. Each
prepared sample and its control solution were measured in replicates of three.
The following compounds at listed concentrations cause minimal interference to
the assay. Carbamazepine recoveries observed were within ±3% of expected, and
no trends were observed.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Two correlation studies were performed using a modified CLSI guideline
EP9-A2 to evaluate the accuracy of the Abbott’s Carbamazepine Assay by
comparing patient sample measurements to the predicate Abbott Aeroset
Carbamazepine Assay. In the first study, 103 serum samples with
carbamazepine concentrations ranging from 2.2 to 18.2 ug/mL were tested by
the candidate carbamazepine assay (on-test) and Abbott Aeroset
Carbamazepine assay. In the second study, a different set of 105 serum
samples ranging from approximately 2-15 ug/mL were evaluated with the
candidate carbamazepine assay (on-test) and Abbott Aeroset Carbamazepine
assay.

b. Matrix comparison:
Matrix comparison studies were performed to evaluate the performance of
the following: serum in plastic, serum separator tubes (SST) in plastic,
plasma with sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate in plastic, plasma with
sodium heparin in plastic and glass, plasma with lithium heparin in plastic
with or without gel, plasma with K3 EDTA in glass and plastic, plasma
with K2 EDTA in plastic, and sodium citrate in plastic and glass,
compared to the control matrix (serum in glass) in the candidate
carbamazepine assay.
Samples were spiked with carbamazepine at multiple concentrations
spanning the assay range. Each spiked sample was measured in duplicate
by the Carbamazepine Assay. The results of samples prepared in the
evaluating matrix were compared to those of serum in glass by
determining the slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient, and recovery
for each sample relative to expected.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The package insert includes the following:
Therapeutic effect is usually achieved in the serum and plasma carbamazepine
concentration range of 4.0 to 12.0 µg/mL (17.0 to 51.0 µmol/L). Peak
carbamazepine concentrations above 15.0 µg/mL (63.0 µmol/L) are often
associated with toxicity.1,2
In addition, the sponsor has included the following in the labeling: For effective
treatment, some patients may require serum levels of carbamazepine outside these
ranges. Therefore, the expected range is provided only as a guide, and individual
patient results should be interpreted in light of other clinical signs and symptoms.
