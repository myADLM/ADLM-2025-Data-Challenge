Methods
L. Test Principle:
The LeadCare Ultra System Blood Lead Testing System is an in vitro diagnostic device that
relies on electrochemistry (Anodic Stripping Voltammetry or ASV) and a unique sensor to
detect lead in whole blood. Most lead is carried within red blood cells. When a sample of
whole blood is mixed with Treatment Reagent (a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid), the
red blood cells are lysed and the lead becomes available for detection. When a test is
run, the analyzer applies an electrical potential that causes the lead to collect on the
Sensor. The analyzer measures the amount of lead on the Sensor and displays the result in
micrograms per deciliter.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The LeadCare Ultra Precision Study was performed using bovine blood standards at
lead concentrations across the measuring range of the assay. Eighty (80) data points
were collected per concentration level over a 20 day period. Samples were prepped
two times per day and each sample was run in duplicate on alternating channels such
that all (6) channels were used equally during the study. For concentrations around
4.5, 6.4 and 62.1 μg/dL, three sensor lots were utilized. For the remaining
concentrations, one representative sensor lot was used. The combined data set is
shown below for within-run and total precision:

The data provided support the sponsor’s claim that the measuring range of this assay
is 1.9 to 65 µg /dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The controls supplied in the Test Kit are the same controls (2 levels of external
liquid control) already in use by the predicate device. The controls received FDA
clearance under k063398. Please see k063398 for controls information.
LeadCare® Ultra™ Blood Lead Analyzer contains a featured Calibration Button
Reader. This Reader allows for the download of all calibration information,
analytical test parameters, and date code information for any given Sensor lot. The
Calibration Button is supplied with each test kit.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation
(LoQ) were calculated based on CLSI EP17-A.
Six sample preps of the blank sample were prepared daily. Replicates of the
blank samples were run on the LeadCare Ultra Analyzer over five days using
two Sensor lots across all (6) analyzer channels. The limit of blank (LoB) and
Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined by measuring 70 replicates of near
blank NIST blood samples (0.3 µg/dL).
The LoB was calculated to be 1.5 µg/dL.
For LoD determination, seventy data points of the low sample were used to
calculate the LoD based on the following equation:
LoD = LoB + 1.645 x SD of low samples
The LoD was calculated to be 1.9 µg /dL.
To calculate the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) of the LeadCare Ultra Analyzer, 58
whole blood samples were collected in EDTA Vacutainers with blood lead
values at the range (1 – 6 µg/dL). The limit of quantification LoQ was calculated
using the Total Error equation:
Total Error LoQ =absolute (Bias) + (2 x SD).
The bias of 58 samples, according to GFAAS, was calculated to be 0.02 g/dL.
Based upon the results, the sponsor claims the LoQ = LoD (1.9 µg/dL).
e. Analytical specificity:
Each compound was tested for specificity with certain compounds and drug
metabolites. Each compound was spiked into drug-free blood.
6

--- Page 7 ---
Each sample was tested in 3 replicates and was run on 3 sensors. If any positive result
was observed, the compound, drug/drug metabolites were further diluted sequentially
to different concentrations and tested in triplicates until the highest concentrations
that generates negative results were determined. A summary of the interference study
is presented in the product package insert. Results are shown below for the tested
concentration of each compound that resulted in no interference.
