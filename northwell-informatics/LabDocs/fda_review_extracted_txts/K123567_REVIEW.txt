H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The FIRST RESPONSE™ Gold Digital Pregnancy Test is an over-the-counter
chromatographic immunoassay for the qualitative detection of human chorionic
gonadotropin (hCG) in urine. The device is intended for use as an aid in early
detection of pregnancy, in some cases as early as five (5) days before the expected
period, i.e., as early as six (6) days before the day of the missed period.
Important note regarding negative results:
Some pregnant women will not be able to detect hCG in their urine 5 days before
the expected period. If you test negative before your missed period, but think you
may still be pregnant, you should re-test again a few days after your missed
period.

I. Device Description:
The FIRST RESPONSE Gold Digital Pregnancy Test is a screening device intended
for the early detection of pregnancy by the lay user through the qualitative detection of
human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) hormone in urine, in some cases as early as 5
days before the expected period. The FIRST RESPONSE Gold Digital Pregnancy
Test consists of a plastic housed test stick containing an immunochromatographic
strip and electronic and optical components along with a microprocessor and
specific algorithms to digitally display test results. The test strip contains
streptavidin-biotin chemistry, mouse monoclonal and goat anti-mouse polyclonal
antibodies.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced
L. Test Principle:
The detection of hCG in urine is accomplished by a series of immunochemical
reactions via component reagents that are deposited onto a chromatographic strip
contained within the plastic housing.
A digital component integral with the chromatographic strip reads and displays the
result of the immunochemical reaction on an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) screen of
the device.
The test is performed by placing the absorbent collection tip of the device into the
urine stream for 5 seconds (or alternatively by fully immersing the collection tip for 5
seconds in a urine sample that was collected in a cup). A clock symbol will begin to
blink in about 30 seconds after the urine is applied to indicate to the consumer that the
test is working. The test result is read on the LCD screen of the device within 3
minutes. A "YES+" test result indicates that the pregnancy hormone (hCG) was
detected (pregnant) and a "NO-" test result indicates that no hCG was detected (not
pregnant).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Urine standards containing hCG at concentrations of 0, 3, 6, 10, 15, and 25
mIU/mL prepared in negative urine pool and calibrated against the WHO 4th
International Standard (IS) for hCG were tested using five different lots of the
First Response® Gold Digital Pregnancy Test. Each sample was tested in
replicates of ten for a total of sixty devices per lot. Testing was performed
over three consecutive days, each day using a different technician.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. This is a qualitative device.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The device is standardized to the World Health Organization’s 4th
International Standard for Chorionic Gonadotropin.
The devices are stable until the expiration date printed on box when stored in
the pouch at room temperature (30°C).
Stability testing protocols and sponsor’s acceptance criteria were reviewed
and found to be acceptable. The claimed shelf life of the devices stored in
pouches at room temperature is 2 years.
d. Detection limit:
To determine the detection limit and analytical cut-off of the FIRST
RESPONSE® Gold™ Digital Pregnancy Test, hCG urine standards of known
concentration were tested. Urine standards containing hCG at concentrations
of 0, 3, 6, 10, 15, and 25 mIU/mL were tested by laboratory technicians
according to package insert instructions with three lots of devices in replicates
of 20. The results show that the analytical sensitivity of the device (the lowest
concentration that yields 100% positive results) is 10 mIU /mL and the
analytical cut-off level at which approximately half of the devices yield
positive results and the remainder yield negative results is 6 mIU /mL. All
devices were negative at 0 and 3 mIU /mL.

An additional study was performed to assess the analytical sensitivity and cut-

e. Analytical specificity:
To determine if the FIRST RESPONSE Gold Digital Pregnancy Test has a
high dose hook effect, the test was challenged with samples with very high
levels of hCG. Urine hCG standards at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 and
500 IU /mL were evaluated with the FIRST RESPONSE® Gold™ Digital
Pregnancy Test devices according to package insert instructions in replicates
of 10 at each level. All devices tested with the hCG standards yielded the
expected positive results. No "high-dose hook" effect was observed at hCG
levels up to 500 IU /mL. The results are summarized below:

In order to evaluate the potential for high concentrations of hCG beta core
fragment (βcf) to cause false results, third trimester pregnancy urine samples
prepared to contain 500,000 and 1,000,000 pmol/L of hCG βcf were each
tested on 10 devices. All devices tested with the hCG standards yielded the
expected positive results. No "high-dose hook" effect was observed at hCG
βcf levels up to 1,000,000 pmol/L.

Detection of hCG in Early Pregnancy Clinical Samples
A total of 504 urine samples from 50 characterized cycle segments taken from
conceptive cycles collected from 50 different pregnant women were tested
according to package insert instructions. Every urine sample from each cycle
segment was randomized. Each urine sample was tested with one device
selected from three device lots according to a randomization table, and the
three device lots were represented equally across all of the samples included
within the study.
The FIRST RESPONSE Gold Pregnancy Test detected hCG in 60% of the
cycles five days before the expected menstrual period and in 100% of the
cycles on the day of the expected menstrual period. The table below
summarizes detection of hCG with the FIRST RESPONSE Gold Digital
Pregnancy Test relative to the day of the expected menstrual period (EMP) for
the conceptive cycles tested.

Non-pregnant urine sample analysis
A study was performed to determine the incidence of positive results in urine
from non-pregnant females when tested with the candidate device. A total of
306 urine samples (from 102 pre-menopausal women (ages 18-40), 102 peri-
menopausal women (ages 41-55), and 102 postmenopausal women (ages 56-
75)) were tested with three lots of FIRST RESPONSE Gold Digital Pregnancy
Tests according to package insert instructions. No pre-selection or pre-
screening based on hCG was performed prior to testing. The results of this
study are presented below:

Lay-user Study
The purpose of this study was to determine the ability of consumers to
perform a self-test using the FIRST RESPONSE® Early Result Pregnancy
Test, and read and interpret their test results following package insert
instructions. One hundred and two female subjects between the ages of 18
