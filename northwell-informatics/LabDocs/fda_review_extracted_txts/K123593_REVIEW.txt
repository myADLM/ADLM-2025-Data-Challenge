L. Test Principle:
The QUANTA Flash Sm and RNP assays are designed to run on the BIO-FLASH
instrument. This platform is a fully automated closed system with continuous load
and random access capabilities that automatically processes the samples, runs the
assay and reports the results. It includes liquid handling hardware, luminometer and
computer with software-user interface. The QUANTA Flash Sm and RNP assays
utilize a reagent cartridge format, which is compatible with the BIO-FLASH
instrument.
Native Sm or RNP antigen that is purified from calf thymus is coated onto
paramagnetic beads. The bead suspension is lyophilized and stored in the bead tube.
Prior to use in the BIO-FLASH system, the sealed reagent tubes are pierced with the
reagent cartridge lid and the beads are rehydrated and resuspended using
resuspension buffer by pipetting up and down with a transfer pipette. The reagent
cartridge is then loaded onto the BIO-FLASH® instrument. Samples are also loaded
onto the instrument in sample racks. A patient serum sample is prediluted by the
BIO-FLASH with system rinse in a small disposable plastic cuvette. Small amounts
of the diluted patient serum, the beads, and assay buffer are all combined into a
second cuvette, and mixed. This cuvette is then incubated at 37°C. The beads are
magnetized and washed several times. Isoluminol conjugated anti-human IgG
antibodies are then added to the cuvette, and again incubated at 37°C. The beads are
magnetized and washed repeatedly. The Isoluminol conjugate is oxidized when

(urea-hydrogen peroxide in sodium chloride solution) are added to the cuvette, and
the flash of light produced from this reaction is measured as Relative Light Units
(RLU) by the BIO-FLASH optical system. The RLU are proportional to the amount
of isoluminol conjugate that is bound to the human IgG, which is in turn
proportional to the amount of anti-RNP antibodies bound to the Sm or RNP on the
beads.
For quantitation, the QUANTA Flash Sm and RNP assays utilize a predefined lot
specific Master Curve that is uploaded onto the instrument through the reagent
cartridge barcode. Every new lot of reagent cartridge must be calibrated before first
use with the QUANTA Flash Sm and RNP Calibrators. Based on the results
obtained with the two Calibrators included in the Calibrator Set (sold separately), an
instrument specific Working Curve is created, which is used to calculate
chemiluminescent units (CU) from the instrument signal (RLU) obtained for each
sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the QUANTA Flash Sm/RNP assay was evaluated on

duplicates, twice a day, for at least 20 days. The %CV values were within the
acceptance limit. The within run, between run, between day and total

Reproducibility:
Three samples for Sm and RNP each were tested on two different regent lots,
using two different lots of calibrators, by two operators. Samples were run in
quadruplicates, two times a day, for 10 days, to generate 80 data points. Data
were analyzed and within run, between reagent lots, between calibrator lots,
between operators and total precision were calculated and the results are
summarized in the tables below. The %CV values ranged between 1.7 to

The claimed linear range for RNP IgG is 3.5 to 643.8 CU
Over the range detection:
The BIO-FLASH software has an auto-rerun option available. If this option is
selected, the instrument will automatically rerun any sample that has a result
>693.5 CU for Sm and >643.8 CU for RNP by further diluting it by a factor of
10, and calculate the actual CU using this additional dilution factor. Samples
as high as 6935 CU for Sm, and 6438 CU for RNP were tested.
High hook effect:
Five Sm and six RNP high positive samples were tested. The assay does not
appear to demonstrate a hook effect at high concentration: up to 2429 CU in
the Sm assay and up to 3140 CU in the RNP assay.
d. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
There are no recognized international standards for the measurement of anti-
Sm and anti-RNP antibodies. Calibrators and controls are traceable to in-
house standards that are used to create the master curve for the QUANTA
Flash Sm and QUANTA Flash RNP assays.
Value assignment:
Calibrators and controls are manufactured by diluting human serum that
contains high titer of anti-Sm or anti-RNP antibodies with a buffer stabilizers
and preservative. The human serum is obtained from commercial sources and
it is tested for markers of infectious substances. The target CU value is
achieved through trial dilutions on a small scale. Once a dilution is selected,

the calibrators and controls are bulked, tested, and adjusted. Upon completion
of the manufacturing process, the calibrators and controls are tested on at least
two instruments, on at least two lots, of reagent cartridge in replicates of 10 to
determine final value assignment.
The QANTA Flash® Sm/RNP Calibrators are designed to adjust the
predefined Master Curve into an instrument specific working curve.

limit of the four parameter logistic curve that the instrument uses to calculate
CU, and therefore cannot be converted into CU.
Limit of detection (LoD):
Five (5) serum samples were serially diluted until the RLU values no longer
show a decreasing trend, to low-level samples that are in between the LoB to
approximately 4 x LoB. The samples were run in replicates of 4 for 4 days to
obtain 16 measurements per sample for a total of 80 measurements. The LoD
of both assays is below lower limit of the reportable range which is 3.3 CU for
Sm and 3.5 CU for RNP.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interfering substances:
Three samples for each analyte were tested: Sm -16.3 CU, 28.6 CU and 190.7
CU; RNP – 8.8 CU, 55.5 CU, and 280.3 CU. Interfering substances were
spiked into the specimen in 10% of total specimen volume. The samples were
tested in triplicates. Recovery of the unit values was calculated compared to
control samples spiked with the same volume of diluent. No interference was
observed up to the concentrations listed in the table below:
Potential Interfering Concentration
Compound
Bilirubin 10 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 200 mg/dL
Triglycerides 1000 mg/dL
Cholesterol 224.3 mg/dL
Rheumatoid factor (RF) 500 IU/mL
Cross reactivity:
To test potential cross-reactivity, patient samples with various antibodies to
autoimmune or infectious disease markers were tested. The results are
summarized in the tables below:

f. Assay cut-off:
The cutoff was determined by testing samples from reference subjects, 232
samples for Sm and 255 samples for RNP. The cutoff was established as
>99th percentile of the results obtained on the reference subjects. The cutoff
for both Sm and RNP assay was set at:
Negative <20 CU
Positive ≥20 CU
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:

Samples for method comparison analysis include samples from the clinical
validation studies (SLE patients, other disease controls). There were 9
discrepant results: 3 SLE, one HIV, one other autoimmune, 2 scleroderma,
one ANA human reference sera, and one blood donor. Only samples within

samples). 14 samples were added to increase the number of samples around
the cutoff, 13 of them were diluted to achieve the desired antibody level.
There were 14 discrepant results: 9 SLE, one HIV and 3 diluted serum
samples. Only samples within the assay measuring range were included. The

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
A set of samples, none of which were used in establishing the reference range,
was used to validate the clinical performance of the Sm and RNP CIA. None
of the SLE samples are from drug-induced lupus patients.
QUANTA Flash Sm
A total of 379 samples were included in the Validation Set for the QUANTA
Flash Sm. None of these samples were used in establishing the reference
range. This validation set includes: 146 SLE patients, 202 samples from
patients with other rheumatic diseases (including 74 with systemic sclerosis
and 70 with RA), 2 samples from patients with autoimmune liver disease, 29
infectious disease serum samples (10 HBV, 9 HCV, 5 HIV, 5 syphilis). All
samples were run on the QUANTA Flash Sm CIA. The results were analyzed
to calculate sensitivity and specificity for SLE and are summarized below

4. Clinical cut-off:
Same as assay cutoff
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The anti-Sm and anti-RNP antibody levels were analyzed on a panel of 101
apparently healthy blood donors (71 female and 30 males, ages 18 to 55, with an
average age and median age of 34 years). With the cutoff of 20 CU, 1% of the
samples were positive. The mean concentration was:
QUANTA Flash Sm: 3.6 CU (ranging from <3.3 to 20.5 CU)
QUANTA Flash RNP: 5.7 CU (ranging from <3.5 to 196.8 CU) for

The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
