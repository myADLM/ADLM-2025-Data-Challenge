H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
FilmArray® Respiratory Panel (RP) is a multiplexed nucleic acid test intended for use with
the FilmArray Instrument for the simultaneous qualitative detection and identification of
multiple respiratory viral and bacterial nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS)
obtained from individuals suspected of respiratory tract infections. The following organism
types and subtypes are identified using the FilmArray RP: Adenovirus, Coronavirus 229E,
Coronavirus HKU1, Coronavirus NL63, Coronavirus OC43, Human Metapneumovirus,
Influenza A, Influenza A subtype H1, Influenza A subtype H3, Influenza A subtype H1-
2009, Influenza B, Parainfluenza Virus 1, Parainfluenza Virus 2, Parainfluenza Virus 3,
Parainfluenza Virus 4, Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus,
Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The
detection and identification of specific viral and bacterial nucleic acids from individuals
exhibiting signs and symptoms of a respiratory infection aids in the diagnosis of respiratory
infection if used in conjunction with other clinical and epidemiological information. The
results of this test should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other
management decisions. Negative results in the setting of a respiratory illness may be due to
infection with pathogens that are not detected by this test or, lower respiratory tract infection
that is not detected by a nasopharyngeal swab specimen. Positive results do not rule out co-
infection with other organisms: the agent(s) detected by the Film Array RP may not be the
definite cause of disease. Additional laboratory testing (e.g. bacterial and viral culture,
immunofluorescence, and radiography) may be necessary when evaluating a patient with
possible respiratory tract infection.
Due to the small number of positive specimens collected for certain organisms during
the prospective clinical study, performance characteristics for Bordetella pertussis,
Coronavirus 229E, Coronavirus OC43, Influenza A H1, Influenza A H3, Influenza A
H1-2009, Influenza B, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Parainfluenza Virus 1, Parainfluenza
2

--- Page 3 ---
Virus 2, and Parainfluenza Virus 4 were established primarily with retrospective
clinical specimens. Performance characteristics for Chlamydophila pneumoniae were
established primarily using contrived clinical specimens.
Due to the genetic similarity between Human Rhinovirus and Enterovirus, the FilmArray RP
cannot reliably differentiate them. A positive FilmArray RP Rhinovirus/Enterovirus result
should be followed-up using an alternate method (e.g., cell culture or sequence analysis).
The FilmArray RP assay for Coronavirus OC43 may cross-react with some isolates of
Coronavirus HKU1. A dual positive result may be due to cross-reactivity or may indicate a
co-infection.
Performance characteristics for Influenza A were established when Influenza A H1-2009, A
H1, and A H3 were the predominant Influenza A viruses in circulation. Performance of
detecting Influenza A may vary if other Influenza A strains are circulating or a novel
Influenza A virus emerges. If infection with a novel Influenza A virus is suspected based on
current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health
authorities, specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for
novel virulent Influenza viruses and sent to state or local health departments for testing. Viral
culture should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive
and culture specimens.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The device is for prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
FilmArray Instrument
I. Device Description:
The FilmArray RP system consists of three basic components: the FilmArray RP reagent kit,
the FilmArray instrument, and the FilmArray software. It was fully described earlier, please
refer to FDA cleared 510(k) submissions: k103175, k110764, and k120267. The table below
summarizes the organisms causing respiratory tract illness that can be detected
simultaneously by the FilmArray RP system.

Changes to device: New Adenovirus assay primers were designed based on an alignment to
complete coding sequences (CDS) from the NCBI nucleotide database for all Adenovirus
serotypes. The assays design emphasized detection of the respiratory serotypes of species B,
C, and E, including HAdv2 and HAdv6. In total, four new primers were added to the outer
(PCR1) multiplex and five inner (PCR2) primers were multiplexed as a single Adenovirus
assay (Adeno2) in three wells of the array not currently utilized by the system. No changes
were made to the existing panel assay primers.

L. Test Principle:
The FilmArray RP System is multiplex nucleic acid test system composed of the
FilmArray instrument, the FilmArray software (preinstalled on a laptop computer) and the
FilmArray RP pouch. The FilmArray RP pouch contains freeze-dried reagents to perform
nucleic acid purification, reverse transcription, and nested, multiplex PCR with DNA melt
analysis. A FilmArray test is initiated by loading water and a patient NPS sample mixed
with the provided Sample Buffer into the FilmArray RP pouch and placing it in the
FilmArray instrument. This process is simplified by the use of a specifically designed pouch
loading station. After the pouch is prepared, the FilmArray software guides the user though
the steps of placing the pouch in the instrument, scanning the pouch barcode, entering the
sample identification, and initiating the run. Please refer to previously cleared submissions
k103175, k110764, and k120267 for additional information.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Please refer to previously FDA-cleared 510(k) Premarket Notifications, k103175,
k110764, and k120267 for additional information.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There are no changes to the controls for the modified assay. Please refer to previously
FDA-cleared 510(k) Premarket Notifications, k103175, k110764, and k120267.
d. Detection limits:
The analytical sensitivity or Limit of Detection (LoD) for Adenovirus was determined by
testing limiting dilutions of quantified cultures with the modified FilmArray RP. LoD is
defined as the lowest concentration at which the analyte is consistently detected
(detection in ≥95% of samples tested). Simulated NPS sample matrix (cultured human
cells in VTM) was spiked with Adenovirus and 20 replicates were tested at the estimated
LoD concentration of 100 TCID /mL for each of the four respiratory serotypes (AdVC1,
50
AdVC2, AdVE4 and AdVC6). Adenovirus was detected in all 20 replicates for each
serotype and the system LoD for Adenovirus was reduced from 300 TCID /mL in the
50
original panel to 100 TCID /mL in the modified panel.

AdVE4 100 20/20 100.0% 300
AdVC6 100 20/20 100.0% 3,000,000
The LoD for all other analytes detected by the FilmArray RP was found to be equivalent
between the original and modified panels by testing replicate samples at LoD level as
well as bracketing levels.
e. Analytical reactivity:
The analytical reactivity of the modified FilmArray RP system was evaluated using 33
Adenovirus isolates representing 6 species (A-F) and 22 serotypes. These included both
respiratory and non-respiratory adenovirus isolates. The modified FilmArray RP is
designed to detect all respiratory species/serotypes of Adenovirus (B, C, and E).
Detection of non-respiratory species (A, D, F and G) will vary.
Samples were tested with both the original and modified panels at the Adenovirus LoD
established for the modified panel (100 TCID /mL). When Adenovirus isolate was not
50
detected by the modified panel at LoD, testing was repeated at 10x LoD (1,000
TCID /mL). Testing above 10x LoD was not performed.
50
AdVB55 and AdVC57 are the only respiratory serotypes that were not evaluated for
inclusivity as the sponsor could not obtain these strains. Available sequence information
for these serotypes indicates a perfect match to FilmArray Adenovirus assay primers and
efficient detection at 1x LoD is predicted.

b The initial test of AdVF41 at 1x LoD in the modified FilmArray RP pouch was negative. Adenovirus was detected on the retest.
f. Analytical specificity:
An analytical exclusivity study with modified FilmArray RP was carried out to assess the
potential for false positive results due to cross-reactivity between RP assays and other RP
or non-RP organisms. RP organisms and non-RP organisms were tested at high
concentrations and the non-RP organism exclusivity panel consisted of organisms that are
related to, but distinct from, RP target organisms, or that could be present in specimens
collected from the intended test population. Although not observed in this study, the
Coronavirus OC43 assay may cross-react with certain strains of Coronavirus HKU1
when present in the sample at high concentrations. A limitation pertaining to this
potential for false positive Coronavirus OC43 results due to cross-reactivity is included in
the product labeling.

a Highest test concentration possible based on the concentration of virus in the stock culture fluid.
The non-RP target exclusivity panel consisted of 26 bacteria, 6 viruses, and 1 fungus
(Candida albicans). These organisms were selected based on their relatedness to
FilmArray RP organisms, clinical relevance (cause respiratory symptoms or represent
nasopharyngeal flora), or high prevalence within the population (e.g. Herpes Simplex
Virus). Negative sample matrix was spiked with bacteria or fungi at a concentration of
106 CFU/mL and viruses at a concentration between 104 -105 TCID /mL, or the highest
50
concentration possible. The modified FilmArray RP system did not cross-react with the
exclusivity panel organisms.

g. Competitive interference:
Interference testing was performed by preparing simulated NPS samples with a
combination of two respiratory viruses, with one being Adenovirus. The competing
viruses were selected based on the dominant Adenovirus co-infections documented in the
FilmArray RP Clinical Evaluation. In total, five different virus combinations (co-
infections) were evaluated with each virus tested at a low level (LoD for organism) and at
a high or competing level (~ 5,000 – 100,000 TCID /mL). There was no interference
50
with competing organisms in a sample.

2. Comparison studies:
Clinical Comparison
To demonstrate performance of the modified FilmArray RP, a comparison study was
performed by testing 222 de-identified archived nasopharyngeal swab specimens
collected between 2008 and 2011 throughout the U.S. (at least 8 geographically distinct
locations) and Scotland (at least 1 location) with both the original FilmArray RP and
modified FilmArray RP. A total of 26 Adenovirus specimens were detected by the
modified FilmArray RP, of these only 15 were detected by original FilmArray RP. For
the other 19 organisms on the panel, performance appeared to be equivalent between the
original and modified FilmArray RP versions.

a 10/11 of the additional AdV detections by the modified FilmArray RP were confirmed to contain AdV by bi-directional
sequence analysis; these AdV were identified by sequencing as AdVC2, AdVC5, AdVC6, AdVE4, and one undetermined
serotype. One specimen could not be sequenced due to low analyte levels.
b A single specimen was found to be positive for CoV NL63 when tested with the original RP pouch but not the modified RP
pouch. The specimen had previously been identified as positive for B. pertussis and had not been tested for CoV NL63 by the
source laboratory. This specimen previously tested using the original pouch was negative for CoV NL63. There was
insufficient specimen for discrepancy investigation. Low viral load is suspected to have caused this spurious result.
c The Coronavirus OC43 discrepancy was due to cross-reactivity between the OC43 assay and HKU1 virus that was detected in
the RP modified pouch and not in the original RP pouch.
d 2/3 human Metapneumovirus discrepant specimens were confirmed by bi-directional sequence analysis. Low viral load is
suspected to have prevented detection by sequencing for the other specimen.
e 0/7 Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus discrepant specimens were confirmed by bi-directional sequence analysis. Low viral load
is suspected to have prevented detection by sequencing.
f A single specimen containing Influenza A H1-2009 provided repeated equivocal results on the original RP pouch, but was
detected by the modified pouch.
g Parainfluenza Virus 4 was confirmed in both discrepant specimens by bi-directional sequence analysis.
h B. pertussis was confirmed in the discrepant specimen by bi-directional sequence analysis.
To supplement the archived specimen data for low prevalence organisms and to provide
additional Adenovirus performance data specifically for AdVC2 and AdVC6, a set of 44
contrived (spiked NPS) specimens (10 AdVC2, 10 AdVC6, 10 C. pneumoniae, and 14 M.
pneumoniae) was tested with both the modified FilmArray RP and the original FilmArray
RP. The organism status of each contrived specimen was blinded to the users analyzing
the specimens. Modified FilmArray RP detected all 20 Adenovirus-spiked specimens,
while original FilmArray RP detected none of the Adenovirus-spiked specimens.

Modified FilmArray RP also detected another Adenovirus in the background of a
specimen spiked with C. pneumonia that was later confirmed with bidirectional
sequencing. Performance appeared to be equivalent between modified FilmArray RP
and original FilmArray RP for C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae.

a In addition to ten specimens spiked with AdVC6 and ten specimens spiked with AdVC2, modified FilmArray RP also
detected an Adenovirus in the background of one specimen that had been spiked with C. pneumoniae. This detection was
confirmed by bi-directional sequence analysis to be AdVC2.
The Adenoviruses detected in archived specimens were categorized into serotype groups
using bi-directional sequence analysis. Combining the archived and contrived specimen
comparison data demonstrates improved detection of AdVC2, AdVC5, AdVC6, and
AdVE4 by modified FilmArray RP as compared to the original FilmArray RP.

5. Calibration:
Not applicable
6. Quality Control:
The FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) pouch contains two internal control assays:
1. The RNA Process Control targets an mRNA of the yeast, Schizosaccharomyces
pombe. During FilmArray RP pouch manufacture, whole yeast is freeze-dried
into the sample injection port of each pouch. When the test specimen is loaded
into the pouch, S. pombe is rehydrated and enters the pouch with the specimen.
The yeast nucleic acid is extracted, purified and tested simultaneously with
nucleic acids from the patient specimen. A positive result for the processing
control indicates that all steps in the process (nucleic acid extraction, reverse
transcription, PCR, melt, detection, and analysis) are functioning properly.
2. The second stage PCR (PCR2) control assay detects a synthetic DNA template
that is dried into triplicate wells of the array along with the corresponding
primers. A positive result indicates that PCR2 was successful.
The RNA Process Control and the PCR2 Control assays are used to Pass or Fail each
FilmArray RP pouch run. This combination of control assays monitors each of the
critical mechanical and chemical processes that occur in a pouch run, while limiting the
possibility of random control assay failures that could contribute to unnecessary pouch
failures.
Good laboratory practice recommends running external positive and negative controls
regularly. Use viral transport medium as the external Negative Control, and previously
characterized positive samples or negative sample spiked with well characterized target
organisms as external Positive Controls. External controls should be used in accordance
with local, state, federal accrediting organizations, as applicable.
