L. Test Principle:
The method for quantitative determination of 25-OH Vitamin D is a direct, competitive
immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In the first analysis step, the calibrators and patient samples
are diluted with biotin-labeled 25-OH vitamin D and added to microplate wells coated with
monoclonal sheep anti-25-OH Vitamin D antibodies. During the incubation an unknown
amount of 25-OH vitamin D in the patient sample and a known amount of biotin labeled 25-
OH vitamin D compete for the antibody binding sites in the microplate wells plate. Unbound
25-OH vitamin D is removed by washing. For the detection of bound biotin-labeled 25-OH
vitamin D, a second incubation is performed using peroxidase-labeled streptavidin. In a third
incubation using the peroxidase substrate tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) the bound peroxidase
promotes a color reaction. The color intensity is inversely proportional to the 25-OH vitamin
D concentration in the sample. Results for the samples can be calculated directly using a
standard curve.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision/reproducibility of the test was investigated following CLSI standard
EP05-A2. Intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CV) were determined
using 8 natural human serum samples with different concentrations of 25OHD. Two
of the 8 serum samples were spiked to achieve higher levels of 25OHD. The intra-
assay and inter-assay CVs are based on 40 determinations, with inter-assay performed
in 10 different runs over 5 different days (with 4 replicates per run). The following
precision results were obtained:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity of the test was investigated following CLSI standard EP6-A. Sample
preparations were prepared by mixing of natural low patient sample (2 ng/mL) and
high 129 ng/mL patient blood samples to create 9 different inter-mixture
concentrations. The sample preparations covered the concentration range of 2 to 129
ng/mL. All samples were tested in double determinations per sample preparation, the
mean of the two determinations for each sample was calculated and polynomial
regression was performed of observed results vs. expected results. The linear
regression generated was: Y=0.98X – 0.57, r2 = 0.999
Based on the results of the linearity study sponsor claimed that the candidate assay is
linear from 2.0 to 129 ng/mL.
The 25-OHD assay has a measuring range of 4.0 to 120 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
Calibrators and controls are traceable to concentrations determined by UV
spectrophotometric analysis. An in-house stock solution is prepared gravimetrically
by reconstituting a vial of 25-OH vitamin D3 with ethanol. The antigen concentration
of the ethanolic stock is spectrophotometrically calculated using the OD coefficient of
18.2 at 264 nm to calculate the concentration from the absorbance value. The
ethanolic stock of antigen is used to build an intermediate stock volumetrically by
dilution into horse serum based on the spectrophotometric reading of the ethanolic
stock solution. The intermediate stock is used in the manufacturing of lot specific
calibrators and controls volumetrically.
Value assignments
Target ranges for control materials are: C1 (low): 15 ng/mL (10-25 ng/mL) and C2

(high): 40 ng/mL (25-60 ng/mL). Target values are confirmed using two
commercially available devices and a HPLC method. Testing of the controls and
assignment of values involves multiple replicates with multiple operators to generate
a total of 40 values. The mean obtained values are assigned as control values. The
controls are labeled with the assigned values as mean C1±50% and C2±30%.
Calibrator value assignments are based on an internal procedure. The calibrator levels
for each batch are confirmed by running a minimum of eight quality control sera
covering the whole concentration range of the calibration curve measured in multiple
replicates with multiple operators over days. The initial value assignment for
calibrators was performed using two commercially available devices and a HPLC
method. The final calibrators values are then verified & assigned by adjusting their
initial values to meet the specified ranges when tested against the
commerically available assays. Once confirmation of the calibrator values is
established, the new calibrators are tested again in bulk and final. The target ranges of
the calibrators are as follows:
Calibrator 1 = 0 ng/mL, Calibrator 2 = 4 ng/mL, Calibrator 3 = 10 ng/mL,
Calibrator 4 = 25 ng/mL, Calibrator 5 = 60 ng/mL, Calibrator 6 = 120 ng/mL,
Stability
Stability studies were conducted using accelerated stability study. The predicted
shelf-life, based on results of an accelerated testing at 37°C, is at least 12 months at 2-
8°C for the control materials and the calibrators. Real-time stability testing is on-
going to support the predicted shelf-life. Open-vial stability is 3 months when stored
at 2-8°C. Biotin was found to be stable for at least 2 weeks when diluted to working
strength. Stability study protocol has been reviewed and found to be adequate.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantification (LoQ) were
investigated following CLSI standard EP17-A. LoB, LoD, and LoQ studies were
performed with three lots of reagents. LoB was determined using the mean of 60
replicates for calibrator 1 (0 ng/mL) and the mean of 20 replicates for calibrator 2 (4
ng/mL). LoB was found to be 0.54 ng/mL. LoD was determined as the LoB + 1.645
times the standard deviation of 200 determinations from 5 samples in the low range of
2 to 10 ng/mL, measured in 5 independent runs with 8 replicates per run. The mean
LoD was determined to be 2.1 ng/mL. LoQ is defined as the lowest concentration at
which the curve line crosses the 20% CV line and was determined from a plot of the
mean concentrations (X-axis) vs. % CVs (Y-axis). LoQ was determined to be 4.0
ng/mL.
Sponsor claims that the candidate assay has a measuring range of 4.0 to 120 ng/mL.

Interference study:
To investigate the influence from hemoglobin, triglycerides and bilirubin, 3 different
sera at different 25-OH vitamin D concentrations (9 to 76 ng/mL) were spiked with
potential interfering substances and were incubated with the test system according to
the package insert. Non-significant interference is defined as < 10% bias between the
spiked and unspiked sample. No significant interference was observed for
concentrations of up to 750 mg/dL for hemoglobin, 2000 mg/dL for triglyceride, 40
mg/dL for bilirubin, 400 mg/dL for cholesterol, 1000 mg/dL for biotin, and 10.0

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison against the predicate device was performed following CLSI
standard EP09-A2. 240 human serum samples were obtained from different sources
for the method comparison study. The samples, ranging from 4.1 to 119.1 ng/mL,
spanned the claimed measuring range of the candidate assay. To ensure that the tested
concentrations of 25-OH Vitamin D are distributed across the reportable dynamic
range, 36 samples (15%) in the set were spiked to represent difficult to achieve
concentrations between 46.9 – 119.1 ng/mL.
Results of linear regression analysis are shown in the table below.
