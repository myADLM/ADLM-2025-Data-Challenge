on the Dimension Vista® System.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
For Use on Siemens Dimension Vista® systems only.
I. Device Description:
The Dimension Vista® Ammonia (AMM) Flex® reagent cartridge is an in vitro
diagnostic device that consists of prepackaged reagents in a plastic cartridge for use
on the Dimension Vista® System. Flex® reagent cartridges hold reagents for a test
method. Each Dimension Vista® Flex has twelve wells. Each well contains α-
ketoglutarate (10 mmol/L), GLDH (≥ 24 KU/L), NADPH (0.2 mmol/L) as well as
buffers, stabilizers and preservatives. Reagent preparations are performed
automatically on the instrument. A barcode label on the cartridge identifies the test
method, lot number, expiration date and maximum number of tests for which the
cartridge can supply reagent.
The Dimension Vista® Chemistry 3 Calibrator (CHEM 3 CAL) is a two level, liquid
calibrator. It is packaged as a kit of six vials with three vials each of Level A and B,
containing 2.5 mL per vial. The product is a multi-analyte, aqueous product
containing ammonium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate and ethyl alcohol. CAL A is
made by adding preservatives to purified water and CAL B is made by adding the
calculated quantity of ammonium bicarbonate to purified water with preservatives,
along with alcohol and sodium carbonate. This product is sold separately from the
Flex® reagent cartridge.

L. Test Principle:
The Dimension Vista® Ammonia assay (AMM) is an enzymatic method that uses
glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) and a stabilized NADPH analog. Ammonia reacts
with α-ketoglutarate and reduced cofactor to form L-glutamate and the cofactor. The
reaction is catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase. The decrease in absorbance due to
the oxidation of the reduced cofactor is monitored at 340/700 nm and is proportional
to the ammonia concentration.
GLDH
α-ketoglutarate + NH + + reduced cofactor L-glutamate + cofactor + H O

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The following performance data were collected on a Dimension Vista 1500 System.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing was performed in accordance with CLSI EP5-A2. Samples
consisted of three levels of Bio-Rad® Liquichek™ Ethanol/Ammonia Control
and represented clinically relevant ranges of normal and elevated ammonia
levels in plasma. Testing was performed over 20 days, two separate runs with
two test samples for each test material. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
used to evaluate the data consistent with the recommendations of EP5-A2.
The data are summarized in the following table:

Level 2 186 2.3 1.2 3.2 1.7
Level 3 563 3.5 0.6 5.0 0.9
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linear range was determined according to CLSI EP-6A. Linearity testing
was performed using commercial Dimension Vista® CHEM 3 CAL Level B
(high level) and was diluted by sequential mixing with CHEM 3 CAL Level A
(0 calibrator). Seventeen (17) levels were prepared and tested. The observed
values in each case represent the mean of 5 replicates. The range of plasma
samples tested was 0 - 1392 µg/dL. Linear regression results are summarized
below.

0.99 3.74 1.00
Based on the results of this testing and the Limit of Quantitation testing, the
sponsor claims that the measurement range of the ammonia assay is 17 -1277
µg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Ammonia in the CHEM 3 CAL calibrator is traceable to ACS grade
ammonium sulfate by gravimetric method. CO is traceable to NIST SRM
2
351. Ethyl alcohol is traceable to US Pharmacopeia Grade ethyl alcohol.
Stability:
CHEM 3 Calibrator:
Calibrator shelf life is determined in real-time. Protocols and acceptance
criteria were reviewed and determined to be acceptable. The testing supports
the sponsor’s claimed shelf life stability of 12 months when stored at 2-8ºC.
Calibrator open and punctured vial stability are determined in real-time.
Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and determined to be
acceptable. The testing supports the sponsor’s claimed opened vial stability of
30 days when stored at 2-8ºC, and punctured vial stability of 24 hours when
stored on board the Dimension Vista instrument.

Value Assignment:
CHEM 3 CAL calibrator is a two level calibrator product. Calibrator Level A
is a nominal zero calibrator. Calibrator Level B is value assigned using
standard for each analyte.
Ammonia – the assigned values for ammonia ethanol are based on results
from multiple instruments and reagent lots. The ammonia assigned values for
CHEM 3 CAL are the mean of a minimum of 45 replicates per level. Target
ranges for ammonia are 0 ± 15 µg/dL (LoD) for Level A and 1405 ± 43 µg/dL
for Level B.
CO – the assigned values for ethanol are based on results from 3 instruments,
2
3 reagent lots, and 3 sample pools for a total of 9 test runs. Each run generates
5 replicates per calibrator level; 45 total replicates per level. The CO assigned
2
values for CHEM 3 CAL are the mean of a minimum of 30 replicates per
level. Target ranges for CO are 0 ± 5 mmol/L for Level A and 46 – 53
2
mmol/L for Level B.
Ethyl Alcohol – the assigned values for ethanol are based on results from 3
instruments, 3 reagent lots, and 3 sample pools for a total of 9 runs. Each run
generates 5 replicates per calibrator level; 45 total replicates per level. The
ethyl alcohol assigned values for CHEM 3 CAL Levels A and B are the mean
of a minimum of 30 replicates per level. Target ranges for ethanol are 0 ± 3
mg/dL for Level A and 307- 322 mg/dL for Level B.
d. Detection limit:
The LoB, LoD, and LoQ were evaluated in accordance with CLSI EP17-A.
LoQ is defined as the value where inter-assay imprecision <20% CV. The
table below summarizes the protocol and provides the value for each limit.

e. Analytical specificity:
The AMM method was evaluated for interference according to CLSI EP7-A2
guideline. Bias is the difference in the results between the control sample
(without the interferent) and the test sample (contains the interferent)
expressed in percent. Bias exceeding 10% is considered significant
interference. Testing was performed with two ammonia levels (85 and 426
µg/dL). The following substances do not cause significant interference (>10%
bias) with the AMM method when present in serum at the concentrations
indicated.

The sponsor has the following limitations stated in the package insert:
Do not use hemolyzed samples. Bilirubin (conjugated) at 60 mg/dL decreases
ammonia results by 16% at ammonia concentration of 85 µg/dL. Lipemia
(Intralipid) at 50 mg/dL increases ammonia results by 13% at ammonia
concentration of 85 µg/dL.
For some endogenous substances, the sponsor performed a dose-response
study to evaluate interference using real patient sample pools that contained
the interference substances. Non-significant interference was defined by
having the observed recovery within 10% of expected value. The following

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed between the Siemens Dimension
Vista® Ammonia (AMM) assay and the predicate Siemens Dimension®
Ammonia (AMON) method following the CLSI EP9-A2 guideline.
For this study, 100 excess, de-identified lithium heparin plasma samples
containing measurable amounts of ammonia and were purchased from
multiple vendors as well as supplemented by normal samples collected in-
house and tested at an internal site. Samples were run in duplicate and the first
replicate was used in the data analysis. The range of ammonia values in the
comparison study was 19 - 1273 µg/dL. Least squares linear regression was
performed and the results of the regression are summarized below.
