2. Indication(s) for use:
The FastPackControl Kit is an assayed quality control for the verification of the
accuracy and precision of the FastPackSystem and FastPack IP Systems when
used for the quantitative determination of the analytes listed in the package insert.
The following analytes are included in the package insert:
- Free Thyroxine (FT4)
- Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG)
- Testosterone
- Total Prostate Specific Antigen (tPSA)
- Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For in vitro diagnostic use.
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
FastPack System
I. Device Description:
The FastPack Control Kit consists of a low and high control. Each control is prepared
from bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the primary protein source and to provide a
viscosity similar to human serum. Other components added include constituents of
human origin, stabilizers, inhibitors, and preservatives. Added analyte materials
(hCG, TSH, FT4, Testosterone, and PSA) are purchased commercially. The controls
are supplied in ready to use liquid form and packaged in a 5 mL bottle each.
All human source materials were tested and found to be negative for, HIV ½, HBV,
and HCV using FDA approved methods.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced
L. Test Principle:
Not applicable
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The analytes contained in the FastPack Control Kit were obtained from
commercially available sources and are traceable to commercially available
standards.
Stability
Shelf-life and open-vial stability protocols and acceptance criteria were
reviewed and found to be acceptable. The closed vial (shelf-life) stability
claim at the recommended storage temperature of 2 to 8 °C is 18 months
based on ongoing real-time studies. The opened vial stability claim at the
recommended storage temperature of 2 to 8 °C is 120 days based on real time
data.
Value Assignment
Values are assigned to the calibrators based on replicate analysis using six
FastPack analyzers, three reagent lots, and two calibrations. The sponsor
calculates a range based on ± 3 standard deviations from the mean for each
level for each analyte, but states that each laboratory should establish their
own acceptable ranges.
