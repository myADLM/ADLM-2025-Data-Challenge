L. Test Principle:
Sodium, Potassium and Chloride are measured using ion-selective electrodes utilizing
an indirect (diluted) method where urine samples are automatically diluted at 1:46
ratio using ISE diluent. Each of the electrodes (Sodium, Potassium and Chloride) has
membrane with an open liquid junction that is ion-selective. The reference electrode
uses the same design of the ion-electrodes and it is exclusively used as a reference for
every measurement. The difference of all voltages between the reference electrode
and any ion-selective electrode is a measure for the concentration of individual ions.
For every test, the voltages of both ISE internal standard and diluted sample solution
are measured for each type of ions (Sodium, Potassium and Chloride). The
measurement of all electrodes is performed in parallel. The resulting voltages are
converted into operator readable results.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed using human urine samples and control
material. Within-run precision was determined using 21 replicates for each
sample type (3 urine samples and 2 controls) by one operator on one
instrument. Total precision was determined using 3 samples (Low, Medium
and High) over 21 days in 2 runs with one operator on one instrument. The
following results were obtained:

The results of the study support the sponsor’s claims that the urine Sodium is
linear from 60 - 350 mmol/L, urine Potassium is linear from 3-100 mmol/L, and
urine Chloride is linear form 60-350 mmol/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Aqueous ISE standard calibrators (S1, S2, and S3) were previously cleared
under k053165 and ISE Compensator (calibrator) under k052193. The ISE
Compensator is traceable to Flame Photometry (Sodium, Potassium) and
Coulometry (Chloride).
d. Detection limit:
Studies were carried out in accordance with CLSI Guidance Document EP17-
A for Sodium, Potassium and Chloride analytes. For determination of LoB
one analyte free sample was measured in 5 replicates, 6 runs, 3 days, on 2
cobas 8000 ISE analyzers. Total of 60 measurements were obtained per
analyzer. For determination of LoD, five samples (one replicate) with low-
analyte concentration were measured in 6 runs for 3 days on 2 cobas 8000 ISE
analyzer modules. In total 60 measurements were obtained per analyzer. For
LoQ studies a low level sample set was prepared by diluting 3 human urine
samples with an analyte free diluent (ISE Diluent). The low level sample set
was tested in single replicate for 3 days in 2 runs per day on two cobas 8000
ISE analyzers. LoQ is defined as the concentration where total error is less
than 20%. Results from the detection limit studies are summarized in the table
below:

e. Analytical specificity:
Urine interference studies were performed in according to CLSI EP7-A2 for
sodium, potassium, and chloride analytes using 2 levels of analytes (normal
and abnormal). The effect of pH (3.8 – 8.2), total protein (14 – 280 mg/L), and
hemoglobin (0 – 1,000 mg/dL) on analyte recovery was evaluated in these
studies. Different concentrations of potential interference substances were
spiked into pooled urine samples. The sponsor’s definitions of non-significant
interference is <10% difference between the spiked and unspiked samples.
There was no significant interference for sodium, potassium, and chloride
