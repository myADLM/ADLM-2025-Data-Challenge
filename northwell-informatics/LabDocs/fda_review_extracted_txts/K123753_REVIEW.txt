Abbott m2000rt: amplification reaction and detection
I. Device Description:
The IMDx VanR for Abbott m2000 assay is a qualitative, real-time PCR-based assay that
targets regions unique to the vancomycin-resistance genes vanA and vanB. These resistance
genes may be associated with the presence of vancomycin resistant Enterococcus (VRE).
Specimen preparation and reagent mixing occurs on the Abbott m2000sp instrument, while
amplification and detection occurs on the Abbott m2000rt instrument. The Abbott m2000rt
application software (v1.8) monitors the fluorescence emitted by each fluorescent probe,
interprets all data, and provides a final result at the end of the cycling program.
Differentiation of vanA from vanB is achieved by labeling the oligonucleotide probes with
different colored fluorescent dyes.
A specimen processing control is introduced into each specimen during the sample
extraction. This control is co-extracted with the specimen and co-amplified in the same PCR
reaction as the vanA and vanB targets and serves to demonstrate that the entire assay process
has proceeded within specification. Positive and negative controls are included with each run
to ensure the integrity of the system.

L. Test Principle:
The IMDx VanR for Abbott m2000 assay is a qualitative, in vitro diagnostic assay containing
reagents for the real-time PCR amplification, detection, and differentiation of nucleic acids
from organisms harboring vanA or vanB genes. Detection of the vanA and vanB genes is
measured by the presence of fluorescently-labeled oligonucleotide probes that generate a
fluorescent signal when specifically bound to amplified vanA and/or vanB PCR products;
differentiation of vanA from vanB is attained by labeling the oligonucleotide probes with
different colored fluorescent dyes. The IMDx VanR for Abbott m2000 assay includes
inactivated bacteria as a full process control; this inactivated bacteria is unrelated to
enterococci and introduced into each specimen during sample preparation such that it is co-
extracted and co-amplified with each specimen. This full process control serves to
demonstrate that the entire assay process has proceeded within specification for individual
specimens. The Abbott m2000 system consists of two instruments: the Abbott m2000sp (for
sample preparation) and the Abbott m2000rt (for real-time PCR amplification and detection).
The assay is intended to be used directly on rectal swab, peri-rectal swab, or stool specimens
collected from patients to aid in the control of Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus (VRE).
Rectal swab, peri-rectal swab, or stool specimens are initially subjected to sample preparation
on the Abbott m2000sp, an automated sample preparation system. Sample preparation lyses
bacteria present in the sample, including any VRE, to make the vanA and vanB target nucleic
acids accessible for amplification and to remove potential amplification inhibitors. At the
completion of the sample processing procedure, the resulting bacterial lysate is transferred to
an Abbott 96-Deep-Well. The Abbott m2000sp also combines the IMDx VanR for Abbott
m2000 Amplification Reagent components and dispenses the resulting Master Mix into the
Abbott 96-Well Optical Reaction Plate. After manual application of the Abbott Optical
Adhesive Cover, the plate is ready for transfer to the Abbott m2000rt.

Amplification/detection takes place on the Abbott m2000rt instrument using real-time PCR
techniques; during each round of PCR amplification the fluorescent probes anneal to the
amplified target DNA, if present. The probes are labeled with different fluorescent
molecules allowing vanA, vanB and the IMDx Process Control-A targets to be distinguished
from each other. The probes are single-stranded, linear DNA oligonucleotides modified with
a fluorescent moiety covalently linked to one end of the probe and a quenching moiety to the
other end. When the probe binds to its complementary sequence in the target during
amplification, the fluorophore separates from the quenchers, thus allowing fluorescent
emission and detection. Since this fluorescence occurs during every cycle, the PCR reaction
can be read in real-time. Positive and negative controls are included with each run to ensure
the integrity of the system.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Assay precision was measured in four independent studies:
· within-laboratory repeatability;
· user-to-user reproducibility;
· lot-to-lot reproducibility, and
· instrument-to-instrument reproducibility.
A seven-member precision panel was comprised of intact organisms from two VRE
strains: E. faecium (ATCC BAA-2320; vanA-type) and E.faecalis (ATCC 700802;
vanB-type). Each strain was formulated at three target levels:
i. positive (corresponding to a concentration associated with ~2-3x LoD),
ii. low positive (1x LoD), and
iii. high negative (~0.05-0.25x LoD, an estimation of a 20 to 80% positivity rate).
Panel members were made using TE Buffer plus fecal matrix to simulate clinical
specimens. The target LoD value used for this study was 944 CFU/mL (2435
CFU/swab) for ATCC BAA-2320 and 644 CFU/mL (1610 CFU/swab) for ATCC
700802. The seventh panel member was a true negative sample that contained TE
Buffer plus fecal matrix alone, without any VRE organisms added.
Within-Laboratory Repeatability
For the repeatability study, the seven-member panel was tested twice a day for a total
of twelve days. Panel members were tested in replicates of three for each run (for a
total of 504 data points for the 24 runs). The entire study was conducted by one
technician using one instrument pair (m2000sp and m2000rt) and one reagent lot of
the IMDx VanR for Abbott m2000 assay. The average, standard deviation, and

User-to-User Reproducibility
For the reproducibility study the panel members were randomized and blinded. Each
panel member was tested in replicates of three, twice a day for five days, at three
study sites, by two technologists at each site for a total of 30 experimental runs; each
operator performed one run each day. The entire study was conducted using one
instrument system (m2000sp and m2000rt) at each site and one reagent lot of the
IMDx VanR for Abbott m2000 assay. The expected results and percent agreement at
each site, as well as the overall agreement were reported as follows:

To measure m2000rt variability, a single m2000sp instrument was used in one
experiment. Six replicates of each panel member were prepared. The eluted nucleic
acids from the sample extractions were automatically transferred to an Abbott 96-
well Deep Well Plate by the m2000sp per normal operational procedures. Aliquots
from one deep well plate were then used to assemble three separate, identical Abbott
96-well Optical Reaction Plates, using the same lot of the IMDx VanR for Abbott
m2000 assay. Each of the three identical Abbott 96-Well Optical Reaction plates
were then run on three separate Abbott m2000rt instruments, by the same operator.

Negative samples showed an overall negativity rate of 100%; no false positive results
were observed. High Negative samples were expected to provide a negativity rate of
20–80%; the overall observed negativity rate was 46%. Low Positive samples were
expected to provide a positivity rate of ≥95%; the overall observed positivity rate was
96%. Positive samples were expected to provide a positivity rate of 100%; the
overall observed positivity rate was 99%. There were two (2) false negative samples
out of all samples tested. The IMDx VanR for Abbott m2000 assay provided
reproducible results.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The IMDx Process Control-A is composed of inactivated Gram-positive bacteria
unrelated to vancomycin-resistant enterococci and is introduced into each sample
during specimen processing; therefore, an IMDx Process Control-A result is
generated with each specimen result. Positive and negative Quality Controls are run
with each IMDx VanR for Abbott m2000 assay run.
Of the 1,506 specimens enrolled in the clinical study, 45 (3.0%) “Error Message”
results caused retesting: (i) A positive control run failure invalidated 30 stool
samples; upon retesting all but one of the 30 samples produced a valid result. The
one sample not producing a valid result was invalidated due to the internal control
being non-reactive during repeat testing (e.g. PCR inhibition). (ii) One additional
stool sample was invalidated due to the internal control being outside the validity
range for the initial and repeat test (again, PCR inhibition). (iii) The remaining 14
samples (two peri-rectal specimens and 12 stool specimens) were invalidated due to a
mechanical error arising in the m2000sp. These errors were related to an issue with
the instrument Liquid Handling/Liquid Sensing system, and all these errors were

encountered in two runs: a single run at one site and a single run at a second site.
In summary, there were 31 (2.1%) instances where the assay controls failed; there
were 14 (0.9%) instances where the instrument invalidated the assay. The rate of
failure was not excessive; the assay control strategy adequately evaluated the integrity
of the result.
Specimen Stability Studies
The following sample/swab types were tested:
· Bacti-Swabs with Amies transport media (Remel, Cat# R723095);
· E-swabs with liquid Amies media (Becton Dickinson (BD), Cat# 220245);
· BBL culture swabs with liquid Stuart media (BD, Cat# 220099), and
· Raw stool was sampled with Copan flocked swab (Copan, Cat# 502CS01).
The data provided support to show that each specimen type was stable when
stored under the following conditions
· 30 days at -30°C to -10°C, or
· 7 days at 2°C to 8°C.
· Specimens were also stable for 3 freeze thaw cycles.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) of the IMDx VanR for Abbott m2000 assay was
determined using six strains of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (four vanA-type and
two vanB-type). Each strain was tested in replicates of twenty with three lots of the
IMDx VanR for Abbott m2000 assay. Combined results for the three lots were used
for probit analysis and calculation of confidence intervals at the 95% level (95% CI).
A swab equivalency study was performed to confirm that simulated samples
containing fecal matrix used in the LoD studies were equivalent to rectal/stool
specimens.

The LoD for vanA-type VRE was determined to be:
· 4,300.6 CFU/swab.
The LoD for vanB-type VRE was determined to be:
· 1,610 CFU/swab.
Analytical Reactivity
Ninety-one (91) characterized VRE strains and/or clinical isolates (43 vanA-type, 45
vanB-type, and three VRE that had multiple vancomycin resistance elements) were
tested for reactivity with the IMDx VanR for Abbott m2000 assay. Strains originated
from at least twelve states in the US, and six countries (USA, Canada, Chile, Italy,
Germany, Belgium). Each strain was diluted in TE Buffer plus fecal matrix at 2-3X
LoD; three replicates were tested. Most strains were detected by the assay,
demonstrating that the IMDx VanR Assay for Abbott m2000 can detect a broad range
of both vanA-type and vanB-type VRE strains.

§These isolates could only be detected when the strain was tested at a higher concentration than the calculated LoD.
*While vanA was detected at the calculated LoD, the vanB target could only be detected when the strain was tested at a
higher concentration.
While the vast majority of these isolates could be detected at the defined LOD, there
was one vanA isolate and six vanB isolates that required higher input loads in order to
be detected (i.e., they were not initially detected at the 2-3X of the respective LoDs).
The following isolates, and the load required to achieve detection, are shown in the
table below. For one vanA+vanB, double-positive strain (MMCI-60), the vanB gene
was present in significantly lower copy number than the vanA gene, such that the
vanB target could only be detected when the strain was tested at a significantly higher
concentration. All eight of these isolates originated in the United States.

enterococci strains did not react with the IMDx VanR for Abbott m2000 assay at a
concentration of ≥1 × 106 CFU/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity was performed using a panel of 96 test organisms to evaluate any
cross-reactivity with the IMDx VanR for Abbott m2000 assay. Bacteria were tested
from fresh cultures at a concentration of ≥1 × 106 CFU/mL. Viruses were tested from
frozen stocks at a concentration of ≥1 × 105 TCID50/mL. Nucleic acids were tested
at genomic equivalents ≥1 × 106 CFU/mL for bacteria, and ≥1 × 105 TCID50/mL for
viruses. All samples were prepared by diluting organisms or DNA into TE Buffer
plus fecal matrix. No cross-reactivity was detected with any of the 96 test organisms
included in this panel.

These VRE strains were present in the samples at a concentration corresponding to 2 -
3x LoD. Each of the four strains was tested in the presence of each test organism in
triplicate using the IMDx VanR for Abbott m2000 assay. No evidence of microbial
interference was observed for any of the 96 test organisms included in the analysis.
Vancomycin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) testing
To examine whether vanA gene sequences in VRSA could be detected by the IMDx
VanR for Abbott m2000 assay, twelve VRSA isolates (all were vanA-type) from the
Network on Antimicrobial Resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (NARSA) were
tested. These included: VRS1, VRS2, VRS3a, VRS4, VRS5, VRS6, VRS7, VRS8,
VRS9, VRS10, VRS11a, and VRS11b. Titered stocks were diluted to 1 x 106
CFU/mL and tested with the IMDx VanR for Abbott m2000 assay in triplicate. The
vanA gene was detected in all strains. The vanB gene was not detected in any of the
strains; however, as expected the IMDx VanR for Abbott m2000 assay may produce
positive results if S. aureus organisms harboring these genes are present in the clinical
specimen.
Potentially Interfering Substances
To evaluate the potential of substances typically found in fecal specimens to interfere
with the IMDx VanR for Abbott m2000 assay, four strains of VRE were tested in the
presence of such substances. The VRE strains used included:
· vanA-type
o E. faecium strain MMC4,
o E. faecium strain ATCC BAA-2320,
· vanB-type
o E. faecalis strain V583, and
o E. faecalis strain ATCC 51575.
These test organisms were diluted to a concentration of 2 - 3x LoD using TE Buffer
plus fecal matrix. The test panel consisted of 23 substances shown in the table below:

Substances were diluted in TE Buffer plus fecal matrix to concentrations that would
either replicate or exceed the highest concentration expected to be found in a clinical
sample. Each of the four VRE strains was tested in triplicate at 2 - 3x LoD in the
presence of each substance. No interference was observed with any of the substances
tested.
Target Carryover Study
Six assay runs were performed with alternating high positive and negative samples to
assess the potential for cross-over or carryover contamination. No vanA or vanB
target was detected in any of the 269 negative samples tested.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off for the IMDx VanR for Abbott m2000 assay was determined using
Abbott’s proprietary maxRatio algorithm for real-time PCR data analysis. The
maxRatio method identifies a consistent point within or very near the exponential
region of the PCR signal. Compared to other analysis techniques that generate only a
cycle number, the maxRatio method generates several measurements of amplification
including cycle numbers (CN), relative measures of amplification efficiency and
curve shape. By using these values, the maxRatio method can achieve a highly
reliable reactive/nonreactive determination along with quantitative evaluation. For a
result to be considered reactive, the fluorescence generated must cross a reactive
threshold value (reactive threshold settings are based on “maxRatio values”). Initial

3. Clinical studies:
The performance of the IMDx VanR for Abbott m2000 assay was evaluated using an IRB
approved protocol at five geographically diverse locations within the United States. The
reference method consisted of direct culture complemented by enriched culture. All samples
were first inoculated onto Bile Esculin agar with 6 μg/mL vancomycin (BEAV) and
incubated at 35 ± 2°C for 24 and 48 hours. Presumptive colonies of Enterococcus were
subcultured for isolation on a TSA with 5% Sheep’s Blood and incubated for 18-24 hours at
35 ± 2°C. Colonies presumptive for Enterococcus were Gram Stained; Gram-positive cocci
were tested for Catalase and pyrrolidonyl arylamidase (PYR). Gram-positive cocci that were
catalase negative and PYR positive were further identified using an FDA cleared method and
susceptibility to vancomycin determined using an FDA cleared test. Final confirmation as
either vancomycin resistant E. faecium (VRE ) or E. faecalis (VRE ) was based on
fm fs
biochemical identification and vancomycin susceptibility at ≥32 μg/mL. The presence of
vanA and/or vanB gene sequences in isolated VRE or VRE was confirmed by alternative
fm fs
PCR.
A total of 1,506 specimens were entered in the study. Six specimens were withdrawn due to
protocol deviations, and one specimen was withdrawn due to an unresolved instrument error.
The remaining 1,500 specimens comprised 469 stool specimens, 444 rectal swabs, and 587
peri-rectal swabs. Among prospectively collected stool, rectal, and peri-rectal specimens, the
reference method isolated 69, 63, and 50 VRE, respectively, while the IMDx VanR for
Abbott m2000 assay yielded 117, 89, and 80 positive results, respectively. The analyses in

the tables below report the performance of the the IMDx VanR for Abbott m2000 assay in
this clinical study. The VRE isolated included: E. casseliflavus, E. faecalis, E. faecium, E.
gallinarum, E. hirae, E. raffinosus, as well as eight enterococci that could not be speciated.
The majority of the isolates were E. faecalis and E. faecium; the latter comprised
approximately three-quarters of the VRE isolates.
In addition, 45 suspected vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis rectal swab specimens
were run retrospectively at a single site. One (1) specimen was withdrawn when organism
identification could not be confirmed by reference methods. Therefore, a total of 44
specimens had reportable results. Among these retrospectively collected specimens, the
IMDx VanR for Abbott m2000 assay yielded 44 positive results, while the reference method
yielded 42 VRE.

N. Instrument Name:
Abbott m2000 System running Application Software v.1.8:
· Abbott m2000sp: sample preparation and reagent mixing
· Abbott m2000rt: amplification reaction and detection
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Abbott m2000 System is an instrument platform that automates steps to perform
nucleic acid amplification assays from sample processing through amplification,
detection, and data reduction. The Abbott m2000 System comprises the m2000sp and
m2000rt instruments, which are operated with separate System Control Center (SCC)
workstations. Each instrument contains an independent software application; one for the
m2000sp and a second for the m2000rt. The m2000sp instrument is a floor standing,
automated sample preparation system. The m2000rt instrument is a real-time PCR
thermal cycler/reader instrument system. Abbott Molecular is the manufacturer of the
m2000 System. The principal hardware components that comprise the m2000sp and
m2000rt were developed by Original Equipment Manufacturer vendors, Tecan Schweiz
AG, Mannedorf, Switzerland, and Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, respectively.
Abbott Molecular developed the software that is uniquely for use with the m2000 System.
The Abbott m2000 System software processes sample preparation and
amplification/detection protocols based on pre-determined, assay-specific parameters that
are contained in individual assay application specification (App Spec) files that are
installed on the SCC. The Abbott m2000sp reads and processes bar coded primary
sample tubes and processes up to 96 specimens, controls, and calibrators in batch mode.
The m2000 System is capable of processing samples from various matrices, depending on
the specific assay application. At the completion of the automated sample preparation
protocol, the operator seals and manually transfers the PCR plate to the Abbott m2000rt

for nucleic acid detection. Bar code and m2000sp data is transferred to the m2000rt
electronically via removable media (i.e., a CD).
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identification occurs on the Abbott m2000sp instrument when it is loaded with
specimen tubes.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Fresh or frozen human peri-rectal or rectal swabs collected and transported to the
laboratory are used for testing. Fresh or frozen human stool samples collected and
transported to the laboratory in a sterile container and sampled with a sterile, nylon
flocked swab are used for testing. Specimen processing is automated on the Abbott
m2000sp.
5. Calibration:
There is no calibration procedure associated with the IMDx VanR for Abbott m2000
assay per se. Optical calibration of the Abbott m2000rt instrument is required for the
accurate measurement and discrimination of dye fluorescence during the IMDx VanR for
Abbott m2000 assay; the Calibration Procedures section in the Abbott m2000rt
Operations Manual describes how to perform an optical calibration.
