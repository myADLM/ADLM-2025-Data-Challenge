anti-myoglobin antibodies which have been sensitized to latex particles, agglutination
occurs. This agglutination is detected as an absorbance change (570 nm), with the
magnitude of the change being proportional to the quantity of myoglobin in the
sample. The actual concentration is then determined by the interpolation from a
calibration curve prepared from calibrators of known concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Performance characteristics were established on the Hitachi 917 analyzer
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the Diazyme Myoglobin Assay was evaluated following
CLSI guidance document EP5-A2. Three levels of Myoglobin serum controls
and three levels of serum specimens were tested in duplicate for 2 runs per day
over 20 working days. One lot of reagent was used for this study.
Within-run and total precision are presented in the table below.

Serum 3 20 414 19.7 4.80 21.8 5.3
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The claimed measuring range of the Diazyme Myoglobin assay is 13.2 to
615.9 ng/mL. Eleven levels of samples were prepared by diluting a serum-
based sample with a high level of spiked Myoglobin with saline according to
CLSI EP6-A to produce linearity samples ranging from 10.11 to 623.8 ng/mL.
The linearity samples were tested in triplicate using 1 lot of Diazyme
Myoglobin reagent.
Linear regression analysis provided the following fit equation for a graph of the
observed (y-axis) vs expected (x-axis) myoglobin concentrations: slope =
0.9798, intercept = -5.1076, r2 = 0.9983. Percent Error for each of the dilutions
is shown below:

To test for High Dose “Hook Effect”, a dilution series of 20 samples,
ranging from 260 to 49260 ng/mL was prepared from spiked serum
samples. The samples were tested in triplicate using 1 lot of Diazyme
Myoglobin assay, and showed that no High Dose “Hook Effect” occurred
up to 15000 ng/mL of Myoglobin.
A sample dilution study was performed to demonstrate that manual 1:1 dilution
of serum samples exceeding 615.9 ng/mL with saline results in accurate
myoglobin value determination. Three samples were analyzed in triplicate,
undiluted and diluted, on the Diazyme Myoglobin assay and percent recovery
of the diluted samples was determined. The study indicates that samples up to
849.07 ng/mL may be accurately determined by 1:1 dilution with saline prior to
analysis.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Diazyme Myoglobin Calibration Stability:
Myoglobin assay calibration stability was assessed, and the sponsor claims that
calibration is stable for 28 days. The protocol and acceptance criteria have been
provided and were found to be adequate to support the sponsor’s claims.
Calibrator Traceability and value assignment:
The calibrators for the Diazyme Myoglobin Assay are traceable to a
commercially available, FDA cleared assay, and were prepared by spiking
Myoglobin stock solution into a diluted human serum to the target
concentrations. Value assignment of the myoglobin calibrators was established
by transferring the target values from the predicate method to the in-house

master calibrators.
Control value assignment:
Myoglobin controls are prepared by spiking Myoglobin stock solution to
diluted pooled human serum to the target Myoglobin concentrations. Diazyme
Myoglobin reagents and calibrators were used in replicate analysis to
determine the mean value of the control materials. Target values for
Myoglobin level I and II controls are 50 ng/mL and 330 ng/mL, respectively.
Lot specific target ranges are provided in the value assignment sheet.
Control Stability:
Real time stability testing demonstrated that the Diazyme Myoglobin controls
were stable for 6 months at 2-8°C. Real time stability studies are on- going.
Open vial stability testing at 2-8°C showed that calibrators are stable for at least
3 months after opening. Open vial stability studies are ongoing.
Calibrator Stability:
Real time stability testing demonstrated that the Diazyme Myoglobin
calibrators were stable for 6 months at 2-°C. Real time stability studies are
on- going.
Open vial stability testing at 2-8°C showed that calibrators are stable for at
least 3 months after opening. Open vial stability studies are ongoing.
Stability study protocols and acceptance criteria have been provided and
found to be adequate to support the sponsor’s claims.
d. Detection limit:
The LoB, LoD, and LoQ of the Diazyme Myoglobin Assay were determined
according to CLSI EP17-A. LoB tests were conducted using blank samples
(7.5% BSA) tested with 60 replicates with one reagent lot and one instrument.
th th
LoB, calculated as the mean of the 57 and 58 highest blank values was
determined to be 4.4 ng/mL.
For LoD studies, five low, diluted serum samples were tested with 4
replicates, in each of 3 runs, with one reagent lot and one instrument. The
LOD was calculated as the LOB + (1.645 * SD of LOD samples). The LoD
was determined to be 8.2 ng/mL.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) determination was based on interassay precision
of ≤20% for 8 replicate measurements of 5 low serum samples, per day for 5
days, using 1 lot of Diazyme Myoglobin reagent and 1 instrument. The LoQ
was determined to be 13.23 ng/mL for the Diazyme Myoglobin assay.

e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor evaluated the effect of known endogenous interferents on the
Diazyme Myoglobin assay following Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute EP7-A guidelines.
Two serum samples, with normal and high levels of Myoglobin (50 and 275
ng/mL), were spiked with various concentrations of endogenous substances
at four levels, or therapeutic drugs at 1 level, and the results were compared
to the samples without added interferent. The samples were tested using one
lot of reagent and one instrument. The following substances showed no
significant interference as defined by the sponsor as less than 10% deviation
when tested at levels equal to the concentrations listed below:
Interferent Concentration
Triglyceride 1000 mg/dL
Ascorbic Acid 176 mg/dL
Bilirubin 40 mg/dL
Bilirubin Conjugated 40 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 1000 mg/dL
Rheumatoid Factor 100 IU/mL
Heparin 1.5 IU/mL
N-acetylcysteine 11.04 mM
Acetylsalicylic Acid 2.78 mM

Metronidazole 701 µM
Rifampicin 78.1 µM
Theophylline 222 µM
Phenylbutazone 650 µM

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method Comparison of the Diazyme Myoglobin Assay versus the predicate
assay was performed according to CLSI guidance document EP9-A2. Fifty-
seven unaltered lithium heparin plasma samples and 9 altered lithium heparin
plasma samples, ranging from 16.9 to 478.0 ng/mL, were tested in singlicate
on the predicate and subject devices, using 1 lot of Myoglobin reagent.
Deming regression analysis of a plot of the calculated concentrations from the
Diazyme Myoglobin Assay (Y-axis) versus the predicate device (X-axis)
produced an equation of Y = 0.959X – 5.141, r2 = 0.9855. The 95% CI for
slope and intercept are 0.930 to 0.988 and – 10.16 to - 0.12, respectively.
b. Matrix comparison:
Matrix comparison studies were completed by analyzing 40 paired Serum,
EDTA plasma and Lithium Heparin plasma samples in singlicate using 1 lot of
the Diazyme Myoglobin Assay. The samples had serum myoglobin values
ranging from 25.35 to 509.07 ng/mL, and 4 were spiked with myoglobin.
Linear regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between
plasma and serum samples. For serum vs. K3 EDTA, the linear regression
equation was y = 0.9829x – 2.865, r2 = 0.9949. For serum vs. Lithium heparin
plasma, the linear regression equation was y = 0.9999x + 2.6558, r2 = 0.9978.
The sponsor concluded that Lithium heparin plasma and EDTA plasma are
acceptable anti-coagulants to be used with the Diazyme Myoglobin assay.
