2. Indication(s) for use:
The Psychemedics Microplate EIA for Oxycodone is an enzyme immunoassay (EIA)
for the preliminary qualitative detection of oxycodone in human head and body hair
using a oxycodone calibrator at 2 ng /10 mg hair cutoff for the purpose of identifying
oxycodone use. This is an in vitro diagnostic device intended exclusively for
Psychemedics use only and is not intended for sale to anyone.
The Psychemedics Microplate EIA for oxycodone assay provides only a
preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative chemical method
must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas or Liquid
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS or LC/MS or LC/MS/MS) is the
preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment
should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the
preliminary result is positive.
Psychemedics plans to perform this test at one site. Psychemedics has not
performed an evaluation of reproducibility at different sites.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
This assay is for over the counter use.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The device is for use with a microplate reader capable of measuring at 450 and
650 nm. Plate washing also requires an instrument specifically designed to
effectively and reproducibly wash all wells uniformly.
I. Device Description:
The test consists of two parts; a pre-analytical hair treatment procedure (to convert
the solid matrix of hair to a measurable liquid matrix) and the screening assay, the
Psychemedics Microplate EIA for Oxycodone. The drug is recovered from the hair
using a patented method. The screening portion of the test system consists of (1)
microplate wells coated with multiple drugs including oxycodone conjugated to
bovine serum albumin (BSA), polyclonal rabbit anti-oxycodone,goat anti-rabbit
secondary antibody conjugated to HRP (horseradish peroxidase), substrate [3, 3’, 5,
5’ tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)], HCl to acidify the final reaction, and wash buffer
for washing the plates. Absorbance in the wells is read with a microplate reader.

Test Principle EIA RIA
K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Draft Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff: “Premarket Submission and Labeling
Recommendations for Drug of Abuse Screening Tests,” Issued on December 2, 2003.
L. Test Principle:
Hair sample extracts and primary antibody are combined in the wells and incubated.
After washing, secondary antibody-HRP is added and incubated. After washing,
substrate is added, and, after a final incubation, the wells are acidified and read with
the microplate reader. Results are normalized by expression as B/B0 x 100. If
morphine or related opiates are present in the sample, less primary antibody will be
bound to the solid-phase antigen, thereby resulting in less binding of HRP-labeled
secondary antibody; the absorbance produced is inversely proportional to the amount
of opiates in the sample (specimen, calibrator or control).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed by taking calibrator and control materials, to
prepare spike solutions of negative head and body hair samples at the
following concentrations; negative, ±75%, ±50%, ±25% and 100% of the
cutoff. The concentration of each sample was confirmed by LC/MS/MS.
Intra-assay precision was performed in one run, 15 replicates and inter-assay
precision was performed once a day over 5 non-consecutive days.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Psychemedics manufactures calibrators and control materials using drug
stocks purchased from a commercial vendor. Each lot of drug is received with
its specific certificate of analysis. The commercially obtained stock is made
into the calibrators and controls to the desired concentrations. The
concentrations are confirmed by LC/MS/MS.
Stability studies for both controls and calibrators have been conducted.
Protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable.
The manufacturer claims the following expiration date for both controls and
calibrators:
When stored at less than or equal to -20 ºC for calibrators and -10 ºC for quality
controls the product is stable for 12 months.
d. Detection limit:
Not required since this is a qualitative test
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was established by spiking various concentrations of each
substance into drug-free head and body samples and evaluating the result
against the cutoff control.
Results are expressed as a concentration of compound required to produce a
response approximately equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the assay.
The results are presented in the table below:

compound (pg/mg) Equivalent to reactivity

Cosmetic Treatment
Tests were performed to determine the effects of various head hair treatments
(i.e. bleaching, dyeing, relaxer, shampoo, permanent) on samples tested using
the Psychemedics Microplate EIA for oxycodone. The ethnic origin, hair color
and curvature were documented.
Effects on Positive Samples:
71 specimens determined to be positive for oxycodone were used in the study.
The study was conducted with two different hair treatments. Six to eight
different hair samples were used for each hair treatment. ELSIA absorbance
readings before and after treatment were compared. All samples determined to
be positive prior to treatment remained positive post treatment.
Effect on Negative Samples:
One hundred specimens previously determined to be negative were used in the
study. The study was conducted with two different hair treatments. Ten
different hair samples were used for each hair treatment. ELSIA absorbance
readings before and after treatment were compared. All samples determined to
be negative prior to treatment remained negative post treatment.
Environmental Study
Preliminary positive head and body hair sample results by the screening
method could be due to environmental contamination. All positive should be
sent for confirmation testing on a reference method to distinguish between
true positive and those samples that were positive due to external exposure.
f. Assay cut-off:
Analytical performance of the device around the claimed cutoff is described in
precision section M.1a above
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The study was performed by comparing ELSIA results against the LC/MS/MS
results on the same head or body hair samples. A total of 161 donor hair
samples were tested (64 negative and 97 positive). The results are presented in
the table below:
