SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification
Decision Summary
To: Gen-Probe Prodesse, Inc. RE: K123838
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own
Class II, Class III or Class I devices requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable
(delete/add items as necessary):
1) The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device:
Trade Name: Pro hMPV™+ Assay
510(k) number: K082688
2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDEDUSEof the modified device as described in
its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for
use, package labeling, and, if available, advertisements or promotional materials(labeling changes
are permitted as long as they do not affect the intended use).
3) A description of the device MODIFICATION(S) .
1- RT-PCR cycling for the New Pro hMPV+ Assay ends after cycle 35 in place of the current
endpoint of cycle 50.
2- The Pro hMPV+ Supermix has been modified to decrease background fluorescence.
3- The hMPV RNA Control III was replaced by the Pro hMPV+ Control which has the following
changes:
a. The control stock manufacturer is now Asuragen, Inc. instead of Gen-Probe Prodesse.
b. The stock concentration (given in copies/µl) of the Pro hMPV + Control is increased by
75%.
c. The Pro hMPV+ Control is used at the concentration at which it is supplied, eliminating
the need for a 1:10 dilution step prior to assay set up. Combined with the increase in
stock concentration(given in copies/µl), the working concentration for the Pro hMPV+
Control is 175% higher than the current hMPV RNA Control III.
d. The Pro hMPV+ Control is programmed into the Cepheid SmartCycler software as a
defined control (Positive Control – PC).
Select Analytic Studies
Limit of Detection
The analytical sensitivity (limit of detection or LoD) of the Pro hMPV+ Assay was determined using
quantified (TCID /mL) cultures of two hMPV (subtype A2 and subtype B2) strains serially diluted in
50
nasopharyngeal clinical matrix. Each viral strain was processed using the bioMérieux NucliSENS
EasyMAG system for extraction and the SmartCycler II Instrument for RT-PCR. The LoD was identical
to the original Pro hMPV+ Assay for hMPV strain A2 and 0.5 log lower for hMPV strain B2.

Positive Control Effectiveness
The Pro hMPV+ Control (PC) is a non-infectious in vitrotranscribed RNA of the hMPV viral sequence
targeted by the New Pro hMPV+ Assay. Its purpose is to test for procedural errors (absence of reagent,
instrument failure, etc.) that may result in failure of the assay to detect hMPV. TheNew Pro hMPV+
Assay uses the PC at a higher concentration than Current Pro hMPV. “Defective” RT-PCR master mixes
(e.g. no reverse transcriptase, no Taq polymerase, decreased hMPV primer concentration) were
prepared and tested to assess the PC’s ability to detect global errors. Each defective mix was tested
using 20 replicates of the New Pro hMPV+ Control. A Negative Control (NC) consisting of Internal
Control (IC) in viral transport media, was included in each run. For each defective mix, none of the hMPV
PC replicates were detected and thus, the New PC was considered effective.
Clinical Comparison Study
The Pro hMPV+ Assay’s supermix was reformulated and performance characteristics were established
by comparing the reformulated assay to the original Pro hMPV+ Assay. One hundred eighty-three
retrospective nasopharyngeal swab samples collected during 2011 –2012 at two sites (Milwaukee, WI
and Chicago, IL) were used for this study. NP swab samples positive and negativefor hMPVwere
selected for inclusion based on previous site-specific molecular test results. One sample was not used in
the final analysis as it was Unresolved upon initial and repeat testing with both the original and
reformulated ProhMPV+ Assays.
“True” hMPV positives were considered as any sample that tested positive for hMPV by the original Pro
hMPV+ Assay. “True” hMPV negatives were considered as any sample that tested negative for hMPV by
the original Pro hMPV+ Assay. Discrepant analysis for samples where the reformulated Pro hMPV+
Assay and the original Pro hMPV+ results were in disagreement was performed using RT-PCR with
hMPV specific primers targeting the hMPV phosphoprotein gene followed by bi-directional genetic
sequencing.

* Two samples tested positive for hMPV by bi-directional sequencing.
Of the 183 samples chosen, 53 were previously reported to be positive and 130 were reported to be
negative by initial testing. Of the 53 positive 13 were negative upon retesting with the Current and New
ProhMPV+ Assay. This was most likely due to low levels of analyte in the sample, indicated by high Ct
during initial testing. There were 4 samples that tested positive amongthe chosen 130 negative
samples; this was probably due to the fact that the initial screening assay for those samples did not
detect hMPV.
To support the lowering of the Ct cut-off to 35 cycles a histogram of the Ct values for all positive clinical
samples was generated. The distribution of Ct values shows that the maximum Ct detected in a clinical
sample was below the 35 Ct threshold. In addition,the clinical data shows that the new version of the

b) Analytical Reactivity Testing was conducted as described in section 3, Device Modifications.
c) Declaration of Conformity
A “Declaration of Conformity” statement was submitted for the manufacturing facility and validation
activities and signed by the Director of Quality Assurance and the Senior Director of Technical
Operations respectively. The statements indicate that;
i) The manufacturing facility is in conformance with design control procedure requirements as
specified in 21 CFR 820.30 and the records are available for review.
ii) The validation activities, as required by the risk analysis, for the modification were performed
by the designated individuals and the results demonstrated that the predetermined
acceptance criteria were met.
In conclusion, based on both the results of the analytical reactivity testing and the risk management
report, the modified labeling is truthful and accurate. The changes do not affect the performance of
the test and it is therefore substantially equivalent to the current cleared test.
7) A Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary or Statement and the Indications for
Use Enclosure.
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use
for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular
modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices
demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the
design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the
device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.
