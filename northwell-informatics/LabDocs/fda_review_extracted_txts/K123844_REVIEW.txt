I. Device Description:
The Chemtrue® hCG Pregnancy Urine test is designed in Dipstick and Cassette
formats. The hCG Combo (Serum/Urine) Cassette test is distributed in Cassette
format only. Each test device consists of one (1) individual test strip and each test
strip in the device consists of:
1) A conjugate pad contains colloidal gold conjugated with monoclonal ( mouse) anti-
hCG antibody specific to the beta subunit of hCG.
2) A nitrocellulose membrane which is striped with the specific goat anti-hCG in the
test line (T line) and goat anti-mouse antibody in the control line (C line). The C line
(serves as an internal process control of the system and appears as a colored band
during the test regardless of the hCG level in the test sample.
All the configurations have the same membrane format, reagents and gold conjugate
pad, as well as the same flow characteristics, except the test line in the nitrocellulose
membrane for hCG Combo test is striped with polyclonal goat anti-hCG antibodies.
Devices are packaged one device per foil pouch and 25 devices in each kit.

· FDA guidance: Review Criteria for Assessment of Professional Use Human
Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) In Vitro Diagnostic Devices – Document Issued
on: November 6, 1996.
· CLSI EP7-A2; Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry
L. Test Principle:
The devices employ lateral flow immunoassay technology for detection of human
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine or serum. Monoclonal (Polyclonal for hCG
Combo) goat anti-hCG antibodies are pre-striped in the nitrocellulose membrane on
the test region (T line) and goat anti- mouse antibodies on the control region (C line).
During testing, the urine or serum specimen reacts with the conjugate pad (It contains
colloidal gold particles conjugated with monoclonal anti-hCG antibody specific to the
beta subunit of hCG) located just beneath the sample pad and above the membrane of
the test strip. The specimen migrates upward on the membrane by capillary action to
react with the antibodies on the membrane. If the hCG concentration in the specimen
is at or above the designated detection limit, a red colored line at the test region will
be present indicating a positive result, while its absence indicates a negative result.
The control line (C line) serves as an internal process control. The control line should
always appear, regardless of the hCG concentration of the test specimen, and the C
line is an indicator that sufficient sample volume has been added to the test device
and the sample has correctly migrated up the test strip.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility study was conducted in three (3) POL sites by three (3)
operators from each site with three (3) lots of each proposed device formats
over three (3) non-consecutive days. The samples contained spiked hCG at
concentrations of 0, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 mIU/mL in urine; 0, 15, 20, 25,
30 and 35 mIU/mL in serum (used for hCG Combo Test). The identity and

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. This is a qualitative device.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Real-time and accelerated stability testing showed that the Chemtrue® hCG urine
Dipstick/Cassette and hCG Combo Cassette Test devices are stable for 24
months when stored at 4oC – 30oC. Protocols and acceptance criteria were
reviewed and found acceptable
d. Detection limit:
To verify the claimed cut-off /sensitivity of the Chemtrue® hCG Tests, a study
was conducted with three (3) lots per each hCG tests and device formats.
Chemtrue® hCG Urine Tests: Three (3) lots each of the Chemtrue® hCG Test
formats were used for the study. The controls were prepared using 20 human
urine or serum pools from non-pregnant donors with spiked hCG, which was
traceable to WHO 5th IS (07/364) at concentrations ranging from 0 to 100
mIU/mL. A separate set of the samples was used for each device format. Five
(5) replicates were tested at each hCG level by three (3) operators. The results
are summarized:

e. Analytical specificity:
The cross-reactivity study was conducted with three (3) lots of each test
format/configuration with spiked concentration of the structurally related or
potential interfering substances in hCG negative and hCG positive (20
mIU/mL for hCG Urine Tests and 25 mIU/mL for Combo Test) urine and
serum samples. The following compounds did not interfere with the urine and
serum Chemtrue® hCG Tests at the following tested hCG concentrations:
Substance Concentration
Acetylsalicylate Acid 20 mg/dL
Albumin (Human) 2000 mg/dL
Ascorbic Acid 20 mg/dL
Atropine 20 mg/dL
Bilirubin 2 mg/dL
Caffeine 20 mg/dL
Cannabinol 10 mg/dL
Ephedrine 20 mg/dL
Gentisic Acid 20 mg/dL
Glucose 2000 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 250 mg/dL
Ibuprofen 40 mg/dL
Methadone 10 mg/dL
Morphine 6 µg/dL
Phenylpropanolamine 20 mg/dL
Salicylic acid 20 mg/dL
Uric Acid 20 mg/dL
Testing also demonstrated that the Chemtrue® hCG urine and serum tests do
not cross react with hLH up to 300 mIU/mL, hFSH up to 1000 mIU/mL and
hTSH up to 1000 µIU/mL.
An interference study with hCGßcf was also performed with three (3) lots of
each format at the concentrations 125,000, 250,000, 500,000 and 1,000,000
pmol/mL of hCGßcf that were added into 5 and 50 mIU/mL hCG urine and
serum controls,The results demonstrate that hCGßcf up to 5.0 IU/mL does not
interfere with the urine or serum Chemtrue® hCG Tests.
The effect of specific gravity (SG) and pH were evaluated by testing urine
sample duplicates at each sample level of hCG negative and 20 mIU/mL (25
mIU/mL for Combo Test). Samples with pH 2.0 to 9.0, and SG of 1.003 to
1.030 were evaluated. No interference was observed for pH value 2.0 to 9.0
and SG values from 1.003 to 1.030.

High Dose Hook effect.
The studies for hCG Urine (Dipstick/Cassette) and Combo Tests were
performed on three (3) lots of each test format with spiked non-pregnant urine
and serum pools at hCG concentrations of 50, 100, 200, 300 and 500 IU/mL.
Five replicates of each lot were tested at each hCG concentration. No hook
effect was observed. The results were the same across lots. The overall results
are summarized in Tables below:

Chemtrue® hCG Pregnancy Tests were compared with the predicate kits stated
in the tables below. A total of 300 clinical urine and 300 clinical serum
samples were blind coded and tested with the appropriate device format by
nine (9) operators from three (3) POL sites (three operators in each site). One
hundred-fifty (150) hCG negative urine samples (collected from women of
childbearing age, including peri-menopausal) and 150 hCG positive samples
that represented women who were suspected to be pregnant within the first 30
days of pregnancy/the first trimester of pregnancy were evaluated. The hCG
serum samples (150 positive and 150 negative) were quantitatively confirmed
by Abbott i2000 instrument. Results were similar between sites. The overall
results are summarized in tables below:
