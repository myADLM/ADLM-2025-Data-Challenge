3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
The information provided from this test may supplement decision making and should
only be used in conjunction with routine monitoring by a physician. Because of the
variability in the knowledge of clinical utility with specific drugs that are metabolized by
CYP2C19, clinicians should use professional judgment in the interpretation of results
from this test. Results from this type of assay should not be used in predicting a patient’s
response to drugs for which the drug metabolizing enzyme activity of that allele, or drug
metabolic pathway, has not been clearly established.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Spartan RX Platform
I. Device Description:
The Spartan RX CYP2C19 Test System is a sample-to-result DNA testing system with
integrated DNA extraction and amplification. Genotypes are determined using PCR and
fluorescent probe detection. The Spartan RX CYP2C19 Test System is comprised of the
2

--- Page 3 ---
Spartan RX Platform, Spartan transport system, and Spartan RX Assays (sample
collection kit and external control kit). The Spartan RX CYP2C19 Assays are run on the
Spartan RX Platform.
The Spartan RX CYP2C19 Test System uses a sample obtained with a buccal swab. The
operator collects the buccal swab samples from a patient, inserts each sample into a
reagent tube, places the reagent tube into the transport system until the reagent tubes are
ready to be inserted into an Analyzer instrument. The test system then integrates and
automates DNA extraction, PCR-based amplification of the target gene, detection of the
*2, *3, and *17 alleles using fluorescent-probes v. fluorescent signal detection and
analysis, and genotype determination. Results are presented to the end user as genotype
calls. The system has integrated controls that monitor performance of a run and
automatically inform the user of any anomalies in the instrument or reagents. The system
detects the CYP2C19 *2, *3, and *17 genotypes in separate reagent tubes.
The Spartan RX CYP2C19 Test System uses the Spartan RX Platform which has four
components:
1. The Spartan RX Analyzer is a thermal cycling instrument that automates polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the target gene, fluorescence-based detection of
CYP2C19 alleles, and genotype calling.
2. The Netbook serves as the user interface for logging into the Spartan RX Platform,
inputting patient information, and starting a test.
3. The Printer automatically prints the genotype results after the Spartan RX Platform
finishes performing the Spartan RX CYP2C19 Assay.
4. The Barcode Scanner is used to automatically enter SCK and ECK lot numbers into the
Spartan RX Platform.
The Spartan RX CYP2C19 Test System uses Spartan RX Assays (Sample collection kit
and external control kit). The Spartan RX Assays are the consumable components of the
Spartan RX CYP2C19 Test System.
Sample collection kits (SCKs) contain the consumables required to determine a patient's
CYP2C19 *2, *3, or *17 genotype. There are three types of SCKs, specific for the *2, *3,
or *17 allele. Each SCK consists of a pouch, buccal swab, and a reagent tube. The pouch
contains labeling information to ensure traceability (lot number, manufacturing date, and
expiry date) and two compartments (for the buccal swab and reagent tube). The pouch
also includes a barcode that is compatible with a standard reader. The buccal swab is used
to collect a buccal sample from the inside of a patient's cheek and transfer it into the
reagent tube. The reagent tube contains chemicals for DNA extraction, PCR
amplification, and fluorescent detection of the specific CYP2C19 allele. The SCKs are
color-coded to indicate which CYP2C19 allele they are designed to detect.
3

--- Page 4 ---
The External control kits (ECKs) contain the consumables required to determine if the
Spartan RX Platform and reagents are performing correctly. Each ECK consists of a
pouch and reagent tube. The pouch contains labeling information to ensure traceability
(lot number, manufacturing date, and expiry date). The reagent tube contains synthetic
nucleic acid control and chemicals for PCR amplification and fluorescent detection of the
specific CYP2C19 allele. The ECKs are color-coded to indicate which reagent they
control for (blue = *2, white = *3, and black = *17). The ECKs are always produced
from the same lot of reagents for which they are designed to control.
The Transport System is designed to keep the sample collection kits and collected
samples cold as they are moved from the freezer to the patient and from the patient to the
Spartan RX Analyzer. The sample transport system is an insulated transport bag that
contains a polystyrene box and a Cold Block.

L. Test Principle:
The Spartan RX CYP2C19 Test System utilizes PCR amplification of target DNA and
detection of the presence or absence of specific CYP2C19 alleles (*2, *3, *17) using
molecular beacon probes. The Spartan RX CYP2C19 Test System makes use of a two-
temperature PCR cycling program which combines the annealing and extension steps.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Site-to-Site Reproducibility
The reproducibility study was conducted at three sites (two external and one internal).
The three sites are designated, site 1, site 3, and site 4. Samples used for the study
were buccal scrapes collected from *1/*17, *2/*3, *1/*1, *17/*17,*1/*3, *2/*17,
*2/*2, and *1/*2 individuals (one individual per genotype); samples were collected
from eight individuals at each site. Genotypes of the individuals included in the study
were confirmed by bi-directional DNA sequencing prior to initiation of the study.
Reproducibility was evaluated at each site in two sessions each day. During each
session the following was performed twice: Eight individuals were tested by two
operators. If the result of the first test performed using the Spartan RX CYP2C19
System for a particular individual was inconclusive, the test was repeated (second
pass), as per the RX System's Instructions For Use. External control tests were
performed on each system, as per the RX System's Instructions For Use, and testing
proceeded if the results passed.
A total of 960 tests were performed; 10 second pass tests were performed due to
inconclusive calls on the first pass test. After second pass testing of inconclusive
genotype results, the Spartan RX CYP2C19 Test System produced a correct call rate
of 99.8%, with a 95% one-sided lower confidence limit of 99%. There was one
incorrect call. The root cause of the incorrect call could not conclusively be
determined.

Lot-to-lot Reproducibility
The Spartan FRX CYP2C19 Test System uses independent reagents for detection of
each of the three CYP2C19 mutations (*2, *3, *17). Lot-to-lot reproducibility was
assessed using three independent lots of each reagent type. Samples used for the study
were buccal scrapes collected from *1/*1, *1/*17, *2/*17, *17/*17, *2/*3, and *2/*2
individuals. After second pass testing of inconclusive genotype results, the Spartan
RX CYP2C19 Test System produced a correct call rate of 99.0%, with a 95% one-
sided lower confidence limit of 98%.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls:
External Controls: The system contains an External Control kit. The External Control
reagent has two synthetic target nucleic acids that contain binding sites for the
primers and wild-type or mutant probe are added. The external control kit contains a
reagent for each of the three CYP2C19 loci (*2, *3 and *17) tested in the assay. At
each locus under investigation, there is control material that is specific for the
recessive (positive control) and dominant (negative control) genotype. PCR
amplification and bi-directional DNA sequencing of each of the 6 control materials is
used to confirm the sequence of the 6 oligonucleotides. External Controls result in a
pass or fail and do not provide a genotype result.
Previously characterized genomic DNA can be tested by 1 μl of purified genomic
DNA at 0.1 ng/μl using a pipette. The acceptable range of genomic DNA is 0.03 ng to
0.5 ng. The recommended amount is 0.1 ng because this has been determined to be
just above the limit of detection of the assay (see 1d below). The acceptable A /A
260 280
ratio is 1.5 to 1.9. As a control, a buccal sample from a person with a known genotype
may also be run.
Stability
The Sample Collection Kits and External Control kits are shipped frozen on dry ice.
The kits contain a Timestip Plus disposable temperature indicator to inform the user if
the package has remained frozen during shipping. Sample Collection Kits and
External Control kits must be stored in a manual defrost freezer (one that does not say
“frost-free”) at a temperature between -20°C to -80°C. When stored under these
conditions, Sample Collection Kits and External Control kits are stable until the
expiry date marked on the product label.

Sample stability
Sample stability was tested using 52 samples on 9 systems. Samples were stored in
the transport system for up to 2 hours and run on the CYP2C19 Test System.
Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and deemed acceptable. Information
submitted supports the sponsor’s claims that 1) the Sample Collection Kits must be
used within 45 minutes of being removed from the freezer and 2) the buccal swab
sample inserted into the reagent tube is stable for 1 hour if contained in the sample
transport system.
d. Detection limit:
The input material for the Spartan RX CYP2C19 Test System is a buccal swab
collected from an individual, which is inserted directly into the reagent tube without
any requirement for the user to extract or purify DNA. The end user can only use one
buccal swab per test. 40 individuals had buccal swabs taken in the following range: 5
pooled swabs, 2 pooled swabs, 1 normal swab, one stroke swab, and buccal touch.
The detection limit was assessed by analysis of buccal swab samples collected from
*1/*1, *2/*17, *17/*17, and *2/*3 individuals. Genotypes of all individuals were
confirmed by bi-directional sequencing prior to initiation of the study. The
concentration of genomic DNA isolated from each individual was determined using
absorbance of DNA at 260 nm. For each individual and each genomic DNA sample,
PCR performance was assessed using 4 replicates. The DNA concentration was
determined using a genomic standard curve. The quantity and quality was determined
using absorbance at 260nm and 280 nm, respectively. The following is the
determined amount of DNA on a swab:
Average DNA

Amount (ng)
5 pooled swabs 3.3
2 pooled swabs 1.6
Normal swab 1.3
One stroke 0.6
Inside mouth touch 0.1

A total of 58 samples were tested under a no rinse condition. 56 samples were tested
by rinsing with 15 ml water for at least 10 seconds immediately prior to swab
collection. 56 samples were tested by rinsing with 30 ml water for at least 60 seconds
immediately prior to swab collection. If the result of the first test performed using the
Spartan RX CYP2C19 Test System for a particular individual was inconclusive; the
test was repeated (second pass). Five samples produced inconclusive results; after
second pass repeats of these samples, the system produced a 100% correct call rate
for all rinse conditions tested. A water rinse is recommended to mitigate the risk that
substances in the mouth that may interfere with performance of the Spartan RX
CYP2C19 Test System.
Interference (Exogenous Substances):
Interference from potential exogenous interfering substances was evaluated using
buccal swab samples collected from *1/*1, *2/*17, *17/*17, and *2/*3 individuals.
Genotypes of all individuals were confirmed by bi-directional sequencing prior to
initiation of the study. To test the impact of exogenous substances on performance of
the Spartan RX CYP2C19 Test System, buccal samples were collected from
individuals immediately after exposure to the substance followed by a water rinse,
which was performed as per the RX CYP2C19 Test System's instructions for use. A
total of 16 samples were tested for each potential exogenous interfering substance
(n=4 per genotype tested). If the result of the first test performed using the Spartan
RX CYP2C19 Test System for a particular individual was inconclusive, the test was
repeated (second pass).The following exogenous substances and amounts were tested:
• Antiseptic mouthwash - 20 ml -Rinse around mouth for 30 seconds
• Toothpaste - 3/4” strip- Brush teeth for 2 min, spit
• Baking soda solution - 30 ml (0.1 g /ml)- Rinse around mouth for 10 seconds
• Cough syrup - 30 ml - Rinse around mouth for 10 seconds
• Cranberry juice - 30 ml -Rinse around mouth for 10 seconds
• Salt water - 30 ml (0.01 g/ml)- Rinse around mouth for 10 seconds
• Sugar water - 30 ml (0.01 g/ml)- Rinse around mouth for 10 seconds
• Meat - 15 g- Chew for 10 seconds
• Chewing gum - 1 standard piece- Chew for 1 min
• Hard candy - 1 standard piece - Suck until fully dissolved
• Tobacco smoking - 1 cigar - 5 puffs
• Denture paste - Apply 3 strips to roof of mouth, leave for 5 min, remove
Mouthwash and tobacco smoke produced one inconclusive call each; these samples all
produced correct calls for the second pass test. Baking soda, and chewing gum, produced
two inconclusive calls; these samples also produced correct calls for the second pass test.
Chewing gum produced 11 inconclusive calls, with 1 inconclusive call remaining in the
second pass. After first and second pass analysis, the overall correct call rates were
91.5% and 99.55%, respectively. All substances tested met the acceptance criteria.

Interference (Endogenous Substances):
Interference from potential endogenous interfering substances was evaluated using buccal
swab samples collected from *1/*1, *2/*17, *17/*17, and *2/*3 individuals. Genotypes
of all individuals were confirmed by bi-directional sequencing prior to initiation of the
study. A total of 16 samples were tested for each potential endogenous interfering
substance (n=4 per genotype tested). Each of the following substances were added
directly to the reagent tube immediately prior to insertion of the buccal swab sample.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison testing was evaluated by technicians at three sites, Ottawa
Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, ON, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario,
Ottawa, ON, and Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, ON. 325 samples of genomic DNA
were extracted from saliva samples for bi-directional sequencing. These samples were
compared to results from the Spartan RX CYP2C19 System for precision and
reproducibility testing. 5 samples gave an inconclusive result on the first pass test
and were re-tested; after the second pass, all samples were called correctly. No
samples were called incorrectly. The overall correct call rate for the first pass and
second pass tests was 98.5% and 100%, respectively. The agreement between the RX
CYP2C19 system and bi-directional sequencing is summarized below.

CYP2C19*4, *5, *6, *7, *8, and other alleles may be associated with absent or reduced
enzyme activity, but are significantly less frequent than the CYP2C19*2 and *3 alleles. The
Spartan RX CYP2C19 Assay provides no information for these alleles.
Samples with the CYP2C19*10 genotype may be miscalled by the Spartan RX CYP2C19 Assay.
Both CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*10 are poor metabolizers.
