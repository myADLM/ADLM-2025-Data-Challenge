SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification
Decision Summary
To: Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) RE: k123905
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own
Class II or Class I device requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable
1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device:
Trade Name: CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel
510(k) number: k111507 (also k080570 and k101564)
2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in
its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for
use.
3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S). The modification presented in this 510(k) is the
modification of the package insert of the device so that the results for a specimen that tests positive
for InfA, H3, and pdmInfA markers and negative for H1 and pdmH1 markers will be interpreted as a
presumptive positive for H3N2v influenza A virus detection.
The submitter provided the following LoD, Analytical Reactivity, and Clinical Specimen Testing data:
Limit of Detection (LoD)
The LoD of the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel for influenza
A(H3N2) variant ((H3N2)v) virus was evaluated with two recent isolates by determining the lowest
concentration of virus as measured by 50% egg infectious dose (EID50/ml) where the InfA, pdmInfA,
and H3 primer and probe sets demonstrated a uniform detection rate of ≥ 95%. The results are
summarized in the table below.

Analytical Reactivity/Inclusivity
Recent isolates of influenza A (H3N2)v virus from 2009 - 2012 were evaluated with the CDC Human
Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel at virus concentrations of approximately 102.0
EID /ml. The inclusivity testing verifies that the device can detect contemporary influenza A (H3N2)v

viruses near the LoD. The results are summarized in the following table.

Clinical Specimen Testing
From July 2012 to August 2012, a total of 165 human respiratory specimens that tested positive for
InfA, H3, and pdmInfA markers and negative for H1 and pdmH1 markers with the CDC Human
Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel were transferred from U.S. public health
laboratories to the CDC for confirmatory testing.
The specimens were retested upon arrival with the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR
Diagnostic Panel following the instructions for use provided in the package insert. Results were
confirmed through genetic sequence analysis. Comparison of the results obtained with the CDC
Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel to the results of the genetic sequencing
analysis demonstrated a positive percent agreement of 97.6% with a 95% confidence interval of
93.9-99.1 % for the detection of influenza A (H3N2)v virus.

6. Design Control Activities Summary:
a) Risk Analysis:
A risk analysis for the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel was
conducted and the results reviewed to verify that the change did not present increased or new risks to
the user. No new risks were identified as a result of the proposed modification. As an additional
mitigation, (H3N2)v influenza strains will continue to be referred to CDC for further confirmation.
The following table is a summary of the risk analysis:

b) LoD, Analytical Reactivity/Inclusivity testing, and testing of clinical specimens were conducted as

c) Declaration of Conformity
A “Declaration of Conformity” statement was submitted for the manufacturing facility and verification
activities and signed by the Deputy Branch Chief, Division of the Scientific Resources, CDC, and the
Acting Branch Chief, Virus Surveillance and Diagnostic Branch, CDC, respectively. The statements
indicate that:
1. The manufacturing facility is in conformance with design control procedure requirements as
specified in 21 CFR 820.30 and the records are available for review.
2. The verification activities, as required by the risk analysis, for the modification were performed by
the designated individuals and the results demonstrated that the predetermined acceptance
criteria were met.
In conclusion, based on both the results of the analytical testing, clinical specimens testing, and the
risk management report, the modified labeling is truthful and accurate. The changes do not affect the
performance of the test and it is therefore substantially equivalent to the current cleared test.
7. A Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary, and the Indications for
Use Enclosure.
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended
use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the
particular modification and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices
demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided
the design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm. On this basis, I recommend
the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.
