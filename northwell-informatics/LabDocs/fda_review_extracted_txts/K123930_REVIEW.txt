L. Test Principle:
The VITROS Chemistry Products HCY 2 assay utilizes a chemical reaction in which
disulfide linked homocysteine (oxidized forms) in the sample is reduced by Tris (2-
Carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) to form reduced homocysteine.
Reduced homocysteine reacts with serine in the presence of cystathionine b-synthase
(CBS) to form L-cystathionine. L-cystathionine is broken down by cystathionine b-
lyase (CBL) to produce homocysteine, pyruvate and ammonia. Pyruvate is reduced to
lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) using NADH as coenzyme. The concentration
+
of homocysteine is directly proportional to the amount of NADH converted to NAD
and is measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. Once a calibration has been
performed, the homocysteine concentration in each unknown sample can be
determined using the stored calibration curve and the measured absorbance obtained
in the assay of the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analyticalperformance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were conducted by the sponsor on the VITROS 5,1 FS,
VITROS 4600 and the VITROS 5600 Chemistry Systems following CLSI
guidance document EP05-A2. Three levels of homocysteine-spiked, human
serum-based samples were run 2 times per run, 2 runs per day, for a total of at
least 21 days (n ≥ 80 measurements/sample level). Results are summarized
below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed according to NCCLS EP6-A recommendations
for evaluation of linearity. A series of 9 samples was prepared by combining
various volumetric proportions of a spiked, high analyte human serum pool and a
low analyte, human serum pool to produce samples with homocysteine values
ranging from 0.3 to 74.9 μmol/L. Three determinations of each of these samples
were made on each of three different VITROS HCY 2 Reagent reagent lots on
the VITROS 5,1 FS, VITROS 4600, and VITROS 5600 Chemistry Systems.
The linear regression correlation between the expected values and the measured
values is summarized below for a representative lot:

The linearity study provided by the sponsor supports a reportable range claim for
the VITROS HCY 2 device of 2 – 50 µmol/L homocysteine.

sponsor claims that calibration is stable for 2 months. The protocol and
acceptance criteria have been provided and found to be adequate to support the
sponsor’s claims.
HCY 2 Performance Verifier Value Assignment
The VITROS Chemistry Products HCY 2 Performance Verifiers I, II, and II were
value assigned on 2 VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry Systems using 2 lots of VITROS
Chemistry Products HCY 2 Reagent, 2 lots of VITROS Chemistry Products
HCY Reagent, and 1 run of 8 replicates per instrument (N=16 total replicates per
assay).
Target values for HCY 2 Verifiers I, II and III are 7.0, 12.5, and 25 µmol/L,
respectively, and can be used for both HCY and HCY 2 tests. Lot specific target ranges
are provided in the value assignment sheet.
HCY 2 Performance Verifier Stability
The shelf life stability of the VITROS HCY 2 verifiers was tested on a VITROS
5,1 FS Chemistry System using a real time study extending at least one month
beyond the selected expiration date. Testing is ongoing. The VITROS HCY 2
verifiers are stored refrigerated (2-8°C), and are stable for at least 8 months
when stored at this storage temperature.
The opened vial stability of the VITROS HCY 2 verifiers was tested on a
VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System. Testing is ongoing. The verifiers are stable
for at least 14 days when stored at 2-8°C .
Real-time stability study protocol and acceptance criteria has been provided and
found to be adequate to support the sponsor’s claims.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor performed a detection limit study for the VITROS HCY 2 assay on
the VITROS 5,1 FS Chemistry System, the VITROS 4600 Chemistry System, and
the VITROS 5600 Integrated System, according to CLSI guidance document
EP17-A.
Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined for each of 3 reagent lots, based on One
hundred (100) replicate homocysteine measurements of 1 blank sample
(homocysteine stripped human serum) on each of the 3 VITROS chemistry
systems. The limit of blank, as determined by adding the pooled blank standard
deviation to the blank calculated concentration mean, was 0.39 µmol/L.
Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined for each of 3 reagent lots, based on One
hundred (100) replicate homocysteine measurements of 5 low human serum-
based samples on each of the 3 VITROS chemistry systems. The limits of
detection were calculated using the determined LoB value and pooled SD values
7

--- Page 8 ---
from LoD samples. The sponsor claimed that the LoD for serum samples on
VITROS chemistry systems was 0.79 µmol/L.
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) determination was based on interassay precision of
≤20% for 12 replicate measurements of 4 low serum samples, per day for 3
days, on each of the 3 VITROS chemistry systems. The LoQ was determined to
be 2.0 µmol/L for the VITROS HCY 2 assay on each of the 3 VITROS
chemistry systems.
The HCY 2 test has a measuring range of 2 to 50 µmol/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed according to CLSI guidance
document EP-7A to determine the effects from potential interferents on the
VITROS HCY 2 assay. Various concentrations of interferents were spiked
into serum pools containing homocysteine at low (~6 umol/L) and elevated
(~25 umol/L) concentrations. All samples were tested in triplicate on each
of the 3 VITROS Chemistry Systems. The sponsor states that interference
is considered to be non-significant if the bias between the tested and
control samples are within ±10% for HCY concentration of >12 umol/L
and within 1.79 umol/L for HCY concentration of <12 umol/L.
Below is a summary table of the highest concentration of interferent tested
and found not to interfere based on the stated acceptance criteria.

Based on their interference study results, the sponsor made the following
limitations in their labeling:
· Patient samples containing cystathionine (reference interval: 0.065 to
0.301 μmol/L 13) show positive equimolar interference with the VITROS
Chemistry Products HCY 2 assay. For example, a sample containing 10.0
μmol/L homocysteine and 0.3 μmol/L cystathionine will generate a
VITROS Chemistry Products HCY 2 assay result of ~10.3 μmol/L.
Elevated cystathionine levels can be observed in patients with certain
conditions, such as renal disease, folate deficiency, and cystathionine
beta-lyase deficiency.
· Patient samples containing elevated levels of L-cysteine (normal range:
178 to 196 μmol/L 15) can show positive interference with the VITROS
Chemistry Products HCY 2 assay. For example, a sample containing 6.2
μmol/L homocysteine and an additional 600 μmol/L added L-cysteine
could generate a VITROS Chemistry Products HCY 2 assay result of ~8.6
μmol/L (bias of +2.4 μmol/L).
· For samples that generate a Sample Integrity Turbidity-index flag, dilute
the sample and re-analyze (refer to the Sample Dilution section of the
product insert).
An additional study analyzed 10 paired sets of serum and 2x Li-Heparin and 2x
EDTA plasma samples to determine the impact of short draws on HCY2 assay
performance. Due to observed negative bias, the sponsor recommends that short
draws not be used.
The sponsor has the following limitations in the labeling:
Whole blood samples should be centrifuged within 1 hour after collection or
refrigerated for up to 8 hours prior to centrifugation. After blood is drawn,
homocysteine is released from erythrocytes and the concentration will
increase at a rate of approximately 1 μmol/L per hour at room temperature.
Plasma specimens must be collected in plasma tubes that are at least half full.
Smaller volumes can result in negative biases.

A method comparison study was performed on at least 110 human serum samples, 10
of which were spiked with homocysteine, on the VITROS 5,1 FS, VITROS 4600 and
the VITROS 5600 Chemistry Systems, versus the predicate method, following CLSI-
EP9A2-IR. Three reagent lots were used for the testing. Samples were measured in
singlicate and ranged in homocysteine concentration from 2.90 to 44.4 umol/L.
Results are summarized below for the linear regression analyses resulting from a plot
of homocysteine concentrations obtained on the subject (Y-axis) and predicate (X-

b. Matrix comparison:
Matrix comparison studies were completed 40 paired serum and plasma samples
(EDTA Plasma and Li-Heparin Plasma; 32 were native samples and 8 were spiked
samples). Each sample was tested in duplicate on each of 3 lots of VITROS
Chemistry Products HCY 2 Reagent on all 3 VITROS Chemistry Systems. Linear
regression analysis using singlet set of data showed the following relationships
between plasma and serum samples:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Expected values are based on data collected using the predicate VITROS HCY
