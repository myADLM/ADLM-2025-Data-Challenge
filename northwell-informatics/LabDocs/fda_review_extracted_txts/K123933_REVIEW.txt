I. Device Description:
MicroScan Dried Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panels are designed for use in
determining quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of
colonies grown on solid media of rapidly growing aerobic and facultative
anaerobic gram-positive bacteria.
The antimicrobial susceptibility tests are miniaturizations of the broth dilution
susceptibility test that have been diluted in broth and dehydrated. Various
antimicrobial agents are diluted in broth to concentrations bridging the range of
clinical interest. Panels are rehydrated with water after inoculation with a
standardized suspension of the organism. After incubation in a non-CO incubator
2
for 16-20 hours, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the test
organism is read by determining the lowest antimicrobial concentration showing
inhibition of growth. The panels can be read manually using the MicroSCAN
Microdilution Viewer or on automated MicroSCAN instrumentation (autoSCAN-
4 or WalkAway systems).
Ceftaroline is a cephalosporin antibacterial agent with activity against gram-
positive bacteria. The bactericidal action of Ceftaroline is mediated through
binding to essential penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). The concentrations of
Ceftaroline tested in the MicroScan panel range from 0.06 µg/mL to 16 µg/mL.
Ceftaroline is indicated for treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure
infections and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, when caused by
susceptible strains of the designated organism.
The MIC interpretive criteria for Ceftaroline are as follows:

aThere are no intermediate or resistant interpretive criteria for Ceftaroline. The
current absence of resistant isolates precludes defining any results other than
“Susceptible.” Isolates yielding MIC results other than “Susceptible” should be
submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.

L. Test Principle:
The antimicrobial susceptibility tests are miniaturizations of the broth dilution
susceptibility test which have been dehydrated. Various antimicrobial agents are
diluted in Mueller-Hinton broth with calcium and magnesium to concentrations
bridging the range of clinical interest. After inoculation and rehydration with a
standardized suspension of organism and incubation at 35˚ C for 16-20 hours, the
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) or a qualitative susceptibility (Susceptible,
Intermediate or Resistant) for the test organism is determined by observing the lowest
antimicrobial concentration showing inhibition of growth.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility data for 11 S. aureus isolates including 5 methicillin-
susceptible strains and 6 methicillin-resistant strains (10 Challenge isolates
and 1 QC strain) were generated at 3 clinical trial sites. Organism selection
was based on the intended use of the antimicrobic and favored strains for
which the MIC was close to the breakpoints. Each strain was tested at each
site in triplicate over three days using 2 inoculation methods [Turbidity and
Prompt] and 3 reading methods (manual, WalkAway Instrument and
autoSCAN-4 Instrument). Replicates were prepared using individually
prepared inocula.
The mode of the test panel MIC results (or the median value for those results
without a mode) was determined for each isolate. MIC results at each site
were compared to the mode/median value. Results were considered in
agreement if the test panel MIC was equal to or within ± 1 dilution of the
mode/median for that isolate.

results (≥ 98.5 % of results within the acceptable range) as compared to the
reference method were obtained for all inoculation and reading methods. The
Ceftaroline test results demonstrate that the system can produce QC results
within the expected range.

Growth Failure Rate: All isolates tested during the clinical (efficacy) trials
grew in both the frozen reference panel and the dried MicroScan panels.
Purity check plates were performed to detect contamination during the
clinical (efficacy) trials at the clinical sites. No contamination was recorded at
any site.
Inoculum Density check: The MicroScan Turbidity Meter and Prompt
method were used to standardize the inoculum. Turbidity meter readings were
recorded each day of use. The Turbidity meter was previous cleared by FDA
(K864542). Colony count validation data was reviewed and found to be
acceptable.
The quality control study results are acceptable.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The MicroScan Dried Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panel with Ceftaroline
results were compared to results obtained using a frozen broth microdilution
panel prepared according to CLSI M07-A9 guidelines, except for the use of
Pluronic-F in the inoculum water for the reference panel. All isolates were
tested using the nine dilutions of Ceftaroline. Dilutions tested were
appropriate for the interpretive breakpoints for the drug. For each organism
tested, MIC panels were inoculated using the same standardized suspension,
further diluted into 25 mL of water with either Pluronic–D (for the MicroScan
dried panels) or Pluronic-F (for the frozen reference panels.) Performance was
analyzed using FDA breakpoints for Ceftaroline, and results were compared
based on the guidelines provided in the Class II Special Controls Guidance
Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems.
A validation study was performed to demonstrate equivalence between
reference panels inoculated with water supplemented with Pluronic-F and
reference panels inoculated with autoclaved distilled water without Pluronic-
F. The essential agreement for Pluronic-F vs. autoclaved distilled water was
100%.
A total of 306 S. aureus clinical isolates were tested at 3 clinical trial sites,
including a total of 166 methicillin-susceptible strains, and 140 methicillin-
resistant strains. Of the total, 289 isolates were fresh (less than 7 days from
isolation) and 17 were stock isolates. Clinical isolates were tested using
inocula prepared using the turbidity method (MicroScan Turbidity Meter) and
read manually.
A total of 75 Challenge isolates were tested at one clinical trial site. Organism
selection for the Challenge isolates was based on the intended use of
Ceftaroline and favored strains for which the MIC was close to the breakpoint.
Expected results were determined from the mode result obtained from 18
8

--- Page 9 ---
replicates of each isolate tested using a frozen reference panel prepared using
CLSI M07-A9 guidelines. Challenge isolates were tested using inocula
prepared using both the turbidity method and the Prompt Inoculation System.
Results were read using 3 methods: manual read, WalkAway Instrument and
autoSCAN-4 Instrument.
Combined results from clinical and challenge studies demonstrated an overall
EA of 99.0% (377/381) and an overall CA of 99.5% (379/381) for the
turbidity inoculation method with manual read.
According to the approved drug label for Ceftaroline, only a susceptible
interpretive category is defined. There are no intermediate or resistant
interpretive categories. In this study, there were 2 instances in which the
MicroScan panel results gave a categorical interpretation for Ceftaroline that
was not in agreement with the reference broth dilution MIC [reference method
results were non-susceptible (MIC = 2 µg/mL), while the MicroScan results
were susceptible (MIC = 1 µg/mL).] Even though the approved drug label
does not define “non-susceptible” breakpoints, FDA considered this to be a
potential very major error and indicative of potential “trending” at one
dilution lower than expected. Recommendations were included in the labeling
that isolates yielding MIC results suggestive of a non-susceptible result should
be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing. In addition, the
labeling cautions users to test S. aureus isolates that have MICs of 1 µg/mL
with an alternative testing method when indicated for patient care to reduce
the risk of very major errors.
The performance evaluation summary of essential and categorical agreement
results for challenge and clinical isolates is shown in the table below.
