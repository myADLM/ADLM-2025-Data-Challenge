I. Device Description:
iHealth BG5 wireless Smart and iHealth BG5L wireless Smart Gluco-Monitoring Systems
consist of the BG5 and BG5L wireless Smart blood glucose meters, respectively, AGS 1000I
Test Strips , sterile lancets, lancing device and the iHealth control solutions control solutions.
(Control solutions provided are for Level 1, II, and III).
iHealth BG5L uses Bluetooth 4.0 wireless radio technology; while iHealth BG5 uses
Bluetooth 3.0 wireless radio technology
The iHealth BG5 and BG5L Wireless Smart Glucose meters are based on an electrochemical
biosensor technology and the principle of capillary action. Capillary action at the end of the
test strip draws the blood into the action chamber and the blood glucose result is displayed in
5 seconds. The control solution available is used to test the performance of the device. It uses
the same technological characteristics for testing with its predicate device.
Control solutions (Level I, Level II, and Level III) are viscosity-adjusted, buffered aqueous
control solutions that contain known concentrations of d-glucose. The products are intended
for use to verify the performance of the The iHealth BG5 and BG5L Wireless Smart Glucose
Monitoring Systems.
The iHealth BG5 and BG5L meters can display the test results and the test results can also be
transmitted to an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad through blue tooth.

L. Test Principle:
The iHealth BG5 and BG5L Wireless Smart Gluco-Monitoring Systems are based on an
electrochemical biosensor technology (electrochemical) and the principle of capillary
action. Capillary action at the end of the test strip draws the blood into the action
chamber and the blood glucose result is displayed in 5 seconds.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within run (repeatability) and total (intermediate) precision was evaluated based on
the ISO 15197 guideline.
The repeatability study was performed using heparinized anti- coagulated venous
whole blood (hematocrit ranged from 35% to 50%) spiked to five different glucose
concentrations (30-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-250, 251-400 mg/dL). Each sample was tested
on ten meters using three lots of test strips. For each concentration, ten measurements
were obtained per meter and test strip lot. (N=100 (10 meters x 10 measurements) per
concentration level). Repeatability studies were performed on both BG5 and BG5L
meters. The results are summarized below:

Intermediate precision studies were performed using three levels of control
solutions. iHealth control solutions control solutions, Level I, Level II and Level
III, (45 mg/dL, 120 mg/dL and 320 mg/dL) were tested on ten meters using three
lots of test strips (three meters with each of the three test strip lots) for ten days
(N=100 per concentration level). Studies were performed on both BG5 and BG5L
meters. The results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity study was designed based on CLSI EP6-A guideline.
Ten heparinized venous blood samples were spiked with dextrose covering the range
from 20-600 mg/dL (hematocrit 45%), including 22, 32, 72, 124, 195, 284, 362, 459,
554, and 592 mg/ dL. Glucose concentrations were confirmed by the YSI-2300. The
study was performed using one calibrated meter and one vial of test on 5 replicates
(N=36 per test strip lot). The only difference between the iHealth BG5 and BGL5
Wireless Smart meters is the version of wireless technology (BG5 uses 3.0 and BGL5

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Human factor (user performance) study. A human factors study was conducted with 30
enrolled participants. Participants received a dedicated meter and an iOS device and
lancing device were recruited in the study.
a. Usability: One purpose of the human factor study was to verify that participants with
average education and computer skills and no prior knowledge of the system can
safely and accurately use the new device and the data transmission without direct
instruction or training. Study results demonstrated that participants were able to
transmit results from the meter to the iOS device via Bluetooth technology.
b. Readability: The participants were also asked to complete a questionnaire to evaluate
the ease of use of the device and the clarity of the English language labeling. The
readability of the labeling (user guides and test strip package insert) using a Flesch-
Kincaid analysis were found to be written at the 8th grade level. Overall the users
indicated that they could successfully perform the test and that the user manual was
11

--- Page 12 ---
written clearly.
2. IOS device data storage and memory roll over study: To assess the storage of the IOS
device and the memory data rollover function, 10,000 data records were input into IOS
device. The integrity of the stored data was confirmed by the data in BG5 glucose meters
with 100% accuracy. The study demonstrated that the new data will replace the existed
data orderly after the memory area room is full.
3. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing was performed/ passed and a certificate was
provided.
4. Hematocrit study. Evaluated in k120813.
5. Altitude Study. Evaluated in k120813.
6. Temperature and Relative Humidity Study. Evaluated in k120813.
7. Sample Volume Study. Evaluated in k120813.
8. Infection control: Candidate devices consist of same materials as the devices cleared
under k110017. See k110017 for disinfection efficacy study information. Robustness
studies were performed by the sponsor for this current submission demonstrating that
there was no change in performance or external materials for each of the meters and
lancing device after 11,000 cycles (each cycle contained pre-cleaning and disinfection
steps) with the CaviWipes. The robustness studies were designed to simulate 5 years of
single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated
cleaning and disinfection procedures.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
