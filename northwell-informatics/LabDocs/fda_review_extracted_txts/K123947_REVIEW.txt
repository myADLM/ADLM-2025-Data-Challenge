L. Test Principle:
Sample, anti- vancomycin coated paramagnetic microparticles, and vancomycin acridinium-
labeled conjugate are combined to create a reaction mixture. The anti-vancomycin coated
microparticles bind to vancomycin present in the sample and to the Vancomycin acridinium-
labeled conjugate. After washing, pre-trigger and trigger solutions are added to the reaction
mixture. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as relative light units (RLUs).
An indirect relationship exists between the amount of vancomycin in the sample and the
RLUs detected by the ARCHITECT i System optics.

Following CLSI EP5-A2, the sponsor evaluated precision using two lots of reagents, three
levels of Multi-Constituent Controls (MCC Level 1, MCC Level 2, MCC Level 3) and four
serum panels prepared by adding vancomycin into a pool of human sera to obtain desired
concentration of vancomycin. Precision tests were carried out on two ARCHITECT i2000SR
systems with three replicates per run, two runs per day over 20 days (total of 120 data points
per instrument per reagent lot). The results are tabulated below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor conducted a recovery study using eight levels of spiked samples covering the
measurement range. Five samples per spiked level were prepared by adding reference
standard vancomycin into a pool of human sera to obtain desired concentration of
vancomycin and tested in replicates of 3 using one lot of reagents on one ARCHITECT
i2000SR instrument. The overall % recovery for each spiked level was determined and
evaluated for acceptance. The results are tabulated below. Additional recovery information
at low levels is shown in the LoQ study (see below).

3.2 86.4%
5.0 98.0%
7.5 102.8%
10 104.4%
15 105.4%
20 104.4%
30 101.5%
45 99.1%
The sponsor also conducted studies on one i2000SR instrument to support linearity by
preparing three high pools, which were diluted with normal human serum to ranging from
levels below 3 to above 50 μg/mL vancomycin. Each set of samples from the same dilution
series was tested within a run in 4 replicates at each dilution level. The results supported a
linear range of 3.0 μg/mL – 50.0 μg/mL for ARCHITECT iVancomycin assay.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrators were previously cleared under k072036. See k072036 for more information.
d. Detection Limits:
Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Detection (LoQ) were
determined based on CLSI guideline EP17-A as described below:
Limit of Blank (LoB):
A total of 160 replicates of 4 zero-level Normal Human Serum (NHS) samples were tested
over 3 days in 5 runs using 2 reagent lots and 2 instruments. The results were ordered
according to their values and the 95th percentile of the zero-level samples concentration level
was deemed as LoB level. The sponsor claimed the LoB = 0.27 μg/mL.

Limit of Detection (LoD):
A panel of 8 low level samples was tested over 3 days in 5 runs using 2 reagent lots and 2
instruments. The low level samples were prepared by diluting low vancomycin serum sample
(23.88 μg/mL) with NHS sample to achieve concentrations of 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0
and 3.5 μg/mL. LOD was determined using the algorithm: LoD = LoB + {1.645 / [1-1/(4 x
df)]}x SD, where SD is the standard deviation for the lowest level sample that has ≥95%
replicate results greater than LoB level. The sponsor claimed the LoD = 0.42 μg/mL.
Limit of Detection (LoQ):
Observed total error was calculated for the 8 low level samples (described in LoD study) as
Total Error = %Bias + 2x%CV. The LoQ study results supports the sponsor’s claimed lower
limit of 3.0 μg/mL. Results of precision and bias estimations for samples at the claimed
lower limit are shown below:
Target Mean % bias % CV % total error
3.00 3.05 1.5 6.8 15.1
e. Analytical specificity:
Following CLSI document EP7-A2, the sponsor evaluated the effect of known endogenous
interferents on Architect i2000SR System using one lot of reagents. The interferents and the
test range included triglycerides (2500 mg/dL), hemoglobin (500 mg/dL), protein (12 g/dL),
and bilirubin (20 mg/dL). Four human serum samples with Vancomycin concentrations
targeted at 5, 10, 25, and 40 μg/mL were used to prepare the interfering panel. These human
serum samples were spiked with the interferent for the test sample. Three normal human
serum samples were spiked with vancomycin at target concentrations 5, 10, 20, 40 and 45
μg/mL and were used to prepare interfering panels for RF (500 IU/mL) and HAMA (1000
ng/mL). An equal volume of interferent diluent was spiked into the samples to prepare the
control sample. The results demonstrated no interference from potential interferents tested at
the concentrations shown below based on the Sponsor’s criteria of % recovery within 100% ±
10%.
Bilirubin up to 20 mg/dL
Hemoglobin up to 400 mg/dL
Triglycerides up to 2500 mg/dL
Protein up to 12 g/dL
HAMA up to 1000 ng/mL
Rheumatoid Factor up to 500 IU/mL
Potential interfering therapeutics were tested with ARCHITECT iVancomycin assay for
interference at a concentration of 500 μg/mL (exceptions: crystalline degradation product-1
(CDP-1) tested at 50 μg/mL, Methotrexate tested at 227μg/mL). Four human serum samples
with Vancomycin concentrations targeted at 0, 7, 35, and 45 μg/mL were prepared with and
without the potential cross-reactants and tested in replicates of 25 in a single run.

The drugs listed above (except for CDP-1 and isoniazid) at the concentrations tested
demonstrated no interference using the Sponsor’s criteria of %recovery within 100% ± 10%:
· CDP-1 at ≥5 μg/mL interferes with samples containing vancomycin in the
measurement range;
· Isoniazid at >300 μg/mL interferes with samples containing vancomycin in the
measurement range.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To further demonstrate substantial equivalence to the predicate device, the sponsor
conducted a method comparison study with 120 neat human serum samples over 3 days
using two lots of the candidate ARCHITECT iVancomycin Reagent, and one lot of predicate
ARCHITECT iVancomycin Reagent (k072036). 107 samples that were within the measuring
range for each assay were used for calculations. Passing & Bablok regression and bias
analyses were provided. Results are summarized below:
Candidate ARCHITECT iVancomycin (Y) vs. Predicate ARCHITECT iVancomycin (X)
Linear regression: Y=1.04X -0.23; r=0.99, N=107. Samples range from 7.3 to 47.5 μg/mL.
A bias analysis of candidate ARCHITECT iVancomycin vs. predicate ARCHITECT
iVancomycin performed on the 107 samples exhibited an average bias of 3.0% (95% CI: 2.1
to 4.0%).
b. Matrix comparison:
The sponsor conducted matrix comparison studies and concluded that serum and five kinds of
plasma tubes (K -EDTA, Na-Citrate, Na-Fluoride/K-Oxalate, Li-Heparin and Na-Heparin) as
2
acceptable specimen collection tubes in their PI. Recoveries for each tube type were
compared with serum tubes at concentrations across the assay ranging from 3.2 to 45 μg/mL.
Recoveries at each level were within the Sponsor’s criterion of 100% ±10% recovery for each
tube type.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
In the labeling, the sponsor states:
As supported by literature*, therapeutic peak serum levels of 20 to 40 μg/mL and trough
levels of 5 to 10 μg/mL have been reported to be effective for most strains of staphylococci
and streptococci. The sponsor recommends in the labeling that users establish the therapeutic
levels of vancomycin based on patient differences and bacterial susceptibility. For diagnostic
purposes, the test findings should always be assessed in conjunction with the patient’s
medical history, clinical examinations, and other findings.
