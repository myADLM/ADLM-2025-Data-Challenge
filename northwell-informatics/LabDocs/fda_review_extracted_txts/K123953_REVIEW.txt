coupled enzymatic reaction (phosphoenol-pyruvate carboxylase and malate
dehydrogenase), which converts the reduced NADH analog cofactor substrate to the
oxidized NAD+ analog product. The reduced cofactor absorbs strongly at 408 nm,
whereas its oxidized form does not. The rate of decrease in absorbance in the reaction
cuvette is proportional to the carbon dioxide content of the sample.
ACE Direct Bilirubin test:
The ACE Direct Bilirubin test is based on a photometric test. Sodium nitrite, added to
sulfanilic acid, forms diazotized sulfanilic acid. Bilirubin glucuronide in serum reacts
with diazotized sulfanilic acid to form azobilirubin, which absorbs strongly at 554
nm. The increase in absorbance, one minute after sample addition, is directly
proportional to the direct bilirubin concentration in the sample..
ACE Total Bilirubin test:
The ACE Total Bilirubin test is based on a photometric test. Sodium nitrite, added to
sulfanilic acid, forms diazotized sulfanilic acid. Bilirubin glucuronide in serum reacts
with diazotized sulfanilic acid to form azobilirubin, which absorbs strongly at 554
nm. The increase in absorbance, five minutes after sample addition, is directly
proportional to the total bilirubin concentration in the sample.
ACE Magnesium test:
The ACE Magnesium test is based on a photometric test. Magnesium ions in serum
react with xylidyl blue-1 in an alkaline medium to produce a red complex. The
intensity of color produced is directly proportional to the magnesium concentration in
the sample. EGTA prevents calcium interference by preferential chelation of calcium
present in the sample. A surfactant system is included to remove protein interference.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were conducted in house and at three Physician Office
Laboratories (POL) with trained operators typically found in these
settings, following CLSI guidance document EP5-A2. Three samples
each of low, mid and high analyte serum were run on the ACE Alera
Clinical Chemistry System in duplicate, for 5 days at 2 runs per day
(N=40). Results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Serum samples were spiked with the appropriate analyte and used to
determine linearity on the ACE Alera Clinical Chemistry System. The
assigned values of the highest and lowest sample were set to their
mean values. The assigned values of the other levels were calculated
by multiplying the mean value by the dilution ratios obtained from the
manufacturer. Each level was tested in triplicate. The linear regression
correlation between the expected values and the measured values for
the CO2 and Mg assays is summarized below:

spiked with high concentrations of magnesium and were then either run
directly on each of the ACE systems or they were manually diluted 1:3 using
system diluent (3 samples per instrument system in triplicate). The results

ACE systems, were compared. All samples recovered within +/-8% bias.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: CO2 method is traceable to NIST SRM 351. Total Bilirubin
assay is traceable to NIST SRM 916. Direct Bilirubin assay is traceable to
gravimetric standards prepared with NIST material. Magnesium method is
traceable to NIST SRM 909.
The CO2 standard was previously cleared under k854544. The Direct
Bilirubin, Total Bilirubin and Magnesium assay is calibrated using the
Gemcal Reference Serum previously cleared under k844344.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantification
(LoQ) were determined according to CLSI EP17-A with the ACE Alera
Clinical Chemistry System. For the LoB and LoD studies, low samples and
true blanks (n=60 reps, 20 reps per day) were tested over three days on two
ACE Alera Clinical Chemistry Systems. For the LoQ studies, samples (n = 40
reps, 8 reps per run) were tested in five separate runs over five days. LoQ
based on inter-assay precision of 20% CV. The results are as follows:
Analyte LoB LoD LoQ

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed to determine the effects from potential
interferents. The various concentration of interferent was spiked into serum pools
containing analytes at normal and abnormal concentrations. All samples were
tested in triplicate. Six interferent levels and the control samples were tested for
each interferent. Bias greater than +/- 10% defines significant interference by the
sponsor. The results of the highest concentration tested without significant
interference are as follows:

Since hemolysis affects Total Bili. and Direct Bili. results, the sponsor
has the following limitations in the labeling:
“Specimens showing any indication of hemolysis should not be
analyzed.”

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were completed at 3 POC sites following
CLSI document EP9-A2. Samples were run on the ACE Clinical
Chemistry System at Alfa Wassermann and the results were compared
against those gathered on ACE Alera Clinical Chemistry Systems at 3
Physician Office Labs. At least 40 determinations were made in
singlicate for serum samples drawn from the same individuals on each
platform. To test across the assay reportable ranges, additional sets (<
6 sets) of altered samples (spiked or diluted) were used to cover the
full measuring range of each analyte. Results are summarized in the
table below:
