Approved Guideline (C28-A3c)
.L. Test Principle:
The Randox Liquid CK-MB is an immunoinhibition assay. The CK reagent contains an
antibody to the M subunit of CK-MB which inhibits the M subunit activity. Thus, only the
activity of the B subunit is measured. The activity is multiplied by 2 yielding the activity of
CK-MB in the sample.
The R1 reagent contains anti CK-MM antibody (mouse monoclonal) which binds the M
subunit of CK in the serum sample thereby inhibiting the activity of the CK- M subunit. The
CK-B activity is determined by the CK NAC method.
CK
Creatine phosphate + ADP Creatine + ATP
HK
Glucose + ATP Glucose-6-P + ADP
G-6-PDH
Glucose-6-P + NADP+ Gluconate-6-P + NADPH + H+
The rate of increase of absorbance at 340/700 nm due to the formation of NADPH is directly
proportional to the activity of CK in the sample and if the activity is multiplied by a factor of
two it will give the activity of CK-MB in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed using control material and five spiked serum pools
for CKMB. Testing was conducted in duplicate for 20 days with two runs per day
(N=80) using one reagent lot on the RX Daytona and RX Imola. No recalibrations
were performed during the study. The results are summarized in the following tables.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies were conducted following the sponsor’s internal protocol and
acceptance criteria and in accordance with CLSI document EP06-A. Two pools were
used to assess the linearity of the assay used. The two pools of CK-MB stripped
human serum were spiked with CK-MB and diluted to obtain 11 equally distributed
levels with expected values of 7.00-2200 U/L for the RX Daytona and 6.0-1100 U/L
for the RX Imola. Based on the data, linearity across the measuring range for each
analyzer is summarized below:
Instrument Slope Intercept Syx r Measuring Range
Daytona 1.02 -1.27 26.56 0.99 7-2000 U/L
Imola 0.97 3.20 8.17 1.00 6-1100 U/L
Recovery studies demonstrated that the measuring range can be extended up to
10,200 U/L CK-MB for the RX Daytona and Imola analyzers to within ± 10% of the
CK-MB concentration.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Randox CK-MB calibrators have in-house traceability.
Calibrator value assignment and stability:
Value assignment for calibrator:
A mean value for new lots of the CK-MB calibrator are established by performing
nested testing of the new calibrator lot against a master lot. Values for the new lot
must meet the pre-determined acceptance criteria for the device. New master lots of
calibrators are evaluated against the previous master lot and values must fall within
the sponsor’s predetermined acceptance criteria.
CK-MB calibrator shelf life stability was evaluated in real time at 2-8° C and -75 to -
90° C. The CK-MB calibrator once reconstituted, is stable in serum for 5 days at
6

+4oC, 8 hours at +25oC and 4 weeks at -20oC when frozen once. All data and
protocols were found to be acceptable to support the stability claims above.
Reagent stability:
The Randox Liquid CK-MB reagent components (CK-MB buffer and CK-MB
substrate) are ready for use. Based on real time and accelerated studies proved the
reagents contained are stable up to 12 months when stored unopened at +2 to +8o C
and are stable for 28 days at +10 o C on board the RX Daytona and RX Imola. All
data and protocols were found to be acceptable to support the stability claims above.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB.), a Limit of Detection (LoD.) and a Limit of Quantification
(LoQ) studies were performed in accordance with CLSI guideline EP17-A .on the RX
Daytona and RX Imola systems. The LoB study analyzed 60 saline samples.
Determination of the LoB was based on the 95th percentile for the results. Stripped
human serum, spiked with CK-MB was used to perform the LoD and LoQ studies.
The LoD study analyzed 60 samples with CK-MB values ranging from 1-4 U/L.
Results were analyzed according to recommendations in CLSI EP-17A. The LoQ
was determined to be the lowest concentration sample across 5 runs that had a %CV
of ≤ 20% and a % deviation to the spiked target of ≤ 20%. The studies yielded the
following results:
LoB LoD LoQ
Daytona 2.90 U/L 5.06 U/L 7.00 U/L
Imola 0.87 U/L 2.40 U/L 6.00 U/L
The low ends of the measuring ranges for the RX Daytona and RX Imola CK-MB
assay are based on the LoQ for each analyzer.
e. Analytical specificity:
Common endogenous interfering substances were evaluated in accordance with CLSI
Guideline EP7-A2. Human serum samples at approximate CK-MB concentrations of
20 U/L and 400 U/L were spiked with various concentrations of interferents and
evaluated in triplicate at each interferent level. Absolute bias was calculated at each
concentration level as compared with non-spiked human serum.
At a given concentration, a compound was defined as causing significant interference
if it caused a >±10% difference when compared to the sample negative for the
interfering compound. CK-MB was evaluated at 20 U/L and the 400 U/L. No
interference was observed with the exception of Intralipid. Results are summarized
