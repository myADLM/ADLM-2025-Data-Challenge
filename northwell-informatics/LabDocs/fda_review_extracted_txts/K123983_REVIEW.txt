L. Test Principle:
The FastPack® Vitamin D Immunoassay is a paramagnetic particle
chemiluminescence immunoassay based on the “competitive” principle. The
endogenous vitamin D in the sample is mixed with the pretreatment buffer, and added
to the pack. The mixture is then incubated with a monoclonal anti-vitamin D
antibody labeled with the alkaline phosphatase. The vitamin D in the pre-treated
patient sample (or control or calibrator) reacts with the antibody. This
immunoreactant complex is then incubated with the second reagent containing
vitamin D covalently coupled to biotin that is pre-bound to streptavidin-coated
paramagnetic particles. The antibody-alkaline phosphatase conjugate not reacted
with the sample will bind to the unoccupied binding sites of the vitamin D-biotin-
streptavidin coated paramagnetic particles. After the second incubation, the
paramagnetic particles are repeatedly washed with wash buffer to remove unbound
materials. The bound labeled-antibody to the paramagnetic beads is detected by
adding the chemiluminogenic substrate. The resulting “glow” chemiluminescence is
measured on the FastPack® Analyzer. The amount of bound labeled-antibody is
inversely proportional to the concentration of vitamin D in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility Study:
Precision of the FastPack Vitamin D immunoassay was evaluated according to
CLSI EP5-A2 guideline. Four spiked serum samples (approximately 25, 30,
45 and 80 ng/mL) were tested in duplicate determinations in each of two runs
per day on each of two FastPack analyzers, each paired with an individual
reagent lot over a period of 20 days to yield 160 replicates of each sample
(N=80 on each analyzer/reagent pair). The results are tabulated below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range Study:
Linearity of the FastPack Vitamin D assay was evaluated according to CLSI
EP6-A. A high serum sample pool with pre-assigned value of 165.2 ng/mL
was tested neat and mixed in various dilution ratios with a low serum sample
pool with an estimated value of 10.0 ng/mL (below LoQ) to make a total of
nine samples for testing the linearity of the assay. All samples were run in
duplicate on one FastPack instrument using one lot of FastPack reagents and
one FastPack calibrator lot. The linear regression equation yielded a slope of
0.9798, intercept of 4.5 and regression coefficient R2 of 0.9973 for the
measured sample range from 11.3 to 165.2 ng/mL. The result of the study
supports the sponsor’s claim that the assay is linear across the measuring
range of 12.9 to 150 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The in-house reference standards are traceable to the predicate method
(DiaSorin LIAISON® 25-Hydroxy Vitamin D TOTAL Assay).
Preparation of in-house reference standard solutions:
In-house reference standards are prepared from delipidated human serum
which is spiked with an ethanolic solution of commercially available vitamin
D3 (certified to be ≥98% pure as verified by HPLC), in order to produce nine
concentration levels ranging from 0 to 190ng/mL.
Value Assignment:
A method comparison was performed using 86 patient samples between
FastPack and DiaSorin LIAISON® 25-Hydroxy Vitamin D TOTAL Assay
(Predicate Device). The resulting FastPack RLUs were fitted to DiaSorin
LIAISON concentration values using 4 parameter logistic curve fit. This
curve was then used to value assign the in-house reference standards which

were tested using multiple lots of FastPack Vitamin D reagent on multiple
FastPack Analyzers.
Master Curve Generation:
During the FastPack reagent pack production process, Qualigen generates a
master standard curve and places this information in the barcode of each
FastPack label, where it can be read by the FastPack Analyzer during the
testing sequence. The assay master curve is generated by testing 9 levels of
reference standards. Each level is tested in multiple replicates on multiple
FastPack Analyzers. The resulting values are normalized against a reference
calibrator target value. The mean of the normalized RLUs from multiple
analyzers is then curve fit against the standard concentrations using standard
curve fitting math model.
FastPack® Vitamin D Calibrator Kit:
The value assignments of the in-house reference calibrators are based on an
internal procedure using an in-house reference standard (traceable to HPLC
for purity assessment) to make 9 concentrations. The factory calibration
information is provided in the calibration card that is provided with the
calibrator kit. Only one level of calibrator (zero level) is provided in the
calibrator kit, and the user must calibrate the assay with this calibrator once
every 21 days or whenever a new lot of FastPack Vitamin D immunoassay
reagent packs are to be used.
FastPack® Vitamin D Control Kit and Method Verification Kit:
Controls and verifiers are value assigned using an internal procedure with
multiple replicates run on multiple instruments using multiple lots of reagent.
The average concentration values of the results are used to establish the
control target value. The expected range for the two controls is: Control 1, 14
to 40 ng/mL; Control 2, 39 to 91 ng/mL. The Verifier assigned values are:
Low verifier, <12.9 ng/mL; Mid verifier, target range is 75±10 ng/mL; High
verifier, ≥150 ng/mL.
Stability:
Shelf-life and open-vial stability for the calibrator, controls and verifiers are
based on real-time stability study and is still on-going. Shelf-life claim for the
calibrator, controls and verifiers is 90 days when stored at 2-8oC. Open-vial
stability for the calibrator is 60 days and control is 30 days when stored at 2-
8oC. There is no open-vial claim for the verifiers since they are intended for
single use. Stability study protocols and acceptance criteria has been
reviewed and found to be adequate.
d. Detection limit Study:
The LoB, LoD, and LoQ were determined according to protocols in CLSI EP-
17A.
LoB was determined based on 160 replicates of a blank sample (10 replicates
8

--- Page 9 ---
on each of eight different FastPack analyzers using 2 lots of FastPack reagents
and a single FastPack Calibrator lot). Blank sample used was a delipidated
Vit D-free human serum. LoB is determined to be 2.3 ng/mL.
LoD was determined to be 6.2 ng/mL.
LoD and LoQ was determined using four low-level samples formulated by
mixture of a patient sample pool with the blank sample (delipidated Vitamin
D-free human serum) to yield target concentrations of 2.1, 5.6, 11.8 and 15.4
ng/mL of Vitamin D. Each sample were tested in replicates of ten on three
FastPack analyzers using two lots of FastPack reagents and a single FastPack
calibrator lot (N=60 per sample). The %CV was calculated for all four low
samples tested. From the plot of the observed Vitamin D concentrations
versus the %CV obtained, the LoQ is estimated to be 12.9 ng/mL with
20%CV.
The sponsor claims that the 25-OH Vitamin D assay has a measuring range of
12.9 to 150 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity Study:
Serum sample pools at ~30 and ~60 ng/mL were tested without and with two
levels of various potentially cross-reacting compounds. Each sample was
tested in triplicate on one FastPack instrument with one lot of FastPack
reagents and one FastPack calibrator lot. The results are presented in the table

mouse antibodies (HAMA). Such specimens may show either falsely elevated
or depressed values when tested with assay kits employing mouse monoclonal
antibodies.”
“Heterophilic antibodies in a sample have the potential to cause interference
in immunoassay systems. Infrequently, vitamin D levels may appear depressed
or elevated due to heterophilic antibodies present in the patient’s sample or to
nonspecific protein binding. If the vitamin D level is inconsistent with clinical
evidence, additional vitamin D testing is suggested to confirm the result.”

Not applicable – this is a quantitative assay.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison study was conducted to evaluate the performance of
FastPack Vitamin D immunoassay compared to the predicate device, DiaSorin
LIAISON® 25-Hydroxy Vitamin D TOTAL Assay. Serum samples (all
natural) from 137 subjects tested singlet were used in the study. Deming
regression was performed. The results are presented below:
Parameter Results
Slope (95% CI) 0.97 (0.88 to 1.06)
y-intercept (95% CI) -4.6 (-8.9 to -0.25)
R (95% CI) 0.92 (0.90 to 0.94)
Sample range tested 18.6 to132.6 ng/mL
b. Matrix comparison:
Blood samples from 32 volunteers were processed in parallel to collect serum,
lithium-heparin plasma and EDTA plasma. The samples were tested in
duplicate on two FastPack analyzers using one lot of reagents, calibrator and
controls using the FastPack Vitamin D immunoassay. Deming regression was
performed to compare a) serum and EDTA plasma, and b) serum and lithium-
heparin plasma values. The Deming regression results are presented below:

5. Expected values/Reference range:
A reference range study was performed using serum samples from 367 subjects.
The samples were acquired from four different sources representing five different
geographic regions of US. Sampling took place during four months that covered
late Winter to early Summer, representing a range of exposure to sunlight and
weather conditions. The inclusion criteria were age (21 to 90 years) and good
health. The exclusion criteria included Vitamin D supplementation of ≥ 2000
IU/day, family history of parathyroid disease, thyroid disease or calcium
regulatory disease, current/previous history of kidney, GI, liver, calcium-level,
thyroid, or parathyroid disease, current/previous history of seizures, chronic
disease, or bariatic surgery, and current medications including cholesterol
absorption inhibitors, anticonvulsants, glucocorticoids, and anti-rejection
medications. Subjects ranged in age from 21 to 88 years, skin pigmentations from
dark to medium to light, and gender (Female, 40.3% and Male, 59.7%). Based on
the study, the central 95th range of the expected Vitamin D values for adults is
13.7 to 57.3 ng/mL.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
