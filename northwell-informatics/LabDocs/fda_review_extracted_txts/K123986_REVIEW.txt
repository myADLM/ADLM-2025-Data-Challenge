K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
No standards are referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The Actim PROM test is based on immunochromatography and utilizes two mouse
monoclonal antibodies to human insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1).
One of the two antibodies is bound to blue latex particles (the detecting label). The other
antibody is immobilized as a test line on the membrane (capture antibody). The test strip
(dipstick) is composed of the sample/conjugate pad, the membrane with test and control
lines, and the absorbent pad assembled between plastic films. The upper film contains a test
window.
When the sample area of the dipstick is placed in an extracted sample, the dipstick absorbs
liquid, which starts to flow up the dipstick. If the sample contains IGFBP-1 it binds to the
antibody labeled with latex particles. The particles are carried by the liquid flow and, if
IGFBP-1 is bound to them, they bind to the capture antibody. A blue line (test line) will
appear in the result area if the concentration of IGFBP-1 in the sample exceeds the detection
limit of the test. A second blue line, the procedural control line, confirms correct operator
performance of the test.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility was evaluated at three POC test sites with three different
operators per site (total of nine operators). Test panels were prepared containing
samples of 0, 5, 12.5, 20, 25, 30, 50 and 100 μg/L of IGFBP-1 in Specimen
Extraction Solution. The test panel compositions were masked to the operators. Each
operator tested one test panel per day on five different days. Test results were
interpreted as positive, negative, or invalid; no invalid tests were observed. The
results are shown below. Based on these results (as well as the detection limit study
in Section d, below) all results are positive at the Sponsor’s claimed detection level of
25 ug/L.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Data supporting linearity testing to validate the measuring range of 25 – 500,000 μg/L
was submitted in k061886.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: This device is traceable to a primary IGFBP-1 purified from soluble
extracts of human term placenta/decidua.
Stability: Shelf life stability studies were performed to expand previous shelf life
stability claims (k061886). Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and
deemed acceptable to support the expanded shelf life of 24 months at 36-77 °F for
test kit.
d. Detection limit:
A study to establish the detection limit was conducted incorporating masked and
randomized samples, two operators, and two lighting conditions. Test panels of 0, 2,
5, 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 μg/L of IGFBP-1 were prepared by diluting internal controls
(prepared from purified pooled amniotic fluid) with Specimen Extraction Solution.
Test panels were blind coded, and one test panel was used for each of the two

operators in the study. Three different lots of Actim PROM tests were used for
testing. Both operators read the test panels under different lighting conditions,
laboratory lamp and daylight. Ten replicates per sample per test panel were tested on
each lot of Actim PROM for a total of 60 replicates per sample. The percent
agreement was calculated for each lot, lighting condition, and operator. The results
are summarized below.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed by preparing swab samples containing each
potential interferent. Each sample was then extracted into one of three test tubes of
Specimen Extraction Solution containing negative, high negative and positive levels
of IGFBP-1, respectively. Three replicates of each IGFBP-1 concentration level per
product were tested and the results were read by two operators. The following drugs,
shower and bath products, odor control products, and vaginal pathogens were tested
with the Actim PROM test and were found not to affect test performance.

In addition, samples with pH levels ranging from 3.5-8.5 were tested with the Actim
PROM test and were found not to affect test performance. Semen, pregnancy urine,
and whole blood with concentrations corresponding to typical pregnancy levels of
IGFBP-1 were also tested with the Actim PROM test and were found not to affect test
performance.
The sponsor included the following limitation in their labeling regarding blood
interference:
“The test has been designed to minimize interference from bleeding, but in cases of
heavy bleeding the blood locally may have a higher concentration of IGFBP-1
protein. In these cases, a positive result should be interpreted with caution.”

gestational age and to evaluate the clinical performance of the test with specimens
collected with or without the use of a speculum. Conventional clinical criteria,
including visual detection of amniotic fluid leaking from the cervical os, nitrazine
test, visual pooling of fluid in the posterior fornix, and microscopic evidence of
ferning, collected by performing a diagnostic speculum examination for ROM were
utilized as the gold standard.
Device performance was compared to clinical diagnostic criteria for ROM on 222
vaginal swab subject samples collected without a speculum and 220 vaginal swab
subject samples collected with a speculum (two sample tests were considered invalid ,
no control line appeared and insufficient sample remained to repeat the testing). Of
the 222 subjects, 97 were between 29 and 34 weeks gestational age and the remainder
were >34 weeks gestational age. The overall and stratified (by gestational age and
sample collection with/without speculum) results are summarized below.
