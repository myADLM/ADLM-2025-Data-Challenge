I. Device Description:
The Quidel Molecular Direct C. difficile Assay is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test for the
direct rapid detection of toxigenic Clostridium difficile toxin A gene (tcdA) or toxin B gene
(tcdB) from stool samples of patients suspected of having Clostridium difficile-Associated
Diarrhea (CDAD). The Quidel Molecular Direct C. difficile Assay utilizes proprietary sample
preparation and Real-time PCR to detect the amplified DNA from patient specimens. A
multiplex, real-time PCR reaction is performed under optimized conditions in a single tube/well
generating amplicons for each of the targets present in the specimen. Identification occurs by the
use of oligonucleotide primers and probes that are complementary to conserved regions in the
tcdA and tcdB genes of the pathogenicity locus (PaLoc).
A swab is used to transfer a small amount of specimen into a process buffer tube (PB1). The
diluted sample is then transferred into a second process buffer tube (PB2) which contains the
assay’s process control (PRC). The processed specimen is then combined with rehydrated master
mix in either a reaction tube or plate well. The Master Mix contains oligonucleotide primers,
fluorophore and quencher-labeled probes targeting conserved regions of the tcdA and tcdB as
well as the process control sequence. The reaction tubes or plate is then placed into either the
Applied Biosystems® 7500 Fast Dx instrument, the Life Technologies QuantStudio™ Dx Real-
Time PCR system, or the Cepheid SmartCycler® II instrument.
Once the reaction tube or plate is added to the instrument, the Quidel Molecular Direct C.
difficile Assay protocol is initiated. This assay is based on Taqman® chemistry, and uses an
enzyme with DNA polymerase, and 5’-3’ exonuclease activities. During DNA amplification, this
enzyme cleaves the probe bound to the complementary DNA sequence, separating the quencher
dye from the reporter dye. This step generates an increase in fluorescent signal upon excitation
by a light source of the appropriate wavelength. With each cycle, additional dye molecules are
separated from their quenchers resulting in an increase in the fluorescent signal. If sufficient
fluorescence is achieved, the sample is reported as positive for the detected nucleic acid.

L. Test Principle:
The Quidel Molecular Direct C. difficile Assay is a rapid, in vitro diagnostic test for the
qualitative detection of C. difficile DNA directly from unformed (liquid or soft) stool
specimens of patients suspected of having Clostridium difficile-Associated Disease (CDAD).
The assay detects nucleic acids that have been prepared from a patient sample using
proprietary sample preparation. A multiplex real-time PCR reaction is performed under
optimized conditions in a single tube/well generating amplicons for each of the targets
present in the sample. Identification occurs by the use of oligonucleotide primers and probes
that are complementary to conserved regions in the tcdA and tcdB genes of the pathogenicity
locus (PaLoc).
A neonatal flocked swab is dipped into a liquid or soft stool specimen from a pediatric or
adult patient suspected of having CDAD. The swab is twirled in the first process buffer tube
(PB1); 30 µL of the processed sample is then added to the second process buffer tube (PB2)
which contains the process control (PRC). Separately, the lyophilized Master Mix is
rehydrated using the Rehydration Solution; the Master Mix contains oligonucleotide primers,
fluorophore and quencher-labeled probes targeting conserved regions of the tcdA and tcdB as
well as the process control sequence. A 15 µL portion of the rehydrated Master Mix is then
placed into each reaction tube or well. To each tube/well is added 5 µL of prepared
specimen (i.e., the processed specimen in the PB2 tube with the PRC). The tube/plate is then
placed into the Life Technologies QuantStudio® Dx Real-Time PCR system, the Applied
Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx instrument, or Cepheid SmartCycler® II instrument. Once the
reaction tube or plate is added to the instrument, the Quidel Molecular Direct C. difficile
Assay protocol is initiated. This assay is based on Taqman® chemistry.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Quidel Molecular Direct C. difficile Assay incorporates a process control which
is included in the second process buffer tube (PB2) and is used to monitor sample
processing and evaluate the presence of inhibitory substances. The process control
confirms the integrity of assay reagents and detection. Additional controls are
performed in accordance with end user laboratory guidelines and requirements.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity (limit of detection or LoD) of the Quidel Molecular Direct
C. difficile Assay was determined on each instrument using quantified (CFU/mL)
cultures of two C. difficile strains (ATCC BAA-1870 and ATCC BAA-1872) and
serially diluted in a negative fecal matrix. Analytical sensitivity (LoD) is defined as
the lowest concentration at which 95% of all replicates tested positive. Serial
dilutions of the strains were tested and the putative LoD confirmed with 60 replicates.

2 to 3X LoD in negative specimen matrix using three different lots; this experiment
was conducted on the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx instrument. Strains were
reported to originate from at least five states and four countries (USA, Belgium,
France and Sweden). Seven (7) toxinotypes were represented: 0, IIIb, IIIc, IV, V,
VIII and XXIII. The analytical reactivity testing conducted demonstrated that the
Quidel Molecular Direct C. difficile Assay can detect a broad range of toxigenic
Clostridium difficile strains at 2-3X LoD.

f. Analytical Specificity
The analytical specificity of the Quidel Molecular Direct C. difficile Assay was
evaluated by testing a panel consisting of 66 bacterial, viral and yeast
microorganisms, and human DNA representing common enteric pathogens, flora,
and/or nucleic acid commonly present in the intestine (see table below).
Microorganisms or nucleic acid was mixed with pooled negative matrix and tested
directly; this experiment was conducted on the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx
instrument. Bacteria were tested at concentrations greater than 1.0E+06 CFU/mL and
viruses at greater than 1.0E+05 PFU/mL. In addition, in silico analysis showed that
the Quidel Molecular Direct C. difficile Assay had no predicted cross-reactivity for C.
botulinum. The results of this study demonstrate that the Quidel Molecular Direct C.
difficile Assay does not cross-react with medically relevant levels of viruses or
bacteria found in stool specimens.

g. Microbial Interference:
Microbial interference of the Quidel Molecular Direct C. difficile Assay was
evaluated by testing a panel consisting of 66 bacterial, viral and yeast
microorganisms, and human DNA representing common enteric pathogens, flora,
and/or nucleic acid commonly present in the intestine (see table above).
Microorganisms or nucleic acid was mixed with pooled negative matrix and tested in
the presence of 2 to 3x LoD level of C. difficile; this experiment was conducted on
the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx instrument. Two different strains of C. difficile
were used in this study (see table below). Bacteria were tested at concentrations
greater than 1.0E+06 CFU/mL and viruses at greater than 1.0E+05 PFU/mL. The
results of this study demonstrate that medically relevant levels of viruses or bacteria
found in stool specimens do not interfere with the Quidel Molecular Direct C.
difficile Assay.

i. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
j. Carry-Over & Cross-Contamination Study:
The potential for carry-over and cross-contamination to occur with the Quidel
Molecular Direct C. difficile Assay was evaluated on all three platforms. High
positive specimens were manufactured by using pooled negative stool spiked with C.
difficile bacterial stock at a concentration such that a Ct of 10.0 or lower was
obtained. These specimens were prepared and frozen in aliquots; aliquots were
defrosted prior to the experiment.
For all experiments an unused sterile neonatal flocked swab was used to transfer a
positive sample into a PB1 tube; similarly an unused sterile neonatal flocked swab
was used to transfer a negative sample into a PB1 tube. This process of
manufacturing positive and negative samples was repeated, alternating the creation of
mock positive and negative specimens. In each instance an aliquot was transferred
from each PB1 tube into the appropriate PB2 prior to amplification.
The Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx experiment and the Life Technologies
QuantaStudio Real-Time PCR system experiment each utilized 96 wells per
experiment; the Cepheid SmartCycler II experiment utilized 16 tubes per experiment.
Each experiment was repeated 6 times, and each experiment was carried out on a
different day.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Clinical performance was determined by comparing the Quidel Molecular Direct C.
difficile Assay results to reference culture (i.e., direct culture or enriched toxigenic
culture) followed by cell cytotoxicity testing on the isolates.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable
3. Clinical studies:
Clinical performance characteristics of the Quidel Molecular Direct C. difficile Assay
were determined in a multi-site, prospective investigational study at four geographically
diverse locations within the United States, as well as one internal site. Two clinical
studies were conducted: one study evaluated the ABI 7500 Fast Dx and Cepheid
SmartCycler II (665 specimens), and the second study evaluated the QuantStudio Dx
Real-Time PCR System (792 specimens).

a. Sensitivity and specificity
i Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx
Performance characteristics of the Quidel Molecular Direct C. difficile Assay on the
Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx instrument were established using 665 specimens
collected from patients suspected of having Clostridium difficile-associated disease.
This study was conducted at four distinct geographical sites across the United States.
Specimens were tested with the Quidel Assay on the 7500 Fast Dx at three external
facilities. The tissue culture cytotoxin assay and enhanced toxigenic culture were
performed at a central reference laboratory.
Nine specimens (1.35%) were invalid in the Quidel Molecular Direct C. difficile
Assay when initially tested. Eight specimens yielded a valid result when retested (7
were negative, 1 was positive). One specimen remained invalid upon repeat testing.
Direct Culture Cytotoxicity Assay Comparison
Six hundred sixty-five (665) specimens were tested by both the Quidel Molecular
Direct C. difficile Assay and tissue culture followed by cell cytotoxicity testing on
the isolates. Three specimens (0.5%) were indeterminate in the cytotoxin assay
due to toxicity in the antitoxin well. Nine specimens (1.35%) were invalid in the
Quidel Molecular Direct C. difficile Assay when initially tested on the Applied
Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx instrument. Clinical performance was based on the
initial test result obtained for each specimen (e.g., 665 specimens – 3 cytotoxin
indeterminate – 9 Quidel invalid results = 653 evaluable specimens). Therefore,
the data below summarizes the performance of the Quidel Molecular Direct C.
difficile Assay relative to direct culture using the remaining 653 specimens on the
Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx instrument.
