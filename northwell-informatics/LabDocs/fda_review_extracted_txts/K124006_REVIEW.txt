† Classified in the CFTR2 database as a CF-causing variant, however the supplementary data in the article by Sosnay
et al (2013) classifies these variants as an indeterminate. The database classification is more current and reflects the
completed functional testing and clinical information which was not available at the time of publication.
The assay is designed in two configurations: for 2 runs of up to 96 samples per kit and 20
runs for up to 960 samples per kit. The reagents of each box of the different configurations
are the same and only differ in the number of tubes or consumable items. Each reagent is
designed for single use and the larger configuration contains 10 times as many items as the
number in the smaller kit. The assay components are divided into 7 separate boxes and
include the following components:

L. Test Principle:
The Illumina MiSeqDx Cystic Fibrosis 139-Variant Assay begins with the isolation of
genomic DNA (gDNA) from a peripheral whole blood specimen by routine laboratory
methods. Briefly, gDNA is processed through the library preparation steps, which
specifically amplifies the intended genomic regions of each sample while also adding the
indexes for sample identification. Flow cell capture sequences are also added to the amplified
products. The resulting sample libraries are then transferred into a MiSeqDx reagent
cartridge which contains all of the reagents required for cluster generation and Sequencing by
Synthesis (SBS). The MiSeqDx Cartridge, MiSeqDx Flow Cell, and MiSeqDx SBS Solution
are then inserted into the MiSeqDx instrument, which performs cluster generation,
sequencing and data analysis. All components of the assay are coded with radio-frequency
identifiers (RFID) to assure the proper reagents are used in the assay.

--- Page 9 ---
The Cystic Fibrosis 139-Variant assay protocol involves two main procedures prior to the
data analysis step. The first, library preparation, is to manually prepare the gDNA samples
for sequencing. Library preparation consists of four key steps: Hybridization, Extension-
Ligation, PCR Amplification, and Library Normalization. The second procedure is to
sequence the prepared sample using sequencing by synthesis (SBS) chemistry on the
MiSeqDx instrument.
Library Preparation:
Hybridization: The first step, Hybridization, hybridizes a pool of upstream and
downstream oligonucleotides specific to the MiSeqDx Cystic Fibrosis 139-Variant Assay
to the sample gDNA. At the end of this process, a three-step wash procedure with a filter
capable of size selection removes unbound oligonucleotides from the gDNA.
Extension-Ligation: The second step, Extension-Ligation, connects the hybridized
upstream and downstream oligonucleotides. A DNA polymerase extends from the
upstream oligonucleotides through the targeted region, followed by ligation to the 5’ end
of the downstream oligonucleotide using a DNA ligase. The result is the formation of
products that contain the CF specific oligonucleotides flanked by sequences required for
amplification.
PCR Amplification: The third step, PCR Amplification, amplifies the extension-ligation
products using primers that add index sequences for sample multiplexing, as well as
common adapters required for cluster generation on the MiSeqDx. At the end of this
process, a PCR clean-up procedure using coated magnetic beads and several washing
steps to purify the PCR products (referred to as a library) from unincorporated reaction
components (e.g., PCR primers).
Library Normalization: The final step, Library Normalization, normalizes the quantity of
each library by hybridization of each purified library (from the previous step) to magnetic
beads. The hybridized beads are washed and the bound libraries are eluted. This step
ensures a more equal library representation in the final pooled library. At the end of this
process, the pooled library is loaded onto the MiSeqDx for sequencing using SBS
chemistry.
Sequencing:
The SBS chemistry uses a reversible-terminator method to detect single nucleotide bases
as they are incorporated into growing DNA strands. During each sequencing cycle, a
single fluorescently labeled deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) is added to the nucleic
acid chain. The labeled dNTP serves as a terminator for polymerization. So after each
labeled dNTP is incorporated, the fluorescent dye is imaged to identify the base and then
enzymatically cleaved to allow incorporation of the next nucleotide. Because all four
reversible terminator-bound dNTPs (A, G, T, C) are present as single, separate
molecules, natural competition minimizes incorporation bias. Base calls are made directly
9

--- Page 10 ---
from signal intensity measurements during each sequencing cycle. The end result is base-
by-base sequencing.
Data Analysis:
MiSeq Reporter processes base calls generated during primary analysis and produces
information about each sample based on information specified in the sample sheet, called
secondary analysis. As described below, secondary analysis includes demultiplexing,
FASTQ file generation, alignment, variant calling, and generation of VCF files
containing information about CFTR variants found at specific positions in the reference
genome.
· Demultiplexing: This is the first step in secondary analysis if the sample sheet lists
multiple samples and the run has index reads. Demultiplexing separates data from
pooled samples based upon the unique sequence indexes that were added during the
PCR amplification step.
· FASTQ File Generation: After demultiplexing, MiSeq Reporter generates
intermediate files in the FASTQ format, which is a text format used to represent
sequences. FASTQ files contain the reads for each sample and the quality scores,
excluding reads from any clusters that did not pass filter.
· Alignment: Alignment compares sequences against the reference to identify a
relationship between the sequences and assigns a score based on regions of similarity.
Aligned reads are written to files in BAM format. MiSeq Reporter software uses a
banded Smith-Waterman algorithm that performs local sequence alignments to
determine similar regions between two sequences.
· Variant Calling: This final step records the single nucleotide variants (SNVs),
insertions and deletions (indels), and other structural variants for the specific panel of
variants identified by the assay in a standardized and parsable test file format.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility:
The reproducibility study was performed at 3 external sites by two operators at each
site. Each operator performed a single run per day for 3 non-consecutive days for
each of the two panels of specimens. The two sample panels consisted of ‘mock
blood’ [cultured cell lines spiked into leukocyte-depleted whole blood (LDWB)
specimens to represent blood specimens at normal white blood cell counts) and
gDNA samples isolated from cell lines. A new sample library was prepared for each
run. The variant profiles of the samples were masked to the operators. Panel A was
comprised of 8 mock blood samples and 38 gDNA samples. Panel B was comprised
10

--- Page 11 ---
of 38 gDNA samples for a total of 76 different samples and 522 calls per variant/site.
Positive and negative control samples were included in each run.
The assay software includes internal quality requirements for making both a positive
and wild type call for each kind of variant. The software will make wild type and
variant calls are reported only if they pass the stringent confidence value thresholds
which take into account coverage, base quality score, alignment, etc. The study
resulted in 4 miscalls for F508del/W1282X and F508del/3272‐26A>G, that were
attributed to two (#9 and #10) samples being switched on the plate during the library
preparation step for a single replicate run at site 2. One replicate each for two samples
(#5 and #75) generated a 0% call rate, which resulted in No Calls for all variant and
wild type calls at site #2 during one run. Upon further investigation, it was
determined that the samples were not added when making up the library preparation.
In two instances a No Call was generated for two wild type locations for two samples
(one run in singlicate and one run in duplicate) due to insufficient coverage at that
location.
In order to assess reproducibility for all alleles reported by the assay, a more sequence
specific evaluation of the reproducible accuracy for the bases representing and
surrounding each allele was undertaken. The results of the analysis identified four
samples (#5, #30, #35, and #70) which contained variants not reported by the panel
(i.e., CFTR variants not tested for in the assay panel) or codons that differ from the
reference wild-type (R75Q, R1162L, F508C). These results were assessed for their
accuracy (Table 3), and all alternate variants considered wild type were correctly
identified as such in the study.
Reproducibility is reported as positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent
agreement (NPA), and overall agreement (OA). The results of the reproducibility
study, displayed by panel and sample, are shown in Tables 2 and 3, below.
Homozygous samples are represented with (HOM). Each site generated a total of 810
calls for all samples. Those samples in which Exon 10 variants (I506V, I507V,
F508C) were conditionally reported generated 828 total calls, and those samples
which contained an R117H variant generated 816 total calls. The total number of calls
from this study was 74,556.

* The wild type location corresponding to the N1303K variant for one replicate resulted in a No Call due to
insufficient coverage.
^ One replicate of samples 5 and 75 had a 0% call rate. Further investigation indicates that samples may not have
been added to the sample plate prior to library preparation.
ᵹ Evidence indicates that samples 9 and 10 were likely switched by the operator prior to library preparation.
# The wild type location corresponding to the M1V variant for one replicate of each of two samples resulted in a No
Call due to insufficient coverage.

¥For SNV variants within exons, the codon is reported; for SNV variants within introns, the variant is reported with
two flanking bases; for indel variants, the variant is reported with three flanking bases.
£Alternative WT sequences are non-panel variants which are similar to panel variants but differ by one base (R75X
vs. R75Q). These are identified as WT by the assay.
^Two samples had 0% call rate. Further investigation indicates that samples may not have been added to the sample
plate prior to library preparation
€Variant M1V was not called in two samples
ⱡIn one sample run in duplicate (sample IDs 55 and 92), I507V was a flanking variant of F508del, therefore the
sequence CGTTGG is also a panel variant result
ᵹEvidence indicates that two samples, sample 9 (having genotype F508del/W1282X) and sample 10 (having
genotype F508del/3272-26A>G) were likely switched by the operator prior to library preparation.
*Variant N1303K was not called in one sample
§PolyTG/PolyT is reported only when R117H is positive
¤These variants are benign and are only reported when a sample is homozygous for variant F508del
Reproducibility of Conditionally Reported Variants:
PolyTG/PolyT results were unmasked for all samples in order to evaluate the
reproducibility of these results in the reproducibility study. A total of 276 results
were generated per site and 828 results for each panel, yielding a total of 1,656 results
in total. Results showed a total of 14 no calls and 19 miscalls. Eighteen (18) of the
miscalled results were from all 18 replicates of the same sample. One replicate of one
sample in Panel A at Site 2 was discordant with the bi-directional sequencing result
by 1TG result [10TG (MiSeq) vs. 11TG (sequencing)]. In this study, replicates which
generated a no call result were not repeated. The overall percent agreement (OA) for
Panels A and B were 99.03% and 96.98%, respectively, and 98.00% in total.
Results for the 3 Exon 10 benign variants (I506V, I507V, and F508C) were
unmasked for all samples to evaluate the reproducibility of these variant results. One
sample included in Panel A (#35) which contained the F508C variant and one which
was run in duplicate in panel B (#55 and #92) which contained the I507V variant
were reproduced successfully 18 and 36 times, respectively, across the three sites.

Each yielded a PPA of 100%. Correct wild type calls were demonstrated for all three
Exon 10 benign variants for a homozygous F508del sample (#16).
Lot-to-Lot Reproducibility:
Three kit lots were compared by testing 47 gDNA samples plus a No Template
Control (NTC) in duplicate. Each library preparation was split into two sequencing
runs for a total of 6 runs. The sample panel included samples for every allele of the
ACMG 23 mutations, 21 deletion insertion variants (including insertion/deletions in
homopolymeric regions and indels in the same region), 5 homozygous samples, 22
compound heterozygotes, 17 heterozygous, and 3 wild type samples. One of the
compound heterozygous samples contained one of the targeted large deletions and the
PolyTG/PolyT results were unmasked for all samples in order to evaluate the
performance for those results. Results showed that all reagent lots met the ≥ 99% for
call rate and reproducibility, ≥ 99.9% accuracy, and that ≥ 95% of the samples needed
a first pass rate of ≥ 99% acceptance criteria. The accuracy and first pass call rate
were 100% for each lot. The call rate for each lot was 99.98% due to 4 no calls for
Lot 1, 99.99% due to 1 no call for Lot 2, and 100% for Lot 3.
Instrument-to-Instrument:
To establish instrument comparability, three operators each performed a single run
over three different days on each of three MiSeqDx instruments at the highest sample
multiplexing level using the same sample panel as described in the Lot-to-Lot study.
The recommended input amount of 250ng was used in accordance with the
instructions for use. The study’s acceptance criteria consisted of ≥ 99% for call rate
and reproducibility, ≥ 99.9% accuracy, and that ≥ 95% of the samples needed a first
pass rate of ≥ 99%. The agreement results for call rate (by sample and base),
accuracy, and reproducibility was 100%, with the exception of one sample on
instrument #2 which resulted in one No Call for the PolyTG/PolyT variant.
Thermal Cycler Evaluation:
Three different commonly used, commercially available thermal cyclers were
compared for library preparation for the CF 139-Variant assay. Three unique sample
sets were processed through the 3 thermal cyclers across 3 days. Each sample set was
processed in triplicate each day (one replicate per thermal cycler). The sample set
consisted of 15 extracted gDNAs isolated from cell lines and a no template control
(NTC). The sample used was the same sample panel as described in the Lot-to-Lot
study. The data for each thermal cycler resulted in 100% correct calls for accuracy
and call rate. No samples failed to provide a valid result on first pass.
Extraction Study
To evaluate the effect of the extraction step on sample reproducibility, an additional,
separate extraction study was conducted. The pre-analytical (sample extraction) step
18

--- Page 19 ---
was evaluated at a single site, using fourteen EDTA whole blood specimens,
representing 3 different mutations/variants reported by the assay. Genomic DNA was
isolated using three commonly used commercially available kits representing
different methodologies (i.e., magnetic bead separation, alcohol precipitation, and
silica filter column). All three DNA extraction methods were tested independently by
2 different operators who each performed 3 runs per extraction method. Each
extraction was performed by each operator on different days. The DNA concentration
and A260/A280 ratio of the extracted gDNA samples was determined using
spectrophotometry and the assays were performed according to the instructions for
use. All extracted gDNA samples were run in duplicate using the MiSeqDx CF
Carrier Screen assay. The total number of assay replicates per sample was 36 [(3
extraction methods) x (2 operators/extraction method) x (3 runs/operator) x (2
replicates/extracted gDNA sample)]. Library preparation was done at a throughput of
96 samples at once. The samples from the 96-well plate were subsequently
normalized and pooled into 2 sets of 48 samples for sequencing.

The variants for all samples were verified using bi-directional sequencing (BDS) and
the genotype of the 2 large deletions was confirmed using an internally validated
duplex PCR assay followed by sequencing of the amplicons. The genotype calls for
all samples matched the BDS/PCR data and PolyTG/PolyT results were unmasked for
this study. The study demonstrated 100% accuracy of calls. One replicate each of 6
specimens resulted in a no call for PolyTG/PolyT variant, however in each instance
the no call result which occurred only occurred in one extraction method. Of the 126
samples extracted over the course of 9 days, between two different operators, and run
in duplicate (a total of 504 sequenced gDNA samples), 100% of samples passed the
call rate, reproducibility, and sample first pass rates of ≥99% and ≥99%, respectively,
for ≥95% of the samples tested.

Real-Time Stability:
The study to determine the expiration dating of the MiSeqDx CF 139-Variant assay
reagents and consumables were evaluated at six time points after manufacturing: 5
months, 6.25 months, 7.25 months, 9 months, 9.25 months, and 12 months. Three

separately manufactured lots of reagents and consumables. Each lot of reagents was
run in duplicate for the first 3 time points and singlicate at the 9 month time point. A
panel of 45 specimens was used to assess performance. The results from each lot at
each time point was assessed for call rate (acceptance criteria ≥99%), and accuracy
(acceptance criteria ≥99.9%). No miscalls were observed for any of the time points.
The largest number of no calls (N = 5) was observed with one lot at 7.25 months;
however the call rate exceeded the acceptance criteria. All No Calls observed at any
time point were for the PolyTG/PolyT variant. Based on the data provided, the initial
shelf-life for the assay is 9.25 months.
Open Tube Stability (Freeze/Thaw):
Three independently manufactured lots of frozen library preparation reagents were
used for testing. The assay reagents are single use and not stored frozen, and so were
not tested in this protocol. All reagents were subjected to 6 freeze/thaw cycles. At
each cycle (1 per day for 6 days), reagents were thawed at room temperature, the
reagent volume required for testing was withdrawn, and the tubes were returned to -
15 to -25°C for overnight storage. Thirteen gDNA samples were tested, including 1
NTC for a total of 14 samples. The 14 samples were pooled into a single library at
each freeze/thaw time point and sequencing was run in the CF 139-Variant assay
mode. Each freeze/thaw cycle was assessed for first pass rate (acceptance criteria
≥95% samples need to meet sample call rate specification of ≥99%), call rate
(acceptance criteria ≥99%), and accuracy (acceptance criteria ≥99.9%). The data
provided supports a maximum of 6 rounds of freeze/thaw.
Reagent Integrity and Shipping:
Shipping studies were designed to evaluate product performance after simulated
shipping conditions to mimic domestic and international shipping during summer and
winter. The product is expected to maintain its functional characteristics when
internal shipment temperature of the container is within the specification ranges
provided. Reagents believed to be sensitive to heat (e.g., enzymes, oligos, etc.), were
subjected to temperatures between 22°C to 35°C and those reagents believed to be
sensitive to freeze/thaw were subjected to temperatures between -10°C to 18°C. The
product packaging was separated into three containers and the internal shipping
container temperatures were monitored in order to ensure that the reagents were
maintained at pre-specified temperature profiles based on recommended storage
conditions of ≤ -15ºC, between 2 to 8ºC and Room Temperature (15°C to 30°C).
Products remained stable after being subjected to the above conditions for 48 and 96
hour time periods to simulate domestic and international shipping, respectively.

The recommended DNA input for this assay is 250 ng. An initial study was
conducted to estimate the performance of the assay when the gDNA input is greater
or less than the recommended DNA input concentration. Four (4) DNA amounts
were evaluated (1250 ng, 250 ng, 50ng, and 25 ng). Four cell line derived gDNA
samples (3 compound heterozygous and 1 homozygous) representing different types
of sequence variations and 5 variants in CFTR gene. Twenty-four replicates of each
sample at the 25 ng – 250 ng amounts and 20 replicates of each sample at 1250 ng
were tested. A single positive control was included. The samples were processed by
2 operators over the course of 4 days, to reflect variability across multiple users and
runs. Two operators processed two 96-sample library preparations that were
subsequently split into four 48-sample sequencing runs each, for a total of 8 runs. A
single no call result for a PolyTG/PolyT variant in one sample was observed at the
1250 ng input amount and 8 no calls at the 25 ng input amount. Six of the 8 no calls
were due to the failure of the PolyTG/PolyT variant being called in 6 replicates of the
same sample.
A second study was conducted in two parts to more thoroughly evaluate the impact of
DNA input on the assay and confirm the results observed for the lower threshold of
DNA input on the assay that met pre-specified acceptance criteria. First, gDNA from
14 samples were serially diluted to 9 different DNA concentrations where the total
DNA per reaction was 1250 ng, 500 ng, 250 ng, 100 ng, 50 ng, 25 ng, 10 ng, 5 ng,
and 1 ng. Each DNA input level was tested in duplicate. DNA samples represented
different types of sequence variations which may be present in clinical samples, and
included samples with heterozygous and homozygous SNVs in different regions of
the genome, heterozygous and homozygous small insertion/deletions, a large deletion,
a small indel in homopolymeric region, and a compound insertion/deletion. All
replicates of all DNA input levels between 1250 ng (upper bound) and 25 ng (lower
bound) demonstrated 100% call and first pass rates. The 10ng, 5ng, and 1ng DNA
input levels because they did not meet the specification for call rate.
Second, 25ng DNA was tested with 10 additional DNA samples to confirm the ability
of the assay to reliably perform at this DNA input level. The lower bound for DNA
input was defined as the DNA input that is higher than the input that failed to meet
the specifications (i.e., call rate and accuracy ≥99.0% and sample first pass call rate of
≥95%). All replicates of all DNA input levels at 25 ng demonstrated 100% call and
first pass rates.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interfering Substances:
The effect of potential interferents on the performance of the assay was examined
using 8 whole blood samples representing 4 variants and 4 wild type results. Two
concentrations of each potential interferents: bilirubin (684 and 137 µmol/L),
hemoglobin (2 and 0.4 g/L), and cholesterol (13 and 2.6 mmol/L) were spiked into
blood aliquots prior to DNA extraction. Additionally, excess wash buffer from DNA
21

--- Page 22 ---
extraction (15%) was spiked into gDNA samples prior to library preparation. For the
assessment of each inhibiting substance, data for each spiked sample was compared
to an untreated aliquot of the same blood/DNA sample. Impact on call rate,
reproducibility, and sample first pass rate were determined and compared to the non-
spiked aliquot. In all cases no negative impact on assay performance were observed.
A second study to assess the potential interference of triglycerides (37 mmol/L and
7.4 mmol/L) and high and low concentrations of K EDTA (7 mg/mL and 2.8 mg/mL)
2
to mimic short blood draws was conducted. The sample panel represented 8 variants
(6 PolyTG/PolyT variants) and was assessed for potential interference to both variant
and wild type calls. The solvents for both the triglycerides (100% ethanol) and EDTA
(1μmol/L NaOH pH 8.0, 3% blood volume) were also tested. DNA was extracted
using a silica filter spin column extraction method. The gDNA concentration and
A260/A280 ratio of extracted samples was measured using spectrophotometry at the
completion of each extraction protocol each day. The extracted gDNA samples were
stored at ‐15°C to ‐25°C until all extractions had been completed and all DNA
samples were ready for library preparation and sequencing. Impact on call rate,
reproducibility, and sample first pass rate were determined and compared to the non-
spiked aliquot. The results demonstrated that performance was not impacted by high
levels of anticoagulant or triglycerides.
Index contamination:
Two gDNA samples, which to have known to have different homozygous genotypes
at the same coordinates, were selected to assess the level of index contamination
necessary for an incorrect variant call to occur. One sample was mixed with the other
through mixing of the indexing primers and the results were evaluated to discern at
what concentration the genotype of the second sample was impacted to result in a
heterozygous call at the homozygous location. The first sample used different i7
indexes (i701-i708) but the same i5 index, all at 100%. For the second sample two i5
indexes were used at percentages ranging from 90% i501:10% i502 in 10%
increments to 30%:70%, respectively. A final combination of 100%:0% was also
evaluated. The results demonstration that an index contamination of 40% or greater
was necessary to result in an incorrect call.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable
g. Sample Carryover:
The goal of this study was to ascertain that sample carryover between samples within
an instrument run and between successive sequencing runs meets design
requirements. An error rate of ≤ 2% was pre-specified for all studies. The error rate
was calculated as 1 minus the percent correct reads at the read level for each base
22

--- Page 23 ---
position sequenced. For the NTCs, no base call is expected and the call rate should
be ≤ 2%.
Two gDNA samples with unique CFTR genotypes were assessed. One sample had a
single variant (F508del) and the second had 2 variants (Y122X/R1158X). In the
intra-run test, one 48-sample library composed of 22 replicates of 2 samples with
unique variants was set up in a checkerboard matrix pattern at alternating high (500
ng) and low (100 ng) concentrations along with 4 NTCs. Two additional libraries
were prepared, one for each sample which was composed of 47 replicates of a single
gDNA sample and one NTC to evaluate inter-run sample carryover tested the system
for sample carryover between successive sequencing runs. Data demonstrated that
the resulting sample carryover between samples was minimal (≤ 0.31%) with high
(500 ng) gDNA input levels adjacent to NTCs, but otherwise, any carryover did not
result in miscalls for adjacent gDNA samples.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Accuracy:
Accuracy of the Illumina MiSeqDx CF 139-Variant Assay was assessed by
evaluating 500 samples representing a wide variety of CFTR variants from four
separate sources. The samples consisted of: 355 archived, anonymized clinical gDNA
specimens isolated from human blood, 14 whole blood samples, gDNA obtained from
79 cell line samples obtained from commercial vendor, and 52 synthetic plasmids.
The 52 synthetic plasmids were designed to include the genomic context of the rare
variants and contained anywhere from 1 to 10 variants within the same construct. The
accuracy of all calls for all samples was compared to bi-directional sequencing.
Due to the rarity of many of the variants included in the assay (frequency of ≤0.001%
observed from the data based on the CFTR2 database published in Sosnay et al,
2013), it was not possible to obtain clinical specimens for all variants detected by the
assay. Therefore, the accuracy of the assay to detect these variants was established
using synthetic heterozygous constructs created by blending linearized synthetic
plasmids with CFTR wild type gDNA. For those specimens only validated using
these surrogate specimens, it is recommended in the instructions for use that
laboratories confirm the presence of these variants in a patient specimens using a
second validated method prior to reporting the result.
Samples which generated no calls were not repeated. One miscall was observed for a
synthetic sample heterozygous for exon 8 which was reported as heterozygous for the
variant CFTR dele22, 23, which was attributed to a sample contamination. A
synthetic plasmid blend for L1077P initially failed to be identified however it was
determined to have been not prepared correctly (see Plasmid Accuracy below).

* The Sanger report indicated the P205S variant as heterozygous for the clinical sample. A review of the Sanger
trace data however indicated that the variant was in fact homozygous and incorrectly reported. The MiSeqDx
reported the variant as homozygous.
ᵹ A synthetic sample heterozygous for exon 8 was reported as heterozygous for the variant CFTR dele22, 23. Further
investigation revealed that this result was likely from low level contamination.
^ The original synthetic heterozygous specimen was determined to be improperly prepared. When it was
subsequently tested after it was re-prepared, using the same plasmid, it would be accurately detected.
ⱡ When R117H is positive the PolyTG/PolyT variant is additionally reported. Results displayed are based on
unmasked results of all samples included in the study.
¥ In the case of one homozygous F508del variant, three additional wild type bases (i.e., variants I506V, I507V,
F508C) were not identified in the specimen) were additionally reported. The results displayed are based on
unmasked results of all samples included in the study.
Plasmid Accuracy:
For those variants that were not able to be represented by clinical or cell line samples,
a total of 52 synthetic plasmids were used to establish accuracy. Fifty synthetic
plasmid-gDNA heterozygous samples were created and used to assess the accuracy of
the assay for those variants not represented by a clinical or cell line specimen due to

DNA sequences were designed for each variant within each exon. All synthetic DNA
sequences were synthesized and embedded into pUC57 plasmid. The synthetic
plasmids were linearized, diluted, and blended with a CFTR wild type gDNA sample
to human genomic copy numbers at an approximate concentration of 50ng/µL to
create a synthetic plasmid-gDNA heterozygous sample.
A second accuracy study was performed to assess the ability of the assay to call 2
variants not originally represented in the first study and one which failed due to
improper preparation. The synthetic plasmids were diluted to human genomic copy
numbers at an approximate concentration of 50ng/µL. Two of the plasmids contained
single variants and one contained 3 different variants. The study achieved 100% call
rate and 100% accuracy for all 3 synthetic samples.
Conditionally Reported Variants
Exon 10 Benign Variants:
There are 3 conditionally reported benign variants (I506V, I507V, and F508C)
located on Exon 10, which are recommended to be assessed for hybridization based
assays, when homozygous results for variants F508del and I507del are identified to
verify that the homozygous result is not due to interference by these benign variants.
This phenomenon was not observed in the performance of this assay. Two samples in
the reproducibility study carried the F508C and I507V variants in the absence of the
F507del and I507del variants. Each sample however gave the correct calls for all 18
and 36 replicates, respectively, based on unmasked results. The I506V variant was
also assessed 7 specimens in the accuracy study and correctly identified 100% of the
time, based on unmasked results.
PolyTG/PolyT Accuracy:
To establish the accuracy of the assay to correctly call the PolyTG/PolyT variants, the
results were unmasked and reported for all samples included in the accuracy study.
The resulting variant calls for each sample were compared to bi-directional
sequencing. Four samples were discordant with bi-directional sequencing results.
Each of the discordances was noted to be within ±1 PolyTG relative to the bi-
directional sequencing results. However due to the homopolymeric nature of the
PolyTG/PolyT region, this is not unexpected. The accuracy of the PolyTG/PolyT
results were assessed for all the samples included in the study and a demonstrated a
miscall rate of 0.89% (4/448).

N. Instrument Name:
MiSeqDx™ Instrument (k123989)
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Semi-automatic. The MiSeqDx instrument requires limited user interaction to operate and
commence a sequencing run. The software uses a graphical interface to walk the user
step-by-step through loading of the reagents for a run (i.e., flow cell, reagent cartridge,
and PR2 buffer) and empty the waste bottle. The system then automatically initializes the
fluidics and optics, performs cluster generation, and commences the sequencing by
synthesis cycles while acquiring data.
The MiSeqDx system consists of four software applications are installed on the
instrument [MiSeq Operating Software (MOS); and Real Time Analysis (RTA), MiSeq
Reporter (MRS), and MiSeq Test Software (MTS)] and two software applications
[Illumina Worklist Manager (IWM) and User Management Software (UMS)] are
installed on user supplied PCs. The MTS is only utilized by field service personnel and
the MRS may also be installed on user supplied PCs for off instrument analysis. The
IWM software is used to create a sample sheet during library preparation and the UMS is
used to grant various access level permissions to users. The MiSeq Operating Software
(MOS) supports the ability to setup and run the sequencing workflow and save the
resulting files for image processing and base calling (primary data analysis) performed by
RTA software and MRS which performs de-multiplexing, alignment, variant calling, and
report generation (secondary data analyses).
The MiSeqDx software utilizes assay specific radio-frequency identifier (RFID) tagged
reagents and consumables which enables it to automatically select and configure the
appropriate run type to match the kit being used and control the in vitro diagnostic

this line of product types:
Yes __X__ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Samples from up to 96 unique specimens can be analyzed, including controls on two flow
cells (pooling of 48 samples per single flow cell) per MiSeqDx CF run. Twelve unique
index i7 reverse PCR primer (named A701-A712) and eight unique forward index i5
forward PCR primers (named A501-A508) for universal amplification of the ligated
products. When combined in a pair wise manner, produce 96 unique index combinations
allowing for up to 96 samples to be processed in parallel during the library preparation
process. These are added during the library preparation process. The sample sheet, a file
that the user provides the software, contains the link between each of the sample names
and their associated index sequences. After completion of the sequence run, MiSeqDx
CF Reporter software de-multiplexes the samples using the index sequences and creates
FASTQ files as the data analysis output. The user can also utilize the MiSeq Reporter
Software for sequence alignment and variant calling.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Samples are handled manually prior to being placed on the instrument. The test begins
with the isolation of gDNA from a peripheral whole blood sample. The gDNA is then
quantified and qualified prior to being processed through the library preparation step.
This step specifically amplifies the intended genomic regions of each sample while also
adding the indexes (for sample identification). The library is then processed to remove
any remaining preparation reagents (e.g., unused primers). It is then normalized, to
ensure that each library is equally represented, and pooled. The pooled library is then
added to the flow cell capture sequences to the amplified products. The resulting sample
libraries are then transferred into a MiSeq reagent cartridge which contains all of the
reagents required for cluster generation and SBS (Sequencing by Synthesis). The
MiSeqDx Reagent Cartridge, MiSeqDx Flow Cell, and MiSeqDx SBS Solution are then
inserted into the MiSeqDx instrument, which performs cluster generation, sequencing and
data analysis.
The sample throughput per MiSeqDx run can be between 8 and 48 samples per run
(including required controls), with a minimum requirement of 8 samples per run.

5. Calibration:
There is no end-user calibration of the system. During installation of the platform, a
company representative (Field Applications Scientist) begins a series of tests to validate
the performance of the instrument subsystems, which include optical alignment, fluidic
delivery, and thermal calibration, among others. In the case of a test failure, the MiSeqDx
company representative uses a set of instrument-specific tools to adjust and/or repair the
instrument to meet operational specifications. Re-calibration occurs during the
preventive maintenance visit.
6. Quality Control:
An internal control, bacteriophage PhiX (ΦX174) gDNA is added at the end of the library
preparation step, prior to library pooling and placement on the instrument. Successful
sequencing of the PhiX genome indicates that the sequencing chemistry worked as
expected.
It is recommended that both positive and negative controls (not included with the assay)
be included with every run.
Illumina requires that one positive control DNA sample and a negative control [No
Template Control (NTC)] is included in every run, which is defined as a set of samples
processed in parallel. The positive control DNA sample should be a well-characterized
sample with one or more known CFTR variants and positive controls should be rotated in
a manner consistent with the 2008 ACMG Technical Standards and Guidelines for CF
mutation testing18 and the 2013 ACMG clinical laboratory standards for next-generation
sequencing. The use of a wild type control, run as a sample, is recommended, but it
should not replace the positive or negative control.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Acceptance of plasmids for accuracy:
A serial dilution study was performed to demonstrate that the use of plasmids did not
artificially inflate test accuracy, i.e., that the results were not biased when compared to
gDNA from either clinical or cell line samples. If performance observed with plasmids is
improved over cell lines, one would expect that the results observed with plasmids would be
observed at lower dilutions where testing with cell lines was invalid or wrong. Four plasmids
were selected for comparison against clinical or cell line gDNA samples which contained the
same variant (E92X, CFTR dele2,3, D110H, and S549N). PolyTG/PolyT results were also
assessed from each sample and the synthetic blends. The prepared plasmids were linearized
and then combined in equal amounts (copy number) with human gDNA from a CFTR wild
type sample, in order to generate a synthetic HET sample. Two of the 4 plasmids were
complex constructs, each containing four different variants located on the same exon. The
remaining two contained only a single variant. Each sample was tested in duplicate across
33

four DNA input levels: 250ng, 125ng (2x less), 50ng (5x less) and 25ng (10x less). Overall,
no bias appeared to be observed with the use of the synthetic plasmids.
Specimen Storage:
To verify the storage conditions and handling of blood samples for use with the Illumina
MiSeqDx Cystic Fibrosis System, six K2EDTA anti-coagulated blood samples were
provided by a third party vendor. The six blood samples were divided to six aliquots, one
aliquot of each blood sample were stored under 6 different conditions: 2°C to 8°C for 1 day; -
15°C to -25°C for 1 day; 2°C to 8°C for 30 days; -15°C to -25°C for 30 days; room
temperature (20-25°C) for 7 days; and controlled room temperature (30°C) for 7 days.
Genomic DNA was isolated from each aliquot using a commonly used commercial DNA
extraction kit. All extractions were performed by a single operator. The extracted gDNA
samples were stored at -15°C to -25°C until the libraries were prepared and sequencing.
Genomic DNA Freeze-Thaw:
The impact of repeated freeze-thaws on gDNA samples isolated from cell lines were tested
by subjecting 15 DNA samples to 6 freeze thaw cycles. The fifteen samples represented 17
different variants and consisted of two heterozygous, one homozygous, and 12 compound
heterozygotes. The freeze/thaw cycles were performed across 6 different days and the
samples allowed to freeze overnight at -20°C between consecutive thaws. After the
freeze/thaw cycles were complete, the samples were stored at -15°C to -25°C until library
preparation.
Library preparations for both the samples from both the specimen storage and gDNA freeze-
thaw studies were performed at the same time point. The samples from a single library
preparation were pooled into one run of 48 samples and a second run of 32 samples prior to
sequencing. Impact on call rate, reproducibility, and sample first pass rate were determined
for each sample as compared to a respective control sample and assessed for each variant
included in the panel. No miscalls or no calls were observed for any of the specimens and
demonstrated that the blood and gDNA storage conditions tested did not affect assay results.
