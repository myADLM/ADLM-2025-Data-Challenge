I. Device Description:
Mission CliniCheck Assayed Chemistry Control is a human serum-based product
containing constituents of purified biochemicals (tissue extracts of human and animal
origin), chemicals, therapeutic drugs, preservatives, and stabilizers. Two levels of
control per analyte are provided in a lyophilized form. Each level is packaged into a
glass amber bottle containing 5 mL of product. The product is packaged in single
level boxes (12 x 5 mL) or multiple level boxes (6 x 2 x 5mL) and stored at 2 – 8 °C.
All human source material was tested and found negative by FDA approved methods
for HBsAg, HCV and HIV-1/2.

None were referenced.
L. Test Principle:
Not applicable
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Acetaminophen and Digoxin are manufactured gravimetrically using US
Pharmacopeia (USP) grade reference material. Alpha Fetoprotein, and
Carcinoembryonic Antigen are manufactured and referenced to WHO
standards. Ceruloplasmin is manufactured and referenced to IFCC standard.
Alpha-1 Anti-Trypsin and Haptoglobin are endogenously sourced from the
base matrix comprised of human serum.
Stability:
Shelf-Life and Reconstitution Stability testing protocols and acceptance
criteria were described and found to be adequate.
Shelf-Life Stability – Accelerated stability testing supports a shelf-life
stability claim of 2 years at 2-8ºC for Mission CliniCheck Assayed
Chemistry Controls. Real-Time stability study is on-going.
Reconstitution Stability – Real time testing was performed and supports the
following claims: reconstituted Mission CliniCheck Assayed Chemistry
Controls are stable for up to 7 days at 2-8°C and 20 days at -20°C.
Value Assignment:
Olympus AU 600 and Abbott AxSYM were used for value assignment.
Sixteen replicates of each analyte were tested over 4 days with 4 replicates
tested each day. The 16 data points were compiled and the mean was used as
the target concentration. Value assignment ranges were established at ±20%
around the target concentration. The target mean and range for each analyte
are provided in tabular form in the value assignment sheets.
