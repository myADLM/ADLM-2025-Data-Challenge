L. Test Principle:
The sample (whole blood) is drawn into the tip of the test strip by capillary action. Glucose in
the sample reacts with glucose oxidase and hexaammineruthenium (III) chloride in the test
strip. This produces hexaammineruthenium (II) chloride. Hexaammineruthenium (II)
chloride is produced in proportion to the glucose concentration of the blood sample.
Oxidation of the hexaammineruthenium (II) chloride produces an electric current. The meter
converts the current to the glucose concentration and displays it as the test result.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity performance of the GLUCOCARD 01 with the new GLUCOCARD 01
SENSOR PLUS test strip was evaluated according to CLSI EP6-A.
Venous whole blood was collected in sodium heparin tubes. The blood was pooled
and hematocrit was adjusted to 42% ± 1%. Concentrated glucose solution was added
to create high (800 mg/dL) and low (10 mg/dL) pools. The high and low pools were
mixed in various ratios to produce 15 test samples with glucose concentrations
ranging from 10 – 750 mg/dL (13, 23, 43, 75, 95, 123, 204, 263, 333, 406, 500, 520,
567, 685 and 764 mg/dL). The pO2 of each test sample was adjusted to 60-80 mm
Hg.
The glucose concentration of each test sample was determined with ten
GLUCOCARD 01 meters using three lots of the new GLUCOCARD 01 SENSOR
PLUS test strips. Reference plasma glucose concentrations of the test samples were
determined with a YSI Model 2300 STAT Plus.
For this experiment, the 10, 570, 700 and 750 mg/dL samples were determined using
test systems configured to allow the reporting of results outside the ‘LO’ and ‘HI’
limits in the commercial GLUCOCARD 01 meter software (i.e. below 20 mg/dL and
above 600 mg/dL).
The results from regression analysis are summarized below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The calibration of the GLUCOCARD 01/ReliOn Confirm is traceable to NIST
SRM 917c. The method comparison study was performed using the candidate
device and YSI Model 2300 analyzer as the reference method (see Section 2.a.).
Test Strip Stability:
The sponsor provided real-time and accelerated studies to verify the closed- and
open- vial stability of the test strips. The stability studies were reviewed and
found to be acceptable. The closed-vial claim is 18 months when stored at of 18
months at 1-30 °C (34-86 °F) and 20-80% relative humidity. The open-vial
stability claim is 3 months when stored at 1-30 °C (34-86 °F) and 20-80%
relative humidity.
Control Solution:
The control solutions were previously cleared and stability and value assignment was
previously established in k073416. The names of the control solution levels have
been changed from L, N and H to L1, L2 and L3.
When stored at 34-86°F (1-30°C), unopened controls have an 18-month shelf life and
are stable for 3 months after opening.
d. Detection limit:
See the linearity study in section M.1.b. above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were conducted according to a test protocol based on CLSI EP7-
A2. Heparinized venous whole blood was divided into two pools and glucose
concentrations were adjusted to 100 mg/dL (± 10 mg/dL) and 300 mg/dL (± 30
mg/dL). The glucose concentrations were verified using YSI 2300 STAT Plus. Stock
interferent solutions were prepared and spiked in aliquots of the low and high glucose
pools to achieve normal (therapeutic) and high (toxic) levels for each substance.
“Untreated” control samples were spiked with the carrier solvent only. The glucose
concentration of each test sample was determined using five GLUCOCARD 01
meters. Each interferent was tested with three lots of the new GLUCOCARD 01
SENSOR PLUS test strips. The highest concentration for each substance is tabulated
below. With the exception of pO2, all other substances tested did not interfere with
glucose measurements based upon the sponsor’s definition of significant interferences
(bias < ± 10% compared to un-spiked samples of glucose ≥ 75 mg/dL, or ≤ ± 10
mg/dL for samples with glucose concentrations < 75 mg/dL). The sponsor has the
following limitations in their labeling: “Patients undergoing oxygen therapy may

SENSOR PLUS test strip on 148 adults with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. Each
participant was given either a GLUCOCARD 01 or ReliOn Confirm blood glucose
meter and the corresponding Instruction Manual and Quick Reference Guide.
Professional and lay user results of the same participant were collected from the same
meter. Professional users obtained glucose results for the participants’ capillary blood
from fingertip and alternative site testing (AST) and compared the values to those
obtained onYSI Model 2300 Analyzers. Two YSI Model 2300 Analyzers were used
to determine the reference glucose values for each participant. The study was
conducted over 21 test days. Three lots of the new GLUCOCARD 01 SENSOR
PLUS test strips were used in the evaluationTest results were obtained from 148
participants. The fingertip data were included in the analyses. An additional 12

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
To evaluate the accuracy of the GLUCOCARD 01/ReliOn Confirm blood glucose
monitoring systems in the hands of the intended user population, the sponsor
performed a study with 150 adult lay user participants. Each participant was given
either a GLUCOCARD 01 or ReliOn Confirm blood glucose meter and the
corresponding Instruction Manual and Quick Reference Guide. Participants were
asked to perform a self-test of fresh capillary blood drawn from the fingertip and one
alternate site (palm) using the same system. Three lots of GLUCOCARD 01
SENSOR PLUS test strips were used. Test results from two participants were
excluded due to out-of-range hematocrit values. The fingertip data were included in
the analyses. Results were analyzed by comparing blood glucose results from the
GLUCOCARD 01/ReliOn Confirm blood glucose monitoring system obtained by the
lay user against the reference value (YSI) obtained by professional users. Two YSI
Model 2300 Analyzers were used to determine the reference glucose values for each
participant. The results are summarized in the tables below:

this line of product types:
Yes ___ X_ or No ______
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger and
palm only. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.
5. Calibration:
The system is designed to be non-coding. The test strips are coded with a test strip lot-
specific code. When the test strip is inserted into the meter it provides the appropriate
calibration code information to the meter, therefore, the user is not required to enter any
coding information.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor manufactures three levels of glucose control solution, L1, L2, and L3 to be
used with the GLUCOCARD™ 01 Blood Glucose Monitoring System and the ReliOn
Confirm Blood Glucose Monitoring System. The L2 Control is included only in the
System Kit for the GLUCOCARD™ 01 Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Otherwise,
these control solutions must be purchased separately. Instructions for how to purchase the
control solution are provided in the user manuals. An acceptable range for each control
level is printed on the test strip vial label. If the control values fall outside these ranges,
the user is referred to the user manual and customer support for assistance.

2. Data transmission: The sponsor stated that the meter allows data transmission to/from a
computer via a serial cable. The meter hardware and software has not been modified
since k073416.
3. Hematocrit Study:
The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated with three lot of test strips. Blood
samples at eight concentrations ranging from 30.2 to 425.8 mg/dL were analyzed. The
glucose samples were prepared from venous blood at eight different hematocrit levels; 20,
30, 35, 42, 45, 50, 55, and 60%. Glucose results for each concentration and hematocrit
level were compared to samples tested on the YSI reference method. The biases relative
to YSI for 30-55% hematocrit sample met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria and supports
the sponsor’s claim that hematocrit in the range of 30-55% does not significantly interfere
with glucose measurements.
4. Altitude Study:
An altitude study was conducted to evaluate the effect of altitude up to 10,000 feet on
performance of the blood glucose monitoring system. Venous whole blood samples at
four glucose concentrations approximately 60, 150, 300, and 450 mg/dL were tested on
one lot of test strips. Each sample was also evaluated by the YSI method. The results met
the sponsor’s acceptance criteria and demonstrated that the performance of the
GLUCOCARD 01/ReliOn Confirm System with the new GLUCOCARD 01 SENSOR
PLUS is not affected by altitude up to 10,000 feet.
5. Environmental conditions:
14

--- Page 15 ---
Studies were performed to verify the operational limitations of the system with glucose
concentrations of approximately 67, 134, and 336 mg/dL. Testing was performed at five
combined temperature and humidity conditions (10˚C/20% RH, 10˚C/80% RH,
25˚C/50%RH, 40˚C/20%RH and 40˚C/80%RH) and results compared to the reference
YSI. Five measurements were then taken at each glucose level, with three test strip lots,
for a total of 45 determinations. The results met the sponsor’s acceptance criteria and
demonstrated that the test system can be used at temperatures from 10 -40˚C and at a
relative humidity from 20-80%.
6. Sample volume study:
A sample volume study was performed to establish the minimum sample volume
requirement for the GLUCOCARD 01 and ReliOn Confirm meters. Venous blood from
donors was collected into sodium heparin tubes. The glucose level was adjusted to
approximately 50, 130 and 300 mg/dL. The study evaluated 15 sample volumes ranging
from 0.15 μL to 10 μL with twelve GLUCOCARD 01 meters. Six meters were used to
collect ‘control’ volume data (1 μL) and six others were used for the ‘test’ sample
volumes. For each test volume, blood glucose concentrations were determined using three
test strip lots at three glucose levels. Reference measurements were taken at the start and
end of each test series using a YSI Model 2300. Sample volumes were tested in random
order. All tests of the 0.15 μL volume series yielded “E-7” errors indicating there was
insufficient sample volume to perform the test. The meters reported glucose reading for
all samples with a volume ≥ 0.2 μL and the bias relative the average YSI reference met
the acceptance criteria. The sample volume study supports the minimum sample volume
claim of as 0.3 μL.
7. User performance study:
During the lay user study described above in Section M.3.c, the participants were asked to
complete a questionnaire to evaluate the ease of use of the device and the clarity of the
English language labeling. Overall the users indicated that they could successfully
perform the test and that the user manual was written clearly.
8. Readability Assessment:
The readability of the labeling (user guide and test strip insert) using a Flesch-Kincaid
analysis were found to be written at the 8th grade level.
9. EMC Testing:
EMC testing was conducted in accordance to EN 60601-1-2 , EN 61326, IEC 61326,EN
55011, and EN 61000-6-1 and the certification was provided.

efficacy studies were performed using constituent surface materials of the GLUCOCARD
01 meter and the ReliOn Confirm Blood Glucose Metersby an outside commercial testing
lab demonstrating complete inactivation of duck hepatitis B Virus (DHBV) with the
chosen disinfectant, Clorox Germicidal Wipes (EPA Reg. No: 67619-12). Robustness
studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in
performance or external materials of the meter after 416 cleaning and disinfection cycles,
using Clorox Germicidal Wipes, to simulate 4 years of single-patient use. Labeling has
been reviewed for adequate instructions in validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
