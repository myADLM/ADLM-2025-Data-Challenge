L. Test Principle:
The detection and measurement of glucose in blood is by an electrochemical
biosensor technology using glucose dehydrogenase. The FORA GD20 Blood
Glucose Monitoring System employs flavin adenine dinucleotide-glucose
dehydrogenase (FAD-GDH) enzyme chemistry as the standard dry reagent assay for
glucose in whole blood. This enzyme assay, with a redox chemical “mediator”
reaction, is used to generate an electrical current proportional to the glucose
concentration in the blood sample. The system is designed as an amperometric
measurement device using current generated from the redox reaction as the
measurable response.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Modifications do not impact analytical performance established in k101631and therefore
complete performance testing was not required.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision includes intermediate precision (day-to-day precision) and
repeatability (within-day precision). For intermediate precision, three levels of
glucose control solutions were used, and this evaluation was performed for ten
days. Repeatability was performed with spiked venous blood samples Mean,
SD and CV% of each of 3 lots was reported. Overall mean, SD and CV% was
also calculated. SD and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the SD of each
glucose level is reported for glucose concentration levels < 75 mg/dL. CV%
of each glucose level is reported for glucose concentration levels ≥ 75 mg/dL.

3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied
directly to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger and
other alternative sites (palm, forearm, upper-arm, calf and thigh). Since the whole
blood sample is applied directly to the test strip, there are no special handling or
storage issues.
5. Calibration:
Auto-coding.
6. Quality Control:
FORA control solutions Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 (sold separately) can be run
with the ForaCare GD20 Blood Glucose Monitoring System. This meter has a ‘C
button’ to mark the test with control solutions to prevent control results from
being stored in the internal memory as patient results. Recommendations on when
to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. The control solution
readings are not included in the average of the patient results. An acceptable range
for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is cautioned

--- Page 14 ---
not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Applicable temperature and humidity studies; sample volume study; Altitude
study; hematocrit study were established in k101631
2. System level verification was performed to demonstrate that modifications
have not adversely affected device performance.
a. Temperature and humidity were verified as compared to YSI.
b. Quality Control current board (QC board) was conducted to evaluate
the accuracy of 10 meters of the modified Foracare GD20 between the
dynamic range of 10-700 mg/dL. The QC board is designed to
simulate 6 levels of glucose concentration: 10, 50, 100, 200, 400 and
700 mg/dL when connected with the meter, it will send an electrical
current to the meter equivalent to the total amount of charge generated
by the glucose oxidation reaction at a certain glucose concentration.
The meter then process the current and display it in mg/dL unit.
Testing passed acceptance criteria.
3. The labeling contains the following contact information: 1-866-469-2632
(toll-free 24 hours, 7 days/week)
4. The applicant performed human factors testing to assess the use of "ForaCare
Health Care System Software" for the data transmission feature of GD20
meter. The study evaluated the usability of the software on 30 participants of
basic computer skills. The evaluations, including the usability of downloading
and set-up of the software on the PC, operating the data transmission from the
meter to the software, and questionnaire survey after the test, have
demonstrated the accuracy of the activity completion rate was 100% that the
software and the data transmission are easy to use by the users.
5. Bench testing using 3 meters was conducted that demonstrated the accuracy of
data transmission from the meter to the data management system software is
100% with respect to meter memory rollover and data transmission.
6. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing was performed and was
certified as passing testing criteria.

--- Page 15 ---
7. The applicant provided software documentation and testing that supports that
the device was developed and is under good software lifecycle processes.
8. Infection Control Studies: The device is intended for single-patient use.
Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the
meterby outside commercial testing demonstrating complete inactivation of
hepatitis B virus (HBV) (Duck) with the chosen disinfectant Micro-Kill+
(EPA Registration # 59894-40-37549). Robustness studies were also
performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in
performance or external materials for each of the meters after 5000 cleanings
and 5000 disinfection steps with Micro-Kill+, using two separate wipes for
each cleaning and disinfection cycle. The robustness studies were designed to
stimulate 5 years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate
instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
9. The applicant assessed Foracare GD20 Blood Glucose Monitoring System’s
labeling, including Owner’s manual and Test strip user’s manual and obtained
