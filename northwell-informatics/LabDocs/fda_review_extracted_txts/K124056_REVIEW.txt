L. Test Principle:
The FREND™ PSA Plus is a rapid fluorescence immunoassay that measures prostate
specific antigen (PSA) in human serum and in lithium heparin and EDTA plasma using the
FREND™ system. The FREND™ PSA Plus has a measuring range ranging from 0.1 ng/mL
to 25.0 ng/mL. The FREND™ PSA Plus is intended for monitoring quantitative levels of
PSA for the management (assessing disease progression) of patients with prostate cancer.
The specimen is added by the operator to the sample inlet with a transfer pipet, allowing the
appropriate volume of sample (30 μL) to be delivered into the FREND™ PSA Plus Test
Cartridge. The Cartridge is then placed into the FREND™ System, which is programmed to
begin analysis once the sample has reacted with the reagents. The reaction and analysis time
is approximately 6 minutes. The PSA quantification is based on the amount of fluorescence
detected by the FREND™ System at the FREND™ PSA Plus Test Cartridge window. The
magnitude of the fluorescent signal is directly proportional to the amount of total PSA in the
sample.
The FREND™ Test Cartridge utilizes microfluidic technology and detects sandwich
immune-complexes bound to PSA. Each FREND™ PSA Plus Test Cartridge contains a test
zone and as well as a reference zone. If the fluorescent signal measured in the reference zone

FREND™ System is a bench top fluorescence reader containing a touch-screen user
interface. The FREND™ System includes a simple computerized user interface to order
tests, display results and operate the mechanical functions of the instrument. All reactions
occur in a self-contained plastic cartridge and the reading is done in the cartridge as well.
Cartridges are loaded manually by the operator. Results of the test are displayed on the
screen and can be printed on an optional printer. A high-level schematic and process
diagram of the FREND™ system are included in the in the User Manual.
The FREND™ System is a closed instrument system. The user does not have access to
configuration parameters that could affect the assay process, test analysis or result
calculation, or any other parameter that could affect test result outcomes. All software and
control parameters are verified by the system’s redundancy check which is established at the
time of software release.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision data was determined as described in the CLSI protocol EP5-A2. Four
control materials were assayed in two replicates on two separated times per day for
twenty days using a single lot cartridge. Results are shown below in Table 5.
Accepted Within-run precision on samples with measured concentrations from 0.1 to
1.0 ng/mL was designated as %CV less than 15%. At concentrations >1.0 ng/mL but
< 25 ng/mL, %CV was designated as less than 10%.

A complex precision analysis over a five day period was performed at three different
sites each using three different reagent lots. Each site performed the assay utilizing
randomized samples based on CLSI EP5-A2 for 5 days, 2 runs of the assay per lot per
day, 4 replicates of each precision material per run. Precision material concentrations
were chosen in such a way as to estimate imprecision across critical portions of the
assay range. Concentrations were targeted at < 1.0 ng/mL (actual mean = 0.29
ng/mL), approximately 4 ng/mL (actual mean = 3.67 ng/mL), and a concentration
above 10 ng/mL but within assay linearity (actual mean = 18.33 ng/mL). Statistical
analysis was performed using the 40 data points per precision material per lot that
were obtained from each site.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To demonstrate the linearity of the assay, a serum sample pool with an elevated total
PSA (34 ng/mL) was diluted to a total of seven levels according to the dilution
protocol outlined in CLSI-EP6-A (Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative
Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach). In addition, a “neat” sample (no
dilution) and a “zero” sample were also be run. At each dilution level, the samples
were tested in 5 replicates to determine the observed value of PSA. Percent recovery
was calculated by comparing the observed PSA result with the expected value.
Recoveries within ± 10% of the expected results for the overall mean recovery at
concentrations above 1.0 ng/mL for each sample were considered acceptable proof of
this performance goal. The correlation coefficient when expected values were
compared to actual was R2=0.9992. The results are within the acceptable limits for
dilution linearity studies.

A linear relationship fits the data better than a non-linear relationship over the
measurement interval. Nonlinearity for PSA values is 10% up to 1 ng/mL.
Nonlinearity from 1 to 25 ng/mL is 10%. The measurement interval for this assay is
proposed as 0.1 ng/mL to 25 ng/mL.
A separate linearity study in the range between 0.11 ng/mL and 3.84 ng/mL was
performed. A linear relationship fits the data better than a nonlinear relationship over
the measuring limited interval. Nonlinearity is less than allowable nonlinearity: 0.04
ng/mL up to 0.4 ng/mL; then 10%.
Accuracy
As an accuracy determination, a serum pool from females (initial tPSA concentration
0.01 ng/mL) was spiked with three (3) different known levels of PSA across the range
of the assay. After testing in the assay, the percentage of tPSA recovered was
compared to the theoretical amount spiked into the samples. Recoveries within ±10%
of the expected result for the overall mean recovery for a given sample were
considered acceptable proof of this performance goal.

The percentage recovery ranged from 92% to 106%. The results are within the
acceptance region.
High dose hook effect
The presence of high dose hook effect was tested by analyzing a concentrated sample
of purified PSA antigen both neat and on dilution. Claims of “no high dose hook
effect up to 1200 ng/mL” used in the product labeling were verified.
Equimolarity
The sponsor does not claim the assay is equimolar or has established equimolarity.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
Calibration of the assay is linked to the World Health Organization International
Standard Prostate Specific Antigen (90:10) NIBSC code: 96/670. This standard
reference material for PSA is a mixture of 90% complexed PSA and 10% free PSA
(unconjugated to other proteins). Complexed PSA is a complex composed of free
PSA conjugated to alpha-1-antichymotrypsin. Alpha-1-anti-chymotrypsin is a serine
protease inhibitor commonly found in human serum.
Each lot of reagent cartridges contains a separate calibration curve which is traceable
to a PSA standard curve.
Device Stability
Real time stability studies of the FREND™ PSA Plus Test Cartridge were conducted
over 15 months on three different lots (007, 008, 009). The Test Cartridges were
either stored at 2 – 8°C or at room temperature. At each three month interval, the
Test Cartridge was assayed with five standard specimens. The results using both the
refrigerated and the room temperature stored cartridges for the five standard
specimens yielded results with a CV of less than 10% which meets the acceptance

criteria. The cartridges are stable for 12 months from the date of manufacture when
stored at 2 – 8°C.
Sample Storage Studies
To demonstrate that analyzing the same sample over a variety of storage conditions
returns the same result, fresh serum samples from six subjects demonstrating varying
levels of total PSA across the measuring range of the assay were split into aliquots.
The first set of six was analyzed with the proposed assay immediately. The second
set was placed into refrigerated storage at 2 - 8°C immediately after it was prepared
and then was analyzed with the assay after 6 hours in the refrigerator. The last three
aliquots were frozen at -70°C immediately after collection and were analyzed with the
assay after 1 week, 2 weeks, and 3 weeks. This study was performed at NanoEnTek.
Results showed all recoveries were within 10% of the initial concentrations, hence
support the conclusion that samples may be stored at 2-8°C for 6 hours or at -70°C
for 3 weeks.
d. Detection limit:
Determination of the limit of detection/limit of quantitation was performed according
to procedures outlined in CLSI-EP17-A (Protocols for Determination of Limits of
Detection and Limits of Quantitation).
In the determination 5 samples without PSA (blank samples) and 5 samples with a
low PSA concentration were tested in 12 replicates for each sample. The distribution
of all values for the blank samples (60 values) and for the low PSA samples (60
values) is the following:
The 95th percentile value for the blank samples was 0.04 ng/mL. The 5th percentile
value for the low PSA samples was 0.055 ng/mL. At a PSA value of 0.1 ng/mL,
there were no blank samples (without PSA) detected by the assay and 50% of low
PSA sample values (LOD samples) had a PSA value below 0.1 ng/mL. The claimed
Page 9 of 34

--- Page 10 ---
limit of detection/quantitation is 0.1 ng/mL for the proposed assay.
e. Analytical specificity:
Prostatic acid phosphatase and kallikrein (not otherwise described) were evaluated for
potential cross-reactivity with the FREND PSA Plus at 10 ng/mL and 15 ng/mL,
respectively, utilizing the instructions recommended by CLSI protocol EP7-A. No
significant cross-reactivity was found.
Interference studies on endogenous serum substances were performed according to
the recommendations in the CLSI protocol EP7-A. Interference is defined, for
purposes of this study, to be recovery ±15% of the known specimen mean
concentration. Recovery from 85% to 115% of the expected mean is considered
acceptable performance. The following describes the interferents tested and the
maximum concentration without interference at the total PSA concentrations
evaluated:
• Added hemoglobin (up to 500 mg/dL) does not interfere with the assay. Average
recovery when added to serum containing tPSA at 1.0 and 4.0 ng/mL was 97.3%.
• Added conjugated bilirubin (up to 20 mg/dL) does not interfere with the assay.
Average recovery when added to serum containing tPSA at 1.0 and 4.0 ng/mL
was 98.2%.
• Added gamma globulin (Total Protein) up to 5.0 g/dL does not interfere with the
assay. Average recovery when added to serum containing tPSA at 1.0 and 4.0
ng/mL was 106.3%.
• Added triglyceride up to 3 grams/dL does not interfere with this assay. Average
recover when added to serum containing tPSA at 1.0 and 4.0 ng/mL was 101.5%.
Three different HAMA concentrations (human anti-mouse antibody) and RF
concentrations (rheumatoid factor – a surrogate for heterophile antibody) were
prepared and added to 2 different PSA concentrations (0.75 ng/mL and 8.2 ng/mL).
Additionally Control PSA samples (of the same 2 concentrations levels) without
added HAMA or RF were prepared. All samples were tested in 3 replicates using a
single lot of the FREND™ PSA Plus assay on the FREND system. The percent
recovery is calculated from the mean observed total PSA concentration obtained for
each HAMA/RF sample compared to the expected total PSA concentration of that
sample without added interferent. The predetermined acceptance criterion for percent
recovery was 100 ± 15% for the mean recovery of each HAMA/RF level.
No significant interference effects of HAMA/RF were found in the FREND™ PSA
Plus assay up to the levels of 52.5 ng/mL HAMA and 161 IU/mL RF. The mean
%recovery of the 2 PSA concentrations at 35 ng/ml and 52.5 ng/mL HAMA ranged
from 85.7% recovery to 94.8% recovery. The mean recovery of the 2 PSA
concentrations at 53.8 IU/mL and 161 IU/mL RF ranged from 95.2% recovery to
113.1% recovery.
Interference studies were performed to evaluate various drugs that might be found in
the serum/plasma of men diagnosed with prostate cancer which could interfere. The
chemotherapeutic drugs were added to the test samples and controls at base

concentrations of tPSA of 1.0 ng/mL and 4.0 ng/mL. A modified CLSI EP7-A2
protocol was utilized in this testing process. The testing does not appear to be
substantially different from recommendations in EP7. Acceptable recoveries are
defined as those within ± 15% of the expected value.

There was no significant interference from the tested drugs that would affect the
interpretation of a tPSA result as assayed using the assay.
f. Assay cut-off:
There is no analytical assay cut-off established in the literature for a generic total PSA
assay when used for serial surveillance monitoring of prostate cancer subjects. This
assay has certain performance characteristics at the cutoff noted in the analysis of
serially monitored prostate cancer subjects described below.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Deming (or Passing-Bablok) regression analysis was performed on the data pairs
obtained from prostate cancer samples taken at a single point (n = 85) and the earliest
sample from each of 75 subjects in the serially monitored subjects. For a total of 160
samples (85 + 75), all samples were sampled from men diagnosed with prostate
cancer. Any samples reading above either of the linearity limits of the predicate or

proposed assay was diluted and the final result determined by multiplying the dilution
factor by the answer obtained on that dilution. Only results within the linear limits of
both the assays will be compared in this analysis. Performance will be considered
acceptable if the Passing-Bablok statistics show a slope between 0.90 and 1.10 when
the predicate device is compared to the experimental one.
Deming Regression analysis was performed on a set of 160 samples (dilutions
included) and then the samples exceeding the linearity of the FREND™ system were
excluded and the analysis run again on the remaining 143 samples.

It is not noted that the stages of the cohort of subjects with single point samples are
different when compared with the cohort of subjects using the initial samples from
serially monitored subjects. The distribution of tumor stages (in the TNM staging
system) is as follows:
Single point Earliest serial sample from
samples serially monitored subjects total
stage T1 25 8 33
stage T2 41 20 61
stage T3 6 25 31
stage T4 0 0 0
stage TX 1 19 20
no info 10 2 12
All stages 83 74
As noted in the table, single point samples are largely stage T2 (41/83 = 49%) while
the stage of patients providing the initial serum sample when serially monitored are
largely stage T3 (25/74 = 34%) with a lower percentage of stage T2 subjects (20/74 =
27%). This indicates that the subjects providing a single serum sample are not as
equally representative of all stages as the earliest serum samples from serially
monitored subjects. Single point samples are from subjects at prostate cancer
diagnosis and so are more typically tumor stage T1 and T2 rather than higher stages.
Therefore, a separate analysis will be performed of all serum samples from subjects
undergoing serial surveillance monitoring comparing predicate and proposed PSA
test results. This second analysis will provide comparison test results on patients
whom are the usual target population of the proposed PSA assay.

The median difference of samples in the central 95% percentile region was -0.3
ng/mL (95% confidence interval of the median -0.48 to -0.12 ng/mL). Though the
95% confidence interval does not include 0, the difference is believed to be not
clinically significant.
A scatter plot of 83 of 85 samples (2 samples not utilized since the differences were 2
extreme values in the distribution of differences) is as follows:
The slope of the best fit line from a Passing-Bablok regression analysis was 0.963
(95% confidence interval 0.905 to 1.029). The intercept of the best fit regression line
was -0.10 ng/mL (95% confidence interval -0.45 to 0.12 ng/mL). Both the slope and
intercept of the best fit line are equivalent with 1.0 and 0 respectively. This indicates
that there is minimal difference in PSA test result in this cohort of subjects.
A comparison of tPSA results from the immediately preceding tPSA value for
subjects undergoing serial surveillance monitoring will be described below in the
clinical study.
b. Matrix comparison:
Thirty six (36) matched serum and plasma specimens (anti-coagulated with heparin,
EDTA, and citrate) were collected over a period of six months, aliquoted, and frozen
upon collection until use. Specimens were collected under an Institutional Review
Board (IRB)-approved protocol with informed consent at a site outside the U.S.
Sample testing was performed on 1 lot of cartridges using 1 FREND system. The
samples were tested in 2 replicates and the mean of the 2 replicates was used for the
data analyses. Six to nine (6~9) pairs of specimens were tested in duplicate per day.
To determine the statistical relationship between the PSA concentrations of the
plasma specimens and the serum specimen, linear regression and Passing-Bablok
regression analyses were performed. Ninety-five percent (95%) confidence intervals
on the regression parameters were calculated. Bias plots were generated to assess the
Page 14 of 34

--- Page 15 ---
agreement between the two matrices. Equivalence of repeatability in duplicate runs
for all matrices and equivalence of variance between serum and each of three
different plasma matrices in three partitions were also evaluated. The acceptance
criteria for serum vs. plasma samples with PSA Plus assay value are as follows:
1) Passing-Bablok slope: 1.00±10%
2) Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient ≥0.90
An assessment of the repeatability of variance for each matrix type was performed to
ensure that variation in serum samples was equivalent to variation in each plasma
type. The assay range was partitioned into 3 parts (<1.32ng/mL, 1.32 to 9.085ng/mL,
≥9.085ng/mL PSA). Assessment of equivalence of variation was estimated using the
ratio of variances for the degrees of freedom used. The standard deviations of
repeatability for serum and for each plasma type in each assay range(partition), the
ratio with 95% confidence intervals based on F distribution, degrees of freedom
(sample size), and the p-value for hypothesis that the ratio equals 1 were calculated.
The hypothesis of equivalence of variance (null hypothesis) cannot be rejected for all
matrices in all partitioned assay ranges.

For the matrix analysis, Serum, heparin-plasma, and EDTA-plasma can be used for
the FREND™ PSA Plus assay. Citrate-plasma is not recommended to be used for the
FREND™ PSA Plus assay. It is recommended to use the same specimen matrix
when following patients because the results may not be interchangeable.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
The percent change in tPSA from the immediately preceding value was calculated for
each serum sample from 75 subjects undergoing serial surveillance monitoring for
cancer progression. The percent change in total PSA (³ 20% compared with < 20%)
was correlated with the clinical outcome of progression or non-progression at each
serum sampling interval. The following 2 x 2 contingency table indicates the subject
count for each of 4 categories.

There is a significant association between %change in PSA value from the preceding
value and the clinical outcomes of progression or non-progression. Additionally,
receiver-operator curve (ROC) analysis of the %change > 20% with progressive
disease outcome found that the area under the ROC curve for the proposed assay was
0.759 (95% confidence interval from 0.697 to 0.822; p < 0.001). This analysis
indicates that the assay using a 20% change in PSA value from the immediately

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Clinical Study – Brief introduction and study design
Seventy-five (75) serial serum sample sets with a minimum of three sequential blood
draw dates were obtained from a retrospective sample bank containing specimens from
patients with confirmed prostate cancer undergoing serial surveillance monitoring and
auditable medical records. From the available catalog of samples, serial sets were chosen
for this study to represent a variety of stages at diagnosis, samples with Gleason Scores
from 5 – 9, and a variety of treatments including prostatectomy, radioactive seeds,
external beam radiation, chemotherapy and hormone therapy alone or in combination.
The serial monitoring cohort consisted of 311 serum samples with a minimum of three
longitudinal samples per serial set and a maximum of nine samples per serial set – mean
sample number across all serial sets was 4.2 samples. The table below defines the
distribution of the samples within the serial cohort. The “comparison” column refers to
the number of changes of status (changes from one visit to the next in clinical status or
PSA result) that can be computed in a single serial set.
Serum sample sets collected from patients with confirmed prostate cancer who have been
followed during the course of their disease were analyzed for values of PSA by the test
device and the predicate device in single replicates according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Inclusion Criteria
Inclusion Criteria were set for this study as follows:
1) Serial sets must include a minimum of three (3) draws with an average of four (4)
draws or more per subject if available. Samples are to be from blood draws
performed at or after clinical visits throughout the clinical course of the disease.
2) Samples must have been in storage at minus seventy degrees (-70°C) with complete
freeze-thaw records and storage records

3) Institutional Review Board approval for use of the samples and Informed Consent
must be available for each sample set if required.
4) Sufficient serum must be available per sample to allow testing on both the predicate
and the experimental device.
5) Clinical information detailing the status of the subject’s disease must be available for
each sample as must the treatment regimen being used at the time of the blood
collection.
6) Clinical information concerning the subject at the time of initial diagnosis including
the following is requested:
a) Patient age at diagnosis, race and gender
b) Initial Diagnosis with tests used to confirm diagnosis
c) Stage and grade at diagnosis (if available)
Exclusion Criteria
1) Subjects failing to meet any of the above inclusion criteria.
2) Patients were excluded from this study if they had been previously diagnosed with a
malignancy (non-melanoma skin cancer excluded) other than prostate cancer within
the five years prior to the blood draw unless this malignancy was organ-confined and
no evidence of this disease existed at the time of initial draw.
Statistical analysis plan
The outcome measure for this analysis was the determination of progression of disease
from time point i (clinical visit i, i=1 to n-1) to a succeeding time point j (clinical visit j,
j= i+1 to n). In this analysis n is the number of clinical visits made by a patient after
diagnosis of prostate cancer and prior to death, loss to follow up, or remission of disease.
Disease progression (w) from visit i to visit j was determined by the subject’s physician
based on any or a composite of all of the following and confirmed by the Principal
Investigator at the bank site at the time the CRFs are completed and signed. Current
status of disease at the time of a specific blood draw will be determined by:
1. Examination of the patient for clinical signs and symptoms, including the results of
laboratory tests that are current standard of care for the assessment of prostate cancer
disease status.
2. Comments and conclusions drawn by the physicians involved in the patient care and
recorded on history and physical reports, notes of visits, status notes – all confirmed
in the medical records for the subject.
3. Examination of radiographic findings (imaging) ordered as standard of care that can
be used for the assessment of prostate cancer disease status. Radiographic findings
include results from CAT scans, PET scans, MRI and x-Ray images.
4. Interviews with the subject as to how he is feeling and any symptoms he may be
experiencing, how the subject feels compared to previous time intervals, etc.

Definition of %change in tPSA value (v) during Monitoring based on Values of the Test
Device:
Let d equal 2.5 times the coefficient of variation determined in the complex precision
study at approximately 4 ng/mL of the test device. This definition was chosen under the
rationale that the change in the test device from one visit to the next could not be
attributed solely to assay variation and could be statistically significant. For the use of
the %CV of the assay multiplied by 2.5 to define the PSA %change that is considered
significant, the following facts were used. TOSOH ST AIA-PACK PA %CV according
to their package insert is 3.4%. The significant PSA change for the ST AIA-PACK PA is
calculated to be 8.5%. For the FREND™ PSA Plus, the overall %CV determined in the
precision study was 8% which translates to a significant PSA change of 20%.
With w and v defined above, a 2x2 contingency table is constructed for the analysis of

· There is a mean of 3 v-w pairs in the patient cohort.
A bootstrap sampling distribution for the concordance (C) was constructed. The estimate
of the standard error for this distribution is 0.03 which translates into a 95% confidence
interval width of ± 0.06. This confidence interval width was believed sufficient to show
the efficacy of the test device.
Given the above assumptions and calculations, the minimum sample size for this study
was proposed to be 50 patients. Seventy-five (75) serial sets were actually used for this
monitoring study.

Based on the distribution, 80% of subjects were Caucasian.
Seventy-two percent (72%) of men in the study had no family history of prostate cancer
in first degree relatives.
In the serial cohort represented in this study, subjects were staged at the time of diagnosis
as shown in the following table. Subjects followed longitudinally with changes in
clinical status tend to be subjects with later stage cancer. The study surveillance cohort
was not enrolled with respect to initial stage at diagnosis but randomly chosen from
available subjects who met the criteria for enrollment.

Gleason Score at Diagnosis for Serial Cohort
Per literature on the subject of Gleason scores and the use of Gleason scores in defining a
patient’s prostate cancer aggressiveness, almost all patients today present with a Gleason
score of 6, 7, or 8. The study cohort shows this trend as well.

The time intervals have similar distributions across disease status. Note from the table
that the median interval between serum sampling and thus the median interval of follow-
up is 6.7 to 7.2 months for active diseases states (progression, responding disease, and
stable disease). However, the range of time intervals is wide within these groups. The
range was 3-4 months (first quartile) to 13-17 months (third quartile) for subjects with
active disease. The median time interval for subjects with no evidence of disease (NED)
is 11 months, a slightly longer period. Except for subjects with no evidence of disease,
the interval between serum sampling, and hence clinical follow-up intervals, covers a
period from ~3 months to approximately 15 months; a range that is not significantly
different by disease status. The median interval between serum sampling for subjects
with no evidence of disease is somewhat longer and ranges from 6 months (25th quartile)
to approximately 15 months (75th quartile). This longer period of follow-up is typical of
subjects without evidence of disease and differs from subjects with active disease only at
the first quartile (~6 months vs. ~ 3 months). This difference is not likely to be
significant for subjects with no evidence of disease.
The change in clinical status for each of the measurement intervals was evaluated for
“Progression” or “No Progression”. The clinical status of the patient at that visit was
taken from medical records and verified by the Principal Investigator at the site. The
percentage change in PSA (either ³ 20% or < 20%) was correlated with the clinical status
at each follow-up time period. The four choices of “Disease Status at the Time of the
Visit” are: Stable, Progressing, Responding, and NED (No Evidence of Disease.

Of 88 subjects having progressive disease with a significant change in PSA from the
preceding PSA value using the predicate PSA assay (³ 8.5%), 83 subjects were
categorized as having a %change in PSA from the preceding value ≥20% (94%).
A McNemar test of the paired data in the above table yields a p value of 0.218. The
associated 95% confidence interval for the true difference is -0.0157 to 0.0551. Both
estimators agree: There are no statistically significant differences in the Positive
Concordances (PC) between the two assays.
In order to use a different approach to evaluate the differences in the positive
concordances, the sponsor statistician states that a resampling algorithm was also run
where 10,000 differences in the positive concordances were constructed for the two
assays. The middle 95% of the distribution of these differences constitutes an empirical
sampling distribution for the difference. The middle 95% interval for these differences
was [0.000, 0.083]. These results are yet another indication that there is no significant
difference in the positive concordances between the two assays, test and predicate.
Comparison of tPSA values in tPSA values for subjects undergoing surveillance monitoring
As part of a substantial equivalence determination, it is important to evaluate the total
PSA values and the %change in tPSA from the immediately preceding PSA value for
actual differences between proposed and predicate assays for all subjects undergoing
clinical surveillance monitoring. Such subjects undergoing monitoring are the target
population for device use. In the clinical study, there were 311 such PSA values for the
proposed and predicate assay containing PSA values at various points during the follow-
up from each patient. Some patients had at least 2 such follow-up PSA values during
monitoring. Some patients had more serial samples (as many as 8 serial samples; average
of 3.1 samples per subject).
Of these 311, 75 were the initial PSA value from both assays and 236 values from both
assays in subjects undergoing monitoring. The minimum detectable PSA concentration
in the predicate assay is 0.05 ng/mL. For this comparison, tPSA values in either assay
were utilized as stated, even if below the minimum detectable concentration. In this
analysis, 236 paired serum samples from subjects undergoing serial surveillance
monitoring were chosen. Among 236 paired serum samples where PSA results were
from the predicate PSA assay, 13% of results were less than 0.05 ng/ml, the minimum
detectable concentration. Among 236 paired serum samples where PSA results were
from the proposed PSA assay, 22% were greater than 25 ng/mL, the upper limit of the
assay.
The difference in tPSA value for the two assays ranged from -1558 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL.
A plot of the differences in tPSA value vs. the mean of the two PSA methods (on the x-
axis) is as follows for differences between -50 ng/mL to differences of 50 ng/mL.

The differences between tPSA values were10 not normally distributed. The median
difference in total PSA was -0.16 ng/mL. Ninety-five percent of the differences were
from -30.5 ng/mL to 22.7 ng/mL. For total PSA concentrations below approximately 20
ng/mL, the differences appear to be constant. For total PSA concentrations above 100
0
ng/mL, the differences appear to be proportional to the PSA concentration.
Regresssion analysis of the PSA concentrations in each assay for the 236 subjects
providing serum samples indicates that there is bias in the total PSA concentrations from
-10
each assay. The slope of the best fit line from Passing-Bablok regression analysis was
0.865 (95% confidence interval 0.849 to 0.884, a slope not equivalent with 1.0). The
intercept of the best fit line was 0.038 (95% confidence interval 0.025 to 0.051, an
-20
intercept not equivalent with 0).

The differences in total PSA v1a5l0u0e between the proposed and predicate PSA assays is
related to the disease states. The following summary indicates the mean PSA difference
(with 95% confidence interval) by disease state:

For subjects with progressive disease, the difference in PSA value is largest. For subjects
with other disease states (or pooled together in the not progression category), the mean
250
difference in PSA value is smaller and possibly not significant. It is likely that the wide
range of 95% of the differences (from -30.5 ng/mL to 22.7 ng/mL) is found among
subjects with progressive disease.

This definition was chosen by the sponsor under the rationale that the change in the test
device (x - x) from one visit to the next could not be attributed solely to assay variation
j i
and could be statistically significant. The use of the %CV of the assay multiplied by 2.5
to define the PSA %change that is considered significant, the following facts were used.
TOSOH ST AIA-PACK PA %CV according to their package insert is 3.4%. The
significant PSA change for the ST AIA-PACK PA is calculated to be 8.5%. For the
FREND™ PSA Plus, the overall %CV determined in the precision study was 8% which
translates to a significant PSA change of 20%.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Distribution of PSA Values in Normal Individuals
Testing of ambulatory male subjects fifty years old and older who reported themselves as
healthy without any known illnesses, diseases or conditions was performed using both the
FREND™ PSA Plus on the FREND System and legally marketed PSA method –
TOSOH ST AIA-PACK PA on the Tosoh AIA-600II.
The sponsor recommends that a reference interval corresponding to the characteristics of
the population being tested should be determined by each laboratory. Results from the
FREND™ PSA Plus on the FREND System should be interpreted in the light of other
clinical findings and diagnostic procedures such as DRE, various imaging studies, etc.
since certain treatments can cause PSA values to decrease by virtue of the treatment
while the cancer is still progressing.
In normal men greater than 50 years of age, greater than 99% of the subjects had serum
PSA concentrations less than or equal to 4.0 ng/mL by FREND™ PSA Plus and the
predicate assay.

shown in the following graph of the distribution:
The upper 95th percentile PSA value using the proposed assay calculated from 196
normal men age 50 years or older was 1.68 ng/mL (90% confidence interval 1.28 to 2.03

To determine an approximate distribution of PSA values in these cohorts, the indicated
number of samples for the benign cohorts was enrolled. Values were determined in
single replicate for the proposed assay and in single replicate for the predicate device. A
cumulative distribution was created with the results from both assays. Descriptive
statistics were constructed. Distribution tables for all the single point samples were
constructed. Once the sampling distributions for each order statistic are constructed,
approximate 95% confidence intervals were developed. This was accomplished by the
identification of the value of tPSA at the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the sampling
distribution for each of the assays. These values will be compared to those found in the
normal population. Results from the test assay and the predicate device will be
compared.

N. Instrument Name:
FREND System
O. System Descriptions:
FREND™ System is a bench top fluorescence reader containing a touch-screen user
interface. The FREND™ System includes a simple computerized user interface to order tests,
display results and operate the mechanical functions of the instrument. All reactions occur in
a self-contained plastic cartridge and the reading is done in the cartridge. Cartridges are
loaded manually by the operator. The System is programmed to analyze the test when the
sample has fully reacted with the on-board in cartridge reagents. Results of the test are
displayed on the screen and can be printed on an optional. A high-level schematic and
process diagram of the FREND™ system are included in the User Manual.
The FREND™ System is a closed instrument system. The user does not have access to
configuration parameters that could affect the assay process, test analysis or result
calculation, or any other parameter that could affect test result outcomes.
The FREND™ System software consists of a graphical user interface and hardware control
elements. The software controls the graphical user interface, communication with hardware,
database management and data analysis. The software also controls access and functions of
mechanical components such as motor, laser and printer control and acquisition of data from
the sensor.
1. Modes of Operation:
The instrument is a system allowing single use only with the appropriate test cartridge.
2. Software:
Yes __û____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
The analyzer does not perform these functions, with the exception that the instrument
user can manually add specimen identification.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The analyzer does not perform these functions.
5. Calibration:
Patient samples are introduced into the device, hydrate fluorescent labeled anti-PSA
antibody in buffer, and flow by capillary action into the test cartridge. At the test region
of the cartridge, the PSA antibody complex interacts with surface bound anti-PSA
antibody. After continued flow into the reference zone un-captured PSA antibody
complexes are captured by surface bound PSA. Any secondary antibodies that do not
bind to captured PSA antigen in the test zone will flow through and bind to the PSA that
is fixed on the surface in the reference zone. A signal in the reference zone indicates that
the microfluidics mechanism is working. Microfluidic flow can vary because of
differences in blood viscosity. Therefore, the reference signal can be used to “normalize”
the result.
The fluorescence is measured in both the test zone and reference zone by the FREND
system analyzer and a ratio of signal in test zone to reference zone is calculated. The
ratio is compared with a calibration curve (lot specific) which relates the ratio signal to
known amounts of PSA. The concentration is calculated by the FREND system analyzer
and the quantitative amount of PSA is reported.
6. Quality Control:
All software and control parameters are verified by the system’s redundancy check which
is established at the time of software release. In the event the protected configuration is
modified, the application will be prevented from running.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
None
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
