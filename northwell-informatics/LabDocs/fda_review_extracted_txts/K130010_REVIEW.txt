nCounter Dx Analysis System
I. Device Description:
The required components for the Prosigna™ Breast Cancer Prognostic Gene Signature Assay
include the RNA Isolation kit (manufactured by Roche), Prosigna reagents (Reference
Sample, CodeSet, Prep Pack, Cartridge(s) and Prep Plate) and the instruments that comprise
the nCounter Dx Analysis System; the Prep Station and Digital Analyzer.
The assay requires microdissection of tumor from FFPE biopsies, isolation of RNA using a
Roche RNA isolation kit, transfer of RNA to PCR tubes for hybridization before placing onto
the prep station. Two sets of probes specific to each of 58 RNAs are added to the
2

--- Page 3 ---
hybridization reaction. These consist of biotin-labeled magnetic probes to purify the RNAs
and capture them on the assay cartridge and fluorescent “barcode” probes to detect and
quantify individual RNAs. The patient sample and probes are pipetted automatically into the
Prosigna test cartridge by the Prep Station. The prep station uses magnetic bead capture and
washing to remove excess RNA and un-hybridized probes. The isolated and hybridized RNA
species are then bound via biotin on the capture probe randomly to streptavidin on the
cartridge. The fluorescent molecules are then aligned on the cartridge by addition of an
electric current. The cartridge is then transferred to the Digital Analyzer where the cartridge
is scanned and digital analysis software is used to count the number of each RNA species
present. The amount of each RNA is then put into a proprietary algorithm to produce a
Prosigna score.
The test output is a patient specific report which includes a Prosigna score (0-100) and risk
category (low/intermediate/high).

multiplexed measurements of gene expression through digital readouts of the relative
abundance of the mRNA transcripts.
Specifications are included as part of the Prosigna Assay to control for sample quality, RNA
quality, and process quality. The Prosigna assay utilizes prototypical expression profiles
(centroids) for breast cancer. Patients RNA signatures are categorized into one of four
centroids (not reported) based upon how close their gene expression pattern is to each of the
centroids. The software algorithm produces a Prosigna score based on the similarity of the
expression profile to each centroid, as well as the pathological tumor size and a proliferation
score computed from a subset of genes. Three risk categories (low, intermediate and high)
were defined based on a study with over 1007 patient samples associating Prosigna score
with long-term outcome, defined by distance recurrence free survival at 10 years (DRFS)
(Table 2).

* As per the protocol, RNA from two different FFPE breast tumor blocks was
pooled to reach the amount of RNA mass required to complete the RNA
precision study.
Single use aliquots of each pooled breast tumor RNA sample were distributed to
each of three testing sites along with 3 ProsignaTM Breast Cancer Prognostic
Gene Signature Assay kit lots for testing. Each site completed 18 valid runs (9
runs by each of 2 operators with one run per day). Each sample was tested in
duplicate at 250ng RNA for each run. There are 108 independent measurements
for each breast tumor RNA sample. Variation of RNA reads was calculated and is
summarized in Table 4.

surface area measured ≥ 100 mm2, and 3 slides were input when the tumor surface
measured < 100 mm2 with a minimum tumor surface area of 4 mm2 required.
The calculated test results from the 43 specimens represent a wide range (94
units) of Prosigna scores, gene expression profiles, and all risk categories when
applying the node‐negative or node‐positive cutoffs to all specimens (Table 5).
Results for two samples were not obtained at all 3 sites and were excluded from
all subsequent statistical analyses.
The study showed that RNA yields per slide mounted tissue section were highly
correlated (r > 0.9) when repeat isolations were performed from the same FFPE
blocks across 3 sites, 3 operators, and 3 RNA extraction lots using the FFPE RNA
extraction kit. The measured tumor surface area for 4/5 RNA isolation failures
was ≤ 15 mm2, equaling less than 50 mm2 total tissue by area input into the test.
The mean RNA purity (A260/A280) at each site was close to a theoretically pure
RNA measurement of 2.0 (2.0 at two sites and 1.9 at the other site) with a SD of
0.1, supporting the RNA isolation procedure and specifications for the Prosigna
assay.
100% of samples passing tissue review and RNA isolation specifications yielded
passing results from the Prosigna Assay. Prosigna scores were reproducible from
site to site with a total %CV=7.2% for the assay at the cutoff of 40 and a total
%CV=4.8% at the cutoff of 60.

· One is a quantitation reference sample, containing known amounts of each of
the 50 test genes and 8 housekeeping genes. This control is run independently
of patient samples and used to compare each signal from the test sample.
· A second is a series of 6 positive controls. These are added to each patient
sample to guarantee that the sample has been prepared and hybridized
properly.
· The third is a series of 8 negative controls. These are added to the patient
samples and are used to guarantee that no contamination of the patient RNA
exists.
In addition, users are instructed to identify and maintain clinically relevant control
materials for each of the risk categories.
ii. Analyte Stability
The stability of the RNA analytes (50 gene signature) assessed by the Prosigna
device were assessed prospectively. RNA was isolated periodically over a 12
month period from the same tumor samples. No significant change in assessment
scores (delta <1 unit on a 94 unit scale) was observed. This demonstrated that
RNA was stable for approximately 9 months under recommended storage.
d. Detection limit:
The geometric mean (geomean) of the housekeeping genes is used as a measure of the
quality of RNA extracted from the FFPE tissue sample and then input into the
NanoString Prosigna assay. A geomean cutoff is set to qualify input breast tumor
RNA for further analysis and is calculated by the system software in order to
determine if a detectable amount of RNA is present for this assay.
A reproducible result could be achieved with the Prosigna Assay when using
minimum tissue requirements that included the following specifications:
· Biopsy material used to isolate RNA could contain no less than 50% tumor
(no more than 50% normal cells surrounding the tumor mass);
· Tumor mass must contain at least 10% tumor cells (in presence of necrotic,
inflammatory or DCIS components);
· Tumor surface area on the H & E stained slide must be ≥ 4 mm2;
· Total surface area of tumor must be at least 24 mm2 (4 mm x 6 slides);
· Minimum amount of isolated RNA should be 125 ng;
· RNA concentration Optical Density at 260 nm ≥ 12.5 ng/ μL;
· RNA purity (OD 260/280 nm) Ratio: 1.7 – 2.3.
Use of less material resulted in either increased failure of RNA quality or in lower
agreement rates on repeated runs.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference was detected from samples containing greater than 50% normal tissue in
the entire sample. Interference was also detected from contaminating genomic DNA.

The presence of necrotic /hemorrhagic/DCIS contamination had minimal effect on
Prosigna scores. RNA specifications and sample preparation instructions provided are
adequate to exclude the presence of any effect from likely interfering substances.

3. Clinical studies:
Clinical samples were left over from the ABSCG trial. Patients in this trial were post-
menopausal women with HR+, early stage breast cancer treated with 5 years of tamoxifen
or 2 years of Tamoxifen followed by 3 years of Anastrozole (ABCSG8 trial), the distant
recurrence-free survival over 10 years by risk categorization is represented for node
negative patients or node positive patients with 1-3 nodes present. For patients with 4 or
more nodes, the test is not indicated as these patients are all at high risk of recurrence.
The validation cohort represents the fraction of the evaluable ABCSG‐8 cohort for which
tissue specimens could be collected from the retrospectively archived ABCSG tumor
bank and for which informed consent could be obtained, or the patient was deceased.
Patients who meet the eligibility criteria for the original trial were only excluded either
because tissue was unavailable for NanoString's assay to be performed or the patient
could not be re-consented. All samples with a tumor block and patient consent available
were tested as part of this study, resulting in 1478 patient samples with clinical outcomes
available for analysis.

The primary endpoint was distant recurrence‐free survival (DRFS). This was defined as
the interval from diagnosis until distant recurrence or death due to breast cancer. Using
all available patient samples, multivariate Cox proportional hazards (PH) models were
fitted to evaluate the primary objective in sequential tests of Prosigna score. The model
included the standard clinical covariates (age, tumor grade, gross tumor size, nodal status,
adjuvant therapy). A Cox Proportional Hazards model was then fitted and a likelihood
ratio test was used to test whether Prosigna score added statistically significant (α = 0.05)
additional prognostic information. The primary analyses were repeated for different
patient subsets (all, node‐ negative, node‐positive) and endpoint (DRFS).
a. Clinical positive predictive value:
Positive predictive value (or absolute risk) is calculated using the data from the
ABCSG-8 trial. Positive predictive value (PPV) is the probability that an event occurs
(e.g. metastatic disease occurs within 10 years) given the device output for that
patient is high risk.
Distant Recurrence within 10 years for Node-Negative Patients:
PPV = 15.7% [11.4% - 21.6%]
Distant Recurrence within 10 years for Node-positive (1-3 positive nodes) Patients:
PPV = 24.2% [18.6% - 31.1%]
b. Clinical negative predictive value:
Negative predictive value is calculated using the data from the ABCSG-8 trial.
Negative predictive value (NPV) (or 1- absolute risk) is the probability that an event
does not occur (i.e. metastatic disease does not occur within 10 years) given the
device output for that patient is low.
Distant Recurrence within 10 years for Node-Negative Patients:
NPV = 96.6% [94.4% - 97.9%]
Distant Recurrence within 10 years for Node-positive (1-3 positive nodes) Patients:
NPV = 94.2% [88.1% - 97.2%]
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
ABCSG-8 Study
The ABCSG-8 trial was an independent European validation of the Prosigna™ Breast
Cancer Prognostic Gene Signature Assay in post-menopausal women with HR+, early
stage breast cancer treated with 5 years of tamoxifen or 2 years of tamoxifen followed

by 3 years of Anastrozole. The risk of distant-recurrence free survival was determined
by correlating patient Prosigna scores with clinical outcomes. Results of the study are
summarized below:
i. Proportional Hazards for Prosigna Score
The table below (Table 7) shows a summary of the primary analysis of the
ABCSG-8 study using a Cox proportional hazards model in which (1) Prosigna
score was added to the clinical treatment score (CTS) as a continuous variable or
(2) Prosigna score was added to CTS using the pre-defined Prosigna score-based
risk groups. In both cases, a null model consisting of CTS alone was compared to
an alternate model using a likelihood ratio (LR) test. The table shows the test
statistic (ΔLR χ2 = -2ln(LR)), the critical value for the degrees of freedom for the
α = 0.05 test, and the p-value based on the χ2 distribution.

*ΔLR is used to denote twice the difference of the log likelihoods when
comparing two models, e.g., CTS and CTS + ROR (Prosigna Score). The
statistic has an approximate χ2 distribution.
CTS is an optimized combination of clinical and treatment variables (patient age,
tumor grade, gross pathological tumor size, nodal status, and adjuvant therapy)
which is a best-case approximation of how a physician may use these factors in
treatment decisions. In all cases, age, treatment and grade are not significant when
other variables are included in the model. Tumor stage was a significant predictor
for the node-negative patients but not for the node-positive patients. When adding
Prosigna score either as a continuous variable or using risk-groups, the Prosigna
score was shown to add significant prognostic information (p < 0.0001) for DRFS
as compared to the optimized combination of clinical and treatment variables.
ii. Risk Estimation
1) Risk estimation in node-negative patients
The results indicated that three clinical risk categories associated with each
Prosigna score (Low, Intermediate, High), as set by the Trans-ATAC study
were validated for node –negative patients in the ABCSG-8 patients. The
following charts (Figure 1 and Table 8) show the Kaplan-Meier curves of the
percent of Node negative patients without distant recurrence by risk-group
through 10 years from the ABCSG-8 study.

iii. Results Distribution
Patients in the ABCSG-8 study, while having Prosigna scores across the measuring
range of the assay, were not evenly distributed. Patient data was placed into bins
consisting of 10 scoring levels and plotted against the data modeled from the whole
ABCSG-8 based validation study.
