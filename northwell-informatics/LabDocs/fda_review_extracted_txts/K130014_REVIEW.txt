L. Test Principle:
The A1c GEAR system is an immuno-turbidimetric method enhanced by latex particles using
a two-reagent sequence. Hemolysate is mixed with the R1 reagent. Total Hemoglobin and
HbA1c have the same absorption affinity for these particles, therefore the % of HbA1c
present in the total hemoglobin is proportional to the latex-bound HbA1c. Addition of the R2
reagent leads to agglutination complexes, formed by the interaction between latex-bound
HbA1c and the corresponding antibodies. Turbidity created by these aggregates is
proportional to the amount of latex-bound HbA1c therefore is proportional to the % of
HbA1c in the total hemoglobin.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated according to CLSI-06A. The linearity of the A1c Gear
System was verified using two EDTA whole blood samples, including a normal
sample with HbA1c concentration of 4.0% and an elevated HbA1c level sample with
HbA1c concentration at 15.0%. The normal and high samples were inter-mixed to
make a total of 11 intermediate samples covering the assay range. All intermediate
dilutions were analyzed in replicates of three with randomized run orders. The mean
observed %HbA1c value was determined for each intermediate dilution and plotted
versus the relative analyte concentration. The linear regression is as follows:
y=0.98x+0.19, r²=1.00
The study supports the sponsors claimed linearity range of 4.0-13.1% HbA1c
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The A1c Gear System is certified with the National Glycohemoglobin
Standardization Program (NGSP). The NGSP certification expires in one year. See
NGSP website for current certification at http://www.ngsp.org.
Value Assignment:
Sponsor recommends the use of the Bio-Rad Lyphochek Diabetes Control (k070546)
as a commercially available external control to be used with this device.
Calibration:
Calibration is obtained by using a Master Calibration Card. The master calibration
card is traceable to International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) reference
materials.
Stability:
The A1c GEAR System kit (Master calibration card and test cartridge) should be
refrigerated at 2-8°C (36-46°F) and used immediately after opening. The expiration
date of the Master calibration card and cartridge as stated on the package is 12
months after the date of manufacture.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by assaying 90 replicates of a zero sample
(blank) using the A1c Gear System.
6

--- Page 7 ---
Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined by assaying 27 replicates of three low
HbA1c samples. Each sample was assayed using the A1c Gear System. Detection
limits are summarized in the table below:
LoB LoD
2.3% 2.6%
The assay has a reportable range of 4.0-13.1% HbA1c.
e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was performed to assess common or known endogenous and
exogenous substances that could interfere with the A1c Gear System. The potential
interferents listed below were spiked into human EDTA whole blood samples with
different levels of %HbA1c (~6.2% and ≥8.0% HbA1c). The %HbA1c values of the
spiked samples were compared to reference samples (sample containing no
interferent). Samples were tested in quadruplicate to give a total of four replicates per
sample. The sponsor considered ≤ +/- 10% as their acceptance criterion. The
interferent study results are summarized in the table below:
Potential Interferent Highest concentration in which no
significant interference was
observed.
Unconjugated Bilirubin 37 mg/dL
Triglycerides 2,000 mg/dL
Conjugated Bilirubin 40 mg/dL
Rheumatoid Factor 550 IU/mL
Acetaminophen 20 mg/dL
Ibuprofen 50 mg/dL
Glibenclamide 0.2 mg/dL
Metformin 5.1 mg/dL
Ascorbic Acid 6.0 mg/dL
ii.) An interference study was performed to assess the effect of labile A1c,
Carbamylated hemoglobin and acetylsalicylic acid with the A1c Gear System. Each
interfering substances was tested using two EDTA whole blood samples with
different levels of %HbA1c (~6% and > 9.0% HbA1c). Samples were spiked with the
interfering substance and analyzed in duplicate. The percent difference of the samples
with and without (reference sample) the potential interfering substance was
calculated. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria is analyte recovery should not vary from
the base recovery by more than +/- 10%.
The sponsor concludes there was no significant interference with the following:
· Labile A1c concentrations up to 2000 mg/dL
· Carbamylated hemoglobin up to 10 mg/dL
· Acetylated hemoglobin up to 200 mg/dL

ii.)A hemoglobin variant study was performed using commercial samples known to
contain Hemoglobin variants C, D, E, S and F. Samples contained both low and high
levels of % HbA1c at concentrations from 4.2-11.6% HbA1c. These variant samples
were tested in duplicate using the A1C Gear System. The results indicated samples
containing Hemoglobin C were elevated by 24%, samples containing Hemoglobin D
were elevated by 16%, samples containing Hemoglobin E were elevated by 13% and
samples containing Hemoglobin S were elevated by 13%. Samples containing >10%
Hemoglobin F were decreased by 22%. All variants tested were shown to interfere
with this device.
The device labeling contains the following boxed warning:
“Hemoglobinopathies may interfere with glycated hemoglobin analysis. Samples
containing the following hemoglobin variants have been shown to interfere with this
assay: Hemoglobin C, Hemoglobin D, Hemoglobin E, Hemoglobin F (>10%) and
Hemoglobin S.”
