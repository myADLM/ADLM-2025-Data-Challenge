L. Test Principle:
The Access Total βhCG (5th IS) assay is a sequential two-step immunoenzymatic
(“sandwich”) assay. A sample is added to a reaction vessel along with a citrate buffer.
After an initial incubation, a rabbit anti-βhCG alkaline phosphatase conjugate and
paramagnetic particles coated with goat anti-mouse IgG: mouse monoclonal anti-
βhCG complexes are added. The hCG binds to the immobilized monoclonal anti-
βhCG on the solid phase while, at the same time, the rabbit anti-βhCG alkaline
phosphatase conjugate reacts with different antigenic sites on the hCG. After
incubation in a reaction vessel, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a
magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the
chemiluminescent substrate Lumi-Phos* 530 is added to the vessel and light
generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production is
directly proportional to the concentration of hCG in the sample. The amount of
analyte in the sample is determined from a stored, multi-point calibration curve.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Seven serum and four plasma patient samples were tested following CLSI
EP5-A2. One serum sample with a hCG concentration approximating 200,000
mIU/mL was tested using the onboard dilution feature. Three commercial
controls were tested with each run. Each patient and control sample was run in
duplicate. Testing occurred over twenty days (2 runs per day) for a total of 40
runs and 80 replicates. The study was run at an internal site on three
instruments, using three reagent pack lots, one calibrator lot, and one lot of
reagent pack per instrument. Results from multiple lots were similar. Results
from one representative lot for serum and plasma samples are provided in the
tables below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
i) Linearity:
Fifteen sample dilutions at concentrations across the measuring range of the
Total βhCG (5th IS) assay (0.6 to approximately 1350 mIU/mL) were prepared
by mixing different proportions of a high and a low serum sample. The hCG
concentration of the low serum sample was determined using three lots of
Total βhCG (5th IS) assay and two lots of Total βhCG (5th IS) Calibrators.
The low sample was tested in replicates of eight and concentration was
determined from the mean of the eight results to be approximately 0.03

mIU/mL. The hCG concentration of the high sample was tested in eight
replicates with three lots of Total βhCG (5th IS) assay and one lot of Total
βhCG (5th IS) secondary calibrators, where the highest calibrator level was
approximately 1700 mIU/mL. The high sample concentrations were
determined from the mean of the eight Total βhCG (5th IS) replicates for each
reagent lot.
Linearity results from one representative lot are presented below in terms of
expected versus observed. Results from other lots were similar. The results

ii) Dilution Recovery
(a) Manual Dilution:
Dilution recovery was tested on five serum samples and five plasma
samples at hCG concentrations between 100 and 120% of 1350 mIU/mL.
Six independent dilutions for each sample were made with wash buffer as
the diluent at dilutions of 1/5, 1/10, 1/101, 1/200 and 1/250, resulting in
sample concentrations of approximately 6 – 1500 mIU/mL.
This study was run on two instruments, using one reagent pack lot, two
calibrator lots, and two lots of wash buffer. Neat samples were run in
replicates of eight. Each sample dilution was measured in replicates of
four. Three quality controls were run in replicates of two on each day of
each run.

A 1/200 dilution is recommended in the Instructions for Use for over-
range samples (> 1350 mIU/mL). When both sample matrices were
diluted 1/200, recovery ranged from 97% to 115%. The mean recoveries
from manual dilution at 1/200 were 110% for serum samples and 104%
for plasma samples.
(b) On-board Dilution:
Verification studies were performed to determine the sample dilution
recovery of the Access Total βhCG (5th IS) assay. Sample dilution
recovery was tested on five serum samples and five plasma samples at
hCG concentrations between 100 and 120% of 1350 mIU/mL. Each
sample was diluted with wash buffer as the diluent at a dilution of 1/200
on the instrument using two different assay protocol files: dil-hCG or on-
board dilution (OBD).
This study was run on three instruments, using one reagent pack lot, two
calibrator lots, and two lots of wash buffer. All samples were run in
replicates of eight. Three quality controls were run in replicates of two on
each day of each run. The results are summarized in the tables below.

there is potential for end-users to obtain dilution results with a bias >15%
from dil-hCG or OBD assay protocol dilution of serum samples (but not
plasma).

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The measurand in the Access Total βhCG (5th IS) Calibrators is traceable to
the WHO 5th International Standard (NIBSC Code 07/364). Traceability
process is based on EN ISO17511.
Stability:
All stability study protocols were based on CLSI EP25-A. Stability protocols
and acceptance criteria for real-time, opened and closed calibrators were
reviewed and found to be acceptable.
Value Assignment:
Concentrations of calibrators are assigned through an internal procedure.
Primary working calibrators are prepared from WHO 5th IS and secondary
working calibrators are value assigned using the primary working calibrators
and the Access Immunoassay System. Primary working calibrators and the
secondary working calibrators are run together on the Access Immunoassay
System in a matched, multi-replicate process. Product (commercial)
calibrators are value assigned using the secondary working calibrators on the
Access Immunoassay System following a similar value assignment process.
The product calibrators are prepared at six levels; 0, 6, 35, 195, 620, and 1,350
mIU/mL.
d. Detection limit:
LoB, LoD, and LoQ below were determined according to CLSI EP17-A2.
i) Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD)
One hundred fifty six (156) replicates of the S0 (zero) calibrator were
measured for the LoB determination. Six very low hCG concentration serum
samples between the anticipated LoB and ten times the anticipated LoB were
measured in triplicates over 12 runs (36 replicates in total) to determine the
LoD. The study was run on three instruments, using three reagent pack lots
and two calibrator lots. Three quality controls were run in replicates of two on
each day of each run. The sponsor claims that LoB and LoD is ≤ 0.5 mIU/mL
for the Access Total βhCG (5th IS) Assay are supported.
ii) Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
The WHO 5th IS was diluted with hCG-negative serum at nominal
concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0 and 6.0 mIU/mL to determine
8

--- Page 9 ---
the LoQ. The study was run on three instruments, using three reagent pack
lots and one calibrator lot. Each sample dilution was run in replicates of ten.
Three quality controls were run in duplicates on each day. The sponsor
claimed that the LoQ is 0.6 mIU/mL and demonstrated that recovery is within
± 0.1mIU/mL and %CV is < 20% at the LoQ.
e. Analytical specificity:
i) Cross-reactivity:
A cross-reactivity study was performed on pituitary hormones FSH, LH, TSH
and α-subunit of hCG. The potential cross-reactants were added to the Access
Total βhCG (5th IS) Calibrator S0 (zero calibrator) and one patient sample
with an hCG concentration of ~2.9 mIU/mL. Results from these cross-reactant
spiked samples were evaluated against that of the unspiked sample alone,
defined as the control. No cross-reactivity was observed at the concentrations
that were tested for LH, FSH, TSH and hCG α-subunit as shown below.
Substance concentration
(mIU/mL)
FSH 1
LH 103
TSH 1000
hCG α-subunit 500
ii) Isoform Recognition:
Known concentrations of commercially available WHO reference standards
(isoforms) were diluted in normal human serum (negative for hCG) for
isoform recognition studies. The results (as shown in the table below)
demonstrated that the Access Total βhCG (5th IS) assay measures four hCG
isoforms: intact hCG, β subunit of hCG, nicked intact hCG and nicked βhCG,
while free α subunit and β-core fragment yield no detectable response.

An interference study was performed by assessing common sample
abnormalities (including hemolysis, icterus, and lipemia), common
prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and medications most often
prescribed in the patient population for which the test is ordered. Two patient
serum samples at hCG concentrations of approximately 2.9 mIU/mL and 500
mIU/mL were used for the study. The potential interferents were spiked
individually into each patient sample with a low and high concentration of
potential interferent. Results from these spiked patient samples were
compared to results of the unspiked sample alone, defined as the control. No
interference was observed at the concentrations tested as shown below.

iv) High Dose Hook Effect:
To determine any hook effect, 1,000,000 mIU/mL of commercially available
WHO reference standards (intact hCG, highly purified hCG β-subunit, nicked
hCG dimer, and nicked hCG β-subunit) were spiked into one human serum
patient sample (negative for hCG). The difference between the different
concentrations of hCG isoforms and the Access Total βhCG (5th IS) S5
calibrator (~1350 mIU/mL) was calculated. No high dose hook effect was
observed at the concentrations tested.
f. Assay cut-off:
See detection limit above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Patient serum samples with hCG concentrations falling within the measuring
range of the ADVIA Centaur Total hCG Assay (2-1000 mIU/mL) were
evaluated. A total of 224 serum samples, including 85 fresh and 139 frozen

The study was run at two external sites, one instrument per site, with two
reagent pack lots and one calibrator lot for the Total βhCG (5th IS) assay. All
samples were run in singleton.
The correlations between paired measurements for fresh, frozen, and all
samples were analyzed. Each analysis was completed by fitting the observed
Access Total βhCG (5th IS) values (dependant variable, y) into a Passing-
Bablok linear regression model, with the observed ADVIA Centaur Total
hCG values as the only independent variable (x, standard).

b. Matrix comparison:
The sample types for the study were serum (no gel), serum (gel) and lithium-
heparin plasma. 42 matched sets of serum and plasma (lithium-heparin)
samples were used. The sample (neat or spiked) concentrations spanned the
reportable range of the assay (0.5 -1350 mIU/mL). Spiked samples were
prepared using commercially available recombinant hCG antigen spiked into
the Total βhCG (5th IS) calibrator S0 (zero) matrix (BSA).
The study was run on one instrument using one reagent pack lot and one
calibrator lot. One replicate per sample type was analyzed. Linear regression
results are shown below.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Expected values for apparently healthy non-pregnant adult females, from the U.S.
population, with no known serious chronic or underlying conditions were used in
the study. Separate upper 95th percentiles were determined for: a) women ≥ 18
and < 40 years of age; b) women ≥ 40 years of age; and, c) post-menopausal
women (female subjects who had not had a menstrual period for 12 months or
more). Samples for the study were prospectively procured at one internal site and
one external site. The study was run at one external site on one instrument, using
one reagent pack lot and one calibrator lot.
The data was analyzed separately for each population using the non-parametric
method and following CLSI C28-A3. Additionally, a two-sided non-parametric
95% confidence interval (CI) was used for the analysis. The upper 95th percentile
is reported as an estimate of the upper reference limit (URL) of serum hCG levels
in apparently healthy non-pregnant female populations.
