k130021
B. Purpose for Submission:
New device
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Philips Digital Pathology
Philips Her2/neu IHC Digital Manual Read
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Manual interpretation of digital images for immunohistochemically (IHC) stained
HER2 slides
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Philips Her2/neu IHC Digital Manual Read is a digital score application
used with the Philips Digital Pathology Solution (DPS) platform that includes
a Philips Ultra Fast Scanner (UFS) Philips Image Management System (IMS)
and computer monitor. The Philips Digital Pathology Solution is an
automated digital slide creation, management, sharing, viewing and analysis
system. It is intended for in vitro diagnostic use as an aid to the pathologist in
the display, detection, counting and classification of tissues and cells of
clinical interest based on particular color, intensity, size, pattern and shape.
The Philips UFS digitizes glass slides at high resolution and generates images.
First the Philips UFS takes snapshot images of the entire glass slide as well as
the glass slide label and decodes the barcode. Based on the macro image of
the slide, the scanner determines which region on the slide will be scanned.
All images together with information about the decoded barcode are sent to
the Philips Image Management System (Philips IMS).
The Phillips IMS runs on commercially available server and workstation IT
hardware. The server stores and manages the digital slide images and digital
slide metadata. The server supports interoperability with other information
1

--- Page 2 ---
systems such as the laboratory information systems (LIS) via a HL7 interface.
The IMS Web Viewer software provides the User Interface for the pathologist
to view and read on the digital slides.
2. Principles of Operation:
The Philips Her2/neu IHC Digital Manual Read is intended to provide digital
images to the pathologist to perform semi-quantitative interpretation of
immunohistochemistry HER2/neu stained breast cancer specimens. Formalin-
fixed, paraffin embedded breast cancer specimens are stained with the Dako
HercepTest™ according to the package insert. Slides are then scanned at a
resolution of 0.25 um/pixel (equivalent to typical 40X objective) using the
Philips UFS and stored digitally on the Philips IMS. The pathologist
manually reads and interprets the digital image using the Philips IMS Web
Viewer without use of image analysis software. The HER2 score is
calculated by the pathologist based on the percentages of 0, 1+, 2+, and 3+
cells according to the HER2 scoring scheme in the Dako HercepTest product
insert.
3. Modes of Operation:
Automatic scanning with batch and random access modes
4. Specimen Identification:
Specimens are identified by slide label. The slide label includes a barcode and
a readable number. The Philips UFS takes an image of the label, the whole
slide image and composite high resolution images. The barcode on the slide is
read by the software and used to identify the slide in the database. If the
barcode is not available or cannot be read, an image is classified as ‘Action
Required’ and placed in a dedicated folder in the Philips IMS with the same
name. If an image is placed in that folder, a user can manually enter the
SlideID and retry communication with LIS. The label image is by default
visible in the IMS web viewer but it is the user’s preference to show or hide
the label image.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The Philips UFS has the capacity to automatically scan 300 slides per run (15
glass slide racks with up to 20 slides per rack). The user may change the
priority of the slide scanning sequence using the touch screen display. The
display also shows the scanning status of each rack.

6. Calibration:
Calibrations, both manual and automated, are performed during production,
system installation, operation and maintenance over the lifetime of the
product.
Calibration at installation: A full calibration of the Philips UFS is performed
during production at the factory using a service application. The same service
application is used by service engineers to re-calibrate the Philips UFS after
system installation. It includes calibration of: color (using a color target and
transformation matrix), homogeneity of the illumination, alignment of
mechatronics elements of the Philips UFS (e.g. stage, slide gripper), and
alignment of positions of all cameras (snapshot, autofocus and line-scan-color
cameras (Red, Green and Blue)).
Calibration during operation: During normal operation, the Philips UFS
automatically recalibrates itself periodically for the following elements:
stages, focus system, line scan cameras, and homogeneity of the illumination.
While scanning, the Philips UFS continuously monitors the quality of each
lane and re-scans a lane when the quality is insufficient. A user can manually
start calibration process via user interface of the Philips UFS. At least every
six months, the service engineer should use the same service application used
during production and installation to re-calibrate the Philips UFS.
7. Quality Control:
The accuracy of the system depends on the laboratory following the quality
control instructions for the Dako HercepTest™.

J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy:
A method comparison study was conducted to compare traditional optical
microscopy (“Manual Optical”) and manual reading of digital slides on a
computer monitor (“Manual Digital”) with breast cancer specimens that
were stained with Dako HercepTest™.
A total of two hundred (200) formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast
tissue specimens from a tissue bank of de-identified human specimens
were selected for inclusion in the study. The slides were prescreened by a
pathologist to evaluate the quality of the tissue, quality of the staining and
to provide a score. Slides that passed the prescreening were randomly
selected to fulfill a roughly equal distribution of HercepTest™ scores in
four categories (0, 1+, 2+, 3+).
The pathologists in the study were trained in the use of the investigational
device according to the labeling. The slides were scanned at three
different scanners and three pathologists from two sites participated in the
study. The order of the methods was randomized over the pathologists
and the washout period between reads was at least 7 days.
Tables 1-3 show the 4x4 tables for the agreements between the manual
microscopy reads and manual digital reads using column-wise Percent
Agreement (PA; i.e., percent of manual digital reads that agree with a
given manual optical read) with an Exact 95% Confidence Interval (CI)
for each of the pathologists. The statistical analysis is provided for a
trichotomous agreement of the HER2 scores combining 0 and 1+, and
leaving 2+ and 3+ uncombined. For example, there were 93 (38 + 55)
slides with manual optical read either 0 or 1+ and 85 (37 + 1 + 1 + 46) of
these were called 0 or 1+ by manual digital read, resulting in a PA of
91.39% (85/93).

A slide set of eight (8) slides, consisting of two slides in each of the
categories (0, 1+, 2+, 3+), was used in the intra-pathologist study. Twelve
additional “wild card” slides were added to minimize recall bias. These
12 slides were not used in the analyses. Each slide was read 5 times for a
total of 40 reads by both the optical and digital method. For the intra-
pathologist study outliers are defined as scores that are different from the
median values of the scores provided by the pathologist over 5 runs of the
method. For manual optical reads intra-pathologist agreement was 87.5%
(35/40). For manual digital reads intra-pathologist agreement was 92.5%
(37/40).
Inter-Pathologist Precision
The inter-pathologist study used data collected from all sites for each of
the 3 pathologists in the method comparison study (N=191). For manual
digital reads using binary percent agreement (0, 1+ vs. 2+, 3+) inter-
pathologist agreement was 80.45% with Exact 95% CI (76.27%, 84.64%).
For manual optical reads inter-pathologist agreement was 77.66% with
95% Exact CI (73.12%, 82.20%).
Inter-Day/Intra-System and Inter-System Precision
A study was conducted at one clinical site to assess the inter-day/intra-
instrument and inter-instrument precision for manual digital reads.
A subset of forty (40) slides from the method comparison study was used.
The slides were selected to provide an equal distribution of HER2 scores
in the four scoring categories (0, 1+, 2+, 3+). For the Inter-Day/Intra-
System study the slide set was scanned on three different days on the same
device and the images were scored by one pathologist. For the Inter-
System study the slides set was scanned one time on three devices and the
images were scored by a second pathologist. To prevent recall bias, slides
were randomized between reads and a minimum washout period of one
week was required between reading sessions. Additionally, 32 wild card
images, not included in the analysis were utilized to confound the reads.
The statistical analysis is presented across all slides, with pair-wise
comparisons of all reads by the pathologist, using Percent Agreement (PA)
with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI). The statistical analysis is provided
for a trichotomous categorization of the HER2 scores combined 0 and 1+
and leaving 2+ and 3+ uncombined.

2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
The Philips UFS automatically recalibrates itself periodically for the following
elements: stages, focus system, line scan cameras, and homogeneity of the
illumination. Calibration is preceded by a measurement of system parameters
which is performed in a certain interval. The interval is defined based on the
number of slides scanned, temperature or time. If the parameters are found to
have drifted outside their prescribed range, a corresponding calibration is
performed to bring them back within the range. Then the parameters are
measured again to verify their status. Intervals for auto-calibration are
presented in Table 6.
