L. Test Principle:
The BioPlex 2200 Celiac IgA and IgG kits use a multiplexed micro particle bead-
based immunoassay for the semi-quantitative detection of IgA and IgG antibodies to
tissue Transglutaminase (tTG) and deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) in human
serum using the Luminex flow cytometry technology.
In the BioPlex Celiac IgA and IgG assays, two (2) different populations of dyed
beads are coated with antigens associated with celiac disease (recombinant antigens).
The BioPlex 2200 System combines an aliquot of patient sample, sample diluent, and
bead set reagent into a reaction vessel. The mixture is incubated at 37°C. After a
wash cycle, anti-human IgA or IgG antibody conjugated to phycoerythrin (PE) is
added to the dyed beads and this mixture is incubated at 37°C. The excess conjugate
is removed in another wash cycle, and the beads are re-suspended in wash buffer. The
bead mixture then passes through the detector. The identity of the dyed beads is
determined by the fluorescence of the dyes, and the amount of antibody captured by
the antigen is determined by the fluorescence of the attached PE. Raw data is
calculated in relative fluorescence intensity (RFI).
Two additional dyed beads, Internal Standard Bead (ISB) and Serum Verification
Bead (SVB) are present in each reaction mixture to verify detector response and the
addition of serum to the reaction vessel. An additional control bead, IgA Verification
Bead (AVB) has been included for the Celiac IgA kit to flag results for samples with
deficient lgA levels. Refer to the BioPlex 2200 System Operation Manual for more
information on internal quality control beads.
The system is calibrated using a set of nine (9) distinct calibrator vials, supplied
separately by Bio-Rad Laboratories. For anti-tTG, five (5) vials, representing five (5)
different antibody concentrations, are used for semi-quantitative calibration for anti-
tTG IgA and IgG. For anti-DGP, five (5) vials, representing five (5) different
antibody concentrations, are used for semi-quantitative calibration for anti-DGP IgA
and IgG. The result for each of these antibodies is expressed in Units/mL (U/mL).

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
i) Reproducibility: BioPlex® 2200 Celiac IgA and IgG assays
reproducibility testing was performed in accordance with CLSI EP5-A2
Guideline, using 10 patient serum samples within the assay reportable
range in replicates of ten on each of three BioPlex 2200 instruments with
three independent reagent lots comprised of a reagent pack, matched
calibrator set and control set. Two runs were conducted on each
instrument for each of three set reagent. Each lot mean (U/mL) was
calculated using data 60 points for each patient sample (ten replicates,
three instruments, two runs per instrument). Total coefficient of variation
(CV) was calculated based on within-run, between-run, between-
instruments/operators and between-reagent-lots precision. The acceptance
criteria for total precision are %CV < 25% (for > 15 U/mL Positive) and
SD < 3 U/mL (<15 U/mL Negative). Results of the reproducibility study
are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
i) Linearity: Three low and 4-5 high Celiac anti-tTG IgA or IgG and anti-
DGP IgA or IgG positive patient samples were tested to demonstrate
linearity. These samples were diluted with immunodepleted serum
according to CLSI EP06-A. Each sample and dilution was evaluated in
replicates of four using one Celiac IgA and IgG lot on one instrument.
Linear and polynomial regression analysis of Celiac IgA and IgG recovery
vs. sample dilution was performed to determine if the dilution curves
exhibit statistically significant non-linear regression based on the CLSI
guideline EP06-A.
The regression parameters (slope, intercept and r2) of the observed values
vs. predicted values are shown below.

ii) Dilution Recovery:
The BioPlex 2200 instrument has the ability to perform 1:10 onboard
dilution of samples using wash buffer as the diluent. The BioPlex 2200
instrument has dilution screen for loading and analysis of diluted
specimens. If this option is selected, the instrument will automatically run
any sample that has a result >250 U/mL by further diluting it by a factor of
10.
To confirm the onboard dilution function, high positive specimens with
results above the analytical measuring range were selected for each assay.
The samples were run with the onboard dilution function enabled on the
BioPlex 2200 instrument. Then the specimens were manually diluted the
same way as it happens in the onboard dilution function (10 fold dilution),
and tested on the BioPlex 2200 instrument. The results were within the
analytical measuring range after onboard dilution or manual dilution for
all specimens. The percent-recoveries in onboard dilution compared to
manual dilution are tabulated below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i) Traceability: There is no international or certified reference material
available for Celiac anti-tTG and anti-DGP IgA and IgG. The calibrators
are assigned relative arbitrary units (U/mL).
ii) Calibrator and controls: The calibrators are manufactured independently
from the controls, and are stabilized with <0.3% ProClin® 300, <0.1%
sodium benzoate, and <0.1% sodium azide. Calibrator assignment is
established for matched lots of BioPlex® 2200 Celiac IgA or IgG kit and
calibrators using a master set of calibrators as reference and replicate
analyses on multiple BioPlex® 2200 instruments. The BioPlex® 2200
Celiac IgA or IgG Reagent Kit is calibrated using a set of five (5) distinct
calibrators for anti-tTG and anti-DGP IgG or IgA, which are used to
establish points of reference for determining the presence of Celiac IgA or
IgG in human specimens.
The negative control has been tested to give results with values below the
cut-off for each assay. The positive control is prepared by blending
human disease state serum with negative serum matrix and is
manufactured to give results with values above the assay cut-off. The
positive controls are manufactured to give positive results, with values
above the cut-off for each specific analyte. The negative control is
manufactured to give negative results, with values below the cut-off for
each specific analyte.
iii) Stability: Stability studies have been performed to support the following
claims:
Calibrator and Control: BioPlex® 2200 Celiac IgA and IgG Control and
Calibrator Sets: Calibrator Open Vial Stability (2 to 8°C), 60 days from
first opening; Control Open Vial Stability (2 to 8°C), 60 days from first
opening; Calibration Curve On-board Stability, 30 days; Calibrators and
Controls Real Time Stability (2 to 8°C), 9 months; labeled as until
expiration date; Calibrators and Controls Accelerated Stability (2 to 8°C),
2.5 years predicted. Calibrators and controls were shown to be stable after
5 freeze-thaw cycles at either -20°C or -80°C.
Kit Stability: BioPlex® 2200 Celiac IgA and IgG Kit: Real-time
(unopened) Kit Stability is 9 months or until the date of expiration when
stored unopened on the instrument or at 2 to 8°C. The Open kit claim is
60 days.

Serum Sample Stability: Sample stability studies were also performed:
Sample stability fresh (2 to 8°C), 7 days; Sample stability frozen (-20 or -
80°C), 8 months; Sample Freeze-thaw (-20 or -80°C), up to 3-freeze/thaw
cycles acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
Three (3) serum samples per assay with analyte concentration near cutoff (15
U/mL) were serially diluted in a factor of 2 in negative human serum (IgG
depleted) to a concentration level of 0.54 U/mL (anti-DGP IgA), 0.64 U/mL
(anti-tTG IgA), 0.73/mL (anti-DGP IgG), 0.61 U/mL (anti-tTG IgG). Each
dilution was assayed daily in replicates of 12 for a period of five days (60 data
points total per dilution) on one BioPlex 2200 instrument. All assays used a
passing on-board calibration and assay controls were run prior to samples.
The BioPlex 2200 Celiac IgA and IgG LoD was calculated based on CLSI
EP17-A guideline as “LoD = LoB + cβSDs”. For this calculation, the LoB
was calculated at the 95th percentile of negative samples. cβ is the 95th
percentile of the standard Gaussian distribution with a correction factor
applied to account for the biased estimate of the population standard deviation
(1.645/(1-1/(4xf)), where f is the degrees of freedom of the estimated standard
deviation SDs. LoQ = LoD if the %CV of LoD is less than or equal to 20%;
otherwise, LoQ was calculated from the regression line of the LoD standard
deviation versus the analyte concentration. The results of LoQ, LoD and LoB
are summarized in the table below.

e. Analytical specificity:
i) Interferences: An interfering substance study was conducted in pooled
serum samples at multiple analyte levels including below cut-off (<15
U/mL), low positive (15 to 25 U/mL), medium positive (40 to 60 U/mL)
and high positive (78 to 160 U/mL), to evaluate the potential interference
of specific endogenous and exogenous substances with the BioPlex® 2200
Celiac IgA and IgG kits according to CLSI EP7-A2. Bias exceeding 20%
was considered interference.
Results showed no interference from the endogenous substances tested,
except anti-tTG IgA and IgG at hemolysate level above hemoglobin
concentration of 63 mg/dL. The substances and the maximum levels
tested are shown in the table below:

autoantibodies to DGP and tTG in a multiplex format. Five to eight
patient samples (representing from low to high) were tested in presence of
increasing concentrations of DGP or tTG antigens. Inhibition titers were
evaluated for the five microspheres (i.e., DGP beads, tTG beads, Internal
Standard bead (ISB), Serum Verification bead (SVB) and IgA Verification
Bead (AVB)). The BioPlex 2200 Celiac IgA Kit was evaluated for DGP
IgA and tTG IgA concentrations, SVB values, ISB signal and AVB values
and recoveries in patient samples in the presence of (a) added DGP
antigen and (b) added tTG Antigen. Similarly, BioPlex 2200 Celiac IgG
Kit was evaluated for DGP IgG and tTG IgG concentrations, SVB values,
and ISB signal and recoveries in patient samples in the presence of (a)
added DGP antigen and (b) added tTG antigen. The data from these
studies demonstrate that recombinant DGP and tTG coupled microspheres
in the BioPlex 2200 Celiac IgA or IgG devices specifically detect
antibodies to DGP or tTG, respectively.
In addition, phycoerythrin (PE) conjugated murine monoclonal anti-
human IgA or IgG and PE conjugated sheep anti-human Factor XIII were
tested for cross-reactivity. The signal intensity (RFI) and specificity of
each conjugate was evaluated by mixing/incubating the conjugates with
microspheres covalently coupled with immunoglobulin A,
immunoglobulin G and Factor XIII, and subsequently analyzing on the
BioPlex 2200. The results of these tests demonstrate that each PE
conjugate is specific for their intended antibody target while showing no
cross reactivity to the other antibodies in the multiplex mixture.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cutoff value and assignment of the calibrators are determined by
performing concordance testing and Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC)
analysis using the clinical diagnosis as the standard. The study to determine
the Celiac IgA or IgG assay cutoff is comprised of two sample groups – one
clinical cohort has 123 samples from patients diagnosed as celiac disease and
112 from non-celiac or other rheumatic disease control donors. It was later
confirmed by testing 298 samples from apparently healthy donors.
The cut-off was established to achieve an optimal clinical specificity while
accepting the resultant clinical sensitivity. For anti-tTG IgA or IgG and for
anti-DGP IgA or IgG, the cut-off is 15.0 U/mL.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The performance of the BioPlex® 2200 Celiac IgA and IgG kits was
evaluated in retrospectively collected /repository samples, including 156
samples from patients diagnosed with celiac disease 163 from patients with
other rheumatic or non-CD disease control, celiac IgA deficient patients, and
dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) patients. Results from values in the measuring
range of both the new and the predicate immunoassays are compared. Results
are summarized in the tables below:
