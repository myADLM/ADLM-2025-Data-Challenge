The GenPrime DOA reader system provides only a preliminary analytical result. A more
specific alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result.
Gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (GC/MS), high performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) or liquid chromatography / tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) are the preferred
confirmatory methods. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to
any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are obtained.

4. Special instrument requirements:
The GenPrime DOA Reader
I. Device Description:
The GenPrime Drugs of Abuse (DOA) Reader System consists of a small, portable
high resolution flatbed scanner, customized GenPrime DOA Reader Software, and
lateral flow tests that are intended for use in the system. The scanner has a custom
scanner lid with an opening for the test device, and a scanner stand, which places
the scanner bed at the appropriate angle for running and reading the test devices. The
system is intended for use with two test devices, the OS Cup and the Split
Key Cup, both of which are rapid, single use, disposable immunochromatographic tests
for the qualitative detection of drugs of abuse in human urine.
During analysis, an image of a compatible test device is captured and the software algorithm
determines from the image whether the presence or absence of colored test lines is
associated with a positive or negative result for each analyte on a test format. The
software also confirms the validity of the results by verifying the presence of control
lines.

L. Test Principle:
The GenPrime Drugs of Abuse (DOA) Reader System measures density of visible lines against
background for two single-use immunochromatographic drug test formats: the OS Cup and the
Split Key Cup. At the conclusion of the test (5 minutes for both the OS Cup and the Split Key
Cup), the image of the device is captured by the scanner and the software algorithm determines
from the image whether the presence or absence of colored test lines is associated with a positive or
negative result for each analyte on a test format. The software also confirms the validity of the
results by verifying the presence of control lines. The results are recorded and archived in a
database along with an image of the test, patient and operator information and the time of image
capture.
The OS Cup consists of a test card with drug strips integrated into a one-step urine cup. Each drug
strip consists of: (1) a purple colored pad containing mouse monoclonal anti-drug antibodies
conjugated with colloidal gold and rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated with colloidal gold, and (2) a
nitrocellulose membrane strip containing 1-3 Test lines and a Control line. The Test line is coated
with drug-protein conjugate and the Control line is coated with goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies.
The Split Key Cup consists of a test card with drug strips integrated into a urine cup with a partition
that requires a key activation step to disperse urine into the cup for testing to begin. Each drug strip
consists of: (1) a purple colored pad containing mouse monoclonal anti-drug antibodies conjugated
with colloidal gold and rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated with colloidal gold, and (2) a
nitrocellulose membrane strip containing 1-3 Test lines and a Control line. The Test line is coated
with drug-protein conjugate and the Control line is coated with goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies.
For each cup, a line must form at the Control line position to indicate that sufficient sample was
applied and that the reagents are migrating properly. If a Control line does not form, the test is
invalid.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision studies were performed at three sites representative of laboratory,
workplace, and POC settings with a minimum of two operators per site. The operators
performed the tests following the instructions for use, which are included with the
GenPrime DOA Reader and with each test device intended for use with the GenPrime
DOA Reader System.
Precision studies were performed with the target analytes at 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%,
125%, 150%, 175%, and 200% of the cutoff during a 20 working day period using solutions
containing drug concentrations confirmed by GC/MS. The identity of the samples was
masked from the operator.
Performance of the GenPrime D OA Reader was evaluated for each drug analyte by
testing each drug at the stated concentration using a minimum of 10 tests per operator.

The sponsor conducted several studies to determine the root cause of the poor performance
demonstrated by some of the drug analytes in the precision study shown above. The root cause was
identified to be a preservative contained in the original samples tested. To verify that the root cause was
correctly identified, a supplemental study was conducted at two point of care sites using new samples
that did not contain the interfering substance. Results from this testing compared to the results from the
original precision study are shown in the tables below.

date for shelf-life stability: 12 months for both devices (OS Cup and SK Cup). Shelf-life studies
are ongoing.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical performance of the device around the cutoff is described in the precision section
M.1.a above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Analytical specificity studies were performed to determine whether drugs and drug
metabolites within the same class of drugs or with similar molecular structures cross-
react in the test systems. Reference standards for the various metabolites and
compounds were prepared at 100 µg/mL in pooled negative human urine samples.
Compounds that tested positive were serially diluted until a negative result was
observed. Results shown are expressed as the minimum concentration producing a
positive result in the indicated assay. A list of these compounds and their level of cross
reactivity is shown below for each cup.

pH and Specific Gravity
The GenPrime DOA Reader System was assayed with pH values of 3.0, 4.0, 7.0 and
9.0. Each sample was assayed in triplicate. The pH samples were fortified with drug
concentrations at 50% (negative) and 150% (positive) of cutoff. All pH samples
gave negative results in the 50% of cutoff level for each drug, and all gave positive
results at the 150% of cutoff level for each drug.
The GenPrime DOA Reader System was assayed in triplicate with samples with
specific gravity values of 1.003, 1.015 and 1.030. The specific gravity samples were
fortified with drug concentrations as described above for pH. All specific gravity
samples gave negative results in the 50% of cutoff level for each drug, and all gave
positive results at the 150% of cutoff level for each drug.
Common Drugs
Drug free urine samples were spiked with drug concentrations that were at 50%
