L. Test Principle:
The Precision Xceed Pro Blood Glucose and β-Ketone Monitoring System measures glucose
electrochemically. The glucose biosensor is capable of determining glucose oxidized by the
enzyme (Glucose dehydrogenase, GDH-NAD) catalyzed reaction with Nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide (NAD+) cofactor. The reduced form of NAD + (NADH) is re-oxidized by
reaction with the electrochemical mediator, 1,10-phenanthroline quinone (1,10-PQ). The
reduced mediator is re-oxidized via electron transfer at the electrode surface. This current is
translated into a number by the monitor, after applying lot specific calibration information
and after a 5 second countdown, a concentration value is presented to the user. In this same
manner, the biosensor electrode utilizes the enzyme hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase
(HBDH), which reacts with the beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-ketone) concentration in the
sample. This reaction is transferred to the monitor through an electrical current generated
proportional to the level of beta-ketone in the sample. This current is translated into a number
by the monitor, after applying lot specific calibration information and after a 10 second
countdown, a concentration value is presented to the user.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The meter and strips of the β-ketone assay are identical to the predicate device. While the β -
ketone test strip has been previously cleared on the candidate meter, the glucose test strip has
not. For this reason, performance characteristics for the only glucose assay in the candidate
device are described below. Performance characteristics for the β-ketone assay of this device
are described in the predicate device submission (k080960).
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Ketone precision:
β-ketone precision was established in its predicate k080960.
Glucose precision:
The repeatability study was performed using heparinized anti-coagulated venous
whole blood spiked to five different glucose concentrations, 30-50, 51-110, 111-150,
151-250, and 251-400 mg/dL. Each sample was tested on ten meters using three lots
of test strips. At each concentration, ten measurements were obtained per meter and
test strip lot. The results are summarized below:

b. Linearity:
β-ketone linearity was established in its predicate k080960. The measuring range for
β-ketone is 0.01-8.0 mmol/L.
Glucose linearity: In the linearity study, three blood donor samples were spiked with
dextrose to include glucose concentrations of 23, 47, 78, 130, 197, 262, 336, 406, 482
mg/dL as measured by the YSI-2300. At each glucose level, 9 meters, and 10
replicates of each of 3 strip lots were tested. Values from the 9 meters were compared
with those obtained from YSI. The results from regression analysis are summarized

The results of the linearity study support the claimed measuring range of 20-500
mg/dL for glucose.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability, stability and value assignment –
Test strips:
β-Ketone test strip:
The β-ketone test strips were cleared under k080960 under the name Precision
Xtra Blood β-Ketone Test Strips. The ketone test strip remains unchanged,
however the brand name of the ketone strip has been updated to Freestyle
Precision Pro β-Ketone Test Strip. The stability of the test strips has been
established under k080960.
Glucose test strip:
The Freestyle Precision Pro Glucose Test Strips are sealed in individual foil packets.
Stability information was presented for the Freestyle Precision Pro Glucose Test Strip
to support an 18 month shelf life when stored at 4-30°C.
Control Solutions:
The control solutions were previously cleared and stability and value assignment was
previously established in k983504.
d. Detection limit:
See the linearity study in section M. 1. b. above.
e. Analytical specificity:
The analytical specificity for β-ketone measurement was established in k080960.
Interference studies were performed for the glucose measurement function by
evaluating 25 potential interfering substances spiked into venous blood at two
different glucose levels, 50-100 mg/dL and 250-350 mg/dL. Substances were spiked
into blood samples at a normal/therapeutic and a high concentration. The control
samples were not spiked with the substances. Bias from YSI was compared between
the samples with and without spiked substances to determine whether a particular
substance interferes with glucose measurement. The following table lists the
concentrations of each substance at which no significant interference was detected:

f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
β-ketone accuracy was established in k080960.
Glucose accuracy:
To assess system accuracy, a total of 150 capillary blood samples with glucose values
ranging from 32.5 to 494 mg/dL were evaluated on each of 3 strip lots run with the
FreeStyle Precision Pro Blood Glucose Test Strips and were verified using YSI
reference results. To obtain low or high end glucose values, capillary blood samples
were glycolyzed or spiked. Although 150 subjects were recruited for the study, 7
were excluded for protocol deviations due to early withdrawal or incomplete
sampling. Therefore, only 143 samples were available for analysis for the lay user test.
An additional 20 samples were manipulated samples to meet the glucose distribution
across the range. Therefore, 163 samples were available for the test. The meter results
relative to YSI are as follows:

using wireless transmission?
Yes __X__or No _______
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___ X_ or No ______
3. Specimen Identification:
A barcode scanner of Freestyle Precision Pro Blood Glucose and β-Ketone Monitoring
System is used for scanning hospital patient barcodes and strip lot barcodes. Samples are
applied directly to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The Freestyle Precision Pro Blood Glucose and β-Ketone Monitoring System is intended
to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, or venous, arterial or neonatal
whole blood. Since the whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip, there are
no special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
Scanning the bar code label on each glucose and ketone test strip foil packet prior to use
automatically calibrates the monitor and checks the expiration date.

6. Quality Control:
Glucose and ketone control solutions at three concentrations should be tested with this
device. Acceptable ranges for each control level are printed on the respective test strip
vials. The user is instructed to contact the Customer Help line if control results fall
outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Software documentation: The following documentations related to the software were
reviewed and found to be acceptable. The firm provided documentation to support the
device was designed, developed and is under good software lifecycle processes.
2. Data transmission: Bench testing has been performed on two meters to verify that the
meters meet the requirements of transmitting full data memory and memory rollover via
wireless signal and data cable. The results showed that all data was transmitted
accurately at 100% with no data corruption.
3. Hematocrit Study:
a. Ketone: Hematocrit study for the ketone strip was previously established. The
sponsor’s claim is that hematocrit in the range of 30-60% does not significantly
interfere with ketone results.
b. Glucose: The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated with three lot of test
strips. Blood samples at five concentrations (40-50, 100-120, 210-230, 330-350, 400-
460 mg/dL) were analyzed. The glucose samples were prepared from venous blood at
seven different hematocrit levels 15, 20, 30, 43, 50, 60, and 65%. Glucose results for
each concentration and hematocrit level were compared to samples tested on the YSI
reference method. The data supports the sponsor’s claim that hematocrit in the range of
30-60% does not significantly interfere with glucose measurements.
4. Altitude Study:
a. Ketone: Altitude study for the ketone strip was previously established in k983850 it
says altitude up to 7200 feet does not affect results.
b. Glucose: An altitude study was conducted to evaluate the effect of altitude up to 10,152
feet on performance of the blood glucose monitoring system. Venous whole blood
samples at three glucose concentrations 40, 100, 420 mg/dL were tested on one lot of
test strips. Each sample was also evaluated by the YSI method. At altitudes of 10,152
feet, there was no significant effect on the tested values verified by YSI.
5. Test System operating conditions:
a. Ketone: Test System operating condition for the ketone strip was previously
established.

--- Page 15 ---
b. Glucose: Studies were performed using three lots of test strips, with glucose
concentrations of 40-50, 90-110 and 380-420 mg/dL. Testing was performed at five
combined temperature and humidity conditions (15˚C/10% RH, 15˚C/90%RH,
24˚C/50%RH, 40˚C/10%RH and 40˚C/90%RH) and results compared to the reference
YSI. There were no significant differences relative to YSI in glucose concentrations
across the temperature and humidity ranges tested. Results demonstrated that the test
system can be used at temperatures from 59-104˚F (15-40˚C) and at a relative humidity
from 10-90%.
6. User performance study:
During the lay user study described above in Section M.3.c, the participants were asked to
complete a questionnaire to evaluate the ease of use of the device and the clarity of the
English language labeling. Overall the users indicated that they could successfully
perform the test and that the user manual was written clearly.
7. Readability Assessment:
The readability of the labeling (user guide and test strip insert) using a Flesch-Kincaid
analysis were found to be written at the 8th grade level.
8. EMC Testing:
The sponsor provided the appropriate documentation certifying that acceptable
electromagnetic testing (EMC) had been performed.
9. Infection Control:
Freestyle Precision Pro Blood Glucose and β-Ketone Monitoring System is intended for
multiple–patient use. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials
comprising the meter by an outside commercial testing lab demonstrating complete
inactivation of hepatitis B Virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, Dispatch Hospital
Cleaner Disinfectant Towels with Bleach (EPA Reg. No: 56392-8). Robustness studies
were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in
performance or external materials of the meter after 10,950 cleaning and disinfection
cycles, using Dispatch Hospital Cleaner Disinfectant Towels with Bleach, to simulate 3
years of multiple-patient use. Labeling has been reviewed for adequate instructions in
validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
