I. Device Description:
The Piccolo® MetLac 12 Panel Reagent Disc (which contains the Piccolo® Lactate Test
System) is designed for lithium heparinized whole blood and lithium heparinized plasma.
The disc is an 8 cm diameter single-use device that contains chambers for reagents along the
outer edge of the disc, chambers for the sample and diluent (sealed in diluent container in
the center of the disc), and chambers for dilution of sample. Through capillary action and
centrifugal force, the required quantity of sample and diluent are mixed, and the mixture is
delivered to the reaction cuvettes along the disc perimeter. The diluted sample mixes with
the reagent beads in the reaction chambers, initiating the chemical reactions that are
colorimetrically monitored by the analyzer.

L. Test Principle:
Lactate is oxidized by lactate oxidase (LOX) to pyruvate and hydrogen peroxide (H O ).
2 2
Peroxidase (horseradish) catalyzes the reaction of H O , 4-amoniantipyrine (4-AAP), and
2 2
3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid (DHBSA) into a red dye. The rate of
formation of the dye is proportional to the lactate concentration in the sample. The
reaction is measured bichromatically at 515 nm and 600 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was evaluated per CLSI EP5-A2 using three commercially available
human serum-based controls. Samples were run in duplicate on two instruments

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A human plasma pool spiked with lactate was diluted to produce eleven lactate
levels of samples ranging from 0.19 to 10.55 mmol/L. Each sample was assayed in
quadruplicate on four different analyzers. Results are summarized below using the
first replicate of the data from one analyzer.
Slope 1.016
Intercept -0.023
R2 0.999
The reportable range of this device for lactate measurements is 0.3 to 9.99
mmol/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The reagent discs are calibrated at the manufacturer using 6-8 human lactate pools
that are spiked with lactate covering the reportable range of the assay. The
calibrator lactate values are assigned by a commercially available method, whose
calibration was traceable to a commercially available standard sodium L-lactate.
The pools are then analyzed on the Piccolo® xpress™ analyzer to determine the
enzymatic rate at each level, and a linear regression calibration line is calculated
with the slope and intercept serving as the calibration factors. The calibration
information is bar-encoded on each reagent disc. No user calibration is required.
Quality control beads are included on each reagent disk and automatically run
with each assay. The information from this quality control analysis is stored with
the test results and can be printed by the user. This is the internal build-in control
to check fluidics, spectrophotometer, temperature, and sufficient sample delivery.
In addition, sponsor recommends user to test quality controls according the
federal, state, and local regulations in the labeling.
The shelf life of the lactate assay is 12 months when stored at 2-8oC. Stability
protocols and acceptance criteria for real time stability study for lactate system
were reviewed and considered acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Detection (LoQ)
were determined based on CLSI guideline EP17-A as described below:
Limit of Blank (LoB):
A saline blank sample was assayed sixty times on one day (three times on each of
twenty analyzers). The results were ordered according to their values and the 95th
percentile of the zero-level samples concentration level was deemed as LoB level.
The sponsor claimed the LoB = 0.02 mmol/L.
Limit of Detection (LoD):
5

[Table 1 on page 5]
Slope	1.016
Intercept	-0.023
R2	0.999

--- Page 6 ---
Six low level samples, including 5 samples prepared by diluting a normal human
plasma pool (lowest non-zero lactate calibrator) with saline, and one normal
human plasma pool, were assayed sixty times each on one day (three times on each
of twenty analyzers per sample). The low level samples were examined to see
where 5% or fewer of the observed measurements were below LoB. The sponsor
claimed the LoD = 0.07 mmol/L.
Limit of Detection (LoQ):
The LoQ was determined as the concentration that displayed a total error (TE) of
20% (TE = %bias + 2*%CV). The sponsor claimed the LoQ = 0.11 mmol/L. The
LoQ value supports the sponsor’s claimed measuring range of 0.3 – 9.99 mmol/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
To evaluate potential endogenous interference, two levels of lactate plasma pools
were spiked to prepare at least four test pools containing different levels of the
potential endogenous interferents. Four replicates of each pool were assayed on
four different analyzers and compared to the control pool. The sponsor defined
non significant interference if the bias between control pool and test pool was
within ± 10%. Below are the levels of the endogenous substances that exhibit
≤10% interference.
endogenous substance Level with ≤10% interference (mg/dL)
Hemoglobin 500*
Bilirubin 15*
Triglycerides 3000*
Glucose 700
Uric Acid 30
*Samples with values above these levels will be reported as “HEM”, “LIP”, or
“ICT” on the result card, respectively.
To evaluate potential exogenous interference, 41 drugs were spiked into two levels
of lactate plasma pools. The un-spiked plasma pool served as the control pool.
The control pool and each interferent pool were tested in quadruplicate on four
analyzers. The sponsor defined non significant interference if the bias between
control pool and test pool was within ± 10%.
The following table summarized the 39 substances that showed non significant
interference at the highest concentration tested:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The sponsor performed method comparison study at a POC site using 126
unaltered heparinized whole blood patient samples. In order to obtain samples
with high lactate results, seven samples were allowed to sit at room temperature
for glycolysis process to occur to raise lactate levels. A total of four Piccolo
xpress analyzers were used for the study. Each sample was tested on the predicate
and on one of the four Piccolo® xpress™ analyzers. Both linear and Deming
regression analysis was performed for comparison. Summary data is as follows
(Piccolo® range = 0.30 – 9.88 mmol/L, Predicate range = 0.42 – 9.85 mmol/L).
N=126 Linear Regression Deming Regression
Slope (95% CI) 1.02 (1.01 to 1.04) 1.03 (0.99 to 1.06)
Intercept (95% CI) 0.13 (0.07 to 0.19) 0.06 (-0.01 to 0.14)
Correlation coefficient 0.996 0.996
b. Matrix comparison:
Lithium heparin is the only acceptable anti-coagulant for the lactate assay. Either
whole blood or plasma sample may be used for the test.
Lithium heparinized whole blood and plasma (processed from the whole blood
samples) were collected from 10 individuals and tested in replicates of four on
eight Piccolo® xpress™ analyzers. Samples range tested from 0.68 to 9.81
mmol/L. Deming regression analysis was performed and regression yielded: Y=
1.01X + 0.071, R2= 0.997.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor established the reference range for the Piccolo® Lactate system using
venous lithium heparin whole blood samples collected from 130 apparently healthy
individuals (47% male; 53% female). The reference range was defined by the limits of
the central 95% of values tested.
