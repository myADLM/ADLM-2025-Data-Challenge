L. Test Principle:
The IGMLC test measures the rate of increase in light scattered from particles suspended in
solution as a result of complexes formed during an antigen-antibody reaction. A beam of
light is passed through the cuvette and, as the antigen-antibody reaction proceeds, the light
passing through the cuvette is scattered increasingly as insoluble immune complexes are
formed. The light scatter is monitored by measuring the light intensity at an angle away from
incident light. The IGMLC Reagent and CSF Calibrator are designed for optimal
performance on the IMMAGE Immunochemistry Systems. A curve fit model is applied to
the assay result to create parameters that allow each reagent lot to have its own unique stored
curve. For a CSF sample, the instrument will use a 50 µL sample size and concentration will

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing was performed in accordance with CLSI EP5-A2. Three separate
serum sample pools representing low (32.4 – 43.4 mg/L; Serum-1), mid (432 – 1296
mg/L; Serum-2) and high (1728 – 2160 mg/L; Serum-3) range, and CSF samples
pools representing low (0.15 – 0.20 mg/L; CSF-1), mid (2 – 6 mg/L; CSF-2) and high
(8 – 10 mg/L; CSF-3) range were included in the study. The experimental design
utilized duplicate sample analysis, twice daily, over the course of twenty working
days (n=80). The data were analyzed for within-run, between-run, between-day, and
total precision and the mean U/mL and percent coefficient of variation (%CV) are
summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies were conducted in accordance with CLSI Guideline EP06-A,
Evaluation of Linearity of Quantitative Measurement, Approved Guideline, Second
Edition. Two sample sources, including internal standards traceable to ERM-
DA470k/IFCC and patient sample pools, were used to demonstrate linearity. Each
sample and dilution was evaluated in replicates of five.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The IMMAGE system uses a stored response curve that is created
during manufacture by diluting single-level internal standard which is traceable to the
IFCC reference preparation to plasma protein, material ERM-DA470k/IFCC. The
traceability process is based on EN ISO 17511. The curve is established using
multiple instruments. A curve fit model is applied to the assay result to create
parameters that allow each reagent lot to have its own unique stored curve. The
single point calibrator is also value assigned using the same internal standard that is
used for the stored curve.
Reagent Stability: No change (referred to k993547).
d. Detection limit:
Limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ) were
determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A.
LoB: For serum, four patient sample pools created from IgM negative sera were
assayed daily in replicates of 5 for a period of three days (total 60 data points) on two
instruments. For CSF, CSF diluent was assayed daily in replicates of 5 for a period of
three days (total 15 data points) on two instruments. Datasets were ranked from
lowest to highest for these blank readings and the 95th percentile reading was
determined from this ranking.
LoD: For serum, four pools created from a serum patient sample and IgM depleted
human serum at a mean value ≤ 32.4 mg/L and assayed daily in replicates of 5 for a

period of three days (total 60 data points) on two instruments. For CSF, four pools
patient sample pools at a mean value ≤ 0.15 mg/L created from a CSF patient sample
pool and CSF diluent were assayed daily in replicates of 5 for a period of three days
(total 60 data points) on two instruments.
LoQ: In order to establish LoQ for serum and CSF, three low-concentration IgM
pools were run over 2 reagents lots and 2 instruments. For serum, there were a total
of 45 replicates, 3 reps per pool, 3 pools, and 5 runs. For CSF, there were a total of
40 replicates from 3 pools: 3 reps for two of the pools and 2 reps for the third pool,
and 5 total runs. The LoQ samples were created from an internal standard with a
known value.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison and bias estimation experiments were designed using CLSI
guideline EP09-A2. The testing compared IGMLC pre-design change lots and
IGMLC design changed lots. Eighty (80) CSF and serum specimens with IgM
concentrations spanning the analytical ranges of the two sample types were obtained
from commercial sources, including paired CSF and serum patient samples from
clinical laboratories and commercial sources. About 5% CSF samples (4 of 80
samples) and 12.5% of the serum samples (10 of 80 samples) were contrived. The
method comparison samples were tested internally over multiple days; one run per
day with eight of each of the sample types (CSF and Serum) per day, over a period of
10 days. The IgM values in CSF samples ranged from 0.150 to 8.982 mg/mL while
IgM values in serum samples ranged from 34.73 to 2,156.19 mg/mL (by the new
method). Deming regression analysis was performed to obtain slope, R2, intercept
and a scatter plot of data. Results are summarized in tables below.
