L. Test Principle:
Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in the sample reacts with its substrate, p-nitrophenyl
phosphate (p-NPP), in ethylaminoethanol (EAE) buffer, to release p-nitrophenol
(yellow). The ALP activity is determined by measuring the rate of p-nitrophenol
production. This rate of change in absorbance is directly proportional to the ALP activity in
the serum.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
20-day In-house Precision: The studies followed CLSI EP5-A2, where three levels of
archived (stored frozen) patient serum samples were each tested in two runs, twice a day,
for 20 days on the Hitachi E40 Clinical Analyzer. The results were as follows:
ALP- Low, Level 1, Summary
ALP Within-Run Total
Mean (U/L) 42.7 42.7
SD (U/L) 1.3 2.25

Point-of-Care Precision:
Three levels of samples A (low), B (middle), and C (high) were tested by three
POL sites, six times a day for five days on the Hitachi E40 Clinical Analyzer. The
samples were native (neat) serum specimens (stored frozen). The precision
estimates are described below:

3 C 402.9 13.21 3.3 12.33 3.1
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was conducted based on the CLSI EP6-A guideline by comparing
observed versus expected values for 10 samples. Ten (10) serial dilutions (4 to 1168
U/L were prepared and tested. The dilutions were prepared using a commercial
linearity/calibration set. The calibration samples were assigned their reference values
arithmetically from the labeled values and were tested in duplicate by the Hitachi E40
Clinical Analyzer. The mean Hitachi results (y-axis) were plotted against the expected
values (x-axis). The parameters of linear regression are as follows:
y = 0.9651x + 3.6328
R²=0.999
The ALP assay is linear between 4 U/L and 1106 U/L. The results of the study support
the sponsor’s claim that the Hitachi S Test ALP Reagent Cartridge is linear across the
measuring range of 10 to 1,000 U/L.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Each lot of S TEST ALP cartridges is calibrated by the manufacturer prior to
shipment using material traceable to Japanese Enzyme Reference Material (JC-
ERM). The barcode printed on each cartridge provides the analyzer with lot-
specific calibration data. Alkaline Phosphatase concentration is directly determined
by multiplying the change in absorbance of the unknown sample by the calibrator
factor on the barcode. No user calibration is needed.
Commercially available controls are required but not provided. Users should
follow federal, state, and local regulatory requirements regarding quality control
practices.
d. Detection limit:
Detection limit studies were performed according to CLSI EP17-A Protocols for
Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation. The blank sample for
the reagent system was assayed on the Hitachi Clinical Analyzer E40, 20 times per day
for three days for a total of 60 replicate results to determine LOB. Five low samples were
assayed on the Hitachi Clinical Analyzer E40, 4 times per day for three days for a total of
60 replicate results with the specific reagent cartridges to determine LOD. Each of three
samples targeted at 10 U/L were assayed 6 times per day for three days on three different
analyzers for a total of 54 replicate results to determine LoQ. The LoQ was determined
based on inter-assay precision of < 15% CV.
Analyte LoB (U/L) LoD (U/L) LoQ (U/L)
Alkaline Phosphatase 1.02 1.8 10
The measuring range of the assay was 10 to 1000 U/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed according to CLSI EP7-A2, Interference Testing in
Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline) were performed to determine the effects from
potential interferents. Two levels of commercial control sera (ALP low and high,
approximately 35 U/L and 100U/L) were spiked to six levels with each interferent, and
all seven samples (the 6 spiked samples and the neat, zero baseline sample) were tested
in replicates of three on the Hitachi E40 Clinical Analyzer. In each case, the spiked
sample result mean was compared to its neat control mean result, and recoveries were
calculated. The sponsor claims non significant interference (≤10% difference) for the
substances and concentrations listed in the table below.

b. Matrix comparison
A study was performed to validate the use of two plasma types as an alternative to
serum for the Hitachi Clinical Analyzer E40 with S TEST Reagent Cartridge ALP.
The plasma types were sodium citrate and lithium heparin. Thirty-eight (38) matched
serum/plasma samples that spanned the range of the assay (13 to 967 U/L) were
assayed in singleton. The study set included five diluted samples and six spiked
samples. The results were compared using linear regression (plasma = y-axis, each
type). The performance characteristics were as follows.
N = 38
Range (serum) = 13 to 967 U/L
Sodium Citrate Plasma Heparinized Plasma
Slope (95% CIs) 1.03 (1.01 to 1.05) 1.01 (1.00 to 1.02)
y-intercept (95% CIs) -11.2 (-15.5 to -7.0) -5.4 (-8.3 to -2.6)
r 0.999 0.999
The sponsor claimed that lithium heparin and sodium citrate are acceptable anti-
coagulants to be used with the ALP assay.
