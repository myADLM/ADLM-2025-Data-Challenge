L. Test Principle:
The GluNEOTM/ GluNEO™ Professional blood glucose test is based on the
measurement of glucose concentration in human blood. The principle of the test is
based on the reaction between glucose in the blood sample, FAD-Glucose
Dehydrogenase and mediator. The resulting product generates current that is
proportional to the glucose concentration in the sample. The test strip employs an
electrochemical signal generating an electrical current that will stimulate a chemical
reaction. The reaction is measured and displayed by the meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
All performance characteristics were conducted on GluNEO™ Blood Glucose
Monitoring System and GluNEO™ test strips. Testing performed on the GluNEO™
Blood Glucose Monitoring System and GluNEO™ test strip to characterize
performance of the GluNEO™ Professional Blood Glucose Monitoring System is
adequate since both the GluNEO and GluNEO Professional meters and test strips are
identical.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability studies were performed with venous whole blood samples at five
glucose concentrations (42, 81, 122, 203 and 335 mg/dL). Ten runs were performed
on each sample with 10 replicates per strip lot resulting in a total of 100 replicates
collected for 3 test strip lots on 4 meters and each glucose level tested. Results are
summarized below:

For each concentration, 15 consecutive tests (with 5 measurements per lot) by
GluNEO™ system and 2 measurements with the YSI 2300 Auto analyzer were
performed respectively. The resulting data was compared and the linear regression
analyses were as follows:
Strip Lot Linear Regressions Slope Y-Intercept R2
Lot. #1 y=1.0014-0.2767 1.0014 -0.2767 0.9999
Lot. #2 y=1.0050-1.0940 1.0050 -1.0940 0.9997
Lot. #3 y=1.0004-0.8686 1.0004 -0.8686 0.9999
Combined y=1.0023-0.7464 1.0023 -0.7464 0.9998
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range
of 20 – 600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Test Strip Stability: The sponsor provided a real-time and accelerated testing
protocol and acceptance criteria to verify the closed- (shelf life) and open vial
stability of the test strips. The stability protocols and acceptance criteria were
reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor claims a closed-vial (shelf
life) of 20 months and open-vial stability of 3 months when stored at 36-86°F
and 10%- 85% relative humidity. The labeling instructs the users not to freeze
the test strips.
Traceability:
The GluNEOTM Blood Glucose system is traceable to the NIST SRM 917b
reference material. The method comparison study was performed using the
candidate device and YSI as the reference method. ( see section 2.a.)
Glucose control value assignment and stability:
The glucose controls are the same as the controls in k091157, except in product
name. Value assignment and stability and stability for these controls can be
found in k051285.
d. Detection limit:
See linearity study in Section M.1.b above.
e. Analytical specificity:
To assess potential interference the sponsor used venous whole blood samples

adjusted to three glucose concentrations of 55 mg/dL and 150 mg/dL and 300
mg/dL. Each of these samples was divided into a test pool and a control pool
and each of the potential endogenous and exogenous interfering substances was
added to the test pool. Each substance was tested at a minimum of two
concentrations, normal/therapeutic and high/toxic concentrations. Each sample
was analyzed in replicates of 5. The % difference between the test sample and
the control sample was calculated. The sponsor defines no significant
interference as ≤ ±10 mg/dL difference relative to the control sample with
glucose concentrations <75 mg/dL and ≤ ±10 % with glucose concentrations ³75
mg/dL. Results are presented in the table below:

The labeling states the following :
-Acetaminophen, uric acid, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), and other reducing
substances (when occurring in normal blood or normal therapeutic concentration)
do not significantly affect results. However, abnormally high concentration in blood
may cause inaccurately high results.
-Lipemic samples; cholesterol up to 500 mg/dL or triglyceride up to 3000 mg/dL do
not significantly affect the results.
-Monosaccharide; abnormally high concentration of xylose in blood may cause
inaccurately high results.

Substances that interfere:
For xylose, a dose response study was conducted on 5 xylose levels (0~20 mg/dL)
at three blood glucose concentrations (<60, 150 and >300 mg/dL). It was
determined that the highest level of xylose at which no significant interference
occurs is 10 mg/dL.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To assess system accuracy, results from the GluNEOTM Blood Glucose
Monitoring System were compared to a reference method, YSI 2300.
Fingerstick capillary samples were obtained from 100 participants with glucose
concentrations ranging from 34-502 mg/dL obtained using the reference method.
Trained healthcare professionals at each site collected finger stick blood from on
each participant. In order to obtain sufficient samples in the lowest and highest
concentration intervals, 10 samples were altered: 5 Samples that were < 50
mg/dL and 5 samples > 400 mg/dL were contrived samples and samples between
50 to 400mg/dL were natural samples. 6 meters with 3 test trip lots were used
and the results of the GluNEOTM system relative to reference are summarized in
the tables below:

Alternate site testing:
To assess the performance of alternative site testing using GluNEOTM Blood Glucose
Monitoring System by 3 health professionals, the sponsor performed a study in which
the health professionals performed testing on the candidate device, using blood
samples from 150 participants, collected at the following alternate sampling sites:
dorsal hand, ventral palm, upper arm, forearm, calf and thigh. Results were analyzed
by comparing blood glucose results obtained by the healthcare professional for
GluNEOTM Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems against the YSI 2300 reference value
obtained by trained technicians. The samples ranged from 67 - 569 mg/dL measured
by YSI. The results are summarized in the tables below:

Venous blood samples (EDTA anticoagulant collection tube) were obtained from
100 participants with glucose concentrations ranging from 34-502 mg/dL glucose
obtained using the reference method. Trained healthcare professional at each site
collected venous blood from each participant. In order to obtain sufficient samples
in the lowest and highest concentration intervals, 10 samples were altered. 5
Samples that were < 50 mg/dL and 5 samples > 400 mg/dL were contrived samples
and samples between 50 to 400mg/dL were natural samples. 6 meters with 3 test trip
lots were used and the results of the GluNEOTM system relative to reference are

--- Page 20 ---
5. Calibration:
The system is designed for auto coding . The meter identifies the specified pre-
coded test strip.
6. Quality Control:
Three levels of aqueous glucose control solutions are available with this system
(Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3). Control solution Level 2 is provided with the kit.
Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling.
An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label.
P. Other Supportive Device and Instrument Information:
1) Altitude study:
To evaluate the effects of altitude on the GluNEO Glucose Monitoring System a
study was performed to simulate pressure and oxygen changes from altitude
differences. Altered (spiked and glycolyzed) venous blood samples from three
donors were spiked to 9 glucose concentrations (41, 61, 115, 223, 260, 341, 390, 467
and 552 mg/dL). The blood samples were tested using one test strip lot (90 test
strips) and 5 meters at the simulated altitude and the results compared to those
obtained with the reference method (YSI). The results demonstrate acceptable bias to
the reference to support the claims in the labeling that altitudes up to 10,000 feet have
no significant effect on blood glucose measurements from the GluNEO™ Blood
Glucose Monitoring System.
2) Hematocrit Study:
Venous samples were collected from the median cubital vein from10 donors,
centrifuged and divided it into plasma and red blood cell in order to adjust the
Hematocrit to obtain the following 6 different percentages: 10, 25, 35, 42, 55, 65%.
The concentration of glucose was adjusted in each hematocrit percentage listed
above to the following 10 levels: 15, 41, 69, 115, 172, 254, 375, 443, 518, 650
mg/dL through either glycolysis or analytical spiking. Each sample was tested 15
times with the GluNEO™System. The plasma serum glucose value of the each
levels of sample was measured by YSI 2300 Auto analyzer and the hematocrit of
the sample was measured by NOVA STAT profile and compared to mean of the
YSI 2300 analyzer. The % biases relative to YSI were acceptable within the
claimed hematocrit range of 25 - 65%.
3) Sample volume study:
A sample volume study was performed to verify the test strip minimum sample
volume requirement and the test strip fill error requirement established for the
20

--- Page 21 ---
GluNEOTM BGMS. 5 glucose concentrations were tested ranging from 38~448
mg/dL, as determined by the YSI. Blood at each concentration was applied to strip
at five target sample volumes of 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.8 and 1.0uL. Appropriate sample
volume was determined if the meter results matched the YSI results. The data
shows that sample volume of ≥0.5 μL is the smallest volume to produce acceptable
results.
4) Temperature and humidity study:
Environmental testing was performed in a sealed environmental chamber that can
be controlled for temperature and humidity. Prior to the test, 10 meters and 10 lots
of the test strip were exposed to the following extreme conditions for 1h.
10℃, RH 10% (lowest temperature / lowest humidity)
40℃, RH 10% (highest temperature / lowest humidity)
10℃, RH 90% (lowest temperature / highest humidity)
40℃, RH 90% (highest temperature / highest humidity)
The results demonstrated that GluNEOTM BGMS be used at temperatures of
10~40˚C(50~104 ℉) and 10~90% relative humidity.
5) Usability Study
As part of the user performance study summarized in section M.2.a above, the
participants were asked to complete a questionnaire to evaluate the ease of use of
the device and the clarity of the English language labeling. Overall the users
indicated that they could successfully perform the test and that the user manual was
written clearly.
6) Readability study
Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the results showed that the
labeling for the GluNEO™ Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems (the user manuals,
the strip inserts and the control inserts of both systems(single patient use and multiple
patient use system) have been evaluated for readability and the results shows that all
the labeling were written at 8th grade level.
7) EMC and electrical safety study
EMC and electrical safety testing were evaluated and certified by the third party lab.
The certificates were provided by the sponsor.
8) Infection control studies
The device systems are intended for single-patient use (GluNEO) and multiple-patient
use (GluNEO Professional)
21

--- Page 22 ---
Cleaning and disinfection can be accomplished by wiping the meter and the reusable
lancing device with CaviwipesTM(EPA Reg. No. 46781-8). The robustness study was
conducted and the results demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in
the external materials of the meter and the lancing device after 10,980 cleaning and
disinfection cycles to simulate 3 years of use for both the single patient and
professional users.. Each robustness cycle tested consisted of one pre-clean wipe and
one disinfecting wipe.
Virucidal Efficacy test:
The device system is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy
studies were performed on the materials comprising the meter and lancing device by
an outside commercial testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of
hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, CaviwipesTM (EPA Registration
#46781-8). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating
that there was no change in performance or external materials of the meter and
lancing device after 10980 cleanings and 2 disinfection steps with the 1 wipe ( pre
cleaning with one caviwipe towellet). The robustness studies were designed to
simulate X years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate
instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
9) GlucoDiary data storage and memory roll over study
To assess the storage of the GlucoDiary device and the memory data rollover function,
365 data records were input into GlucoDiary device. The integrity of the stored data
was confirmed by the data in GluNEOTM glucose meters with an accuracy of 100%.
The study demonstrated that the new data will replace the existed data orderly after the
memory area room is full.
10) Usability of the GlucoDiary
A human factor study was performed to verify that participants with average education
and computer skills and no prior knowledge of the system can safely and accurately
use the new device and the data transfer without direct instruction or training. A Study
with 20 participants, downloading 30 data points was conducted and the results
showed that these participants were able to transfer results from the meter to the
GluNEOTM device via USB cable (or a RS-232 port cable) using a software
program (provided in a CD or can be downloaded from the manufacturer website).
