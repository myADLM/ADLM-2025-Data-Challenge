L. Test Principle:
For each genomic sample being tested, two separate PCR reactions are performed. PCR-A
produces an alpha fragment used to detect the mutations in the table below, as well as a
duplication amplimer which indicates the presence of the duplication genotype. PCR-B
produces a beta fragment used to detect the mutations in the table below, as well as a deletion
amplimer indicative of the deletion genotype.
Following PCR amplification, the two reactions (PCR-A and PCR-B) are pooled. To enable

efficient incorporation of biotin-dCTP during the ASPE reaction, the pooled PCR product is
treated with Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase to dephosphorylate any remaining nucleotides
(particularly dCTP), and with Exonuclease I to degrade any primers left over from the PCR
reaction.
ASPE is then carried out using universally-tagged primers supplied in the ASPE primer mix.
An aliquot of the ASPE reaction is hybridized with the universal array (beat Mix) in the
presence of the hybridization buffer and incubated with Streptavidin, R-Phycoerythrin
conjugate (reporter solution).
Samples are read on the Luminex 100 or 200 Instrument and a signal is generated for each of
the loci as well as for the duplication and deletion amplimers, if present. These fluorescence
values are then analyzed to determine whether the wild-type/mutant allele for each of the loci
has been detected, or whether the samples carry an allele(s) with the deletion or duplication.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Please see k093420 for the evaluation of lot to lot and operator to operator
repeatability. For the modified device, a condensed repreatability study was
performed blinded using three lots of kits. Three operators each performed one run
for three non-consecutive days, with each run containing two replicates per run,
resulting in 18 replicates for each sample set in this study. Each repeatability sample
set contained 11 unique samples consisting of whole blood samples collected in tubes
containing either EDTA or citrate, and pre-extracted genomic DNA samples. All
samples were sequenced using bi-directional DNA sequencing to establish the
genotype.

Quality control materials are not provided with the kit. The package insert states that
previously characterized clinical samples or commercially available 2D6 controls are
recommended for quality control testing. All quality control requirements and testing
should be performed in conformance with local, state, and/or federal regulations or
requirement.
See k093240 for stability information. The current claimed shelf-life for the xTAG
CYP2D6 Kit v3 is 12 months. Repeated freeze-thaw cycles (up to 6) are acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
The lower limit of detection and range of the xTAG® CYP2D6 Kit v3 was assessed
by analyzing serial dilutions of three genomic DNA samples and three whole blood
samples. The six samples used in the study had the following genotypes: *1/*1, *2/*4
DUP, *5/*17, *17/*17, *17/*29, and *29/*29. The data were acquired by two
different Luminex 100/200 instruments.
Forty replicates of the six samples were run at six concentrations within the assay
range, which generated 1400 data points across all samples and concentrations. The
positive concordance was determined from the number of correct genotype calls. The
results were as follows:

However, it is recommended that in order to mitigate the potential risk of a user using
a low concentration sample, the recommended lower bound of the assay be 4.0 ng/µL
(24.0 ng total input DNA). The claimed assay range for the xTAG CYP2D6 Kit v3
with refined ASPE formulation is from 4.0 ng/mL to 300 ng/mL.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were performed using bi-directional dideoxy-DNA
sequencing as the comparator for the xTAG® CYP2D6 Kit v3 with the reformulated
ASPE primer mix. DNA sequence analysis for genotype confirmation was performed
for 279 clinical samples that were tested and collected in either EDTA or Citrate
analyzed by xTAG® CYP2D6 Kit v3 with the reformulated ASPE primer mix. The
agreement between the xTAG® CYP2D6 Kit v3 with the reformulated ASPE primer
mix and bi-directional dideoxy sequencing was 100% for the CYP2DG alleles. In
addition, the agreement between results from the xTAG® CYP2D6 Kit v3 with the
reformulated ASPE primer mix and the previous version of the xTAG® CYP2D6 Kit
v3 was 100.0%. The results on a “per allele” basis are summarized below.

Africans and their descendants." Pharmacogenomics 3(2): 229-43.
3 The frequency of the *29 allele in the U.S. population is not known; however, it is very
common in Tanzanian Africans, with an allele frequency of 20 percent (Wennerholm, A.,
I. Johansson, et al. (2001). "Characterization of the CYP2D6*29 allele commonly present
in a black Tanzanian population causing reduced catalytic activity." Pharmacogenetics 11

N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
