Stability:
Shelf-life characteristics for the Range+ QUALICHECK control solutions
were determined using three different lots of each level at 32°C for 10 days
followed by 8°C for 36 months. The products were placed at 32°C for 10
days to assess the potential short term temperature deviations during
transportation and handling. Shelf-life and in-use stability was tested by
measurements on 2 ABL735 analyzers, 6 replicates at each time point (0, 12,
25, and 36 months). Protocols and acceptance criteria have been reviewed
and found to be adequate.
The control solutions are stable for 2 years at 2-8°C.
In-use Stability: Ampoules should be conditioned for at least 5 hours at a
constant temperature between 18°C-32°C before use. The contents should be
used immediately after opening.
Value Assignment
The sponsor provided assigned values and control ranges for each level. To
determine the assigned values and control ranges for Range+ QUALICHECK,
six (6) trays of 1000 ampoules are sampled randomly from the Range+
QUALICHECK batch. Twelve ampoules are sampled from each of the trays
and 72 ampoules are sampled from the reference batch. The samples are
conditioned and shaken at 25°C in a water bath for 6 hours. Measurements
are performed on a minimum of 3 validated ABL7xx series devices with data
collection. Measurement of each parameter is performed alternately on the
reference ampoule and the sample ampoule and repeated 12 times on each
ABL7xx for a total of 144 measurements. Target ranges are calculated based
on the mean ±2SD.
