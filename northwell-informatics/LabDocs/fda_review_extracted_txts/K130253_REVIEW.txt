1. Device Description:
COULTER PrepPlus 2
The COULTER PrepPlus 2 is an automated microprocessor-controlled pipetting and
diluting system designed for automating sample preparation. It is capable of aspirating
and dispensing whole blood samples, Beckman Coulter cleared flow cytometric IVD
reagents and Flow-Count Fluorsphores. The PrepPlus 2 uses 12-tube specimen cassettes
to hold patient samples. The PrepPlus 2 instrument can pierce the caps of specimen tubes
and aliquot the specimens into daughter tubes.
COULTER TQ-Prep Workstation
The COULTER ImmunoPrep Reagent System is used with the COULTER TQ-Prep
Workstation to prepare leukocytes from whole blood for measurements on cleared
Beckman Coulter flow cytometers.
Prior to placement on the TQ-Prep Workstation, the user prepares the whole blood
specimens according to the monoclonal antibody reagent IFU by adding the specified
volume of specimen and monoclonal antibody reagent to 12 x 75 mm test tubes, vortex
mixing, and incubating for the specified times (this can be done manually or with the
PrepPlus2). Up to 32 samples containing the premixed sample of blood and antibody are
presented to the TQ-Prep Workstation from a carousel capable of holding up to 32 test
tubes. Then the TQ-Prep Workstation automatically adds, in this order:
§ ImmunoPrep A Reagent – an erythrocytic lysing reagent which causes
1

--- Page 2 ---
simultaneous rapid destruction of the erythrocytes while leaving the leukocytes
intact
§ ImmunoPrep B Reagent – a leukocyte stabilizer which stops the action of the
lysing reagent (ImmunoPrep A), and
§ ImmunoPrep C Reagent – a cell membrane fixative which fixes the cell
membranes preserving the form and structure of the leukocytes.
The TQ-Prep vortex mixes the sample with the addition of each reagent for specified
times. Upon completion of specimen processing on the TQ-Prep Workstation, the
samples are removed from the device and presented separately to a flow cytometer for
analysis.
2. Principles of Operation:
COULTER PrepPlus 2
The PrepPlus 2 is a robotic module which has three functional axes: X/Y/Z. These axes
are driven by stepper motors which are controlled by microprocessors mounted on
printed circuit boards. The PrepPlus 2 is designed to move its sample probe tip to
specific locations, detect liquid, and aspirate or dispense liquid. The PrepPlus 2 uses 12-
tube specimen cassettes to hold patient samples. Only one orientation is permitted with
respect to cassette introduction to the instrument. Orientation of the cassette on the
device is controlled by the shape of the cassette and the receiving cradle and locking
handle on the PrepPlus 2. It is physically impossible to seat the cassette onto the cradle
in any orientation except the correct one. Specimen loading order on the device is
identified by the numbers on the top of the cassette receiver as shown in the image below.
The front side cassette orders tubes from 1-12 in a left to right orientation. The back side
cassette orders tubes from 13-24 from right to left. There are two software programs that
come with the PrepPlus 2:
§ Operating System: This is loaded into the TQ-Prep Workstation when the
PrepPlus 2 is installed. The user runs both the PrepPlus 2 and the TQ-Prep
Workstation from the TQ-Prep Workstation touch screen commands.
§ Panel Definition software: This is provided on 3½ in. disks. The user can load it
into any computer that fits the requirements defined in the product labeling. This
software allows user to define panels, reagent racks, and control/calibrator racks.
COULTER TQ-Prep Workstation
The TQ-Prep Workstation has a system microprocessor located on the Control Interface
card controls the motors, sensors, syringes, the cover/lid interlock switches, reagent level
sense probes and an internal communication link to the system microprocessor assembly.
The TQ-Prep Workstation PREP I system is partitioned into the following modules:
§ MQP Module: consists of assemblies which include electronics and mechanisms
to rotate the reaction carousel, to move the reaction tube under the reagent
delivery head, to move the reagent delivery head to the delivery position, to
dispense lyse, fixative and stabilizing reagent to the reaction tube, to mix the
2

--- Page 3 ---
reaction tube, and to remove reagent prime fluid to waste. The chassis and door
consists of mechanical elements which provide structural support and protection
for the instrument components. The covers and skins provide cosmetic value.
The hardware user interface consists of a touch screen display.
§ Software Module: consists of program instructions and data to control the
operation of the MQP and User Interface modules.
§ Reagents Module: consists of the current ImmunoPrep reagents lysing agent,
fixative and stabilizing reagents and the Option reagent (distilled water).

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was conducted according to CLSI EP5-A2, Evaluations of
Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods. Two levels of control
materials (IMMUNO-TROLCells and IMMUNO-TROL Low Cells) and Flow-Count
Fluorospheres were evaluated in this study. The IMMUNO-TROL and IMMUNO-
TROL Low control cells were prepared 2 times per day, with at least a two-hour
interval, stained with CYTO-STAT tetraCHROME reagents CD45-FITC/CD4-
RD1/CD8-ECD/CD3-PC5 and CD45-FITC/CD56-RD1/CD19-ECD/CD3-PC5,
respectively, and acquired twice on a FC 500 flow cytometer, for a total of 23 days
for a total of 276 measurements. Three complete systems comprised of a TQ-Prep,
PrepPlus 2, and FC 500 flow cytometer with tetraCXP software were tested. Within-
run, between-run, between-days, between-instrument and total reproducibility were
calculated. Measurements for this study were the absolute counts and percentages of
the following lymphocyte subsets: CD3+, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+, CD3-CD56+,
CD19+. The manufacturer’s acceptance criteria were as follows:

Study results indicate that the device system performed according to the
manufacturer’s acceptance criteria.
A gravimetric study was also performed to evaluate the accuracy and precision of the
fluid handling elements in the TQ-Prep and PrepPlus 2 sample preparation devices.
Three of each instrument were tested by dispensing at least 20 replicates of each of
their respective fluids. The results were analyzed for precision of the specified
dispensed volumes against their respective specifications. The gravimetric studies
demonstrated that the TQ-Prep and PrepPlus 2 performance for pipetting patient
samples, controls, and reagents was found to be within the manufacture’s
specifications that the TQ-Prep and PrepPlus 2 perform with adequate accuracy and
precision for delivering patient samples, controls, and reagents.
c. Linearity:
Not applicable
d. Carryover:
Specimen and Reagent Carryover were carried out to test both the carryover of cells
and antibody reagents. Carryover was assessed based on recommendations contained
in CLSI Document: H26-A2, Validation, Verification, and Quality Assurance of
Automated Hematology Analyzers; Approved Standard -- Second Edition. The
studies were performed on three systems (each system composed of the TQ-Prep,
PrepPlus 2 and FC 500 with textraCXP software) by running three high concentration
samples analyzed consecutively three times (HTv1, HTv2, HTv3) followed
immediately by testing a low concentration sample three times (LTv1, LTv2, LTv3).
This run was repeated three times on each of the three systems, for both the specimen
and reagent carryover studies. The percent carryover for specimen and reagent is
calculated for absolute cell counts by formula referenced in H26-A2 (%Carryover =
((LTv1-LTv3)/(HTv3-LTv3))x100). These studies indicated that the complete
systems, composed of the TQ-Prep, PrepPlus 2, and FC 500 with tetraCXP software,
