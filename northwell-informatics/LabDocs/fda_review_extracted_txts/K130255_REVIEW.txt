The Hemoglobin A assay is used in clinical laboratories for the quantitative
1c
in vitro measurement of percent hemoglobin A (NGSP) or HbA fraction mmol/mol (IFCC) in
1c 1c
human whole blood and hemolysate on the ARCHITECT c 8000 System.
Hemoglobin A measurements are used as an aid in the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, as an aid to
1c
identify patients who may be at risk for developing diabetes mellitus, and for the monitoring of long-
term blood glucose control in individuals with diabetes mellitus.
The Hemoglobin A Calibrators are for use in the calibration of the Hemoglobin A assay on the
1c 1c
ARCHITECT c 8000 System.
The Hemoglobin A Controls are for the estimation of test precision and the detection of systematic
1c
analytical deviations of Hemoglobin A1c assay on the ARCHITECT c 8000 System.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
· For prescription use only
· This device has significant negative interference with fetal hemoglobin (HbF). HbA1c results
are invalid for patients with abnormal amounts of HbF including those with known
Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin.
· Glycated HbF is not detected by the assay as it does not contain the β-chain that characterizes
HbA1c. However, HbF is measured in the total Hb assay and as a consequence, specimens
containing high amounts of HbF (>5%) may result in lower than expected mmol/mol HbA1c
values (IFCC) and % HbA1c values (DCCT/NGSP).
· The Hemoglobin A assay should not be used to diagnose diabetes during pregnancy.
1c
Hemoglobin A reflects the average blood glucose levels over the preceding 3 months (i.e.,
1c
the average life span of a red blood cell) and therefore may be falsely low during pregnancy
or any other condition associated with recent onset of hyperglycemia and/or decreased red
blood cell survival.
· The Hemoglobin A1c assay should not be used to diagnose or monitor diabetes in patients
with the following conditions:
-hemoglobinopathies except as demonstrated to produce acceptable performance (e.g., sickle
cell trait)
-abnormal red blood cell turnover. (e.g., anemias from hemolysis and iron deficiency)
-malignancies, and severe chronic hepatic and renal disease
· In cases of rapidly evolving Type 1 diabetes, the increase of HbA1c values might be delayed
compared to the acute increase in glucose concentrations. In these conditions, diabetes
mellitus must be diagnosed based on plasma glucose concentrations and/or the typical
clinical symptoms.
· This test should not replace glucose testing for patients with Type 1 diabetes, pediatric
patients or pregnant women.

L. Test Principle:
The Hemoglobin A1c assay consists of two separate concentration measurements: glycated
hemoglobin (HbA1c) and total hemoglobin (THb). The two concentrations are used to determine the
percent HbA1c (NGSP units) or the hemoglobin fraction in mmol/mol (IFCC units). The individual
concentration values of HbA1c and THb generated by the Hemoglobin A1c assay are used only for
calculating the percent hemoglobin A1c or HbA1c fraction, and must not be used individually for
diagnostic purposes. The anticoagulated whole blood specimen is lysed automatically on the system for
the Whole Blood application or may be lysed manually using the Hemoglobin A1c Diluent for the
Hemolysate application.
Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c)
The Hemoglobin A1c assay utilizes an enzymatic method that specifically measures N-terminal
fructosyl dipeptides of the β-chain of HbA1c. In the pretreatment process, the erythrocytes are
lysed and the hemoglobin is transformed to methemoglobin by reaction with sodium nitrite. With the
addition of Reagent 1 to the sample, the glycosylated N-terminal dipeptide (fructosyl-VH) of the β-
chain of hemoglobin is cleaved by the action of protease. The hemoglobin is transformed to stable
methemoglobin azide by the action of sodium azide and the concentration of the hemoglobin is
determined by measuring absorbance. Addition of Reagent 2 starts a reaction and fructosyl
peptideoxidase (FPOX) is allowed to react with fructosyl-VH. The HbA1cconcentration is measured
by determining the resultant hydrogen peroxide.

Hemoglobin A1c assay based on guidance from the CLSI document EP5-A2, Evaluation of
Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods. Testing was performed using 3 lots of
Hemoglobin A1c Reagents, 3 lots of Hemoglobin A1c Calibrators, 1 lot of Hemoglobin A1c
Controls (Low and High), and 1 lot of commercially available human whole blood controls (Control
Levels 1, 2, and 3) on 3 ARCHITECT c 8000 analyzers. Three levels of controls made from
reconstituted lyophilized anticoagulated human whole blood and three levels of pooled human
anticoagulated venous whole blood (panels) were tested a minimum of 2 replicates, twice per day,
for a total of 20 testing days. Total number of measurements per sample was 720 (=3 instruments x 3
lots x 20 days x 2 runs x 2 replicates). Results are shown below in NGSP and IFCC units. The
HbA1c sample abbreviations are as follows: LC= Hemoglobin A1c Low Control (target value 5.2
%), HC= Hemoglobin A1c High Control (target value 10.0%), CL3= commercially available control
level 3 (target value14.6%); PS1 = human whole blood near the lower limit of the measuring interval
(target range 4.0-4.6%), PS2=human whole blood near the medical decision point (target range 6.0-
7.0%) PS3= human whole blood above the medical decision point (target range 8.0-10.0%).

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The Architect HbA1c assay standardization is traceable to the International Federation of Clinical
Chemistry (IFCC) reference calibrators. The Architect HbA1c assay is NGSP certified. The NGSP
certification expires in one year. See NGSP website for current certification at http://www.ngsp.org.
The derived result of (%) from the NGSP correlation is calculated from the individual
quantitative results for total hemoglobin and Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). The IFCC units of
mmol/mol are calculated using the Master Equation IFCC=(NGSP-2.15/0.092). Two different
units are provided to the users: NGSP equivalent units (%) and IFCC equivalent units
(mmol/mol)
Value Assignment
The ARCHITECT HbA1c calibrators are aligned to IFCC reference calibrators through internal
value assignment in which calibrator values must meet the sponsor’s pre-determined acceptance
criteria within a set specification, determined by the manufacturer.
Each lot of calibrators is value-assigned. The concentration of glycated hemoglobin
(HbA1c) and total hemoglobin (THb) is provided for each lot. Calibrators are prepared
gravimetrically, lyophilized, and then value assigned using secondary calibrators that
are traceable to the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory
17

the sponsor were reviewed and found acceptable to support the claimed conditions.
Open-vial claims: The recommended storage condition for in-use calibrators and controls is 2-8 °C
and is stable for 10 days post-reconstitution. Labeling indicates not to freeze the control and
calibrator materials. The storage and stability study protocols and acceptance criteria provided by
the sponsor were reviewed and found acceptable to support the claimed conditions.
On-board stability for the ARCHITECT HbA1c was established by real time studies on the
ARCHITECT c8000 analyzer and demonstrated on-board reagent stability of 50 days. The unopened
ARCHITECT HbA1c reagent is stable until the expiration date printed on the label when stored at 2
to 8°C. The storage and stability study protocols and acceptance criteria provided by the sponsor
were reviewed and found acceptable to support the claimed conditions.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) and Detection (LoD)
A Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) study was performed based on
guidance from the CLSI document EP17-A, Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection
and Limits of Quantification.
The limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined by assaying two
analyte free samples (blank) and five low HbA1c samples. The zero-level samples were tested in
a minimum of three replicates and the low-level samples were tested in a minimum of two
replicates. Five separate runs were performed over a minimum of three days using two lots of
Hemoglobin A Reagents, two lots of Hemoglobin A Calibrators, and one lot of commercially
1c 1c
available controls on two ARCHITECT c 8000 instruments. The detection limits are summarized
in the table below.

The ARCHITECT HbA1c assay has a reportable range of 4.0-14.0%.
(20.22-129.51 mmol/mol HbA1c)
e. Analytical specificity:
i.) An interference study was performed based on CLSI EP7-A2 guideline to assess common or
known substances that could interfere with the HbA1c assay. The potential interferents listed
below were spiked into human EDTA whole blood samples with different levels of % HbA1c
(approximately 6.5 and > 8.0% HbA1c). Each sample was tested in replicates of 14. The %
HbA1c values of the spiked samples were compared to the reference samples containing no
interferent. Significant interference was defined as greater or equal to ±5% difference from the
expected concentration. The interference study results are summarized in the following table:
Potential Interferent Highest Tested Concentration at
which no significant interference
(≥±5%) was observed
Bilirubin, conjugated 15 mg/dL
Bilirubin, unconjugated 10 mg/dL
Total Protein 22g/dL

The hemoglobin variant interference study was performed according to guidance from the CLSI
EP7-A2. Interference effects were assessed by comparing the Hemoglobin A1c values to a
comparative method for samples containing potentially interfering hemoglobin variants. The
samples were tested in duplicate using one lot of HbA1c Reagents on one ARCHITECT c 8000
analyzer. The numbers and concentrations hemoglobin variants tested, and the range of %
HbA1c concentrations in which they were tested are shown below:
Hemoglobin Range in % Abnormal Range in %HbA
1c
Variant n Variant Concentration
HbC 21 33% - 42% 5.2 - 9.3
HbD 20 35% - 41% 5.2 - 10.7
HbE 20 27% - 32% 5.0 - 10.1
HbS 20 33% - 44% 5.1 - 9.9
HbA2 26 4.7% - 8.5% 4.7 – 13.3
HbF 19 3% - 27.8% 5.2 - 9.0
The results for the hemoglobin variant study are summarized below:
Relative % Bias from Reference Method

Hemoglobin Variant ~ 6.0 %HbA ~ 9.0 %HbA
1c 1c
HbC -1.6 -1.9
HbD -0.8 1.8
HbE 0.0 4.3
HbS -1.4 4.7
HbA2 -0.6 -0.5
Bias exceeds -5% when the amount of HbF in the sample exceeds
HbF
5% a
a A negative bias with HbF is directly proportional in magnitude to the % HbF present in the sample.
NOTE: The presence of multiple variants in a sample may impact the % bias.
The sponsor claims that no significant interference was observed for the HbC, HbD, HbE, HbS,
and HbA2 variants at the concentrations tested above.

Hemoglobin F Interference
The interference study results demonstrate there is significant interference due to the presence of
HbF in the sample. The extent of interference is directly proportional to the amount of HbF
contained within the sample. For example, significant interference that produces a negative bias
of 5% in HbA1c results was observed with specimens containing 5% HbF; and a negative bias of
23% in HbA1c results was observed in samples containing 28% HbF.
In addition, the device labeling contains the following prominent boxed warning in the package
insert labeling:
WARNING: The Hemoglobin A1c assay has significant interference with the fetal
hemoglobin (HbF). Hemoglobin A1c results are invalid for patients with abnormal
amounts of HbF, including those with known Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin.
iii) A drug interference study was performed using a low level whole blood sample with a
concentration value of between 6.0 and 7.0% HbA1c and a high whole blood sample with a
concentration value of ≥ 8.0% HbA1c. Test sample were prepared by spiking each drug at the
interferent concentrations into the low and high samples. The test and reference samples were
tested in a minimum of 12 replicates using 1 lot of HbA1c reagents and calibrators. The sponsor
defined significant interference as greater or equal to ±5% difference from the expected
concentration.
The sponsor states that the HbA1c assay is not susceptible to interference effects from the
following drugs at the listed concentration levels evaluated.

iv.) A hemoglobin derivative study was performed using a low level whole blood sample with a
concentration between 6.0 and 7.0% HbA1c and a high whole blood sample with a concentration
of ≥ 8.0% HbA1c. The potentially interfering hemoglobin derivatives were prepared by adding
the following substance at the levels shown below.
• Acetylated Hemoglobin ≥ 50 mg/dL of ASA (aspirin)
• Carbamlyated Hemoglobin ≥ 10 mmol/L of Cyanate
• Labile Hemoglobin ≥ 1000 mg/dL of Glucose
The test samples were prepared by spiking the substances at the interferent concentration listed
above into the low and high samples. The test and reference samples were tested in a minimum
of 12 replicates. Significant interference was defined as ± 5% when comparing test samples
containing the potentially interfering hemoglobin derivatives to the corresponding reference
samples.
The sponsor states that the HbA1c assay is not susceptible to interference effects from the
hemoglobin derivatives at the interference levels evaluated.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study using human EDTA whole blood specimens (n=128) was performed
based on CLSI EP9-A2, Method Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples
guidelines. Each sample was analyzed internally in replicates of two, using two lots each of
HbA1c reagents and HbA1c calibrators on two ARCHITECT c 8000 analyzers over a minimum
of 5 days. The samples were also tested in duplicate with an NGSP secondary reference
laboratory using a FDA cleared HPLC-based method, the Tosoh G8. The total number of
comparison results obtained was 256. The sample range tested was 4.0 to 13.2% HbA1c. The
method comparison was performed using both the hemolysate and whole blood application. The
distribution of samples spanned the measuring interval with a concentration of samples around
the clinical decision points as follows:
%HbA Level* Number of Samples

b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix study was performed to determine the suitability of different anticoagulant collection
tube types for use in the ARCHITECT HbA1c assay. Specimens with concentration values
spanning the measuring interval of the assay (4.0 to14.0% HbA1c) were collected from a
minimum of 43 different donors in the control tube type (Dipotassium EDTA, plastic) and in the
following tube types under evaluation:
· Lithium heparin
· Sodium heparin
· Sodium Fluoride/Disodium EDTA
· Tripotassium EDTA
The blood collection tubes collected from one individual constituted one sample set. Each
sample was tested in a minimum of 2 replicates. using one lot of HgA1c reagents and HbA1c
calibrators on one ARCHITECT c 8000 analyzer.
The regression results are as follows:
Dipotassium-EDTA Control vs Tube Types

HbA1c Value Glycemic Goal
< 8% HbA1c (64 mmol/mol) Less stringent
< 7% HbA1c (53 mmol/mol) General (Non-Pregnant Adults)
< 6.5% HbA1c (48 mol/mol) More stringent
As recommended by the ADA, patients in the range of 5.7 - 6.4% HbA1c (39-46 mmol/mol) would
be in the category of increased risk for diabetes and results ≥6.5% HbA1c (48 mmol/mol) may aid in
the diagnosis of diabetes.
HbA1c levels higher than the upper end of this reference range are an indication of hyperglycemia
during the preceding 2 to 3 months or longer. According to the recommendations of the American
Diabetes Association values above 48 mmol/mol HbA1c (IFCC) or 6.5 % HbA1c (DCCT/NGSP)
are suitable for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Patients with HbA1c values in the range of 39-46
mmol/mol HbA1c (IFCC) or 5.7-6.4 % HbA1c (DCCT/NGSP) may be at a risk of developing
diabetes. 1, 2
HbA1c levels may reach 195 mmol/mol (IFCC) or 20 % (DCCT/NGSP) or higher in poorly
controlled diabetes. Therapeutic action is suggested at levels above 64 mmol/mol HbA1c (IFCC) or
8 % HbA1c (DCCT/NGSP). Diabetes patients with HbA1c levels below 53 mmol/mol HbA1c
(IFCC) or 7 % HbA1c (DCCT/NGSP) meet the goal of the American Diabetes Association.3, 4
HbA1c levels below the established reference range may indicate recent episodes of hypoglycemia,
the presence of Hb variants, or shortened lifetime of erythrocytes.
Each laboratory should investigate the transferability of the expected values to its own patient
population and if necessary determine its own reference ranges.
