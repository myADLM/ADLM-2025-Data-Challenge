I. Device Description:
The BD ProbeTec Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) Qx Amplified DNA Assay (TV Qx Assay) is
based on the simultaneous amplification and detection of target DNA using amplification
primers and fluorescently-labeled detector probes. The assay employs strand displacement
amplification (SDA) technology in similar fashion to the previously cleared assays k081824,
k081825, and k103798. The reagents for SDA are dried in two separate disposable
microwells: the Priming Microwell contains the amplification primers, fluorescently-labeled
detector probe, nucleotides and other reagents necessary for amplification, while the
Amplification Microwell contains the two enzymes (a DNA polymerase and a restriction
endonuclease) that are required for SDA. The assay is designed for use with the BD
ProbeTec Qx specimen collection and transport devices, applicable reagents, the BD Viper
System, and BD FOX™ Extraction Tubes. The BD Viper System pipettes a portion of the
purified DNA solution from each Extraction Tube into a Priming Microwell to rehydrate the
contents. After a brief incubation, the reaction mixture is transferred to a corresponding, pre-
warmed Amplification Microwell which is sealed to prevent contamination and then
incubated in one of the two thermally-controlled fluorescent readers. The presence or
absence of T. vaginalis DNA is determined by calculating the peak fluorescence (Maximum
Relative Fluorescent Units (MaxRFU)) over the course of the amplification process and by
comparing this measurement to a predetermined threshold value.

L. Test Principle:
The BD ProbeTec Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) Qx Amplified DNA Assay is based on strand
displacement amplification (SDA) technology. The TV Qx assay is designed to target unique
sequences within the T. vaginalis genome, a 138 base pair region of AP65-1 Adhesion
Protein gene.
All specimens undergo a pre-warm step in the BD Viper Lysing Heater to dissolve mucus
which may be present in certain specimens and to homogenize the specimen. After cooling,
the specimens are loaded onto the BD Viper System which then performs all the steps
involved in extraction and amplification of target DNA, without further user intervention.
The specimen is transferred to an Extraction Tube that contains ferric oxide particles in a
dissolvable film and dried Extraction Control. A high pH is used to lyse the cells and liberate
the DNA into solution. Acid is then added to lower the pH and induce a positive charge on
the ferric oxide, which in turn binds the negatively charged DNA. The particles and bound
DNA are then pulled to the sides of the Extraction Tube by magnets and the treated specimen
is aspirated to waste. The particles are washed and a high pH Elution Buffer is added to
recover the purified DNA. Finally, a Neutralization Buffer is used to bring the pH of the
extracted solution to the optimum for amplification of the target. The BD Viper System
pipettes a portion of the purified DNA solution from each Extraction Tube into a Priming

Microwell to rehydrate the contents. The reaction mixture is transferred to a corresponding,
pre-warmed Amplification Microwell that contains the enzymes (DNA polymerase and
restriction endonuclease) for Strand Displacement Amplification. The amplification well is
then sealed to prevent contamination and incubated in one of the two thermally-controlled
fluorescent readers. The presence or absence of T. vaginalis DNA is determined by
calculating the peak fluorescence (MaxRFU) over the course of the amplification process and
by comparing this measurement to a predetermined threshold value. The magnitude of the
MaxRFU score is not indicative of the level of T. vaginalis DNA in the specimen.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Reproducibility
Reproducibility of TV Qx Assay was evaluated at two external and one internal site on
one BD Viper System per site. Panels were comprised of four levels of T. vaginalis
(ATCC strain 30001) seeded into urine specimen matrix or vaginal matrix in Qx
diluent. Each panel member was either left unspiked (negative), or was spiked with
known amounts of T. vaginalis organism at 0.3X (high negative), 1X (low positive),
and 3X LOD (moderate positive) for each respective specimen matrix. Samples in
each panel were randomized and blinded to the user prior to shipment to the testing
sites. Three replicates of each panel member were tested twice a day for five days on
each BD Viper System in Extracted Mode.
The following table presents, for each panel member, MaxRFU data in terms of
mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) between sites, ,
between runs, within runs, and between days. Percent agreement with expected
results is also shown. Samples with valid results were included in the analyses. The
results indicate reproducible performance within and across all three sites for all panel
members tested when compared to the expected outcome.

* Four non-reportable results were due to extraction control failures which caused a reduction in the full number of
replicates at one test site.
b. Precision
Precision of the TV Qx assay was evaluated at one site over multiple days, by four
users testing three instruments across calibration cycles, and multiple organism spike
levels. Testing occurred in four phases on each of the three BD Viper Systems. Each
phase consisted of three days of testing with two runs per day on three BD Viper
Systems. The study was designed to capture the potential variation across calibration
cycles with each instrument. Usually, the BD Viper System is calibrated every 30
days. In this study, the calibration cycles were artificially condensed to allow a
shorter real-time interval between test phases.

Urine Specimen Stability:
Data to support the recommended storage and transport conditions for neat urine was
generated with negative female urine specimens spiked with T. vaginalis strain 30001
at 3X LOD. Twenty-four assay replicates were tested for each condition (sample
type/temperature/duration). The study results demonstrated the urine stability for the
following conditions:
2–8°C for up to 7 days; 30°C for 18 and 24 hours; -20°C for up to 180 days.
Vaginal Dry and Expressed Swab Stability:
Pools of T. vaginalis negative vaginal swab matrix were used in analytical
experiments to support the storage and transport stability claims for dry vaginal swabs
and vaginal swabs expressed in Qx swab diluent. Pools were spiked with T. vaginalis
strain ATCC 30001 at 3X LOD. Twenty four assay replicates were tested for each
condition (sample type/temperature/duration). The data supported the stability for
dry vaginal swab specimens at 2 – 8°C for up to 14 days, at 30°C for up to 3 days, or
at -20°C for up to 180 days and the stability of the expressed vaginal swab specimens
at 2–8°C or 30°C for up to 30 days or at -20°C for up to 180 days.
Endocervical Swab Specimen Stability:
Pools of negative endocervical swab matrix were spiked with T. vaginalis strain
ATCC 30001 at 3X LOD in this study that demonstrated the endocervical swab
specimens were stable at 2–8°C or 30°C for up to 30 days or at -20°C for up to 180
days. Twenty four assay replicates were tested for each condition (sample
type/temperature/duration).
Post Pre-Warm Specimen Stability
Pools of T. vaginalis negative neat urine matrix were used to support the storage
claims for pre-warmed neat urine specimens. Pools of neat urine were spiked with T.
vaginalis ATCC strain 30001 at 3X LoD. The neat urine pools were dispensed in 2
mL volumes into BD Viper specimen tubes. The specimen tubes were pre-warmed at
114°C for 15 minutes and cooled for 15 minutes. After the pre-warm process, the
specimen tubes were stored at 2–8°C for up to 7 days, at 30°C for up to 3 days, and at
-20°C for up to 180 days. At each time point, samples were removed from storage
and tested with the TV Qx Assay on the BD Viper System in extracted mode.
Twenty-four assay replicates were tested for each condition (sample
type/temperature/duration) demonstrating that the urine specimens are stable at the
above conditions after the pre-warm process.
Pools of T. vaginalis negative vaginal and endocervical swab specimen matrices in Qx
Swab Diluent were used to support the storage stability claims for pre-warmed
expressed vaginal and endocervical swab specimens. For both types of matrices,
pools were spiked with T. vaginalis strain ATCC 30001 at 3X LOD and aliquoted
into 2 mL volumes in BD Viper specimen tubes. The tubes were pre-warmed at
114°C for 15 minutes and cooled for 15 minutes. After the pre-warm process, the
specimen tubes were stored either at 2–8°C or 30°C for up to 30 days, or at -20°C for
7

--- Page 8 ---
up to 180 days. At each time point, samples were removed from storage and
evaluated with the TV Qx Assay on the BD Viper System in extracted mode. Twenty
four assay replicates were tested for each condition (sample
type/temperature/duration). The results supported the post pre-warm stability for
expressed vaginal and endocervical swab specimens under above mentioned
conditions.
Quality Control Results and Acceptability:
External Controls:
The control set for the assay is provided separately. One Positive and one Negative
Control must be included in each assay run and for each new reagent kit lot number.
Controls must be positioned according to the BD Viper Instrument User’s Manual.
The CT/GC/TV Qx Positive Control will monitor for substantial reagent failure only.
The CT/GC/TV Qx Negative Control monitors for reagent and/or environmental
contamination.
The CT/GC/TV Qx Positive Control is comprised of recombinant plasmids that
contain the SDA target regions for the CT Qx, GC Qx and TV Qx Assays. The
plasmids are not necessarily representative of native target DNA detected by the
assay (e.g., their overall length is shorter than that of the complete gene or genomic
sequence), nor are the controls representative of the specimen matrices indicated for
use with the assays on the BD Viper System in extracted mode. The TV Qx Negative
Control is comprised of the same milieu as the Positive Control but without the
plasmid DNA. The Positive and Negative Control formulations are dried in separate
4.5 mL specimen tubes. A QC pair (Positive Control and Negative Control) must be
logged in for each plate to be tested and for each reagent kit lot number.
The location of the microwells is shown in a color-coded plate layout screen on the
LCD Monitor. The plus symbol (+) within the microwell indicates the positive QC
sample. The minus symbol (-) within the microwell indicates the negative QC
sample.
The CT/GC/TV Qx Positive Control and the CT/GC/TV Qx Negative Control must
test as positive and negative, respectively. If controls do not perform as expected, the
run is considered invalid and results will not be reported by the instrument. If either
of the controls does not provide the expected results, the entire run should be repeated
using a new set of controls, new extraction tubes, new extraction trough, new lysis
trough, and new microwells.
The Extraction Control (EC):
Each extraction tube contains a dried fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide that is
incorporated into each tube. EC is labeled with a dye different that that used for
detection of T. vaginalis specific target and is used to confirm the validity of the
extraction process. The EC is dried in the Extraction Tubes and is rehydrated by the
BD Viper System upon addition of the specimen and extraction reagents. At the end
of the extraction process, the EC fluorescence is monitored by the instrument and an
8

--- Page 9 ---
automated algorithm is applied to both the EC and TV Qx Assay specific signals to
report results as positive, negative, or EC failure.

e. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LOD) for the TV Qx Assay on BD Viper System was
determined in specimen matrices (vaginal swab, endocervical swab, and urine) and in
Qx swab diluent. Two strains of T. vaginalis, one Metronidazole-sensitive and one
Metronidazole-resistant, were used at varying concentrations to create an LOD panel
consisting of six target levels. For each target level 20 replicates were tested across
three lots of assay and extraction reagents on three BD Viper Systems to yield a total
of 60 replicates at each target level. The resulting MaxRFU values were analyzed to
determine proportion positive at each level that was used to generate positivity curves
from which each 95% LOD was calculated.
LOD was confirmed using 20 replicates at the estimated LOD for each matrix type
with one lot of reagents and one BD Viper System for each strain of T. vaginalis.

30001 and 50143 in BD Qx Swab Diluent when extracted on the BD Viper System
was 54.5 and 55.5 trichomonads/mL, respectively. The LODs for neat urine, vaginal
and endocervical specimen matrices are presented in the Table below.

* LoD for an additional ATCC T. vaginalis strain was determined in vaginal swab specimen matrix.
Please see the Inclusivity section below for additional information.
f. Inclusivity:
Four ATCC Trichomonas vaginalis strains 30185, 30237, 50144, and 30184 were
evaluated in the inclusivity study for TV Qx assay on BD Viper System in urine and
vaginal swab specimen matrix. A total of 20 assay replicates were run for each strain
and specimen matrix. One ATCC strain 30184 could not meet the 95% positivity
criteria for vaginal matrix LoD confirmation; therefore, a full LoD testing was
performed with this strain in vaginal swab matrix. The same panel that was used in
the LoD study with six target levels was tested with 60 assay replicates for each level,
using two lots of assay reagents, three lots of extractions reagents, and three BD
Viper Systems. The resulting MaxRFU values were analyzed to determine proportion
positive at each level that was used to generate positivity curves from which each
95% LOD was calculated. The TVQ LOD for strain 30184 in vaginal matrix was
determined to be 152.8 TV/mL (95% CI: 122.9, 182.7).
g. Analytical specificity:
DNA from 54 organisms was extracted on the BD Viper System and tested with the
TV Qx Assay. All potentially cross-reactive species were tested at approximately
1x106 CFU/mL for bacteria and yeast, and for viruses/pathogens at 1x106 viral
particles/mL or genomic RNA/DNA equivalents per mL, or organisms/mL (or at the
highest concentration possible). One organism, Trichomonas tenax was identified as
a cross-reactant at concentration above 1.0x104 organisms/mL. This limitation is
included in the labeling. No other organisms cross-reacted in the TV Qx Assay when
tested on the BD Viper System.

h. Interference
The effect of endogenous and exogenous substances that may be present in urine and
vaginal swab specimens on the sensitivity and specificity of the TV Qx Assay on the
BD Viper System was evaluated in an interference study.
The table below describes the substances that were individually spiked into urine and
vaginal sample matrices. Testing included 20 replicates containing each potentially
interfering substance alone as well as 20 replicates containing each substance spiked
with T. vaginalis at 3X LoD in each matrix. ATCC strain 50143 or 30001 was used
for spiking the urine or vaginal specimen matrix respectively. The study also
included sample matrices unspiked or spiked with Trichomonas vaginalis without
interfering substances as a control. The results are summarized in the table below.

i. Assay cut-off:
The TV Qx Assay is designed for and validated on the BD Viper System in Extracted
Mode. The assay test results are automatically interpreted by the BD Viper System
software. The presence or absence of T. vaginalis DNA is determined by calculating
the peak fluorescence (MaxRFU) over the course of the amplification process and by
comparing this measurement to a predetermined threshold value. If the T. vaginalis-
specific signal is greater than or equal to a threshold of 125 MaxRFU, the EC
fluorescence is ignored by the algorithm. If the T. vaginalis-specific signal is less than
a threshold of 125 MaxRFU, the EC fluorescence is utilized by the algorithm in the
interpretation of the result.

The performance of the TV Qx Assay with the preliminary assay cutoff (125
MaxRFU) was evaluated in three phases at external clinical sites: a cutoff analysis (to
verify the preliminary assay cutoff prior to the main clinical trial), a clinical trial (to
validate the performance of the assays in different clinical settings), and a
reproducibility study. These three phases confirmed that the preliminary cutoff
values for assay was acceptable.
j. Contamination and Carryover Study
An internal study was conducted to evaluate the risk of producing a false positive
result with the TV Qx Assay protocol in either the same run on the BD Viper System
in Extracted Mode (within run cross-contamination) or in a subsequent run (between
run carryover). Testing was conducted using negative and positive samples on three
BD Viper Systems utilizing CTQ/GCQ/TVQ Panel Mode (login mode in which a
single sample tube may be tested with the CT Qx, GC Qx, and TV Qx Assays on the
BD Viper System) as the worst-case for carryover and crossover contamination
rates. CTQ/GCQ/TVQ Panel Mode utilizes the most complex series of robotic arm

movements and incorporates the longest instrument run time. This study utilized the
x
most sensitive BD ProbeTec Q Amplified DNA Assay (CTQ Assay based on
analytical LOD, K081824). Positive samples were seeded with a representative
analyte (105 CT EBs/mL). The experimental series was comprised of 6 consecutive
runs using alternating positive and negative samples arranged in a checkerboard
pattern (at a positivity rate of 50%) on each BD Viper System. The overall rate of
contamination was ≤0.49% (3/612) in TVQ mode and ≤0.39% (3/807) in
CTQ/GCQ/TVQ panel mode.
k. Fresh vs. Frozen samples:
This study was done to verify that specimens which have been frozen prior to
processing on the BD Viper System perform equivalently to those that are not frozen
prior to processing. Urine and vaginal swab specimens expressed in Qx diluent,
unspiked or spiked with T. vaginalis at 3X LoD were tested either fresh or after
storing at -20˚C for 7 days. Each fresh/frozen pair was considered as one set of
sample and if the frozen result did not match the fresh then it was a “disagreement”.
44 such sets of fresh/frozen were tested at each T. vaginalis concentration for each
specimen matrix.
Overall percent agreement between fresh and frozen specimens was calculated by
sample type for the TV Qx Assay using the MaxRFU algorithm and a cutoff
threshold of 125 MaxRFU.

3. Clinical studies:
Performance characteristics for the BD TV Qx Assay on BD Viper System were
established in multi-center clinical study using prospectively collected specimens from
consenting subjects during 2012. First void urine specimens between 20 – 60 mL, self-
collected vaginal swabs in a clinical setting, and clinician-collected endocervical swabs
were obtained from 1222 symptomatic and asymptomatic female subjects attending
family planning, OB/GYN, and sexually transmitted disease clinics at seven (7)
geographically diverse clinical sites in North America. Subjects were classified as
symptomatic if they presented to the clinic with abnormal vaginal discharge, itching,
dysuria, or odor as determined by the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The final data analysis
included 1197 evaluable subjects. Exclusions from the data analysis were made due to
specimens not collected, enrollment issues, transport errors, collection errors, shipping
errors, processing errors, or BD Viper System operating errors. The final data analysis
included 735 compliant results for the neat urine specimen type, 838 compliant results for
the vaginal swab specimen type, and 995 compliant results for the endocervical swab
specimen type.
All sensitivity and specificity calculations were based on the total number of TV Qx
Assay results for the neat urines, vaginal, and endocervical specimens as compared to the
composite reference of the wet mount and the commercially available T. vaginalis culture
test method. The subject was considered to be positive for T. vaginalis if either the wet
mount or T. vaginalis culture result was positive. Subjects were considered negative for
T. vaginalis if both of the reference methods were negative.
The following tables show the sensitivity, and specificity of the TV Qx Assay on the BD
Viper System for each specimen type by symptom status as well as sensitivity,
specificity, prevalence, PPV, and NPV of the TV Qx Assay by specimen type and
collection site. Subjects were classified as symptomatic if symptoms were reported by the
subject. Subjects were classified as asymptomatic if the subject did not report symptoms.

4 Clinical cut-off:
A multi-site clinical trial was conducted to verify the pre-established cutoff value
(threshold). The Cutoff Trial was designed to assess the performance of the TV Qx Assay
as defined by sensitivity and specificity relative to the reference methods (InPouch TV
Culture and Wet Mount) when using the preliminary cutoff value. To evaluate the
performance of the TV Qx Assay, clinical specimens were collected from female
participants at clinical centers across the United States, according to established
inclusion/exclusion criteria. For specimen testing during the Cutoff Trial with the TV Qx
Assay, three BD Viper Systems were utilized at three external clinical sites. The
MaxRFU values from the dataset were examined for distribution. Receiver operating
curve (ROC) analysis was performed for the assay to verify that the current MaxRFU
cutoff of 125 was appropriate for the TV Qx Assay on the BD Viper System. ROC
curves were created by specimen type (vaginal, neat urine, and endocervical) and overall.
The data analysis showed that the current cutoff for positive results of > 125 is
appropriate.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
A summary of the prevalence of T. vaginalis, by specimen type, as determined by the
composite reference method during the clinical study (April 2012-August 2012) is shown
in the following table.

2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Barcode or key entered accession numbers and patient sample location identification
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Automated
5. Calibration:
Self-calibrated; the BD Viper instrument has 8 channels, one for each row of a 96-well
plate. Each channel has slightly different optical characteristics. To minimize these
differences, the reader has normalizers in each channel. After the normalizer is read, the
readings are used by the Built-In-Test to verify that the detection system is in calibration.
Any readings for a given normalizer that fall out of the expected range cause the system
to report error conditions. The readers are recalibrated when a software upgrade is
performed, when new Normalizers are logged in, and when System Parameters are
cleared.
6. Quality Control:
In addition to the extraction and external controls described in Section M.1.d., the
Specimen process controls which test the entire system may also be run in accordance
with the requirements of appropriate accrediting organizations. For this purpose, known
positive specimens can serve as controls by being processed and tested in conjunction
with unknown specimens. Specimens used as processing controls must be stored,
processed, and tested according to the package insert instructions. Specimen processing
controls for T. vaginalis may also be prepared in the laboratory using commercially
available Gibson Laboratories Tri-Valent™ Swab Positive Control (Cat. # TVS-01).
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered in the
