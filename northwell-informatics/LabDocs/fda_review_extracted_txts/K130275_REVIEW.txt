a simple and rapid analytical screening procedure to simultaneously detect the
drugs of abuse MDMA at or above the cutoff level of 500 ng/ml and OPI at or
above the cutoff level of 300 ng/ml in human urine. The device is intended for
prescription use and Over-The-Counter settings.

The assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific
alternative chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result.
GC/MS or LC/MS is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical and
professional judgment should be exercised with any drug of abuse test result,
particularly when preliminary results are used. The assay does not distinguish
whether OPI or MDMA is being taken therapeutically or abused.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For Over-The-Counter (OTC) and prescription use
For in vitro diagnostic (IVD) use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable
I. Device Description:
The QuikScreenMulti (MDMA and OPI) Drug Cup Test is a device consisting
of a specimen collection cup with a built-in strip holder which is able to hold
MDMA and OPI test strips. The membrane of the drug test strip is coated with
goat anti-mouse antibody and drug-bovine serum albumin conjugate. The sample
pad of test strip contains a colloidal gold-labeled mouse monoclonal anti-drug
(OPI or MDMA) antibody.

L. Test Principle:
The assay is based on lateral flow immunochromatographic technology. Drug
(OPI or MDMA) in the urine sample competes with the colloidal gold labeled goat
anti-mouse monoclonal antibody -conjugated for binding to drug protein conjugate
in the test zone area.
If drug (OPI or MDMA) is present in the sample, the test sample flows through the
absorbent device, and the colloidal gold labeled antibody-conjugate binds to the
free drug in the specimen forming an antibody-conjugate in the test reaction zone

and will not produce a magenta color band when the drug is above the detection
level (positive result). In the absence of drug (OPI or MDMA) in the sample, the
drug-protein conjugate binds to labeled antibody and produces a magenta band in
the test zone area (negative result).
The device also has an internal process control which indicates that adequate volume
of sample has been added and that the immune-chromatographic device is intact. A
goat anti-mouse antibody is also employed in the control line system. A negative
specimen produces two distinct color bands in both the test line and control area. A
positive specimen produces only one color band in the control area.
The absence or presence of a line is determined visually by the user. The tester will
obtain a result in five minutes.

A study was conducted with QuikScreenTM Multi (MDMA and OPI) drug cup test to
determine the cross-reactivity of non-drug related compounds with the test at concentrations
much higher than normally found in the urine of people using or abusing drugs. Non-drug
related compounds (100mg/ml) were spiked into the urine containing -25 % cutoff of drug
(negative) and +25 % cutoff of drug (positive). No cross reactivity with MDMA or OPI test
device were detected with the substances spiked in the either negative or positive urine listed
in the table below:

The sponsor provided studies to show that the QuikScreenTM Multi (MDMA and OPI)
Drug Cup Test device performance at the cutoff level is not affected by any urine
samples with a pH ranging from 4.0 to 8.5 and specific gravity ranging from 1.005 to
1.030. The protocols and data were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cutoff characterization study was performed by using QuikScreen
Multi (MDMA and OPI) Drug Cup Test. The study samples were made by
using OPI or MDMA stock solution confirmed by GC/MS and diluting in drug-
free urine. Results are shown in the tables below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed using positive and negative unaltered
clinical urine specimens. Samples were collected from 80 negative drug free urine
specimens, 80 OPI positive patient’s urine specimens, and 130 MDMA positive
specimens. Each urine specimen was tested with the QuikScreen Multi (MDMA
and OPI) Drug Cup Test and the reference method (GC-MS or LC-MS). The results
are summarized as follows:

A lay user study was performed with 104 lay persons. Participants in the study
(65 females and 39 Males) tested the MDMA and Opiate samples. They had
diverse educational and professional backgrounds and ranged in age from 26 to
66. Urine samples were prepared at the following concentrations; negative, +/-

75%, +/-50%, and +/-25% of the cutoff by spiking drug(s) into drug free-pooled
urine specimens. The concentrations of the samples were confirmed by GC/MS.
Each sample was aliquotted into individual containers and blind-labeled. Each
participant was provided with the package insert, 1 blind labeled sample, and a
device. The results are summarized below.

The labeling is rated at 8.3 grade reading level per Flesch-Kincaid methodology. All
participants(100%) indicated on the questionnaire that the instructions are clear and that
they do not find the QuikScreenTM Multi (MDMA and OPI) Drug Cup Test difficult to
operate.
