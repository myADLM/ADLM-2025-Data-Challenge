cartridges to measure a variety of analytes in human body fluids. The system can process
samples in random access, batch or STAT modes. The instrument has a heterogeneous
module (HM) for processing chromium-based heterogeneous immunoassays and a LOCI
module (LM) for chemiluminescent immunoassays.
The test system remains the same except for the PMT. The PMT was modified by changing
the supplier and the format of the multiplier channel was changed from multiple dynodes to
enhanced glass single surface tube used to count the signal for the chemiluminescent
methods.

cartridges to measure a variety of analytes in human body fluids. The system can process
samples in random access, batch or STAT modes. The instrument has a heterogeneous
module (HM) for processing chromium-based heterogeneous immunoassays and a LOCI®
module for chemiluminescent immunoassays. The instrument can also perform photometric,
turbidimetric and affinity column mediated immunoassay (ACMIA) tests.
The FT4L method is a homogeneous, sequential, chemiluminescent immunoassay based on
LOCI® technology. The LOCI® reagents include two synthetic bead reagents and a
biotinylated anti-T4 mouse monoclonal antibody. The first bead reagent (Chemibeads) is
coated with triiodothyronine (T3), a naturally occurring, weaker binding analog of T4, and
contains chemiluminescent dye. The second bead reagent (Sensibeads) is coated with
streptavidin and contains a photosensitizer dye. In a first step, sample is incubated with
biotinylated antibody which allows T4 from the sample to saturate a fraction of the
biotinylated antibody that is directly related to the free thyroxine (FT4) concentration. In a
second step, T3 Chemibeads are added and form bead/biotinylated antibody
immunocomplexes with the non-saturated fraction of the biotinylated antibody. Sensibeads
are then added and bind to the biotin to form bead pair immunocomplexes. Illumination of
the complex at 680 nm generates singlet oxygen from Sensibeads which diffuses into the
Chemibeads, triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is measured at 612
nm and is an inverse function of the FT4 concentration in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision study was conducted using three (3) commercial quality controls
(BioRad Liquichek Immunoassay QC) and two (2) patient serum pools. Testing was
performed over twenty (20) days, one (1) run per day for each test material on the
Dimension EXL with LM systems with both the new and the current PMT. Analysis
of variance was used to evaluate the data as outlined in CLSI EP5-A2 Evaluation of
Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods: Approved Guideline-
Second Edition. The data is summarized below.

Patient Pool 2 3.93 0.06 1.6 0.07 1.7
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The measuring range was determined using the Level 5 Thyroid Calibrator and the
calibrator base matrix with the new PMT in accordance with CLSI Evaluation of
Linearity of Quantitative Measure Procedures (EP06-A). Intermediate levels were
prepared by proportional mixing of the high and low calibrator materials to produce
concentrations evenly distributed across the assay range. Eleven concentration levels
(ranging 0.1 to 8.32ng/dL) were assayed three times. The data was analyzed using
least squares linear regression. The quadratic terms of the second and third order
polynomial fit were statistically insignificant (p value >0.05), supporting linearity
across the measuring range of 0.1 to 8.0ng/dL. The least squares linear regression
analyses were: slope =1.04, y-intercept= -0.01, and R2=1.00.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibrator Traceability:
USP-grade thyroxine is spiked into stripped human serum at different concentrations.
This becomes the “Anchor Pool”. The “Anchor Pool” values are validated in-house.
A Master Pool is developed from stripped bovine albumin to which different
concentrations of thyroxine have been added. Values for the Master Pool are derived
by multiple analyses against the Anchor Pool calibration curve. LOCI® Thyroid
Calibrator value assignment is established by measurement against the Master Pool
calibration.
Calibrators have been previously cleared in k073604.
d. Detection limit:
To verify the limit of blank (LoB), twenty (20) replicates of the calibrator matrix
material (0 ng/dL) were processed in a single batch run in accordance with CLSI
EP17-A with the new PMT. None of the replicate measurements exceeded the LoB
claim of 0.03ng/dL. The LoB claim was verified and established as 0.03ng/dL the
reference concentration for LoD verification.
To verify the limit of detection (LoD), two samples were prepared at concentrations
approximately equal to the LoD claim (0.06 ng/dL). The samples were processed in
