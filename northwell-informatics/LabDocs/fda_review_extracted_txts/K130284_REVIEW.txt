L. Test Principle:
The On Call Sharp Blood Glucose Monitoring System is an amperometric method that uses
flavin adenine dinucleotide-glucose dehydrogenase (GDH-FAD) enzyme chemistry and a
mediator that reacts with glucose in the whole blood sample to produce an electrical current.
This current is measured by the meter, and after calculation by the meter, the blood glucose
concentration reading is displayed, calibrated to plasma reference.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within run precision was performed using five venous blood samples spiked with
glucose to achieve higher glucose concentrations and allowed to equilibrate for at
least 2 hours before use). The samples tested ranged from 39 to 328 mg/dL. Each
sample was tested 10 times on three test strip lots, using 10 meters per test strip lot for
6

n = 100 per test strip lot. The mean values, standard deviations and coefficients of
variation were calculated for each sample and are summarized below.

The intermediate precision evaluation was performed using three levels of control
solutions. A total of 300 strips each from three lots of test strips were used with a
minimum of 10 meters, 10 replicates per day, for 10 days. The glucose concentration
of each sample was determined using the YSI Glucose Analyzer. The mean values
and coefficients of variation were calculated for each sample and are summarized
below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed using eleven different levels (10, 25, 50, 80, 110,
170, 220, 330, 450, 550, and 650 mg/dL) of venous whole blood samples
supplemented with a glucose stock solution to cover the claimed measuring range
from 20 to 600 mg/dL. Four measurements were taken from each glucose level and
measured using 3 lots of test strips on a minimum of 2 meters. Linear regression
analysis resulted in the equation y = 1.0409 x - 5.2697 with an R2 = 0.9903. The
claimed measuring range is 20 to 600 mg/dL based on the linearity data.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The glucose control standards are traceable to a NIST SRM 917ba glucose standard
and are prepared at three target concentrations (Level 0 = 51 mg/dL, Level 1 = 125
mg/dL and Level 2 = 330 mg/dL). The reference instrument used is the YSI 2300
Glucose analyzer.
Stability
Accelerated stability study was conducted to assess the shelf-life stability of the
control solutions and test strips. Real-time stability studies are still on-going.
Stability studies protocols and acceptance criteria were provided and found to be
adequate.
Unopened control solutions have a 24 month shelf life and are stable for 1 month
after first use when stored at 5 - 30oC (35.6 - 86 oF).
Unopened test strips have a 24 month shelf-life and are stable for 1 month after first
use when stored at 5 - 30oC (35.6 - 86oF) at a %RH of 10-90%.
Expected values
The controls are prepared at three target concentrations gravimetrically. The solution
is then compared to the NIST standard and then the glucose concentrations are
verified with the YSI reference method. The expected values are verified for each
new lot of strips.

d. Detection limit:
See linearity study above in section 1.b.
e. Analytical specificity:
The interference study was designed according to CLSI EP7-A2 guideline. 35
common endogenous and exogenous interfering substances were evaluated by spiking
venous blood to three levels of glucose concentrations (50, 100, 350 mg/dL). The
glucose samples were then spiked with the potentially interfering compounds (2
concentration including normal or therapeutic levels and high or toxic levels). Two
meters were used for this study with 4 strips for each meter. Three lots of test strips
were tested for a total of 1152 test strips. Bias was calculated as the mean percent
difference in glucose reading between the test and control concentration groups. The
sponsor claims no significant interference if bias between the tested and the control
sample is <10% difference. A summary of the concentrations of the potential
interfering substances tested is summarized in the table below:

Based on the study data, all the substances and levels tested above have <10% bias
except for ascorbic acid > 3 mg/dL (above therapeutic levels) and xylose > 4 mg/dL.
Ascorbic acid levels > 3 mg/dL and xylose > 4 mg/dL will interfere with the glucose
reading; therefore, the sponsor has the following limitation in their labeling:
“Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) (when occurring in blood at normal or at high therapeutic
concentration) do not significantly affect results. However, abnormally high
concentration (> 3 mg/dL) in blood may cause inaccurately high results."
“Do not use during or soon after xylose absorption testing. Xylose (> 4mg/dL) in the
blood will cause interference”
Sodium Fluoride interferes with blood glucose testing in the On Call Sharp Blood
Glucose Monitoring System. The sponsor has included the following warning
“Never test blood that has been placed in test tubes containing fluoride or other
anticoagulants. This will cause falsely low results.”
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The accuracy of the ACON On Call Sharp Blood Glucose Monitoring System was
assessed by comparing whole blood glucose results to the YSI. Samples were
obtained from 103 different subjects over 29 days. 5 of the 103 subjects’ fingertip
samples were also aged to obtain glucose concentrations <50 mg/dL and 5 of the 103
subjects’ fingertip samples were also supplemented with additional glucose to obtain
glucose concentrations >400 mg/dL. A total of 3 test strip lots and 36 meters were
used. The glucose concentration range of the samples tested was 34 to 592 mg/dL.
The data is summarized below:

One hundred and three (103) lay users participated in the study. Three (3) strip lots
were tested on 36 meters. Instructions for use were given to each study subject to let
the subject learn and understand how to run testing for the studied system. After
reading the instructions, each study subject performed fingerstick testing on the
studied system by themselves. A trained technician also ran the same testing with the
same subject’s fingerstick blood. The same procedure for fingerstick testing was then
repeated for palm and forearm alternative sites. Both layperson and technician

The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study: The effect of different hematocrit levels on the performance of the
ACON On Call Sharp BGMS was evaluated using venous whole blood samples with
hematocrit levels of 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 65 and 70% and spiked with glucose to achieve 5
concentrations ranging from 50 to 525 mg/dL (50, 100, 275 and 525 mg/dL). Each sample
was then tested 4 times on three different test strip lots and the values were compared with
those obtained from YSI reference analyzer. The % biases relative to YSI were acceptable
within the claimed hematocrit range of 25 to 70%.
2. Altitude study: Fingerstick capillary blood samples from fifteen subjects were tested on 6
test strips (3 strip lots) on 6 On Call Sharp meters. The sample range tested was 33 to 491
mg/dl for sea level and at 8, 516 ft. Blood glucose target concentrations were then verified
by the reference YSI glucose analyzer. The results demonstrate acceptable bias to YSI to
support the claims in the labeling that altitudes up to 8, 516 feet have no significant effect on
blood glucose measurements from the On Call Sharp Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
3. Sample volume study: The sponsor performed a study to verify the minimum test strip
sample volume requirement and the test strip fill error requirement established for the On
Call Sharp Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Blood samples were tested at six sample
volumes (0.4, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 and 1.0μL) and values obtained were compared to YSI values.
Results support the claimed minimum sample volume of 0.8 µL and the error code for
insufficient sample volume.
4. Temperature and humidity studies: The sponsor performed temperature and humidity
studies using venous blood samples in vacutainer tubes with heparin anticoagulant to
evaluate temperatures of 10, 21 and 45ºC and relative humidity of 10% to 90%. Meter results
were compared to YSI reference analyzer. Six temperature and humidity combinations were
tested including low temperature/low humidity, low temperature/high humidity, average
temperature/low humidity, average temperature/high humidity, high temperature/low
humidity and high temperature/high humidity. No significant effect (relative to YSI reference
analyzer) was observed with the temperature and humidity combinations tested. The results
support the claims in the labeling that the system can be used in conditions of 10 to 45°C
with relative humidity of 10 to 90%.
5. Infection Control Studies: The On Call Sharp Blood Glucose Monitoring System is
intended for single-patient use. DisCide Ultra Disinfecting Towelettes with EPA registration
number 10492-4 were validated demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus for use
with the meter. The sponsor also demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in
the external materials of the meter after 3,285 cleaning and disinfection cycles (one cycle
includes one cleaning wipe plus one disinfecting wipe) to simulate 5 years of meter use.
Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection
procedures.
