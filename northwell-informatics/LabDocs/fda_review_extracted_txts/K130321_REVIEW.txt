L. Test Principle:
The method for quantitative determination of the LIAISON® Aldosterone assay is a
direct, competitive, chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA). Specific antibody to
aldosterone is bound to magnetic particles (solid phase) and aldosterone is linked to
an isoluminol derivative. During the first incubation, sample is incubated with a
specific anti-Aldosterone monoclonal antibody. Following the 1st incubation, the
conjugate is added and competes with Aldosterone for an additional amount of time.
After the 2nd incubation, the unbound material is removed with a wash cycle. The
starter reagents are then added and a flash chemiluminescent reaction is initiated. The
light signal is measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) and is
inversely proportional to the concentration of Aldosterone present in the calibrators,
controls or patient samples.
Preparation of urine samples:
The 24-hour urine samples shall be refrigerated during collection. After measuring and
recording the urine volume, add 1 g of boric acid to every 100 mL of urine sample.
The borate stabilized urine sample will then be acid hydrolyzed by mixing one part
urine with two parts of 0.2M HCl and incubated at 30ºC for 18 hours after thorough
mixing. After acid hydrolysis, the urine samples must be neutralized by mixing one
part urine with four parts of LIAISON® Aldo Neutralization Buffer. These pre-
measurement treatments will cause 15x dilutions to urine samples.
Results of 24 hrs urine samples:
The instrument will measure and report the pretreated (acid hydrolyzed and
neutralized) urine aldosterone results. The user must apply the 15x concentration
correction factor to obtain the aldosterone concentrations of the urine samples. In
addition, the users need to record the total volume of the 24-hour urine samples in
order to report the total mass of aldosterone in µg/24 hours.
To calculate urine aldosterone in µg/24 hours, user shall use the following formula:
Corrected aldosterone concentration (result from analyzer in ng/dL x 15) x 24 hours
urine volume (in mL) x 10-5

for each linearity sample set were tested in triplicate on the LIAISON®
analyzer. Samples tested ranged from 2.2 to 109 ng/dL. The observed values
were plotted against the expected values and linear regression was performed.
All three sample sets tested with each sample type yielded similar linear
regressions. A representative of each sample type is summarized below.
Serum: y = 0.994x + 0.714, R = 1.000,
EDTA Plasma: y = 1.006x + 1.425, R = 0.998,
Urine: y = 0.9963x + 0.694, R = 0.999.
The data support the claimed measuring range of this device, 3.0 to 100
ng/dL for serum, EDTA plasma and urine samples.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The LIAISON® Aldosterone Calibrators are traceable to
aldosterone reference material through gravimetrical preparation and
UV spectrophotometric analysis.
Stability: Shelf life stability studies were performed with assay reagents,
calibrators, controls and calibration verifiers, and demonstrated that they are
stable until the expiration date shown on the product labeling when stored as
instructed. Calibrators, controls and calibration verifiers are stable until the
expiration date printed on the label when stored as directed. Once opened,
calibrators are stable for 6 weeks when properly stored at 2-8°C between uses.
Once opened, controls and calibration verifiers are stable for 4 weeks when
properly stored at 2-8°C between uses. Calibration curve stability and reagent
open vial stability were performed by the sponsor and demonstrated that the
calibration curve is stable for 2 weeks and open reagent vials are stable for 6
weeks when stored on board or at 2-8°C. The protocols for stability and
acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be adequate.
Value assignment: concentrations of kit calibrators, controls and calibration
verifiers are assigned through an internal procedure. Master calibrators are
prepared from a stock solution made from reference material whose
concentration is determined spectrophotometrically by the sponsor. The
master calibrators are then used to assign values to the kit calibrators, controls
and calibration verifiers using a minimum of 3 LIASON analyzers with at
least 2 reagent lots. Each lot of calibrators, controls and calibration verifiers
were tested over several runs and the mean results are used to determine the
target values. The protocols for value assignment and acceptance criteria were
reviewed and found to be adequate.
Aldosterone Calibrators have the following target values:
Level 1= 2.5 - 3.5 ng/dL
Level 2= 50 - 60 ng/dL
7

--- Page 8 ---
Aldosterone Controls have the following target ranges:
Level 1= 5.5 - 8.5 ng/dL
Level 2= 25.0 - 35.0 ng/dL
Aldosterone Calibration Verifiers have the following target ranges:
Level 1= 3.4 - 4.6 ng/dL
Level 2= 12.8 - 17.2 ng/dL
Level 2= 38.3 - 51.7 ng/dL
Level 2= 68.0 - 92.0 ng/dL
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of
Quantitation (LoQ) were determined for serum and urine samples in
accordance with CLSI document EP17-A2. LoB was calculated using 5 blank
serum or urine samples tested on 2 LIAISON® analyzers over three days using
6 runs with two reagent lots. LoD was calculated using 4 low concentration
serum or urine samples in the range of LoB to 4xLoB values, tested on 2
LIAISON® analyzers over 3 days using 6 runs and 2 reagent lots. LoQ was
calculated using 6 serum samples and 8 urine samples tested on 2 LIAISON®
analyzers over 3 days using 6 runs and 2 reagent lots. LoQ was defined as the
lowest concentration for which the inter-assay precision %CV is less than
20%.
The LoB, LoD and LoQ results in ng/mL are summarized below:
Sample type LoB LoD LoQ
Serum 0.97 1.45 3.0
Urine 1.26 2.00 2.8
The claimed measuring range of the device is 3.0 to 100 ng/dL for serum,
EDTA plasma and urine samples.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference:
Following CLSI guidance document EP7-A2, interference studies were
performed to both serum and pretreated urine samples that contain two
different concentrations of aldosterone (12 ng/dL and 30ng/dL for serum
samples; 5 ng/dL and 15 ng/dL for pretreated urine samples). Both serum and
pretreated urine samples were spiked with a single concentration of 8 different
endogenous substances (see below chart) and compared to unspiked control
samples. The two sets of matched spiked and control samples containing each
interferent were tested on the LIAISON® Aldosterone assay using 12 replicates
with 1 reagent lot. The sponsor defines non-significant interference as bias
within 10% between the spiked and the control samples. Results of non-
significant interference are summarized in the table below:

aldosterone (12 ng/dL and 30ng/dL for serum samples; 5 ng/dL and 15 ng/dL
for pretreated urine samples). Both serum and urine samples were spiked with
potential interferents and tested with the LIAISON® Aldosterone assay. The
reference sample (control) without interferent was spiked with the respective
amount of solvent. Based on the sponsor’s definition of non-significant
interference (within ± 10% of control value), the sponsor claims no
interference for the compounds with concentrations listed in the table below:

2. Comparisonstudies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Following the CLSI EP9-A2 guidance document, the sponsor performed a
method comparison study of the LIAISON® Aldosterone assay versus the
predicate device. A total of 144 serum samples (22 of them were aldosterone
spiked samples) were compared across methods, following the
manufacturers’ instructions (samples ranged from 3.02 ng/dL to 97.1 ng/dL
on the LIAISON® Aldosterone assay). Singlicate results from the candidate
device and mean of duplicate results from the predicate device were used for
the linear regression analysis. Passing- Bablok linear regression analysis
resulted the following:
y = 0.98x + 1.10; R= 0.988
95% CI for the slope is 0.94 to 1.02 and for the intercept is 0.43 to 1.49 ng/dL.
Additionally, a total of 104 native urine samples were compared across
methods, following the manufacturers’ instructions. Samples ranged tested
from 7.9 ng/dL to 82.8 ng/dL on the LIAISON® Aldosterone assay for the
pretreated urine samples, which corresponds to 118.9 ng/dL to 1242 ng/dL
for the urine samples after x 15 dilution factor). The predicate device has a
dilution factor of x 10 for the pretreated urine samples
Measuring range of the urine samples after multiplying by the dilution factor
of 15 was 45 to 1500 ng/dL (3-100 ng/dL x 15).
Singlicate results from the candidate device and mean of duplicate results
from the predicate device were used for the linear regression analysis.
Passing- Bablok linear regression analysis resulted the following:
y = 0.98x + 34.0; R= 0.948
95% CI for the slope is 0.91 to 1.05 and for the intercept is 11.4 to 56.7 ng/dL.
b. Matrix comparison:
The sponsor performed a matrix comparison using 59 matched patient sets of
serum and EDTA plasma samples (7 of them were spiked with additional
aldosterone). Samples ranging from 3.59 to 97.3 ng/dL were analyzed in
singlicate using one lot of LIAISON® Aldosterone reagent.

Passing-Bablok linear regression analysis resulted the following:
EDTA Plasma (Y) to Serum (X): y=0.964x + 0.033, R=0.997
The sponsor concluded that serum and EDTA plasma samples provided
equivalent results on LIAISON® Aldosterone assay.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Matched serum and EDTA plasma samples drawn from 126 apparently healthy
adults were tested to determine the reference range for the LIAISON®
Aldosterone assay for serum and plasma samples. Samples were collected from
a fasting population with normal blood pressure and normal glucose levels.
Exclusion criteria included needs for prescription medications or restricted
diets, pregnancy, breast feeding or taking oral contraceptives.
Upright samples were collected after the individuals have stood for at least 30
minutes. Supine samples were collected after the individuals have laid in supine
position for at least 30 minutes. The observed median and central 95% reference
intervals for upright and supine positions are listed below.
Median Aldosterone Observed Range (ng/dL)
Population (126)
(ng/dL) 2.5th to 97.5th Percentile
Upright (Serum) 9.80 <3.0 – 39.2
Supine (Serum) 6.76 <3.0 – 23.2
Upright (EDTA plasma) 8.91 <3.0 – 35.3
Supine (EDTA plasma) 6.42 <3.0 – 23.6
