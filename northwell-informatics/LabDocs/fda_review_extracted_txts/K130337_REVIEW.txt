H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Randox Immunoassay Speciality Control (I) Levels 1, 2 and 3 are intended for in
vitro diagnostic use as assayed quality control material to monitor the precision of
laboratory testing procedures for 1-25 Dihydroxy Vitamin D (1-25 (OH)2 Vitamin D), 25
Hydroxy Vitamin D (25-OH Vitamin D), anti-Thyroglobulin (anti-TG), anti-Thyroid
Peroxidase (anti-TPO), C-Peptide, Insulin Like Growth Factor (IGF-1), Parathyroid

2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as intended use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For in vitro diagnostic use
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Values are listed in the labeling for several analyzers. Values were assigned on these
analyzers. Representative analyzer specific values are shown in below.
I. Device Description:
Randox Immunoassay Speciality Control (I) is manufactured at three levels, Level 1, Level 2
and Level 3, for each analyte. Individual analyte values listed in the package insert are
specific for the instrument system utilized.
Each control is prepared from human serum with added constituents of human origin,
chemicals, stabilizers and preservatives. They are supplied in lyophilized form in 5x2ml vials
and require reconstitution with 2ml of distilled water.
The individual analyte concentrations in each of the three levels have been chosen to span a
range that includes the chemically significant or medical decision levels.
Human source material from which this product has been derived has been tested at the
donor level for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1 & HIV-2) antibody, Hepatitis B
surface antigen (HbsAg) and the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody and were found to be
non-reactive based on FDA approved methods.

(NA refers to Not Applicable)
Stability Studies:
Shelf-life and open-vial stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and
found to be acceptable.
Shelf-life stability studies: Accelerated stability was used to predict the shelf life of
control materials. The Immunoassay Speciality Controls (I) were stored at +37°C for
a period of two weeks. The shelf life of these products was set at 2 years from the
date of manufacture, based on the performance of the accelerated stability testing.
The real time stability of the controls was monitored to verify and validate the
predicted or desirable shelf life. Current Real Time studies support a 2 year shelf life.
Open-vial stability studies: The Immunoassay Speciality (I) Controls were
reconstituted as instructed on the product insert sheet and stored at +2 to +8°C until
testing at different time points. The studies support a reconstituted stability claim of
5 days at +2°C to +8°C for Insulin, Anti-TPO and 1,25 (OH) Vitamin D, 3 days at
+2°C to +8°C for Anti-TG, and 1 day at +2°C to +8°C for C-Peptide, IGF-1, and
Procalcitonin. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) should be tested within 4 hours of
reconstitution when stored at +2°C to +8°C.
Frozen stability studies were designed to establish the stability of each analyte in
frozen serum. Samples were reconstituted and stored at –18 to -24°C for 28 days.
The current studies support a frozen stability claim of 4 weeks when stored frozen at -
20°C. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) should be tested within 2 weeks when stored
below -20°C.
