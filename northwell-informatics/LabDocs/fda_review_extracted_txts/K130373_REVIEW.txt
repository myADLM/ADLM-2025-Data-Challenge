DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
k130373
B. Purpose for Submission:
New Submission
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Beckman Coulter, Inc.
Navios Flow Cytometer
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Flow Cytometric Immuno-assay: Cell identification with quantitative cell counts
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Navios Flow Cytometer uses flow cytometric principles to determine qualitative and
quantitative measurements of biological and physical properties of cells and other particles.
These properties are measured when the cells pass through the laser beam(s) in single file.
The Navios Flow Cytometry System also offers an optional standalone offline software
package, Navios software, which enables the user to reanalyze, display, print and export
acquired listmode data.
The Navios tetra Software is an optional locked algorithm application plug-in that is
designed for the Navios Flow Cytometer. It provides automated analysis and results for
tetraCHROME reagents; this application cannot be modified by the user.
Flow-Set Pro Fluorospheres is a suspension of fluorospheres with uniform and stable size
and fluorescence intensity. The stability of these product parameters allows for the
standardization of light scatter and fluorescence intensity instrument settings. For automated,
algorithm-based Beckman Coulter flow cytometry IVD systems such as Navios tetra
Software, target value ranges for X-Mode (fluorescent intensity) are provided by Beckman
Coulter with each Flow-Set Pro Fluorospheres lot on the Table of Application Target
Settings.
The Navios Flow Cytometer system consists of:
• Navios Flow Cytometer
• Navios tetra Software
• Navios Software (off-line analysis tool)
• Flow-Set Pro Fluorospheres
• CYTO-STAT tetraCHROME reagents
• COULTER IMMUNOPREP Reagent System

• TQ-Prep Workstation (Accessory for Sample Preparation)
• PrepPlus™ 2 Workstation (Accessory for Sample Preparation)
2. Principles of Operation:
The Navios flow cytometer aligns cells in suspension by hydrodynamic focusing and
passes them through a laser beam one cell at a time. The scattered and fluoresced light
that emanates from these cells as they intersect the laser beam is collected by
photomultipler tubes and transduced to an electronic pulse and counted by the
cytometer’s computer. This test depends on the ability of a monoclonal antibody to bind
to the surface of cells expressing discrete antigenic determinants. Specific cell staining is
accomplished by incubating whole blood with the monoclonal antibody reagent. The
CYTO-STAT tetraCHROME CD45-FITC/CD4-RD1/CD8- ECD/CD3-PC5 and CYTO-
STAT tetraCHROME CD45-FITC/CD56-RD1/CD19-ECD/CD3-PC5. Monoclonal
Antibody Reagents are each a combination of four murine monoclonal antibodies, each
conjugated to a specific fluorochrome and specific for a different cell surface antigen.
Red blood cells are lysed with the COULTER ImmunoPrep Reagent System. The
remaining white blood cells are analyzed on a Navios flow cytometry system with the
Navios tetra Software package. Navios Flow Cytometer Software and Navios tetra
Software, in conjunction with quality control reagents, provide automated standardization
of light scatter and fluorescence intensities and automated adjustment of color
compensation settings. The Navios tetra Software, in conjunction with the Navios Flow
Cytometer Software, and CYTO-STAT tetraCHROME CD45-FITC/CD4-RD1/CD8-
ECD/CD3-PC5 and CYTO-STAT tetraCHROME CD45-FITC/CD56-RD1/CD19-
ECD/CD3-PC5 Monoclonal Antibody Reagents, provides automated analysis of
lymphocyte subpopulations.
3. Modes of Operation:
Batch or single tube
4. Specimen Identification:
Barcode reader or manual entry
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The automated sample loader for the instrument uses a carousel that holds thirty-two 12 x
75-mm test tubes and includes a barcode reader.
6. Calibration:
Fluorescence intensity is calibrated by adjusting photomultiplier voltage using Flow-Set
Pro Fluorospheres.
The absolute count of a population is based on the calibration factor (CAL Factor) and
the number of Flow-Count fluorospheres particles within a user defined CAL region.
7. Quality Control:
IMMUNO-TROL Cells and IMMUNO-TROL Low Cells are assayed, lysable, whole-
blood quality control products used to verify the activity of the CYTO-STAT
tetraCHROME reagents and to verify the methods used for staining targeted cells, lysing

Precision and reproducibility of Flow-Set Pro fluorospheres
Three lots of Flow-Set Pro fluorospheres were tested on a Navios Flow Cytometer
over twenty days according to methods defined in CLSI EP5 to assess repeatability
and reproducibility. All parameters demonstrated CV’s < 15% and as such met the
manufacturer’s acceptance criteria. Flow-Set Pro fluorospheres were also tested on an
Epics FC500 Flow Cytometer and found to meet the manufacturer’s acceptance
criteria.
c. Linearity:
i. Instrument linearity was assessed with two Immunobrite beads of different
fluorescent intensities analyzed at 5 different voltages covering the dynamic range
of each PMT. The mean channel fluorescent intensity ratios of pairs was
calculated at five different voltages levels across three decades on all PMTs.
Lower and Upper Limits are calculated from the mean value +5%. The results of
this study demonstrate that the intensity differences between the beads were
constant across the range of voltages assessed.
ii. Linearity of the tetraCHROME reagents on the Navios Flow Cytometer with
Navios tetra software and the manual gating method was established in
accordance with CLSI EP06-A, Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative
Measurement Procedures: A Statistical Approach. Using the following linearity
acceptance limits:
• R2 ≥ 0.95;
• 0-300 cells/μL: ± 30 cells/μL bias
• >300 cells/μL: ± 10% bias
The analytical system was found to be linear for each parameter as indicated in
the following table:

The results demonstrated that PrepPlus 2 performs comparably to manual pipette for
sample preparation when used with the Navios flow cytometer and tetraCHROME
reagents and Flow Count for absolute count.
f. Single versus Dual Platform Method Comparison:
Forty one specimens (abnormal and normal) were selected for study. Absolute counts
were determined using both Flow-Count beads (single platform) and compared to the
absolute counts as calculated as the product of the subset percentage and the
lymphocyte count from the LH 780 Hematology Analyzer (K061616) (dual platform).
The methods were considered equivalent if the absolute value of the upper or lower 95 %
confidence limit of the bias is statistically smaller than the allowable difference between
the two methods (±10%). The two methods met the acceptance criteria for all reported
parameters.
K. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
L. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
