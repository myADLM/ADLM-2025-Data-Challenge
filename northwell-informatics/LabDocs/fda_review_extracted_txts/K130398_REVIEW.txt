4. Panel:
Microbiology (83)
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Sofia RSV FIA employs immunofluorescence for detection of respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV) nucleoprotein antigen in nasopharyngeal swab and
nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash specimens taken directly from symptomatic
patients. This qualitative test is intended for use as an aid in the rapid diagnosis of
acute RSV infections in pediatric patients less than 19 years of age. Negative
results do not preclude RSV infection and should not be used as the sole basis for
treatment or for other management decisions. A negative result is presumptive,
and it is recommended these results be confirmed by virus culture or an FDA-
cleared RSV molecular assay.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The device is for prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
The test cassette must be read on the Sofia Analyzer manufactured by the Quidel
Corporation.
I. Device Description:
The Sofia® RSV FIA test is an antigen detection based lateral flow assay. The
clinical specimen is collected and placed in the reagent tube for viral particle
disruption which will expose the nucleoprotein. The sample is then placed in the
cassette sample well and flows through the device via capillary action through the
nitrocellulose strip, coming into contact with the fluorescently labeled monoclonal
antibodies. Capture antibodies on the nitrocellulose strip will bind the fluorescent
labeled antibody-antigen complex and immobilize the complex on the nitrocellulose.
The Sofia Analyzer will then read the cassette and determine if there is a fluorescent
signal in the RSV A or RSV B location on the nitrocellulose strip.
The relative fluorescent units (RFU) are measured at the test line for RSV A and RSV
B, the negative control line (NC line), and the reference line. The background
fluorescence is measured at the negative control line (signal cutoff) and the antigen
2

--- Page 3 ---
specific fluorescence is measured at the test line for RSV A and RSV B (signal).
Each lot has a negative control line specific threshold. A test signal RFU greater than
the lot specific threshold (when NC line is lower than the threshold) or the corrected
signal cutoff (when the NC line is higher than the lot specific threshold) is considered
to be a positive result. A result of “Positive for RSV”, “negative” or “invalid” is then
displayed on the Sofia Analyzer for the test operator to record.
Note: Depending upon the user’s choice, the cassette is either placed inside of the
Sofia Analyzer for automatically timed development (Walk Away Mode) or placed
on the counter or bench top for a manually timed development and then placed into
the Sofia Analyzer to be scanned (Read Now Mode).

L. Test Principle:
Viral particles in the clinical sample are exposed through chemical disruption of the
virion. The sample is then placed in the cassette sample well and flows through the
device via capillary action through the nitrocellulose strip, coming into contact with
the fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibodies. Capture antibodies on the
nitrocellulose strip will bind the fluorescent labeled antibody-antigen complex and
immobilize the complex on the nitrocellulose. If RSV nucleoprotein is present a
fluorescent line will form where the fluorescently tagged nucleoprotein has bound the
capture antibodies on the nitrocellulose strip. The Sofia Analyzer will then read the
cassette and determine if there is a fluorescent signal in the RSV A or RSV B location
on the nitrocellulose strip. This will be compared to a background fluorescence
reading based on the negative control line and result will be reported on the Sofia
Analyzer display screen.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Test samples were prepared using negative nasal swab matrix spiked
with RSV A (Long VR-26) in order to prepare the following panel
members: (1) high negative C5, (2) low positive C95, and (3)
moderate positive 3x LoD. The low negative specimen consisted of
the negative matrix containing no spiked virus.
All samples were coded and used to prepare randomized panels.
Blinding was achieved by giving each user a panel that was
randomized differently. The samples were frozen at -20°C and
shipped on dry ice.
Study sites were instructed to follow the Sofia RSV FIA draft
package insert and to adhere faithfully to the reproducibility study
protocol. Each of the two operators at each site tested 60 coded
samples in 5 panels of 12 samples each over 5 different days in a
two-week period. Studies were done in the Read Now mode. The
operators were instructed to test the Positive and Negative Control
swabs prior to testing the panel members at the beginning of each
day’s run.

c. Sample stability:
Sample stability was evaluated using collected nasopharyngeal swab samples
from asymptomatic donors in Saline, PBS and 8 different viral transport media
(M4, M4-RT, M6, HBSS, UTM, Multitrans, Stuart’s, Copan E-Swab (Amies)).
All tested media showed no false positive results when evaluated at 2°C, 8°C, and
25°C from zero to 72 hours.
Positive samples were generated by spiking negative nasopharyngeal swab
samples in media with 1-1.5 x LoD of RSV type A Long train (VR-26). All
samples tested positive at 4, 8, 24, 48, and 72 hours stored at either 2-8°C or
25°C. At time zero 1/20 M4 samples and 1/40 M4-RT samples gave a false
negative result. This false negative result was deemed to have been due to testing
at virus concentrations close to the LoD. The sample stability study is acceptable
in all tested media at both 2-8°C and 25°C for 72 hours. The package insert
recommends storage in the indicated solutions and viral transport media for up to
24 hours.
d. Kit stability:
Kit stability studies were performed at room temperature. Current real time
studies show stability up to 6 months and real-time studies are on-going to
continue for 24 months.
Reagent stability studies were conducted to determine the stability of
reconstituted extraction reagent supplied with the Sofia RSV FIA test. The
rehydrated extraction reagent was stable when stored at room temperature up to
12 hours.
e. Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Negative and positive control swabs are included in the Sofia RSV FIA kit. Three
lots of positive and negative control swabs were tested on two different lots of test
cassettes. Ten replicates of each swab lot were tested on two lots of test cassettes.
Testing was performed as described in the package insert. The correct results
were obtained for all replicates in all lots. Therefore, the positive and negative
control swabs are acceptable.
f. Limit of detection:
The LoD is the lowest concentration of the analyte that yields a positive signal in
the assay 95% of the time. The LoD concentration of analyte is also referred to
as the C95. The general approach undertaken in this study was to first determine
the test line signal response in relative fluorescence units (RFUs) associated with
this C95 concentration according to the methods detailed in the CLSI document
EP17-A, entitled “Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits
of Quantitation”. Once this signal value was determined, dose-response
curves were generated using two RSV type A and two RSV type B virus
strains. The C95 concentration for each strain was interpolated from its
respective dose- response curve. Finally, the LoD was verified for each strain by
7

--- Page 8 ---
testing 80 replicates at the calculated LoD and verifying that the 95% confidence
interval of the proportion of positive results bracketed 95% positive results, as
recommended in the CLSI document. The final LoD is listed in the table below.

h. Analytical specificity:
Two studies were conducted to determine if organisms commonly found in
respiratory samples would cross-react in the assay and result in false positive or
false negative results. The first study tested common respiratory flora alone and
the second study tested the same organisms in the presence of RSV A and RSV B,
separately.
Direct Testing of the Potential Cross-Reactants: The organisms listed below were
suspended in saline at the concentrations indicated; 330 μL was added to the
extraction reagent. This rehydrated the extraction reagent. Then 250 μL of UTM
containing no virus was added to the extraction tube and gently mixed. The
extracted sample was incubated for one minute and then 120 μL of the extracted
sample, containing the potential cross-reactant, was transferred to the test
cassette. The assay proceeded as described in the draft package insert for testing
liquid specimens in the Read Now mode. Five replicates of each organism were
tested.
None of the Bacteria, Yeast, or Viruses evaluated in this study
showed cross- reactivity in the Sofia RSV FIA.
Testing the RSV-Spiked Sample in Presence of the Potential Cross-Reactant
(Interference Testing): The potential cross-reactants were suspended in saline at

the concentrations indicated; 330 μL was added to the extraction reagent.
Then 250 μL of UTM containing RSV A or B at a concentration near the LoD
was added to the extraction tube and gently mixed. The extracted sample was
incubated for one minute and then 120 μL of the extracted sample, containing the
potential cross-reactant and RSV, was transferred to the test cassette. The assay
proceeded as described in the package insert for testing liquid specimens in the
Read Now mode. Five replicates of each organism were tested.
No interference was observed at concentrations of 2.32E+06 CFU/mL or higher
with the yeast and bacteria listed below with the exception of Mycoplasma
pneumonia. Interference was observed at concentrations higher than 1.0E+05
CFU/mL. A limitation stating that interference in the presence of Mycoplasma
pneumonia at concentrations higher than 1.0E+05 CFU/mL, may occur has been
added to the package insert.
No interference was observed at concentrations of greater than or equal to
2.32E+05 TCID50/mL with the viruses listed below with the exception of the
following viruses: Adenovirus 4 and VZV showed no interference at the highest
attainable test concentration (due to low stock concentration) of 2.64E+04 and
3.55E+04 respectively. In addition one (1) false negative was obtained when
testing Adenovirus 5 (RSV A Long Strain). Fifteen (15) additional replicates
were tested, all of which were in 100% agreement with the expected results,
confirming the false negative as atypical.

i. Interfering Substances:
All interfering substances evaluated in this study were initially screened at or
above their suggested concentrations and were then further diluted until no
interference (100% agreement with the control) was achieved. Testing was
conducted over several days using samples with UTM alone, with RSV A or with
RSV B.
Studies in UTM (alone): Four rounds of testing were performed with potential
interfering substances in UTM alone (RSV negative). All of the listed potential
interfering substances were evaluated and none of the interferents caused false
positive results.

potential interferents at the highest concentrations, in the presence of RSV
A or RSV B, resulted in interference for several substances. For this reason,
repeat testing was performed of the substances alone in UTM (as well as with
the viruses) at lower concentrations until the concentration was found at which
there were no false positives obtained with UTM alone or in the presence of RSV
A and RSV B. The RSV A and RSV B were tested at virus titers near the assay’s

those obtained with RSV A. The highest overall concentration that yielded
passing results (i.e. no false positive results in the presence of RSV A and RSV
B) is reported in the table below. No limitations were included in the labeling as
the concentrations listed below are well above the relevant clinical concentrations
of these substances likely to be present in the nasal mucosa.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
This clinical study used two specimen types: nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and
nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash (NPA/W). The study was conducted over two
seasonal outbreaks of RSV, including February through April of 2012 and
October through December of 2012. Two NPS specimens were collected from
each patient, one was tested directly with the Sofia RSV FIA and the other was
placed in VTM for transport to one of the two reference laboratories for re-
testing in the Sofia RSV FIA and for culture. Usually only one sample was
collected from patients providing an aspirate or wash. An aliquot was tested
directly in the Sofia RSV FIA and the remaining specimen was suspended in an
approximately equal volume of VTM and transported to the reference
laboratory for testing. External Controls on each Analyzer were run each day
before clinical testing was started.
Viral culture was performed at either of two reference laboratories following the
procedures consistent with the guideline, CLSI M41-A. Male and female patients
of less than nineteen (<19) years of age, presenting with upper and/or lower
respiratory tract infection suggestive of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) illness,
were eligible for participation in this study. The subjects were excluded if they
were nineteen years of age or older were; the parent or legal guardian was unable
to understand and consent to participation and/or they were treated during this
®
infection with anti-RSV Synagis .
A total of 1817 subjects were enrolled in this study. Subsequently, results from
sixty-two patients were excluded, leaving 1755 patient results for the performance
analyses. The demographics of the subjects enrolled in the study and included in
the analyses are shown in the table below.
