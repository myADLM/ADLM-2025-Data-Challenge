c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The materials are traceable to the following standard materials:

(Product No. 3061)
Stability
Shelf life study was conducted on one lot of High Metabolite QUALICHECK at
temperatures: 32°C for 12 days followed by 8°C for a total of 25 months. Six
replicates at each test point (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 25 months) were tested by
measurements on an ABL725. To prevent carryover, an additional rinse was
performed between each measurement. Real-time stability study protocols and
acceptance criteria have been reviewed and found to be adequate. The data indicated
that the control solutions are stable for 2 years at 2-8°C. There is no open-vial (in-
use) stability claim since the control can be used only once. The contents should be
used immediately after opening.

6 different analyzers. To determine the assigned values and control ranges for the
High Metabolite QUALICHECK, six (6) trays of 1000 ampoules are sampled
randomly from the High Metabolite QUALICHECK batch. Twelve ampoules are
sampled from each of the trays and 72 ampoules are sampled from each batch. The
samples were conditioned and shaken at 25°C in a water bath for 6 hours.
Measurements are performed on a minimum of 3 validated ABL7xx devices with data
collection. Measurement of each parameter is performed alternately on the reference
ampoule and the sample ampoule and repeated 12 times on each ABL-7xx for a total
of 144 measurements. Target ranges are calculated based on the mean ±2SD.
