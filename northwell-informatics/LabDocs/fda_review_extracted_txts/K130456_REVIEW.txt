K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
Not applicable
L. Test Principle:
The Wunder Pregnancy test is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay which utilizes a
combination of antibodies (described in the Device Description Section above) to selectively
detect elevated levels of hCG. The assay is conducted by adding the urine specimen to the
cassette test strip. The specimen migrates via capillary action along the membrane to react
with the colored conjugate. A negative specimen produces no line in the test zone (T), and
one colored line in the control zone (C). A positive specimen produces distinct colored lines
in both the test zone (T) and the control zone (C). An invalid specimen produces either no
lines or one line in the test zone (T) and no line in the control zone (C).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed a precision study using negative urine samples spiked to
0, 5, 12.5, 20, 25, 37.5, 50 and 100 mIU/mL of hCG with commercially
available recombinant hCG traceable to the WHO 3rd international standard.
The samples were tested at three point-of-care (POC) sites using 420 devices
from 3 different lots. Samples were masked and randomized. Testing at each
POC site took place over 5 days. Testing was performed by 3 healthcare
professionals at each POC site. Results were similar across the 3 sites. Results
are tabulated below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity is not applicable since this is a qualitative test.
A high dose hook effect study was performed by spiking high levels of hCG into
negative urine samples. Concentrations ranged from 125,000-2,500,000 mIU/m and
evaluating the test result lines. Results were correct at hCG concentrations up to
1,000,000 mIU/ml. Higher values produced a false negative result. This is noted in
the labeling.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The Wunder Pregnancy Test is calibrated against reference materials traceable to the
WHO 3rd International Standard.
Stability
The stability testing protocol and acceptance criteria used to support the shelf life
were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor claims a 24-month shelf
life for the test when stored at room temperature 64 -82ºF (18-28ºC).
d. Detection limit:
Refer to the precision data in 1.a, above for performance near the detection limit.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed by adding known amounts of potentially
interfering substances to hCG-negative urine samples, as well as hCG positive
samples with concentrations near the cutoff of 25mIU/mL. The following substances
at the stated concentrations did not interfere with the assay.
Interfering substance Concentration
Acetaminophen 20 mg/dL
Acetylsalicylic Acid 20 mg/dL
Albumin 100 mg/dL
Ampicillin 20 mg/dL

To evaluate cross-reactivity, hormones including lutenizing hormone (LH), follicle
stimulating hormone (FSH) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were spiked
into negative and positive hCG urine samples. The results of these studies showed
that there is no interference at concentrations up to 500 mIU/mL LH, 1000 mIU/mL
FSH and 1000 mIU/mL TSH.
A study was performed to evaluate the effects of pH on the device. The device was
challenged with negative, and positive near cutoff hCG samples at pH values of 3.0,
4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, and 9.0. No effect of pH was observed on results of the test.
A study was performed to evaluate the effects of urine specific gravity on the
device. The device was challenged with negative, and positive near-cutoff hCG
samples with specific gravities of 1.000, 1.010, 1.020 and 1.030. Results were
correct for all urine samples with specific gravity concentrations between 1.000
and 1.030.
Interference testing was performed to evaluate whether high levels of beta core
fragment interfere with the device. Urine samples positive for hCG (12500 and
25,000 mIU/mL) were spiked with hCG beta core fragment at concentrations
ranging between 62,500 and 1,500,000 pmol/L. Concentrations of hCG beta core
fragment up to 250,000 pmol/L yielded correct results. Higher concentrations
caused false negative results. The sponsor included the following limitation in the
labeling:
In pregnancy, the hCG found in urine is comprised of intact hCG as well as a
number of other variants including free beta subunits and beta core fragment. A
false negative result can occur when hCG beta core fragment is present at
concentrations in excess of 250,000 pmol/L, which may occur later in pregnancy
f. Assay cut-off:
See Section M.1.a above for performance around the cutoff.

Urine samples were collected from 100 women presenting at three different POC sites
to test for pregnancy. Approximately half of the women were less than 5 weeks
pregnant (based on last menstrual period). The women’s ages ranged from 18 to 45
years. The unaltered urine samples were masked, and randomized prior to testing.
Testing included three lots of the candidate device. Testing was performed by 3
healthcare professionals at each of the 3 POC sites. The results of the method
comparison study are summarized below:
