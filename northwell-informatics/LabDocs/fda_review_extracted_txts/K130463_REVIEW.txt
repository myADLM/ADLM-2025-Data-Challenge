The test configuration comes with single drug screening test or any combinations of
multiple drug screening tests. The tests are intended for over-the-counter (OTC) users
as the first step in a two step process to provide consumers, with information
concerning the presence or absence of the above stated drugs or their metabolites in a
urine sample. Information regarding confirmatory testing – the second step in the
process, along with the materials for shipping the urine specimen to the laboratory, is
provided. The test is also intended for prescription use.
The tests will yield preliminary positive results when the prescription drugs
Barbiturates, Benzodiazepines, Buprenorphine, Oxycodone, Propoxyphene,
Tricyclic Antidepressants are ingested, even at or above therapeutic doses. There
are no uniformly recognized drug levels for Barbiturate, Benzodiazepines,
Buprenorphine, Oxycodone, Propoxyphene, Tricyclic Antidepressant in urine. The
tests provide only preliminary data, which should be confirmed by other methods
such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS).
Clinical considerations and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of
abuse test results, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated. The tests
are not intended to be used in monitoring drug levels.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For over-the-counter use and prescription use
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable, as the device is a visually-read single use device.
I. Device Description:
The UCP Home Drug Screening Test Cups and the UCP Home Drug Screening Test
Cards are capable of measuring 14 drugs listed in the intended use at a time. The UCP
Home Drug Screening Test Cups can contain up to five strips that are capable of
measuring up to three drugs per strip and in a dipcard format for the UCP Home Drug
Screening Test Cards. These tests include user instructions, collection cups, Drug
Screening Test Card (in a foil pouch), transportation bag with absorbent pad, mailing box
and identification labels with personal identification number to be used when sending
positive urine specimens to the laboratory for confirmation.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None were referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The UCP Home™ Drug Screening Cups and The UCP Home™ Drug Screening Test Cards
employ lateral flow immunochromatographic technology based on the principle of
competitive binding. Drugs, if present in concentrations below the cutoff level, will not
saturate the binding sites of antibody coated particles in the device. The antibody-coated
particles will then be captured by immobilized drug-specific conjugate and a colored line
will appear in the test line region. The colored line will not form if the sample contains drug
in excess of the cutoff level because the drug will saturate all the binding sites of the drug-
specific antibody. Each strip in the device contains a procedural control that appears in the
control line region indicating that the sample has migrated properly on the test strip.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. The tests are for qualitative use.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Control Materials
External control materials are not supplied with this device; however, this device has
internal process controls. A colored line appearing in the control region reflects that
sufficient sample volume was applied and that adequate membrane wicking occurred.
Users are informed that the test is invalid if a line fails to appear in the control region. For
prescription use, the sponsor states in the labeling when external QC materials should be
tested.
Stability
Accelerated and real time stability studies have been conducted. Stability protocols
and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found acceptable. The information
supports that UCP Home Drug Screening Test Cups and UCP Home Drug Screening
Test Cards have unopened stabilities of 18 months.
Real time stability testing is ongoing.
d. Detection limit:

--- Page 7 ---
The study was conducted among 115 lay persons in the three geographic regions.
Fifty seven females and fifty eight males from ages ranging from 18 and 77 years
participated in the studies. Fifty seven participants had a high school education or
less, fifty eight participants had finished college courses. None of the participants
had experiences using drug testing products before. The urine samples were
prepared to contain strong negative (0% of cutoff), a very weak negative (50% of
cutoff), a weak negative (75% of cutoff), a very weak positive (125% of cutoff), a
weak positive (150% of cutoff) and high positive (300% of Cutoff). The urine
samples with various drug concentrations were prepared by spiking pure drugs or
drug metabolites into drug free human urine, the final drug concentrations in each
urine sample were confirmed by GC/MS except for TCA. TCA concentrations in
the urine samples was confirmed by HPLC. Each participant was asked to read the
test instruction before performing the test, and then run the test independently
without additional help. The test results by the lay users are summarized as below:
