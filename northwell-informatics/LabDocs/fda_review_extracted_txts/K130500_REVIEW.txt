CAPILLARYS IMMUNOTYPING:
The CAPILLARYS IMMUNOTYPING kit is designed for the detection and
characterization of monoclonal proteins (immunotyping) in human urine and serum
with the CAPILLARYS, the CAPILLARYS 2 and the CAPILLARYS 2 FLEX-
PIERCING, SEBIA, for capillary electrophoresis. It is used in conjunction with
the SEBIA CAPILLARYS PROTEIN(E) 6 kit, designed for protein separation into 6
major fractions in alkaline buffer (pH 10.0).
The CAPILLARYS, CAPILLARYS 2 and the CAPILLARYS 2 FLEX-PIERCING
perform all procedural sequences automatically to obtain a protein profile for
qualitative analysis. Each urine or serum sample is mixed with individual antisera
that are specific against gamma (Ig G), alpha (Ig A) and mu (Ig M) heavy chains,
and kappa (free and bound) light chains and lambda (free and bound) light chains,
respectively. The proteins, separated in silica capillaries, are directly detected by
their absorbance at 200 nm. The electrophoregrams are evaluated visually to detect
the presence of specific reactions with the suspect monoclonal proteins.
For In Vitro Diagnostic Use.
IT / IF CONTROL:
The IT / IF Control is designed to quality control the qualitative detection and
characterization of human monoclonal immunoglobulins (Ig G, Ig A, Ig M, Kappa
and Lambda) with the electrophoresis methods:
- Immunotyping performed using capillary electrophoresis on SEBIA
CAPILLARYS 2 and CAPILLARYS 2 FLEX PIERCING instruments and on
SEBIA MINICAP instrument,
- Immunofixation methods: SEBIA HYDRAGEL IF, HYDRAGEL IF Penta,
HYDRAGEL BENCE JONES (Standard mask and Dynamic mask)
performed using the HYDRASYS and HYDRASYS 2 instruments and the K20
electrophoresis chamber.
The IT / IF Control is designed for laboratory use. It should be used (with its barcode
label for MINICAP procedure) like a human serum sample. The electrophoretic pattern
obtained is specific for each batch of IT/IF control.
For In Vitro Diagnostic Use.

buffer with a specific pH. Separation also occurs according to the electrolyte pH and
electroosmotic flow.
CAPILLARYS IMMUNOTYPING is performed with specific antibodies to identify abnormal
proteins in the beta globulin and gamma globulin fraction zones of the serum protein
electrophoregrams. Abnormal serum fractions in these zones are always suspect of being
monoclonal proteins (M-proteins, paraproteins, monoclonal immunoglobulins) and therefore, an
indication of monoclonal gammopathies.
The CAPILLARYS System has 8 capillaries functioning in parallel. In this system, a sample
dilution is prepared and injected simultaneously by aspiration at the anodic end of six capillaries
(capillaries No. 7 and 8 are not used). The reference (ELP) pattern is obtained by injection of the
sample mixed with ELP solution in capillary No. 1 providing a complete electrophoretic pattern of
the sample’s proteins. The antisera patterns are obtained by injection in capillaries No. 2 to 6 of the
previously diluted samples mixed with specific antisera against gamma (IgG), alpha (IgA), mu
(IgM) heavy chains, and against free and bound Kappa and Lambda light chains.
A high voltage protein separation is then performed and direct detection of the proteins is made at
200 nm at the cathodic end of the capillary. The capillaries are immediately washed with a Wash
Solution and prepared for the next analysis with buffer.
In CAPILLARYS IMMUNOTYPING, proteins are detected in the following order from cathode to
anode: gamma globulins, beta-2 globulins, beta-1 globulins, alpha-2 globulins, alpha-1 globulins
and albumin with each zone containing one or more proteins. The antigen-antibody complex
(between the sample immunoglobulins and the specific antiserum) has a very anodic mobility
(between alpha-1 zone and albumin or more anodic than albumin).
The superimposition of the antisera patterns with the reference pattern (ELP) permits to visualize
the disappearance and/or the decrease of a monoclonal fraction on the antiserum pattern and to
indicate a gammopathy.
The immunotyping is performed in three automated steps:
1. The sample dilution is prepared with specific diluent which is preloaded in the antisera segment.
This dilution is selected by the user of the CAPILLARYS system according to the sample's
immunoglobulin concentrations.
« HYPERGAMMA » if total immunoglobulins level is > 2 g/dL (hypergammaglobulinemia),
« HYPOGAMMA » if total immunoglobulins level is < 0.8 g/dL (hypogammaglobulinemia),
« STANDARD » if total immunoglobulin level is comprised between 0.8 and 2 g/dL (dilution
program by default).
2. The diluted serum sample is then mixed with individual specific antisera. The antigen-antibody
complex is formed rapidly in the liquid medium. The sample that has been mixed with the
specific antisera in the segment is injected simultaneously by aspiration into 6 capillaries at the
anodic end. The proteins are separated by electrophoresis at high voltage. The separated
proteins are detected at 200nm at the cathodic end of the capillary.
3. The reference pattern (ELP) is automatically overlayed with the antisera patterns (IgG, IgA,
IgM, Kappa and Lambda) allowing visualization of the disappearance or decrease of the
suspected monoclonal component.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within run reproducibility of immunotyping kit on CAPILLARYS 2 instrument:
Three IT/IF control lots were run 6 times within a run and the run was repeated with
three different immunotyping antisera lot numbers. The IT/IF controls were
comprised of one monoclonal IgGL, IgAL, and IgMK. According to the identified
monoclonal protein, the concordant and reproducible within-run results were
obtained.
Between-run and between-lot reproducibility of immunotyping kit on CAPILLARYS
2 instrument: Three pathological serum samples and three pathological urine samples
were run 3 times and repeated in 3 different runs on 3 different immunotyping
antisera lot numbers. The three pathological serum samples were comprised of
IgML, IgAK, and IgGK samples. The three pathological urine samples were
comprised of one IgGL with one free Lambda, two free Kappa and one free Lambda.
According to the identified monoclonal component characterization, concordant and
reproducible between-run results were obtained for both pathological serum and urine
samples.
Between run and between lot reproducibility of IT/IF Control on CAPILLARYS 2
instrument: Three lots of IT/IF Control were run 3 times and repeated in 3 different
