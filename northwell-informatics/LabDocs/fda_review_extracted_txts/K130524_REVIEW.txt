510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
K130524
B. Purpose for Submission:
Clearance for modification of a cleared instrument (K011668)
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Exalenz Bioscience BreathID Hp System
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
H. pylori 13C-urea Breath Test
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The modified BreathID® Hp System is a non-invasive breath test system for detecting
the presence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). The system consists of an electro-optical
medical device with embedded software designed to measure and compute the changes in
ratio between 13CO and 12CO concentrations in the patient’s exhalation and a test kit.
2 2
The test kit consists of:
§ IDcircuit™ - Oridion Nasal FilterLine™ (nasal cannula) (K980325)
§ A 75mg 13C-urea tablet
§ A 4.3g package of powdered Citrica (citric acid)
§ Drinking straw
§ Package Insert (Instructions for Use)
The modified BreathID® Hp System measures and computes the ratio between 13CO
2
and 12CO in the patient’s exhalation before and after the ingestion of 13C-urea. The
2
change in the 13CO / 12CO ratio before and after ingestion of 13C-urea is referred to as
2 2
the Delta over Baseline (DOB).
The basis of the 13C measurement method for both the modified and unmodified
versions of the BreathID® System is a technology called Molecular Correlation
Spectroscopy™ (MCS™). MCS™ is based on the concept of optical absorption of
specific radiation emitted from CO discharge lamps.

2. Principles of Operation:
The Exalenz BreathID® Hp System non-invasive breath test is a diagnostic test that
analyzes a breath sample before and after ingestion of 13C-enriched urea; it is used to
identify those patients with H. pylori infection. The Exalenz BreathID® Hp System
breath test is performed as follows: a 75 mg 13C-urea tablet and 4.3 g Citrica Powder
are dissolved in water, and the resulting solution is ingested by the patient. The presence
of the Citrica creates an acidic environment in the stomach and also delays the transfer
of the ingested solution to the duodenum. These two characteristics facilitate the
decomposition of the urea by H. pylori, if present. Thus, in the presence of urease
associated with gastric H. pylori, 13C-urea is decomposed to 13CO 2 and NH 3 according
to the following equation:
H. pylori urease
2 13C-urea + 2 H O 2 13CO + 2 NH
2 2 3
13
The CO is absorbed into the blood and then exhaled in the breath. Absorption and
2 2
13
distribution of CO is fast. Therefore, the cleavage of urea by the H. pylori urease that
2
13
produces the CO occurs immediately after the solution is ingested and enables
2
13
immediate detection of increased CO in the exhaled breath of H. pylori-positive
2
patients.
In the case of H. pylori-negative patients, the 13C-urea does not produce 13CO in the
2
stomach because there are no human enzymes that can decompose the urea in the
stomach.
The test begins with the collection of a baseline breath sample. The patient breathes
normally while the BreathID® Hp System collects samples through the IDcircuit™ nasal
cannula. The IDcircuit™ extracts moisture and patient secretions from the breath samples
to provide accurate CO2 readings, and the device measures the 13CO2 / 12CO2 ratio of
the baseline measurement. The patient then ingests a test drink consisting of 13C-urea
tablet 75 mg and 4.3 g of citric Powder (4g citric acid). While the patient continues to
breathe normally, the BreathID® Hp System continually and non-invasively samples the
patient’s breath (via the cannula) and measures the changes in the 13CO2 / 12CO2 ratio
versus the original baseline sample. These changes are displayed as a graph on the
display screen while the test continues. The graph shows multiple points that allow the
physician to identify the change in the DOB of the 13CO2 / 12CO2 ratio in response to
the administered 13C-urea. Once the BreathID® Hp System has collected enough data to
determine whether or not a patient is H. pylori-positive, (i.e. the graph passes the
threshold unambiguously), it automatically ends the test and prints out the results.
3. Modes of Operation:
Single sample

4. Specimen Identification:
Manual
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimen acquired through nasal cannula
6. Calibration:
Calibration is performed by the instrument by diluting pre-dose patient breath or operator
breath into five different concentrations within an absolute maximum concentration
range. The device uses these five concentrations to determine the systematic error of the
system and to ensure that the estimated systematic error is below a specified value. If the
systematic error is not below the specified value, the device prompts the user to contact
Exalenz for repair or replacement.
7. Quality Control:
To ensure correct functioning of the BreathID ® Hp System in the field, a self test is
required every 25 breath tests. BreathID® Hp System will automatically perform a self
test after 25 tests are completed, during the baseline measurement phase of the next
patient test. This procedure confirms that the BreathID® Hp System is functional and is
performing within specifications.

BreathID® Hp System
The modified BreathID® Hp System has the same fundamental scientific technology and
principle of operation utilized in the unmodified BreathID® System. The technological
modifications of the BreathID® Hp System are modifications to the configuration of the
system and software revisions as a result of the modified hardware configuration.
This modified BreathID® Hp System is designed to be more compact, less expensive and
easier to maintain than the unmodified system. In addition, the modified BreathID® Hp
System either eliminates or consolidates components that have become redundant or
obsolete.
Analytical studies
Gas Collection Verification
A Gas Collection Verification was performed to verify that the 12CO cell of the 13CO
2 2
and 12CO measurement subsystem of the BreathID® Hp System could adequately
2
replace the Capnograph of the unmodified BreathID® System for measuring the CO
2
concentration in incoming gases. Twenty (20) tests were performed with breath samples
that were not 13C enriched from ten (10) different subjects. Each of the twenty (20) tests
also included seven (7) DOB measurements from the measurement phase (MP) in various
calibration ranges. The results of the Gas Collection Verification demonstrated that the
DOB standard deviation of all measurement phase (MP) test results were within the
specifications, all MP test sample concentrations were within the calibration range, and
that all MP sample concentrations had a standard deviation of less than 0.2. Therefore,
the 12CO cell of the 13CO and 12CO measurement subsystem of the BreathID® Hp
2 2 2
System has been verified to adequately replace the Capnograph of the unmodified
BreathID® System for measuring the CO concentration in incoming gases.

System Check Verification
A System Check Verification was performed to verify that operator breath or pre-dose
9

--- Page 10 ---
patient breath could adequately replace the gas canister containing approximately 100%
CO for the purposes of the System Check, one of the Quality Control functions of the
2
BreathID® Hp System and the unmodified BreathID® System. Twenty (20) tests were
performed with breath samples from eleven (11) different subjects. Each of the twenty
(20) tests also included seven (7) DOB measurements. The results of the System Check
Verification demonstrated that in all cases where the 12C curves were randomly changed
and a calibration was then required, the situation was correctly identified by the
BreathID® Hp System and a calibration was performed. In all cases where the 12C
curves were unchanged and the calibration process was unable to expand the calibration
range, the BreathID® Hp System correctly identified the situation and did not perform a
calibration. In the case where the 12C curve was unchanged, but the calibration range was
expanded and a calibration was then required the BreathID® Hp System correctly
identified the situation and performed a calibration. All test results following a System
Check and calibration were within the specifications of the BreathID® Hp System.
Additionally, all test results following a System Check that did not require calibration
were within the specifications of the BreathID® Hp System. Therefore, the System
Check Verification not only demonstrated that operator breath or pre-dose patient breath
could be adequately used for the System Check procedure, but it also demonstrated that
the calibration process was effective.
Software Verification and Validation
Software Verification evaluated all system functionality and consisted of evaluations of
the software through unit, integration and system level testing, as well as code reviews.
Software Validation consisted of various test cases to qualitatively test the software
system of the BreathID® Hp System. The test case categories that were utilized for the
software validation of the BreathID® Hp System were:
§ H. Pylori Patient Mode Tests
§ System Test
§ Utilities, and
§ System Failures
All test cases were implemented with a known input and an expected output. The
expected output was visually compared against the actual output. All test cases were
verified to have passing results.
Comparative Validation
A Comparative Validation was performed to evaluate the agreement of the modified
BreathID® Hp System DOB measurements to its predicate device, the unmodified
BreathID® System. The Comparative Validation was performed in accordance with the
following standard:
§ Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute EP09-A2 Method Comparison and Bias Estimation
Using Patient Samples; Approved Guideline – Second Edition
The Comparative Validation was performed with three H. pylori samples that included a
high positive, low positive and moderate positive, as defined in the FDA Draft Guidance
“Establishing Performance Characteristics of In Vitro Diagnostic Devices for the
Detection of Helicobacter pylori,” September 23, 2010. The Comparative Validation
was performed with one modified BreathID® Hp System and one unmodified BreathID®
10

--- Page 11 ---
System, executing two runs per day for five days. Each test run included three different
combinations of baseline / post-ingestion gases and each combination of baseline / post-
ingestion gases was consecutively tested twice. The modified BreathID® Hp System and
the unmodified BreathID® System were evaluated simultaneously by connecting the two
devices with a Y-Connector. Calibration was performed on the first day of the
Comparative Validation. The table below provides the results and analysis of the
Comparative Validation.

Clinical Study
A single center, non-randomized, blinded, comparative study was conducted to compare
the modified BreathID® Hp System to the unmodified BreathID® System. The breath
test was performed according to the standard procedure described in the device’s
instructions for use and routine clinical practice while the subject was connected
simultaneously to both the BreathID® Hp System and the unmodified BreathID® System
via two standard nasal cannulae. The outcome measures of both devices were used for
the comparison.
In order to prevent a spectrum bias, the breath test was performed in addition to, and
independent of the local clinical practice. In cases were a serum blood test was
performed, these blood tests were the only means used to diagnose the presence of H.

pylori. In other cases, where the investigator did not feel a blood test was warranted
(change in diet prescribed, or symptoms not specific to H. pylori), the patient was
periodically followed up at the clinic as routine general practice with no eradication
therapy prescribed. In these cases, only if symptoms persisted or became more related to
H. pylori infection, was the patient sent for blood tests. The breath testing was performed
by a site technician and not in the proximity of the Principal Investigator. The breath test
results were made available to the treating physician (Principal Investigator) only once
the patient’s management protocol had been determined. Thus, the test results from both
devices were masked from the treating physician and did not have an impact on the
patient’s treatment.
The clinical study was conducted in compliance with its protocol and in accordance with
the ethical principles under Investigational Review Board (IRB) approval consistent with
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and with applicable regulatory requirements. The table
below presents the subjects’ accountability and the subjects’ baseline characteristics per
protocol (PP).
