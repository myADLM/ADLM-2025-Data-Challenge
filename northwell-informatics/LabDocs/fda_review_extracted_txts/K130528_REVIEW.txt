L. Test Principle:
The BioPlex® 2200 APLS IgM kits use multiplex flow immunoassay, a methodology similar
to traditional EIA; however, this method permits simultaneous detection and identification of
many antibodies in a single tube. In the BioPlex APLS assays, two different populations of
dyed beads are coated with antigens. One bead population is coated with β2-glycoprotein I
and a second population is coated with both cardiolipin and β2-glycoprotein I. Three
additional populations of fluorescent beads function as assay controls. The system combines
an aliquot of patient sample, sample diluent, and bead reagent into a reaction vessel and

incubates the mixture at 37°C. After a wash cycle to remove unbound antibody, the
secondary conjugate containing either phycoerythrin conjugated murine monoclonal anti-
human IgM and phycoerythrin conjugated murine monoclonal anti-human FXIII antibody (a
control) is added and the mixture is incubated at 37°C. Excess conjugate is removed in
another wash cycle and the beads are re-suspended in wash buffer. The bead mixture then
passes through the detector. The identity of the dyed beads is determined by the fluorescence
of the dyes, and the amount of antibody captured by the antigen is determined by the
fluorescence of the attached phycoerythrin. Raw data are calculated in relative fluorescence
intensity (RFI).
Three additional dyed beads, Internal Standard Bead (ISB), Serum Verification Bead (SVB),
and a Reagent Blank Bead (RBB) are present in each reaction mixture to verify detector
response, the addition of serum to the reaction vessel, and the absence of significant non-
specific binding in serum, respectively.
The anti-phospholipid assays are calibrated using a set of calibrators supplied separately by
Bio-Rad Laboratories. Results are calculated for both of the antibodies and are compared
against their own respective cut-off. For anti-β2-glycoprotein I, the results are provided in
units/mL (U/mL). The anti-cardiolipin results are similar except that the units are MPL-
U/mL. The negative/positive assay cutoff for the two analytes of the BioPlex® 2200 APLS
IgM kit is 20 units.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing of the BioPlex® 2200 APLS IgM kit on the BioPlex® 2200
instrument was performed in accordance with CLSI EP5-A2. Two serum and
heparinized plasma panels consisting of samples spanning the measuring range were
assayed in replicate twice daily over 20 days (n=80) expect for the mid negative
samples were run over 10 days (n=40). The data were analyzed at an internal Bio-Rad
site for within-run, between-run, between-day, and total precision and the standard

A second smaller repeatability study was performed following EP15-A2
recommendations using all four sample matrices (serum, lithium heparin, sodium
heparin and sodium citrate) to determine the within-run, between run and total
precision of the BioPlex® 2200 APLS IgM kit. Studies were conducted internally at
Bio-Rad. Each matrix had a least two samples that were negative, 2 near the cut-off,
2 low positive and 2 high positive for a total of 8 samples per matrix. Samples were
tested in quadruplicate over 5 days for a total of 20 measurements per sample.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Six APLS aCL and six aβ2GPI IgM positive patient samples (three high and three
mid-range) were tested to demonstrate linearity. These samples were diluted with
immunodepleted serum according to CLSI EP06-A. Each sample and dilution was
evaluated in replicates of four using one APLS IgM lot on one instrument. Linear
and polynomial regression analysis of APLS IgM recovery vs. sample dilution was
performed to determine if the dilution curves exhibit statistically significant non-
linear regression based on the CLSI guideline EP06-A.
The regression parameters (slope, intercept and r2) of the observed values vs.
predicted values are show below.

U/mL for aβ2GPI IgM.
High dose hook effect:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
There is no international or certified reference material available for APLS aCL and
aβ2GPI IgM. The calibrators are assigned relative arbitrary units (U/mL for aβ2GPI,
and MPL-U/mL for aCL).
Value Assignment:
The calibrators are manufactured independently from the controls, and are stabilized
with <0.3% ProClin® 300, <0.1% sodium benzoate, and <0.1% sodium azide.
Calibrator assignment is established for matched lots of BioPlex® 2200 APLS IgM
kit and calibrators using a master set of calibrators as reference and replicate analyses
on multiple BioPlex® 2200 instruments. The BioPlex® 2200 APLS IgM Reagent Kit
is calibrated using a set of four distinct serum based calibrators for aCL and ab2GPI
IgM, which are used to establish points of reference for determining the presence of
APLS IgM in human specimens.
The negative control has been tested to give results with values below the cut-off for
each assay. The positive control is prepared by blending human disease state serum
with negative serum matrix and is manufactured to give results with values above the
assay cut-off. The value assignment of the Control Set is derived by testing each
control on three BioPlex® 2200 Analyzers with at least two kit lots. For each control
level, three vials are tested in replicates of five using each of the kit lots and each
analyzer. This testing is performed on three analyzers for a total of 45 replicates per
reagent lot. The total number of replicates for each control level is 90 when two
reagent lots are used and 135 when three reagent lots are used. The mean value of the
control is calculated using data from all reagent lots, and the acceptable range of is
based on the inter-assay precision specification (i.e. 2x inter-assay precision).
The target values and ranges (in parenthesis) for the BioPlex® 2200 APLS IgM
Calibrator and Control sets are listed below.

aB2GPI IgM and 8.73 to 14.48 MPL-U/mL for aCL IgM were diluted in various
increments in analyte free serum. Each dilution plus analyte free serum was assayed
daily in replicates of ten for a period of five days (50 data points total per dilution) on
one BioPlex 2200 instrument.
All testing was conducted internally at Bio-Rad using equations from CLSI EP17-A
to determine analytical sensitivity. LoD was calculated as “LoD = LoB + cβSDs”.
For this calculation, the LoB was calculated at the 95th percentile of negative
samples. cβ is the 95th percentile of the standard Gaussian distribution with a
correction factor applied to account for the biased estimate of the population standard
deviation (1.645/(1-1/(4xf)), where f is the degrees of freedom of the estimated
standard deviation SDs. LoQ = LoD if the %CV of LoD is less than or equal to 20%;

e. Analytical specificity:
Interfering Substances:
An interfering substances study was conducted to evaluate the potential interference
of specific endogenous and exogenous substances with the BioPlex® 2200 APLS
IgM assay according to CLSI EP7-A2. Samples were prepared by blending a pool of
negative human serum with samples positive for aCL IgM and aβ2GPI IgM to
achieve approximate values of 10, 20, 60 and 100 MPL for aCL IgM and 10, 20, 60,
100 U/mL for aβ2GPI IgM with interferent or blank. Test and control samples were
evaluated in alternating order in replicates of ten each. Substances are considered
interfering if their presence in a sample results in more than ± 20% deviation in
quantitation relative to the value determined in the absence of the substance. No
interference was observed with any of the substances tested. The substances and the
maximum levels tested are shown in the table below:
Substance Concentration
Hemoglobin ≤ 500 mg/dL
Bilirubin, Unconjugated ≤ 20 mg/dL
Bilirubin, Conjugated ≤ 30 mg/dL
Cholesterol ≤ 500 mg/dL
Red Blood Cells ≤ 0.4% (v/v)
Gamma Globulin ≤ 6 g/dL
Triglycerides ≤ 3300 mg/dL

Ascorbic Acid ≤ 3 mg/dL
Lithium Heparin ≤ 8000 units/dL
Sodium Heparin ≤ 8000 units/dL
Sodium Citrate ≤ 1000 mg/dL
Cross-Reactivity:
A cross-reactivity study was performed to determine if samples from individuals with
various disease states and other potentially cross-reactants interfere with test results
from the BioPlex® 2200 APLS IgM kit. Samples from individual with known
disease states for potential cross reactivity listed in the table below were evaluated
with the BioPlex® 2200 APLS IgM kit. This cohort is different from samples used in

the method comparison and clinical studies. The table below shows the number (N)
of samples containing potential cross reactants as disease state evaluated by the
BioPlex® APLS IgM. The cross reactivity was obtained as the positivity rate from
the ratio of the number of samples scored positive by the BioPlex® APLS IgM assays
to the total number of cross reactant samples evaluated. A positivity rate must be ≤
20% for a minimum of 10 samples for each non-APS disease state to be considered
not cross reactive.

f. Assay cut-off:
The cutoff value and assignment of the calibrators are determined by performing
concordance testing and Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis. The study
to determine the APLS IgM assay cutoff is comprised of two sample groups – one
clinical cohort has 103 samples from patients diagnosed as primary and secondary
APS and 123 from non-APS disease control donors. It was later confirmed by testing
208 samples from apparently normal healthy donors.
The cut-off was established to achieve a clinical specificity of 99% while accepting
the resultant clinical sensitivity. The criteria for choosing a cutoff at the 99th
percentile of a normal healthy population is derived from the “International
Consensus Statement on an Update of the Classification Criteria for Definite
Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS)”, Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2006)
4, 295.
A cutoff of 20 MPL-U/mL for aCL IgM and 20 U/mL for aβ2GPI IgM was
established.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The performance of the BioPlex® 2200 APLS IgM kit was evaluated including 199
patients diagnosed with primary or secondary APS, 346 patients with other rheumatic
or non-APS disease. Results in the measuring range and 10% of diluted total samples
of both the new and the predicate immunoassays are compared.

b. Matrix comparison:
Testing for matrix effects was conducted using more than 38 matched sets of serum
and sodium (Na) citrate, lithium (Li) heparin, and sodium heparin plasma samples
drawn from the same donor in accordance with CLSI EP9-A2. The samples were
spiked with aCL IgM or aβ2GPI IgM positive sera as necessary in order to assemble a
panel of samples to cover the measuring range of the assay. All samples were
evaluated in singlicate in separate runs on two different BioPlex 2200 instruments.
Plasma values were compared to matched serum values. Anticoagulants were
considered non-interfering if the plasma result was within 20% of the serum result
which was equivalent to the linear regression of aβ2GPI IgM or aCL IgM values from
matched serum versus plasma samples has a slope of 1.00 ± 0.2, a y-intercept of 0.0 ±
6.0 and a correlation coefficient between 0.980 and 1.000. The regression correlation
parameters for the slopes, intercepts and correlation coefficient (r) are summarized
below:
