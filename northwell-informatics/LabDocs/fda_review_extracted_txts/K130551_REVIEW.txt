H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is intended for
use in real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays on an Applied Biosystems (ABI) 7500 Fast
Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological
information:
· For qualitative detection of influenza virus type A or B from viral RNA in upper
respiratory tract clinical specimens (including nasopharyngeal swabs [NPS], nasal swabs
[NS], throat swabs [TS], nasal aspirates [NA], nasal washes [NW] and dual
nasopharyngeal/throat swabs [NPS/TS]), and lower respiratory tract specimens (including
bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL], bronchial wash [BW], tracheal aspirate [TA], sputum,
and lung tissue) from human patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection
and/or from viral culture;
· For determination of the subtype of seasonal human influenza A viruses as seasonal
A/H1, A/H3, and/or A/H1pdm09 from viral RNA in upper respiratory tract clinical
specimens (including NPS, NS, TS, NA, NW and NPS/TS) and lower respiratory tract
specimens (including BAL, BW, TA, sputum and lung tissue) from human patients with
signs and symptoms of respiratory infection and/or from viral culture;
· For the presumptive identification of virus in patients who may be infected with influenza
A subtype A/H5 (Asian lineage) from viral RNA in human respiratory specimens and
viral culture in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk factors;
· To provide epidemiological information for surveillance of circulating influenza viruses.
Performance characteristics for influenza were established during a season when seasonal
influenza viruses A/H1 and A/H3 were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation
and during a season when the A/H1pdm09 influenza virus was the predominant influenza
A virus in circulation. Performance characteristics may vary with other emerging
influenza A viruses.
Testing with the influenza H5a and H5b primer and probe sets should not be performed
unless the patient meets the most current U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
(DHHS) clinical and epidemiological criteria for testing suspect A/H5 specimens. The
definitive identification of influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) either directly from patient
specimens or from virus cultures requires additional laboratory testing, along with
clinical and epidemiological assessment in consultation with national influenza
2

surveillance experts.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the
sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely, positive
results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent
detected may not be the definite cause of disease.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent
influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture
should not be attempted unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and culture
specimens.
All users, analysts, and any person reporting results from use of this device should be
trained to perform and interpret the results from this procedure by a competent instructor
prior to use. CDC Influenza Division will limit the distribution of this device to only those
users who have successfully completed a training course provided by CDC instructors or
designees.

d. Detection limit
The LOD of each primer and probe set in the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-time
RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel was determined using both the Quanta qScript and the
Invitrogen SuperScript enzymes. Serial dilutions of two different influenza virus
strains representing influenza B, A/H1, A/H3, A/H5 and A/H1pdm09 were tested to
identify an end-point for detection using both enzymes. RNA was purified from each
of the characterized viruses using one of the cleared extraction procedures. The LOD
for each primer and probe set was calculated to indicate the range of the lowest
detectable concentration of influenza virus (EID /mL or TCID /mL) at which ≥
50 50
95% of all replicates tested positive. The lowest concentration of influenza virus
detected determined the end-point concentration where both the type and subtype
primer and probe sets had uniform detection. If the two endpoints differed in
concentration, the lowest concentration where the endpoints had uniform detection
was reported as the LOD. In all cases, the resulting LOD using the Quanta qScript
was either the same or within one 5-fold dilution of the comparator (Invitrogen
SuperScript). Both the previously cleared enzyme and the new enzyme provided
nearly the same results with respect to LoD determination. The results are
summarized below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A prospective clinical study was conducted during the 2011-2012 influenza season to
compare the performance of the CDC Human Influenza rRT-PCR Diagnostic Panel
using Quanta qScript and Invitrogen Superscript. Residual material from a total of
1,002 respiratory specimens from patients who were symptomatic for influenza-like
illness (ILI) was collected and tested at 6 clinical sites. Nine hundred thirty-one
specimens were included in the data analysis after exclusion of samples with
inconclusive results (42), technician or instrument error (25), or unspecified specimen
type (4). Specimen types consisted of nasal aspirate, nasal wash, nasal swab,
nasopharyngeal swab, dual nasopharyngeal and throat swab, throat swab, and lower
respiratory specimens including bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial wash, tracheal
aspirate, sputum, or lung tissue.
The study population and specimen types are summarized by age range and specimen

Performance of the H5a and H5b primer and probe sets was addressed with an
alternative approach due to a lack of available clinical specimens containing influenza
A/H5N1. Samples for this retrospective study were prepared using a characterized
and titered stock of influenza A/H5N1 virus and human A549 cells. The stock virus
was added to the A549 cell suspension in high, moderate, and low concentrations
with 12 samples at each concentration. The low virus concentration was prepared at
approximately the LoD of the virus. A/H5N1 virus preparations were then treated
with beta-propiolactone to inactivate them prior to testing in a BSL-2 laboratory. Due
to the inactivation, actual virus concentrations are not available. Virus concentrations
were estimated by extrapolation of Ct scores back to LoD studies which had been
performed on live virus. Virus concentrations for the retrospective study are
estimated as follows: Low: 10^1.0 ID /ml; Moderate: 10^1.9 ID /mL; High 10^2.1

were positive: 89,298 (99.7%) were positive for influenza A and 287 (0.3%) were
positive for influenza B. Among 66,978 influenza A viruses for which subtyping was
performed, almost all (66,589 [99.4%]) were 2009 HIN1 viruses.
During October 1, 2006--May 19, 2007, World Health Organization and National
Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) collaborating laboratories
in the United States tested 179,268 respiratory specimens for influenza viruses; 23,753
