2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
A. Bench testing was conducted during design verification activities. Data was
uploaded from compatible meters to the BroadMaster HealthCare System via
USB cable on Windows based systems. Verification was performed on the
following Operating systems:
Windows XP
Windows Vista (32- and 64-bit)
Windows 7 (32- and 64-bit)
Meter memory capacity and data rollover was performed on data from the
Glucose Shepherd Blood Glucose meter and ADVOCATE Redi-Code+ BMB-
EA001S Blood Glucose meter connected simultaneously to test meter memory
rollover and data transmission. BroadMaster HealthCare System was verified to
meet data upload accuracy (100%) and data management requirements.
B. Human Factors Study
36 subjects with typical computer experience and ages (age range 48 to 88 years
old) were enrolled in the Human Factors study conducted for the BroadMaster
HealthCare System. Participants were accessed on: installation of the software on
their test computer syncing the meter date and time, data transmission, viewing
data, generating and exporting reports. The data in participant created reports
5

--- Page 6 ---
matched the stored meter data in 100% of cases.
The ease-of-use study consisted of 36 lay-users with varying demographics (age, sex,
and education level) were included in a usability study for installing, uploading data
from glucose meters, and using features of the software. The participants were
provided the user manual and no further instruction. Following the study the
participants also completed a questionnaire in response to whether the data
transmission feature is easy to use.
Study Feedback: The proportions of neutral-or-better responses (ranked 1-5) for
all 14 items on the Survey Questionnaire for Usability meet the acceptance
criterion of average response rate of >3 (average 3.86).
B. Software documentation was reviewed and demonstrated that the device was
developed under appropriate software lifecycle processes. The following
documentation related to the software was reviewed and found to be acceptable: level
of concern, software description, device hazard analysis, software requirements
specifications, software design specification, software development environment
description, and verification and validation testing.
C. The BroadMaster HealthCare System User’s Guide Readability Assessment was at
a 6.9 grade level using the Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment.
K. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
L. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
