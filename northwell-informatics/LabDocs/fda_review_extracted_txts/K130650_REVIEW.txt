2. Indication(s) for use:
The Status DSTM OXY is an immunochromatographic test for the qualitative
detection of Oxycodone in human urine. The detection cut-off concentration of
Oxycodone is 100ng/ml. The test may be read visually or by using a DXpress
Reader. It is intended for clinical laboratory use only.
This assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific
alternate chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical
result. Gas chromatography/mass spectrophotometry (GC/MS) are the preferred
confirmatory methods. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should
be applied to the test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are
obtained.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The assay is for prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The results contained in the 510(k) were read both visually and using DXpress
reader instrument.
I. Device Description:
The Status DS™ OXY test kit contains complete reagent components and materials
to perform all the tests:
• Status DS™ OXY test device containing a membrane strip and a dye pad. The
membrane strip is coated with Oxycodone-protein (from a purified bovine protein
source) conjugate for the test band and sheep anti-mouse antibody for the control
band. The dye pads contain colloidal gold coated with monoclonal anti-
Oxycodone antibody.
• Disposable sample dispenser.
• Instructions for use.
• DXpress Reader: The DXpress reader captures an image of an inserted
compatible test device and uses a software algorithm to calculate the intensity of
the test line. The DXpress reader interprets test result automatically by
comparing the intensity of the test line to the preset cutoff value. In addition, the
software will use the presence of the control line to determine whether or not the
test result is valid.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

L. Test Principle:
The Status DS™ OXY test is an immunochromatographic assay for the rapid,
qualitative detection of oxycodone present in human urine above the cutoff
concentration of 100ng/mL. The test may be read visually or by using a DXpress™
Reader. The test relies on the competition between the oxycodone conjugates on the
test band and the oxycodone that may be present in the urine sample to bind to the
antibodies. In the test procedure, a sample of urine is placed in the Sample well of the
device and is allowed to migrate upward. If oxycodone is present in the urine sample,
it competes with the oxycodone conjugate which is bound to the membrane, for the
limited antioxycodone antibody which is bound to the dye. If the oxycodone is above
the cut off level, the oxycodone will saturate the oxycodone antibody, thus inhibiting
the binding of the dye coated with oxycodone antibodies to the conjugate on the
membrane. Therefore, an oxycodone positive urine sample will not generate a line in
the test window, indicating a preliminary positive result, while an oxycodone
negative urine sample (or sample with concentration below the cutoff) will generate a
line in the test window, indicating a negative result.
In addition to the test line that may appear in the test window (T), there is also a
procedural control line present in the control window (C). The control line should
always appear if the test is performed correctly. Polyclonal sheep anti-mouse
antibody is immobilized on the control line. The monoclonal antibody-dye conjugates
that migrate through this region will be captured and produce a colored line in the
control window (Control line). The control line works as a procedural control,
confirming that proper sample volume was used and the reagent system at the control
line and the conjugate-color indicator worked. If insufficient sample volume is used,
there may not be a Control line, indicating the test is invalid.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed internal precision studies by spiking Oxycodone into
drug-free urine samples at various concentrations relative to the cutoff
concentration (-100%, -50%, -25%, cut off, +25%, +50%, and +100%).
Concentrations were confirmed using GC/MS. The results were obtained
using visual reads of 3 operators and 3 DXpress readers. The study was
carried using two lots in duplicates over two days.

The performance of the Status DS™ OXY test device was also evaluated at 3
different sites by 6 operators/intended users (nurse, lead clinical assistant,
laboratory supervisor, etc), 2 operators per site. Each urine sample containing
concentration of 0, 50%, 75%, 125%, 150%, and 200% of cutoff, was tested
on 10 devices (5 per operator) and results obtained both visually and using
DXpress reader. The urine samples were prepared by spiking a commercial
standard material into drug-free urine and by serially diluting to the
concentrations above. After preparation, the concentration of each level is
confirmed by GC/MS.

Endogenous substances:
The potential interference of the following endogenous compounds on the
Status DS™ OXY test devices was evaluated by testing spiked urine samples.
Each substance was dissolved in urine containing oxycodone at a
concentration of 50% of the cutoff and 150% of the cutoff. All samples
containing oxycodone at 50% of the cutoff produced negative results and all
samples containing oxycodone at 150% of the cutoff produced positive results
at the tested concentrations indicating no interference at those concentrations.
The potential interferent concentrations tested are shown below:

In addition, the performance of the assay was evaluated under varying pH
levels of: 3.0, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 8.0 and 9 at ±50% of the cut-off
concentration and showed no effect on results with exception of pH 3.0 at
which the device should not be used. This limitation is stated in the labeling.
Further, variations in specific gravity of 1.002, 1.01, 1.015, 1.020, 1.025,
1.030, 1.035 and 1.04 had no effect on results.

Analytical performance of the device around the claimed cut-off is described
in precision section (1 a.) above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of ninety-seven (97) clinical urine samples were evaluated by
comparing the Status DS™ OXY test results to GC/MS. The Status DS™
OXY test results were read visually and with the DXpress™ reader. Samples
were masked to the operators. Further, the visual test and the DXpress reader
test were performed by two different operators, respectively, who were
unaware of each other’s results. There was 100% agreement between the
reader test results and the visual test results. The summarized test results are
shown in the table below.
