dehydrogenase concentration is directly determined by multiplying the change in
absorbance of the unknown samples by the calibrator factor on the reagent barcode.
Amylase (AMY): Alpha amylases in blood samples react with the substrate alfa-2-
chloro-4-nitrophenyl-galactopyranosylmaltoside (Gal-G2-CNP), and the substrate is
cleaved into 4-galactopyranosylmaltose (Gal-G2) and 2-chloro-4-nitrophenol (CNP).
Amylase activity is determined by measuring the production rate of CNP (yellow).
Amylase concentration is directly determined by multiplying the change in

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study for Lactate Dehydrogenase (LD) was conducted based on the
CLSI EP6-A guidelines by comparing observed versus expected values for 12
samples. Twelve (12) serial dilutions (1 to 1313 U/L) were prepared and tested.
The dilutions were prepared using a commercial linearity/calibration set. The
calibration samples were assigned their reference values arithmetically from the
labeled values and were tested in duplicate by the Hitachi E40 Clinical Analyzer.
The mean Hitachi results (y-axis) were plotted against the expected values (x-
axis). The parameters of linear regression are as follows:
y = 0.9441x + 9.6975
R²=0.9962
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claim that the Hitachi S Test LD
test is linear across the measuring range of 10 to 1,000 U/L.
A linearity study for Amylase (AMY) was conducted based on the CLSI EP6-A
guidelines by comparing observed versus expected values for 10 samples. Ten
(10) serial dilutions (3.4 to 1858.5 U/L) were prepared and tested. The dilutions
were prepared using a commercial linearity/calibration set. The calibration
samples were assigned their reference values arithmetically from the labeled
values and were tested in duplicate by the Hitachi E40 Clinical Analyzer. The
mean Hitachi results (y-axis) were plotted against the expected values (x-axis).
The parameters of linear regression are as follows:
y = 1.0109x – 0.8232
R²=0.9987
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claim that the Hitachi S Test AMY
test is linear across the measuring range of 4 to 1,500 U/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Each lot of HITACHI S TEST LD cartridges and each lot of HITACHI S TEST
AMY cartridges is calibrated by the manufacturer prior to shipment using
material traceable to Japanese Enzyme Reference Material (JC-ERM). The
barcode printed on each cartridge provides the analyzer with lot- specific
calibration data. Lactate dehydrogenase and amylase concentrations are directly
determined by multiplying the change in absorbance of the unknown sample by
the calibrator factor on the barcode. No user calibration is needed. Commercially
available controls are required but not provided. The labeling states “Users should
follow federal, state, and local regulatory requirements regarding quality control
practices.”

d. Detection limit:
Detection limit studies were performed according to CLSI EP17-A, Protocols for
Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation. The blank
sample for the reagent system was assayed on the Hitachi Clinical Analyzer E40,
20 times per day for three days for a total of 60 replicate results to determine
LOB. Five low samples were assayed on the Hitachi Clinical Analyzer E40, 4
times per day for three days for a total of 60 replicate results with the specific
reagent cartridges to determine LOD. Seven samples covering the sample range
between 0 and 20 U/L were tested for Lactate Dehydrogenase (LD). Seven
samples covering the sample range between 0 and 10 U/L were tested for
Amylase (AMY). All of the low samples were assayed 6 times on one instrument
with one lot of cartridges to determine LoQ. The LoQ was determined based on
inter-assay precision of < 20% CV. Results of the LoB, LoD and LoQ are
summarized below.

The claimed measuring range of Hitachi S Test LD is 10 to 1,000 U/L.
The claimed measuring range of Hitachi S Test AMY is 4 to 1,500 U/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed according to CLSI EP7-A2, (Interference
Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline) to determine the effects
from potential interferents. Two levels of serum samples (LD low and high,
approximately 100 U/L and 350U/L) were spiked to six levels with each
interferent. Two levels of serum samples (AMY low and high, approximately
150 U/L and 300U/L) were spiked to six levels with each interferent. All seven
samples (the 6 spiked samples and unspiked sample) for each analyte, Lactate
Dehydrogenase (LD) and Amylase (AMY), were tested in replicates of three on
the Hitachi E40 Clinical Analyzer. In each case, the spiked sample result mean
was compared to its neat control mean result, and recoveries were calculated. The
sponsor claims no significant interference as ≤10% difference for the substances
and concentrations listed in the table below.

K3-EDTA plasma. Thirty-nine (39) matched serum/plasma samples that spanned
the range of the assay (32 to 804 U/L) were assayed in singleton. The study set
included five diluted samples and six spiked samples. The results were compared
using linear regression (plasma = y-axis, each type).

The sponsor claims that lithium heparin and K3-EDTA are acceptable anti-
coagulants to be used with the LD assay.
A study for Amylase (AMY) was performed to validate the use of two plasma
types as an alternative to serum for the Hitachi Clinical Analyzer E40 with S
TEST Reagent Cartridge AMY. The plasma types were lithium heparin and K3-
EDTA plasma. Forty-three (43) matched serum/plasma samples that spanned the
range of the assay (5 to 1494 U/L) were assayed in singleton. The study set
included seven diluted samples and nine spiked samples. The results were
compared using linear regression (plasma = y-axis, each type). The performance
characteristics were as follows.
