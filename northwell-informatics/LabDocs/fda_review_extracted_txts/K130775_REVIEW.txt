510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
k130775
B. Purpose for Submission:
Expansion of the Duet™ System applications to include the automated FISH detection and
enumeration of gene rearrangements involving the ALK gene.
Modification of the Duet™ system from its previous configuration (Version 2.5) to contain
an updated camera, display and slide loader in Version 3.5.
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Bioview, Ltd.
Duet™ System
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
As an adjunctive automated FISH enumeration tool, in conjunction with manual review of
the digital image.
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Duet™ System is an automated scanning microscope and image analysis system.
The Duet™ System workstation integrates a microscope, CCD camera, motorized stage,
computer, keyboard, mouse, joystick, monitor and a dedicated software program. The
Duet™ System scans cell samples in high resolution and in full color at high speed both
in bright light and fluorescent illumination. The Duet™ System suggests classification of
the cells according to their morphological features, their staining and fluorescent signals
and allows the user to examine the results, correct them as needed and generate a report
summarizing the sample’s data.
This particular Duet™ system application is an accessory to h the Vysis® ALK Break
Apart FISH Probe Kit.
2. Principles of Operation:
Samples are prepared according the instructions for the Vysis® ALK Break Apart FISH
Probe kit. The user selects the appropriate areas for analysis in accordance with the ALK
kit instructions. The Duet™ System automatically captures images for each of the
selected areas. The user is instructed to select the cells for analysis, according the ALK
kit instructions. An automatic algorithm detects fusion signals and non-fused orange and
green signals in each cell and suggests a classification for the cell. The user is instructed
to review the signal enumeration for all relevant cells. The total number of positive cells,
negative cells and their percentage are automatically calculated and presented to the user.
A pathologist confirms the calculated results by manual review of the digital image. In

the case of an equivocal sample (10 to 50% positive), additional cells are selected and
analyzed. The mean of the two analyses will determine the final sample score.
3. Modes of Operation:
Semi-automated computer assisted interpretation
4. Specimen Identification:
Barcode reader
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimens are FFPE NSCLC tissue specimens on glass slides hybridized with the Vysis®
ALK Break Apart FISH Probe kit.
6. Calibration:
The system requires periodic calibration which should be performed only by BioView
authorized personnel.
7. Quality Control:
Control slides are prepared and run concurrently with patient slides according to the
Vysis® ALK BREAK Apart Kit instructions. The control slides are tested on the Duet™
System according to the same procedure as patient slides. It is the responsibility of the
pathologist to assure the control slides meet quality acceptance criteria.
8. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and Software Development processes for
this line of product types:

G. Intended Use:
1. Indication(s) for Use:
The Duet™ System is an automated scanning microscope and image analysis system. It
is intended for in-vitro diagnostic use as an aid to the pathologist in the detection,
classification and counting of cells of interest based on color, intensity, size, pattern and
shape.
The Duet™ System is intended to:
· Detect Hematopoietic cells stained by Giemsa stain, Immunohistochemistry or ISH
(with brightfield and fluorescent) prepared from cell suspension.
· Detect amniotic cells stained by FISH (using direct labeled DNA probes for
chromosomes X, Y, 13, 18 and 21).
· Detect aneuploidy for chromosomes 3, 7, 17 and loss of the 9p21 locus via FISH in
urine specimens from subjects with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, probed
by the Vysis Urovysion™ Bladder Cancer Kit.
· Detect and quantify chromosome 17 and the HER-2/neu gene via fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) in interphase nuclei from formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded
human breast cancer tissue specimens, probed by the Vysis® PathVysion™ HER-2
DNA Probe Kit. The Duet™ is to be used as an adjunctive automated enumeration
tool, in conjunction with manual review of the digital image, to assist in determining
HER-2/neu gene to chromosome 17 signal ratio.
· Qualitatively detect rearrangements involving the ALK gene via fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) tissue specimens, probed with the Vysis® ALK Break Apart
FISH Probe Kit. The Duet™ is to be used as an adjunctive automated enumeration
tool, in conjunction with manual review of the digital image.
Note: The pathologist should verify the image analysis software application score.
2. Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
For prescription use only.

J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy:
Slides containing formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens from
patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were hybridized with the FDA
approved Vysis® ALK Break Apart FISH Probe Kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Each site was asked to prepare at least 30 slides from which at least 8 slides should be
either equivocal or positive. The slides were taken from archived slides that were
previously counted and analyzed manually. The staff was guided that the slides were
selected in consecutive order.
At three clinical sites, a total of 113 slides including 12 cases in the equivocal zone
were analyzed. Method comparison results for all three sites combined are presented
below in Table 1:

2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
A number of probes (intended use points 1-4) were previously cleared for use with device
version 2.5. In order to determine whether the performance of these probes on device
version 3.5 has been impacted, additional technical descriptions and performance data
were reviewed comparing performance of the two instrument versions. The additional
technical descriptions and performance data were sufficient to demonstrate that device
performance has not been impacted by the instrument version change.
K. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
L. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
