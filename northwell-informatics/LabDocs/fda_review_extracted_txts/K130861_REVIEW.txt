L. Test Principle:
Dako FLEX Monoclonal Mouse Anti-Human Progesterone Receptor, Clone PgR 636,
Ready-to-use (Link) Antibody specifically binds to PR proteins located in the cell nucleus of
PR-expressing cells. It is optimized for use on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded breast
tissues. Automated immunohistochemical staining is performed on routinely processed,
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens using a specific heat-induced epitope
retrieval (HIER) method and incubation with the primary mouse monoclonal antibody PR,
Clone PgR 636. The procedure employs a ready-to-use horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked
visualization reagent. The enzymatic conversion of the added DAB+ chromogen results in
the formation of a visible reaction product at the antigen site. The tissue slide may then be
counterstained with hematoxylin stain and coverslipped. The slide is visualized with a light
microscope and scored as positive if ≥1% of tumor cell shows nuclei staining of any intensity
or negative if <1% nuclei tumor cell shows nuclei staining of any intensity.

Intra-run, inter-run and inter-instrument/operator precision: Studies to assess the
intra-run, inter-run and inter-instrument/operator precision were conducted using the
Flex Monoclonal Mouse Anti-Human Progesterone Receptor, Clone PgR 636, Ready-
to-Use device on the Dako Autostainer Link 48 instrument, using the recommended
staining procedure with EnVision™ FLEX+ Visualization System and PT Link pre-
treatment module. In each of these studies, 12 different paraffin embedded tissue
blocks of human breast carcinoma were evaluated. The sample set represented the
dynamic range of PR protein expression including 4 cases around the cut-off. Three
sections from each block were stained by one operator for intra-run precision study,
one section from each tissue block was stained by one operator on each of five non-
consecutive days for inter-run precision study, and a total of 3 sections from each
tissue block were stained on three different Autostainer instruments by 3 different
operators for inter-instrument precision study. Each run included one section from
each block that was stained with a negative control reagent. Positive staining was
defined as ≥ 1 % of tumor nuclei stained at any intensity. For all the studies, staining
score for each tissue block stained with Anti-PR, Clone PgR 636 did not differ within
the runs, across the different runs or instruments, and the slides stained with the
negative control reagent were reported to have negative staining.
Inter-Site Reproducibility: Three sites with one investigator each evaluated tissue
sections from a set of 21 different specimens with approximately equal distribution of
PR positive and negatives cases with three specimens around the cut-off. Each site
performed staining on 5 non-consecutive days over at least 20 days. Study slides
were blinded and randomized prior to evaluation by the site pathologist. Average
positive percent agreement (APPA) and average negative percent agreement (APNA)
between sites were calculated and the results are summarized in the tables below.

Lot to Lot Reproducibility: The Lot-to-lot reproducibility of the Anti-PR, Clone PgR
636 primary antibody was evaluated across three manufactured lots of antibody, using
30 human breast carcinoma tissue samples that exhibited differing levels of PR
expression. The sample set represented the dynamic range of PR protein expression
including 11 specimens around the cut-off. Samples were tested in triplicate for each
lot for a total of 9 serial sections per specimen. Slides were excluded from analysis
due to tissue loss or inadequate invasive carcinoma. Scores for samples from each
block showed 100% agreement within and across lots.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability: Real-time stability tests using three lots of the device and simulated ship-
stress tests using one lot of the device were conducted to determine the shelf life of
the reagent. Based on the testing, the current product shelf-life is set at 18 months.
Controls: Positive and negative tissue controls should be run simultaneously using the
same protocol as the patient specimens in each staining run. Ideally the positive
controls should include a low PR-expressing breast carcinoma tissue. In addition,
each case should also have a negative reagent control slide included in the staining
run.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
Three sections from 30 tissue types for a total of 90 sections were stained with the
Flex Monoclonal Mouse Anti-Human Progesterone Receptor, Clone PgR 636, Ready-
to-Use device on the Dako Autostainer Link 48, using the recommended staining
procedure with EnVision™ FLEX+ Visualization System and PT Link pre-treatment
module. Staining results were available for 88 of 90 tissues. Results from two
samples were not available due to tissue loss. The cell types that most commonly
demonstrated nuclear positivity were epithelial cells, stromal cells, interstitial cells
and inflammatory cells. Nuclear PR expression was also observed in meningial cells,
adrenal glomerular cells, lymphoid cells, and pancreatic islets of langerhans.
Myocytes of the heart demonstrated a peri-nuclear staining pattern. Cytoplasmic

immunoreactivity was also observed in adrenal glomerular cells, mesothelial cells,
alveolar cells, islets of langerhans and follicular cells.
f. Assay cut-off:
A positive staining result is defined as ≥1% of tumor cell nuclei staining of any
intensity and negative result is <1% nuclei tumor cell nuclei staining of any intensity.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
This study was a three-site, blinded, randomized, comparative study evaluating the
performance of the PR clone, PgR 636 device to the PR component of the ER/PR
pharmDx™ device on FFPE single tissue sections from invasive breast cancer cases.
Staining was performed on the Dako Autostainer Link 48 instrument and EnVision™
Flex + visualization system. A total of 258 unique specimens representing the range
of PR expression were used in this study with equal number of PR negative and PR
positive specimens being present. Appropriate positive and negative control slides
were used. Stained slides were interpreted by pathologists and the intensity and the
proportion of cells staining were recorded. Eighteen slides were excluded from
analysis due to insufficient or absence of invasive tumor or tissue shredding. A total
of 240 specimens were available for analysis. PR expression in DCIS also was
evaluated. Slides were scored based on the scoring method specified in the
instructions for use for the predicate device as well as the ASCO/CAP scoring
method which is the scoring method for the test device. The results of the method
comparison study are presented in the below tables.
