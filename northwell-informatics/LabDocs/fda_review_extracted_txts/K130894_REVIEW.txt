H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Cepheid Xpert® MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay, performed on the
GeneXpert® Instrument Systems, is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test intended
for the detection of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) DNA directly from positive blood cultures. The
assay utilizes automated real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the
amplification of MRSA/SA specific DNA targets and fluorogenic target-specific
hybridization probes for the real-time detection of the amplified DNA. The assay
is performed directly on positive blood culture samples from BD BACTEC™
Plus Aerobic/F, BacT/ALERT® SA (Standard Aerobic) or VersaTREK REDOX
1® (aerobic) blood culture bottles that are determined by Gram stain as Gram
Positive Cocci in Clusters (GPCC) or as Gram Positive Cocci in singles (GPC).
The Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay is indicated for use in conjunction
with other laboratory tests, such as culture, and clinical data available to the
clinician as an aid in the detection of MRSA/SA from positive blood cultures.
Subculturing of positive blood cultures is necessary to recover organisms for
susceptibility testing or for epidemiological typing. The Cepheid Xpert
MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay is not intended to monitor treatment for
MRSA/SA infections.

I. Device Description:
The Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay system performs real-time, multiplex
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of Staphylococcus aureus and
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus DNA. The assay is performed directly on
positive blood culture specimens using Becton Dickinson BD BACTEC Plus
Aerobic/F, bioMérieux BacT/ALERT SA (Standard Aerobic), or Trek Diagnostic
VersaTREK REDOX 1 (aerobic) blood cultures bottles that are determined as Gram-
Positive Cocci in Clusters (GPCC) or as Gram-Positive Cocci in singles (GPC) by
Gram stain. The primers and probes specifically detect nucleic acid sequences of the
staphylococcal protein A (spa), the gene for methicillin/oxacillin resistance (mecA),
and staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCCmec) inserted into the SA
chromosomal attB site. The test includes a sample processing control (SPC) to
control for adequate processing of the target bacteria and to monitor the presence of
inhibitor(s) in the PCR assay to reduce false-negative results. The SPC also indicates
whether the PCR reaction conditions (temperature and time) are appropriate for the
amplification reaction and that the PCR reagents are functional. The Probe Check
Control (PCC) verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling in the cartridge, probe
integrity, and dye stability.
The specimen for testing with the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay is prepared
from an aliquot taken from a positive blood culture bottle. Using one of the
disposable fixed 50 μL volume transfer pipettes provided with the test kit, an aliquot
of the positive blood culture is transferred into a single-use tube of Elution Reagent,
also provided with the kit. The Elution Reagent is briefly vortexed and the entire
content is transferred to the “S” chamber of the disposable fluidic Xpert MRSA/SA
Blood Culture Assay cartridge, after which the cartridge is ready to be place on the
GeneXpert Instrument System.
The GeneXpert Instrument Systems perform sample preparation by mixing the
sample with the sample preparation control (Bacillus globigii in the form of a dry
spore cake within the cartridge) and treatment reagents, capturing the bacterial cells
on a filter, lysing the cells using glass beads and an ultrasonic horn, then eluting the
released DNA. The DNA solution is then mixed with dry PCR reagents and
transferred into the PCR tube for real-time PCR and detection. In this platform,
sample preparation, amplification, and real-time detection are all fully-automated.
Summary and detailed test results are obtained in approximately 60 minutes and are
displayed in tabular and graphic formats.

for the Detection and Differentiation of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) and Staphylococcus aureus (SA)
L. Test Principle:
The primers and probes in the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay are designed to
detect proprietary gene sequences for the staphylococcal protein A (spa), for
methicillin/oxacillin resistance (mecA), and for the staphylococcal chromosomal
cassette (SCCmec) insertion event into the Staphylococcus aureus chromosomal attB
site. The Staphylococcal protein A (spa) gene codes for a monomeric cell wall
component of Staphylococcus aureus. Methicillin resistance in SA is caused by the
acquisition of an exogenous gene, mecA that encodes an altered beta lactam-resistant
penicillin-binding protein (PBP), termed PBP2a or PBP2′. The mecA gene is carried
on a large heterologous mobile genetic element – the staphylococcal chromosomal

cassette or SCCmec. SCCmec DNA integrates at a specific attachment site (attB) in
the methicillin susceptible SA (MSSA) chromosome located at the 3′ end of an open
reading frame (ORF), orfX, of unknown function. SCCmec types have been
identified and designated into a number of sub-types.
The firm identified twelve primer and three probe sequences using in silico design
tools to develop specific complimentary sequences for spa, mecA and SCCmec
targets. In silico experiments simulated all secondary structures for targets (optimal
and suboptimal), primers (optimal and suboptimal), homodimers, and target and
primer heterodimers, given specified conditions. Values for Tm, dG, percent bound,
and concentrations for all species were calculated. Using various software tools,
unwanted predicted interactions between oligonucleotides and non-Staphylococcus
aureus targets were evaluated thermodynamically and minimized.
The test begins when a blood culture bottle becomes positive. Routine processing of
the bottle involves withdrawal of an aliquot from the bottle to perform a Gram stain
and to inoculate solid media. For positive blood culture that are determined to be
Gram-positive Cocci in clusters (GPCC) or Gram-positive cocci in singles (GPC), an
aliquot is collected and transported to the GeneXpert System area. The user uses a
firm supplied fixed volume transfer pipette, 50 μL of positive blood culture is
transferred to the tube containing 2.0 mL elution reagent. Following a 10 second
vortex, the eluted material is transferred to the “S” chamber of the cartridge. The user
initiates a test from the system user interface and the instrument signals the user
where to place the cartridge. The cartridge is manually placed into the indicated
module in the GeneXpert Dx System Instrument, or onto a conveyor belt on the
GeneXpert Infinity System. The GeneXpert Infinity System then transports the
cartridge to the appropriate GeneXpert module or to the holding area for later
transport to the appropriate GeneXpert module. Instrument controlled fluidic
movements transfer the sample and reagents to and from different chambers within
the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay cartridge.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision
The precision of the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay was tested with an
in-house blinded study using a precision panel consisting of 11 panel
members. Samples were prepared using cultured material in a simulated
matrix at high, moderate and low levels. The study design incorporated
testing of two strains of MRSA and one strain of MSSA. The MRSA-1 strain
was MRSA Type III and the MRSA-2 strain was a heterogeneous oxacillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Type IV (ATCC 43300). A total of 96

Page - 7/40
replicates of each of the 11 panel members were tested per instrument
platform (Infinitity-80, Infinity-48 and Dx). The study design incorporated
the following variance components per panel member:
· One reagent lot
· One test site
· Three instruments
· Two operators
· 12 non-consecutive days of testing
· Four runs per day
All negative samples (576/576) were correctly classified as MRSA
NEGATIVE; SA NEGATIVE.
The MRSA and MSSA high negative samples were prepared to target a
concentration below the LoD where 20 to 80% of samples are expected to be
MRSA NEGATIVE. Overall 45.6% (131/287) of the valid high negative
MRSA strain-1 samples and 79.5% (229/288) of the high negative MRSA
strain-2 samples were correctly classified as MRSA NEGATIVE. Among the
MSSA high negative samples, 76.4% (220/288) were corrected classified as
MRSA NEGATIVE; SA NEGATIVE.
The low positive samples were prepared at a concentration of 1x LoD which
was expected to produce a positive result ~95% of the time. Among the
MRSA low positive samples (MRSA-1 and MRSA-2 combined), 99.1%
(571/576) were correctly classified as MRSA POSITIVE; SA POSITIVE.
Among the MSSA low positive samples, 98.6% (284/288) were correctly
classified as MRSA NEGATIVE; SA POSITIVE.
Among the MRSA moderate positive samples (MRSA-1 and MRSA-2
combined), 99.7% (574/576) were correctly classified as MRSA POSITIVE;
SA POSITIVE. Among the MSSA moderate positive samples, 100.0%
(288/288) were correctly classified as MRSA NEGATIVE; SA POSITIVE.
Among the MRSA low positive samples (MRSA-1 and MRSA-2 combined),
99.1% (571/576) were correctly classified as MRSA POSITIVE; SA
POSITIVE. Among the MSSA low positive samples, 98.6% (284/288) were
correctly classified as MRSA NEGATIVE; SA POSITIVE.
No statistically significant difference in assay performance based on
instrument platform was observed during the study for the negative, low
positive or moderate positive samples. The total standard deviation for all
targets is in the range of 0.5-1.6 Ct. The precision data is acceptable as
presented for this type of device.
Reproducibility
The reproducibility of the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay was tested

--- Page 8 ---
Page - 8/40
with a total 30 replicates of 11 unique panel members across three test sites.
Samples were prepared using cultured material in a simulated matrix. The
MRSA-1 strain was MRSA Type III. The MRSA-2 strain was heterogeneous
oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Type IV (ATCC 43300).
Specimens were blinded with a Specimen ID, which was used to define the
order in which the samples were tested and samples were tested in a different
order throughout the study.
Quality control for the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay consisted of
three samples negative, MRSA positive and MSSA positive. All controls were
run on each instrument by each operator on each day that samples were tested.
Correct results from all controls were required prior to testing any panel
samples.
The study design incorporated the following variance components per panel
member:
· Two reagent lots
· Three test sites
· Three instruments, one unique instrument platform per site
· Two operators per site
· 5 non-consecutive days of testing
· Four runs per day
There were a total of 90 tests per panel member, excluding control runs.
All negative samples (180/180) were correctly classified as MRSA
NEGATIVE; SA NEGATIVE.
The MRSA and MSSA high negative samples were prepared to target a
concentration below the LoD. At this concentration 20 to 80% of samples
are expected to be negative. Overall 61.1% (55/90) of the high negative
MRSA strain-1 samples and 55.6% (50/90) of the high negative MRSA
strain-2 samples were classified as MRSA NEGATIVE. Among the MSSA
high negative samples, 59.6% (53/89) were classified as MRSA
NEGATIVE; SA NEGATIVE; one sample was mistakenly not run at site 2.
The low positive samples were prepared to target a positive result
~95% of the time. Among the MRSA low positive samples (MRSA-1
and MRSA-2 combined), 100.0% (180/180) were correctly classified
as MRSA POSITIVE; SA POSITIVE. Among the MSSA low
positive samples, 97.8% (88/90) were correctly classified as MRSA
NEGATIVE; SA POSITIVE.
Among the valid MRSA moderate positive samples (MRSA-1 and MRSA-2
combined), 100.0% (179/179) were correctly classified as MRSA POSITIVE;
SA POSITIVE. Among the MSSA moderate positive samples, 100.0%
(90/90) were correctly classified as MRSA NEGATIVE; SA POSITIVE.

The shelf life of the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture was tested in stability
studies using real-time stability results and linear regression analysis with data
from three final product lots. Stability testing is ongoing with three lots and
the actual shelf life dating will be determined by the results of real time
stability studies and approved by the firm in compliance with firm approved
procedures. The stability of the product was evaluated at four temperatures
(5° + 3°C, 25° + 3°C, 35° + 3°C and 45°+ 3°C) at predefined time point
intervals up to 36 months following the study plan schedule.
The data for Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Lot 00101 are monitored
according to the times and temperatures specified in the test plan and analyzed
for Ct values for SPC, spa, mecA, and SCCmec. Lot 00101 currently has 6
months real-time data and the predicted Ct values for, spa, mecA, and
SCCmec are within limits for 6 months at 2-8°C after exposure to non-
shipping and summer and winter shipping conditions. Lots 00401 and 00501
currently have 3 months of real-time data and are comparable to, and within
stability limits set by, Lot 00101. Testing is ongoing on three lots for up to 36
months.
Package performance testing and summer and winter shipping simulation
studies were performed. MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay kits were subjected
to package performance testing as outlined in the ASTM D4169-09 Test
Protocol. Individual test inputs included initial manual handling, vehicle
stacking, loose load vibration, low pressure, vehicle vibration, and final
manual handling. Inspections of the packaging concluded that there was no
unusual external physical damage to the protective packaging as a result of the
test inputs. The physical damage sustained by the protective packaging was
considered normal due to the nature of the test inputs. At the completion of
the testing Cepheid examined the packaged assay kits and concluded that
there was no unusual internal physical damage to the assay kits. The
packaging was determined to be suitable for the MRSA/SA Blood Culture
Assay.
Functional kit testing was performed in accordance with the Xpert MRSA/SA
Stability plan. The Ct values for SPC, spa, mecA, and SCCmec were
compared to data obtained from control cartridges stored at 2-8°C and 22-
28°C and not subjected to shipping simulations. Under the conditions of this
study similar performance was observed between shipped samples (exposed to
shipping simulation and summer/winter temperature profile conditions) and
the non-shipped samples at “T=0, Non-shipped”.
Specimen Stability
Positive and negative samples were included in the specimen stability study.
Positive samples consisted of each blood culture matrix bottle containing 10
mL of MRSA-negative whole blood inoculated with MRSA cells (N315,

SCCmec type II) near the analytical limit of detection (LoD) at 500 CFU/test
and incubated at 35ºC for 18 hours. Following the 18 hour incubation at
35ºC, aliquots from each blood culture bottle type were stored at 2°C and 8°C
to represent the extremes of the recommended refrigerated storage
temperature range. Replicates of 8 positive and negative samples were
evaluated at T = 0, T = 1 day, T = 2 days and T = 3 days. Following the 18
hour incubation at 35ºC, aliquots from each blood culture bottle type were
also stored at 15°C and 30°C to represent the extremes of the recommended
room temperature storage range. Replicates of 8 positive and negative
specimens were evaluated at T = 0, T = 2 hours, T = 4 hours, T = 8 hours, T =
12 hours, and T = 24 hours. Following the 24 hour incubations at 15°C and
30°C, the remaining samples were moved to 2°C, stored for an additional 3
days, and tested. Statistical significance (ANOVA) was determined by
comparing cycle threshold (Ct)
values from tests run at scheduled time points and temperatures to T = 0.
Under the conditions of this study, all positive and negative specimens were
correctly identified using the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay for all
three blood culture bottle types at all storage temperatures. The data in Table
2 supports the recommended specimen storage conditions at room temperature
(15-30˚C) up to 24 hours and the data in Table 3 supports refrigerated
specimens (2-8˚C) up to three days until testing is performed on the
GeneXpert for all three blood culture bottle types: Becton Dickinson
BACTEC™ Plus Aerobic/F, BioMérieux BacT/ALERT SA (Standard
Aerobic), and VersaTREK REDOX1 (aerobic). In positive samples, there
were no statistically significant differences observed relative to T=0 (one-way
ANOVA) using the Becton Dickinson, BACTEC™ Plus Aerobic/F or TREK,
VersaTREK REDOX1 Aerobic blood culture bottles at all storage
temperatures and times.
In positive samples using the BioMérieux, BacT/ALERT SA (Standard
Aerobic) bottle, there were no statistically significant differences observed
relative to T = 0 at 2ºC, 8ºC and 15 ºC storage temperatures (p-value >0.05).
One-way ANOVA, however, indicated a statistically significant difference in
spa, mecA, and SCCmec Cts at 30ºC storage. The Ct values for all three
targets (spa, mecA and SCCmec) in positive specimens were earlier than the T
= 0 control for the BioMérieux, BacT/ALERT SA (Standard Aerobic) bottle
(p-value <0.05). This difference is not clinically significant since the reported
results of the assay were not affected.
All negative samples tested in the study remained MRSA negative using the
Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay. In negative samples, there were no
statistically significant differences observed in SPC Cts relative to T = 0 using
one-way ANOVA for all three blood culture bottle types at all storage
temperatures and times.

d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Detection (LoD) test included 3 methicillin-susceptible
Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) strains and 10 methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains diluted in negative matrix. Negative
matrix consisted of 10 mL of Staphylococcus aureus-free whole blood added
to blood culture media (BD BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F, BioMérieux
BacT/ALERT SA Standard Aerobic, or VersaTREK REDOX1 Aerobic),
EDTA blood and MSSE (methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis)
cells at 106 CFU/mL. Negative replicates (n=20) consisted of the blood
culture matrix only. Each stock concentration was quantified by plating in
duplicate and additional plating was performed on each dilution for all strains
included in the study. LoD was estimated using the BD BACTEC Plus
Aerobic/F derived simulated negative matrix and was subsequently confirmed
separately using simulated matrix using derived from all claimed blood
culture bottle types.
In total, the LoD estimation and confirmation study consisted of 1813 unique
instrument runs performed across the GeneXpert Dx R1 systems (GX-IV and
GX-XVI), Infinity-48 and Infinity-80 instrument platforms with a total of 9
indeterminate results (instrument errors). External control runs yielded no
indeterminate or unexpected results.
The LoD estimate and confidence intervals were determined using probit
regression analysis with data over the range of organism concentrations
expressed as CFU/test. The point estimates were calculated using the method
of maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) from the probit model parameters.
The numeric estimates of the confidence intervals (CI) were taken from the
Minitab 16 probit function. The probit regression analyses are shown in
Figures 18.3-1 through 18.3-13.
The LoD for MRSA was confirmed using 10 strains representing MRSA
SCCmec types I, II, III, IVa, IVd, V, VII, and VII. Point estimates of the LoD
for each MRSA SCCmec type along with the two-sided confidence interval
are shown in Table 4. The LoD for MSSA was confirmed using three strains.
Point estimates of the LoD and two-sided confidence interval values for each
of the strains tested are shown in Table 5. The tabular results support the
Sponsor’s performance claim that the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay
will produce a positive MRSA result 95% of the time for a blood culture
sample containing 400 CFU/50µL per aliquot and positive MSSA results 95%
of the time for a blood culture sample containing 300 CFU/50µL per aliquot.

Potential effects on Ct score as a function of blood culture bottle type were
tested in an additional LoD confirmatory study. The three claimed blood
culture bottle types were each tested with 10 MRSA strains representing
MRSA SCCmec types I, II, III, IVa, IVd, V, VII, and VII and three
representative MSSA strains. All testing was performed with organism
concentrations near or at the confirmed LoD for each individual strain. The
mean Ct score per bottle type for the internal positive control and the spa, mec
and SCC targets for the MRSA strains are shown in Table 6and for the MSSA
strains in Table 7.

e. Effect of Competing Amounts of SA on the Limit of Detection of MRSA
The potential competitive inhibitory effect of increasing amounts of MSSA
(ATCC strain 29213) relative to MRSA at LoD was evaluated for ten (10)
MRSA isolates [SCCmec types I, II (2 isolates), III, IVa, IVd, V, VI, VII, and
VIII] including 2 heteroresistant strains. This analytical study was conducted
to test MRSA isolates at the claimed Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture LoD
concentration for each SCCmec type in the presence of MSSA at ten-fold
increasing concentrations (i.e., MRSA to MSSA ratios of 1:1, 1:10, 1:1e2,
1:1e3, 1:1e4, 1:1e5, and 1:1e6). MRSA isolates at the claimed LoD
concentrations in the absence of MSSA cells were run as controls. Cells used
in this study were diluted into a blood culture background matrix. The blood
matrix consists of 10 mL of whole blood negative for Staphylococcus aureus
and 1 BD Bactec Bottle containing 30 mL of media. Dilutions were prepared
daily and kept on ice prior to testing.
Replicates of 5 were run at MRSA to MSSA ratios of 1:1, 1:10, 1:1x102, 1:1
x103, 1:1 x104, 1:1 x105 and replicates of 20 were run at MRSA to MSSA
ratios of 1:1 x106. Negative and positive controls were included in the study.
One replicate of each external was tested.
One of the ten MRSA isolates tested (SCCmec type I, 64/4176) resulted in 18
of 20 positives at a MRSA to MSSA ratio of 1:1 x106. All other sets of 20 run
at MRSA to MSSA ratios of 1:1x106 resulted in 19 of 20 or 20 of 20 MRSA
positive results. The observed positivity rates fall within the expected rate
based on the assumption of a binomial distribution and are within the
Sponsor’s acceptance criteria for the concentration of MRSA tested. The
study data supports the performance claim that, under the conditions of this
study, no significant competitive inhibitory effects were observed at the
analytical LoD for MRSA SCCmec types I, II, III, IVa, IVd, V, VI, VII or
VIII in the presence of competing MSSA cells at ratios up to 1:1x106.

f. Analytical reactivity:
A total of 250 isolates (203 MRSA strains and 47 MSSA strains) were tested.
Tested strains included known USA300 isolates (37), USA100 (53), USA200
(6), USA400 (1), USA500 (7), USA600 (2), USA700 (3), USA800 (9),
USA1000 (8), USA1100 (2), IBERIAN isolates (2), novel mecA isolate
MRSA LGA251 (1) and strains designated PFGE types A, B, and F.
Oxacillin MIC data was presented for 119 strains including 9 MSSA isolates
with values between 0.25 to 8 μg/mL and 110 MRSA isolates with values of 4
to >32 μg/mL.
Of the 203 MRSA strains, the following were represented: type I (6), type II
(79), type III (1), type IV (91), type V (7), type VI (3), type VII (1), type VIII
(1), and type XI (1). The SCCmec type was not known in 13 MRSA strains
tested. Isolates were selected to represent the diversity present in the species
S. aureus based on its phylogenetic structure as indicated by Cooper and Feil
(J. Bacteriol., June 2003 vol., 185 no.11 3307-3316). Selections were made
to broadly represent the primary lineages. Lineages that contain MRSA and
MSSA, as well as those that contain exclusively MSSA were selected.
Pandemic and epidemic strains are included. Isolated “singletons” of distinct
clinical significance, such as ST59 and ST121 were also tested. In a number
of STs, multiples of a given cassette type were tested; these isolates are not
simply replicates of each other, as their spa-type demonstrates, these are
distinct genetic backgrounds. To a significant extent as identified by the firm,
isolates are reflective of the natural occurrence of these cassettes however not
all lineages contain all cassette types.
250 Staphylococcus aureus strains were tested using the Xpert MRSA/SA
Blood Culture Assay. Stock cultures were prepared by suspending the
bacterial growth from an agar plate grown aerobically at 37°C for 18 to 24
hours on Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA) in PBS buffer containing 15% glycerol.
One mL buffer was added per 10 mg cells. Stocks prepared by this procedure
contained 1x1010 to 1x109 CFU/mL. All strains were tested in triplicate using
10 μL of cell stock diluted one million-fold. Colony forming units per test
were determined by plate counts of the same volume and dilution.
Three no template control replicates and one replicate of each external
positive and negative control (Kwik-Stiks, MicroBiologics, St. Cloud, MN)
were included in the study.
The Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay correctly identified 249 of 250 S.
aureus strains; 47 MSSA and 202 of 203 MRSA. Tested strains represent
Cooper and Feil Groups 1A, 1B, and 2, 13 SCCmec types and subtypes (I, II,
III, IV, IVa, IVb, IVc, IVd, V, VI, VII, VIII and XI), 23 sequence types (STs),
79 spa-types, 15 PFGE types, and 17 clonal complexes (CC). The Xpert
MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay incorrectly identified one (1) S. aureus strain

--- Page 20 ---
Page - 20/40
(LGA251) as MSSA instead of MRSA. The S. aureus strain (LGA251)
contains a novel mecA gene representing a divergent mecA homologue
(mecALGA251 otherwise known as mecC) located in a novel staphylococcal
chromosome mec element, designated SCCmec type XI. This was an
expected outcome because the mecA primers and probes in the MRSA/SA
Blood Culture Assay will not detect the mecC gene in this strain due to
mutations in the primer/probe binding regions. The mecC gene in this strain is
only 70% homologous to the mecA gene in other known MRSA strains. The
Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay does not contain a reverse primer with
sufficient homology to amplify the SCCmec (type XI) segment in S. aureus
LGA251 strain (i.e. mecC). All 759 runs provided valid GeneXpert results
upon initial testing. GeneXpert Dx R1 systems (GX-IV) were used in this
study. The no template controls and the external controls gave the expected
GeneXpert test results.
Under the conditions of this study, the results of the analytical reactivity
(inclusivity) study demonstrated that the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture
Assay identified S. aureus strains selected to represent the range of genetic
diversity found in the species based on current known of phylogenetic
structure, and those known to be currently circulating in the health
community. Each of the 37 known USA300 isolates were correctly reported
MRSA positive. Empty cassette variants (2), BORSA strains (7) and
heteroresistant strains (4) were all correctly identified using the Xpert
MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay. A single MRSA strain containing the mecC
genetic variant was incorrectly identified as MSSA as predicted based on
sequence homology.
g. Analytical specificity:
One hundred and one (101) strains phylogenetically related to Staphylococcus
aureus or those potentially present in blood culture flora were tested in
triplicate. Of the 101 strains tested, 91 were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC), 1 was obtained from Culture Collection,
University of Göteborg, Sweden (CCUG), 1 was obtained from Teruyo Ito,
Juntendo University, Tokyo, Japan, 1 carbapenemase (KPC) producing
Klebsiella pneumoniae strain was obtained from National Collection of Type
Cultures (NCTC), UK, and 7 were obtained from the Network on
Antimicrobial Resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (NARSA).
The organisms tested were identified as either Gram positive (74), Gram
negative (24), or yeast (3). Methicillin-sensitive, coagulase negative
Staphylococcus, MSCoNS (27) and methicillin- resistant, coagulase negative
Staphylococcus, MRCoNS (12) were included. All replicates of the 12
MRCoNS are expected to provide valid mecA Ct values. The organisms were
further classified as either aerobic (94) or anaerobic (7).

--- Page 21 ---
Page - 21/40
Stock cultures were prepared by suspending the bacterial growth from an agar
plate in PBS buffer containing 15% glycerol. Each strain was tested using 50
μL of culture adjusted to 4.5 – 9.5 x108 CFU/mL or 1.7 - 3.2 McFarland units.
Positive, negative, and no template controls were also included in the study.
Under the conditions of this study, all of the non-Staphylococcus aureus
isolates were reported as MRSA negative; SA negative. All replicates of the
12 MRCoNS provided valid mecA Ct values as expected however the overall
assay result was negative (e.g. MRSA negative; SA negative). All positive,
negative and no template controls included in the study gave the expected
GeneXpert test results.
h. Assay cut-off:
Lot Specific Parameters and Assay Settings
Lot specific assay settings are generated for every lot manufactured to account
for slight variations in reagent production. The lot specific assay settings
(LSP files) are incorporated into the barcode on each cartridge label and are
transferred to the GeneXpert Instrument Systems via a barcode scanner prior
to initiating the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay.
General Assay Settings
The valid cycle range for two MRSA targets (spa and mecA) is 3 to 36 and the
valid cycle range for the third MRSA target (SCCmec) is 3 to 38 cycles in the
Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay. The valid cycle range for the SPC is
3 to 40. A default setting of 3 is used as the valid minimum cycle for all
targets and the sample processing control (SPC). A total of 40 PCR cycles are
performed in the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay. The SPC is
designed to be sensitive to deviations in the PCR reaction conditions
(temperature and time) and to potentially inhibitory conditions. The SPC
should provide an invalid test result in lieu of a believable but erroneous test
result.
To obtain a valid SA positive test result, the spa Ct must be reported within
the valid cycle range. To obtain a valid MRSA positive test result, the spa,
mecA, and SCCmec Cts must be reported within the valid cycle range. To
obtain a valid MRSA or SA negative test result, the spa, mecA, and SCCmec
Cts must not be reported within the valid cycle range and the SPC Ct must be
reported within its valid cycle range. If the SPC falls outside the valid cycle
range, the test result is Invalid and the test must be repeated.
A tabular summary of the general assay settings which are fixed for all
reagent lots are shown in Table 8.

i. Interfering species
An interfering substances study was conducted with thirteen (13) substances
that may be present in blood culture specimens with potential to interfere with
the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay. Potentially interfering substances
(IS) are listed in Table 9 and include anticoagulated whole blood with ACD,
EDTA, Heparin, and Sodium Citrate, human plasma, three blood culture media
bottles (Becton Dickinson BACTEC™ Plus Aerobic/F, BioMérieux
BacT/ALERT SA Standard Aerobic, and TREK Diagnostics VersaTREK
REDOX1 (Aerobic), bilirubin, γ-globulin, hemoglobin, triglycerides, and
sodium polyanetholesulfonate (SPS). Bilirubin, γ-globulin, hemoglobin, and
triglycerides were tested at concentrations approximately one log higher than
reference levels (http://www.bloodbook.com/ranges.html). SPS was tested at a
10 fold higher concentration than found in blood culture media.
Positive and negative samples were included in this study. Negative samples
(n = 8) were tested per substance to determine the effect on the performance of
the sample processing control (SPC). Positive samples (n = 8) were tested per
substance with two clinical isolates each of MSSA (29213 and 102–04) and
MRSA (SCCmec types II and III) spiked near the analytical LoD determined
for each isolate. This study was completed in two phases. Statistical
significance was determined by comparing cycle threshold (Ct) values from
tests run in the presence of potentially inhibitory substances to positive and
negative buffer controls (One-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s pairwise
comparison method).
Negative and positive controls were included in the study. One replicate of a
negative external control (MSSE) and one replicate of two positive external
controls (MSSA and MRSA) were tested.

All negative samples were correctly reported “MRSA NEGATIVE; SA
NEGATIVE” using the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay. No
statistically significant inhibitory effects were observed on the performance of
the SPC for all negative samples in the presence of each potentially interfering
substance relative to buffer controls.
All positive replicates of MSSA strain 29213 (225 CFU/test) and MSSA strain
102–04 (225 CFU/test) were correctly reported MRSA Negative; SA Positive
using the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay. No statistically significant
inhibitory effects were observed on spa Cts in the presence of each potentially
interfering substance relative to buffer controls.
All positive replicates were correctly reported MRSA Positive; SA Positive
using the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay. A statistically significant
inhibitory effect on some Ct values were observed for MRSA strain N315 (300
CFU/test) with the VersaTREK REDOX1 blood culture bottle (p-value =
0.0211) and bilirubin at 10 mg/dL (p-value = 0.0285) and for MRSA strain

difference from the control reaction. These observed statistically significant
differences are not clinically significant because the difference in the cycle
threshold (Ct) values relative to the buffer control was less than 1 Ct and
therefore no false negative results were reported.
The Interfering Substances Study analytically demonstrated that substances
found in additional blood culture bottle types did not interfere with the Xpert
MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay under the conditions of this study. However,
all clinical study samples were obtained from BD BACTEC™ Plus Aerobic/F,
BacT/ALERT® SA (Standard Aerobic), or VersaTREK REDOX 1® (aerobic)
blood culture bottle types and therefore the Intended Use of this device will
include only these bottle types.
j. Carryover
The single–use GeneXpert cartridges contain multiple chambers for holding
sample materials, a valve body composed of a plunger and syringe barrel, a
rotary valve system for controlling the movement of fluids between chambers,
an area for capturing, concentrating, washing, and lysing spores/cells, dry
real–time PCR reagents, and an integrated PCR reaction tube that is
automatically filled by the instrument. All samples and fluids including
amplicons are contained within the disposable cartridge.
This carryover study consisted of a negative sample (elution reagent only)
run immediately following a very high positive sample (6x107 MSSA or
MRSA cells spiked into the elution reagent) in the same GeneXpert Dx
System module. This was repeated 40 times between two GeneXpert Dx
Systems (GX-IV) and 2 modules for each instrument. A total of 84 runs per
strain were tested (40 positive samples per system per strain and 44 negative
samples per system per strain). A negative sample was run on each module
prior to the first high positive replicate and reported negative as expected.
Under the conditions of this study, no evidence of specimen or amplicon
carry–over contamination was observed. All 40 high MSSA positive
replicates and all 40 high MRSA positive replicates were correctly identified
as expected. All 88 negative replicates were correctly reported MRSA
NEGATIVE; SA NEGATIVE as expected. The external controls (1 replicate
each of a negative and 2 positive controls) gave the expected GeneXpert test
results.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Prospective clinical study:
Performance characteristics of the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay
were determined in a multi-site prospective clinical validation study. Eight
U.S. clinical sites participated in the study. All clinical sites were granted
waivers of informed consent by their IRB for this study. Inclusion criteria
included, but were not limited to: positive blood culture specimen taken from
BD BACTEC™ Plus Aerobic/F, BacT/ALERT® SA (Standard Aerobic) or
Versa TREK REDOX 1® (aerobic) blood culture bottles, and Gram Stain
containing either Gram Positive Cocci in Clusters (GPCC) or Gram Positive
Cocci in singles (GPC).
A total of 869 specimens were initially enrolled in the study, of which 848
were eligible for inclusion. Of the 848 eligible study participants, 792 were
included in the final dataset used for the analyses of the Xpert MRSA/SA
Blood Culture Assay. Of the 848 eligible study samples, 468 were collected
from male and 380 from female participants. The average age was 58.6 years
(range = 1 month to 96 years).
The first run success rate for the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture assays was
96.1% (764/795). The indeterminate cases included 22 ERROR results, one
INVALID result, and eight NO RESULT outcomes. Thirty of the 31
indeterminate cases were retested; one specimen was not retested. Twenty-
eight of the 30 indeterminate cases that were retested yielded valid results
upon repeat assay. The overall rate of assay success was 99.6% (792/795).
Relative to culture with susceptibility testing, the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood
Culture Assay demonstrated a Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) and
Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) for MRSA of 98.1% and 99.6%,
respectively and the PPA and NPA for SA were 99.6% and 99.5%,
respectively. Performance data from all study sites are presented in the
following table:

4. Clinical cut-off:
A Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis was performed on the
clinical validation study data in order to validate the use of the published assay
cut-offs. The objective was to validate the cut-off Ct values by calculating the
maximum PPA (the highest priority) and NPA. PPA and NPA are inversely
proportional for changing cut-off values, so as one increases the other will
decrease. ROC analysis was used to support and validate the 36 Ct cut-off chosen
for spa, mecA, and for the cut-off of 38 for SCC targets. The analysis
demonstrated that the established cut off Ct values maximize PPA without NPA
falling below 99%.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Results from the clinical validation study were analyzed by age group. The
following tables show the prevalence of false and true results for MRSA (Table
10) and SA (Table 11) analytes as determined by the XPERT MRSA/SA Blood
Culture Assay. Results by age group were also analyzed for homogeneity using
the Fisher’s Exact Test. The calculated p-values for all age groups are greater
than 0.05 indicating no statistically significant difference in prevalence between
age categories.

O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay is performed on the Cepheid
GeneXpert Instrument Systems. The GeneXpert Instrument Systems automate
and integrate sample purification, nucleic acid amplification and detection of the
target sequences in samples using real-time PCR. The systems consist of an
instrument, personal computer, and preloaded software for running the tests and
viewing the results. The GeneXpert Instrument Systems require the use of single-
use disposable cartridges that hold the PCR reagents and host the PCR process.
The cartridges are self-contained and therefore cross-contamination between
samples is reduced. In these platforms, additional sample preparation,
amplification, and real-time detection are fully-automated. Results of the Xpert
MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay are displayed in tabular and graphic formats.

Moderate
Software Description:
The GeneXpert Instrument Systems consist of random access, closed-system,
computer-based software and embedded firmware running dedicated
microprocessor-controlled modules to integrate sample preparation, amplification
and real-time detection in a single system. The software assigns access by
predefined user types – basic, detail, and administrative. The user interface
software is designed with a graphical user interface consisting of a monitor with a
pointing device (mouse or touchpad) and keyboard. The GeneXpert Infinity also
provides touch screen capability.
Once the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay cartridge is loaded into the
instrument system, a computer system prepares the instructions to run a test
(assay profile) and then downloads the assay profile to the GeneXpert module.
The system integrates sample processing and real-time PCR amplification and
detection in a single Xpert MRSA/SA cartridge. The Xpert MRSA/SA Blood
Culture Assay completes sample preparation and real-time PCR in approximately
two hours. A test result is provided when the test is completed. During the test,
the software collects test data from the GeneXpert module periodically, analyzes
the optical data, and computes the test result. After the test is completed, the
result is shown on the user interface and a report can be generated.
The Xpertise software is the user interface for the Cepheid Infinity System which
provides functionality for ordering tests as well as automation of loading and
unloading of cartridges into GeneXpert modules within the system. The Xpertise
user interface builds upon the existing core software functionality for handling
GeneXpert modules for cartridge fluidics control, temperature control, optics
control, and data analysis by the addition of automation handling for the robotic
arm. Each of the GeneXpert Instrument Systems process data in the same manner
using the same optics, are calibrated the same, and process signal the same.
The Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay cartridges and the GeneXpert modules
are the same for all the GeneXpert Instrument Systems and the Xpert MRSA/SA
Blood Culture Assay is designed to perform on any of the GeneXpert Instrument
System family models. Each GeneXpert module, regardless of the Instrument
System, processes one sample at a time. Each module contains a syringe drive for
dispensing fluids, an ultrasonic horn for lysing cells or spores, a valve drive for
sample movement, and I-CORE thermocycler for performing real-time PCR and
detection.

Device Hazard Analysis:
The device hazard analysis (DHA) and failure mode effects and criticality
analysis (FMECA) for the GeneXpert Dx was provided. An FMECA was
conducted for the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay, which evaluated hazards
associated with assay design, user, and production/manufacturing failure modes. The
FMECA document includes the identification of the failure mode and cause, the
hazard effect, initial risk assessment, mitigation suggestions and mitigations
completed, and the hazard effect and risk remaining after mitigation, providing a
conclusion about the acceptability of the residual risk.
False negative results, false positive results, and harm to user were considered the
worst case hazard effects to the patient and operator. Risk Acceptability was
identified and rated as intolerable (I), ALARP (A) (as low as reasonably practicable),
or negligible (N)) in accordance with Cepheid’s Risk Management procedure. Based
on the Risk Management Reviews, discussions, the FMECA and the mitigation
actions taken, the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay Risk Management Core
Team judged that all risks were acceptable (ALARP or negligible) following post-
risk implementation of mitigation measures. Information on residual risks will be
printed in the Package Insert outlining the warnings and limitations to the device.
Based on the FMECA and DHA conducted for the GeneXpert Instrument Systems,
the residual risks identified are acceptable.
Architecture Design Chart:
GeneXpert Software Architecture Chart in Attachment II-14 is acceptable.
Software Requirements Specification (SRS):
The SRS documents for the GeneXpert Dx and GeneXpert Infinity Systems
software define the general requirements and documents the detailed functional,
performance, interface, design, developmental and other requirements, as well as
describes how the SRS will be implemented. The SRS is the baseline for the
Verification & Validation (V&V) testing for the software. The software
requirements are written to a level of detail which are testable. The SRS
documents for the GeneXpert Dx System software, GeneXpert Infinity-48
Xpertise software, and GeneXpert Infinity-80/Infinity-48s Xpertise software are

The SRS documents are acceptable as presented.
Software Design Specification (SDS):
The SDS provides a detailed explanation of the design and structure of the
software and is presented as a design output. The operation of the system is
controlled by three functional units. The lowest level is the Infinity system which
is composed of low level devices. The Infinity server runs on a real time platform
and interfaces with the Infinity system. The Xpertise software runs the user
interface on a “kiosk” pc which communicates with the Infinity server. Below is
a list of features which have been defined:
· Common modules and code reuse
· Superclass and sub-class
· Client and server
· Active object vs. user interface object
· Managers
· Event managers and even listeners
· Attach and detach a test
· Binary data handling
· GUID
The approach the Firm has taken toward the SDS as a design output is novel.
From a regulatory perspective this approach is acceptable since it provides a
detailed description of how the software functions and the design principles.
Traceability Analysis:
The traceability analysis chart links together the system requirements, software
requirements, hazard analysis, test reference ID test criteria, and V&V test result.
These documents show the relationship between design inputs, design outputs,
and hazard analysis. Testing references were provided for the unit, integration
and system level testing.
The traceability analysis report is acceptable as presented in document D14662,
D6467, D11845.

Software Development Environment Description:
The Cepheid “Software Life Cycle and Development Process SOP” (Document
#D0058) describes the overall framework in which product software is conceived,
developed, and maintained. Each software project employs a structured life-cycle
process, using the Cepheid Product Development Process (CPDP) as a
framework. The process consists of a series of phases that are performed
incrementally, consisting of activities that result in the definition, creation, or
upgrade of specified products. Selection of the specific activities and deliverable
products is driven by the application and customer user needs and project risk in
accordance with the CPDP. The “Software Configuration Control SOP” defines
the process used to establish and maintain configuration control of software
products and software contained in company products. Software configuration
control activities include both design control of software developmental,
demonstration and validation releases, and formal change control of software
production releases. Software version identification is maintained following
Cepheid’s “Software Version Identification” SOP (Document #D0074) where
major and minor versions are used for describing product software releases. Fix
letters identify software update releases. The “Software Life Cycle and
Development Process SOP” is provided Attachment II-1. The “Software
Configuration Control SOP” and the “Software Version Identification SOP” are
provided in Attachment II-19.
The software development environment description is acceptable as presented.
Verification and Validation Testing:
As stated in Section 16.0, each of the GeneXpert Instrument Systems has distinct
and instrument-specific software. The current versions of GeneXpert Dx Systems
software is 4.4a, the Infinity-48 Xpertise software version 4.3, and the Infinity-80
and Infinity-48s Xpertise software version 6.0a were developed by Cepheid
Software Engineering in accordance with the Cepheid “Software Lifecycle and
Development Process SOP” (Volume IIa, Attachment II-1). Beginning in the
design and development phase of the software project, the versions of each
software item used in the product or system are identified, controlled, and tracked
per Software Engineering’s “Software Configuration Control SOP” (Attachment
II-19).
The purpose of the verification and validation of release versions of the
GeneXpert Dx System software, the Infinity-48 Xpertise software, and the
Infinity-80/Infinity-48s Xpertise software was to verify that the software performs
according to its pre-determined specifications as defined in the respective SRS
documents.
Verification activities were performed following Software Engineering’s
“Software Lifecycle and Development Process SOP,” and for the GeneXpert Dx

--- Page 32 ---
Page - 32/40
R1 and R2 Systems software and the Infinity Systems Xpertise softwares the
verification activities included:
· Source code reviews
· Unit testing
· Functional testing
· Testing of implemented risk mitigations
· Integration Testing
· Regression Testing
The GeneXpert software validations established, by examination and provision of
objective evidence that the particular requirements for the specific intended use
can be fulfilled. Software validation activities for the three Instrument Systems
were performed following Software V&V’s “Product Software Verification &
Validation SOP”, and included for each:
· Installation Qualification at the start of testing
· System performance testing
· Verification testing of Defect fixes
· Verification testing of Risk mitigations
· Data reduction (algorithms for reporting results) testing
· Functional Testing
· Installation Testing
· Regression Testing
· Stress Testing
· GUI Testing
· Boundary Testing
· Data Driven Testing
· Exploratory Testing
· Gray Box Testing
· Error Handling
· Anomaly Testing
· Automated Testing
· Simulated Testing (Infinity system and LIS Connectivity)
· Security and user privileges testing
· GeneXpert biofunctionality (instrument + software + reagents) testing
· Review of Labeling (e.g. installation instructions, operator manual)
The acceptance criteria required that the expected results be achieved and any
required data printouts or screen prints of the test data be attached to the
completed test protocol. Discrepancies from expected results were logged as
Software Change Requests (SCRs). A Software Change Request (SCR) is the
mechanism for tracking software defects (also known as “unresolved anomalies”)
that are not fixed (or deferred) during a software project or found after a software
release.

--- Page 33 ---
Page - 33/40
SCRs, and their corrective or preventative actions, are reviewed by a cross-
functional team to determine the impact on device performance. At the beginning
of each software development project (new, updates and upgrades), the
outstanding SCRs are reviewed to determine which ones need to be fixed for that
software release.
Software may be released with open SCRs which have been acted upon
appropriately (for example, covered in the Release Notes, covered in Operators
Manuals, etc.) following Cepheid’s Software Defect Tracking SOP.
The GeneXpert Dx Software version 4.4a validation, the GeneXpert Infinity-48
Xpertise software version 4.3 validation, and the GeneXpert Infinity-80 and
Infinity-48s Xpertise software version 6.0a validation, were successfully
completed. Test failures were reviewed and determined to be due to software
defects that can be prevented or corrected if they are encountered. The SCRs
open at the end of the validations were appropriately identified and addressed (see
Volume IIA, Section 16.11 “Unresolved Anomalies.”)
The test results for the software versions used with the Instrument Systems show
that the software has been successfully tested as described above and have been
shown to be acceptable for release to customers. Copies of the V&V Summary

3. Specimen Identification:
To perform a test, the user selects the ‘Create Test’ or ‘Orders’ icon, scans the
cartridge barcode, enters or scans the sample ID barcode, selects the assay that
has been ordered (for example, Xpert MRSA/SA), and loads the cartridge into the
module (for the GeneXpert Dx Systems) or onto the conveyor belt (for the
GeneXpert Infinity Systems) to start the test.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimens for the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay are obtained from
aliquots of positive blood cultures collected in blood culture media bottles that
have been confirmed as Gram-positive cocci (singles or clusters). The clinical
study evaluated specimens from positive cultures obtained from BD BACTEC™
Plus Aerobic/F, BacT/ALERT SA (Standard Aerobic) blood, and VersaTrek
Redox 1 (aerobic) blood cultures bottles. An aliquot of approximately 250 μL of
the positive blood culture fluid is transferred to a standard microfuge vial for
testing in the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay (50 μL is needed for the
test). If the aliquot will be tested within 24 hours, it can be stored at either 2-8ºC
or at room temperature. If the specimen will not be tested within 24 hours, it can
be refrigerated (2-8ºC) for up to three days until testing is performed.
The initial drawing and processing of blood culture specimens, performing and
reading Gram stains, and withdrawing the blood culture fluid should be conducted
according to each institution’s procedures. Once the aliquot is collected it should
be transferred to the GeneXpert testing area for testing with the Xpert MRSA/SA
Blood Culture Assay. All biological specimens, including used cartridges, should
be treated as if capable of transmitting infectious agents, and according to the

--- Page 38 ---
Page - 38/40
institution’s safety procedures for working with chemicals and handling
biological samples.
5. Calibration:
Optical and thermal calibration of the GeneXpert Instrument Systems is
performed by Cepheid at the time of manufacture prior to installation and once
yearly or after 2,000 runs per module. The user does not perform any serviceable
functions on the instrument. An internal normalization function compensates for
any optical degradation between calibrations.
Thermistors are located in the thermal reaction chamber and are calibrated to ±
0.50ºC using National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) – traceable
standards. During the manufacturing process, the temperature of the heating
system is measured at two temperatures: 60ºC and 95ºC. Calibration coefficients
that correct for small errors in the raw thermistor readings of the heaters are stored
in the memory of each I-CORE module.
The optical system is calibrated using standard concentrations of individual
unquenched fluorescent dye conjugated DNA oligomers (dye-oligos). For each
optical channel, the signal produced by a tube alone (the blank signal) is
subtracted from the raw signal produced by the dye-oligo standard to determine
the spectral characteristics. Using the individual spectral characteristics of the
pure dye-oligos, signals from an unknown mixture of dye-oligos can be resolved
into corrected signals for the individual dye-oligos in the mixture.
Following one year or 2000 runs, the Xpert Calibration cartridge can be used by
the user to recalibrate the optical system of the modules on the 6-Color GeneXpert
Instrument Systems. The Xpert Calibration kit includes cartridges with reagents
for the optical recalibration and performance verification of the module. The 4-
Color GeneXpert modules cannot run Xpert Calibration and must be calibrated by
Cepheid Service.
6. Quality Control:
The Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay includes internal reagent controls
identified as Sample Processing Control (SPC) and internal system controls
identified as Probe Check Control (PCC) and Max Pressure (PSI). An additional
control is the System Control Check for Temperature. This check is designed to
indicate that the GeneXpert Instrument Systems is operating within validated
heating and cooling specifications.
Internal controls
The SPC verifies that the procedural conditions for the processing of the target SA
and MRSA bacteria have occurred within an acceptable range. The SPC consists

--- Page 39 ---
Page - 39/40
of Bacillus globigii spores formulated into a dry reagent bead included in each
Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture cartridge. The SPC verifies the effectiveness of
each sample preparation step and reaction tube filling by providing an indication
that all reaction components are present and functioning within an acceptable
range. Additionally the SPC enables a method for detecting the presence of
potential inhibitor(s) in the PCR assay.
Test results are reported INVALID if the SPC fails the valid minimum or
maximum Ct specification. If an invalid test result is reported, the test is repeated
using a new sample, a new cartridge, and a new reagent. During clinical testing, 1
INVALID test result was reported out of 826 total runs (795 initial tests + 31
retests) for eligible subjects (0.1%). 107 of 553 true negative SA test results
reported SPC Ct = 0, and 1 of 1 false negative SA test results reported SPC Ct =
0. In each of these cases, either the spa, mecA, or SCCmec test result was positive
and the amplification of the SPC target was competed out as expected.
After sample preparation, bead reconstitution, and reaction tube filling, but
prior to thermal cycling, the GeneXpert Instrument System is programmed to
perform an additional check that the amplification mixture is in an acceptable
state. The PCC verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube filling in the cartridge,
probe integrity, and dye stability. The PCC is considered to PASS if the
fluorescence generated during the check routine meets the acceptance criteria.
If the PCC fails for any SA or MRSA target or the SPC, a probe check error is
reported and the test will not continue. If a probe check error is reported, the
test is repeated using a new sample, a new cartridge, and a new reagent.
During clinical testing, 23 test results were reported as ERROR due to PCC
failures out of 826 total runs for eligible subjects (2.8%). Sixteen (16) runs failed
the minimum PCC setting for the SPC.
In addition to the SPC and PCC controls, another system control monitors the
cartridge internal pressure during all sample processing steps. If the maximum
cartridge internal pressure setting of 120 psi is exceeded during any fluidic
movements, the GeneXpert run is aborted. The maximum setting of 120 ensures
the integrity of the cartridge and main valve body filter, preventing the potential
for fluidic leaks either internal or external to the cartridge. If a pressure abort is
reported, the test is repeated using a new sample, a new cartridge, and a new
reagent. Failure rates related to internal pressure are expected to be near 0.1%.
External controls
Commercially available, ready-to-use materials manufactured by
MicroBioLogics® (St. Cloud, Minnesota) were tested for use as external control
material with the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay. Per the manufacturer,
each lyophilized microorganism is no more than four passages from traceable
reference cultures. MicroBioLogics KWIK-STIK™ is a self-contained package
including a lyophilized microorganism pellet, reservoir of hydrating fluid, and

--- Page 40 ---

inoculating swab. Each KWIK- STIK unit has a peel-off identification label for
easy documentation. The selected KWIK-STIK controls include a negative
control containing methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis cells,
methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus cells, and methicillin- resistant
Staphylococcus aureus cells. Replicates of 20 each were run per the
manufacturer’s instructions using the Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay.
All MRSA positive control replicates were correctly reported MRSA POSITIVE;
SA POSITIVE. The spa Cts ranged from 23.1 to 26.4 (mean Ct = 24.6). The
mecA Cts ranged from 23.8 to 27.3 (mean Ct = 25.3). The SCCmec Cts ranged
from 25.0 to 28.2 (mean Ct = 26.3). One of 20 replicates reported a Probe Check
ERROR. This sample was repeated and resulted in the correct call.
All MSSA positive control replicates were correctly reported MRSA
NEGATIVE; SA POSITIVE. The spa Cts ranged from 25.1 to 28.7 (mean Ct =
26.7). There were 3 of the 20 replicates that resulted in mecA signal. Two
samples reported late mecA Cts (37.4 and 38.9) that were above the maximum
valid cycle of 36.0 and 1 sample reported a valid mecA Ct (35.7). There were no
SCCmec Cts reported.
All negative controls (MSSE) were correctly reported MRSA NEGATIVE; SA
NEGATIVE. Two of 20 replicates reported late Cts for mecA (both 37.3) that
were above the maximum valid cycle of 36.0. No spa or SCCmec Cts were
reported.
Of the total 60 runs, 1 provided an indeterminate GeneXpert result (ERROR).
This sample was repeated such that 20 replicates were run per KWIK-STIK
control. The KWIK-STIK external controls gave the expected results using the
Xpert MRSA/SA Blood Culture Assay. The sponsor is recommending these
external controls to the end users in the package insert.
