H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The FilmArray Blood Culture Identification (BCID) Panel is a qualitative multiplexed
nucleic acid-based in vitro diagnostic test intended for use with the FilmArray
Instrument. The FilmArray BCID Panel is capable of simultaneous detection and
identification of multiple bacterial and yeast nucleic acids and select genetic determinants
of antimicrobial resistance. The BCID assay is performed directly on blood culture
samples identified as positive by a continuous monitoring blood culture system that
demonstrates the presence of organisms as determined by Gram stain.
The following gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and yeast are identified
using the FilmArray BCID Panel: Enterococci, Listeria monocytogenes, commonly
encountered Staphylococci (including specific differentiation of Staphylococcus aureus),
commonly encountered Streptococci (with specific differentiation of Streptococcus
agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes), Acinetobacter
baumannii, commonly encountered Enterobacteriaceae (including specific
differentiation of the Enterobacter cloacae complex, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella
oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus, and Serratia marcescens), Haemophilus
influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis (encapsulated), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida
albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida
tropicalis.
The FilmArray BCID Panel also contains assays for the detection of genetic determinants
of resistance to methicillin (mecA), vancomycin (vanA and vanB), and carbapenems
(bla ) to aid in the identification of potentially antimicrobial resistant organisms in
KPC
positive blood culture samples. The antimicrobial resistance gene detected may or may
not be associated with the agent responsible for disease. Negative results for these select
antimicrobial resistance gene assays do not indicate susceptibility, as multiple
mechanisms of resistance to methicillin, vancomycin, and carbapenems exist.
FilmArray BCID is indicated as an aid in the diagnosis of specific agents of bacteremia
and fungemia and results should be used in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory
findings. Positive FilmArray results do not rule out co-infection with organisms not
included in the FilmArray BCID Panel. FilmArray BCID is not intended to monitor
treatment for bacteremia or fungemia.
Subculturing of positive blood cultures is necessary to recover organisms for

--- Page 3 ---
susceptibility testing and epidemiological typing, to identify organisms in the blood
culture that are not detected by the FilmArray BCID Panel, and for species determination
of some Staphylococci, Enterococci, Streptococci, and Enterobacteriaceae that are not
specifically identified by the FilmArray BCID Panel assays.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):

I. Device Description:
The FilmArray Blood Culture Identification (BCID) Panel is a multiplex nucleic acid test
designed to be used with the FilmArray Instrument. The FilmArray BCID pouch contains
freeze-dried reagents to perform nucleic acid purification and nested, multiplex PCR with
DNA melt analysis. The BCID Panel simultaneously tests a single blood culture sample for
24 different organisms and organism groups that cause bloodstream infections and three
genetic markers that are known to confer antimicrobial resistance. Targeted organisms and
resistance genes are listed in the following table.
Gram-Positive Bacteria Gram-Negative Bacteria Yeast
Enterococcus Acinetobacter baumannii Candida albicans
Listeria monocytogenes Enterobacteriaceae Candida glabrata
Staphylococcus Enterobacter cloacae complex Candida krusei
Staphylococcus aureus Escherichia coli Candida parapsilosis
Streptococcus Klebsiella oxytoca Candida tropicalis
Streptococcus agalactiae Klebsiella pneumoniae Antimicrobial resistance genes
Streptococcus pneumoniae Proteus mecA – methicillin resistance
Streptococcus pyogenes Serratia marcescens vanA/B – vancomycin resistance
Haemophilus influenzae KPC – carbapenem resistance
Neisseria meningitidis (encapsulated)
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
A test is initiated by loading Hydration Solution and a positive blood culture sample mixed
with the provided Sample Buffer into the FilmArray BCID pouch. The pouch contains all of
the reagents required for specimen testing and analysis in a freeze-dried format; the addition
of Hydration Solution and Sample/Buffer Mix rehydrates the reagents. After the pouch is

prepared, the FilmArray Software guides the user though the steps of placing the pouch into
the instrument, scanning the pouch barcode, entering the sample identification, and initiating
the run.
The FilmArray Instrument contains a coordinated system of inflatable bladders and seal
points, which act on the pouch to control the movement of liquid between the pouch blisters.
When a bladder is inflated over a reagent blister, it forces liquid from the blister into
connecting channels. Alternatively, when a seal is placed over a connecting channel it acts as
a valve to open or close a channel. In addition, electronically controlled pneumatic pistons
are positioned over multiple plungers in order to deliver the rehydrated reagents into the
blisters at the appropriate times. Two Peltier devices control heating and cooling of the pouch
to drive the PCR reactions and the melt curve analysis.
Nucleic acid extraction occurs within the FilmArray pouch using mechanical lysis and
standard magnetic bead technology. After extracting and purifying nucleic acids from the
unprocessed sample, the FilmArray performs a nested multiplex PCR that is executed in two
stages. During the first stage, the FilmArray performs a single, large volume, highly
multiplexed PCR reaction which includes all primers of the outer primer sets. The products
from first stage PCR are then diluted and combined with a fresh, primer-free master mix and
a fluorescent double stranded DNA binding dye (LC Green® Plus+, BioFire Diagnostics).
The solution is then distributed to each well of the array. Array wells contain sets of primers
designed specifically to amplify sequences internal to the PCR products generated during the
first stage PCR reaction. The 2nd stage PCR, or nested PCR, is performed in singleplex
fashion in each well of the array. At the conclusion of the 2nd stage PCR, the array is
interrogated by melt curve analysis for the detection of signature amplicons denoting the
presence of specific targets. A digital camera placed in front of the 2nd stage PCR captures
fluorescent images of the PCR reactions and software interprets the data. The FilmArray
Software automatically interprets the results of each DNA melt curve analysis and combines
the data with the results of the internal pouch controls to provide a test result for each
organism and antimicrobial resistance gene on the panel.
Test results for antimicrobial resistance genes are only reported when an associated organism
(as shown in the following table) is detected in the same test.
Antimicrobial Resistance Genes and Associated Organisms
Antimicrobial Resistance Genes Associated Organism
mecA Staphylococcus
vanA/B* Enterococcus
Any Enterobacteriaceae,
KPC A. baumannii, and/or
P. aeruginosa
While many of the individual assays within the BCID Panel detect one specific organism, the
following BCID assays can detect multiple organisms within a genus or family:
· Enterococcus: Detects most species of Enterococcus (see analytical reactivity study
below).

[Table 1 on page 4]
	Antimicrobial Resistance Genes			Associated Organism	
mecA			Staphylococcus		
vanA/B*			Enterococcus		
KPC			Any Enterobacteriaceae,
A. baumannii, and/or
P. aeruginosa		

--- Page 5 ---
· Staphylococcus: The BCID Panel contains three assays for the detection of
Staphylococcus species. The Staphylococcus aureus assay and two multi-species
assays (Staphylococcus1 and Staphylococcus2). The Saureus assay detects all strains
of S. aureus and does not cross-react with other organisms, including other species of
Staphylococcus. The multi-species assays detect the most prevalent coagulase-
negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) species encountered in blood culture specimens and
can also react with high levels of S. aureus. The FilmArray Software integrates the
results of the three Staphylococcus assays into a final Staphylococcus test result. If all
three assays are negative, the test result will be Staphylococcus Not Detected. If any
of the three assays is positive, the result will be Staphylococcus Detected. Results for
the Saureus assay (positive or negative) determine the Staphylococcus aureus test
result (Detected or Not Detected, respectively).
· Streptococcus: The BCID Panel contains four assays for the detection of
Streptococcus species. Species-specific assays are included for the detection of Group
A Strep (Spyogenes), Group B Strep (Sagalactiae), and Spneumoniae. The fourth
assay is a multi-species assay (Streptococcus) designed to react with select Viridans
group and other Streptococcus species encountered in blood culture specimens.
However, the BCID Panel may not detect all Streptococcus species. The FilmArray
Software integrates the results of all four Streptococcus assays into a final
Streptococcus result as shown in the table below. If all of the assays are negative, the
test result will be Streptococcus Not Detected. Alternatively, if any of the four assays
are positive, the test result will be Streptococcus Detected. Results for each species-
specific assay are also reported independently.
· Enterobacteriaceae: The BCID Panel includes seven assays to detect members of the
Enterobacteriaceae family. Six genus/species specific assays are included for the
detection of Enterobacter cloacae (and other E. cloacae complex species);
Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus spp., and
Serratia marcescens. A seventh assay (the Enteric assay) will react with some (not
all) species detected by the other six assays; however, its primary function is to detect
other less common, but clinically relevant members of the Enterobacteriaceae family.
Combined, these seven assays will detect many, but not all Enterobacteriaceae (see
Analytical Reactivity section below). A positive result for any of the seven
Enterobacteriaceae-associated assays will generate an Enterobacteriaceae Detected
result. Each specific genus/species assay result will also be reported independently.
Results for the Enteric assay are not reported independently, but are incorporated into
the Enterobacteriaceae test result. Negative results for all seven assays will generate
an Enterobacteriaceae Not Detected result.
· Enterobacter cloacae complex: The Enterobacter cloacae complex is comprised of
six species (E. asburiae, E. cloacae, E. hormaechei, E. kobei, E. ludwigii, and E.
nimipressuralis) that may all be identified as E. cloacae by phenotypic laboratory
methods. Of the six species in the complex, the BCID Panel Ecloacae assay detects E.
cloacae (subspecies cloacae and dissolvens), E. asburiae, and E. hormaechei.
· Proteus: The BCID Panel Proteus assay detects four of five characterized species

--- Page 6 ---
within the genus (P. mirabilis, P. hauseri, P. penneri, and P. vulgaris).
Materials provided in each kit:
· Individually packaged FilmArray BCID Panel Pouches: The BCID pouches are used

L. Test Principle:
The FilmArray BCID pouch is a closed system that houses all the chemistry required to
isolate, amplify, and detect nucleic acid from multiple bloodstream pathogens within a single
blood culture sample. The user of the FilmArray BCID Panel loads the sample into the
FilmArray BCID pouch, places the pouch into the FilmArray Instrument, and starts the run
and the following processes occur automatically during the FilmArray run:
· Nucleic Acid Purification - Nucleic acid purification occurs in the first three blisters
of the pouch. The sample is lysed by agitation (bead beating) and the liberated nucleic
acid is captured, washed and eluted using magnetic bead technology. These steps
require about ten minutes.
· 1st Stage Multiplex PCR – After nucleic acid purification, the purified nucleic acid
solution is combined with a preheated master mix to initiate thermocycling for
multiplex PCR. During this stage, the FilmArray performs a single, large volume,
highly multiplexed PCR reaction which includes all primers of the outer primer sets.
9

--- Page 10 ---
The effect of 1st stage PCR is to enrich for the target nucleic acids present in the
sample.
· 2nd Stage PCR - The products of 1st stage PCR are diluted and mixed with fresh PCR
reagents containing a double stranded DNA binding dye (LCGreen® Plus, BioFire
Diagnostics, Inc.). This solution is distributed over the 2nd stage PCR array. The
individual wells of the array contain primers for different assays (each present in
triplicate) that target specific nucleic acid sequences from each of the pathogens
detected, as well as control template material. These primers are ‘nested’ or internal
to the specific products of the 1st stage multiplex reaction, which enhances both the
sensitivity and specificity of the reactions.
· DNA Melting Analysis – After 2nd stage PCR, the temperature is slowly increased
and fluorescence in each well of the array is monitored and analyzed to generate a
melt curve. The temperature at which a specific PCR product melts (melting
temperature or Tm) is consistent and predictable and the FilmArray Software
automatically evaluates the data from replicate wells for each assay to report results.
The FilmArray Software controls the operation of the instrument, collects and
analyzes data, and automatically generates a test report at the end of the run.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Reproducibility:
A multicenter reproducibility study was performed to determine between-site and
overall reproducibility of the BCID Panel. Reproducibility testing occurred at three
test sites using a panel of six simulated blood culture specimens, each spiked with
various combinations of two different organisms. Specimens were prepared in a
matrix of human whole blood and blood culture media. In total, 12 organisms were
evaluated to generate positive data for 17 of the possible 27 BCID Panel test results,
including antimicrobial resistance genes.
To best represent the composition of specimens likely to be tested by the BCID
Panel, half of the replicates were at a concentration consistent with the level of
organism in a blood culture bottle at the time of positivity, and half were at a
concentration similar to that observed in bottles eight hours after positivity. The
concentrations used were determined based on the results of the Growth and
Detection Studies (see below). Final organism dilutions were plated to confirm the
concentration of organism in each sample. A negative blood culture panel member
was also included in the study.
The study incorporated potential variances: seven different operators, three
10

--- Page 11 ---
different pouch lots, and 10 different FilmArray Instruments. Over the course of
four weeks, samples were tested on eight different days, for a total of 90 replicates
per analyte and per concentration.
Valid results were attained for 540 of 547 runs (98.7%). The seven remaining runs
included four runs with Instrument Communication Errors (4/547 = 0.73%) and
three runs with control failures (3/547 = 0.55%). Expected positive (Detected) test
results were obtained in all 540 completed test runs (1800/1800 = 100% agreement
with the expected result). Expected negative (Not Detected) or N/A results were
obtained in 539/540 pouch runs. Correct negative results were 12,776/12,780 or
99.97% agreement with the expected result. The four false positive results were
generated from a single pouch run that was determined to be due to a pouch failure.
A summary of results (percent agreement with the expected result) for each analyte
is provided in the following tables:

Internal Controls: The following internal controls are included in each FilmArray
BCID pouch:
· DNA Process Control: The DNA Process Control assay targets DNA from
the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The yeast is present in the pouch in a
freeze-dried form and is hydrated and introduced into the test when the
sample is loaded. The control material is carried through all stages of the
test process, including lysis, nucleic acid purification, 1st stage PCR,
dilution, 2nd stage PCR, and DNA melting. A positive control result
indicates that all steps carried out in the pouch were successful.
· PCR2 Control: The PCR2 Control assay detects a DNA target that is dried
into the wells of the array along with the corresponding primers. A positive
result indicates that the 2nd stage PCR was successful.

Both internal control assays must be positive for the test run to pass. When either
control fails, the Controls field of the test report will display "Failed" and all results
will be listed as Invalid. If the controls fail, the user is instructed to repeat the test
using a new pouch.
Recommended External Controls: External controls are not provided with the
BCID Panel, but are recommended in the package insert. Uninoculated blood
culture media can be used as an external negative control and previously
characterized positive samples or samples spiked with well characterized organisms
can be used as external positive controls. External controls should be used in
accordance with the appropriate accrediting organization requirements, as
applicable.
External Controls used in clinical studies:
External controls used in the clinical study consisted of six different organism
mixes spiked into a human blood and blood culture matrix. All BCID targets were
represented in at least one external control mix. Testing of positive external controls
was rotated, with one of the six controls tested each day.
Specimen Stability:
Testing with the FilmArray BCID Panel should be performed as soon as possible
after a blood culture specimen is signaled as positive by a continuous monitoring
instrument. As blood culture bottles are sometimes not removed from the
instrument immediately (e.g., when microbiology laboratories are closed at night),
testing of positive specimens is indicated up to eight hours after bottle ring. Testing
with BCID Panel is indicated for both time frames. A "Growth and Detection"
study (see below) was performed to validate the performance of the BCID Panel
when testing immediately after bottle positivity as compared to testing after
incubation for an additional eight hours.
d. Growth and Detection Study
A study was performed to establish the range of expected organism concentrations
in positive blood cultures. Testing with the BCID Panel is indicated immediately
after a blood culture specimen is indicated as positive for growth by a continuously
monitoring blood culture system and subsequent Gram stain or up to eight hours
after bottle positivity. This study included evaluated the FilmArray BCID Panel
using blood cultures at both time points. All organism growth and testing was
performed using seeded blood culture bottles (BACTEC™ Plus Aerobic/F
Medium) incubated in the BACTEC™ 9050 continuously monitoring blood culture
instrument. Each microorganism was mixed with human whole blood and seeded
directly into blood culture bottles for growth. At the time of positivity (and/or eight
hours after positivity), the blood culture was removed from the instrument for

determination of organism concentration (CFU/mL using a plate count procedure)
and FilmArray BCID testing. Three independent positive cultures (bottles) were
evaluated for each organism at each time point and FilmArray testing was
performed in triplicate for each bottle.
The following table summarizes the concentration of organism (CFU/mL)
determined for a representative panel of 30 isolates. The number and percent of
correct positive BCID Panel test results is provided for each isolate and overall (%
Detected). A correct result means that both the correct organism and antimicrobial
resistance gene (where applicable) were detected in the sample. The correct
organism and antimicrobial resistance gene results were reported for all 540
samples tested (540/540, 100%). In addition to the correct results, 5 false positive
results (Streptococcus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Haemophilus influenzae,
Neisseria meningitidis, and Candida krusei) were observed in a single run (1/540;
0.2%). The correct results were obtained when the sample was retested.

e. Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity):
The analytical reactivity of the FilmArray BCID Panel was evaluated with a
collection of 303 bacterial and yeast isolates that represent the diversity of the
FilmArray BCID Panel analytes, including antimicrobial resistance genes. Isolates
were selected to represent relevant species or serotypes and selection with specific
inclusion of more commonly encountered species and known human pathogens.
When possible, in silico analysis of sequence data was used to make predictions of
assay reactivity for less common species that were not tested but that may be
detected by the FilmArray BCID Panel.
Each isolate was initially tested in blood culture matrix at a concentration consistent
with the levels of organism enumerated from blood cultures at the time of positivity
(see Growth and Detection section above). If an isolate was not detected initially,
the sample was retested at 10-100 fold higher concentrations. If detected at the
higher concentration(s), the species/isolate is indicated as detected with reduced

a Detected at the initial test concentration of ~1x108 CFU/mL.
Based on results of inclusivity testing and in silico analysis of available sequences,
predictions of reactivity are provided in the table below for less common
Streptococcus species. Prediction of reactivity was based on the number and location
of mismatches between the target sequence and the assay primer(s). The analysis
predicts that many species may be detected at concentrations expected in positive
blood cultures (108-109 CFU/mL), and others (particularly Mutans group species)
will likely not be detected due to sequence mismatches with the assay primers.
Listed organisms were not tested by the FilmArray assay either in analytical or clinical
testing. Performance of the FilmArray BCID Panel for these organisms has not
been established.

a Detected at the initial test concentration of 5×107 CFU/mL for K. oxytoca isolates and 1×108 CFU/mL
for K. pneumoniae and S. marcescens isolates. Detected in a seeded blood culture tested within 1 hour of
positivity for Enterobacter spp. and E. coli.
b Enterobacteriaceae and corresponding species specific Detected results also reported.
c Other isolates which carry the KPC gene (i.e. Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and
Enterobacteriaceae other than those listed above) were not evaluated.
Isolates of KPC-carrying organisms other than those listed in the above table (e.g.,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii, Citrobacter spp., Salmonella
spp., Enterobacter spp. (other than E. cloacae)) were not evaluated in the inclusivity
or clinical studies. In silico analysis of available KPC sequences of these organisms
known to contain the KPC resistance marker demonstrated 100% homology with the
BCID primers. Therefore detection of the KPC gene is predicted but has not been
demonstrated for these organisms.
f. Analytical specificity (Exclusivity):
The potential for cross-reactivity between assays contained in the BCID Panel was
evaluated by testing blood culture samples with concentrations equal to or greater
than the level of organism estimated to be in a blood culture sample eight hours after
positivity (approximately 109-1010 CFU/mL for bacteria and 107-108 CFU/mL for
yeast), or the highest concentration possible based on the organism stock. Organisms
were tested as either seeded blood cultures or contrived specimens at known
concentrations. For blood culture samples, test organisms were seeded into blood
culture bottles and grown to positivity on a continuous monitoring blood culture
instrument. Bottles were removed from the instrument and tested with the BCID
Panel after eight hours of being called positive. Contrived samples were prepared by
spiking the organism into a simulated blood culture matrix (human whole blood in
blood culture medium), and incubated on the blood culture instrument for ~24 hours
to the final desired concentration. Target concentrations were confirmed by plating.
Frozen quantified stocks were used to test the following organisms at the highest
concentrations possible: Mycoplasma hominis (3.16×107 CFU/mL), Ureaplasma
urealyticum (1.57×106 CFU/mL), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (7.33×106 CFU/mL), and
Legionella pneumophilia (2.63×108 CFU/mL). In addition, extracted DNA was used for a
vancomycin-resistant E. faecium isolate carrying the vanM gene (5ng/mL; ~1×106
CFU/mL).
The selection of organisms focused on species that may be found in positive blood
cultures (clinically relevant) and/or those that are closely related to target organisms
(nearest neighbors). Organisms were also selected based on antimicrobial resistance
phenotypes and the presence or absence of the antimicrobial resistance genes
identified by the BCID Panel. The tested organisms were divided into two categories:

on-panel organisms and off-panel organisms. On-panel exclusivity testing included a
total of 141 isolates of gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and yeast
representing 29 genera and 98 individual species. Off-panel organisms were expected
to have negative test results for all of the assays on the FilmArray BCID Panel (or
positive organism results but negative results for the antimicrobial resistance genes
detected by the FilmArray BCID Panel). Off-panel testing included gram-positive
bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, yeast, viruses and Mycoplasmataceae.
The following tables present both on-panel and off-panel organisms that were tested
and yielded the expected negative FilmArray BCID Panel test results for all BCID
targets (other than the targets for which the on-panel organism were expected to be
positive).

g. Assay cut-off:
The BCID Melt Detector software determines whether a FilmArray BCID assay
result is positive or negative using a predefined algorithm that includes Tm values,
fluorescence values, and analysis of melting curves. For each BCID target sequence
there is a mean Tm at which PCR2 products from the most similar isolates will melt.
The range surrounding that mean is where amplicon from more diverse isolates are
expected to melt. The location and width of each Tm range is assay specific and is
used in the FA analysis software to ensure specificity in target detection. Due to the
number of species, rarity of some strains, and variability of strain sequences detected
by BCID assays, thousands of clinical samples would need to be tested from isolates
spanning geography and time in order to estimate the Tm ranges for each target
experimentally.
The Melt Detector software uses a mathematical model for Tm prediction that was
developed and verified using database sequences, beta site testing, analytical studies,
and reference runs. Melting ranges for all 31 pathogen, antibiotic resistance gene
targets, and control assays were initially determined and subsequently validated. The
validation of the BCID Melt Detector software was performed by comparing
FilmArray BCID test results obtained from well-characterized clinical and analytical
samples to expert annotation (review of melt curves and assay calls made by the
Biofire software team). For individual melt curves, the observed sensitivity and
specificity of the melt detector software as compared to expert annotation are greater
than 98.5% and 99.9%, respectively. For the Analysis Software, the observed
sensitivity and specificity as compared to expert annotation, of the assay calls are
greater than 97.0% and 99.85%, respectively. The validation results surpassed the
predefined acceptance criteria of >95% accuracy as compared to expert annotation.
h. Fresh versus Frozen Study:
In order to utilize frozen clinical blood culture samples in the evaluation of FilmArray
BCID Panel, an analytical study was conducted to demonstrate that preservation of
samples by freezing at ≤-70°C does not affect the accuracy of test results compared to
freshly collected or freshly prepared samples.
A total of 62 FilmArray runs were attempted in this evaluation of 60 frozen
specimens, 60 of which were completed. There was one run failure each for a
software error and an instrument communication error. Of the 60 completed runs, no
42

--- Page 43 ---
control failures occurred. Specimens had been stored at < 70°C for an average of 44
days before re-testing for this study. The median age was 47 days (Range: 9-83 days).
All of the analytes that were originally detected in the specimens when tested fresh
were also detected after storage at < 70°C. Further, no additional analytes were
detected in frozen specimens that had not been previously detected when they were
tested fresh.

An analysis of Cp and Tm values was conducted to compare the performance of the
BCID individual assays in the original, freshly tested specimens and the frozen
specimens. The difference in average and median Cp values between the samples when
tested fresh and frozen were typically within 2 cycles and the delta Cp were observed in
both directions (both earlier and later relative to fresh testing. The largest variations were
consistent with run-to-run variation in Cp values that were observed in the
Reproducibility Study when the same samples were tested multiple times over several
days. Similarly, the delta Tm values ranged from 0 to Tm 0.9ºC (median 0.4), which is
consistent with the variation of Tm values observed in the Reproducibility Study. Tm
changes were also observed in both directions.
i. Interference:
Substances that could be present in blood culture samples or introduced during
sample handling were evaluated for potential interference. Potentially interfering
substances were added to simulated positive blood culture samples which contained
simulated blood culture matrix (human whole blood that had been incubated in a
blood culture bottle) and one of six different organism mixes. Each organism mix
contained two live pathogens at a concentration equivalent to the level determined to
be present when a blood culture bottle is detected as positive by the blood culture
instrument as shown in the following table. Twelve targeted organisms and four
targeted resistance genes were evaluated.

produced the expected positive and negative results indicating that none of the
endogenous or exogenous test substances compete or interfere with obtaining accurate
test results with the FilmArray BCID system. In addition, there were no consistent
trends for either Cp or Tm values when comparing the presence and absence of each
endogenous or exogenous substance. In summary, study data suggests that higher than
expected levels of the all evaluated substances will not interfere with obtaining

accurate test results with the FilmArray BCID Panel.
j. Mixed Culture Study (Microbial interference):
A study was performed to evaluate whether the presence of high levels of organisms
will interfere with detection of representative organisms at "bottle ring" concentrations.
Three bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus mitis)
that can be detected by the FilmArray BCID Panel were tested at high levels. These
organisms were selected for their high prevalence in mixed blood culture specimens.
Five bacteria (Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium jeikeium, Bacillus cereus,
Micrococcus luteus, and Clostridium perfringens) that are not detected by assays in the
FilmArray BCID Panel, but that can be found in blood cultures as contaminants, were
also tested to determine if their presence interferes with the ability of the FilmArray
BCID Panel to detect organisms targeted by the BCID Panel.
Testing was performed by spiking a high concentration of each potentially interfering
bacteria (~1 x 1010 CFU/mL) into blood culture specimens that each contained 2 BCID
organisms (Mix 1-6 described above for interference testing) at "bottle ring"
concentrations. Study results demonstrated that high concentrations of the on-panel
BCID microorganisms spiked into blood culture samples produced positive results for
the relevant assays on the BCID Panel but did interfere with any expected results for
other analytes. High concentrations of off-panel BCID microorganisms also showed no
interference with the detection of any FilmArray BCID organism with no unexpected
false negative or false positive results observed.
k. Testing of Additional Blood Culture Bottle Types
Fourteen different bottle types from three different blood culture systems (BacT/Alert,
BACTEC and VersaTREK) were evaluated analytically with the FilmArray BCID
panel. Blood culture bottles/media were tested with the recommended ratio of blood to
media. The six organism mixes described above (see interference section) were
separately spiked into each bottle type with final concentrations tested at "bottle ring"
levels. Results were evaluated to determine if the bottle type provided the expected
positive results. A negative control (simulated blood culture matrix) was also tested for
each bottle type. The test results for the negative control (NC) and the positive mixes
(which give negative results for many organisms on the panel) were evaluated to
determine if the bottle type posed a risk of false positive test results due to presence of
non-viable organism or organism nucleic acids in the culture media. The 14 bottle
types listed in the table below were evaluated and study results demonstrated correct
positive and negative FilmArray BCID results with each bottle type.

False positive test results were observed during development and beta testing of the
FilmArray BCID panel when using BacT/ALERT FA FAN® Aerobic media. An
investigation determined that these bottle types contain nucleic acids and/or non-viable
organism that can be detected by FilmArray BCID Panel (multiple organisms could be
detected in different test runs and media lots). It was confirmed that the charcoal used
in FAN media can have a relatively high bio-burden; therefore false results could be
generated from the media itself. Because of the potential for false positive results
associated with charcoal-containing media, BacT/ALERT FAN media should not be
used with the FilmArray BCID Panel. This information is presented in the package
insert.
l. Carryover Study:
The potential for run-to-run carryover was evaluated by determining whether a high
positive sample tested in one pouch would cause false positive results in subsequently
tested pouches. Each high positive sample contained ~1010 CFU/mL of a unique on-
panel bacteria and each negative sample contained a unique off-panel organism or no
organism. For each set of samples the negative sample was loaded in the same
workspace, using the same Pouch Loading Station and tested directly after the high
positive sample using the same FilmArray instrument. No false positive results were
observed during consecutive testing of 10 high positive samples alternating with
negative samples, demonstrating that recommended sample handling and testing
practices are effective in preventing false positive results due to carryover or cross-
contamination between samples.

blood culture arm. In the prospective arm, 1635 prospectively-collected residual blood
culture samples (pediatric and adult) were initially included in the study. Only blood
cultures collected in BD BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F blood culture bottles were included in
the study. Sixty-seven (67) specimens were excluded from the study. The most common
reasons for exclusion were when specimens were >8 hours past positivity, incomplete
reference/comparator data were provided, or the specimen was from a subject who had a
previous specimen included in the study. In the seeded culture arm, analytes proven to be
of low prevalence in the prospective arm were evaluated by seeding previously
characterized isolates into blood culture bottles and incubating until positivity. A total of
716 seeded cultures were initiated for the study. Seeded specimens were also prepared in
BD BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F blood culture bottles. Seventy-seven (77) cultures were
excluded from the study. The most common reasons for exclusion were that the
specimens were >8 hours past positivity, the seeded culture was not called positive by the
automated blood culture system, or the culture was contaminated or inconsistent with the
intended seed organism. The final specimen set consisted of 2207 blood cultures (1568
prospective and 639 seeded). Specimens were tested by the FilmArray BCID Panel either
from freshly positive blood cultures or from frozen blood culture aliquots. The following
table provides a summary of demographic information for the 1568 specimens included
in the prospective arm of the study.

a Performance of FilmArray BCID detecting all organisms was compared to standard manual and automated
microbiological/biochemical identification methods. Additionally, isolates identified as being members of the A.
calcoaceticus-baumannii complex were subjected to 16S PCR and bi-directional sequencing to categorize the isolate
as being A. baumannii or non-A. baumannii for final comparison to the FilmArray BCID A. baumannii-specific
results. Positive results required a sequencing result of adequate quality to match sequences of A. baumannii or non-
A. baumannii organisms deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank database
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), with an acceptable E-value. This was required due to the inability of phenotypic
identification methods to adequately discriminate between members of the A. calcoaceticus-baumannii complex.
b Performance of FilmArray BCID detecting antimicrobial resistance genes (mecA, vanA/B, and KPC) was compared
to gene-specific PCR tests with bi-directional sequencing. The assays were designed to amplify different sequences
than those targeted by FilmArray BCID.
c Performance of FilmArray BCID as compared to phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for
informational purposes. The phenotypic methods were performed in accordance with current CLSI criteria.
A total of 2207 specimens were tested in the clinical evaluation, of which 99%
(2185/2207) were successful on the first test. Six (6) initial tests were incomplete due to
instrument/software errors (5 tests) or a user aborted run (1 test). Sixteen (16) of the
completed runs were invalid due to a pouch control failure. Valid results were achieved
after a single retest for the 22 incomplete/invalid specimens, resulting in a final
successful testing rate of 100%.
Clinical sensitivity or positive percent agreement (PPA) was calculated as 100% x
(TP/TP + FN). True positive (TP) indicates that both FilmArray BCID and the
reference/comparator method had a positive result for a specific analyte, and false
negative (FN) indicates that the FilmArray BCID result was negative while the
reference/comparator method was positive. Clinical specificity or negative percent
agreement (NPA) was calculated as 100% x (TN/TN + FP). True negative (TN) indicates
that both FilmArray BCID and the reference/comparator method had a negative result for
a specific analyte, and false positive (FP) indicates that the FilmArray BCID result was
positive while the reference/comparator method was negative. The exact binomial two-

epidermidis; they were not S. aureus. Bidirectional sequencing confirmed the presence of S. aureus in 1/4 false
positive specimens. One false positive and one false negative S. aureus were consecutively tested specimens and may
be due to sample mix-up.

a Sensitivity and Specificity refer to performance with the prospective specimens only; Positive Percent Agreement
(PPA) and Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) refer to performance with the seeded specimens.
b Bidirectional sequencing identified isolates from 4 false positive specimens as A. pittii (genomospecies 3); this
species cross-reacts with the A. baumannii assay. These four isolates were identified as A. baumannii by phenotypic
methods. 6 other isolates originally identified as A. baumannii by phenotypic methods were identified by
bidirectional sequencing as A. nosocomialis (genomospecies 13; 4 isolates), A. bereziniae, and A. radioresistens;
these 6 isolates did not cross-react with the A. baumannii assay.
c One false positive and one false negative Enterobacteriaceae were consecutively tested specimens and may be due
to sample mix-up. One isolate from another false negative specimen, identified as E. coli by phenotypic methods,
was identified as Pasteurella, and not E. coli, by bidirectional sequencing.
d One false positive and one false negative E. coli were consecutively tested specimens and may be due to sample
mix-up.
e Bidirectional sequencing identified 4/5 isolates from false negative K. oxytoca specimens as the closely related
species, Raoultella ornithinolytica, and not K. oxytoca. The misidentification is a known limitation of phenotypic
testing methods for this species.
f The isolate from one false negative K. pneumoniae specimen was identified as the closely related organism,
Raoultella planticola and not K. pneumoniae. 6/9 false positive K. pneumoniae results appear to be due to cross-
reactivity with Enterobacter aerogenes and Raoultella ornithinolytica (misidentified as K. oxytoca by phenotypic
methods).
g Bidirectional sequencing identified the isolate from the one false negative S. marcescens specimen as being in the
S. proteomaculans/grimesii group and not S. marcescens. The one false positive S. marcescens result appears to be
due to cross-reactivity with Raoultella ornithinolytica (misidentified as K. oxytoca by phenotypic methods).
h Bidirectional sequencing identified the isolate from the one false negative P. aeruginosa specimen as the closely
related species Pseudomonas stutzeri and not P. aeruginosa.

b Bidirectional sequencing identified the isolates from the two false negative C. parapsilosis specimens as being the
closely related species C. metapsilosis. This misidentification is a known limitation of phenotypic identification
methods.
Comparator testing for the antimicrobial resistance genes was performed with both the
blood culture sample and with isolates recovered after subculture of the blood culture
media. The results are presented in the tables below. The NPA for mecA and vanA/B are
lower when comparing to PCR/sequencing from bacterial isolates than to
PCR/sequencing directly from blood culture primarily due to the reference culture
methods not isolating a resistant clone of an applicable organism. This may be due to
heterogeneous resistance within a population of cultured organisms or co-culturing of
multiple indistinguishable applicable organisms with different resistance profiles (e.g.,
mixed culture of a resistant Staphylococcus with sensitive Staphylococcus).

a Isolates for 12 Staphylococci, 4 Enterococci, and 7 Enterobacteriaceae/A. baumannii/P. aeruginosa did not grow
from the subcultured blood culture and could therefore not be tested with the PCR/bi-directional sequencing
comparator method. These blood cultures were considered negative for the antimicrobial resistance genes by
comparator method, and FilmArray performance has been calculated as True Negative (when FilmArray is negative
for the analyte) or False Positive (when FilmArray is positive for the analyte) for each of these isolates.
The performance of FilmArray BCID panel as compared to phenotypic antimicrobial
susceptibility testing (AST) results was calculated for informational purposes. Results
stratified by AST method are presented in the following three tables. Positive percent
agreement is sometimes lower when comparing results from bacterial isolates than when
comparing to PCR/sequencing directly from blood culture because phenotypic AST
testing is capable of detecting antimicrobial resistance due to mechanisms other than
acquisition of mecA, vanA/B, or KPC. AST results were not provided for all isolates.

KPC Performance – Comparison to Phenotypic Carbapenem AST Methods.
· AST results were not provided for several isolates.
· Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are commonly resistant to
carbapenems due to mechanisms other than acquisition of the KPC gene (bla ). These
KPC
bacteria very rarely carry the KPC gene.

FilmArray BCID reported a total of 81 prospective specimens with discernible multiple
organism detections (5.2% of all prospective specimens; 81/1568). The majority of
multiple detections (74/81; 91.3%) contained two discernible organisms, while 6.2%
(5/81) contained three discernible organisms, and 2.5% (2/81) contained four discernible
organisms. The most prevalent multiple detection was Enterococcus with Staphylococcus
(S. aureus not detected) (1.3% of all specimens; 20/1568). Out of the 81 polymicrobial
specimens, 29 contained one or more analytes that had not been detected with the
reference/comparator methods, i.e., discrepant result/false positive by FilmArray BCID.

The reference method detected 201 off-panel organism isolates (i.e., those not
targeted by FilmArray BCID) from the 1568 prospective cultures. The majority of
these isolates belong to groups of organisms commonly considered to be blood culture
contaminants (49 Corynebacterium/Diphtheroids, 33 Bacillus sp., and 27
Micrococcus sp., among others). Occurrence of off-panel organisms in the
prospective arm of the clinical evaluation is presented in the following table.

External Control testing in the Clinical Study:
Six frozen (-70°C) control mixes were provided to the study sites for daily testing. Five
control mixes consisted of pooled blood and blood culture media containing whole
bacteria/yeast at levels expected at culture positivity (bacteria at approximately 108
CFU/mL and yeast at approximately 106CFU/mL). Combined, the five mixes covered all
panel analytes. A sixth mix was negative for all panel members and only contained
pooled blood and blood culture media. The operators were required to complete a valid
control mix run with correct results obtained on each day of fresh specimen testing. A
total of 403 control mix runs were attempted; two runs did not complete and two runs had
failed internal control(s). Of the remaining 399 control runs, 396 (99.2%) were successful
while 3 (0.8%) did not return the correct organism results either due to the detection of an
extra analyte and/or the failure to detect one or more analytes. For each day that a control
run was invalid or produced incorrect results, another control run was performed and
valid results were required prior to testing any study specimens.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
In the prospective arm of the FilmArray BCID clinical study, 1568 eligible blood cultures
