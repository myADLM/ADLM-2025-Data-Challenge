L. Test Principle:
The XL-200 Glucose (Hexokinase) method is based on a modification of Slein, using
Hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase to catalyze the reaction. Glucose is
phosphorylated with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the reaction catalyzed by Hexokinase
(HK). The product, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) is then oxidized with the concomitant
reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH in the reaction catalyzed by

glucose-6-phosphatedehygrogenase (G6PDH). The formation of NADH caused an increasing
in absorbance at 340nm. The increase is proportional to the amount of glucose in the sample.
The ISE method uses ion selective principles to measure the sodium, potassium, and
chloride. The ISE module measures the potentials developed when the sample is positioned
in the electrodes. Next, Calibrant A is positioned in the electrodes. The difference in the two
potentials is related logarithmically to the concentration of the measured ions in the sample
divided by their respective concentrations in the Calibrant solution.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed according to CLSI document EP5-A2, Evaluation
of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved
Guideline. Three levels of JAS serum based controls were tested on the XL-200
Clinical Chemistry Analyzer for each analyte in one run of 20 replicates to obtain the
within run precision (N=20). Three levels of JAS serum based controls were tested in
duplicate twice per day for 20 days to obtain the total precision (N=80). Results are
summarized in the tables below:

commercially available ready to use multilevel linearity standard materials. Nine
levels of linearity standards were analyzed in duplicate. The observed values were
compared to the expected values and the results of linear regression are summarized
in the table below:
Claimed Sample Range

reference material which is traceable to NIST standards. The glucose calibrator
material (JAS multi analyte Calibrator) was previously cleared under k020454. The
ISE calibrator material for sodium, potassium and chloride (Calibrant A and B) was
previously cleared under k070057.

The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined to be 1.0 mg/dL using low analyte

Analyte Claimed Measuring Range
Sodium 100 – 200 mmol/L
Potassium 1.0 - 10.0 mmol/L

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed according to CLSI EP-7A (Interference testing in
Clinical Chemistry) to determine the effects from potential interferents on the JAS Glucose
and the ISE assays. Various concentrations of interferents were spiked into two levels,
(normal and abnormal concentrations) of each analyte. Testing was performed in duplicate
using 2 lots of reagent on the XL-200 Clinical Chemistry Analyzer. Nine levels of each
interferent were tested for each analyte. The sponsor states that interference is considered to
be non-significant if the bias between the tested and control samples are within +/-10%.
The highest concentration tested that shows non-significant interference are summarized
below:
Reagent Hemoglobin Lipemia Bilirubin Ascorbic Acid
Glucose 400 mg/dL 412 mg/dL 21.4 mg/dL 10.0 mg/dL
Sodium * 1084 mg/dL 22.5 mg/dL testing not performed
Potassium * 1084 mg/dL 22.5 mg/dL testing not performed
Chloride * 1084 mg/dL 22.5 mg/dL testing not performed
*Do not use hemolyzed samples
The labeling for the ISE Reagent Pack includes the statement: Hemolyzed samples should not
be used with sodium, potassium and chloride assays. The sponsor also references
Young, D.S. et al, Clin. Chem 21: ID (1975) for drugs and substances that may affect the
accuracy of these methods.

N. Instrument Name:
XL-200 Clinical Chemistry Analyzer
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Automated random access analyzer with optional ISE Module
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Barcode identification is available for specimen tubes and reagent bottles. Manual entry
is used to identify specimen cups.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Samples are manually placed on the instrument either by sample tube or sample cup. The
system can run an individual sample or a batch of samples. Once the samples are tested
they can be manually removed.
5. Calibration:
Glucose calibration frequency should be 14 days or with a change of reagent lot or as
indicated by quality control procedures. The recommended calibrator for glucose is the
JAS multi-analyte Calibrator previously cleared in k020454.
It is mandatory to perform calibration (two points) before ISE measurement at the
beginning of the day or if the power switch of analyzer is turned off, eight hours have
passed since the last ISE calibration, environmental temperature has changed more than 4
degree C since the last ISE calibration or more than 50 samples are processed after ISE
calibration in the morning. The ISE calibrator material for sodium, potassium and
chloride (Calibrant A and B) was previously cleared under k070057.
6. Quality Control:
The analyzer has a built in quality control program. The labeling recommends the use of
two external quality control materials to be assayed according to government guidelines.
The two external quality control materials recommended for both glucose and ISE are the
JAS Chemistry Controls previously cleared in k042318.
