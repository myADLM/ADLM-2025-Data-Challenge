L. Test Principle:
The test is performed on stool samples, collected without preservatives. The samples should
be tested within 4 days, or frozen at -20° C if not immediately tested. An extract is prepared
by combining the stool sample with extraction buffer at a ratio of 1:50 (e.g., 0.1 gm of stool
added with 4.9 mL of extraction buffer) and mixing for 30 minutes. Following
centrifugation, 20μL of the supernatant is diluted 1:50 with dilution buffer (final dilution
1:2500).
Calprest® is a colorimetric enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The assay uses a
polyclonal rabbit antibody against calprotectin as the capture antibody. Calprotectin present
in the diluted sample is bound by the antibody adsorbed onto the surface of the microtiter
plate. Alkaline phosphatase conjugated antibodies (rabbit IgG antibodies) bind to the
captured calprotectin. The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of the substrate to a colored
product and the optical density (OD) of the sample is read on an ELISA plate reader. The
intensity of the color is proportional to the amount of conjugate bound, and thus to the
amount of captured calprotectin. The concentration of calprotectin in the extracted sample is

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Intra-assay precision was conducted by extracting 8 different stool samples. Each
extract sample was tested with 10 replicates in a single assay run. The mean,
standard deviation (SD) and the coefficient of variation (CV) were calculated. The
results met the acceptance criteria with the %CV of each sample <15%.

% CV 7.7 12.1 12.4 12.4 3.3 7.8 5.0 3.7
Inter-assay precision was conducted by extracting 8 different stool samples. Each
extract was tested using one lot of the test kit with 5 replicates per run, 1 run per day
for 6 days with 2 operators. The mean, standard deviation (SD) and the coefficient of
variation (CV) were calculated. The results met the acceptance criteria with %CV of
each sample <15%.

% CV 7.7 8.5 9.6 8.0 9.6 9.3 8.2 12.4
Lot-to-lot reproducibility was done by extracting six different stool samples. Each
sample was tested in 5 replicates using 3 different lots of the test kit. The results are
shown in the following table.
#1 #2 #3 #4 #5 #6
Mean (mg/kg) 107.7 63.1 185.1 43.8 36.0 344.9

% CV 5.4 5.8 7.9 3.1 8.3 12.4
Extraction reproducibility was evaluated by using 3 stool samples with calprotectin
concentrations of 28.4, 41.1 and 79.4 mg/kg. Each stool sample was extracted 10
times and each stool extract was tested in duplicate. The %CVs for the 3 stool
samples are 13.6%, 8.9% and 7.0%.

Linearity: The reportable range of the Calprest® was evaluated with both aqueous
and matrix linearity. For the matrix linearity study, serially diluted samples with
calprotectin concentrations ranging from 20.4 to 492.8 mg/kg were prepared by
diluting the high positive extracted stool sample pool in the low concentration
extracted stool sample pool. Each dilution was tested in triplicate. The percent (%)
recovery ranged from 87.0% to 113.2% for tested samples. The linear regression
analysis gives the following equation:
y=1.013x – 3.777, R2= 0.999
For the aqueous linearity study, samples were prepared by diluting the calprotectin
reference materials with sample diluent to generate 7 dilutions with concentrations
ranging from 8.6 mg/kg to 550 mg/kg. Each dilution was tested in triplicate. The %
recovery for samples ranged from 95.2% to 109.3%. The linear regression analysis
gives the following equation:
y=0.985x + 2.714, R2= 0.999
The assay was shown to give a linear response over the claimed reportable range
(15.6 – 500 mg/kg).
Accuracy/Recovery study: Extracts from 7 stool samples were each spiked with the
kit calibrator material (S3) that has a calprotectin concentration target of 25 ng/mL.
The baseline extract for each sample was “spiked” with sample diluent to compensate
for volume adjustments made to the calprotectin-spiked extracts. Each of the spiked
extracts was then assayed in triplicate and results are shown in table below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: There is no international reference material for calprotectin. The
calibrators and controls are manufactured using an approved reference lot which is
traceable to the internal reference material cleared in k050007.
The calibrator S6, prepared from the master stock solution, was used to make the
calibrators and controls. New lots of the calibrator set and controls were value
assigned and validated by a comparison against an approved lot of calibrators and
controls in three different assay runs and further testing with a panel of 12 internal
quality control samples. The target values for calibrators are 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100
and 200 ng/mL, and the target values for controls range from 20 to 40 ng/mL for the

Low Control and 40 to 80 ng/mL for the High Control.
Stability:
Kit stability: The real time stability was performed using three lots of Calprest® kits
(including calibrators and controls) stored under the recommended temperature at 2 –
8°C. Data were collected at point 0, 6, 12, 18 and 19 months. The results support
stability of the kits under the recommended storage of 2 – 8°C for up to 18 months.
Open vial stability: The study was done to evaluate the reagent stability after
opening. Three kit lots of Calprest® were stored at 2 – 8°C after first opening. Data
were collected at 0, 30 and 60 days. The results support that the reagents are stable
once opened for up to 30 days when stored at 2 – 8°C.
Working solutions stability: The study was done to evaluate the stability of working
solutions including dilution buffer, washing buffer and extraction solution. The 1X
working solution for each buffer was prepared and stored at 2 – 8°C. Data were
collected at different time points. The results support up to 30 days stability for 1X
dilution buffer and extraction buffer and 3 months stability for 1X washing buffer.
Sample stability: Five (5) stool samples which cover the measuring range of
Calprest® were stored at 2-8°C for 2, 4, and 7 days. The acceptance criteria for %
recovery of calprotectin in the samples tested at each time point should be within
±5% of the initial reading taken at day 0. The results support that stability of stool
sample stored at 2-8°C up to 4 days.
Analyte (Calprotectin) stability: The study was done to determine the stability of
extracted stool samples when stored -20°C. A total of 10 stool samples (1 with
concentration above 100 mg/kg, 2 around 100 mg/kg, 5 around 50 mg/kg, and 2
around 20 mg/kg) were tested. Data were collected at time 0 and 3 months. The
acceptance criteria for %recovery of calprotectin at 3 months should be within ±15%
of the initial reading. All samples met the acceptance criteria.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB) was determined by assaying 5 blank samples 12 times. The
LoB value was estimated to be 3.04 mg/kg. The limit of detection (LoD) was
determined by assaying 5 extracted stool samples with low calprotectin level 12
times. The LoD value was calculated as the LoB + 1.645 x SD of the replicates for
the low level samples and was found to be 3.98 mg/kg.
The lower limit of the reportable assay range for Calprest® is 15.6 mg/kg which
corresponds to the lowest calibrator with a concentration of 6.25 ng/mL after
conversion to mg of calprotectin per kg stool sample according to the assay’s
instructions for use.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed according to EP7-A2 using 5 pooled stool
samples, each containing a mixture of 3 different stool samples. The pooled samples
included 2 high positives (with calprotectin concentrations around 460 mg/kg and 270
mg/kg), 1 low positive (145 mg/kg), 1 sample within borderline range (68 mg/kg) and
1 negative (30 mg/kg). For non-interference to be claimed, the % recovery of the
spiked sample should be within 95-105% of the neat sample. Stool samples were
tested for potential interference by:
Microorganisms: The data demonstrated that Calprest® was not affected by
Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., and Yersinia
spp. (at cell count of 1.5x107 cfu/ml) in stool samples.
Drug and Nutrients: The data demonstrated that Calprest® was not affected by the
following oral pharmaceuticals and nutritional supplements: Vancomycin (0.67
mg/50 mg stool); Ciprofloxacin HCL (0.50 mg/50 mg stool); Prevacid (0.02 mg/50
mg stool); Azathioprine (0.07 mg/50 mg stool); Prednisone (0.01 mg/50 mg stool);
Pentasa (1.33 mg/50 mg stool); Asacol (1.33 mg/50 mg stool); multiple vitamin (Vit
D: 1.1 UI/50 mg stool, Vit A: 8.0 UI/50 mg stool), Vit C: 0.05 mg/50 mg stool) and
Vitamin E (0.10 mg/50 mg stool).
Hemoglobin: The results showed that the addition of hemoglobin into the stool
samples at level of 5.83 mg/50 mg stool did not interfere with Calprest®.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected value in the normal healthy population is generally <50 mg/kg according to
study done by Røseth et al. (1992)*.
Ninety (90) samples from normal healthy people and 42 samples from patients with CD,
UC, IBS, and IC were tested with Calprest® to validate the reference range value. The
results showed that 85 out of 90 samples (92.2%) from normal healthy people tested
negative and the remaining 5 samples fell in the range of 51.8 – 60.4 mg/kg. Of the 42
samples from patients with CD, UC, IBS and IC, 36 (85.7%) tested positive by the assay.
