L. Test Principle:
The method for the quantitative determination of hCG is a sandwich chemiluminescence
immunoassay. A specific mouse monoclonal antibody is coated on the magnetic particles
(solid phase); another monoclonal antibody is linked to an isoluminol derivative (isoluminol-
antibody conjugate). All assay steps and incubations are performed by the LIAISON® XL
Analyzer.
During the first incubation, hCG present in calibrators, samples or controls binds to the solid
phase monoclonal antibody. After a washing step in the second incubation, the antibody
conjugate reacts with hCG already bound to the solid phase. The starter reagents are then
added subsequently and a flash chemiluminescence reaction is thus induced. The light signal,
and hence the amount of isoluminol-antibody conjugate, is measured by a photomultiplier as
relative light units (RLU, relative light units) and is directly related to hCG concentration
present in calibrators, samples or controls.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Following CLSI document EP5-A2, the sponsor evaluated precision using 3
commercial controls and 6 frozen serum samples with concentrations spanning the
measuring range of the assay. The samples were tested using two reagent lots, in two
replicates per run, 2 runs per day for 20 days (N=160 measurements per sample). Results
of between lot and total precision are summarized in the table below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity:
The sponsor performed linearity studies in accordance with CLSI EP6-A guidelines
using two high sample pools which were diluted to span the measuring range of the
assay. A total of 10 or 11 samples for each linearity sample set were tested in
duplicates on the LIAISON® XL analyzer. Samples tested ranged from 0.44 to
10379.0 mIU/mL. The observed values were plotted against the expected values and
linear regression analysis was performed. Both sample sets yielded similar linear

The data support the claimed measuring range of this device, 1.5 to 10,000
mIU/mL for serum samples.
Recovery:
The sponsor conducted a recovery study using five levels of spiked samples, which
were prepared by adding the targeting amount of WHO 3rd reference standard into
five human sera and tested in duplicates using one lot of reagents on one instrument.
The overall % recovery for each spiked level was determined and evaluated for
acceptance. The results are tabulated below. Additional recovery information at low
levels is shown in the LoQ study (see below).
Spiked level (mIU/mL) Overall %recovery
5 91.8
25 105.9
500 94.9
5000 92.9
9000 96.9
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The LIAISON® XL HCG Calibrators 1 and 2 are traceable to the WHO hCG 3rd
International Standard.
Value assignment:
Concentrations of kit calibrators are assigned through an internal procedure. Master
standards consisting of 12 different concentrations spanning the complete assay range
are prepared from a stock material of human hCG purchased from a commercial
source. The concentrations of master standards were assigned through parallel testing
with WHO 3rd reference standard. The master standards are then used to assign values
to the kit calibrators over several runs and the mean results are used to determine the
target values. The protocols for value assignment and acceptance criteria were
reviewed and found to be adequate.
Kit Calibrators have the following target values:
Level 1: 13.0 – 19.0 mIU/mL
Level 2: 3000.0 – 4000.0 mIU/mL
Stability:
Shelf life and open vial stability of the reagent kit (including calibrators) were performed
by the sponsor. Reagent kits are stable until the expiration date shown on the product
labeling when stored as instructed. Open reagent vials are stable for 4 weeks when
stored on board or at 2-8°C. The protocols for stability and acceptance criteria were

reviewed and found to be adequate.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation
(LoQ) were determined in accordance with CLSI document EP17-A2. LoB study
was performed by measuring 60 replicates of one blank sample on 2 analyzers with 2
reagent lots per analyzer. LoB was calculated to be 0.17 mIU/mL. LoD study was
performed by measuring 4 low concentration serum samples in the range of LoB to
4xLoB values, tested on 2 analyzers over 3 days with 2 reagent lots. LoD was
calculated to be 0.36 mIU/mL. LoQ study was performed by spiking six negative
samples with the WHO 3rd reference standard which were then tested over three days
using three reagent lots. The sponsor claimed that the LoQ is 1.5mIU/mL, and
demonstrated that the % bias is 15.5% and %CV is 12.3% at LoQ level.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference:
Following CLSI guidance document EP7-A2, interference studies were performed by
spiking common potential interfering substances into two serum samples pools that
contain 5-9 mIU/mL and 45-64 mIU/mL hCG, respectively. The reference sample
(control) without interferent was spiked with the respective amount of solvent. The
matched spiked and control samples containing each interferent were tested on the
LIAISON® XL HCG assay using 7 replicates with 1 reagent lot. The sponsor defines
non-significant interference as bias within 10% between the spiked and the control
samples. Results of non- significant interference are summarized in the table below:

Hook effect:
The possible high dose hook effect was evaluated using sample spiked with hCG
antigen up to 14,500,000 mIU/mL. This spiked sample was then serially diluted and
measured in triplicates. No evidence of high dose hook effect was observed in the study
for hCG concentration up to 14,500,000 mIU/mL.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Following the CLSI EP9-A2 guidance document, the sponsor performed a method
comparison study of the LIAISON® XL HCG assay versus the predicate device. A
total of 172 serum samples were compared across methods, of which 163 samples
were in the measuring range (from 1.6 mIU/mL to 8460 mIU/mL on the LIAISON®
XL HCG assay). Singlicate results from the candidate device and mean of
duplicate results from the predicate device were used for the linear regression
analysis. Weighted Deming regression analysis resulted the following:
Y = 0.973X – 0.223; R2 = 0.993.
(Candidate Device) (Predicate)
A bias analysis of candidate device vs. predicate performed on the 163 samples
exhibited an average bias of 2.7% (95% CI: 1.1 to 4.3%).

olds), 97.5% of the values obtained were below 1.54 mIU/mL hCG.
In a study performed on 70 healthy, postmenopausal women (≥ 50-year olds), 97.5% of
the values obtained were below 6.67 mIU/mL hCG.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
