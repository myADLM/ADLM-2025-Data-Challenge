L. Test Principle:
Total Protein: Proteins in samples react with the biuret reagent to form a purple-red
complex. The concentration of total protein can be determined by measuring the absorbance
of the purple-red substance.
Albumin: Albumin combines with bromcresol green to form a blue-green dye conjugate.
The albumin concentration can be determined by measuring the absorbance of this resulting
blue-green color.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies for the S TEST Reagent Cartridge TP and ALB were performed
following CLSI EP5-A2 with three levels of analytes (low, middle and high) and one
instrument. Serum samples were tested in duplicate, twice a day, for 20 days for a
total of 80 results per level. The samples were serum based commercial controls
(levels 1, 2 and 3). Results for total protein and albumin precision are summarized
below:

concentrations of the analytes. Each sample was assayed six times per day for 5 days
resulting in 30 results per level. The results are listed below:

0.1g/dL. The summary of the linear regression analysis of the data is below:
y=0.9911x+0.0508; R2=0.9994
The linearity studies for Albumin support the sponsor’s claimed measuring range of
0.5 g/dL to 7.1 g/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
S TEST Reagent Cartridge Total Protein (TP) is calibrated by the manufacturer prior
to shipment using material traceable to NIST SRM 927. The barcode printed on each
cartridge provides the analyzer with lot-specific calibration data. TP concentration is
directly determined by multiplying the change in absorbance of the unknown samples
by the calibrator factor on the barcode. No calibration is needed by the user.
Each lot of the S TEST Reagent Cartridge Albumin (ALB) cartridges is calibrated by
the manufacturer prior to shipment using material traceable to IRMM Standard
Reference Material CRM470. The barcode printed on each cartridge provides the
analyzer with lot-specific calibration data. ALB concentration is directly determined
by multiplying the change in absorbance of the unknown samples by the calibrator
factor on the barcode. No calibration is needed by the user.
Commercially available controls are required and users should follow Federal,
state, and local requirements.
Stability
Real-time shelf life stability studies for the TP reagent cartridge are ongoing. The
sponsor states that the TP test cartridge will be launched with 12 month stability.
The protocols for stability and acceptance criteria were reviewed and are acceptable.
Real-time shelf-life studies for the Albumin reagent cartridge were performed. A
two-level control set was tested in replicates of five with three lots of cartridges
across six analyzers. The protocols for stability and acceptance criteria were
reviewed and are acceptable and support a stability of at least 12 months when
stored at 2-8°C.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) studies for the S TEST Reagent
Cartridge TP and Reagent Cartridge ALB were performed in accordance to CLSI
EP17-A. The analytical sensitivity was defined as the limit of detection, and the LoD
was calculated from the LoB. LoB was determined using a blank sample assayed 20
times per day for three days for a total of 60 replicates. The LoB was estimated as the
6

--- Page 7 ---
mean of the 57th and 58th highest values for the true blanks. LoD was determined
using five low samples assayed four times per day for three days, for a total of 60
replicate results. The LoD was calculated as the LoB + 1.645 x SD of the low
samples.
LoQ for the S TEST Reagent Cartridge TP and ALB was assessed by preparing
several low samples to cover the lower limit of the analyte range. Each sample was
assayed in replicates of six. The mean, standard deviation and percent coefficient of
variation were calculated for the six replicates at each sample and a plot (expected
values (X) against %CV (Y)) was generated. LoQ was defined at the value of sample
where the interassay precision is <20% CV.
The LoB, LoD and LoQ for Total Protein and Albumin are tabulated below:
Analyte LoB (g/dL) LoD (g/dL) LoQ (g/dL)
Total Protein (TP) 0.07 0.2 0.2
Albumin (ALB) 0.02 0.09 0.1
The sponsor’s claimed measuring range of Total protein is 0.2 to 11.0 g/dL and
Albumin is 0.5 g/dL to 7.1 g/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP7-A. Two levels of
commercial control sera containing approximately 4g/dL and 6.5g/dL total protein
and 2.5g/dL and 4.0g/dL albumin were spiked to six levels with each interferent
(ascorbic acid, unconjugated bilirubin, hemoglobin and lipids) and all seven samples
were tested in replicates of three by the Hitachi Clinical Analyzer E40. The spiked
sample results mean was compared to its neat control mean result and recoveries were
calculated. The sponsor defines non-interference as the mean results from the testing
of the spiked samples within 10% of the mean of the neat samples. Recoveries were
between 90% and 110% of the neat value. The highest level tested with non
significant interference is listed below.
Total Protein (TP) Albumin (ALB)
Substance Highest level tested with no Highest level tested with no
interference interference
Ascorbic acid 50mg/dL 50mg/dL
Bilirubin (unconjugated) 50mg/dL 12.5mg/dL
Hemoglobin 1000mg/dL 250mg/dL
Lipids (Intralipid) 500mg/dL 500mg/dL
The sponsor states that hemolyzed specimens should not be used for albumin in the
labeling.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 115 (for total protein) and 118 (for albumin) clinical specimens, spanning
the dynamic range were assayed in singleton and blinded using the Hitachi system
