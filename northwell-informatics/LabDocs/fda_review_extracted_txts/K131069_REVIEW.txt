H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
QuickScreen™ Amphetamine 500 Test Model 9058 (dip card)
The QuickScreen Amphetamine 500 Test Model 9058 is a qualitative in-vitro diagnostic
screen that provides a preliminary result for the detection/presence of Amphetamine in
urine. The cut-off concentration is 500 ng/ml. It is intended for prescription point of care
use only.
This test provides only a preliminary test result. A more specific alternate testing method
must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Other confirmation
methods are available. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be
applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are
observed.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The QuickScreen test devices are chromatographic absorbent devices in which drug or drug
metabolite(s) in an urine sample compete with a drug-antigen conjugate, immobilized on a
porous support membrane. When an urine sample is applied to the test device, if drug is
present in the sample at a concentration less than the stated cut-off, it will not block the
binding sites of the immobilized drug-antigen conjugate in the test region and the antibody-
dye conjugate will migrate to the test region with the urine. As a result, a visible rose pink
band will form in the test region, indicating a negative result. Conversely, where drug
concentrations are equal to or greater than the stated cut-off, the antibody - dye conjugate
binds to the free drug, forming a complex which competes with immobilized drug-antigen
conjugate in the test region. This prevents the development of a rose pink band, indicating a
positive sample.
To serve as a procedural control, a colored band will always appear in the control region
regardless of the presence of drug(s) in the test sample. This verifies the device is functioning
correctly.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Performance testing was conducted on the amphetamine test strip only due to the change in
cutoff for this drug analyte. The other drug analyte test strips in the QuickScreen Multi Drug
Screening Test and QuickScreen Drug Cup have not been modified and were previously
cleared (k103295).
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed using drug-free urine spiked to the following
concentrations: cutoff, +/-25%, +/-50%, +/-75% and 100% of the cutoff. Also,
negative urine was tested. For each device, sixty urine samples were assayed for each
test concentration. The samples were aliquotted, randomized, and blinded prior to
testing. Testing was performed at 3 point-of-care sites by 2 operators/site with each
testing the 4 device formats (dipcard multi 9346T, cup 9346Z, cassette 9054, dipcard
single 9058). Testing was performed once a day for 20 days. Results are shown in the
tables below:

Evaluation of Specific Gravity and pH on test results:
To evaluate the effect of pH value on the test results, urine controls at +/-25% and +/-
50% of the cutoff value were used. Testing was conducted on 3 devices (dipcard-
multi 9346T, cup 9346Z, cassette 9054 ). The pH levels tested were 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5,
and 8.5. Each test sample was tested in triplicate.
To evaluate the effect of specific gravity, urine controls at +/-25% and +/-50% of the
cut-off values had specific gravities of 1.002, 1.010, 1.015, 1.020, 1.025, and 1.030,
1.040. Testing was performed with 3 devices (dipcard- multi 9346T, cup 9346Z, and
cassette 9054). Each test sample was tested in triplicate.
The testing results demonstrate that varying pH’s and specific gravities do not affect
urine testing results around each analyte cut-off.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off characterization study results can be found in the precision section of this
summary. See section M.1.a.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Testing was performed at 3 point-of-care site. All four device formats (dipcard-multi
9346T, cup 9346Z, cassette 9054, dipcard-single 9058) were individually tested over
a period of several days by 3 operators. Operators tested 106 (64 negative and 42
positive) unaltered clinical samples. The samples were blind labeled and randomized
to each individual device prior to testing, such that operators tested both the samples
and devices in a randomized fashion. The results were compared to GC/MS and are
presented in the table below:
