H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
One Step Single/Multi-drug Test Cup and One Step Single/Multi-drug Test
Dipcard are lateral flow chromatographic immunoassays designed to qualitatively
detect the presence of drugs and drug metabolites in human urine at or above the
following cut-off concentrations:
Test Calibrator Cut-off level
Marijuana (THC) Delta-9-THC-COOH 50 ng/mL
Cocaine (COC) Benzoylecgonine 300 ng/mL
Amphetamine (AMP) D-Amphetamine 1000 ng/mL
Methamphetamine (MET) D-Methamphetamine 1000 ng/mL
Morphine 2000 (MOP) Morphine 2000 ng/mL
The tests contain two formats: 1) Test Cup, 2) Test Dipcard. The test
configuration comes with single drug screening test or any combinations of
multiple drug screening tests. The test is intended for in vitro diagnostics use.
They are intended for prescription use.
These tests provide only a preliminary analytical test result and are the first step in
a two-step process for detecting drugs of abuse in urine. The second step is
confirming the results in a certified laboratory. For a quantitative result or to
confirm preliminary positive results obtained by the One Step Multi-drug Test
Cup Insert or One Step Single/Multi-drug Test Dipcard Insert, a more specific
alternative method such as Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS)
must be used. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied
to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are
indicated.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
These assays are intended for prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable; these are visually read, single use devices.
I. Device Description:
The One Step Single/Multi-drug devices have 2 formats—a dipcard and a test cup.

[Table 1 on page 2]
Test	Calibrator	Cut-off level
Marijuana (THC)	Delta-9-THC-COOH	50 ng/mL
Cocaine (COC)	Benzoylecgonine	300 ng/mL
Amphetamine (AMP)	D-Amphetamine	1000 ng/mL
Methamphetamine (MET)	D-Methamphetamine	1000 ng/mL
Morphine 2000 (MOP)	Morphine	2000 ng/mL

--- Page 3 ---
The formats can accommodate a single drug test or a combination of the five drugs of
abuse in k131110. The One Step Single/Multi-drug Test Cup and One Step
Single/Multi-drug Test Dipcard are competitive binding, lateral flow
immunochromatographic assays for the qualitative detection of Amphetamine,
Cocaines, Marijuana, Methamphetamine,Morphine and their metabolites at specific
cutoffs (see Indications for Use). The devices are individually packaged in pouches
which are opened as needed by the user.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None listed.
L. Test Principle:
The One Step Single/Multi-drug Test Cup and One Step Single/Multi-drug Test
Dipcard are competitive immunoassays that are used to screen for the presence of
Amphetamine, Cocaine, Methamphetamine, Morphine and Marijuana in urine using
monoclonal antibodies. It is a chromatographic absorbent device in which
Amphetamine, Cocaine, Methamphetamine, Morphine and/or Marijuana
competitively combine to a limited number of antibody-dye conjugate binding sites.
When the absorbent end of the test device is immersed into the urine sample, the
urine is absorbed into the device by capillary action. The urine mixes with the
antibody-dye conjugate, and flows across the pre-coated membrane, in which
Amphetamine, Cocaine, Methamphetamine, Morphine and/or Marijuana antigen is
coated respectively. When the drug levels are at or above the cutoffs, the drugs in the
sample bind to the antibody-dye conjugate preventing the antibody-dye conjugate
from binding to the drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test Regions (T) of
the device. This prevents the development of a distinct colored band in the test region
(T), indicating a positive result for each drug.
When the drug levels are zero or below the cutoffs, antibody-dye conjugate binds to
the drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the device. This
produces a colored band in the test region (T) which indicates a negative result.
To serve as a procedure control, a colored line will appear at the Control Region (C),
if the test has been performed properly.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed at 3 hospitals, by two individuals per site.
Samples were analyzed in 3 runs per day day over 10 non-consecutive days
using 3 lots each of Dipcard and Test Cup (N=60 per lot). Drug free urine
samples were spiked for each assay at ± 75% cutoff, ± 50% cutoff, ± 25%

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. The tests are for qualitative use.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Control Materials
External control materials are not supplied with this device; however, this
device has internal process controls. A colored line appearing in the control
region reflects that sufficient sample volume was applied and that adequate
membrane wicking occurred. Users are informed that the test is invalid if a
line fails to appear in the control region. The sponsor states in the labeling
when external QC materials should be tested.
Accelerated and real time studies have been conducted. Protocols and
acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable for both
devices. The manufacturer claims the following expiration date: closed pouch
stability is for 2 years after manufacturing when stored at 4 -30° °C. Open
pouch stability is 1.5 hours.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable. The device is intended for qualitative use.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity with structurally similar compounds was tested for each
device. Each compound was spiked into drug-free urine to 100 mcg/mL. Each
sample was tested in 5 replicates. If any positive result was observed, the
compounds were further sequentially diluted to different concentrations and
tested in quintuplicate to determine the lowest interference concentration that
produces a positive result. 2 lots of dipcard and one lot of test cups were used
for the study.
