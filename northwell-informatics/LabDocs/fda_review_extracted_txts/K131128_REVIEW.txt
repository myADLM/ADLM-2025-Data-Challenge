H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Omega Laboratories Hair Drug Screening Assay for Cocaine and Cocaine
Metabolites (Cocaine) is an in vitro diagnostic test that is intended for the qualitative
detection of Cocaine at or above 500 pg/mg in human head and body hair. To confirm a
screen positive result, a more specific alternate chemical method, such as Gas
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) operating in the selected ion monitoring
(SIM) mode is the preferred method with deuterated internal standards. Professional
judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when
presumptive positive results are obtained.
This test is intended exclusively for single laboratory use only and is not intended for sale
to anyone.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative
chemical method (e.g. LC/MS/MS) must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result.
Other chemical confirmation methods are available. Clinical consideration and
professional judgment must be applied to the interpretation of any drug-of-abuse test
result.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Confirmation testing is performed using an Agilent 6890 Series Gas
Chromatograph/Agilent 5973 Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) operation in the selected ion
monitoring mode using a deuterated internal standard. MSD Chemstation™ software is
used for data collection and analysis.
I. Device Description:
Donor head and body hair samples are collected using the Omega Collection Kit. The Donor
Sample is shipped to the Company facility where testing is conducted by trained scientists under
the direction of the Laboratory Director. This submission accepts Donor Samples from trained
external sources and does not conduct any Point of Care Testing or on-site testing (pre-
employment, insurance, court ordered, employment random screening etc.).

--- Page 3 ---
The assay consists of two parts; a pre-analytical hair treatment procedure (to extract cocaine
from the solid hair matrix to a measurable liquid matrix), and the screening assay. The
screening assay is an Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA).
The Hair Drug Screening Assay for Cocaine uses the International Diagnostic Systems Corp
(IDS) One-Step ELISA Cocaine micro-plate/reagents and a micro-plate reader for the
qualitative detection of Cocaine in hair samples. The test system consists of micro strip plates
coated with rabbit anti-BE polyclonal antibody, enzyme conjugate (horseradish peroxidase
conjugated to cocaine), substrate (containing tetramethylbenzidine), and wash solution. Cut
off concentration is 500 pg/mg hair.

None referenced
L. Test Principle:
The test consists of two parts; a pre-analytical hair treatment procedure (to remove Cocaine
from the solid hair matrix to a measurable liquid matrix), and the screening assay. The
screening assay is an Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA). Sample is added to a
well of the micro strip plate and enzyme conjugate is added, followed by incubation. During
this phase the enzyme-labeled drug conjugate competes with drug in the sample for a limited
number of binding sites on the rabbit antibody-coated micro wells. The two bind in
proportion to their concentrations. A wash solution is applied to remove any unbound
materials.
Enzyme substrate solution containing a chromagen is added. The reaction is
stopped with an acid and the absorbance is read using a plate reader at 450 nm and a
background reading is also taken at 630 nm. Color intensity is inversely proportional to the
amount of drug present in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
See k112808 for control stability, hair storage, and shipping study information.
d. Detection limit:
See k112808
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity of structurally similar (test) compounds was assessed by performing
serial dilutions of each test compound in negative head hair matrix. The concentration
of the test compound that gave a similar absorbance to the 500 pg/mg cocaine cut-off

ng/mL (400,000 pg/mg). Negative head hair extracts were spiked with cocaine at
-50% (250 pg/mg), +125% (625 pg/mg), and +150% (750 pg/mg) of the cocaine cut-
off concentration (500 pg/mg). The samples were additionally spiked with the test
compounds and compared to the control containing the 500 pg/mL cocaine cut-off
concentration. All compounds were found to interfere at the +125% (625 pg/mg), and
+150% (750 pg/mg) cut-off concentrations. The following compounds were found to
interfere in the assay at the -50% (250 pg/mg) cut-off concentration (if combined

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
In the first of three agreement studies, 345 head hair specimens (including 100
negative specimens) were analyzed utilizing the ELISA technique described above.
An additional 30 head hair negative specimens were analyzed in a second study and
49 body hair specimens were analyzed in the third study. Each specimen was divided
into 2 aliquots for screening and GC/MS confirmation to verify the quantitative value
of cocaine compared to the 500 pg/mg cut-off. The combined results (n=424) are
shown below:
