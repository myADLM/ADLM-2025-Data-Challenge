DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
k131140
B. Purpose for Submission:
New Device
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Omnyx, LLC, Omnyx Manual Read of the Digital HER2 Application
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Manual scoring of digital images on a computer monitor of glass slides stained
immunohistochemically with the Dako HercepTest™ pharmDx™ kit.
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The Omnyx Manual Read of the Digital HER2 Application is intended to aid pathology
professionals in creating, managing, storing, annotating, measuring, and viewing digital
whole slide images from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections
stained with the Dako HercepTest™.
The system is composed of the following components:
• VL4 Scanner: A hardware device that captures and compresses bright field images of
tissue samples.
• Data and Workflow Infrastructure: A set of networked applications which enables
case data entry, acquisition, indexing, storage and acceptance of digital pathology
images, workflow management, and retrieval of case and image data.
• Digital Histology Workstation: The application which permits the histologist to
review or enter case data and check quality of scanned images.
• Digital Pathology Workstation: The application which allows the pathologist to
retrieve case data and review and annotate slide images.
In addition, the Manual Read of the Digital HER2 Application includes a specific
computer and monitor.
Hardware:
1

--- Page 2 ---
The Omnyx™ VL4 scanner is an automated imaging system that can be loaded with up
to 4 slides at a time. The Digital Histology Workstation computer consists of a monitor,
keyboard and mouse all provided by Omnyx. The Digital Pathology Workstation
consists of a workstation computer, dual high-resolution monitors, keyboard and mouse
all provided by Omnyx.
Software:
The Omnyx IDP system software is composed of 1) the VL4 scanner software which
performs tissue identification, scan planning, focusing, image acquisition, stitching and
compression of digital slide images and sends them to the Digital Archive and 2) the DPS
software that manages the Histologist and Pathologist workstation functions, image
viewer, workflow service, database, interface engine, APLIS service, digital archive,
image store and the administrator client application.
2. Principles of Operation:
Glass slides with FFPE tissue sections stained with the Dako HercepTest™ are scanned
and digitized using the Omnyx VL4 scanner. The Omnyx™ VL4 is an automated
imaging system that captures and compresses bright field images of tissue samples.
Slides are scanned at 40x (0.275 µm/pixel) magnification. The VL4 scanner calculates
the region to be scanned. If not in the auto scan mode, the user can optionally check the
region to be scanned by touching the slide displaying the macro image, which then
displays the ‘scan area’ in a green overlay. If satisfied, the user can commence the scan.
The VL4 scans 25mm x 75mm and 26mm x 76mm slides.
Once a scan is complete, the scanner ensures that both the slide metadata and the
compressed image are correctly associated with the unique scan identifier. The scanner
then sends the image and metadata to the Digital Archive. The Digital Archive verifies
that the image and metadata are correctly associated with the unique scan identifier. It
then sends confirmation to the VL4 that it has completed this verification and stores the
scans. The scanned images can be viewed without magnification at the VL4 touch
screen, but images captured at high magnifications require an external viewing system
(Omnyx Histologist or Pathologist Workstation) to view the images at the scanned
resolution. The Omnyx Histology Workstation supports the histologist process from case
creation to case review before release to the pathologist. The Pathologist Workstation
enables the pathologist to review the digital HercepTest™ IHC whole slide image via the
Omnyx Image Viewer. The Image Viewer is used by the pathologist for annotating
images, making measurements and for HER2 scoring of the slides. Slides are scored by
the pathologist based on the review of the digital image of the HER2 stained glass slide.
HER2 scoring is performed according to the instructions in the package insert for the
Dako HercepTest™ pharmDx kit™.
3. Modes of Operation:
Manual scoring of digital images on a computer monitor of glass slides stained with the
Dako HercepTest™ pharmDx kit™.
2

--- Page 3 ---
4. Specimen Identification:
Glass tissue slides are identified by barcoded slide label or manual matching of whole
slide images to the slides.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
HER2 IHC stained slides manually loaded onto the VL4 slide scanner. The scanner
holds four sides at a time. Slides are scanned at the 40x (0.275 µm/pixel) magnification.
6. Calibration:
Calibration is performed at installation and after 1300 hours of use by the systems
administrator.
7. Quality Control:
Quality control is performed by the operator before releasing the images to the
pathologist for review. Slides with sub-optimal images will be rescanned.
The accuracy of the system depends on the laboratory following the quality control
instructions for the Dako HercepTest™ pharmDx kit™ assay. The positive and negative
control slides are also scanned along with the patient slides which are reviewed by the
pathologist before scoring.

1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy:
A method comparison study was performed to compare the HER2 scores under
the manual microscopy method (MM) to the corresponding scores using the glass
slide digital image read on a computer monitor (M-WSI).
The study used 200 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human breast
cancer specimens with different levels of HER2 expression. All slides were
stained with the Dako HercepTest™ pharmDx™ kit using the Dako Autostainer
Link 48. There was approximately the same number of slides in each of the
scoring categories (0, 1+, 2+ and 3). Slides were scanned at 2 different locations
(3 different laboratories) using 3 scanners at 40x magnification. Four study sites
were used with one pathologist at each site. The corresponding negative control
reagent slides and the positive control slides were also scanned along with the
study cases and evaluated by the study pathologists before scoring the slides.
Thirteen slides were excluded from analysis due to “uncertain or no definite
invasive carcinoma” (n=11), poor staining quality (n=1) and slide breakage (n=1).
HER2 scoring was performed according to the instructions in the package insert
for the Dako HerceptTest™ pharmDx™ kit. After a minimum of two-week
washout period, the same pathologist at each site accessed the scanned images of
the HER2 IHC stained slides through the Omnyx Pathologist Workstation and
performed the M-WSI reads of the same slides. The table below shows the data
for this study.

b. Precision/Reproducibility:
Intra-Pathologist/Inter-Day
The intra-reader/inter-day was performed using M-WSI reads by 3 independent
pathologists. Forty HER2 stained slides with even score distribution were read by
each pathologist 3 times digitally (M-WSI). The slides used in this study were a
different set of clinical slides from the method comparison study. The slides were
scanned on a single Omnyx VL4 scanner and the final images were used. There was
a 2-week minimum washout period and 10 additional slides were added during each
reading as “wildcards” (unique wildcards during each read) to minimize recall bias.
Pair-wise comparisons between the 3 reads were performed (i.e., read 1 vs. read 2,
read 1 vs. read 3, and read 2 vs. read 3) and the results are shown in the tables
below.

Precision:
In the inter-scanner precision study, a single pathologist reviewed and scored 80 ROIs
(Regions of Interest) which were extracted from scans of 40 slides. The four HER2
scoring categories were equally represented in this set of slides. The slides were
scanned by 3 different VL4 scanners. Due to slide damage, some slides were not
scanned on all three scanners. There was a washout period of at least two weeks
between each set of reads. Additionally, a separate set of 60 “wildcard” ROIs were
extracted from the WSIs (unique set of 20 ROIs used per read session) to be included
during each reading session to reduce recall bias. The pathologist reviewed and
scored each ROI. Precision among each scanner pair was determined based on the
HercepTest™ scores of the 80 ROIs. The inter-scanner precision data is shown in
table 5 below.
