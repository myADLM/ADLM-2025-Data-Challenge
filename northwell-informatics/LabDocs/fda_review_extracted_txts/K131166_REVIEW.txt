L. Test Principle:
The Sofia hCG FIA is an immunofluorescence-based lateral flow test for use with the Sofia
Analyzer. The test uses a pair of monoclonal murine antibodies specific to the beta
subunit of hCG to capture and detect hCG.
To perform the test, a urine specimen is collected and dispensed into the Sample Well on
the Test Cassette. The Cassette is placed inside of the Sofia Analyzer for an automatically
defined development time. The Sofia Analyzer then scans the test strip and analyzes the
fluorescent signal, using method-specific algorithms. The Sofia Analyzer then displays the
4

--- Page 5 ---
test result (Positive, Negative, or Invalid) on the screen, and optionally prints the results on
an integrated printer.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the Sofia hCG FIA was evaluated at three (3) different
laboratories. Three (3) different operators at each site tested a series of coded, four
contrived samples, prepared in negative urine, spiked with hCG traceable to WHO
International 4th standard to generate samples ranging from 5 mIU/mL to 25 mIU/mL
hCG.
A total of nine (9) Sofia Analyzers were used. For each level a total of 90 replicates
were tested over five (5) different days at each site. The results are summarized as
follows:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. This is a qualitative test.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Sofia hCG FIA is standardized to the WHO Fourth International Standard
75/589.
All stability protocols were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The shelf-life
stability study showed that the device is stable for 24 months when stored at room
temperature (15 to 30˚C).
d. Detection limit:
The sensitivity of the Sofia hCG FIA was tested by spiking pooled male urine with
varying concentrations (0 to 100 mIU/mL) of hCG traceable to WHO International 4th
Standard. Studies were conducted with 3 lots of devices. Representative results are
listed in the table below. The positive/negative threshold at which 100% of the
samples tested positive was confirmed at 20 mIU/mL hCG.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A multi-center clinical study was conducted to establish the performance of the Sofia
hCG FIA compared to results obtained from the predicate device. This study was
conducted by health care personnel at five (5) different sites within the United States.
In this multi-center, point-of-care (POC) field trial, 974 fresh urine specimens,
collected from patients presenting for pregnancy testing, were evaluated. The study
consisted of female subjects of childbearing age, who were being screened for
pregnancy and who had given verbal consent to participation. The following subjects
were excluded: post-menopausal subjects, subjects who within the past six weeks had
experienced any of the following: delivered a newborn, had an abortion or a natural
termination (miscarriage), or, received hCG supplements, subjects who had a
hysterectomy, and subjects who were unable to understand and consent to
participation. Results from the study are summarized below.

N. Instrument Name:
Sofia analyzer.
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Sofia Analyzer is a bench top instrument intended to be used with cassette based
immunofluorescent in vitro diagnostic assays manufactured by Quidel Corporation.
After the extracted patient sample has been added to the test cassette, the test is
developed at room temperature for a pre-specified period of time. The cassette is then
placed into the Analyzer where it is scanned, and the fluorescent signal of the test is
processed.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ____X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
The user ID, patient ID, and order # can be entered via a handheld barcode scanner or by
manually entering the information onto the keypad of the Sofia Analyzer.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Urine specimen is collected in a clean container. First morning specimens generally
contain the highest concentrations of hCG and are recommended for early detection of
pregnancy. However, any urine sample is suitable for testing.
Labeling states that if testing will not be performed immediately, the specimens may be
kept at room temperature (15-30°C) or refrigerated (2-8°C) for up to 72 hours. For
prolonged storage, specimens may be frozen once at -20°C or below.
5. Calibration:
The labeling provides details regarding the Calibration Check Procedure for the Sofia
10

--- Page 11 ---
analyzer. The Calibration Check Procedure should be performed every thirty (30) days.
The Sofia Analyzer can be set to remind the user to complete the Calibration Check
Procedure.
The Calibration Check is a required function that checks the Sofia Analyzer optics and
calculation systems using a specific Calibration Cassette. This Calibration Cassette is
shipped with the Sofia Installation Pack.
6. Quality Control:
Built-in Procedural Controls
The Sofia hCG FIA test strip contains a built-in procedural control feature. Each time a
test is run, the Sofia Analyzer scans this part of the test strip, and the result is displayed
on the Analyzer screen as “valid” or “invalid.”
A valid result obtained with this procedural control demonstrates that the test flowed
correctly and the functional integrity of the Cassette was maintained. The procedural
control is interpreted by the Sofia Analyzer simultaneously with the end of the assay. If
the test does not flow correctly, the Sofia Analyzer will indicate that the result is invalid.
Should this occur, the labeling instructs the user to review the procedure and repeat the
test with a new test Cassette.
External Quality Control
External controls are also recommended for use to demonstrate that the reagents and
assay procedure perform properly. Labeling recommends that controls be tested once for
each new lot, new shipment of kits, and every 30 days as a check on storage and if
applicable, as deemed additionally necessary by laboratory internal quality control
procedures, and in accordance with local, state and federal regulations or accreditation
requirements.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Not applicable.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
