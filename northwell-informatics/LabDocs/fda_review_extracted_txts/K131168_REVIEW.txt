H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Immunalysis Oxycodone Urine Enzyme Immunoassay is a homogenous
enzyme immunoassay with a dual cutoff of 100 ng/mL and 300 ng/mL. The
1

--- Page 2 ---
assay is intended for use in laboratories for the qualitative and semi-quantitative
analysis of Oxycodone in human urine with automated clinical chemistry
analyzers. This assay is calibrated against Oxycodone. This in-vitro diagnostic
device is for prescription use only. The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of
enabling laboratories to determine an appropriate dilution of the specimen for
confirmation by a confirmatory method such as GC-MS or permitting laboratories
to establish quality control procedures.
The Immunalysis Oxycodone Urine Enzyme Immunoassay Kit provides only a
preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternate chemical method
must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) or Liquid Chromatography/Mass
Spectroscopy (LC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical
consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse
test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.
The Immunalysis Oxycodone Urine Calibrators are used as calibrators in the
Immunalysis Oxycodone Urine Enzyme Immunoassay for the qualitative and
semi-quantitative determination of Oxycodone in urine on automated clinical
chemistry analyzers.
The Immunalysis Oxycodone Urine Controls are used as control materials in the
Immunalysis Oxycodone Urine Enzyme Immunoassay.
2. Indication(s) for use:
See intended uses above.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
· For prescription use only
· For in vitro diagnostic use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
The Beckman Coulter AU400e Chemistry Analyzer was used to generate the
performance data in this submission.
I. Device Description:
The assay consists of antibody/substrate reagent and enzyme conjugate reagent. The
antibody/substrate reagent includes recombinant monoclonal antibodies to
Oxycodone, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NAD) in Tris buffer with Sodium Azide as a preservative. The enzyme conjugate
reagent includes oxycodone derivative labeled with glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in Tris buffer with Sodium Azide as a preservative.
Calibrators and control materials are prepared from synthetic negative urine and a
commercially available oxycodone drug standard. The concentration of the
Oxycodone in these calibrators and control materials is determined by Liquid
2

chromatography/Mass Spectroscopy (LC/MS).
The following calibrators are available:
· Oxycodone Calibrator Set (0, 100ng/mL, 300 ng/mL, 500ng/mL and
1000ng/mL) for the semi-quantitative mode.
· 100 ng/mL Oxycodone Calibrator for the 100ng/mL cutoff
· 300 ng/mL Oxycodone Calibrator for the 300ng/mL cutoff
The following control materials are available:

· Draft Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Premarket Submission and Labeling
Recommendations for Drugs of Abuse Screening Tests
L. Test Principle:
The assay uses an Oxycodone specific antibody. The assay is based on the
competition of Oxycodone labeled enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PDH) and the free drug in the urine sample for the fixed amount of antibody
binding sites. In the absence of the free drug in the sample, the antibody binds the
drug enzyme conjugate and enzyme activity is inhibited. This creates a dose response
relationship between drug concentration in the urine sample and enzyme activity.
The enzyme G6PDH activity is determined at 340 nm spectrophotometrically by the
conversion of NAD to NADH.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A drug free urine pool was spiked with a high concentration of Oxycodone
and was used as the high value specimen. Additional pools were made by
serially diluting the high value specimen with drug free urine in increments of
10%. Aliquots from each pool were analyzed in duplicate in the semi-
quantitative mode using all 6 calibrators for the 100 ng/mL and 300 ng/mL
cutoffs (0, 100, 300, 500, 1000 ng/mL) using 2 Beckman Coulter AU400e
Chemistry Analyzers. For each known concentration, drug recovery was
calculated using the mean concentration of the replicates. Summary results

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The controls and calibrators are prepared using a commercially available
Oxycodone standard. The concentration of Oxycodone in these calibrators
and controls is determined by LC/MS analysis.
Stability: Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable. The sponsor claims that when stored at 2-8 ºC calibrators and
controls are stable for 10 months.
The sponsor claims that once opened, the calibrators and controls are stable
for 14 days if stored on-board the instrument at ambient temperature (22 to
28ºC).
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies:
Structurally non-similar compounds and endogenous compound were
evaluated to ensure that there was no interference that caused a false response
relative to the cutoff in the qualitative mode and semi-quantitative mode.
Results were analyzed following the recommendations in CLSI EP 7-A2.
Potential interfering and endogenous substances were spiked into drug free
urine containing Oxycodone at ± 25% of the cutoff (75ng/mL and 125ng/mL
for the 100ng/mL cutoff and 225ng/mL and 375ng/mL for the 300ng/mL
cutoff). Each sample was tested in replicates of 4 for the qualitative testing
and in duplicate for the semi-quantitative testing using 2 Beckman Coulter
AU400e Chemistry Analyzers and compared to the corresponding Oxycodone
control.
The following structurally non-similar compounds (each tested at 100,000
ng/mL) were found not to interfere with the test result at either cutoff in both
qualitative and semi-quantitative modes:
Acetaminophen, Alprazolam, d-Amphetamine, Amitryptyline, Amobarbital,
Benzoylecgonine, Bromazepam, Caffeine, Clonazepam, Carbamazine,
Carisoprodol, Chlorpromazine, Desipramine, Dextromethorphan, Diazepam,
Diphenhydramine, Doxepine, Doxylamine, Flunitrazepam, Flurazepam,

Secobarbital, Sertraline, Pseudo-ephedrine, Ranitidine, Temazepam, 11-nor-

The following endogenous substances at the tested concentrations did not
interfere with the results of the assay at either cutoff:

Boric acid at 1% w/v resulted in a false negative results at both cutoffs. The
sponsor included the following limitation in the labeling:
“Boric acid at 1% w/v resulted in false negative results at both cutoffs. Boric
Acid is not recommended as a preservative for urine.”
Effect of pH: The sponsor evaluated the effect of pH on the test results using
both qualitative and semi-quantitative modes. Drug free urine containing
Oxycodone at ± 25% of the cutoff (75ng/mL and 125ng/mL for the 100ng/mL
cutoff and 225ng/mL and 375ng/mL for the 300ng/mL cutoff) were pH
adjusted using hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. pH values of 3.0, 4.0,
5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0 and 11.0 did not interfere with the test result at
either cutoff.
Effect of specific gravity: The sponsor evaluated the effect of specific gravity
on the test results using both qualitative and semi-quantitative modes. Drug
free urine containing Oxycodone at ± 25% of the cutoff (75ng/mL and
125ng/mL for the 100ng/mL cutoff and 225ng/mL and 375ng/mL for the
300ng/mL cutoff) were adjusted using salt/albumin. Specific Gravity values
of 1.000, 1.002, 1.005, 1.010, 1,015, 1.020, 1.025 and 1.030 did not interfere
with the test result at either cutoff.
Cross reactivity from structurally related compounds was evaluated in the
qualitative and semi-quantitative modes. Oxycodone and the structurally

leftover clinical urine samples obtained from clinical testing laboratories and
were analyzed using one lot of the proposed device using 2 Beckman Coulter
AU400e Chemistry Analyzers. The sponsor compared the results of their
device to results obtained using liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy

* The Sponsor investigated the cause of these false positive results and suspected
sample integrity issues though this could not be verified. Therefore the Sponsor
conducted testing of additional samples and the false results were not replicated in
this study.
b. Matrix comparison:
This device is intended for use on urine samples only.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
