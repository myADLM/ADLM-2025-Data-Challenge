4. Special instrument requirements:
FIA Blood Glucose Meter (G2)
I. Device Description:
The FIA Blood Glucose Monitoring System (G2) comprises an electrochemical biosensor
glucose reagent test strip, a handheld meter, control solutions (Levels I and II; previously
cleared under k032985, but renamed as FIA Glucose Control Solutions in this submission),
and a check strip. The meter will automatically turn on when a test strip is inserted. A small
drop of blood contacts front end aperture which will cause the chamber to fill up on the front
end of a test strip. When a beep sound is heard, the chamber is full and test reaction starts.
When the test is done, the glucose result will appear on the meter's LCD screen. Data will
automatically be stored in memory.

L. Test Principle:
The device is comprised of two main parts: a bio-active electrode (test strip) which contains
the reagent enzyme glucose dehydrogenase (GDH), and the meter. The blood sample is
drawn from fingertip onto the test strip through capillary action. Glucose in the sample reacts
with glucose dehydrogenase and potassium ferricyanide in the test strip producing potassium
ferrocyanide which is the product proportional to the glucose concentration in the blood
sample. During potassium ferrocyanide's oxidation, an electrical current is produced then
converted by the meter. The result (glucose level) will be displayed on the monitor.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The changes; addition of data transmission capability and changing the name of the system,
meter, test strips, and controls, does not change the performance of the system; therefore, the
testing performed in k120064 is adequate to support the performance claims.

Yes ____X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected. Samples are time and date
stamped upon measurement by the glucose meter.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The meter is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger only. Since the
sample is applied immediately and directly to the test strip there are no sample handling or
storage issues.
5. Calibration:
The meter is a non-coding meter. No coding is required by the user.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor recommends two levels of control glucose solution. Level I and Level II.
Both are included in the meter kit. An acceptable range is printed on each the glucose test
strip vial label. The meter uses an algorithm to automatically recognize the control solution
matrix and to prevent the result from being stored as a patient result. Recommendations on
when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. If the control values fall
outside the range, the user is referred to the user manual and customer support for
troubleshooting and more information.

--- Page 9 ---
transfer glucose data to the iGlucose System’s web-based database. A usability test was
conducted with twenty (20) lay users. Each user was provided with a FIA Blood Glucose
meter (G2) and the instructions for use. The participants were given instructions to use a
control solution to obtain a measurement; the glucose value would then automatically be
uploaded to www.iglucose.net. Users were asked to complete a survey about the ease of use
of the device and software. 95% of the lay users indicated a 75% satisfaction level with each
question, indicating that there are no areas of concern about the usability of the device by the
intended users.
G. Bench testing was performed to demonstrate that the meter could accurately transmit data
to a database. The study used a simulated test strip to generate 999 values (full memory)
and automatically transmit data after each measurement on three FIA Blood Glucose
meters (G2) over the cellular network to a web-based server at www.iglucose.net All
data fields, such as meter serial number, glucose result, time, date, and event mark were
100% accurate.
H. Software documentation was reviewed and demonstrated that the device was developed
under appropriate software lifecycle processes.
I. FIA Blood Glucose Monitoring System (G2) Owner’s Manual cleared under k120064
was modified only to include information and instructions for data transfer to a data
management system and name change from PRECICHEK Cloudia Blood Glucose
Monitoring System. A readability assessment was provided to demonstrate that the User
Manual, test strip package insert and control solution package insert were each written at
the 8th grade level.
J. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing was performed. The sponsor provided a
certificate of conformity to IEC 60601-1-2, Medical Electrical Equipment- Part 1-2 and
ISO 61326-1-6: Electrical equipment for measurement, control and laboratory use. EMC
requirements. Particular requirements. In vitro diagnostic (IVD) medical equipment
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
