are washed with wash buffer to remove unbound antibodies and 100 µL of the anti-human
IgG enzyme conjugate reagent is added to each microtiter well. After an additional 30-
minutes incubation at room temperature, the microtiter wells are again washed 3 times with
300 µl of wash buffer to remove any unbound enzyme conjugate and 100 µL of the
chromogen substrate is added. The strips are incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature
and 100 µL stop solution is added. The microtiter plates are placed in an ELISA reader and
read at a wavelength of 450 nm and a reference wavelength of between 620 nm and 650 nm
within 30 minutes.
Results of this assay are given in arbitrary values (ratio of sample optical density (OD) to OD
of cutoff control). The arbitrary values are reported as positive or negative. A ratio of ≥1.0
is a positive result. A ratio of <1.0 is a negative result.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The within-run imprecision was investigated using 6 serum samples with different
concentrations covering the measurement range, including 2 samples near the cutoff.
Tests were performed according to the package insert with 20 replicates for each
sample. The % coefficient of variation (%CV) of the 20 replicates within the run was
calculated. The following results were obtained:

The between-run imprecision was investigated using 10 serum samples with different
concentrations covering the measurement range, including 2 samples near the cutoff.
Tests were performed according to the package insert with 3 replicates of each
sample performed in 10 different runs on 5 days with 2 runs per day. The %CV was
calculated by assessing between-run analysis of variance. The square root of the
mean square of between-run variation was utilized to calculate the SD of this variance
component. The following results were obtained (Ratio):

The Lot -to- Lot imprecision was investigated using 9 serum samples with different
concentrations distributed over the measurement range including 1 sample near cutoff.
The samples were tested using 3 different kit lots in 2 different runs with a single
replicate of each sample according to the package insert. The mean and SD of each
sample in each lot was calculated. The %CV across the three lots was calculated from
the SD of the three values in each lot for each sample concentration. The following

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There is no recognized standard or reference material for anti-nuclear antibodies is
available. Results of this assay are given in arbitrary values (ratio of sample OD to
cutoff control OD).
Calibrators & Controls
The calibrator and controls are derived from human serum, purchased from
commercial sources. The serum is tested and found negative for HBsAg, anti-HCV,
anti-HIV-1 and anti-HIV-2. The calibrator is manufactured by dilution of the human
serum with stabilizing buffer and adjusted to match the required performance criteria
in use with the corresponding microtiter strip lot and the corresponding kit controls.
The new lot of calibrator is assayed using a reference panel of at least 8 positive and 2
negative reference sera (distributed over the measurement range). By further dilution
or spiking with the original serum, the calibrators are adjusted until the following
acceptance criteria are met: At least 6 of the 8 positive sera must be found within the
established acceptable ranges. The OD of the negative sera must be below the OD of
the calibrator. After the adjustment is completed, the components of the new ELISA
kit lot are tested together.
Stability
Three production lots of all kit reagents were tested and determined to be over 12
months for all components. The reconstituted Wash Buffer is stable for up to 28
days. The opened reagents are stable for 6 months.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity: Cross reactivity was investigated using a total of 82 clinically and
serologically characterized samples (10 celiac disease for antibodies against gliadin
and tissue transglutaminase, 17 Wegener’s granulomatosis for ANCA, 39 rheumatoid
Page 6 of 10

--- Page 7 ---
arthritis for antibodies against CCP and 16 infectious diseases antibody positive
samples). All samples (except 1 sample with ANCA reactivity from a subject with
Wegener’s granulomatosis and 1 sample with antibodies against CCP from a subject
with rheumatoid arthritis) were negative in the ANA Screen ELISA (IgG), so
minimal cross reactivity is expected.
Interference: To investigate the influence from hemoglobin, triglycerides and
bilirubin, four different specimens at different ANA concentrations (ratio 0.5 – 7.3)
were spiked with potential interfering substances and were incubated with the test
system. The recovery in relation to the un-spiked sample without interferent was
calculated. The individual recovery of the positive or borderline samples was within
the range of 92 – 107%. No significant interference was observed for concentrations
of up to 1000 mg/dL for hemoglobin, 2000 mg/dL for triglyceride and 40 mg/dL for
bilirubin. Furthermore, the influence from rheumatoid factor was investigated by
spiking of 6 different specimens with a rheumatoid factor positive material
(characterized nephelometrically). The recovery in relation to the original sample
(not spiked) was calculated. The recoveries were found within 100 - 110%. No
interference (≤ ± 10%) was observed with rheumatoid factor up to 500 IU/mL.
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cutoff is a ratio of 1.0.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A comparison study was performed using 158 clinically characterized samples from
patients (49 MCTD, 37 systemic lupus erythematosus, 37 Sjögren’s syndrome, 19
systemic sclerosis, 16 myositis) and 132 from control groups (10 celiac disease, 17
Wegener’s granulomatosis, 39 rheumatoid arthritis, 16 infectious disease and 50
healthy), obtained from different sources. The panel consisted of 101 men and 174
women (and 14 unknown). Age ranged from 7 to 87 years with an average age of 46
years (15 unknown). The samples were tested with the EUROIMMUN ANA Screen
ELISA (IgG) and with the Aesku Aeskulisa ANA Hep-2 as the predicate device. The
results are shown in the table below. The discrepant samples were from controls and
one MCTD sample in the cut-off range.
