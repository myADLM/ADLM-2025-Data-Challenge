L. Test Principle:
GLUH reagent is used to measure the glucose concentration by a timed endpoint method. In
the reaction, hexokinase (HK) catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) to glucose to form adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and glucose-6-
phosphate. The glucose-6-phosphate is then oxidized to 6-phosphogluconate with the
concomitant reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to reduced -
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) by the catalytic action of glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PDH). The signal is measured by spectrophotometric detection.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run (repeatability) and total imprecision (Intermediate precision) studies for
the UniCel DxC SYNCHRON Systems Glucose (GLUH) assay were performed in
accordance to CLSI Guideline EP5- A2, “Evaluation of Precision Performance of
Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline – Second Edition.”
Precision studies were performed using 3 serum based controls, 3 serum pools, 3 urine

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies were designed in accordance with CLSI Guideline EP6-A:
Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures. Samples were
prepared by splitting two pools for each of the three sample types: serum, urine and
CSF. One of the pools for each of the sample types were spiked with a glucose stock
solution and then intermixed with the second pool to create 16 samples spanning the
assay range. 4 replicates were tested for each of the 16 glucose samples created.
Samples range tested was between 5 – 700 mg/dL. The results from regression
analysis between the target values and the measured values are summarized below:
UniCel® DxC 600 SYNCHRON System
Urine Y = 1.00x + 0.446, R2=0.999
CSF Y = 1.01x + 1.516, R2=0.999
Serum Y = 1.01x + 1.088, R2=0.999

The results of the linearity study support the claimed measuring range of 5-700 mg/dL
for glucose on the UniCel® DxC 600/800 SYNCHRON System analyzers.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The SYNCHRON Systems AQUA CAL 1 and 3 calibrators are traceable to NIST
SRM 917a reference material and have been previously cleared in k965240.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
of UniCel DxC SYNCHRON Systems Glucose reagent (GLUH) were determined
according to CLSI EP17-A- Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and
Limits of Quantitation. Studies were performed in the following manner:
To calculate the Limit of Blank (LoB), 4 blank samples were measured in triplicate
for 5 days using 2 instrument lots on both UniCel® DxC 600 and 800 SYNCHRON
System analyzers.
To estimate the LoD, 4 samples containing low levels of glucose were measured in
triplicate for 5 days using 2 instrument lots on both UniCel® DxC 600 and 800
SYNCHRON System analyzers.
To estimate the LoQ, 4 samples containing low levels of glucose were measured in
triplicate for 5 days using 2 instrument lots on both UniCel® DxC 600 and 800
SYNCHRON System analyzers.
Based on the study results, the following detection limit claims were made for both
UniCel® DxC 600 and 800 SYNCHRON System analyzers.
Serum CSF Urine
mg/dL mg/dL mg/dL
LoB 0.19 0.17 0.19
LoD 1.74 1.68 1.78
LoQ 3.78 3.67 3.69
The detection limit studies support the claimed measuring range of 5-700 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed by evaluating 8 potential interfering substances
spiked into patient serum pools at three different glucose levels, 40 to 60 mg/dL, 166
to 210 mg/dL and 400 to 480 mg/dL. Potential interferences were spiked into patient
