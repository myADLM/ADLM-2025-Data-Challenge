L. Test Principle:
The Gmate SMART Blood Glucose Monitoring System is an in vitro diagnostic device
intended for the measurement of glucose in capillary blood. The principle of the test relies
upon a reaction between a specific type of sugar (glucose) in the blood sample and the
glucose oxidase in the test strip. This reaction generates a small electrical current. The meter
measures the current and calculates the blood glucose level. Combined with the Gmate®
SMART App, it displays the test result and stores them on the smartphone or mobile device.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed within-run precision studies using EDTA venous whole blood
samples spiked to five different glucose concentration ranges (30 to 50, 51 to 110,
111 to 150, 151 to 250, and 251 to 400 mg/dL). The hematocrit of the samples used
was 35 to 50%. Fifty samples were prepared at each glucose level, and each sample
was analyzed in duplicate for a total of 100 results per glucose level. Two operators
collected the results using one test strip lot and twenty meters. Results are
summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using three test strip lots and 14 mixed pools of venous blood
with glucose concentrations at 8, 18, 27, 47, 67, 77, 87, 166, 244, 324, 400, 481, 559,
and 635 mg/dL as measured by the YSI reference method. Each level was measured
in replicates of five with each of three test strip lots and the values from the Gmate®
SMART meter were compared with those obtained from the YSI-2300. Results from
regression analysis:
Test strip lot #1: y = 0.999x + 1.443; r2 = 0.999
Test strip lot #2: y = 1.003x + 1.267; r2 = 0.999
Test strip lot #3: y = 1.004x + 1.466; r2 = 0.999
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of
20 - 600 mg/dL.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The Gmate SMART Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to the YSI 2747
Glucose Standard. The method comparison study was performed using the candidate
device and YSI 2300 Glucose Analyzer as the reference method. The controls are
prepared at two target concentrations gravimetrically and the glucose concentrations
are verified with the YSI reference method.
The primary calibrator is traceable to NIST SRM 917b.
Stability – Gmate Control solutions
The claimed stability of the Gmate Control Solutions was established in k113636.
Stability - Gmate® Test Strips
The claimed stability of the Gmate Test Strips was established in k113636.
Value Assignment - Gmate Control solutions
The Gmate Control Solutions are available at three concentrations L1, 2, and 3.
Value assignment for the controls was established under k113636.
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the device is 20 - 600 mg/dL. This range was validated by the
linearity study (M.1.b).
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed by spiking venous blood to two levels of glucose
concentrations (approximately 100 and 330 mg/dL). Each of these samples was then
divided into five aliquots and spiked with four levels of potential interferent. Each
sample was then analyzed five times with the Gmate® SMART meter and the %
difference between the mean of the measurements and YSI was calculated. The
sponsor defines no significant interference as ≤ ± 10% difference compared to YSI.
Results are presented in the table below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To assess system accuracy, results from the Gmate® SMART Blood Glucose
Monitoring System were compared to a reference method, the YSI 2300. One
hundred (100) samples with glucose concentrations ranging from 38 to 432 mg/dL
were tested using three test strip lots. Five low concentration samples ranging from 38
to 49 mg/dL were obtained by allowing samples to glycolyze, and five high
concentration samples ranging from 402 to 432 mg/dL were obtained by spiking.
The results relative to YSI are summarized in the tables below:

forearm, upper arm, hand, thigh and calf samples. Three test strip lots were used in
this study. Results were analyzed by comparing blood glucose results from the
Gmate® SMART meter obtained by the lay user against the YSI 2300 reference
value. All samples were unaltered and concentrations ranged from 58 to 422 mg/dL
as measured by YSI. The results are summarized in the tables below:

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes No
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes No
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, forearm,
upper arm, thigh, calf, and palm. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test
strip by capillary action.
5. Calibration:
The system is designed to be non-coding. The test strips are coded with a test strip lot-
specific code during manufacture. When the test strip is inserted into the meter it
provides the appropriate calibration code information to the meter, therefore, the user is
not required to enter any coding information or verify the coding.
6. Quality Control:
Glucose control solutions at three different concentrations are provided for this device.
Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. An
acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is
cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Altitude.
Venous whole blood samples were adjusted to concentrations of 71, 130, 231, and
371 mg/dL (by the reference method) and were compared to YSI at sea level and
10,000 feet. The study evaluated one test strip lot and ten meters. The results
demonstrate acceptable bias and indicate acceptable performance to the claimed
altitude of 10,000 ft.
2. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Testing was evaluated and certified by two
third party labs and certificates of compliance were provided.
3. Hematocrit
The effect of different hematocrit levels on the performance of the Gmate® SMART
Blood Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated using venous whole blood samples
with hematocrit levels of 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60% spiked with glucose to achieve 5
concentrations at 50, 100, 150, 230, and 330 mg/dL. Each sample was then tested ten
times using the Gmate® SMART meter and the values were compared with those
obtained from YSI 2300 analyzer. The % biases relative to YSI were acceptable
within the claimed hematocrit range of 20 to 60%.
4. Usability / Lay User Questionnaire Results
A usability study was performed to assess the readability of the labeling by recruiting
untrained lay users who were provided with the test kit containing labeling for the US
market. These lay users also completed a questionnaire regarding the clarity of the
instructions and the ease of use of the device. The majority of the users responded
that it was easy or very easy to use the BGMS.
5. Readability
A Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the results demonstrated
that the Owner’s Manual was written at an 8th grade level. Readability for the strip
insert, quick reference guide, and control package insert were evaluated during the
review of k113636 and determined to be at an 8th grade level or below.
6. Sample Volume
The sponsor performed a study to verify the test strip minimum sample volume
requirement for the Gmate® SMART Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Blood
samples were tested at four sample volumes (0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 1.0 µL) and five
glucose concentrations (40, 70, 125, 250, and 450 mg/dL) Glucose values obtained
14

--- Page 15 ---
with the Gmate® SMART were compared to YSI values. Results support the
claimed minimum sample volume of 0.5 µL.
7. Temperature and Relative Humidity
The combined effect of temperature and humidity were evaluated in a chamber where
these conditions can be controlled. The sponsor used ten meters and three test strip
lots. Whole blood samples with approximate concentrations of 70, 120, 300 mg/dL
were tested 30 times under the following conditions:
10 , 10% (low temperature, low humidity)
10℃, 90% (low temperature, high humidity)
40℃, 10% (high temperature, low humidity)
40℃, 90% (high temperature, high humidity)
Th℃e results demonstrated that Philosys Gmate SMART produces accurate results over
the claimed temperature range of 10-40˚C (50-104˚F) and claimed humidity range of
10-90%.
8. Customer Service Number
The Customer Service Support is available 24/7, 365 days a year. The toll free phone
number is 1-855-464-6283.
9. Infection Control
This device system is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy
studies were performed on the materials comprising the meter , iPhone 3GS, iPhone
4, iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, iPod touch 4th generation, Pad 1,and iPad 2 by an outside
commercial testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B
virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, CaviWipes with EPA registration # 46781-
8.
Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was
no change in performance or in the external materials of the meter, iPhone 3GS,
iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, iPod touch 4th generation, Pad 1, and iPad 2 after 260
cleaning and disinfection cycles designed to simulate 5 years of single-patient device
use (to represent 260 cleanings and 260 disinfections). Labeling was reviewed for
adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
