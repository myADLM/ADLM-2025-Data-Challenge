4. Special instrument requirements:
None
I. Device Description:
UCP Home Pregnancy Tests and UCP Pregnancy Tests use nitrocellulose strips in
Midstream, Dip Card/Strip, and Cassette test formats. The tests are lateral flow
immunoassays that are conducted by immersing the test strips in urine specimen and
observing the formation of colored lines. The specimen migrates via capillary action
along the membrane to react with the colored conjugate. Users are able to read tests
results in 3 minutes.

(OTC) Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) 510(k)s.
L. Test Principle:
UCP Home Pregnancy Test and UCP Pregnancy Test use nitrocellulose strips. The test
utilizes a mixture of monoclonal (mouse) and polyclonal (goat) antibodies to selectively
identify the elevated level of hCG in human urine. A colloidal gold conjugate is used to
visualize the immunological reaction. The assay is conducted by immersing the test strips
in a urine specimen and observing the formation of colored lines. The urine specimen
migrates via capillary action along the membrane to react with the colored conjugate. A
negative specimen produces no line in the test zone (T), and one colored line in the control
zone (C). A positive specimen produces distinct colored lines in both the test zone (T) and
the control zone (C). An invalid specimen produces either no lines or one line in the test
zone (T) and no line in the control zone (C).
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision/reproducibility study was conducted at three sites (one internal site
and 2 POC sites) using three lots by three operators over multiple days, with 20
replicates for each standard tested (0, 12.5, 18.75, 25, 31.25, 50, 100 mIU/mL
hCG). Standards used for spiking contain the purified intact hCG traceable to the
WHO International 4th Standard. The testing results are summarized in the

mIU/mL), Follicle Stimulating Hormone (1000 mIU/mL) and Thyroid Stimulating
Hormone (1000 mIU/mL) separately into urine samples that contain 0 and 25
mIU/mL hCG. The samples were tested by all device formats. The results
demonstrate that the tested levels of LH, FSH, or TSH do not cross react with UCP
Pregnancy tests.
The hCG ß core fragment at the concentrations 250,000 pmol/L, 500,000 pmol/L,
1,000,000 pmol/L, respectively, was spiked into negative urine, urine samples that
contain 0 and 25 mIU/mL hCG, then tested using 3 lots of each UCP Pregnancy test
device formats. The results demonstrate that the hCG ß core fragment does not
interfere with UCP Pregnancy tests.
Various prescription, over the counter drugs, and chemicals (at a concentration of
100 ug/mL or above) and potential endogenous interferents were tested by each
UCP Pregnancy Test format and showed no cross-reactivity with urine samples
containing 0 and 25 mIU/mL hCG. The testing results are summarized in the

To evaluate potential interference of urine pH on the test results, negative and positive
urine samples (with hCG at 0 and 25 mIU/mL, respectively) were adjusted to pH
ranges from 4.5 to 9, then tested by each UCP Pregnancy Test format. The results
demonstrate urine pH ranging from 4.5 to 9 does not interfere with UCP Pregnancy
Tests.
To evaluate potential interference of urine specific gravity on the test results,
negative and positive urine samples (with hCG at 0 and 25 mIU/mL, respectively)
were adjusted to the specific gravity values from 1.002 to 1.035, using unaltered
urine as a control, and then tested by each UCP Pregnancy Test format. The results
demonstrate urine specific gravity values from 1.002 to 1.035 do not interfere with
UCP Pregnancy Tests.

Comparison studies between each UCP Pregnancy Test format and the predicate
device were conducted at a physician’s office by lab professionals using 100 masked
randomized urine specimens. The urine specimens were collected from 100 women
who fit the following categories: childbearing age, suspected pregnant women, and
women in early pregnancy (first trimester of pregnancy). The women collected urine
samples in cups to be used for this study. The results of all formats of UCP
Pregnancy Tests and the predicate device were 100% in agreement when tested by the
lab professionals. The UCP Pregnancy Dip Card/Strip and Cassette contains the same
test strip for home use and prescription use versions and identical testing results were
obtained for each version. The testing results from lab professionals are summarized in
