L. Test Principle:
This is a competitive assay with an assay time of 18 minutes.
First incubation: 15 μL of sample is combined with a T4‑specific antibody labeled with a
sulfonyl‑ruthenium complex.
Second incubation: After addition of biotinylated T4 and streptavidin-coated microparticles,
the still‑free binding sites of the labeled antibody become occupied, with formation of an
antibody‑hapten complex. The entire complex becomes bound to the solid phase via
interaction of biotin and streptavidin.
The reaction mixture is then aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are
magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are then
removed with ProCell/ProCell M. Application of a voltage to the electrode then induces

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The repeatability (within-run) and intermediate precision (total) of the Elecsys FT4 II
assay were evaluated on one cobas e 411 Immunoassay Analyzer referencing the
CLSI EP5-A2 guideline. Five human serum samples and two levels of control
material were analyzed. The protocol consisted of testing 2 replicates of each human
serum sample and control per run, two (2) runs per day for 21 days.

concentrations (11 dilutions) throughout the measuring range were prepared. All
samples were assayed in triplicate within a single run. All three linearity sets
generated similar results and one representative set is presented below. Linearity was
evaluated using first, second and third polynomial regression analysis based on CLSI
EP6-A. The coefficient of the third order polynomial regression was found to be
significant; therefore, calculation of the third order model was used to demonstrate
linearity from 0.095 to 8.20 ng/dL and a results summary is shown in the table below.
The linear regression line was y = 0.9752x + 0.0622

Calibrator Stability:
When stored unopened at 2 - 8ºC the shelf life for the calibrators is 18 months. After
opening, the calibrators are stable for 12 weeks when stored at 2 – 8° C. Onboard the
cobas e 411, the calibrators are stable for up to 5 hours at 20° C. The stability
protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be adequate.
Value assignment for the calibrators:
The Elecsys FT4 II Calset is value assigned based on an internal value assignment
procedure using the master calibrators as the reference value. The kit calibrator
(CalSet) values are assigned by reading their respective concentrations from the
master calibration curve. The assigned value for each level of the CalSet is the
median over a minimum of 6 determinations. Kit calibrator (CalSet) values are
assigned for each instrument platform. Examples of the target value for calibrator 1
and 2 are shown in the table below.
Level Target Value
Calibrator 1 0.78 ng/dL
Calibrator 2 3.5 ng/dL
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank, Limit of Detection and Limit of Quantitation were evaluated
referencing CLSI EP17 – A2.
The Limit of Blank (LoB) is the 95th percentile value from 60 measurements of
analyte‑free samples over several independent series. The LoB corresponds to the
concentration below which analyte‑free samples are found with a probability of 95%
and was determined to be 0.03 ng/dL.
The Limit of Detection (LoD) is determined based on the Limit of Blank and the
standard deviation of low concentration samples. The LoD corresponds to the lowest
analyte concentration which can be detected (value above the LoB with a probability
of 95%) and was determined to be 0.05 ng/dL.
The Limit of Quantitation (functional sensitivity) is the lowest analyte concentration
that can be reproducibly measured with an intermediate precision CV of ≤ 20 % and
was determined to be 0.1 ng/dL. Values measured as less than 0.1 ng/dL will be
reported as < 0.1 ng/dL.

The FT4 II assay has a measuring range of 0.1 to 7.77 ng/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
1. Endogenous substances
The effect of endogenous substances was evaluated on the e 411 Analyzer
using pooled human serum samples spiked with L-Thyroxine. For each
potential interferent, three serum samples containing low, mid, and high
concentrations of fT4 were analyzed. For all substances tested, no significant
interference was defined as recovery ± 10% of initial value. The potential
interferents and the highest concentration tested which did not cause
significant interference are listed below:

biotin 20 ng/mL
albumin 6.3 g/dL
IgG 7 g/dL
IgA 1.6 g/dL
IgM 1 g/dL
Rheumatoid Factor 1200 IU/mL
2. Structurally similar substances
The effect of structurally similar substances was determined using human
serum samples spiked with potential cross-reactant compounds and analyzed
in duplicate on the e 411 Analyzer. For all substances tested, no significant
interference was defined as recovery ± 10% of initial value. The following
cross-reactivities were found at FT4 concentrations of approximately 0.974
ng/dL and 2.66 ng/dL:

Theophylline 100 µg/mL
Thiamazole 80 µg/mL
In in vitro studies the drugs Furosemide and Levothyroxine caused elevated Free T4
findings at the daily therapeutic dosage level. In rare cases, interference due to
extremely high titers of antibodies to analyte‑specific antibodies, streptavidin or
ruthenium can occur. Cautions regarding Furosemide, Levothyroxine, analyte -
specific antibodies, streptavidin and ruthenium are stated in the labeling.
The sponsor also has the following limitation in their labeling:
“Any influence that might affect the binding behavior of the binding proteins can
alter the result of the FT4 tests (e.g. drugs, NTIs (Non Thyroid Illness), patients
suffering from FDH (Familial Dysalbuminemic Hyperthyroxinemia) or increased
TBG in pregnancy.”
“Samples should not be taken from patients receiving therapy with high biotin doses
(i.e. > 5 mg/day) until at least 8 hours following the last biotin administration.”
“The test cannot be used in patients receiving treatment with lipid-lowering agents
containing D-T4. If the thyroid function is to be checked in such patients, the therapy
should first be discontinued for 4-6 weeks to allow the physiological state to become
re- established.”

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed with 170 human serum samples with
concentrations ranging from 0.161 to 7.05 ng/dL. Eleven samples were spiked to
produce high concentrations and four samples were diluted to produce low
concentrations. The comparison of the Elecsys FT4 II assay (y) with the predicate
device, Elecsys FT4 assay (x), produced the following correlation:
Linear regression y = 1.02x - 0.075 r = 0.996

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Euthyroid: 0.93‑1.7 ng/dL
The reference range was established according to the CLSI C28-A3 guideline Defining,
Establishing and Verifying Reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory; based on the
capability of transferring the predicate device’s reference range to the candidate device’s
reference range because of the comparability of the two testing systems. Sponsor
followed the transferability guidance and verification procedure of the CLSI and has
confirmed that the established reference range from the predicate device is transferable to
the candidate device using 60 apparently healthy subjects (30 males and 30 females) with
a normal TSH value. The reference range was previously established in k961489 for the
predicate device by conducting a reference range study using 801apparently healthy
subjects.
The sponsor also states that each laboratory should investigate the transferability of the
expected values to its own patient population and if necessary determine its own
reference ranges in the labeling.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
