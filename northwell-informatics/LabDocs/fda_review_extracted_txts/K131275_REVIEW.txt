I. Device Description:
MicroScan Dried Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panels are designed for use in determining
quantitative and/or qualitative antimicrobial agent susceptibility of colonies grown on
solid media of rapidly growing aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-positive bacteria.
The antimicrobial susceptibility tests are miniaturizations of the broth dilution
susceptibility test that have been diluted in broth and dehydrated. Antimicrobial agents
are diluted in broth to concentrations bridging the range of clinical interest. The
MicroScan Dried Gram-Positive Panel evaluated in this submission contained ten
doubling dilutions of Tigecycline from 0.015 to 8 mcg/mL.
Panels are rehydrated with water after inoculation with a standardized suspension of the
organism. After incubation in a non-CO incubator for 16-20 hours, the minimum
2
inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the test organism is read by determining the lowest
antimicrobial concentration showing inhibition of growth. The panels can be read
manually using the MicroSCAN Microdilution Viewer or on automated MicroSCAN
instrumentation (autoSCAN-4 or WalkAway systems).
Tigecycline is a glycycline antibiotic and a derivative of Tetracycline. Tigecycline
inhibits protein synthesis by preventing t-RNA from binding to the ribosome. This
prevents incorporation of amino acid residues into elongating peptide chains. Tigecycline
is indicated for treatment of complicated bacterial skin and skin structure infections,
complicated intra-abdominal infections and community-acquired pneumonia, when cased
by designated susceptible bacteria.

Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial
Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard – Ninth Edition.
CLSI document M07-A9. 2012.
L. Test Principle:
The antimicrobial susceptibility tests are miniaturizations of the broth dilution susceptibility
test which have been dehydrated. Various antimicrobial agents are diluted in Mueller-Hinton
broth with calcium and magnesium to concentrations bridging the range of clinical interest.
After inoculation and rehydration with a standardized suspension of organism and incubation
at 35˚ C for 16-20 hours, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) or a qualitative
susceptibility (Susceptible, Intermediate or Resistant) for the test organism is determined by
observing the lowest antimicrobial concentration showing inhibition of growth.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility data for nine S. aureus isolates (eight challenge isolates and one QC
strain) including six methicillin-susceptible and three methicillin-resistant isolates,
and three E. faecalis isolates (two challenge isolates and one QC strain) were
generated at 3 clinical trial sites. Organism selection was based on the intended use
of the antimicrobic. Each strain was tested at each site in triplicate over three days
using 2 inoculation methods (Turbidity and Prompt) and 3 reading methods (manual,
WalkAway Instrument and autoSCAN-4 Instrument).
The mode of the test panel MIC results was determined for each isolate. MIC results
at each site were compared to the mode value for each strain. Results were considered
in agreement if the test panel MIC was equal to or within ± 1 dilution of the mode for
that isolate. Agreement was calculated assuming any off-scale results were within one
well from the mode (best case) and by assuming any off-scale results were greater
than one well from the mode (worst case). Data were analyzed for all 10 dilutions of
Tigecycline (0.015 - 8 mcg/mL). The agreement was calculated for each site and for
the three sites combined.
All MIC results were on-scale for both inoculation methods and all reading methods;
therefore, best case and worst case scenarios were identical.
For each site and for all sites combined, agreement within 1 ± dilution from the mode
for all inoculation and reading methods was 100.0%. The reproducibility study
results are acceptable.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Quality Control: The recommended quality control isolates, S. aureus ATCC 29213
and E. faecalis ATCC 29212 were tested a sufficient number of times at all testing
sites using both the Turbidity and Prompt inoculation methods and all three reading
methods (Manual, WalkAway, autoScan4). Acceptable results were obtained for all
inoculation and reading methods (≥ 98.5 % of results within the acceptable range).
The Tigecycline quality control test results demonstrate that the system can produce
QC results within the expected range.
Data was analyzed for all 10 dilutions of Tigecycline contained in the test panels
(0.015 - 8 mcg/mL).
Dilutions of 0.12 - 8 µg/mL will be included in the marketed panels; this dilution
range will not cover the entire acceptable MIC range of the QC organisms as noted by
the CLSI and the FDA. The sponsor included the following footnote to the Dried
Gram Pos Antimicrobic Quality Control Table: “The MicroScan Gram Positive panel
does not include the full CLSI/FDA-recommended dilution ranges for QC testing of
Tigecycline.”

Growth Failure Rate: All isolates tested during the clinical (efficacy) trials grew in
both the frozen reference panel and the dried MicroScan panels.
Inoculum Density Check: The MicroScan Turbidity Meter (K864542) was used to
spectrophotometrically standardize the inocula for clinical isolates. The acceptable
turbidity range was 0.08 ± 0.02 (equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland barium sulfate
turbidity standard); the digital reading was recorded for each organism tested
ensuring that the reading was in the acceptable range.
Data was also collected during the Reproducibility phase for inocula prepared using
the Prompt inoculum preparation method. Colony counts were performed for each

The MicroScan Dried Gram-Positive MIC/Combo Panel with Tigecycline results
were compared to results obtained using a frozen broth microdilution reference panel
at three testing sites in the U.S. The reference panel was prepared according to CLSI
M07-A9 guidelines except for the use of Pluronic-F in the inoculum water for the
reference panel. Both the MicroScan and reference panels contained ten dilutions of
Tigecycline that were appropriate for the interpretive breakpoints of the drug. For
each organism tested, MIC panels were inoculated using the same standardized
suspension, further diluted into 25 mL of water with either Pluronic-D (for the
MicroScan dried panels) or Pluronic-F (for the frozen reference panels). Performance
was analyzed using FDA breakpoints for Tigecycline (except for S. epidermidis, for
which no FDA breakpoints exist), and results were compared based on the guidelines
provided in the Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial
Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems.
A validation study was performed to demonstrate equivalence between reference
panels inoculated with organisms suspended in water supplemented with Pluronic-F
and reference panels inoculated with autoclaved distilled water without Pluronic-F.
Eight isolates of S. aureus and two isolates of E. faecalis were tested. The essential
agreement of MICs obtained using Pluronic-F as the diluent as compared to MICs
obtained using autoclaved distilled water as the diluent was 100%.
A total of 399 clinical isolates were tested at three clinical sites. The organisms tested
consisted of E. faecalis, vancomycin-susceptible (47 fresh isolates), S. aureus (305
isolates including 288 fresh and 17 stock isolates) and S. epidermidis (47 fresh
isolates). Clinical isolates were evaluated using the turbidity inoculation method and
read manually.
8

--- Page 9 ---
A total of 75 challenge strains were tested at one clinical site. Challenge strains
included 59 isolates of S. aureus (41 MSSA, 15 MRSA, 3 SA) and 16 isolates of
vancomycin-susceptible E. faecalis. Challenge strains were selected from a variety of
sources and had on-scale MICs as determined by the reference method. Results
obtained with tigecycline in the MicroScan panels were compared to expected results.
Expected results were determined from the mode result obtained from 18 replicates of
each isolate tested using a frozen reference panel prepared using CLSI M07-A9
guidelines. Challenge isolates were tested using inocula prepared using both the
turbidity method and the Prompt Inoculation System. MIC results were read using
three methods: manual read, WalkAway Instrument and autoSCAN-4 Instrument.
In the FDA pharmaceutical labeling Tigecycline is listed as being active in vitro
against S. epidermidis but the clinical significance unknown. In addition, there are no
FDA or CLSI interpretive breakpoints for Tigecycline and S. epidermidis. The
MicroScan product labeling was modified to indicate the absence of breakpoints for
S. epidermidis and to list the performance of Tigecycline with S. epidermidis (using
breakpoints for S. aureus) and without S. epidermidis. For ease of reporting, in this
document, performance of Tigecycline with S. epidermidis was determined using S.
aureus breakpoints unless otherwise noted.
The sponsor originally submitted data in a “mapped” format which truncated the
range of evaluated Tigecycline concentrations to 0.12 - 8 µg/mL. With the mapped
format, the overall EA was 96.2%. However, mapping reduced the number of
evaluable results, limiting FDA’s ability to assess EA based on evaluable results.
FDA requested that results be re-evaluated using the long dilution format.
Using the long dilution format (spanning the entire dilution range of 0.015 - 8
µg/mL), the overall essential agreement of MIC values obtained for MicroScan Dried
Gram Positive Tigecycline using turbidity inoculation preparation and manual read
did not meet acceptable performance for a quantitative claim.
Of a total of 474 clinical and challenge isolates tested (including S. aureus,
vancomycin-susceptible E. faecalis and S. epidermidis), 369 (77.8%) were in
essential agreement with the CLSI broth microdilution reference method. A total of
469 isolates yielded on-scale MICs; 366 (78.0%) of the isolates with on-scale MICs
were in essential agreement with the reference method. The on-scale MIC results
were evaluated for MIC trends and the following results were obtained when
MicroScan results were compared to the reference method: 78.0% (366/469) were
within ± one doubling dilution; 21.3% (100/469) of the MicroScan MICs were higher
by more than one doubling dilution; 0.6% (3/469) of the MicroScan MICs were lower
by more than one doubling dilution. The MicroScan product labeling was modified to
include this information.
Using the long dilution format, combined results from clinical and challenge studies
demonstrated an overall categorical agreement (CA) of 99.4% (471/474) for the
turbidity inoculation preparation method with manual read. The overall percent CA
9

--- Page 10 ---
meets the acceptance criteria of greater than or equal to 90% and supports the claim
for qualitative testing of Tigecycline.
Excluding S. epidermidis, the overall essential agreement (including clinical and
challenge isolates) for MicroScan Dried Gram Positive Tigecycline using turbidity
inoculation preparation and manual read was 78.0% (333/427) and categorical
agreement was 99.3% (424/427).
According to the approved drug label for Tigecycline, only a susceptible interpretive
category is defined. There are no intermediate or resistant breakpoints. In this study
two MRSA clinical isolates were determined to be resistant to Tigecycline by the
reference method. MicroScan results were susceptible for one of these isolates. Even
though the approved drug label does not define “non-susceptible” breakpoints, FDA
considered this to be a potential very major error. The sponsor included a limitation
referencing the potential very major error when testing S. aureus with Tigecycline.
A total of 75 challenge isolates were tested using the Prompt inoculation method and
read using three methods: manual, WalkAway and autoSCAN-4. Results were
compared to results obtained with the reference method. Overall categorical
agreement was 97.3% for all methods. The EA obtained for challenge isolates
inoculated using the Prompt inoculation method and analyzed using the long dilution
format was unacceptably low for S. aureus and results showed potential major errors.
The labeling indicates that the turbidity standard method provides the most accurate
inoculum for staphylococcal isolates and is the preferred method of inoculation. The
labeling indicates that the Prompt System demonstrated potential major errors with
Tigecycline and staphylococci.
The performance evaluation summary of categorical agreement results for challenge
and clinical isolates with inocula prepared using the turbidity method and read
manually is shown in the tables below.

Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the result of the reference
method and that of MicroScan within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution of the
antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that are on scale for both the MicroScan panel and the
reference method. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the interpretation of the result of
the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the MicroScan result.
Categorical agreement for challenge isolates with inocula prepared using the turbidity method
were also determined using the WalkAway instrument and the autoScan-4 instrument. In
addition, challenge isolates were tested using inocula prepared using the Prompt System and
read by all three methods (manual, WalkAway, and autoScan-4). Results are summarized in
the following table:

Prompt Hold Study: An internal study was performed to determine the agreement of
results obtained with the Prompt inoculation method using hold times of 0 hours and
4 hours prior to inoculation of the panels. Results of 4-hour holds were compared to
0-hour hold using the same inoculum and with expected results as determined by the
reference method. Testing was performed with all three read methods. While
categorical agreement with all methods and hold times was acceptable, potential
major or very major errors were noted for S. aureus with each method inoculated
after extended hold times.
The MicroScan product labeling indicates that the turbidity inoculum preparation
method provides the most accurate inoculum, and is the preferred method for
preparation of inocula for Staphylococcus isolates and certain antimicrobial agents.
Additional limitations were incorporated in the labeling specific to the use of the
Prompt System with Tigecycline and other antimicrobials.

a There are no intermediate or resistant interpretive criteria for Tigecycline. The current
absence of resistant isolates precludes defining any results other than “Susceptible.”
Isolates yielding MIC results suggestive of the “Nonsusceptible” category should be
submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.
S = Susceptible; I = Intermediate; R = Resistant; N/A = Not Applicable
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports
a substantial equivalence decision
