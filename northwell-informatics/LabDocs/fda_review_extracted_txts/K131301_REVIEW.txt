BD FACS™ Sample Prep Assistant III
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Specimen Processor
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The BD FACS™ Sample Prep Assistant III (SPA III) is a microprocessor-controlled
pipetting and diluting system which automatically prepares whole blood samples using
the lyse / no-wash sample preparation method for flow cytometry. Used as an accessory
to the BD FACSCalibur™ and BD FACSCanto™ II flow cytometers, the SPA III
combines fluidic, optic, robotic, and electronic components to automatically prepare
samples for acquisition and analysis.
The SPA III pierces the sample tube cap to withdraw sample, aliquots blood and reagent
into daughter tubes, and mixes the sample according to preprogrammed protocols. The
device also adds lysing solution and automates cleaning procedures.
The unit consists of an enclosure, one robotic pipetting module moving in the X/Y/Z
axes, a power supply, a central controller unit, fluid pumps, and a barcode reader.
2. Principles of Operation:
Two syringe pumps volumetrically measure fluids and move them through the system for
aspiration and delivery.
3. Modes of Operation:
Automated
4. Specimen Identification:
Manual entry or bar code reader.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimens are whole blood specimens collected into approved tubes
6. Calibration:

Assay Precision:
Precision was assessed based on Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical
Chemistry Devices; Approved Guideline, CLSI document EP5-A2.
Pipetting precision was assessed gravimetrically for the BD-defined Multitest
protocol using normal donor blood, BD Multi-Check process control, reagent buffer
(to represent reagent). The performance for pipetting blood was found to be within
the manufacturer’s specifications of 50 µL ± 3% and the performance for pipetting
reagent was found to be within the manufacturer’s specifications of 20 µL ± 7%.
Precision of the staining and lysing of samples was also assessed. This was
demonstrated by measuring the closeness of agreement between independent
test/measurement results obtained under stipulated conditions. These conditions
include multiple operators (3), multiple instruments (3 SPA III), and duration of
testing (21 days) run twice daily in duplicate. The study samples were CD-Chex
normal (CDN) and CD-Chex CD4 low (CDL) stained with BD Multitest 6-Color
TBNK Reagent in BD Trucount Tubes. Measurements for this study were the
absolute counts and percentages of the following lymphocyte subsets: CD3+CD4+,
CD3+CD8+, CD3+, CD3-CD19+ and CD3-CD16+CD56+. The manufacturer’s
acceptance criteria were as follows:
Absolute counts:
95% upper CI on the CV: ≤ 10% for CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+
95% upper CI on the CV: ≤ 20% for CD19+ and CD16+56+
Percent positives:
95% upper CI on the SD: ≤ 2.5
Study results indicate that the device performed according to the manufacturer’s
acceptance criteria.
Conclusion: This study confirms that the SPA III system aspirates and dispenses
specified volumes of blood and reagent accurately and precisely.

d. Carryover:
Sample Carryover
Carryover was assessed based on recommendations contained in Class II Special
Controls Guidance Document: Premarket Notifications for Automated Differential
Cell Counters for Immature or Abnormal Blood Cells; Final Guidance for Industry
and FDA, December 4, 2001.
Sample carryover was tested using three donors (in duplicate) on three SPA III
instruments by running three consecutive high cell count samples followed by three
consecutive low cell count samples. The carryover acceptance criterion was
carryover ≤ 0.2%. High cell count samples (≥ 50,000 WBC/µL) were prepared by
addition of autologous RBC-lysed whole blood. Low cell counts samples (400 ± 200
WBC/µL) were prepared by dilution with buffer (PBS). Comparison between the
gold standard of manual pipetting and SPA III was done with three instruments using

three normal donor samples run twice per day [as Replicates 1 and 2 (Rep1 and
Rep2)]. Samples were stained with the pan-leucocyte marker CD45 in BD Trucount
Tubes.
Sample carryover was calculated using the following formula:
% carryover = [(First Low – Third Low)/(Third High – Third Low)]*100
from “Guidelines for the Evaluation of Blood Cell Analysers including those
use for Differential Leucocyte and Reticulocyte Counting and Cell Marker
Applications,” Clinical Laboratory Haematology 16: 157-174 [1994].
% carryover = [(First Low – Third Low)/(Third High – First Low)]*100
from CLSI (formerly known as NCCLS) Guideline H52-A “Approved
Guideline for Fetal Red Cell Detection.”
These studies. when analyzed analyzed using both carryover formulae indicated that
the device performed within the manufacturer’s specification of <0.2%.
Reagent Carryover
Reagent carryover was assessed by determining carryover of reagent to buffer for
reagent tube to reagent tube carryover and for secondary specimen tube to secondary
specimen tube. The acceptance criteria was carryover < 0.01%. High cell count
samples (≥ 50,000 WBC/µL) were used and were prepared by addition of autologous
RBC-lysed blood. Comparison between manual pipetting and SPA III was done with
three instruments using six donor samples run twice per day [as Replicates 1 and 2
(Rep1 and Rep2)]. The reagent dispensed was BD Multitest 6-Color TBNK Reagent
(three donors) for CD45+ cells or BD Leucocount (three donors) for White Blood
Cells (WBCs).
