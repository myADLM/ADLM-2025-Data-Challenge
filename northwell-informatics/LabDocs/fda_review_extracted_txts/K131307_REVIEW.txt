L. Test Principle:
In the ADVIA® Chemistry Fructosamine (FRUC) assay, Reagent 1 contains proteinase K,
which digests the glycated protein to yield glycated protein fragments. Fructosaminase in
Reagent 2 oxidizes the ketoamine bond of the glycated protein fragments. As a result,
hydrogen peroxide is released and it is involved in a colorimetric Trinder end-point reaction.
The amount of color developed and measured at 596 nm is proportional to the concentration
of glycated protein in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed in accordance with the CLSI EP5-A2 guideline.
Within run and total imprecision were assessed by testing a serum-based
commercially available 2-level control with approximate fructosamine concentrations
of 150 and 400 µmol/L. Five additional serum pools spiked with fructosamine antigen
containing concentrations ranging from 60-736 µmol/L were also tested, where each

sample was tested in replicates of two, twice daily for 20 days (n=80). Two ADVIA
1650 analyzers and 2 lots of ADVIA fructosamine reagents and calibrators were used
in the study. Results of both reagent lots are shown below:

Additionally, imprecision at the low end of the assay was estimated from a separate
study, using 2 low fructosamine pools (30-50 μmol/L) tested twice daily with 2
reagent lots, 2 ADVIA 1650 analyzers and 4 replicates/run over 5 days (total 40-
replicates/sample). Results of both reagent lots are shown below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed using 9 diluted samples with fructosamine
concentrations evenly distributed throughout the assay range using 2 lots of reagent
and one lot of calibrator. Samples were prepared from a high serum pool spiked with
human fructosamine (~1070 μmol/L) and low analyte serum pools (fructosamine
concentration below 30 μmol/L) to cover the assay range by dilution. The range of
samples tested was 27-1070 μmol/L. The observed values versus the expected values
range from 100.0-107.4% for both reagent lots.
The linear regression equation is as follows:
y=0.99x+4.1, r= 1.0
The study supports that the fructosamine assay is linear across the range of 30 to 1000
µmol/L.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The ADVIA® Chemistry Fructosamine assay is traceable to an internal standard
manufactured using highly purified fructosamine, referred to as the master lot. The
master lot was prepared by spiking the appropriate amounts of stock solution
containing pure fructosamine antigen into a human serum matrix. The master lot was
subsequently value assigned as noted below.
Value Assignment:
The initial lot of calibrator materials (master lot) was value assigned through a
correlation study using control and patient samples with values determined using the
ADVIA fructosamine assay on the ADVIA 1650 system and Randox fructosamine
assay on the Hitachi 717. Based on the correlation study with this method, the
fructosamine values for the Master Lot were established. All subsequent lots are
value assigned against the Master Lot on the ADVIA 1650 system.
Stability:
Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed for the shelf life and closed vial
stability of the ADVIA Fructosamine Chemistry Calibrator and found to be
acceptable. Reagent: On-board reagent stability is 60 days. The shelf life of the
ADVIA Chemistry Fructosamine Reagent is 12 months at 2-8°C. For unopened
product, see the expiration date on the reagent carton. Calibrator: for opened
products, once the cap is removed, assigned values are stable for 28 days when
recapped immediately after use and stored at 2-8°C. The shelf life of the ADVIA
Chemistry Fructosamine Calibrator is 12 months at 2-8°C. For unopened product, see
the expiration date on the calibrator carton.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined by assaying
a serum-like pool and low fructosamine samples according to CLSI EP17-A. The
serum-like pool was prepared in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing NaCl,
100 mg/dL glucose, 6% human albumin and 1% human immunoglobulin. The low
fructosamine LoB pool was spiked with known concentrations of analyte ranging
from 18 to 46 µmol/L. LoB and LoD determinations were based on 4 replicate
measurements assessed twice daily, using 2 reagent lots over 5 days for a total of 40
replicates/reagent lot (N=80) on the ADVIA 1650 instrument. The observed LoB and
LoD values are 15 and 21, respectively.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference in the fructosamine assay was evaluated using 3 human serum pools with
6

--- Page 7 ---
fructosamine concentrations of approximately 150, 250 and 1000 µmol/L and spiked
with various interferents. The levels for testing were prepared by diluting the pool
with the highest concentration of interferent with the same pool without interferent
(control). Five equally spaced dilutions were tested for each interferent and assayed in
duplicate using one reagent lot on one ADVIA 1650 system. The following
interferents were tested: Bilirubin (unconjugated and conjugated), hemoglobin,
lipemia (from triglyceride concentrate), abscorbic acid, glucose and uric acid. The
effect of albumin and total blood protein was evaluated by spiking fructosamine into
unaltered human patient serum samples with varying levels of albumin (2.8-6.1 g/dL)
or total protein (3.2-8.4 g/dL). The assay was considered to have no significant
interference if the bias between control and observed fructosamine concentration
containing interferent does not exceed 10%. The level at which there is no significant
interference for each analyte is listed below:
Interferent Concentration at Which No
Significant Interference Observed
(mg/dL):
Bilirubin (conjugated) 5
Bilirubin (unconjugated) 5
Hemoglobin 250
Lipemia 1000
Abscorbic Acid 10

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 113 human serum samples were obtained for the method comparison study.
One hundred and ten samples in total were tested, with 10 samples diluted with a zero
analyte serum pool to achieve concentrations throughout the assay range. However, 3
samples were not tested since fructosamine concentrations exceeded the analytical
measuring range, leaving 110 samples for analysis. All 110 samples were tested in
duplicate using the ADVIA fructosamine assay on the ADVIA 1650 Chemistry
system and the Diazyme Glycated Serum Protein Enzymatic Assay Kit on the
Olympus AU640. The linear regression analysis using the first set of replicates is
summarized below:
