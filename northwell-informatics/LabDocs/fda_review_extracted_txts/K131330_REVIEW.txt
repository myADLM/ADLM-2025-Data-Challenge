L. Test Principle:
The Antinuclear Antibody (ANA) Screen ELISA Test kit is an enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay where natural and recombinant Extractable Nuclear Antigens (ENAs)
are collectively bound to microwells in polystyrene microtiter plates. Human serum
containing ANA (IgG) antibodies is added to the wells and any ANAs bind to their cognate
antigen(s). After incubation, the wells of the plate are washed to remove unbound serum
components and non-ANA IgGs. A detection antibody conjugated with HRP is added to
detect human IgG antibodies bound to antigens on the microtiter well. After an incubation
period, the wells of the plate are washed to remove unbound enzyme-labeled anti-human
IgG. Upon its addition to the washed wells the substrate TMB is converted by bound
enzyme-conjugate antibody producing a blue end product. The Stop Solution is an acid that
stops the reaction and turns the substrate yellow. The amount of color produced is
proportional to the amount of antibody is present in the patient serum.
The antigens used in the Screen ELISA Test are a lysed HEp-2 cell extract with added
purified antigens. The assay collectively detects in one well antibodies against double
stranded DNA (dsDNA), SSA (Ro60 and Ro52), SSB (La), Sm, Sm/RNP, Scl-70, Jo-1,
Ribosomal P, and Centromeric antibodies along with antibodies with reactivity against HEp-
2 cells.
Optical density values read by the spectrophotometer are converted into 3 categories based
upon a ratio of optical density of the samples (or controls) to the optical density of a cutoff
control reagent present in the assay kit. Three result categories are determined by optical
density ratio values as follows:

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Assessment of the repeatability of the assay was performed on seven samples; three
positive samples, one equivocal sample, and three negative samples. One positive
sample was diluted with normal human serum to give a unit value 20% above the
positive ratio cutoff (1.36 U). The other two positive samples gave assay units
approximately 2.56 and 5.60. One negative sample was diluted to 20% below the
negative cutoff ratio (approximately 0.70 units). The other two negative samples
gave assay units approximately 0.3 and 0.15. Each sample was tested twice a day for
ten days for a total of 20 replicates. All the observed results matched the expected
results. The results, presented as ratio Units, are summarized in the following table:
Repeatability:

7 0.16 0.12–0.20 Negative 100%
The reproducibility of the assay (between-lab imprecision) was done by testing three
samples in duplicate for five days, twice a day, at three sites with two technicians per
site for a total of 60 replicates. The mean results, reported as ratio Units, are
summarized in the table below:

Traceability:
There is no recognized standard or reference material, so the assay is calibrated in
arbitrary units. Each new lot of the cutoff control is traceable to an internal master
control.
Positive and Negative Control:
Positive control was prepared from a pool of eight pathological sera obtained from
various plasma brokers determined to be positive for ANAs by HEp-2
immunofluorescence. Negative control was prepared by diluting the positive control
pool 100-fold with sample diluent and protein stabilizer. The package insert states
that the negative control must have an OD of <0.15; the positive control must have an
OD of 0.6 to 1.6.
Cut-off Control:
Cutoff controls are derived from a pool of eight pathological sera obtained from
various plasma brokers determined to be positive by HEp-2 immunofluorescence.
The cutoff control is prepared by diluting the serum pool with analyte-free serum to
the appropriate concentration. The OD value of the cutoff control is compared with
the master cutoff control. The unit ratio (OD cutoff control / OD master cutoff
control) during the in-house QC procedure has to be 0.87 – 1.15. Each new lot of the
cutoff controls, which are prepared by dilution of the pool stock, is compared with the
master control and must meet the pre-specified acceptance criteria. Further, a set of
12 sera representing the antigen specificities is measured for each new lot of the
controls and have to fall within their pre-specified ranges (which was obtained from
several tests with different lots).
Calibrators: Not applicable
Stability: The sponsor provided data demonstrating real-time stability of an opened
kit for 6 months when stored at 2-8°C.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
The effect of endogenous substances in serum specimens that could cause
interference with the ANA ELISA Screen Test was evaluated. Five samples ranging
from 1.4 to 2.5 U were spiked with the concentrations of hemoglobin, bilirubin,
rheumatoid factor and triglycerides indicated below. The recovery in relation to the
un-spiked sample without interferent was calculated. In addition, to assess the
interference in the assay from heterophilic antibodies, two samples were spiked with
three concentrations of HAMA type 1 antibody. The recommended concentrations
from the guideline “Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry” from the Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute were used (CLSI EP7-A2). The tested substances as
listed below did not affect the performance of the ELISA Screen Test.

The cutoff was determined by testing 99 normal blood donors and three known
negative samples. The mean value plus three standard deviations of the negative
samples was established as the cutoff. To encourage a repeat testing of samples close
to the cutoff, an equivocal range of ± 20% of the cutoff was established.

A comparison of the performance of the test device and the predicate was performed
at three different sites using a total of 848 samples. The sera used for this study were

Not applicable.
1) Expected values/Reference range:
The expected value is negative; however, it is known that a certain percentage of NHS
will be positive. In the sponsor’s cutoff study, of the 99 samples from normal healthy
donors, two were positive, for a prevalence of ANAs in the healthy population detected
by this assay of 7%. The results are presented below.
