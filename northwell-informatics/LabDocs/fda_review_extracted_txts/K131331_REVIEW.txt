H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System is intended for the in vitro rapid
identification (ID) of gram positive bacteria from pure culture belonging to the genera
Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, other gram positive cocci and gram positive bacilli. The
BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System is also intended for the quantitative
determination of antimicrobial susceptibility by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)
of most gram positive bacteria isolates from pure culture belonging to the genera
Staphylococcus and Enterococcus.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is intended for in vitro quantitative
determination of antimicrobial susceptibility by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)
of most Gram-negative aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria isolates from pure
culture for Enterobacteriaceae and Non-Enterobacteriaceae and most Gram-positive
bacteria isolates from pure culture belonging to the genera Staphylococcus, Enterococcus
and Streptococcus.
This premarket notification is for a modification of a portion of the algorithm for
Vancomycin (0.5-32 μg/mL) with Enterococcus species and Staphylococcus species and
updates for software from the last software cleared by FDA under K040099 through
version 6.01.
Vancomycin has been shown to be active in vitro against most strains of microorganisms
listed below, as described in the FDA-approved package insert for this antimicrobial
agent.
Active In Vitro and in Clinical Infections Against:
Enterococci (e.g., Enterococcus faecalis)
Staphylococci, including Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis
(including heterogeneous methicillin-resistant strains).

I. Device Description:
This submission is for the AST Panel only. The ID system was not reviewed.
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and software,
sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells containing dried
reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for ID and AST indicator. The organism
to be tested must be a pure culture and be preliminarily identified as gram positive or gram
negative. Colonies are then suspended in broth, and equated to a 0.5 McFarland with the
recommendation to use BD nephelometer devices. A further dilution is made into an AST
broth, which turns to blue after AST broth indicator is added prior to inoculating the panel.
The AST broth is a cation-adjusted formulation of Mueller-Hinton broth containing 0.01%
Tween 80, and has a final inoculum of approximately 5 x 105 CFU/mL. After inoculation and
incubation, the color changes to pink then to colorless as reduction in the panel well
proceeds. Inoculated panels are barcode scanned and loaded into the BD Phoenix™
Automated Microbiology System instrument where the panels are incubated at 35°C and
continuously measured of changes to the indicator as well as bacterial turbidity to determine
the bacterial growth in the presence of an antimicrobial agent. Organisms growing in the
presence of a given antimicrobial agent reduce the indicator, signaling organism growth and
resistance to the antimicrobial agent. Organisms killed or inhibited by a given antimicrobial
do not cause reduction of the indicator and therefore do not produce a color change.
Additional interpretation is done using software driven “EXPERT” System using rules
derived from the CLSI documentation.
Readings are taken every 20 minutes with an AST result available between 4-16 hours. This
is only an autoread result; no manual readings are possible with this system.

L. Test Principle:
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth based microdilution method
that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-reduction) to enhance detection of
organism growth. The MIC is determined by comparing growth in wells containing serial
two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the growth in “growth control wells” which contains no
antibiotic.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing was performed at three sites (one internal and two external) in
triplicate on three separate days using inoculum prepared manually and inoculum
using the BD Phoenix AP. Inter-site and Intra-site testing demonstrated best-case
reproducibility of ≥95%.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The FDA and CLSI recommended QC isolates, E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and S.
aureus ATCC 29213 were with the reference method and the BD Phoenix™
Automated Microbiology System. Inoculum density was standardized by manual
(CrystalSpec or BD PhoenixSpec) or automated (BD Phoenix AP) methods. The BD
Phoenix™ was tested sufficient number of times to demonstrate that the system can
produce acceptable range results >95% of the time by both inoculum preparation
methods.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The broth dilution reference panel was prepared according to CLSI recommendation
and was used to compare with the BD Phoenix™ results. Clinical testing was
performed at three sites. The testing included both fresh clinical isolates and stock
isolates along with a challenge set with known results. The test device had a growth
rate of >90%. A comparison was provided to the reference method with the
following agreement.

Essential agreement (EA) is when the BD Phoenix™ panels agree with the reference test panel
results exactly or within one doubling dilution of the reference method. Category agreement (CA)
is when the BD Phoenix™ panel result interpretation agrees exactly with the reference panel result
interpretation. Evaluable EA is when the MIC result is on scale for both the BD Phoenix™ and the
reference and have on-scale EA.

There were a total of two very major discrepancies (1.6% discrepancy rate).
However, the acceptable number of discrepancy for 125 resistant isolates is three and
the two vmj discrepancies were within the acceptable limit.

Validation study
An additional validation study comprising of stock, recently acquired, and Network
on Antimicrobial Resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (NARSA) isolates was
conducted internally. The recently acquired isolates were clinical isolates obtained
from four external clinical sites. There were a total of 435 stock, 482 recently

E. faecalis: There were four major discrepancies with false resistance of >32µg/mL;
the major error rate was within the acceptable rate of 3%, at 1.6% (4/256).
E. faecium and other Enterococcus spp.: There were 304 E. faecium, five other
Enterococcus spp. isolates of >32µg/mL and one 32µg/mL for E. faecium. No major
or very major discrepancies were observed. The performance data met the
acceptance criteria.
Staphylococcus aureus: There were ten vancomycin resistant S. aureus (VRSA)
tested in the validation study, resulting in no very major discrepancies or major
discrepancies. However, there were five minor discrepancies at the breakpoint (BP)
of 4µg/mL for vancomycin intermediate (VI); the Phoenix result was one dilution
lower at 2µg/mL (susceptible) 27.8% (5/18) of the time. The following was included
in the Expert triggered rule when reporting vancomycin of 2µg/mL for S. aureus:
“Vancomycin intermediate isolates of S. aureus (VISA) with a reference method
MIC value of 4mcg/mL may be reported as having an MIC of 2mcg/mL. S.
aureus isolates with an MIC of 2 mcg/mL (susceptible) should have susceptibility
confirmed using a non-automated MIC method or by submission of the isolate to
a reference laboratory as appropriate.”
The results for S. epidermidis and coagulase-negative Staphylococci were acceptable.
