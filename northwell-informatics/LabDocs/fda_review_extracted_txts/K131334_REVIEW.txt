in human serum. The assay requires a total of 90 minutes incubation time. The test uses
microtiter wells coated with recombinant gG1 protein of HSV-1. Serum is added to each
well and incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C. If antibodies that recognize gG1 protein of HSV-
1 are present, they will bind to the antigen in the well. Unbound antibodies are removed by
washing the wells three times. A Horse Radish Peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-
human IgG (conjugate) is then added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C. If
antibodies against gG1 protein of HSV-1 are present in the patient’s serum, the conjugate
will bind to the antibody attached to the antigen on the well. The wells are again washed to
remove any unbound conjugate. In order to detect the bound conjugate, a substrate
containing tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) is added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes
at 37°C. If conjugate is present, the HRP will react with the substrate to generate a colored
product. After the incubation period, the reaction is stopped with a Stop Solution and the
color intensity is measured spectrophotometrically. The kit also includes a Wash Buffer,
Diluent, a Negative Control, Positive Control, and a Cut-off Control. The cut-off control is
used to determine the validity of the run assay and subsequently to determine the result of the
sample. Positive and negative controls are provided to determine if the assay is functioning
properly. The kit contains 12 x 8 well antigen coated microtiter strips in a frame. The
reagents are sufficient for 96 determinations.

minimum OD-values that are to be reached for the positive and the cut-off controls.
Only if the controls meet the requirements specified on the Quality Control
Certificates the assay is valid and results can be calculated.
Units of the cut-off controls are defined as 10 Units. The calculated units of the
positive controls should be within the ranges mentioned in the Quality Control
Certificate.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable since this is a qualitative test.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity:
Potential cross reactivity was evaluated using sera that were tested sero-positive for
CMV, EBV, VZV, Chlamydia trachomatis, Treponema pallidum, Human papilloma
virus (HPV), Rubella Virus, Toxoplasma gondii, Candida albicans, Neisseria
gonorrhea, Rheumatoid Factor, ANA, Measles Virus, HSV-2, HIV, and Bacteroides.
Ten serum samples for each possible cross-reacting antibody were tested in singlicate
(except for Bacterioides). Sera were obtained from serum brokers who confirmed
positivity for the disease and condition using FDA cleared tests. A total of 16
analytes were tested for possible cross reactivity with 151 samples. Samples were
tested on the Gold Standard Diagnostics Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 IgG ELISA

Test as well as on the predicate device. All but 11 samples were found to be
nonreactive (negative) in the Gold Standard Diagnostics Herpes Simplex Virus Type
1 IgG ELISA Test. The reactive samples were also reactive on the predicate device,
the Focus HerpeSelect 1 Immunoblot IgG, and may therefore represent true positive
samples.
Potential cross reactivity with sero-positive specimens against the vector used to
express the gG1 recombinant antigen was not assessed.
The results are summarized in the following table:

Interference (Endogenous substances):
The effect of potentially interfering endogenous substances on test results with the
Gold Standard Diagnostics Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 IgG ELISA Test was
evaluated. High levels of hemoglobin, bilirubin, cholesterol, triglycerides, and
albumin were tested in four different positive serum samples: one equivocal, one
weak positive, and two moderately positive sera. These samples were then divided
into two aliquots, one of which was treated with an interfering substance and tested in
triplicate along with the untreated samples. Test concentrations for the potential
endogenous interferents were used as recommended by the guideline “Interference
Testing in Clinical Chemistry” from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
(CLSI EP7-A2). The following substances did not affect the performance of the Gold
Standard Diagnostics Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 IgG ELISA Test when tested at

f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off was determined by testing 325 sera comprised of negative specimens,
positive specimens, and clinically characterized specimens. The samples were from
individuals with suspected HSV infection, pregnant women and sexually active adults
and were obtained from serum brokers. The cut-off was determined by testing the
samples on the Gold Standard Diagnostics HSV assay and on the predicate device.
The mean and standard deviation was established for the negative population. A
theoretical cut-off was established to maximize the overall percent agreement of the
device and the predicate. To encourage repeat testing of samples close to the cut-off,
an equivocal range of ±10% of the cut-off was established.
The placement of the assay’s cut-off was validated by comparison studies using
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The ROC analysis was performed
to compare the area under the curve (AUC) of the Gold Standard Diagnostics Herpes
Simplex Virus (HSV) Type 1 IgG ELISA Test Kit to that of the Focus Diagnostics
HSV 1 ELISA test using the Focus HSV Immunoblot as the standard. A total of 254
sera were tested in this validation study on all three assays. The AUC of the Gold
Standard Diagnostics Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Type 1 IgG ELISA Test Kit is
similar to the AUC of the Focus Diagnostics HSV Immunoblot. The observed cut-
offs of both assays are similar.
Based upon the results of this testing, the manufacturer established the following
guidelines for interpretation of patient samples:
Table 9: Result Interpretation
Units Result
< 9.0 negative
9.0 – 11.0 equivocal
> 11.0 positive
1. If the measured value is above the defined equivocal range, the result is
considered to be positive.
2. If the measured value is within the equivocal range, the sample should
be retested. If the result remains equivocal on the retest, the patient
should be considered suspect for infection.

3. If the measured value is below the defined equivocal range, no
measurable antigen specific antibodies are present in the samples. The
samples are considered to be negative.
The cut-off as established above was then applied to the prospectively collected
samples tested in the method comparison study (described in item 2 below) and
validated.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison was based on the results from the Gold Standard Diagnostics
Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 IgG ELISA Test compared to the results obtained from
the FDA cleared predicate, the HerpeSelect® 1 and 2 Immunoblot IgG from Focus
Diagnostics. The testing description and data are listed in the Clinical Study section
below (Section 3).
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable because only serum is claimed.

Performance in the Intended Use Populations:
The performance of the Gold Standard Diagnostics Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 IgG
ELISA assay was determined by conducting a correlation study with clinical samples that
were tested at three different sites. A total of 703 samples was used that were
representative of the intended use population, sexually active adults and pregnant women.
Of this total, 185 samples were from pregnant women and 518 samples were from
sexually active adults. The samples were prospectively collected, left-over, de-identified
specimens that had been submitted for HSV testing. Specimens were stored up to 48h at
4°C before testing. Those samples that were shipped to the internal testing site at Gold
Standard Diagnostics (101 samples from sexually active adults) were frozen at -20°C.
All samples were tested on the Gold Standard Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 IgG ELISA
assay and the predicate device. The combined results from all three sites are summarized
in Tables 11 and 12 according to the intended use population tested. Equivocal results
were treated as the worst case results (disagreement) for calculation of sensitivity and
specificity; confidence intervals (C.I.) were calculated using the exact method.

Performance in a Low Prevalence Population:
A total of 100 samples were requested to be collected from 16-19 year olds in a non-STD
setting. The samples of this low prevalence population were tested at only one of the
testing sites. They were prospectively collected, left-over, de-identified specimens.
Specimens were stored up to 48h at 4°C before testing. Calculation of sensitivity and
specificity with their respective confidence intervals was performed as described for the
intended use populations above.

Performance with a CDC Seroconversion Panel:
A seroconversion panel consisting of well-characterized HSV-1 serum samples was
obtained from the CDC and tested on the Gold Standard Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1
IgG ELISA assay. The seroconversion panel consisted of archived (frozen) samples that
were tested at only the internal testing site, Gold Standard Diagnostics. The panel
consisted of 50 HSV-1 IgG positive samples and 50 HSV-1 IgG negative samples. Note
that the use of the CDC panel does not imply endorsement of the assay by the CDC. The
results are summarized in Table 14. Calculation of sensitivity and specificity with their
respective confidence intervals was performed as described for the intended use
populations above.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The prevalence of HSV-1 IgG antibodies in the intended use populations of pregnant
women and sexually active adults was assessed internally and externally at two sites.
The assessment was based on the performance of the Gold Standard Diagnostics Herpes
Simplex Virus Type 1 IgG ELISA assay with the samples tested in the concordance
study. A total of 703 sera were tested. In the population of pregnant women (n=185), the
observed prevalence with the Gold Standard Diagnostics Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1
IgG ELISA assay was 53.5% (99/185). With the sexually active individuals (n=518) the
observed prevalence with the Gold Standard Diagnostics Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1
