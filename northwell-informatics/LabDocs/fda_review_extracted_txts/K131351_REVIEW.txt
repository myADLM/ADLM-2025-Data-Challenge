L. Test Principle:
In the ACE Alkaline Phosphatase Reagent assay, alkaline phosphatase catalyzes the
hydrolysis of colorless p-nitrophenyl phosphate to p-nitrophenol and inorganic
phosphate. In an alkaline solution (pH 10.5), p-nitrophenol is in the phenoxide form
and has a strong absorbance at 408 nm. The rate of increase in absorbance, monitored
bichromatically at 408 nm/486 nm, is directly proportional to the alkaline phosphatase
activity in the sample.
In the ACE Amylase Reagent assay, α-amylase hydrolyzes the 2-chloro-p-nitrophenyl-
α-D-maltotrioside substrate to release 2-chloro-p-nitrophenol and form 2-chloro-
pnitrophenyl-α-D-maltoside, maltotriose and glucose. The rate of increase in
absorbance, monitored bichromatically at 408 nm/ 647 nm, is directly proportional to
the α-amylase activity in the sample.
In the ACE ALT Reagent assay, alanine Aminotransferase converts the L-alanine and
α-ketoglutarate substrates in the reagent to L-glutamate and pyruvate. Lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) catalyzes the oxidation of the reduced cofactor to the cofactor.
The rate of conversion of the reduced cofactor to the cofactor can be determined by
monitoring the decrease in absorbance bichromatically at 340 nm/647 nm. This rate of
conversion from the reduced cofactor to the cofactor is a function of the activity of ALT in
the sample.
In the ACE AST Reagent assay, aspartate aminotransferase converts the L-aspartate
and α-ketoglutarate in the reagent to oxaloacetate and L-glutamate. The oxaloacetate
undergoes reduction with simultaneous oxidation of NADH to NAD in the malate
+
dehydrogenase catalyzed indicator reaction. NADH absorbs strongly at 340 nm,
whereas NAD does not. Therefore, the rate of conversion of NADH to NAD can be
+ +
determined by monitoring the decrease in absorbance bichromatically at 340 nm/647
nm. This rate of conversion from NADH to NAD is a function of the activity of AST
+
in the sample. Lactate dehydrogenase is added to prevent interference from endogenous
pyruvate, which is normally present in blood.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Serum samples were spiked with the appropriate analyte and used to determine linearity
on the ACE Alera Clinical Chemistry System. The assigned values of the highest and
lowest sample were set to their mean values. The assigned values of the other levels were
calculated by multiplying the mean value by the dilution proportions used. All samples
were run in triplicate. The linear regression correlation between the expected values and
the measured values is summarized below:
ACE Low level Upper level Linear Regression R2
Reagents tested tested Equation
ALP 4 U/L 1401 U/L y = 0.998x – 0.5 0.9993
Amylase 4 U/L 2012 U/L y = 1.013x + 0.2 0.9974
ALT 3.1 U/L 503.8U/L y = 1.007x - 0.17 0.9992
AST 3 U/L 491.3 U/L y = 1.013x + 0.24 0.99 92
The linearity data provided by the sponsor support the following reportable range claims:
Analyte tested Assay range
ALP (U/L) 9 - 1400
Amylase (U/L) 9 - 1900
ALT (U/L) 4 - 480
AST (U/L) 4 - 450
Automatic Dilution Study:
Sponsor performed additional auto-dilution studies to confirm the auto-dilution function
(1:2 for ALP and 1:4 for Amylase, ALT and AST) on the ACE Alera analyzer for plasma
and serum samples by comparing the auto-diluted results to the manual dilution results.
ALT, AST, ALP and Amylase samples recovered within ±10% bias.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The ALP assay and the Amylase assay are traceable to an IFCC traceable method.
The ALT assay is traceable to ERM-AD454 and the AST assay is traceable to ERM-
AD457.
Calibration is not needed for these four assays.

d. Detection limit:
The Limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantification (LoQ)
were determined according to CLSI EP17-A with the ACE Alera Clinical Chemistry
System. For the LoB and LoD studies, five low samples and five blanks (n=60 reps, 20
reps per day) were tested over three days on two ACE Alera Clinical Chemistry Systems.
For the LoQ studies, five samples (n = 40 reps, 8 reps per run) were tested in five
separate runs over five days. LoQ values are based on inter-assay precision of ≤20% CV.
The results are as follows:
ACE Alera ALP Amylase ALT AST
LoB (U/L) 2.8 0.2 1.6 2.2
LoD (U/L) 4.8 0.9 3.1 3.3
LoQ (U/L) 4.8 5.6 4.1 3.3
Sponsor claims the following measuring ranges for the assays:
Analyte Assay range
ALP (U/L) 9 - 1400
Amylase (U/L) 9 - 1900
ALT (U/L) 4 - 480
AST (U/L) 4 - 450
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed to determine the effects from potential interferents.
The various concentration of interferent was spiked into serum pools containing analytes
at normal and abnormal concentrations. All samples were tested in triplicate. Six
interferent levels and the control samples were tested for each interferent (n=7). For
lipemia interference studies, Intralipid was used as the added interferent with ALP
and Amylase, while avian triglycerides concentrate was used with ALT and AST.
Bias greater than +/- 10% defines significant interference by the sponsor. The results of
the highest concentration tested without significant interference are as follows:

Interferents on No Significant Interference at or below:

Lipemia 1000 mg/dL 1000 mg/dL 419 mg/dL 439 mg/dL
Ascorbic Acid 6 mg/dL 6 mg/dL 6 mg/dL 6 mg/dL
Limitations are included in the package insert to reflect these results. Since hemolysis
affects ALP, Amylase, and AST results, the sponsor has the following limitations in the
labeling:
“Specimens showing any indication of hemolysis should not be analyzed.”
For a comprehensive list of drugs and other substances which can affect assay in serum
please refer to the literature given by Young, et. Al.
Young, D.S., et.al., Effects of drugs on Clinical Laboratory Tests, 5th edition, AACC press,
Washington D.C. (2000).

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were completed at 3 POC sites following CLSI
document EP9-A2. Samples were run on the ACE Clinical Chemistry System
at Alfa Wassermann and the results were compared against those gathered on
ACE Alera Clinical Chemistry Systems at 3 Physician Office Labs. For each
test method, at least 40 determinations were made in singlicate for serum
samples drawn from the same individuals on each platform. To test across the
assay reportable ranges, 5-6 samples were spiked per analyte. No samples
were diluted with saline.

b. Matrix comparison:
A matrix comparison study was performed using paired serum/lithium heparin plasma
samples, with levels of each analyte that cover the measuring ranges of the assays, in
singlicate on the ACE, ACE Alera, and ACE Axcel Clinical Chemistry Systems. To
cover the assay range, 4-5 spiked samples were tested per analyte and 6 diluted samples
were tested for ALP. Linear regression analyses (Deming) were performed using serum
(x) and lithium heparin plasma (y), with the following results:
