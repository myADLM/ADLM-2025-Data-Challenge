A Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline
· CLSI EP7-A2- Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline
L. Test Principle:
The OneTouch® Verio® Blood Glucose Monitoring System employs flavin adenine
dinucleotide-glucose dehydrogenase (GDH-FAD) enzyme chemistry as the standard dry
reagent assay for glucose in whole blood. This enzymatic assay, with a redox chemical
“mediator” reaction, is used to generate an electrical current proportional to the glucose
concentration in the blood sample. The system is designed as an amperometric measurement
device using the current generated from the redox reaction as the measurable response.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
New performance data was not necessary as the modifications made to the meter would not
affect device performance. Therefore, device performance is as established in k110637.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was established in k110637.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was established in k110637. The claimed range of measurement for this
glucose device is 20-600mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The OneTouch Verio Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to the NIST
SRM 917b reference material. The method comparison study was performed using
the candidate device and YSI as the reference method.
Test strip stability:
Stability was previously established in k120708.
Control solution stability:
Control solution stability was previously in k120708.
Value Assignment:
Value assignment for the controls was previously established in k120708.
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the OneTouch Verio Blood Glucose Monitoring system is
20-600mg/dl based on linearity studies established in k110637.

--- Page 6 ---
e. Analytical specificity:
Analytical specificity established in k110637.
The sponsor has the following limitations in their labeling:
“Tolazamide at concentrations greater than 10.8 mg/dL may cause falsely low
results.”
“Uric acid at concentrations greater than 8 mg/dL may cause falsely low results.”
“The OneTouch Verio Family of Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems should not be
used for patients within 24 hours of receiving D-xylose absorption test as it may
cause inaccurately high results.”
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
System Accuracy Study
The sponsor performed a system accuracy evaluation comparing the OneTouch Verio
BGMS to YSI 2300 (reference method). The study was performed at three clinical
sites. Capillary fingerstick samples collected from 100 subjects over 25 days with
glucose concentrations ranging from 31.6 to 492.5mg/dL were analyzed with the
candidate device and with YSI. Two of the samples tested were adjusted <50mg/dL
and four samples were adjusted >400mg/dL glucose concentration ranges. The
OneTouch Verio was tested in duplicate with each of three different strip lots
providing a total of 6 meter results per participant. The results for a singlet set of data
relative to the reference method are summarized in the tables below:

Lay-User Study/User Performance Study:
The Lay user study was conducted following the ISO Standard 15197. To assess the
performance of the OneTouch Verio BGMS in the hands of the intended users, the
sponsor performed a study with 189 (53.4% female and 46.6% male) untrained lay
user participants. The study was performed at four clinical sites and was conducted
in 2 site visits. Each subject was asked to review the instructions for use and meter
and perform testing on a fingertip. Each subject produced a blood drop large enough
for two meter tests, one on an OneTouch Verio meter and Verio Test strip and the
other for the healthcare professional to immediately perform a blood glucose test on
another OneTouch Verio meter and Verio test strip from the same test strip lot. The
HCP also collected blood for two YSI 2300 tests and for hematocrit testing. The
range of glucose values for the samples as measured by the reference method was
31.8 to 495.3mg/dL. Results are summarized below:

3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger only. The
whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.
5. Calibration:
The meter is a non-coding device; therefore no coding is required by the user.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor manufactures two levels of glucose control solutions (OneTouch Verio
Level 3 Control Solution and OneTouch Verio Level 4 Control Solution) that can be run
with this device but are available separately from the system. The meter has an algorithm
to automatically recognize when a control solution is being analyzed. The words
“Control Solution” appears on screen and the meter automatically marks the result as a
control solution test. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are
provided in the labeling. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test
strip vial label. If the control values fall outside these ranges, the user is referred to the
user manual and customer support for more information.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study: Established in k110637.
2. Sample Volume Study: Established in k110637.
3. Sample Identification (Blood vs. Control solution): The sponsor performed a sample
type identification study. Seven OneTouch Verio test strip lots using blood and control
solution on OneTouch Verio meters were used during performance evaluation testing.
The results demonstrate that the OneTouch Verio BGMS was able to correctly
distinguish between blood and control solution.
4. Altitude Study: Established in k110637.
5. Temperature and Humidity Studies: Established in k110637.

services to demonstrate complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with Clorox
Germicidal Wipes (EPA Reg. No. 67619-12). The sponsor also conducted robustness
studies and demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the external
materials of the meter after 2879 cleaning and 412 disinfection cycles to simulate 3 years
of use by the lay-user. Each robustness cycle consisted of one pre-clean wipe and one
disinfecting wipe. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated
cleaning and disinfection procedures.
7. EMC testing: The sponsor states that they followed requirements of ISO 15197:2003(E)
and associated normative standards. Electromagnetic compatibility and Electrical Safety
verification testing of the OneTouch Verio Blood Glucose Monitoring System was
performed following the requirements of ISO 15197:2003(E) by CSA International and
letters of attestation dated June 12th and 14th 2012 were submitted stating that the device
met all of the requirements of the following standards:
IEC 61010-1
IEC 61010-2-101:2002

8. Readability Assessment: A Flesch-Kinkaid reading level assessment was conducted of
the OneTouch Verio Owners Booklet were assessed, giving a readability grade level of
6.1
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
