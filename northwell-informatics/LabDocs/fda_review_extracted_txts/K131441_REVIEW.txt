I. Device Description:
The method for qualitative determination of specific IgM to Toxoplasma gondii is an
antibody capture chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA). The principal components of
the test are magnetic particles (solid phase) coated with IgG (mouse, monoclonal) is used
for coating magnetic particles (solid phase) and a mouse monoclonal antibody to human
IgM, Toxoplasma gondii antigen, and a conjugate of mouse monoclonal antibodies to
Toxoplasma gondii linked to an isoluminol derivative (isoluminol-antibody conjugate).
During the first incubation, IgM antibodies present in calibrators, samples or controls
bind to the solid phase. During the second incubation, the mouse monoclonal antibody
conjugate reacts with Toxoplasma gondii antigen and the immune complex thus formed
reacts with IgM already bound to the solid phase. After the incubations, the unbound
material is removed with a wash cycle. Subsequently, the starter reagents are added and a
flash chemiluminescence reaction is thus induced. The light signal, and hence the amount
of isoluminol-antibody conjugate, is measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units
(RLU) and is indicative of Toxoplasma gondii IgM concentration present in calibrators,
samples or controls.
All assay steps and incubations are performed by the LIAISON® XL Analyzer.

L. Test Principle:
The test is a Chemiluminescence Immunoassay (Immunoassay technology based on the
emission of light as a result of a chemical reaction). During the first incubation, IgM
antibodies present in calibrators, samples or controls bind to the solid phase. During the
second incubation, the mouse monoclonal antibody conjugate reacts with Toxoplasma
gondii antigen previously added and the immune complex thus formed reacts with IgM
already bound to the solid phase. After each of the incubations, the unbound material was
removed with a wash cycle. Subsequently, the starter reagents are added and a flash
chemiluminescence reaction is thus induced. The light signal, and hence the amount of
isoluminol-antibody conjugate, is measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units
(RLU) and is indicative of the presence of Toxoplasma gondii IgM in calibrators, samples or
controls.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision was assessed by measuring repeatability at one site using two kit controls and
seven serum samples prepared to span the measuring range of the assay. Mean, standard
deviation, and coefficient of variation (%CV) were calculated using multiple sources of
variability that include within-run, within-day, between-day, and total variability. The
following results were obtained from one site with one kit lot assayed in duplicate in two
assays per day over 20 operating days.

Traceability:
There is no international standard available for measuring anti-Toxoplasma IgM in
serum; therefore, calibrators are traceable to an in-house reference preparation.
Positive human serum/defibrinated plasma is serially diluted with negative
serum/defibrinated plasma and tested in several assays and assigned Arbitrary Units
(AU/mL) values spanning the range of the assay. Aliquots are stored frozen and used
during the manufacturing of the kit calibrators.
Stability:
Reagent Integral:
Open use stability at 2-8°C was performed on one Reagent Integral Lot. At specified
intervals, the stored opened kit was evaluated in parallel with a freshly opened kit.
All testing was acceptable to 5 weeks. An open use stability of 4 weeks at 2-8°C is
claimed. Open use stability on board the LIAISON® Analyzer was performed on
one Reagent Integral Lot. At specified intervals, the opened kit was evaluated in
parallel with a freshly opened kit. All testing was acceptable to 5 weeks. An open
use stability of 4 weeks onboard the LIAISON® Analyzer is claimed.
Controls:
Open Use stability at 2-8°C was performed on one lot of LIAISON® Control Toxo
IgM. At specified intervals, the stored opened controls were evaluated in parallel
with a freshly opened vial of each control. All testing was acceptable to nine weeks.
Open use stability at 2-8°C of eight weeks is claimed.
Expected Values:
Calibrator 1 is manufactured to have a concentration between 6.0-9.0 AU/mL.
Calibrator 2 is manufactured to have a concentration between 40-60 AU/mL.
The Negative Control is manufactured to a target value of 2.0 AU/mL.
The Positive Control is manufactured to have a target value 18.0 AU/mL.

High Dose Hook Effect (false negative):
Analysis of high-dose hook effect was evaluated by testing three samples with
Toxoplasma gondii IgM levels out-of-range > 160 AU/mL (i.e., 16 x minimum positive
value). In this study, three samples with Toxo IgM levels were serially diluted in the
assay Specimen Diluent to cover the entire assay range. The neat sample and dilutions
were tested in triplicate using one kit lot on one instrument. The signal obtained was
plotted versus the dilution. The samples resulted in calculated concentration values above
the measuring range with no sample misclassification, indicating no hook effect was
observed.
IgM Specificity:
Ten samples containing Toxoplasma IgM antibodies covering the assay range from value
around cut-off level to clearly positive samples were treated with 10 mM dithiotreitol
(DTT) to denature the IgM. These DTT treated samples were then tested in singlicate in
parallel with the non-treated samples. All samples showed absence of IgM anti-
Toxoplasma reactivity after treatment with DTT. These data demonstrate the specificity
of the LIAISON® Toxo IgM II assay for IgM immunoglobulins.

Interference:
Testing was performed to determine whether the presence of endogenous or exogenous
substances may interfere with assay results. Three matched sample pools (2 negative and
1 positive) near the clinical decision point were tested neat and spiked with the respective
interferent. Acceptance criteria were defined as the % change in signal must not be more
than +10% and not change the qualitative result.
No interference was found at the concentration for each substance listed below in the
LIAISON® Toxo IgM II assay. The testing was based on CLSI-EP07-A2.

f. Assay cut-off:
The cutoff for the LIAISON® Toxo IgM II assay was set at an Arbitrary Unit value
of 10.0 AU/mL based on European studies by testing 905 subjects from different
populations (subjects sent to the lab for relevant testing, pregnant women, never
infected subjects, subjects affected by autoimmune diseases, patients affected by
various infectious diseases with similar symptoms, subjects with past infection,
patients affected by acute infection and subjects with long–lasting IgM). The samples
were tested in parallel with the LIAISON® Toxo IgM II assay and CE marked
comparison methods. Consensus with the available clinical and serological data was
applied to define the expected results.
The assay cut-off was validated in the United States during clinical studies by testing
a prospective population of 804 samples from individuals sent to the laboratory for
Toxoplasma gondii IgM testing, 201 pregnant women, and a retrospective population
of 33 samples from individuals who had a positive Toxoplasma gondii IgM result.
Based on the comparison studies this cutoff is appropriate for the LIAISON® Toxo
IgM II assay. In the LIAISON® Toxo IgM II assay, a sample is defined as positive if

Comparative Testing:
Prospective and Retrospective studies were performed to compare the performance of
the LIAISON® Toxo IgM II assay to an FDA-cleared predicate device. The
prospective study consisted of 804 samples (204 samples from US subjects, 600
samples from European subjects) from individuals who were sent to the laboratory for
Toxoplasma gondii IgM testing and 201 pregnant women. The retrospective study
consisted of 33 samples selected from individuals who had a positive Toxoplasma
gondii IgM result by the predicate device.
Interpretation of Results:
Index Results Interpretation
< 8.0 AU/mL Negative Absence of detectable Toxoplasma gondii IgM antibodies. A
negative result does not always rule out acute toxoplasmosis,
because the infection may be in its very early stage and the
patient has not developed Toxoplasma gondii specific IgM. If
exposure to Toxoplasma gondii is suspected despite a negative
finding, a second sample should be collected and tested three
weeks later.

CDC Panel study:
The CDC Toxoplasma 1998 Human Serum Panel is comprised of 100 frozen blind specimens
(32 Toxoplasma IgM true positive samples and 65 Toxoplasma IgM true negative samples and
three dilutions of three true Toxoplasma IgM positive samples). The panel was tested by
LIAISON® Toxo IgM II assay at site #3. The results were submitted to the CDC (Reference
Immunodiagnostic Lab, Biology and Diagnostic Branch Division of Parasitic Diseases) for data
analysis. As communicated by the CDC, the LIAISON® Toxo IgM II assay correctly detected
the 32 Toxoplasma IgM true positive samples (100 % agreement) and 65 Toxoplasma IgM true
negative samples (100% agreement).
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The observed prevalence/ expected values using the LIAISON® Toxo IgM II assay was
calculated for the prospective sample populations collected from US, European, and
pregnant subjects. The samples from the US were from 8 males (3.9%) and 196 females
(96.1%). There were 147 samples from patients where the age was unknown. Gender and
ages for samples from the European subjects (n=600) are unknown. The pregnancy
samples consisted of 201 females from the US with ages ranging from 14 to 44 years.
There were 70 samples from subjects in the 1st trimester, 50 samples from subjects in the
2nd trimester, and 81 samples from subjects in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. The
prevalence may vary depending upon geographical location, age, gender, type of test
employed, specimen collection and handling procedures as well as clinical history of the
patient. The observed prevalence of the LIAISON® Toxo IgM II assay for each
prospective population is as follows:
· US Population 0.0%
· European Population 16.7%
· Pregnant Women 1.5%

N. Instrument Name:
LIAISON® XL Analyzer
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The method for qualitative determination of specific IgM to Toxoplasma gondii is an
antibody capture chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA). The principal components
of the test are magnetic particles (solid phase) coated with IgG (mouse, monoclonal) to
human IgM, Toxoplasma gondii antigen, and a conjugate of mouse monoclonal
antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii linked to an isoluminol derivative (isoluminol-antibody
conjugate). During the first incubation, IgM antibodies present in calibrators, samples or
controls bind to the solid phase. During the second incubation, the mouse monoclonal
antibody conjugate reacts with Toxoplasma gondii antigen previously added and the
immune complex thus formed reacts with IgM already bound to the solid phase. After
each incubation, the unbound material is removed with a wash cycle. Subsequently,
the starter reagents are added and a flash chemiluminescence reaction is thus induced.
The light signal, and hence the amount of isoluminol-antibody conjugate, is measured

3. Specimen Identification:

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Not Applicable
5. Calibration:
DiaSorin's LIAISON® Toxo IgM II assay generates a continuous response (relative light
units, RLU) which is used in sample grading to provide a qualitative (positive, negative,
or equivocal) reportable result. The sample grading is based on the use of a calibration
curve referenced to an IgM anti-Toxoplasma Internal Reference preparation and
controlled by use of two calibrators (Calibrator 1 and Calibrator 2) provided in the
Reagent Integral.
The calibrators are assayed by the user to transform the kit lot specific Master Curve
into a Working Curve. The Master Curves are stored in the Radio Frequency
Identification transponder (RFID Tag) of the Reagent Integral. Each Master Curve is
generated by a mathematical elaboration of the data resulting from multiple testing (at
least 10 runs) of an Internal Reference Preparation. During user calibration, the
Calibrator results are used to create a Working Curve by mathematical adjustment of
the Master Curve.
The Working Curve is then used to calculate sample results. (See Figure 6 for the
calibration scheme.) The IgM anti-Toxoplasma Master Standards (e.g. points of the
Internal Reference Preparation) were prepared from a pool of human serum or
defibrinated plasma reactive for Toxoplasma IgM antibodies at established
concentrations diluted in human serum or defibrinated plasma based matrix.
Calibrator doses are assigned with a specific Reagent Integral lot using the IgM anti-
Toxoplasma Master Standard as the calibration curve in individual assays to assess the
16

--- Page 17 ---
AU/mL value. A reference panel of samples is tested and results obtained are
compared between the IgM anti-Toxoplasma Master Standards and Calibrators and
between expected results. If the calibrator AU/mL value is out of the expected range, the
Calibrators are adjusted by dilution or concentration. When the final AU/mL value is
obtained, the Calibrators are tested for release. The lot-specific AU/mL values of
Calibrators are stored in the Radio Frequency Identification transponder (RFID Tag).
Calibrator 1 is manufactured to have a concentration between 6-9 AU/mL.
Calibrator 2 is manufactured to have a concentration between 40-60 AU/mL.
The calibrators are manufactured by diluting human serum/defibrinated plasma
positive for IgM anti-Toxoplasma with a PBS/BSA buffer to obtain the target value.
Calibrators and Controls are manufactured separately. Raw material segregation is
maintained by the use of different part numbers for the stock solutions intended to
manufacture the Calibrators and Controls.
The analyzer is calibrated in triplicate whenever one of the following conditions occurs:
(see LIAISON® XL Analyzer Operator’s manual):
· A new lot of Reagent Integral or a new lot of Starter Kit is used.
· The previous calibration was performed more than four weeks before.
· The analyzer has been serviced.
· Control values lie outside the expected ranges.
The process by which assay calibration was established and is maintained, is comprised
of the following steps:
· Creation of the Internal Reference Preparation during the development phase.
This step involves the selection of appropriate positive human serum/defibrinated
plasma material, serial dilution with human negative serum/defibrinated plasma,
and assignment of arbitrary AU/mL values appropriate for the range of
LIAISON® Toxo IgM II kit. The final material is dispensed in aliquots and stored
frozen. It is used as IgM anti-Toxoplasma Master Standards for calibration of
reagents lots.
· Before exhaustion, the Internal Reference Preparation is restored by the
selection of appropriate serum/defibrinated plasma material, serial dilution with
human negative serum/defibrinated plasma, assignment of AU/mL values to the
obtained points by calibration against the Internal Reference Preparation (ref.
DiaSorin QC Procedure, CQst071).
· Generation of the Master Curve by multiple testing of the Internal Reference
Preparation in at least ten Runs (ref. DiaSorin SOP 09.0245)
· Preparation of Kit Calibrators and assignment of calibrator values testing them
against the Internal Reference Preparation. If necessary, Kit Calibrators
concentrations are adjusted to achieve final target AU/mL (ref. DiaSorin QC
17

--- Page 18 ---
Procedure, (CQccl244).
· Adjustment of the lot-specific Master Curve on the basis of the Kit Calibrators
results obtained by the user during instrument calibration. This Instrument
Working Curve is used to calculate the patient sample results
6. Quality Control:
The LIAISON® Toxo IgM II assay procedure requires the running of controls in
singlicate once per day of use. The LIAISON® Control Toxo IgM II consists of one
negative and one positive serum based control. The controls were run at each site
following the recommended procedure of once per day of use. If the controls failed, a
new calibration was performed and controls were retested before beginning the testing for
the day.
The following table shows a summary of the results:
Summary of Controls
Site 1 Site 2 Site 3
ID Range Mean %CV Mean %CV Mean %CV
Negative 0 - 4 AU/mL NA NA NA NA NA NA
Positive 10 -31 AU/mL 18.8 5.3% 17.2 13.2% 19.1 8.9%
The Negative control mean and % CV were not able to be calculated as the Negative control
gave results of <3.0 AU/mL which is below the measuring range of the assay.
Based on the results, it was concluded that the LIAISON® Control Toxo IgM II provides
an appropriate level of control for the LIAISON® Toxo IgM II assay.
