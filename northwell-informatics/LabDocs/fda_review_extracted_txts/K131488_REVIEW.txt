L. Test Principle:
The ACE Albumin Reagent is a photometric assay in which Bromcresol green (BCG)
binds specifically to albumin to form a green colored complex, which is measured
bichromatically at 629 nm/692 nm. The intensity of color produced is directly proportional
to the albumin concentration in the sample.
The ACE Total Protein Reagent is a colorimetric assay in which Cupric ions react with the
peptide bonds of proteins under alkaline conditions to form a violet colored complex,
which is measured bichromatically at 544 nm/692 nm. The intensity of color produced is
directly proportional to the total protein concentration in the sample.
The ACE Calcium-Arsenazo Reagent utilizes a dye binding procedure in which calcium
forms a blue-purple complex with Arsenazo III under acidic conditions

Calcium reacts with Arsenazo III in an acidic solution to form a blue-purple colored
complex, which is measured bichromatically at 647 nm/692 nm. The intensity of color
produced is directly proportional to the calcium concentration in the sample.
The ACE Inorganic Phosphorus U.V. Reagent is a colorimetric assay in
which under acidic conditions, inorganic phosphorus in serum reacts with
ammonium molybdate to form an unreduced phosphomolybdate complex,
which absorbs strongly at 340 nm. The increase in absorbance, measured
bichromatically at 340 nm/378 nm, is directly proportional to the amount of
phosphorus in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the ACE Albumin, Total Protein, Calcium and Phosphorus assays
was evaluated in-house using an ACE Alera analyzer. Human serum samples at 3
concentrations of the respective measurand were evaluated using a 20 day precision
study. The study was performed measuring each sample 2 times per run, 2 runs per
day for 20 days for a total of 80 measurements per sample using 1 reagent lot. The
results are provided in the table below.

Serum POL Precision study:
The precision of the ACE Albumin, Calcium, Total Protein and Phosphorus assays at in-
house and 3 physician office laboratories (POLs) for matched serum samples at 3
concentrations of the respective measurand was evaluated using a multiple day precision
study. In this precision study, serum with a low concentration of measurand from a single

measuring concentrations evenly distributed were prepared by diluting a high
measured concentration serum pool. This yielded linearity samples with levels that
spanned the measuring range of each of the four analytes (Albumin, Total Protein,
Calcium and Phosphorus) measured.
The sponsor calculated linear and polynomial regressions from mean observed values
versus expected values using an unweighted regression model. The linear regressions
between the expected values and the measured values are found in the table below:
Measurand Range tested Slope Intercept r2
Albumin 0.1-7.6 0.980 0.01 0.9982

(mg/dL)
Phosphorus 0.2-21 mg/dL 1.001 0.03 0.9995
(mg/dL)
The linearity supports the sponsor’s claimed reportable range of the Albumin assay is
0.3-7.0 g/dL, Total Protein assay is 0.4-14.0 g/dL, Calcium assay is 0.4-15.0 mg/dL
and Phosphorus 0.4-20.0 mg/dL
Auto-dilution study:
Sponsor performed an auto-dilution study to confirm the auto-dilution function (1:3)
on the ACE Alera analyzer for each measurand for plasma and serum samples by
comparing the auto-diluted results to the manual dilution results. Sample recovery
was within +/- 10% bias for all samples tested.

LoB, LoD and LoQ studies for each measurand were evaluated based upon CLSI EP-
17A using the ACE Alera analyzer.
LoB Test Protocol
Blank samples (n=5) were measured in replicates of 4 for 3 days for a total of n=60
measurements.
LoD Protocol
Low serum-based samples (n=5) and blank samples (n=5) were measured in
replicates of 4 per day for 3 days for a total of n=60 measurements
LoQ Protocol
LoQ was determined by evaluating 5 low level samples with multiple replicates over
multiple days for a total of 40 measurements per sample. LoQ values are based on
inter-assay precision of <20% CV.

Total Protein (g/dL) 0.4-14.0
Calcium (mg/dL) 0.4-15.0

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed according to CLSI-EP07 to determine whether the
presence of hemoglobin, triglycerides (Intralipid), icterus (bilirubin), and ascorbic
acid may interfere with results for each measurand using the ACE Alera analyzer.
Human serum samples were used with two different concentrations (normal and
abnormal) of measurand (Albumin, Total Protein, Calcium and Phophorus). Each
sample level was spiked with increasing amounts of interferent for a total of 7
samples with interferent. Control samples at each level which were not spiked were

used to compare with spiked samples. The spiked and unspiked samples were tested
and used to calculate % recovery (measured concentration compared to measured

was defined as non-significant interference. The results of the highest concentration
tested without significant interference are summarized in the table below.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Serum Method Comparison:
Method comparison studies were conducted at 3 POC sites and in house following
CLSI EP9-A2. Samples were analyzed on the ACE Clinical Chemistry System at
Alfa Wassermann and the results were compared against those gathered on the ACE
Alera Clinical Chemistry Systems at 3 Physician Office Labs (POL). At least 50
determinations were made in singlicate for serum samples drawn from the same
individuals on the same platform. To test across the reportable range of the assay,
additional sets (<7 sets) of altered samples (spikes or diluted) were used to cover the
full measuring range of each analyte. Results are summarized in the table below.
