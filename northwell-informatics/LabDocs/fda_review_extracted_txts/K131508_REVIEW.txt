I. Device Description:
The Vysis D7S486/CEP 7 FISH Probe Kit is a device intended for specimen characterization.
The device uses DNA FISH probe technology to detect the LSI D7S486 probe target on
chromosome 7q31 and the CEP 7 probe target on chromosome 7p11.1-q11.1 in bone marrow
and peripheral blood specimens. The Vysis D7S486/CEP 7 FISH Probe Kit consists of a
mixture of two DNA FISH probes (item 1 below) and four general purpose reagents (items 2
through 5 below) which are sufficient to process 20 assays:
1. Vysis LSI D7S486 SpectrumOrange and CEP 7 SpectrumGreen Probes:
a. The SpectrumOrange labeled LSI D7S486 probe is approximately 308 kb in

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

L. Test Principle:
FISH is a technique that allows visualization of specific nucleic acid sequences within a
cellular preparation. Specifically, FISH involves precise annealing of a single-stranded,
fluorophore-labeled DNA probe to a complementary target sequence. Hybridization of the
probe with the cellular DNA is visible using fluorescence microscopy.
Bone marrow and peripheral blood cell specimens from patients are attached to microscope
slides using standard cytogenetic procedures. The resulting DNA specimen is denatured to
single-stranded form and subsequently allowed to hybridize with the probes of the Vysis
D7S486/CEP 7 FISH Probe Kit. Following hybridization, the unbound probe is removed by a
series of washes, and the nuclei are counterstained with DAPI II, a DNA-specific stain that
fluoresces blue. Hybridization of the Vysis LSI D7S486 SpectrumOrange/CEP 7
SpectrumGreen Probes is viewed using a fluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate
excitation and emission filters, allowing visualization of the orange and green fluorescent
signals.
In a cell with normal copy numbers of the Vysis LSI D7S486 SpectrumOrange/CEP 7
SpectrumGreen probe targets, two orange (2R) signals (D7S486) and two green (2G) signals
(CEP 7) will be expected. In a cell having only one copy of chromosome 7, 1 orange, 1 green
(1R1G) pattern is expected, and in a cell with loss of 7q, 1 orange, 2 green (1R2G) pattern is
expected.
FISH results are interpreted by utilizing appropriate controls and analytical techniques as
well as taking into consideration other clinical and diagnostic test data.

either karyotypically normal individuals or patients with a 1R1G signal pattern and
1R2G signal pattern. The orange and green signal patterns of 200 nuclei for each
specimen type were evaluated by 2 technologists each scoring 100 nuclei per
specimen for a total of 200 nuclei per specimen. A total of 5000 nuclei were scored
from normal specimens. The Vysis D7S486/CEP 7 FISH Probe Kit has an analytical
sensitivity of 98.1% (4903/5000) (95% CI 97.6-98.4%) for bone marrow and 98.5%
(4923/5000) (95% CI 98.1-98.8%) for peripheral blood.

e. Analytical specificity:
Analytical specificity is defined as the percentage of signals that hybridize to the
correct locus and no other location. The analytical specificity of the Vysis LSI
D7S486 SpectrumOrange/CEP 7 SpectrumGreen Probes for their respective
chromosome target loci (7q31 and 7p11.1-q11.1, respectively) was established using
metaphase chromosomes prepared from peripheral blood cultures of 4 male and 1
female karyotypically normal specimens. The hybridization location of each FISH
signal on chromosomes of 100 consecutive metaphase nuclei was evaluated by 1
technologist for a total of 200 target loci per probe.
For each probe and sample, the number of metaphase chromosome FISH signals
hybridized to the correct locus and the number of metaphase chromosome FISH
signals hybridized to the incorrect locus were enumerated. The analytical specificity
of each probe was calculated as the number of metaphase chromosome FISH signals
hybridized to the correct locus divided by the total number of metaphase chromosome
FISH signals hybridized and multiplied by 100 to give a percentage.
The analytical specificity of the Vysis D7S486/CEP 7 FISH Probe Kit was considered
acceptable if greater than or equal to 99% and the D7S486/CEP 7 probes was 100%
(200/200) (95% CI 98-100%).

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The upper reference limit is defined as the maximum quantity of scoreable interphase
nuclei with an altered signal pattern from karyotypically normal specimens. The upper
reference limit is expressed in terms of a percentage, or the actual number of a specific
atypical nuclear FISH signal pattern per the standard number of nuclei tested.

The upper reference limit for 4.5% or nine 1R1G patterns per 200 scoreable interphase
nuclei, and the upper reference limit is 6.5% or thirteen 1R2G patterns per 200 scoreable
interphase nuclei. The 4.5% and 6.5% upper reference limits were adopted from the
publication of Vance et al, who utilized the Vysis D7S486/CEP 7 FISH Probe.1
In order to validate the 4.5% and 6.5% upper reference limits, the Vysis D7S486/CEP 7
FISH assay was performed on interphase nuclei from 25 bone marrow and 25 peripheral
blood specimens from either karyotypically normal individuals or patients lwith signal
patterns of 1R1G or 1R2G. The orange and green signal patterns of 200 nuclei for each
specimen type were evaluated by each of two technologists scoring 100 nuclei per
specimen.
Among the 25 karyotypically normal specimens for both peripheral blood and bone
marrow, none produced 1R1G and 1R2G signals above the 4.5% and 6.5% upper
reference limits, respectively.
N. Proposed Labeling:
