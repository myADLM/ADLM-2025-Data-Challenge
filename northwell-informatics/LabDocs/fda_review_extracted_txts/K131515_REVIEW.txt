(Interim revision; 2010)

Procedures (2004)
L. Test Principle:
The ACE γ-GT Reagent is based on a photometric test in which γ-GT in the sample
catalyzes the transfer of the γ-glutamyl group from the L- γ-glutamyl-3-carboxy-4-
nitoanilide substrate to the glycylglycine product in the reagent. The product, 5-
amino-2-nitobenzoate, absorbs strongly at 408 nm. The rate of increase in
absorbance is directly proportional to the γ-GT activity in the sample.
The ACE Lipase Reagent is based on a photometric test in which lipase in the sample
acts on a natural substrate, 1,2-diglyceride, to liberate 2-monoglyceride. This is
hydrolyzed by monoglyceride lipase in to glycerol and free fatty acid. Glycerol
kinase acts on glycerol to from glycerol-3-phosphate, which is in turn acted on by
glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase to generate hydrogen peroxide. Peroxidase converts the
hydrogen peroxide, 4-aminoantipyrine and TOOS (N-ethyl-N-(2-hydroxy-3-
sulfopropyl)-m-toluidine) in to a quinine dye. The rate of formation of the dye,
determined bichromatically at an absorbance of 573 nm/692 nm, is proportional to the
lipase activity in the sample.
The ACE T4 Reagent is a homogenous enzyme immunoassay based on a photometric
test in which 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid (ANS) is used to dissociate
thyroxine from the plasma binding proteins. Using antibodies specific to thyroxine,
this assay is based on the competition of G6PD labeled thyroxine and the dissociated
thyroxine in the sample for a fixed number of specific antibody binding sites. In the
absence of thyroxine from the sample, the thyroxine labeled G6PD in the second
reagent is bound by the specific antibody in the first reagent, inhibiting the enzyme’s
activity. The enzyme G6PD catalyzes the oxidation of G6P with NAD+ to form 6-
phosphogluconate and reduced NADH. NADH strongly absorbs at 340 nm whereas
NAD+ does not. The rate of conversion, determined by measuring the increase in
absorbance at 340 nm during a fixed time interval, is directly proportional to the
amount of thyroxine in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the γ-GT, Lipase and T4 reagents on an in-house ACE Alera
system was evaluated using human serum samples at three concentrations of
the respective measurand and one lot of reagents in an at least 20 day
precision study. Each study was performed measuring each sample 2 times
per run, 2 runs per day for at least 20 days for a total of 80 measurements per
sample. The results are provided in the table below.

Plasma and Serum In-house Precision Study:
The precision of the γ-GT, Lipase and T4 reagents for matched serum and
Lithium heparin plasma samples at 3 concentrations of the respective
measurand was evaluated in-house over a period of 5 to 6 days using one
reagent lot (2 reagent lots for γ-GT). In this study, matched serum and plasma
samples with a low concentration of measurand from a single donor were
spiked to a high concentration of measurand with commercially-available
analyte, and then the mid-level samples were prepared by mixing equal
portions of the low-level and high-level samples. Each sample was measured
2 times per run for 2 runs per day for 5 to 6 days (N=20 for γ-GT and T4;
N=24 for Lipase). All samples were tested on the ACE, ACE Alera and ACE
Axcel systems. The precision results are summarized in the table below.

Serum POL Precision Study:
The precision of the γ-GT, Lipase and T4 reagents at an in-house and 3
physician office laboratories (POLs) using serum samples at 3 concentrations
of the respective measurand and one reagent lot (2 reagent lots for γ-GT) was
evaluated using a multiple day precision study. In this study, a serum sample
with a low concentration of measurand from a single donor was spiked to a
high concentration of measurand with commercially-available analyte, and
then the mid-level sample was prepared by mixing equal portions of the low-
level and high-level samples. The study was performed measuring each
sample 2 times per run, 2 runs per day for a total of 5 days (N=20
measurements per sample) on the ACE Alera system. The precision results
are provided in the table below.

b. Linearity/Assay Reportable Range:
The sponsor assessed linearity on the ACE Alera analyzer with each sample
tested in triplicate using one lot of reagents. Nine diluted samples with
measurand concentrations evenly distributed were prepared by diluting a high
measurand concentration serum pool. This yielded linearity samples with
levels that spanned the measuring range of each of the three analytes (γ-GT,
Lipase and T4) measured.
The sponsor calculated linear and polynomial regressions from mean observed
values versus expected values using weighted regression model. The linear
regressions between the expected values and the measured values are found in
the table below:
Measurand Range tested Slope (95% CI) Intercept (95% CI)
γ-GT (U/L) 4.0 to 993 1.036 (1.031 to 1.042) 0.8 (-0.8 to 2.4)
Lipase (U/L) 11.0 to 739 0.971 (0.965 to 0.977) 0.2 (-1.0 to 1.5)
T4 (µg/dL) 1.2 to 19.7 1.057 (1.033 to 1.081) -0.09 (-0.28 to 0.10)
The linearity data provided support the sponsor’s claims for the reportable
range for the γ-GT reagent of 7.0 to 950 U/L, Lipase reagent of 15 to 700 U/L,
and T4 reagent of 1.3 to 19.6 µg/dL.

Auto-dilution Study:
The sponsor provided auto-dilution studies to confirm the auto-dilution
function on the ACE Alera analyzer for the ACE γ-GT reagent (1:3 dilution)
and ACE Lipase reagent (1:2 dilution) using plasma and/or serum samples.
The studies compared the results obtained from auto-dilution of the samples to
the manual dilution results. All samples recovered within ±5% bias.
The ACE T4 reagent is not set for automatic dilution on the ACE Alera
analyzer.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
ACE γ -GT Reagent
Traceable to another commercially available FDA cleared assay by method
comparison. This is not a calibrated test.
ACE Lipase Reagent
Traceable to another commercially available FDA cleared assay by method
comparison. The calibrator was previously cleared under k113438.
ACE T4 Reagent
Traceable to another commercially available FDA cleared assay by method
comparison. The calibrator was previously cleared under k113437.
d. Detection Limit:
The LoQ studies for each measurand were evaluated based upon CLSI EP17-
A guidance document using the ACE Alera analyzer.
LoQ was determined by evaluating five low level samples with eight
replicates over five days for a total of 40 measurements per sample. Sponsor
defined LoQ as concentration with a %CV of < 20%.
Measurand LoQ
γ-GT 7.0 U/L
Lipase 13.0 U/L
T4 1.3 µg/dL
Based on the LoQ and the linearity studies, the measuring ranges for the three
measurand on the ACE Alera instrument are as shown below:

e. Analytical Specificity:
Interference testing was performed according to CLSI EP07-A2 guidance
document for the γ-GT reagent, Lipase reagent and T4 reagent on the ACE
Alera analyzer.
Human serum samples were used with two different concentrations (normal
and abnormal) of the measurand (γ-GT, lipase and T4). Interference from
unconjugated bilirubin, hemolysate, lipemia and ascorbic acid was tested. For
lipemia interference studies, avian triglyceride concentrate (γ-GT and lipase)
or Intralipid (T4) was used. Each sample level was spiked with increasing
amounts of interferent for a total of six samples with interferent. Control
samples at each level that were not spiked with the interferents were used to
compare with the spiked samples and percent recovery was calculated for
each sample. Interference is considered to be significant when the analyte
recovery changes by ±10%. The results are summarized in the table below.
Interferent No Significant Interference at or below:
γ-GT Lipase T4
Icterus 14.2 mg/dL 12.5 mg/dL 47.2 mg/dL
Hemolysis 125 mg/dL 1000 mg/dL 1000 mg/dL
Lipemia 500 mg/dL 803 mg/dL 1000 mg/dL
Ascorbic acid 6.0 mg/dL 6.0 mg/dL 6.0 mg/dL
The following statements are included as limitations in the respective labeling
for the three reagents:
Lipase reagent:
“Do not use icteric samples.”
“Use clear, unhemolyzed serum or lithium heparin plasma.”
“A comprehensive list of drugs and other substances which can affect lipase
activity in serum is given by Young, et. Al.1”
γ-GT reagent:
“Use clear, unhemolyzed serum or lithium heparin plasma.”
“Do not use hemolyzed samples. Hemolysis interferes with the γ-GT assay
and may cause erroneous results.”
“A comprehensive list of drugs and other substances which can affect lipase
activity in serum is given by Young, et. Al.1”
T4 reagent:
“In rare instances, patients may have autoantibodies that will interfere with
this assay and result in low thyroxine results.”
“The performance characteristics of this assay have not been established for
neonatal samples.”
“Use clear, unhemolyzed serum or lithium heparin plasma.”

b. Matrix Comparison:
To characterize correlation between lithium heparin plasma (y-axis) and
serum (x-axis), a matrix comparison study was performed for each measurand
using paired samples on the ACE, ACE Alera and ACE Axcel analyzers. All
specimens were run in singlicate using at least two lots of each reagent. In
order to span the reportable range of the assay, some of the samples were
spiked (γ-GT – 4 on ACE Axcel; Lipase – 10 on ACE and ACE Alera, and 4 on
ACE Axcel; T4 – 3 on all) and / or diluted (T4 – 1 on all). Data were analyzed
by Deming linear regression. Results are summarized in the table below:
