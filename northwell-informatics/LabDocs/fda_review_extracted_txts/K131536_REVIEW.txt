Value Assignment:
The levels of IMMULITEâ CVMs are value assigned using approved reference lot
manufactured with qualified materials and measurement procedures. The assigned reference
calibrators are prepared using PSA antigen stock and are traceable to WHO 1st International
Standard 96/670. Each level of CVMs was tested for 9 runs, 3 replicates per run for a total of
27 replicates using 5 different kit lots on 6 instruments. The values are generated using curve
generated by assigned reference calibrators. The average analyte recovered for each CVM
level determines the value assigned to the Target Mean. The Guideline Range (95%
confidence interval) for each CVM level was established based on the Target Mean and ± 2
Standard Deviation (SD).
The target range for each level of CVMs is shown in the following table:
Level Catalog number Target Mean SD Guideline Range
(ng/mL) (ng/mL) (ng/mL)
1 LPTSCVM1 0.00 ≤ 0.085
2 LPTSCVM2 1.44 0.08 1.28 1.60
3 LPTSCVM3 49.00 2.45 44.10 53.90
4 LPTSCVM4* 169 N/A N/A N/A
90% LPTSCVM4 + 152 7.5 137 167
10% LPTSCVM1
* LPTCVM4 is used for dilution to ensure the target value for the dilution is within +10% of the top
of the reportable range of the assay
Value assignment is lot specific. For each lot of CVMs, quality control is performed by
calculating the recovery of patient samples, spiked patient samples, normal male samples and
controls using the assigned values. The controls must fall within their target range.
Stability:
The stability studies were conducted to validate shelf life claim for the IMMULITEâ 2000
CVM.
For Real time stability study, three lots of the CVMs were tested for stability when stored at -
20°C. Each calibrator was run in duplicate and the PSA concentration determined from
reference calibrator curve. The reported testing periods for one lot were 182 days (6
months), and 365 days (12 months). The reported test periods for a second lot were 1 day, 15
days, 30 days, 60 days and 150 days. The reported test periods for the third lot were 1 day,
15 days, 30 days, 60 days and 150 days. The real-time stability study is ongoing.
For accelerated stability study, three lots of the CMVs were stored at room temperature (RT)
for 7 days, 37°C for 3 days and with 3 times Freeze/Thaw (F/T). Each calibrator was run in
duplicate. The results are directly compared to the samples stored at 2-8°C.
The stability study shows acceptable results up to 60 days when stored frozen at -20°C prior

to opening. Each CVM is for single use only.
Matrix effect:
To investigate potential matrix effects from using processed (pH-treated) Chicken Serum,
spiking recovery of PSA was determined. A stock solution of calibrator grade PSA was used
to prepare the spiking solutions for studying matrix effects. Three spiking solutions were
prepared from the stock solution. Each spiking solutions was spiked into the matrix (chicken
serum) and patient sample (1 part spiking solution to 19 parts matrix or sample) to generate
two sets of spiked samples (concentrations at 4.86 ng/mL, 18.97 ng/mL and 37.50 ng/mL).
All spiked samples were run in assay on the IMMUNLITE 2000 platform. The % recovery
of PSA in the spiked matrix was compared to the % recovery in the spiked patient sample.
Each of the tested samples met the acceptance criteria: the grand mean of the recoveries
must be within 100% ±10% of the expected value with no mean recovery being more than
100% ± 15%. The results from the spiking recovery study have shown no matrix effects.

See above expected target values for each PSA concentration. The expected values are provided
in the IMMULITEâ 2000 PSA CVM lot-specific value sheet. Each laboratory should establish
their limits for acceptability based on methodology, clinical significance and medical decision
levels of the test analyte. The representative total precision, tabulated in the respective assay
instructions for use may be considered as one factor when establishing local, acceptable range.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
