Measurement Methods
CLSI Guideline C28-A3c: Defining, Establishing, and Verifying Reference Intervals in the
Clinical Laboratory
L. Test Principle:
The AU Bicarbonate reagent is an enzymatic method utilizing Bicarbonate (HCO3-) and
phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), which are converted to oxaloacetate to malate with the concomitant
oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). This oxidation of NADH
results in a decrease in absorbance of the reaction mixture measured bichromatically at 380/410
nm proportional to the Bicarbonate content of the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were conducted in-house following the CLSI guidance document EP05-
A2. Within-run and total precision were evaluated by testing samples at three levels,
(low, mid and high) of a commercially available, multi-analyte standard. Samples were
analyzed in duplicate on the Beckman Coulter AU 5800 analyzer for 20 days, 4 runs per
day (N=80). Results are summarized below:
Sample Mean (mEq/L) Within-Run Total
%CV SD %CV SD
Low 12.3 2.5 0.30 7.5 0.92
Medium 31.0 1.1 0.35 4.0 1.23
High 40.3 0.8 0.34 3.6 1.47
An additional within-run and total precision study were evaluated by testing two levels,
(low and mid) of a commercially available, serum based control. Samples were analyzed
in triplicate on the Beckman Coulter AU 5800 analyzer for 5 days, 1 run per day (N=15).
Results are summarized below.
Sample Mean (mEq/L) Within-Run Total
%CV SD %CV SD
Low 11.3 2.3 0.27 4.3 0.49
Medium 28.9 2.3 0.67 2.6 0.75
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A commercially available multi-analyte standard was diluted with saline to achieve 11
linearity concentration levels from 0.420 to 49.845 mEq/L and the linearity determined
using the Beckman AU 5800analyzer. Each dilution level was tested in quadruplicate.

The mean observed results were plotted against the relative analytical concentration. The
linear regression correlation between the expected values and the measured values for the
CO is summarized below:

Analyte Tested Linear Regression r2
CO (mEq/L) y = 1.002x – 0.112 0.99979

The claimed measuring range of the device is 2 - 45 mEq/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The CO assay is traceable to NIST SRM 351
2
Calibrator materials were previously cleared under k043460
The sponsor recommends the use of a commercially available control for use with this
assay.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ) were
determined according to CLSI EP17-A2 using the Beckman AU5800 analyzer. For the
LoB and LoD studies, 4 blank samples and 5 low samples were tested in multiple
replicates over three days using 2 lots of reagents on one AU5800 analyzer. A total of 60
blank replicated and 60 low sample replicates per reagent lot were generated. LoQ
studies were performed using 4 low samples with 3 replicates per sample measured over
3 days using 2 lots of reagents (N=36). LoQ is determined based on inter-assay precision
of <20%CV. The results are determined as follows:
Analyte LoB LoD LoQ
CO (mEq/L) 1.20 1.95 1.95
2
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed to determine the effects from potential
interferents on the AU5800. The interfering substances were analyzed at two levels of
Bicarbonate; 20 mEq/L and 35 mEq/L. High serum pools were spiked with
Bicarbonate concentrate and low serum pools were diluted with 0.9% saline. The
various concentration of interferent was spiked into two serum pools. All samples
were tested in quadruplicate. Ten interferent levels and the control were tested for
each interferent. Interference is defined as a result that is different from the control
by ±10%. The tested ranges and analyte concentrations are presented in the product
labeling.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
An in-house method comparison study to the predicate device (Trace CO assay) was
2
performed with 129 serum patient samples (2 spiked and 7 diluted) on the Beckman
Coulter AU5800 analyzer. Samples were spiked or diluted to cover the low and high end
of the assay range. The results are presented in the table below:

b. Matrix comparison:
Matrix comparison studies were completed following the CLSI guidance document, EP9-
A2 IR. Samples were tested on the Beckman AU5800 Analyzer. 41 measurements were
made in singlicate for paired serum/lithium heparin plasma and serum/sodium heparin
plasma samples drawn from the same individuals. Of these samples, 15% were altered (3
spiked and 3 diluted) allowing for testing across the assay range.
The following charts summarize the matrix comparison studies:
