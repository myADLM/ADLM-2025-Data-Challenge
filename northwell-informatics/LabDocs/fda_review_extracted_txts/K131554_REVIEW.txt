L. Test Principle:
AST measurements are based on Α-oxoglutarate reacts with L-aspartine in the presence of
AST to form L-glutamate plus oxaloacetate. The indicator reaction utilizes the oxaloacetate
for a kinetic determination of NADH consumption.
The RX Daytona Plus analyzer with optional ISE is based on the potentiometric Nernst
Equation principle. Sample is diluted with a diluent and aspirated into ion-selective
electrodes. The measured potential difference between the reference electrode and the ion
specific electrode is proportional to the logarithm of the concentration of the measured ions.

According to the sponsor, the on-board and open stability claims for the ISE reagents
are as follows when stored at 15-25°C:
Component Open Stability
ISE cleaning solution 6 months
ISE ref solution 1 month
ISE etching solution 12 months
L solution (ISE Calibrator ) 1 month
H solution (ISE Calibrator ) 1 month
Calibrators for AST assay: The Randox clinical chemistry calibration serum level 2 &
3 (previously cleared under k053153) are the recommended calibrators for use with
this device. The Randox clinical chemistry calibrators, when reconstituted, are stable
for 8 hours at 15-25°C or 7 days at 2-8°C, and 1 month when frozen once at -20°C.
Controls for both AST assay and ISE module: The Randox assayed human multi-sera
level 2 & 3 (previously cleared under k942458) are the recommended controls for use
with this device. The controls, when reconstituted, are stable for 8 hours at 15-25°C
or 7 days at 2-8°C, and 1 month when frozen once at -20°C.
d. Detection limit:
A detection limit study was evaluated according to CLSI EP-17A. The Limit of Blank
(LoB) was determined by assaying a blank sample 120 times on the Randox Daytona
Plus analyzer. The LoB was determined by using the 95% value.
The limit of detection (LoD) was determined by assaying 120 replicates of two low
level AST samples which were prepared by spiking AST into stripped human serum.
The stock solution containing pure AST was added volumetrically to produce the 2
samples with desired concentrations of 0.5 and 1.0 U/L of AST. The LoD was
determined using the median minus the 5th percentile plus the LoB value.
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was determined by assaying 120 replicates of 7 low
AST sample pools. The LoQ was determined as the lowest concentration sample that
had a %CV of ≤20%.
Analyte LoB LoD LoQ
AST 0.50 U/L 1.37 U/L 5.0 U/L
The claimed measuring range is 5-1116 U/L for the AST assay.
The claimed measuring ranges of the ISE electrolytes were based on the linearity
study and are summarized in the table below.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Samples in sample tubes or sample cups with a tube adaptor are places into sample tray
and automatically measured by the analyzer.
5. Calibration:
Sponsor recommends that user perform a calibration and a quality control measurement
after installing a new lamp, new lot of reagent or a fresh bottle of reagent. ISE calibration
is recommended every 8 hours or when quality control results fall outside the established
ranges. It is recommended that AST be calibrated every 28 days or as needed.
6. Quality Control:
The software contains a quality control program that evaluated control results and
determined if they are within specified acceptable limits.
In the labeling the sponsor recommends that control measurements be assayed daily and
the frequency depends on the test method. Quality control materials should be used in
accordance with local, state and/or federal guidelines.
P. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
