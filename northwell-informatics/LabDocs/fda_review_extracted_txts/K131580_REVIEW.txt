The Tosoh Automated Glycohemoglobin Analyzer HLC-723G8 is intended for in vitro
diagnostic use for the measurement of % hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (DCCT/NGSP) and
mmol/mol hemoglobin A1c (IFCC) in whole blood specimens. This test is to be used as
an aid in diagnosis of diabetes and identifying patients who may be at risk for developing
diabetes.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
This device has known Hemoglobin E (HbE) interference. When a sample is suspected to
contain HbE a flag will be displayed. The HbA1c result will not be reported from the
analyzer.
Hemoglobin A1c should not be used to diagnose diabetes mellitus in patients with a
hemoglobinopathy but normal red cell turnover (e.g. sickle cell trait).
Hemoglobin A1c should not be used to diagnose patients with abnormal red cell turnover
(e.g. anemias from hemolysis and iron deficiency).
Hemoglobin A1c testing should not replace glucose testing for type 1 diabetes, in
pediatric patients and in pregnant women.
This test should not be used to diagnose patients with iron deficiency and hemolytic
anemia, various hemoglobinopathies, thalassemias, hereditary spherocystosis,
malignancies and severe chronic hepatic and renal disease.
Hemoglobin A1c should not be used in pregnant patients, patients with homozygous
sickle cell trait, hemolytic anemia, or other hemolytic diseases, and recent significant or
chronic blood loss.
Hemoglobin A1c should not be used to diagnose diabetes mellitus in patients with
hereditary spherocytosis, malignancies or severe chronic hepatic and renal disease.
Hemoglobin A1c should not be used in the diagnosis of gestational diabetes.
In cases of rapidly evolving type 1 diabetes the increase of HbA1c values might be
delayed compared to the acute increase in glucose concentrations. In these conditions
diabetes mellitus must be diagnosed based on plasma glucose concentration and/or the
typical clinical symptoms.
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
All performance data was conducted using the Tosoh Automated Glycohemoglobin
Analyzer HLC-723G8

I. Device Description:
The Tosoh Automated Glycohemoglobin Analyzer HLC-723G8 is an automated High
Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system that separates and reports stable
A1c (sA1c) percentage in whole blood. The operational portion of the G8 is composed of
a sampling unit, liquid pump, degasser, column, detector, microprocessors, sample
loader, floppy disk drive unit, operation panel and a printer.
The Tosoh Automated Glycohemoglobin Analyzer HLC-723G8 uses non-porous ion-
exchange HPLC for rapid, separation of the stable form of HbA1c from other hemoglobin
fractions. The G8 uses a cation exchange column and separated the hemoglobin
components in the blood into six fractions, A1a, A1b, F, La1c, sA1c and A0. The
separation is done by eluting the hemoglobins from the column with a stepwise elution of
three elution buffers containing different salt concentrations. The result report includes a
sample ID, date, percentage and retention time of each fraction, sA1c percentage and
total A1 percentage (A1a+A1b+sA1c), along with a chromatogram of the elution pattern
of the hemoglobin fractions. If a sample contains a hemoglobin variant, the column
eluted the material depending upon the charge.
Calibrators (Tosoh A1c Calibrator Set) and controls (Canterbury Scientific Hemoglobin
A1c) are recommended for use with this device. The calibrators and controls were
previously cleared under 510(k) numbers k071132 and k021484, respectively.

in the column resin surface and the hemoglobin components. The hemoglobin fractions
(designated as A1a, A1b, F, LA1c+, SA1c, A0, and H-V0, H-V1, H-V2) are subsequently
removed from the column by performing a step-wise elution using the varied salt
concentrations in the Variant Elution Buffers His 1, 2 and 3. The separated hemoglobin
components pass through the LED photometer flow cell where the analyzer measures
changes in absorbance at 415 nm. The analyzer integrates and reduces the raw data, and then
calculates the relative percentages of each hemoglobin fraction. The Total Area of the sA1c
is divided by the sum of the total areas of all peaks, excluding the HbF peak and any variant
peak(s) to obtain a raw sA1c percentage. This uncorrected result is substituted as the “x”
value in the linear regression formula determined during calculation. The analyzer prints the
final numerical results and plots a chromatogram showing changes in absorbance versus
retention time for each peak fraction.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed testing 4 concentrations of unaltered EDTA whole
blood samples at the following targeted HbA1c values: ~5%, ~6.5%, ~8% and ~12%.
Precision was evaluated using three Tosoh Automated Glycohemoglobin HLC-723G8
analyzers and 3 lots of reagent on each analyzer. Measurements of 2 replicates in a
single run, 2 times a day for 20 non-consecutive says for each specimen/ reagent
combination were analyzed for a total of 40 runs and 80 determinants for each data
set.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The assigned HbA1c values of the Tosoh Automated Glycohemoglobin Analyzer are
certified by The National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP). See
the NGSP website for current certification at http://www.ngsp.org.
The final reportable result is traceable to both the International Federation of Clinical
Chemistry (IFCC) and the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). The
International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) units of mmol/mol are
calculated using the Master Equation NGSP (%) =0.09148 x IFCC (mmol/mol) +
2.52. HbA1c results are provided to the customers using two different units: NGSP
equivalent units (%) and IFCC equivalent units (mmol/mol).
Calibrator and Control materials:
Value assignment procedures for calibrators (Tosoh Hemoglobin Alc Calibrator Set)
that are recommended for use with this device were previously reviewed under
submission k071132. Controls (Canterbury Hemoglobin A1c) were previously
cleared under k021484.
Stability
Stability for calibrators (Tosoh A1c Calibrator Set) and controls (Canterbury
Hemoglobin A1c) that are recommended for use with this device were previously
reviewed under 510(k) numbers k071132 and k021484, respectively.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range was previously established in k071132. The reportable range of
this device is 4.0-16.9% HbA1c
e. Analytical specificity:
i.) Endogenous Interference
Studies were performed to assess common or known substances that could interfere
with the Tosoh Automated Glycohemoglobin Analyzer. Whole blood samples with
HbA1c values of 6.5% HbA1c and ~8% HbA1c were analyzed by spiking the
interfering substance into each of the two whole blood samples and then preparing
serial dilutions to achieve 10 concentrations. Ten replicates of each of the ten varying
concentrations were analyzed and compared to the reference sample (sample
containing no interferent). Significant interference was defined as % recovery ≥ +/-
5% of the expected 100% recovery.
The following substances showed that no significant interference at the
concentrations described below:

Conjugated Bilirubin 2.0-21 mg/dL
Lipemia 1-1000 mg/dL
Albumin 500-5000
mg/dL
Ascorbic Acid 3.0-25 mg/dL
Rheumatoid Factor 110-550 IU/mL
ii.) Cross Reactivity
Potential interferences from Acetylated hemoglobin (Hb), Carbamylated Hb,
Aldehyde and Labile HbA1c were evaluated using whole blood samples with HbA1c
values of ~ 6.5% and ~8% HbA1c. The results were concluded as follows:
· Acetylated Hb (up to 50 mg/dL) does not interfere with this assay.
· Carbamylated Hb (up to 25 mg/dL) does not interfere with this assay.
· Labile HbA1c (up to 1000 mg/dL) does not interfere with this assay.
· Aldehyde (up to 25 mg/dL) does not interfere with this assay.
Sponsor states The HPLC chromatogram shows the separation of HbA0, HbA1a, HbA1b,
and HbA1c. The fractions elute in different “windows” and are visible on the
chromatogram. There is no cross reactivity with these substances.
iii.) Hemoglobin Variant Interference:
A hemoglobin variant interference study was performed using a total of 120 samples
known to contain Hemoglobin variants S,C,E,D, A2 and F. Two whole blood patient
samples containing an HbA1c of ~6.5% and ~ 8% and the appropriate Hemoglobin
variant were tested. 10 samples were tested at each of the two HbA1c concentrations of
~6.5 % and ~8%. Testing of the samples containing the Hemoglobin variants S,C,E,D
and F was performed in singlicate. Testing was performed on the Tosoh Automated
Glycohemoglobin HLC-723G8 Analyzer and compared to results obtained by a reference
method that has been demonstrated to be free from the hemoglobin interference being
tested. The following is a table of the samples that were measured.

The following biases between the Tosoh Automated Glycohemoglobin HLC-723G8
Analyzer versus the reference method were observed:
Decision Level Bias %Bias
5.0 0.054 1.08
6.5 0.049 0.75
8.0 0.043 0.54

Total Near Cutoff
Using the results of bias estimation (%Bias) in the method comparison study and
precision estimated in the reproducibility study, Total Error (TE) four concentrations:
(5.0%,6.5%,8.0%, and 12.0%) was calculated as follows: %TE =|%Bias| + 1.96
*%CV*(1+%Bias). The results are presented in the tables below:
Decision Level %Bias %CV %TE
5.0 1.08 1.84 5.8
6.5 0.75 0.68 2.8
8.0 0.54 0.98 3.0
12 0.24 1.31 3.1

The labeling states “The diagnosis of diabetes and identification of persons at increased
risk of developing diabetes follows the ADA Guideline of 6.5% for the cut-off and values
between 5.7% and 6.4% as being at increased risk”.
The labeling also states “Each laboratory should determine a reference interval that
corresponds to the characteristics of the population being tested”
