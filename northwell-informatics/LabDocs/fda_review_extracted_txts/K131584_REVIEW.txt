H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The IMDx Flu A/B and RSV for Abbott m2000 assay performed on the Abbott m2000
System is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test designed for the detection of influenza A,
influenza B, and RSV RNA directly from nasopharyngeal swabs from patients with signs
and symptoms of respiratory infection. The assay detects RNA from influenza A,
influenza B, and RSV (A and B) using real-time, reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (rRT-PCR) and fluorogenic target specific hybridization for unique sequences in
the viral target genomes. The IMDx Flu A/B and RSV for Abbott m2000 assay is
intended for use as an aid in diagnosing influenza A and/or influenza B and/or RSV
infection.
Negative results for influenza A, influenza B, or RSV do not preclude influenza virus or
RSV infection and should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or patient
management decisions. Conversely, positive results do not rule-out bacterial infection or
co-infection with other viruses. The agent(s) detected may not be the definite cause of
disease. The use of additional laboratory testing and clinical presentation must be
considered when diagnosing respiratory viral infection.
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2011-2012
and 2012-2013 influenza seasons when Influenza A/2009 H1N1 and Influenza A/H3
were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation. When other influenza A
viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent
influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture
should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and
culture specimens.

I. Device Description:
The IMDx Flu A/B, and RSV for Abbott m2000 assay uses nucleic acid extraction and
purification technology, performed on the Abbott m2000 Sample Preparation System
(m2000sp), combined with rRT-PCR, performed on the Abbott PCR analyzer (m2000rt), to
generate and detect amplified products from influenza A, influenza B, and RSV RNA that
is isolated from clinical specimens. The presence of a viral RNA target sequence is
indicated by the fluorescent signal generated through the use of fluorescently labeled
oligonucleotide probes on the Abbott m2000rt instrument. The probes do not generate a
signal unless they are specifically bound to the amplified product. The amplification
cycle at which fluorescent signal is detected by the Abbott m2000rt is inversely
proportional to the viral RNA target concentration present in the original sample.
The IMDx Flu A/B and RSV for Abbott m2000 assay consists of two reagent kits:
• IMDx Flu A/B and RSV for Abbott m2000 Amplification Reagent Kit
• IMDx Flu A/B and RSV for Abbott m2000 Control Kit

Sample Preparation
The Abbott m2000sp reagents lyse the virus, capture the nucleic acids with magnetic
microparticles, and wash the particles to remove unbound sample components. The bound
nucleic acids are eluted and transferred to an Abbott 96-Deep-Well Plate. The nucleic acids
are then ready for amplification. The Process Control is introduced into the sample
preparation procedure and is processed along with the controls and specimens.
Reagent Preparation and Reaction Plate Assembly
The Abbott m2000sp combines the IMDx Flu A/B and RSV for Abbott m2000 Amplification
Reagent components (IMDx Flu A/B and RSV Amplification Reagent and IMDx PCR
Reagent-B). It then dispenses the resulting Master Mix into the Abbott 96-Well Optical
Reaction Plate along with aliquots of the nucleic acid samples prepared by the Abbott
m2000sp. After manual application of the Abbott Optical Adhesive Cover, the plate is ready
for transfer to the Abbott m2000rt instrument.
Amplification on the Abbott m2000rt instrument
During the reverse-transcription reaction, viral target RNA is reverse-transcribed into cDNA
by the reverse-transcriptase activity of rTth polymerase enzyme. During the
amplification/detection reaction, the target cDNA is amplified by the DNA polymerase
activity of the rTth enzyme, in the presence of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) and
manganese. The IMDx Flu A/B and RSV for Abbott m2000 Amplification Reagent contains
specific sets of amplification primers for influenza A, influenza B, RSV A, RSV B and
Process Control. During PCR amplification, high temperature is used to separate the strands
of double stranded DNA. When the reaction is cooled to a temperature at which DNA
annealing can again occur, the analyte-specific, single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide
primers bind to the analyte DNA. The primers are extended by DNA polymerase, thereby
making an exact copy of a short stretch of the analyte DNA target region.
During each round of thermal cycling, amplification products dissociate to single strands at
high temperature, allowing primer annealing and extension as the temperature is lowered.
Exponential amplification of the target is achieved through repeated cycling between higher
and lower temperatures. Amplification of the influenza A, influenza B, RSV A, RSV B, and
Process Control RNA targets takes place simultaneously in the same reaction.
Detection
During each round of PCR amplification, the fluorescent probes anneal to the amplified
target DNA. The probes are labeled with different fluorescent molecules allowing influenza
A, influenza B, RSV and Process Control RNA targets to be distinguished from each other.
RSV A and RSV B are both detected using the same fluorophore and are not discriminated
from one another. The probes are single-stranded, linear DNA oligonucleotides modified
with a fluorescent moiety covalently linked to one end of the probe and a quenching moiety
to the other end. When the probe binds to its complementary sequence in the target, the
fluorophore is released, allowing fluorescent emission and detection.
7

--- Page 8 ---
Since this fluorescence occurs during every cycle, the PCR reaction can be read in real-time.
The amplification cycle at which fluorescent signal is detected by the Abbott m2000rt is
inversely proportional to the viral RNA target concentration present in the original sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-Laboratory Repeatability:
For within-laboratory repeatability study, a sixteen-member panel was tested twice a
day for twelve days. The panel was prepared using five viral strains; two influenza A
strains (Influenza A/Swine/NY/02/09 (H1N1) and Influenza A/Brisbane/10/07
(H3N2)), one influenza B strain (Influenza B/Florida/04/2006), and two RSV strains
(RSV A (RSV Type A) and RSV B (RSV B CH93-(18)-18)). Each strain was spiked
into viral transport medium targeting three concentration levels: Moderate Positive
(2-3x LoD), Low Positive (1x LoD) and High Negative (0.2x – 0.8x LoD). Panel
members were tested in replicates of three for each run (for a total of 1152 data points
for the 24 runs). Percent CV (%CV) was calculated for all replicates based on CN
(cycle number) values. Percent agreement was calculated based on the expected
result (detected or not detected) for each panel member. Moderate and low positive
samples were expected to be reported as detected. The high negative was represented
by a near cut-off sample since a C sample (results are detected ~5% of the time) is
5
difficult to obtain for an ultrasensitive test. The result with such a high negative was
expected to be reported as detected only 20-80% of the time, and negative samples
were expected to be reported as not detected.

d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined by limiting dilution studies using re-
cultured and re-titered viral stocks provided by an outside vendor. Two strains of each
viral type: influenza A, influenza B, and RSV, were tested. Six 10-fold dilutions of each
strain were prepared using viral transport medium. The concentration generating ≥95%
positivity is determined and further tested in replicates of 20. LoD was defined as the
lowest concentration to yield 19/20 positive replicates.

g. Microbial interference:
The same organisms that were tested in the cross reactivity study were evaluated in
the microbial interference study. They were added to sample tubes containing one of
the six target organisms; two influenza A, two influenza B and two RSV strains in
viral transport medium. Assay analytes were present in the samples at concentrations
~2-3x LoD. Each of the six strains was tested against a panel of 36 test organisms in
triplicate using the IMDx Flu A/B and RSV for Abbott m2000 assay. The data
showed no interference with the organisms tested.
h. Competitive interference:
Competitive Interference of the IMDx Flu A/B and RSV for Abbott m2000 assay was
evaluated using simulated samples containing pairs of target viruses (influenza A and
influenza B, influenza A and RSV, influenza B and RSV) at two different
concentrations. One of the concentrations was near the LoD (2-3X LoD) while the

other concentration was 2x104 TCID /mL (104-106X LoD). There was no observed
50
interference in the competitive interference study; high concentration targets do not
interfere with the detection of a low concentration target that was tested at 2-3X LoD.
i. Interference:
A panel of potentially interfering substances (listed in the table below) and two
strains of each viral type at a final concentration of approximately 2-3x LoD
were evaluated in the interference study. None of the substances showed
inhibition when tested at concentrations presented in the table below. In addition to
®
these substances, FluMist Influenza vaccine was tested for its ability to interfere
with the IMDx Flu A/B and RSV for Abbott m2000 assay. Initial testing of FluMist
(that contains live attenuated reassortants of each of the three strains:
A/California/07/2009 (H1N1), A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2), and B/Brisbane/60/2008)
alone without any target virus strain gave detected signals for influenza A and B at a
6.5 7.5
concentration of 10 to 10 units, but the influenza A, and influenza B CN values
were higher than expected, indicating that the assay detected the viruses present in the
vaccine. The vaccine was diluted further to ~1 x 108 till no vaccine virus strains
could be detected. When FluMist® was tested at this dilution in the presence of the
target virus strains using the IMDx FluA/B and RSV for Abbott m2000 assay,
influenza A, influenza B, and RSV were detected as expected.

j. Carryover contamination:
The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of target carryover and cross
contamination between samples when using the IMDx Flu A/B and RSV for Abbott
m2000 assay. A minimum of five extraction runs were performed with alternating
high positive and negative samples. The total number of samples run across the 5
extractions was 470, of which 235 were positive and 235 negative. The carryover
rate for the three targets was 2.1%, 0.9% and 0.9% for the influenza A, influenza B
and RSV targets respectively. Therefore, the overall carryover rate of 1.3% was
reported for the IMDx Flu A/B and RSV for Abbott m2000 assay.
k. Fresh Vs. Frozen:
A fresh vs. frozen specimen study was performed by comparing samples that were
stored unfrozen (Day 0) to samples frozen at ~ -20°C for 35 days. Samples were
tested prior to freezing (Day 0) to provide a baseline value and Day 0 values were
compared to values obtained after freezing. Samples were tested in triplicates after
freezing. Assay results were assessed for a change in result call (positive to negative,
negative to positive, or either positive or negative to invalid) over the storage time
period. In addition, the CN averages for each target and viral transport medium were
monitored. All samples showed 100% detection after freezing for 35 days.

A second study was performed using frozen clinical specimens (12 influenza A, 7
influenza B, 14 RSV) that had been tested prior to freezing by an FDA-cleared
molecular method. These samples were frozen at -70° C for up to 24 months. These
frozen clinical samples were tested with one lot of IMDx Flu A/B and RSV for
Abbott m2000 assay reagents. 100% concordance was observed between fresh and
frozen results.
Freeze-Thaw stability:
The freeze/thaw cycle study was conducted with 5 viral transport media: M4, M4RT, M5,
M6, and UTM with three viral strains representative of the assay targets, influenza A -
Influenza A/Swine/NY/02/2009, influenza B - Influenza B/Florida/04/06, and RSV -
RSV A Type A strain. Aliquots of specimens were removed from the freezer and
allowed to come to ambient temperature for 1 to 3 hours, then returned to the ~ -20°C
freezer for 1 to 3 hours. Samples were tested in replicates of three after 1, 2, and 3
freeze/thaw cycles. The freeze thaw study demonstrated that samples were stable in all
media types for up to 3 successive freeze/thaw cycles.

l. Assay cut-off:
The initial maxRatio (MR) threshold parameters set for the IMDx Flu A/B and RSV
for Abbott m2000 assay were evaluated using known influenza A, influenza B, and
RSV-positive and negative samples. The sample set for analysis consisted of 479
nasopharyngeal swabs samples that had 110 Flu A positive, 84 Flu B positive, 159
RSV positive, and 126 negative results.
MR values for influenza A, influenza B, and RSV positive and negative samples were
plotted individually and the mean and standard deviation were calculated for each
component. The MR threshold was established to be at least 5 standard deviations
above the average MR values of the negative sample cohort.
Thresholds were set as follows: influenza A was set to 0.020, influenza B was set to
0.020 and RSV was set to 0.010. The final threshold values used in the assay are
provided in the table below:

Equivalency between different viral transport media
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate equivalency among a variety of
different transport media (Remel: M4, M4RT, M5, M6, Copan: UTM). For each
transport medium being tested, twenty (20) replicates each of influenza A, influenza
B, and RSV (60 replicates total) were formulated to provide organisms in transport
medium that were at concentrations of approximately 2-3X LoD.
Table below shows the detection rates and CN values obtained for all viral transport
media test sets. The maximum CN differences across transport media were
calculated for each virus tested. All the average CN values were within 0.8 CN of
each other.

Equivalency between negative clinical matrix and viral transport medium
The purpose of this study was to show that the negative specimen matrix in viral
transport medium was equivalent to viral transport medium without matrix when
testing the IMDx Flu A/B and RSV for Abbott m2000 assay.
Contrived specimens were prepared by diluting two of the target viruses (influenza A,
and RSV) in viral transport medium containing negative specimen matrix, and in viral
transport medium alone at ~3X LoD. Comparable CN values were obtained across
matrices; the ΔCN values observed between matrix types, for both virus targets and
process controls, ranged from 0.05 to 0.49.

3. Clinical studies:
The performance of the IMDx Flu A/B and RSV for Abbott m2000 assay was assessed
during the course of two influenza seasons (2011-2012 and 2012-2013). For the 2011 -
2012 season, four geographically diverse test sites within the United States prospectively
collected influenza A/B and RSV samples. Samples enrolled for this study were
Nasopharyngeal Swabs (562 specimens) collected for routine influenza testing. A total
of seven (7) samples yielded an error message and were categorized as “unresolved
errors/invalid” yielding an overall invalid rate of 1.24%. In addition, 58 samples were
withdrawn and were not included in the final data set. Of these 58 samples, 41 had
incomplete reference method (viral culture) testing therefore no viral culture result available
for interpretation, 9 samples had insufficient volume for IMDx Flu A/B and RSV for
Abbott m2000 testing, 7 samples were excluded because the site utilized a sample
dilution procedure outside of manufacturer’s instructions for use, and one sample had
reference method contamination, no viral culture result available for interpretation. A
total of four hundred and ninety seven (497) valid specimens were included in the final
data set and analyzed for product performance.
For the 2012-2013 season, three geographically diverse laboratory test sites participated
in the study. All samples enrolled during the 2012-2013 influenza season were NPS
received by the laboratory for routine influenza testing. A total of five hundred and
twenty seven (527) NPS samples were enrolled. Three samples yielded an error message
and were categorized as “unresolved errors”. These samples were considered to be
invalid (0.57% invalid rate). In addition, 89 samples were withdrawn due to protocol
deviations/delayed shipping and were not included in the final data set. For the 2012-
2013 season, a total of 435 valid NPS samples were included in the final data set and
analyzed for product performance.
Between the two influenza seasons, a total of 932 NPS samples were tested and analyzed
for performance. The gender and age demographics of samples included in the study are
presented below.

5Of the 58 RSV false positive results observed, thirty-nine (39) were confirmed as RSV positives by FDA cleared
molecular assay. Nineteen (19) remained discrepant.
6Of the three (3) RSV false negative results observed, one (1) was confirmed as negative by FDA cleared molecular
assay. Two (2) remained discrepant.
Assay positive and negative quality controls were run with each IMDx Flu A/B and RSV
for Abbott m2000 assay run. No quality control failures were observed during the course
of the method comparison study.
4. Clinical cut-off:
MR threshold parameters were validated using data compiled at three test sites from 533
(188 positive, 345 negative) nasopharyngeal swab samples compared to the reference
method. The table below shows the observed MR results for influenza A/B and RSV.
The observed MR ranges for positive and negative samples were consistent with those
observed for internal assay cut-off evaluation study, thus indicating that threshold values
for Flu A/B and RSV were set appropriately for the assay.

and 2012-2013 seasons combined.
No dual infections were detected by viral culture, but the IMDx Flu A/B and RSV for
Abbott m2000 assay found 1.9% (18 specimens) of the total infections to be dual
infections. Of these 18 specimens, 1 was positive for influenza A and influenza B, 5
were positive for influenza A and RSV, and 12 were positive for influenza B and RSV.
The IMDx Flu A/B and RSV for Abbott m2000 assay also detected one triple infection,
positive for influenza A, influenza B and RSV.
N. Instrument Name:
Abbott® m2000TM system
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Abbott m2000 System is comprised of:
· An automated sample preparation instrument system (m2000sp),
· A real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) thermal cycler/reader instrument
system (m2000rt)
· Independent workstations for each system above
· Separate software for the m2000sp and the m2000rt systems
The Abbott m2000 System processes up to 96 specimens, controls, and calibrators in
batch mode by parameters that are contained in individual assay application
specifications. The Abbott m2000 system used with the IMDx Flu A/B and RSV for
Abbott m2000 assay is a closed platform, with proprietary, closed software; users can
neither modify assay application specifications nor change software specifications used to
generate results. Instrument system software has been validated by Abbott Molecular.

5. Calibration:
Optical calibration of the Abbott m2000rt instrument is required for the accurate
measurement and differentiation of dye fluorescence during the IMDx Flu A/B and RSV
for Abbott m2000 assay. The following Abbott m2000rt Optical Calibration Plates are
used to calibrate the Abbott m2000rt instrument for the IMDx Flu A/B and RSV for
m2000 assay:
· FAM™ Plate (Carboxyfluorescein): Part No. 50-805035
· VIC® Plate (Proprietary dye): Part No. 50-805045
· ROX Plate (Carboxy-X-rhodamine): Part No. 50-805015
· CY5™ Plate (Proprietary dye): Part No. 50-805040
· TAMRA Plate (5(6)-carboxytetramethylrhodamine, succinimidyl ester): Part No. 50-
805005
6. Quality Control:
Positive and negative controls:
Positive control contains a mixture of synthetic influenza A, influenza B, RSV-A, and
RSV-B RNA in buffer.
Negative control (IMDx Negative Control-B) is viral transport medium negative for
assay target nucleic acids. When the negative control tube is loaded onto the m2000sp,
an equal volume of lysis buffer containing the inactivated MS2 RNA bacteriophage
process control is added before sample preparation.
One positive control and one negative control must be included in each run to monitor
run validity. If either the positive control or negative control is out of predetermined
range, an error message is generated and no results for the plates are reported. All of the
specimens and controls from that run must be reprocessed, beginning with sample
preparation.
The presence of influenza A, influenza B, and RSV targets must not be detected in the
IMDx Negative Control-B. Detection of influenza A, influenza B, and/or RSV RNA
targets in the IMDx Negative Control-B is indicative of contamination by other samples
or by amplified product introduced during sample preparation or during preparation of
the Abbott 96-Well Optical Reaction Plate.
Process control:
The IMDx Process Control-B is composed of an RNA bacteriophage unrelated to
influenza and RSV viruses. Prior to sample preparation, a defined, consistent quantity of
the IMDx Process Control-B is dispensed into lysis buffer (mLysis ). It is then added
DNA
to each sample during the processing of each specimen and control, RT-PCR amplified
by reagents included in the Amplification Reagent mix, and measured on the Abbott
m2000rt instrument to demonstrate proper sample processing and assay validity.

IMDx Process Control-B CN and MR assay validity parameters are encoded in the IMDx
Flu A/B and RSV for Abbott m2000 application files installed on the Abbott m2000sp
and Abbott m2000rt systems from the IMDx Flu A/B and RSV for Abbott m2000 System
ROW Combined Application CD-ROM. An error is displayed when a specimen or
control fails to meet these validity specifications. The user must refer to the Abbott
m2000rt Operations Manual for an explanation of the corrective actions for the error
code. Samples for which the IMDx Process Control-B CN value falls outside of the
established range must be retested using the original specimen.
