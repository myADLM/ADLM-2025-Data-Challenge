hydrogen peroxide with potassium iodide chromogen causing the color to change from blue-
green to greenish-brown.
Protein: The Urinary Protein test is based on the protein error-of-indicator principle. At a
constant pH, the development of any green color is due to the presence of protein. Colors
range from yellow for a negative reaction to yellow-green and blue-green for a positive
reaction.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within run precision studies were performed at three testing sites within the same day
by three users by testing 20 replicates of three levels of one lot of urine controls using
three lots of the device. Between-run precision studies were performed at three
testing sites by 3 operators testing 3 levels of urine controls with 3 lots of the device
by performing 4 replicate tests a day of 5 consecutive days for a total of 180
determinations. Visually read qualitative and semi-quantitative results were
evaluated. The results are summarized in the table below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
See (d) Detection limit for sensitivity studies across the range of test pad
concentrations
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Stability:
Shelf-life stability for the test strips was determined by accelerated testing. The
accelerated test results support a shelf life of 24 months for sealed pouches stored at
room temperature (15-30˚C). An ongoing real-time stability study is currently being
performed to validate the shelf-life stability claims of the accelerated testing. Open-
bottle stability is not applicable because the reagent strips are provided one strip per
pouch and are intended to be used immediately after opening. The stability testing
protocol and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
d. Detection limit:
To determine the sensitivity range of the glucose and protein color blocks, different
concentrations of glucose and albumin were spiked into a negative urine sample to
yield intermediate glucose and protein concentrations of 0 to 3000 mg/dL. Each of
the concentrations was tested 20 times at one testing site by 3 users using 3 different
lots of the device for a total of 180 readings. The sponsor defines sensitivity as the
concentration where 95% of the test results yield the expected result. The results are
summarized below:

Cross Reactivity Studies
The device was tested with compounds similar to glucose and protein to assess cross
reactivity with the measurands. Aliquots of urine samples containing 100 mg/dL and
500 mg/dL glucose were spiked with galactose, fructose, lactose, and sucrose to
evaluate their cross reactivity with the determination of glucose in urine with the

device. Aliquots of urine samples containing 15 mg/dL and 100 mg/dL of protein
were spiked with BSA, globulin, hemoglobin, Bence-Jones protein, and mucoprotein
to evaluate their cross reactivity with the determination of protein in urine with the
device. The study demonstrated that the urine glucose test did not react with any of
the glucose analogues at concentrations up to 500 mg/dL. The urine protein test was
specific for albumin, but also had some reactivity to globulin and Bence-Jones protein
at concentrations higher than 100 mg/dL.

Interference Studies
The device was evaluated to assess the effects of potential interfering compounds on
the measurands. Ketones, hemoglobin, ascorbic acid, bilirubin, MESNA, and sodium
acetate were spiked into urine glucose aliquots containing 0, 100, 250, and 500 mg/dL
of glucose and urine protein aliquots containing 0, 15, 30, and 100 mg/dL of protein
to evaluate the interfering effects of these substances on protein and glucose
determination by the device. Interference from urine specific gravity and urine pH
were also assessed by testing glucose and protein in urine with a pH range of 5.0 to
9.0 and a specific gravity range of 1.000 to 1.030. The specimens were run in one
day, at one testing site, by three operators using 3 different lots of the device. The
protein and glucose results from the urine containing the potential interferents were
compared to protein and glucose results from urine which did not contain the
interfering substance. The sponsor defines interference as the concentration of a
substance that causes the test reading to be incorrect by at least one color block. The
interference study demonstrated that ascorbic acid at levels of 50 mg/dL had a false
positive interference effect on the urine protein test; and MESNA at 25 mg/dL had a
false positive interference effect on both the urine protein and urine glucose tests. In
addition, hemoglobin at concentrations of ≥ 100 mg/dL resulted in an atypical color

on both the glucose and protein color pads.
The interference study demonstrated that there was no significant interference at the
highest concentration tested for the determination of urine protein and urine glucose
by the device for the following substances: bilirubin (5.0 mg/dL), ketone (80 mg/dL),
and sodium acetate (45 mg/dL). In addition, the study demonstrated that a urine pH
range of 5.0 to 9.0 and a urine specific gravity range of 1.000 to 1.0030 had no effect
on the urine protein or urine glucose tests.
The sponsor states in the package insert labeling:
· Glucose test results may be lower if user is taking vitamin C or MESNA,
commonly used in cancer chemotherapy.
· Protein test results may be lower if user is taking MESNA.
· User should not perform tests during menstrual period as high concentration of
blood in urine could cause inaccurate results.
· Hemoglobin concentration of 100 mg/dL or above causes atypical color or urine
which renders the urine glucose and urine protein tests invalid.

Lay user studies were conducted at three sites. Each site had 54 lay user participants.
The participants performed the test on their own fresh urine (in-stream) using the
candidate device according to the package insert labeling printed in English only.
Aliquots of the participants’ fresh urine were provided to healthcare professionals
who performed comparison tests using the predicate device. For urine protein, 6
negative urine samples were spiked with albumin stock solution; and for urine
glucose, 6 negative urine samples were spiked with glucose stock solution to obtain
additional specimens in the >2000 mg/dL range. The spiked urine specimens were
tested by 12 lay users and the results were compared to those obtained by professional
testing. The comparison studies were performed in singlet, at random and were
blinded. The method comparison results are summarized below.

Labeling Evaluation
A labeling evaluation was performed in conjunction with the lay user study. Study
participants were asked to answer questionnaires to determine the usability of the test and
the instructions given on the package insert. The readability of the package insert was
assessed at 8.4 Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level. Results demonstrated that 98% of
respondents found the package insert easy to understand, 85% found performing the test
and reading the color chart not difficult, and 95% of respondents understood the meaning
of the results of the tests.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The expected values are included in the labeling and are taken from literature references.
Urine Glucose: Small amounts of glucose are normally excreted by the kidney. Urine
glucose concentrations up to 100 mg/dL are considered normal, but may be abnormal if
found consistently. 1
Urine Protein: Small amounts of protein may be excreted by the normal kidney. Urine
protein concentrations up to 15 mg/dL are considered normal, but may be abnormal if
found consistently.2
