I. Device Description:
The Elecsys CMV IgG assay is a two-step sandwich immunoassay which uses streptavidin
microparticles, biotinylated recombinant CMV-specific antigen labeled with a ruthenium
complex, and electrochemiluminescence detection. The results are determined using a
calibration curve generated by two-point calibration and a master curve provided via the
reagent bar code. Results greater than or equal to 1.0 COI are considered reactive for CMV
IgG antibody. The test system contains the human serum-based calibrators intended for use
with the system.
The Elecsys PreciControl CMV IgG contains liquid control serum based on human serum.
The controls are used for monitoring the accuracy of the Elecsys CMV IgG assay.

L. Test Principle:
The test utilizes a sandwich principle. The total duration of the assay is 18 minutes and
involves the following steps:
- 1st incubation: 20 µL of sample, biotinylated recombinant CMV-specific antigens, and
CMV-specific recombinant antigens labeled with a ruthenium complex form a sandwich
complex.
- 2nd incubation: After addition of streptavidin-coated microparticles, the complex
becomes bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and streptavidin.
- The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are
magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances are then
removed with ProCell/ProCell M. Application of a voltage to the electrode then induces
chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier.
- Results are determined via a calibration curve which is generated by two-point calibration

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Calibration Stability:
Two studies were conducted to evaluate the calibration stability; lot calibration
stability and on-board calibration stability.
1. Lot Calibration Stability: The lot calibration stability was determined by
comparing the calibration for two kits of the same lot. On day 1, the first
reagent kit was opened and calibrated, and samples were measured at days 1
and 28 on one cobas e 411 (analytically equivalent to the Elecsys 2010, the
master analyzer for these analytical studies). All samples in both panels were
measured in duplicate with one reagent lot in one run per day on days 1 and
28. The acceptance criteria were met for lot calibration stability of 28 days on
the cobas e 411.
2. On-board Calibration Stability: On-board calibration stability for the Elecsys
CMV IgG test system was tested on one cobas e 411 immunoassay analyzer
and on one MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 immunoassay analyzer. One
reagent kit was opened and samples were measured on day 1. The same
samples were then retested after 8 days (e 411 Panel A and all E170 data) and
after 15 days (e 411 Panel B data) with reagent bottles kept at 20±3°C (on-
board condition) using the calibration from day 1. Recovery was calculated
based on the initial values. All samples were tested in duplicate with one
reagent lot on one cobas e 411 and one MODULAR ANALTYICS E170, one
run per day (two runs day 1) on two days. The specification was met for on-
board calibration stability of 8 days on cobas e 411 and MODULAR
ANALYTICS E170 immunoassay analyzers.
Calibrator Stability:
The calibrator stability was evaluated by two studies; calibrator stability at 2-8°C and
open vial calibrator stability.
Stability at 2-8°C for 21 days after first opening: Reference and on-test materials
were tested in duplicate with one reagent lot in one run per day on one Elecsys 2010
analyzer. The on-test material was opened and kept at 2-8°C for 8 weeks. It was
measured at day 0 and at 8 weeks. The on-test recovery was calculated as the signal
(counts) of the reference value. The acceptance criteria was a recovery of signal
(counts) 90-110 %. The acceptance specification for stability for 8 weeks after first
opening was met for an Elecsys CMV IgG Calibrators 1 and 2.
Open Vial Stability: Reference and open vial, on-test materials were tested in
duplicate with one reagent lot on one Elecsys 2010 analyzer and on one MODULAR
ANALYTICS E170. The on-test material was opened and kept at 25°C for 6 hours on
7

--- Page 8 ---
Elecsys 2010 and for 2 hours on a MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 to simulate on-
board conditions. Opened on-test material was also kept at 32°C for 6 hours on
Elecsys 2010 and for 2 hours on one MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 to simulate on-
board conditions. Every hour each calibrator was tested and the on-test recovery of
signal (counts) was calculated as a percent of the reference value. The acceptance
criteria were recovery of signal (counts) 90-110 %. The specification was met for
open vial stability of 5 hours at 25°C on both the cobas e 411 and of 2 hours on the
MODULAR ANALYTICS E170.
Preci-Control Value Assignment:
The Elecsys CMV IgG calibrators and Elecsys PreciControl CMV IgG values are
assigned through six independent series of analysis are performed on each instrument.
All samples are tested in duplicate. The sample recovery (COI) is calculated as the
median of each sample as reference to the target value: PC0: <0.25 COI, PC1: 1.5
COI, PC2: 25 COI
Stability of PreciControl CMV IgG:
To test the stability of the PreciControl CMV IgG the following studies were
conducted:
Stability at 2-8°C for 8 weeks after first opening:
Stressed and unstressed samples of PreciControl CMV IgG were tested in duplicate
with one reagent lot in one run per day on one Elecsys 2010 analyzer. All samples
met the predetermined acceptance specification for signal recovery of (counts) 90-
110 %. Elecsys PreciControl CMV IgG levels 1, 2, and 3 are stable up to 8 weeks.
Open Vial Stability:
Samples were tested in singlicate with one reagent lot on one Elecsys 2010 analyzer
and on one cobas e 601. The specifications for controls 0, 1, and 2 were met, and
PreciControl CMV IgG was stable up to 6 hours on Elecsys 2010 and up to 2 hours
on cobas e 601/MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 at 25°C.
Shelf Life Stability:
The samples tested were kept at 2-8°C and tested in duplicate at several time points
during and beyond the shelf life time of 21 months. Stability was measured by
comparing the measurements of the stressed controls with the measurements of the
unstressed controls. The acceptance specifications for Controls 0, 1, and 2 were
met. Elecsys PreciControl CMV IgG was stable up to at least 22 months. This
supports the claimed shelf life of 21 months.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference Study:
To evaluate the effect of elevated levels of hemoglobin, bilirubin, intralipid, biotin,
total protein and rheumatoid factor on the CMV IgG assay, six CMV IgG samples (2
negative, 2 near cutoff and 2 positive) were spiked with the potential interferents. All
samples were tested in duplicate on the Elecsys 2010 analyzer. Acceptance criteria
were recovery of ± 15 %.
The results of the Interference Study are presented below:
Interferent tested No interference up to
Hemoglobin < 0.623 mmol/L or < 1.0 g/dL
Bilirubin < 1129 µmol/L or < 66 mg/dL
Intralipid < 2000 mg/dL
Biotin < 409 mmol/L or < 100 ng/mL
Total protein < 20 g/dL
Rheumatoid factor < 1600 IU/mL
Cross-reactivity:
A study was conducted to evaluate the Elecsys CMV IgG assay for potential
cross-reactivity using samples from individuals with antibodies to various medical
conditions. Specimens (n = 249) were tested in duplicate with both the Elecsys CMV IgG
assay and the predicate assay. At least 3 CMV IgG negative samples and positive for
each potential cross reactant were required to rule out potential cross reactivity. No
potential cross-reactivity was detected for samples with antibodies to EBV, HAV, HBV,
HCV, HIV, HSV, HTLV, Influenza vaccine, Rubella, Treponema pallidum or
Toxoplasma gondii. Potential cross-reactivity with the vector E. coli and autoimmune
markers could not be ruled out from the study. The potential cross-reactivity was not
evaluated for VZV IgG, Measles IgG, Mumps IgG and Parvo-B19 IgG. The following
table shows the results of testing the samples for each potential cross reactant with both
the Elecsys CMV IgG assay and the predicate device. Due to the high prevalence of
CMV IgG antibodies many samples were positive by the Elecsys CMV IgG assay. All of
the Elecsys CMV IgG positives were confirmed positive by the predicate device with the
exception of one discordant sample for HTLV.

f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cut-off value was established from in-house studies by measuring a panel
of 931 samples. A Receiver Operator Curve (ROC) analysis was used to optimize
sensitivity and specificity. The cut-off value was validated in the clinical study.
g. High Dose Hook-Effect:
Four high-titer CMV IgG samples of human serum were diluted with negative human
serum in a dilution series with 11 dilution steps. Each dilution was tested in triplicate
with one reagent lot in one run on one Elecsys 2010 analyzer. No hook effect was
observed up to 2,500 COI.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
See Clinical Study
b. Matrix comparison:
The effect on recovery of analyte in the presence of anticoagulants with the Elecsys
CMV IgG was determined on the Elecsys 2010 immunoassay analyzer by comparing
values obtained from human samples drawn into serum, lithium-heparin plasma, K2 -
EDTA plasma, and K3 -EDTA plasma. A total of 38 serum/plasma pairs at three
concentrations (negative, near cut-off, and positive) per sample material were tested
with one reagent lot in three runs on one Elecsys 2010 immunoassay analyzer. The
reference for all sample types was serum drawn into serum primary tubes (without
gel). The acceptance criteria for negative samples was a change in signal less than 0.2
from the serum sample, and for positive samples a recovery of ±20% when compared
to serum. The results support the use of the following plasma types: lithium-heparin,
K -EDTA, and K -EDTA. Acceptance specifications are tabulated below.

b. Method Comparison Between Analyzers:
The equivalence of results from the Elecsys CMV IgG assay when run on the
Elecsys 2010 and MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 immunoassay analyzers was
evaluated by a method comparison study. A total of 137 native serum samples were
tested in singlicate with one reagent lot on one Elecsys 2010 analyzer and one
MODULAR ANALYTICS E170 analyzer. Of these samples, 7 were negative, 119
were positive and 11 were near cut-off. Positive and negative agreements of the
results between the two platforms were calculated. The results are summarized in the
following table.
MODULAR ANALYTICS E170

Positive 119 0 0
Border 0 10 0
Elecsys 2010
Negative 0 1 7
Total 119 11 7
Total n = 137
Concordance rates:
Negative agreement - 7/8 = 87.5 % Concordance
Positive agreement - 119/119 = 100 % Concordance

b. Clinical specificity:
Not Applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
A multi-center study was conducted in the U.S. to evaluate the ability of the Elecsys
CMV IgG assay to detect anti-CMV IgG antibodies. The clinical samples consisted of
the following: a total of 605 samples, of which 400 samples were from a population
of patients in which a CMV IgG test was ordered and 205 samples were from
pregnant women in which a CMV IgG test was ordered.
Testing of specimens was done at two clinical testing sites and one internal site. The
results of these studies are presented in the following tables.
