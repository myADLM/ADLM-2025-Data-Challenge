Instant-View Multi-Drug of Abuse Urine Test Cup:
The Instant-View Multi-Drug of Abuse Urine Test Cup is a rapid, qualitative immunoassay
for the detection of one or more of the following drugs in human urine. This device is for
over the counter use and may detect any combination of the drugs or drug metabolites at or
above the specified cut-off level listed below.

Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) and High-Performance Liquid
Chromatography (HPLC), or the like are the preferred confirmation methods for most
drugs in urine. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to
any drug test result, particularly when evaluating preliminary positive results.

4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable; this is a visually read, single use device
I. Device Description:
The Instant-View® Multi-Drug of Abuse Urine Test Cup and the Instant-View® Multi-Drug of
Abuse Urine Test Panel are one-step lateral flow chromatographic immunoassays. Each device
consists of any combination of one to twelve individual test strip(s) for the analyte(s) being tested.
Each test strip in the device consists of 1) a conjugate pad containing colloidal gold coupled with
the anti-drug antibodies and 2) nitrocellulose membrane containing a test line (T line) coated with
the conjugated drug antigen and a control line (C line). The C line serves as an internal quality
control of the system and appears as a burgundy-colored band during the test regardless of the
presence of the drug.

L. Test Principle:
.
Each device employs lateral flow immunochromatographic technology and is based on
the principle of competitive binding. Drugs, if present in concentrations below the
cutoff level, will not saturate the binding sites of the antibody coated particles on the
drug specific test strips. The goat-anti-rabbit IgG antibody-coated particles will then
be captured by immobilized drug-specific conjugate. If the level of drug in the urine
specimen is below the cutoff concentration, the T line appears as a visible burgundy
line. If the level of drug in the urine specimen is above the cutoff, no T line develops.
The control line (C line) serves as an internal quality control. The control line should always
appear as a burgundy-colored band regardless of the presence of the drug, if enough sample
volume has been added to the test and if the sample has correctly migrated up the test strip.
Testing is based on the principle of a competitive immunochemical reaction between a
chemically labeled drug (drug-protein conjugate) and the drug or drug metabolites which may
be present in the urine sample competing for the limited antibody binding sites.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Eleven analytes of the candidate devices were previously cleared for OTC use under k063545.
The additional analytes of the candidate devices: morphine/opiates 300 and oxycodone 100, were
cleared separately for OTC use under k100051. The candidate devices contain test strips identical
to k063545 and k100051. Specimen matrix, test formats, and cut-off concentrations and analytes
are also identical.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
See k063545 and k100051
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. The assays produce qualitative results only.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
See k063545 and k100051
d. Detection limit:
See k063545 and k100051
e. Analytical specificity:
For cross-reactivity information see k063545 and k100051.
Interference studies were conducted to evaluate the potential of interference between
drug analytes contained in the panel and cup formats. These studies were conducted by
three operators using three lots of tests (panel and cup). Expected results were obtained

--- Page 6 ---
for all drugs (no interference observed).
Exogenous interference was also evaluated. The common compounds listed in this
table were found not to interfere with test results at a test concentration of
100µg/mL. The study results for both formats (cup and panel) are the same.

pH and specific gravity conditions:
The effects of variable ranges of pH and specific gravity conditions were evaluated,
including a pH range of 3 to 9 and a specific gravity range of 0.900 to 1.050
g/mL. It was observed that pH ranges from pH 5 to pH 9 and specific gravity
ranges from 1.002 – 1.035 g/mL did not affect the expected testing results (cup
or panel).

Participants recruited had educational levels from elementary school to college or
higher and varied occupations including student, restaurant worker, teacher, stay at
home mom, engineer, cashier, etc. All participants completed questionnaires after
they completed the testing. The majority of the participants stated that the devices
were very easy to operate and they had no difficulties in interpreting the results.
