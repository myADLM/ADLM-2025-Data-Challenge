H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The LZI Oral Fluid Methamphetamine Enzyme Immunoassay is intended for the
qualitative and semi-quantitative determination of d-methamphetamine in neat human
oral fluid, collected into the LZI Oral Fluid Collector, at the cutoff value of 50 ng/mL.
The assay is designed for prescription use with a number of automated clinical chemistry
analyzers.
The assay provides only a preliminary analytical result. A more specific alternative
chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas
or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS or LC/MS) is the preferred
confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be
exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary test
result is positive.
The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of (1) enabling laboratories to determine an
appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as
GCMS and LCMS or (2) permitting laboratories to establish quality control procedures.
The LZI Oral Fluid Methamphetamine Calibrators are for use as calibrators in the
qualitative and semi-quantitative calibration of the LZI Oral Fluid Methamphetamine
Enzyme Immunoassay at the cutoff value of 50 ng/mL.
The LZI Oral Fluid Methamphetamine Controls are for use as assayed quality control
materials to monitor the precision of the LZI Oral Fluid Methamphetamine Enzyme
Immunoassay at the cutoff value of 50 ng/mL.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The assay is designed for prescription use with a number of clinical chemistry analyzers.

I. Device Description:
The LZI Oral Fluid Methamphetamine Enzyme Immunoassay is a kit comprised of two
reagents, which are bottled separately but sold together within the kit. Reagent 1 contains
mouse monoclonal anti-methamphetamine antibody, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P)
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), stabilizers, and sodium azide (0.09%) as a
preservative. Reagent 2contains methamphetamine-labeled glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in buffer with sodium azide (0.09%) as preservative. Oral fluid is
collected into the LZI Oral Fluid Collector, which consists of a 50 mL Polypropylene Tube.
The LZI Oral Fluid Methamphetamine Enzyme Immunoassay calibrators and controls, sold
as individual bottles, are designated for use at the 50 ng/mL cutoffs. Calibrators contain 0,
20, 50, 100, and 140 ng/mL of methamphetamine in human oral fluid with sodium azide
(0.09%) as preservative. Controls contain levels of 37.5, and 62.5 ng/mL in the same matrix.

EP5-A2: Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices.
L. Test Principle:
The assay is based on competition between drug in the sample and drug labeled with the
enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for a fixed amount of antibody in the
reagent. Enzyme activity decreases upon binding to the antibody, and the drug concentration
in the sample is measured in terms of enzyme activity. In the absence of drug in the sample,
methamphetamine -labeled G6PDH conjugate is bound to antibody, and the enzyme activity
is inhibited. On the other hand, when free drug is present in the sample, antibody would bind
to free drug and the unbound Methamphetamine -labeled G6PDH exhibits its maximal
enzyme activity. Active enzyme converts nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to
NADH, resulting in an absorbance change that can be measured spectrophotometrically at
340 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the qualitative and semi-quantitative assays was evaluated on the Hitachi
717 analyzer. A primary stock solution of d- methamphetamine (1000 ng/mL) was
spiked into negative synthetic oral fluid matrix to obtain the target concentrations
shown below. Samples were tested in replicates of 2, twice a day for 22 days (total
n=88). A summary of the results for each cut-off values for qualitative and semi-
quantitative modes are shown below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity and % recovery across the range was tested by spiking a commercially
available methamphetamine standard into negative synthetic oral fluid. The high
concentration was diluted to reach the final concentrations (expected values) listed
below. Each sample was run in 10 replicates on the Hitachi 717 clinical analyzer in
semi-quantitative mode with a calibration curve established with the 5 Oral Fluid
Methamphetamine calibrators (0, 25, 50, 100, 140 ng/mL). The average results were
compared to the expected results and percent recovery was calculated.

preparation was performed using balances calibrated with NIST traceable weights.
Value Assignment
A secondary stock solution of 10 µg/mL (made from the commercially available
standard noted above) was spiked into the synthetic negative oral fluid to the desired
concentration for calibrators and controls. The resulting concentrations were
confirmed by GC/MS.
Stability
Real time studies have been conducted over 17 months for calibrators and controls
stored at 2-8 ºC. Samples stored at 2-8 ºC over 17 months were compared to samples
measured on Day 1. Protocols and acceptance criteria in the 510(k) were reviewed
and found to be acceptable. Data in the 510(k) support the sponsor’s claimed 17
months expiration dating for open vial and 18 months for closed vial stability at 2 ºC
to 8 ºC.
Shipping/Recovery Study
A shipping study was performed to demonstrate the recovery of drug from oral fluid
when collected in the LZI Oral Fluid Collector collection tube (provided for
confirmation testing) by testing expected transport conditions. Conditions simulating
transport to 3 different destinations with varied weather conditions (-20 ºC, 2-8ºC,
room temperature and 30ºC) were performed. Four sets of pooled negative oral fluid
samples (25 mL each) were spiked with d-methamphetamine to 50%, 75%, 125% and
150% of the cutoff concentration. These samples served as pre-shipping controls for
analyte recovery (Day 1). The samples at each concentration were then pipetted (4.5
mL) into individual LZI Oral Fluid Collectors and kept at one of the 4 storage
temperatures over 3 days. After 72 hours, all 16 samples were brought to room
temperature and tested with LZI Oral Fluid Methamphetamine Enzyme
Immunoassay. A total of 20 samples were evaluated, consisting of 16 post-shipping
and 4 pre-shipping controls. The samples consisting of 4 concentrations stored at 4
temperature conditions on the 4th day when compared to samples (Day 1), showed
recoveries ranging from 90.2% to 108.1% for all cut-off concentrations tested.
Percent recoveries (based on GCMS measurements) under various shipping
conditions are shown in the table below:

Sample Storage and Stability:
Real time and accelerated stability studies have been conducted for sample storage for
various conditions (frozen, room temperature, refrigerated and 30 ºC). Real time
stability studies are ongoing. Protocols and acceptance criteria were described and
found to be acceptable. The manufacturer claims that d-methamphetamine (MAMP)
saliva samples may be stored in the LZI Oral Fluid Collectors (polypropylene
collection tubes) up to two weeks when stored at 2-8 °C, or up to 24 months when
stored at -20 °C.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
The potential effect of endogenous and exogenous interferents was tested by spiking
the interferents into negative oral fluid to the desired concentrations (shown below).
A portion of the oral fluid containing the interferents was then spiked with a
concentration of 37.5 ng/mL d-methamphetamine (-25% cut-off) or 62.5% ng/mL d-
methamphetamine (+25% cut-off). No interference was observed. The substances
