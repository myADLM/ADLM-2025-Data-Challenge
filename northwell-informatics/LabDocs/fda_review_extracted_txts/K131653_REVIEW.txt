H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The LZI Oral Fluid Amphetamine Enzyme Immunoassay is intended for the qualitative
and semi-quantitative determination of d-amphetamine in neat human oral fluid, collected
into the LZI Oral Fluid Collector at the cutoff value of 50 ng/mL. The assay is designed
for prescription use with a number of automated clinical chemistry analyzers.
The semi-quantitative mode is for purposes of (1) enabling laboratories to determine an
appropriate dilution of the specimen for confirmation by a confirmatory method such as
GCMS and LCMS or (2) permitting laboratories to establish quality control procedures.
The LZI Oral Fluid Amphetamine Calibrators are for use as calibrators in the qualitative
and semi-quantitative calibration of the LZI Oral Fluid Amphetamine Enzyme
Immunoassay at the cutoff value of 50 ng/mL.
The LZI Oral Fluid Amphetamine Controls are for use as assayed quality control
materials to monitor the precision of the LZI Oral Fluid Amphetamine Enzyme
Immunoassay at the cutoff value of 50 ng/mL.
The assay provides only a preliminary analytical result. A more specific alternative
chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas or
liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS or LC/MS) is the preferred
confirmatory method). Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be
exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary test
result is positive.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
The assay is designed for prescription use with a number of clinical chemistry analyzers.
Performance data was obtained using the Hitachi 717 analyzer.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
EP5-A2: Evaluation of Precision Performance of Clinical Chemistry Devices.
L. Test Principle:
The assay is based on competition between drug in the sample and drug labeled with the
enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for a fixed amount of antibody in the
reagent. Enzyme activity decreases upon binding to the antibody, and the drug concentration
in the sample is measured in terms of enzyme activity. In the absence of drug in the sample,
amphetamine-labeled G6PDH conjugate is bound to antibody, and the enzyme activity is
inhibited. On the other hand, when free drug is present in the sample, antibody would bind to
free drug and the unbound Amphetamine-labeled G6PDH exhibits its maximal enzyme
activity. Active enzyme converts nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH,
resulting in an absorbance change that can be measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision of the qualitative and semi-quantitative assays was evaluated by testing a
single lot of calibrator and control material on the Hitachi 717 analyzer. A primary
stock solution of d-amphetamine (1000 ng/mL) was diluted into negative synthetic
oral fluid matrix to obtain the target concentrations shown below. Samples were
tested in replicates of 2, twice a day for 22 days (total n=88). A summary of the
results for each cut-off values for qualitative and semi-quantitative modes are shown

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity and % recovery across the range was tested by spiking a commercially
available amphetamine standard into negative synthetic oral fluid. The high
concentration was diluted to reach the final concentrations (expected values) listed
below. Each sample was run in 10 replicates on the Hitachi 717 clinical analyzer in
semi-quantitative mode with a calibration curve established with the 5 Oral Fluid
Amphetamine calibrators (0, 25, 50, 100, 140 ng/mL). The average results were
compared to the expected results and percent recovery was calculated.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The starting material for calibrators and controls is a commercially available
amphetamine stock solution of 1000 µg/mL. Purity determination (99% purity) and
and gravimetric preparation was performed using balances calibrated with NIST
traceable weights.
Value Assignment
A secondary stock solution of 10 µg/mL (made from the commercially available
standard noted above) was spiked into the synthetic negative oral fluid to the desired
concentration for calibrators and controls. The resulting concentrations were
confirmed by LC/MS.
Stability
Real time studies have been conducted over 18 months for calibrators and controls
stored at 2-8 ºC. Samples stored at 2-8 ºC over 18 months were compared to samples
measured on Day 1. Protocols and acceptance criteria in the 510(k) were reviewed
and found to be acceptable. Data in the 510(k) support the sponsor’s claimed 18
months expiration dating for both open vial and closed vial stability at 2 ºC to 8 ºC.
Shipping/Recovery Study
A shipping study was performed to demonstrate the recovery of drug from oral fluid
when collected in the LZI Oral Fluid Collector collection tube (provided for
confirmation testing) by testing expected transport conditions. Conditions simulating
transport to 3 different destination sites with varied weather conditions (-20 ºC, 2-
8ºC, room temperature and 30ºC) were performed. Four sets of pooled negative oral
fluid samples (25 mL each) were spiked with d-amphetamine into glass flasks to
50%, 75%, 125% and 150% of the cutoff concentration. These samples served as pre-
shipping controls for analyte recovery (Day 1). The samples at each concentration
were then pipetted (4.5 mL) into individual LZI Oral Fluid Collectors and kept at one
of the 4 storage temperatures over 3 days. After 72 hours, all 16 samples were
brought to room temperature and tested with LZI Oral Fluid Amphetamine Enzyme
Immunoassay. One mL of each of the 16 samples were transferred into amber glass
vials and shipped with gel ice overnight for GC/MS confirmation.
A total of 20 samples were evaluated, consisting of 16 post-shipping and 4 pre-
shipping controls. The samples consisting of 4 concentrations stored at 4 temperature
conditions on the 4th day did not show any degradation when compared to counterpart
samples (Day 1), with sample recoveries ranging from 99.2% to 100.1% for all cut-
off concentrations tested. Sample recoveries compared to GC/MS are show below:

Sample Storage and Stability:
Real time and accelerated stability studies have been conducted for sample storage for
various conditions (frozen, room temperature, refrigerated and 30 ºC). Real time
stability studies are ongoing. Protocols and acceptance criteria were described and
found to be acceptable. The manufacturer claims that d-amphetamine (AMP) saliva
samples may be stored in the LZI Oral Fluid Collectors (polypropylene collection
tubes) up to two weeks when stored at 2-8 °C, or up to 24 months when stored at -20
°C.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Eighty-five unaltered clinical samples collected in the LZI Oral Fluid Collector were
tested using the LZI Oral Fluid Amphetamine Enzyme Immunoassay on the Hitachi
717 automated clinical analyzers and confirmed withLC/MS for d-amphetamine
concentration. Results obtained in the qualitative mode and semi-quantitative mode
are summarized below:
Qualitative
50 ng/mL Negative < 50% of Near cut-off Near cut-off > 50% %
Cut-off the cut-off (between positive above the Agreement
50% below (concentration cut-off
the cut-off between 50%
and the cut- above the cut-
off) off and the
cut-off)
Positive 0 0 0 10 32 97.7%
Negative 22 11 9 1* 0 100.0%
Semi-Quantitative
50 ng/mL Negative < 50% of Near cut-off Near cut-off > 50% %
Cut-off the cut-off (between positive above the Agreement
50% below (concentration cut-off
the cut-off between 50%
and the cut- above the cut-
off) off and the
cut-off)
Positive 0 0 0 10 32 97.7%
Negative 22 11 9 1* 0 100.0%
*The discordant sample contained 63 ng/mL by the mass spectrometry method and 45.7
ng/mL by LZI Oral Fluid Amphetamine Enzyme Immunoassay on the Hitachi 717.
