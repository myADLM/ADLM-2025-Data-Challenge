I. Device Description:
1. Stat Profile Prime CCS Analyzer
The Stat Profile Prime CCS Analyze is a small, automatic blood gas, metabolite and
electrolyte analyzer. The sensors and flow path have been integrated into one replaceable
micro-sensor card, which is replaced periodically according to usage. Whole blood
specimens are aspirated into the analyzer’s micro-sensor card from syringes, tubes, or
capillary blood collection devices using a peristaltic pump and a sampling probe. The
disposable micro-sensor card contains the analytical flow-path and all of the
3

--- Page 4 ---
measurement sensors (pH, pCO2, pO2, Hct, Na+, K+, Cl-, iCa, and Glu). Once the
analysis measurement is complete, the whole blood specimen is automatically flushed out
of the micro-sensor card flow-path and into a self-contained waste collection bag
contained within the disposable calibrator cartridge.
The Stat Profile Prime CCS Analyzer is microprocessor-based and incorporates:
Traditional electrode technology to measure blood pH, pCO2, pO2; Ion selective
electrode technology to measure blood sodium, potassium, chloride, ionized calcium;
Enzyme/Amperometric technology for glucose measurement; Conductivity method for
Hematocrit. The Stat Profile Prime CCS Analyzer has multiple quality control options.
Both traditional internal and external liquid QC shall be offered, as well as an onboard
Quality Management System (QMS). The Stat Profile Prime CCS Analyzer has two
primary sample modes: syringe and capillary mode. The minimum sample size for both
analysis modes is 100 μL.
2. Stat Profile Prime Auto QC cartridge CCS
This internal auto QC cartridge consists of 3 flexible bags within a cardboard carton.
Each bag contains an aqueous quality control material for monitoring the measurement of
pH, pCO2, pO2, hematocrit (Hct) Na, K, Cl, iCa, and Glucose (Glu). The aqueous quality
control materials are composed of a buffered bicarbonate solution, each with a known pH
and known level of Na, K, Cl, iCa, and Glu. Solutions are equilibrated with known levels
of O2, CO2, and N2. Each bag contains a minimum volume of 100 mL. The aqueous
quality control materials are formulated at three levels:
Control 1: Acidosis, with High Electrolyte, Low Normal Glu
Control 2: Normal pH, Low-Normal Hct, Normal Electrolyte, High Glu
Control 3: Alkalosis, High Hct, Low Electrolyte, High Abnormal Glu

L. Test Principle:
pH is measured using a hydrogen ion selective membrane. One side of the membrane is in
contact with a solution of constant pH. The other side is in contact with a solution of
unknown pH. A change in potential develops which is proportional to the pH difference of
these solutions. This change in potential is measured against a reference electrode of constant
potential.

pCO2 is measured with a modified pH sensor. Carbon dioxide in the unknown solution
makes contact with a hydrogen ion selective membrane CO2 diffuses across the membrane
into a thin layer of bicarbonate buffer in response to partial pressure difference. This solution
then becomes equilibrated with the external gas pressure of the fluid in contact with the outer
surface of the membrane. CO2 in the solution becomes hydrated producing carbonic acid
which results in a change in hydrogen ion activity. The measured potential is related to the
logarithm of PCO2 content of the sample after compensation of the measured potential of the
pH sensor.
pO2 is measured amperometrically by the generation of a current at the sensor surface. As
oxygen diffuses through a gas permeable membrane, the oxygen molecules are reduced at the
cathode, consuming 4 electrons for every molecule of oxygen reduced. This flow of electrons
is then measured by the sensor and is directly proportional to the partial pressure of oxygen.
Hematocrit is defined as the percentage of red blood cells to the total blood volume and can
be obtained by measuring electrical resistance of the blood sample. Two standard solutions
are used to calibrate the hematocrit sensor and to obtain the slope. The analyzer then
measures the electrical resistance of the blood sample to obtain the hematocrit value. The
hematocrit value obtained is corrected for the concentration of the sodium ion.
Glucose measurement is based on the level of H O produced during the enzymatic reaction
2 2
between glucose and oxygen molecules in the presence of the glucose oxidase enzyme. The
current generated by the flow of electrons at the surface of the platinum sensor is
proportional to the glucose concentration of the sample.
Na+, K+, Cl-, iCa are measured by ion selective electrodes. An electrical potential is
developed according the Nernst Equation for a specific ion. When compared to a reference,
this electrical potential is translated into voltage and then in to the ion concentration of the
sample.

Whole Blood Within Run Precision Performance
Estimates of the whole blood within run precision were evaluated in syringe mode
and capillary mode using lithium heparinized whole blood samples. For each run,
tonometered whole blood was analyzed 20 times on 3 Stat Profile Prime Analyzers
for a total of 20 results per analyzer. Statistical analysis for each analyzer for both
syringe mode and capillary mode was calculated. All 3 analyzers yielded similar
results. The results of one representative analyzer are summarized in the table below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed using lithium heparin whole blood samples. For
each parameter, 10 – 14 levels were prepared by tonometering, spiking or
diluting whole blood to span the analytical measurement range for each parameter.
Each blood level was analyzed in triplicate on each of the three Stat Profile Prime
CCS analyzers and on the predicate, the pHOx Ultra analyzers. The pHOx Ultra
analyzers were used to establish the target value of each blood level for each
parameter. Results of linear regression using one representative analyzer are
presented in the below table.

primary pH reference material SRM 2186I and 2186II. Nova’s standards and reagents
are measured versus the NIST primary pH buffers using a pH glass electrode and a
flowing 2M KC1 Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The measurement is done at 37°C.
PCO2/PO2 Gases
Nova’s CO2/O2 gases are gravimetrically prepared and are traceable to NIST SRM
1700a, (PCO2) and 1702a (PCO2 and PO2)
PCO2/PO2 Reagents
Nova’s PCO2/PO2 controls and reagents are measured against Nova’s CO2/O2 gases
traceable to NIST SRMs. The Severinghaus PCO2 electrode is used to measure these
reagents versus the Nova CO2/O2 gases. These reagents are stored either in a glass
ampoule or a gas-impermeable laminated foil pouch.
Na+
The reagents and standards containing sodium ion are derived from analytical reagent
grade sodium chloride. This reagent is then validated using NIST SRM 2201. The
validation is accomplished by using a sodium glass electrode with a 2M KC1 flowing
reference electrode or a Na/K/Li flame photometer.
K+
The reagents and standards containing potassium ion are derived from analytical
reagent grade potassium chloride. This reagent is then validated using NIST SRM
2202. The validation is accomplished by using a valinomycin potassium electrode

Value assignment:
The Stat Profile Prime Calibrator Cartridge CCS (Calibrators)-
Values are assigned by analyzing 12 samples from the test lot and 6 samples from the
reference lot on three calibrated analyzers. Each sample was assayed in triplicate.
The calculated calibrator value=reference lot assigned value+ (test lot mean-reference
lot mean).
The Stat Profile Prime Auto QC Cartridge CCS and Stat Profile Prime Ampuled
Control ABG/CCS (Controls)-
Values are assigned by analyzing 8 samples from the test lot and 8 samples of the
reference lot over 2 days on two calibrated analyzers. Each sample was assayed in
triplicate. The calculated control value=reference lot assigned value+ (test lot mean-
reference lot mean).
d. Detection limit:
Refer to the linearity study data above in M. 2.b. for the measuring range claim of all
analytes. In addition, the sponsor conducted a Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of
Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for iCa, and Glucose according to
the CLSI EP-17A guideline using whole blood samples.
Limit of Blank (LoB) – 100 replicates of zero level samples were measured on
multiple test analyzers.
Limit of Detection (LoD) –Three blood samples with low analyte concentration were
measured in 100 replicates each on multiple test analyzers.
LoD=LoB+1.6494 SD
Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) – was defined according to the following criteria.
iCa: Lowest concentration where the absolute error (bias) is less than 0.10 mmol/L.
Glucose: Lowest concentration where the absolute error (bias) is less than 5.0 mg/dL.

e. Analytical specificity:
Li-heparin whole blood samples were used in the interference study. For the initial
testing, each interferent was spiked at 20 times the recommended concentration by
CLSI EP-7 A2. Each sample containing interferent was evaluated against the same
whole blood sample without the interferent. If interference was observed, a dose
response study was performed at two analytes concentrations (low and high) to
determine the highest substance concentration where no interference was observed.
The sponsor’s definition of significant interference is ±10% bias for pH, pO2, pCO2,
Na, K, Ca, Cl, glucose, and Hct, +/- 0.020 for pH. The following table represents
substances that were tested without demonstrating a significant interference on test

For the calculated hemoglobin: The hemoglobin calculation is an estimation based on
a normal mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration of 33.3% and a nominal male
Hct of 39 to 49% or female Hct of 35 to 45%. Hemoglobin estimations made from
samples with red cell dyscrasia or hemoglobinopathies may vary significantly from
hemoglobin measured by cyanmethemoglobin method. The estimated hemoglobin
may vary significantly in cases of abnormal blood composition or disease states such
as anemia in which abnormal values may not be reported. These conditions should
warrant repeat testing by conventional laboratory methods
For hematocrit: White Blood Count (WBC) greater than 50,000 WBC/μL may
increase the hematocrit value.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were performed internally. A minimum of 150 whole
blood specimens were analyzed for each parameter in syringe collection devices.
Some samples were altered in order to achieve the hard-to-find sample range. The
samples were analyzed on each of the Stat Profile Prime CCS analyzers and on each
of the pHOx Ultra analyzers. The Stat Profile Prime CCS results for each analyzer
were compared to the average of the 2 results from the pHOx Ultra comparative
method.

Whole blood patient samples were evaluated to demonstrate that syringe sample
mode and capillary sample mode are equivalent. The syringe sample was
analyzed directly using the syringe mode. After the measurement, samples were
transferred from the syringe into the capillary tube and then analyzed using the
capillary mode. Approximately 100 whole blood samples were analyzed for each
parameter. The capillary test result was compared to the syringe test result and
linear regression analysis was performed. Results are summarized in the table
