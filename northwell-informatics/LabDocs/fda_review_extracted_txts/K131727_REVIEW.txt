L. Test Principle:
The test is based on the measurement of electrical current generated by the reaction of glucose
with the reagent of the test strip. The test meter measures the current and displays the
corresponding blood glucose levels. The strength of the current produced by the reaction
depends on the amount of glucose in the blood sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run precision was evaluated by analyzing venous whole blood samples spiked to
five different glucose concentrations. The hematocrit of all samples was between 35 and
50%. Five different lot numbers of test strips and ten meters were used in the study and
each of the samples was measured ten times per lot of test strip per meter for a total of 100
measurements per glucose concentration. The samples were analyzed by one operator in
one day.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The CERA-CHEK 1070 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to the YSI 2300
Glucose analyzer which is calibrated using the YSI 2747 Glucose Standard (a NIST traceable
glucose standard).
Control Solution Value Assignment:
Two levels of aqueous control solutions (level1 and 2) are available for use with the CERA-
CHEK 1070 Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Ten replicates of each level of Control
Solution were tested one each on four glucose meters. The 40 data points were compiled and
the mean was used as the target concentration. Value assignment ranges were established at
±20% around the target concentration. The target mean and ranges for each control solution
are provided on the test strip vial label.
Stability:
Test strip shelf-life stability (closed vial) was assessed in an accelerated study with real time
studies ongoing. The protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable. The testing supported the claimed shelf life of 24 months when stored at 1-32°C
and 10-85% relative humidity (RH).
Test strip in-use stability (open vial) was assessed in real time studies. The protocols and
acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The testing supported the open
vial stability of 4 months when stored at 1-32°C and 10-85% RH.
Control shelf-life stability (closed vial) was assessed in real-time studies. The protocols and
acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The testing supported the
claimed shelf life of 12 months when stored at 1-32° C.
Control in-use stability (open vial) was assessed in real-time studies. The protocols and
acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The testing supported the open
vial stability of 4 months when stored at 1-32° C.
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the device is 20 - 600 mg/dL. This range was validated by the
linearity study (M.1.b).
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor performed interference studies in accordance with CLSI EP7-A. Testing was
performed in parallel (control samples vs. test samples) to minimize the effects of glucose
metabolism. Whole blood was drawn into K - EDTA anticoagulant tubes from healthy
3
volunteers who were not on any medications. The glucose levels tested were 64, 151, and
257 mg/dL. The highest level was achieved by spiking. A low and high concentration of each
potential interferent was then tested at each glucose level. The following substances were
found not to interfere at the concentrations listed below:
Substance No interference up to:
Acetaminophen 6 mg/dL
Ascorbic acid 4 mg/dL
Dopamine 5 mg/dL

to the test strip.
5. Calibration:
Each vial of strips contains a Code Key which is used to code the meter before use.
6. Quality Control:
Controls are not included in the starter kit, but the labeling explains how users can obtain two
levels of controls. The labeling also provides recommendations on when to test control
materials. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. If
the control values fall outside these ranges, the user is instructed to repeat the control test. If
the user continues to get out of range results, they are instructed not to use the system and to
contact technical service.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit study: The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated using venous whole
blood samples with hematocrit levels across the claimed range and altered to glucose
concentrations from 21 – 529 mg/dL. There were five measurements for each combination of
glucose concentration and hematocrit level (8%, 19%, 28%, 40%, 48%, 61%, 72%). The
results under each possible combination of glucose concentration and hematocrit level were
compared to YSI results and demonstrated that the CERA-CHEK 1070 Blood Glucose
Monitoring System produces accurate results over the claimed hematocrit range of 10 – 70%.
2. Altitude study: A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of altitude on the device. In this
11

--- Page 12 ---
evaluation, venous blood at glucose concentrations of approximately 100, 200, and 300
mg/dL were tested using a decompression chamber to simulate the effects of altitude. Three
lots of test strips and three meters were used. Each blood sample was also tested by the YSI
2300 reference analyzer. The meter readings obtained were compared to the YSI method and
the percent bias was determined at each level against the YSI results. The results
demonstrated that the CERA-CHEK 1070 Blood Glucose Monitoring System produces
accurate results at altitudes up to 13,200 feet.
3. Temperature and Humidity Studies: In this study, three test strip lots were tested on three
meters at three glucose concentrations (approximately 45, 120, and 300 mg/dL) at twelve
combinations of temperature and humidity. Each combination of environmental conditions /
glucose concentration / meter was tested in replicates of three. The temperatures tested
ranged from 10.0° C to 41.2° C. The relative humidity tested ranged from 10.3% - 86.6%.
Glucose concentrations were verified by the YSI reference method. The bias relative to the
reference method was acceptable to support the claim that temperatures from 10 – 40° C (50
– 104° F) and relative humidity from 10 – 85% do not significantly affect the glucose results.
4. Infection Control Studies: The Ceragem Medisys CERA-CHEK 1070 Blood Glucose
Monitoring System is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies were
performed with the chosen disinfectant, CaviWipes (EPA Registration Number 46781-8) by
an outside commercial testing facility, which demonstrated complete inactivation of hepatitis
B virus (HBV). Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that
there was no change in performance or external materials for the meter after 1825 cleanings
and 1825 disinfection steps with CaviWipes. The robustness studies were designed to
simulate 5 years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for
the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
5. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) and Electrical Safety Testing: Adequate electrical
safety and EMC testing was conducted and acceptable certification provided.
6. Readability Assessment: The sponsor performed a reading level assessment of the labeling.
The Flesch-Kincaid results were as follows:
User manual: Grade level 7.2
Test strip insert: Grade level 6.7
Control solution insert: Grade level 7.6
7. Device Usability Study: A usability study was performed to assess the readability of the
labeling by recruiting untrained lay users who were provided with the test kit and labeling.
These lay users also completed a questionnaire regarding the clarity of the instructions and
the ease of use of the device. The responses indicated that the instructions were
understandable and adequate to successfully operate the device.
8. Data Management Software Usability Study: The sponsor also performed a human factors
study with 30 lay users to evaluate the CERA-CHEK Diabetes Management Software (which
included installing the transmission software and transferring the data from the meters to a
PC), and concluded that the CERA-CHEK Diabetes Management Software demonstrated
acceptable usability and data transmission accuracy.
9. Data Storage and Memory Roll-over Study: To assess the storage of the CERA-CHEK 1070
device and the memory data rollover function, 1020 data records were input into CERA-
CHEK 1070 device. The integrity of the stored data was confirmed with an accuracy of
12

--- Page 13 ---
100% by comparing the 1000 data records on meter to the data transferred to computer via
CERA-CHEK Diabetes Management Software. The study also demonstrated that the new
data will replace the existing data order after the memory is full.
10. The sponsor provided the results of the device software testing including a hazard analysis,
traceability analysis, validation and verification testing, and release level history which were
reviewed and found to be adequate.
