H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Quidel® Molecular Influenza A+B assay is a multiplex Real Time RT-PCR assay
for the in vitro qualitative detection and differentiation of influenza A and influenza B
viral RNA in nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs from patients with signs and symptoms of
respiratory infection. This test is intended for use as an aid in the differential diagnosis of
influenza A and influenza B viral infections in humans in conjunction with clinical and
epidemiological risk factors. The assay does not detect the presence of influenza C virus.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the
sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other patient management decisions.
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established during the 2011 and 2013
influenza seasons when influenza A/H3 and 2009 H1N1 influenza were the predominant
influenza A viruses in circulation. When other influenza A viruses are emerging,
performance characteristics may vary.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent
influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture
should not be attempted in these cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and
culture specimens.
The assay can be performed using either the Life Technologies QuantStudio™ Dx, the
Applied Biosystems® 7500 Fast Dx (ABI 7500), or the Cepheid SmartCycler® II.

I. Device Description:
The Quidel Molecular Influenza A+B Assay detects viral nucleic acids that have been
extracted from a patient sample using the NucliSENS® easyMAG® automated extraction
platform. The extraction of the nucleic acids is performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Quidel). The Quidel Molecular Influenza A + B Assay contains specific primers
and probes for influenza A and influenza B virus and for the Process Control (PRC). The
PRC is an inactivated and stabilized MS2 bacteriophage containing an RNA genome and is
added to each sample aliquot prior to extraction. The PRC controls for the assay procedure,
reverse transcriptase and polymerase activity, and for the presence of inhibitors in the sample
that may interfere with the assay.
The Master Mix (MM) is provided in a lyophilized state and must be rehydrated prior to
testing. The MM contains oligonucleotide primers, fluorophore and quencher-labeled probes
targeting highly conserved regions of the influenza A and influenza B viruses as well as the
PRC sequence. The primers are complementary to highly specific and conserved regions in
the genome of these viruses. The probes are dual labeled with a reporter dye attached to the
5’-end and a quencher attached to the 3’-end. The assay uses the following reporter dyes.

Target Quencher Dye

Influenza A FAM None
Influenza B VIC None
Process Control CY5 None
The amplification and detection is performed on the Life Technologies QuantStudio® Dx Real
Time PCR Instrument using 96-well PCR plates. A multiplex real-time RT-PCR reaction is
carried out under optimized conditions in a single tube generating amplicons for each of the
target viruses present in the sample. The Quidel Molecular Influenza A+B assay is based on
TaqMan® chemistry, and uses an enzyme with reverse transcriptase, DNA polymerase, and 5’-3’
exonuclease activities. The user pipettes 15 µL of the rehydrated MM and 5 µL of extracted

nucleic acids (containing the PRC). Once the plate is inserted into the instrument, the assay
protocol is initiated. During DNA amplification, an enzyme cleaves the probe bound to the
complementary DNA sequence, separating the quencher dye from the reporter dye. This step
generates an increase in fluorescent signal upon excitation by a light source of the appropriate
wavelength. With each cycle, additional dye molecules are separated from their quenchers
resulting in additional signal. If sufficient fluorescence is achieved a Ct (threshold cycle) value is
reported for a given target and the sample is considered positive for the detected target sequence.

L. Test Principle:
Detection of the viral targets and the Process Control (PRC) is based on three processes:
nucleic acid isolation, reverse transcription, and real time PCR amplification/detection.
Human respiratory specimens (nasal swabs and nasopharyngeal swabs) from symptomatic
patients are processed initially to isolate and purify viral nucleic acid from the cellular
specimen matrix. Identification of influenza A occurs by the use of target specific primers
and a fluorescent-labeled probe that hybridizes to a conserved influenza A sequence within
the matrix protein gene. Identification of influenza B occurs by the use of target specific
primers and fluorescent-labeled probes that will hybridize to a conserved influenza B
sequence within the neuraminidase gene. The real-time PCR process simultaneously
amplifies and detects nucleic acid targets in a single closed-tube reaction.
After initial reverse transcription of RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA), amplification
procedes during which the probe anneals specifically to a region of the template between the
forward and reverse primers. As primer extension and amplification occurs, the exonuclease
activity of the Taq polymerase cleaves the probe separating the reporter dye away from the
quencher. This generates an increase in fluorescent signal upon excitation from a light source
of appropriate wavelength. With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved
from their respective probes, yielding increased fluorescence signal. The amount of
fluorescence at any given cycle is dependent on the amount of PCR product (amplicons)
present at that time. Fluorescent intensity is monitored at each PCR cycle by fluorescent
detection modules within the real-time PCR instrument.

Reproducibility Study
The reproducibility of the Quidel Molecular Influenza A+B assay was evaluated at three
laboratory sites. Reproducibility was assessed using a panel of eight simulated samples which
included 2 positive samples (above LoD), a high negative (0.3x LoD) sample, and a negative
(non-spiked) sample for each virus, influenza A (A/Mexico/4108/2009) and influenza B
(B/Florida/04/2006). The panel also included daily quality controls. Panels and controls were
tested at each site by two operators for five days, each sample tested in 3 replicates, for a total of
90 results per level for each virus (2 operators x 5 days x 3 sites x 3 replicates). Each panel and
controls were extracted using the bioMérieux easyMAG system and tested on the Life
Technologies QuantStudio Dx platform.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Reagent Stability
Reagent real time stability at 2°C - 8°C was conducted with three lots of the Quidel
Molecular Influenza A+B Assay kits. The data collected supports two years of
reagent shelf life stability when stored at 2°C - 8°C.
Master Mix Stability after Rehydration
An evaluation of master mix stability after rehydration was carried out over a five day
period using various storage conditions, including -20°C, 4°C, and 25°C (room
temperature). Mock specimens at 100X, 10X, and 3X LoD were used in the analysis.
The data was reviewed under K112171. The data showed that the rehydrated master
mix can be stored for up to 24-hours at room temperature (20° to 25°C) or at ≤ -20°C
for up to two weeks.
Extracted Specimen Stability
An evaluation of the stability of extracted specimens was carried out using the
easyMAG extraction system followed by real-time RT-PCR analysis. Parallel aliquots
of samples that were influenza A (3X LoD) and influenza B (3X LoD) positive were
used for this study. Samples were analyzed at time 0 (immediately after extraction),
after 2h at room temperature, after 8h at 2-8°C, after 96 hours with up to three freeze
thaw cycles, and after one month at -20°C. The data was reviewed under
K112171.The data showed that extracted nucleic acids may be stored at room

d. Detection limit:
A Limit of Detection for the Quidel Molecular Influenza A+B assay when used on
the QuantStudio Dx instrument was established for three (3) strains of Influenza A
and three (3) strains of Influenza B. A stock was prepared for each set of viruses in
negative nasal matrix that contained both influenza A and influenza B at a
concentration approximately 10 X LoD (based on previous results on the 7500 Fast
Dx platform, see K112172). Each stock was diluted to 3X LoD, 1X LoD and 0.3X
LoD. Additional concentrations were prepared as needed. Each dilution was split into
20 aliquots, where each aliquot was extracted separately using the NucliSENS
easyMAG (bioMérieux) instrument. The LoD was defined as the lowest
concentration at which ≥ 95% of all replicates tested positive.
The final LoD for the Quidel Molecular Influenza A+B when used on the
QuantStudio Dx instrument for each influenza strain tested is shown below.

e. Analytical Reactivity
The analytical reactivity of the Quidel Influenza A+B assay with various strains of
influenza A and influenza B viruses was evaluated on the previously cleared Applied
Biosystems® 7500 Fast Dx platform, K112172); the data was reviewed at that time.
Since the LoDs of the two instrument platforms are considered to be similar, these studies
were not repeated for this submission.
The analytical reactivity, as evaluated on the Applied Biosystems® 7500 Fast Dx
platform (each organism was extracted using the NucliSENS easyMAG (bioMérieux)
instrument and tested in triplicate), is shown below.

Additional analytical reactivity studies were performed with two new influenza A
variants, H3N2v and H7N9, which emerged between 2012 and 2013.
a. Six isolates of the H3N2v strain were obtained from CDC. The viruses were
cultured and titered by Quidel. Each virus was diluted in transport media to reach
a TCID range of 4E+01 to 6E+01, based on the limit of detection TCID value
50 50
of the H3N2 strain evaluated for this submission. Each sample was extracted
using the NucliSENS easyMAG instrument and tested in triplicate on two
instrument platforms, the Life Technologies QuantStudio Dx and the Applied
Biosystems® 7500 Fast Dx. All six isolates of the influenza A H3N2v virus were
detected by the Quidel Molecular Influenza A+B assay using both instruments, at
the concentrations shown below.

b. To determine the reactivity of the Quidel Molecular Influenza A + B assay with
the Avian Influenza A H7N9 virus, an inactivated virus was obtained from CDC.
The virus was titered by the CDC using Egg Infective Dose (EID) methodology,
50
and was subsequently inactivated with β-propiolactone (BPL). The virus was
serially diluted (10 fold) in universal transport media (UTM) to reach a TCID
50
range of 1E+02 to 1E+03. Each dilution was tested in replicates of 10 to estimate
the lowest concentration that provided ≥95% detection. Further, two fold dilutions
were performed, ranging from 8.00E+01 EID /mL to 8.00E+06 EID /mL to
50 50
determine the LoD. Each dilution was extracted using the NucliSENS easyMAG

Interference
The effect of potentially interfering substances that may be present in nasopharyngeal
specimens on the Quidel Molecular Influenza A+B assay was evaluated on the
previously cleared Applied Biosystems® 7500 Fast Dx platform, K112172); the data
was reviewed at that time. Since the LoDs of the two instrument platforms are
considered to be similar, these studies were not repeated for this submission. The
interference studies conducted at that time utilized influenza A
(A/Mexico/4108/2009) and influenza B (B/Florida/04/2006) strains at concentrations
of 3x LoD on the ABI 7500 platform. No interference was observed when tested in
the presence of the following substances at the concentrations shown.

Cross-reactivity
The potential for cross-reactivity of the Quidel Molecular Influenza A+B assay with
microorganisms commonly found in respiratory passages or those causing other
respiratory tract infections were evaluated on the previously cleared Applied
Biosystems® 7500 Fast Dx platform, K112172); the data was reviewed at that time.
Since the LoDs of the two instrument platforms are considered to be similar, these
studies were not repeated for this submission. The cross-reactivity studies performed
at that time included 24 bacteria, 26 viruses and one yeast strain. Bacteria and yeast
were tested at concentrations between 105 and 1010 CFU/mL. Viruses were tested at
concentrations between 103 to 106 TCID /mL. Samples were extracted using the
50
NucliSENS easyMAG instrument and tested in triplicate with the Quidel Molecular
Influenza A+B assay on the ABI 7500 platform. No cross-reactivity with the
organisms tested was observed. The results of that study are presented below.

g. Assay cut-off:
The assay cutoff was established to optimize the sensitivity of the assay without
compromising the specificity for either influenza A or influenza B detection. The
threshold “cutoff value” represents the fluorescent intensity signal (reported in Relative
Fluorescent Units) at which a “positive” reaction reaches a relative fluorescent intensity
above the background or baseline of a “negative” reaction. If a sample exceeds the
threshold in a detection channel during PCR, the sample is considered positive for that
channel. If the sample does not exceed the threshold for a detection channel by the last
PCR cycle, the sample is considered negative for that channel. Multiple positive and
negative clinical specimens as well as contrived specimens were used to establish
instrument baseline and threshold settings. A total of 14 influenza A positive specimens
and 12 influenza B positive specimens were evaluated for their Ct ranges to determine the
appropriate cutoff for the assay. Based on the data, a cutoff at Ct 40 was chosen.
The distribution of the Ct values for positive clinical samples in this study is shown
below.
The assay cutoff was validated in the clinical study.

h. Carryover Contamination
A study was performed to evaluate a potential for carryover cross-contamination with
viral RNA when testing positive specimens with a high viral content using the Quidel
Molecular Influenza A + B assay during extraction on the bioMérieux easyMAG
followed by amplification on the QuantStudio Dx platform. The following influenza
strains were re-grown and stocks were prepared at the given starting concentration.
Strain TCID Titer
50
A/California/07/2009 2.11E+07
B/Florida/04/2006 1.67E+07
The study was performed with two dilutions that were prepared in negative nasal
matrix that contained both Influenza A and Influenza B at a high positive
concentration (TCID 2.11E+05 and 1.67E+05, respectively) and high negative
50
concentration (TCID 2.11E-01 and 1.67E-01, respectively). Viral RNA was
50
extracted and purified using the easyMAG instrument according to the Quidel
Molecular Influenza A + B instructions for use. The study was conducted over five
days with a separate plate prepared for each of the influenza A and B strains. Each
day of testing, 24 Positive and 24 Negative replicates were extracted and purified.
The extracted samples were aliquoted into the wells of a PCR plate, alternating
positive and negative samples for a total of 48 positive and 48 negative samples on
each plate. There was no carryover or cross-contamination observed for this assay
when using the QuantStudi Dx platform. The summary of results is presented below.

3. Clinical studies:
The Quidel Molecular Influenza A and B assay was evaluated in a clinical study using
nasal swabs (NS) and nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens. The study utilized fresh,
non-frozen specimens prospectively collected between November 2012 and March 2013
from individuals with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection. The samples
were collected and tested at three geographically diverse clinical sites. The performance
of the assay was compared to the test results obtained with a commercially available
high-performing, FDA-cleared, Influenza A and B molecular test.
Specimens were collected from 631 patients. Each specimen was extracted with the
bioMérieux easyMAG and tested with Quidel Molecular Influenza A + B Assay using the
Life Technologies QuantStudio Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument. Each specimen was also
tested by the comparator method. Twelve specimens were removed from analysis due to
invalid results (four specimens were invalid on initial and repeat testing with the Quidel
device (0.63%, 95% CI: 0.25-1.62) and eight specimens were invalid on initial and repeat
testing on the comparator device (1.27%, 95% CI: 0.64-2.48%). Among the 619 subjects
with evaluable results, 204 (33.0%) were positive for influenza A and 107 (17.3%) were
positive for influenza B. Among the 311 subjects infected with influenza (50.2% of all
subjects tested), 11 tested positive for both influenza A and influenza B (3.5%).
Performance characteristics for influenza A were established when influenza A/H3 and
influenza A 2009 H1N1 were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation. When
other influenza A viruses are emerging, performance characteristics may vary.
The following table summarizes the gender and age distribution of all patients enrolled in
the evaluation.

N. Instrument Name:
QuantStudio™ Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument System
O. System Descriptions:
The QuantStudio™ Dx instrument is a bench top Real-Time PCR instrument that uses
fluorescent-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reagents to provide qualitative or
quantitative detection of target nucleic acid sequences (targets) using real-time analysis from
a 96-well (or 384-well) plate. Samples are prepared for nucleic acid testing manually using
specific reagents indicated by the assay.
1. Modes of Operation:
The QuantStudio™ Dx Real-Time PCR instrument has two modes of operation: IVD and
Research Use Only (RUO), which cannot be executed simultaneously. The protocols that
are performed on each instrument for IVD assays depend upon the assay-specific, closed-
mode application specifications that are installed on the system.
2. Software:
The embedded software on the QuantStudio™ Dx manages instrument operations and
enables the user to monitor instrument status. The QuantStudio™ Dx instrument software
is installed on a separate computer and communicates with the instrument to control the
instrument and collect data. The QuantStudio™ Dx instrument software performs data
analysis and outputs analyzed results.
The diagnostic test parameters for the Quidel Molecular Influenza A+B assay are
predefined by Quidel in a Test Definition Document (TDD) that is imported into the
QuantStudio™ Dx instrument software. The TDD file is locked and the parameters
cannot be changed by the user.
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
