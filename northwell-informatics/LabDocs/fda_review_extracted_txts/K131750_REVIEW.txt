L. Test Principle:
The meters and test strips use biosensor technology. The test strips contain glucose oxidase
(Aspergillis niger) that reacts to glucose present in blood, releasing electrons. The meter
applies a small electrical current to the test strip and measures changes in the current caused
by the reaction of glucose in the blood sample to the enzyme in the test strip. The meter
converts the measured current into a blood glucose reading that is displayed on the meter’s
liquid crystal display.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity for the device was evaluated using CLSI-EP6 using venous whole blood
supplemented with glucose, or allowed to undergo glycolysis, to provide samples at 8
glucose concentrations of 18, 60, 81, 124, 211, 325, 438 and 618 mg/dL. Forty tests
were performed using AutoSure HT meters at each glucose concentration and a
glucose test using the same blood sample was performed on the YSI 2300 Glucose
Analyzer as the reference method. A total of 320 samples were tested on each test
strip lot for a total of 960 tests. Regression analysis demonstrated a linear relationship
between the AutoSure HT glucose meter and the YSI 2300 reference method. The
linear regression results for each test strip lot are shown below:
Strip Lot Slope Intercept R2
1 0.9996 -0.1472 0.9996
2 1.0004 -0.3014 0.9993
3 1.0002 -0.2169 0.9993
The study provided supports the claimed measurement range for glucose of 20 - 600
mg/dL. If a sample is less than 20 mg/dL, the result is flagged by the meter as LO. If
a sample result exceeds 600 mg/dL, the result is flagged by the meter as HI.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The AutoSure HT Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to NIST SRM 917c
glucose. A NIST SRM 917c traceable Glucose Standard Set (JCCRM 521-10) with
glucose concentrations of 50,100, 150, 250, 500 mg/dL, is used to calibrate the
reference instrument YSI 2300 Glucose Analyzer.
Expected Values:
Value assignment of glucose control solutions was performed by testing 3 lots of
AutoSure HT control solutions (for all 3 levels) using 2 AutoSure HT meters daily for
7

10 days, with 2 tests/meter for each control solution, for a total of 360 test results.
Results were verified against values taken on the YSI-2300 reference method and pre-
determined acceptance criteria for glucose recovery within a specified range must
have been met for each control lot/level. The acceptable control range is established
as the mean value ±15 mg/dL for Level 1 control solution or ±15% for Levels 2 & 3
control solutions. Glucose control ranges are lot dependent and are listed on the test
strip vial label for each lot and level.
Test Strip Stability:
Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria for the AutoSure HT test strips were
reviewed and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer claims a shelf life stability of
18 months and an open-vial stability of 6 months at the recommended storage
temperatures of 4°C to 30°C. Relative humidity should be between 20-85% for open
and closed vial test strip stability.
Control Solution Stability:
Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria for the glucose control solutions
were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer claims a shelf life
stability of 24 months and an open-vial stability of 3 months at the recommended
storage temperatures of 4°C to 30°C.
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the AutoSure HT glucose meter is 20-600 mg/dL. This range
was verified by the linearity study (see section M.1.b of this decision summary).
e. Analytical specificity:
To evaluate potential interference, a number of endogenous/exogenous substances at
two or more levels (normal/therapeutic and high) were added to venous whole blood
samples (HCT 43±2%) containing three different glucose levels (70-90, 110-130, and
300-330 mg/dL). Ten glucose measurements obtained from samples containing each
potential interfering substance were evaluated and compared against measurements
with a control group using the AutoSure HT glucose monitoring system. Test and
control samples were tested using 10 AutoSure HT test strips and 10 AutoSure HT
glucose meters. The table below shows the levels at which no significant interference
(defined by the sponsor as ≤ 10%) was detected when testing for glucose with the
AutoSure HT glucose meter:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
System Accuracy Study:
To demonstrate system accuracy, fingertip, palm and forearm samples were obtained
from 143 participants. For the fingertip samples, 8 samples were allowed to glycolize
to achieve low glucose concentrations below 50 mg/dL and 2 samples were spiked to
obtain values >450 mg/dL to cover the glucose range of 37-472 mg/dL. Thus, 153
fresh capillary blood fingertip samples and 143 palm and forearm samples (glucose
concentration of 56-435 mg/dL) were tested by health care professionals for the
study. The study was performed using 8 AutoSure HT glucose meters and 3 lots of
AutoSure HT test strips. The glucose meter measurements obtained using the
AutoSure blood glucose meter were compared to YSI 2300 reference method values
for fingerstick, palm and forearm samples. The accuracy data is summarized in tables
below.

5. Calibration:
This system has an autocoding feature; coding of the meter by the user is not necessary.
The meter is plasma calibrated.
6. Quality Control:
Three levels of controls are available for use with this meter. The control solutions must
be purchased separately using the contact information provided in the user guide. When a
test strip is inserted into the meter, each control level can be measured by following the
instructions for “Control Solution Testing” provided in the meter user guide. An
acceptable range for each control level is printed on each test strip vial label. The user is
instructed to contact Customer Service if the control results fall outside of these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Hematocrit Study: The effect of different hematocrit levels on the performance of the
AutoSure HT Blood Glucose meter was evaluated using venous whole blood samples with
hematocrit levels of 10, 20, 30, 35, 43, 50, 55, 60 and 70%, at glucose concentrations of 40,
60, 130, 300 and 500 mg/dL using 10 meters and 3 test strip lots. For each blood sample,
individual glucose readings taken on the AutoSure HT meter were compared to YSI
reference values to calculate the bias. The results demonstrate acceptable bias for hematocrit
levels between 10-70%.
1. Altitude study: To assess the effect of altitude, venous whole blood samples were
adjusted to 5 glucose concentrations: 50, 120, 222, 330 and 448 mg/dL (30-55%
hematocrit; 23°± -2°C) and tested at sea level and 10,335 feet above sea level using 10
meters and 1 test strip lot. Three levels of control solutions were also tested for the study.
Results were compared to YSI reference values. The results demonstrate acceptable bias
to YSI to support the claims in the labeling that altitudes up to 10,335 feet have no
significant effect on blood glucose measurements from the AutoSure HT glucose meter.
2. Temperature and Humidity Study: The effect of temperature and relative humidity (RH)
on the AutoSure HT meter was evaluated using venous blood samples at 60, 120, 200 and
400 mg/dL. Twenty replicates were tested at each combination of temperature and
relative humidity using 10 AutoSure HT meters and 3 lots of test strips. Glucose
concentrations at the following temperature and humidity conditions were evaluated and
compared with results obtained with the YSI reference method:
Temperature: 4, 10, 14, 20, 24, 30, 40, 45 (±2°C) at 45-55% RH
Relative Humidity: 20% ± 5% at 4°C and 45°C; 50% ± 5% at 24°C;
90% ± 5% at 4°C and 45°C
The study results support the operating temperature range of 41 - 113°F (5 - 45°C) and
20– 90% RH.
3. Sample Volume Study: The sponsor performed a study to verify the test strip minimum
17

--- Page 17 ---
sample volume requirement (0.9 µL) and the test strip fill error requirement established
for the AutoSure HT. Venous whole blood samples at 3 levels (50-70 mg/dL, 100-140
mg/dL and 310-350 dL) were tested at 8 sample volumes (0.7-1.4 µL tested in 1 µL
increments) using 10 meters and 1 test strip lot. Values obtained were compared to YSI
reference values. The Sponsor concludes that sample volumes ≥ 9 µL produced accurate
results 100% of the time, thus this is the minimum sample volume that should be used
with the meter. Adequate software validation was performed for this feature.
4. Readability Evaluation: Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the
results demonstrated that the User Manual, test strip package insert, and control solution
package inserts were written at the 8th grade level.
5. Electromagnetic Compatibility: The Sponsor provided documentation certifying that
electromagnetic testing (EMC) had been performed. Testing was found to be adequate for
the AutoSure HT meter.
6. Infection Control Studies: The device is intended for single-patient use. Clorox
Healthcare Bleach Germicidal wipes (EPA registration # 67619-12-5813) were validated
through disinfection efficacy studies by an outside commercial testing laboratory
demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) using materials
comprising the meter. Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor
demonstrating that there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the
meter after 1,825 cleaning and disinfection cycles designed to simulate 5 years of single-
patient device use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated
cleaning and disinfection procedures.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
