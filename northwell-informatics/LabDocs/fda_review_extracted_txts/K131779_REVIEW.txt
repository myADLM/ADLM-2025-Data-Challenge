3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
· Prescription Use only
· The ability of the VITEK 2 AST-ST card to detect resistance to Tigecycline in
Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates), S. anginosus, S.
intermedius, S. constellatus, S. agalactiae and S. pyogenes is unknown because
resistant strains were not available at the time of comparative testing.
4. Special instrument requirements:

I. Device Description:
Each VITEK® 2 test card contains 64 micro-wells. A control well containing only
microbiological culture media is resident on all cards. The remaining wells contain
premeasured portions of a specific antibiotic combined with culture media. The bacterial or
yeast isolate to be tested is diluted to a standardized concentration with 0.45 – 0.5% saline
before being used to rehydrate the antimicrobial medium within the card. The VITEK 2
System automatically fills, seals and places the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2
Compact has a manual filling, sealing and loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor
the growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time. At the completion of the
incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive
category result for each antibiotic contained on the card.
The VITEK® 2 AST-ST Tigecycline has the following concentrations in the card: 0.125,
0.25, and 0.5 µg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in µg/mL). The
Tigecycline MIC result range for the VITEK®2 card is ≤0.06 to ≥ 1μg/mL.

Information Supplement”, January 2011
L. Test Principle:
Automated growth based detection using attenuation of light measured by an optical scanner.
The optics used in the systems use visible light to directly measure organism growth.
Transmittance optics is based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth
has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same well measure organism
growth by how much light is prevented from going through the well. The VITEK 2 System
monitors the growth of each well in the card over a defined period of time. An interpretive
call is made between 4 and 16 hours for a “rapid” read but may be extended to 18 hours in
some instances. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains
the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each antibiotic on the card.

The VITEK® 2 AST-ST Tigecycline has the following concentrations in the card: 0.125,
0.25, and 0.5 µg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in µg/mL). The
Tigecycline MIC result range for the VITEK®2 card is ≤0.06 to ≥ 1μg/mL.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was demonstrated using 10 isolates at three sites on three separate
days in triplicates. As this is a qualitative test, results were evaluated for
reproducibility based on Category Agreement only. Results were >95% reproducible.
Of the ten isolates tested, five had on-scale MIC values.
The study included the Auto-dilution and the Manual dilution with the VITEK 2, and
the Manual dilution with the VITEK 2 Compact.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The recommended QC isolates were tested on every test occasion with the reference
method and the VITEK 2. The reference method QC results were in range for every
day tested. The VITEK 2 was tested a sufficient number of times to demonstrate that
the system can produce QC results in the recommended range.
Quality Control was performed during the studies using both the auto-dilution and the
manual method of diluting the organisms. Results demonstrated that methods were
comparable with the same mode.

2. Comparison studies:
The reference method follows the CLSI approved broth microdilution testing
conditions for Tigecycline:
· Medium: Mueller-Hinton broth supplemented with lysed blood. The broth was
prepared fresh and immediately frozen. For use, it was inoculated no longer than
one hour for thawing at room temperature.
· Inoculum: Direct colony suspension
· Incubation : 35°C, ambient air, 20- 24 hours
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
There are less than five discrete dilutions in the VITEK 2 AST-ST Tigecycline card.
Therefore, essential agreement (EA) was not established.
A total of 722 clinical and 161challenge organisms were tested at four sites. Six
clinical isolates failed to grow in the VITEK 2 card, giving a no growth rate of 0.83%
(6/722). There were 202 stock isolates (28.0%, 202/722). The total number of viable
clinical isolates was 716. There were a total of 877 results for evaluation. The
performance data were analyzed using FDA interpretative criteria. A summary of the

CA-Category Agreement vmj-very major discrepancies
R-resistant isolates min- minor discrepancies
Category agreement (CA) is when the VITEK® 2 panel result interpretation agrees exactly with
the broth microdilution reference panel result interpretation.
S. agalactiae
There were two major discrepancies (Susceptible by reference, non-susceptible by
VITEK) for S. agalactiae, with an acceptable rate of 0.7% (2/276) when analyzed for
this organism separately.
The challenge set of 161 isolates was also tested against a manual dilution method on
the VITEK 2. The performance of the VITEK 2 Compact was evaluated as a
secondary procedural option. The evaluation was conducted using the same 161
challenge isolates. A summary of VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact manual dilution
data is shown in the table below.
