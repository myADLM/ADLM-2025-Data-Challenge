L. Test Principle:
Patient samples are diluted 1:40 in PBS-Tween, 30 µL of each diluted patient sample are
added to each reaction field of the reagent tray. Reactions are started by fitting the BIOCHIP
Slides containing the sections from the substrate (HEp-20-10 cells) into the corresponding
recesses of the reagent tray and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Specific
antibodies attach to the HEp-20-10 antigens. After incubation the BIOCHIP Slides are
washed with PBS-Tween to remove unbound antibodies. In the meantime, 25 µL of
fluorescein–labelled anti–human globulin are added to each reaction field of a clean reagent
tray and the BIOCHIP Slides placed into the recesses of the tray. After 30 minutes
incubation at room temperature, the BIOCHIPs are again washed with PBS-Tween to remove
any unbound fluorescein-labelled reagent. 10 µL of Embedding medium are placed for each
reaction field on a cover glass and the BIOCHIP Slides, with the BIOCHIPs facing
downwards, placed onto the prepared cover glass. Fluorescence is read with a fluorescence
microscope.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
The fluorescence intensity level is the intensity of the specific fluorescence expressed as
a numeric value. These values can vary from “0” (no specific fluorescence) to “4+”
(strong specific fluorescence). The evaluation of the fluorescence intensity is performed
according to the following table:

Intensity Interpretation
0 Negative: no specific fluorescence
1+ Positive: Weak visible reaction; dim subdued fluorescence
2+ Positive: Moderate visible reaction; green fluorescence
3+ Positive: Strong visible reaction; brilliant green fluorescence
4+ High Positive: Very strong visible reaction; brilliant green
Interpretation of test results: A serum dilution is considered negative for ANA antibodies
if the cells exhibit < 1+ fluorescence and no discernible pattern. Cells appear reddish-
orange due to the Evans Blue counterstain. Likewise, a serum dilution is considered
positive for ANA antibodies if the cells exhibit ≥ 1+ fluorescence and a discernible
pattern. A sample is considered positive for ANA antibodies if it exhibits exhibit ≥ 1+
fluorescence and a discernible pattern at a sample dilution of 1:40 or greater.
Technicians should report all titers and patterns seen.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility was investigated using a panel of serum samples representing the
range of patterns at different intensities. Samples were manually diluted in two-fold
steps from a starting dilution of 1:40.
Intra-Assay Reproducibility: Twenty-nine (29) samples with different patterns and
titers were each tested 10 times according to the package insert and evaluated by the
same technician. None of the readings between replicates differed by more than ± 1
fluorescence level; positive samples were not found negative (and vice versa) and the
observed patterns did not change.
Inter-Assay Reproducibility: Twenty-nine (29) samples with different patterns and
titers were each tested by 20 measurements obtained on 5 different days with 2 runs
per day and 2 replicates (total 20 replicates) according to the package insert and
evaluated by the same technician. None of the readings between replicates differed
by more than ± 1 fluorescence level; positive samples were not found negative (and
vice versa) and the observed patterns did not change.
Inter-Lot Reproducibility: Twenty-nine (29) samples with different patterns and
titers were each tested by 6 measurements obtained by testing each sample in
duplicate on three separate lots in three runs, 1 run per lot (total 6 replicates). The
EUROIMMUN IFA 40: HEp-20-10 assays were processed according to the package
insert and evaluated by the same technician. The results of the different lots did not
exceed the fluorescence intensity of ± 1 intensity level, positive samples were not
found negative and vice versa, and the observed patterns did not change.
Inter-Observer Reproducibility was determined by a separate independent reading
of the Inter- Assay slides by a second technician for all 29 samples. The results of the
different assays did not exceed the acceptable deviation of fluorescence intensity of
± 1 intensity level, positive samples were not found negative and vice versa, and the
observed patterns did not change. The Inter-Observer Reproducibility Study was
performed in a US laboratory setting.
Semi-quantitative Reproducibility: Fourteen (14) positive samples and one
negative sample were serially diluted from 1:40 to 1:10,240 then tested in duplicate in
4

four separate runs and read by two different observers (total 16 replicates). Three
different lots were used in the experiment. Each of the seven main patterns
(homogeneous, granular, nucleolar, centromeres, nuclear dots, nuclear membrane and
cytoplasmic) were represented by a lower titer (1:80 – 1: 320) positive sample and a
higher titer (1:1,280 – 1:10,240) positive sample. Fluorescence intensities ranged
from 1+ to 4+. The results of the different assays for each dilution did not exceed the
fluorescence intensity of ± 1 intensity level, so the endpoint titer did not deviate more
than ± 1 titer level, and the observed patterns did not change.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Six samples with different combinations of mixed staining patterns were serially
diluted and tested with the EUROIMMUN IFA 40: HEp-20-10 assay. The samples
were assayed according to the package insert. Each sample/dilution combination was
tested and the fluorescence intensity and pattern were recorded.
Mixed patterns could be distinguished in every dilution, and the samples showed a
decrease in fluorescence intensity as the samples were diluted. The pattern of the
samples did not change with dilution. Acceptable deviation of fluorescence intensity:
± 1 intensity level.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: A recognized standard or reference material for Anti-Nuclear
Antibodies is not available.
Controls: Negative and positive controls are included in the kit. The negative control
should exhibit less than 1+ or no specific fluorescence (autoantibody negative). The
positive control should exhibit a homogenous staining pattern with a fluorescence
intensity of >1+ (3 to 4+). The homogenous pattern of the positive control was
confirmed via testing. EUROIMMUN Inc. recommends using the positive and
negative controls as stated within the labeling (Instructions for Use).
Stability: Ongoing real-time stability tests of the kit are being conducted in
accordance with DIN EN 13640:2002: Stability testing of in vitro diagnostics
reagents. Three production lots of all kit reagents are tested. Current testing supports
a stability claim of 12 months when stored at +2°C – +8°C.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity: The specificity of the EUROIMMUN IFA 40: HEp-20-10 was
verified using the ANA reference panel of the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, Atlanta, USA). The CDC samples were assayed according to the package
insert by the same technician at the same day. The results are in line with the
characterization by the CDC with the exception of CDC sample No. 12. This sample
was also tested using the EUROIMMUN ANA IFA: HEp-20-10 (K070763) and the
ImmunoConcepts® ºHEp-2000 ANA-Ro IFA (K972145). The sample was found
negative with all three test systems.

In addition to the CDC panel, clinical samples positive for ANCA-associated
vasculitis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease and infectious diseases
(Chlamydia pneumoniae and Epstein-Barr virus) each 10 samples were investigated.
The results do not indicate any cross reactivity.
Interfering substances: The effect of interfering substances on assay results were
tested by spiking 20 clinical samples with hemoglobin (0, 250 & 500 mg/dL),
bilirubin (0, 10 & 40 mg/dL) and triglycerides (0, 500 & 2000 mg/dL). The samples
consisted of negative (< 1:40), weak positive and strong positive samples with
varying pattern specificities. Interferences from human anti-mouse antibodies
(HAMA) and rheumatoid factor (RF) was tested by diluting these samples 1:1 with
high positive HAMA serum or a high positive RF serum respectively. The spiked
samples were incubated with the EUROIMMUN IFA 40: HEp-20-10 according to the
package insert by the same technician on the same day. The deviation in fluorescence
intensity level did not exceed ± 1. The results indicated that hemoglobin (up to 1000
mg/dL), bilirubin (up to 40 mg/dL), triglyceride (up to 2000 mg/dL), HAMA and RF
at the concentrations indicated have no effect on assay results. No interference was
observed.
f. Assay cut-off:
The recommended starting dilution, above which the result is reported as positive and
below which the result is reported as negative, is 1:40. The manufacturer suggests
performing four-fold dilutions but recommends that each laboratory establish its own
titering protocol. The titers of 1:40 and 1:80 are considered low titers, 1:160 and
1:320 are considered medium titers, and 1:640 and greater are considered high titers.
Assay cut-off of 1:40 was determined from the literature (Range of antinuclear
antibodies in “healthy” individuals, Arthritis & Rheumatism 40, 1997; Guidelines for
Clinical Use of the Antinuclear Antibody Test and Tests for Specific Autoantibodies to
Nuclear Antigens, Arch Pathol Lab Med. 124, 2000).
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Qualitative: A comparison study of patient samples sent for routine ANA testing at
an academic research center was performed using a cohort of 200 blinded prospective
samples where age and sex information were available. The samples were tested

5. Expected values/Reference range:
A panel of 200 sera from normal healthy adult blood donors of mixed age and gender
(155 men, 45 women, mean age 38 years, age range 18-68 years) was tested with the
EUROIMMUN IFA 40: HEp-20-10 kit to establish of the assay. The samples were
assayed according to the package insert on the same day by three technicians.
Prevalence, defined as titers of >1:40, was found about 3.5%. As per the American
College of Rheumatology a “prevalence of ANAs in healthy individuals is about 3.0 –
15.0%”.
In a separate study, 138 samples with age and sex data available sent for ANA antibody
testing were collected in sequential order for two days. The panel consisted of samples
from 53 men and 85 women submitted for a routine health screening. Age ranged from 0
to 89 years with an average age of 51 years. Testing, at initial dilution of 1:40, was
performed. Sixteen (16) of the 138 samples were positive for anti-nuclear antibodies
using the EUROIMMUN IFA 40: HEp-20-10 kit, resulting in a prevalence of 11.6%
(95% C.I.: 6.8% – 18.6%). Clinical diagnosis was not available.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
