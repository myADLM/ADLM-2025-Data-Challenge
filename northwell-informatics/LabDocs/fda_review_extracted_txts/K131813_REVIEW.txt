510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
K131813
B. Purpose for Submission:
The purpose of this submission is to show that the Quidel® Molecular RSV + hMPV Assay is
substantially equivalent to the Prodesse ProFlu™ Assay and Pro hMPV+ Assay when used on
the Life Technologies QuantStudio™ Dx Instrument.
C. Measurand:
This assay detects the presence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human
metapneumovirus (hMPV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) using reverse transcription real-time
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The RT-PCR primers are developed to bind to
conserved regions of the L viral polymerase and NS2 genes for RSV and RNA polymerase
gene for hMPV.
D. Type of Test:
This is a nucleic acid based test using RT-PCR. The negative sense strands of the RSV and
hMPV genomes are reverse transcribed and then amplified. The presence of RSV or hMPV
RNA is then detected through sequence-specific labeled probe that is cleaved during PCR
amplification releasing the fluorescent reporter dye from the quencher dye.
E. Applicant:
Quidel Corporation
F. Proprietary and Established Names:
Quidel Molecular RSV + hMPV Assay
G. Regulatory Information:

2. Classification:
Class II
3. Product code:
OEM, OCC
4. Panel:
Microbiology (83)
H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Quidel Molecular RSV + hMPV Assay is a multiplex Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR) assay
for the qualitative detection and identification of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and
human metapneumovirus (hMPV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) extracted from nasal and
nasopharyngeal swab specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory
infection. This in vitro diagnostic test is intended to aid in the differential diagnosis of RSV
and hMPV infections in humans in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk
factors. This test is not intended to differentiate the two subtypes of RSV or the four genetic
sub-lineages of hMPV.
Negative results do not preclude RSV infection and/or hMPV infection and should not be
used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment or other patient management decisions.
Conversely, positive results do not rule-out bacterial infection or co-infection with other
viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease. The use of additional
laboratory testing and clinical presentation must be considered in order to obtain the final
diagnosis of respiratory viral infection.
The Quidel Molecular RSV + hMPV Assay can be performed using either the Life
Technologies QuantStudio™ Dx RT-PCR Instrument, the Applied Biosystems® 7500 Fast Dx
RT-PCR Instrument, or the Cepheid SmartCycler® II System.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as intended use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription only.

and the Cepheid SmartCycler II System (software version 3.0b)
I. Device Description:
The Quidel Molecular RSV +hMPV Assay detects viral nucleic acids that have been
extracted from a patient sample using the NucliSENS easyMAG automated extraction
platform. A multiplex RT-PCR reaction is carried out under optimized conditions in a single
tube generating amplicons for each of the target viruses present in the sample. This reaction
is performed utilizing either the Cepheid SmartCycler II, the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast
Dx, or the Life Technologies QuantStudio Dx. Identification of RSV and hMPV and the
Process Control (PRC) occurs by the use of target-specific primers and fluorescent-labeled
probes that hybridize to conserved regions in the genomes of RSV and hMPV and the PRC.
Results are analyzed by the Cepheid SmartCycler II, Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx RT-
PCR, or QuantStudio Dx proprietary software (version 3.0b, 1.4,1.0, or higher, respectively)
and then reported to the user.

L. Test Principle:
This is a nucleic acid based test using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-
PCR). Viral infection is detected through the use of PCR to amplify and detect viral RNA.
The negative sense RNA genomes of RSV and hMPV are reverse-transcribed and then
amplified during the RT-PCR reaction. The presence of RSV or hMPV RNA is then detected
through a sequence-specific labeled probe that is cleaved during PCR amplification releasing
the fluorescence reporter dye from the quencher dye.

Reproducibility
Reproducibility studies were performed on contrived samples extracted using the
bioMérieux easy MAG system and tested on the Life Technologies QuantStudio Dx
platform. Reproducibility was assessed at three separate sites (two external, one in-house)
where two users at each site tested each virus sample in triplicate over five days. The
hMPV-A2 or RSV A viruses were tested at high negative (0.3X LoD for RSV A and
0.15X LoD for hMPV-A2), low positive/close to the limit of detection (2X LoD), and
medium positive (5X LoD) concentrations. The viruses were diluted in a pooled negative
nasal matrix. The RSV and hMPV negative samples (RSV Negative and hMPV
Negative) consisted of RSV and hMPV negative nasal matrix. Negative and positive
controls included in the study were from the Quidel Molecular RSV + hMPV Control
Set.

The data demonstrates good reproducibility as it shows 100% detection of hMPV and
99% detection of RSV at low positive/close to the detection limit (2X LoD) and 100%
detection of hMPV and RSV at medium positive levels (5X LoD). Detection was lower
than 50% for the high negative samples, which is expected and therefore acceptable for
real-time PCR tests.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The package insert for this assay includes a reference to an optional unassayed control set
(the Quidel Molecular RSV +hMPV Control Set, #M107).
Fresh vs. Frozen Study
This data was reviewed and determined to be satisfactory in K122189. The results of the
study are described briefly below:
A viral panel was created and tested before freezing and then after storage frozen at -
70°C for 22-56 days. Data collected from these samples showed that storage for up to 56
days did not impact the ability of the Quidel Molecular RSV + hMPV Assay to detect
either RSV or hMPV RNA near the cut-off. In a similar study, clinical samples were
tested within 72 hours of collection and once again after seven days at -70°C. These
samples did not show any significant change in Ct values over time when stored at -70°C.
Master Mix Stability after Rehydration
This data was reviewed and determined to be satisfactory in K122189. The results of the
study are described briefly below:
An evaluation of master mix stability after rehydration was carried out over a five-day
period. The data showed that the rehydrated master mix was stable at room temperature
and at 2-8°C for 48 hours and for five days at -20°C.
Extracted Specimen Stability
This data was reviewed and determined to be satisfactory in K122189. The results of the
study are described briefly below:
An evaluation of the stability of extracted specimens was carried out using the
bioMérieux NucliSENS® easyMAG® System. Studies showed that extracted hMPV and
RSV RNA was stable for six hours at 2-8°C, four hours at room temperature, one month
at -20°C, and after 96 hours at -20°C with up to three freeze/thaw cycles.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Detection (LoD)
The LoD was determined using four genetic sub-lineages for hMPV and two subtypes for
RSV. Each virus sub-lineage/subtype was diluted and each dilution was extracted and run
20 times using the Life Technologies QuantStudio Dx. The LoD was determined to be the
lowest titer at which the virus was detected greater than 95% of the time. Virus was
diluted in a pooled negative nasal matrix. The positive controls were from the Quidel
9

Molecular RSV + hMPV Control Set. The negative control was negative nasal matrix
(RSV and hMPV negative).

The data demonstrates that the LoD values for the Quidel Molecular RSV + hMPV Assay
on the new instrument (QuantStudio Dx) is within 3X of the LoD values determined for
the assay on the previously cleared instrument (ABI 7500 Fast Dx) in K122189.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference (Other Microorganisms)
This data was reviewed and determined to be satisfactory in K122189. The results of the
study are described briefly below:
This study was conducted to evaluate the potential for interference when other common
respiratory pathogens are present in a RSV or hMPV low positive sample at high
concentrations. The study found that there was no interference seen. All samples positive
for RSV or hMPV tested positive in the presence of other respiratory pathogens.
Cross-Reactivity
This data was reviewed and determined to be satisfactory in K122189. The results of the
study are described briefly below:
This study was conducted to evaluate the potential for cross-reactivity when other
microorganisms (viruses, bacteria, yeast) are present in a sample at a high concentration.
All samples negative for RSV or hMPV tested negative, indicating that there was no
cross-reactivity seen between any of the organisms tested.
Competitive Interference (RSV vs. hMPV)
The competitive interference study was conducted to assess if a high concentration of one
virus could affect detection of another virus present at low levels in the same sample.
Samples containing both RSV A and hMPV B2 were tested with the Quidel Molecular
RSV + hMPV Assay on the QuantStudio Dx. The low concentration virus was created by
spiking either RSV or hMPV into negative nasopharyngeal swab matrix at 2X the LoD.
The high concentration virus was spiked into the low level specimen. These

concentrations ranged from 10X LoD to 100,000X LoD. Any test sample in which
detection of RSV or hMPV was not observed was considered inhibitory. Virus was
diluted in a pooled negative nasal matrix. The positive controls were from the Quidel
Molecular RSV + hMPV Control Set. The negative control was negative nasal matrix
(RSV and hMPV negative).

Results indicate that, at 10,000X LoD, the presence of RSV can affect detection of hMPV
near the cut-off (2X LoD) and at 10,000X LoD, the presence of hMPV can affect
detection of RSV near the cut-off (2X LoD). Additionally, at, 1,000X LoD, the presence
of hMPV may affect detection of RSV near the cut-off (2X LoD) as indicated by a shift
in Ct >5.0 compared to the control. This has been addressed as a limitation in the product
labeling.
Carry-Over
The carry-over study was designed to uncover the presence of contamination in negative
specimens due to carry-over of virus during nucleic acid extraction and PCR
amplification. The study was designed by alternately placing high positive (2.57 x 106
TCID /mL RSV B and 3.16 x 107 TCID /mLhMPV A1, each diluted in negative
50 50
nasopharyngeal matrix) and negative specimens in each well of the PCR plate. A total of
48 high positives and 48 negatives were tested in each run, with a total of five runs, each
run on a separate day (48 x 5 = 240 samples total for each group in the study). Virus was
diluted in a pooled negative nasal matrix. The negative control was negative nasal matrix
(RSV and hMPV negative).

f. Assay cut-off:
Baseline
Initial baseline assessment was conducted using contrived samples from the
reproducibility study panel. Testing indicated that the use of the auto baseline resulted in
the detection of false positives for RSV in the negative specimens (negative nasal
matrix), so the baseline was changed to a manual baseline (starting at Ct 3.0 and ending
at Ct 15.0). This resolved the false positive RSV detection and had no effect on detection
of hMPV or the PRC. Clinical specimens were tested to confirm that the change to a
manual baseline reduced RSV false positives but did not affect RSV true positives. The
data from this study is included below.

Threshold
Threshold analysis was conducted using contrived samples from the reproducibility study
panel. Initial testing indicated that the use of the threshold settings previously established
on the ABI 7500 Fast Dx platform (K122189) resulted in the detection of RSV false
positives in the negative specimens (negative nasal matrix). The threshold for RSV was
adjusted from 8.00 x 104 to 2.50 x 105 TCID /mL and clinical specimens were tested to
50
confirm that the change did not affect RSV true positives. The results of this study are
included below.

Analysis of contrived and clinical specimens indicated that there was no need to change
the auto threshold settings for the hMPV and PRC targets from the original settings
previously established on the ABI 7500 Fast Dx platform (K122189).
Ct Cut-Off
A Ct cut-off study was conducted prior to the initiation of the clinical study. The clinical
specimens used for this study were archival specimens from the original submission
(K122189). A total of 63 RSV positive and 37 hMPV positive specimens were evaluated
for their Ct value range to determine the appropriate cut-off for the assay. For RSV 62/63
positives were detected at values less than 30.0 Ct. For hMPV, 34/37 positives were
detected at values less than 35.0 Ct.
The Ct cut-off was set at 40.0 cycles because this value will not decrease sensitivity for
detection of positive clinical specimens.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison was based on the results from the Quidel Molecular RSV + hMPV
Assay on the Life Technologies QuantStudio Dx compared to the results obtained form
two FDA-cleared molecular tests (one test for RSV and a different test for hMPV). The
testing description and data are listed in the Clinical Studies section (below).

b. Matrix comparison:
This data was reviewed and determined to be satisfactory in K122189. The results of the
study are described briefly below:
A transport media study was conducted to show compatibility of five different types of
transport media: UTM, M4, M4-RT, M5, and M6 to the Quidel Molecular RSV + hMPV
Assay. RSV and hMPV were spiked into the media, extracted, and detected using the
Quidel Molecular RSV + hMPV Assay. No differences between the tested transport
media were observed.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity
The clinical study for this device was performed during the 2013 respiratory virus season
(January-March 2013). One specimen per patient was collected at three US study sites.
All 713 nasal or nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected prospectively from
patient samples with a physician’s order to perform testing for respiratory viruses.
Samples were extracted within 72 hours using the bioMerieux NucliSENS easyMag
extraction technology and then stored at -70°C until the time of testing. Performance on
the QuantStudio Dx instrument was compared to performance of two FDA-cleared
assays: a molecular assay for RSV and a molecular assay for hMPV. Sites 1 and 2
performed their own comparator testing. Aliquots of each specimen from site 3 were sent
to site 1 for testing with the comparator devices.
There was an appropriate distribution of subjects from all ages and both sexes.

Seven hundred and thirteen (713) nasal or nasopharyngeal swab specimen extracts were
tested by both the Quidel assay and comparator device for RSV viral RNA. A total of 13
invalid specimens were removed from the analysis. Two of these specimens were invalid
on initial and repeat testing with the subject device (0.3%). Eleven specimens were
invalid on initial and repeat testing on the comparator device (1.5%). The table below
details the results for the remaining 700 specimens.

N. Instrument Name:
QuantStudio Dx Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR) Instrument
O. System Descriptions:
The QuantStudio Dx RT-PCR Instrument is a bench top real-time PCR instrument that uses
fluorescent-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reagents to provide qualitative or
quantitative detection of target nucleic acid sequences (targets) using real-time analysis from
a 96-well (or 384-well) plate. Samples are prepared for nucleic acid testing manually using
specific reagents indicated by the assay.
1. Modes of Operation:
The QuantStudio Dx RT-PCR Instrument has two modes of operation: IVD and Research
Use Only (RUO), which cannot be executed simultaneously. The protocols that are
performed on each instrument for IVD assays depend upon the assay-specific, closed-
mode application specifications that are installed on the system.
2. Software:
The software embedded on the QuantStudio Dx RT-PCR Instrument manages instrument
operations and enables the user to monitor instrument status. The QuantStudio Dx RT-
PCR Instrument software is installed on a separate computer and communicates with the
instrument to control the instrument and collect data. The QuantStudio Dx RT-PCR
Instrument software performs data analysis and outputs analyzed results.
The diagnostic test parameters for the Quidel Molecular RSV + hMPV Assay are
predefined by Quidel in a Test Definition Document (TDD) that is imported into the
QuantStudio Dx RT-PCR Instrument software. The TDD file is locked and the
parameters cannot be changed by the user.
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
