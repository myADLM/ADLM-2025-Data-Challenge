L. Test Principle:
The EliA™ Cardiolipin IgA Wells are coated with bovine cardiolipin. If present in the
patient's specimen, antibodies bind to their specific antigen. After washing away non-bound
antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgA antibodies (EliA IgA Conjugate)
are added to form an antibody-conjugate complex. After incubation, non-bound conjugate is
washed away and the bound complex is incubated with a Development Solution. After
stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the reaction mixture is measured. The higher the
value of fluorescent signal detected by the instrument, the higher the amount of antibody
bound and detected in the sample tested. To evaluate test results, the response for patient
samples is compared directly to the response for calibrators.
The total IgA calibration is based on a set of six WHO-standardized IgA Calibrators derived from
human serum. The IgA Calibrators are used to establish the initial calibration curve, which may
be used for up to 28 days on additional assays and can be stored by the instrument. Each
additional assay includes calibrator (curve) controls that have to recover in defined ranges to

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Eight serum samples selected from different parts of the claimed assay ranges were
tested on Phadia® 100 and Phadia® 250 instruments to establish intra- and inter-run
precision. Lot-to-lot repeatability was assessed with six samples on the Phadia 250. Each
sample was run in 4 replicates on 3 instruments over 7 days. One batch was used to
determine the precision of the assays on Phadia® 100 (equal to 84 replicate
determinations per sample). Three batches were used to determine the precision of the
assays on Phadia® 250 (equal to 252 replicate determinations per sample). Results

The claimed reportable range (detection limit, upper limit) for EliA™ Cardiolipin IgA
is from 0.3 to ≥181 APL-U/mL. Depending on the lot specific EliA™ well factor, the
upper limit of the measuring range may vary from 181 APL-U/mL to 271.2 APL-
U/mL for different solid phase batches. Results above the upper limit of the
measuring range are reported as “above”. No recommendations are made for dilution
of samples outside the measuring range in the package insert. For very low signals,
where the Response Units (RU) of the sample are less than the RU of Calibrator 0, the
Error message “Low RU” will appear on the printout to indicate possible instrument
failure.
High dose hook effect: A hook effect was not observed when analyzing a high positive serum
sample with an estimated concentration 15 times above the upper limit of the measuring range.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i) Traceability:
Calibrators: There is no international standard for IgA antibodies directed to cardiolipin.
The instrument measures specific IgA concentration in μg/L which is automatically
converted to APL-U/mL by using a conversion factor given by the lot-specific bar code
printed on the EliA™ Cardiolipin IgA Well.
The IgA calibrators are traceable (via unbroken chain of calibrations) to the International
Reference Preparation (IRP) 67/86 of Human Serum Immunoglobulins A, G and M from
the World Health Organization (WHO). Calibrators are compared to a secondary standard
(standardized with the IRP) or the IRP directly and adjusted accordingly to meet the correct
concentration.
Controls: The EliA™ Positive APS Control was prepared from human monoclonal
antibodies and contains IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies to cardiolipin and ß2-Glycoprotein
I. This Control was cleared under k091845. The EliA™ IgG/IgM/IgA Negative Control
was prepared from normal human serum. This Control was cleared under k072393.
The IgA target ranges for the EliA™ Controls for the two platforms are summarized
below:
Instrument EliA™ Positive APS Control
Phadia 100 33.2 – 86.2 APL-U/mL
Phadia 250 33.4 – 86.5 APL-U/mL
EliA™ IgG/IgM/IgA Negative Control
Phadia 100 ≤ 11.2 APL-U/mL
Phadia 250 ≤ 11.2 APL-U/mL
The EliA IgA system reagents were cleared under k063775.
ii) Kit Stability:
Closed and open stability - An accelerated stability study initially determined the shelf-life of

the EliA™ Cardiolipin IgA Well was 24 months. A real-time stability study t supported
the 24 months stability claim. All studies were performed on three batches of EliA™
Cardiolipin IgA Well. Other required components (previously reviewed) of the assay
method have a shelf life of 18 to 24 months. The sponsor notes that it is important to store
the wells in dry conditions at 2-8°C.
On-board stability - The on-board stability of the EliA™ Cardiolipin IgA Wells packed in
carriers were tested for 2, 4 and 6 weeks at 10 ºC and 80% humidity in duplicates in one
run using 3 positive and 2 negative samples only on the Phadia 250 instrument since for
Phadia 100 instrument the reagents are stored outside the instrument and are only loaded
as needed for an assay. A separate stability study was performed under maximum
misusage conditions in which EliA Cardiolipin IgA Wells were stored at 32ºC ± 20% and
80% ± 20% humidity to support the room temperature on-board stability claim. As
reference, IgA Wells packed in carriers were sealed in desiccant-containing foil bag and
stored at 2-8ºC in parallel. The on-board stability for the EliA™ Cardiolipin IgA Wells
was determined to be 28 days at 2-8ºC or 24 hours at room temperature.
iii) Sample Storage:
The sponsor recommends following the guidelines in CLSI H18-A3 for sample storage.
Separated serum/plasma should remain at room temperature for no longer than eight hours.
If assays will not be completed within eight hours, serum/plasma should be refrigerated (2 to
8°C). If assays are not completed within 48 hours, or the separated serum/plasma will be
stored beyond 48 hours, serum/plasma should be frozen at or below -20°C. Freezing and
thawing should be avoided.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity was determined in accordance with CLSI EP17-A. The limit of
blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) studies were estimated parametrically by measuring
the concentration of one negative and five low antibody samples in 12 replicates in each of
six runs on six different days on both Phadia 100 and Phadia 250 instruments.
Determinations on the Phadia 250 were divided between three instruments with two runs
performed on each instrument. Determinations on the Phadia 100 were performed on one
instrument. The results are summarized in the table below:
EliA™ Cardiolipin IgA LoB LoD
Phadia 100 0.18 APL-U/mL 0.27 APL-U/mL
Phadia 250 0.15 APL-U/mL 0.20 APL-U/mL
The LoB and LoD were set to 0.18 APL-U/mL and 0.27 APL-U/mL, respectively, for both
Phadia instruments.
e. Analytical specificity:
i) Endogenous Interference:
Interferences were assessed by testing five serum samples: one negative (<14 APL-

U/mL), two within the equivocal range (18 and 20 APL-U/mL), a low positive (34 APL-
U/mL) and a high positive (>120 APL-U/mL). Each sample was spiked with the
interfering substances or substance-specific blanks and analyzed using one lot of EliA™
Cardiolipin IgA Well and one lot of system reagents in two runs, each in three replicates
(n=6). The data demonstrated that EliA Cardiolipin IgA was not adversely affected by
high levels of the following substances tested up to the concentrations listed in the table
below:
Potential Interfering Compound Concentration
Bilirubin F 20.6 mg/dL
Bilirubin C 21.1 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 519 mg/dL
Lipemic factor (ClinOleic) 1 g/dL (1%)
Rheumatoid factor 500 IU/mL
The use of sera containing lipemic, hemolyzed or microbial contaminations is not
recommended as stated in the package insert.
f. Assay cut-off:
Based on the results of the expected values/reference range study described below in Section
M.5, the 99th percentile lies below the upper limit of the equivocal range for EliA™ Cardiolipin
IgA. The assay cutoffs were set as follows:
<14 APL-U/mL Negative
14 - 20 APL-U/mL Equivocal
>20 APL-U/mL Positive
In case of equivocal results, it is recommended to retest the patient after 4-6 weeks. Good
laboratory practice requires that each laboratory establishes its own range of expected values.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 381 serum samples from patients with Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS, n= 212),
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE, n = 66), viral infections (n = 30), connective tissue
diseases (n = 15), rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n = 15), non-viral infections (n = 20), syphilis (n
= 20) or asymptomatic (n = 3) were assayed once on both Quanta Lite ACA IgA III and
EliA™ Cardiolipin IgA. Of the APS samples, 10 were classified as Primary APS (PAPS)
and 30 as Secondary APS (SAPS); the remaining APS samples (172) were not classified.
Seven samples (1 PAPS, 2 SAPS and 4 non-classified APS) with values outside the
measuring range were excluded. The results are summarized below:

b. Matrix comparison:
A study was performed to demonstrate that heparin plasma, citrate plasma and EDTA plasma
matrices yield comparable values as serum in the EliA™ Cardiolipin IgA assay. A total of
62 matrix-matched samples spread across the assay range were assayed on Phadia 100.
Passing & Bablok regression analysis was performed using the values of the serum samples as
the comparator and the results are summarized below:

c. Instrument comparison:
A study was performed to demonstrate that the performance of EliA™ Cardiolipin
IgA was equivalent on the Instrument Phadia 100 and Phadia 250. A total of 36
samples (32 positive and 4 negative) spanning the assay range were analyzed on 3
different instruments in 6 runs (2 runs on each instrument) in single replicate.
Regression analysis yielded a slope of 1.04 (95%CI 1.01 to 1.07) and a y-intercept of -
1.54 (95%CI: -2.39 to -0.153).

APS not classified as PAPS or SAPS 20.3% (14.6 - 27.1 %)
Total APS 28.8% (22.8- 35.4 %)
b. Other clinical supportive data (when a. is not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Same as assay cut-off
5. Expected values/Reference range:
A total of 400 apparently healthy blood donor samples from a Caucasian population
equally distributed by gender and age were measured on the Phadia 250 instrument. The
results are summarized below:
APL-U/mL
Mean 3.6
Median 2.8
Range 0.3 – 48.9
95th percentile 7.1
99th percentile 17.1
The proportion of sera from apparently healthy, asymptomatic individuals found positive
by the EliA™ Cardiolipin IgA is 1%, increasing with age, and men tend to show higher
values. One percent (1%) of the samples fell in the equivocal range. Expected values may
vary depending on the population tested.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a substantial
equivalence decision.
