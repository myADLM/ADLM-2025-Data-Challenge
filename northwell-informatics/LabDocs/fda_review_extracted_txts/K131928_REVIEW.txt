L. Test Principle:
The FREND™ TSH test cartridge is a rapid quantitative “sandwich” immunoassay utilizing
fluorescent nanoparticles in microfluidic flow to capture and quantify TSH in serum and
heparinized plasma.
The FREND™ TSH uses single-use transparent plastic cartridges in which all required
reagents are stored within the cartridge itself. The FREND™ System performs all sample and
reagent handling operations automatically within the cartridge once the sample has been
manually loaded to the sample inlet in the cartridge and the cartridge placed into the
FREND™ System.
A 35 μL drop of patient serum or lithium heparin plasma is placed in the FREND™ TSH
cartridge inlet port, where the sample interacts with a proprietary mix of dry-loaded reagents.
One of these reagents includes antibody-conjugated fluorescent nanoparticles, forming
immune complexes with TSH in the patient sample. Capillary action moves the sample to the
detection region, where capture antibodies grab the TSH-nanoparticle. The concentration of
TSH is calculated by the FREND™ System when the ratio of Test/Reference fluorescence in
an unknown is compared to that same ratio for standards of known concentration. Total TSH
concentration in a sample analyzed with the FREND™ TSH on the FREND™ System
correlates directly with the fluorescence intensity - the higher the TSH concentration, the
greater the fluorescence ratio. The TSH result is calculated using information stored on the
lot specific FREND™ TSH Code Chip and then is displayed on the FREND™ System
screen.
There is no calibration needed by the user because each cartridge is coded with the
calibration information generated by the manufacturer.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A high TSH concentration pool (25.5 mIU/L) was diluted with a low TSH
concentration pool (0.017 mIU/L) based on the CLSI EP06-A guideline, resulting in
eleven equally-spaced TSH concentrations samples which spanned the assay’s
measuring range. All samples were run in triplicates using one FREND system. The
observed results were plotted against the expected results and the linear regression
analysis yielded the following regression equation: Y= 0.977 + 0.17, r = 0.999.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The FREND TSH assay is traceable to the WHO standard 81/565. Each lot of
cartridges has a calibrator code chip which is traceable to WHO International Thyroid
Stimulating Hormone, human for Immunoassay, NIBSC code: 81/565. For the end
user, there is no need for calibration as the calibration information is coded in the
individual cartridge.
Stability
Real time stability studies at 2-8°C and room temperature are ongoing. Real time
stability studies were conducted and the shelf life for the FREND™ TSH are good for
at least one year from date of manufacturer if stored refrigerated appropriately as
directed at 2-8°C. Stability study protocol have been provided and found to be
adequate.
d. Detection limit:
The detection limits, (LoB, LoD and LoQ) for the FREND™ TSH were evaluated
based on the CLSI EP17-A protocol. The Limit of Blank (LoB) was evaluated by
analyzing three lots of TSH-free charcoal-stripped serum samples measured over a
period of six days for a total of n=60 observations. The LoD was evaluated by
analyzing three low level TSH human serum samples over a period of three days and
three different lot cartridges to arrive at a total of n=72 measurements. The LoQ was
evaluated by analyzing three low level TSH human serum samples over a period of
three days and three different lot cartridges to arrive at a total of n=60 measurements.
LoQ is defined as the concentration that generated less than 20%CV. Results are
summarized in the table below:
LoB LoD LoQ
0.03 mIU/L 0.06 mIU/L 0.06 mIU/L
The measuring range of this assay is 0.06 to 25.0 mIU/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference Studies
An interference study was performed according to CLSI-EP07 to determine whether
the presence of bilirubin, triglycerides, hemoglobin, or total protein may interfere with
the FREND TSH assay. Human serum pools were used with two different
concentrations (low [approx. 0.3 – 0.5 mIU/L] and high [approx. 5-10 mIU/L]) of
TSH. Each sample level was spiked with the interferent and then compared to a
6

sample which contained no interferent. The sponsor considers significant interference
as greater than +/- 10%. The results of the highest concentration tested without
significant interference are summarized below.
Interferent TSH level Recovery (%)

Hemoglobin (500 mg/dL)

An interference study was conducted to determine whether the presence of common
drugs interfere with the FREND TSH assay. Human serum pools were spiked with a
known amount of drug interferent and then compared to the control pools containing
no interferent. For each interferent, a single concentration was tested with low (0.3-0.5
mIU/L) and high (10 mIU/L) TSH concentrations. The sponsor considers significant
interference as +/- 10%. The results of the concentration tested without significant
interference are summarized below.
Interferent TSH level Recovery (%)
low 92.4
Acetominophen (1324 uM)
high 92.2
low 95.0
Diltiazem (15 uM)
high 105.4
low 101.3
Erythromycin (81.6 uM)
high 100.6
low 96.0
Verapamil (4.4 uM)
high 98.7
Interference studies of HAMA (3.5, 52.5 and 70 ng/ml) and RF (53.8, 161.3, and 215
IU/ml) were performed on TSH Low (1.0 mIU/L) and TSH High (7.20 mIU/L) serum.
The sponsor considers significant interference as greater than +/- 10%. No significant
interference was observed for concentrations at or below 52.5 ng/ml HAMA and 53.8
IU/ml RF.
Hook Effect: TSH was spiked into a human serum sample which had been depleted of
TSH. A TSH standard was spiked into the sample to achieve concentrations ranging
from 0.31- 2500 mIU/L was analyzed. No hook effect was observed at TSH
concentrations up to 2500 mIU/L.
Ambient temperature interference study was conducted and provided. Study
demonstrated that ambient temperature between 22°C and 31°C does not significantly
interfere with the TSH assay.

according to the instructions recommended in CLSI EP07-A guideline. Percent cross-
reactivity with various cross-reactants is summarized in the table below.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were conducted internally using the FREND TSH assay
on the FREND™ system and the predicate device. A total of 438 natural patient
samples ranging from 0.09 – 24.96 mIU/L were analyzed. Samples were analyzed in
singlicate on both devices. Results are summarized in the table below.
Analyte n Range Slope [95% CI] Intercept [95% CI] R2
TSH 438 0.09 – 24.96 0.951 0.0266 0.9849
[0.940,0.962] [-0.0258,0.0790]
b. Matrix comparison:
To evaluate the effect of anticoagulant, the FREND TSH assay was used to measure
the TSH concentrations of matched sets of serum and Lithium-Heparin plasma. A
total of 40 matched pair samples were analyzed and compared, giving a linear
regression line of y = 0.995x -0.320, r = 0.992.
The results from the matrix comparison study support the sponsors claim that Lithium
Heparin samples are acceptable for this assay.
