510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
K131930
B. Purpose of Submission:
The purpose of this submission is to add the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path Sample
Purification Kit for use with the previously cleared JBAIDS Anthrax Detection Kit.
C. M easurand:
The two assays in the JBAIDS Anthrax Detection Kit detect two different plasmids
(pXO1 and pXO2) that are found in virulent strains of B. anthracis. The pXO1
plasmid is a 174-kb plasmid that carries the genes for the 3 proteins, (protective
antigen [PA], edema factor [EF], and lethal factor [LF]) which comprise the
anthrax toxin. The pXO2 plasmid is a 95-kb plasmid containing the genes (cap A,
cap B and cap C) that encode the B. anthracis capsule. All known virulent forms
of B. anthracis contain both of these plasmids and loss of one or both is associated
with loss of virulence.
D. Type of Test:
The JBAIDS Anthrax Detection Kit uses real-time PCR with hydrolysis probes to
detect B. anthracis DNA.

H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS)
Anthrax Detection System is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test
system intended for the qualitative in vitro diagnostic (IVD) detection of target
DNA sequences on the pXO1 plasmid (Target 1) and the pXO2 plasmid
(Target 2) from Bacillus anthracis. The system can be used to test the
following:
· Human whole blood collected in sodium citrate from individuals suspected
of having anthrax
· Positive blood cultures
· Cultured organisms grown on blood agar plates.
The JBAIDS Anthrax Target 2 assay is used as a supplementary test only
after a positive result with the Target 1 Assay.
The JBAIDS Anthrax Target 1 and Target 2 Assays are run on the JBAIDS
instrument using the Diagnostic Wizard. Results are for the presumptive
identification of B. anthracis, in conjunction with culture and other laboratory
tests. The following considerations also apply:
· The diagnosis of anthrax infection must be made based on history, signs,
symptoms, exposure likelihood, and other laboratory evidence, in addition
to the identification of pXO1 and pXO2 targets either from cultures or from
direct blood specimens.
· The assays have not been evaluated with blood from individuals without
clinical signs or symptoms who were presumed exposed and who
subsequently developed anthrax (inhalation or other forms of the disease),
or from individuals with any form of anthrax (inhalational, cutaneous, or
gastrointestinal).
· The level of plasmid targets that would be present in blood from
individuals with early systemic infection is unknown.

--- Page 3 ---
Page - 3/15
· The definitive identification of B. anthracis from colony growth, liquid
blood culture growth, or from blood specimens requires additional testing
and confirmation procedures in consultation with public health or other
authorities for whom reports are required.
The safety and effectiveness of other types of tests or sample types (not
identified as “For in vitro diagnostic use”) have not been established.

4. Special instrument requirements:
JBAIDS instrument
I. Device Description:
The Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) Anthrax
Detection System is a fully integrated IVD system composed of the portable JBAIDS
instrument, laptop computer and software, the JBAIDS Anthrax Detection Kit with
two different freeze-dried PCR assays for detection of pathogenic Bacillus anthracis
DNA. The system has been validated using four different sample preparation kits for
isolating DNA from whole blood (IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path, QFLOWDNA Sample
Purification Kits), positive blood cultures (IT 1-2-3™ SWIPE Sample Purification

--- Page 4 ---
Page - 4/15
Kit), and plate cultures (IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path and SWIPE Sample Purification
Kits). Use of the JBAIDS DNA Extraction Control Kit is also recommended.
Prior to testing, specimens are processed using BioFire Diagnostic’s IT 1-2-3 Sample
Purification Kits. The resulting purified sample is added to Target 1 Unknown and
Target 1 Inhibition Control vials, along with reconstitution buffer. Target 1 Positive
Control and Negative Control vials are prepared using reconstitution buffer and water.
When B. anthracis DNA is present, a fragment of B. anthracis DNA is amplified.
The amplicon is detected by fluorescence using a specific hydrolysis probe. Each
probe is labeled on one end with a fluorescent reporter moiety (6-carboxyfluorescein
(6-FAM)) and elsewhere with a quencher moiety (carboxy tetramethylrhodamine
(TAMRA)). When the probe is intact, the quencher absorbs the light emitted by the
reporter moiety. During PCR, the probe hybridizes to the target sequence before the
exonuclease activity of Taq-polymerase hydrolyzes the probe, separating the
fluorophore from the quencher and permitting detection of the fluorescent signal
generated by the reporter. The fluorescent signal increases as additional templates are
amplified and more probes are hydrolyzed.
JBAIDS Software analyzes the fluorescence amplification curves and reports results
as positive, negative, uncertain or inhibited. A failure of the Positive or Negative
Control will result in the entire run being called invalid. Retesting is required to
resolve uncertain, invalid or inhibited results. The Target 2 assay is used as a
supplementary test only after a positive result is obtained with the Target 1 assay.

Reproducibility
This study was designed to establish test result reproducibility using the Joint
Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) Anthrax
Detection Kit in conjunction with the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path Sample
Purification Kit (Platinum Path) accessory. This study was performed at three
sites using contrived whole blood samples purified using the IT 1-2-3
Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit.
Qualitative Anthrax assay results were evaluated for reproducibility, and
results are presented by sample, by day, by site, and across sites.
Contrived specimens were prepared by spiking freshly collected pooled
human whole blood with inactivated B. anthracis. Spike levels consisted of
the following:
· true negative samples
· low positive samples, spiked at the limit of detection (LoD*)
· medium positive samples, spiked at 5×LoD*
* The LoD for inactivated organism was determined based upon
previous studies where the Cp values obtained when testing dilutions
of the inactivated organism stock and live organism stock (both
concentrations reported in CFU/mL) indicate that the inactivated
organism stock (i.e. the lot used in this study) contains approximately
4-fold more of the gene target than the live organism stock. To
account for these differences, the inactivated organism was used at
concentrations shown to provide similar PCR performance (i.e. similar
Cp values) to live organism; the concentrations are reported in 'live
equivalence'.
A panel of twelve pooled human whole blood samples, spiked with
inactivated B. anthracis at the two concentrations noted above and tested
twice each day for four days at each of three testing sites. There were 96 total
replicates tested at each analyte level. On each testing day, two users at each
site tested one aliquot of each of the twelve specimens. A minimum of two
JBAIDS instruments were used at each site. Three lots of JBAIDS Anthrax
reagents were used over the course of the 4 days of testing at each site. One
set of DNA Extraction Controls (EC) including one positive EC sample and
one negative EC sample, was prepared and purified during each round of
sample purification.
Run control (NC and PC) results
Negative Control (NC) and Positive Control (PC) reactions were included in
each JBAIDS run. These are freeze-dried reagent vials that either omit or
include template DNA, respectively, for the target assays; they are set up
using water in lieu of sample. In 50 out of 50 Anthrax Target 1 runs, the NC
and PC reactions were successful. In 52 out of 53 Anthrax Target 2 runs, the

--- Page 8 ---
Page - 8/15
NC and PC reactions were successful. In the run that was unsuccessful, the
entire rotor failed to amplify, correctly resulting in a failed PC. The run
control results establish acceptable run-to-run reproducibility with standard
deviations of less than one cycle for both target PCs.
Inhibition control (IC) results
A target-specific inhibition control assay (IC) is run with each sample. The IC
result is “inhibited” when the associated IC assay is unsuccessful and the
Anthrax target assay is not positive. Of the 300 processed samples, the Target
1 IC was positive for 300 samples and the Target 2 IC was positive for 299
samples. The sample with the inhibited test result for Target 2 was retested
according to protocol undiluted and at a 1:10 dilution; both retested samples
produced the expected final result of positive.
Extraction control (EC) results
A set of positive and negative DNA ECs was tested with each set of purified
samples, and both controls were required to be successful for a successful
Platinum Path purification. Based on the DNA EC results, there were 24/25
successful Platinum Path purifications reported. The sample associated with
the failed extraction result needed to be re-purified in order to achieve a
passing result.
Assay reproducibility results
Samples spiked at both the medium positive level (5×LoD) and the low
positive level (LoD) yielded positive results 100% of the time for both assays.
Samples that were not spiked with inactivated organism (true negatives)
yielded negative results 100% of the time. There were no observed
differences in qualitative reproducibility results of Anthrax assays between
days, users, or between sites testing on at least two instruments. All ICs were
successful on final test results for all samples.
Variability of the Cp values in each test run at each site was analyzed for all
samples purified with the Platinum Path kit and tested with the Anthrax Target
1 and Target 2 assays. Overall, system variability, as measured by the
coefficient of variation (% CV) of the Cp score, was below 3.5% for all
samples spiked at or above the LoD, regardless of test site. The observed
mean Cp values measured per site and per spike level were similar (within one
SD) to the overall mean Cp value, and the observed variability of the mean Cp
values across sites overlapped. The results of this study are acceptable to
establish device variability between sites including multiple operators and
multiple instruments.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There are no reported changes to the stability or expected values therefore no
study was recommended during the presubmission for this assay. For
information on stability and expected values refer to previously FDA-cleared
510(k) Premarket Notifications K051713 and K071188.
d. Detection limit:
This study was designed to establish the JBAIDS Anthrax Detection Kit when
used in conjunction with the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path sample purification kit
(Platinum Path) for whole blood samples meets the previously established
LoD of 95% positivity at 1000 CFU/mL. The study was performed in two
phases:
Phase one was a direct comparison of the test result obtained with the
previously validated purification kit (i.e. QFLOWDNA), and the new
purification kit utilizing whole blood samples spiked with live B. anthracis at
three concentrations: 10×, 1×, and 0.1× the LoD previously confirmed at 1000
CFU/mL using the IT 1-2-3 FLOW and QFLOWDNA Sample Purification
Kits. These spiked whole blood samples were split and purified with the
QFLOW kit as a reference and the Platinum Path kit under evaluation. Only
positive test results were used to determine the mean Cp values at each
bacterial spike concentration. A single Target 2 Inhibition Control (IC) was
reconstituted using one of the four samples spiked at the lowest test
concentration and processed with each of the sample purification kits. The
spiked blood samples were derived from a pool, so a single IC performed for
each set of samples processed with each purification kit was deemed
sufficient. ICs for all runs and purification kits gave positive test results,
indicating PCR was not inhibited in the pooled whole blood samples.
This first comparison run resulted in B. anthracis detection for all samples,
including at the lowest concentration of 0.1×LoD. To estimate the
concentration that Platinum Path processed samples are detected less than
100% of the time and to compare the qualitative detection of the two kits, a
second comparison of the QFLOWDNA and Platinum Path sample purification
kits was performed for whole blood samples spiked to lower concentrations:
1×, 0.1×, and 0.01×LoD. These results are also shown in Table 2. In this
second run, only three of the four Platinum Path processed samples spiked at
0.1×LoD gave positive results, even though all four of the samples spiked at
this concentration had positive results in the first run. This indicates 0.1×LoD
is at or near the spike level that qualitative detection of B. anthracis falls

--- Page 10 ---
Page - 10/15
below 100% for Platinum Path processed samples. For both purification
methods, two out of four samples spiked at 0.01×LoD showed positive test
results. The QFLOW and Platinum Path kits show similar qualitative results
above, near and below LoD, indicating the JBAIDS Anthrax Target 2
sensitivity is similar whether evaluating samples processed with the QFLOW
kit or with the Platinum Path kit.
Phase two was a confirmatory test using whole blood samples from individual
donors spiked with live B. anthracis at 1000 CFU/mL and purified with the
Platinum Path kit. Each set of 10 spiked samples was processed with an
unspiked sample (matrix blank, MB) that served as a contamination control.
Individual sample and overall mean Cp values were presented. Both matrix
blanks gave negative results for both target assays, indicating no
contamination by B. anthracis was observed. All ICs were positive except for
one associated with Sample 13. Initially, sample 13 was called inhibited for
target 2 due to a failure of the associated target 2 IC (one positive and one
negative capillary). Upon retesting according to protocol, sample 13 was
positive undiluted, as well as positive at the 1:10 dilution. Twenty out of 20
sample purified with the Platinum Path kit were positive for both Anthrax
Target 1 and Target 2 assays when spiked at the established LoD of 1000
CFU/mL.
The results of the direct comparison between the QFLOWDNA and Platinum
Path whole blood purification methods used with the JBAIDS Anthrax
Detection kit are acceptable to establish an LoD of 1000 CFU/mL.
e. Analytical reactivity/specificity:
No changes to the assay primers or probes are reported therefore no study was
recommended during the presubmission for this assay. Analytical
reactivity/specificity data for this assay can be found in K051713 and
K071188.
f. Assay cut-off:
No changes in the assay cut-off are reported. For assay cut-off data, refer to
previously FDA-cleared 510(k) Premarket Notifications K051713 and
K071188.
h. Interfering species
There are no reported changes to the assay primers or probes therefore no
interfering species study was recommended during the presubmission for this
assay. Interfering species data for this assay can be found in K051713 and
K071188.

i. Direct from culture testing
This study was designed to establish that the assays in the Joint Biological
Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) Anthrax Detection Kit
is capable of detecting and identifying targets from direct culture samples
processed using a modified IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit
protocol.
This study was performed in a BSL3 laboratory using a single strain for each
of three live organism species: B. anthracis Ames, Y. pestis CO92, and F.
tularensis Schu4. Each organism was grown on separate agar plates. Once
colonies were at least 1.5 mm in diameter, 10 positive colonies (for the given
test organism) and 10 negative colonies (5 from each of the remaining two
organisms) were processed using a modified Platinum Path protocol and
tested on JBAIDS. All NC and PC reactions for all assays in all runs were
successful.
After all colonies had grown on agar plates, one isolated colony was used to
"spike" each sample according to the modified Platinum Path protocol. Ten
B. anthracis colonies were purified alongside five Y. pestis colonies and five
F. tularensis colonies. All 20 samples were tested with JBAIDS Anthrax
Target 1 and Target 2 reagents. B. anthracis was detected in all ten B.
anthracis cultures, and all non- B. anthracis cultures produced negative
results. The mean Cp values for both anthrax targets were approximately five
cycles later than expected, yet within the detection range for the assays.
Under the conditions of this study, these results indicate that the colony
processing procedure using the Platinum Path kit can detect B. anthracis
colonies.

a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable
3. Clinical studies:
The clinical validation study was designed to validate the use of the Platinum Path
kit to process clinical whole blood specimens for testing with the previously
FDA-cleared JBAIDS Anthrax Detection Kit. Because clinical specimens from
patients infected with Bacillus anthracis (Anthrax) are not available, spiked
whole blood samples were used in the clinical evaluation. Prospectively collected

--- Page 12 ---
Page - 12/15
whole blood specimens collected in sodium citrate were obtained from patients
with febrile illness and spiked with inactivated B. anthracis. These spiked
samples were then purified in parallel using the new (Platinum Path) and old
(QFLOWdna) extraction methods, and tested with the JBAIDS Anthrax Detection
Kit.
Subjects meeting the following criteria were invited to enroll in the multisite
study after written informed consent was acquired:
Inclusion Criteria
· Subject experienced a fever of at least 100˚F within the previous 24 hours
(recorded or self-reported).
· Subject was an adult.
Exclusion Criteria
· Adult volunteers who were incapacitated or otherwise unable to provide
informed consent were excluded from the study.
· Individuals under the age of 18 were excluded from the study.
Whole blood specimens were collected at three sites that were selected for the
quality of their personnel and their access to the desired subject populations. The
study locations were representative of the intended use setting (military hospitals
and field clinics), and specimen collection was performed by trained study
personnel.
De-identified blood specimens were collected in two 5 mL sodium citrate tubes
and stored at 2-8°C. Blood specimens were shipped on ice to BioFire Diagnostics
labs twice a week. Upon arrival at the Firm, samples were assigned a new study
code number and then spiked with inactivated B. anthracis (Ames strain)
according to a randomized spiking plan. A total of one hundred (100) samples
were spiked as shown in Table 1.

adjusted to match the PCR performance of live organism (i.e. four fold lower).
The spike level is relative to the LoD confirmed for blood samples purified
with the Platinum Path kit (1000 CFU/mL live).
Blood samples were spiked and tested within seven days of blood collection.
Individuals who prepared the spiked samples were different from those who
processed and tested the samples. Two aliquots from each prepared sample were
purified, one with the Platinum Path kit and the other with the QFLOWDNA kit.
The purified samples were then tested with the JBAIDS Anthrax Detection Kit.
The combined Target 1 and Target 2 results obtained with the Platinum Path
processed samples were compared to the combined Target 1 and Target 2 results
obtained with the QFLOWDNA processed samples, which were accepted as the
correct results
Valid JBAIDS Anthrax detection results were obtained for all 100 contrived
whole blood samples purified by both the Platinum Path and QFLOWDNA Sample
Purification Kits. Table 2 provides the JBAIDS Anthrax Target 1and Target 2
test results and Cp values stratified by B. anthracis spike level.

Path kit had a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 100% as compared to samples
purified using QFLOWDNA (50/50; 95% CI = 92.9-100%). The final JBAIDS
Anthrax interpretation for samples purified using Platinum Path was negative for
50 out of 50 samples that were negative when purified using QFLOWDNA. This
represents a negative percent agreement (NPA) of 100% (50/50; 95% CI = 92.9-
100%). Overall percent agreement between the two purification kits is 100%
(100/100; 95% CI = 96.4-100%).
