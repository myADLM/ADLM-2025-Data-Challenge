H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) Tularemia
Detection Kit is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test kit intended for the
qualitative in vitro diagnostic (IVD) detection of target DNA sequences of Francisella
tularensis. The system can be used to test human whole blood collected in sodium citrate
or sputum collected aseptically from individuals greater than 18 years of age suspected of
having tularemia. In addition, positive blood cultures and colonies may be tested. This
assay is intended to aid in the diagnosis of individual presenting with signs and symptoms
of pneumonic or typhoidal tularemia. It is not intended to aid in the diagnosis of
glandular, ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, or oropharyngeal tularemia.
The JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit is run on the JBAIDS instrument using the
Diagnostic Wizard. Results are for the presumptive identification of F. tularensis in
conjunction with culture and other laboratory tests. The definitive identification of F.
tularensis from colony growth, liquid blood culture growth, blood specimens, or sputum
specimens requires additional testing and confirmation procedures in consultation with
public health or other authorities for whom reports are required.
The diagnosis of tularemia must be made based on history, signs, symptoms, exposure
likelihood, and other laboratory evidence in addition to the identification of the target
either from colonies, blood culture, whole blood or sputum specimens.
The JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit is intended for use by trained clinical
laboratory personnel who have received specific training on the use of the JBAIDS
Tularemia Detection Kit. The level of F. tularensis that would be present in blood or
sputum from individuals with early systemic or pneumonic infection is unknown.
Due to the difficulty in obtaining clinical specimens, this assay was not evaluated
with blood or sputum from individuals presenting with signs and symptoms of
tularemia who have subsequently developed pneumonic or typhoidal tularemia
pneumonic or typhoidal tularemia.
2. Indication(s) for use:

4. Special instrument requirements:
JBAIDS instrument
I. Device Description:
Note: The JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit (K072547) was developed by Idaho
Technology earlier. Now it is produced by BioFire Diagnostics.
The JBAIDS Tularemia Detection System is composed of the portable JBAIDS
instrument, laptop computer and software, and the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit,
which includes specific freeze-dried reagents for the detection of a gene target of the F.
tularensis. The JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit is specially designed for performing
real-time PCR in glass capillaries using the JBAIDS instrument and JBAIDS software.
The JBAIDS Tularemia Detection System was fully described earlier, please refer to
FDA cleared 510(k) submission: K072547.
The JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit (K072547) was previously cleared for use with
three different sample purification kits i.e., IT 1-2-3 QFLOWdna for whole blood, IT 1-2-3
VIBE for sputum, and IT 1-2-3 SWIPE for direct culture from blood agar Plate and
positive blood culture media.
The purpose of this 510(k) submission was to add the IT 1-2-3™ Platinum Path Sample
Purification Kit as the sample purification kit for use with the previously cleared JBAIDS
Tularemia Detection Kit. The IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit uses
magnetic bead technology to isolate nucleic acids, and the kit has been optimized for
extraction of nucleic acids from a wide variety of sample types. The IT 1-2-3 Platinum
Path Sample Purification Kit can replace all of the other sample purification kits used in
the JBAIDS program. The purpose of addition of IT 1-2-3™ Platinum Path Sample
Purification Kit was to reduce and simplify the supplies and reagents to use the system in
military arenas.
The JBAIDS Tularemia Detection System has now been validated using four different
sample preparation kits for isolating DNA from whole blood, sputum, direct culture from
blood agar Plate and positive blood culture media. The table below shows the comparison
of four IT 1-2-3 Sample Purification Kits Validated for use with the JBAIDS Tularemia
Detection Kit.

The reproducibility of JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit in conjunction with the Platinum
Path Sample Purification Kit was evaluated by testing a panel of whole blood and sputum
samples described below.
The evaluation with whole blood samples was conducted by testing one panel of twelve
pooled human whole blood samples twice each day for four days at each of three testing
sites. Spiking was performed at levels relative to the newly established LoD of 1500
CFU/mL. Specifically, the panel contained four samples spiked with inactivated F.
tularensis at a medium positive (5×LoD) level, four samples spiked at a low positive
level (1×LoD), and four samples that were not spiked. The samples were prepared at
BioFire Diagnostics, aliquoted and stored at 2-8˚C for testing at BioFire Diagnostics or
shipped overnight on ice for external site testing.
The evaluation with sputum samples was conducted by testing one panel of nine pooled
residual sputum samples twice each day for five days at each of three testing sites. The
panel contained three samples spiked with inactivated F. tularensis at a medium positive
(5×LoD) level, three samples spiked at a low positive level (1×LoD), and three samples
that were not spiked. The samples were prepared at BioFire Diagnostics, aliquoted and
stored frozen (≤ 15˚C) for testing at BioFire Diagnostics or shipped frozen on dry ice for
external site testing.
On each testing day, two users at each site purified and tested one aliquot of each sample
in the panel under evaluation. A total of 96 whole blood sample replicates and 90 sputum
sample replicates tested at each analyte level. All samples were processed with the IT 1-
2-3 Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit.
Overall for whole blood and sputum testing, system variability as measured by the
coefficient of variation (% CV) was 2-4% for samples spiked at the medium positive (5×
LoD) level, and 5-7% for samples spiked at the low positive (LoD) level across test sites.
The results of the reproducibility evaluation indicate that the JBAIDS Tularemia
Detection System is reproducible when used in conjunction with the IT 1-2-3 Platinum
Path Sample Purification Kit for human whole blood and sputum samples. The
performance of the system is not significantly affected by the variability associated with
different samples, operators, instruments, and test sites. The reproducibility results for
whole blood and sputum samples are acceptable and presented below in the tables.

d. Detection limits:
The Limit of Detection (LoD) for the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit was determined
with the newer IT 1-2-3™ Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit for whole blood and
sputum samples. The LoD testing was performed in two phases using live F. tularensis as
described below.
Part I: Comparison of Sample Purification Kits
Initial estimates for the LoD were performed by spiking whole or sputum specimens with
a serial dilution of live F. tularensis at 10x, 1x, and 0.1x the previously established LoD
(300 CFU/mL for whole blood, 2000 CFU/mL for sputum). The samples were then split
and purified in parallel using both purification methods i. e., Whole blood purified with
IT 1-2-3TM Platinum Path or IT 1-2-3TM QFLOW DNA Sample Purification Kits or

Sputum purified with IT 1-2-3TM Platinum Path or IT 1-2-3TM VIBE Sample
Purification Kits.
Part II: Confirmation of the Platinum Path Sample LoDs
The LoD of the whole blood and sputum for the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit was
further confirmed by purifying 20 individually prepared whole blood spiked samples and
20 individually prepared sputum spiked samples with F. tularensis, followed by
purification only with the Platinum Path kit.
Initial direct comparison between the QFLOW DNA and Platinum Path whole blood
purification methods showed the similar LoD of 300 CFU/mL but it was not confirmed in
all 20 individually prepared whole blood spiked samples (detection was 8/20 or 40%). To
reset the LoD for whole blood purified with the Platinum Path kit, a refinement dilution
series at the 50x, 5x, and 0.5x LoD levels was tested and confirmed. The LoD for whole
blood samples purified with the Platinum Path Sample purification kit was confirmed at
1500 CFU/mL.
There was no difference in the LoD of the sputum specimens using the QFLOW DNA and
Platinum Path sputum purification methods. The original LoD for sputum samples was
confirmed (detection was 19/20 or 95%) at 2000 CFU/mL with the Platinum Path kit.
The table below shows the LoD for Platinum Path-purified whole blood and sputum
samples tested with the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit.

Additional Studies: Detection of Direct Culture Samples Processed with the IT 1-2-3
Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit
The JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit was evaluated to detect and identify F. tularensis
from direct culture samples (colonies) processed using a modified IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path
Sample Purification Kit protocol. The direct culture sample processing procedure and
reagents are identical for the modified Platinum Path and the previously validated SWIPE
protocol [that was previously FDA-cleared for use with the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection
Kit (K072547)], except that intermediate reagent volumes vary. The modified Platinum
Path protocol for processing direct culture samples was designed to deliver the same
amount of PCR template to a reaction as the SWIPE protocol. For both kits, the colony is
processed by mechanical lysis followed by dilution in an elution buffer.

This study was conducted using F. tularensis Schu4 strain colonies to demonstrate that
the test system accurately detects F. tularensis. Colonies of B. anthracis and Y. pestis
were tested to demonstrate negative results. Each organism was grown on separate agar
plates. Once colonies were at least 1.5 mm in diameter, 10 individual positive F.
tularensis colonies and 10 individual non- F. tularensis colonies (five from the B.
anthracis cultures and five from the Y. pestis cultures) were processed using the Platinum
Path “Direct testing of Bacterial Cultures Protocol” and tested with the JBAIDS
Tularemia Detection Kit. Since the number of colony forming units (CFU) typically
sampled from a colony is exceedingly high, qualitative results were expected to be
positive, with early Cp values.
All samples containing F. tularensis yielded positive results, and no F. tularensis was
detected in any of the negative control samples (of B. anthracis or Y. pestis). The Target
Cp values for the F. tularensis colonies were fifteen cycles earlier than Cp values for
whole blood samples spiked at the LoD and purified by Platinum Path.
The JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit assay is capable of detecting and identifying F.
tularensis from direct culture samples processed using a modified IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path
Sample Purification Kit. Results for the testing of ten F. tularensis colonies and ten non-
F. tularensis colonies are shown in the table below.

(tularemia), are not available for testing due to the extreme rarity of natural infection with
this organism. Therefore, two clinical evaluations using surrogate specimens were
performed to validate the use of the IT 1-2-3™ Platinum Path Sample Purification Kit
with the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit.
The first clinical valuation used prospectively collected whole blood specimens collected
in sodium citrate and obtained from patients with febrile illness. The second clinical
evaluation used residual frozen sputum specimens that were spiked with inactivated F.
tularensis. In both evaluations, the spiked samples were purified in parallel using the new
and old extraction methods, and then tested with the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit.
Testing of Surrogate Whole Blood Clinical Specimens
One hundred (100) surrogate whole blood specimens were prepared using prospectively
collected specimens that were collected from febrile volunteers from November of 2012
into April of 2013. Fifty (50) of the specimens were spiked with inactivated F. tularensis
at concentrations near and above the system LoD, while the remaining 50 specimens
were not spiked with F. tularensis. The level of inactivated F. tularensis used to spike
these samples was relative to the LoD (1500 CFU/mL) established for Platinum Path-
purified whole blood specimens.
Once spiked, samples were then processed using both the new nucleic acid extraction
method (Platinum Path) and the original nucleic acid extraction method (IT 1-2-3™
QFLOWDNA Sample Purification Kit; QFLOWDNA) followed by testing with the JBAIDS
Tularemia Detection Kit. JBAIDS operators were blinded to the analyte content of the
samples. The results obtained with the Platinum Path processed samples were compared
to the results obtained with the QFLOWDNA processed samples.
The JBAIDS result for a sample purified using from the QFLOW DNA Kit was considered
the correct result. The mean Cp values decrease as the analyte concentrations increase.
The table below provides the JBAIDS Tularemia test results and Cp values stratified by
F. tularensis spike level.

The final JBAIDS Tularemia interpretation for samples purified using the Platinum Path
Sample Purification Kit had a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 100% as compared to
samples purified using the QFLOW DNA kit (50/50; 95% CI = 92.9-100%). The final
JBAIDS Tularemia interpretation for samples purified using Platinum Path Sample
Purification Kit was negative for 50 out of 50 samples that were negative when purified
using QFLOW DNA. This represents a negative percent agreement (NPA) of 100% (50/50;
95% CI = 92.9-100%). Using samples spiked near the LoD for samples purified with the
Platinum Path kit (1500 CFU/mL), the IT 1-2-3 QFLOW DNA and Platinum Path Sample
Purification Kits performed equivalently with respect to detection of F. tularensis in
surrogate whole blood specimens tested with the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit. The

Testing of Surrogate Sputum Clinical Specimens
One hundred (100) surrogate specimens were prepared using frozen residual sputum
specimens. Fifty (50) of the specimens were spiked with inactivated F. tularensis at
concentrations near and above the system LoD, while the remaining 50 specimens were
not spiked with F. tularensis.

a Samples were spiked with inactivated organism at concentrations that were adjusted to match the PCR
performance of live organism. The initial estimated inactivated organism equivalent was shown to be too
low when tested with high numbers of replicate samples spiked with inactivated organism at the 1× LoD
level. Therefore the inactivated organism equivalent at the 1× LoD level was renormalized to match the
performance of live organism.
Samples were then processed using both the new nucleic acid extraction method
(Platinum Path) and the original nucleic acid extraction method (IT 1-2-3™ VIBE
Sample Purification Kit) followed by testing with the JBAIDS Tularemia Detection Kit.
JBAIDS operators were blinded to the analyte content of the samples. The results
obtained with the Platinum Path processed samples were compared to the results obtained
with the VIBE processed samples.
The JBAIDS result for a sample purified using from the VIBE kit was considered the
correct result. The mean Cp values decrease as the analyte concentrations increase. There
were two false positive Tularemia results obtained during testing. One unspiked sample
had a false positive test result when purified with the Platinum Path kit. The other false
positive test result was for a Platinum Path purified sample spiked at the 1× LoD level.
This sample tested negative when processed with the VIBE kit (for which results are
considered “truth”), so the final interpretation for the sample was “negative” despite the
sample actually having been spiked with F. tularensis at the 1× LoD level. When a
sample is spiked at the 1×LoD level, ≥ 95% of results are expected to be positive.
Occasional negative results are therefore not unexpected (approximately 1 out of 20),
with the consequence in this case of a false positive comparative result for a specimen
spiked at the 1×LoD level. The table below provides the JBAIDS Tularemia test results
and Cp values stratified by F. tularensis spike level.
