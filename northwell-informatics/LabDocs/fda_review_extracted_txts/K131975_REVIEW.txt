L. Test Principle:
ACEDirectTotalIron-Bindingcapacity(TIBC)Reagent
The Direct TIBC Color reagent releases iron from transferrin, forming a color
complex with the dye. Then the Direct TIBC Buffer is added, shifting the pH and
resulting in a large affinity of transferrin for iron. The serum transferrin rapidly
binds the iron by abstracting the iron from the dye-iron complex. The decrease in
absorbance is directly proportional to the total iron binding capacity of the serum
sample. The absorbance is measured at 647 nm.
ACESerumIronReagent
The transferring-bound iron in serum is released at a pH and reduced from ferric to
ferrous iron. These ions react with ferrozine to form a violet color complex, which
is measured bichromatically at 554 nm/692 nm. The intensity of color produced is
directly proportional to the serum iron concentration.
ACE LDH-L Reagent
The ACE LDH-L Reagent for the Axcel Clinical Chemistry System is an enzymatic
photometric test; LDH in serum catalyzes the conversion of the L-lactate and NAD
substrates to pyruvate and NADH, and the NADH product which is measured at 340
nm. The rate of increase of absorbance from the formation of NADH is directly
proportional to the amount of LDH activity in the serum sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was conducted following CLSI guidance document EP06-A.
Serum samples were spiked with the appropriate analyte and a 10 sample
dilution series was created by diluting with a low level analyte sample. The
assigned values of the highest and lowest sample were set to their mean
values. Each level was tested in triplicate on the ACE Alera Clinical
Chemistry System. The linear regression correlation between the expected
values and the measured values for each of the assays is summarized below:
Linear Correlation
Range Tested
Regression fit Coefficient
TIBC 34 - 740 µg/dL y = 1.020x + 3.1 0.9981
Iron 6 - 666 µg/dL y = 1.030x + 1.9 0.9986
LDH-L 8 - 895 U/L y = 1.050x – 0.7 0.9981
The linearity data provided by the sponsor support the following reportable
range claims:
Analyte Assay range
TIBC 52-700 μg/dL
Iron 12-600 μg/dL
LDH-L 18-850 U/L
Automatic dilution study: The ACE Alera Clinical Chemistry System can
perform automatic dilutions of samples that exceed the upper limit of the ACE
Total Iron and ACE LDH-L assays (1:2 and 1:4 dilutions, respectively). To
examine the accuracy of the auto-dilution function for these reagents, serum
samples were spiked with high concentrations of analyte and were then either
run directly on the ACE Alera system or they were manually diluted using
system diluent (3 samples per instrument system, run in quintuplicate). The
results from the auto-dilution and the manually diluted samples, run on the
same ACE Alera system, were compared. All samples recovered within 10%

recovery. The auto-dilution function is not available for ACE Direct TIBC
Reagent.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
ACE LDH reagent
No calibrator is needed. Calibration of the LDH-L assay is traceable to a
frozen Master Pool of verification material utilized by the reagent supplier.
Each lot of reagent is tested by running the Master Pool and verifying that
results of the Master Pool levels are within an acceptable percentage of the
assigned values of the Master Pool. For value assignment, each new
verification Master Pool is made by gravimetrically adding quantities of
lactate dehydrogenase to a serum pool to target concentrations. Five levels of
Master Pool are prepared, aliquoted and stored at ≤-70° C. The final values of
the Master Pool are assigned for each level by testing at least 3 replicates on
multiple instruments. The activity levels of the new Master Pool are verified
using a previously approved Master Pool lot as a control.
ACE Direct Total Iron-Binding capacity (TIBC) Reagent
Traceable to another commercially available FDA cleared assay by method
comparison. The calibrator was previously cleared under k052148.
ACE Serum Iron Reagent
Traceable to NIST SRM 937. The calibrator was previously cleared under
k944911.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) studies were performed
and were determined to be adequate. Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) was
determined according to CLSI guidance document EP17-A, by evaluating five
low level samples with eight replicates per day over five days, for a total of 40
measurements per sample. The sponsor defined LoQ as concentration with a
%CV of < 20%. The results are as follows:

ACE Alera TIBC Iron LDH-L
LoB 11 µg/dL 0 µg/dL 11 U/L
LoD 24 µg/dL 1 µg/dL 18 U/L
LoQ 52 µg/dL 9.15 µg/dL 18 U/L
The detection limit studies support the sponsors claimed measuring
ranges for the ACE TIBC, ACE Iron and ACE LDH-L assays.
Claimed measuring range:
Analyte Assay range
TIBC 52-700 μg/dL
Iron 12-600 μg/dL
LDH-L 18-850 U/L
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed, according to CLSI guidance document
EP07-A2, to determine the effects of potential interferents. Various
concentrations of interferents were spiked into serum pools containing
analytes at normal and abnormal concentrations. All samples were tested in
triplicate on the ACE Alera Clinical Chemistry system. Six interferent levels
and the control samples were tested for each interferent. Bias greater than +/-
10% defines significant interference by the sponsor. The results of the highest
concentration tested without significant interference are as follows:
No Significant Interference at or below:

Intralipid concentration tested up to 1000 mg/dL did not interfere with the
TIBC or LDH assays, however, intralipid concentration above 125 mg/dL will
interfere with the iron assay, therefore, sponsor put a limitation in the labeling
that states “Visibly lipemic samples will interfere with the Iron assay,
therefore, lipemic samples should not be used.” In addition, since hemolysis

use hemolyzed samples.”
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
An in-house method comparison study to the predicate device was performed
with patient serum samples, in accordance with CLSI Guidance Document
EP09-A2. Serum samples covering the assay range were tested in singlicate:
50 serum samples for TIBC (45 native, 3 diluted and 2 spiked), 48 serum
samples for Iron (43 native, 0 diluted and 5 spiked), and 58 serum samples for
LDH-L (46 native, 6 diluted and 6 spiked). Results of the candidate device
were compared to the predicate device. The linear regression results are
presented in the table below:
ACE results (x) vs. ACE Alera results (y):

Intercept 3.6 0.9 -3.6
Corr. Coef., r2 0.9960 0.9995 0.9982
Method comparison studies were completed at 3 POC sites following CLSI
document EP09-A2. At least 48 determinations were made in singlicate for
serum samples, having analyte levels covering each assay’s dynamic range, at
the each of 3 POC sites on the ACE Alera Clinical Chemistry System (y) and
on the ACE Clinical Chemistry System (x) in-house, with the following linear
regression data:

determine the expected values for its particular population.
TIBC expected values are 250-425 µg/dL.
Total Iron expected values are the following for males and females, respectively:
65-175 µg/dL and 50-170 µg/dL.
LDH-L expected values are 100-190 U/L
