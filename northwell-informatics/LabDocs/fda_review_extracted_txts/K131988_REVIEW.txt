H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
The ABL90 FLEX analyzer is a portable, automated analyzer that measures pH, blood
gases, electrolytes, glucose, lactate, and oximetry in heparinised whole blood. The
ABL90 FLEX analyzer is intended for use by trained technologists, nurses, physicians
and therapists. It is intended for use in a laboratory environment, near patient or
point-of-care setting. These tests are only performed under a physician's order.
Indications for use:
pH, pO2 and pCO2: pH, pCO2 and pO2 measurements are used in the diagnosis and
treatment of life-threatening acid-base disturbances.
Potassium (cK+): potassium measurements are used to monitor electrolyte balance
in the diagnosis and treatment of disease conditions characterized by low or high
blood potassium levels.
Sodium (cNa+): sodium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of
aldosteronism, diabetes insipidus, adrenal hypertension, Addison's disease,
dehydration, inappropriate antidiuretic secretion, or other diseases involving
electrolyte imbalance.
Calcium (cCa2+): calcium measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of
parathyroid disease, a variety of bone diseases, chronic renal disease and tetany.
Chloride (cCl–): chloride measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of
electrolyte and metabolic disorders such a cystic fibrosis and diabetic acidosis.
2

--- Page 3 ---
Glucose (cGlu): glucose measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of
carbohydrate metabolism disorders including diabetes mellitus and idiopathic hypoglycemia, and of
pancreatic islet cell carcinoma.
Lactate (cLac): The lactate measurements measure the concentration of lactate in
plasma. Lactate measurements are used to evaluate the acid-base status and are
used in the diagnosis and treatment of lactic acidosis (abnormally high acidity of the
blood.)
Total Hemoglobin (ctHb): total hemoglobin measurements are used to measure
the hemoglobin content of whole blood for the detection of anemia.
sO2: oxygen saturation, more specifically the ratio between the concentration of
oxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin plus reduced hemoglobin.
FO2Hb: oxyhemoglobin as a fraction of total hemoglobin.
FCOHb: carboxyhemoglobin measurements are used to determine the
carboxyhemoglobin content of human blood as an aid in the diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning.
FMetHb: methemoglobin as a fraction of total hemoglobin.
FHHb: reduced hemoglobin as a fraction of total hemoglobin.
Fraction of Fetal Hemoglobin (FHbF): FHbF indicates the amount of fetal
hemoglobin. FHbF is seldom used clinically.

L. Test Principle:
There are four different measuring principles employed in the sensors in the ABL90 FLEX analyzer.
Potentiometry: The potential of a sensor chain is recorded using a voltmeter, and related to the concentration of
the sample (the Nernst equation). The potentiometric measuring principle is applied in the pH, pCO2, K+, Na+,
Ca2+ and Cl- sensors.
Amperometry: The magnitude of an electrical current flowing through a sensor chain is proportional to the
concentration of the substance being oxidized or reduced at an electrode in the chain. The Amperometric
measuring principle is applied in the cGlu and cLac sensors.
Optical pO2: The optical system for pO2 is based on the ability of O2 to reduce the intensity and time constant of
the phosphorescence from a phosphorescent dye that is in contact with the sample. This measuring principle is
applied in the pO2 sensor.

Spectrophotometry: Light passes through a cuvette containing a hemolyzed blood sample. The specific
wavelengths absorbed and their intensity generates an absorption spectrum used to calculate oximetry parameters.
This measuring principle is used for measuring ctHb, sO2, FO2Hb, FCOHb, FHHb, FMetHb, and FHbF.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
An in-house, 20-day precision study was performed in accordance with the CLSI guideline EP5-A2. This
study evaluated the precision performance of the ABL90 at three levels of whole blood glucose
(approximately 18 mg/dL, 99 mg/dL, and 270 mg/dL) in combinations at three different levels of pO2
concentrations (approximately 10 mmHg, 30 mmHg, and > 90 mmHg). The heparinized, whole blood
sample combinations were analyzed in duplicate, on three instruments, in 2 runs per day, for 20 days for a
total of 240 runs per glucose-pO2 concentration combination. The between-day and total precision is
summarized in the tables below.

tonometrated until the desired pO2 concentrations were achieved. Each glucose level was measured in
series, starting with pO2 ≥90 mmHg as a control and alternating with the same concentration of glucose
at lower pO2 concentrations of 80, 50, 25, 20, 15, and 10 mmHg. Seven glucose levels (9, 36, 79,119,
180, 270, and 450 mg/dL) were measured in replicates of 6 on each of the 3 analyzers, with two runs on

Based on the interference results, the sponsor claims that the pO2 level between 10 to 25 mmHg will not
significantly affect the glucose results of less than 270 mg/dL. In addition, the glucose result of >270
mg/dL for sample with pO2 level between 10 and 25 mmHg will be suppressed and a message of “Glu
not usable” will appear; the user should use an alternative method to measure the glucose result in this
case. Sponsor has provided a warning of this limitation in the operator’s manual.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
An in-house method comparison study was performed to verify bias of the glucose parameter between the
ABL90 and the comparator device, the ABL735, when measuring whole blood samples with pO2 tension in
the interval of 10 mmHg to 25 mmHg and glucose concentrations of between 9.0 mg/dL and 270 mg/dL.
Three separate pairs of ABL90 and ABL735 analyzers were used throughout the method comparison study to
simulate three external POC sites. Freshly drawn heparinized whole blood samples were tonometrated until
desired pO2 levels were achieved. The samples were then measured on each of three ABL90/ABL735 paired
analyzers. Testing was performed for 11 consecutive days. 510 data points were obtained on each of the
ABL90/ABL735 pairs. ABL90 Flex vs. ABL735 regression analysis for glucose method comparison of
samples with pO2 between 10 mmHg and 25 mmHg is summarized in the below table for each of the three
