L. Test Principle:
The VIDAS® C. difficile GDH assay principle combines a two-step enzyme immunoassay
sandwich method with a final fluorescent detection (ELFA).
The SPR serves as the solid phase as well as the pipetting device. Reagents for the assay are
ready-to-use and are pre-dispensed in the sealed reagent strips. All of the assay steps are
performed automatically by the instrument. The reaction medium is cycled in and out of the
SPR several times. Each step is followed by a wash cycle which eliminates unbound
components.
• Specific binding of GDH present in the sample with mouse monoclonal anti-GDH
antibody coated on the interior of the SPR.
• Binding between GDH and mouse monoclonal anti-GDH antibody conjugated with
alkaline phosphatase (ALP).
• Detection: alkaline phosphatase catalyzes the hydrolysis of the substrate (4-Methyl-
umbelliferyl phosphate) into a fluorescent product (4-Methyl-umbelliferone) the
fluorescence of which is measured at 450 nm.
The intensity of the fluorescence increases according to the quantity of GDH in the sample.
When the VIDAS C. difficile GDH test is completed, the results are analyzed automatically
by the instrument, a test value is generated, and a result is printed for each sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The within-laboratory precision was estimated at one site based on the
recommendations of the CLSI EP5-A2. Three human samples, including two close to
the clinical cut-off (one high negative and one low positive), were tested in triplicate
5

--- Page 6 ---
in two runs per day with two different operators, with two reagent lots for a total of
12 testing days (six days of test per lot) on one VIDAS instrument (N=72 test values
for each sample). Two calibrations were used for each reagent lot (three days of test
per calibration and lot) over the whole period of the study. Data from the study are
summarized in the following table:

The within-laboratory precision of each panel member was also analyzed by
determining the percentage of agreement between the test interpretation and the
expected outcome (negative/positive interpretation). There was no change of
interpretation for the 3 panel samples tested: all replicates of each panel member
resulted in the expected interpretation. Data from the qualitative analysis are

The reproducibility was estimated at three sites based on the recommendations of the
CLSI EP5-A2. Three human samples, including two close to the clinical cut-off (one
high negative and one low positive), were tested in triplicate in two runs per day with
two different operators, using two reagent lots for a total of six testing days (three
days of test for each lot) on three VIDAS instruments at three different sites (N=108

- 0 change of interpretation (0%) for the moderate positive sample (Sample 3).
The percentages of change of interpretation observed for Sample 1 and Sample 2
were less than 5%, which was considered as normal and expected for these types of
samples very close to the assay decision threshold (average test value for Sample 1 =
0.06 and average test value for Sample 2 = 0.12 for a decision threshold at 0.10.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls:
One positive control (C1) and one negative control (C2) are included in each VIDAS
C. difficile GDH kit. These controls must be performed each time a new lot of
reagents is opened to ensure that reagent performance has not been altered. Each
calibration must be checked using these controls. Results cannot be validated if the
control values deviate from the expected values. The expected value range for each
control is indicated on the Master Lot Entry (MLE) Card that is provided with the kit.
Calibrators:
Calibration, using the standard (S1) provided in the kit, must be performed each time
a new lot of reagents is opened, after the master lot data have been entered.
Calibration should then be performed every 28 days. The standard value must be
within the set RFV "Relative Fluorescence Value" range as indicated on the MLE
card. If this is not the case, recalibrate.
Sample stability:
Unpreserved stool specimens may be stored at 2-8°C for 3 days (from time of
collection) prior to processing. If longer storage is required, freeze the specimens at -
70°C+/- 10°C up to one month. Avoid repeated freezing and thawing cycles and
storage at -19/-31°C.
Do not use containers which may contain detergents, preservatives or media that may
interfere with the VIDAS C. difficile GDH assay results.
Samples stored in Cary Blair or C&S Transport media, or preserved 10% formalin,
merthiolate formalin, sodium acetate formalin, or polyvinyl alcohol media have not
been evaluated for use with the VIDAS C. Difficile GDH Assay.
Processed specimen supernatants, processed standard and reconstituted controls may
be stored up to 8 hours at 18-25°C or 48 hours at 2-8°C before being tested with the
VIDAS C. difficile GDH assay. Specimen supernatants and processed standard and
control storage at -19/-31°C and -70°C +/-10°C was not validated and is therefore not
recommended.
High dose hook effect:
No hook effect was observed up to purified native GDH antigen concentrations of
2 µg/mL.

--- Page 9 ---
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection was evaluated using a range of dilutions of purified native
C.difficile GDH C. difficile GDH in a pool of C. difficile-negative stool samples based
on the recommendations of the CLSI EP17-A. The limit of detection of the VIDAS C.
difficile GDH assay (at least 95% detection rate for positive samples) is 3.0 ng/mL for
purified native GDH antigen.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity:
To test for cross-reactivity, each micro-organism was diluted in a pool of C. difficile-
negative stool samples, pretreated and a single replicate was tested using the VIDAS
C. difficile GDH assay. To test for microbial interference, each micro-organism was
diluted in a pool of C. difficile-positive stool samples, pretreated and a single replicate
was tested using the VIDAS C. difficile GDH assay. The micro-organisms were tested
at a concentration of 3x108 CFU/mL (1 McFarland) for bacteria and 1x105 PFU/mL
for viruses.

N. Instrument Name:
The VIDAS and miniVIDAS instruments.
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The VIDAS instrument (K891385) was cleared in 1989. The VIDAS instrument is
attached to a computer and printer. Each instrument has five independent sections
allowing five different assays to be run simultaneously. Each section can process up to
six samples. Therefore, a fully loaded VIDAS can process thirty samples. A smaller
compact version of the VIDAS instrument, appropriately called the miniVIDAS, was
cleared under K923579 in 1993. The miniVIDAS instrument has a built-in computer,
keyboard and printer. Two independent sections each accept six tests and can process up
to twelve samples simultaneously. Each FDA cleared VIDAS assay can be run on either
the VIDAS or the miniVIDAS instrument.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes X or No _______
3. Specimen Identification:
All assay steps are controlled automatically by the instrument. The sample is transferred
into the wells. The STR strip consists of ten wells covered with labeled foil seal. The
label comprises a bar code which indicates the assay code, kit lot number and expiration
date.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The solid phase receptor (SPR) serves as both the solid phase and the pipetting device.
The foil of the first well is perforated to allow introduction of the sample. The last well
(well ten) of each strip is a cuvette in which the fluorometric reading is performed. The
center wells of the strip contain the various reagents required for the assay.
5. Calibration:
The kit contains a GDH standard (S1), a positive control (C1) and a negative control
(C2). Each calibration must be checked using these controls. Calibration should be
performed with each new lot of reagents and then every 28 days.
6. Quality Control:
The kit contains a Master Lot Entry card (MLE) which contains specifications for the
factory master data required to calibrate the test. Data from the MLE card is entered into
the instrument before each new lot of reagents is used. Calibration provides instrument-
specific information and compensates for possible minor variations in assay signal
throughout the shelf-life of the kit.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
Not applicable
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
