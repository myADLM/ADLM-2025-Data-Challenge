H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use (below).
2. Indication(s) for use:
The Afinion™ Lipid Panel is an in vitro diagnostic test for quantitative determination
of total cholesterol (Chol), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and
triglycerides (Trig) in serum. Values for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol,
non-HDL cholesterol and Chol/HDL ratio are calculated by the Afinion™ AS100
Analyzer. Chol, HDL cholesterol, Trig, and calculated LDL cholesterol, non-HDL
cholesterol and Chol/HDL ratio are used in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders
involving excess cholesterol in the blood and lipid and lipoprotein metabolism
disorders.
Afinion™ Lipid Panel Control has been designed for use with the Afinion™ AS100
Analyzer and Afinion™ Lipid Panel. Afinion™ Lipid Panel Control is intended for
use as assayed control material for total cholesterol (Chol), high-density lipoprotein
(HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides (Trig). The controls should be used to confirm
that the Afinion™ AS100 Analyzer System is working properly and provides reliable
results.
For use in clinical laboratories and point of care laboratory settings.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
Prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Afinion™ AS100 Analyzer System (cleared under k050574)
I. Device Description:
Afinion™ Lipid Panel is a fully automated assay for quantitative determination of
lipids in serum. The system consists of the Afinion™ AS100 Analyzer and a
cartridge for the measurement of Cholesterol, HDL and Triglyceride. (Please note
that the Afinion system is not able to measure the HDL level in a sample when the
triglyceride level is > 650 mg/dL.) LDL, non- HDL and Chol/HDL are calculated by
the analyzer.
The Afinion™ Lipid Panel Test Cartridge contains all reagents necessary for
determination of cholesterol, HDL and triglyceride concentrations. The operator fills
the sampling device (which is integrated in the test cartridge) with either the patient
sample or quality control material. The test cartridge is then placed in the Afinion™
AS100 Analyzer. All testing is performed automatically by the analyzer. Results of
the measured or calculated indices are printed by the analyzer.
2

--- Page 3 ---
Additionally, the following indices are calculated:
LDL cholesterol
LDL is calculated according to the Friedwald formula*:
LDL (mg/dL) = Chol – HDL – Trig/5
*This equation is not valid for non-fasting specimen, or in patients with type III
hyperlipoproteinemia. No LDL result is provided by the analyzer when
triglyceride levels are above 400 mg/dL as the Friedwald formula is less
accurate at these triglyceride concentrations.
non-HDL cholesterol
The sum of VLDL (very low density lipoprotein) + LDL is called non-HDL
cholesterol.
Non-HDL cholesterol= total cholesterol- HDL cholesterol.
Chol/HDL ratio
Chol/HDL calculated ratio = Total Cholesterol/ HDL Cholesterol
The Afinion™ Lipid Panel Controls* are serum-based assayed materials. The two
levels of control are ready to use and are sold separately.
*Each serum/plasma donor unit used in the manufacture of the control
products has been tested by FDA accepted methods and found non-reactive for
the presence of HBsAg and antibody to HIV-1/2, HCV and HIV-1 Ag

L. Test Principle:
Total Cholesterol
Total Cholesterol is measured by an enzymatic colorimetric method. Esterified and
free cholesterol are enzymatically converted into cholest-4-en-3-one and hydrogen
peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide is used by hydrogen peroxidase to couple a phenol
and 4-aminoantipyrin to a red quinoneimine dye. The color intensity is directly
proportional to the concentration of free and esterified cholesterol in the sample.
Triglycerides
Triglycerides are measured by an enzymatic colorimetric method. Triglycerides are
enzymatically converted into glycerol by lipoprotein lipase. Glycerol is then further
catalyzed in 2 steps to di-hydroxy-acetone-phosphate and hydrogen peroxide. The
hydrogen peroxide then reacts with 4-aminophenazone and 4-chlorophenol under the
action of peroxidase to form a red dyestuff. The color intensity is directly proportional
to the concentration of triglycerides.
HDL Cholesterol
In a first reaction, anti-human apolipoprotein B (apoB) antibody (R1) binds to apoB
present on all lipoproteins but HDL (i.e. non-HDL). The antibody protects non-HDL
from being degraded by pegylated cholesterol metabolizing enzymes in the second
reaction (R2). In the R2 reaction free and esterified cholesterol of HDL are converted
into cholest-4-en-3-one and hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide is used by
peroxidase to couple 4-aminoantipyrin to F-DAOS and forms a blue color complex.
The color intensity is directly proportional to the concentration of free and esterified
HDL cholesterol.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed according to NCCLS EP6-A by measuring a
dilution series of serum samples of each measurand. One low concentration and
one high concentration sample was intermixed to produce 11 concentration
levels for each measurand. Each level was measured in 4-6 replicates.
Cholesterol: y=1.000x – 4.5 mg/dL, r2=0.995
Triglycerides: y=1.009x – 2.9 mg/dL, r2=0.999
HDL Cholesterol: y=0.991x – 2.4 mg/dL, r2=0.994
Linearity was demonstrated over the following ranges:
Cholesterol: 77-511 mg/dL (Reportable range 100-500 mg/dL)
Triglycerides: 36-691 mg/dL (Reportable range 45-650 mg/dL)
HDL Cholesterol: 14-111 mg/dL (Reportable range 15-100 mg/dL)
The linearity studies support the reportable ranges claimed by the sponsor:
Cholesterol: 100 to 500 mg/dL; Triglyceride: 45 to 650 mg/dL and HDL: 15 to
100 mg/dL
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):

Afinion™ Lipid Panel Control Stability
Real time stability studies to establish unopened vial stability are ongoing.
Afinion™ Lipid Panel Control CI and CII are being measured with the Afinion™
Lipid Panel assay. The Afinion™ Lipid Panel Controls are continuously stored at
2-8 °C and are tested monthly for 12 months. All results are compared to the
initial baseline results.
Afinion™ Lipid Panel Control CI and CII were subjected to an opened vial
stability study. Control vials were stored at 2-8 °C in the periods between the test
points. Testing was performed after 7, 14 and 30 days, and thereafter weekly up
to 8 weeks. In between these testing points the vials were opened and samples
withdrawn twice a week.
The acceptance criteria for these studies was reviewed and found acceptable.
Results from the studies support the following conclusions:
Shelf life: 12 months when stored refrigerated (2-8 °C).
Opened vial stability: 8 weeks when stored refrigerated (2–8°C).
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor performed a detection limit study for the Afinion Lipid Panel
according to CLSI guidance document EP17-A.
Five samples with concentration of each measurand near 0 mg/dL were measured
in 60 replicates using 3 analyzers and 2 test cartridge lots to determine the LoB.
Five low concentration samples were similarly measured in 60 replicates to
determine the LoD, i.e., the limits of detection were calculated using the
determined LoB value and pooled SD values from the measured LoD samples.
Limits of quantitation (LoQ) were based on a determination of limits of the blank
(LoB) and Limits of Detection (LoD), i.e., the inter-assay precision of the
replicates of low concentration samples

The reportable measuring ranges claimed by the sponsor are Cholesterol: 100 to
500 mg/dL; Triglyceride: 45 to 650 mg/dL and HDL: 15 to 100 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Studies were performed according to CLSI guideline EP7-A2 to determine
whether 28 substances interfered with the Afinion™ Cholesterol, HDL and
Triglyceride assays. Two levels at medical decision concentrations of each lipid
were evaluated. No significant interference (defined as <10%) was observed up to
the following concentrations:
· Acetaminophen 200 mg/L
· Acetylsalicylic acid 1000 mg/L
· Acetylcysteine 1590 mg/L
· Ampicillin 1000 mg/L
· Ascorbic acid 6 mg/dL
· Atorvastatin 600 µg/L
· Bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated) 20 mg/dL
· Calcium dobesilate 0.7 mg/dL
· Cefoxitin 2500 mg/L
· Cyclosporine A 5mg/L
· Cyclosporine C 5mg/L
· Fluvastatin 2.97 mg/L
· Hemoglobin (hemolysis) 500 mg/dL
· Heparin 3000 U/L
· Ibuprofen 500 mg/L
· Intralipid 1000 mg/dL
· Levodopa 15 mg/L
· Lovastatin 216 µg/L
· Metformin 40 mg/L
· Methyldopa 1.4 mg/dL

· Metronidazole 200 mg/L
· Pravastatin 7.32 mg/L
· Rifampicin 64.3 mg/L
· Simvastatin 80.4 µg/L
· Theophylline 100 mg/L
· Tetracycline 50 mg/L
Limitations:
o Calcium dobesilate interferes with Afinion™ Lipid Panel at therapeutic
levels and results in falsely low results for all three assays.
o Methyldopa concentrations above 1.4 mg/dL may give falsely low
Triglyceride results. This is above toxic levels of Methyldopa and there is
no interference at therapeutic levels.
o Acetylcysteine concentrations above 1590 mg/L may give falsely low
Triglyceride results.
o Levodopa concentrations above 15 mg/L may give falsely low HDL and
Triglyceride results.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed for each measurand at four point-of-care
sites according to CLSI guideline EP09-A2-IR. Single replicates of the Afinion™
Lipid Panel measurements were taken. The number of samples was evenly
distributed among the POC sites. Pooled Afinion™ Lipid Panel results from all sites
were compared by plotting Afinion results on the Y-axis and automated laboratory
method results on the x-axis and performing a regression analysis. Results of the
analyses are presented in the tables below. The bias at medical decision points and at
elevated concentrations of each measurand was also calculated and is presented in the
last table.
