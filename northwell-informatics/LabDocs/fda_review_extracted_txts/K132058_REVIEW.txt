L. Test Principle:
The assay principle combines a one-step enzyme immunoassay competition method with a
final fluorescent detection (ELFA). The Solid Phase Receptacle (SPR) serves as the solid
phase as well as the pipetting device for the assay. Reagents for the assay are ready-to-use
and pre-dispensed in the sealed reagent strips. All of the assay steps are performed
automatically by the instrument. The reaction medium is cycled in and out of the SPR
several times. The sample is collected and transferred into the well containing an alkaline
phosphatase-labeled anti-T4 antibody (conjugate). The antigen present in the sample and the
T4 antigen coated on the interior of the SPR compete for the available sites on the specific
anti-T4 antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. During the final detection step, the
substrate (4-Methyl-umbelliferyl phosphate) is cycled in and out of the SPR. The conjugate
enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of this substrate into a fluorescent product (4-Methyl-
umbelliferone) the fluorescence of which is measured at 450 nm.
The intensity of the fluorescence is inversely proportional to the concentration of free
thyroxine present in the sample.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed two precision studies for VIDAS FT4 assay in accordance
with CLSI EP05-A2.
A panel of human serum samples was tested on three VIDAS (6 samples) and three
miniVIDAS (5 samples) analyzers with two lots of reagents. Each sample was tested
in duplicate, in 2 runs per day, for 10 days with each lot, for a total of 20 testing days,
for a total of 240 results per sample.
The precision data for the miniVIDAS are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
To establish the linearity of the assay, a study design was used based on CLSI
protocol EP6-A. A high concentration serum sample was diluted with a low
concentration serum sample to generate 12 concentrations that spanned the range
0.130 ng/dL to 8.077 ng/dL. The samples were analyzed in triplicates within a single
run using one lot of reagent, on VIDAS and mini-VIDAS analyzers.
The results were plotted and the slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient values
were calculated using weighted regression. The degree of nonlinearity was assessed

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Currently there is no reference method for FT4 assay. The VIDAS FT4 assay is
traceable to the Roche Elecsys FT4 assay (k961489).
The VIDAS FT4 assay kit calibrators were prepared in house with a pool of human
sera diluted with T4 stripped human sera. The values for the internal reference
calibrators are assigned using the VIDAS FT4 kit in comparison with the predicate
device. The VIDAS FT4 Calibrator is a liquid human serum matrix and is traceable to
internal reference calibrators. The target value of the calibrator can range from 0.46-
1.70 ng/dL, and the value is lot specific.
The VIDAS FT4 Control is a liquid human serum matrix spiked with synthetic T4

and is traceable to internal materials. The target value of the control is between 1.00-
1.70 ng/dL, and the value is lot-specific. Multiple measurements were obtained from
the VIDAS FT4 assay to calculate the control mean. The control range is calculated
as mean ± 3SD.
Sponsor has the following recommendation for their Quality Control section in the
labeling, “User should test at least 2 levels of quality control materials, one normal
and one abnormal. Since Biomereiux FT4 assay kit only have one level of quality
control material, additional quality control level should be used. Additional quality
control may be purchased from commercially available source.”
Stability of calibrator and control:
The calibrators and controls are ready to use liquid human serum matrix and are
stable for 12 months unopened when stored at 2-8°C. Once open, they are stable up
to 3 months when stored at 2-8°C. The stability study protocol and the acceptance
criteria were provided, and found to be adequate.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of the Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation
(LoQ) for the VIDAS FT4 assay was determined in accordance with the CLSI
guideline EP17-A.
LoB Test Protocol
One blank sample was tested on one VIDAS analyzer with 2 reagent lots in 12
replicates per day for 5 days yielding 120 results. For the miniVIDAS analyzer, the
blank sample was tested with one reagent lot in 6 replicates in two runs per day for
five days for a total of 60 results. The LoB is calculated as the mean of the 57th and
58th highest values for the blanks.
LoD Test Protocol
A total of 9 low level human serum samples were tested on one VIDAS analyzer with
2 reagent lots in 4 replicates per run, and 5 runs yielding 180 results. For the
miniVIDAS analyzer, a total of 4 low level samples were with one reagent lot in 4
replicates per run for five days. LoD= LoB +1.650 x pooled SD of low level samples.
LoQ Test Protocol
A total of 9 low level human serum samples were tested on one VIDAS and one
miniVIDAS analyzer with 2 reagent lots in 4 replicates per run, and 5 runs yielding
180 results. Sponsor defines the LoQ as the concentration at which inter-assay
precision is ≤ 20% CV.
The detection limits results are summarized in the table below:
VIDAS miniVIDAS
LoB 0.013 ng/dL 0.005 ng/dL
LoD 0.055 ng/dL 0.063 ng/dL
LoQ 0.13 ng/dL 0.10 ng/dL

The sponsor claimed that the VIDAS FT4 assay has a measuring range of 0.13 to 6.61
ng/dL on the VIDAS and miniVIDAS analyzers.
e. Analytical specificity:
i. Interference from endogenous substances
The sponsor performed studies to evaluate the effects of potential interferents on the
performance of the VIDAS FT4 assay, following CLSI EP7-A2. Two levels of serum
samples containing approximately 0.93 to 1.24 ng/dL and 2.48 to 2.71 ng/dL FT4
were spiked with different concentrations of the listed interferents. Each level of FT4
was tested with each interferent in 5 replicates. The level of interference was
considered not significant if there was no more than 10% difference between the
result in the presence of the interferent and the unspiked control result. The table
below lists the substances tested and the concentrations at which no significant
interference was observed:
Highest concentration tested at which no
Interferent
significant interference was observed.
Lipids 750 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 500 mg/dL
Bilirubin 22.5 mg/dL
HAMA 0.2 mg/dL
Albumin 6300 mg/dL
The sponsor states the following in the labeling regarding potentially interfering
substances:
“It is not recommended to use clearly hemolyzed, lipemic, or icteric samples, and if
possible to collect a new sample.”
“Samples containing abnormal TBG levels (very high or very low) should be not used
with this assay.”1
“No interference was observed with samples containing HAMA up to 0.2 mg/dL
when tested with VIDAS FT4 assay. For assays employing antibodies, the possibility
exists for interference by heterophile antibodies in the patient sample. Patients who
have been regularly exposed to animals or have received immunotherapy or
diagnostic procedures utilizing immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin fragments may
produce antibodies, e.g. HAMA, that interferes with immunoassays. Additionally,
other heterophile antibodies such as human anti-goat antibodies may be present in
patient samples. Such interfering antibodies may cause erroneous results. Carefully
evaluate the results of patients suspected of having these antibodies.”

ii. Interference from common drugs
The effect of 18 common drugs was evaluated on the VIDAS analyzer. For each
drug, a low FT4 concentration and a high FT4 concentration containing human serum
samples were tested. At each FT4 level, the drug-free pool and drug-containing pool
were tested in 5 replicates. For all substances tested, no significant interference was
defined as recovery ± 10% of initial value. The drugs and the highest concentration
tested which did not cause significant interference are listed below.
