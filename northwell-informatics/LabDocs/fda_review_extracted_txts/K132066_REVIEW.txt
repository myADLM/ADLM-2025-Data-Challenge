H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See indications for use below
2. Indication(s) for use:
InflammaDry is a rapid, immunoassay test for the visual, qualitative in vitro detection
of elevated levels of the MMP-9 protein in human tears from patients suspected of having
dry eye to aid in the diagnosis of dry eye in conjunction with other methods of clinical
evaluation. This test is intended for prescription use at point-of-care sites.
InflammaDry External Controls are QC materials used for verifying the performance of
the InflammaDry test reagents and assay. These controls can also be used to assist in
operator training and troubleshooting invalid results.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
· For prescription use only
· For point-of-care use
· Slit-lamp biomicroscopy is required to eliminate patients with active intraocular
inflammation.
· InflammaDry requires a visual readout. Do not interpret the test result if you have
color-impaired vision.
· The Dacron material used in the Sampling Fleece may cause allergic reactions for
some people.
· InflammaDry should be performed prior to instilling ocular anesthetic, topical
dyes, or performing Schrimer testing.
· Certain medications may cause erroneous results if used immediately before
taking a sample. If ocular anesthetic or any other topical medication has been
applied to the eye, wait at least 2 hrs prior to collecting a sample.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable; this is a visually read single use device

I. Device Description:
InflammaDry™ consists of three (3) parts: a sterile sample collector, an immunoassay
test strip in a plastic test cassette housing, and buffer in a vial. The separately packaged
and sterile sample collector has a contoured end with a dacron fleece to collect the tear
sample from the inside of the lower eyelid. The plastic housing of the test cassette body
protects the strip from unintended physical influence. Additionally, the housing
guarantees correct sample transfer onto the lateral flow assay strip. The buffer vial
contains a buffered salt solution containing: 200 mM Tris, 10% Fish 81 (sea block), 0.8%
Tergitol, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% Sodium Azide, 0.0126% Gentamycin and pH 9.5 ± 0.05.
The buffer functions as the solution that initiates the test, carries antigen through a
microfiltration process to remove unwanted cellular debris, and transports the immune
complex and the control conjugate to the “Test” and “Control” lines on the test strip
membrane.
The InflammaDry external controls are supplies as lyophilized powder in small glass
vials with screw caps. A soft and pliable plastic dropper bottle filled with DI water
diluent is provided with each set of external controls to reconstitute the lyophilized
control materials.

a blue color line at the control zone line with a red color line at the test zone line is
considered as a positive result, a blue color line at the control zone only is considered as a
negative result, if a blue color line in the control zone does not appear the test is considered
invalid.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed at three point-of-care sites using stabilizing buffer
spiked to the following concentrations: negative (zero), cutoff, +/-25%, and +/-50%,

9 monomer form of progelatinase B from human blood. The positive control
concentrations are confirmed by LC/MS/MS. Negative control is recombinant MMP-
9 in stabilizing buffer solution containing no drug.
External controls solutions are not supplied with this device but can be purchased
separately from Rapid Screening Diagnostic Inc. Users are advised to follow federal,
state and local guidelines for QC testing requirements.
Stability:
Accelerated and Real time studies have been conducted for the control material.
Protocols and acceptance criteria were described and found to be acceptable. The
manufacturer claims that when stored un-opened at room temperature, the product is
stable until expiration date which is 24 months. Open vial stability the controls should
be used on the same day they are reconstituted.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable, this is a qualitative assay.
e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity of the test with various microorganisms and cytokines was assessed
by adding 15 µl of potential cross-reactant to a sample collector fleece then running
the test as per the directions. Microorganism concentrations ranged from 500,000 and
1,500,000 microorganisms (virus, bacteria) per ml of supernatant and cytokines were
tested at 150 ng/mL. All isolates were cultured from human specimen. There were no
positive tests observed for the following:
Microorganism (virus, bacteria) and ocular enzymes:
Adenovirus, IgE, Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA), Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenza, Staphylococcus epidermis,
Streptococcus pneumonia and Pseudomonas aeroginosa.
Cytokines:
Matrix metalloproteinase: 1, 2 and 3
Tissue Inhibitor of MMP: MMP-1, MMP-2
Interference study:
The effect of different eye drops on the analytical sensitivity and specificity of the
InflammaDry ™ tests was determined. The eye drops were evaluated with two
different MMP-9 antigen concentrations, C (C – 25%) and C (C + 25%) in
5 50 95 50
duplicate. Influence of the relevant proteins on sensitivity and specificity is also
examined. Any positive or negative interfering substance identified by this testing
was re-tested using C – 50%, and C +50%.

However, the following medications show false positive or false negative results:
Vistakon, Iquix; Vistakon, Quixin; Wilson, Proparacaine; and Trusopt.
Therefore, sponsor has the following limitations in the labeling:
Patients should not be tested with InflammaDry if the following medications were
administrated into the eyes within 2 hours of the testing of the ImflammaDry.
Interferences medications: Vistakon, Iquix; Vistakon, Quixin; Wilson, Proparacaine;
and Trusopt.
Certain medications such as systemic immunodulators, topical or oral steroids,
cyclosporine, tetracycline and topical azithromycin are known to inhibit
metalloproteinase activity. Use of these medications may lead to false negative
results.

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
The InflammaDry Test underwent a clinical evaluation to determine the negative and positive
agreement of the InflammaDry with clinical assessment of dry eye. The study design was a
prospective, sequential, masked, clinical trial. Those patients who were clinically determined by
an ophthalmic clinician to meet enrollment criteria were included in the study. The study
enrolled 237 patients consisting of 164 females and 73 males between the ages of 18 and 94 years
old with an average age of 53 years. Patients presented from both private practices and academic
centers from various regions across the country. Although 257 patients were recruited, seventeen
(17) patients were excluded for a protocol deviation.
The protocol deviation involved patients receiving topical ocular anesthetic prior to the
evaluation of the tear break up time (TBUT) and corneal staining, potentially accelerating the
TBUT and inducing corneal staining.
Study testing was done on the subject’s more symptomatic eye (if no difference existed
symptomatically between the two eyes, the right eye was tested). Each subject underwent the
following sequence of testing: Each patient had the following tests performed: InflammaDry, tear
break up time (TBUT), Schirmer tear testing, and corneal staining.
The InflammaDry was compared to the clinical assessment in the table below. Derived from the
DEWS criteria, the clinical assessment was developed to represent a combination of symptoms
and signs. The pivotal clinical trial used the same metrics for TBUT, Schirmer tear testing, and
8

corneal staining as described in the DEWS criteria, however, conjunctival injection, conjunctival
staining, and the presence of meibomian disease were not tested or used to characterize the
severity of dry eye disease. In general, the worst severity for any sign tested determined the
overall severity. Symptoms are known to be poorly correlated with signs with even the most
severe dry eye patients often reporting little to no symptoms. Patients were categorized to the
highest severity level at which all required criteria are satisfied. Patients who do not meet all the
required clinical criteria for a given severity grade will be considered to be at the next lower
grade.
