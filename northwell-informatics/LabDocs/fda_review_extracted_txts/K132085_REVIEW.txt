L. Test Principle:
The assay of each device uses a double antibody sandwich method. Each test
device contains mouse monoclonal anti-β-hCG antibody colloidal gold conjugate
pre-dried on a pad. Mouse monoclonal anti-α-hCG antibody (on the Test Line)
and goat anti mouse IgG polyclonal antibody (on the Control Line) are coated and
immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane. During the test procedures, hCG in
the urine specimen reacts with the dye conjugate (mouse anti-β-hCG antibody-

colloidal gold conjugate specific to the beta subunit of hCG) and forms a
complex. Because of capillary and chromatographic effects of the nitrocellulose
membrane, the complex migrates along the membrane to the α-hCG antibody line
(T), and remains captured in the T line. As a result a red colored band develops in
the T line, indicating a positive result. If there is no hCG in the urine, there is no
red band in the test zone, indicating a negative result. The Control line should
develop in the control zone regardless of the test result.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed using urine samples spiked with a standard
containing natural intact hCG, purified from urine, and calibrated versus the
WHO 3rd standard. Concentrations included 0mIU/mL,12.5mIU/mL,
18.75mIU/mL, 25mIU/mL, 50mIU/mL, and 100mIU/mL hCG. Samples were
masked and randomized prior to testing. The study was conducted over 10
days by multiple operators at 3 hospital sites. Three lots of each of the three
formats were tested. The midstream format was tested with both the dip and
(simulated) midstream method in this evaluation. Results are shown below:

prior to testing. The lay user particpants included various levels of
educational backgrounds and ages (18 to 45 years). Each subject conducted
one test, using the English package insert as guide. Results are shown below:

To evaluate any effects of the hCG β-core fragment, urine from non-pregnant females
containing 0 and 25 mIU/ml hCG were spiked with the hCGβ-core fragment
(traceable to WHO reference reagent 99/708) to concentrations of 125,000, 250,000,
500,000 and 1,000,000 pmol/mL. Three batches of each format were tested. No
effects were seen for the concentrations tested. Results are shown below:

To evaluate for high dose hook effect, urine specimens spiked with hCG at
concentrations shown below were tested across three lots. No hook effect was
observed. Results are shown below:

1,000,000mIU/ml 9 0
Evaluations of the effect of the pH and specific gravity of urine specimens were also
performed. Results of samples containing 0 and 25 mIU/mL hCG were unaffected
across the pH range of 3-9 and specific gravity of 1.01-1.04.
Evaluations were performed to determine cross-reactivity with LH, FSH, TSH. No
cross-reactivity was observed over 3 lots. Results are shown below for one
representative lot.

160 users using the midstream test (80 using either the dip method or the
midstream method). Approximately half of the women were less than 5
weeks pregnant (based on last menstrual period). Samples were
randomly collected at various times throughout the day. Subject ages
ranged from 18 to 45 years. Subjects responded to questionnaires after
finishing the test and collected samples for tests by laboratory
