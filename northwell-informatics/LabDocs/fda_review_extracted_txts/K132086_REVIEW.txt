L. Test Principle:
The test is based on electrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of capillary
action. The electrical current generated by the reaction of glucose with the reagent of the
strip is measured by the meter and is displayed as the corresponding blood glucose level.
5

--- Page 6 ---
The strength of the current produced by the reaction depends on the amount of glucose in
the blood sample.
M. Performance Characteristics:
a. Precision/Reproducibility
Within-run (Repeatability)
Venous blood was adjusted with glucose to five glucose levels (30-50, 51-110,
111-150, 151-250, 251-400 mg/dL) across the claimed range and tested on three
lots of test strips on 10 meters (10 strips per meter). Ten replicates were tested per
meter, test strip lot and glucose concentration (300 measurements per glucose
level). Results are summarized below:

Intermediate Precision
Intermediate precision was evaluated using three lots of test strips and ten meters.
Glucose control solutions in three concentration ranges were used (Level 1, Level 2
and Level 3 or 50, 120, and 350 mg/dL). For each test strip lot, each control solution
was measured once per day on 10 meters in replicates of 10, with three test strip lots
for 10 days, so that 100 individual measurements were generated (300 measurements
per glucose level). Results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using 3 lots of test strips, 2 meters, and 11 venous whole
blood samples with glucose levels ranging from 20-600 mg/dL (13.4, 22.0, 46.9, 83.0,
107.9, 179.0, 219.6, 328.6, 451.5, 575.5, 637.8 mg/dL), obtained by spiking pooled
venous blood with a glucose solution. Each glucose level was tested with 4 test strips
over 3 test strip lots. Linear regression analysis for each test strip lot compared to the
YSI resulted in:
y = 0.9871x + 0.1910; R2 = 0.9991 for Test Strip Lot 1
y = 0.9755x - 0.5512; R2 = 0.9993 for Test Strip Lot 2
y = 0.9685x + 1.6098; R2 = 0.9992 for Test Strip Lot 3
The measuring range of the On Call Express Blood Glucose Monitoring System is 20
- 600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The On Call Express Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to the NIST
SRM 917b reference material. The method comparison study was performed using
the candidate device and YSI as the reference method.
Value assignment:
The value assignment of the On Call Express Blood Glucose control solutions were
determined by an in-house procedure. The 3 levels of control solutions (Levels 0, 1
and 2) are prepared by gravimetric addition of glucose to achieve target glucose
values and are were confirmed by the YSI method. Verification of the control
solutions are tested with 240 test strips and 2 On Call Express meters with each level
and the values were within the target ranges.
Stability:
Accelerated stability studies were conducted to assess the shelf-life and open
vial stability of the control solutions and test strips with on-going real-time stability
studies . Unopened control solutions have a 24 month shelf life and are stable for 4
months after first opening when stored at 41-86ºF (5-30ºC ) and 10 – 90% relative
humidity. The sponsor claims that the test strips be stored at 41-86 °F (5-30 °C) and

stored at 41-86 °F (5-30 °C) and 10-90% relative humidity . The study protocols were
reviewed and found to be adequate.
.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range is 20 to 600 mg/dL based on linearity studies above (section
M.1.b.).
e. Analytical specificity:
To assess potential interference, the sponsor used venous whole blood samples
adjusted to three glucose concentration intervals of 50-60 mg/dL, 100 - 120
mg/dL and 300-350 mg/dL. Each of these samples was divided into a test pool
and a control pool and each of the potential endogenous and exogenous
interfering substances was added to the test pool. Each substance was tested at a
minimum of two concentrations, normal/therapeutic and high/toxic
concentrations. The % difference between the test sample and the control sample
was calculated. The sponsor defines no significant interference as ≤ ±10 %
difference relative to the control sample. Results are presented in the table below:

User performance study:
User performance study was performed to compare the lay user self-test results
and the YSI method. Study was performed at one clinical site with 103 study
subjects. The study participants were provided with the User’s Manual in English,
and performed fingerstick tests, forearm tests and palm tests on their own. A
technician collected capillary blood from each participant for measurement on
YSI. The range of glucose values was 50.4 to 498 mg/dL as measured by YSI.
Three test strip lots were tested in the study. The results relative to YSI are

Yes ____x____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied
directly to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger,
forearm and palm. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by
capillary action.
5. Calibration:
There is no calibration required for the On Call Express blood glucose meter by the
user. The meter is automatically coded.
6. Quality Control:
Glucose control solutions at 3 different concentrations are available to be run with
this device and only one control level is provided with the kit. The meter
automatically distinguishes control solution from blood and marks control solution
tests with a check mark and excludes them from average calculations.
Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling.
16

--- Page 17 ---
An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label and on
the bottom of the test strip box. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the
control result falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Sample volume study:
The sponsor performed a study to verify the test strip minimum sample volume
requirement and the test strip fill error requirement established for the On Call
Express blood glucose meter. Blood samples with 3 glucose concentrations were
tested at five sample volumes (0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6mL) and values obtained
were compared to YSI values. Results support the claimed minimum sample
volume of 0.4 mL and the error code for insufficient sample volume of 0.3 mL.
2. Altitude Study:
This study was conducted at a single site to evaluate the effect of altitude on the On
Call Express Blood Glucose Monitoring System. The tested glucose range
(obtained using YSI reference method) was from 45 to 480.5 mg/dL at sea level
and 31.7 to 541.5 mg/dL at 8,516 ft above sea level. Fingerstick blood samples
were collected and compared to the YSI analyzer reference value. These blood
samples were evaluated using both the On Call Express BGMS and a YSI glucose
analyzer. Each test strip glucose value was compared to the YSI method and then
analyzed as a percent bias. The glucose values obtained using the On Call Express
blood glucose meter had acceptable biases to support the altitude claim of 8,516
feet.
3. Hematocrit Study:
The sponsor performed hematocrit studies using 6 different hematocrit (30, 35, 40,
45, 50, and 55%) levels across the glucose measuring range (target glucose
concentrations 40 – 50, 100 - 120, 280 - 300, and 500 – 550 mg/dL). 3 test strip lots
were evaluated and compared to the YSI method. The results support the sponsor’s
claimed hematocrit range of 30 –55%.
4. Test System operating conditions:
The effect of different temperature and humidity combinations on the performance
of the system was assessed using three test strip lots tested at 7 combined
temperature and relative humidity conditions 41 F(5ºC)/10% RH, 69.8 F (21 ºC)/
10% RH, 113 F (45 ºC)/10%, 41 F (5 ºC)/90% RH, 69.8 F (21 ºC)/ 90% RH, 113 F
(45 ºC)/ 90% RH, and 69.8 F (21 ºC)/ 45% RH). Three blood samples were
adjusted to the following glucose concentration levels: (40-60 mg/dL, 100-120
mg/dL, 500-550 mg/dL). Each sample was also compared to the YSI reference
method. The results support the claims in the labeling that the system can be used
17

--- Page 18 ---
in temperatures ranging from 5 - 45ºC and relative humidity conditions ranging
from 10 – 90%.
5. Readability Assessment:
The readability of the labeling (user guides, test strip package insert and control
solution package insert) using a Flesch-Kincaid analysis and were found to be
written at the 8th grade level.
6. EMC Testing: The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable
electromagnetic testing (EMC) had been performed.
7. Software documentation:
The software documentation was reviewed and found to be acceptable. The firm
provided documentation to support the device was designed, developed and is
under good software lifecycle processes.
9. Infection Control Studies:
The device system is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy
studies were performed on the materials comprising the meter by an outside
commercial testing demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV)
with the chosen disinfectant, (DisCide Ultra Wipes) Quaternary
Ammonium/Isopropyl Alcohol disinfectant wipe (EPA Reg. No. 10492-4). This
study was originally cleared in k112653. Robustness studies were also performed
by the sponsor using the On Call Express BGMS and demonstrating that there was
no change in performance or external materials of the meterafter 260 times of
cleaning and disinfection cycles, using (DisCide Ultra Wipes) Quaternary
Ammonium/Isopropyl Alcohol disinfectant wipes, to simulate 5 years of use by
layusers. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning
and disinfection procedures.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
