H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for THC is a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence
assay that is intended for prescription use in central laboratories only on the RapidFRET
Integrated Workstation. The assay is used to perform a qualitative screen for
Tetrahydocannabinol at 4 ng/mL in neat oral fluid samples collected with the RapidEASE
Oral Fluid Collector. This assay provides only a preliminary result. To obtain a
confirmed analytical result, a more specific alternate chemical method such a s GC/MS or
LC/MS/MS is required. Professional judgment should be applied to any drug test result,
particularly when using preliminary positive results. For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only.
The RapidFRET Oral Fluid THC Calibrator Set and RapidFRET Oral Fluid THC Control
Set are intended for use only with the RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for THC and samples
collected with the RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collector. The cutoff calibrator is used to
determine the cutoff level and translate the assay measurement into a positive or negative
result. The positive and negative controls are used to monitor laboratory systems,
operators, precision, accuracy and assay conditions. For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use in central laboratories only.
The assay is not designated for use in point-of-care settings.
4. Special instrument requirements:
For use with the RapidFRET Integrated Workstation instrument
I. Device Description:
The RapidFRET Oral Fluid THC Assay consists of THC Acceptor Reagent (Reagent A)
2

--- Page 3 ---
which is a THC antibody conjugated to an acceptor fluorophore in buffer with preservative;
THC Donor Reagent (Reagent B) which is a donor fluorophore conjugated to THC drug
derivative in buffer with preservative; and Matrix Blank Reagent which is an acceptor
reagent without added antibody or acceptor fluorophore. The assay kit also includes 96-well
microtiter plates. RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collectors are used exclusively with the
RapidFRET Oral Fluid THC Assay to collect saliva samples by direct expectoration. They
are sold separately and consist of individually wrapped and labeled collectors including a
sample adapter, sample tube, sealing cap and shipping pouch.
Controls: The Rapid FRET Negative and Positive controls are synthetic oral fluid based
buffers and are ready to use. The controls are prepared at 50% and 150% of the
negative/positive cutoff, 2 ng/mL and 6 ng/mL, respectively.
Calibrators: The RapidFRET Oral Fluid Calibrators are synthetic oral fluid based buffered
solutions that are ready to use and consist of a Negative Calibrator (0 ng/mL) and a Cutoff
Calibrator (4 ng/mL).

L. Test Principle:
The RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for THC is an in vitro diagnostic competitive
immunoassay used to detect THC in human oral fluid. This is a ready-to-use homogenous
system that involves energy transfer between an acceptor fluorophore labeled to an antibody
and a donor fluorophore labeled to drug. The assay is based on competition between drug
in the sample and drug labeled with the donor fluorophore for a fixed number of binding sites
on the antibody reagent. When acceptor and donor fluorophores are brought into close
proximity through a binding event, energy transfer occurs. The fluorescence resonance
energy transfer (FRET) signal is measured at the wavelength of the acceptor fluorophore and
is inversely proportional to the amount of drug in the sample. A Cutoff Calibrator is used to
translate the sample measurement into a positive or negative result. Controls are used to
establish and monitor precision and accuracy.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All performance testing of the RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for THC was performed on
the RapidFRET Integrated Workstation.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Three lots of the RapidFRET THC were analyzed, four times daily, over 43 days total
with 22 data collection days. Negative oral fluid pools were spiked with NIST weight
traceable THC standards at 0%, +/-25%, +/-50%, +/-75%, at the cutoff and at +100%
of the cutoff.
Representative data from lot 1 is summarized below. The percentage of negative and
positive results was consistent across the three lots tested. Two professional
laboratory operators were used to collect this data. Results are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable. This is a qualitative assay
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The cutoff calibrators and controls are prepared by spiking known concentrations of
THC into synthetic oral fluid to obtain the cutoff level of the calibrator and the
positive and negative controls. The negative calibrator is drug free synthetic oral
fluid. Calibrators and controls are prepared from Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol from a
commercial vendor that uses NIST traceable weights and specific assays such as
HPLC and GC/MS to confirm drug levels.
Value Assignment-Calibrators and Controls
Calibrator and control lots are value assigned during the manufacturing process in
two stages. During the first stage following bottling and labeling, new lots are
assayed against at least one previously accepted, released and unexpired Calibrator
and Control lot using RapidFRET reagents. Results are qualitatively evaluated for

performance relative to the previously accepted lots. During the second stage, each
new manufactured lot of Calibrator (Cutoff only) or Control (POS and NEG) is
quantitatively confirmed by MS based method for target analyte concentration.
Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
Stability-Calibrators and Controls
Real-time stability studies were conducted on multiple lots of calibrators and controls.
The stability protocol was reviewed and found acceptable. The testing supports the
stability at 2-8˚ C for 12 months for closed vial and 30 days for open vial for both the
RapidFret Oral Fluid THC Calibrator Set and RapidFret Oral Fluid THC Control Set.
Shipment Stability:
Neat oral fluid pool was spiked with THC to 0%, +/-25%,+/- 50%,+/- 75%, 100%, of
cutoff. Each spike was processed through a RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collection device
to mimic actual collection process as close as possible. Aliquots were stored and
handled according to the collector insert. Samples were shipped at ambient
temperature from California to Maine and back again multiple times. Samples were
assayed using the RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for THC before and after each
shipment. At various time points, aliquots were reserved and analyzed quantitatively
by a MS based method. During the 17 day study, temperatures ranged from
approximately 4-30 ˚C and the relative humidity (RH) ranged from 7% to 100%.
Recoveries comparing pre-shipping concentrations vs. post-shipping concentrations
ranged from 90.1% to 107.7%.
Sample Storage and Stability:
Conditions for oral fluid sample handling and storage was evaluated by spiking oral
fluid samples with THC from 0 ng/mL to 8 ng/mL in approximately 1 ng/mL
increments. Samples were processed through RapidEASE oral fluid collection
devices and stored under various conditions including room temperature, refrigerated
(2-8˚ C) and frozen (-10 to -25˚ C). Samples were periodically sampled and analyzed
by RapidFRET and mass spectrometry. For each storage condition two sets of spikes
of 9 levels each were prepared and analyzed in tandem. Recovery for refrigerated
samples ranged from 91.5% to 100%, and for frozen samples ranged from 108% to
114%. Samples are stable for up to 7 days at room temperature, up to 21 days at 2-8˚
C, and up to six months at -10 to -25˚ C.
Sample Recovery Study
6

--- Page 7 ---
A sample recovery study was performed in which approximately 6.0 mL of neat,
human oral fluid pool was aliquoted into glass tubes and spiked with THC to
concentrations ranging from approximately 0% of cutoff (0 ng/mL) to 200% cutoff (8
ng/mL) in five replicates for each spike level. Approximately half of the volume of
each of these samples were then processed through a RapidEASE Collector to mimic
real life use. Both the Pre-RapidEASE and Post-RapidEASE sample for each spike
level were confirmed for THC concentration by mass spectrometry. Recovery ranged
from 98.7% to 103.4% for all of the THC concentrations. Results are summarized in
the table below:
