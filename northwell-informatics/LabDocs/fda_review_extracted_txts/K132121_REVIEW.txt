determination of glucose in venous whole blood, arterial whole blood, neonatal heel stick
and neonatal arterial whole blood samples throughout all hospital and all professional
healthcare settings.
The system should only be used with single-use, auto-disabling lancing devices when
performing a capillary finger stick or neonate heel stick.
It is not intended for use with neonate cord blood specimens.
It is not intended for the screening or diagnosis of diabetes mellitus but is indicated for
use in determining dysglycemia.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
For in vitro diagnostic use only
Capillary whole blood specimens (e.g. obtained by fingerstick) should not be used in
patients receiving intensive medical intervention/therapy because of the potential for pre-
analytical collection error and specifically in patients with decreased peripheral blood
flow, as it may not reflect the true physiological state. Examples include, but are not
limited to, severe hypotension, shock, hyperosmolar-hyperglycemia (with or without
ketosis) and severe dehydration.
The system has not been evaluated for use with neonate venous blood.
Temperature and humidity extremes - Test results may be inaccurate when test strips are
stored outside of the storage and handling conditions.
Altitudes above 15,000 feet (4500 meters) above sea level have not been evaluated.
Specimens - Only fresh whole blood or whole blood collected in lithium heparin
collection devices should be used for arterial and venous specimens.
Fluoride, EDTA, Sodium, and Ammonium blood collection devices should not be used.
Use only whole blood. Do not use serum or plasma.
Should only be used with single-use, auto-disabling lancing devices

L. Test Principle:
The Nova StatStrip Hospital Meter System is based on electrochemical biosensor technology
and the principle of capillary action. The system quantitatively measure blood glucose levels
using glucose oxidase enzyme chemistry. The electrons generated during this reaction are
transferred from the blood to the electrodes. The magnitude of the resultant current is
proportional to the concentration of glucose in the specimen and the signal is converted into a
readout displayed on the meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
This submission was for the expansion of the indications for use to add the use of venous and
arterial blood samples (lithium heparin) in hospitalized patients. The expanded indications
for use is supported by a clinical study (see section M below). The meter, test strips, and
software were not modified from the predicate.

open-vial stability is 180 days when stored at the recommended storage temperatures
33-86°F and 10-90% RH or until the expiration date printed on the label, whichever
comes first. The labeling instructs the users not to freeze the test strips.
.
c. Detection limit:
The reportable range for the Nova StatStrip Blood Glucose Hospital Meter
is 10 to 600 mg/dL. This range was verified by the linearity established in k063821;
section M.1.b.
d. Analytical specificity:
Potential interference from some common endogenous and exogenous substances was
established in k060345.
Additional interference testing was performed to support the additional intended use
claims. To study the effects of commonly used drugs and endogenous substances on
the StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meter System, one lot of strips and three levels of
blood glucose concentrations (20 - 80 mg/dL, 100 - 200 mg/dL, and 250-400 mg/dL)
were used. Blood samples at each glucose concentration were spiked with a toxic
concentration of one of each of 80 potential interferents and tested on five Nova
StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meters. The results were compared to results from
unspiked, control samples and the concentrations at which no significant interference
was observed are listed in the table below:

different hospitals.
The study was comprised of patients throughout the hospital which included
emergency rooms, operating rooms, oncology departments, intensive care units,
medical intensive care units, surgical intensive care units, cardiovascular surgical
intensive care units, pediatric intensive care units, transplant departments, cardiac
departments, nursing, and surgical departments.
Samples from patients, ages 1 month – 94 years of age, were analyzed using 4 test
strip lots at each study site. Results obtained by a point of care user on the StatStrip
Glucose Hospital Meter were compared to results obtained on the comparator method
(Roche COBAS Modular P800 Chemistry System at sites 1, 2, 4 and 5, and the
Beckman Coulter Synchron UniCel DxC 800 at site 3). Glucose results, patient
conditions (see Patient Conditions table below for details), physiological status (e.g.,
pH, pO2, pCO2, sO2, albumin, protein, red blood cell count, hematocrit, hemoglobin,
platelets, white blood cell count, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular
hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), major histocompatibility complex (MHC),
sodium, potassium, calcium, lactate, chloride, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN),
triglycerides, Multiple Organ Dysfunction (MOD) score), and medication information
(see the Medications table below for details) were collected during the study. The
glucose ranges, according to the reference method, and the number of samples
obtained at each study site are summarized in the table below:

CLIA WAIVER
The Nova StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meter System previously obtained CLIA WAIVER
by application on February 28, 2008. The study performed to support CLIA waiver for
this device was reanalyzed to evaluate whether the arterial and venous data would meet
new and clinically appropriate Limits of Erroneous Results (LER) and Allowable Total
Error (ATE) for the sponsor’s new intended use population (all hospitalized patients).
The analysis demonstrates that the previous CLIA Waived studies in venous and arterial
whole blood meet appropriate waiver standards for hospitalized patients. The percentage
of arterial and venous data over the entire measurement range that falls within the ATE
zone is 98.4% (363/369). None of the results were in the LER zone.
Therefore, the sponsor’s CLIA waived status is extended to cover the new intended use
claims cleared in this current submission.
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not Applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Normal (non-diabetic) adult fasting: Less than 100 mg/dL (5.55 mmol/L) and less than
140 mg/dL (7.77 mmol/L) 1-2 hours after meals
American Diabetes Association. Diabetes Care (2013), Volume 36, Supplement 1.

Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?:
Yes or No X .
2. Software:
As established in k060345 and k063821. No changes were made to the software in this
submission.
3. Specimen Identification:
The Nova StatStrip Glucose Hospital Meter memory will store 1000 patient tests, 200 QC
tests, and 4000 operators.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary fingerstick whole blood, arterial,
venous, neonatal heel stick and neonatal arterial. The blood sample is applied directly to
the test strip by capillary action.
The meter stores patient test data, quality control test data, and other information relating
to the patient, patient sample, operator, reagents, and meter. Meter setup options relating
to authorized operators, reagent lots, QC preferences, and other operational settings are
customizable. Data is transferred bi-directionally between the meter, data docking station,
and separate data management system each time a meter is placed in to a data docking
station.
5. Calibration:
As established in k060345, the meter does not require the user to input a test strip code.
6. Quality Control:
Three levels of aqueous ready to use glucose control solutions are available with this
system (Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3). Control solution testing can be performed by
pushing the QC key, entering (or scanning) the test strip lot number. Recommendations
on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. An acceptable range
for each control level is printed on the vial label of the control being used.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1) Hematocrit study:
As established in k060345 and k063821 to support the claimed hematocrit range of 20-
65%.
2) Altitude study:
As established in k060345 to support the use of the device up to 15,000 ft.

--- Page 24 ---
3) Temperature and humidity studies:
As established in k060345 to support the claimed operating condition range of 59°F -
104°F and 10-90% relative humidity.
4) Infection Control Studies: The device is intended for multiple-patient use. Clorox
Germicidal Wipes, EPA registration # 67619-12 was validated demonstrating complete
inactivation of live virus for use with the meter. The sponsor also demonstrated that there
was no change in performance or in the external materials of the meter after 10,950
cleaning and disinfection cycles (one cycle includes one cleaning wipe plus one
disinfecting wipe) to simulate 3 years of device use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate
instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
5) Certificates of Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) as established in k060345.
6) Customer Care Service Center is available by calling 800-345-6682.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
