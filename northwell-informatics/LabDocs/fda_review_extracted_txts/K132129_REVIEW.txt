SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification
Review Memorandum
To: Hologic, Inc. (Gen-Probe Prodesse, Inc.) RE: K132129
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own
Class II devices requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable:
1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device:
Prodesse ProFluTM+ Assay
510(k) number: K110968
2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in
its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for use
and package labeling.
3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S) to demonstrate that the FUNDAMENTAL
SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.
The 510k submission contained modifications to the Internal Control and Positive Controls as well as
expanded Reactivity table to include two additional strains of Influenza A virus, Influenza
A/Indiana/10/2011 and Influenza A/Anhui/1/2013. The modifications are summarized as follows:
a. Outsourcing of the manufacturing of the Internal Control and subsequent minor changes to vector
sequence;
The current Internal Control (RIC) in ProFlu+ Assay contains a RNA in vitro transcript (IVT). The
new Universal Internal Control (UIC-A) will contain a RNA in vitro transcript (IVT) and a DNA
plasmid to allow users to perform one nucleic acid extraction and test with any combination of the
Pro+ Series Assays including ProFlu+, ProhMPV+, ProParaflu+, ProFAST+, and ProAdeno+.
Due to the different vector being used in the Universal Internal Control (UIC-A), a minor change
was made to the 5’ and 3’ ends of the UIC-A sequence.
The concentration of the RNA IVT in the Universal Internal Control (UIC-A) is the same as in the
current Internal RNA Control (RIC). Handling of Universal Internal Control is identical to that of
the current Internal RNA Control (RIC) included in the ProFlu+ Assay.
b. Outsourcing of the manufacturing of the Positive Control leading to minor changes in the vector
sequence, changes to control format and concentration;
The current Positive Controls consist of 4 individual controls for Influenza A (HCT75), Influenza B
(HCT76), RSV A (HCT77) and RSV B (JCT78), respectively. The new Positive Controls contain
a pooled positive control for Influenza A, Influenza B and RSV A, and a RSV B Control.
· Due to the change in vector, a minor change was made to the 5’ and 3’ ends of the
Control sequences.
· The handling of the Positive Controls for the ProFlu+ Assay will be changed to eliminate
the customer dilution that occurs immediately prior to RT-PCR setup, effectively raising
the testing concentration one log.

c. Revised reactivity table to include two additional strains of Influenza A, Influenza
A/Indiana/10/2011 (H3N2v) and Influenza A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9);
The Influenza A/H3N2v can be detected at 102 TCID /mL and Influenza A/H7N9 RNA can be
50
detected at 0.02 pg/µL.
d. Change in Stability Claims.
The stability study demonstrated that the intermediate stock of the Universal Internal Control can
stand up to 2 freeze-thaw cycles, the performance of ProFlu+ Supermix can stand up to 5 freeze-
thaw cycles (same as the current stability claim), and M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase and RNase
Inhibitor II can stand up to 10 freeze-thaw cycles (increased from the current 5 freeze-thaw
cycles)

*Although this test has been shown to detect A/Anhui/1/2013 H7N9 virus RNA and influenza A/
Indiana/10/2011 H3N2v cultured from positive human respiratory specimens, the performance
characteristics of this device with clinical specimens that are positive for H7N9 or H3N2v influenza viruses
have not been established. The Prodesse ProFlu+TM Assay can distinguish between influenza A and B
viruses, but it cannot differentiate influenza A subtypes.
5. A Design Control Activities Summary:
a. To demonstrate that the modifications in Controls do not change the assay performance,
Analytical Studies and a Comparison Study were conducted.
- Analytical Performances:
· Analytical Sensitivity Confirmation
LoD, which was established in K110968 in 2011, was confirmed for Influenza A, Influenza
B, RSV A and RSV B using one strain of each virus when tested with the UIC-A and
modified Positive Controls side by side with the current RIC and Positive Controls. The
confirmed LoDs are as follows:
Influenza A 1X 102 TCID /mL
50
Influenza B 1X 101 TCID /mL
50
RSV A 1X 101 TCID /mL
50
RSV B 1X 102 TCID /mL
50
· IC Interference Study
The IC Interference Study demonstrated that the new control, UIC-A, did not inhibit the
detection of target organisms at levels close to LoD.
· Sample Stability Study
The study demonstrated that the stability of the samples would not be affected by a
change in the internal control.
· Extractor Equivalency Studies

The equivalency of nucleic acid extraction methods between the bioMérieux NucliSENS
easyMAG automated extractor and Roche MagNA Pure LC extractor were evaluated by
spiking the cultured and tittered strain of Influenza A into a negative nasopharyngeal
swab (NPS) matrix pool at the confirmed LoD concentration. The study demonstrated the
equivalency between the two extraction methods.
- Comparison Study:
The comparison study was conducted for all Pro+ Series Assays including ProFlu+,
ProhMPV+, ProParaflu+, ProFAST+, and ProAdeno+ testing 366 positive samples and 66
negative samples. Among the 366 positive samples, 330 were retrospective pre-selected
archived NPS specimens with 30 positive samples per target (11 targets total) and 36 were
contrived samples, generated by spiking individual negative retrospective NPS samples with
whole organism (Influenza A/Seasonal H1 or Parainfluenza 2). Each sample was split into 3
aliquots; one aliquot was tested using the current Internal RNA Control (RIC), one aliquot was
tested using the Universal Internal Control (UIC-A), and one aliquot was tested using the
current Universal Internal Control (UIA-P) for ProAdeno+ Assay. All samples were then split
into 72 panels with 6 samples per panel, extracted and tested by four different operators.
Half of the panel samples were extracted using the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG method
and the other half using the Roche MagNA Pure LC method. Of the 432 samples utilized in
the study, 21 samples were removed from analysis due to the invalid controls or incomplete
test results. The results for ProFlu+ Assay are summarized in the following tables:

The results of the analytical studies and the clinical study confirmed the original performance
claims of the ProFlu+ Assay and demonstrated that assay performance was not affected by the
incorporation of the modified Universal Internal Control (UIC-A) and Positive Controls. The
ProFlu+ Assay package insert has been updated to reflect the changes in the controls.
b. To assess the reactivity of the ProFlu+ Assay with influenza A(H3N2v) virus and influenza
A(H7N9) virus, a cultured and tittered strain of H3N2v and purified genomic RNA isolated from a
strain of H7N9 were diluted in series to near the assay cutoff. RNA isolated from Flu A/H7N9
instead of a cultured and tittered Flu A/H7N9 virus was used in the reactivity study due to the
requirement of biosafety Level 3 unavailable at Gen-Probe Prodesse. The study results showed
that the ProFLu+ Assay can detect Influenza A/H3N2v at 102 TCID /mL and Influenza A/H7N9
50
RNA at 0.02 pg/µL.
Although this test has been shown to detect A/Anhui/1/2013 H7N9 RNA and influenza A/
Indiana/10/2011 (H3N2v) virus cultured from positive human respiratory specimens, the
performance characteristics of this device with clinical specimens that are positive for H7N9 or
H3N2v influenza viruses have not been established. The Prodesse ProFlu™+ Assay can
distinguish between influenza A and B viruses, but it cannot differentiate influenza A subtypes.
The ProFlu+ Assay package insert has been updated to include the revised reactivity table.
c. To assess the stability of the Universal Internal Control (UIA) and new Positive Controls, an
accelerated Stability study for the Controls stored at -70oC and a freeze-thaw stability study were
conducted with one lot of each assay component. The studies demonstrated that the UIC-A and
modified Positive Controls can be stored at ≤ -70oC for 20 months with up to 2 freeze thaw
cycles. Influenza A/Influenza B/RSV Reagent Mix can be frozen and thawed for up to 5 times,
and M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase and RNase Inhibitor II up to 10 times, an increase from the
current 5 freeze-thaw cycles. The ProFlu+ Assay package insert has been updated to reflect the
current stability claims.
d. A declaration of conformity with design controls was submitted for the manufacturing facility which
includes:
i) A statement signed by the Senior Director of R & D, Gen-Probe Prodesse, Inc., was
submitted confirming that, as required by the risk analysis, all verification and validation
