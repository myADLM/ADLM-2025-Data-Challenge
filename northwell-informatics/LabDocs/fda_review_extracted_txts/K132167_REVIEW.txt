L. Test Principle:
i-CHROMA iFOB is an immunoassay system based on antigen-antibody reaction and
fluorescence technology. When a human fecal sample is mixed with the detection buffer in
the sample collection tube, the fluorochrome-labeled detector antibodies (anti-hemoglobin) in
the detection buffer binds with hemoglobin in the fecal occult blood (FOB). The test is
performed using test cartridge, sample collection tube and ID chip of matching lot numbers.
Test components of different lots are not interchangeable.

When the fecal sample mixture is loaded into the sample well on the test cartridge, it
migrates through the nitrocellulose matrix of the test strip. The fluorochrome-labeled
detector antibody-analyte (FOB hemoglobin) complexes get captured on to the capture
antibodies (anti-hemoglobin) which have been immobilized at the test line on the test strip.
As a result, the fluorochrome-labeled complexes of the detector antibody-analyte (FOB
hemoglobin)-capture antibody accumulate at the test line on test cartridge membrane. Thus,
the more hemoglobin in the human fecal sample, the more complexes that get accumulated at
the test line on the test cartridge membrane.
Upon inserting the sample-loaded test cartridge in the i-CHROMA Reader, the laser light
illuminates the test cartridge membrane thereby triggering fluorescence from the
fluorochrome-labeled complexes of hemoglobin (accumulated at the test line) as well as the
control line.
The fluorescent light is collected together with the scattered laser light. Pure fluorescence is
filtered from the mixture of the scattered and fluorescent light. Intensity of the fluorescence
is scanned and converted into an electric signal which is proportional to intensity of
fluorescence and hence to the concentration of FOB hemoglobin in the test sample. The on-
board microprocessor computes the FOB hemoglobin concentration based on a pre-
programmed calibration. The computed and converted result is displayed by the i-CHROMA
Reader in a qualitative (positive or negative) manner based on an analytical cut-off of 100
ng/mL (hemoglobin in fecal sample mixed with detection buffer). The i-CHROMA iFOB
and i-CHROMA Reader are compatible only with each other.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The repeatability and reproducibility of i-CHROMA iFOB was evaluated by testing
20 replicates of fecal samples spiked with human blood to obtain test samples
containing seven different concentrations of human hemoglobin: 50 ng/mL, 85
ng/mL, 90 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, 110 ng/mL, 115 ng/mL and 1000 ng/mL.
Between site reproducibility study was conducted at three intended use sites in the
US. Test samples were prepared at study site 1 and the same samples were tested at
all the three US sites. The samples were shipped to the testing sites in Styrofoam
boxes containing ice packs. i-CHROMA iFOB testing was carried out in a random
and blinded manner. No invalid or indeterminate results were obtained throughout
the precision studies.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Control material was used as test samples for determining the measuring range of i-
CHROMA iFOB. Two sets of control samples were tested: one set of 16 levels of human
hemoglobin A0 (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, and 120
ng/mL) to cover the lower measuring range and the second set of 8 levels of human
hemoglobin A0 (800, 850, 900, 950, 1000, 1100, 1250, and 1500 ng/mL) to cover he
higher measuring range. Nine replicates of test samples at each of the above analyte
levels were tested in a single run by the same operator using same lot of test components
and same instrument at the same testing site on the same day. Numerical values of test
results of the nine replicates at each analyte level were statistically analyzed to calculate
the mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation (% CV). The lowest
concentration of analyte showing coefficient of variation below 10% was considered as
the lower limit of the measuring range. The highest concentration of analyte showing
coefficient of variation below 10% was considered as the upper limit of the measuring
range. The measuring/reportable range of i-CHROMA iFOB is 25.00–1000.00 ng/mL

(hemoglobin in the human fecal sample processed with i-CHROMA iFOB Detection
Buffer).
Prozone (Hook Effect)
Susceptibility of i-CHROMA iFOB to prozone effect was evaluated by testing 20
replicates of hemoglobin-negative stool samples spiked with human blood (with
known hemoglobin level) to obtain fecal samples containing 14 different hemoglobin
concentrations 700 ng/mL up to 2000 ng/mL.
i-CHROMA iFOB was not found susceptible to prozone/hook effect as it would
display positive test results with fecal samples containing hemoglobin concentration
up to 2000 ng/mL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i-CHROMA iFOB Test as well as the Controls are traceable to the IRMM/IFCC-467
Human Hemoglobin Reference Standard and OC-Standard V-IX50.
Internal Control: Procedural controls are included in the test device. The control line
serves as an internal procedural control, indicating that the test system is functioning
correctly and that the operator added a sufficient volume of sample.
External Quality Control: i-CHROMA iFOB Negative & Positive Controls are
available in a separate control kit. The negative and positive controls are run in the
iFOB Test in the same manner as an extracted fecal sample. It is recommended that
positive and negative controls be performed to verify proper test performance.
Stability Studies
1. Stability of fecal samples
a. Collected in i-CHROMA iFOB Sample Collection Tubes: Samples for
stability testing were prepared by spiking stool samples with human blood
(with known hemoglobin level) to obtain fecal samples containing six
different hemoglobin concentrations: 50 ng/mL, 75 ng/mL, 90 ng/mL, 110
ng/mL, 125 ng/mL and 150 ng/mL. Each spiked sample was mixed with
detection buffer in 10 i-CHROMA iFOB sample collection tubes.
Six sets, each of 10 sample collection tubes (containing fecal samples spiked
with the same level of hemoglobin) were individually enclosed in sample sacs,
sealed in return envelopes and stored 4°C, 25°C, 37°C and 45°C for 120
hours/five days immediately after sampling. Each sample was tested with i-
CHROMA iFOB initially (at 0 hour) and daily thereafter at time intervals: 24,
48, 72, 96 and 120 hours.
i-CHROMA iFOB ‘Negative and Positive Controls’ were also tested daily to
ensure and confirm the validity of the test results of the stability study.
Fecal samples submitted by the patient in i-CHROMA iFOB sample
collection tube should be tested before 72 hours after sampling if stored at 4ºC
(2~8ºC/35.6~46.4ºF) and before 48 hours after sampling if stored at ambient
temperature not exceeding 37ºC/98.6ºF.
8

--- Page 9 ---
b. Not collected in i-CHROMA iFOB Sample Collection Tubes: For fecal
samples that are collected in a container other than the sample collection tubes
provided with the i-CHROMA iFOB kit, the samples have to be transferred
into the i-CHROMA iFOB CollectionTubes before testing. The following
study was performed to determine the maximum allowable time after
sampling for testing:
Samples for stability testing were prepared by spiking stool with human blood
(with known hemoglobin level) to obtain fecal samples containing six
different hemoglobin concentrations: 50 ng/mL, 75 ng/mL, 90 ng/mL, 110
ng/mL, 125 ng/mL and 150 ng/mL.
Separate specimen cups containing the spiked fecal samples were stored 4°C,
25°C, 37°C and 45°C for 120 hours/five days immediately after
spiking/preparation.
Each test sample was tested with i-CHROMA iFOB initially (at 0 hour) and
daily thereafter at time intervals: 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours.
i-CHROMA iFOB ‘Negative and Positive Controls’ were also tested daily to
ensure and confirm the validity of the test results of the stability study.
Fecal samples submitted by the patient in a specimen cup should be tested
before 72 hours after sampling if stored at 4ºC (2~8ºC/35.6~46.4ºF) and
before 24 hours after sampling if stored at ambient temperature not exceeding
37ºC/98.6ºF.
2. i-CHROMA iFOB Controls Stability Study: Vials of three different lots of i-
CHROMA iFOB ‘Negative’ and ‘Positive’ Controls were stored in sealed
conditions at 2°C, 8°C and 25°C and used for stability testing over a period of 10
months. To demonstrate stability of the controls, i-CHROMA iFOB test
cartridges (stored at 4~30°C) and i-CHROMA iFOB sample collection tubes
(stored at 2~8°C in refrigerator) of matching lot number were used throughout the
study period.
i-CHROMA iFOB controls from each lot stored at each of the three temperatures
were tested initially at the start of the stability study (0 month) as well as every
month (i.e. 29~31 days) thereafter over the period of 10 months.
For evaluating shelf-life stability, separate vials (of each lot) of the controls were
used for each periodic testing. A vial once used for the initial or previous testing
was not re-used for any successive periodic testing.
For evaluating open-vial stability, the same control vial was used for the initial as
well as all successive periodic testing. Periodic/monthly i-CHROMA iFOB test
results of the stored ‘Negative’ and ‘Positive’ controls were compared with the
initial test results of corresponding vial/lot (i.e. at 0 month).
The i-CHROMA iFOB ‘Negative’ as well as ‘Positive’ Controls have a closed-
vial stability of three months and open vial stability of one month under the
recommended storage conditions of 2ºC~8ºC in a refrigerator.
d. Detection limit:
9

--- Page 10 ---
Control material was used as test samples for determining the limit of detection of i-
CHROMA iFOB. Sixteen (16) levels of human hemoglobin A0 (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35,
40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, and 120 ng/mL) were tested. Nine replicates of test
samples at each of the above analyte levels were tested in a single run by the same
operator using same lot of test components and same instrument at the same testing site
on the same day. Numerical values of test results of the nine replicates at each analyte
level were statistically analyzed to calculate the mean, standard deviation and coefficient
of variation (% CV). The lowest concentration of analyte showing coefficient of
variation below 10% was considered as the limit of detection. Accordingly the lower
limit of detection was found to be 25 ng/mL (with 95% confidence interval 70.08~100).
e. Analytical specificity:
Sensitivity to human hemoglobin variant
Sensitivity of i-CHROMA iFOB to ‘Hemoglobin S’ as the human hemoglobin variant
associated with sickle cell anemia was evaluated by testing 20 replicates of fecal
samples spiked with blood of a sickle cell anemia patient to obtain test samples with
five different concentrations of ‘Hemoglobin S’ (50 ng/mL, 85 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL,
115 ng/mL & 150 ng/mL). i-CHROMA iFOB was found to be equally sensitive to
‘Hemoglobin S’ as the human hemoglobin variant associated with sickle cell anemia.
Cross-Reactivity
Cross-reactivity of i-CHROMA iFOB with animal hemoglobin was evaluated by
testing 20 replicates of hemoglobin-negative stool spiked with the intended level of
respective animal hemoglobin such as bovine (2000 μg/mL), chicken (500 μg/mL),
fish (100 μg/mL), horse/equine (500 μg/mL), goat (500 μg/mL), pig/swine (500
μg/mL), rabbit (500 μg/mL) and sheep (500 μg/mL). i-CHROMA iFOB did not show
significant cross-reactivity with any of the animal hemoglobin tested.
Interfering Substances
Susceptibility of i-CHROMA iFOB to interference from endogenous substances was
evaluated by testing 20 replicates of fecal samples spiked with human blood to obtain
samples with 0 ng/mL, 50 ng/mL, 85 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, 115 ng/mL and 150 ng/mL
concentrations of human hemoglobin and further spiking them with solutions
containing intended concentrations of four endogenous substances: ascorbic acid (30
μg/mL), bilirubin (200 μg/mL), albumin (60 mg/mL) and myoglobin (2000 μg/mL).
i-CHROMA iFOB did not show significant interference from any of the four
endogenous substances tested.
f. Assay cut-off:
Analytical characterization of cut-off of the i-CHROMA iFOB involved testing of
219 human fecal samples comprising 125 normal/negative samples and 94 positive
samples as confirmed with the predicate test OC Auto Micro FOB.
Test results were statistically analyzed by Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC)
Analysis and analyte concentration corresponding to maximum sensitivity as well as
maximum specificity of i-CHROMA iFOB was taken as the cut-off.

Cut-off of i-CHROMA iFOB was determined to be 100 ng/mL (hemoglobin in fecal
sample mixed with detection buffer).
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Due to administrative error, the following section in quotations was previously
redacted:
“A clinical method comparison of i-CHROMA iFOB with the predicate test, OC
Auto Micro FOB, was evaluated by testing fecal samples obtained from 134 patients
(68 males and 66 females above the age of 50 years). Test samples were tested first
with the ‘i-CHROMA iFOB’. The test samples were then tested with the
comparator/predicate method ‘OC Auto Micro FOB’.”
A method comparison of i-CHROMA iFOB with the predicate test, OC Auto Micro
FOB, was evaluated by testing spiked fecal samples at three intended use sites in the
US. Test samples were prepared by spiking hemoglobin negative stool with human
blood (with known hemoglobin level) to obtain fecal samples containing seven
different hemoglobin concentrations: 50 ng/mL, 85 ng/mL, 90 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL,
110 ng/mL, 115 ng/mL and 1000 ng/mL. 20 aliquots of each spiked sample were
tested with i-CHROMA iFOB at each testing site and then with the predicate test OC
Auto Micro FOB. No invalid or indeterminate results were obtained throughout the
analytical method comparison study. Statistical analysis of site-wise test results as
well as combined results shows that i-CHROMA iFOB test results have acceptable
overall percent agreement as well as positive percent agreement and negative percent
agreement with OC Auto Micro FOB test results.

3. Specimen Identification:
Enter Patient Identification Information manually on the label of i-CHROMA iFOB
Sample Collection Tube.
e. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
It is recommended that the laboratory should give the i-CHROMA iFOB Sample
Collection Tube to the patient so that the patient can collect fecal sample and do the
sampling himself/herself and submit it to the laboratory for testing as per the appropriate
instructions received from the laboratory.
The laboratory may also receive fecal samples which have been collected and submitted
in specimen cups or similar containers by the patients. Such fecal samples may be stored
at ambient temperature (up to 37ºC) but must be processed (with detection buffer in the
sample collection tube) and tested within 48 hours after collection. Fecal sample
submitted by the patient in i-CHROMA iFOB sample collection tube should be tested
before 72 hours after sampling if stored at 4ºC (2~8ºC/35.6~46.4ºF) and before 48 hours
after sampling if stored at ambient temperature not exceeding 37º C/98.6ºF.
5. Calibration:
i-CHROMA iFOB ID chip (supplied in the test cartridge box) contains a memory device
that contains encoded calibration data/information for the batch-to-batch (lot-to-lot)
variation. With the ID chip inserted in the designated port, i-CHROMA Reader reads and
utilizes the calibration data regarding the batch/lot under consideration and applies
appropriate correction to the conversion formula while computing the test result.
6. Quality Control:
