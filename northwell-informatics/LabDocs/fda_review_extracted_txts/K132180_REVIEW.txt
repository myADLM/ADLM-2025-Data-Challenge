L. Test Principle:
IDEAL LIFE GlucoManager GMM 0002 Blood Glucose Monitoring System measures the
amount of sugar (glucose) in whole blood. The glucose testing is based on the measurement
of electrical current generated by the reaction of glucose with the reagent of the strip. The
meter measures the current, calculates the blood glucose level, and displays the result. The
strength of the current produced by the reaction depends on the amount of glucose in the
blood sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable): All performance characteristics were
conducted on the IDEAL LIFE GlucoManager, Model GMM0002 with the IDEAL LIFE test
strips model AGS-1112.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility
:
Venous blood spiked with five different glucose concentrations (30-50, 51-110, 111-
150, 151-250, and 251-400mg/dL) was tested on three lots of test strips on 10 meters.
Ten replicates were tested per meter, test strip lot and glucose concentration for a
total of 100 replicates. Results are summarized below:
With-in day Precision:
Glucose level Mean SD CV
(mg/dL) (mg/dL) (mg/dL) (%)
30-50 31.5 2.4 7.50
51-110 105.6 3.9 3.73
111-150 121.7 4.6 3.74
151-250 182.8 7.0 3.85
251-400 263 10.2 3.86
In addition to the study above, the sponsor also evaluated day-to-day precision using
three control solutions with three concentrations of glucose (30-50, 96-144, 280-
420mg/dL). Reproducibility was evaluated over a ten day period with three lots of
test strips and 10 meters. Results are summarized below:

Level 3
345.2 13.3 3.86
280-420mg/dL
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The claimed measuring range for this device is 20-600 mg/dL. The sponsor
performed linearity studies using venous whole blood samples with 11 different
glucose concentration levels covering the full measuring range (20.5, 39.2, 99.4,
160.1, 224.5, 273.7, 348.6, 420.8, 505.3, 570.6, 599.6mg/dL). Measurements were
taken 5 times for each level and the values were compared to YSI. Linear regression
analysis is summarized below:
Y=0.9948x+2.6936; R2=0.9984
The results support the claimed measuring range of 20-600mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The IDEAL LIFE GlucoManager GMM0002 Blood Glucose Monitoring System is
traceable to NIST reference standard reference material (SRM) 965b.
Stability:
Test strip stability was assessed with accelerated studies, in-use and on-going real
time studies. For unopened vial stability, accelerated testing of the test strips was
performed and real-time testing is ongoing to confirm the accelerated results. Testing
support the claimed unopened vial storage of 18 months when stored at 39°F to 86°F
(4°C to 30°C) with relative humidity 10-85% and a 90 day stability after opening
when stored at 39°C to 86°F (4°C to 30°C) with relative humidity 10-85%.
The stability of the control solution was established in k110017. The claimed
stability is 24 months when stored at 39°F-86° and 90 day stability after opening
when stored at 39°F-86°F.
Value assignment:
The IDEAL LIFE Control Solution, Model: GCS 0104 (Level I, Level II, Level III)
value assignment was established using ten GMM0002 glucose meters and a single
lot of AGS-1112 blood glucose test strips. Each level of control solution was tested
100 times by the GMM0002 system. The control range for each control solution is
listed on the test strip vial. The control ranges on the label are within ±20% of the

User Performance Study:
The lay user study was conducted following ISO 15197. To assess the performance
of the GMM0002 in the hands of the intended users, the sponsor performed a study
with 100 lay users. The study was performed at four sites. The subjects were
provided the product instructions for use but not given any additional instructions.
Each subject performed finger stick and alternative sites (palm, forearm, upper arm,
calf, and thigh) testing on their own. After the users self-test, the HCP measured the
user’s fingerstick and AST capillary blood on the GMM0002 system and a second
sample was measured on the YSI 2300. The range of glucose values for the samples
measured by the reference method was 55-339mg/dL. Results are summarized

(cid:51)
(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Altitude Study
An altitude study was performed in three altitude simulation chambers set at sea level,
3,280ft (1000m), 6,561ft (2000m), and 10,744ft (3275m) with 20 venous whole blood
samples with glucose concentrations ranging from 56.5 to 438mg/dL. Each sample was
tested with four meters and one test strip lot and the results were compared to YSI. The
results demonstrate acceptable bias to the reference to support the claims in the labeling
that altitudes up to 10,744 feet have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements
from the IDEAL LIFE GlucoManager GMM0002 Monitoring System.
2. Hematocrit Study
The effect of different hematocrit levels were evaluated using venous whole blood
samples with hematocrit levels of 20-60% (20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60%) spiked
with five glucose concentrations (22.6, 76.5, 152, 256, 354, 453, 596mg/dL) distributed
across the measuring range. The samples were tested with three meters and one lot of
11

--- Page 12 ---
test strips. The results were compared to YSI and the normal 40% hematocrit. The
percent bias of the IDEAL LIFE GlucoManager GMM0002 meter results relative to YSI
demonstrated adequate performance to support the claimed hematocrit range of 20-60%.
3. Sample volume
A minimum sample volume study was performed using seven venous whole blood
samples with glucose concentrations ranging from 46.5mg/dL to 455mg/dL to evaluate
effect of different sample volumes (0.5uL, 0.6uL, 0.7uL, 1.0uL, 2.0uL) on the
performance of the device. Results at each sample volume were compared to the
corresponding YSI values. Results from these studies support the claimed minimum
sample volume of 0.7uL.
4. Infection Control Studies
The IDEAL Life GlucoManager GMM0002 is intended for single patient use.
Disinfection efficacy was established in k110017. Robustness studies were performed by
the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials
of the meter and landing device after 11,000 pre-cleanings and 11,000 disinfection steps
with the Cavi WipesTM (EPA Registration # 46781-8). The robustness studies were
designed to simulate 5 years of single patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate
instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
5. Temperature and Humidity Studies
Temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated using three GMM0002
meters and one lot of test strips with fresh venous whole blood samples at three glucose
levels (low, normal, high) for temperatures ranging from 50 °F to 104°F (10°C to 40°C)
and relative humidity from 25% to 80% including extreme conditions of temperature and
humidity, e.g. lowest humidity with lowest and highest temperature and highest humidity
with lowest and highest temperature. Protocol and acceptance criteria were provided and
found to be acceptable. The results supported the sponsor’s claimed operating
temperature from 50°F to 104°F and relative humidity range from 25%- 80%.
6. EMC testing
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electromagnetic testing
(EMC) had been performed.
7. Readability Assessment
A SMOG reading level assessment was conducted of the GlucoManager GMM0002
instructions for use and the quick installation guide was assessed, giving a readability
grade level of 7.5 and 7.8 respectively. Test strip and Control solution instruction for use
were assessed with a readability level of 7.7 and 7.2 respectively.
8. Data Transmission
IDEAL LIFE GlucoManager GMM0002 Blood Glucose monitoring system has a
Bluetooth function. The sponsor performed the following test scripts:
12

--- Page 13 ---
Test scripts for Gateway Application and GlucoManager GMM0002
This test script is to ensure that the IDEAL LIFE GlucoManager GMM0002 will be able
to correctly send readings via the IDEAL Life Gateway Application to IDEAL LIFE
Cloud. The acceptance criteria are that readings shall be saved on the Ideal Life DB with
the correct values. Five tests were performed with the IDEAL LIFE GlucoManager
GMM0002 via IDEAL LIFE Gateway Application. All executed test cases have the status
of PASS.
No Data Lost between Gateway Application and Manager Device
This test script is to ensure that IDEAL LIFE Managers, including the GlucoManager, will
be able to store reading data in their memory and there will be no data loss if Gateway
Application fails to transmit readings to IDEAL LIFE Cloud. One test case for each
Manager type was performed. All executed test cases have the status of PASS.
9. Software: The sponsor provided the results of the device software testing including a
traceability analysis, validation and verification testing which were reviewed and found to
be adequate.
10. Human Factors testing:
A usability test was conducted with twenty-two (22) users of varied computer skill
between 18-80 years old. Each user was provided with an IDEAL LIFE GlucoManager
GMM0002 and given instructions to upload the Gateway application according to the
instructions for use, to measure glucose levels with control solutions and to upload data to
the website. Users were asked to complete a survey about the ease of use of the device
and software. The positive response to this user test indicates that there are no areas of
concern about the usability of the device by the intended users.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
