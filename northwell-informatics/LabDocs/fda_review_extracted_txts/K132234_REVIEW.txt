I. Device Description:
The method for qualitative determination of IgG antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii (anti-Toxo
IgG) is an indirect chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA). All assay steps (with the
exception of magnetic particle resuspension) and incubations are performed by the
LIAISON® XL Analyzer. The principal components of the test are magnetic particles (solid
phase) coated with Toxoplasma gondii and a conjugate of mouse monoclonal antibodies to
human IgG linked to an isoluminol derivative (isoluminol-antibody conjugate). During the
first incubation, Toxoplasma gondii antibodies present in diluted calibrators, samples or
controls bind to the solid phase. During the second incubation, the monoclonal antibody
conjugate reacts with anti-Toxo IgG that is already bound to the solid phase. After each
incubation, the unbound material is removed with a wash cycle. Subsequently, the starter
reagents are added and a flash chemiluminescence reaction is thus induced. The light signal,
and therefore, the amount of isoluminol-antibody conjugate, is measured by a
photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) and is indicative of the presence of anti-Toxo
IgG in calibrators, samples or controls.

L. Test Principle:
This test is a Chemiluminescence Immunoassay (CLIA) – Immunoassay technology based
on the emission of light as a result of a chemical reaction. During the first incubation,
Toxoplasma gondii antibodies present in diluted calibrators, samples or controls bind to the
solid phase. During the second incubation, the monoclonal antibody conjugate reacts with
anti-Toxo IgG that is already bound to the solid phase. After each of the incubations,
unbound material is removed with a wash cycle. Subsequently, the starter reagents are
added and a flash chemiluminescence reaction is thus induced. The light signal, and
therefore, the amount of isoluminol-antibody conjugate, is measured by a photomultiplier as
RLUs and is indicative of the presence of anti-Toxo IgG in calibrators, samples or controls.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:

spiked with the respective interferent. Acceptance criteria were defined as the %
change in signal must not be more than +/- 10% and not change the qualitative result.
No interference was found at the concentration for each substance listed below in the
LIAISON® Toxo IgG ll assay. The testing was based on CLSI-EP07-A2.

f. Assay cut-off:
The cutoff for the LIAISON® Toxo IgG ll assay was set at an International Unit
value of 8.8 IU/mL based on European studies by testing 1000 subjects from
different populations. The samples were tested in parallel with the LIAISON® Toxo
IgG II assay and CE marked comparison methods. Consensus between the methods
as well as the available clinical and serological data was applied to define the
expected results. The assay cut-off was validated in the United States during clinical
studies by testing a prospective population of 804 samples from individuals sent to
the laboratory for Toxoplasma gondii testing and 202 pregnant women. Ten samples
resulted in an equivocal interpretation on the comparator test and therefore, were not
used in analysis. Based on the comparison studies this cutoff is appropriate for the
LIAISON® Toxo IgG II assay. In the LIAISON® Toxo IgG II assay, a sample is
defined as positive if the International Unit value is greater than or equal to 8.8
IU/mL, and defined as negative if the International Unit value is less than 7.2
IU/mL. Samples with results greater than or equal to 7.2 IU/mL and less than 8.8
IU/mL are classified as equivocal.

Comparative testing
Prospective and retrospective studies were performed to compare the performance of
the LIAISON® Toxo IgG II assay to an FDA-cleared predicate device.
The prospective study consisted of 804 samples (204 samples from US subjects, 600
samples from European subjects) from individuals who were sent to the laboratory
for Toxoplasma gondii testing and 202 pregnant women.
The retrospective study consisted of 42 samples selected from individuals who had a
positive Toxoplasma gondii IgG result by the predicate device.
Interpretation of Results:
Index Results Interpretation
< 7.2 IU/mL Negative Absence of detectable Toxoplasma gondii IgG antibodies. A
negative result does not always rule out acute infection. The test
usually scores negative in infected people during the incubation
period and the early stages of infection. If exposure to
toxoplasma gondii is suspected despite a negative finding, a
second sample should be collected and tested one or two weeks
later.
≥ 7.2 IU/mL - < 8.8 IU/mL Equivocal The equivocal sample should be repeat tested. If the result remains
in this range after repeat testing, a second sample should be collected
and tested no less than one or two weeks later..
≥ 8.8 IU/mL Positive Presence of detectable Toxoplasma gondii IgG antibodies.
A positive result generally indicates either recent or past
exposure to the pathogen. If IgG test scores positive in the
presence of IgM antibodies, recent infection may be postulated.
If IgG test scored positive in the absence of IgM antibodies, past
infection my be postulated.

N. Instrument Name:
LIAISON® XL Analyzer
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The method for qualitative determination of IgG antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii (anti-
Toxo IgG) is an indirect chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA). The principal
components of the test are magnetic particles (solid phase) coated with Toxoplasma
gondii and a conjugate of mouse monoclonal antibodies to human IgG linked to an
isoluminol derivative (isoluminol-antibody conjugate). During the first
incubation,Toxoplasma gondii antibodies present in diluted calibrators, samples or
controls bind to the solid phase. During the second incubation, the monoclonal antibody

--- Page 15 ---
conjugate reacts with anti-Toxo IgG that is already bound to the solid phase. After each
incubation, unbound material is removed with a wash cycle. Subsequently, the starter
reagents are added and a flash chemiluminescence reaction is thus induced. The light
signal, and therefore, the amount of isoluminol-antibody conjugate, is measured by a
photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) and is indicative of the presence of anti-
Toxo IgG in calibrators, samples or controls.
All assay steps and incubations are performed by the LIAISON® XL Analyzer.

3. Specimen Identification:
Not Applicable
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Not Applicable
5. Calibration:
DiaSorin's LIAISON® Toxo IgG II assay generates a continuous response (relative light
units, RLU) which is used in sample grading to provide a qualitative (positive, negative,
or equivocal) reportable result. The sample grading is based on a calibration
curve referenced to National Standard Serum for Toxoplasmosis E6 (National Health
Laboratory, France, 1987), standardized against WHO 2nd International Standard (1980)
Reference preparation. Typical dose-response curve of any assay kit lot is described by a
dedicated master curve.
The two calibrators in the kit are assayed by the user to transform the kit lot specific
Master Curve into a Working Curve, describing the testing conditions specific for the
given testing session. From the working curve, doses for the unknown samples are
calculated. For each lot, the Master Curve is stored in the Radio Frequency Identification
transponder (RFID Tag) of the Reagent Integral. Master curve is defined for each lot
during the quality control of the batch. In the same process, calibrators are checked for
compliance with expected concentration and adjusted if not compliant. In the same
testing session actual titer is assessed. A final trimming of the titer is then achieved
targeting established reference doses of the Quality Control Panel. Calibrator 1 is
manufactured targeting a concentration between 10-20 IU/mL. Calibrator 2 is
manufactured targeting a concentration between 200-400 IU/mL. Calibrators are
manufactured from serum or defibrinated plasma units at a proper concentration of IgG
anti-Toxoplasma, and then diluted in buffer to reach desired titer.

--- Page 16 ---
In five different experiments, a calibration panel, batch calibrators and a quality control
panel are assayed in order to define the master curve and titration of the calibrators:
1. Calibration panel determines the working curve of each of the five experiments and
allows the calculation of the doses associated to the batch calibrators;
2. Doses of the batch calibrators are assessed in respect to the target range.
Calibrators are corrected by dilution or concentration as needed;
3. From the five working curve a master curve for the specific batch is calculated;
4. Doses of the calibrators are used to calculate results for the quality control panel
from the defined master curve: a fine trimming of the calibrator’s dose is possible
in order to optimize response on the quality control panel in respect to reference
established ranges.
The calibration panel is made of two major components:
1. A Full Standardization Curve: Full Standardization Curve is obtained as an
Internal Standard Curve from a pool of human serum and/or defibrinated plasma
at high titer, serially diluted in a negative and/or defibrinated plasma pool. It is
calibrated versus an Internal Primary Standard Curve, in turn referenced to the
National Standard Serum for Toxoplasmosis E6 (National Health Laboratory,
France, 1987) Primary Curve. This is obtained by direct reconstitution and
dilution of the E6 Standard;
2. An accuracy panel: a set of samples at various doses along the assay range.
Reference established doses of members of the accuracy panel are defined in a
specific qualification session.
The Calibration panel is used to determine the typical dose-response curve of the assay
accounting for the behavior of both the reference standard and true specimens.
The analyzer is calibrated in triplicate whenever one of the following conditions occurs
(see LIAISON® XL Analyzer Operator’s manual):
· A new lot of Reagent Integral or a new lot of Starter Kit is used.
· The previous calibration was performed more than four weeks before
· The analyzer has been serviced.
· Control values fall outside the expected ranges.
Calibrators and controls are manufactured separately. Raw material segregation is
also maintained by the use of different part numbers for the stock solutions intended to
manufacture the calibrators and controls.
6. Quality Control:
The LIAISON® Control Toxo IgG II ([REF] 310706) is recommended for the
determination of quality control requirements for this assay and should be run in
singlicate to monitor the assay performance. Quality control is recommended once per

--- Page 17 ---
day of use, or in accordance with local, state, and/or federal regulations or accreditation
requirements and your laboratory’s quality control procedures. It is recommended the
user refer to CLSI document C24-A3 and 42 CFR 493.1256(c) for guidance on
appropriate quality control practices.
The range of concentrations of each control is reported on the certificate of analysis and
indicates the limits established by DiaSorin for control values that can be obtained in
reliable assay runs. The performance of other controls should be evaluated for
compatibility with this assay before they are used. Appropriate value ranges should be
established for all quality control materials used. Quality control could be performed by
running the LIAISON® Control Toxo IgG II sera or dedicated commercial controls:
· at least once per day of use,
· whenever the kit is calibrated,
· whenever a new lot of Starter Reagents is used,
Control values must be within the expected ranges: whenever one of the controls results
fall outside the expected ranges, calibration should be repeated and controls retested. If
control values obtained after successful calibration fall repeatedly outside the predefined
ranges, the test should be repeated using an unopened control vial. If the control values
fall outside the expected ranges, patient results must not be reported.
