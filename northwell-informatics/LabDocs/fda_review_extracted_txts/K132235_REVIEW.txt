Abbott m2000rt: amplification reaction and detection
I. Device Description:
The IMDx C. difficile for Abbott m2000 assay is a qualitative, real-time PCR-based assay
that targets the genes tcdA and tcdB; these genes are associated toxigenic strains of C.
difficile. These toxin A and B genes can be found in human liquid or soft stool specimens
from patients with symptoms of C. difficile associated disease. The assay is intended for use
directly on patient samples and is intended to aid in the diagnosis of C. difficile-associated
disease. Specimen preparation and reagent mixing occurs on the Abbott m2000sp
instrument, while amplification and detection occurs on the Abbott m2000rt instrument. The
Abbott m2000rt application software monitors the fluorescence emitted by each fluorescent
probe, interprets all data, and provides a final result at the end of the cycling program.
Differentiation of tcdA from tcdB is achieved by labeling the oligonucleotide probes with
different colored fluorescent dyes. Assay results are reported as either the presence or
absence of the tcdA and/or tcdB targets
A specimen processing control is introduced into each specimen during the sample
extraction. This control is composed of an inactivated Gram-positive bacterium unrelated
toxigenic C. difficile that is introduced in a defined quantity into each sample during
processing; it is co-extracted with the specimen and co-amplified in the same PCR reaction
as the tcdA and tcdB targets and serves to demonstrate that the entire assay process has
proceeded within specification. Positive and negative controls are included with each run to
ensure the integrity of the system.

oligonucleotide probes with different colored fluorescent dyes. The IMDx C. difficile for
Abbott m2000 assay includes inactivated bacteria as a full process control; this inactivated
bacterium is unrelated to C. difficile and introduced into each specimen during sample
preparation such that it is co-extracted and co-amplified with each specimen. This full
process control serves to demonstrate that the entire assay process has proceeded within
specification for individual specimens. The Abbott m2000 system consists of two
instruments: the Abbott m2000sp (for sample preparation) and the Abbott m2000rt (for real-
time PCR amplification and detection). The assay is intended to be used directly on fresh
(i.e., unpreserved), or Cary-Blair preserved stool specimens collected from patients to aid in
the diagnosis of Clostridium difficile infection.
Fresh/raw or Cary-Blair preserved stool specimens are initially subjected to sample
preparation on the Abbott m2000sp, an automated sample preparation system. Sample
preparation lyses bacteria present in the sample, including any toxigenic C. difficile, to make
the tcdA and tcdB target nucleic acids accessible for amplification and to remove potential
amplification inhibitors. At the completion of the sample processing procedure, the resulting
bacterial lysate is transferred to an Abbott 96-Deep-Well. The Abbott m2000sp also
combines the IMDx C. difficile for Abbott m2000 Amplification Reagent components and
dispenses the resulting Master Mix into the Abbott 96-Well Optical Reaction Plate. After
manual application of the Abbott Optical Adhesive Cover, the plate is ready for transfer to
the Abbott m2000rt.
Amplification/detection takes place on the Abbott m2000rt instrument using real-time PCR
techniques; during each round of PCR amplification the fluorescent probes anneal to the
amplified target DNA, if present. The probes are labeled with different fluorescent
molecules allowing tcdA, tcdB and the IMDx Process Control-A targets to be distinguished
from each other. The probes are single-stranded, linear DNA oligonucleotides modified with
a fluorescent moiety covalently linked to one end of the probe and a quenching moiety to the
other end. When the probe binds to its complementary sequence in the target during
amplification, the fluorophore separates from the quenchers, thus allowing fluorescent
emission and detection. Since this fluorescence occurs during every cycle, the PCR reaction
can be read in real-time. Positive and negative controls are included with each run to ensure
the integrity of the system.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Assay precision was measured in four independent studies:
· user-to-user reproducibility;
· lot-to-lot reproducibility;
· instrument-to-instrument reproducibility, and
· within-laboratory repeatability.

A seven-member precision panel was comprised of intact organisms from two strains
of C. difficile: a NAP-1 strain (ATCC BAA-1870), and the tcdB-variant 1470 (ATCC
43598). Each strain was formulated at three target levels:
i. positive (corresponding to a concentration associated with ~2-3x LoD),
ii. low positive (1x LoD), and
iii. high negative (~0.05 x LoD, estimated to have a 20 to 80% positivity rate).
Panel members were made fecal matrix buffer to simulate clinical specimens. The
seventh panel member was a true negative sample that contained TE Buffer plus fecal
matrix alone, without C. difficile organism added.
Site-to-Site Reproducibility
For the reproducibility study the panel members were randomized and blinded. Each
panel member was tested in replicates of three, for six days, at three study sites, by
two technologists at each site for a total of 36 experimental runs; each operator
performed one run each day. The entire study was conducted using one instrument
system (m2000sp and m2000rt) at each site and one reagent lot of the IMDx C.
difficile for Abbott m2000 assay. The results and percent agreement (observed/tested)
at each site, as well as the overall agreement were reported as follows:

Instrument-to-Instrument Reproducibility
Instrument-to-instrument reproducibility was determined independently for both the
Abbott m2000sp and m2000rt instruments. To measure m2000sp instrument
variability, the test panel was run on three different m2000sp instruments. Panel
members were run in replicates of six. Runs were performed in succession by the
same operator, using a single IMDx C. difficile for Abbott m2000 assay lot. Once the
master mix assembly portion of the protocol was executed by the different m2000sp
instruments, the assembled reaction plates were run using a single m2000rt
instrument. The expected results and percent agreement at each site, as well as the
overall agreement were reported as follows:

*Of the 126 samples tested, one ATCC BAA-1870 sample was invalidated due to an instrument error and was
withdrawn from the study. The overall invalid rate was <1%.
To measure m2000rt variability, a single m2000sp instrument was used in one
experiment. Six replicates of each panel member were prepared. The eluted nucleic
acids from the sample extractions were automatically transferred to an Abbott 96-
well Deep Well Plate by the m2000sp per normal operational procedures. Aliquots
from one deep well plate were then used to assemble three separate, identical Abbott
96-well Optical Reaction Plates, using the same lot of the IMDx C. difficile for
Abbott m2000 assay. Each of the three identical Abbott 96-Well Optical Reaction
plates were then run on three separate Abbott m2000rt instruments, by the same
operator. The expected results and percent agreement at each site, as well as the
overall agreement were reported as follows:

Negative samples showed an overall negativity rate of 100%; no false positive results
were observed. High Negative samples were expected to provide a negativity rate of
20–80%; the observed negativity rate was 81.2%, and 84.1% for the ATCC BAA-
1870 and ATCC 43598 strains, respectively. Low Positive samples were expected to
provide a positivity rate of ≥95%; the observed positivity rate was 98%. Positive
samples were expected to provide a positivity rate of 100%; the observed positivity
rate was 100%. There were 11 instrument errors out of the 1,136 samples tested in
these studies (<1%).
Within-Laboratory Repeatability
For the repeatability study, the seven-member panel was tested twice a day for a total
of 12 days. Panel members were tested in replicates of three for each run (for a total
of 504 data points for the 24 runs). The entire study was conducted by one technician
using one instrument pair (m2000sp and m2000rt) and one reagent lot of the IMDx C.
difficile for Abbott m2000 assay.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The IMDx Process Control-A is composed of inactivated Gram-positive bacteria
unrelated to C. difficle and is introduced into each sample during specimen
processing; therefore, an IMDx Process Control-A result is generated with each
specimen result. Positive and negative Quality Controls are run with each IMDx C.
difficile for Abbott m2000 assay run.
There were a total of 5,722 replicates run during analytical verification; a total of 56
(0.98%) errors were observed. Of these 56 errors, 54 were due to instrument failures.
There were a total 1,583 evaluable specimens in the clinical study, and 1,718 assay
results were generated during testing (including both initial and repeat runs). The
reported overall error rate during the clinical study was 3.4% (59/1,718); the majority
of these (>82% [47/59]) were due to IMDx Process Control-A (i.e., the internal
control) failures. Assay Positive and Negative Controls were tested with each assay
run during the trial. Throughout the course of the study there were a total of 90 runs
performed; only three runs failed due to quality control failures (in two of these three
runs both the positive and negative controls failed). Therefore, the overall QC run-
failure rate was 3.3% (3/90), while the total QC failure rate was 0.3% (5/1,718). The
remaining failures (0.5%) were due to instrument issues (7/1,718). Eighteen (18)
samples yielded an unresolved error message after repeat testing and were eventually
categorized as “Invalid.” The rate of failure was not excessive; the assay control
strategy adequately evaluated the integrity of the result.

Specimen Stability Studies
The following specimen types were tested:
· Unpreserved (fresh/raw) stool
· Cary-Blair preserved stool
The data provided support that each specimen type was stable when stored under
the following conditions:
· Unpreserved (fresh/raw) stool:
o 7 days at 2°C to 8°C.
o 60 days at -30°C to -10°C.
· Cary-Blair preserved stool:
o 4 days at 2°C to 8°C.
o 60 days at -30°C to -10°C.
· Specimens (both unpreserved and preserved) were stable for one (1) freeze
thaw cycle.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) of the IMDx C. difficile for Abbott m2000 assay was
determined using three strains of toxigenic C. difficile. These included VPI10463
(ATCC 43255, toxinotype 0), 1470 (ATCC 43598, toxinotype VIII, tcdB-variant),
and 4118 (ATCC BAA-1870, toxinotype III, BI/NAP1/027). A range finding study
was initially performed, and then six serial 2-fold dilutions around the appropriate
concentration were tested. A total of 60 replicates of each dilution were tested to
determine the LoD of raw/fresh stool, whereas a total of 20 replicates were tested to
determine the LoD of Cary-Blair preserved stool specimens. All dilutions were
confirmed by colony counting, and three lots of the IMDx C. difficile for Abbott
m2000 assay were used in the raw/fresh LoD determinations (20 replicates for each
lot). The concentration of each strain at which ≥95% of the replicates was detected is
as follows:
Strain Raw/Fresh Stool Cary-Blair Preserved Stool
ATCC 43255 337 CFU/mL 463 CFU/mL
ATCC 43598 256CFU/mL 861 CFU/mL
ATCC BAA 1870 67 CFU/mL 134 CFU/mL
The LoD for fresh/raw stool specimens was determined to be:
· 337 CFU/mL.
The LoD for Cary-Blair preserved stool specimens was determined to be:
· 861 CFU/mL.

Analytical Reactivity
Thirty-one (31) C. difficile strains and/or clinical isolates were tested for reactivity
with the IMDx C. difficile for Abbott m2000 assay. Strains were reported to originate
from at least nine states and four countries (USA, UK, Belgium, and Switzerland); 11
toxinotypes were represented (0, II, III, IV, V, VIII, IX, X, XII, XXI, and XXII).
Each strain was diluted in buffer plus fecal matrix at 2-3X LoD; three replicates were
tested. All strains were detected by the assay, demonstrating that the IMDx C.
difficile Assay for Abbott m2000 can detect a broad range of toxinotypes.

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross reactivity was performed using a panel of 120 test organisms to evaluate any
cross-reactivity with the IMDx C. difficile for Abbott m2000 assay. Bacteria were
obtained from commercial sources, checked for purity and tested from fresh cultures
at a concentration of ≥1 × 106 CFU/mL. Viruses were acquired commercially and
tested from frozen stocks at a concentration of ≥1 × 105 TCID50/mL. Nucleic acids
were tested at genomic equivalents 1 × 106 copies/mL for bacteria, and ≥1 × 105
TCID /mL for viruses. Samples were initially evaluated in singlicate; if cross
50
reactivity was observed, the organism was retested in replicates of six. All samples

There were two instances where the initial testing resulted in a detected call: non-
toxigenic C. difficile (ATCC 43601) and Proteus penneri (ZMC 0801589). In both
cases, none of the additional six replicates tested resulted in a detected call.
In silico analysis showed that the IMDx C. difficile for Abbott m2000 assay had no
predicted cross-reactivity for C. botulinum. The data indicates that there is no cross
reactivity when using the organisms tested.
Microbial Interference
To assess if there was any microbial interference with the IMDx C. difficile for
Abbott m2000 assay, the same panel used to assess analytical specificity was added to
tubes, each containing one of three strains of toxigenic C. difficile in buffer plus fecal
matrix. Each strain was tested in triplicate for each panel member; strains were
present in the samples at a concentration corresponding to 2-3x LoD. If interference
was observed, the organism was retested in replicates of six. The three strains
utilized included:
§ NAP-1 (ATCC BAA-1870)
§ VPI 10463 (ATCC 43255, toxinotype 0), and
§ 1470 (ATCC 43598, toxinotype VIII)
In the microbial interference study 118 of the tested strains showed no obvious
interference with the initial test. Two organisms, Clostridium scindens and
Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, required retesting. For Clostridium scindens, one of
the three replicates was not detected for the C. difficile ATCC 43598, and there were
two instrument errors in the initial run for C. difficile ATCC 43255. When the test
was repeated with an additional six replicates using Clostridium scindens in

combination with the three C. difficile test strains, all replicates were detected. For
Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, two of three replicates were not detected for C.
difficile ATCC BAA-1870 and one of three replicates were not detected with the C.
difficile ATCC 43598. When the test was repeated with an additional six replicates,
all replicates were detected.
In silico analysis predicted that interfering PCR products would not be produced by
the inclusion of C. botulinum organisms in a reaction. In summary, no evidence of
microbial interference was observed for any of the 118 test organisms included in the
analysis.
Potentially Interfering Substances
To evaluate the potential of substances typically found in fecal specimens to interfere
with the IMDx C. difficile for Abbott m2000 assay, three strains of C. difficile were
tested in the presence of such substances. The strains used included:
§ NAP-1 (ATCC BAA-1870)
§ VPI 10463 (ATCC 43255, toxinotype 0), and
§ 1470 (ATCC 43598, toxinotype VIII)
Substances were diluted in buffer plus fecal matrix to concentrations that would either
replicate or exceed the highest concentration expected to be found in a clinical
sample. Each of the three C. difficile strains were tested in triplicate at 2-3x LoD in
the presence of each substance. No interference was observed with any of the
substances tested. The test panel consisted of the 23 substances shown in the table

Target Carryover Study
Five assay runs were performed with alternating high positive and negative samples
to assess the potential for cross-over or carryover contamination. A total of 470
specimens were run: 235 high positive and 235 negative specimens. One strains of C.
difficile was used in this study. A positive signal for both tcdA and tcdB was detected
in one run for a single negative sample; the carryover rate was 0.4% (1/235).
f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off for the IMDx C. difficile for Abbott m2000 assay was determined using
Abbott’s proprietary maxRatio algorithm for real-time PCR data analysis. The
maxRatio method identifies a consistent point within or very near the exponential
region of the PCR signal. Compared to other analysis techniques that generate only a
cycle number, the maxRatio method generates several measurements of amplification
including cycle numbers (CN), relative measures of amplification efficiency and
curve shape. By using these values, the maxRatio method can achieve a reliable
reactive/nonreactive determination along with quantitative evaluation. For a result to
be considered reactive, the fluorescence generated must cross a reactive threshold
value (reactive threshold settings are based on “maxRatio values”). Initial maxRatio
threshold parameters were based on analysis of results of characterized strains of
toxigenic C.difficile. A third set included tcdB-variant toxigenic strains; however,
since tcdB and tcdBv are labeled with the same fluorescent, the assay cannot
differentiate tcdB from tcdBv. The assay design allows a positive result call to be
made if a signal is detected for either the tcdA or tcdB/tcdBv component or both.
Validation of threshold parameters came from analysis of 1,107 results (191 positive,
and 916 negative) from the clinical study, compiled from five test sites. The results
of this analysis are presented below:

3. Clinical studies:
The performance of the IMDx C. difficile for Abbott m2000 assay was evaluated using an
IRB approved protocol at seven (7) geographically diverse locations within the United States.
Specimens were received as either fresh stool or in Cary Blair transport media (preserved).
Results from the IMDx C. difficile for Abbott m2000 assay were compared to results
obtained from direct culture followed by testing using an FDA cleared cell cytotoxicity
assay. Reference testing was conducted at two sites.
A total of 1,583 specimens, consisting of 1,204 fresh stool (i.e., unpreserved) stool
specimens, and 379 specimens Cary Blair transport media (i.e., preserved), were included in
the final data set and analyzed for product performance. Eighteen (18) samples yielded an
unresolved error message after repeat testing and were categorized as “Invalid;” the assay
invalid rate was 1.1% (18/1,583). Therefore, a total of 1,565 valid specimens were included
in the final analyses: 1,186 fresh stool specimens and 379 preserved stool specimens were
evaluable. Among fresh stool specimens there were 118 concordant positive and 970
concordant negative results; there were also 79 false positive, and 19 false negative results.
Among Cary-Blair preserved stool specimens there were 21 concordant positive and 333
concordant negative results; there were also 23 false positive, and 2 false negative results.
Discordant specimens were subjected to further analysis by bi-directional sequencing.
There were a total of 123 discordant specimens. Ninety-one (91) of those specimens (73 false
positives, 18 false negatives,) were tested additionally to resolve the discordances. Of the 73
false positives, bidirectional sequencing results confirmed the PCR products present in 52
cases to be toxigenic C. difficile, 17 samples remained discrepant, and four were
indeterminate. Of the 18 false negatives, bidirectional sequencing confirmed the absence of

N. Instrument Name:
Abbott m2000 System running C. difficile (cDiff) Application Specification (App Spec)
Parameter Definitions v1.15:
· Abbott m2000sp: sample preparation and reagent mixing (version 3.0.21.0)
· Abbott m2000rt: amplification reaction and detection (version 3.0.338.0).
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Abbott m2000 System is an instrument platform that automates steps to perform
nucleic acid amplification assays from sample processing through amplification,
detection, and data reduction. The Abbott m2000 System comprises the m2000sp and
m2000rt instruments, which are operated with separate System Control Center (SCC)
workstations. Each instrument contains an independent software application; one for the
m2000sp and a second for the m2000rt. The m2000sp instrument is a floor standing,
automated sample preparation system. The m2000rt instrument is a real-time PCR
thermal cycler/reader instrument system. Abbott Molecular is the manufacturer of the
m2000 System. The principal hardware components that comprise the m2000sp and
m2000rt were developed by Original Equipment Manufacturer vendors, Tecan Schweiz
AG, Mannedorf, Switzerland, and Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, respectively.
Abbott Molecular developed the software that is uniquely for use with the m2000 System.
The Abbott m2000 System software processes sample preparation and
amplification/detection protocols based on pre-determined, assay-specific parameters that
are contained in individual assay application specification (App Spec) files that are
installed on the SCC. The Abbott m2000sp reads and processes bar coded primary
sample tubes and processes up to 96 specimens, controls, and calibrators in batch mode.
The m2000 System is capable of processing samples from various matrices, depending on
the specific assay application. At the completion of the automated sample preparation
protocol, the operator seals and manually transfers the PCR plate to the Abbott m2000rt
for nucleic acid detection. Bar code and m2000sp data is transferred to the m2000rt
electronically via removable media (i.e., a CD).
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Specimen identification occurs on the Abbott m2000sp instrument when it is loaded with
specimen tubes.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Fresh/raw (i.e., unpreserved) human liquid or soft stool specimens collected and
transported to the laboratory are used for testing. Cary-Blair (i.e, preserved) or frozen
human liquid or soft stool samples collected and transported to the laboratory in a sterile
container and sampled for testing. Specimen processing is automated on the Abbott
m2000sp.
5. Calibration:
There is no calibration procedure associated with the IMDx C. difficile for Abbott m2000
assay per se. Optical calibration of the Abbott m2000rt instrument is required for the
accurate measurement and discrimination of dye fluorescence during the IMDx C.
difficile for Abbott m2000 assay; the Calibration Procedures section in the Abbott
m2000rt Operations Manual describes how to perform an optical calibration.
