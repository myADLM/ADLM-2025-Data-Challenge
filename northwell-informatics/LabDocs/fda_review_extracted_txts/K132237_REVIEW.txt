SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification
Review Memorandum
To: Hologic, Inc. (Gen-Probe Prodesse, Inc.) RE: K132237
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own
Class II devices requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable:
1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device:
Prodesse® ProFASTTM+ Assay
510(k) number: K101855
2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in
its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for use
and package labeling.
3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S) to demonstrate that the FUNDAMENTAL
SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.
The 510k submission contained modifications to the Internal Control and Positive Control as well as
expanded Reactivity table to include one additional strain of Influenza A virus, Influenza
A/Indiana/10/2011 (H3N2v). The modifications are summarized as follows:
a. Outsourcing of the manufacturing of the Internal Control and subsequent minor changes to 5’ and
3’ ends of the internal control sequence.
The current Internal Control (RIC) in ProFAST+ Assay contains a RNA in vitro transcript (IVT).
The new Universal Internal Control (UIC-A) will contain a RNA in vitro transcript (IVT) and a DNA
plasmid to allow users to perform one nucleic acid extraction and test with any combination of the
Pro+ Series Assays including ProFlu+, ProhMPV+, ProParaflu+, ProFAST+, and ProAdeno+.
Due to the different vector being used in the Universal Internal Control (UIC-A), minor changes
were made to the 5’ and 3’ ends of the UIC-A sequence.
The concentration of the RNA IVT in the Universal Internal Control (UIC-A) is the same as in the
current Internal RNA Control (RIC). Handling of Universal Internal Control is identical to that of
the current Internal RNA Control (RIC) included in the ProFAST+ Assay.
b. The handling of the Positive Control for the ProFAST+ Assay will be changed to eliminate the
customer dilution that occurs immediately prior to RT-PCR setup, effectively raising the testing
concentration one log.
c. Revise the reactivity table to include one additional strain of Influenza A, Influenza
A/Indiana/10/2011 (H3N2v).
The Influenza A/H3N2v can be detected at 103 TCID /mL.

5. A Design Control Activities Summary:
a. Identification of Risk Analysis method used to assess the impact of the modification on the device
and its components, and the results of the analysis;
Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) was performed to determine whether the current
design changes create new risks or failure modes or affect the risk priority number (RPN) value.
No additional risk or change in RPN value was identified in the Risk Analysis.

b. To demonstrate that the modifications in Internal Control do not change the assay performance,
Analytical Studies and a Comparison Study were conducted.
- Analytical Performances:
· Analytical Sensitivity Confirmation
The LoD, which was established in K101855, was confirmed for Influenza A/H1, Influenza
A/H3, and Influenza A/2009 H1N1 when tested with the UIC-A side by side with the
current RIC. The confirmed LoDs are as follows:
Influenza A/H1 5X 10-1 TCID /mL
50
Influenza A/H3 5X 10-1 TCID /mL
50
Influenza A/2009 H1N1 1X 102 TCID /mL
50
· IC Interference Study
The IC Interference Study demonstrated that the new control, UIC-A, did not inhibit the
detection of target organisms at levels close to LoD.
· Sample Stability Study
The study demonstrated that the stability of the samples would not be affected by a
change in the internal control.
· Extractor Equivalency Studies
The equivalency of nucleic acid extraction methods between the bioMérieux NucliSENS
easyMAG automated extractor and Roche MagNA Pure LC extractor were evaluated by
spiking the cultured and tittered strain of Influenza A into a negative nasopharyngeal
swab (NPS) matrix pool at the confirmed LoD concentration. The study demonstrated
equivalency between the two extraction methods.
- Comparison Study:
The comparison study was conducted for all Pro+ Series Assays including ProFlu+, ProhMPV+,
ProParaflu+, ProFAST+, and ProAdeno+ using 366 positive samples and 66 negative samples.
Among the 366 positive samples, 330 were retrospective pre-selected archived NPS specimens
with 30 positive samples per target (11 targets total) and 36 were contrived samples, generated
by spiking individual negative retrospective NPS samples with whole organism (Influenza
A/Seasonal H1 or Parainfluenza 2). Each sample was split into 3 aliquots; one aliquot was tested
using the current Internal RNA Control (RIC), one aliquot was tested using the Universal Internal
Control (UIC-A), and one aliquot was tested using the current Universal Internal Control (UIA-P)
for ProAdeno+ Assay. All samples were then split into 72 panels with 6 samples per panel,
extracted and tested by four different operators. Half of the panel samples were extracted using
the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG method and the other half using the Roche MagNA Pure
LC method. Of the 432 samples utilized in the study, 23 samples were removed from analysis
due to the invalid controls or incomplete test results. The results for ProFAST+ Assay are
summarized in the following tables:

The results of analytical studies and the clinical study confirmed the original performance claims
of the ProFAST+ Assay and demonstrated that assay performance was not affected by the
incorporation of the modified Universal Internal Control (UIC-A). The ProFAST+ Assay package
insert has been updated to reflect the changes in the controls
c. To evaluate whether eliminating customer dilution prior to RT-PCR setup will affect the
effectiveness of the Positive Control at detecting any errors occurred in the target channels,
several defective mixtures that either lacked the Taq polymerase or MMLV, or did not include
sufficient concentration of reverse primers, or contained a PCR inhibitor were tested with Positive
Control at supplied concentration without customer dilution. The study demonstrated that the
Positive Control used at the supplied concentration could effectively detect any global errors in
the target channels. The ProFAST+ Assay package insert has been updated to reflect the
changes in the Positive Control.
d. To assess the reactivity of the ProFAST+ Assay with influenza A (IA) H3N2v virus, a cultured and
tittered strain of H3N2v, obtained from CDC, was diluted in series to near the assay cutoff. The
study results showed that the ProFAST+ Assay can detect Influenza A/H3N2v at 103 TCID /mL.
50
Although this test has been shown to detect influenza A/Indiana/10/2011 (H3N2v) virus cultured
from positive human respiratory specimens, the performance characteristics of this device with
clinical specimens that are positive for H3N2v influenza virus have not been established.
The ProFAST+ Assay package insert has been updated to include the revised reactivity table.
