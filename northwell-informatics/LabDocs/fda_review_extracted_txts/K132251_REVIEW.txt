Establishing the Performance Characteristics of In Vitro Diagnostic Devices for Chlamydia

L. Test Principle:
The APTIMA Combo 2Assay involves the technologies of target capture, transcription-
mediated amplification (TMA), and dual kinetic assay (DKA).
Specimens are collected and transferred into their respective specimen transport tubes. The
transport solutions in these tubes release the rRNA targets and protect them from degradation
during storage. When the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay is performed in the laboratory, the target
rRNA molecules are isolated from specimens by use of capture oligomers via target capture
that utilizes magnetic microparticles. The capture oligomers contain sequences
complementary to specific regions of the target molecules as well as a string of
deoxyadenosine residues. A separate capture oligomer is used for each target. During the
hybridization step, the sequence specific regions of the capture oligomers bind to specific
regions of the target molecules. The capture oligomer:target complex is then captured out of
solution by decreasing the temperature of the reaction to room temperature. This temperature
reduction allows hybridization to occur between the deoxyadenosine region on the capture
oligomer and the poly-deoxythymidine molecules that are covalently attached to the
magnetic particles. The microparticles, including the captured target molecules bound to
them, are pulled to the side of the reaction vessel using magnets and the supernatant is
aspirated. The particles are washed to remove residual specimen matrix that may contain
amplification reaction inhibitors. After the target capture steps are completed, the specimens
are ready for amplification.
Target amplification assays are based on the ability of complementary oligonucleotide
primers to specifically anneal and allow enzymatic amplification of the target nucleic acid
strands. The APTIMA Combo 2 Assay replicates a specific region of the 23S rRNA from
Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and a specific region of the 16S rRNA from Neisseria
gonorrhea (GC) via DNA intermediates. A unique set of primers is used for each target
molecule. Detection of the rRNA amplification product
sequences (amplicon) is achieved using nucleic acid hybridization. Single-stranded
chemiluminescent DNA probes, which are complementary to a region of each target
amplicon, are labeled with different acridinium ester molecules. The labeled DNA probes
combine with amplicon to form stable RNA:DNA hybrids. The Selection Reagent
differentiates hybridized from unhybridized probe, eliminating the generation of signal from
unhybridized probe. During the detection step, light emitted from the labeled RNA:DNA
6

--- Page 7 ---
hybrids is measured as photon signals in a luminometer, and are reported as Relative Light
Units (RLU). In DKA, differences in the kinetic profiles of the CT and GC labeled probes
allow for the differentiation of signal; kinetic profiles are derived from measurements of
photon output during the detection read time. The chemiluminescent detection reaction for
CT signal has very rapid kinetics and has the “flasher” kinetic type. The chemiluminescent
detection reaction for GC signal is relatively slower and has the “glower” kinetic type. Assay
results are determined by a cut-off based on the total RLU and the kinetic curve type.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-Laboratory Repeatability:
Within-laboratory repeatability was conducted previously to support the clearance of
K111409. Please refer to decision summary of K111049.
Reproducibility:
Reproducibility of the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay on the PANTHER System was
evaluated in two different studies using panel members created with Specimen
Transport Medium in Reproducibility Study One and using panel members created
with clinical urine specimens in Reproducibility Study Two.
Reproducibility Study One
APTIMA Combo 2 Assay reproducibility was evaluated with panel members created
using Specimen Transport Medium at three external US laboratories using the
PANTHER System. Testing was performed using one lot of assay reagents and a total
of six operators (two at each site). Testing was performed over at least 10 days at
each site. The negative panel member consisted of Specimen Transport Medium and
positive panel members were created by spiking Specimen Transport Medium with
lysate from CT and/or GC organisms to result in panel members with expected
targeted concentrations. The table below shows the CT and GC concentrations for
each panel member and the mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of
variation (CV) of the RLU data for each panel member between-sites, between-
operators, between-days, between-runs, within-runs, and overall. Percent agreement
with expected results is also shown. Only samples with valid results were included in
the analyses.

samples:
1. One aliquot was left un-spiked (negative sample).
2. One aliquot was spiked with 0.25 IFU/mL of cultured CT serovar E and 12.5

The un-spiked and spiked urine samples were split into two aliquots to test fresh
(non-frozen) and frozen sample storage conditions:
1. Fresh samples: One spiked and one un-spiked aliquot of each urine sample was
stored at 2˚C to 30°C until tested.
2. Frozen samples: One spiked and one un-spiked aliquot of each sample was
frozen and stored at ≤ -20˚C for at least 72 hours (to ensure samples were

The results from this study demonstrate equivalency between urine samples tested
fresh and paired samples tested after being frozen and thawed.
Quality Control Results and Acceptability
The Positive Control, CT / Negative Control, GC and the Positive Control, GC /
Negative Control, CT act as controls for the target capture, amplification, and
detection steps of the assay. The Positive Control, CT / Negative Control, GC serves
as the negative control for the GC test results. The Positive Control, GC / Negative
Control, CT serves as the negative control for the CT test results. If desired, a dual
negative control furnished by the user can be added to monitor assay background.
Correct preparation of specimens is confirmed visually by the presence of a single
APTIMA collection swab in a swab specimen transport tube or the absence of a swab
in an APTIMA specimen transfer tube for PreservCyt liquid Pap specimens.
The APTIMA Combo 2 Assay Controls must produce the following test results:

d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Detection (LoD) study included a series of dilution panels of CT
(serovars E and G) and GC (ATCC strain 49226 and 19424) prepared in urine and in
specimen transport medium (STM) to achieve several test concentrations. The
positivity, with the two-sided 95% Score confidence interval, was calculated for each
test concentration of each panel. Probit analysis was performed on the positivity
results of each panel to determine the predicted 95% detection limit. The LoDs in
both STM and urine sample matrices are well below the assay sensitivity claims for
CT (1 IFU/assay) and GC (50 cells/assay).
The LoD of the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay on the PANTHER system in both urine
and STM sample matrices was verified for 12 serovars of CT and 30 strains of GC.
Dilutions of less than 2.5 IFU/mL tested positive in the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay for
the following 12 serovars: D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L1, L2, L2a, and L3 (≥95%
positivity was observed in samples containing CT concentrations of 1.89 IFU/mL).
Dilutions of less than 125 CFU/mL tested positive in the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay
for 30 different strains of GC (≥95% positivity was observed in samples containing
GC concentrations of 0.36 cells/mL).

f. Interference:
Please refer to the decision summary of K111049.
g. Carryover Study:
The purpose of this study was to determine the carryover rate of the APTIMA Combo 2
Assay on the PANTHER System when high titer positive samples were alternately
processed with negative samples in a checkerboard format. Six runs were performed on
one PANTHER instrument using one reagent lot for three days. The first run comprised
of 135 negative samples was performed to establish the baseline false positive rate. The
five subsequent runs were comprised of 54 samples (GC-positive and GC-negative
samples) alternated in checkerboard format. High titer positive samples for this study
were made by spiking GC rRNA into specimen transport media (STM) to give a final
concentration equivalent to ~ 2 x 105 cells/mL. The false positive rate from the baseline
run without any positive samples (Run 1) was 0% (0/135; 100% specificity). The false
positive rate from the runs with positive samples in the checkerboard design (Runs 2-6)
was 0.74% (1/135; 99.26% specificity). The carryover rate was 0.74% with a 95% CI of
-2.03 to 4.10.

h. Assay cut-off:
Assay test results are automatically interpreted by the APTIMA Assay software,
using the APTIMA Combo 2 protocol. A test result may be a negative, equivocal,
positive, or invalid as determined by the kinetic type and total RLU in the detection
step. A test result may be invalid due to a parameter outside the normal expected
ranges. Initial equivocal and invalid test results should be retested.

12

--- Page 13 ---
Clinical Study One: Vaginal Swab, PreservCyt Solution Liquid Pap, Female
Endocervical Swab, and Male Urethral Swab Specimen Clinical Study
A prospective, multi-center clinical study was conducted to establish the performance
characteristics of the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay on the PANTHER System. Specimens
were collected from symptomatic and asymptomatic men (n=580) and women (n=1332)
enrolled from seven geographically and ethnically diverse US clinical sites, including
obstetrics and gynecology, family planning, public health, and STD clinics. Subjects
were classified as symptomatic if symptoms were reported by the subject. Subjects were
classified as asymptomatic if the subject did not report symptoms. Of the 580 male
subjects, none were <18 years of age, 72 were 18 to 20 years of age, 201 were 21 to 25
years of age, and 307 were >25 years of age. Of the 1332 female subjects, 11 were 14 to
15 years of age, 59 were 16 to 17 years of age, 319 were 18 to 20 years of age, 401 were
21 to 25 years of age, and 542 were >25 years of age.
Up to two specimens were collected from each male subject (one urethral swab and one
first-catch urine, in that order) and up to four specimens were collected from each female
subject (one first-catch urine, one vaginal swab, one PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap
specimen, and one endocervical swab, in that order). All specimens were clinician-
collected except urine specimens and approximately half of the vaginal swab specimens,
which were collected by the subject at the clinic. Approximately half of the PreservCyt
Solution liquid Pap specimens were collected with a broom-type device and half were
collected with a spatula and cytobrush. Samples were prepared for APTIMA testing in
accordance with the appropriate APTIMA specimen collection kit package insert
instructions.
All evaluable samples (567 male urethral swab, 580 male urine, 1319 vaginal swab, 1330
PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap, and 1310 endocervical swab samples) were tested with
the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay on the PANTHER System in accordance with package
insert instructions. The samples were split among three laboratories (two external
laboratories and in-house). Samples with initial invalid, equivocal, or error results were
retested. Eighteen (18) male urethral swab, 25 vaginal swab, one PreservCyt Solution
liquid Pap, and 37 endocervical swab samples had final invalid results and were excluded
from the analyses. Most of the invalid results were due to insufficient sample volume.
One vaginal swab, and one endocervical swab had final CT equivocal results and one
PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap sample, and one endocervical swab had final GC
equivocal results and were excluded from the analyses.
Male urethral swab, male and female urine, and PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap samples
were tested with cleared nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) to establish the
infected status. The infected status algorithm used results from two specimen types and
two reference NAATs. Subjects were categorized as infected if a positive result occurred
in each of the two reference NAATs (see Tables 8, 9, 11, and 12 for the infected status
algorithms). For female subjects, if the positive NAAT results occurred only in the urine
specimens and not in the PreservCyt Solution liquid Pap specimens, the subject was
categorized as infected; however, for the evaluation of the non-urine specimen types, the
13

--- Page 14 ---
specimens were considered non-infected. Subjects that could not be categorized as
infected or not infected were excluded from the performance analyses.
In addition, male urine samples tested with the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay on the
PANTHER System were excluded from the performance analyses due to the low
prevalence of GC in the study population, particularly in the asymptomatic subjects.
Clinical Study Two: Male Urine Specimen Clinical Study
A prospective, multi-center clinical study was conducted to establish the performance
characteristics of the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay on the PANTHER System in male urine
specimens. Specimens were collected from symptomatic and asymptomatic men
(n=1492) enrolled from 13 geographically and ethnically diverse US clinical research
sites, and family planning, public health, men’s health, and STD clinics. Subjects were
classified as symptomatic if symptoms were reported by the subject. Subjects were
classified as asymptomatic if the subject did not report symptoms. Of the 1492 subjects
enrolled, 14 were withdrawn.
Two specimens were collected from each subject (one urethral swab and one first-catch
urine, in that order). The urethral swab specimens were clinician-collected, and urine
specimens were collected by the subject at the clinic. Urine specimens from each subject
were processed into multiple samples for CT/GC testing with different NAATs in
accordance with the instructions in the appropriate specimen collection kit package insert.
The male urine samples for APTIMA Combo 2 Assay testing on the PANTHER System
were split among three external laboratories.
All 1478 male urine samples from non-withdrawn subjects were tested with the APTIMA
Combo 2 Assay on the PANTHER System in accordance with the APTIMA Combo 2
Assay package insert instructions. Samples with initial invalid, equivocal, or error results
were retested. One male urine sample had a final invalid result and was excluded from
the analyses. The invalid result was due to insufficient sample volume. Of the remaining
1477 evaluable male subjects, 46 were 16 to 17 years of age, 155 were 18 to 20 years of
age, 524 were 21 to 30 years of age, 279 were 31 to 40 years of age, and 473 were >40
years of age.
Male urethral swab and urine samples were tested with cleared NAATs to establish the
infected status (see Tables 10 and 13 for the infected status algorithms). The infected
status algorithm used urethral swab and urine sample results from one reference CT and
GC NAAT and urine sample results from two additional reference CT and GC NAATs to
generate four reference results for each analyte. Subjects were categorized as infected if a
positive result occurred in at least two of the reference NAATs. Subjects that could not be
categorized as infected or not infected were excluded from the performance analyses; 1
subject had an indeterminate CT infected status and was excluded from the performance
analyses for detection of CT.

Chlamydia trachomatis Performance Results
Performance characteristics of the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay for CT detection were
estimated for each specimen type and are displayed in Tables 4 and 5 combining data
from the two clinical studies. Performance was calculated by comparing PANTHER
System results to an infected status algorithm, which differed between the two clinical
studies (see Tables 8 through 10 for the CT infected status algorithms). Table 4 shows the
sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value
(NPV) of the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay for CT detection and the prevalence of CT
(based on the infected status) in each specimen type.
