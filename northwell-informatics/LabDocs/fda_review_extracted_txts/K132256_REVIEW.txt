SPECIAL 510(k)
Device Modification Decision Summary
To: BD Diagnostics RE: K132256
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own
Class II device requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable
1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device:
Trade Name: BD Veritor™ System Flu A+B assay Clinical kit
510(k) number: K120049, K121797
2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in
its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for
use, package labeling.
3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S). The modification presented in this 510(k) is the
inclusion of the H7N9 influenza A virus strain below, to the analytical sensitivity information. The
submitter tested the ability of the BD Veritor System Flu A+B test to detect the H7N9 influenza A
virus. The virus used (A/Anhui/1/2013) was inactivated viral material in clarified allontoic fluid from
chicken eggs obtained from the WHO Collaborating Centre for Surveillance, Epidemiology and
Control of Influenza, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Analytical sensitivity testing was
done at10 fold dilutions from the stock received from CDC and was tested in triplicate using the BD
Veritor System Flu A+B test to establish the approximate level for the LOD:
· 7.94 x 108 CEID /mL
50
· 7.94 x 107 CEID /mL
50
· 7.94 x 106 CEID /mL
50
· 3.97 x 106 CEID /mL
50
· 1.99 x 106 CEID /mL
50
· 7.94 x 105 CEID /mL
50
· 7.94 x 104 CEID /mL
50
(CEID /mL= 50% Chicken Egg Infectious Dose)
50
A final dilution was prepared and tested in replicates of 60:
· 5.42 x 106 CEID /mL
50
The limit of detection of the BD Veritor System Flu A+B test with A/Anhui/1/2013 H7N9 was 5.42 x
106 CEID /mL with a positivity of 98.3% (59/60).
50
The BD Veritor System Flu A+B Clinical kit package insert has been updated to include the additional
analytical sensitivity information.
4. The FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.

The package insert has been updated to include detection of the following H7N9 virus in the
analytical sensitivity information section and strain reactivity tables:
A/Anhui/1/2013 H7N9
Disclaimer: “Although this test has been shown to detect the novel avian influenza A(H7N9)
cultured virus, the performance characteristics of this device with clinical specimens that are
positive for the novel avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have not been established. The BD Veritor
System Flu A+B test can distinguish between influenza A and B viruses, but it cannot differentiate
influenza A subtypes.”
6. Design Control Activities Summary:
Analytical Sensitivity Testing was conducted as described in section 7, “Summary of Studies”.
Declaration of Conformity to Design Control
A “Declaration of Conformity” statement was submitted for the manufacturing facility and validation
activities and signed by the Director, Regulatory Affairs and Quality Systems. The statements indicate
that;
1. The verification activities, as required by the risk analysis, for the modification were performed by
the designated individual(s) and the results demonstrated that the predetermined acceptance
criteria were met.
2. The manufacturing facility, BD Rapid Diagnostics Co Ltd, is in conformance with the design
control requirements as specified in 21 CFR 820. 30 and the records are available for review.
In conclusion, based on both the results of the analytical sensitivity testing and the risk management
report, the modified labeling is truthful and accurate. The changes do not affect the performance of
the test and it is therefore substantially equivalent to the current cleared test.
7. A Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary, and the Indications for
Use Enclosure.
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended
use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the
particular modification and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices
demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. On this basis, I recommend
the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.
