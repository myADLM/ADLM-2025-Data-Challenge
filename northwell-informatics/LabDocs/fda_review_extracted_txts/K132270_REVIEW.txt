L. Test Principle:
The cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae is based
on two processes: (1) automated sample preparation to obtain CT and NG DNA; (2)
simultaneous PCR amplification of target DNA sequences using both CT and NG specific
primer pairs and real-time detection of cleaved fluorescent-labeled CT and NG specific
oligonucleotide detection probes. An Internal Control, containing CT and NG DNA, is added
to all samples prior to automated sample preparation and is amplified and detected
simultaneously with each sample to monitor the entire process.
Sample preparation for the cobas CT/NG v2.0Test is automated with the use of the cobas x
480 instrument. Specimens are lysed in the collection device by the chaotropic agent in the
cobas PCR Media. Released nucleic acids, along with added CT/NG Internal Control DNA,
are purified through binding to magnetic glass particles, washed, and separated from these
particles making them ready for PCR amplification and detection.
The Master Mix reagent contains primer pairs and probes specific for the CT cryptic plasmid
DNA, the CT genomic ompA gene DNA, NG genomic DNA sequences A and B within the
DR-9 region, and CT and NG Internal Control DNA.

Target Selection
The cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test detects a DNA sequence in the cryptic plasmid common to all
serovars of C. trachomatis as well as a separate DNA sequence within the C. trachomatis
chromosome. For N. gonorrhoeae, the test detects two targeted sequences in a highly
conserved direct repeat region.
Target Amplification
Processed samples are added to the amplification mixture in a microwell plate in which PCR
amplification occurs. The reaction mixture is heated to separate the isolated double-stranded
DNA and expose the primer target sequences. As the mixture cools, the primers anneal to the
target DNA. Z05 DNA polymerase, in the presence of Mn2+ and excess dNTPs, extends the
annealed primers along the target templates to produce double-stranded DNA. This
completes the first cycle of PCR, yielding a double-stranded DNA copy of the target regions
of the CT and/or NG DNA and the CT/NG Internal Control DNA. Repetition of this process
results in the amplification of DNA between the primer target sequences, producing a
double-stranded DNA molecule termed an amplicon. The cobas z 480 analyzer automatically
repeats this process for a designated number of cycles, with each cycle intended to double the
amount of amplicon DNA.
Internal Control Amplification
The CT/NG Internal Control is a combination of two non-infectious recombinant plasmid
DNAs, each with primer binding regions identical to those of either the C. trachomatis or the
N. gonorrhoeae genomic target sequences. Both recombinant plasmid DNAs have an identical
randomized internal target sequence, and a unique probe binding region that differentiates the
CT/NG Internal Control from target amplicon. These features were selected to ensure
independent detection of both the CT/NG Internal Control and the C. trachomatis and N.
gonorrhoeae target DNAs. The CT/NG Internal Control Reagent is included in the cobas CT/NG
v2.0 Test and is introduced into each sample on the cobas x 480 instrument during sample
processing.
Selective Amplification
Selective amplification of target nucleic acid from the specimen is achieved in the cobas
CT/NG v2.0 Test by the use of AmpErase (uracil-N-glycosylase) enzyme and deoxyuridine
triphosphate (dUTP). The AmpErase enzyme recognizes and catalyzes the destruction of
DNA strands containing deoxyuridine, but not DNA containing deoxythymidine.
Deoxyuridine is not present in naturally occurring DNA, but is always present in amplicon
due to the use of deoxyuridine triphosphate in place of thymidine triphosphate as one of the
dNTPs in the Master Mix reagent; therefore, only amplicon contain deoxyuridine.
Deoxyuridine renders contaminating amplicon susceptible to destruction by AmpErase
enzyme prior to amplification of the target DNA. AmpErase enzyme, which is included in
the Master Mix reagent, catalyzes the cleavage of deoxyuridine-containing DNA at the
deoxyuridine residues by opening the deoxyribose chain at the C1-position. When heated in
the first thermal cycling step at the alkaline pH of Master Mix, the amplicon DNA chain
6

--- Page 7 ---
breaks at the position of the deoxyuridine, thereby rendering the DNA non-amplifiable.
AmpErase enzyme is inactive at temperatures above 55ºC, i.e., throughout the thermal
cycling steps, and therefore does not destroy target amplicon. The cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test
has been demonstrated to inactivate at least 103 copies of deoxyuridine-containing CT/NG
amplicon per PCR.
Detection of PCR Products
The cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test utilizes real-time PCR technology. The use of fluorescent probes
enables real-time detection of PCR product accumulation by monitoring the emission
intensity of fluorescent dyes released during the amplification process. The probes include
CT cryptic plasmid, CT ompA, NG DR-9A, NG DR-9B and CT/NG Internal Control-specific
oligonucleotides, all labeled with a reporter dye and a quencher. When the fluorescent dye-
labeled probes are intact, the reporter fluorescence is suppressed by the proximity of the
quencher due to Förster-type energy transfer effects. During PCR, the probes hybridize to
their respective target sequence and are cleaved by the 5’ to 3’ nuclease activity of the
thermostable Z05 DNA polymerase. Once the reporter and quencher are separated,
quenching no longer occurs, and the fluorescent emission of the reporter dyes increases. The
amplification of CT targets, NG targets and the CT/NG Internal Control are measured
independently and at different wavelengths. This process is repeated for a designated number
of cycles, each cycle increasing the emission intensity of the individual reporter dyes.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision:
Precision of the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test was evaluated in-house using a panel composed
of CT and NG cultures diluted into the following three natural specimen matrices that
were predetermined to be negative for both CT and NG prior to spiking:
· Pooled negative vaginal swab specimen matrix in cobas PCR Media
· Pooled negative urine in cobas PCR Media
· Pooled negative PreservCyt specimens.
The precision panel for each of the three matrices contained one negative panel member
and three positive panel members containing combinations of CT and NG at 1X and 3X
LOD. Testing was performed with three lots of cobas CT/NG v.2.0 Test reagents in 24
runs on three instruments over 12 days. A total of 48 replicates were tested for each panel
member. Study results demonstrated the expected hit rates for all positive panel members
and 100% negative results for all replicates of the negative panel member. Analysis of
variance of Cycle Threshold (Ct) values from valid tests performed on positive panel
members demonstrated overall Coefficient of Variation (CV) % ranges from 1.0% to
3.0% for CT and from 1.0% to 2.0% for NG. Detailed results for this study are presented
in the tables below.

course of 12 days by two operators using three lots of reagents and two cobas 4800
Systems. Two replicates of each panel member were tested in each run, generating up to
48 test results for each panel member. Testing of the high-negative panel member
yielded the anticipated hit rate for all three matrices.

b. Reproducibility:
A Reproducibility Study was performed across testing sites, operators, runs, and days for
the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test using panels of samples separately prepared in the following
natural specimen matrices that were predetermined to be negative for both CT and NG
prior to spiking:
· Pooled negative vaginal swabs collected in cobas PCR Media
· Pooled negative urine matrix stabilized in cobas PCR Media

· Pooled negative cervical specimen matrix collected in PreservCyt Solution.
The positive panel members for each matrix contained CT or NG at concentrations of 1 x
LOD and 3 x LOD. Also included was one negative sample containing matrix only.
Testing was performed at two external sites and one in-house site. A run for cobas PCR
Media (urine and swab) included three replicates of each of five panel members and one
positive and one negative control (32 total tests). A run for the PreservCyt Solution panel
included three replicates of each of five panel members and one positive and one negative
control (17 total tests). Two operators at each site performed one run per day each, for a
total of five days of testing per operator per panel type (10 days of testing total for each
panel type). Testing was performed with one reagent lot.
Overall, 127 runs were performed: 62 included a combination of urine and swab samples
and 65 included only PreservCyt samples. Seven failed runs (two runs with urine/swab
samples and five runs with PreservCyt samples) were attributed to protocol deviations
and instrument errors. There was one invalid test result in a PreservCyt sample and one
failed test result each in swab, urine and PreservCyt samples. These failed tests were due
to instrument errors.
All valid test results were included in the separate analyses of the percent agreement for
CT and NG for each panel type. For negative panel members, there were no false positive
results for all three matrices thus resulting in negative percent agreement (NPA) of 100%
for both CT and NG.
Reproducibility Results for CT:
Testing resulted in 100% positive percent agreement for samples prepared in all three
matrices containing CT concentrations at 3X LOD as well as samples prepared in a urine
matrix with CT concentrations at 1X LOD. Samples prepared in vaginal swab and
PreservCyt matrices containing CT at 1X LOD demonstrated 96.7% and 98.9% positive
percent agreement. Analysis of variance components of Ct values for CT-positive panel
members demonstrated overall CV's ranging from 1.4% to 2.6% for all three matrices.
Detailed results from testing are presented in the following tables:

* For negative samples, percent agreement = (number of negative results/total valid results) x 100; for positive
samples, percent agreement = (number of positive results/total valid results) x 100.
Ct = cycle threshold; SD = standard deviation; CV = coefficient of variation; LOD = limit of detection;
CT = C. trachomatis; NG = N. gonorrhoeae; n/a = not applicable.
Reproducibility Results for NG:
Testing of samples containing NG concentrations at 3X LOD resulted in 100% positive
percent agreement for samples prepared in vaginal swab and PreservCyt matrices and
99.4% agreement for samples prepare in a urine matrix. Samples containing NG
concentrations at approximately 1X LOD demonstrated 95%, 89.4%, and 99.4% positive
percent agreement respectively for samples prepared in urine, vaginal swab, and
PreservCyt matrices. Analysis of variance components of Ct values for NG-positive
panel members demonstrated overall CV's ranging from 1.6% to 2.6% for all three
matrices. Detailed results from testing are presented in the following tables:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Controls:
One set of cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test Positive and Negative Controls are required to be
included in each run. Valid results must be obtained for both the Positive and Negative
Controls for the cobas 4800 Software in order for run results to be displayed. The CT/NG
positive (+) Control contains non-infectious DNA plasmids of both CT and NG
sequences and is used as a run control to monitor the target capture, amplification, and
detection steps of the test. The CT/NG Negative (-) Control contains buffer with no
nucleic acid.
The cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test includes a CT/NG Internal Control that is added to each
specimen and control during specimen processing on the cobas x instrument. The
Internal Control is a combination of two non-infectious recombinant plasmid DNAs, each
with primer binding regions identical to those of either the CT or the NG genomic target
sequences. The Internal Control monitors test specimens for the presence of PCR
inhibitors. The Internal Control is also required for validation of the run controls.
Specimen Stability:
Specimen Stability was evaluated for ambient temperature storage and shipping for the
following four specimen types:

· Urine stabilized in cobas PCR Media (male and female urine pools)
· Endocervical swab specimens collected in cobas PCR Media
· Vaginal swab specimens collected in cobas PCR Media
· Cervical specimens collected in PreservCyt solution (primary and secondary
containers)
Samples were prepared for each specimen matrix by combining leftover negative
specimens into multiple unique pools. CT and NG cultures were spiked into each pooled
matrix to approximately 3 X LoD. The study included testing of matrix only samples as
well. Testing was performed on the day of sample preparation and at several time points
during the storage time period. Study results demonstrated that positive samples remain
positive for a minimum of 12 months when stored at 32ºC, with no significant change in
Ct values. In addition, matrix-only samples yielded the expectant negative result for the
same storage conditions. For PreservCyt matrices that are transferred to a secondary
container, study results support the claim of up to four week storage at 30ºC.
Additional assessment of specimen stability was performed for storage of specimens at 2-
8ºC. A minimum of 54 positive and 20 negative previously tested archived specimens
were tested for each specimen type after long term storage at 2-8ºC. Positive specimens
were chosen based on the Ct values obtained when initially tested with the majority being
low positives (Ct values above 35). Testing results demonstrated that each specimen type
is stable for up to 12 months at 2-8ºC.
In summary, specimen stability study results support the claimed storage conditions.
Processed Specimen Stability
Processed specimen stability was evaluated for each of the four specimen types described
above for both ambient air (up to 32ºC) and refrigerated storage conditions (2-8ºC). For
this study, 12 specimens for each matrix were spiked with CT and NG cultures at
approximately 3X the LoD. Immediately after the completion of sample preparation,
extraction plates containing the processed specimens (eluates) were sealed and stored at
2-8ºC for up to eight days or 37ºC for 24 hours. After storage, eluates for each sample
were tested using the CT/NG PCR-only workflow. All negative samples and positive
samples yielded the expected results at T All positive samples were positive after
0.
storage at eight days with no significant change in Ct values. One negative vaginal swab
sample gave a positive result at day eight and again upon retesting. It was determined that
the most likely cause of this unexpected false positive result was contamination. A new
set of positive and negative vaginal swab samples were prepared and tested at T and
0
after seven days and all results were correct. Study results supported processed specimen
stability claims of seven days at 2-8ºC and 24 hours at ambient temperature.
d. Detection limit:
The analytical sensitivity (Limit of Detection or LOD) for the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test
was determined by testing dilutions of quantified CT (serovars D and I) and NG (isolates
20

--- Page 21 ---
2948 and 6693) cultures into the following matrices:
· Pooled negative endocervical swab specimens in cobas PCR Media
· Pooled negative vaginal swab specimens in cobas PCR Media
· Pooled negative male and female urine specimens in cobas PCR Media
· Pooled negative cervical specimen in PreservCyt Solution
All CT serovars and NG strains were tested at five concentration levels (60 replicates for
each level). In addition, 24 replicates of a negative sample were tested. Replicates for
each level were analyzed using the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test across three lots of reagents
with the claimed LOD as the target concentration which can be detected in ³95% of
tested replicates.
The LOD for the CT serovar D and I cultures and NG strains 2948 and 6693 for each
matrix are shown in the following table:

*The stated LOD for male and female urine are for urine samples diluted in cobas PCR media. The LOD for neat urine (before
dilution) is twice the LOD for diluted urine.
e. Inclusivity
Inclusivity testing with the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test was performed for 13 additional CT
serovars, the Swedish new variant strain (nvCT) and an additional 43 independently
isolated strains of NG. Testing was done to demonstrate that these targets can be detected
at concentrations near the LOD previously determined for CT serovars D and I and NG
strains 2948 and 6693. Samples for this study were prepared by diluting titered CT and
NG cultures into pooled negative endocervical swab specimen matrix in cobas PCR
Media, pooled negative vaginal swab specimen matrix in cobas PCR Media, pooled
negative urine specimen matrix plus cobas PCR Media and pooled negative cervical
specimen in PreservCyt Solution. A minimum of 20 replicates were tested for each
strain, dilution, and matrix using one lot of cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test reagents. Results are
shown in the tables below. For NG, all strains with identical results are presented as a
group, shown in the columns labeled “Numbers of NG Strains”.

f. Analytical specificity:
Because there is no change in the assay reagents for the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test as
compared to the cleared cobas CT/NG Test (K110923), it was concluded that the data
for the analytical specificity testing from the first clearance could be used to support
the performance of the v2.0 test. In this study, a panel of 184 bacteria, fungi, and

viruses, including those commonly found in the female urogenital tract, as well as
representatives of N. cineria, N. flava N. lactamica, N. perflava, N. subflava, and
other phylogenetically unrelated organisms, were tested to assess potential cross-
reactivity (see table immediately following this section). Samples were spiked at
concentrations of 1 x 106 Units*/mL or higher for the majority of organisms tested.
The second table below lists selected organisms that were evaluated at lower
concentrations. Organisms were spiked into pooled negative urine in cobas PCR
Media, pooled negative vaginal matrix in cobas® PCR Media, and pooled negative
PreservCyt specimen matrices. No false positive results or interference of the internal
control (IC) signal were observed for any of the organisms and matrices evaluated.
*Definition of Units/mL: All bacteria were quantified as Colony Forming Units (CFU) except
Chlamydophila pneumoniae was quantified as Inclusion Forming Units (IFU). Treponema pallidum and
HBV were quantified as DNA copies. Adenovirus was quantified as Plaque Forming Units (PFU). CMV,
EBV, HSV-1 and HSV-2 were quantified as Viral Particles (VP). HCV and HIV-1 were quantified in
International Units (IU). Trichomonas vaginalis, HPV16 and HPV18 were quantified as cells/mL.

g. Microbial interference
All organisms tested in the analytical specificity study listed in the table above were also
evaluated for potential microbial interference with the detection of CT and/or NG. In this
study, samples were prepared with each potentially interfering organism mixed with CT
and NG cultures at approximately 3 times their respective LoDs. In addition, CT/NG
positive and negative test samples (with no spiking of additional organisms) were used as
controls. Study results demonstrated no false negative results and no deterioration in Ct
values for either CT or NG analytes in all evaluated matrices.

Performance of the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test was evaluated in the presence of potentially
interfering exogenous substances including over-the counter products and prescription
drugs that may be present in clinical specimens. Samples were prepared in pooled
negative endocervical swab specimen matrix collected in cobas PCR Media, pooled
negative vaginal swab specimen matrix collected in cobas® PCR Media, pooled negative
urine specimen matrix plus cobas® PCR Media and pooled negative cervical specimen
matrix collected in PreservCyt Solution. Positive samples were spiked with each
potentially interfering substance and CT and NG cultures at ~3 x LOD for each target.
For each substance and matrix evaluated, replicates of ten CT/NG positive and ten
CT/NG negative samples were tested. Substances and matrices tested are listed in the

assay interference with metronidazole vaginal gel, Vagisil Satin, and Replens.
Testing of Endogenous Substances:
Performance of the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test was evaluated in the presence of potentially-
interfering endogenous substances including whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC), and mucus. Samples were prepared in urine, vaginal, endocervical, and
PreservCyt matrices. For each substance and matrix evaluated, replicates of ten CT/NG
positive and ten CT/NG negative samples were tested. Positive samples were spiked with
each potentially interfering substance and CT and NG cultures at ~3 x LOD for each
target.
The presence of whole blood lead to false negative results when present in urine samples
containing greater than 0.25% blood and in cervical specimens in PreservCyt solution at
concentrations greater than 3%. In addition, invalid results were observed in urine
samples containing whole blood concentrations greater than 0.25% and in PreservCyt
samples containing whole blood at concentrations 5% or higher.
The presence of PBMC resulted in false negative results when present in urine samples
containing greater than 1 x 105 cells/mL and in vaginal or endocervical samples
containing greater than 1 x 106 cells/mL. Invalid or failed tests occurred in samples
containing 1 x 107 PBMC cells/mL presumably due to sample viscosity.
Limitations are included in the package insert describing each endogenous substance that
demonstrated interference with the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test.
Potentially interfering endogenous substances and matrices tested are described in the
following table. Concentrations in urine samples were determined using total sample
volume, including stabilizing media.

i. Carry over/contamination
CT/NG Workflow: Sample-to-sample cross-contamination and run-to-run carryover
studies were performed using the CT/NG Workflow with samples in cobas PCR media
and urine stabilized in cobas PCR Media. Two runs consisting of a checkerboard pattern
of high-positive CT and NG samples alternating with negative samples were performed
on each of three cobas 4800 Systems. Contrived samples were prepared by spiking high
concentrations of CT and NG cultures into each matrix such that analyte concentrations
would be higher than found in 95% of specimens of infected individuals in the intended
use population. Study results for the CT/NG Workflow yielded a sample-to-sample cross
contamination rate of 1.07% (6/562) and a run-to-run carry over rate of 0.18% (1/563).
CT/NG Cytology Workflow: Three additional runs were performed on each of three
cobas 4800 Systems using the CT/NG Cytology Workflow using contrived samples in
PreservCyt Solution. Again, specimens were tested in a checkerboard configuration of
high-positive CT and NG specimens alternating with negative samples. The CT/NG
Cytology Workflow gave a sample-to-sample cross-contamination rate of 1.18% (5/423)
and a run-to-run carry over rate of 0.0% (0/280).
ThinPrep 2000 Workflow: The rate of sample-to-sample cross-contamination events
during routine processing of PreservCyt specimens on the ThinPrep 2000 liquid cytology
processor was performed using alternating CT/NG negative and CT/NG high-positive
samples. After cytology processing, the PreservCyt samples were then tested with the
cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test. False positive results occurred in two of 427 CT/NG negative
samples, resulting in a cross-contamination rate of 0.81%.

j. Assay cut-off:
The assay cutoff (Ct value = 45) for the cobas CT/NG Test (K110923) that was validated
for the initial clearance of the assay was also selected for the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test.
The chosen cutoff was subsequently validated for the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test by
analyzing all results from the pivotal clinical study and selected analytical studies. All
specimen types were included in the analysis. The distribution of Ct values for positive
specimens was analyzed and it was determined that the chosen cutoff is acceptable due to
the evidence of a clear distinction between positive and negative results for all specimen
types. The following graphs illustrate the distribution of Ct values from the clinical study.

k. Competitive Inhibition Studies
Panels were prepared by spiking CT and NG cultures into pooled vaginal specimen
matrix collected in cobas PCR Media, pooled urine matrix stabilized in cobas PCR
Media and pooled cervical specimen matrix collected in PreservCyt Solution at various

concentration levels to examine the potential for competitive inhibition. Panels were
tested in two runs per day over the course of 12 days. Two replicates of each panel
member were tested in every run, generating a maximum of 48 test results for each level
and CT and NG strain respectively. All CT and NG hit rates were 100% for all panel
levels in all sample matrices tested. Competitive inhibition was not seen in any
combination of CT and NG levels in any of the three sample matrices tested. Average Ct
values for each of the panel levels are summarized in the table below.

3. Clinical studies:
The clinical performance of the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test was established in two multi-
center clinical studies conducted in the United States. One clinical study included testing
of archived endocervical specimens, self-collected and clinician collected vaginal
specimens and urine specimens from symptomatic and asymptomatic males and females,
initially collected prospectively during the clinical evaluation of the cobas CT/NG Test
(K110923). The current study included testing of all available prospectively collected
specimens stored at 2-8ºC since the original study.
The second clinical study included only asymptomatic female subjects and the following

four prospectively collected and tested fresh specimens: endocervical specimens,
clinician-collected vaginal specimens, cervical specimens in PreservCyt Solution, and
female urines.
For both clinical studies, specimen collection took place at 18 collection sites in the US,
which included family planning and obstetrics/gynecology (OB/GYN) clinics, and
sexually transmitted disease clinics. Testing was performed at seven laboratory sites.
Each female subject provided a urine specimen, a self-collected or clinician-collected
vaginal swab, a clinician-collected endocervical swab, and a cervical specimen in
PreserCyt solution obtained with a spatula/cytobrush or a broom. Aliquots of urine and
cervical specimens in PreserCyt as well as a second endocervical swab were placed in the
respective transport media for determination of patient infected status (PIS) using two
commercially available nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT).
Each male subject provided a urine specimen in cobas PCR media and urine and urethral
swab specimens in collection media from two commercially available NAAT assays.
Subjects were classified as symptomatic if they reported symptoms indicative of CT or
NG infection, as listed below. Subjects were classified as asymptomatic if they did not
report these symptoms.
· Dysuria/pain during urination, coital pain/difficulty/bleeding, discharge, or pelvic
pain
· Abnormal vaginal discharge
· Pelvic/uterine/ovarian pain
· Urethral discharge, testicular pain/scrotal pain/swelling
The clinical performance of the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test was evaluated by comparing the
results from collected sample types to a pre-specified PIS algorithm as determined by
combined results from two commercially available NAATs. The PIS algorithms for
female and male patients are shown in the following two tables.

Primary objectives of the study included the evaluation the sensitivity (SENS), specificity
(SPEC), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the
cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test for detection of CT or NG using PIS as the reference standard.
Results were stratified by gender, sample type, and symptom status. Predictive values
were calculated based on sensitivity and specificity with all data combined for a range of
hypothetical prevalence values.
Of the 6,045 subjects enrolled (5,306 females and 739 males), ten were excluded from
the analyses because they did not meet study entry criteria or because they withdrew
consent; 31 were considered non-evaluable and were excluded from all statistical
analyses because of errors in specimen collection, transport, storage, unknown PIS for
both CT and NG, or invalid cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test results after initial testing and/or
retesting. Therefore, of 6,035 total eligible subjects enrolled, 6,004 (99.5%) were
evaluable for CT and/or NG primary analyses (5,266 females and 738 males). Results
obtained from 1,011 prospectively tested specimens from female asymptomatic subjects
were analyzed combined with results obtained in the re-testing of archived specimens
collected in the previous clinical study (archived specimens collected from 4,255 females
and 738 males).

In both clinical studies, there was 1/385 (0.3%) invalid runs and 15/385 (3.9%) failed
runs due to instrument errors. Of the 26,283 specimens tested with the cobas CT/NG v2.0
Test, 0.28% and 0.23% were initially invalid for CT and NG respectively and 1.38%
initially had failed results for both CT and NG. Following retesting up to two more times,
0.10% and 0.13% had final results of invalid for CT and NG respectively and 0.14% had
final failed results for both CT and NG.
Clinical Study Results for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT)
The following two tables summarize the results from symptomatic and asymptomatic
female and male subjects designated as infected or non-infected with CT according to the
PIS algorithm. A total of 365 females and 122 males were infected with CT. Symptoms
were reported in 44.4% (162/365) of infected and 37.0% (1,814/4,900) of non-infected
women. Similarly, symptoms were reported in 57.4% (70/122) of infected and 33.8%
(208/616) of non-infected men. Overall, the CT prevalence was 6.9% (365/5,265), 16.5%
(122/738), and 8.1% (487/6,003) in women, men, and the entire study population,
respectively.

d cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test results from prospectively collected specimens.
Note: Subjects are designated as being infected with CT if at least 2 NAATs with different target regions give
positive results in the endocervical swab (urethral swab for males) and/or the urine specimen. However, females
are categorized as non-infected for any swab specimen if the swab specimens and the PreservCyt specimen
(NAAT2) were negative and the urine specimens were positive.
Note: CI = (score) confidence interval, PREV = prevalence, SENS = sensitivity, SPEC = specificity,

Clinical Study Results for Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG)
The following two tables summarize the results from symptomatic and asymptomatic
female and male subjects designated as infected or non-infected with NG according to the
PIS algorithm. A total of 92 females and 67 males were infected with NG. Symptoms
were reported in 46.7% (43/92) of infected and 37.4% (1,932/5,171) of non-infected
women. Similarly, symptoms were reported in 89.6% (60/67) of infected and 32.5%
(218/671) of non-infected men. Overall, the NG prevalence was 1.7% (92/5,263), 9.1%
(67/738), and 2.6% (159/6,001), respectively, in women, men, and the entire study
population.

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
For the various collection sites in the multi-center clinical study, the prevalence of CT
observed with the cobas CG/NG v2.0 Test ranged from 5.0% to 8.9% in females, and
from 11.3% to 25.2% in males. The prevalence for NG ranged from 0.9% to 2.3% in
females and from 1.5% to 21.6% in males.
The following two tables illustrate hypothetical positive and negative predictive values
for the detection of CT and NG with the cobas CT/NG v2.0 Test for potential prevalence
of 1 to 50 %. The overall sensitivity and specificity used for these calculations were
derived from the clinical study results for all specimen types combined.
