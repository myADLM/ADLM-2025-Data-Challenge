SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification
Decision Summary
To: SA Scientific RE: K132352
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own
Class II devices requiring 510(k)s. The following items are present and acceptable
1. The names and 510(k) numbers of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared devices:
Trade Names: SAS™ Influenza A Test
SAS™ FluAlert A & B Test
510(k) numbers: K041441
K080380
2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USES of the modified devices as described
in their labeling HAVE NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions
for use, package labeling.
3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S). The modification presented in this 510(k) consisted
of expanded analytical sensitivity (limit of detection; LoD) tables to include reactivity
information for the H7N9 influenza A virus. The ability of the SAS Influenza A Test and the SAS
FluAlert A & B Test to detect H7N9 influenza A virus was tested using the (A/Anhui/1/2013) strain
obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as non-infectious beta-propiolactone
inactivated virus. An LoD study was performed with the A/Anhui/1/2013 influenza strain at
concentrations:
· 5x107 EID /mL
50
· 1x108 EID /mL
50
· 2x108 EID /mL
50
The LoD was determined to be 1x108 EID /mL.
50
The package inserts for the SAS Influenza A Test and the SAS FluAlert A & B Test have been
updated to include the additional analytical reactivity information
4. The FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified devices has not changed.
5. Comparison Information (similarities and differences) to applicant’s legally marketed predicate
devices including, labeling, intended use, and physical characteristics:

*This viral strain was obtained from the CDC with a known titer. SA Scientific, Ltd. did not
verify this titer.
2) The package inserts for the SAS Influenza A Test (K041441) and the SAS FluAlert A & B Test
(K080380) have been updated to include the following statement in the limitations section:
Performance characteristics for detecting the 2009 H1N1 and 2013 H7N9 influenza viruses
from human specimens have not been established.
3) The package insert for the SAS Influenza A Test (K041441) has been updated to include the
following information in the analytical sensitivity (LoD) section:
This test has been shown to detect the Flu A/California/04/09 (H1N1) and Flu A/Anhui/1/2013
viruses cultured from a positive human specimen; however, the performance characteristics
of this test with clinical specimens that are positive for the 2009 H1N1 and 2013 H7N9
influenza virus have not been established. The SAS Influenza A Test can detect influenza A
viruses, but cannot differentiate influenza subtypes.
4) The package insert for the SAS FluAlert A & B Test (K080380) has been updated to include
the following information in the analytical sensitivity (LoD) section:
This test has been shown to detect the Flu A/California/04/09 (H1N1) and Flu A/Anhui/1/2013
viruses cultured from a positive human specimen; however, the performance characteristics
of this test with clinical specimens that are positive for the 2009 H1N1 and 2013 H7N9
influenza virus have not been established. The SAS FluAlert A & B Test can distinguish
between influenza A and B viruses, but cannot differentiate influenza subtypes.
5) The package insert for the SAS FluAlert A & B Test (K080380) has been updated to include
the following information in the cross reactivity section:
Influenza A H7N9 A/Anhui/1/2013 – 2013759189 – 1.00x109 EID /mL – Neg (for cross

reactivity with the “B” portion of the SAS FluAlert A & B Test)
6. Design Control Activities Summary:
1) Analytical Reactivity Testing was conducted as described in section 3, Device Modifications.
2) Declaration of Conformity
A “Declaration of Conformity” statement was submitted for the manufacturing facility and validation
activities and signed by the Quality Assurance/Regulatory Affairs Specialist. The statements indicate
that:
a) The manufacturing facility, SA Scientific, Ltd. is in conformance with the design control
requirements as specified in 21 CFR 820.30 and the records are available for review.
b) To the best of my knowledge, the verification activities, as required by the risk analysis, for the
modification were performed by the designated individual(s) and the results demonstrated that
the predetermined acceptance criteria were met.

In conclusion, based on the results of the analytical reactivity testing the modified labeling is truthful
and accurate. The changes do not affect the performance of the tests and, therefore, they are
substantially equivalent to the currently cleared tests.
7. A Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary, and the Indications for
Use Enclosure.
The labeling for the modified subject devices has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended
uses for the devices are unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the
particular modification and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices
demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. On this basis, I
recommend that the devices are determined to be substantially equivalent to the previously cleared
devices.
