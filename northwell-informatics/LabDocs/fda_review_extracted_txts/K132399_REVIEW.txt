L. Test Principle:
Creatininase hydrolyzes creatinine in sample to creatine. Creatine is hydrolyzed by
creatinase to sarcosine and urea. Sarcosine is then oxidized by sarcosine oxidase to produce
hydrogen peroxide (H O ). H O reacts with 4-amino-antipyrine (4-AAP) and EHSPT (N-
2 2 2 2
Ethyl-N-2(-Hydroxy-3-Sulfopropyl)-m- Toluidine) under the catalytic action of peroxidase to
form a colored quinoneimine. The absorbance of the quinoneimine at 546 nm is proportional
to the concentration of creatinine in the sample.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed by assaying three serum pools at 3 concentrations over 20
operating days, on two Selectra PROM analyzers and with two lots of reagent. Assay runs
were performed twice per day and each sample was tested in duplicate. Calibration was
performed for each run. The results are summarized below:
Serum

(mg/dL) SD CV(%) SD CV(%)
pool 1 80 0.76 0.01 1.2 0.01 1.9

pool 2 80 159 1 0.7 4 2.3
pool 3 80 308 6 1.9 9 2.9
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study across the claimed assay range was performed by preparing samples
from patient serum pools at a low creatinine concentration and a high concentration.
The low pool contained serum diluted with albumin/NaCl (6 g/dL/0.9%). Eleven
samples in all were assayed in triplicate
The expected values were plotted against the observed values and a linear regression
line was fitted with the following regression equation:

URINE CONTROL BI –LEVEL
Value Assignment
The target value is determined by the median of 80 results from 2 Selectra ProM
analyzers. The median is acceptable to the sponsor when percentage deviation is less
than 10%.
Calibration frequency
Stability across a 14-day calibration interval was assessed by calculating the percentage
bias of 2 urine control specimens on each day from the result obtained on day 0. The
results support the calibration interval claims of 14 days. The sponsor also noted in the
labeling that a recalibration is recommended when reagent lots change, and when quality
control results fall outside the range established, and after a maintenance operation.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) were determined following CLSI
guideline EP17-A. For LoB determination, albumin/NaCl (6 g/dL/0.9%) was used as
the zero sample and assayed 60 times on 2 selectra ProM analyzers. For LoD
determination, 4 diluted serum or urine samples with creatinine concentrations
between LoB and 4 * LoB were assayed 15 times for each sample (N = 60).
For LoQ determination, 4 low concentration samples were prepared by saline dilution
and were assayed 15 times each (N = 60). The CV% and the SD at each tested
concentration were calculated. The sponsor’s acceptable total error for the
determination Limit of Quantification is ≤ 0.02 and 4 mg/dL for serum and urine,
respectively. If the confidence interval is within the acceptable total error limits, then
the Limit of Quantification is acceptable.

Summary:
Based on the limit of quantitation determined in this study (see result in the below
table) and the result from the linearity study in M1.b., the sponsor’s labeling claims a
measuring range of 0.1 to 30 mg/dL for serum and 5 to 450 mg/dL for urine..

Serum 0.01 0.02 0.08
Urine 0.2 0.5 2.0
e. Analytical specificity:
Testing for interfering substances was based on CLSI EP-7A. Testing was performed on
a minimum of six concentrations for each interfering substance. Two different clinically
relevant concentrations of creatinine (1.50 and 5.00 mg/dL) were used for evaluation.
Samples with increasing amounts of potential interferents were tested in triplicate and
compared to a control sample without the interferent.
The sponsor defined non-significant interference as the highest level tested that does not
cause ≥ ±10% change between the tested samples and the control sample.
