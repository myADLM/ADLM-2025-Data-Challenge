The Element™ V Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for the quantitative
measurement of glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood from the finger, palm,
hand, upper-arm, forearm, calf, and thigh. The Element™ V Blood Glucose
Monitoring System is intended to be used by a single patient and should not be
shared.
The Element™ V Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for testing outside
the body (in vitro diagnostic use) by people with diabetes at home as an aid to
monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control. It should not be used for the diagnosis
of or screening for diabetes and/or for neonatal use. Alternative site testing should be
done only during steady–state times (when glucose is not changing rapidly).
The Element™ V test strips are for use with the Element™ V meter to quantitatively
measure glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood. Fresh capillary whole blood
samples may be drawn from the fingertips, ventral palm, dorsal hand, upper arm,
forearm, calf and/or thigh.
The Element™ V control solutions are for use with the Element™ V meter and the
Element™ V test strips to check that the meter and test strips are working together
properly and the test is performing correctly.
This meter contains some speaking functions but has not been validated for use by the
visually impaired. By adding the voice function, users can hear test results, setting
conditions and warning messages (errors) while performing the test. This added
function is intended to aid users for their convenience.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
• For over-the-counter use
• Not for neonatal use
• Not for screening or diagnosis of diabetes mellitus
• Not for use on critically ill patients, patients in shock, dehydrated patients or
hyper-osmolar patients
• For single-patient use only
• Alternative site testing (AST) testing should only be done during steady-state
times (when glucose is not changing rapidly).
• AST should not be used to calibrate continuous glucose monitors (CGMs).
• AST should not be used for insulin dose calculations.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Element V Blood Glucose Meter
I. Device Description:
The proposed Element™ V Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of a Element™ V
Blood glucose meter, Element™ V test strips, Element™ V control solutions, Level 1, 2
and 3,, a reusable lancing device and lancets. The components will be marketed in the

--- Page 3 ---
following package options. The users can buy a system kit which includes all the
components (meter, strips, 1 level of control solution, manual, log book, warranty card,
quick reference guide, carrying bag, lancing device, and lancet), the meter package
(meter, manual, warranty card) strip package (strips, manual, quick reference guide),
control solution package (control solution, manual) and also, the meter, the strips and the
control solutions can be purchased separately. The system can be used with GlucoDiary
(k130181) a PC-based diabetes management system.
Element V glucose control solution was previously cleared under k130181, as GluNeo
Control Solutions. There are 3 levels of controls with glucose concentrations of level 1 -
50 mg/dL, level 2 - 100 mg/dL, and 300 mg/dL. Control solutions contain known
concentrations of glucose, stabilizers, buffers, preservatives and dyes.

c. Traceability, Stability (21 CFR § 211.166), Expected values (controls,
calibrators, or methods):
Test Strip Stability:
The sponsor provided a real-time testing protocol and acceptance criteria to verify the
closed- (shelf life) and open-vial stability of the test strips. The stability protocols and
acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor claims a
closed-vial (shelf life) of 24 months and open-vial stability of 6 months when stored
at 35.6 – 86 °F and 20 - 60 percent relative humidity.
Traceability: The assay is traceable to NIST SRM 917b reference material.
Glucose control value assignment and stability: The glucose controls are the
same as the controls in k130181, except in product name. Value assignment and
stability were established in k051285. Unopened controls have a 24 month shelf
life and are stable for 3 months after first use when stored at 46 – 86 °F.
d. Detection limit:
See section M.1.b (linearity)
The reportable range is 20 to 600 mg/dL based on linearity/reportable range studies
above. The low and high detection limits for this device have been set at 20 and 600
mg/dL. Readings below 20 mg/dL and above 600 mg/dL will indicate a “Lo” and
“Hi” on the meter display, respectively.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference
An interference study was performed to evaluate the effects of endogenous and
exogenous substances on the glucose test results generated by the Element V Blood
Glucose Monitoring System. Three glucose levels were achieved (53, 149, and
306 mg/dL) by collecting venous blood samples into tubes containing EDTA.
Four levels of potential interferents were aliquotted into samples. The control pool
(without an interfering compound) and 4 test pools were measured on five meters
using one test strip lot. The bias was calculated by subtracting the mean control value
from the interferent level mean value. The results are summarized below to show the
highest concentration without significant interference (defined by the sponsor as ±10
mg/dL <75 mg/dL and ±10% ≥75 mg/dL).

System Accuracy
To assess system accuracy, results from the Element V Blood Glucose
Monitoring System were compared to a reference method, YSI. Finger
capillary samples collected by healthcare professionals from 100 participants
with glucose concentrations ranging from 27 – 592 mg/dL (according to
reference) were tested using three test strip lots. To obtain blood glucose
concentrations <50 mg/dL and > 400 mg/dL, samples were allowed to glycolize
or were spiked to achieve the desired glucose concentration. Ten samples were
altered (5 glycolyzed, 5 spiked). The results relative to YSI are summarized
in the tables below:

User Performance Study
To assess the performance of the Element V Blood Glucose Monitoring System in
the hands of the lay-users, the sponsor performed a study with 231 lay-user
participants, who collected 231 finger capillary samples using only English-
written labeling materials with no other instructions or coaching. Results from
two test strip lots and 6 meters were analyzed by comparing blood glucose results
from the Element V meter obtained by the lay-user against the YSI reference
value. The glucose concentration of the samples ranged from 57 to 417 mg/dL as
measured by YSI. The results are summarized in the tables below:

230 lay-user participants, who collected 230 capillary samples from the dorsal hand, ventral
palm, upper-arm, forearm, thigh and calf using only English-written labeling materials with no
other instructions or coaching. Glucose concentrations ranging from 65 – 400 mg/dL (according
to reference) were tested using six test strip lots. The results relative to YSI are summarized in

2. Software
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes
for this line of product types:
Yes ___X___ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied
directly to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger,
dorsal hand, ventral palm, forearm, upper-arm, calf and thigh only. The whole blood
sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.
5. Calibration:
The meter is an auto-coding meter. No coding is required by the user. The user is
required to verify that the code displayed on the meter and read off the test strip
accurately reflects the code on the test strip vial.
6. Quality Control:
Three levels of control glucose solution are available. One level is included with the
meter as a kit and 3 levels are sold separately. The user has to change the setting on
the meter to identify a control sample so that the result is not inappropriately saved
as a patient result.
O. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
The
1. Hematocrit Study: The effect of different hematocrit levels on the performance of the
Element V Blood Glucose System was evaluated using venous whole blood samples
with hematocrit levels 20, 30, 42, 50, and 60 %, and spiked or glycolyzed to achieve 6
glucose concentrations ranging from 28 to 568 mg/dL (28, 46, 66, 121, 181, 258, 368,
432, 521, and 568 mg/dL). Each sample was then tested 15 times using 15 Element V
meters and one lot of test strips. The meter values were compared with those obtained
from average YSI analyzer values. The biases relative to YSI were found to
acceptable within the claimed hematocrit range of 20 to 60%.
2. Altitude study: Venous whole blood samples collected and adjusted to obtain 9
glucose concentrations of 44, 67, 118, 229, 268, 345, 402, 451, and 551 mg/dL were
tested at the following conditions in an altitude chamber which evaluated both oxygen
as well as pressure effects at sea level and 10,000 feet above sea level. The study
included 5 meters and 1 test strip lot. Results were compared to YSI values. The
results demonstrate acceptable bias and indicate acceptable performance to the claimed
altitude of 10,000 ft.
3. Temperature and Humidity studies: The sponsor performed temperature and humidity
studies using venous blood samples with glucose concentrations of 40, 116, 326
17

--- Page 18 ---
mg/dL to evaluate temperatures ranging from 10 to 40 °C (50 to 104 ºF) and relative
humidity from 10% to 90%. Meter results were compared to YSI values. Four
temperature and humidity combinations were tested including low temperature/low
humidity, low temperature/high humidity, high temperature/low humidity, and high
temperature/high humidity. No significant bias (relative to YSI) was observed with
the temperature and humidity combinations tested. The results support a temperature
claim of 10 to 40 °C (50 to 104 ºF) and relative humidity from 10% to 90%.
4. Sample Volume: The sponsor performed a study to verify the test strip minimum
sample volume requirement (0.3 µL) and the test strip fill error requirement
established for the Element V Blood Glucose Monitoring System. The sponsor
provided adequate software validation for the feature. Blood samples with glucose
concentrations of 37, 66, 133, 256, and 464 mg/dL were tested at five sample volumes
(0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 µL). Values obtained were compared to YSI values.
Results support the claimed minimum sample volume of 0.3 mL.
5. Readability Evaluation: Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the
results demonstrated that the User Manual, test strip package insert and control
solution instruction for use were written at the 8th grade level or below.
6. Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC): Testing was performed by SK Tech Co., Ltd.
The test report stated conformance to IEC 61326-1:2005, IEC 61326-2-6:2005
7. Infection Control Studies:
The system is intended for single-patient use only. CaviWipes (EPA registration
#46781-8) were validated through disinfection efficacy studies demonstrating
complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) using materials comprising the
meter. Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that
there was no change in performance or in the external materials of the meter after
1,098 cleaning and disinfection cycles (one cycle includes one cleaning wipe plus one
disinfecting wipe) to simulate 3 years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for
adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
8. Software documentation was reviewed and demonstrated that the device was
developed under appropriate software lifecycle processes. The following
documentation related to the software was reviewed and found to be acceptable: level
of concern, software description, device hazard analysis, software requirements
specifications, software design specification, software development environment
description, traceability, and verification and validation testing.
P. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
Q. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
