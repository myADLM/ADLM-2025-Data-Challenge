I. Device Description:
The BD VeritorTM System RSV test is a chromatographic immunoassay with an
instrumented read for the qualitative detection of Respiratory Syncytial Virus antigen (RSV
fusion protein) directly from a nasopharyngeal swab. It utilizes lateral flow technology and a
simple optical reflectance reader. The device utilizes monoclonal antibodies for detection and
capture of the RSV antigen. Each test strip is designed with spatially-distinct zones
containing a positive and negative internal control. The positive control zone ensures that the
sample has flowed correctly, and the negative control zone serves to address non-specific
signal generation. When specimens areprocessed and added to the test device, RSV antigen
2

--- Page 3 ---
in the specimen binds to anti-RSV antibodies conjugated to detector particles in the RSV test
strip. The antigen-conjugate complex migrates across the test strip to the reaction area and is
captured by the line of RSV antibody on the membrane. A positive result for RSV is
determined by the BD Veritor System Reader (purchased separately) when antigen-conjugate
is deposited at the Test “T” position and the Control "C" position on the BD Veritor System
RSV assay device. The BD Veritor™ System Reader determines the line intensity at each of
the spatially-defined control zones and utilizes specific algorithms to determine the presence
or absence of any target analyte. The total assay time is approximately 10 minutes with
reactivity determined by the optical reflectance reader.
The BD VeritorTM System for Detection of RSV kit consists of (a) 30 pouched devices, each
containing one test strip, (b) 30 tubes, each containing 400 μL of RV Reagent D (a detergent
solution), 30 flexible mini tip flocked swabs and one each of positive and negative external
controls.
The test procedure instructs the user on proper collection of a nasopharyngeal swab. The
patient specimen (a nasopharyngeal swab) is inserted and mixed in a prefilled unitized tube
containing RV Reagent D (an extraction reagent) and added to the test device. RV Reagent D
contains mucolytic agents that function to break down mucus in a patient specimen thereby
exposing viral antigens and enhancing detection in the assay device. The swab is then
removed and 3 drops of the tube contents are dispensed into the sample well of the device.
The test is allowed to stand at room temperature for 10 minutes after which time it is inserted
into the reader.
The System Reader provides results on the screen. The following 3 results may be obtained.

L. Test Principle:
The BD Veritor™ System RSV test is a chromatographic immunoassay where RSV viral
antigens in the patient sample bind to anti-RSV antibodies conjugated to detector particles on
the test strip. The antigen-conjugate complex migrates across the test strip to the reaction
area and is captured by an antibody line imbedded on the membrane. The assay utilizes a
proprietary enhanced colloidal-gold particle at the test lines as the means for identifying the
presence of RSV viral antigens. The test devices are designed with four spatially-distinct
zones including positive and negative control lines, a test line for the target analyte, and a
background zone. The test line for the target analyte is labeled on the test device as ‘T’ for
test position. The onboard positive control ensures the sample has flowed correctly and is
indicated on the test device as ‘C’. Two of the four distinct zones on the test device are not
labeled. These two zones are an onboard negative control line and an assay background zone.
The onboard negative control zone (not labeled on the test device) addresses non-specific
signal generation. The remaining zone is used to measure the assay background and is also
not labeled. The BD Veritor™ System RSV assay incorporates an active negative control

feature in each test to identify and compensate for sample-related, nonspecific signal
generation. The BD Veritor™ System Reader uses a proprietary algorithm which subtracts
nonspecific signal at the negative control line from the signal present at the test line. If the
resultant test line signal is above a pre-selected assay cutoff, the specimen is scored as
positive. If the resultant test line signal is below the cutoff, the specimen is scored as
negative. The BD Veritor™ System Reader measures the amount of light reflected from
various zones along the assay strip. The measurement of the assay background zone is also
evaluated as the reflectance is compared to that of the control and test zones. The instrument
analyzes the reflectance data to provide the proper interpretation.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
An analytical study was conducted over a period of 12 days to evaluate repeatability
of the BD Veritor RSV test when used by two different operators. The test samples
were prepared in a stabilizing liquid buffer at target concentrations of RSV to
generate positive observation rates of approximately 5% (high negative), 95% (low
positive) and 100% (moderate positive). The reproducibility samples were prepared
by drying the liquid viral samples onto swabs. A negative swab sample was also
included. Each day, each operator tested a group of 8 swab samples that were blinded
and randomized and included negatives and positives (~5% positive, ~95% positive
and 100% positive). The following table summarizes the results.

Another study was conducted over a period of 5 days to evaluate reproducibility of
the BD Veritor RSV test across 3 testing sites; one site was a clinical laboratory while
the other two were point-of-care sites. The samples were prepared in the same manner
as above for the precision study. Two operators at each site tested a panel of 12
samples each day. The panel consisted of 3 replicates of each nominal concentration.
The panels were masked and randomized. The percent of positive samples with the
95% confidence intervals (CI) for each panel member are shown below.

d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection for the BD Veritor™ RSV test was determined for five RSV
strains. Initially 10-fold serial dilutions of RSV in saline were prepared and each was
tested in triplicate to find the lowest level detectable by three readers. Further
characterization was performed using closely spaced dilutions. The final LoD, a
concentration producing 95% positivity, was confirmed by testing 60 replicates.

To demonstrate that the LoD findings were not influenced by matrix effects, the
sponsor conducted a matrix equivalence study by testing two RSV strains in dilutions
near the established LoD, using (1) saline, (2) BD Universal Transport Media (UTM),
and (3) negative clinical wash/aspirate sample matrix. There were 20 replicates of
each dilution tested with the BD Veritor RSV test.

The observed rate of positivity for VR-26 (Long Subgroup A) RSV strain at
concentrations close to the established LoD (95% positivity rate), based on 20
replicates, ranged from 85% to 100% in both, the clinical matrix and UTM. Similarly,
the observed rate of positivity for VR-955 (9320 Subgroup B) RSV strain at
concentrations close to the established LoD ranged from 85% to 100% in clinical
matrix and from 70% to100% in UTM. These results suggest that there is no
significant matrix effect on the assay performance at concentrations near LoD.
e. Analytical specificity:
The BD Veritor for RSV test was evaluated for potential cross-reactivity with other
microorganisms. Various bacteria, viruses and yeast were tested at clinically relevant
concentrations. All determinations were performed in triplicate with no cross
reactivity observed for any of the tested organisms. The results are shown below.

g. Specimen stability:
The BD Veritor for RSV test is intended to be used with nasopharyngeal samples
immediately after collection. However, since a delay in testing may occur in real life
situations, the sponsor conducted a sample stability study to allow for such
circumstances. In this study, RSV strains Long (A) and 9320 (B) were used to spike
swabs at viral loads near the LoD. The swabs were held at room temperature and
were sampled at 0.5 hr intervals from 0 hours up to 2 hours after being spiked. All
swabs tested as positive at all-time points for both strains and no deterioration of
signal was observed. These results support the decision to allow patient testing to be
conducted for up to 1 hour after collection of the NP swab.
h. Assay cut-off:
The output of the BD Veritor Reader is provided in arbitrary units (AU) measuring
reflectance. A “zero” AU signal is assigned when reading a white surface and 100
AU is the maximum signal that the Reader can provide. The assay cutoff was initially
evaluated using negative specimens (with determined zero concentration of analyte)
to assess the inherent noise level of the system which was determined to be
approximately 0.4-0.5 AU. Additional measurements of contrived samples with
concentrations near the cutoff plus leftover clinical samples were used to estimate a
preliminary assay cutoff to be 1.5 AU (3 X 0.5 AU). Following an ROC analysis of
the results, the final assay cutoff was determined to achieve optimal balance between
maximal sensitivity without compromising the specificity. The selected assay cutoff
was ultimately validated with clinical positive and negative samples in the clinical
study. The results provided to the user are qualitative for any valid result, either
positive or negative.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
See clinical studies below.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable.
3. Clinical studies:
Performance characteristics of the BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of RSV test
were evaluated in a multi-center prospective study across eight geographically diverse
testing sites using nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs collected from patients with signs and
symptoms consistent with respiratory tract infection. The study was conducted between
November 2012 and June 2013. A total of 540 patients were enrolled in the clinical study
of which 17 were excluded due to protocol deviations, leaving 523 specimens to be
included in the calculations of estimates of assay performance. All specimens were
collected from patients < 6 years of age. Of those, 58.3% (305) were from subjects < 2
years old and 41.7% (218) were from patients 2-5 years of age. There were 223 (42.6%)
females and 300 (57.4%) males. Informed consent was obtained for all patients prior to
testing. Two NP swabs were collected sequentially, one swab from each nostril, from
each subject. One swab was placed into transport media for reference testing. The other
swab was either placed in an empty tube until ready for testing, or tested immediately on
the BD Veritor™ System. The order of swabs used for reference testing vs. the direct
testing with the device was randomized. The direct testing with the BD Veritor device
was intended to be completed immediately. If the sample could not be tested
immediately, it was held at room temperature (20-25°C) for no longer than one hour prior
to testing. The reference testing consisted of RSV viral culture and PCR testing (using the
remaining specimen) with an FDA cleared molecular test for RSV.
.Clinical Performance
The performance of the BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of RSV test with NP
swabs was estimated based on the comparison with results from viral cell culture
(sensitivity and specificity) as well as in comparison with the results obtained by a PCR
comparator method (positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement
(NPA)).

Among the 523 tests performed with the BD Veritor RSV test, there was one invalid
result. The overall invalid rate was calculated to be 0.2% (95% CI: 0.0%, 1.1%).
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The rate of positivity observed in RSV testing will vary depending on the method of
specimen collection, handling/transport system employed, detection method utilized, time
of year, age of the patient, and disease prevalence. The overall prevalence of RSV
infection observed during the time the BD Veritor RSV trial was 25.6% when determined
by the results obtained with cell culture, or 34.2% when determined by the results
obtained with PCR. The prevalence observed at each testing site during the study,
depending on the reference method, is shown below.

O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Veritor™ System Reader is a small, battery powered, bench top instrument that is
used to read the Veritor lateral flow test cassette. After the extracted patient sample has
been added to the test cassette, the test is developed at room temperature for 10 minutes.
The cassette is then placed into the reader where it is scanned. The cassette is divided into
distinct zones where the analyzer reads the negative background, positive control, and the
Influenza A and B specific zones. The reader applies an algorithm to determine the
background of the test as well as the specific signal from the A or B test zones. The
reader has a finite number of reads and will prompt the end-user as the total number of
reads approaches the lifetime of the unit.
2. Software:
The Veritor™ System Reader is the identical instrument that has been reviewed and
cleared with the BD influenza A and B assay K112277. FDA has conducted an additional
review of the applicant’s instrument Hazard Analysis and software development
processes associated with this specific device, the BD Veritor System for RSV.

5. Calibration:
The Veritor Reader is not configurable by the end user and is designed to have a finite
lifetime based on number of tests performed or shelf life from date of manufacture.
Device calibration is not required, however, a verification cartridge is provided with the
reader to perform a functional test of the reader.
6. Quality Control:
The Quality Control testing during the clinical trial was performed each day of testing at
each site using the external Positive and Negative control swabs. A functional check of
the Reader with the cartridge verification was also performed daily. The summary of QC
results is shown below.
