L. Test Principle:
Blood Urea Nitrogen: Urea is degraded by urease into ammonia. When glutamate
dehydrogenase (GLD) reacts with ammonia and alfa-ketoglutaric acid to produce glutamic
acid, NADPH is converted into NADP with a decrease of absorbance at 340 nm. The
concentration of urea nitrogen can be determined by measuring the amount of change in
absorbance.
Creatinine: As the first reaction, creatine in samples is decomposed into water and oxygen
by the action of creatinase, sarcosine oxidase, and catalase. Subsequently, as the second
reaction, creatinine in samples is converted into creatine by the action of creatininase, and
then sarcosine is formed by creatinase. After that, the quinone pigment is formed by
oxidation condensation between N,N-Bis (4-sulfobutyl)-3-methylaniline disodium salt
(TODB) and 4-aminoantipyrine in the presence of peroxidase (POD) and hydrogen
peroxide is formed by sarcosine oxidase. The concentration of creatinine can be determined
by measuring the absorbance of the resulting quinone pigment (purple-red).

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies for the S TEST Reagent Cartridge BUN were performed following
CLSI EP5-A2 with three levels of analytes (low, middle and high) and one
instrument. Serum samples were tested in duplicate, twice a day, for 20 days for a
total of 80 results per level. The samples were neat serum samples. Results for BUN
precision are summarized below:
Mean Within Run Total
Analyte Sample
(mg/dL) SD %CV SD %CV
Low 7.24 0.22 3.0 0.36 5.0
BUN
Middle 14.07 0.23 1.6 0.38 2.7
High 49.05 0.58 1.2 1.13 2.3
Precision studies for the S TEST Reagent Cartridge CRE were performed following
CLSI EP5-A2 with four levels of analytes (low, middle, high and very high) and one
instrument. Serum samples were tested in duplicate, twice a day, for 20 days for a
total of 80 results per level. The samples were archived (stored frozen) patient serum
samples. Results for creatinine precision are summarized below:
Mean Within Run Total
Analyte Sample

High 6.55 0.08 1.2 0.19 2.9
Very High 20.34 0.18 0.9 0.29 1.4
Precision was evaluated at three POL sites. BUN was evaluated using 6 lots of reagent
and Creatinine was evaluated using 3 lots. Each site received three blinded serum
samples (A, B, C) that were chosen to represent low, intermediate, and high
concentrations of the analytes. Each sample was assayed six times per day for 5 days
resulting in 30 results per level. The BUN samples were a combination of neat and
spiked specimens. The Creatinine samples were commercial controls. The results are
listed below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The claimed measuring range for BUN is 1.5 - 80 mg/dL. The linearity of the BUN
assay was assessed following CLSI EP6-A with commercially available linearity sets
which include 7 samples (0. 9 to 110.0 mg/dL). All samples were tested in duplicate
on one Hitachi Clinical Analyzer E40. Recoveries were within ±10% or 2.5 mg/dL.
The summary of the linear regression analysis of the data is below:
y=0.9548x+0.6168; R2=0.9977
The BUN assay data demonstrates linearity between 0.9 mg/dL and 110 mg/dL and
support the sponsor’s claimed measuring range of 1.5 to 80 mg/dL.
The claimed measuring range for Creatinine is 0.1 - 25mg/dL. The linearity of the
creatinine assay was assessed following CLSI EP6-A with commercially available
linearity sets which include 11 samples (0.1 to 31.3 mg/dL). All samples were tested in
duplicate on one Hitachi Clinical Analyzer E40. Recoveries were within ±10% or 0.2
mg/dL. The summary of the linear regression analysis of the data is below:
y=1.0201x+0.0457; R2=0.9991
The creatinine assay data demonstrates linearity between 0.1 mg/dL and 31.3 mg/dL
and support the sponsor’s claimed measuring range of 0.1 to 25 mg/dL.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Each lot of the S TEST Reagent Cartridge Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) is calibrated by
the manufacturer prior to shipment using material traceable to Reference Material
Institute for Clinical Chemistry Standards (ReCCS) Standard Serum JCCRM 521. The
2D code printed on each cartridge provides the analyzer with lot-specific calibration
data. BUN concentration is directly determined by multiplying the change in
absorbance of the unknown samples by the calibrator factor on the barcode. No
calibration is needed by the user.
Each lot of S TEST Reagent Cartridge Creatinine (CRE) is calibrated by the
manufacturer prior to shipment using material traceable to ReCCS standard serum
JCCRM 521; this standard is traceable to IDMS. The 2D code printed on each cartridge
provides the analyzer with lot-specific calibration data. CRE concentration is directly
determined by multiplying the change in absorbance of the unknown samples by the
calibrator factor on the barcode. No calibration is needed by the user.
Commercially available controls are required and users should follow Federal,
state, and local requirements.
Stability:
Real-time shelf-life studies for the BUN reagent cartridge were performed. A two-
level control set was tested in replicates of five with three lots of cartridges across
six analyzers. The protocols for stability and acceptance criteria were reviewed and
are acceptable and support a stability claim of 12 months when stored at 2-8°C.
Real-time shelf-life studies for the Creatinine reagent cartridge were performed. A
two-level control set was tested in replicates of five with three lots of cartridges
across six analyzers. The protocols for stability and acceptance criteria were
reviewed and are acceptable and support a stability claim of 18 months when stored
at 2-8°C.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) studies for the S TEST
Reagent Cartridge BUN and Reagent Cartridge CRE were performed in
accordance to CLSI EP17-A. The analytical sensitivity was defined as the limit
of detection, and the LoD was calculated from the LoB. LoB was determined
using a blank sample assayed 20 times per day for three days for a total of 60
replicates. The LoB was estimated as the mean of the 57th and 58th highest values
for the true blanks. LoD was determined using five low samples assayed four
times per day for three days, for a total of 60 replicate results. The LoD was
calculated as the LoB + 1.645 x SD of the low samples.
LoQ for the S TEST Reagent Cartridge BUN and CRE was assessed by preparing
several low samples to cover the lower limit of the analyte range. Each sample was
assayed in replicates of six. The mean, standard deviation and percent coefficient of
variation were calculated for the six replicates at each sample and a plot (expected

--- Page 8 ---
values (X) against %CV (Y)) was generated. LoQ was defined at the value of sample
where the interassay precision is <20% CV.
The LoQ study supported performance with low level BUN specimens (~4 mg/dL)
but the low end of the reportable range was defined by a functional sensitivity study.
Six samples between 0.5 mg/dL and 10 mg/dL were tested. Each sample was assayed
in replicates of six. The mean, standard deviation and percent %CVs were calculated
for the six replicates. A plot of expected (X) against actual (Y) concentrations and a
plot of expected values (X) against %CV (Y) was generated. The data support an
LoQ of 0.8 mg/dL and the low end of the measuring range is claimed to be 1.5
mg/dL.
The LoQ study supported performance with low level Creatinine specimens (~0.3
mg/dL) but the low end of the reportable range was defined by a functional sensitivity
study. Six samples between 0.05 mg/dL and 0.5mg/dL. Each sample was assayed in
replicates of six. The mean, standard deviation and percent %CVs were calculated for
the six replicates. A plot of expected (X) against actual (Y) concentrations and a plot
of expected values (X) against %CV (Y) was generated. The data support an LoQ of
0.1 mg/dL and the low end of the measuring range is claimed to be 0.1 mg/dL.
The LoB, LoD and LoQ for Blood Urea Nitrogen and Creatinine are tabulated below:
Analyte LoB (g/dL) LoD (g/dL) LoQ (g/dL)
Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) 0.52 0.8 0.8
Creatinine (CRE) 0.03 0.06 0.1
The sponsor’s claimed measuring range of BUN is 1.5 to 80 mg/dL and
Creatinine is 0.1 to 25 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
An interference study was performed in accordance with CLSI EP7-A. Two levels of
commercial control sera containing approximately 12 mg/dL and 30 mg/dL BUN and
1.5 mg/dL and 5.7 mg/dL creatinine were spiked to six levels with each interferent
(ascorbic acid, unconjugated bilirubin, hemoglobin and lipemia) and all seven
samples were tested in replicates of three by the Hitachi Clinical Analyzer E40. The
spiked sample results mean was compared to its neat control mean result and
recoveries were calculated. The sponsor defines non-interference as the mean results
from the testing of the spiked samples within 10% of the mean of the neat samples.
Recoveries were between 90% and 110% of the neat value. The highest level tested
with non significant interference is listed below.
Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) Creatinine (CRE)
Substance Highest level tested with Highest level tested with
no interference no interference
Ascorbic acid 50 mg/dL 25 mg/dL
Bilirubin (unconjugated) 50 mg/dL 25 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 1000 mg/dL 250 mg/dL
Lipemia (Intralipid) 1000 mg/dL 1000 mg/dL
The sponsor states in the labeling that hemolyzed specimens should not be used for
creatinine.
