I. Device Description:
Mueller Hinton agar is a standard basal medium recommended by the CLSI for routine
antimicrobial disk diffusion susceptibility testing of rapidly growing (non-fastidious)
bacteria. Beef and casein extracts and soluble starch in an agar base make up the nutritive
base of the medium. Starch protects the test organism from toxic materials that may be in the
medium. Calcium, magnesium, thymine, and thymidine concentrations are controlled.

L. Test Principle:
In the early 1960’s Bauer, Kirby and others developed a standardized procedure in which
Mueller Hinton Agar, a medium originally devised for the isolation of gonococci, was
selected as the test medium for determining the susceptibility of bacteria to antibiotic and
chemotherapeutic agents. A subsequent international collaborative study confirmed the
value of Mueller Hinton Agar for this purpose because of the relatively good
reproducibility of the medium, the simplicity of its formula, and the wealth of
experimental data that had been accumulated using this medium.
The Bauer-Kirby procedure is based on the diffusion through agar medium (such as

Mueller Hinton agar) of antimicrobial substances which are impregnated on sterile paper
disks. This method employs disks with a single concentration of antimicrobial agent and
zone sizes are correlated with minimum inhibitory concentrations. In the test procedure,
a standardized suspension of the organism is swabbed over the entire surface of the agar
medium. Sterile paper disks impregnated with specified amounts of antibiotic or other
antimicrobial agents are then placed on the surface of the inoculated agar medium. The
agar medium is incubated at 35+ 2°C for 16-18 hours. The organism will grow as a solid
“lawn”. The antimicrobial will diffuse outward (in a circle). If the antimicrobial agent
has activity against the organism, a circular zone of growth inhibition will result. The
zone of inhibition around the paper disk is measured. A determination as to whether the
organism is susceptible, intermediate or resistant to the antimicrobial agent is determined
by comparing the size of the zone of inhibition to the zone diameter interpretive criteria
in the CLSI M100 Standard. There are various factors which can influence the disk
diffusion susceptibility testing such as the agar medium, excess surface moisture on the
medium, agar depth, antimicrobial disk potency, inoculum concentration, and medium
pH.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The performance of Mueller Hinton Agar was evaluated in a multi-site
reproducibility study. Antimicrobial disk diffusion susceptibility testing was
conducted at three sites. Two of the test sites were external and one test site was
internal. Six organisms representing Gram negative and Gram positive rapidly
growing (non-fastidious) CLSI recommended quality control strains from American
Type and Culture Collection (ATCC) were included in the study, namely, S. aureus
ATCC 25923, E. faecalis ATCC 29212, E. faecalis ATCC 51299, E. coli 25922, E.
coli ATCC 35218 and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Antimicrobials representing the
major drug classes relevant to each organism were included in the study. Testing was
conducted on three separate days, in duplicate, using two different lots of Mueller
Hinton Agar, two different plate sizes (15 X 90 mm and 15 X1 50 mm), and where
available, antimicrobial disks from two different manufacturers resulting in a total of
72 results for each organism-antimicrobial combination. Antimicrobial disks from
only one manufacturer were available at the time of testing for Cefepime, Ceftaroline,
High Level Gentamicin, and High Level Streptomycin, resulting in a total of 36
results for each of these antimicrobials.
The performance of Mueller Hinton Agar was evaluated relative to the acceptable
range as indicated in the antimicrobial specific FDA drug label, or CLSI Standards
M100-S24 or M02-A11. Acceptable performance for each organism-antimicrobial
combination was determined as test results falling within the acceptable range ≥95%
of the time.

--- Page 5 ---
Levels of thymine and thymidine in Mueller Hinton Agar were evaluated by testing
Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Excess
amounts of thymine and thymidine can reverse the inhibitory effect of sulfonamides
and trimethoprim, resulting in smaller, less distinct zones of inhibition or no zones at
all. The results of the testing of this organism-antimicrobial combination were within
range, indicating adequate levels of thymine and thymidine.
The levels of the cations calcium and magnesium in Mueller Hinton Agar were
evaluated by testing Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 with the
aminoglycosides gentamicin and tobramycin. Excess cation content results in
reduced zones, whereas low cation content results in unacceptably large zone sizes.
The results of the testing of these antimicrobials were within range, indicating
adequate levels of calcium and magnesium.
The results of the study for each organism-antimicrobial combination were within
acceptable range ≥95% of the time.
