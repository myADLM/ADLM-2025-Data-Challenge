3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
· For prescription use only
· The ability of the VITEK ® 2 AST Streptococcus Meropenem to detect resistance to
meropenem in S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae and S. pyogenes is unknown because
resistant strains were not available at the time of comparative testing.
4. Special instrument requirements:
For use with the VITEK® 2 and VITEK® 2 Compact Systems
I. Device Description:
The VITEK® 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the
doubling dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).
Each VITEK® 2 test card contains 64 microwells, containing a premeasured amount of a
specific antibiotic in a culture medium base. A control well, containing only culture
medium, is included on all cards. A suspension of organism from a pure culture is prepared
in a tube containing 0.45-0.5% sterile saline and standardized to a McFarland 0.5 using the
DensiCHEK Plus™. The desired test card is placed in the cassette along with an empty
transfer tube which is incorporated into the side of the susceptibility card and placed in
the organism suspension. The cassette is placed into the VITEK® 2 instrument where a
diluted susceptibility test suspension is automatically prepared by the Vitek® 2 System, using
the original organism suspension. The cards are automatically filled with the susceptibility
test suspension via vacuum, the tubes are cut, and the cards are sealed prior to proceeding to
the Incubator Loading Station. Cards are transferred from the cassette into a carousel for
incubation (35.5°C) and reading via optical scanning. Readings are performed every 15
minutes for the duration of the incubation cycle.
The VITEK® 2 AST Streptococcus Meropenem has the following concentrations in the card:
0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 μg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in
μg/mL). The MIC result range for the VITEK® 2 AST Streptococcus Meropenem card is ≤
0.06 - ≥ 4 μg/mL. The MIC interpretive criteria and equivalent concentrations are listed in
Table 1 below.

L. Test Principle:
The VITEK® 2 System optics use visible light to directly measure organism growth. The
transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth
has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same well measure organism
growth by how much light is prevented from going through the well. An interpretive call is
made between 4 and 16 hours for a “rapid” read but may be extended to 18 hours in some
instances. The VITEK® 2 susceptibility card test is based on the microdilution minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) technique with concentrations equivalent to standard method
concentrations. Several parameters based on the growth characteristics observed are used to
provide appropriate input for the MIC calculations. Discriminate analysis is used to develop
the algorithm that determines the susceptibility result for all antimicrobials on the VITEK® 2
System. The MIC result must be linked to organism identification in order to determine a
category interpretation. A category interpretation (SIR) will be reported along with each
MIC result.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility studies were performed using 10 isolates of Streptococcus
pneumoniae at 3 sites on 3 separate days, in triplicate. The studies included both the
auto- and manual dilution methods with the VITEK® 2 instrument system and the
manual dilution method with the VITEK® 2 Compact instrument system. Greater
than 95% reproducibility was demonstrated with both the VITEK® 2 and VITEK® 2
Compact Systems. All MIC results were on-scale for both inoculation methods and
all reading methods; therefore, best case and worst case scenarios were identical. A
summary of the reproducibility study performance is illustrated in Table 3 below.

sufficient number of times to demonstrate that the device can produce QC results in
the recommended range. A summary of the QC testing is illustrated in Table 4

Clinical study testing was conducted at three external sites using the VITEK®2 AST

microdilution reference method using Mueller-Hinton broth with lysed horse blood
prepared as recommended by the CLSI. Performance testing included a total of 699

clinical isolates, both fresh and stock (28.3%; 198/699). Testing of the clinical
isolates was performed using the automated method of dilution of the AST card
inoculum. Performance data comparing the VITEK®2 AST Streptococcus
Meropenem card and the reference method are illustrated in Table A below.
Challenge study testing was conducted, at one external site using the VITEK® 2 AST
Streptococcus Meropenem card on the VITEK®2 instrument platform and the broth
microdilution reference method using Mueller-Hinton broth with lysed horse blood
prepared as recommended by the CLSI. A challenge set consisting of a total of 100
isolates, including 50 isolates of S. agalactiae and 50 isolates of S. pneumoniae, was
used for the performance testing. Testing of the challenge isolates was performed
using both the auto- and manual method of dilution of the AST card inoculum. As
illustrated in Tables A and B below, there is very little difference in the challenge
testing device performance between the two methods of dilution of the AST card
inoculum.
Challenge testing of the VITEK®2 AST Streptococcus Meropenem card on the
VITEK®2 Compact instrument platform was also conducted as a secondary
procedural option against the broth microdilution reference method. Testing was
conducted at one external site, using the same challenge set of 100 isolates. Testing
was performed using the manual method of dilution of the AST card inoculum. The
performance data is illustrated in Table C below.
S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes isolates were analyzed using the FDA breakpoint (≤ 0.5 =
S). S. pneumoniae isolates were analyzed using the FDA breakpoints (≤ 0.25 = S;
0.5 = I; ≥ 1= R).

EA = Essential Agreement CA = Category Agreement
R = Resistant Isolates min = minor discrepancies
maj = major discrepancies vmj = very major discrepancies
Evaluable results are those that fall within the test range of the reference method and
could also be on-scale with the new device if within plus/minus one dilution. Essential
Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the result of the reference
method and that of VITEK®2 AST card within plus or minus one serial two-fold dilution
of the antibiotic. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the interpretation of the result
of the reference method agrees exactly with the interpretation of the VITEK®2 AST card
result.
Relative to all the clinical and challenge testing performed using the VITEK®2 AST
Streptococcus Meropenem card, the overall %EA and %CA in most instances, met the
acceptance criteria of greater than or equal to 90%. In each instance where the %CA fell
below 90%, the percent essential agreement of evaluable results was very good and all
the discrepancies were minor discrepancies. There were no categorical very major errors.
Relative to all the clinical and challenge testing performed using the VITEK®2 AST
Streptococcus Meropenem card, there were no instances of growth failure.
