1. Intended use(s):
The CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is intended for
use in real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays on an Applied Biosystems (ABI) 7500 Fast
Dx Real-Time PCR instrument in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological
information:
· For qualitative detection of influenza virus type A or B from viral RNA in upper
respiratory tract clinical specimens (including nasopharyngeal swabs [NPS], nasal
swabs [NS], throat swabs [TS], nasal aspirates [NA], nasal washes [NW] and dual
nasopharyngeal/throat swabs [NPS/TS]), and lower respiratory tract specimens
(including bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL], bronchial wash [BW], tracheal aspirate
[TA], sputum, and lung tissue) from human patients with signs and symptoms of
respiratory infection and/or from viral culture;
· For determination of the subtype of seasonal human influenza A viruses as seasonal
A/H1, A/H3, and/or A/H1pdm09 from viral RNA in upper respiratory tract clinical
specimens (including NPS, NS, TS, NA, NW, and NPS/TS) and lower respiratory
tract specimens (including BAL, BW, TA, sputum and lung tissue) from human
patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection and/or from viral culture;
· For the determination of the genetic lineage of human influenza B viruses as
B/Victoria or B/Yamagata lineage from viral RNA in upper respiratory tract clinical
specimens (including NPS, NS, TS, NA, NW, and NPS/TS) from human patients
with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection and/or from viral culture;
· For the presumptive identification of virus in patients who may be infected with
influenza A subtype A/H5 (Asian lineage) from viral RNA in human respiratory
specimens and viral culture in conjunction with clinical and epidemiological risk
factors;
· To provide epidemiological information for surveillance of circulating influenza
viruses.
Performance characteristics for influenza were established during a season when seasonal
influenza viruses A/H1 and A/H3 were the predominant influenza A viruses in circulation
2

--- Page 3 ---
and during a season when the A/H1pdm09 influenza virus was the predominant influenza
A virus in circulation. Performance characteristics may vary with other emerging
influenza A viruses.
Testing with the influenza H5a and H5b primer and probe sets should not be performed
unless the patient meets the most current U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
(DHHS) clinical and epidemiological criteria for testing suspect A/H5 specimens. The
definitive identification of influenza A/H5 (Asian lineage) either directly from patient
specimens or from virus cultures requires additional laboratory testing, along with
clinical and epidemiological assessment in consultation with national influenza
surveillance experts.
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the
sole basis for treatment or other patient management decisions. Conversely, positive
results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent
detected may not be the definite cause of disease.
If infection with a novel influenza A virus is suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria recommended by public health authorities, specimens
should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions for novel virulent
influenza viruses and sent to state or local health department for testing. Viral culture
should not be attempted unless a BSL 3+ facility is available to receive and culture
specimens.
All users, analysts, and any person reporting results from use of this device should be
trained to perform and interpret the results from this procedure by a competent instructor
prior to use. CDC Influenza Division will limit the distribution of this device to only those
users who have successfully completed a training course provided by CDC instructors or
designees.

I. Device Description:
The CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is used in rRT-PCR
assays on the ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument. It consists of oligonucleotide
3

--- Page 4 ---
primers, dual-labeled hydrolysis (TaqMan®) probes, and positive controls for the in vitro
qualitative detection and characterization of the human influenza virus RNA in respiratory
tract specimens from human patients presenting with signs and symptoms of respiratory
infections. These reagents are used for detection of influenza A and B virus and
characterization of influenza A viruses as seasonal A/H1, A/H3, A/H1pdm09, or A/H5
(Asian lineage), and influenza B viruses as B/Victoria or B/ Yamagata lineage.
Primers and probes for Influenza A, 2009 Influenza A (swine origin), and B viruses were
selected from highly conserved regions of specific gene targets within the matrix protein (M),
nucleoprotein (NP), and non-structural protein (NS), respectively. Primers and probes for
detection and differentiation of seasonal influenza A/H1, A/H3, A/H1pdm09, and A/H5
viruses are targeted for conserved regions of their respective hemagglutinin (HA) genes.
Primers and probes for detection and differentiation of influenza B/Victoria and B/Yamagata,
are also targeted for conserved regions of their respective hemagglutinin (HA) genes.
The components of the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel
include the following:
Primer and probe sets
· InfA detects all influenza A viruses, but does not detect influenza B viruses
· InfB detects all influenza B viruses, but does not detect influenza A viruses
· H1 specifically detects influenza A, seasonal H1 subtype
· H3 specifically detects influenza A, seasonal H3 subtype
· H5a and H5b specifically detects influenza A, H5 Asian lineage

L. Test Principle:
The CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is based on
technology which is used in many molecular diagnostic assays. rRT-PCR assays are one-tube
assays that first reverse-transcribe specific regions of RNA into cDNA copies. The cDNA
then serves as a template for a polymerase chain reaction that utilizes thermocyclic heating
and cooling of the reaction to logarithmically amplify a specific region of DNA. The probe
anneals to a specific internal target sequence located between the target loci of the forward
and reverse primers. During the extension phase of the PCR cycle, the 5' exonuclease activity
of Taq polymerase degrades any probe molecules hybridized to amplified target sequence,
causing the reporter dye to separate from the quencher dye, and generating a fluorescent
signal. With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved from their respective

An additional internal precision study was performed to assess the precision of the
new VIC and YAM primer and probe sets. Each primer and probe set was tested with
one influenza B strain for which it was designed to detect and differentiate (i.e.,
Influenza B/Nevada/03/2011, Victoria lineage and Influenza B/Wisconsin/01/2010,
Yamagata lineage) using one extraction method (i.e., Roche MagNA Pure Compact
RNA Kit) and one enzyme kit (i.e., Invitrogen SuperScript III Platinum). Three panel
members of each influenza B lineage (i.e., moderate positive, low positive and high
negative) were tested by two operators who individually performed two separate runs
per testing day. Each panel member was tested in three replicates per run. Testing was
performed over 12 days (not necessarily consecutive) to generate a total of 96 data
points per panel member (i.e., 2 replicates/run x 2 runs/day/operator x 2 operators x
12 days = 96).

was prepared using a concentration lower than the reported LoD in order to target a
concentration as close to the C as possible. However, since the assay is very close to its
95
analytical endpoint at this concentration, several replicates between both operators produced no
measureable fluorescence above background or measurements above the cutoff.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There are no changes to the internal positive control, the human RNase P; Human
Specimen Control (HSC); Influenza virus A/H5N1 Positive Control (H5VC), Pooled
Influenza Positive Control (PIPC), and No Template Control (NTC) for the modified
device. Please refer to previously FDA-cleared 510(k) Premarket Notifications
K080570, K101564, K111507, and K130551 for further information.
An additional positive control, the Influenza B Positive Control (IBPC), was included
in the modified device. The IBPC is for use as a positive control with the CDC
Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel procedure to ensure the
detection and differentiation of seasonal influenza B viruses of both the B/Yamagata
and B/Victoria lineages.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical sensitivity of the Influenza B Lineage Genotyping Assay (i.e., the new
VIC and YAM primer and probe sets and the previously FDA-cleared InfB primer
and probe set) was demonstrated by determining the Limit of Detection (LoD) using
both the Quanta qScript™ and the Invitrogen SuperScript™ enzyme kits.
Characterized viruses of known 50% infectious dose titers (EID /mL) were
50
extracted, and the RNA was serially diluted and tested (n= 3 to 5 replicates) in order
to determine an apparent endpoint range. The LoD for each primer and probe set was
confirmed by testing extraction replicates (n=20) of the highest virus dilution where
≥95% of all replicates tested positive. Virus dilutions were prepared in virus transport
medium containing human A549 cells to emulate clinical specimen matrix. The
lowest concentration where the InfB and VIC or InfB and YAM primer and probe
sets both met the LoD criteria was reported as the LoD.
The LoD study results are presented in the table below:

e. Analytical reactivity:
Analytical reactivity (inclusivity) testing was conducted to demonstrate the capability
of the oligonucleotide primers and probes in the Influenza B Lineage Genotyping
Assay (i.e., the new VIC and YAM primer and probe sets and the previously FDA-
cleared InfB primer and probe set) to detect multiple strains of each influenza B virus
lineage at low concentrations. Ten influenza B/Victoria lineage and ten influenza
B/Yamagata lineage viruses were grown to high titer and harvested. Each virus was
serially diluted to near the assay LoD in virus transport medium containing human
A549 cells to emulate clinical specimen matrix. The diluted influenza B/Victoria
lineage and B/Yamagata lineage viruses were extracted and tested in triplicate with
the corresponding primer and probe set to demonstrate analytical reactivity.
Inclusivity of the Influenza B Lineage Genotyping Assay was evaluated with both
enzyme systems (i.e. Invitrogen SuperScript™ and Quanta qScript™).

f. Analytical specificity:
An exclusivity study was performed to demonstrate the specificity of each primer and
probe set of the Influenza B Lineage Genotyping Assay (i.e., the new VIC and YAM
primer and probe sets and the previously FDA-cleared InfB primer and probe set)
when tested with influenza B viruses of the other lineage, with influenza A viruses,
and with common non-influenza human respiratory viruses, respiratory bacteria, and
commensal organisms of the human respiratory tract. All organisms used in the study
were propagated, titered, and characterized to confirm identity prior to testing.
Nucleic acids were purified from ten influenza B/Victoria lineage and ten influenza
B/Yamagata lineage viruses, eight influenza A viruses of various subtypes that
circulate in humans or from animal origin that infect humans, and 35 non-influenza
organisms (16 viruses, 18 bacteria, and 1 yeast) representing common respiratory
pathogens or flora commonly present in specimens collected from the human
nasopharynx region. High titer preparations of bacteria and yeast, generally greater
than or equal to106 CFU/mL were tested with the Influenza B Lineage Genotyping
Assay. Similarly, influenza and non-influenza respiratory virus preparations at
concentrations greater than 106TCID /mL were tested (except in cases where
50
production of high titer virus stock was not possible, e.g. parainfluenza virus type 2).
The Influenza B Lineage Genotyping Assay was evaluated with both enzyme kits (i.e.
Invitrogen SuperScript™ and Quanta qScript™).
No cross-reactivity was observed. The analytical specificity study results are
presented in the tables below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable. Performance of the new Influenza B Lineage Genotyping Assay (i.e.,
the new VIC and YAM primer and probe sets and the previously FDA-cleared InfB
primer and probe set) was evaluated against the comparator method of RT-PCR
followed by sequencing.
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Prospective Study:
A prospective clinical study was conducted during the 2011-2012 influenza season to
evaluate the performance of the new CDC Human Influenza rRT-PCR Diagnostic
Panel- Influenza B Lineage Genotyping Assay (i.e., the new VIC and YAM primer
and probe sets). Residual material from a total of 1,002 respiratory specimens from
patients who were symptomatic for influenza-like illness (ILI) was collected and
tested at six clinical sites. The study population and specimen types are summarized
by age range and specimen type in the table below:

The performance of each Influenza B Lineage Genotyping Assay (i.e., the new VIC
and YAM primer and probe sets) was assessed at the clinical sites using both the
Invitrogen Superscript™ and Quanta qScript™ enzyme kits against a comparator
method of RT-PCR followed by bidirectional nucleic acid sequence analysis of a
region of the influenza B hemagglutinin (HA) gene. Specimens collected in the study
were tested with the InfB and RP primer and probe sets from the FDA-cleared CDC
Human Influenza Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel to establish the presence of
influenza B viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens and confirm adequate
specimen collection. The comparator method was then performed on each specimen

containing influenza B viral RNA as determined by the FDA-cleared CDC Human
Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel.
A brief description of the comparator method is provided below:
A 221-bp fragment containing the selected variable region of the HA gene was
amplified by RT-PCR from RNA isolated from each clinical specimen. Each strand
of the DNA amplicon was sequenced to obtain 4-fold coverage of an 82-bp region
with Phred20 quality sequence data (99% accuracy). Sequence data of each sample
were aligned to B/Victoria and B/Yamagata reference virus sequences of the HA gene
and the percent homology calculated. A homology exceeding 95% to one lineage
reference sequence while showing less than 95% to the other lineage reference
sequence determines the lineage identity of the influenza B virus.
The reference virus sequences that were used were submitted by the WHO
Collaborating Center for Influenza at CDC. Each reference virus was published with
a serological identification to a vaccine reference virus and consequently identified as
either Victoria or Yamagata lineage. Using the 82-bp region, a percent homology
between contemporary B/Yamagata lineage viruses and B/Victoria lineage reference
viruses does not exceed approximately 93%. The criteria of exceeding 95%
homology to one lineage while showing less than 95% homology to the other lineage
sets a significant threshold that is valid for available reference sequences of each
lineage (i.e. no cases of a virus showing greater than 95% homology to both lineages
is seen).
The following enrolled clinical specimens were excluded from the clinical
performance data analysis due to deviations from the clinical study protocol: four
specimens of unknown specimen type; five lower respiratory specimens; one
specimen of inconclusive results; and 131 specimens due to technician error
(excluded from Quanta qScript™ runs only). After exclusion of these specimens,
there were a total of 992 specimens tested using the Invitrogen SuperScriptTM enzyme
kits and 861 specimens tested using the Quanta qScript™ enzyme kits were included
in the performance data analysis.
The prospective study results of the Influenza B Lineage Genotyping Assay used with
the Invitrogen SuperScript™ enzyme kits are summarized in the tables below:

2007 (K080570), 2009-2010 (K101564), and 2011-2012 (K130551) influenza seasons.
During February 25, 2012, to May 19, 2012, World Health Organization and National
Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) collaborating laboratories
in the United States tested 47,281 respiratory specimens for influenza viruses. Of these,
9,415 (19.9%) were positive: 85% of the positive specimens were positive for influenza
A viruses and 15% were positive for influenza B viruses. Among the 5,071 influenza A
viruses for which subtyping was performed, 3,680 (72.6%) were influenza A/H3 viruses
and 1,391 (27.4%) were 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses.
From August 30, 2009, through March 27, 2010, World Health Organization (WHO) and
National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) collaborating
laboratories in the United States tested 422,648 specimens. Of these, 89,585 (21.1%)
were positive: 89,298 (99.7%) were positive for influenza A and 287 (0.3%) were
positive for influenza B. Among 66,978 influenza A viruses for which subtyping was
performed, almost all (66,589 [99.4%]) were 2009 H1N1 viruses. Of the 37,260
specimens reported during February 14 - March 27, 2010, a total of 2,020 (5.4%) tested
positive for influenza, of which 1,999 (98.9%) were positive for influenza A and 21
(1.0%) were positive for influenza B. Of the 1,510 influenza A viruses reported since
mid-February for which subtyping was performed, almost all (1,506 [99.7%]) were 2009
H1N1 viruses. No seasonal influenza A (H1) viruses and only three influenza A (H3)
viruses were reported. During February 14 - March 27, states in the Southeast (Alabama,
Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee)
accounted for approximately 55% of the influenza positives reported but only 20% of the
specimens tested.
During October 1, 2006--May 19, 2007, World Health Organization and National
Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) collaborating laboratories
in the United States tested 179,268 respiratory specimens for influenza viruses; 23,753
(13.2%) were positive. Of these, 18,817 (79.2%) were influenza A viruses and 4,936
(20.8%) were influenza B viruses. Among the influenza A viruses, 6,280 (33.4%) were
subtyped; 3,912 (62.3%) were influenza A/H1 viruses and 2,368 (37.7%) were influenza
A/H3 viruses (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5631a2.htm). In the
rRT-PCR Flu Panel multicenter prospective clinical study during the 2006-2007
influenza season, the prevalence as determined by virus culture was as follows: influenza
A/H1 (7.0%), influenza A/H3 (23.6%), and influenza B (9.9%).
