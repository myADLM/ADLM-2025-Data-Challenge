L. Test Principle:
The LIAISON® N-TACT® PTH Gen II assay is a modified two-step, two-site sandwich assay
that uses two goat polyclonal antibodies for capture and detection of intact PTH. Results are
determined by a 2 point calibration conversion of the master curve to a working curve. The
light signal is measured by a photomultiplier as relative light units (RLU) and is proportional
to the concentration of intact PTH present in the calibrators, controls or samples.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision testing was performed following CLSI Guideline EP5-A2. A coded panel
comprised of 7 frozen EDTA plasma samples spanning the assay range and 2 lots of
LIAISON® N-TACT® PTH Gen II controls (2 levels) were tested in the study. The
precision panel samples and kit controls were tested on two lots of LIAISON® N-
TACT® PTH Gen II in two replicates per run, 2 runs per day for 20 operating days for

a total of 160 replicate results per sample. The 20 day results are summarized for the
combined reagent lot numbers as sample mean PTH concentration in pg/mL, standard
deviations and coefficient of variation (%CV) for between lot and Total across lots.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
One patient sample for each sample type (Serum, SST serum, EDTA and Lithium
Heparin plasma) was spiked with PTH 1-84 to achieve PTH levels above the
measuring range of the assay and diluted with a normal PTH patient sample of the
same type to achieve PTH levels in the lower portion of the measuring range. In order
to achieve PTH values in the very low range, the low normal sample was further
diluted with sample diluent (containing no PTH) to levels near the claimed LoQ of
the assay. Each of the 18 concentrations for each sample type was tested in triplicate
on the LIAISON XL analyzer with one lot of reagent. The resulting regression
equations for each sample type are summarized below:
Serum: y= 0.9767x - 3.624; R2 = 0.9982
SST Serum: y=0.9742x + 3.856; R2 = 0.9987
EDTA plasma: y=1.012x – 4.127; R2 = 0.9983
Lithium Heparin plasma: y=0.9461x + 3.696; R2 = 0.9992
The linearity results support the claimed measuring range of this device (3.0-1900
pg/mL) for serum, SST serum, EDTA plasma, and Lithium Heparin plasma samples.
Hook Effect Study
The sponsor performed a hook effect study to determine if there is high dose hook effect.

of either lyophilized PTH 7-84 antigen or WHO PTH 1-84 (NIBSC 95/646) into a
zero sample and normalizing the recovery of PTH 7-84 to PTH 1-84 (NIBSC 95/646).
Both the PTH 7-84 and PTH 1-84 were reconstituted in specimen diluent to a

The sponsor included the following limitation statement in the assay’s package
insert:
The LIAISON® N-TACT® PTH Gen II assay will detect non-Intact PTH (1-84) such
as PTH fragment (7-84).PTH fragment (7-84) may cause falsely elevated Intact PTH
results in patients with abnormal renal function because these patients may have
various concentrations of PTH fragment (7-84) in their blood. In patients with
abnormal renal function please interpret the Intact PTH results with caution and do
not make patient management decisions on the Intact PTH result alone.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Following the CLSI EP9-A2 guidance document, the sponsor performed a method
comparison study on 199 EDTA plasma samples from various sources. The samples
included 127 presumed normal subjects, 43 hyperparathyroid patients, 26 renal
dialysis patients and 3 samples that were spiked with PTH in order to span the
complete assay range. All the samples were tested in singlicate using the Siemens
ADVIA Centaurâ Intact PTH (predicate device) and the LIAISONâ N-TACT® PTH
Gen II (candidate device). The samples tested ranged from 8.0 pg/mL to 1794
pg/mL. Passing & Bablok linear regression analyses were performed and gave the
following results:

b. Matrix comparison:
Sixty-five (65) matched patient sets of EDTA plasma, serum, SST serum, and
Lithium Heparin plasma samples were tested to determine if these sample types
provide equivalent results on the LIAISON® N-TACT® PTH Gen II assay. In order
to obtain samples that spanned the measuring range of 3.0-1900 pg/mL, some of the
samples were spiked. Each sample type was tested in singlicate using 1 lot of
reagent. Passing & Bablok linear regression analyses were performed and gave the
following results:

Based on the data, the sponsor claims EDTA plasma, Lithium Heparin plasma,
Serum, and SST serum are acceptable for this assay.
In the limitation section of the package insert, sponsor has the following limitation:
“During routine monitoring of intact PTH levels, use the same specimen type
throughout the monitoring period to avoid bias in the results.”
