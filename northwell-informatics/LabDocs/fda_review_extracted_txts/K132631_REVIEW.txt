L. Test Principle:
The EliA SmDP Wells are coated with a synthetic SmD3 peptide. If present in the patient's
specimen, antibodies to the SmD3 peptide bind to their specific antigen. After washing away
non-bound antibodies, enzyme-labeled antibodies against human IgG antibodies (EliA IgG
Conjugate) are added to form an antibody-conjugate complex. After incubation, non-bound
conjugate is washed away and the bound complex is incubated with a Development Solution.
After stopping the reaction, the fluorescence in the reaction mixture is measured. The higher
the response value, the higher the amount of antibody bound and detected in the sample
tested. To evaluate test results, the response for patient samples is compared directly to the
response for calibrators.
The total IgG calibration is based on a set of six WHO-standardized IgG Calibrators derived
from human serum. They are used to establish an initial calibration curve, which may be used
for up to 28 days on additional assays and can be stored by the instrument. Each additional
assay includes calibrator (curve) controls that have to recover in defined ranges to ensure that
the stored calibration curve is still valid. Limits for the response of the Curve Controls are
defined in the Phadia 100/250 Operator and Panel Software.

from μg/L to EliA U/mL. Results above the upper limit are reported as “above”.
High dose hook effect: A hook effect was not observed when analyzing a high
positive sample that had a concentration up to 8 times above the upper limit of the
measuring range.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i) Traceability:
Calibrators: There is no international reference standard for IgG antibodies that
specifically recognize Sm or the SmD3 peptide. The instrument measures specific
IgG concentrations in μg/L. By using a conversion factor given by the lot-specific
code of the EliA SmDP Well, the results are automatically converted to EliA
Units/mL.
EliA IgG Calibrators and Curve Controls are traceable (via an unbroken chain of
calibrations) to the International Reference Preparation (IRP) 67/86 of Human
Serum Immunoglobulins A, G and M from WHO. New batches of IgG
Calibrators are compared to a secondary standard (standardized with the IRP) or
the IRP directly and adjusted accordingly to meet the correct concentration.
The calibrators are required to perform an initial calibration curve, which can be
stored in the Phadia instrument and may be used for up to 28 days on this and
additional IgG assays. Each additional assay outside of a calibration run includes
curve controls that have to fall within defined ranges to verify that the stored
calibration curve is still valid.
Controls: EliA ANA Positive Control is prepared from selected pooled human
sera and contains IgG antibodies to dsDNA, RNP, Sm, Ro, La, Scl-70, CENP and
Jo-1. This control was cleared under k072393. The EliA™ IgG/IgM/IgA
Negative Control was prepared from normal human serum. This control was
cleared under k131821. The target ranges for the EliA™ Controls for the two
platforms are summarized below:
Instrument EliA™ Positive SmDP Control
Phadia 100 31.7 – 73. U/mL
Phadia 250 31.1 – 72.5 U/mL
Instrument EliA™ IgG/IgM/IgA
Negative Control
Phadia 100 ≤ 4 U/mL
Phadia 250 ≤ 4 U/mL

Closed and open stability - An accelerated stability study initially determined the
shelf-life of the EliA SmDP Well was 24 months. A real-time stability study
supported a 24 months stability claim. All studies were performed on three
batches of EliA SmDP Well. Other required components (previously reviewed) of
the assay method have a shelf life of 18 to 24 months. The sponsor notes that it is
important to store the wells in dry conditions at 2-8°C.
On-board stability - The on-board stability of the EliA SmDP Wells packed in
carriers were tested for 2, 4 and 6 weeks at 10 ºC and 80% humidity in duplicates
in one run using 3 positive and 2 negative samples only on the Phadia 250
instrument since for Phadia 100 instrument the reagents are stored outside the
instrument and are only loaded as needed for an assay. The on-board stability for
the EliA™ SmDP Wells was determined to be 28 days at 2-8ºC.
iii) Sample Storage
The sponsor recommends following the guidelines in CLSI H18-A3 for sample
storage. Separated serum/plasma should remain at room temperature for no
longer than eight hours. If assays will not be completed within eight hours,
serum/plasma should be refrigerated (2 to 8°C). If assays are not completed
within 48 hours, or the separated serum/plasma will be stored beyond 48 hours,
serum/plasma should be frozen at or below -20°C. Freezing and thawing should
be avoided.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LOB), Limit of Detection (LOD) and Limit of Quantitation were
determined based on CLSI EP17-A, “Protocols for Determination of Limits of
Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline, EP17-A”. On each system
(Phadia 100 and Phadia 250), six samples with undetectable levels of analyte were
spiked with EliA Sample Diluent and were measured in 72 replicates. The sample
with the lowest value was chosen to be the blank sample while the other 5 samples
were deemed ‘low positives’ for this experiment. For Phadia 100 and Phadia 250,
each sample was run in a total of six runs, three runs in two instruments.
The values determined are presented here:
EliA™ SmDP LoB LoD LoQ
Phadia 100 0.39 U/mL 0.69 U/mL 0.69 U/mL
Phadia 250 0.45 U/mL 0.73 U/mL 0.73 U/mL
e. Analytical specificity:
Comparison to Reference Sera: Twelve reference sera were obtained from the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, GA. These sera have known
reactivity for a number of autoantibodies that include DNA, SS-B/La, U1-RNP, SS-
A/Ro, PCNA, Pol III, PM/Scl, CENP, Scl-70, Jo-1, PM/Scl, rRNP/Rib P. In addition,

two of the reference sera were known to be positive for Sm. Among the 12 sera, only
the two sera that were known to be positive for Sm were found to be reactive in the
EliA SmDP assay.
Endogenous Interference: Interferences were assessed by testing three positive serum
samples: two samples around the cut-off (11 and 12 U/mL), and a high positive (>110
U/mL). Each sample was spiked with the interfering substances or substance-specific
blanks and analyzed using one lot of EliA SmDP Well and one lot of system reagents
in two runs, each in three replicates (n=6). The data demonstrated that SmDP was not
adversely affected by high levels of the following substances tested up to the
concentrations listed in the table below:
Potential Interfering Compound Concentration
Bilirubin F 19.2 mg/dL
Bilirubin C 20.1 mg/dL
Hemoglobin 496 mg/dL
Lipemic factor (ClinOleic) 1 g/dL (1%)
Rheumatoid factor 500 IU/mL
f. Assay cut-off:
Based on the results of the expected values/reference range study described below in
Section M.5, the 99th percentile lies below the upper limit of the equivocal range for
the EliA SmDP assay. The cut-off between equivocal and positive was set to 10
U/mL. The assay cutoffs were set as follows:
Decision Point Interpretation
<7 U/mL Negative
7-10 U/mL Equivocal
>10 U/mL Positive
Where specimens yield equivocal results, the sponsor recommends retesting the
patient again after 6-8 weeks.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
One hundred twenty samples from individuals diagnosed with SLE and 250
specimens from individuals with other autoimmune and infectious conditions were
tested (see 3.a. below for a detailed list). In addition, 20 specimens with known anti-
Sm reactivity, but without clinical diagnosis, were added to the analysis.

b. Matrix comparison:
Twenty-five negative subjects and twenty-five positive subjects provided sera and
plasma specimens (EDTA and citrate) and these were tested for SmDP on the Phadia
250. The sponsor’s acceptance criteria were that each plasma sample should yield
results within 20% of the serum specimen and that all negative specimens should
remain negative. A Passing & Bablok analysis was performed and the results are
depicted in the following table:

c. Instrument comparison:
In order to determine if the performance of EliA SmDP is equivalent on the
instruments Phadia 100 and Phadia 250, 36 samples distributed over the measuring
range were tested: 25 positive, 7 equivocal and 4 negative samples. All samples were
run on 3 different Phadia 100 and 3 different Phadia 250 instruments. Each sample
was tested once on each instrument. The results from Phadia 100 Instrument 1 were
compared to the results from Phadia 250 Instrument 1, and so on for the other two
instrument pairs. The results of a Weighted Deming regression analyses performed on
each pair are shown below.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity:
One hundred samples from individuals diagnosed with SLE and 250 specimens from
individuals with other autoimmune and infectious conditions were tested on the
Phadia 250 instrument.

Performance on Non-SLE Specimens:
One hundred fifty specimens from individuals having other conditions were tested for
SmDP reactivity, including dermatomyositis, polymyositis, scleroderma, mixed
connective tissue disease, rheumatoid arthritis, Hashimoto thyroiditis, Graves’
Disease and Sjögren’s Syndrome. In this study, no more than 5% of the specimens
that were tested were found to be positive for SmDP at a level > 10 U/mL.

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Four hundred samples from healthy Caucasian individuals were measured on the Phadia
250 instrument. The results are presented in the following table:
U/mL
Mean 1.4
Median 2.8
Range 0.1 – 9.1
95th percentile 3.0
99th percentile 6.7
The results were equally distributed and not dependent on age or gender. No samples
were positive ( >10 U/mL) in this study, but 3 (0.75%) of the samples fell in the
equivocal range. Expected values may vary depending on the population tested. A subset
(n=70) of the samples tested on the Phadia 100 gave similar results.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
