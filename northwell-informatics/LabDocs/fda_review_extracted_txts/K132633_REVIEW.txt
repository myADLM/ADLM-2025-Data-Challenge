L. Test Principle:
The test is based on electrochemical biosensor technology and the principle of capillary
action. The glucose oxidase and potassium ferricyanide in the strip react with the glucose in
the sample to produce an electrical current which is proportional to the amount of glucose in
the sample. The meter measures the current and converts it to the corresponding glucose
concentration.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability and between-run precision studies were performed using CLSI EP5-A:
Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods;

was measured 10 times per test strip lot and the values from the OK Biotech BGMS
were compared with those obtained from YSI-2300. The results from linear
regression analysis are summarized below:
Test strip Lot 1:
y = 0.98x + 1.33; r = 0.9996
Test strip Lot 2:
y = 0.98x + 0.88; r = 0.9996
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of
20 – 600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
According to the sponsor, the OKmeter Blood Glucose Monitoring System (BGMS)
is traceable to the YSI 2747 Glucose Standard (NIST SRM #917c Clinical Dextrose).
A method comparison was performed using the candidate device and a glucose
oxidase method (YSI 2300) as the reference method (see Section M.2.a.)
Test Strip Stability
Closed vial (shelf life)
Test strip shelf life stability was assessed in real time studies. Testing protocols and
acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer
claims shelf life stability of 24 months at the recommended storage temperatures of 4
– 40° C and 10-85% relative humidity.
Opened vial (in-use)
Test strip opened vial stability was assessed in real time studies. Testing protocols
and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The manufacturer
claims an opened vial stability of six months at the recommended storage
temperatures of 4 – 40° C and 10-85% relative humidity.
Two control solutions (Level 1 and Level 2) are available for use with the Okmeter
Direct Blood Glucose Monitoring System. Value assignment and stability for the
control solutions were evaluated in k090609. The shelf life and opened vial stability
established in k090609 at 10– 40°C were 18 months and 90 days, respectively.
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range of the device is 20 - 600 mg/dL. This range was validated by the
linearity study (M.1.b).
e. Analytical specificity:
The sponsor tested substances for interference using three lots of test strips, five
meters, and three glucose concentrations in the ranges of 50 – 100, 200 – 275, and
400 – 500 mg/dL.

--- Page 7 ---
Venous whole blood samples were spiked to toxic levels or ten times the highest
recommended therapeutic or physiological level. Each test sample was then tested
five times per strip lot for a total of 15 measurements per sample per interferent.
The sponsor defined no significant interference as ≤ ± 10%. According to this
criterion no significant interference was seen at the following concentrations:
Interferent Level Tested
Acetaminophen 15 mg/dL
Ascorbic Acid 5 mg/dL
Aspirin 60 mg/dL
Bilirubin 90 mg/dL
Cholesterol 500 mg/dL
Creatinine 5 mg/dL
Dopamine 2 mg/dL
Galactose 900 mg/dL
Gentisic Acid 5 mg/dL
Hydroxyurea 3 mg/dL
L-dopa 10 mg/dL
Maltose 900 mg/dL
Methyldopa 3 mg/dL
Tolbutamide 400 mg/dL
Triglyceride 2000 mg/dL
Uric acid 8 mg/dL
However, the sponsor stated in the labeling that elevated concentrations of reducing
substances occurring in the blood naturally (uric acid) or from therapeutic treatments
(ascorbic acid, acetaminophen) may affect test results.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Fingerstick and Alternate Site Testing Comparison Studies:
To assess the performance of the OKmeter Direct Blood Glucose Monitoring System
in the intended use population the sponsor performed a study with 135 lay user
participants. The health care professional collected capillary blood from each
participant from each sampling site and analyzed it using an OKmeter Direct Blood
Glucose Monitoring System. Performance was evaluated by comparing blood glucose
results from the candidate BGMS obtained by the health care professional against the
reference value (YSI). The glucose concentration of the samples ranged from 57.8 to
391 mg/dL as measured by the reference method. The results are summarized in the

Fingerstick and Alternate Site Testing Comparison Studies:
To assess the performance of the OKmeter Direct Blood Glucose Monitoring System
in the intended use population the sponsor performed a study with 135 lay user
participants who did not have any experience using an OKmeter Direct Blood
Glucose Monitoring System. Training in this study consisted only of the participants
reading the OKmeter Direct user guide written in English. For each sampling site, the
participants collected and analyzed their own sample using the OKmeter Direct
system. Performance was evaluated by comparing blood glucose results from the
candidate BGMS obtained by the lay user against the reference value (YSI). The
glucose concentration of the samples ranged from 57.8 to 391 mg/dL as measured by
the reference method. The results are summarized in the tables below for three strip

Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
P.
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study
The effect of hematocrit levels was evaluated using venous whole blood samples with
hematocrit levels of 15 – 65% (15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60 and 65%) spiked
with glucose to achieve target concentrations of 80, 125, and 320 mg/dL. Twenty
measurements were obtained for each combination of glucose target concentration
and hematocrit and compared to the value obtained from the YSI The results
demonstrated that the OKmeter Direct Blood Glucose Monitoring System produces
accurate results over the claimed hematocrit range of 20 – 60%.
2. Sample Volume Study
The recommended minimum sample volume for the OKmeter Direct Blood Glucose
Monitoring System is 0.7 ml. The sponsor performed a study to determine the effect
of sample volumes from 0.5 to 1.5 ml in comparison to YSI. The study supports the
sponsor’s claimed minimum sample volume of 0.7 ml.
3. Altitude Study
An altitude study was performed in venous whole blood using three meters and three
lots of test strips at five glucose levels in the ranges of 30 – 50, 51 – 110, 111 – 150,
151 – 250, and 251 – 400 mg/dL. The meter results were compared to the reference
YSI at various altitudes up to 10335 feet (3150 meters). The study supports the
sponsor’s claimed maximum altitude of 10335 feet.
4. Temperature and Humidity Studies
To evaluate the effect of temperature and humidity the sponsor compared the meter
results vs. the reference method under the following environmental conditions:
Temperature (° C) Relative Humidity (%)
10 10
10 85
11

40 10
40 85
45 10
45 85
Three glucose concentrations (ranges 38 – 68, 132 – 188, and 280 – 420 mg/dL) were
tested in venous whole blood at each combination of temperature and humidity above
using three lots of strips. The study results support the claimed operating conditions
of 10 – 40° C and 10 – 85% relative humidity.
5. Infection Control
The OKmeter Direct Blood Glucose Meter is intended for single-patient use only.
Virucide efficacy testing was performed by an outside commercial testing service
using Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) demonstrating disinfection efficacy with
DISPATCH Hospital Cleaner Disinfectant Towels with Bleach (EPA Reg No.56392-
8) on the materials comprising the meter. The sponsor also conducted robustness
studies and demonstrated that there was no change in the performance or the external
materials for the meter after 520 cleaning and disinfection cycles to simulate 5 years
of single-patient use by lay-users. Each robustness cycle consisted of one pre-clean
wipe and one disinfecting wipe. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for
the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
6. Electromagnetic Compatibility
Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing was performed on OKmeter Direct,
Blood Glucose Meter. A signed technical compliance statement was provided to
demonstrate that the EMC testing was performed according to the standards listed in
the test report. The test report indicates that the OKmeter Direct Blood Glucose Meter
is compliant with the requirements of the listed standards.
7. Readability Assessment
The strip labeling and User’s Manual returned a Flesch-Kincaid reading level of 7.8
and 7.5 respectively.
8. Customer Service
Customer Support is available Monday - Friday from 9 am – 5 pm EST. The toll free
phone number is 1‑800-243-2636. Users are instructed to contact their healthcare
provider when customer support is not available.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
