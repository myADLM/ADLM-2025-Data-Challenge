L. Test Principle:
Dimension® Creatinine (CRE2) Flex® reagent cartridge is used to measure the creatinine
concentration in human serum, plasma, and urine on the Dimension® clinical chemistry
system using quantitative, photometric/colorimetric methods . The CRE2 method uses a
modified kinetic Jaffe technique to measure the creatinine concentration. In the presence of a
strong base such as sodium hydroxide, picrate reacts with creatinine to form a red
chromophore. The system monitors rate of increasing absorbance at 510 nm due to the
formation of this chromophore is directly proportional to the creatinine concentration in the
sample and is measured using a bichromatic (510, 600nm) rate technique. Bilirubin is
oxidized by potassium ferricyanide to prevent interference.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
The following data represent typical method performance. These data were collected on the
Dimension EXL 200 integrated chemistry system.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run (repeatability) and total imprecision (Intermediate precision) studies for
the Dimension® Creatinine (CRE2) Flex® reagent cartridge were designed from
CLSI Guideline EP5- A2, “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative
Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline – Second Edition.”
The precision/repeatability study was performed using two (2) serum pools, three (3)
levels of BioRad Multiqual serum material, two (levels) of BioRad Liquicheck urine
material and two (2) urine pool.
The samples were tested on Dimension® clinical chemistry system using five
different creatinine concentrations 0.71, 1.32, 1.79, 7.04 and 15.79 mg/dL,
respectively. The urine was tested with four different creatinine concentrations 39.31,
4

62.28, 142.80 and 339.56 mg/dL, respectively. For intermediate precision, testing
was performed over twenty (20) days, two (2) separate runs with two test samples for
each test material. The results are summarized below:

the 12 levels were compared with previously established target values. The results
from regression analysis are summarized below:

The results of the linearity study support the claimed measuring range of 5-400
mg/dL for creatinine in Dimension® Creatinine (CRE2) Flex® reagent cartridge
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability, stability and value assignment –
Traceability and value assignment: The values assigned to Dimension CHEM1
calibrator for creatinine are traceable to NIST SRM 914a. NIST SRM914a is an
Isotope Dilution-Liquid Chromatography/ Mass Spectrometry (IDMS) traceable
standard. The commutability of the creatinine working standards is verified using
recovery of NIST SRM 967, an IDMS traceable, commutable, and frozen serum
creatinine reference material. Dimension Instruments are calibrated with the
working standards and used to assign the product calibrators via the standard
value assignment process. The CHEM I calibrator described in the Dimension
Creatinine (CRE2) labeling was previously cleared. The 510(k) number for this
product is K860021.
A Flex® cartridge open well stability study was conducted to ensure the reagents
perform consistently throughout the claimed open well stability which is 3 days.
The protocol and acceptance criteria were found adequate.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank, Limit of Detection and Limit of Quantitation of Dimension®
Creatinine (CRE2) Flex® reagent cartridge were determined according to CLSI
EP17-A2 in the following manner:
LoB = Mean of Blank Measurement + 1.645 x Standard Deviation of Blank
Measurements
LoD = Limit of Blank + CpSDs
o Cp is a correction factor for the 95% CI normal variate to account for bias
in the SDS estimate.
o SDS is an estimate of method imprecision pooled from replicates of the
low analyte samples
The Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the Dimension® Creatinine (CRE2) Flex®
reagent cartridge for serum and plasma is 0.15 mg/dL and based on allowable total
error of 0.15 mg/dL, determined consistent with CLSI Guideline EP17-A2.

e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed for the creatinine measurement function by
evaluating potential interfering substances spiked into serum and urine pools at two
different creatinine levels, 1.5 and 5.0 mg/dL for serum/plasma, 40 to 175 mg/dL for
urine. CLSI EP7A2 was followed for the interference testing. Substances were spiked
into serum and urine pool to assess common or known substances which could
interfere with the Dimension® Creatinine (CRE2) Flex® reagent cartridge. The
sponsor defines interference as bias exceeding 10%. The following substances
produced less than 10% deviation when tested on Dimension® Creatinine (CRE2)

Females (0.55 to 1.02 mg/dL (Clin Chem 54:3 (2008)).
Urine
Published reference ranges were validated for urine specimens using samples from
twenty normal healthy adult female donors and twenty-two normal healthy adult male
donors following CLSI C28-A3c. Samples were processed N=1 using the Dimension
CRE2 assay. The range was considered validated if ≤10% of the samples fell outside of
established range.
