L. Test Principle:
The i-QARE DS-W Blood Glucose Monitoring System uses electrochemical methodologies.
The system quantitatively measures blood glucose levels using an amperometric method.
The system employs glucose oxidase enzyme chemistry. The electrons generated during this
reaction are transferred from the blood to the electrodes. The magnitude of the resultant
current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the specimen and the signal is
converted into a readout displayed on the meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The sponsor performed repeatability (with-in run precision) studies using venous
whole blood samples at five glucose concentrations (target values 40, 80, 120, 200,
and 300 mg/dL) using 10 meters. Each glucose concentration was analyzed in
replicates of 40 for each of three strip lots resulting in a total of 120 measurements
per concentration. Results are summarized below:

Intermediate precision was evaluated by using three levels of glucose control
solutions with target concentrations of 80, 130, and 320 mg/dL. Each sample was
measured twenty times per day over ten days using the DS-W Blood Glucose Meter,
for a total of 200 tests per glucose level. This procedure was followed for each of
three strip lots.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor performed linearity studies using adjusted venous blood samples with
eight different glucose concentrations (as measured by YSI) of 17, 45, 101, 149, 245,
328, 538, and 603 mg/dL. For each glucose concentration, twenty-one measurements
were made per strip lot, for each of 3 test strip lots. The data from the DS-W Blood
Glucose Monitoring System was compared to the reference method (YSI). Results
from linear regression analyses were as follows:
Strip Lot Slope y-intercept R2
Lot #1 1.0078 0.1256 0.9989
Lot #2 1.0053 1.6559 0.9995
Lot #3 0.998 2.2109 0.9993
The results of this study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measuring range of 20
– 600 mg/dL. Results less than 20 mg/dL will be displayed as LO, and results greater
than 600 mg/dL will be displayed as HI.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The i-QARE DS-W Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to the NIST SRM
917b reference material. The method comparison study was performed using the
candidate device and YSI as the reference method (see Section 2.a.).
Test Strip Stability:
Test strip stability was assessed in accelerated and real time studies. Testing
protocols and acceptance criteria for the i-QARE DS-W Draw-in Blood Glucose Test
Strips were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor claims shelf life
stability of 18 months and an open-vial stability of 90 days when stored as
recommended: 39.2°F-89.6°F (4°C – 32°C) and 10-90% relative humidity.
Control Solution Stability:
The Alliance Blood Glucose Control Solutions that are used with the i-QARE DS-W
Blood Glucose Monitoring System were previously cleared under k082965. The
closed-vial stability claim for the control solutions is 18 months when stored at
6

solutions is 90 days from first opening when stored at 68°F-86°F (20°C to 30°C).
d. Detection limit:
The measuring range for this device is 20 – 600 mg/dL. Please refer to the linearity
study in section M.1.b. above.
e. Analytical specificity:
To assess potential interference the sponsor used venous whole blood samples
adjusted to two glucose concentration intervals of 70 to 75 mg/dL and 200 to 250
mg/dL. Each of these samples was divided into a test pool and a control pool and
each of the potential endogenous and exogenous interfering substances was added to
the test pool. Each substance was tested at a minimum of two concentrations,
normal/therapeutic and high/toxic concentrations. The % difference between the test
sample and the control sample was calculated. The sponsor defines no significant
interference as ≤ ± 10 % difference for each individual replicate relative to the control
sample. Results are presented in the table below:
Highest concentration at

2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes X or No ________.
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger,
forearm, or palm. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary
action.
5. Calibration:
Users are instructed to match the code number of the test strip to that displayed by the
meter for each box of test strips.
6. Quality Control:
Glucose control solutions (previously cleared, k082965) at two different concentrations
(Level 1 and Level 2) can be run with this device and Control Level 1 is provided with
the kit. The meter automatically distinguishes control solution from blood and marks
control solution tests with a check mark and excludes them from average calculations.
Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. An
acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip bottle label. The user is
cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.
Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
P.
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Altitude Study:
The effect of altitude on device performance was evaluated with one test strip lot and
five meters using contrived venous blood samples from three donors. Samples were
spiked to 5 glucose concentrations (50, 120, 200, 350, and 500 mg/dL). The samples
were tested at 2543, 5446, 6529, and 8563 feet above sea level and at sea level (0 feet)
as a control. Results obtained were compared with those obtained with the reference
method (YSI). The results demonstrate acceptable bias to the reference to support the
claims in the labeling that altitudes up to 8563 feet have no significant effect on blood
glucose measurements from the DS-W Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
2. Hematocrit Study:
The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated using venous whole blood
11

--- Page 12 ---
samples with hematocrit levels of 20 – 60% (20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55 and 60%)
spiked with glucose to achieve concentrations of 50, 120, 250, and 500 mg/dL. Results
of samples at each hematocrit level were compared to samples with the same glucose
concentration at normal (40%) hematocrit as well as to the corresponding YSI value.
The % bias of the i-QARE DS-W Blood Glucose meter results relative to YSI
demonstrated adequate performance to support the claimed hematocrit range of 20 –
60%.
3. Test System operating conditions:
The sponsor evaluated the effect of temperature and relative humidity (RH) on the
performance of the DS-W Blood Glucose Monitoring System using venous blood
samples at 50, 250, and 500 mg/dL glucose. The following combined temperature and
humidity conditions were evaluated and compared with results obtained with the YSI
reference method:14°, 18°, 22°, 25°, 28°, 32°, 36°, and 40°C at relative humidities of
10, 40, 65, and 95%. The study results support the claimed operating temperature
range of 57°F to 104°F (14°C to 40°C) with relative humidity of 10 – 95%.
4. EMC Testing:
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electromagnetic testing
(EMC) had been performed.
5. Readability Assessment:
The readability of the labeling (Owner’s Booklet, Control Solution Insert, and Test
Strip Insert) using a Flesch-Kincaid analysis were found to be written at an 8th grade
level or below.
6. Software documentation:
The software documentation was reviewed and found to be acceptable. The firm
provided documentation to support the device was designed, developed and is under
good software lifecycle processes.
7. Infection Control Studies:
The device system is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies
were performed on the materials comprising the meter by an outside commercial
testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of Hepatitis B Surface Antigen
(HBsAg) with the chosen disinfectant, Dispatch Hospital Cleaner Disinfectant with
Bleach (EPA Registration # 56392-8). Robustness studies were also performed by the
sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials of
the meter after 260 cleaning and disinfection cycles with the Dispatch wipes. The
robustness studies were designed to simulate 5 years of single-patient use. Labeling
was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection
procedures.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
