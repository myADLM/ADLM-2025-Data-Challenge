I. Device Description:
This submission is for a single drug in the gram negative ID/AST or AST only panel. The ID
System was not reviewed.
The Phoenix AST method is a broth based microdilution test. The Phoenix panel is a sealed and
self-inoculating molded polystyrene tray, with 136 micro-wells containing dried reagents. The
ID/AST combination panel includes an ID side (51 wells) with dried substrates for bacterial
identification and an AST side (85 wells). The AST panel contains a wide range of two-fold
doubling dilution concentrations of antimicrobial agents and growth and fluorescent controls at
appropriate well locations. The AST panel does not include wells for isolate identification.
The Phoenix System utilizes a redox indicator for the detection of organism growth in the
presence of an antimicrobial agent. The organism to be tested must be a pure culture and be
preliminarily identified as gram positive or gram negative. Colonies are then suspended in ID
broth, and equated to a 0.5 McFarland suspension using a nephelometer device. A further
dilution is made into AST broth (a cation-adjusted formulation of Mueller-Hinton broth
containing 0.010% Tween 80), to which the redox-buffered oxidation-reduction AST indicator
solution is added producing a blue color in the wells. The concentration of organisms in the final
AST broth suspension is approximately 5 X 105 CFU/mL.
The Phoenix AST Broth is poured into the inoculation port of the AST panel and the inoculum
flows into the panel, filling panel wells. Polyethylene caps are applied to seal the inoculation
ports. An air admittance port is located in the panel lid to ensure adequate oxygen tension in the
panel for the duration of the test. Inoculated panels are barcode scanned and loaded into the BD
Phoenix Automated Microbiology System instrument where panels are continuously incubated at
35˚ C ± 1˚ C.
Continuous measurements of changes to the indicator as well as bacterial turbidity are used in the
determination of bacterial growth. The instrument takes readings every 20 minutes. Organisms
growing in the presence of a given antimicrobial agent reduce the indicator (changing it to a pink
color). This signals organism growth and resistance to that antimicrobial agent. Organisms killed
or inhibited by the antimicrobial agent do not cause reduction of the indicator and therefore do
not produce a color change. The Phoenix instrument reads and records the results of the
antimicrobial tests contained in the panel and interprets the reactions (based on the organism
identification) to give a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) value and category
interpretations (susceptible, intermediate, resistant or not susceptible). AST results are available
within 4 to 16 hours. This is an autoread result; no manual readings are possible with this system.

L. Test Principle:
The AST portion of the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System is a broth-based
microdilution method that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-reduction) to enhance
detection of organism growth. The MIC is determined by comparing growth in wells containing
serial two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the growth in growth control wells which contain no
antibiotic.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing was conducted at two external sites and one internal site. Testing was
performed using inocula prepared manually and standardized using both the PhoenixSpec
nephelometer and using the BD Phoenix AP instrument. Results were compared to the modal
range.
Twelve organisms with on-scale meropenem MIC values were provided to the testing
sites by BD with isolate identification and expected MIC result blinded to the testers.
Isolates were tested in triplicate on three separate days.
Results of inter-site and intra-site reproducibility studies were acceptable and
demonstrated best-case and worst case of greater than 95%. A summary of the
reproducibility study performance is illustrated in Table 2 below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The FDA and CLSI recommended quality control isolates E.coli ATCC 25922 and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were tested each day of the Challenge and Accuracy
(Clinical) Studies with the reference method and with the BD Phoenix System. The inocula
were standardized using both the automated (Phoenix AP) and manual (PhoenixSpec)
inoculum dilution/standardization methods. A sufficient number of tests were performed and
all quality control results for the BD Phoenix fell within the acceptable ranges demonstrating
that the BD Phoenix System can consistently produce quality control results in the
recommended range for meropenem.

BD Phoenix Panel range for Meropenem is 0.125-32 ug/mL.
Growth Failure Rate: Seven isolates of Pseudomonas species failed to grow during the
clinical study. The overall growth rate of 99.6% is acceptable.
Purity Check Plates: Purity check plates were inoculated from the standardized
organism suspensions for both the Phoenix and reference methods. Any isolate that
showed mixed growth on the purity check plate was considered noncompliant and not
included in result analysis.
Inoculum Density Control: The BD PhoenixSpec Nephelometer was used to prepare
the inocula for testing of the clinical, challenge, reproducibility and QC isolates. The
same inoculum suspension was used for both the Phoenix System and the reference
method testing. The BD Phoenix AP instrument was used to standardize the inocula
for challenge, QC, and reproducibility isolates. Validation data for both the
PhoenixSpec and the Phoenix AP instrument was provided and found to be
acceptable.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The accuracy of results obtained with the Phoenix System was determined by
comparison to the CLSI-recommended broth dilution method (reference method).
Reference panels were prepared according to CLSI M07-A8 guidelines. Sites
performed testing on gram-negative isolates using Phoenix and reference panel
formats appropriate for gram negative organisms. Antimicrobial agents in the test
and reference panels had identical dilution ranges which were appropriate for the
interpretive breakpoints of the drug. Testing was performed using at least two
different production lots of Phoenix panels, AST broth and AST indicator at each
study site. A minimum of three different lots of the Phoenix panel were used across
all sites for the entire study. Phoenix and reference panels were inoculated using the
same organism suspension.
Growth in the Phoenix panels was determined from data recorded by the instrument.
Performance was analyzed using FDA breakpoints for meropenem, and results were
compared to results obtained by the broth micro broth dilution reference method
based on the guidelines provided in the Class II Special Controls Guidance
Document: Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems.
A total of 1089 clinical isolates were tested at the three study sites and included both
fresh and stock isolates. Stock isolates comprised 10.6% of total isolates tested.
Clinical isolates tested included representatives of species listed in the FDA
pharmaceutical drug label. Clinical isolates were tested using inocula prepared using
the PhoenixSpec nephelometer (manual method).
A total of 113 challenge isolates were supplied to the testing sites by the sponsor.
Challenge isolates were obtained from BD’s internal collection and from external
laboratories. Results obtained for Challenge isolates using the Phoenix System were
compared to expected MIC results; expected MIC values and categorical
interpretations were derived from testing with multiple lots of reference broth dilution
panels over a three-month period. The challenge set was divided into subsets and an
individual subset was distributed to each of the three study sites. Identification and
8

--- Page 9 ---
expected results were masked to the study sites. The inocula for the challenge
isolates were prepared using both the PhoenixSpec nephelometer (manual method)
and the Phoenix AP (automated method).
The performance evaluation summary of essential and categorical agreement results
for clinical, and challenge isolates with inocula prepared using the PhoenixSpec
nephelometer (manual method) is shown in the Table 4 below:

interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees exactly with the
interpretation of the BD Phoenix result.
For the clinical and challenge organism testing performed for meropenem using the
BD Phoenix, the overall % EA and % CA consistently met the acceptance criteria of
greater than or equal to 90%. There were 3 major errors (0.3%) (acceptance criteria ≤
3%) and one very major error.
There were no instances of growth failure with either clinical or challenge isolates.
For challenge isolates two methods of organism suspension standardization were used
in the evaluation of meropenem with the Phoenix System. Suspensions were prepared
using both the PhoenixSpec nephelometer (manual method) and the Phoenix AP
instrument (automated method). A comparison of the performance of the two
standardization methods is illustrated in Table 6 below.
