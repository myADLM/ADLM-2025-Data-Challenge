4. Special instrument requirements:
ABL90 FLEX Analyzer
I. Device Description:
Neonate Bilirubin (nBili) is a new test offered on the ABL90 FLEX Analyzer. The ABL90
FLEX Analyzer is a point of care and clinical laboratory instrument and has been previously
cleared (k092686) for pH, pO2, pCO2, Sodium, Potassium, Calcium, Chloride, Glucose,
Lactate, ctHB, sO2, fO Hb, fCOHb, fMetHb, fHHb and fHbF. Enabling the nBili
2
measurement is accomplished through software design changes introduced in software
version 2.6 by adding the bilirubin calculation algorithm. No hardware or mechanical
changes were needed.

L. Test Principle:
Neonatal bilirubin measured in heparinized whole blood on the ABL90 FLEX analyzer using
spectrophotometric multi-component analysis through the instrument’s existing CO-
Oximetry module on a hemolyzed part of the sample. This optical system of the ABL90
FLEX analyzer is designed to measure total hemoglobin and hemoglobin fractions as well as
oxygen saturation.

Internal Testing
The internal precision study was performed as follows:
· A 20 day internal precision study was performed as specified in the CLSI
Guideline EP5-A2 using one analyzer and three operators. Three levels of
aqueous control solutions covering the device measuring range were analyzed in 2
runs per day with 2 replicates for each level. This generated within-run and total
imprecision data for aqueous solutions of bilirubin. The results for both capillary
and syringe mode are summarized below.
· An additional internal precision study was performed using freshly drawn whole
blood, and freshly drawn cord blood, both spiked with bilirubin to obtain low,
medium, and high bilirubin levels covering the device measuring range. All
samples were adjusted to total hemoglobin (tHb) ~18g/dL and tonometered to 95
– 100% saturation to mimic neonate whole blood. All six levels of the prepared
samples were analyzed in 5 runs with 5 replicates for each level. The results for
both capillary and syringe mode are summarized below.

External Testing
The external precision study was performed at three Point-of-Care (POC) sites as follows:
· A 20 day external precision study was performed as specified in the CLSI
Guideline EP5-A2 using one analyzer and three operators per site. Three levels of
aqueous control solutions covering the device measuring range were analyzed in 2
runs per day with 2 replicates for each level. This generated within-run and total
imprecision data for aqueous solutions of bilirubin. The results for both capillary
and syringe mode are summarized below.
· An additional external precision study was performed using freshly drawn adult
whole blood spiked with bilirubin to obtain low, medium, and high bilirubin
levels covering the device measuring range. All samples were adjusted to tHb
~18g/dL and tonometered to 95 – 100% saturation to mimic neonate whole blood.
Three levels of bilirubin were analyzed in 5 runs with 5 replicates for each level
in one day. The results for both capillary and syringe mode are summarized
below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed using a low concentration bilirubin sample, a high
concentration bilirubin sample, and nine intermediate concentration bilirubin samples
made by combining proportions of the low and high samples volumetrically. The
high, low, and intermediate samples were run in replicates of four in one day. The
data was analyzed in accordance with CLSI EP-6 with sample range tested from 0.9
to 40.3 mg/dL. The method is linear (first order) over the entire measuring range and
yields the following linear regression results: Y= 0.968X + 0.2984, R2= 0.9996.
These linearity results demonstrate the linearity of the device across the claimed
measuring range of 1.6 – 37.9 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
There is no unique calibration measurement for nBili. The concentration of total
hemoglobin (ctHb ) calibration curve is used in nBili measurements. The ctHb calibrator
was previously cleared in k092686.
The ctHb calibrators are traceable to Hemoglobin Cyanide Standard purchased
commercially, which is traceable to the NIST Reference materials.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection was determined in accordance with CLSI EP-17A. For the
blank samples, whole cord blood specimens had the plasma fraction replaced with
saline. In order to calculate the limit of detection (LOD), five whole blood samples,
with bilirubin concentrations in the range of 0.5 to 2.0 mg/dL were each assessed in
replicates of four on two instruments over a minimum of three days. The limit of
blank (LOB) was calculated from these results using the 95 percentile of the
th
ascending rank ordered values for each instrument. The mean LOB calculated from
the two instruments was 0.82 mg/dL. The LOD was calculated as LOD = LOB + C
p
(Std Dev) and resulted in a mean LOD from the two instruments of 1.2 mg/dL. To
determine LoQ, fourteen whole blood samples with bilirubin concentrations in the
range of 0.35 to 2.45 mg/dL were each assessed in replicates of five on two
instruments over a minimum of three days. LoQ was determined to be 1.2 mg/dL
based on a mean %CV equal to or less than 20%.
The nbili measuring range is 1.6 – 37.9 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was performed by spiking the test matrix with cord blood samples
to tHb ~18 g/dL and sO2 close to 100% in order to mimic neonatal whole blood, then
spiking these samples with interferents at the concentrations shown below. The
interference has been tested at 2 levels of bilirubin, 5 mg/dL and 15 mg/dL. Sponsor
defines non-significant interference as <10% bias between the spiked and unspiked
samples. Sponsor defines significant interference to be ≥10% bias. The tables below
summarize the interference testing results.

There was non-significant interference with Evans Blue, Intralipid, HbF, Hemolysis,
and Triglyceride at the highest concentration indicated below: (Sponsor defines non-
significant interference as < ± 10%)

Based on the initial screening interference testing, the following substances have the
following interferences observed.
Fluorescein tested at 40 mg/L yielded a -309% bias at 5 mg/dL bilirubin level and a -
111% bias at 15 mg/dL bilirubin. Patent Blue V tested at 10 mg/L yielded a -94%
bias at 5 mg/dL bilirubin level and a -44% bias at 15 mg/dL bilirubin. Methylene
Blue tested at 60 mg/L yielded a -449% bias at 5 mg/dL bilirubin level and a -120%
bias at 15 mg/dL bilirubin. Cardio Green tested at 30 mg/L yielded a -82% bias at 5
mg/dL bilirubin level and a -36% bias at 15 mg/dL bilirubin. SHb tested at 10%
yielded a 150% bias at 5 mg/dL bilirubin level and a 35% bias at 15 mg/dL bilirubin.
Hydroxocobalamin Hydrochloride tested at 2 mg/L yielded a -15.8% bias at 5 mg/dL
bilirubin level and a -85% bias at 15 mg/dL bilirubin. Cyanocobalamin tested at 2
mg/L yielded a -9% bias at 5 mg/dL bilirubin level and a -73% bias at 15 mg/dL
bilirubin.
Since there was significant interference for Fluorescein, Patent Blue V, Methylene
Blue, Cardio Green, SHb, Hydroxocobalamin Hydrochloride, and Cyanocobalamin
based on an initial screening test. (Sponsor defines significant interference as ≥ ±
10%) Sponsor performed a dose response interference test per CLSI EP7-A2 and
determined the concentration at which the interfering substance does not interfere
with the assay. The dose response test results are provided in the table below.

pH interference was tested at levels from 6.8 to 7.9 and no significant interference
was found.
In addition, Cyanmethemoglobulin (HiCN) and Beta-carotene are known interferents
with the assay because the spectra for HiCN and Beta-carotene overlap with the
spectrum of bilirubin. Results from samples containing these substances should not
be used. The sponsor has the following limitation listed in the label:
“Since the spectra for HiCN and Beta-carotene overlap with the spectrum of bilirubin,
these are known interfering substances. Results from samples containing these
substances should not be used.”

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison study versus the predicate device (ABL835 analyzer) was
conducted according to CLSI guideline “Method Comparison and Bias Estimation
Using Patient Samples”, EP09-A2. The study was conducted for both capillary and
syringe mode at three point-of-care sites and included a total of 224 samples for
capillary mode and 210 samples for syringe mode spanning the entire measuring
range. Freshly drawn whole blood neonate samples were tested on the predicate
device first and the left over samples were tested on the candidate device. In order to
cover the reportable range spiked blood samples were used. Spiked samples
contributed no more than 20% of the total number of samples at each site for this
