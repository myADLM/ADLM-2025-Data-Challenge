M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision Studies were conducted utilizing the Carolina Liquid Chemistries HDL
Cholesterol Reagent on the Carolina Liquid Chemistries CLC 720 Chemistry Analyzer
following the recommendations in the CLSI guideline EP5-A2. A total of three serum-
based control materials were analyzed 40 times for the within-run precision, and were
analyzed in triplicate two times per day for 20 non-consecutive days for the total
precision analysis. A single reagent lot and instrument was used for the analysis.The
results are summarized below:

The sponsor performed the following additional precision studies on the Carolina Liquid
Chemistries CLC 720 Chemistry Analyzer following recommendations in the CLSI guideline
EP5-A2. Two clinical sample pools were analyzed 20 times for the within-run precision, and
were analyzed two times per day, for 30 non-consecutive days, for the total precision
determination. A single reagent lot (different lot from above described study) and instrument

165.2 mg/dL.

8.6 to 165.2 mg/dL 0.83 1.002 1.00
The sponsor demonstrated acceptable linearity from 8.6 to 165.2 mg/dL.
The claimed measuring range of the device is from 9 to 150 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The sponsor recommends the use of a commercially available calibrator (the JAS
Diagnostics HDL Calibrator traceable to NIST SRM 911b) which was previously cleared
in k021671.
Stability testing was performed by the manufacturer. The reagents are stable for 12
months when stored between 2-8 °C.
On board stability was performed on the CLC 720 Chemistry Analyzer demonstrated that
the reagents are stable for 30 days when stored on board the CLC 720 Chemistry
Analyzer when stored at 2-8 °C.
The reagent system has not been tested or certified by the Cholesterol Reference Method
Laboratory Network (CRMLN). The labeling contains language that the device has not
been certified by the CRMLN.
d. Detection limit:
A limit of detection study was conducted based on procedures described in CLSI EP17-
A. The limit of the blank (LoB) of 0.16 mg/dL was calculated from data using a pooled
serum sample diluted with 0.85 % sodium chloride assayed 8 times and repeated for a
total of ten individually calibrated runs to produce 80 results. The LoD of 0.53 mg/dL
was calculated as the LoB plus the one-tailed 95% confidence interval of the test results.
The LoQ of 6.48 mg/dL was determined with a performance goal of <20% CV and is
lower than the lower limit of the measuring range which is set at 9 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
To determine the level of interference from substances normally present in human serum,
the Carolina Liquid Chemistries HDL Cholesterol Reagent was tested with low level
HDL serum samples containing about 32-38 mg/dL HDL-C and high level HDL serum
samples containing about 62-72 mg/dL HDL-C. Both levels were spiked with various
concentrations of potentially interfering substances following the recommendations in the

CLSI guideline EP7-A2 on the CLC 720 Chemistry Analyzer. A total of four or six
levels were tested for interferents and all samples were tested in six runs with eight
replicates. The following substances normally present in serum produced less than 10%
deviation when tested at levels equal to the following concentrations:
Interference Substance Concentration
Bilirubin 20 mg/dL
(conjugated and unconjugated)
Hemolysis 200 mg/dL
Lipemia 800 mg/dL
Ascorbic Acid 30 mg/dL
γ-Globulin 5 g/dL
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were conducted following the recommendations in the
CLSI EP9-A2 guideline.
80 serum samples were assayed in parallel by singlicate runs on both the Carolina
Liquid Chemistries HDL Cholesterol Reagent on the Carolina Liquid Chemistries
CLC 720 Chemistry Analyzer and a predicate method. The results were analyzed by
using Deming regression. The range tested was 11.2 mg/dL to 150.2 mg/dL. Altered
samples were included in the study (16%).
The comparison by Deming regression resulted in a slope of 0.958 (95%CI = 0.939 to
0.977), an intercept of 1.06 (95%CI = -0.32 to 2.45), correlation coefficient = 0.9961,
and a standard error of 2.43.
