L. Test Principle:
The ICEPlex C. difficile Assay is a molecular diagnostic test for the qualitative detection of
toxigenic C. difficile nucleic acids isolated and purified from liquid or soft stool specimens.
This test targets the C. difficile toxin B encoding gene (tcdB).
The PrimeraDx ICEPlex system uses Scalable Target Analysis Routine (STAR) technology.
STAR employs sequential sampling and analysis of fluorescently end-labeled PCR products
(amplicons) by means of Capillary Electrophoresis (CE). Separation of the amplicons is
facilitated by appropriate primer design allowing for discrimination by size and fluorescent
signal after CE separation. In a molecular diagnostic assay performed on an ICEPlex system,
all targets (including sample template, controls and internal calibration standards) are
independently assessed within a single reaction well.
Real-time sampling of the amplicons allows for the construction of amplification curves and
calculation of threshold cycle (Ct) similar to other real-time PCR methods.
To run the ICEPlex C. difficile Assay, nucleic acids are first extracted from stool specimens
with the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG system. An ICEPlex system PCR plate is
assembled combining PCR buffer, PCR enzyme, primer mix containing fluorescently end-
labeled oligonucleotide primers for assay controls and targets, calibration controls mix, and
purified DNA from the clinical sample spiked with internal control. The PCR plate is placed
in the thermal cycler module of the ICEPlex system and, after inputting sample and assay
information into the integrated software, the run is initiated.
At specific PCR cycles, the capillaries and electrodes of capillary electrophoresis module are
introduced into the PCR reaction. The ICEPlex system applies voltage for a predetermined
time to force negatively charged DNA molecules to enter the capillary ─ a process known as
electrokinetic injection. The capillaries and electrodes are then moved and are immersed in a
CE buffer, voltage is applied, and capillary electrophoresis separation is performed. The PCR
cycling and CE separation are timed to match one complete CE separation within two PCR
cycles. All amplicons (including internal calibration controls) are separated, detected and
quantified by CE using laser induced fluorescence detection. At the end of the PCR
amplification, capillaries and electrodes are chemically decontaminated to remove the
residual amplified PCR fragments and to recondition the capillary array for a new assay run.
The ICEPlex system software automatically processes the raw data and reports positive,
negative, or invalid results for the detection of the C. difficile tcdB gene target.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The within-laboratory precision was estimated on a panel of samples prepared by
6

--- Page 7 ---
spiking an appropriate amount of C. difficile culture strain BAA-1805 into a pooled
clinical negative stool matrix. The blinded panel members included: low positive
sample (near assay limit of detection, expected positive >95% of the time),
moderately positive sample (expected to be positive approximately 100% of the
time), negative sample (expected to be negative approximately 100% of the time),
and a C20-80 sample (expected to be positive 20 – 80% of the time). The panel also
included positive and negative controls.
The precision study consisted of two operators; three lots of ICEPlex C. difficile
Assay kits; and three ICEPlex instruments. The precision study was run over 12 non-
consecutive days with two runs per day and two replicates of each sample per run.
One negative sample (out of a total of 144 observations) and one low positive sample
(out of a total of 144 observations) produced invalid results during the study. Overall
results are summarized in the following table.

Reproducibility was evaluated at three independent laboratory sites using a study
panel with the same strain and concentrations as described for the precision study.
Panel samples were tested at each independent laboratory site by two operators for
five days with two runs per day and three replicates of each panel member per run.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
In-reaction controls:
Calibration control: A group of ICEPlex specific elements used to align
electropherograms and assign identities of the target peaks. It also controls for the
integrity of the kit reagents and the presence of PCR inhibitors.
Internal Control: Non-target nucleic acid that is co-extracted and co-amplified with
the tcdB target. It controls for nucleic acid extraction efficiency, for the integrity of
the reagents and for the presence of PCR inhibitors in a given sample. Detection of
the Internal Control is not required for a positive result. The Internal Control needs to
be spiked into each sample before extraction.
External controls:
Negative Control: Substitute Stool Transport and Recovery (S.T.A.R., Roche
Diagnostics Coporation) buffer for the clinical specimen and process normally
through the easyMAG extraction system and on the ICEPlex Instrument.
Positive Control: This control is used for the PCR stage only. It should not be
processed for nucleic acids extraction. In the positive control reaction, substitute
extracted sample with provided Positive Control. Note: Provided Positive Control
must be diluted 1:10 prior to use to ensure target concentration is at the appropriate
level.
Known Positive Sample: It is also required to include a previously characterized
positive sample or simulated sample with every easyMAG extraction run and include
it in the subsequent ICEPlex Instrument run to verify successful lysis.
Sample stability:
Sample stability studies were conducted using C. difficile strains spiked into negative
stool matrix at low positive, moderate positive, and below LoD concentrations.
Sample stability was evaluated for fresh sample storage at 2 - 8°C, for fresh versus
frozen storage at -70°C +/- 10°C, and for multiple freeze/thaw cycles at -70°C +/-
10°C. The results support sample storage at 2 - 8°C for 48 hours, at -70°C +/- 10°C
for 15 months, and for one freeze thaw cycle at -70°C +/- 10°C. More than one
freeze thaw cycle is not recommended as it may lead to a higher rate of invalid
results.
d. Detection limit:
Analytical sensitivity of the ICEPlex C. difficile Assay was determined using a two-
fold serial dilution of two C. difficile strains that were spiked into qualified negative
stool and processed according to ICEPlex C. difficile Assay Instructions for Use.
9

--- Page 10 ---
Twenty replicates at each concentration level were tested on three different ICEPlex
instruments. Analytical sensitivity of the assay was defined as the lowest
concentration at which at least 95% of all replicates were reported positive. The LoD
was validated by testing an additional 20 replicates at the target concentration.
LoD of the ICEPlex C. difficile assay determined for:
• C. difficile strain 43255 (630) (Toxinotype 0): 8CFU/rxn
• C. difficile strain BAA-1805 (Toxinotype III): 2CFU/rxn
LoD study results are acceptable.
Analytical reactivity/ inclusivity
To assess the analytical inclusivity of the ICEPlex C. difficile Assay, a set of 20
additional toxigenic strains of C. difficile were spiked into pooled negative matrix at a
level approximately three times above the assay LoD. Spiked samples were processed
in accordance with the ICEPlex C. difficile Assay Instructions for Use. Two samples
out of a total of 81 samples tested produced invalid assay results. The results of the
study are as follows:

Well-to-well Cross Contamination and Run-to-run Carryover Contamination:
Samples for Well-to-well Cross Contamination and Run-to-run Carryover
Contamination study were prepared by extracting a series of high positive samples
(with analyte concentration exceeding the concentration found in 95% positive
samples in the intended use population) alternating with negative samples. Location
of positive and negative samples on the extraction instrument was altered run-to-run.
On the ICEPlex system, high positive and negative samples were run in a
checkerboard fashion. In the consecutive run, the plate map was inverted to allow
wells and capillaries that were running negative samples to run positive samples. The
study included 6 runs: each run had 24 high positive and 24 negative samples for a
total of 144 samples for all runs. The overall invalid rate was 2%. The study
identified no well-to-well or run-to run contamination in the negative samples (0 false
positives out of 141 valid negatives).
The well-to-well cross contamination and run-to-run carryover contamination study
results are acceptable.
f. Assay cut-off:
A panel of 43 C. difficile positive and 45 negative clinical samples from the intended
use population were collected and tested with the ICEPlex C. difficile Assay.
Numerical readout data was extracted from the ICEPlex system, and Receiver
Operator Curve (ROC) analysis was applied to the data. An ROC specificity/
sensitivity decision plot was used to determine the cut-off level with optimal assay
sensitivity and specificity. The cut-off value was determined at 12 copies per
reaction.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
A prospective clinical study was conducted at three independent sites to compare
performance of the ICEPlex C. difficile Assay Kit on the ICEPlex System to toxigenic
C. difficile direct culture. This study tested specimens from patients suspected of
gastrointestinal tract infection with toxigenic strains of C. difficile bacteria. Each of
13

--- Page 14 ---
the sites tested the ICEPlex C. difficile Assay on specimens collected at the site. The
specimens collected from all three sites were tested by toxigenic C. difficile direct
culture at a single reference laboratory site. A total of 1103 (806 fresh, 297 frozen)
samples were collected and enrolled. 97 frozen samples were excluded from the
analysis due to improper storage conditions and temperature excursions. An
additional 37 samples were excluded due to study protocol deviations. 969
specimens were compliant and met all protocol requirements. 952 out of 969 (98.2%)
gave reportable results and were included in the statistical analysis. 68 out of 969
compliant samples were invalid upon initial testing (7.0% initial invalid rate), and 17
of these 68 samples remained invalid upon retest (1.8% invalid rate). Three out of the
17 unresolved invalids were reported positive by direct culture. Results were
reported in percent agreements as performance was compared to direct culture. The
Clopper-Pearson exact method was used to calculate confidence intervals.

To perform the test, liquid or soft stool is collected in a standard sterile container that can
be sealed. Samples can be stored cold for up to 48 hours prior to testing or frozen at
-70°C or below if not processed within 48 hours. Sample extraction is performed using
bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG System as per the ICEPlex C. difficile Assay
instruction for use. PCR reagent master mix is prepared using primer mix, PCR enzyme,
PCR buffer and calibrators. In a designated well of the PCR plate, 40 μL of ICEPlex C.
difficile Master Mix is aliquoted and 10 μL of extracted sample is added. Negative and
positive controls are added in designated wells of the PCR plate. After the PCR plate is
prepared, it is placed in the ICEPlex System to execute an instrument run for the
detection of the Clostridium difficile toxin B gene (tcdB gene).
The PrimeraDx ICEPlex system employs sequential sampling and analysis of
fluorescently labeled PCR products (amplicons) by means of Capillary Electrophoresis
(CE). Separation of the amplicons is facilitated by appropriate primer design allowing for
accurate discrimination by size and fluorescent signal after CE separation. This analysis
method supports multiplexing in a single reaction well since all targets (including sample
template, controls and internal calibration standards) can be detected from a single
reaction well.
Real-time sampling of the amplicons is used for the construction of amplification curves
and calculations of threshold cycle (Ct) similar to other real-time PCR methods.
To run an assay on the ICEPlex system, a PCR plate is assembled and placed in the
thermal cycler module of the ICEPlex system and, after manually inputting sample and
assay information into the integrated software, the run is initiated.
At specific PCR cycles, the capillaries and electrodes of the capillary electrophoresis
module are introduced into the PCR reaction. The ICEPlex system applies voltage for a
predetermined time to force negatively charged DNA molecules to enter the capillary ─ a
process commonly known as electrokinetic injection. The capillaries and electrodes are
then moved and are immersed in a CE buffer, voltage is applied, and capillary
electrophoresis separation is performed. The PCR cycling and CE separation are timed to
match one complete CE separation within two PCR cycles. All amplicons (including
internal calibration controls) are separated, detected and quantified by CE using laser
induced fluorescence detection. At the end of the PCR amplification, capillaries and
electrodes are chemically decontaminated to remove the residual amplified PCR
fragments and to recondition the capillary array for a new assay run.

3. Specimen Identification:
The user first must verify that the onboard consumables are adequate for the run.
Adequate supplies are indicated by the appearance of the buttons shown in the status bar,
or by touching the System navigation menu to display the Run Status screen. The Run
Status screen provides status information about the current run, the onboard consumables,
and instrument messages. The user then registers an IVD assay kit from a barcode label
that is included with a PrimeraDx assay IVD kit. The barcode scanner is used to register
the IVD assay kit and make a corresponding assay definition available on the instrument.
The assay definition needs to be updated for every new lot of the IVD assay kit. The user
manually defines the following types of wells:
· Sample, a sample well containing a clinical specimen or test sample;
· Negative control;
· Positive control;
· Buffer, a well without any sample containing only 1X Injection buffer;
· Buffer/Lock, a well without any sample containing only 1X Injection buffer that
has been locked by the system due to a well-specific quality evaluation of the
installed cartridge.
In the software UI, the user selects a plate map location, for example A1, and enters the
sample ID or Accession number or designates plate map locations as Negative, Positive
control or Buffer. Each sample or control well must have a unique accession
number/identification number.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Appropriate Specimen type for testing
This assay is intended for use with liquid or soft raw stool specimens. Do not use on well-
formed stools or on other types of specimens.
Collecting the specimen
Standard stool collection and handling procedures are appropriate to obtain raw stool.
Obtained sample must be placed in a sterile container that can be adequately sealed.
Storing Specimens
Samples should be tested as soon as possible. It is possible to store specimens refrigerated
(2-8˚C) for up to 48 hours prior to testing. If sample cannot be processed within 48 hours,
store frozen at -70˚C or below.
20

--- Page 21 ---
5. Calibration:
Each individual PCR reaction run for the ICEPlex C. difficile Assay is internally
controlled by utilizing the included controls. In-reaction Controls (provided as a separate
kit component or included as a part of reagent) consist of the following:
· Calibration Control – a group of ICEPlex specific elements used to align
electropherograms and assign identities of the target peaks. It also controls for the
integrity of the kit reagents and the presence of PCR inhibitors in a given sample.
· Internal Control – Non-target nucleic acid that is co-extracted and co-amplified
with the tcdB target. It controls for nucleic acid extraction efficiency, for the
integrity of the reagents and for the presence of PCR inhibitors in a given sample.
The Internal Control needs to be spiked into each sample before extraction.
6. Quality Control:
The ICEPlex system reports the reason for a sample or control result to be called
“Invalid”. If a control sample is invalid due to a reason unrelated to its function as a
control, it is excluded from consideration. To monitor run validity, the user is required to
include the following external controls (additional control PCR reactions) with the run
(duplicates are recommended):
· Negative Control, substitute S.T.A.R. buffer for the clinical specimen and process
normally through the extraction system and on the ICEPlex Instrument.
· Positive Control, this control is used for the PCR stage only, it should not be
processed for nucleic acids extraction. In the positive control reaction, substitute
extracted sample with provided Positive Control.
· Known Positive Sample, is required to include previously characterized positive
sample or simulated sample with every easyMAG extraction run and include it in
the subsequent ICEPlex Instrument run to verify successful lysis.
