c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
i. Traceability:
IMMULITE 2000 AFP CVM: The IMMULITE AFP CVM is traceable to WHO
1st IS 72/225.
IMMULITE 2000 BR-MA CVM: The IMMULITE BR-MA CVMs are traceable
to internally assigned reference calibrators prepared using BR-MA antigen stock
solution (human-source CA 15-3). The reference calibrators are gravimetrically
prepared from the source material.
IMMULITE 2000 OM-MA CVM: The IMMULITE OM-MA CVMs are traceable
to internally assigned reference calibrators prepared using OM-MA antigen stock
solution. The reference calibrators are gravimetrically prepared from the source
material.
ii. Value Assignment:
The IMMULITE 2000 AFP CVMs, BR-MA CVMs and OM-MA CVMs are
manufactured and value assigned using qualified materials and measurement
procedures. Each laboratory should establish their limits for acceptability based
on methodology, clinical significance and medical decision levels of the test
analyte. Value assignment is lot specific.
IMMULITE 2000 AFP CVM: Each CVM level was tested for 9 runs and 3
replicates per run for a total of 27 replicates. Three different reagent kit lots and 5
different instruments were used to gain 27 replicates. The CVMs dose values
were generated using a curve generated by assigned reference calibrators. The
analyte values were calculated based on the recovered values for each run on each
instrument independently. CVM values were then averaged across all systems.
The Guideline Range (95% confidence interval) for each CVM level was
established based on the Target Mean and ± 2 Standard Deviation (SD). The
expected values are provided in the IMMULITE 2000 CVM Calibration
Verification Material lot-specific value card. The values in the table below can be
considered as guidelines.

the reportable range of the assay.
The expected assay range is 0.2 – 300 IU/mL.
IMMULITE 2000 BR-MA CVM: Each CVM level was tested for 9 runs and 3
replicates per run, a total of 27 replicates. Three different reagent kit lots and 6
different instruments were used to gain 27 replicates. The CVM values were
calculated based on the recovered values for each run on each instrument
independently. CVM values are then averaged across all systems. The Guideline

iii. Stability:
The stability study was conducted to validate shelf life claim for the IMMULITE
2000 AFP CVM, IMMULITE 2000 BR-MA CVM and IMMULITE 2000 OM-
MA CVM, to ensure that the CMVs maintains optimal product performance on
IMMULITE 2000 platforms throughout the established shelf life of the CVM.
The IMMULITE 2000 AFP CVMs are stable up to 3.5 years when stored frozen
at -20°C prior to opening. The IMMULITE 2000 BR-MA CVMs) are stable up to
4.5 years when stored frozen at -20°C prior to opening. The IMMULITE 2000
OM-MA CVMs are stable up to 9 years when stored refrigerated at 2-8°C prior to
opening.
iv. Matrix effect:
The Matrix Effects Studies were performed to describe any significant difference
between the IMMULITE 2000 AFP CVM, IMMULITE 2000 BR-MA CVM and
IMMULITE 2000 OM-MA CVM and typical patient samples in terms of
conditions known to cause analytical error.
IMMULITE 2000 AFP CVM: A stock solution of AFP antigen was used to
prepare the spiking solutions for studying matrix effects. Three spiking
solutions were prepared from stock solution. Each spiking solution was
spiked into matrix (Bovine Serum) and patient sample (1 part spiking solution
to 19 parts matrix or sample) to generate three sets of spiked samples
(concentrations at 9.91 IU/mL, 29.76 IU/mL and 67.81 IU/mL).
IMMULITE 2000 BR-MA CVM: A stock solution of BR-MA antigen
(CA15.3) was used to prepare the spiking solutions for studying matrix
effects. Three spiking solutions were prepared from stock solution. Each
spiking solution was spiked into matrix (Bovine Serum) and patient sample (1
part spiking solution to 19 parts matrix or sample) to generate three sets of

spiked samples (concentrations at 282 U/mL, 617 U/mL and 1,168 U/mL).
IMMULITE 2000 OM-MA CVM: A stock solution of OM-MA antigen
(CA125) was used to prepare the spiking solutions for studying matrix effects.
Three spiking solutions were prepared from stock solution. Each spiking
solution was spiked into Bovine protein/buffer matrix and patient sample (1
part spiking solution to 19 parts matrix or sample) to generate three sets of
spiked samples (concentrations at 627 U/mL, 1,207 U/mL and 2,408 U/mL).
The spiked AFP, BR-MA and OM-MA samples were run in their respective
assays on IMMULITE 2000 platform. The % recovery of antigen in the spiked
matrix was compared to the % recovery in the spiked patient sample. Each of the
tested samples met the acceptance criteria: the grand mean of the recoveries must
be within 100% ± 10% of the expected value with no mean recovery being more
than 100% ± 15%.
