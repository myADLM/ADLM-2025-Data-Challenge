the region sequenced, and additionally reports on two deep intronic mutations and two
large deletions. The test is intended to be used on the Illumina MiSeqDx Instrument. The
test is intended to be used as an aid in the diagnosis of individuals with suspected cystic
fibrosis (CF). The test is most appropriate when the patient has an atypical or non-classic
presentation of CF or when other mutation panels have failed to identify both causative
mutations. The results of the test are intended to be interpreted by a board-certified
clinical molecular geneticist or equivalent and should be used in conjunction with other
available information including clinical symptoms, other diagnostic tests, and family
history. This test is not indicated for use for stand-alone diagnostic purposes, fetal

L. Test Principle:
The Illumina MiSeqDx Cystic Fibrosis Clinical Sequencing Assay encompasses two main
procedures. The first is to manually prepare the samples for sequencing, which is called
library preparation. Library preparation consists of four key steps: Hybridization, Extension-
Ligation, PCR Amplification, and Library Normalization. The first step, Hybridization,
hybridizes a pool of upstream and downstream oligonucleotides specific to the MiSeqDx
Cystic Fibrosis Clinical Sequencing Assay to the sample genomic DNA. At the end of this
process a three-step wash procedure with a filter capable of size selection removes unbound
oligonucleotides from the genomic DNA. The second step, Extension-Ligation, connects the
hybridized upstream and downstream oligonucleotides. A DNA polymerase extends from the
upstream oligonucleotides through the targeted region, followed by ligation to the 5’ end of
the downstream oligonucleotide using a DNA ligase. The result is the formation of products
that contain the CF specific oligonucleotides flanked by sequences required for amplification.
The third step, PCR Amplification, amplifies the extension-ligated products using primers
that add index sequences for sample multiplexing, as well as common adapters required for
cluster generation on the MiSeqDx. At the end of this process, a PCR clean-up procedure
purifies the PCR products (referred to as a library). The final step, Library Normalization,
normalizes the quantity of each library to ensure more equal library representation in the final
pooled library. At the end of this process, the pooled library is loaded onto the MiSeqDx for
sequencing by Sequencing by Synthesis (SBS) chemistry.
The second procedure is to sequence the prepared samples using SBS chemistry on the
MiSeqDx. SBS chemistry uses a reversible-terminator method to detect single nucleotide
bases as they are incorporated into growing DNA strands. During each sequencing cycle, a
single fluorescently labeled deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) is added to the nucleic acid
chain. The nucleotide label serves as a terminator for polymerization, so after each dNTP
incorporation, the fluorescent dye is imaged to identify the base and then enzymatically
cleaved to allow incorporation of the next nucleotide. Because all four reversible terminator-
bound dNTPs (A, G, T, C) are present as single, separate molecules, natural competition
minimizes incorporation bias. Base calls are made directly from signal intensity
measurements during each sequencing cycle. The end result is base-by-base sequencing.

The MiSeq Reporter software processes base calls generated during primary analysis and
produces information about each sample based on information specified in the samples sheet,
called secondary analysis. As described below, secondary analysis includes de-multiplexing,
FASTQ file generation, alignment, variant calling, and generation of VCF files containing
information about CFTR variants found at specific positions. De-multiplexing separates data
from pooled samples based upon the unique sequence indexes that were added during the
PCR amplification step. The FASTQ format is a text format used to represent sequences.
FASTQ files contain the reads for each sample and the quality scores, excluding reads from
any clusters that did not pass filter. Alignment compares sequences against the reference to
identify a relationship between the sequences and assigns a score based on regions of
similarity. Aligned reads are written to files in BAM format. MiSeq Reporter software uses a
banded Smith-Waterman algorithm that performs local sequence alignments to determine
similar regions between two sequences. Variant calling then records insertion and deletions
(indels), and other structural variants in a standardized and parsable test file.

Reproducibility:
The reproducibility of the MiSeqDx assay was evaluated at 3 external sites, by two
operators at each site on 3 nonconsecutive days. The study included 2 sample panels
consisting of mock blood and genomic DNA (gDNA) samples. The mock blood
samples were created from leukocyte-depleted whole blood spiked with cell lines
known to harbor a CFTR mutation. The gDNA samples were derived from cell lines
with known CFTR variants. Panel A was comprised of 8 mock blood samples and 38
gDNA samples. Panel B was comprised of 38 gDNA samples. A new sample library
was prepared for each run. A total of 18 runs per panel were performed. There were
16 duplicate samples between the 2 panels, giving a total of 76 unique samples of the
total 92. Positive and negative control samples were included in each run.
A positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), and overall
agreement (OA) were assessed. Sanger sequencing was used to identify the variants
with the exception of the 2 large deletions that were verified using a validated PCR
assay followed by sequencing of the resulting amplicons.
There were 7 runs identified as invalid due to failed QC metrics and were re-run.
Additionally, 5 samples failed QC metrics. These samples were not run again and
results from these samples were considered non-matches at every position. Two of
the samples had a 0% call rate, which upon further investigation, it was determined
that the samples were not added when making up the library preparation. For the
remaining samples, there were 63 discordant results between the assay and Sanger

sequencing along the 5206 callable positions. Of these 39 were due to a no call by the
assay. Of the remaining 24 discordant calls, 18 occurred in sample 80 and were for
the PolyTG/PolyT region. The remaining 6 discordant results were miscalls occurring
in a single run (i.e., disagreed with calls reported by the other 17 runs).
Overall, the study achieved a genotype-level PPA of 99.2%, NPA of 99.7%, and OA
of 99.7% which met all of the acceptance criteria for the study.
Table 2 below represents the summary reproducibility results for observed variants,
excluding the PolyTG/PolyT region, while the Table 3 summarizes the PolyTG/PolyT
results. PPA, NPA, and OA were determined for all 5206 callable positions. However
the variants observed are shown below for simplicity and because the majority of
discordant results were in the context of variant detection, most notably in the
PolyTG/PolyT region.

¤Samples were not retested.
¶ One replicate each of samples 5 and 75 had a 0% call rate. Further investigation indicated that the samples had likely not been
added to the sample plate prior to library preparation.
# Upon review, samples 9 and 10 were likely switched by the operator prior to library preparation.
* Excluding PolyTG/PolyT variants, the PA was 99.60%
a Covers all 5206 callable positions interrogated by the assay
The panels used for the reproducibility studies included a number of PolyTG/PolyT
tract variations that allowed for examination of assay performance over the majority
of permutations in tract size. With the exception of (TG)11(T)7/(TG)11(T)9 samples,

†† All 18 samples were concordant with each other but discordant with Sanger bi-directional sequencing.
Lot-to-Lot Reproducibility:
A single operator performed a lot-to-lot reproducibility study using the three kit
lots and one instrument. Each kit lot included all the reagents and materials
intended to be packaged as part of the Illumina MiSeqDx Cystic Fibrosis Clinical
Sequencing Assay. A panel of 47 unique gDNA samples tested in duplicate was
tested on each lot. The samples were selected to represent a wide array of
potential variants. Samples were extracted from immortalized cell lines and
included the ACMG 23 mutations, 21 deletion/insertion variants, 5 homozygous
samples, 28 compound heterozygotes, 1 sample containing 1 of the large
deletions, samples which represent the commonly observed sequence possibilities
at the PolyTG/Poly T region, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 15

different exons and 9 different intronic regions. There were no miscalls. There
were 5 no calls for lot 1, 1 no call for lot 2 and 0 no calls for lot 3. Results
showed that all reagent lots met their acceptance criteria and performed
equivalently.
Instrument-to-Instrument Reproducibility:
To establish instrument comparability, assay performance (call rate,
reproducibility, sample first pass rate, and accuracy) was assessed on 3 different
MiSeqDx instruments. Three operators each performed a single run on 3 different
days on each of 3 different MiSeqDx instruments using a single lot of reagents.
Instrument performance metrics were defined by sequencing output (in
gigabases), reads (in millions), read length (2x150), and quality base calling score
(%Q) > 30.
The 48 sample panel used in the lot-to-lot reproducibility study (47 samples plus a
no-template control [NTC]) which represented different types of sequence
variations was used in this study. If a NTC generated a call rate of <2%, then
contamination would be suspected and the entire sequencing run would be
considered failed and must be repeated starting from library preparation.
The Clinical Sequencing Assay sequences 5203 bases within the exonic regions
and flanking intronic sequence and additionally reports on 2 large deletions and
the PolyTG/PolyT sequence within intron 9, making the total number of positions
sequences 5,206. With the exception of a single sample which had a no-call at a
PolyTG/PolyT site, all 423 tests (47 samples x 9runs [3 operators x 3
instruments]) had a 100% call rate and reproducibility was 100% concordant.
Accuracy examination by bi-directional sequencing also showed all samples had
the expected sequence/genotype.
Thermal Cycler Evaluation:
Three different commonly used, commercially available thermal cyclers were
compared for use in library preparation for the MiSeqDx Cystic Fibrosis Clinical
Sequencing Assay. Three unique sample sets were processed through the 3
thermal cyclers across 3 days. Each sample set was processed in triplicate each
day (one replicate per thermal cycler). The sample set consisted of 15 extracted
gDNAs from cell lines and 1 NTC. The sample panel included variants for every
allele of the ACMG 23, 21 deletion/insertion variants, 5 homozygous samples, 27
compound heterozygotes, 1 sample containing one of the targeted large deletions,
samples with commonly observed variants in the Poly TG/PolyT region and SNPs
in 15 different exons and 9 different intronic regions. The data for each thermal
cycler met specifications for call rate, accuracy and sample first pass rate.

DNA Extraction Study:
To evaluate the effect of the extraction step on sample reproducibility, an
additional, separate extraction study was conducted. Three different commonly
used DNA extraction methods from K EDTA anticoagulated whole blood were
2
tested on 14 blood samples (2 samples were wild-type, while the other 12
represented 8 unique genotypes). The genomic DNA was isolated using three
commonly used commercially available kits representing different methodologies
(i.e., magnetic bead separation, alcohol precipitation, and silica filter column).
The 3 DNA extraction methods were tested by 2 different operators who
performed 3 runs per extraction method giving 9 replicate extractions per sample
performed on separate days. All extracted gDNA samples were run in duplicate.
All 3 extraction methods met acceptance criteria for call rate, reproducibility, and
pass rate with an accuracy of 100%.
Repeatability:
To examine assay repeatability, 47 replicates of a single sample (with a NTC)
were tested. The same experiment was repeated for a second sample by the same
operator on the same instrument. The percent coefficient of variation (% CV) for
coverage was determined for each of the 80 amplicons examined in this assay
across 47 replicates. Results ranged from 7-18% CV with an average of 12% for
sample 1 and 12% for sample 2.
b. Linearity/Assay Reportable range:
Not applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Real-Time Stability:
In order to determine the expiration dating of the MiSeqDx Cystic Fibrosis Clinical
Sequencing Assay reagents and consumables, the kit was evaluated at six time points
after manufacturing: 5 months, 6.25 months, 7.25 months, 9 months, 9.25 months,
and 12 months with three separately manufactured lots of reagents and consumables.
Each lot of reagents was run in duplicate for the first 3 time points and singlicate at
the 9 month time point. A panel of 45 specimens was used to assess performance.
The results from each lot at each time point was assessed for call rate (acceptance
criteria ≥99%), and accuracy (acceptance criteria ≥99.9%). No miscalls were
observed for any of the time points. The largest number of no calls (N = 5) was
observed with one lot at 7.25 months; however the call rate exceeded the acceptance
criteria. All No Calls observed at any time point were for the PolyTG/PolyT variant.
Based on the data provided, the initial shelf-life for the assay is 9.25 months.
23

Open Tube Stability (Freeze/Thaw):
Three independently manufactured lots of frozen library preparation/normalization
reagents were used for testing. The assay reagents are single use and not stored
frozen, and so were not tested in this protocol. All reagents were subjected to 6
freeze/thaw cycles. At each cycle (1 per day for 6 days), reagents were thawed at
room temperature, the reagent volume required for testing was withdrawn, and the
tubes were returned to -15 to -25°C for overnight storage. Thirteen gDNA samples
were tested, including 1 NTC for a total of 14 samples. The 14 samples were pooled
into a single library at each freeze/thaw time point and sequencing was run in the
assay mode. Each freeze/thaw cycle was assessed for first pass rate (acceptance
criteria ≥95% samples need to meet sample call rate specification of ≥99%), call rate
(acceptance criteria ≥99%), and accuracy (acceptance criteria ≥99.9%). The data
provided supports a maximum of 6 rounds of freeze/thaw.
Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The specimen handling study included the following conditions:
· DNA extracted from K EDTA anti-coagulated blood stored at room
2
temperature (20-25°C) for 7 days (claimed in package insert)
· DNA extracted from K EDTA anti-coagulated blood stored at 2°C to 4°C for
2
30 days (claimed in package insert)
· DNA extracted from K EDTA anti-coagulated blood stored at -15°C to -25°C
2
for 30 days (claimed in package insert)
· Genomic DNA subjected to 6 freeze/thaw cycles
Additionally, 6 blood samples were divided into 6 aliquots and stored under the
following conditions:
· 2°C to 8°C for 1 day
· -15°C to -25°C for 1 day
· 2°C to 8°C for 30 days
· -15°C to -25°C for 30 days
· Room temperature for 7 days
· 30°C for 7 days
Extracted blood was then stored at -15°C to -25°C until the study commenced.
Fifteen samples aliquoted into 6 tubes were used to assess sample storage claims and
2 aliquots of each sample were used to assess freeze/thaw claims (one sample stored
and the other undergoing freeze/thaw once a day for 6 days). Samples included SNVs
and DIVs as well as homozygotes, heterozygotes, and compound heterozygotes.
Acceptance criteria were based on call rate, sample first-pass rate and reproducibility,
and all studies met their acceptance criteria.

Reagent Integrity and Shipping:
Shipping studies were designed to evaluate product performance after exposure to
simulated shipping conditions. Study elements included atmospheric thermal cycling
with both summer and winter profiles depending on the reagent being tested.
Reagents believed to be sensitive to heat were subjected to summer profiles
(enzymes, oligos, etc), while reagents believed to be sensitive to freeze/thaw were
subjected to winter profiles. Distribution testing was also performed to include the
following:
· Atmospheric pre-conditioning
· Shock-drop (8 and 9 drops)
· Vibration – Random dynamic load
· Random Vibration – Pick-up and Delivery Vehicle Spectrum
· Vibration – Random under low pressure vacuum
Shipping validation testing was conducted with 8 samples that included
deletion/insertion variants (including in a homopolymeric region), SNVs, and 1 large
deletion. After shipping testing was complete, all kit components were stored at
recommended conditions until functional testing could be performed. Acceptance
criteria included the assay requirements (call rate and accuracy ≥ 99%), payload and
shipping testing had internal temperature acceptance criteria, and container integrity
testing only required no major visual defects (minor defects including punctures,
tears, and cracks in the container were acceptable). All testing passed by meeting all
acceptance criteria.
d. Detection Limit (Analytical sensitivity):
Analytical Sensitivity at High DNA Input:
The recommended DNA input for this assay is 250 ng. An initial study was
conducted to estimate the performance of the assay when the gDNA input is greater
or less than the recommended DNA input concentration. Four different DNA samples
were tested at input levels of 1250, 250, 100, and 25 ng. The 4 DNA samples
covered 7 mutations and included heterozygous single nucleotide variants (SNVs),
heterozygous and homozygous deletion/insertion variants (DIVs), one large deletion,
and a deletion cum insertion. Either 20 (1250 ng) or 24 (all other concentrations)
replicates were tested for each sample. Samples were processed by 2 operators over 4
days using a single lot of reagents and a single thermal cycler. The same lot of gDNA
samples was used throughout the study. Genotype calls were compared to
bidirectional Sanger sequencing except for the 2 large deletions which were
confirmed using validated duplex PCR followed by sequencing of resulting
amplicons. Both assays met the pre-determined acceptance criteria for all
concentrations tested.
One sample at 25 ng had a call rate of 98% which was deemed unacceptable. There
was a single no-call at 1250 ng (both no-calls at 1250 ng were at the PolyTG/PolyT
25

--- Page 26 ---
region). At 25 ng there were 140 no-calls with 136 arising from 6 replicates of the
same sample.
Analytical Sensitivity at Low DNA Input:
Fourteen DNA specimens were tested at 9 different DNA input levels; 1250, 500,
250, 100, 50 25, 10, 5, and 1 ng. Variation types tested included SNVs, small
insertion/deletions (including F508del), one large deletion, and compound
insertion/deletions. A single lot of reagents were used and the same lot of DNA
samples and a single thermal cycler were used. This study passed acceptance criteria
at all concentrations except 1, 5, and 10 ng (25-fold below recommended DNA
input). Based on the results of both studies, the upper and lower bounds for DNA
input into the assay are 1250 and 25 ng, respectively.
e. Analytical Specificity (Interfering Substances):
Bilirubin, Hemoglobin, Cholesterol, and Buffer Component Interference:
The effect of potential interferents on the performance of the assay was examined
using 8 samples carrying 8 unique genotypes, and blood from the same individual
was tested across all 4 interfering substances. Sample types included 1 PolyTG/PolyT
variant, 1 indel (F508del), and 6 SNVs. Bilirubin (684 and 137 µmol/L), hemoglobin
(2 and 0.4 g/L), and cholesterol (13 and 2.6 mmol/L) were spiked into blood aliquots
prior to DNA extraction. Wash buffer from DNA extraction (15%) was spiked into
genomic DNA samples prior to library preparation. For the assessment of each
inhibiting substance, data for each spiked sample was compared to an untreated
aliquot of the same blood/DNA sample. Impact on call rate, reproducibility, and
sample first pass rate were determined. All 88 samples met the acceptance criteria of
the test.
Lipid and Short Draw Interference:
A study to assess the potential interference of triglycerides (37 mmol/L and 7.4
mmol/L) and high and low concentrations of K EDTA (7 mg/mL and 2.8 mg/mL) to
2
mimic short blood draws was conducted. Eight whole blood samples were used for
this study. Two samples were WT, 2 were F508del, and the remaining 4 were SNVs.
With the exception of R75Q, all SNVs were replicates of those tested in Interference
Study A (above), but were different blood samples. All tested conditions gave 100%
correct calls, and no samples required a re-concentration to obtain the appropriate
amount of DNA for the assay.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
26

--- Page 27 ---
g. Sample carryover:
The goal of this study was to ascertain that sample carryover between samples within
an instrument run and between successive sequencing runs met design requirements.
Two genomic DNA samples with unique CFTR genotypes were assessed. One
sample had 2 variants and one sample had 3 variants. In the intra-run test, 1 library
composed of 2 samples with unique variants was set up in a checkerboard matrix
pattern at alternating high (500 ng) and low (100 ng) concentrations along with 4
NTCs. For the inter-run test, 2 libraries were prepared; the library contained either a
single distinct genomic DNA sample or one NTC. For both the inter and intra-run
tests, sample carryover was assessed by measuring the error rate at the position of
variant calls for all samples used in the study. The design input requirement was
carryover ≤ 2%.The highest carryover rate seen in this test was 0.31% for intra-run
testing and 0.3% for inter-run testing.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison to reference method:
Accuracy:
Accuracy of the Illumina MiSeqDx Clinical Sequencing Assay was assessed by
evaluating 500 samples representing a wide variety of CFTR variants from four
separate sources; 369 were clinical gDNA specimens, 79 were cell line gDNA, and
52 were synthetic samples derived from plasmid DNA. Accuracy was based on
comparison with Sanger sequencing of all 500 samples over all 5,206 positions
interrogated by the MiSeqDx assay. A total of 203 variants from reference were
detected. These variants covered most of the 27 exons (with the exception of exons
16 and 26) and an intronic region within CFTR including the PolyTG/PolyT
homopolymeric region. Variant types analyzed in the accuracy study included SNVs,
small indels, and 2 large deletions. All 23 mutations recommended by the ACMG
were included in the study, and all were examined with clinical samples in addition to
other sample types. As noted below there were 6 miscalls and 4 no calls in the study.
One of the no calls was in the context of wild-type sequence, while the rest were in
the context of variants, most notably in the PolyTG/PolyT region. Overall this study
met its acceptance criteria.

* The Sanger report listed the P205S variant as heterozygous for the clinical sample. A review of
the Sanger trace data however indicated that the variant was in fact homozygous and incorrectly
reported. MiSeqDx reported the variant as homozygous.
#One of the discordant results was from the reproducibility study. The PolyTG/PolyT result for
the sample was concordant
across all 18 replicates, but discordant with Sanger bi-directional sequencing.
^ The original synthetic heterozygous specimen was determined to be improperly prepared. When
it was subsequently tested after it was re-prepared, using the same plasmid, it would be detected.
** A synthetic sample heterozygous for exon 8 was reported as heterozygous for the variant CFTR
dele22, 23. Further investigation revealed that this result was likely from low level contamination.
Additionally, for a second sample, Sanger primers could not fully detect the variant Q1463Q due
to indels both upstream and downstream of the variant site.

PolyTG/PolyT Accuracy:
Twenty-three different PolyTG/PolyT genotypes were examined across 448 samples.
The resulting variant calls for each sample were compared to bi-directional
sequencing. Four samples were discordant with bi-directional sequencing results.
Each of the discordances was noted to be within ±1 PolyTG relative to the bi-
directional sequencing results. The accuracy of the PolyTG/PolyT results were
assessed for all the samples included in the study and a demonstrated a miscall rate of
0.89% (4/448).

O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The MiSeqDx instrument requires limited user interaction to operate and commence a
sequencing run. The software uses a graphical interface to walk the user step-by-step
through loading of the reagents for a run (i.e., flow cell, reagent cartridge, and PR2
buffer) and empty the waste bottle. The system then automatically initializes the fluidics
and optics, performs cluster generation, and commences the sequencing by synthesis
cycles while acquiring data.
The MiSeqDx system consists of four software applications that are installed on the
instrument [MiSeq Operating Software (MOS); and Real Time Analysis (RTA), MiSeq
Reporter (MRS), and MiSeq Test Software (MTS)] and two software applications
[Illumina Worklist Manager (IWM) and User Management Software (UMS)] that are
installed on user supplied personal computers. The MTS is only utilized by field service
personnel and the MRS may also be installed on user supplied personal computers for off
instrument analysis. The IWM software is used to create a sample sheet during library
preparation and the UMS is used to grant various access level permissions to users. The
MiSeq Operating Software (MOS) supports the ability to setup and run the sequencing
workflow and save the resulting files for image processing and base calling (primary data
analysis) performed by RTA software and MRS which performs de-multiplexing,
alignment, variant calling, and report generation (secondary data analyses).
The MiSeqDx software utilizes assay specific radio-frequency identifier (RFID) tagged
reagents and consumables which enables it to automatically select and configure the
appropriate run type to match the kit being used and control the in vitro diagnostic
workflow. The RFID tag allows the system to ensure that the correct consumable type is
being used and this information is stored as part of the instrument run-log for traceability
purposes.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___x_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
The MiSeqDx Cystic Fibrosis Clinical Sequencing Assay kit contains materials sufficient
for up to 48 samples per kit. Eight samples, including controls, must be analyzed for each
run, and the kit contains sufficient reagents for 6 runs. If 6 patient samples and 2 controls
are not available for a run, the remaining samples can be made up with normal genomic
DNA. Three unique index i7 reverse PCR primers (named A701, A702, and A710) and
three unique index i5 forward PCR primers (named A503-A505) for universal
35

--- Page 36 ---
amplification of the ligated products are included. These are added during the library
preparation process. The sample sheet, a file that the end user provides the software,
contains the link between each of the sample names and their associated index sequences.
After completion of the sequencing run, MiSeqDx CF Reporter software de-multiplexes
the samples using the index sequences and creates FASTQ files as the data analysis
output for sequence alignment and variant calling.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Samples are handled manually prior to being placed on the instrument. The test begins
with the isolation of gDNA from a peripheral whole blood sample. The gDNA is then
quantified and qualified prior to being processed through the library preparation step.
This step specifically amplifies the intended genomic regions of each sample while also
adding the indexes (for sample identification). The library is then processed to remove
any remaining preparation reagents (e.g., unused primers). It is then normalized, to
ensure that each library is equally represented, and pooled. The resulting sample libraries
are then transferred into a MiSeq reagent cartridge which contains all of the reagents
required for cluster generation and SBS. The MiSeqDx Reagent Cartridge, MiSeqDx
Flow Cell, and MiSeqDx SBS Solution are then inserted into the MiSeqDx instrument,
which performs cluster generation, sequencing and data analysis.
5. Calibration:
There is no end-user calibration of the system. During installation of the platform, a
company representative (Field Applications Scientist) begins a series of tests to validate
the performance of the instrument subsystems, which include optical alignment, fluidic
delivery, and thermal calibration, among others. In the case of a test failure, the MiSeqDx
company representative uses a set of instrument-specific tools to adjust and/or repair the
instrument to meet operational specifications. Re-calibration occurs during the
preventive maintenance visit.
6. Quality Control:
An internal control, bacteriophage PhiX (ΦX174) gDNA is added at the end of the library
preparation step, prior to library pooling and placement on the instrument. Successful
sequencing of the PhiX genome indicates that the sequencing chemistry worked as
expected.
Illumina requires that one positive control DNA sample and a negative control [No
Template Control (NTC)] be included in every run, which is defined as a set of samples
processed in parallel. The positive control DNA sample should be a well-characterized
sample with one or more known CFTR variants and positive controls should be rotated in
a manner consistent with the 2008 ACMG Technical Standards and Guidelines for CF
mutation testing and the 2013 ACMG clinical laboratory standards for next-generation
sequencing. The use of a wild type control, run as a sample, is recommended, but it
should not replace the positive or negative control.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Validation of PCR Method Used for Large Deletion Confirmation in Accuracy Studies:
The assay reports on 2 large deletions within the CFTR gene. Because Sanger
sequencing is not designed to detect large deletions, a PCR assay was validated as a
confirmatory method for large deletion detection.
For each deletion, a duplex PCR containing 2 primer sets was used. One primer set
flanks the deletion breakpoints while the other amplifies a region internal to the deletion.
Therefore, homozygotes will have one PCR product while heterozygotes will have 2
which are detected by size separation on an agarose gel.
In order to validate this assay, a panel of 22 samples was tested. The panel consisted of
cell line gDNA samples, blood-derived gDNA samples, and synthetic plasmids. No
clinical samples were used in the validation studies because these variants are quite rare
(~250 for dele2,3 and 9 for dele22,23 in the CFTR2 database). Plasmids were generated
such that they contain the gDNA in the context of the deletion and 300bp on either side.
The plasmids were either used as is, or were blended with cell line gDNA to give
synthetic heterozygote samples.
The following studies were performed to validate the assay:
· Accuracy: PCR products were Sanger sequenced to confirm identity
· Specificity: Based on the presence of only 2 bands of expected size
· Reproducibility: For intra-run 8 replicates each of 6 samples from the 22 sample
set were tested in a single run for both assays. For inter-run, the set of 22 samples
3 times
· Robustness: DNA quality robustness was assessed with 6 DNA samples that
underwent freeze/thaw 6 times. DNA quantity robustness was assessed with WT,
het, and homozygous samples of each deletion tested at 7 different DNA inputs
(from 10x to 0.1x).
All testing met acceptance criteria.
2. Library Normalization:
The library normalization step of the assay was validated retrospectively by testing the
following parameters.
· Intra and inter-run reproducibility
· Repeatability
· Working DNA input range in which normalization works effectively
· Robustness of library normalization method
37

--- Page 38 ---
All testing met acceptance criteria based on call rate.
3. G/C content:
In order to determine if certain regions of the CFTR gene had unusually high G/C content
such that a separate evaluation of assay performance would need to be done in this genomic
context, the G/C contend of the targeted regions in CFTR was provided. As can be seen
from the chart below, the G/C content of CFTR for the regions analyzed in this assay is
generally below 50%.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
