L. Test Principle:
The assay is a solid-phase, two-step, chemiluminiscent immunoassay that uses liquid phase
kinetics in a bead format. The allergens are covalently bound to a soluble polymer/co-
polymer matrix, which is labeled with a ligand. The assay specific antibody is labeled with
alkaline phosphatase. The use of an amino acid co-polymer amplifies the amount of allergen
that the matrix can support. The chemiluminiscent detection system is a phosphatase ester of
stabilized dioxatane. Cleavage of the phosphate ester by alkaline phosphatase results in the
decomposition of dioxatane and the emission of photons, which are quantified by a
luminometer.

Lot to lot imprecision:
The three tested lots were analyzed for lot-to-lot precision using four positive samples
(with one sample close to the cut-off) and one negative sample. Between-lot within-
run imprecision ranged from 4.43 % to 13.60% and the total imprecision ranged from
5.83 % to 15.75 %. All three lots were within the sponsor’s claimed acceptable
criterion of ≤ 20% CV.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity studies: For each allergen, two clinical samples were diluted in 2-fold serial
dilutions to 5 levels. The undiluted (neat) and diluted samples were tested with the
specific allergen to demonstrate linearity at concentrations within the assay limits.
Regression statistics for each allergen comparing the observed results to expected
results of the representative data from first sample are presented below:

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The calibrators and controls are traceable to the WHO 2nd IRP 75/502
reference standard for human IgE.
Stability:
Allergen stability: Accelerated allergen stability testing (15-25ºC for 60 days at 1, 4,
8, 15, 30, and 60 day intervals; other assay kit components stored at recommended
temperature 2-8ºC). Testing was performed on three positive samples and one
negative sample on two lots. The accelerated study supports a two year shelf-life
stability claim. Real-time stability is on-going for all 7 new allergen on three lots
with three positive (high: 3.5; moderate 0.7-3.49 and low near the cut-off 0.35-0.69
kU/L) and one negative samples.
On-board/ open-vial stability:
On-board stability testing was performed on three positive samples and one negative
sample for 91 days at 2-8°C (at 1, 7, 14, 21, 32, 46, 60, 75 and 90+ day intervals) for
each individual specific allergen on three lots. Stability studies support the 90 day
on-board stability claim.
Open-vial stability testing was performed on three positive samples and one negative

studies support the 180 day on-board stability claim.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Blank (LoB): Four blank samples (no analyte) were tested in replicates of
two, with one run per day, over five days, using two instruments and three lots of
allergen. A total of 80 data points were collected for each allergen lot. The Limit of
Blank (highest value expected for a sample with no analyte), determined in
accordance with CLSI EP17-A, is 0.06kU/L for rPru av 4 (A600 Cherry) and
0.03kU/L for the other six allergens.
Limit of Detection (LoD):
Four low positive samples were tested using 3 allergen lots over 5 days, at one run
per day, 2 replicates per run to estimate the LoD. Two instruments were used to
collect a total of 60 data points for each new allergen. The Limit of Detection (lowest
detectable concentration), determined in accordance with CLSI EP-17-A is
≤0.10kU/L for all seven allergens.
e. Analytical specificity:
(i) Inhibition studies - Related inhibitor
Specificity of each allergen was verified through competitive inhibition testing
using a single serum sample or a serum pool. A negative sample was used to
measure the background response.
To initiate the inhibition experiment, a minimum of 5 levels of 5-fold diluted
inhibitor extract were mixed with sample or pool at a ratio of 1:1 to achieve final
inhibitor concentrations of 50 μg/mL and lower. The inhibitor/sample mixtures
were incubated at room temperature (15-28ºC) for 1 hour allowing the
immunological reaction to occur. Each sample mixture containing the inhibitor
extract and the appropriate controls were assayed with 1 lot of each allergen. The
percent (%) inhibition was calculated according to the following formula:
[(C – A/C)] x 100
where:
C = mean response of the positive control (positive sample – negative sample)
A = mean response of sample with inhibitor extract
The data demonstrated that the allergens tested are inhibited by the relevant
inhibitor extract in a concentration dependent fashion and are specific for the
targeted allergen. The target % inhibition is 50% at the highest inhibitor
concentration tested. All seven allergens met the target % inhibition. These
results indicate specificity of rBet v 2, (A127 Birch pollen); rMal d 1 (A464
Apple); rPru av 1, (A597 Cherry); rPru av 3, (A599 Cherry); rPru av 4 (A600

Cherry); n Pru p 3, (A603 Peach); rMal d 4, (A796 Apple) allergens.
(ii) Inhibition studies - Unrelated inhibitor
Additional inhibition studies were conducted to show that the specific allergens
do not cross-react with unrelated allergens. Three irrelevant allergens, as well as
any related components, were included as additional controls. The related
components were other components of the parent allergen (if available) or
another component from the same group. The final inhibitor concentrations of
the additional inhibitors ranged from 500 μg/mL to 1250 µg/mL, determined as
10x the concentration needed to achieve ~100% inhibition on its own allergen
device. The same incubation procedure and calculation method were used as
described above with relevant inhibitor procedure. The sponsor’s acceptance
criterion is that the irrelevant allergen controls should demonstrate less than 15%
inhibition was met for all seven allergens.

individuals.
Atopic patients were selected from patients who had clinical documentation of allergy
to specific allergen(s) or allergen group of interest and/or positive skin prick/ scratch
test to specific allergen(s) of interest evaluated as 2+ or greater. Information on the
skin test allergen extracts (crude or purified) was not documented. Non-atopic
patients were clinically known non-allergenic or total IgE <130 ng/mL or 54 IU/mL
(2.4 ng = 1 IU).
Comparison to clinical diagnosis was performed on 187 samples for rBet v 2, (A127
Birch pollen); 171 Samples for rMal d 1 (A464 Apple); 154 Samples for rPru av 1,
