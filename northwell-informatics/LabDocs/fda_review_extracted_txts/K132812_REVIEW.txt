The test configuration comes with a single drug screening test or any combinations of
multiple drug screening tests. The test is intended for over-the-counter (OTC) users as
the first step in a two step process to provide consumers with information concerning the
presence or absence of the above stated drugs in a urine sample. The second step is to
send preliminary positive samples for confirmation testing by GCMS. The test is not
intended to distinguish between prescription use or abuse of the following drugs:
Barbiturates, Benzodiazepines, Buprenorphine, Oxycodone, Propoxyphene, Tricyclic
Antidepressants.
There are no uniformly recognized cutoff concentration levels for Barbiturate,
Benzodiazepines, Buprenorphine, Oxycodone, Propoxyphene, Tricyclic Antidepressant
in urine.
Clinical considerations and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of
abuse test results, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
The OTC test can contain various combinations of drugs including either the morphine
300 cutoff or the opiates 2000 cutoff.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable; the device is a visually-read single use device.
I. Device Description:
The UCP Multi-Drug Test Key Cups are capable of measuring the 14 drugs listed in the
intended use at one time. The UCP Multi-Drug Test Key Cups can measure up to three
drugs per strip. The test is activated by a key. The test includes user instructions,
collection cups, transportation bag with absorbent pad, mailing box and identification labels
with personal identification number to be used when sending preliminary positive urine
specimens to the laboratory for confirmation.

L. Test Principle:
The UCP Multi-Drug Test Key Cups employ lateral flow immunochromatographic
technology based on the principle of competitive binding. If the sample does not contain
the drugs (or if they are present in concentrations below the cutoff level) binding sites of
antibody coated particles in the device will not be saturated. The antibody-coated particles
will then be captured by immobilized colloidal gold-labeled drug-specific conjugate and a
colored line will appear in the test line region. The colored line will not form if the sample
contains drug in excess of the cutoff level because the drug will saturate all the binding sites
of the drug specific antibody. Each strip in the device is composed of nitrocellulose and
contains the test line with mouse monoclonal antibodies specific to each drug. The test
strips also contain a procedural control line region containing a goat polyclonal antibody
against gold-protein conjugate to indicate that the sample has migrated properly on the test
strip.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed using drug-free urine spiked to the following
concentrations: negative (0%), 50% below the cutoff, 25% below the cutoff, 25%
above the cutoff, and 50% above the cutoff for each analyte. Sample concentrations
were confirmed by GC/MS. The samples were aliquoted, coded, randomized and
masked. Each specimen, at each concentration analyte, was tested on a total of sixty (60)
test devices from three different lots by three operators within 10 to 20 non-consecutive
days. The results are displayed in the tables below. Also see section 2.b., below, for
additional results obtained by the intended user that include results for high positive and
low negative concentrations.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable; the device is intended for qualitative use.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
External control standards are not supplied with this device. For prescription use, the
sponsor provides instruction for testing QC materials.
Stability:
The sponsor’s stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found
acceptable. The information supports that UCP Multi-Drug Test Key Cups unopened
stability is 18 months. Real time stability testing is ongoing. (Instructions note that
opened tests should be used immediately.)
d. Detection limit:
Analytical performance of the device around the cutoff is described in Section a.
(Precision/Reproducibility) above.

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross-reactivity was evaluated by spiking similarly structured compounds into drug free
urine. These solutions were tested using 3 lots of the UCP Home Drug Screening Test
Cups. Results are expressed as a minimum concentration of compound required to
produce a response approximately equivalent to the cutoff concentration of the assay.
The percent cross-reactivity of those compounds is presented below.

Interference testing for structurally unrelated compounds:
The following structurally unrelated compounds were found not to interfere with UCP
Home Drug Screening Test Cups when tested spiked (100 mg/mL) into drug free urine
or urine spiked with each drug at ±50%, ± 25% of the cut-off values:
Acetaminophen, Acetylsalicylic Acid, Amikacin, Ampicillin, Arterenal, Aspirin,
Atropine, Benzoic Acid, Oxalic Acid, Caffeine, Methanol, Ethanol, Lidocaine,
Thioridazine, Trifluoperazine, Penicillin-G, Phenylpropanalamine, Ranitidine,
Salicylic Acid, Albumin, Bilirubin, Creatine, Hemoglobin, Glucose, Vitamin C (L-
Ascorbic Acid), Uric Acid.
Evaluation of Specific Gravity and pH on the test results:
To evaluate the effect of pH value on the test results, negative urine samples were
adjusted to pH levels 4.5, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, and 9.0. The samples were then spiked
with each drug at ±50%, ± 25% of the cut-off values. Testing was performed on 3 lots
of UCP Home Drug Screening Test Cups.
To evaluate the effect of specific gravity, the urine samples having specific gravities of
1.005, 1.01, 1.02, 1.025, and 1.030, 1.032, and 1.035 were spiked with each drug at
±50%, ± 25% of the cut-off values. Testing was performed on 3 lots of UCP Home

Drug Screening Test Cups. The testing results demonstrated that the varying pH and
specific gravities listed above do not affect urine testing results around each analyte cut-
off.
f. Assay cut-off:
Analytical performance of the device around the cutoff is described in Section a.
(Precision/Reproducibility) above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison for UCP Home Drug Screening Test Cups was performed
with total 80 (40 negative and 40 positive) unaltered clinical samples by three
operators. The samples were masked and device results were compared to GC/MS
results. For classes of drugs (e.g. barbiturates, benzodiazepines, tricyclic
antidepressants) testing included a minimum of 3 drugs for each class. The results
are presented in the table below:

A Flesh-Kincaid reading analysis was performed on package inserts and the score
revealed a reading grade level of 7.
Each participant was given a pre and post-study questionnaire. The pre-study
questionnaire collected personal information about each participant. The post-study
questionnaire was used to determine if the lay users understood the test instruction and
the meaning of the results. Consumers were asked questions about the test, control line,
prescription drug and food interference and confirmation of results. The results from the
post-questionnaire were acceptable as nearly all of the participants answered the
questions correctly (99.1%).
b. Matrix comparison:
Not applicable. The assay is intended for urine samples.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable.
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable.
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off
Not applicable.
