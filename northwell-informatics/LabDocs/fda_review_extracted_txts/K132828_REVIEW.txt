L. Test Principle:
The Roche Calcitonin Immunoassay is an Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay
(ECLIA) which is based on the sandwich principle. During the first incubation, 50 μL of
sample, a biotinylated monoclonal hCT‑specific antibody and a monoclonal hCT‑specific
antibody labeled with a ruthenium complex react to form a sandwich complex.
During the second incubation, streptavidin-coated microparticles are added and form a
complex which becomes bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and
streptavidin. The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the

microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound
substances are then removed with ProCell/ProCell M. Application of a voltage to the
electrode then induces chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier.
Results are determined via a calibration curve which is instrument specifically
generated by 2‑point calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent barcode.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies were performed on one cobas e 411 Immunoassay analyzer with one
reagent lot. The samples consisted of PreciControl Varia and human sera pools.
Two replicates of each control and human sera were run per day for 21 days for a
total of 84 replicates. Unaltered serum sample pools were used in addition to spiked
and diluted pools in order to obtain samples to cover the measuring range. CLSI EP5-
A2 guidelines were followed. The precision results are summarized in the table
below:

Reproducibility of the Elecsys Calcitonin assay was evaluated over three
sites using three different cobas e 411 Immunoassay analyzers based on CLSI EP5-A2
guidelines. Sources of variability included testing for 21 days, 2 runs per day, with 2
replicates for each panel member per run at three sites. One reagent lot was evaluated.
Two controls (PCV = PreciControl Varia, Level 1 & 2) and five human serum pools
(HSP) were tested. The human serum pools used were native as well as spiked and
diluted.
The following precision study result summary is from one site and is representative of

The calcitonin linearity study resulted in a polynomial regression in which the 2nd order
polynomial regression was considered significant and yielded a best fit square linearity
equation of y=0.9707x+ 0.0617.
The linearity study supports the sponsor’s claimed measuring range: 1.0 – 2000
pg/mL.
Hook Effect: To evaluate the hook effect, two human serum samples were spiked

e. Analytical specificity:
Cross Reactivity: The specificity of the Elecsys Calcitonin assay was determined
using two human serum sample pools spiked with potential cross-reactant
compounds. The sample analyte concentrations were approximately 10 and 500
pg/mL calcitonin. The spiked and non-spiked samples were tested in duplicate on the
cobas e 411 Immunoassay analyzer. The cross-reactivity results are summarized in
the table below:

Endogenous Interference: The effect on quantitation of analyte in the presence of
endogenous interfering substances using the Elecsys Calcitonin was determined on
the cobas e 411 immunoassay analyzer for the following 8 interfering substances:
Hemoglobin, Biotin, Lipemia, Bilirubin, Rheumatoid Factor, IgG, IgA, and
IgM. For each interfering substance, three spiked human serum samples (one
low, one medium, and one high concentrations of Calcitonin) were used to prepare
dilution series of 11 dilutions that were tested in duplicate. The sponsor defined
significant interference as greater than ± 10% of the unspiked (reference) value. The
endogenous interference effects on analyte quantitation are summarized in the table
below:
Substance Highest Concentration at
which no significant
interference was observed.
Hemoglobin 200 mg/dL
Biotin 40 ng/dL
Intralipid (lipemia) 2000 mg/dL
Bilirubin 66 mg/dL
Rheumatoid Factor 1200 IU/mL
Human IgG 4 g/dL
Human IgM 0.7 g/dL
Human IgA 1.6 g/dL
The sponsor states the following limitation in the labeling:
“Samples showing visible signs of hemolysis may cause interference. Avoid analyzing
samples with hemogloblin concentrations >0.2 g/L.”
“Samples should not be taken from patients receiving therapy with high biotin doses (i.e.
>5 mg/day) until at least 8 hours following the last biotin administration.”
HAMA Effect: The effect of the presence of human anti-mouse antibodies on the
Elecsys Calcitonin assay was assessed on the cobas e 411 Immunoassay Analyzer.
A high HAMA human serum pool 805 μg/L (0.805 μg/mL) was spiked with analyte to
yield calcitonin concentrations of approx. 10 and 500 pg/mL. The high HAMA serum
pool was diluted in 11 dilution series with a serum pool without HAMA. The expected
analyte concentrations were calculated and compared with the observed concentrations
for each diluted sample. The sponsor defined significant interference of HAMA as
greater than ±10% of the expected concentrations. All results were within ±10% of the
expected concentrations.

The sponsor states the following limitation in the labeling:
“Samples from patients routinely exposed to animal or animal serum products may
contain heterophilic antibodies causing an atypical result. This assay has been
formulated to mitigate the risk of this type of interference. However, potential
interactions between rare sera and test components can occur.”
Drug Interference: To assess drug interference on the measurement of calcitonin, 17
pharmaceutical compounds were spiked into two human serum sample pools
and tested with the Elecsys Calcitonin assay on the cobas e 411 Immunoassay
analyzer. The analyte concentration of the sample pools were approx. 10 and 500
pg/mL Calcitonin (spiked). The sponsor defines significant interference as greater than
± 10% of the reference value (unspiked sample). The drug interference results are
summarized in the table below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed comparing the Siemens Immulite 1000
Calcitonin assay run on the Immulite 1000 analyzer (predicate device) to the Elecsys
Calcitonin assay (candidate device) run on the cobas e 411 analyzer. A total of 150
human serum samples were measured in singlicate over a minimum of 5 days. Of
those samples, 19 (12.7%) were altered in order to cover the entire measuring range.
Calcitonin values ranged between 1.61 and 1936 pg/mL for the samples tested.
Results of the Deming Regression analysis are presented below:
Deming Regression: y= 0.998x – 3.05, r=0.991
95% CI of the slope: 0.967/1.03
95% CI of the intercept: -0.452/-0.159
b. Matrix comparison:
The effect on quantitation of calcitonin in the presence of anticoagulants with the
Elecsys Calcitonin Immunoassay was determined by comparing values obtained from
samples drawn into Li-Heparin tubes with and without serum separator gel, K EDTA
2
and K EDTA plasma tubes. Fifty serum/plasma pairs per sample material were
3
tested in singleton with one reagent lot on one cobas e 411 Immunoassay analyzer.
The Passing/Bablok regression analysis results are summarized below:
Serum vs n Slope Intercept Range
(pg/mL)
Lithium Heparin 53 0.951 0.282 1.65-1911
Li-Heparin Gel 54 0.955 0.176 1.65-1911
Separation
K2-EDTA 52 0.956 0.129 1.65-1911
K3-EDTA 53 0.958 0.080 1.65-1911
The resulting data support the package insert claim that serum, Li-
Heparin plasma from tubes with and without gel separation, K -EDTA plasma, and
2
K - EDTA-plasma are acceptable sample types for use with the Elecsys Calcitonin
3
Immunoassay.
