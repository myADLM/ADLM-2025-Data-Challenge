I. Device Description:
The Fastep S10 hCG Serum/Urine Combo Test measures the presence of the hormone
Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) in human urine or serum to aid in the early detection
of pregnancy. The test devices are in two different formats: Strip and Cassette. Results are
read visually by the end user. For a positive result, a colored line appears in the test and
control regions of the device. For a negative result, a colored line appears in the control
region, but no colored line appears in the test region of the device.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None referenced
L. Test Principle:
The Fastep S10 hCG Serum/Urine Combo Test is a lateral flow chromatographic
immunoassay. When the absorbent end of the test is immersed into a serum or urine sample,
the sample is absorbed into the device by capillary action and mixes with the antibody-dye
conjugate (mouse anti-beta hCG monoclonal antibody), flowing across the pre-coated (goat
anti hCG polyclonal antibody) membrane. At analyte concentrations above the target cut off,
it produces a colored test line that indicates a positive result. When analyte concentrations are
below the cutoff, no colored band shows in the test region, indicating a negative result.
One colored line appears in the control region “C” regardless of the presence of hCG. The
presence of this colored line in the “C” region serves as verification for sufficient volume and
proper flow and as a control for the reagents. No line in the “C” region indicates that the test
is invalid.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Negative serum and urine specimens were spiked with varying hCG (commercially
available and traceable to the 4th WHO international Standard) concentrations. The
spiked samples were measured in 10 replicates using 3 different lots for each
format. Tests were performed by three different operators for each lot in 2 runs per
day for 5 days. Results are shown in the following tables:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. This is a qualitative test.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
This test is calibrated with reference material traceable to the World Health
Organization (WHO) 4th International Standard for Chorionic Gonadotropin
(75/589).
The stability testing protocol and acceptance criteria used to support the shelf life
were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor claims a 24-month shelf
life for the test when stored at 39-86ºF (4-30ºC).
d. Detection limit
See section M.1.a above. The sponsor claims that the cut-off values of serum and
urine are 10 mIU/mL and 20 mIU/mL hCG, respectively.
e. Analytical specificity:
A cross-reactivity study was performed by adding known amounts of LH, FSH and
TSH to negative and positive samples using three different lots by three operators.
Results are shown in the following table:

No cross-reactivity was observed for either urine or serum samples at the
concentrations that were tested for LH, FSH and TSH.
To evaluate potential interference from certain exogenous compounds, each
interferent was made at 100X concentrate bulk and spiked into both hCG free and
hCG positive samples. Each spiked sample was mixed for 5 minutes to ensure a
homogeneous solution before testing. Each sample was tested using 3 different lots of
the testing kit. The sponsor states that none of the following substances at the stated
concentrations interfere with the assay.

A pH study was performed to evaluate the device. Results demonstrate that urine and
serum samples with pH 4.0 – 9.0, do not affect the results.
A specific gravity study was performed to evaluate the device. Results demonstrate
that urine samples are not affected when the specific gravity range is from 1.00 to
1.035.
Interference studies to hCG β-core fragment were also performed in samples
containing intact hCG in the presence of β-core fragment at concentrations of 1.0 x
106 picomoles. The results indicate that high levels of hCG β -core fragment (≥ 500
pmol /L) can lead to a positive results for hCG-free samples (in both serum and urine

formats). No false negative results were identified for the sample with 1.0 x 106
picomoles of beta core.
A high dose hook effect study was performed by spiking high levels of hCG
concentrations 62,500-2,000,000 mIU/mL (62,500, 125,000, 250,000, 500,000,
1,000,000 and 2,000,000) into negative urine and serum samples and evaluating the
test result lines. No hook effect was observed up to 2,000,000 mIU/mL hCG.
f. Assay cut-off:
See section M.1.a above. The sponsor claims that the cut-off values of serum and
urine are 10 mIU/mL and 20 mIU/mL hCG, respectively.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed, comparing the results obtained from the
Fastep S10 hCG Serum/Urine Combo Test to the results from the predicate device.
100 urine and 100 serum samples were collected from 100 women (about half of
whom were less than 5 weeks pregnant). All samples were randomly masked prior to
analysis. Samples were tested by three different health professionals with the
candidate device (using three different lots) and the predicate device. Testing was
performed according to the labeling. The results are shown in the tables below.
*All discrepant results were from samples from women subjects who were early in
pregnancy (less than 5 weeks pregnant based on day of last menstrual period) or were
from samples with hCG concentrations around the cut-off of the device.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
The labeling states “hCG concentration in pregnant women rises very rapidly after
implantation, reaching a peak concentration in excess of 200IU/mL about 2-3 months
after the last menstrual period. The Fastep S10 hCG Serum/Urine Combo Test Device
(Urine/Serum) has a cut-off level of 10mIU/ml in serum and 20mIU/ml in urine.
Reportedly, a level of 10-25 mIU/mL or more, is present 7-10 days after conception.
Patients suspected to be pregnant but showing negative test results should be re-tested
with first morning specimens obtained 48-72 hours later.”
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
