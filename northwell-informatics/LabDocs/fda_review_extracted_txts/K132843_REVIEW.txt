H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Verigene® Gram Negative Blood Culture Nucleic Acid Test (BC-GN), performed using the
sample-to-result Verigene System, is a qualitative multiplexed in vitro diagnostic test for the
simultaneous detection and identification of selected gram-negative bacteria and resistance
markers. BC-GN is performed directly on blood culture media using blood culture bottles
identified as positive by a continuous monitoring blood culture system and which contain gram-
negative bacteria as determined by gram stain.
BC-GN detects and identifies the following:
Bacterial Genera and Species Resistance Markers
Acinetobacter spp. CTX-M (bla )
CTX-M
Citrobacter spp. KPC (bla )
KPC
Enterobacter spp. NDM (bla )
NDM
Proteus spp. VIM (bla )
VIM
Escherichia coli1 IMP (bla )
IMP
Klebsiella pneumoniae OXA (bla )
OXA
Klebsiella oxytoca
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
1BC-GN will not distinguish Escherichia coli from Shigella spp. (S. dysenteriae, S. flexneri, S. boydii, and S. sonnei)
BC-GN is indicated for use in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory findings to aid in the
diagnosis of bacterial bloodstream infections; however, it is not used to monitor these infections.
Sub-culturing of positive blood cultures is necessary to recover organisms for antimicrobial
susceptibility testing (AST), for identification of organisms not detected by BC-GN, to detect
mixed infections that may not be detected by BC-GN, for association of antimicrobial resistance
marker genes to a specific organism, or for epidemiological typing.

3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
For use with the Verigene System which consists of a bench top work station consisting of
two modules: the Verigene Processor SP and the Verigene Reader.
I. Device Description:
BC-GN is performed using the Verigene System, which is a bench-top sample-to-result molecular
diagnostics workstation consisting of two modules: the Verigene Processor SP and the Verigene
Reader. The Verigene Processor SP automates the BC-GN sample analysis steps including: (i)
Specimen Preparation - cell lysis and magnetic bead-based nucleic acid extraction from positive blood
culture specimens and (ii) Hybridization—bacterial DNA hybridization to target specific capture DNA
in a microarray format and mediator and gold-nanoparticle probe hybridization to captured bacterial
nucleic acids. Silver enhancement of the bound gold nanoparticle probes at the capture sites results in
gold-silver aggregates that are assessed optically by the Verigene Reader. The Verigene Reader also
serves as the user interface and central control unit for the Verigene System, storing and tracking
information throughout the assay process.
The Verigene Processor SP utilizes single-use disposables to perform BC-GN, including an Extraction
Tray, Utility Tray, and Verigene Test Cartridge. A separate Tip Holder Assembly contains two
pipette tips that are used to transfer and mix reagents during the assay. The user tests a specimen by
loading the single-use disposables into the Verigene Processor SP, pipetting the prepared specimen
into the Extraction Tray, and initiating the protocol on the Verigene Reader by scanning or entering the
Test Cartridge ID and specimen information. Following assay completion, the user inserts the Test
Cartridge into the Verigene Reader for optical analysis and generation of BC-GN test results.
The Verigene BC-GN Kit contains:
· Verigene BC-GN Test Cartridges: Each Test Cartridge comes preloaded with all required
reaction solutions, including wash solutions, oligonucleotide probe solution and signal
amplification solutions.
· Verigene BC-GN Extraction Trays (with Tip Holder Assemblies): Each Extraction Tray comes
preloaded with all required solutions, including lysis/binding buffer, digestion enzymes, wash
solutions, and buffer solutions necessary to extract nucleic acids.
The Verigene BC-GN Utility Kit contains Verigene BC-GN Utility Trays. Each Utility Tray comes
preloaded with an Internal Processing Control.

L. Test Principle:
The Verigene Gram Negative Blood Culture Nucleic Acid Test (BC-GN) is a
molecular assay which relies on detection of specific nucleic acid targets in a
microarray format. The Verigene Processor SP executes the test procedure,
automating the steps of (1) Sample Preparation– cell lysis and magnetic bead-based
bacterial DNA isolation from blood culture samples, and (2) Hybridization–detection
and identification of bacterial-specific DNA in a microarray format by using gold
nanoparticle probe-based technology. Once the specimen is loaded by the operator, all
other fluid transfer steps are performed by an automated pipette that transfers reagents
between wells of the trays and loads the specimen into the Test Cartridge for
hybridization. Single-use disposable test consumables and a self-contained Verigene
Test Cartridge are utilized for each sample tested with the BC-GN test.
6

--- Page 7 ---
For each of the bacterial DNA sequences detected by the BC-GN test, unique Capture
and Mediator oligonucleotides are utilized. The Capture oligonucleotides are
covalently bound to the microarray substrate and hybridize to a specific portion of the
nucleic acid targets. The Mediator oligonucleotides have regions which bind to a
different portion of the same nucleic acid targets and also have sequences which
allow binding of gold nanoparticle probes. Specific silver enhancement of the bound
gold nanoparticle probes at the capture sites results in gold-silver aggregates that
scatter light, allowing detection of target capture.
To obtain the test results after processing is complete, the user removes the Test
Cartridge from the Processor SP, and inserts the substrate holder into the Reader for
analysis. Light scatter from the capture spots is imaged by the Reader and intensities
from the microarray spots are used to make a determination regarding the presence
(Detected) or absence (Not Detected) of a bacterial nucleic acid sequence/analyte.
This determination is made by means of software-based decision algorithm resident
in the Reader.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Reproducibility:
A reproducibility study was performed at three external clinical testing sites
with test panels consisting of samples prepared with eight different targeted
organisms tested at two concentrations: the concentration at bottle positivity
and eight hours after bottle positivity. All BC-GN targeted resistance genes
were represented in one or more of the organisms tested. Two negative
samples were also tested, one containing negative human whole blood and
blood culture media only and one containing Morganella morganii, an
organism not detected by BC-GN. Samples were prepared by spiking
organisms at 5-30 CFU/bottle into blood culture bottles containing blood
culture media and negative human whole blood. Bottles were incubated on the
BACTEC 9050 System and removed at bottle positivity and at eight hours
past bottle positivity. Single-use aliquots were frozen at <70°C and shipped to
testing sites. The 16 panel members were tested in triplicate twice daily by
two operators for five non-consecutive days generating 90 results per panel
member. The panel members are provided in the following table.

* BP – ‘bottle positivity’ or evidence of bacterial growth in the automated blood culture monitoring system
** Two preparations of A. baumanii were used in the study.
A total of 1620 initial tests were conducted. There were nine pre-analysis
errors (pre-AE) for an initial pre-AE rate of 0.5% (9/1652). All nine were
repeated and yielded valid results. There were 23 initial No Calls for an initial
No Call rate of 23/1652 or 1.4%. Repeat testing was performed for each of the
23 samples with all yielding valid results. The final call rate (number of valid
tests/total tests conducted) was 100% (1620/1620) with all replicates yielding
the expected result for each panel member. Test results as shown in the
following table indicate that the Verigene BC-GN Test yielded reproducible
results in the multi-center study.

addition, two negative samples were tested, one containing negative human
whole blood and blood culture media only and one containing Halnia alvei, an
organism not detected by BC-GN. Tested was performed in duplicate twice
daily by two operators for 12 non-consecutive days. Samples were prepared
by spiking organisms at 5-30 CFU/bottle into blood culture bottles containing
blood culture media and negative human whole blood. Bottles were grown on
the BACTEC 9050 System and removed at bottle positivity and at eight hours
past bottle positivity. Panel members were tested twice daily by two operators
over 12 non-consecutive days for a total of 48 replicates per panel member.

Testing generated 48 results per panel member for a total of 864 test results.
All replicates for each panel member yielded concordant results with the
exception of one false positive result for the K. oxytoca target in one replicate
of the K. pneumoniae panel member. Evaluation by in silico analysis suggests
a low likelihood of cross-reactivity for K. pneumoniae with the BC-GN gene
target for K. oxytoca. As a result of the observed cross-reactivity and in silico
investigation, the draft BC-GN Package Insert contains the following
limitation:

Based on sequence homology analysis and analytical testing, a low
likelihood of cross-reactivity exists between BC-GN probes which detect
Klebsiella pneumoniae and the gene target for Klebsiella oxytoca.
Therefore, on rare occasions, both a “K. oxytoca Detected” result and a
“K. pneumoniae Detected” result may be obtained when Klebsiella
pneumoniae is present in the specimen.

c. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
d. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Internal Controls: BC-GN contains two sets of internal controls to ensure
proper fluid control, hybridization, and signal detection.
Internal Control 1 (INT CTL 1) is a processing control which detects the
presence (hybridization and signal enhancement) of an artificial DNA
oligonucleotide construct and mediator oligonucleotide contained within the
Sample buffer on the Extraction Tray. This material serves to monitor
hybridization inhibition or test cartridge reagent failures. If the signals from
INT CTL 1 are not valid the test should be repeated.
Internal Control 2 (INT CTL 2) is comprised of an intact non-target, gram-
negative bacterium (Shewanella oneidensis) contained within the BC-GN
utility tray and added to the sample prior to the nucleic acid extraction step.
INT CTL2 functions as a complete assay control, the primary purpose of
which is to monitor failures attributable to the specimen preparation step (i.e.,
lysis and nucleic acid isolation) it also functions as a hybridization/detection
control. If the signals from INT CTL2 are not valid the test should be
repeated.
When detecting a negative sample, both the internal processing controls INT
CTL 1 and INT CTL 2 must be present for a valid “Not Detected” call for all
targets to be reported. If INT CTL 1 or INT CTL 2 is “Not Detected,” a “No
Call – INT CTL 1” or a “No Call – INT CTL 2” result, respectively, is
generated. If both INT CTL 1 and INT CTL 2 are “Not Detected”, a “NO
CALL – INT CTL” result is generated. These internal controls are not
utilized for the detection of positive samples.
External Controls: External controls are not included with the BC-GN Test
but are recommended for routine testing on a rotating basis using 3-4 smaller
groups of organisms, and/or under the following circumstances:
· Instrument installation, test validation, and when troubleshooting is
necessary
· During performance verification for receipt of a new set/lot of
consumables
· When the integrity of consumables or the device is in question.

External positive controls may consist of frozen aliquots of positive blood
cultures containing organisms targeted by BC-GN. External quality control
testing should be performed in conformance with local, state, and federal
regulations or accreditations organizations as applicable and should follow the
user’s laboratory standard quality control procedures.
System Controls: Each cartridge has a number of internal controls to confirm
proper test performance, including: imaging controls, background controls,
negative controls, extraction controls and hybridization controls. In addition,
the Verigene System continuously monitors system performance while the
assay is running. Failures of any instrument controls will result in procedure
termination (Pre-Analytical Error, Pre-AE).
Specimen Stability:
Positive blood culture specimens can be tested with the BC-GN Test
immediately after the blood culture is signaled as positive and up to 24 hours
post bottle ring when stored at 2-37°C. Studies to support these claims
included testing at the low, middle and high end of the temperature range over
a 36-hour period. A panel of eight contrived specimens, representing the full
panel of bacterial and resistance targets was tested. BACTEC Plus Aerobic
blood culture bottles containing negative human whole blood were inoculated
with low concentrations of organisms and incubated on an automated blood
culture system until “bottle positivity”. Study results presented in the
following table demonstrated that all analytes were detected in all replicates
after storage in the claimed storage conditions.

e. Limit of Detection
The analytical sensitivity of the BC-GN Test was evaluated by testing
bacterial strains representative of BC-GN targets. A sub-culture of each strain
was inoculated into BACTEC Plus bottles spiked with 10 mL of fresh, anti-
coagulated whole blood, and grown to bottle positivity on the BACTEC blood
culture system. To provide the most challenging matrix, each positive blood
culture sample was then used to prepare a dilution series using a simulated
matrix consisting of BacT/ALERT FA Culture bottle media (containing
charcoal), negative human whole blood, and Staphyloccoccus epidermidis (a
common skin contaminant. ) The Staphylococcus epidermidis was present in
the matrix at a minimum concentration of 1 x 107 CFU/mL.
A total of 12 organisms were tested in the study with four replicates of each
sample tested at multiple dilutions in order to determine the preliminary LoD.
Confirmation testing was performed and the final LoD determined as the
concentration for which 19/20 or 20/20 replicates were detected. For C.
freundii, C. koseri, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris and E. coli, confirmation testing
did not yield a detection rate of at least 95%; therefore confirmatory testing
for these organisms was repeated at the next highest concentration.
Study results demonstrated that the LoD for each organism is lower than the
concentration present at bottle positivity. A summary of the LoD confirmation
testing for each organism and resistance marker is shown in the following
table.

f. Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity):
The analytical reactivity of the BC-GN Test was evaluated using a panel of
195 strains for 45 different bacterial species. Samples were prepared by
inoculating each organism into a blood culture bottle containing negative anti-
coagulated human whole blood. Bottles were then incubated on the BACTEC
blood culture instrument until bottle positivity followed by subculturing to
agar media for purity checks and colony counts.
Organisms were selected to cover the genetic diversity of each BC-GN target
and antibiotic resistance marker. At least 10 strains for each species target and
resistance marker target were evaluated, with additional strains evaluated for
genus level targets. Testing was performed in triplicate and included the
following for the BC-GN species targets: 10 strains of K. oxytoca, 25 strains
of K. pneumoniae, 13 strains of P. aeruginosa, eight species of Shigella sp.
and 17 strains of E. coli. Additional replicates were tested for any organism
that yielded discordant results. Organisms evaluated for the genus level targets
are presented in the following table:

Inclusivity testing yielded the expected results for bacterial and resistance
targets with the following exceptions:
· In two strains of A. radioresistans (out of thirteen total strains of
Acinetobacter sp. containing the OXA gene), 4 of 12 replicates for one
strain and 5 of 12 replicates for a second strain yielded false negative
results for the OXA target. The Acinetobacter spp. target was
correctly detected in all replicates.
· In 2 of 9 replicates for one strain of C. amaloniticus, BC-GN gave
false negative results for the Citrobacter spp. target.
An investigation to determine the cause for the false negative OXA results
discovered that the OXA signals for these two strains were weaker than those
observed for other organisms with this marker. The potential for false negative
results for OXA lead to the inclusion of the following limitations in the
package insert:
· In rare instances for specimens with organisms carrying a resistance
marker, BC-GN may not yield a positive result for the resistance
marker when the organism(s) is detected.
· False negative results for OXA may occur in certain Acinetobacter
radioresistens strains that result as “Acinetobacter Detected” with
BC-GN.
One strain of Citrobacter amalonaticus (ATCC 25405) yielded false negative
results for 2 of 9 replicates; however another strain (ATCC 25407) yielded the
expected results in 9/9 replicates. In silico analysis based on probe sequence
homology mismatches suggests that BC-GN could potentially yield a false
negative result for C. amalonaticus and therefore the following limitation is
included in the package insert:
· In silico sequence analysis indicated sequence homology mismatches
of C. amalonaticus that may yield false negative results, as
demonstrated during BC-GN analytical testing, which resulted in
detection of “Citrobacter” a total of 16 out of 18 tests (88.9%) for
these organisms.
As predicted by in silico analysis, all replicates for Shigella boydii, S.
dysenteriae, S. flexneri, and S. sonnei were detected with the BC-GN test, and
reported as E. coli. The following limitation has been added to the BC-GN
package insert.
· BC-GN will not distinguish Escherichia coli from Shigella spp.
including S. dysenteriae, S. flexneri, S. boydii, and S. sonnei.

Of the 195 strains tested in the inclusivity studies, 79 contained one or more
resistance markers associated with 11 different bacterial species including a
total of 38 strains containing CTX-M, 16 containing OXA, 12 containing
IMP, 10 containing VIM, 10 containing KPC, and 9 containing NDM.
Separately, in silico analysis was performed by aligning the assay probes for
each of the strains/organisms against available GenBank sequence entries.
The following table includes the various resistance marker subgroups and
types that were evaluated by wet-testing and by in silico analysis.

(1) The BC-GN probe binding sites in these types are identical to those in the wet tested types; therefore, BC-
GN performance for these types is expected to be the same as those that were wet tested.
(2) These specific resistance marker types and subtypes were evaluated by in silico analysis only.
The following two tables provide resistance marker types associated with the
bacterial species that were evaluated by wet-testing during the Clinical and
Analytical Studies, respectively.

g. Analytical specificity (Exclusivity):
Analytical specificity was evaluated using organisms phylogenetically
related to panel organisms detected by the BC-GN test, common blood-
borne pathogens, organisms without gene sequence information, as well
as organisms potentially present as contaminants in blood culture
specimens.
Strains were grown in BACTEC blood culture bottles to positivity,
checked for purity, quantitated to ensure concentrations of greater than
106 CFU/mL, and assayed with the BC-GN test in triplicate. For safety
reasons, Neisseria meningitidis (ATCC 53414D-5) and Cryptococcus
neoformans (ATCC 66031D-5) were tested using genomic DNA (2.4×107

and 3.6x106 copies/assay, respectively). In cases where some degree of
cross-reactivity was observed in the initial testing, an additional six
replicates were tested.
Samples were divided into two distinct panels of organisms. The first
panel consisted of 195 “BC-GN panel” organisms, which in total
comprised the analytical inclusivity study samples. There were no false
positive results observed for any of the samples tested in this panel.
The second panel consisted of 172 “non-BC-GN panel” organisms
including 94 strains of gram negative bacterial strains (88 gram negative
rods, six gram-negative cocci), 71 gram positive bacterial strains, and
seven yeast strains. The following tables present the non-BC-GN panel
organisms that were evaluated.

h. Assay cut-off:
For the BC-GN Test, the presence or absence of each target analyte is
determined by the mean intensity of target capture spots relative to the Signal
Detection Threshold. The capture and mediator oligonucleotides in the BC-
GN test are designed to eliminate sequence-related cross-reactivity, thereby
ensuring that the non- specific target signal intensities at capture spots are
similar to the microarray background signal. At cell concentrations of
positive culture samples, target hybridization to complementary capture and
mediator probes is expected to give signals that are well-separated from
negative capture spots. When reading a test slide, multiple images of each
array are taken at increasing exposures times and the final target group mean
intensity value for an analyte is assigned at the shortest exposure at which the
value exceeds the Signal Detection Threshold. If none of the target signals
exceeds the threshold for any exposure, the mean spot intensity is evaluated
at the longest exposure taken. In order to verify the cutoffs (signal thresholds)
for the BC-GN Test, the target mean intensity values were examined for a
panel of 18 contrived specimens, representing all of the BC-GN test analytes
as well as two additional organisms not detected by the BC-GN test, which
served as negative organism controls. In all, 2460 data points were compiled
for the threshold evaluation, using logistic fit and ROC statistics.
i. Fresh versus Frozen Study:
In order to utilize frozen clinical blood culture samples in the clinical study
and frozen contrived samples in analytical studies, an analytical study was
conducted to demonstrate if multiple cycles of freezing and thawing of
specimens will affect BC-GN Test results. The study included multiple
freeze/thaw cycles; however all samples tested in the precision,
reproducibility and clinical studies were subjected to only one freeze/thaw
cycle.

Testing was performed with panel members consisting of eight contrived
samples representing all of the BC-GN analytes and two additional organisms,
Hafnia alvei and Staphylococcus epidermidis (a common skin contaminant)
which are not detected by the BC-GN test and served as negative controls.
Organisms were inoculated into blood culture bottles containing 10 mL of
negative human whole blood and incubated on a blood culture instrument
until positivity. Aliquots of each blood culture were stored at -70°C for 24
hours before testing with BC-GN. Additional aliquots were subjected to an
additional freeze/thaw cycle with storage at -70°C for at least 24 hours
between cycles. Study results demonstrated the expected positive and negative
results for all BC-GN analytes for freshly tested samples as well as for
samples that were tested after one or two freeze/thaw cycles and therefore
supports the use of frozen specimens in the clinical, precision and
reproducibility studies.

j. Interference:
Potential inhibitory effects of substances that may be encountered in blood and
associated with the blood culturing process were evaluated for potential
interference of the BC-GN Test. Samples were prepared by growing organisms
in blood culture bottles on a blood culture instrument until bottle positivity
followed by spiking each potential interferent into the positive blood culture
sample. Control samples containing no interferents were also tested. All
samples were tested in triplicate with BC-GN. Testing included the following
representative strains: A. baumannii (OXA), C. freundii (VIM), E. cloacae
(KPC), E. coli (NDM), K. pneumoniae (OXA, CTX-M), K. oxytoca (CTX-M),

k. Mixed Culture Study (Competitive Inhibition):
A competitive inhibition study was conducted to evaluate the impact of mixed
cultures on BC-GN performance. Combinations of eight organisms with
resistance markers representing all BC-GN panel targets (for a total of 28
paired combinations) were co-inoculated into individual blood culture bottles at
clinically-relevant starting concentrations, and incubated on a blood culture
instrument until positivity. BC-GN correctly detected the bacteria and
resistance marker(s) for four of the eight target organisms together with their
associated resistance marker present in co-inoculated blood culture bottles (A.
baumannii/OXA, C. freundii/VIM, K. pneumoniae/OXA and CTX-M, and P.
mirabilis), demonstrating that these organisms are not subject to competitive
inhibition at concentrations expected in routine clinical practice.
For samples containing E. cloacae, E. coli, K. oxytoca, and P. aeruginosa
mixed with other targeted organisms, at least one of the expected bacterial or
resistance marker targets was not detected in one or more replicates. Because
the study design included growing paired organisms in a blood culture bottle
until positivity, it was thought that the cause for false negative results was
likely due to differences in growth rates between organisms (i.e., At positivity,
the slower growing organism may be present at a concentration below LoD).

A second competitive inhibition study was conducted to further evaluate
representative combinations of the four organisms for which at least one false
negative result was observed during the first study. In this study, each sample
was prepared to contain both organisms at “bottle positivity” concentrations.
The following nine organism combinations were evaluated in this second study:
`
Primary Organism Secondary Organism Combination No.
E. coli (NDM) K. pneumoniae (CTX-M/OXA) 1
A. baumanii (OXA) 2
E. coli (NDM) 3
K. oxytoca (CTX-M)
K. pneumoniae (CTX-M/OXA) 4
P. mirabilis 5
A. baumanii (OXA) 6
E. cloacae (KPC) 7
P. aeruginosa (IMP)
E. coli (NDM) 8
K. oxytoca (CTX-M) 9
Eight of the nine organism combinations evaluated in the second study yielded the
expected results for all analytes. For one combination (K. oxytoca/CTX-M and E.
coli/NDM), 2/9 replicates yielded false negative results for the K. oxytoca target
and correct results (9/9) for the CTX-M, E. coli, and NDM targets. This second
study demonstrated that except for mixed cultures of K. oxytoca and E. coli, growth
rate and not competitive inhibition was the likely contributing factor to observed
false negative results in the initial competitive inhibition study. The following
limitation is included in the package insert:
· In mixed cultures containing gram-negative bacteria and other organisms,
BC-GN may not identify all the detectable organisms in the specimen.
l. Universal Blood Culture Bottle Validation
The performance of BC-GN was evaluated for thirteen 13 types of blood culture
media using three different automated blood culture monitoring systems. The
following bottle types and representative organisms/resistance markers were
evaluated:

Bottles were inoculated with organism suspensions into blood culture
bottles containing 10 mL of negative human whole blood. Bottles were
placed on the appropriate culture system until ring positivity. Additionally,
a single negative blood culture specimen was created for each bottle type
by adding 10 mL of negative whole blood and incubating for a minimum of
5 days prior to testing with BC-GN. The study evaluated 300 bottles (12
bottle types x 3 replicate bottles per organism x 8 organisms + 12 negative
samples).
Upon reaching bottle positivity, an aliquot of each sample was tested
in triplicate with BC-GN. To assess specimen stability in the various
bottles, one bottle of each organism was then stored for 36 hours at
each of three temperature conditions: 2-8 ºC (refrigerated), 20 -
25.5ºC (ambient), and 34-37ºC (on the blood culture system), after
which BC-GN tests (one test/bottle) were performed.
As expected, the obligate aerobes, A. baumanii and P. aeruginosa, did not
grow in any of the anaerobic bottle types and therefore was not evaluated
in these bottles. In addition, A. baumanii repeatedly did not grow in one
aerobic bottle (VersaTREK REDOX 1 EZ Draw/Aerobic) and therefore the
performance of BC-GN with this organism and bottle type is unknown.
The following limitation is included in the package insert:
· The performance of BC-GN for the detection of A. baumanii in the
VersaTREK REDOX 1 EZ Draw/Aerobic bottle is unknown.
All replicates yielded expected positive result for targeted analyes present
in the sample with the exception of two A. baumannii samples grown in
two separate BACTEC Standard Aerobic/F bottles. For these samples, the
Acinetobacter target was detected in all replicates; however the BC-GN
Test failed to detect the OXA target in one of three replicates for each
bottle. In order to assess if the false negative results for OXA were due to
the use of BACTEC Standard Aerobic/F bottles, an additional 10 bottles

containing the same strain of A. baumanii were tested. All replicates from
this additional testing yielded the expected result for the Acinetobacter
and OXA targets. Therefore, it was determined that the cause for the initial
two false negative OXA results was not due to the bottle type.
With the exception of the bottle/organism combinations that did not grow,
the study results demonstrated that the 13 blood culture bottle types are
appropriate for use with BC-GN and that specimens are stable in those
bottles at refrigerated (2-8°C), ambient (18-24°C), and culture system (34-
37°C) storage conditions for up to 36 hours after reaching bottle positivity.
m. Carryover Study/Cross-Contamination Study:
A study was performed using 12 Verigene SP instruments to assess the
potential for carryover/cross-contamination with BC-GN by alternately running
“high positive” samples followed by negative samples. Representative strains
of A. baumannii (OXA), C. freundii (VIM), C. sedlakii, C. koseri, E. cloacae
(KPC), E. aerogenes, E. coli (NDM), K. pneumoniae (CTX-M, OXA), K.
oxytoca, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa (IMP) were used to prepare the high
positive samples at concentrations at least as high as those found at eight hours
past bottle positivity. Six runs of alternating high positive and negative samples
were run on each of the 12 Verigene SP instruments for a total of 72 BC-GN
test runs.
The study demonstrated that all of the high positive samples yielded the
expected “Detected” results for the expected bacterial and resistance marker
analytes and “Not Detected” results for the other analytes. In addition, all
negative samples gave a ‘Not Detected” result for all analytes. The study
demonstrated that the BC-GN Test does not exhibit carryover or cross-
contamination that could result in a false positive test result.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
N/A
b. Matrix comparison:
N/A
c. Clinical studies:
A method comparison study was conducted at multiple external clinical study
sites to evaluate the performance of BC-GN. Subjects included individuals whose
routine care called for blood culture testing and whose blood culture specimens
were determined to be positive for growth by an automated blood culturing
28

system and subsequently determined to contain gram-negative organisms by
Gram stain. Specimens were tested with BC-GN as well as sub-cultured to obtain
bacterial isolates. BC-GN results for bacterial analytes were compared to standard
of care biochemical identification of blood culture isolates. BC-GN results for
resistance markers were compared to PCR followed by confirmatory bi-
directional sequencing for specimens with positive PCR results.
External control testing was performed daily at each study testing site with
positive and negative controls. Testing of external controls included a rotation of
nine different positive controls representing all BC-GN analytes. The negative
control sample was prepared with 8-10 mL of negative whole blood in BACTEC
Aerobic/F bottles and incubating on the blood culture instrument for 48 hours.
Positive control samples were prepared with negative whole blood and organisms
and were incubated on the blood culture instrument until bottle positivity. The
controls were divided into single-use aliquots, stored at -70°C and distributed to
the testing sites until thawed for testing.
Testing included 604 prospectively collected and tested fresh specimens, 272
prospectively collected and retrospectively tested frozen specimens (all comers),
239 retrospectively tested selected frozen specimens, and 297 simulated frozen
specimens.
Simulated specimens were prepared by spiking organisms into blood culture
bottles containing 8-10 mL of negative human blood and incubated on an
automated blood culture instrument until bottle positivity, after which specimen
aliquots were frozen and distributed to clinical testing sites.
There were 1434 evaluable specimens enrolled in the clinical trial; 62 specimens
had an initial BC-GN “No Call” result (4.3%)and 11 specimens had initial Pre-
Analytical Errors (0.8%) for an initial valid test rate of 94.9%. Of the 62 initial
No-Calls, 41 yielded a valid test result upon retesting and of the 11 initial Pre-
AEs, 10 yielded a valid test result upon repeat and one was classified as a final
Pre-AE. The final “No Call” rate was 1.5% (21/1434 speicmens) and the final
Pre-Analysis Error rate was 0.8% (12/1507 tests run) for a total final valid test
rate of 97.7%. The 22 specimens that did not yield a final valid result were not
included in the analysis. Thus, 1412 specimens were analyzed in this clinical
evaluation to establish clinical performance of the test.
Summaries of the clinical performance of BC-GN for detection of the 14 targeted
organism and resistant markers is summarized below in the following three tables:

For informational purposes, the performance of BC-GN was evaluated for
detection of KPC, OXA, NDM, VIM, and IMP as compared to phenotypic
antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) results. Meropenem agar gradient
diffusion was performed for 993 specimens of the 1266 specimen dataset used for
the resistance marker performance tables presented above. MIC results were
interpreted using current CLSI breakpoints.
The percent positive agreement (PPA) for this comparison was calculated as 100%
x (TP/TP + FN). A true positive (TP) is positive by BC-GN for KPC, OXA,
NDM, VIM, and/or IMP and resistant (R) or intermediate (I) to Meropenem. A
false negative (FN) is negative by BC-GN for KPC, OXA, NDM, VIM, and/or
IMP and resistant (R) or intermediate (I) to Meropenem. The negative percent
agreement (NPA) for this comparison was calculated as 100% x (TN/TN + FP). A
true negative (TN) is negative by BC-GN for KPC, OXA, NDM, VIM, and/or IMP
and susceptible (S) to Meropenem. A false positive (FP) is positive by BC-GN for
KPC, OXA, NDM, VIM, and/or IMP and susceptible (S) to Meropenem.
Results stratified by organism and resistance marker are presented in the following
table. It is noted that “false negative” results can occur when carbapenem
resistance is caused by mechanisms other than by the presence of the five targeted
resistance genes. In addition, it is noted that “false positive results” can occur
because the presence of a resistance marker may not always infer resistance to
meropenem. The following limitations/statements are included in the package
insert.
· Carbapenem resistance in the organisms detected by BC-GN can be due to
mechanisms other than acquisition of the KPC (bla ), OXA (bla ), NDM

b) Detection of KPC, OXA, NDM, VIM, or IMP resistance markers may not always infer resistance to carbapenems.
For informational purposes, the performance of BC-GN was evaluated for
detection of CTX-M as compared to phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing
(AST) results. Agar gradient diffusion using ceftazadime and ceftriaxone was
performed for 993 specimens of the 1266 specimen dataset used for the
performance table presented above for the CTX-M target. MIC results were
interpreted using current CLSI breakpoints.
The percent positive agreement (PPA) for this comparison was calculated as 100%
x (TP/TP + FN). A true positive (TP) is positive by BC-GN for CTX-M and
resistant/intermediate to Ceftazadime only or resistant/intermediate to Ceftazadime
and/or Ceftriaxone. A false negative (FN) is negative by BC-GN for CTX-M and
resistant/intermediate to Ceftazadime only or resistant/intermediate to Ceftazadime
and/or Ceftriaxone. The negative percent agreement (NPA) for this comparison
was calculated as 100% x (TN/TN + FP). A true negative (TN) is negative by BC-
GN for CTX-M and susceptible to Ceftazadime only or susceptible to Ceftazidime
and Ceftriaxone. A false positive (FP) is positive by BC-GN for CTX-M and
susceptible to Ceftazadime only or susceptible to Ceftazidime and Ceftriaxone.
Results for detection of the CTX-M resistance marker as compared to ASTf
ceftazidime and/or ceftriaxone are provided in the table below. It is noted that
“false negative” results can occur when resistance is caused by other mechanisms
than by the presence of the CTX-M gene. In addition, it is noted that “false
positive results” can occur because the presence of CTX-M may not always infer
resistance to ceftazidime or ceftriaxone. The following limitation/statements are
included in the package insert.

N. Instrument Name:
Verigene Processor SP
Verigene Reader
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Reader is the Verigene System’s central control unit and user interface,
and, with a touch-screen control panel and barcode scanner, guides the user
through test processing, imaging, and test result generation. The Verigene
Processor SP executes the test procedure, automating the steps of (1) Sample
Preparation– cell lysis and magnetic bead-based bacterial DNA isolation from
blood culture samples, and (2) Hybridization– detection and identification of
bacterial-specific DNA in a microarray format by using gold nanoparticle
probe-based technology. Once the specimen is loaded by the operator, all other
fluid transfer steps are performed by an automated pipette that transfers reagents
between wells of the trays and loads the specimen into the Test Cartridge for

hybridization. Single-use disposable test consumables and a self-contained
Verigene Test Cartridge are utilized for each sample tested with the BC-GN
test.
To obtain the test results after processing is complete, the user removes the
Test Cartridge from the Processor SP, and inserts the substrate holder into the
Reader for analysis. Determination of the presence or absence of each targeted
analyte is made by means of software-based decision algorithm resident in the
Reader.
