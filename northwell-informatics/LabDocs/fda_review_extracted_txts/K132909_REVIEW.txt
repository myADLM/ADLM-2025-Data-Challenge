4. Special instrument requirements:
For use with the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System
I. Device Description:
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System includes instrumentation and
software, sealed and self-inoculating molded polystyrene trays with 136 micro-wells
containing dried reagents, and specific inoculum broth formulations for identification
(ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST). The organism to be tested must be in
pure culture and preliminarily identified as Gram-positive or Gram-negative. Colonies
are then suspended in the ID broth, and, using one of the recommended BD nephelometer
devices, brought to a concentration of 0.5 McFarland. A further dilution is made into the
AST broth. Prior to inoculation of the panel, an AST broth indicator is added which
changes the AST broth to a blue color. The AST broth is a cation-adjusted formulation
of Mueller-Hinton broth containing 0.01% Tween 80, and has a final isolate
concentration of approximately 5X105 CFU/mL. After inoculation and incubation, the
AST broth indicator in the AST broth changes from blue to pink to colorless as organism
growth and reduction in the panel well occurs. Inoculated panels are barcode scanned
and loaded into the BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System instrument where
the panels are incubated at 35°C and continuously measured for changes to the indicator
and bacterial turbidity to determine bacterial growth in the presence of an antimicrobial
agent. Organisms killed or inhibited by a given antimicrobial do not cause reduction of
the indicator and therefore do not produce a color change. Additional interpretation is
done using the software driven “EXPERT” System triggered rules derived from the CLSI
standards and/or FDA drug labeling. Readings are taken every 20 minutes and a final
AST result in 4 to16 hours. The AST result is determined via automated readings; no
manual readings are possible with this system.

Systems; Guidance for Industry and FDA
L. Test Principle:
The BD Phoenix™ Automated Microbiology System is a broth based microdilution method
that utilizes a redox indicator (colorimetric oxidation-reduction) to enhance detection of
organism growth. The MIC is determined by comparing growth in wells containing serial
two-fold dilutions of an antibiotic to the growth in “growth control wells” that contain no
antibiotic.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility testing using inocula prepared manually and standardized using the
PhoenixSpec nephelometer was conducted at three external sites. Ten isolates with
on-scale MIC values as predetermined by reference methods were provided to the
testing sites by BD. Isolate identification and expected MIC result was blinded to
those conducting the testing. Testing was performed in triplicate on three separate
days.
Reproducibility testing using inocula prepared by the Phoenix AP instrument was
conducted at two external sites and one internal site. Testing was conducted using 16
isolates with on-scale MIC values. Isolate identification and expected MIC result was
blinded to those conducting the testing. Testing was performed in triplicate on three
separate days.
Results of the inter-site and intra-site reproducibility studies were acceptable and
demonstrated best case and worst case results of greater than 95%. A summary of the
reproducibility study performance is illustrated in Table 2 below.

Best case calculation for reproducibility assumes off-scale results are within one well
of the mode MIC value. Worst case calculation for reproducibility assumes off-
scale results are greater than one well from the mode MIC value.
Regarding the manual inoculation method, best case, 1 MIC result was off-scale;
worst case, 7 MIC results were off-scale. There were a total of 270 MIC values
evaluated.
Regarding the automated inoculation method (AP Instrument), best case, no MIC
results were off-scale; worst case 13 MIC results were off scale. There were a
total of 432 MIC values evaluated.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The FDA and CLSI recommended quality control (QC) isolate, E. coli ATCC 25922
was each day of the challenge and clinical study testing with the reference method
and with the BD Phoenix System. The inocula were standardized using both the
automated (Phoenix AP) and manual (PhoenixSpec) methods. A sufficient number of
tests were performed and all quality control results for the BD Phoenix fell within the
acceptable ranges demonstrating that the BD Phoenix System can consistently
produce quality control results in the recommended range for tigecycline.
Quality control testing of the BD Phoenix – Tigecycline was conducted to
demonstrate that acceptable results were achieved >95% of the time by both auto-
dilution and manual dilution inoculum preparation methods.

analysis.
Inoculum Density Control: The BD PhoenixSpec Nephelometer was used to prepare the
inocula for testing of the clinical, challenge, reproducibility and QC isolates. The same
inoculum suspension was used for both the Phoenix System and the reference method
testing. The BD Phoenix AP instrument was used to standardize the inocula for
challenge, QC, and reproducibility isolates. Validation data for both the PhoenixSpec
and the Phoenix AP instrument was provided and found to be acceptable.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The accuracy of results obtained with the Phoenix System was determined by
comparison to the CLSI-recommended broth dilution method (reference method).
Reference panels were prepared according to CLSI M07-A8 guidelines. Sites
performed testing on gram-negative isolates using Phoenix and reference panel
formats appropriate for gram negative organisms. Antimicrobial agents in the test
and reference panels had identical dilution ranges which were appropriate for the
interpretive breakpoints of the drug. Testing was performed using at least two
different production lots of Phoenix panels, AST broth and AST indicator at each
study site. A minimum of three different lots of the Phoenix panel were used across
all sites for the entire study. Phoenix and reference panels were inoculated using the
same organism suspension.
Growth in the Phoenix panels was determined from data recorded by the instrument.
Performance was analyzed using FDA breakpoints for tigecycline, and results were
compared to results obtained by the broth microdilution reference method based on
the guidelines provided in the Class II Special Controls Guidance Document:
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems.
A total of 715 clinical isolates were tested at the three study sites and included both
fresh and stock isolates (38 C. freundii, 25 C. koseri, 15 Citrobacter spp., 34 E.
aerogenes, 83 E. cloacae, 5 Enterobacter spp., 279 E. coli, 53 K. oxytoca, 131 K.

--- Page 8 ---
pneumoniae, 4 miscellaneous enteric, 46 S. marcescens, 2 Serratia spp.) . Stock
isolates comprised 34% of total isolates tested. Clinical isolates tested included
representatives of species listed in the FDA pharmaceutical drug label. Clinical isolates
were tested using inocula prepared using the PhoenixSpec nephelometer (manual
method).
A total of 169 challenge isolates were supplied to the testing sites by the sponsor (13
C. freundii, 4 C. koseri, 1 Citrobacter spp., 14 E. aerogenes, 19 E. cloacae, 48 E.
coli, 14 K. oxytoca, 30 K. pneumoniae, 5 miscellaneous enteric, 17 S. marcescens, 4
Serratia spp.). Challenge isolates were obtained from BD’s internal collection and
from external laboratories. Results obtained for Challenge isolates using the Phoenix
System were compared to expected MIC results; expected MIC values and
categorical interpretations were derived from testing with multiple lots of reference
broth dilution panels over a three-month period. The challenge set was divided into
subsets and an individual subset was distributed to each of the three study sites.
Identification and expected results were masked to the study sites. The inocula for
the challenge isolates were prepared using both the PhoenixSpec nephelometer
(manual method) and the Phoenix AP (automated method).
The performance evaluation summary of essential and categorical agreement results
for clinical, and challenge isolates with inocula prepared using the PhoenixSpec
nephelometer (manual method) is shown in the Table 4 below:

Essential Agreement (EA) occurs when there is agreement between the result of the
reference method and that of BD Phoenix within plus or minus one serial two-fold
dilution of the antibiotic. Evaluable results are those that are on scale for both the BD
Phoenix panel and the reference method. Category Agreement (CA) occurs when the
interpretation of the result of the reference method agrees exactly with the
interpretation of the BD Phoenix result.
For the clinical and challenge organism testing performed for tigecycline using the BD
Phoenix, the overall % EA and % CA consistently met the acceptance criteria of
greater than or equal to 90%. Overall, there were no major or very major categorical
errors and a total of 23 minor errors, the majority of were in essential agreement.
There were no instances of growth failure with either clinical or challenge isolates.
For challenge isolates two methods of organism suspension standardization were used
in the evaluation of tigecycline with the Phoenix System. Suspensions were prepared
using both the PhoenixSpec nephelometer (manual method) and the Phoenix AP
instrument (automated method). A comparison of the performance of the two
standardization methods is illustrated in Table 6 below.
