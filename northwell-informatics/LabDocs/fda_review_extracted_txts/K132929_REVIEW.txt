The SD GlucoNavii Mentor NFC and SD GlucoNavii Mentor NFC Multi Blood Glucose
Monitoring Systems are over the counter and prescription blood glucose monitoring systems.
The NFC BGMS is indicated for single patient use at home and should not be shared, while
the NFC Multi BGMS is for multi-patient use in a professional healthcare setting, in order to
help monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control.
The meter comes with near field communication (NFC). NFC is a set of standards for smart
devices to establish radio communication with each other by touching them together or
bringing them into close proximity. This function is compatible for test results back-up on
PC or smart devices.
The BGMS comes with one level of SD Glucose Control Solution (Level M previously
cleared in k123517) and SD GlucoMentor Test Strips or SD GlucoMentor Multi Test Strips.
The SD Glucose Control Solutions are used to verify the performance of the SD GlucoNavii
Mentor BGMS. The device comes with a SD Glucose check strip which is used to check the
performance of the meter, before using the meter for the first time, whenever a result does
not agree with the level felt by the patient or if the patient has repeated a test and the blood
glucose result is still lower or higher than expected.

L. Test Principle:
SD GlucoNavii® Mentor NFC and NFC Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems are
electronic devices that utilize the amperometric biosensor technology for measuring the
glucose level in human blood. A drop of blood sample from the finger prick works with
glucose oxidase and the mediators in the test strip to make a small electric current
proportional to the glucose concentration in the blood. The meter reads the current and
displays the blood glucose result equivalent to the current. Within five seconds, the level of
blood glucose will be shown on the digital display screen.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance: Performance testing was conducted on the SD GlucoNavii
Mentor NFC meter as the GlucoNavii Mentor NFC Multi meter is the same meter and
share the same performance. The only difference is in the intended user.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability: Venous blood was spiked with five different glucose concentrations
(30-50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-250, and 251-400mg/dL) and tested on 10 SD
GlucoNavii Mentor NFC meters and 4 lots of test strips. Ten replicates were tested
per meter per glucose concentration. The results from one representative lot are

Intermediate Precision
Intermediate Precision was evaluated using three lots of test strips and ten SD
GlucoNavii NFC meters. Glucose control solutions in three concentration ranges
were used (55-85, 88-132, 264-396mg/dL). For each level of control, ten replicates
were taken each day for ten days, so that 100 individual measurements were
generated per control level. The results from all strip lots are summarized below:

Level 3H 100 332.6 13.2 3.98
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The claimed measuring range for this device is 20-600mg/dL. Linearity was
evaluated using 3 lots of test strips, 5 SD GlucoNavi Mentor NFC meters and 13
venous whole blood samples with the following glucose concentrations: 16.6, 22.1,
54.3, 86.4, 157.5, 227.3, 297.5, 368.3, 438.8, 509.3, 579.3, 649.8 and 719.8mg/dL,
obtained by spiking with glucose solution. Each glucose level was analyzed 5 times
on each meter. The sponsor states that the 5 SD GlucoNavii Mentor NFC meters are
specially designed having an unlimited possible range of measurement; however, will
read Lo for values under 20mg/dL and HI for values greater than 600mg/dL. Linear
regression analysis compared to YSI resulted in the following:
Lot 1: y=1.011x - 1.964; R2=0.999
Lot 2: y=1.006x - 1.202; R2=0.999
Lot 3: y=1.008x - 2.159; R2=0.999
Combined: y=1.009x - 1.775; R2=0.999
The study results support the claimed measuring range of 20-600mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The traceability for the SD GlucoNavii Mentor NFC Blood Glucose Monitoring
system is traceable to the NIST SRM 917b reference material. The method

N. Instrument Name:
SD GlucoNavii® Mentor NFC blood glucose meter
SD GlucoNavii® Mentor NFC Multi blood glucose meter
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings.
The minimal sample volume is 0.3µL.
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,
or mobile device?
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger, palm,
forearm and upper arm. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by
capillary action therefore there are no special handling or storage issues.
5. Calibration:
This is non-coding device therefore no calibration is required by the user.
6. Quality Control:
Each kit comes with SD Glucose Control Solution Level M. The control solution is used
to check that the meter and test strips are working together as a system and that the user is
performing the test correctly. Control solution tests should be performed when a new
box of test strips is opened, the test strip container is left open or the test strips are
11

--- Page 12 ---
damaged, if the strips are left in extreme temperature or humidity, if the patient wants to
check the meter and test strips, whenever the meter is dropped, whenever a result does
not agree with the level felt by the patient or the patient wants to check if they are testing
correctly.
Each system contains a SD Glucose check strip which is used to check the performance
of the meter, before using the meter for the first time, whenever a result does not agree
with the level felt by the patient or if the patient has repeated a test and the blood glucose
result is still lower or higher than expected.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Altitude study: An altitude study was performed at the following 4 different altitudes:
328 feet (100m), 3280 feet (1000m), 6561 feet (2000m) and 11,351feet (3460m) with
venous blood samples with glucose concentrations ranging from 43mg/dL to 352mg/dL.
Each sample was tested in duplicate with 5 meters and one test strip lot and the results
were compared to YSI. The results demonstrate acceptable bias to the reference to
support the claims in the labeling that altitudes up to 11,351 feet have no significant
effect on blood glucose measurements from the GlucoNavii Mentor NFC Monitoring
System.
2. Hematocrit study: The effect of different hematocrit levels were evaluated using
venous whole blood samples with hematocrit levels of 15-65% (15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45,
50, 55, 60, 65%) spiked with three levels of glucose concentrations (60, 150, 350mg/dL).
The samples were tested with 10 meters and three lots of test strips. The results were
compared to YSI and the normal 40% hematocrit. The percent bias of the GlucoNavii
Mentor NFC meters results relative to YSI demonstrated adequate performance to
support the claimed hematocrit range of 20-60%.
3. Infection control studies:
The SD GlucoNavii Mentor NFC meter is intended for single patient use and the SD
GlucoNavii Mentor NFC multi meter is intended for multiple patient use. Disinfection
efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meter by an outside
commercial laboratory testing service to demonstrate complete inactivation of hepatitis B
virus (HBV) with DisCide Ultra Disinfecting Towelettes (EPA Reg. No. 10492-4).
Robustness studies were performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no
change in performance or external materials of the meter after 10,950 cleaning and
10,950 disinfection cycles with DisCide Ultra Disinfecting Towelettes. The robustness
studies were designed to simulate 3 years of multiple-patient use and 5 years of single-
patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning
and disinfection procedures.
4. Sample Volume: A sample volume study was performed using five venous whole blood
samples ranging from 58-240mg/dL to evaluate effect of different sample volumes
(0.1µL, 0.2µL, 0.3µL, 0.4µL, 0.5µL, 0.6µL, 0.8µL, 1.0µL) on the performance of the
12

--- Page 13 ---
device. Results at each sample volume were compared to the corresponding YSI values.
Two lots of test strips and 10 meters were used. Results from these studies support the
claimed sample volume of 0.3µL. The meter displays error message E-2 when an
insufficient amount of blood sample is applied. This error message feature has been
validated.
5. Operating Temperature and Humidity: Temperature and humidity operating
conditions were evaluated using 6 SD GlucoNavii Mentor NFC meters and three lots of
test strips with venous whole blood samples at three glucose concentrations (49.3mg/dL,
110.3mg/dL and 312mg/dL). The meters were exposed to the following temperature and
humidity ranges 50°F/15%RH, 50°F/95%RH, 80°F/15%RH, 80°F/95%RH, 113°F/15%
and 113°F/95%RH. Protocol and acceptance criteria were provided and found to be
acceptable. The results supported the sponsor’s claimed operating temperature from 50°F
to 104°F and relative humidity range from 15% - 95%.
6. Risk Management: The sponsor states that they followed the requirements in
ISO14971:2003 and ISO14971:2007 to assess the risk of their device
7. EMC testing and Electrical Safety Studies: The sponsor provided documentation
certifying that acceptable electromagnetic testing (EMC) had been performed and the
GlucoNavii Mentor NFC and GlucoNavii Mentor NFC Multi were found to be in
compliance.
8. Readability Assessment: A Flesch-Kinkaid reading level assessment was conducted of
the SD GlucoNavii Mentor NFC Blood Glucose Monitoring System User instruction
guide, giving a readability grade level of 7.5.
A Flesch-Kinkaid reading level assessment was conducted of the SD GlucoNavii Mentor
NFC Multi Blood Glucose Monitoring System User instruction guide, giving a
