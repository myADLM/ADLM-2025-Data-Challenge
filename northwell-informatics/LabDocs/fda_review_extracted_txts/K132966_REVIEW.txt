L. Test Principle:
The GluNEOTM Lite / GluNEO™ Lite Professional blood glucose test is based on the
measurement of glucose concentration in human blood. The principle of the test is
based on the reaction between glucose in the blood sample, FAD-Glucose
Dehydrogenase and mediator. The resulting product generates current that is
proportional to the glucose concentration in the sample. The test strip employs an
electrochemical signal generating an electrical current that will stimulate a chemical
reaction. The reaction is measured and displayed by the meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
All performance characteristics were conducted on GluNEO™ Lite Blood Glucose
Monitoring System and GluNEO™ Lite test strips. Testing performed on the
GluNEO™ Lite Blood Glucose Monitoring System and GluNEO™ Lite test strip to
characterize performance of the GluNEO™ Lite Professional Blood Glucose
Monitoring System is adequate since both the GluNEOTM Lite and GluNEOTM Lite
Professional meters and test strips are identical.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Repeatability studies were performed with venous whole blood samples at five
glucose concentrations (44, 83, 125, 208 and 332 mg/dL). Ten runs were
performed on each sample with 10 replicates per strip lot resulting in a total of
100 replicates collected for 3 test strip lots on 4 meters and each glucose level
tested. Results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The sponsor performed linearity studies using adjusted venous blood samples
with14 different glucose concentrations to include the following: 19.8, 28.9, 47.1,
56.2, 65.3, 83.6, 92.7, 165.6, 238.4, 311.3, 384.3, 457.1, 529.9 and 602.8 mg/dL for
the GluNEO™ Lite system.
For each concentration, 15 consecutive tests (with 5 measurements per lot) by
GluNEO™ Lite system and 2 measurements with the YSI 2300 Auto analyzer were
performed respectively. The resulting data was compared and the linear
regression analyses were as follows:
Strip Lot Linear Regressions Slope Y-Intercept R2
Lot. #1 y=0.9804-0.9501 0.9804 -0.9501 0.9996
Lot. #2 y=0.9744-0.4684 0.9744 -0.4684 0.9998
Lot. #3 y=0.9853-0.9116 0.9853 -0.9116 0.9998
Combined y=0.9804-0.7767 0.9804 -0.7767 0.9997
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement
range of 20 – 600 mg/dL.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The GluNEOTM Lite Blood Glucose system is traceable to the NIST SRM 917b
reference material. The method comparison study was performed using the
candidate device and YSI as the reference method. (see section 2.a.)
Test Strip Stability:
The sponsor provided a real-time and accelerated testing protocol and acceptance
criteria to verify the closed- and open- vial stability of the test strips. The
stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable. The sponsor claims a closed-vial (shelf life) of 20 months and open-
vial stability of 3 months when stored at 2-30°C (36-86°F)and 10%- 85% relative
humidity. The labeling instructs the users not to freeze the test strips.
Glucose control value assignment and stability:
The glucose controls are the same as the controls in k091157, except in product
name. Value assignment and stability for these controls can be found in k091157.
The stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable. The sponsor claims a closed-vial (shelf life) of 26 months and an
open-vial stability of 3 months when stored at 8-30°C (46-86 °F).
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range is 20-600 mg/dL. See linearity study in Section M.1.b above.
e. Analytical specificity:
To assess potential interference the sponsor used venous whole blood samples
adjusted to three glucose concentrations of 60 mg/dL and 115 mg/dL and 320
mg/dL. Each of these samples was divided into a test pool and a control pool and
each of the potential endogenous and exogenous interfering substances was added to
the test pool. Each substance was tested at a minimum of two concentrations,
normal/therapeutic and high/toxic concentrations. Each sample was analyzed in
replicates of 5. The % difference between the test sample and the control sample
was calculated. The sponsor defines no significant interference as ≤±10 %
difference relative to the control sample. Results are presented in the table below:

The labeling states the following:
-Acetaminophen, uric acid, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), and other reducing
substances (when occurring in normal or therapeutic concentrations) do not
significantly affect results. However, abnormally high concentration in blood
may cause inaccurately high results.
-Lipemic samples; cholesterol up to 500 mg/dL or triglyceride up to 3000 mg/dL
do not significantly affect the results.
-Samples containing bilirubin up to 30.0 mg/dL, ascorbic acid up to 3.0 mg/dL
and ibuprofen up to 37.5 mg/dL do not significantly affect results.
-Monosaccharide; abnormally high concentration of xylose in blood may
cause inaccurately high results.
-For xylose, a dose response study was conducted on 5 xylose levels (0-20
mg/dL) at three blood glucose concentrations (<60, 150 and >300 mg/dL). It
was determined that the highest level of xylose at which no significant
interference occurs is 10 mg/dL. The labeling contains the following warning:
Do not use during or soon after xylose absorption testing. Xylose will cause
interference.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not Applicable.
2. Comparison
studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To assess system accuracy, results from the GluNEOTM Lite Blood Glucose
Monitoring System were compared to a reference method, YSI 2300.
Fingerstick capillary samples were obtained from 100 participants with
glucose concentrations ranging from 50-400 mg/dL obtained using the
reference method. Trained healthcare professionals at each site collected finger
stick blood from each participant. In addition, in order to obtain sufficient
samples in the lowest and highest concentration intervals, 10 samples were
altered: 5 samples that were < 50mg/dL and 5 samples > 400 mg/dL were

b. Matrix comparison -
To assess matrix affects, capillary blood samples from one hundred participants were
measured for blood glucose using a GluNEOTM Lite system. A healthcare professional
collected the participants’ capillary whole blood into the heparin tube and venous whole
blood into EDTA and sodium heparin anticoagulant tubes. The venous whole blood
with EDTA and sodium heparin were tested with the GluNEOTM lite system by the
healthcare professional and the capillary blood sample with heparin anticoagulant was
measured by the YSI 2300, which is not affected by EDTA and heparin anticoagulant.
All of the samples tested were natural patient samples and were unaltered. Blood
glucose concentrations measured on the reference method ranged from 54 to 390
mg/dL. Testing took place at three different clinical sites using six GluNEOTM Lite
meters and one glucose strip lot. The data analysis and linear regression of the results
are summarized below:

FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this line of product types:
Yes X or No .
The applicant has provided documentation that indicates the device was designed
and developed under good software life-cycle processes.
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied
directly to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger,
palm, thigh upper arm, forearm, thigh and calf, and also venous blood Capillary
whole blood is applied directly to the test strip from the puncture site. Venous
blood is to be collected in a collection tube containing EDTA or heparin
anticoagulant. The tube should be filled to the stated volume. The tube should be
inverted several times immediately after drawing blood and before removing a
sample from the tube for testing. A disposable transfer pipette is used to obtain a
sample from the center of the collection tube. The sample should be used within
30 minutes of collection.
5. Calibration:
The system is designed for auto coding. The meter identifies the specified pre-
coded test strip.
6. Quality Control:
Three levels of aqueous glucose control solutions are available with this system
(Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3). Control solution Level 2 is provided with the kit.
Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling.
An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label.
P. Other Supportive Device and Instrument Information Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above”:
1) Altitude study:
To evaluate the effects of altitude on the GluNEO Lite Glucose Monitoring System a
study was performed to simulate pressure and oxygen changes from altitude
differences. Altered (spiked and glycolyzed) venous blood samples from three
donors were spiked to 9 glucose concentrations (43, 66, 113, 222, 261, 344, 386, 435
and 548 mg/dL). The blood samples were tested using one test strip lot (90 test
strips) and 5 meters at the simulated altitudes which ranged from 0 to 63000 feet (0
19

--- Page 20 ---
to 19215 m) and the results compared to those obtained with the reference method
(YSI). The results demonstrate acceptable bias to the reference to support the claims
in the labeling that altitudes up to 10,000 feet (3048 m) have no significant effect on
blood glucose measurements from the GluNEO™ Lite Blood Glucose Monitoring
System.
2) Hematocrit Study:
Venous samples were collected from 10 donors, centrifuged and divided it into
plasma and red blood cell in order to adjust the hematocrit to obtain the following 5
percentages: 20, 30, 42, 55, and 65%. The concentration of glucose was adjusted in
each hematocrit percentage listed above to the following 10 levels: 30, 43, 70, 121,
182, 250, 375, 450, 495, and 556 mg/dL through either glycolysis or analytical
spiking. Each sample was tested 15 times with the GluNEO™ Lite System. The
plasma serum glucose value of the each levels of sample was measured by YSI
2300 Auto analyzer and the hematocrit of the sample was measured by NOVA
STAT profile and compared to mean of the YSI 2300 analyzer. The % biases
relative to YSI were acceptable within the claimed hematocrit range of 20 - 65%.
3) Sample volume study:
A sample volume study was performed to verify the test strip minimum sample
volume requirement and the test strip fill error requirement established for the
GluNEOTM Lite BGMS. Five glucose concentrations were tested ranging from 43
to 460 mg/dL, as determined by the YSI. Blood at each concentration was applied
to strip at five target sample volumes of 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.8 and 1.0uL. Appropriate
sample volume was determined if the meter results matched the YSI results. The
data shows that sample volume of ≥0.5 μL is the smallest volume to produce
acceptable results.
4) Temperature and humidity study:
Environmental testing was performed in a sealed environmental chamber that can be
controlled for temperature and humidity. Prior to the test, 10 meters and 3 lots of the
test strips were exposed to the following extreme conditions for 1hour:
10℃, RH 10% (lowest temperature / lowest humidity)
40℃, RH 10% (highest temperature / lowest humidity)
10℃, RH 90% (lowest temperature / highest humidity)
40℃, RH 90% (highest temperature / highest humidity)
The results demonstrated that GluNEOTM BGMS can be used at temperatures of
10-40˚C (50-104˚F) and 10-90% relative humidity.

5) Usability Study
As part of the user performance study summarized in section M.2.a above, the
participants were asked to complete a questionnaire to evaluate the ease of use of the
device and the clarity of the English language labeling. Overall the users indicated
that they could successfully perform the test and that the user manual was written
clearly.
6) Readability study
Flesch-Kincaid readability assessment was conducted and the results showed that the
labeling for the GluNEO™ Lite Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems (the user manuals,
the strip inserts and the control inserts of both systems(single patient use and multiple
patient use system) have been evaluated for readability and the results shows that all the
labeling were written at 8th grade level.
7) EMC and electrical safety study
EMC and electrical safety testing were evaluated and certified by the third party
lab. The certificates were provided by the sponsor.
8) Infection control studies
The device systems are intended for single-patient use (GluNEO Lite) and multiple-
patient use (GluNEO Lite Professional)
Robustness:
Cleaning and disinfection can be accomplished by wiping the meter with
CaviwipesTM(EPA Reg. No. 46781-8). The robustness study was conducted and the
results demonstrated that there was no change in performance or in the external
materials of the meter after 10,980 cleaning and disinfection cycles to simulate 3 years
of use for both the single patient and multiple-patient use. Each robustness cycle tested
consisted of one cleaning wipe and one disinfecting wipe.
Disinfection Efficacy test:
Disinfection efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meter by
an outside commercial testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of duck
hepatitis B virus (DHBV) with the chosen disinfectant, CaviwipesTM (EPA Registration
#46781-8. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated
cleaning and disinfection procedures.
