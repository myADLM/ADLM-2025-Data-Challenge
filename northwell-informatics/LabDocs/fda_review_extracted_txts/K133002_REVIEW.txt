the human chorionic gonadotropin molecule. The whole blood or plasma sample is
brought into contact with the sensors allowing the enzyme conjugate to dissolve into the
sample. The hCG within the sample becomes labeled with alkaline phosphatase and is
captured onto the surface of the electrochemical sensor during an incubation period of
approximately seven minutes. The sample, as well as excess enzyme conjugate, is
washed off the sensors. Within the wash fluid is a substrate for the alkaline phosphatase
enzyme. The enzyme bound to the antibody/antigen/antibody sandwich cleaves the
substrate, releasing an electrochemically detectable product. The electrochemical
(amperometric) sensor measures this enzyme product, which is proportional to the
concentration of hCG within the sample. The default setting on the handheld is a display of
the quantitative hCG value as well as a qualitative interpretation of the hCG test result. The
handheld can be customized to disable or enable the qualitative hCG interpretation.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Two separate precision studies were performed at the point of care (POC). In the
first study using spiked lithium heparinized whole blood, all target concentrations
were evaluated at the same three POC sites. In the second study for lithium
heparinized plasma samples, the 5 IU/L target concentration was evaluated at 3
different POC sites compared to the other evaluated plasma concentrations.
Analyses were based on CLSI EP5-A2.
For plasma samples, precision studies were conducted over 5 days on five analyzers,
yielding 25 replicates per sample/level across 3 sites for each concentration level
(total N=75 per sample concentration level). Results are shown in the Table below:
Reproducibility at 3 POC sites for plasma samples:

For whole blood sample evaluations, at each POC site, 21 replicates were tested for
each whole blood sample. The 21 replicates included 3 replicates for each of 7
analyzers at each POC site. Results are shown below:

All blood or plasma sample results with a measured hCG concentration < 5 IU/L will
be reported as “<5 IU/L” by the test system.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity study:
A study was performed to demonstrate that the i-STAT Total β-hCG assay is linear
across the claimed measuring interval of 5.0 IU/L to 2000.0 IU/L. Lithium
heparinized whole blood and plasma samples from 6 donors were spiked with a
primary spiking solution prepared from WHO 5th IS (07/364). Nine hCG
levels/samples with concentrations well-distributed across the range (from 4.9 IU/L to
>2000 IU/L) were prepared by admixing according to recommendations in CLSI
EP06-A. Replicate samples (N≥10) were tested on multiple i-STAT 1 Analyzers.
Analyses demonstrated linearity across the claimed measuring interval of 5.0 IU/L to
2000.0 IU/L. The linear regression analysis results are:
Whole blood: y=1.04x+0.69, r=0.9901
Plasma: y=0.92x-0.35, r=0.9929
Recovery study
A dilution recovery study was performed using lithium heparinized whole blood and
plasma samples from six donors. Each donor sample was then mixed with a primary
spiking solution prepared from WHO 5th IS (07/364) to prepare 9 levels of samples,
which were then tested on at least ten assay cartridges. Percent recovery or absolute
bias was calculated at each level as shown below:

For whole blood samples with hCG concentrations >5 IU/L, the individual %
recovery ranged from 91.1% to 118.5%, and for plasma samples from 81.8% to
103.3% when compared to WHO hCG 5th IS. For whole blood samples with hCG at a
concentration of ~5 IU/L, the individual bias ranged from 0.3 to 1.1 IU/L, and for
plasma samples from -0.2 to -1.2 IU/L, when compared to WHO hCG 5th IS.
The sponsor has a limitation in their labeling that states
“End-users may obtain individual results with >15% negative bias for plasma samples
when hCG concentrations are > 5 IU/L”.
Hook effect evaluation:
The assay was evaluated for high dose hook effect in lithium heparinized plasma and
whole blood samples. Samples were spiked to high levels of hCG using
commercially available hCG. Each sample was diluted into the measuring interval of
the i-STAT Total β-hCG assay and results were multiplied by the dilution factor in
order to assign the actual concentration of the sample being tested. Seven samples
with hCG levels ranging from 100,000 to >600,000 IU/L were evaluated.
The Sponsor defines a sample unaffected by hook as a sample that produced a signal
greater than the signal produced by a sample at 2000 IU/L (such that the i-STAT
Analyzer would indicate a result of “> 2000.0 IU/L”). Plasma samples with hCG
concentrations up to 450,000 IU/L showed no hook effect. Whole blood samples with
hCG concentrations up to 650,000 IU/L showed no hook effect.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The measurands in the Controls and Calibration Verification Materials are traceable
to the WHO 5th International Standard (NIBSC Code 07/364). The traceability
process is based on EN ISO17511.
Stability and Value Assignment:
Stability and value assignment of Controls and Calibration Verification Materials was
previously reviewed under k121237. Control materials have target concentrations of
25, 1000, and 1500 IU/L. Calibration Verification Materials have target
concentrations of 3, 1000, and 2000 IU/L.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation
(LoQ) were determined in accordance with CLSI document EP17-A2. The LoB
study was performed by measuring 195 replicates of one blank lithium heparin
plasma pool and 144 replicates of one blank lithium heparin whole blood sample pool
over five days with 2 reagent lots. The LoD study was performed by measuring 192
replicates of 4 low concentration lithium heparin plasma samples and 182 replicates
of 6 low concentration lithium heparin whole blood samples over 5 days with 2
7

--- Page 8 ---
reagent lots. The LoQ study was performed by measuring 155 replicates of 4 low
concentration lithium heparin plasma samples and 92 replicates of 6 low
concentration lithium heparin whole blood samples over 6 days with 2 reagent lots.
The results demonstrated LoB < LoD ≤ LoQ < 5.0 IU/L. Recovery at the claimed
lower assay limit of 5 IU/L is shown above in section M.1.b. and summarized below:
Sample Type Bias
Lithium Heparinized Plasma -0.2 to -1.2 IU/L
Lithium Heparinized Whole Blood 0.3 to 1.1 IU/L
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference:
Following CLSI guideline EP07-A2, potential exogenous and endogenous
interferents were spiked into both lithium heparinized whole blood and lithium
heparinized plasma with various hCG concentrations including hCG concentrations
near decision limits. Measured hCG concentrations in the presence of interferent
were compared to measured hCG concentrations in control samples without
interferent, and recoveries were determined. The following compounds were tested
at the concentrations shown below. No interference was observed. All recoveries in
the presence of the compounds shown below were within +/- 10% (the criterion
defined by the Sponsor).

Specificity:
Assay specificity was determined by testing hCG spiked lithium heparinized whole
blood and heparinized plasma samples in the presence of LH (450 IU/L), FSH (300
IU/L) , and TSH (100 mIU/L), and comparing test results to hCG samples in the
absence of these additional hormones. Recoveries were all within +/- 10% (criteria
defined by the Sponsor).
Hematocrit (HCT):
The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated using hCG levels in whole
blood samples (20-30 IU/L and 1200-1500 IU/L) with hematocrit levels falling in one
of four bins: Zero (plasma), Low (25% – 35%), Nominal (36% – 43%), and High
(44% - 51%). The labeling indicates that imprecision (CV) and bias exceeding 10%
have been observed in samples with HCT > 50%PCV (packed cell volume).
f. Assay cut-off:
See detection limit above (M.1.d.).
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison study was done in accordance with the CLSI guideline
EP09-A2. The measurements were obtained at four external POC sites, where
whole blood samples were collected and immediately tested in duplicate with the
candidate device. The collection tubes were then transferred to the hospital
laboratory. The plasma portion was separated from the red cells and the plasma
portion of each sample was tested in duplicate with both the candidate and the
predicate devices. Testing was performed by 6-8 operators at each POC site. Each
sample was tested with a minimum of two lots of i-STAT Total β-hCG cartridges
and six i-STAT 1 Analyzers were used at each POC site.
The analyses of the first measurements of the whole blood (candidate device), plasma
(candidate device) vs plasma (predicate) from all sites are shown below:
