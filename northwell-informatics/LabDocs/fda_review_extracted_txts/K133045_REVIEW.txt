L. Test Principle:
The glucose measurement is based on electrical potential caused by the reaction of
glucose with the reagents contained on the strip’s electrodes. The glucose in the
sample is oxidized by the enzyme glucose oxidase, and the current resulting from this
enzymatic reaction is measured and converted to glucose concentration by the meter.
The magnitude of the current is proportional to the concentration of glucose in the
sample.

data was compared and the linear regression analyses were as follows:
Lot 1: y = 1.0029x -2.106, R² = 0.9997
Lot 2: y = 0.9999x -1.863, R² = 0.9997
Lot 3: y = 1.0036x -1.816, R² = 0.9996
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement
range of 20 – 600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The Element Lite Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to the NIST
SRM 917b reference material. The reference instrument used is the YSI 2300
Glucose analyzer and it is calibrated by YSI 2747 Glucose Standard which is
a NIST traceable glucose standard.
Test Strip Stability:
The sponsor provided real-time and accelerated studies to verify the closed-
and open- vial stability of the test strips. The stability studies were reviewed
and found to be acceptable. The closed-vial claim is 24 months when stored at
36-86°F at 20 -60 % relative humidity. The open-vial stability claim is 3
months when stored at 36-86°F at 20-60 % relative humidity. The test strips
should not be frozen.
Control Solution Value Assignment and Stability:
The control solutions were previously cleared and stability and value
assignment was previously established in k113670. The controls are prepared
at three target concentrations gravimetrically and the glucose concentrations
are verified with the YSI reference method. The expected values are verified
for each new lot of strips. The brand name of the glucose control solution has
been updated to Element Lite Blood Glucose Monitoring Solution. The
control solution can be stored once opened for up to three months at 46-86°F.
The closed vial claim is 24 months from the manufactured date when stored at
46-86F°.
d. Detection limit:
See linearity study in Section M1b above.
e. Analytical specificity:
To assess potential interference the sponsor used venous whole blood samples
adjusted to three glucose concentrations of 60 mg/dL and 115 mg/dL and 320

mg/dL. Each of these samples was divided into a test pool and a control pool
and each of the potential endogenous and exogenous interfering substances
was added to the test pool. Each substance was tested at a minimum of two
concentrations, normal/therapeutic and high/toxic concentrations. Each
sample was analyzed in replicates of 5. The % difference between the test
sample and the control sample was calculated. The results are summarized
below:
Potential Interfering Concentration at which no
Substance significant interference is
observed (mg/dL) (typical

Acetaminophen 20
Ascorbic acid 6
Bilirubin 40
Cholesterol 500
Creatinine 5
Dopamine 0.09

The following interference warnings are included in the labeling:
· Interferences: Acetaminophen, uric acid, ascorbic acid (vitamin C),
and other reducing substances (when occurring in normal blood or
normal therapeutic concentrations) do not significantly affect results.
However, abnormally high concentrations in blood may cause
inaccurately high results.
· Lipemic samples: Cholesterol up to 500 mg/dL or triglyceride up to
3000 mg/dL do not significantly affect the results. Values beyond
these levels should be interpreted with caution.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A user performance study was performed to compare the lay user self-test results
to the YSI method. The study was performed at three clinical sites and all
participants were given the user manual in English with no further information or
coaching provided. Participants were then asked to perform testing using the
glucose meter. 150 participants performed testing by taking samples from the
fingertip, dorsal hand, forearm, and calf. 170 participants performed testing by
taking samples from the ventral palm, upper arm, and thigh. A technician then
collected capillary blood from each participant for measurement on YSI. The
range of glucose values tested was 58-519 mg/dL. Three test strip lots were tested
in the study. Participant results using the meter were compared to YSI and are
summarized by sample site below:

2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development
processes for this line of product types:
Yes X or No ________.
The applicant has provided documentation that indicates the device was
designed and developed under good software life-cycle processes.
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied
directly to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger
ventral palm, dorsal hand, upper arm, forearm, calf and thigh. The whole blood
sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.
5. Calibration:
The meter is autocoded, therefore no coding is required by the user. The coding
circuit printed on the test strip is consistent with the code in the meter and the
meter detects the code of the strip.
6. Quality Control:
Three levels of aqueous glucose control solutions are available with this system
(Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3). Control solution Level 2 is provided with the
kit. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial
label. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in
the labeling and what the user should do if the control result falls outside these
ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not
Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1) Hematocrit Study:
Venous blood samples were obtained, centrifuged, and divided into plasma and
red blood cells in order to adjust the hematocrit to obtain the following 5
percentage: 20%, 30%, 42%, 50%, 60%. The concentration of glucose was
adjusted in each hematocrit percentage to the following 10 levels: 23, 42, 70,
116, 175, 256, 372, 441, 513, 550 mg/dL through either glycolysis or analytical
spiking. Each sample was tested 15 times using 15 different Element Lite Blood
Glucose Monitoring Systems. The plasma glucose value of sample was
measured by YSI 2300 analyzer and the hematocrit of the sample was measured
by NOVA STAT profile. The % biases relative to YSI were acceptable within
the claimed hematocrit range of 20 - 60%.

2) Altitude study:
To evaluate the effects of altitude on the Element Lite Blood Glucose Monitoring
System, 1 test strip lot was tested on 5 meters using venous from 18 donors that
was spiked or glycolized to nine glucose concentrations (41, 64, 115, 226, 264,
355, 406, 449, 501 mg/dL). The samples were tested at 10,000 feet in an altitude
chamber which adjusts both pO2 level and pressure, and at sea level (0 feet) as a
control. Results obtained were compared with those obtained with the reference
method (YSI). The results demonstrate acceptable bias to the reference to support
the claims in the labeling that altitudes up to 10,000 feet have no significant effect
on blood glucose measurements from the BGMS.
3) Sample volume study:
The sponsor performed a study to verify the minimum test strip sample volume
requirement for the Element Lite Blood Glucose Meter. Blood samples were
tested at four sample volumes (0.25, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5), using five concentrations
of adjusted and unaltered blood samples (39, 65, 131, 254, and 461 mg/dL) and
values obtained were compared to YSI values. Results support the claimed
minimum sample volume of 0.3µL
4) Temperature and humidity studies:
Temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated for temperatures
ranging from 50-104˚F (10-40˚C) and relative humidity from 10% to 90% in the
following combinations
10℃, RH 10% (lowest temperature / lowest humidity)
40℃, RH 10% (highest temperature / lowest humidity)
10℃, RH 90% (lowest temperature / highest humidity)
40℃, RH 90% (highest temperature / highest humidity)
Protocol and acceptance criteria were provided and found to be acceptable. The
results supported the Sponsor’s claimed operating temperature from 50-104˚F and
relative humidity range from 10% to 90%.
5) Infection Control Studies:
The Element Lite Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for single-
patient use only. CaviWipesTM Disinfecting Towelettes with EPA registration
number 46781-8 were validated demonstrating complete inactivation of live virus
for use with the meter. The sponsor also demonstrated that there was no change
in performance or in the external materials of the meter after 1,095 cleaning and
disinfection cycles (one cycle includes one cleaning wipe plus one disinfecting
wipe) to simulate cleaning and disinfecting once per day for 3 years of single-
patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated
cleaning and disinfection procedures.
6) EMC testing: The subject device is the same as the predicate device, ElementTM
Blood Glucose Monitoring System (k113670), in rated current and PCB structure.
Electromagnetic compatibility and electrical safety were established in k113670.
