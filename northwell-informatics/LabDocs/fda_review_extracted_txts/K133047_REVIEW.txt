that involves energy transfer between an acceptor fluorophore labeled to an antibody and a
donor fluorophore labeled to drug. The assay is based on competition between drug in the
sample and drug labeled with the donor fluorophore for a fixed number of binding sites on
the antibody reagent. When acceptor and donor fluorophores are brought into close proximity
through a binding event, energy transfer occurs. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer
(FRET) signal is measured at the wavelength of the acceptor fluorophore following
excitation of the donor and is inversely proportional to the amount of drug in the sample. A
Cutoff Calibrator is used to translate the sample measurement into a positive or negative
result. Controls are used to monitor the precision and accuracy of the assay.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Three lots of the RapidFRET MDMA were analyzed, four times daily, for a minimum
of 20 days. Negative oral fluid pools were spiked with MDMA at 0%, 25%, 50%,
75%, 100%, 125%, 150%, 175% and 200% of the cutoff level of 50 ng/mL and were
processed through the RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collection device. Oral fluid spikes
were derived from NIST weight traceable standards and confirmed for drug levels
using quantitative methods including GC/MS or LC/MS/MS.
The percentage of negative and positive results was consistent across the three lots
tested. Representative data from one lot is summarized below. Precision data from
this lot was collected over 36 days total with 24 data collection days. Two
professional laboratory operators were used to collect this data.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. This is a qualitative assay.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability – Calibrators and Controls
Calibrators and controls are ready-to-use synthetic oral fluid solutions. The cutoff
calibrator and controls are prepared by spiking known concentrations of MDMA into
synthetic oral fluid to obtain the cutoff level calibrator, and the positive and negative
controls. The negative calibrator is drug free synthetic oral fluid.
Calibrators and controls are prepared from (±)-3,4- methylenedioxymethamphetamine

(1 mg/mL in methanol) commercial primary standards from a vendor that uses NIST
traceable weights and specific assays, such as HPLC and GC/MS, to confirm drug
levels.
Stability - Calibrators and Controls
Real-time stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be
acceptable. The shelf life (closed-vial) claim for the calibrators and controls is 12
months when stored at 2 - 8°C. The opened-vial claim for the calibrators and controls
is 30 days when stored at 2 - 8°C.
Value Assignment – Calibrators and Controls
Calibrator and Control lots are value assigned during the manufacturing process in
two steps. First, following bottling and labeling, new lots are assayed against at least
one previously accepted, released and unexpired Calibrator and Control lot using
RapidFRET reagents. Results are qualitatively evaluated for performance relative to
the previously accepted lots. Second, each new manufactured lot of Calibrator (Cutoff
only) or Control (POS and NEG) is quantitatively confirmed by mass spectrometry
(MS)-based method for target analyte concentration. Protocols and acceptance criteria
were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
Sample Shipping - Stability Study
Neat oral fluid pool was spiked with MDMA to 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, 125%,
150%, 175% and 200% of the cutoff. Each spike was subsequently processed through
a RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collection device to mimic actual collection process.
Aliquots were stored and handled according to the collector insert. Samples were
shipped multiple times at ambient temperature from California to Maine and back to
California. Samples were assayed using the RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for MDMA
before and after each shipment. At various time points, aliquots were reserved and
analyzed quantitatively by a MS-based method. The physical integrity of the
RapidEASE sample tube was also evaluated following each shipment.
During the 17-day study, temperature ranged from approximately 4 - 30 ºC and
relative humidity range between 7% and 100%. The percent change vs. Day 1 (before
shipping) ranged from 97.9% to 106.3%. No signs of sample tube degradation or
performance loss were noted during the study. The data support the sponsor’s claimed
shipping stability of up to 7 days.
Sample Stability Study
Oral fluid samples with MDMA from 0 to approximately 200% of the cutoff were
prepared in approximately 25% increments and processed through RapidEASE oral
fluid collection devices. Samples were stored under various conditions including
room temperature, refrigerated (2 – 8 ºC) and frozen (-10 to -25 ºC). Samples were
6

--- Page 7 ---
periodically removed and analyzed by RapidFRET and mass spectrometry. For each
storage condition two sets of spikes of 9 levels each were prepared and analyzed in
tandem.
Recovery for samples stored at room temperature ranged from 95.4% to 100.2%.
Recovery for refrigerated samples ranged from 95.0% to 103.7%, and for frozen
samples ranged from 103.5% to 110.4%. Samples are stable for up to 7 days at room
temperature, up to 21 days at 2 – 8 °C, and up to six months at -10 to -25 °C.
Sample Recovery Study
Recovery studies were conducted by aliquoting neat, human oral fluid pool into glass
tubes and spiking with MDMA to achieve concentrations ranging from 0 to 200% of
cutoff (100ng/mL) in 5 replicates for each level in 25% (12.5 ng/mL) increments.
Approximately half of the volume of each of these ‘PRE-RapidEASE’ samples was
then removed and processed through a new RapidEASE Oral Fluid collector,
mimicking as close as possible actual collection protocol, resulting in a ‘POST-
RapidEASE’ sample. Both the PRE-RapidEASE and POST-RapidEASE for each
spike level was confirmed for MDMA concentration by mass spectrometry.
Recoveries from individual samples ranged from 93.2% to 108.3%. Average spike
recovery at each level ranged from 95.6% to 101.7%. Average results are summarized
in the table below:

The samples were randomized and blinded to the instrument operator and assayed
using the RapidFRET MDMA assay and gas chromatography mass spectrometry
(GC/MS). A total of 308 samples were analyzed for MDMA content and the results
are summarized below:
Negative by the Near Cutoff Near Cutoff High Positive
predicate Negative Positive (greater than
device or less (Between 50% (Between the 50% above the
than half the below the cutoff and 50% cutoff
