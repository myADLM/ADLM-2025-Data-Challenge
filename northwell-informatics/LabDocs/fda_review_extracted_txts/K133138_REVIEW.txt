SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification
Decision Summary
To: Becton, Dickinson and Company RE: K133138
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own
Class I device requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable
1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device:
Trade Name: BD Veritor™ System Flu A+B assay
510(k) number: k120049, k121797, k132256
2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in
its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for
use, package labeling.
3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S). The modification presented in this 510(k) consisted
of adding a procedure for using the obtained clinical specimen to run the BD Veritor™
System RSV assay in addition to the Flu A+B assay, both assays will be performed
separately, but using a single specimen, nasopharyngeal aspirate/wash or nasopharyngeal
swab in transport media. The following text and accompanying diagrams were added to the
package insert:
ALTERNATIVE TEST PROCEDURE
USE OF BD VERITOR SYSTEM FOR RAPID DETECTION OF INFLUENZA A+B (CAT# 256041 ) AND BD VERITOR SYSTEM FOR
RAPID DETECTION OF RSV (CAT# 256042) FROM A SINGLE NP WASH, ASPIRATE OR SWAB SPECIMEN IN TRANSPORT
MEDIA
USE THIS PROCEDURE IF BOTH INFLUENZA A+B AND RSV ARE TO BE TESTED FROM A SINGLE PATIENT
IMPORTANT NOTE: THE SAMPLE TO BE TESTED IN THE RSV KIT MUST BE FROM A PATIENT LESS THAN 20 YEARS OF AGE
AS INDICATED IN THE BD VERITOR RSV CLINICAL KIT PACKAGE INSERT. THE PROCESSED SAMPLE SHOULD BE TESTED
WITHIN 15 MINUTES.
NOTES: Reagents, specimens and devices must be at room temperature (15–30°C) for testing. Thoroughly mix all specimens
prior to removal of an aliquot for processing. Do not centrifuge specimens.
Note: The BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of RSV (CAT #256042) is required for this procedure.
1. For each patient specimen and control swab,
remove one RV Reagent C tube/tip and one
BD Veritor System Flu A+B device and one BD
Veritor System RSV from its foil pouch
immediately before testing.
2. Label the BD Veritor System devices and one
RV Reagent C tube for each specimen and
control to be tested.
3. Place the labeled RV Reagent C tube(s) in the
designated area of the tube rack.
4. Vortex or thoroughly mix specimen. Do not
centrifuge.
5. 2. Remove and discard the cap from the RV
Reagent C tube corresponding to the sample
to be tested.

6. Using the transfer pipette, transfer 300 μL of
specimen into the RV Reagent C tube. Discard
pipette after use.
7. Press the attached tip firmly onto the RV
Reagent C tube containing the processed
specimen or control (threading/twisting not
required).
NOTE: Do not use tips from any other product,
including other products from BD or other
manufacturers.
8. Vortex or mix thoroughly.
9. Invert the RV Reagent C tube and hold the
tube vertically (approximately one inch above
the BD Veritor System Flu A+B device sample
well). Holding the tube at the ridged area,
squeeze gently allowing three (3) drops of the
processed sample to be dispensed into the
sample well of the appropriately labeled BD
Veritor System Flu A+B device.
NOTE: Squeezing the tube too close to the tip may
cause leakage.
10. Immediately continue to test for RSV. Invert
the RV Reagent C tube and hold the tube
vertically (approximately one inch above the
BD Veritor System RSV device sample well).
Holding the tube at the ridged area, squeeze
gently allowing three (3) drops of the
processed sample to be dispensed into the
sample well of the appropriately labeled BD
Veritor System RSV device.
NOTE: Squeezing the tube too close to the tip may
cause leakage.
11. After adding the sample, allow the tests to run
for 10 minutes before inserting into the
reader.
12. When the test is ready, insert the BD Veritor
System Flu A+B device into the BD Veritor
System Reader. (The BD Veritor System
Reader should be powered-on prior to use
and will indicate when it is ready for insertion
of the BD Veritor System device.)
Follow the reader on-screen prompts to complete the
procedure and obtain the test result
13. Immediately after the Flu A+B result is
obtained and recorded, insert the BD Veritor
System RSV device into the BD Veritor System
Reader.
Follow the reader on-screen prompts to complete the
procedure and obtain the test result

assay
Intended Use The BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Same.
Detection of Flu A+B is a rapid
chromatographic immunoassay for the
direct and qualitative detection of
influenza A and B viral nucleoprotein
antigens from nasopharyngeal wash,
aspirate, and swab in transport media
samples from symptomatic patients. The
BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection
of Flu A+B is a differentiated test, such
that influenza A viral antigens can be
distinguished from influenza B viral
antigens from a single processed sample
using a single device. The test is to be
used as an aid in the diagnosis of
influenza A and B viral infections. A
negative test is presumptive and it is
recommended that these results be
confirmed by viral culture or an FDA-
cleared influenza A and B molecular
assay. Negative test results do not
preclude influenza viral infection and
should not be used as the sole basis for
treatment or other patient management
decisions. The test is not intended to
detect influenza C antigens.
Performance characteristics for influenza
A and B nasopharyngeal (NP)
washes/aspirates were established
during January through March of 2011
when influenza viruses A/2009 H1N1,
A/H3N2, B/Victoria lineage, and
B/Yamagata lineage were the
predominant influenza viruses in
circulation according to the Morbidity and
Mortality Weekly Report from the CDC
entitled “Update: Influenza Activity—
United States, 2010-2011 Season, and
Composition of the 2011-2012 Influenza
Vaccine.” Performance characteristics
may vary against other emerging
influenza viruses.

If infection with a novel influenza virus is
suspected based on current clinical and
epidemiological screening criteria
recommended by public health
authorities, specimens should be
collected with appropriate infection
control precautions for novel virulent
influenza viruses and sent to the state or
local health department for testing. Virus
culture should not be attempted in these
cases unless a BSL 3+ facility is available
to receive and culture specimens.

The package insert has been updated to include an additional procedure for using the

1. The manufacturing facility is in conformance with design control procedure requirements as
specified in 21 CFR 820.30 and the records are available for review.
2. The validation activities, as required by the risk analysis, for the modification were performed by
the designated individuals and the results demonstrated that the predetermined acceptance
criteria were met.
In conclusion, based on the results of the analytical reactivity testing the modified labeling is truthful
and accurate. The changes do not affect the performance of the test and it is therefore substantially
equivalent to the current cleared test.
7. A Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary, and the Indications for
Use Enclosure.
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended
use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the
particular modification and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices
demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. On this basis, I
recommend the device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.
