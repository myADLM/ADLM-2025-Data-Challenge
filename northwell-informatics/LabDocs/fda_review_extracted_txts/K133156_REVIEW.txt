L. Test Principle:
The ADVIA Centaur Vitamin D Total assay is a one-pass 18 minute competitive
immunoassay that uses an anti-fluorescein labeled (FITC) monoclonal antibody
covalently bound to paramagnetic particles (PMP), one monoclonal antibody labeled
with acridium ester (AE), and a vitamin D analog labeled with fluorescein. An inverse
relationship exists between the amount of vitamin D present in the patient sample and the
amount of relative light units (RLUs) detected by the system.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within run and total imprecision were evaluated by testing two natural patient serum
samples and four Medical Decision Pools (MDP) which consisted of 25 (OH) vitamin
D spiked into human serum sample pools. Each sample was assayed in 2 replicates
per run, 2 runs per day for 20 days for a total of 80 replicates. Testing was performed
with two reagent lots on two analyzers. The precision results from a representative
reagent lot are summarized below:
Within Run Total
Sample N Mean SD %CV SD %CV

vitamin D value of 22 ng/mL spiked with 25 (OH) vitamin D to obtain a 25 (OH)
3
vitamin D total value of approximately 180 ng/mL, and a low sample which was
prepared by acid treating human serum followed by the addition of charcoal and
centrifugation then spiked with low level 25(OH) vitamin D3 near the LoD of the
assay. The high serum sample and the low sample were combined in different ratios
to produce 9 dilutions covering the assay range. The dilutions were run in replicates
of 3 on a single analyzer using 1 lot of reagent. Linearity was evaluated by
calculating a linear regression comparing observed values versus expected values.
Results of the percent recovery of all the samples are summarized below:

A weighted least squares linear regression analysis resulted in the following equation:
y=0.99x + 0.04 r=0.999
The sponsor claims a measuring range of 4.2-150 ng/mL for the ADVIA Centaur
Vitamin D assay.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Standardization and Traceability
The Siemens ADVIA Centaur Vitamin D Total was originally cleared under 510(k)
k110586. Siemens has modified the assay by standardizing the cleared vitamin D
assay in accordance with the Vitamin D Standardization Program (VDSP).The VDSP
is an international collaborative effort to standardize the laboratory measurement of
serum 25-OH vitamin D This collaboration involves the coordinated efforts of the
National Institutes of Health, Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS), the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes for Standards and
Technology (NIST), Ghent University, and other institutions. Please refer to
http://ods.od.nih.gov/Research/VitaminD.aspx for more information on the VDSP
program.

To achieve standardization against the VDSP recognized Reference Measurement
Procedure (RMP), one hundred and seventy unique serum samples were obtained
with 25 (OH) vitamin D values assigned using the University of Ghent’s ID-
LC/MS/MS 25 (OH) vitamin D Reference Measurement Procedure (RMP). The
values ranged from 5 to 100 ng/mL. Using these samples, a set of 10 standards have
been manufactured whose values have been assigned by method correlation to the
RMP. This value assignment has aligned the candidate device to the RMP. The
RMP is traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Standard
Reference Material 2972.
The relationship between the ADVIA Centaur VitD Assay and ID-LC/MS/MS 25-OH
vitamin D RMP is described using Deming regression:
y=0.99 x + 0.53 ng/mL, r=0.96
The ADVIA Centaur Vitamin D Total assay (candidate device) has passed the
certification process for the CDC VDSP and a certificate has been provided by the
CDC. Please see the certification process at http://www.cdc.gov/labstandards/hs.html.
Value assignment:
The ADVIA Centaur VitD calibrators, controls, and master curve verifier have been
previously cleared in k110586. There are no reagent or material changes for the
calibrators, controls, and master curve verifier, just a change in the traceability.
Calibrators, 2-level controls (Level 1: 20 ng/mL and Level 2: 100 ng/ml) and MCMs are
traceable to internal standards, which are traceable to the Ghent University ID-LC-
MS/MS. The internal standards were value assigned via method correlation using clinical
samples with the Ghent University ID-LC/MS/MS assigned values.
Production lots of calibrators, controls and master curve materials (MCM) are value
assigned against the internal standards using two reagent lots, 2 runs on two different
instruments for a total of 24 replicates. The average dose for each calibrator, control and
MCM assigns their value.
Stability:
Shelf life stability studies: Real-time stability studies were performed for the control
materials, MCM and the calibrators. The stability study protocol and the acceptance
criteria have been reviewed and found to be acceptable. The real time ongoing stability
study supports a stability of 26 weeks (6 months) when materials are stored at 2-8o C.
Open vial stability: The stability study protocol and the acceptance criteria to determine
open-vial stability of the control materials, calibrators, and the MCMs have been
reviewed and found to be acceptable. Controls, calibrators, and MCMs are stable for up
to 120 days when stored at -20o C, 28 days when stored at 2-8o C, and up to 7 days
stability when stored at 25o C.

d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and the limit of quantitation (LoQ)
were determined following CLSI Document EP17-A2 guidelines. The LoD is
defined as the lowest concentration of 25 (OH) vitamin D that can be detected with
95% probability. LoB was performed using 5 treated human serum samples and LoD
was performed using 6 low serum samples. All samples were assayed with 4
replicates per run, 2 runs per day, for over 5 days, over 2 lots of reagent and on 2
analyzers. LoQ was determined using 6 low human samples (25(OH) vitamin D total
values 1.4 to 13 ng/mL), over 4 days, 2 runs per day, 4 replicates, using 2 lots of
reagent on 1 analyzer for a total of 40 replicates per sample. LoQ was defined as the
lowest concentration with an inter-assay precision of ≤20% CV.
The LoB, LoD and LoQ are summarized below:
LoB LoD LoQ
1.7 ng/mL 3.2 ng/mL 4.2 ng/mL
The ADVIA vitamin D assay has a measuring range of 4.2 to 150 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
See k110586
An additional interferent, Fluorescein, was detected since k110586 was cleared.
An interference study was conducted by the sponsor to characterize the interference
with sodium fluorescein in two steps, which includes an initial screening step and a
dose response confirmation step. At the first step, sodium fluorescein was spiked into
a serum sample with a 25(OH) vitamin D concentration of approximately 22 ng/mL
at the following levels: 250 mcg/mL, 2.5 mcg/mL, 0.025 mcg/mL and 0.00025
mcg/mL. The samples were tested in triplicate on the ADVIA Centaur XP. The
spiked samples were compared to the unspiked samples. Fluorescein interference
was seen at fluorescein levels of 250 mcg/mL and 2.5mcg/mL.
To more accurately determine the level of fluorescein that would no longer interfere
with the assay, a dose response testing was performed. Sodium fluorescein was
spiked into 2 serum pools with a 25(OH) vitamin D concentration of approximately
25 ng/mL and 49 ng/mL at serially diluted levels: 3.13, 1.56, 0.78, 0.39, 0.20, and
0.10 mcg/mL. These samples were tested along with control samples which did not
contain fluorescein. The sponsor defined non-significant interference as the level of
fluorescein that will result in ≤ 10% bias. The results of the study are summarized in
the table below:

0.10 52.7 7%
The sponsor concluded that the study demonstrated that at a sodium fluorescein level
of ≥ 0.10 mcg/mL will cause significant interference.
The following limitation statement has been added to the labeling:
“Do not use samples which contain fluorescein. Fluorescein levels > 0.10 µg/mL can
produce falsely elevated results in this assay. Interference testing with varying levels
of sodium fluorescein as high as 3.13 ug/mL at clinically relevant concentrations
of 25(OH) vitamin D (~ 25 – 50 ng/mL) can result in 25(OH) vitamin D
concentrations to be greater than 150 ng/mL. Evidence suggests that patients
undergoing retinal fluorescein angiography can retain amounts of fluorescein in the
body for up to 48 to 72 hours post-treatment. In the cases of patients with renal
insufficiency, including many diabetics, retention could be much longer. Such
samples can produce falsely elevated values when tested with this assay, and should
not be tested. *”

A method comparison study was performed to compare the modified (standardized)
ADVIA Centaur Vitamin D assay (candidate device) to the non-standardized ADVIA
Centaur Vitamin D assay (predicate device), one hundred and seventy-seven native
human serum samples with 25 (OH) vitamin D values ranging from 5.0 ng/ml to
140.0 ng/mL were assayed in singlicate using one reagent lot of the candidate device
and predicate device. Deming regression was used for the regression analysis and the
results are summarized below:
y= 0.78x + 3.34, r=0.99
The slope showed an approximate bias of -22% between the candidate device and the
predicate device; however, this shift is expected because the purpose of the device
modification was to adjust the calibration to better align with the VDSP reference
sample concentration target levels. Therefore, test results from the candidate device
do not, and are not expected to, directly correlate with test results from the predicate
device. Laboratories that use the ADVIA Centaur Vitamin D assay should be aware
of the significantly different performance of the modified assay.
An additional method comparison study was conducted to evaluate the accuracy
between the candidate device and the RMP, University of Ghent’s ID-LC/MS/MS
method. The method comparison against the RMP was the basis of the substantial
equivalence determination.
A method comparison study was performed to compare the 25-OH vitamin D
concentrations of serum samples using the candidate device and the University of
Ghent ID-LC/MS/MS 25-OH vitamin D Reference Measurement Procedure (RMP).
One hundred and twenty-two independent serum samples, composed of 116 native and
6 spiked samples, with RMP assigned concentrations ranging from 7.8 ng/mL to 148.1
ng/mL were assayed in a singlicate using one lot of the candidate device. Deming
regression was used for the regression analysis and results are summarized below:
y= 0.93x + 2.89, r=0.99
Results correlate well around medical decision range of 10 to 30 ng/mL; however
results above 50 ng/mL starts to show some scatter. However, the scatter in that part
of the assay range is clinically insignificant.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Expected Values for Adults:
A reference range study was conducted using adult subjects aged between 21 to 93 years.
Samples from 291 apparently healthy adults from the North and South of the U.S. were
tested. These samples were collected during different seasons (summer and winter). The
samples numbers were split evenly between the North and South, summer and winter,
and with and without supplements containing vitamin D. Samples were only included in
this study if the samples had normal PTH, TSH, and calcium values. Based on the 95%
confidence interval, the following values were established following CLSI guideline
C28-A2.
Median 25(OH) vitamin D Observed Range (2.5th to 97.5th percentile)
22.5 ng/L 7.4 to 44.0 ng/mL
Expected Values for Pediatric patients:
A reference range study was conducted using samples collected from 237 pediatric
patients aged between 1 year and up to 21 years. These samples were collected from
apparently healthy pediatric subjects from the North and South of the U.S. as well as
from different seasons (summer and winter). Serum samples from pediatric patients
meeting the following criteria were included:
1. Subjects aged 1 year up to 21-year-old.
2. No active chronic diseases, with the exception of allergic diseases for which no
allergy medication has been taken within the last 7 days preceding sample collection.
3. No active acute disease.
4. No prescribed medications in the 7 days preceding sample collection.
5. No contraceptive medication in the 90 days preceding sample collection.

6. No over the counter medications in the 7 days preceding sample collection.
7. No suspicion of premature of delayed puberty, based on physical examination.
8. No pregnant female subjects.
9. Ages 1 yr to 2yr: Length, weight, and weight for length all within the 10th and 90th
percentiles, based on WHO growth charts.
10. < 2 yr: Weight, height, and BMI all within the 10th and 90th percentiles based on
CDC growth charts.
11. Serum iPTH, TSH levels within published normal ranges
12. Only subjects taking < 1000 IU/Day of Vitamin D supplement
13. Only subjects with no personal or family history of thyroid disease.
14. Serum, iPTH and TSH, levels with published normal ranges.
15. Specimens with serum hemoglobin ≤ 155 mg/dL.
Based on the 95% confidence interval, the following expected values for pediatric
patients were established following CLSI guideline C28-A2.
Median 25(OH) vitamin D 23.4 ng/mL
Observed Range 2.5th to 97.5th percentile 11.4 ng/mL to 46.0 ng/mL
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
