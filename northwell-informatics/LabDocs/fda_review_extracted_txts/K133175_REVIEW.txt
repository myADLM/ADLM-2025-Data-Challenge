510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
k133175
B. Purpose for Submission:
Modification of a previously cleared device (k042522)
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Draeger Jaundice Meter JM-105
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Transcutaneous bilirubin in the neonate (yellowness of skin), quantitative readout
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
The JM-105 Jaundice Meter is a non-invasive transcutaneous bilirubinometer. It
measures yellowness of subcutaneous tissue in newborn infants. The unit provides a
visual digital measurement that has been shown to correlate with serum bilirubin in
newborn infants.
The JM-105 is a portable, hand held, battery powered device that includes a docking
station with a built in reading checker. The JM-105 batteries can be charged using a
battery charger or an optional USB cable.
The JM-105 is a modification of the JM-103 Jaundice Meter. The basic functionality
including measurement of the JM-105 is equivalent to the JM-103. The display of the
JM-105 has been improved (larger screen, touchscreen) and data storage and transmission
functionality was added. The measuring probe, hardware, and software used to process
the measurements are identical and therefore use the same measuring principle. Both JM-
103 and JM-105 determine the yellowness of subcutaneous tissue by using two optical
paths to measure the optical density difference at two wavelengths.
The meter contains a “reading checker” to monitor sufficient light output.
2. Principles of Operation:
The transcutaneous bilirubin absorbs blue and green light. The Jaundice Meter
1

--- Page 2 ---
determines the yellowness of the subcutaneous tissue by measuring the difference in the
optical densities for light in the blue (450 nm) and green (550 nm) wavelength regions.
When the measuring probe is pressed against the sternum or forehead of the infant, the
built-in xenon lamp flashes. The light from the xenon lamp passes through the glass fiber
and illuminates the skin. The light scatters and is absorbed in the skin and subcutaneous
tissue repeatedly, and then finally returns to the sensor side of the glass fiber. The denser
the transcutaneous bilirubin, the weaker the reflected blue light. The reflected green light
remains unchanged regardless of the density of the bilirubin.
Because the optical density difference shows a linear correlation with the total serum
bilirubin concentration, it is converted to the bilirubin concentration and displayed
digitally on the device screen.
Measurements must be taken only on the infant’s sternum (at hospital sites or physicians’
offices) or forehead (at hospital sites only) where a sufficient amount of blood is
circulated. A possibility exists that the bilirubin in the subcutaneous tissue may measure
low for areas with minimal blood flow or areas in which the subcutaneous tissue is
subject to keratinization.
Although correlation with serum bilirubin was observed for both sternum and forehead
measurements, the clinical studies performed with the Jaundice Meter show consistently
better results with measurements taken at the sternum versus the forehead. There is a
possibility that this difference may be more pronounced for infants that have been
exposed to sunlight, such as infants seen at doctors’ offices. Only sternum measurements
were evaluated during the studies conducted at doctors’ offices; correlation of forehead
measurements with serum bilirubin has not been evaluated, and the device is not intended
for forehead measurements at doctors’ offices.
3. Modes of Operation:
Manual method- hand held device.
4. Specimen Identification:
Sternum (in hospitals and physician offices) or forehead (in hospitals only) skin of infants
> 35 weeks gestation and < 14 days of age.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Not applicable. This is a non-invasive test, a transcutaneous measurement with an optical
probe.
6. Calibration:
Factory calibrated.

G. Intended Use:
1. Indication(s) for Use:
The Jaundice Meter (JM-105) is a non-invasive transcutaneous bilirubinometer. It
measures yellowness of subcutaneous tissue in newborn infants. The unit provides a
visual digital measurement that has been shown to correlate with serum bilirubin in
newborn infants.
The device is intended for use in hospitals, clinics or doctor’s offices under a physician’s
supervision / direction to assist clinicians in monitoring of newborn infants. The device is
not intended as a standalone for diagnosis of hyperbilirubinemia. It is to be used in
conjunction with other clinical signs and laboratory measurements.
Newborn infants whose JM-105 Jaundice Meter test results are indicative of
hyperbilirubinemia should be evaluated by their physician(s) for appropriate patient
3

management. Specific neonatal patient Bilirubin levels should be confirmed by other
methods, such as serum bilirubin, prior to treatment determinations.
The JM 105 is a prescription medical device
The JM 105 is not intended for home use.
The JM 105 may only be used at the sternum measurement site for Physician’s office
applications.
2. Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
Use only on infants up to 14 days of age.
The Jaundice Meter is indicated for use in neonatal patients born >35 weeks gestation
who have not undergone exchange transfusion or phototherapy treatment.
Users must be trained prior to using the device.
The device is indicated for forehead and sternum measurements in hospitals, and only
sternum measurements in physician’s offices. Forehead measurements in physician’s
offices were not tested and may be more prone to uncertainties.
For prescription use only.
