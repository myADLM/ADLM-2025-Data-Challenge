L. Test Principle:
Medisign Blood Glucose Monitoring System measures the glucose in the whole blood
sample by using a small electrical current produced by a chemical reaction between
the glucose in the blood and glucose oxidase (GOx) on the test strip. This current is
proportionally converted to the amount of glucose in the blood sample to display as
the blood glucose result. Glucose measurements are reported as plasma equivalents.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
Medisign MM1100 Blood Glucose Monitoring System and Medisign MM1100 Multi
Blood Glucose Monitoring System are the same except in name and intended use
(single- vs. multiple-patient use). Therefore, only one set of performance data is
needed.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The repeatability evaluation was performed by adjusting venous blood to 5
glucose levels (30 to 50, 51 to 110, 111 to 150, 151 to 250, 251 to 400). All
6

--- Page 7 ---
samples were tested on 3 lots of test strips with ten Medisign MM3000
meters. All samples were also tested on the YSI 2300 analyzer to generate the
expected values. Results are summarized below:

Between-day precision was evaluated using three levels of glucose control
solutions(Level 1, 2, and 3). Each sample was measured in duplicate with
three test strip lots and 10 Medisign MM3000 glucose meters. These tests
were performed over 10 days, for a total of 300 tests per glucose level.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using one test strip lot and 9 mixed pools of venous
blood samples ranging in glucose concentrations (as measured by YSI) of 19,
45, 88, 168, 233, 345, 470, 535, 618 mg/dL. Each level was measured 20
times and the values from the Medisign MM3000 glucose meter were
compared with those obtained from YSI 2300. Results from regression
analysis:
y = 0.998x – 6.24; R2 = 0.999
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement
range of 20-600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The Medisign MM3000 and Medisign MM3000 Multi Blood Glucose
Monitoring Systems are traceable to the NIST SRM #917c reference material.
The method comparison study was performed using the YSI 2300 Glucose
Analyzer as the reference method (see Section 2.a. below).
Test Strip Stability:
Test strip stability was assessed in real time studies. The stability testing
protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The
manufacturer claims shelf life stability of 24 months and an open-vial stability
of 3 months at the recommended storage temperatures of 39°F-86°F and 10-90%
RH.
Control Solution Value Assignment and Stability:
Value assignment: Three levels of aqueous control solutions (levels 1 to 3)
are available for use with the Medisign MM3000 Blood Glucose Monitoring
System. Value assignment for use of the control solutions with the Medisign
MM3000 glucose test strips is based on measurements using the YSI 2300.
The values for each of the control solutions are assigned by repeat analysis
using 25 Medisign test strips per lot of test strips and five Medisign MM3000
glucose meters. The mean, SD and CV are used to establish the acceptable
ranges for the test strips. The range for each control solution is provided in
the labels of the test strips.
Stability Testing: Stability was assessed using real-time testing for each
control solution level. Protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and
found to be acceptable to support the shelf life stability claim of 24 months
and an open-vial stability claim of 3 months when stored at the recommended
storage temperatures of 4°-30°C (39-86°F).

d. Detection limit:
See linearity study in Section M.1.b above.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed by spiking venous blood with three levels
of glucose concentrations (70-100, 140 to 180 and 250 to 350 mg/dL). Each
of these samples was divided into a test group and a control group and each of
19 potential endogenous and exogenous interfering substances was added to
the test group. Each compound was tested at two concentrations,
normal/therapeutic and high/toxic concentrations.
Each sample was analyzed 5 times with the Medisign MM3000 glucose meter
and the % difference between the interferent containing sample and the
control sample calculated. The sponsor defines no significant interference as
within ±10% difference relative to the control sample. Results are presented
in the table below:
Potential Concentration Potential Concentration
Interfering with no Interfering with no
Substance Significant Substance Significant
Interference Interference
(mg/dL) (mg/dL)
Acetaminophen 20 Salicylic Acid 50
Ascorbic Acid 5 Tetracycline 4

L-Dopa 5 Lactose 5.0
Methyldopa 2.5 Xylose 100
Hemoglobin 500 Caffeine 10
Ephedrine 10 Pyruvic Acid 10
The following limitations regarding potential interference are included in the
Test Strip Insert:
Interferencecs: Acetaminophen, salicylates, uric acid, ascorbic acid (vitamin c)
and other interferent substances in blood at normal/therapeutic concentrations
do not significantly affect results, however, abnormally high concentrations in
blood may cause inaccurate results.
All test results using MM3000 Blood Glucose Monitoring System showed %
bias within ±10% between the test and control groups for the toxic level of
interference substance at two levels (140~180mg/dL, 250~350mg/dL) of

System Accuracy:
To assess system accuracy, results from the Medisign MM3000 Blood
Glucose Monitoring System were compared to a reference method, YSI 2300.
Capillary samples from 106 participants with glucose concentrations ranging
from 36 to 438 mg/dL were tested using three test strip lots. To obtain
extreme blood glucose concentrations 5 samples ≤ 47 mg/dL and 5 samples ≥
412 mg/dL were altered. For the altered samples, capillary blood samples
were collected with an anticoagulant and incubated to allow glucose to
hydrolyse (≤ 47 mg/dL) or the glucose was supplemented (≥ 412). The results
relative to YSI are summarized in the tables below:

c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
User Performance Study:
To assess the performance of the Medisign MM3000 Blood Glucose
Monitoring System in the hands of the intended users the sponsor performed a
study with 180 lay user participants, who collected samples at three study
locations with three test strip lots. Study participants tested their finger, palm,
and forearm. Results were analyzed by comparing blood glucose results from
the Medisign MM3000 glucose meter obtained by the lay user against the YSI
2300 reference value. The unaltered capillary blood samples ranged from 54-
460 mg/dL as measured by YSI. The results are summarized in the tables

5. Calibration:
The meter identifies the test strip code automatically; therefore, no coding is
required by the user. The labeling includes instructions for the user to try another
test strip if the code numbers don’t match and to contact Customer Service if the
problem persists.
6. Quality Control:
Three levels of aqueous glucose control solutions are available with this system.
The glucose control solutions are sold separately. Control solution test mode is
provided to separate the control solution test results from those produced by
whole blood. Control solution test results are not included the calculation for the
Days Average result. Recommendations on when to test the control materials are
provided in the labeling. The control solution results are not included in the
averaging results. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test
strip label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls
outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not
Covered In The “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1) Hematocrit Study: The effect of different hematocrit levels on the performance of
the Medisign MM3000 Blood Glucose Monitoring System was evaluated using
venous whole blood samples with hematocrit levels 30, 42, and 55% spiked with
glucose to achieve 6 concentrations ranging from 38 to 503 mg/dL (38, 99, 190,
313, 396, and 503 mg/dL). Each sample was then tested 10 times using the
Medisign MM3000 glucose meter and the values were compared with those
obtained from YSI-2300 analyzer. The % biases relative to YSI were acceptable
within the claimed hematocrit range of 30 to 55%.
2) Altitude study: This study was performed with 5 venous blood samples ranging
from 78 to 490 mg/dL (78, 127, 240, 395, and 490 mg/dL) using YSI plasma
reference method. Testing was performed at altitudes of sea level and 11,480 feet
using a chamber to simulate high altitude conditions. The results demonstrate
acceptable bias to YSI to support the claims in the labeling that altitudes up to
10,000 feet (3048 meters) have no significant effect on blood glucose
measurements from the Medisign MM3000 glucose meter.
3) Sample volume study: The sponsor performed a study to verify the test strip
minimum sample volume requirement. Blood samples were tested at five sample
volumes (0.3, 0.4, 0. 5, 0.6, and 0.7 µL) and values obtained were compared to
YSI values. Results support the claimed minimum sample volume of 0.5 mL
4) Temperature and humidity studies: The sponsor performed temperature and
humidity studies using venous blood samples at 3 glucose concentrations to
evaluate temperatures ranging from 10oC to 40oC and relative humidity from 10%
to 90%. Meter results were compared to YSI values. Six temperature and
14

--- Page 15 ---
humidity combinations were tested including 10oC at 10% and 90% RH, 22oC at
10% and 90% RH and40oC at 10% and 90% RH. No significant effect (relative
to YSI) was observed with the temperature and humidity combinations tested.
The results support the claims in the labeling that the system can be used in
conditions of 39 to 104°F (10 to 40°C) with relative humidity of 10 to 90%.
5) Infection Control Studies: The device is intended for single-patient (MM3000
Blood Glucose Monitoring System) andmultiple-patient (MM3000 Multi Blood
Glucose Monitoring System) use. Disinfection efficacy testing on the surface
materials of the meter by an outside commercial testing laboratory demonstrated
complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the chosen disinfectant,
CaviWipes® Disinfecting Towelettes with EPA number 46781-8. Robustness
studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no
change in performance or external materials of the meter after 11,000 cleaning
and disinfection cycles designed to simulate 3 years of device use. Labeling was
reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection
procedures.
6) EMC testing was evaluated and certified by ONETECH Corp. and Verification of
Compliance certificates provided.
7) A readability assessment was provided to demonstrate that the User Manual, test
strip package insert and control solution package insert were each written at the
8th grade level.
8) Customer service is available 24 hours a day/7 days a week/365 day a year by
calling 1-888-885-6677.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
