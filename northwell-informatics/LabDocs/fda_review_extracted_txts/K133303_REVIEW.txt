L. Test Principle:
The Pantex Salivary Direct Testosterone EIA kit is based on the competition principal
and microplate separation. Testosterone calibrators of known concentration,
unknown amounts of testosterone in saliva samples and a fixed amount of
testosterone (analog) conjugated to horse radish peroxidase (Testosterone-HRP)
compete for binding sites with a rabbit monoclonal antiserum bound to GARGG (goat
anti-rabbit gamma globulin) coated wells of a microplate. After incubation, unbound
components are washed away, enzyme substrate solution is added and a blue color
formed. This reaction is stopped with an acid solution to produce a yellow color. The
optical density is then read at 450 nm. The amount of Testosterone-HRP detected is
inversely proportional to the amount of testosterone in a sample.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed in accordance with the CLSI EP6-A
guideline. Ten samples were prepared by serial dilution using a low saliva
testosterone sample and a high spiked saliva testosterone sample. The
samples ranging in concentration from 5.5pg/mL to 650.0 pg/mL were tested
in duplicate. The mean observed values (y-axis) were plotted against the
calculated target values (x-axis). The polynomial regression analysis of the
data suggested the best fit with the first order model, resulting in the linear
regression equation y = 0.9597x + 3.335, R2 = 0.99685. Additionally, the
percent recovery between mean calculated target values and the observed
values ranged from 91.6% to 106.5%. The linearity study results suggest that
the candidate device is linear from 5.5 to 650.0 pg/mL of testosterone.
The data support the sponsor’s claimed measuring range of 6.4 pg/mL to
500.0 pg/mL.
Since the testosterone used to prepare calibrators and controls is synthesized,
it is also important to show that the synthetic testosterone is read accurately by
the test system when spiked into native saliva samples. Therefore, a Spiking
Recovery Study was performed to evaluate whether added testosterone to
native saliva sample can be accurately recovered over the claimed measuring
range of the candidate device. Seven saliva samples were collected in the
Pantex Sample Collection Device. The samples were aliquoted and stored
frozen. The frozen aliquots of the seven samples were thawed, centrifuged to
remove mucins, equilibrated to room temperature and assayed with the
candidate device to measure the testosterone concentration. The samples were
then spiked to approximate expected saliva testosterone levels (17.8 pg/mL to
353.7 pg/mL) within the claimed measuring range of the candidate device,
and assayed with the candidate device. The percent recoveries between the
observed value and the expected value for the seven samples were calculated
and ranged from 92.6% to 108.9%.

A manual dilution study was conducted to show accuracy of the test results
obtained by 1:10 dilution of unknown high testosterone samples. The percent
recovery obtained on the six 1:10 diluted high testosterone samples (229.5,
274.3, 346.7, 633.1, 850 and 1125.8 pg/mL) were calculated and ranged from
96.0% to 109.5%. The sponsor has included the following in the
device labeling, “Samples with testosterone values greater than 500pg/mL
should be diluted 1:10 with zero (0) calibrator and re-run for accuracy.
Obtain the final testosterone concentration by multiplying the diluted sample
by 10.”
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The concentrations of all testosterone calibrators and controls are traceable to
the internal standard, which is traceable to the referenced material, US
Pharmacopeia (USP) reference standard.
The stability study protocols to determine the shelf-life (close vial) and the
stability of in-use (open vial) kit components were reviewed and found to be
acceptable. Based on the real time stability studies, the shelf life of the
reagent kit is 4 months when stored at 2 to 8 ºC. Based on the open vial
stability study, the in-use kit components/reagents, and the working solutions
were determined to be stable for 31 days when stored at 2 to 8 ºC.
Value assignments for calibrators and controls: The testosterone stock
calibrator and the testosterone stock control are traceable to the US
Pharmacopeia (USP) Cat. No. 1646009, Lot J0G360, and are prepared
gravimetrically and are actual to the stated testosterone concentration on its
label. Sponsor states that prior to release, the values of the calibrator and
control are verified by assaying repeatedly on the Pantex Salivary Direct
Testosterone EIA Kit.
Calibrator’s target value is 62,500 pg/mL
Control’s target value is 40,000 pg/mL
Saliva sample stability studies were performed to evaluate whether the
testosterone in the sample is stable when the sample is exposed to different
temperature conditions over several days. Two saliva samples, one from male
(spiked to obtain a high testosterone sample at 222.2pg/mL) and one from
female (low testosterone sample at 14.2pg/mL), were collected in the Pantex
Sample Collection Device. The samples were aliquoted and stored frozen.
For the stability study testing, the aliquots were thawed, centrifuged to remove
mucins, and exposed to the following storage conditions viz. at 2 to 8 ºC, 20
to 28 ºC, 37 ºC, ≤ -15 ºC (for long term sample storage), and at ≤ -15 ºC for
testing seven freeze/thaw cycles. The samples were assayed once every day
with the candidate device for seven days. Based on the calculated percent
recoveries (ranged from 91.7% to 100%) between the observed value and the
zero day value, the saliva samples are stable for seven days when stored at 2
to 8 ºC, 20 to 28 ºC, 37 ºC, for up to 180 days at ≤ -15 ºC, and stable to seven
freeze/thaw cycles up to seven days at ≤ -15 ºC.

--- Page 9 ---
A sample shipping and handling study was conducted to evaluate whether the
stability of testosterone in saliva is affected by shipping, handling and storage
conditions. Five saliva samples at different testosterone concentrations (15.4,
28.2, 44.8, 106.4 and 221.9 pg/mL) were collected in the Pantex Sample
Collection Device. The samples were aliquoted and stored frozen. For the
study testing, the aliquots were thawed, centrifuged to remove mucins, and
tested on the day of shipping (Day zero read prior to shipping). The samples
were shipped out and remained in transit for 9 days at 19 to 24 ºC (Site A), 12
to 28 ºC (Site B) and 24 to 41 ºC (Site C). On receiving the samples, the
samples were frozen until the assay date. On the day of the assay, the samples
were thawed and centrifuge to remove mucins. The aliquots of the five
samples were then stored the following storage conditions at 2 to 8 ºC, 20 to
28 ºC, 37 ºC and ≤ -15 ºC for seven days. The samples were tested with the
candidate device on day three and seven. The samples were shown to be
stable (recovery ranged from 91.1% to 99.8%) in transit for 9 days at 2 to 8 ºC
and 20 to 28 ºC, followed by storage at 2 to 8 ºC, 20 to 28 ºC, 37 ºC and ≤ -15
ºC for seven days.
d. Detection limit:
The limits of detection were determined in accordance with the CLSI EP17-A
guideline.
The limit of blank (LoB) study was conducted using four low or non-
detectable testosterone saliva samples. The four testosterone saliva samples
were tested with the candidate device 96 times over three days using two
reagent lots (16 testings per day per reagent lot; 48 testing per lot). LoB was
calculated using the nonparametric option of LoB calculation. LoB was
determined to be 1.8 pg/mL.
The limit of detection (LoD) was determined using four low salivary sample
containing testosterone concentration at approximately ≤ 3.0 pg/mL. Each
low sample was tested with the candidate device in quadruplicates, two tests
per day for a period of three days using two reagent lots to generate 12
testosterone measurements over three days per reagent lot (4 testing per day
per reagent lot). Using the calculated standard deviation in the formula LoD =
LoB + (1.645*SD), the LoD was determined to be 2.1 pg/mL.
The limit of quantitation (LoQ) study was conducted using four low
testosterone saliva samples at concentrations > 3.0 pg/mL and < 6.4 pg/mL.
Each sample was tested with the candidate device in quadruplicates, two tests
per day for a period of three days using two reagent lots to generate 12
testosterone measurements over three days per reagent lot. The LoQ was
estimated as 3.9 pg/mL.
The sponsor’s claimed measuring range is 6.4 pg/mL to 500 pg/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference studies were performed following the CLSI EP7-A2 guideline to
evaluate whether commonly orally consumed substances like food, coffee,
9

--- Page 10 ---
wine, chewing gum and cigarette smoking interfere with the quantitation of
saliva testosterone using the candidate device. Four individuals were enrolled
in the study for five days. Each day at the same time (8:00 AM) a control
saliva sample was collected, followed by exposure to one of the interferents in
the mouth for 3 minutes. The interferent is then removed from the mouth by
spitting or blowing out, and after 12 minutes a second saliva sample was
collected. The samples were assayed for testosterone level using the
candidate device. Sponsor defines non-significant interference as ≤ 10% bias
between the tested sample and the control sample.
Results summary:
The percent recovery between the control and test sample ranged from 93.3%
to 105.2%, indicating no significant interference observed from the presence
of food, coffee, wine, chewing gum and cigarette smoking.
However, significant interference was observed with whole blood (bias ranged
from -14.8% to 148.4%), sodium azide (bias ranged from -5.4% to 179.3%)
and thimerosal (bias ranged from -12.8% to 62.2%). The sponsor has
included the following limitations in the labeling, “Avoid the use of samples
with blood contamination, sodium azide and thimerosal as it may lead to false
results.”
The sponsor also indicates the following instructions for sample collection in
the labeling:
“Avoid food consumption, drinking coffee or alcohol, smoking or chewing
gum 15 minutes prior to sample collection. Rinse mouth thoroughly with
water 15 minutes prior to collection.”
Cross-reactivity studies were performed to evaluate the interference from
structurally related compounds. The potential cross-reactants were tested up
to a concentration of 10,000pg/mL and 20,000pg/mL in saliva samples
containing low, medium and high concentration of testosterone
(approximately 15, 50 and 225 pg/mL of testosterone). The percent cross-
reactivity mean values calculated between the sample spiked with
10,000pg/mL and 20,000 pg/mL of the cross-reactant is used as the
representative value for each corresponding low, medium and high
testosterone saliva sample and its spiked compound. The results are shown in
the table below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparisons between the candidate device, Pantex Salivary Direct
Testosterone EIA and the predicate device, IBL Testosterone LIA were
performed according to the CLSI EP9-A guidelines. A total of 106 samples of
which 97 samples were real patient’s saliva samples and 9 samples were
spiked samples, ranging in testosterone concentration from 6.45 pg/mL to
458.35 pg/mL were used in the study. The candidate device results (Y-axis)

were compared to the corresponding predicate device results (X-axis). Linear
regression analysis resulted in the linear regression equation: y = 0.9035x +
5.81; R2 = 0.98
The results correlate well around the clinically relevant range (<150 pg/mL).
However, the results near the upper end of the measuring range demonstrate
some scatter leading to the regression statistics noted above. However, the
scatter observed in the upper section of the assay range is clinically
insignificant.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Reference range studies were performed following the CLSI C28-A3 guideline.
Oral fluid samples were collected in the morning from 240 normal healthy
females and 240 normal healthy males ranging in age from 20 to 70 years. The
inclusion criteria used for recruitment of normal healthy subjects included adults
of all ages, all genders, all ethnicity, not undergoing medical treatment or drug
therapy and free of any illness on the day of sample collection. The exclusion
criteria used for recruitment of normal healthy subjects included those on
hormone therapy or taking oral contraceptives, history of thyroid or other
autoimmune disease, history of Cushing’s Syndrome or Addison’s disease, and
pregnant or lactating women. The results are summarized in the tables below:
