H. Intended Use:
1. Intended Use(s):
The Wondfo® Strep A Rapid Test is a chromatographic immunoassay for the qualitative
detection of Strep A antigen from throat swab specimens from symptomatic patients to
aid in the diagnosis of Group A Streptococcal infection. All negative test results should
be confirmed by bacterial culture because negative results do not preclude Group A Strep
infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment. This test is intended for
professional and laboratory use, only.
2. Indication(s) for Use:
The Wondfo® Strep A Rapid Test is a chromatographic immunoassay for the qualitative
detection of Strep A antigen from throat swab specimens from symptomatic patients to
aid in the diagnosis of Group A Streptococcal infection. All negative test results should
be confirmed by bacterial culture because negative results do not preclude Group A Strep
infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment. This test is intended for
professional and laboratory use, only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For in vitro diagnostic use only
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
None
I. Device Description:
The Wondfo® One Step Strep A Swab Test is a qualitative, lateral flow immunoassay for the
detection of Strep A carbohydrate antigen directly from a throat swab sample. To perform the
test, Reagent 1 (R1) is added to the extraction tube which is coated with a mixture of
conjugate antibodies and a lytic enzyme extraction reagent. The lytic enzyme is mixed with
colloidal gold conjugated to rabbit anti-Strep A and a second colloidal gold control conjugate
antibody. The reagents are dried onto the bottom of an extraction tube forming a red spot.
The extraction/conjugate pellet is re-suspended with R1 and the throat swab is added to the
extraction tube. The Strep A antigen is extracted from the sample and the swab is removed.
The test strip is immediately placed in the extracted sample. If Group A Streptococcus is
present in the sample, it will react with the anti-Strep A antibody conjugated to the gold
particle. The complex will then be bound by the anti-Strep A capture antibody and a visible
red test line will appear, indicating a positive result. To serve as an onboard procedural
control, the blue line observed at the control site prior to running the assay will turn red,
indicating that the test has been performed properly. If Strep A antigen is not present, or
2

present at very low levels, only a red control line will appear. If the red control line does not
appear, or remains blue, the test result is invalid.

L. Test Principle:
The Wondfo® One Step Strep A Test utilizes double antibodies sandwich immunoassay for
the detection of Group A Streptococcal antigen. The test device consists of plastic housing
containing a test strip which has been pre-coated with rabbit anti-Strep A antibody on the test
band region and goat anti-rabbit antibody on the control band region. When the device is
immersed into the specimen, the specimen is absorbed into the device by capillary action,
mixes with the antibody-dye conjugate, and flows across the pre-coated membrane.
When the group A streptococcal antigen levels in specimens are at or above the target cutoff
(the detection limit of the test), the antigen binds to the antibody-dye conjugate and are
captured by rabbit anti-Strep A antibody immobilized in the Test region (T) of the device.
This produces a colored Test band and indicates a positive result. When the group A
streptococcal antigen levels are zero or below the target cut off, there is not a visible colored
band in the Test region (T) of the device. This indicates a negative result. To serve as a
procedure control, a colored line will appear at the Control region (C), if the test has been
performed properly.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision/Reproducibility was assessed with three lots of the Wondfo One Step Strep A
Swab Test at three testing sites (one in-house) for five days, with two runs per day.
The test panel consisted of a true negative sample (diluent only), a moderate positive
sample (2.3×106 organisms /mL), a low positive cut-off sample (1.5×105organisms
/mL, C95 concentration, approximately positive 95% of the time), and a low negative

acceptable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable – This assay is qualitative.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
Not applicable
Stability:
Reagents are Stable at 4-30 for 18 months based on the accelerated stability study at
500C and real time stability determination at both 40C and 300C. Eighteen swabs
with antigen concentration near the limit of detection (LoD) of S. pyogenes, and 18
blank swabs, were each equally and stored a 40C and 300C. The two sets were then
tested with three lots of Wondfo One Step Strep A at 4 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours.
Additionally, all swabs were extracted and tested immediately at each time point. For
the LoD swabs, three swabs per time point and temperature were evaluated in the
assay. For blank swabs (no bacteria), three replicates were evaluated.
Results showed that all blank swabs (no bacteria) tested negative in the Wondfo One
Step Strep A Swab Test. The LoD swabs generated a positive result when stored for 4
hours. Expected results were obtained at all temperatures when stored for up to 4
hours.
Stability results are acceptable.

Cross reactivity studies are acceptable as no cross reactivity was observed.
Interference:
The potentially interfering substances including blood, mucus, saliva, and clinically
relevant levels of medications used to relieve a sore throat, such as over-the-counter
cough drops, lozenges, cough syrups, throat sprays, mouth wash, etc. were tested
with Wondfo One Step Strep A Swab Test. Each potentially interfering substance
was diluted and split into two aliquots. One aliquot was spiked with S. pyogenes to
a final concentration of 2.3 x 106 organisms/mL. The second aliquot contained no
bacteria. These aliquot samples were tested by three lots of Wondfo One Step Strep
A Swab Test. Three laboratory assistants with relevant experience operated the
three tests. Results showed no interference by the substances shown below.

An additional study was performed to investigate the potential of Agar Interference on
the performance of the Wondfo One Step Strep A Swab Test. In this study, a positive
stock of inactivated Streptococcus pyogenes and a negative stock of Streptococcus
agalactiae were grown on blood agar media plates, from three different manufacturers.
Thirty plates, ten from each manufacturer, were used. Using a clean swab, an organism
was selected from the stock positive testing plate and streaked on each of the agar plates.
The swab was then run through the Rapid Strep A Test. The plates were then cultured for
48 hours. The same was done using the stock negative testing plates.
Results showed 100% agreement between culture and rapid test results. This suggests
that agar did not interfere with the performance of the Wondfo Strep A test.

f. Assay cut-off:
In order to determine the assay cut-off concentration, a concentrated stock (2.3x107

diluted in the solution of extraction reagents. Each dilution was tested by seven
operators each with three batches of Wondfo One Step Strep A Swab Test. A total of
21 determinations at each dilution were made. The test results are shown in the
following table.

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
The clinical performance of the Wondfo One Step Strep A Swab Test was established in a
multicenter prospective clinical study in 2011 – 2012 at six geographically diverse sites. A
total of 349 throat swabs were collected from patients exhibiting symptoms of pharyngitis.
Each swab was rolled onto a sheep blood agar plate for culture tests, and then tested by the
Wondfo One Step Strep A Swab Test. Of the 349 total specimens, 248 were found to be
negative (-) by culture and 101 were found to be positive (+) by culture. These test results are
summarized in the following tables.

5. Expected values:
Group A Streptococcus bacteria are responsible for about 19% of all upper respiratory
tract infections. Infection is most prevalent in winter and early spring, with most cases
arising in patients living in highly populated areas. In the multi-center clinical study
conducted by Wondfo in 2011-2012, 28.9% (101/349) of the patients presenting with
pharyngitis were found to be culture positive for Strep A.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
