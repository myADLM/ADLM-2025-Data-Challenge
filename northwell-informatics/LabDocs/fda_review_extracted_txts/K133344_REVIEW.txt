L. Test Principle:
The MINICAP FLEX-PIERCING instrument uses the principle of capillary
electrophoresis in free solution. With this technique, charged molecules are separated by
their electrophoretic mobility in an alkaline buffer with a specific pH. Separation also
occurs according to the electrolyte pH and electroosmotic flow.
The MINICAP FLEX-PIERCING instrument has silica capillaries functioning in parallel
allowing 2 simultaneous analyses for HbA1c quantification from whole blood sample. A
sample dilution with hemolysing solution is prepared and injected by aspiration at the
anodic end of the capillary. A high voltage protein separation is then performed and
direct detection of the hemoglobins is made at the cathodic end of the capillary at 415
nm, which is the absorbance wave length specific to hemoglobins. Before each run, the
capillaries are washed with a wash solution and prepared for the next analysis with
buffer.
The high resolution of MINICAP Hb A1c procedure allows the quantification of HbA1c,
even in the presence of labile HbA1c, carbamylated and acetylated hemoglobins, and
major hemoglobin variants such as HbS, HbC, HbD, HbE and HbF and common
interfering factors such as Triglycerides, Bilirubin, Ascorbic Acid, Urea, Rheumatoid
factor and Glybenclamide as outline in the package insert labeling.
By using alkaline pH buffer, normal and abnormal (or variant) hemoglobins are detected
in the following order, from cathode to anode: A2/C, E, S/D, F, A0, other Hb (including
minor Hb A1) and then A1c.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility within the same capillary and between capillaries from the
same instrument
Four different pooled blood samples were analyzed using the CAPILLARYS
HbA1c assay in both capillaries of the same MINICAP FLEX-PIERCING
instrument. The analyzed EDTA whole blood samples included a pool of
HbA1c samples at the normal (~5.2%), cut-off value (~6.4%) and elevated
HbA1c (~9.0 and 11.9%)
Each sample was assayed on both capillaries from the same instrument to
include 2 runs per day over 20 working days. Samples were analyzed in
duplicate within each run. The results are shown below:

Reproducibility between lots and instruments
Six different EDTA whole blood samples were analyzed using the
CAPILLARYS HbA1c assay in both capillaries of 3 different MINICAP
FLEX-PIERCING instruments and with 3 lots of MINICAP HbA1c kits. The
analyzed blood samples included a sample at the normal (~5.4%), a sample at
the cut-off value (~6.4%), and two elevated HbA1c samples (9.1 and 12.3%) .
Two whole blood control samples were also analyzed (~5.2 and ~7.9%
HbA1c).
Each EDTA whole blood sample was analyzed on both capillaries from each
instrument, including 60 runs over 10 days, 2 runs per day. Samples were
analyzed in duplicate. The results are shown below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity study was performed according to the CLSI EP6-A guidelines.
Two EDTA whole blood samples, including a normal sample with HbA1c
concentration at 4.8% HbA1c and an elevated HbA1c level sample with
HbA1c concentration at 13.8% HbA1c were mixed within different
proportions and the dilutions were electrophoresed with the MINICAP Hb
A1c procedure for a total of 11 samples. For each dilution, samples were
analyzed in duplicate. The tests were determined to be linear within the entire
ranges studied for HbA1c hemoglobin fraction (between 4.8 and 13.8% of
HbA1c).
NGSP units (%HbA1c)
The 1st order linear regression generated is:
Y = 0.08982x+4.764, r=0.999

hemoglobin concentrations. 3 different EDTA whole blood samples,
including a normal sample with HbA1c concentration at 5.0% HbA1c, a
sample with HbA1c level close to the cut-off value at 6.3% HbA1c and an
elevated HbA1c level sample with HbA1c concentration at 9.3% HbA1c, were
all serially diluted in hemolysing solution and electrophoresed with the
MINICAP Hb A1c procedure. The tests were determined to be linear within
the entire ranges studied from 2.5 to 31.1 g/dL total hemoglobin and HbA1c
fraction concentration and percentage were not affected by the hemoglobin
concentration of the samples. 12 mixtures were used per sample.

The expiration date of the Hb A1c CAPILLARY Calibrators is stated as 5
years between - 30 °C and - 18 °C (-22˚F/0˚F). When reconstituted, the in use
storage stability is 8 hours at 2-8˚C (36-46˚F), up to 22 months at -22˚C / -
18˚C (-8˚F/0˚F). The labeling states that the Hb A1c CAPILLARY Calibrators
should not be frozen and thawed more than 5 times.
The stability of the Hb A1c CAPILLARY Controls is demonstrated to be
stable for 8 hours at 2-8˚C (36-46˚F), up to 6 months at -22˚C/-18˚C (-
8˚F/0˚F). The labeling states that the HbA1c CAPILLARYS controls should
not be frozen and thawed more than 30 times.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) was determined by assaying five blood samples
without HbA1c. The Limit of Detection (LoD) was determined by assaying
six blood samples with low HbA1c. Both LoB and LoD were tested
according to CLSI guideline EP17-A . The results are as follows:
LoB= 0.3%, LoD = 1.1%
The claimed measuring range, 4.8 – 13.8%, is based on linearity. See 1b
above.
e. Analytical specificity:
i.) Studies were performed to assess common or known substances that could
interfere with the CAPILLARYS HbA1c assay kit. The interfering substances
were evaluated in whole blood samples that contained four different
concentrations of A1c (~4.9%, ~6.5% , ~8.8% and ~12.1%). Samples
containing various concentrations of potential interferents were tested and the
results compared to those obtained from control samples containing no
potential interfering substances. The sponsor’s definition of non-significant
interference is ≤0.3% HbA1c between the tested and the control samples.
The results are as follows:
Potential interfering Concentration at which no significant
substance interference (≤0.3%) was observed
Bilirubin ≤ 25.8 mg/dL (442 µM)

ii.) To study interference from Carbamlyated hemoglobin, four blood samples
with A1c concentrations at ~5.7%, ~6.9%, ~8.9% and 12.4% were split into
two aliquots. One aliquot, at each A1c level, was spiked with 1mmol/L of
Potassium Cyanate and incubated for 3 hours at 37˚C. Another aliquot, at each
A1c level, was incubated for 3 hours at 37˚C. Samples were then analyzed on
the MINICAP FLEX-PIERCING instrument using the CAPILLARYS HbA1c
assay kit. Samples were analyzed in triplicate. The sponsor’s definition of
non-significant interference is ≤ 0.3 HbA1c% between the tested and the
control samples.
The sponsor concluded that Carbamylated hemoglobin (at ≤ 8.11mg/dL
(1mmol/L) does not interfere with this assay.
iii.) To study interference from labile hemoglobin, four blood samples with
A1c concentrations at ~4.7%, ~6.8%, ~8.8% and ~12.7% were split into two
aliquots. One aliquot, at each A1c level, was spiked with glucose (0.5mol/L)
and incubated for 3 hours at 37˚C. Another aliquot, at each A1c level, was
incubated for 3 hours at 37˚C. Samples were then analyzed on the MINICAP
FLEX-PIERCING instrument using the CAPILLARYS HbA1c assay kit.
Samples were tested in triplicate. The sponsor’s definition of non-significant
interference is ≤ 0.3 HbA1c%.
The sponsor concluded that labile A1c (at ≤ 1800mg/dL (0.5mol/L) does not
interfere with this assay.
iv.) To study interference from acetylated hemoglobin, four blood samples
with A1c concentrations at ~5.2%, ~6.6%, ~9.4%, and ~ 11.7% were split into
two aliquots. One aliquot, at each A1c level, was used as the control sample
and the other aliquot was spiked with acetylated hemoglobin (10 mmol/L) and
incubated for 4 hours at 37˚C. All aliquots were tested on the MINICAP
FLEX-PIERCING instrument using the CAPILLARYS HbA1c assay kit.
Samples were tested in triplicate. The sponsor’s definition of non-significant
interference is ≤ 0.3 HbA1c%.
The sponsor concluded that acetylated hemoglobin (at ≤180 mg/dL
(10mmol/L)) does not interfere with this assay.
v) A hemoglobin variant interference study was carried out using samples
known to contain Hemoglobin variants S, E, D and C. These variant samples
were tested on the MINICAP FLEX-PIERCING instrument using the
12

CAPILLARYS HbA1c assay kit. The sponsor’s definition of non-significant
interference is ±10% difference between the candidate method and the
comparative method.
The testing results show there is no significant interference for HbS (≤
40.5%), HbE (≤ 24.7%), HbD (≤ 41.0%) and HbC (≤ 37.0%).
vi) An additional variant interference study was carried out to study the
variant interference from Hemoglobin F. The study was performed on 16
different samples with HbA1c values between 5.3 and 11.6%. The samples
contained concentrations of Hb F from 2.3 to 19.7 % and were tested on the
MINICAP FLEX-PIERCING instrument using the CAPILLARYS HbA1c
assay kit.
The testing results show there is no significant interference for Levels of HbF
≤ 15% , where significant interference is defined by ±10% difference between
the candidate method and the comparative method. The following limitation
regarding Hb F interference is included in the labeling:
Levels of Hb F up to 15 % in the blood sample do not interfere with HbA1c
fraction quantification, but no HbA1c result will be reported by the software
when Hb F level is higher than 15 %. Samples that contain high amounts of
Hb F (> 15 %), usually found in some people with thalassemia, infants, and
some pregnant women, may yield a lower than expected HbA1c result with
this assay.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
An internal and external method comparison study was conducted using a
total of 367 EDTA whole blood samples ranging from 4.7-14.6%HbA1c.
Testing was completed at three sites, with the following samples tested at each
site:
Site 1 (Internal) : 101 blood samples (35 normal and 66 with elevated HbA1c
Site 2 (external): 126 blood samples (71 normal and 55 with elevated Hb A1c
and
Site 3 (external) : 140 blood samples (68 normal and 72 with elevated Hb
A1c)
Normal Hb A1c was defined as < 6.5%. No samples were spiked or diluted.
Samples were analyzed in singlicate using the MINICAP HbA1c procedure on
the MINICAP FLEX-PIERCING instrument (candidate device) and the
CAPILLARYS 2 FLEX-PIERCING instrument (predicate device). Method
comparison studies were performed according to CLSI EP9-A2 guideline. The
