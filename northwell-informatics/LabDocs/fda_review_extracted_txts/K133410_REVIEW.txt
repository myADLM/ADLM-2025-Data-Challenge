L. Test Principle:
The assay is based on the principle of α-complementation of the enzyme β-galactosidase and
the competition between an enzyme donor-25-OH vitamin D conjugate, an anti-Vitamin D
antibody and the 25-OH Vitamin D content of a serum sample. Samples with higher 25-OH
Vitamin D concentrations produce higher galactosidase activities and vice versa. A nitro-phenyl-
ß-galactoside derivative (NPG) is used as the enzyme substrate. The reaction's product has
maximum absorbance at 415 nm. The 25-OH Vitamin D concentration of a specimen is
proportional to the measured galactosidase activity. Five calibration levels are needed for each
run. Calibrators are treated exactly the same as patient samples.

The study protocol consisted of testing each control and human serum sample in
duplicate, 2 runs per day for 20 days, for 80 data points per sample. Three reagent lots
and one instrument were used in testing. Within-run and total precision
were calculated. All three lots of reagent yielded similar precision results. The
precision study results are summarized in the following tables:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity samples were prepared by diluting a serum sample containing 147.8
ng/mL of 25-OH Vitamin D with Vitamin D-depletion serum (0 ng/mL), resulting in
eleven equally-spaced concentrations which spanned the assay’s measuring range
The samples were run in triplicate using one lot of Diazyme 25-OH Vitamin D
reagent on the Roche Modular P analyzer. The data from the study showed the
following regression equation:
Y= 1.0004x - 1.2327, R2 = 0.9986
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claim that the assay is linear across the
measuring range of 7.6 ng/mL to147.8ng/mL.

Traceability: The master calibrator stock solution is prepared and tested on a NIST
calibrated spectrophotometer. The 25-OH Vitamin D3 concentration of the prepared
DMSO stock solution was spectrophotometrically calculated in triplicate using the
extinction coefficient at 265 nm using the equation given below:
Conc. (μg/mL) = (OD265) x (400.65 mg/mmol) x 1000 μg/mg
(1 cm) x 18,300 mL.mmol-1.cm-1
The master stock of 25-OH Vitamin D3 is prepared then used to build the calibration
levels by dilution into pooled human serum.
Calibrator value assignment:
The serum-based calibrators prepared are used in conjunction with the
Diazyme 25-OH Vitamin D assay reagents to test the NIST 972 25-OH Vitamin D
standards. Using regression analysis, the calibrator values are adjusted by testing
Diazyme controls, third party controls and a library of serum samples in addition to
the NIST 972 standards. The library of serum samples was previously tested with the
LIAISON Vitamin D total Assay to establish the expected values.
The target values of the calibrators are:
Calibrator 1 0.0 ng/mL
Calibrator 2 14.5 ng/mL
Calibrator 3 35.0 ng/mL
Calibrator 4 75.0 ng/mL
Calibrator 5 160.0 ng/mL
Control value assignment:
Normal (>30.0 ng/mL) and abnormal (<29.9 ng/mL) 25-OH Vitamin D controls
prepared in human serum are tested with released Diazyme 25-OH Vitamin D
reagents and calibrators and obtained from 3 independent runs in 20 replicates. The
obtained mean values are assigned as control target values. The controls target range
is assigned as mean + 25%.
The approximate target values for the controls are 23.1 ng/mL and 45.7 ng/mL.
Calibrator and control stability
Studies were performed by the manufacturer to support the storage claim of up to 8
months for unopened vials and 4 weeks for opened vials stored at 2-8 °C for both the
calibrator and controls. Stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and
found to be adequate.

d. Detection limit:
The limit of Blank (LoB), the Limit of Detection (LoD), and Limit of Quantitation
(LoQ) of the Diazyme 25-OH Vitamin D Assay were determined according to
CLSI17-A: Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of
Quantitation.
LoB: To calculate the limit of blank (LoB) of the Diazyme 25-OH Vitamin D assay,
aliquots of Vitamin D-depleted serum were used. This serum contains undetectable levels
of 25-OH Vitamin D as measured by LCMS/MS (<1 ng/mL). The Vitamin D-depleted
serum was assayed with the Diazyme Vitamin D assay in three independent runs with 20
replicates per run. The LoB was calculated as the mean of the 57th and 58th highest
values for the blanks.
LoD: To calculate the limit of detection (LoD) of the Diazyme 25-OH Vitamin
D assay, five very low Vitamin D serum samples were measured in three
independent runs, with four replicates per run. The LoD is defined with the
following equation: LoD = LoB + (1.645 * STDEV of Low samples).
LoQ: Five specimens with mean measured concentration ranging from 6.62 to 22.43
ng/mL were assayed. Each sample was assayed in replicates of 40 in 5 separate runs
for 200 data points. A curve was fit to estimate the relationship between mean and
CV. LoQ is defined as the point where the upper 95% confidence interval for the
curve has a CV of 20%. The following are the limits determined with the Diazyme
25-OH Vitamin D Assay.
LoB LoD LoQ
2.0ng/mL 3.5 ng/mL 7.6 ng/mL
The measuring range of this assay is 7.6 – 147.8 ng/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference Study:
An interference study was performed according to the CLSI EP7-A2 protocol. For
each concentration of interfering substance, five serum samples at two different 25-
OH Vitamin D concentrations were measured in duplicate, with two independent runs
to ensure precise results. The sponsor defines non-significant interference as a
difference of less than or equal to 10% between the spiked and the control samples.
Results of non-significant interference are summarized in the table below.

Because assay results are affected by hemoglobin, the sponsor has the following
limitation in their labeling:
“Any visibly hemolyzed sample should not be used.”
Cross Reactivity study:
Cross-reactivity of the Diazyme 25-OH Vitamin D Assay was evaluated by adding
Vitamin D metabolites to serum pool samples. Based on the results in the table below, the
assay did not cross react with Vitamin D2 and Vitamin D3 and the assay recovers both
25-OH Vitamin D2 and 25-OH Vitamin D3 similarly. Cross-reactivity with various
Vitamin D metabolites is summarized in the table below:

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Human serum samples were tested with the Diazyme 25-OH Vitamin D Assay and
the obtained results were compared to the predicate method. 98 unaltered serum
samples were tested in the method comparison study. All the Diazyme 25-OH
Vitamin D values were obtained from a single measurement using one reagent lot and
one instrument (Roche Modular P chemistry analyzer). Results of the Deming
Regression analysis are presented in the following table:
n 98
Slope 1.005 (0.969 to 1.041)
Intercept -0.21 (-2.15 to 1.73)
Correlation Coefficient 0.984 (0.976 to 0.989)
Range of values 9.5 to 140.9
b. Matrix comparison:
To evaluate the effect of anticoagulants, the Diazyme 25-OH Vitamin D Assay was
used to measure the 25-OH Vitamin D concentrations of matched sets of serum, K -
3
EDTA plasma, and Lithium-Heparin plasma. The reported values for each sample
and for each matrix were obtained from single measurements. The total numbers of
matched sets tested were 66. In order to cover the claimed measuring range for each
matrix, seven spiked patient samples were included in the study.
Linear regression of the Lithium-Heparin plasma versus serum data yielded the
following results: y = 0.9657x – 0.6596 and R2 = 0.9736
Linear regression of the K -EDTA plasma versus serum data yielded the following
3
results: y = 0.9948x – 0.7057 and R2 = 0.9866.
The results from the matrix comparison study support the sponsors claim that EDTA
and Lithium Heparin samples are acceptable for this assay.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
To determine a reference range for the Diazyme 25-OH Vitamin D Assay, the 25-OH
Vitamin D serum concentrations of a US population of 157 apparently healthy
individuals (21- 80 yrs) were measured with the Diazyme method. Forty seven (47)
samples from Pennsylvania (Northern U.S.), fifty six (56) samples from Tennessee
(Central U.S.) and fifty four (54) samples from Texas (Southern U.S.) were evaluated.
All participating individuals met the following inclusion conditions:
· All samples were collected during the months of October and November (fall season).
· The studied population consisted of 72 light skinned individuals (46%) and 85 dark
skinned individuals (54%).
· 155 individuals (98.7%) did not take any artificial Vitamin D supplements. Two
individuals (1.3%) did take some Vitamin D supplements but did not exceed the daily
dose of 2000 IU.
· All 157 individuals did not have any family history of parathyroid or calcium regulatory
disease.
· All 157 individuals did not have any history of kidney disease, GI disease, liver disease,
calcium-levels related disease, thyroid disease, parathyroid disease, and calcium related
dis-ease, seizures, chronic disease, or bariatric surgery.
· All 157 individuals were not currently taking any medications that are known to affect
absorption or catabolism of Vitamin D (including cholesterol absorption inhibitors such
as Vytorin®, Inegy™ or Zetia; anticonvulsants such as Neurontin, Depakine® and Tri-
leptal; glucocorticoids such as Cortisol, Prednisone and Dexamethasone; HAART (AIDS
treatment) or antirejection medications.
