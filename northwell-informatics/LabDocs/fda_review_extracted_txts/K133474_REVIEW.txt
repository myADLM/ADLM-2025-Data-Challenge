SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification
Decision Summary
To: Princeton Biomeditech Corporation RE: K133474
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own
Class I device requiring a 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable
1. The names and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device:
Trade Names: BioSign® Flu A+B, Status Flu A & B
510(k) number: K132465
2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in
its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for
use, package labeling, and if available, advertisements or promotional materials.
3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S):
The modification presented in this 510(k) consisted of expanding the Analytical Inclusivity section
of the package insert to include reactivity information for two strains of the H5N1 subtype of
influenza A virus, A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and A/Anhui/01/2005.
The ability of the BioSign Flu A+B Test to detect H5N1 was tested using the aforementioned
influenza virus strains. These strains were obtained from the Influenza Reagent Resource
(established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and managed by the American Type
Culture Collection) as non-infectious beta-propiolactone inactivated virus. An analytical inclusivity
study was performed with each of the viruses using the same procedure employed in the original
submission. Each titered virus was diluted until the minimal visual signal intensity appeared on the
test line. This was defined as the lowest reacting level of the virus. Each virus was then tested in
triplicate at that dilution. All virus strains tested were detected in 3 out of 3 tests at the lowest reacting
level. The lowest reactivity level for each virus is listed below:
· A/Anhui/01/2005 (H5N1) – 1.6 x 107 EID /mL
50
· A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) – 1.6 x 106 EID /mL
50
The package inserts for the BioSign Flu A+B Test and the Status Flu A&B Test have been updated
to include the additional analytical reactivity information. Status Flu A&B is the name of the same
device being sold by LifeSign LLC under agreement with Princeton BioMeditech Corporation.
4. The FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified devices has not changed.

2) The following language is included in the package insert on page 7 in the analytical inclusivity
section (below the analytical inclusivity table):
**Although this test has been shown to detect these viral strains cultured from positive human
respiratory specimens, the performance characteristics of this device with clinical specimens
that are positive for these viruses have not been established.
3) The following language was removed from the package insert on page 7 in the analytical inclusivity
section (below the analytical inclusivity table) as the results of the testing provided in K133474 make
this language unnecessary.
NOTE: The performance characteristics of the test with cultured avian influenza A subtype
H5N1 virus, or with specimens from humans infected with H5N1 or other avian influenza
viruses have not been established.
6. Design Control Activities Summary:
1) Analytical reactivity testing was conducted for the H5N1 virus using identical methods employed in
the original submission for the unmodified device.
2) Risk Analysis
The risk analysis method used to assess the impact of the modification (adding additional viruses to
the analytical sensitivity section of the package insert) was a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis
(FMEA). Based on the result of the risk analysis, the verification activities required and acceptance
criteria were identified. Because the change is adding detection levels of additional virus strains
without changing any other characteristics of the test device (including the fundamental scientific
technology or indications for use), no risk is involved for this change except as listed below:
2) Declaration of Conformity
A “Declaration of Conformity” statement was submitted for the manufacturing facility and validation
activities and signed by the Regulatory Affairs Manager and the Quality Assurance Manager. The
statements indicate that:

a) As required by the risk analysis, all verification and validation activities were performed by the
designated individuals and the results demonstrated that the predetermined acceptance criteria
were met.
b) The manufacturing facility is in conformance with the design control procedure requirements as
specified in 21 CFR 820.30 and the records are available for review.
In conclusion, based on the results of the analytical reactivity testing the modified labeling is truthful
and accurate. The changes do not affect the performance of the BioSign Flu A+B Test therefore the
modified test is substantially equivalent to the currently cleared test.
7. A Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary, and the Indications for
Use Enclosure.
The labeling for the modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended
use for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the
particular modification and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices
demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. On this basis, I
recommend that the device is determined to be substantially equivalent to the previously cleared
device.
