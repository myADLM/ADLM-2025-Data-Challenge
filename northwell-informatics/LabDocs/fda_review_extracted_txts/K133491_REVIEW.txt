14971:2007/(R) 2010)
L. Test Principle:
The ADVIA Centaur Testosterone assay is a competitive immunoassay using direct
chemiluminescent technology. Testosterone in the patient sample competes with acridinium
ester-labeled testosterone in the Lite Reagent for a limited amount of polyclonal rabbit anti-
testosterone antibody bound to monoclonal mouse anti-rabbit antibody, which is coupled to
paramagnetic particles in the Solid Phase. The assay uses Testosterone Releasing Agent to
release bound testosterone from the endogenous binding proteins in the sample. Unbound
materials are then removed by washing. Acid Reagent and Base Reagent are then added to
initiate the chemiluminescent reaction. An inverse relationship exists between the amount of
testosterone present in the patient sample and the amount of relative light units (RLUs)
detected by the system.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A 20-day precision study was performed according to CLSI EP5-A2. Samples
included human specimen pools, three levels of controls and one in-house serum
control. Each sample was assayed in 2 replicates per run, 2 runs per day for 20 days
for a total of 80 replicates. The results are summarized below.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The linearity study of the modified ADVIA Centaur TSTO assay was performed
according to CLSI EP06-A. Testing was performed on an ADVIA Centaur (XP)
instrument with one lot of the modified ADVIA Centaur TSTO reagents. Nine
samples for the study were prepared by serially diluting a high sample with a blank
sample (charcoal-stripped human serum). These nine samples were assayed in
triplicate and the mean of triplicate results was used for the analyses. Results are the
following:
Sample Expected Observed Recovery Weighted Bias
(ng/mL) (ng/mL) (%) Linear Fit
Estimate
A 1529.7 1529.7 100.0% 1514.4 1.0%
B 1141.8 1148.0 99.5% 1136.6 0.5%
C 781.2 766.4 101.9% 758.8 3.0%
D 347.2 384.8 90.2% 381.0 -8.9%
E 178.6 194.0 92.1% 192.1 -7.0%
F 98.9 98.6 100.3% 97.7 1.2%
G 53.8 50.9 105.7% 50.4 6.6%
H 27.5 27.0 101.8% 26.8 2.6%
I 3.2 3.2 100.0% 3.2 -0.9%
The linearity study included samples spanning the entire measuring range. The
weighted linear fit regression equation is:
Observed = 0.99(Expected) + 0.06 ng/dL, (r = 0.999)
The results from the linearity study support the measuring range of 10 ng/dL to 1500
ng/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: The ADVIA Centaur Testosterone assay is standardized using internal
standards manufactured analytically which are traceable to gas chromatography-mass
spectroscopy (GCMS).
Controls: Sponsor recommends the use of commercially available quality control
materials with at least 2 levels (low and high) however sponsor does not supply the
controls.
Calibrators: The calibrator for the modified ADVIA Centaur TSTO assays is
Calibrator E, which was previously cleared under k934562.

Stability: On-board stability for the ADVIA Centaur Testosterone (TSTO) assay was
established by real time studies on the ADVIA Centaur XP system. The stability
study protocol and the acceptance criteria have been found acceptable. The ADVIA
Centaur Testosterone assay can be run using either the high or low volume usage
option. The on board stability of the reagent for high volume usage is 7 days with a
calibration interval of 16 days. The on board stability of the reagent for low volume
usage is 14 days with a calibration interval of 7 days. The ADVIA Centaur
Testosterone (TSTO) assay reagent is stable until the date printed on the label when
stored at 2-8˚C.
d. Detection limit:
The sponsor performed a detection limit study, based on CLSI EP17-A2, to determine
the limit of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD).
LoB determination was based on 96 determinations of blank samples obtained by
testing samples in 4 replicates twice a day for 3 days. The study was run in parallel
for two lots. The LoB for the modified ADVIA Chemistry TSTO assay was
determined to be 3 ng/dL.
LoD determination was based on 96 determinations of low analyte samples obtained
by testing samples in 4 replicates twice a day for 3 days. The study was run in parallel
for two lots. The LoD for was determined to be 10 ng/dL.
The measuring range of the device is 10 – 1500 ng/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference
Interference testing for endogenous substances was performed following the
guidelines of CLSI EP07-A2. Two patient serum pools, with endogenous testosterone
concentrations of 90 to 110 ng/dL and 360 to 440 ng/dL were spiked with each
interferent. Control samples were prepared by spiking sample pools with the
appropriate diluent at the same volume as the interfering substance stock. Samples
were tested in replicates of three (3) using the modified device. The sponsor defines
non-significant interference as a difference of less than or equal to 5% between the
spiked and the control samples. Results of non-significant interference are
summarized in the table below.
Interfering Substance Highest Concentration with non-
significant interference
Hemoglobin 500 mg/mL
Triglycerides 1,000 mg/mL
Conjugated Bilirubin 20 mg/dL
Unconjugated Bilirubin 20 mg/mL
