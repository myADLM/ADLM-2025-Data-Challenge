L. Test Principle:
The Vitamin B12 method is a homogeneous, competitive chemiluminescent immunoassay
based on LOCI® technology. LOCI® reagents include two synthetic bead reagents and
biotinylated intrinsic factor (IF). The first bead reagent (Chemibead) is coated with a B12
derivative and contains a chemiluminescent dye. The second bead reagent (Sensibead) is
coated with streptavidin and contains photosensitive dye. The patient sample is pretreated
with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and dithioerythritol (DTE) to release the serum B12 from its
carrier proteins. Potassium cyanide (KCN) is added to convert all the forms of B12 into a
single, cyanocobalamin form, and dicyanocobinamide is added to keep the B12 from
rebinding with the carrier proteins. After the sample pretreatment, the biotinylated IF and
chemibead reagents are added sequentially to the reaction vessel. Vitamin B12 from the

sample competes with the B12-chemibead for a limited amount of biotinylated IF.
Sensibead reagent is then added and binds to the biotin to form bead pair immunocomplexes.
Illumination of the complex at 680 nm generates singlet oxygen from the Sensibeads which
diffuses to the Chemibeads triggering a chemiluminescent reaction. The resulting signal is
measured at 612 nm and is an inverse function of the concentration of vitamin B12 in the
sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision study was designed based on the CLSI document EP5-A2.
Commercially available control materials, patient serum and lithium heparin plasma
pools were used for the precision study. One lot of reagent and one instrument was
used (Dimension® EXLTM with LM integrated chemistry system). For each sample,
a single test from two independent cups was analyzed twice per day for 20 days.
The repeatability and within-lab standard deviations were calculated by the analysis
of variance method.
The results are summarized below.
Mean Repeatability Within-Lab
Samples N
(pg/mL) SD %CV SD %CV
Serum pool 1 80 180 10.1 5.6 11.6 6.5
Plasma pool 1 80 467 13.1 2.8 15.8 3.4
Serum Pool 2 80 978 24.9 2.5 27.7 2.8
Serum Pool 3 80 1733 27.4 1.6 35.2 2.0
Low control 80 290 13.2 4.6 15.0 5.2
Medium control 80 498 11.7 2.3 18.2 3.7
High control 80 645 15.9 2.5 21.5 3.3
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity:
A linearity study was performed to support the measuring range claim. A native high
and a native low serum pool were combined in different ratios to produce 10 dilution
pools covering the intended assay range. All 10 pools were measured 5 times on a
single Dimension® EXL integrated chemistry analyzer. The range of tested sample
was from 66 to 2066 pg/mL. The weighted linear fitting was determined by plotting
the observed values against the expected values and generated the following equation:
y= 1.00x – 1.56
The linearity study supports the sponsor’s claim that the Vitamin B12 assay has a
reportable range of 80 to 2000 pg/mL.
Dilution recovery:
Dilution recovery was done to evaluate the dilution accuracy of Vitamin B12 values
measured for results >2,000 pg/mL, using water as a sample diluent. Six native
serum samples, with Vitamin B12 results ranged from 2412 pg/mL to 5907 pg/ml
(value assigned by the predicate device, Vista LOCI VB12 assay) were tested after
5

manual dilution (1:3) or with the auto dilution feature (1:3) on the Dimension® EXL
with LM integrated chemistry system. The observed % recoveries ranged from 100%
to 108%, vs. the expected value and support the sponsor’s claim that the sample could
be diluted either manually or automatically by the instrument.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
The Vitamin B12 in LOCI® Anemia calibrator is traceable to USP grade vitamin
B12 by gravimetric method. Folate in LOCI® Anemia calibrator is traceable to the
US Pharmacopeia grade folic acid.
Value assignment:
Vitamin B12: The anchor pool consists of 6 levels of Vitamin B12 in human serum
based material. The assigned value of the anchor pool is based on the Dimension
Vista® VB12 method. To provide stability, a large reserve of anchor pool is stored
frozen at -70 ±20 ˚C. The master pool is a frozen liquid, five-level material. The
assigned value of the master pool is obtained while tested against anchor pool on
the Dimension EXLTM with LM System. The master pool, which is held in reserve,
has the same composition as the calibrator. Values are assigned to each lot of
calibrator from the master pool using the Dimension EXLTM with LM System. The
value assignment is derived from 9 runs (n=5 replicates) on 3 instruments using 3
reagents lots.
Folate: The anchor pool consists of 5 levels of Folate in human serum base
material. The assigned value of the anchor pool is based on the Dimension Vista®
folate method. To provide stability, a large reserve of anchor pool is stored frozen
at -70 ±20 ˚C. The master pool is a frozen liquid, five-level material. The assigned
value of the master pool is obtained while tested against anchor pool on the
Dimension EXLTM with LM System. The master pool, which is held in reserve, has
the same composition as the calibrator. Values are assigned to each lot of
calibrator from the master pool using the Dimension EXLTM with LM System. The
value assignment is derived from 9 runs (n=5 replicates) on 3 instruments using 3
reagents lots.
Stability of calibrators:
Real-time stability protocols and acceptance criteria for calibrator stability (shelf-life
and in-use) were reviewed and found to be acceptable. Unopened thawed calibrator
material is stable for 30 days at 2-8˚C. Once thawed and the cap is removed,
assigned values are stable for 30 days when recapped immediately and stored at 2-
8˚C.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) for the VB12 method was
determined based on the CLSI document EP17-A2. Blank samples (N=5) were
prepared using five lots of HEPES buffer to determine the LoB. Low analyte
samples (N=9) were serum samples with low endogenous B12 ranging from 27 to
94 pg/mL to determine the LoD. Each sample was tested in duplicate, using two
lots of reagents once a day over 3 days for a total of 12 results per sample (total
N=60 for LoB study and total N=108 for LoD study).
6

--- Page 7 ---
The limit of quantification (LoQ) is defined as the lowest analyte concentration that
can be reproducibly measured with a total %CV of ≤20%. Seven serum pools with
low endogenous B12 levels ranging from 39 to 158 pg/mL were analyzed in duplicate,
once a day for twenty days for a total of 40 results per sample on each of two lots.
The results are summarized in the table below.
LoB LoD LoQ
Serum 30 pg/mL 50 pg/mL 80 pg/mL
The VB12 assay has a measuring range of 80- 2000 pg/mL.
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference:
Interference testing was performed according to CLSI EP7-A2 guideline to determine
the effect of various endogenous and exogenous substances on the Dimension Vista
VB12 assay. For all interferents, except rheumatoid factors (RF), the percent bias was
determined by testing a control sample without the interferent and comparing it to the
value obtained from a test sample to which the potential interferent had been added.
For RF interference, a human serum sample with a RF level of 625 IU/mL and a
normal human serum sample were spiked with the same level of vitamin B12.
Interferents were tested at two levels of vitamin B12, approximately 200 pg/mL and
1000pg/mL. For each spiked sample, the % recovery was determined when compared
against the unspiked sample. Sponsor defined non-significant interference as ≤ 10%
difference between the spiked and the unspiked sample. All interferents tested were
non-significant except Dextran 40 and Hemoglobin. Dextran 40 and Hemoglobin with
a >10% bias were repeated at lower concentrations to determine a level where the bias
became less than 10%. The sponsor states in the labeling that Dextran 40 at 6 g/dL
decreases Vitamin B12 results by -14.9% at 200 pg/mL and by -11.8% at 1000 pg/mL.
In addition, hemoglobin at 500 mg/dL increases Vitamin B12 results by 15.2% at 200
pg/mL and by <10% at 1000 pg/mL.
The hemolysis, icterus, and lipemia limits where the non-significant interference
were determined to be are summarized in the table below:
· Bilirubin (unconjugated) ≤ 60 mg/dL
· Bilirubin (conjugated) ≤ 20 mg/dL
· Hemoglobin ≤ 300 mg/dL
Triglycerides ≤ 3000 mg/dL
The sponsor states in the Instructions for Use labeling to avoid using hemolyzed
samples.
For common exogenous and endogenous interference substance, results of the
concentration tested that did not show significant interference are summarized in the
table below.

Cross reactivity:
Cross reactivity of cobinamide with the LOCI® VB12 antibody was challenged at a
concentration of 200 ng/mL. Cobinamide was added to a serum pool with a vitamin
B12 level of 200 pg/mL and to an aliquot of LOCI® Anemia Calibrator level 1. The
cross-reactivity was determined by testing a control sample (n=10) without
cobinamide and comparing it to the value obtained from a test sample (n=10) to
which cobinamide (200 ng/mL) had been added. The percent cross-reactivity was
calculated and the sponsor concluded that there is no cross-reactivity (≤ 1%) with
cobinamide.
IntrinsicFactorBlockingAntibody(IFBA)interference:
An IFBA interference study was performed to assess the interference effects of
IFBA on Vitamin B12 measurements. A total of two hundred thirteen (213) samples
were tested. One hundred sixty-eight (168) were from the general population
(presumed IFBA negative) samples that spanned the range of the assay. Forty-five
(45) samples were known to be positive for IFBA with titers ranging from 2 to 173
IU/mL. Patient samples with both positive and negative IFBA were assayed by both
the candidate and the predicate device. The sponsor followed CLSI Guideline
EP14-A2: Evaluation of Matrix Effects to evaluate the results and concluded that
the LOCI Vitamin B12 assay on Dimension EXLTM with LM System effectively
mitigates the interference of IFBA.
The sponsor included the following limitation in their labeling:
Intrinsic blocking antibodies are present in approximately half of pernicious anemia
patients. There is a low frequency possibility that these antibodies may not be
completely inactivated during the reaction pretreatment step. If test results are in
conflict with the clinical diagnosis, the sample can be tested for intrinsic factor
blocking antibodies.
Patient samples may contain heterophilic antibodies that could react with
immunoassays to give falsely elevated or depressed results. This assay has been
designed to minimize interference from heterophilic antibodies. Nevertheless,
complete elimination of this interference from all patient specimens cannot be
guaranteed. A test result that is inconsistent with the clinical picture and patient
history should be interpreted with caution.

freshly drawn from healthy donors were tested on the Dimension LOCI® VB12
assay covering the range of 169 to 1227 pg/mL. In addition, six spiked and one
diluted samples were prepared to all sample types to cover a sample range up to
1798 pg/mL and down to 107 pg/mL.

5. Expected values/Reference range:
Reference range:
United States Population Reference Range: 193-986 pg/mL
European Union Population Reference Range: 182-625 pg/mL
The reference range was established according to the CLSI C28-A3 guideline
Defining, Establishing and Verifying Reference Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory;
based on the capability of transferring the predicate device’s reference range to the
candidate device’s reference range because of the comparability of the two testing
systems. Sponsor followed the transferability guidance and verification procedure of
the CLSI and has confirmed that the established reference range from the predicate
device are transferable to the candidate device using 20 apparently healthy subjects in
the US and European Union, respectively. All 20 samples were within the established
reference range. The reference range was previously established in k121994 for the
predicate device by conducting a reference range study using 399amples.
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
