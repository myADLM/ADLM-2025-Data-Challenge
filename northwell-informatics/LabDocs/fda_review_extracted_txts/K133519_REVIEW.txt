L. Test Principle:
Glucose measurement is based on the hexokinase method. Glucose is phosphorylated by
hexokinase and excess adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the presence of magnesium ions to
glucose-6-phosphate. Glucose-6-phosphate is oxidized in the presence of nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD) by glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) to 6-
phosphogluconate and NADH which is measured at 340 nm and is proportional to the
amount of glucose present in the sample.
Electrolytes (sodium, potassium, and chloride) are measured based on ion selective
electrodes principles. The Carolina Liquid Chemistries ISE module employs crown ether
membrane electrodes for sodium and potassium and a molecular oriented PVC membrane for
chloride that are specific for each ion of interest in the sample. An electrical potential is
developed according the Nernst Equation for a specific ion. When compared to a reference,
this electrical potential is translated into voltage and then into the ion concentration of the
sample.

e. Analytical specificity:
Effects of common endogenous substances including bilirubin, hemoglobin and
triglycerides were evaluated by spiking serum pools with increasing amounts of
interferents at two analyte levels. In addition, chemical additives, including Ascorbic
acid and lithium heparin was evaluated for potential interference. The effect of drugs
were not tested and has been referenced in the product insert to the “Young, D.S.,
Effects of Drugs on Clinical Laboratory Tests, 3rd ed. AACC Press, Washington,
D.C., 1990, p.3 168, p. 3-180.”
The sponsor defined significant interference as a bias of >10% between the spiked
and unspiked sample. The tested results are summarized below:
Glucose
No significant interference was observed with Triglycerides up to 425 mg/dL,
Bilirubin levels at 25 mg/dL, Hemoglobin levels at 500 mg/dL and Ascorbic Acid
levels at 30 mg/L for either the normal glucose level or abnormal glucose level. No
significant interference was observed with Lithium Heparin levels or EDTA levels up
to 80 U/mL for either the normal or abnormal glucose level.
Sodium
No significant interference was observed with Triglycerides up to 537.8 mg/dL,
Bilirubin levels at 25 mg/dL, Hemoglobin levels at 500 mg/dL, and Ascorbic Acid

Because of the known interference of hemolysis on potassium, sponsor has the
following limitation stated in the labeling: “Hemolyzed samples should not be used
with this assay.” In addition, sponsor also states that grossly lipemic samples should
not be used with this assay.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Method comparison studies were conducted following CLSI EP9- A2. Separate
comparison studies were performed for both serum and li-heparin plasma samples.
Samples were analyzed on the Carolina Liquid Chemistries CLC 6410 versus the
Olympus AU 400 Clinical Chemistry Analyzer. Some samples were altered (spiked
or diluted) in order to span the entire claimed measuring range. The study result are
summarized in the below table.

b. Matrix Comparison:
Matrix effect has been evaluated through separate method comparison studies using
both serum and Li-heparin plasma samples. Please see item above in M. 2.a.The
sponsor concluded that Lithium heparin plasma is acceptable to be used with the ISE
and glucose assays.
3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
Not applicable
b. Clinical specificity:
Not applicable
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
Not applicable
4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The sponsor has provided the following Expected Values in the labeling:
Glucose: Serum/Plasma 74-106 mg/dL
Sodium: Serum/Plasma 136.0-145.0 mmol/L
Chloride: Serum/Plasma 98.0-107 mmol/L
Potassium: Serum 3.5-5.1 mmol/L; Plasma- (Male):3.5-4.5 mmol/L, (Female): 3.4-4.4

N. Instrument Name:
Carolina Liquid Chemistries CLC6410 Chemistry Analyzer
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
Random access instrument with ISE Module.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ____x____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Bar code identification
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Random access and stat mode operation. Samples are loaded on sample disk.
5. Calibration:
Glucose
An on-board calibration stability was performed on the Glucose Assay. The result
supports 30 days without recalibration or adding new reagent.
ISE
Calibration should be performed every day and with each new lot of reagent.
6. Quality Control:
The sponsor recommends on their labeling that “The validity of the reaction should be
monitored by use of control samples with known normal and abnormal values. These
controls should be run after each calibration and with every working shift in which assays
are performed. It is recommended that each laboratory establish their own frequency of
control. Each user should follow the state and local guidelines regarding the quality
control procedures”.
