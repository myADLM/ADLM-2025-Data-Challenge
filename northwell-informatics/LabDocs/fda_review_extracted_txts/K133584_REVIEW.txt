L. Test Principle:
The In Touch Blood Glucose Monitoring System test principle is based on electrochemical
biosensor technology and the principle of capillary action. The electrical current generated by
the reaction of glucose with the reagent of the strip is measured by the meter and is displayed
as the corresponding blood glucose level. The strength of the current produced by the
reaction depends on the amount of glucose in the blood sample. These blood glucose
measurements are obtained through the use of disposable test strips.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Within-run precision was measured by using heparinized venous whole blood at five
different glucose concentrations. Each sample was tested on 3 lots of test strips on
5

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The In Touch linearity study was designed following CLSI EP6-A guidelines. The
linearity study was performed using heparinized venous whole blood at eleven
different glucose concentrations. The eleven target levels were prepared with glucose
stock solutions to achieve the following glucose concentrations;
10.46 mg/dL, 21.2 mg/dL, 43.2 mg/dL, 73.3 mg/dL, 100.2 mg/dL, 167.8 mg/dL,
215.2 mg/dL, 325.6 mg/dL, 455.5 mg/dL, 562.0 mg/dL and 672.9 mg/dL.
The values from the In Touch meter were compared with those obtained from the
reference method. The results from linear regression analysis are summarized below:
Strip Lot Slope Intercept R2
1 0.9997 2.3576 0.9986
2 0.9962 0.1444 0.9986
3 1.0106 -1.2049 0.9974
The results support the sponsor’s claimed measurement range of 20-600 mg/dL. Data
from bench studies and software verification studies were provided to demonstrate
that if a sample is less than 20 mg/dL, the result is flagged by the meter as LO. If a
sample result exceeds 600 mg/dL, the result is flagged by the meter as HI.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: In Touch Blood Glucose Monitoring System is traceable to the NIST
SRM 917b reference material.
Stability: Unopened control solutions have a 24 month shelf life and are stable for
6 months after first opening when stored at 5-30ºC (41-86ºF). The unopened multi
strip vial configuration has a 24 month shelf life and is stable for 6 months after
opening when stored at 5-30ºC (41-86ºF) and relative humidity from 10 – 90%.
The unopened single test strip configuration has a 24 month shelf life when stored
at 5-30ºC (41-86ºF) and relative humidity from 10 – 90%.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range for the In Touch Blood Glucose Monitoring System is 20-600
mg/dL. See linearity study above (section M.1.b.).

e. Analytical specificity:
The interference study was designed according to CLSI EP7-A2 guideline. Common
endogenous and exogenous interference substances were evaluated by spiking venous
whole blood (collected in tubes containing heparin) with three levels glucose
concentrations (level 1 : 40 – 60 mg/dL, Level 2: 80 – 120 mg/dL, Level 3: 300 – 400
mg/dL). The glucose samples were spiked with the potentially interfering compounds
and tested on 3 lots of test strips. Each glucose concentration was evaluated at a low
and a high concentration of the interfering substances. Bias was calculated as the
difference between the test and control concentration groups. The following tables
show the test concentrations for each potential interfering substance:

this line of product types:
Yes ___X_____ or No ________
The applicant has provided documentation that indicates the device was designed and
developed under good software life-cycle processes.
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger. The
whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.
5. Calibration:
There is no calibration required for the In Touch meter by the user. The meter is
automatically coded.
6. Quality Control:
Glucose control solutions at two different concentrations are available to be run with this
device. The meter has an algorithm to automatically recognize the control solutions to
prevent control results from being stored in the internal memory as patient results.
Recommendations on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. The
control solution readings are not included in the average of the patient results. An
acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test strip vial label. The user is
cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these ranges.

Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
P . “Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study:
The sponsor performed hematocrit studies using 8 different hematocrit levels (20, 25, 29,
40, 50, 61, 66, and 71%) spiked with glucose to generate 4 blood glucose concentrations
(50 mg/dL, 100 mg/dL, 275 mg/dL, and 525 mg/dL) at each hematocrit level. Each
sample was measured in replicates of four on three test strip lots using 5 In Touch meters.
Results were compared to YSI 2300 STAT Glucose Analyzer results. The result
demonstrated adequate performance to support the claimed hematocrit range of 20 –
70%.
2. Temperature and Relative Humidity Study:
The sponsor performed an Operating Conditions study, using venous blood samples at
concentrations of 50 mg/dL, 100 mg/dL, and 525 mg/dL on three test strip lots tested at 7
combined temperature and relative humidity conditions (5ºC/10% RH, 21 ºC/ 10% RH,
45 ºC/10%, 5 ºC/90% RH, 21 ºC/ 90% RH, 45 ºC/ 90% RH, and 21 ºC/ 45% RH). Each
sample was compared to the YSI reference method. The results demonstrate that accurate
readings can obtained after exposure to temperatures ranging from 5 - 45ºC and relative
humidity conditions ranging from 10 – 90%.
3. Infection control:
The device system is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies
were performed on the materials comprising the meter by an outside commercial testing
laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the
chosen disinfectant, Dispatch Hospital Cleaner Disinfectant Towels with Bleach
disposable wipes (EPA Reg. No. 56392-8). Robustness studies were performed by the
sponsor demonstrating no change in performance or external materials of the meter after
1,825 times of cleaning and disinfection cycles, using Dispatch Hospital Cleaner
Disinfectant Towels with Bleach disposable wipes, to simulate 5 years of use by lay
users. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and
disinfection procedures.
4. Customer support is available 24 hours per day, 365 days per year by calling 1-800- 945-
4355.
5. Electromagnetic Compatibility:
The Sponsor provided documentation certifying that electromagnetic testing (EMC) had
been performed. Testing was found to be adequate for the In Touch Blood Glucose
meter.
6. Altitude Study:
This study was conducted at a single site to evaluate the effect of altitude. The tested
glucose range (obtained using YSI reference method) was from 41.7 to 567 mg/dL at sea
level and 35.7 to 525 mg/dL at 8,516 ft. above sea level. Fingerstick blood samples were
collected and compared to the YSI analyzer reference value. Each test strip glucose value
was compared to the YSI method and then analyzed as a percent bias. The glucose values
12

--- Page 13 ---
obtained had acceptable biases to support the altitude claim of 8,516 feet.
7. Sample volume study:
A sample volume study was performed to demonstrate that 0.8µL of whole blood is
sufficient volume for the blood glucose meter system. For this study, sample volumes
ranging from 0.4µL – 1.0 µL were evaluated using three different lots of test strips. The
blood glucose sample results collected were compared with glucose values obtained with
the YSI reference method and supported the minimum sample volume claim of 0.8 µL.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
