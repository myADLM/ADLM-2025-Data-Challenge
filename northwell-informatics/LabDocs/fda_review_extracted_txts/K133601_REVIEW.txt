L. Test Principle:
The ADVIA Centaur Intact PTH assay is a two-site sandwich immunoassay using
direct chemiluminometric technology. PTH in the sample reacts with the first
antibody (in the Lite Reagent) which is a polyclonal goat anti-human PTH (N-
terminal 1–34) antibody labeled with acridinium ester. This complex is then captured
by the solid phase (a second antibody which is a biotinylated polyclonal goat anti-
human PTH (39–84 region) antibody that is preformed to streptavidin coated
paramagnetic latex particles [Solid Phase]). Unbound materials are then removed by
washing. Acid Reagent and Base Reagent are then added to initiate the
chemiluminescent reaction. A direct relationship exists between the amount of PTH
present in the patient sample and the amount of relative light units (RLUs) detected
by the system.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Assay imprecision (within run and total) was performed as recommended in
CLSI EP5-A2. Seven samples (4 human plasma and 3 controls) with
concentrations that spanned the measuring range of the device were tested in
duplicate using two runs per day for twenty days. The results are summarized
below.

Control 3 663 2.2 2.8
Pool 3 839 3.0 3.9
Pool 4 1698 2.3 3.2
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated following the guidelines of CLSI EP06-A. High and
low concentration samples were mixed to prepare samples at 12 test
concentrations and tested with the device. Results are summarized below:

The regression statistics for the linearity study were as follows:
y= 0.98x – 4.98, R = 1.00
These results demonstrate linearity across the claimed measuring range of the
device (6.3 – 1900 pg/mL).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The ADVIA Centaur Intact PTH assay standardization is maintained with
internal standards manufactured using purified human iPTH (1-84); values
have been assigned to correlate to a commercially available iPTH assay.
Calibrators and controls were previously cleared in k020217
On-board stability for the ADVIA Centaur Intact PTH assay was established
by real time studies on the ADVIA Centaur XP system. The stability study
protocol and the acceptance criteria have been found acceptable. The on board
stability of the reagent is 28 days with a calibration interval of 14 days. The
ADVIA Centaur Intact PTH assay reagent is stable until the date printed on
the label when stored at 2-8˚C.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Detection (LoD), and the Limit of
Quantitation (LoQ) were calculated per CLSI EP17-A2. The LoB was
calculated nonparametrically. The LoQ was estimated as the dose
corresponding to 20% Total CV using the precision profile method.
A single experimental design was used to generate the data for LoB, LoD &
LoQ. Five test samples were prepared by spiking analyte into diluent and/or

diluting plasma samples to obtain the following approximate concentrations:
1, 2, 5, 10, and 15 pg/mL. These samples were tested at n=6 x 2 instruments x

Interference
Interference testing for endogenous substances and biotin was performed
following the guidelines of CLSI EP07-A2. Two patient plasma pools, with
endogenous iPTH concentrations of ~20 pg/mL and ~200 pg/mL were spiked
with each interferent. Neat samples and spiked samples were tested at the
concentrations shown in the results table below. The sponsor defines non-
significant interference as a difference of less than or equal to 10% between
the spiked and the control samples. Results of non-significant interference are
summarized in the table below.

significant interference

Cross Reactivity
Cross reactants were tested by spiking each compound into a sample without
iPTH and a sample with endogenous iPTH concentration between 20- 70
pg/mL. The compounds tested, concentrations, tested, and % cross reactivity
calculated are summarized below:

The reference range previously cleared in 510(k) submission number k121981
was verified following the guidelines of CLSI C28-A3c. Forty (40) EDTA plasma
and 40 serum samples obtained from apparently healthy individuals (calcium and
inorganic phosphorus results within their respective reference ranges) were tested.
The samples were tested using 2 reagent lots across 4 different instruments and
verified that the reference range is unchanged with the modified device.
The package insert states the following for expected values:
The Expected Results (from 95% of the values) are:
For plasma: 13.8 to 85.0 pg/mL (1.46 to 9.01 pmol/L)
For serum: 12.4 to 76.8 pg/mL (1.31 to 8.14 pmol/L)
N. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
O. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
