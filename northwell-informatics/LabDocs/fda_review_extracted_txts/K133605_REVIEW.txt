1. Intended use(s):
The BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay performed on the BD MAX™ System is an automated
qualitative in vitro diagnostic test for the direct detection of methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) DNA from nasal swabs in patients at risk for nasal
colonization. The test utilizes real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the
amplification of MRSA DNA and fluorogenic target-specific hybridization probes for the
detection of the amplified DNA. The BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay is intended to aid in
the prevention and control of MRSA infections in healthcare settings. It is not intended to
diagnose MRSA infections nor guide or monitor treatment for MRSA infections. A
negative result does not preclude nasal colonization. Concomitant cultures are necessary
to recover organisms for epidemiological typing or for further susceptibility testing.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
The BD MAX™ System
I. Device Description:
The BD MAX™ System and the BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay are comprised of an
instrument with associated hardware and accessories, disposable microfluidic cartridges,
real-time PCR master mixes, unitized reagent strips, extraction reagents, and sample buffer
tubes. The instrument automates sample preparation including target lysis, DNA extraction
and concentration, reagent rehydration, and target nucleic acid amplification and detection
using real-time PCR. The assay includes a Sample Processing Control (SPC) that is present
in the Extraction Tube. The SPC monitors DNA extraction steps, thermal cycling steps,
2

--- Page 3 ---
reagent integrity and the presence of inhibitory substances. The BD MAX™ System
software automatically interprets test results.
The real-time PCR master mix includes 13 different primers (nine primers for SCCmec/orfX
junction, two primers for mecA, and two primers for mecC) and four different molecular
probes (two probes for 11 MREJ types, one probe for mecA, and one probe for mecC) for the
detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) DNA; two primers and one
molecular probe for the Sample Processing Control (SPC). In addition, the real-time PCR
master mix also includes two primers and one molecular probe (VIC labeled) for the
Staphylococcus aureus nuc gene encoding a thermostable nuclease. However, the VIC
channel signal is only utilized in a different assay, the BD MAX™ StaphSR (K132822), and
is not utilized by the BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay definition file for reporting MRSA
results.
Brief Explanation of the Procedure
A nasal specimen is collected and transported to the laboratory using a recommended swab
collection and transport system. The swab is placed in a BD MAX™ MRSA XT Sample
Buffer Tube. The Sample Buffer Tube is vortexed to release cells from the swab into the
buffer. The Sample Buffer Tube is placed into the BD MAX™ System and the following
automated procedures occur: The bacterial cells are lysed, DNA is extracted on magnetic
beads and concentrated, and then an aliquot of the eluted DNA is added to PCR reagents
which contain the MRSA- specific primers used to amplify the genetic targets, if present. The
assay also includes a Sample Processing Control (SPC). The SPC is present in the Extraction
Tube and undergoes the extraction, concentration and amplification steps to monitor for
inhibitory substances as well as process inefficiency due to instrument or reagent failure. No
operator intervention is necessary once the clinical sample and reagent strip are loaded into
the BD MAX™ System. The BD MAX™ System automates sample lysis, DNA extraction
and concentration, reagent rehydration, nucleic acid amplification and detection of the target
nucleic acid sequence using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Amplified targets
are detected with hydrolysis probes labeled with quenched fluorophores. The amplification,
detection and interpretation of the signals are done automatically by the BD MAX™ System.

Quality Control
Quality control procedures monitor the performance of the assay. Laboratories must establish
the number, type and frequency of testing control materials according to guidelines or
requirements of local, provincial, state and/country regulations or accreditation organizations.
1. An External Positive Control is intended to monitor for substantial reagent failure while
an External Negative Control is used to detect reagent or environmental contamination
(or carry-over) from other specimens or MRSA amplicons. External Control materials are
not provided by BD. Various types of External Controls are recommended to allow the
user to select the most appropriate control for their laboratory quality control program:
· Commercially available control materials [e.g., a reference MRSA strain (ATCC
43300) can be used as positive controls. Staphylococcus epidermidis strain (e.g.,
ATCC 12228) can be used as negative control.].
· Previously characterized specimens known to be positive or negative for MRSA.
2. One (1) External Positive Control and one (1) External Negative Control should be run
daily until adequate process validation is achieved on the BD MAX™ System. Reduced
frequency of control testing should be based on a protocol and data as determined by the
individual laboratory.
3. An External Negative Control that yields a positive test result is indicative of a specimen
handling and/or contamination problem. Review the specimen handling technique to
avoid mix-up and/or contamination. An External Positive Control that yields a negative
result is indicative of a specimen handling/preparation problem. Review the specimen
handling/preparation technique.
4. An External Control that yields an Unresolved, Indeterminate or Incomplete test result is
indicative of a reagent or a BD MAX™ System failure. Check the BD MAX™ System
and monitor for any error messages. If the problem persists, use reagents from an
unopened pouch or use a new BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay kit.
Note: External Positive and Negative Controls are not used by the BD MAX™ System
software for the purpose of sample test result interpretation. External Controls are treated
as if they were patient samples.
5. Each BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay Extraction Tube contains a Sample Processing
Control (SPC) which is a plasmid containing a synthetic target DNA sequence. The SPC
4

--- Page 5 ---
will be extracted, eluted and amplified along with any DNA present in the processed
specimen. The SPC monitors the efficiency of DNA capture, washing and elution during
the sample processing steps, as well as the efficiency of DNA amplification and detection
during PCR analysis. If the SPC result fails to meet the acceptance criteria for a negative
specimen, the result will be reported as Unresolved. An Unresolved result is indicative of
specimen-associated inhibition or reagent failure. Repeat any specimen reported as
“Unresolved”.
Results Interpretation
The BD MAX™ System software automatically interprets test results. A test result may be
called as MRSA NEG (negative), MRSA POS (MRSA positive), or MRSA UNR
(Unresolved) based on the amplification status of the targets and of the Sample Processing
Control. IND (Indeterminate) or INC (Incomplete) results are due to BD MAX™ System
failure. Results interpretation is based on the following decision algorithm:
Assay Result Reported Interpretation of Result
MRSA POS MRSA DNA detected
MRSA NEG No MRSA DNA detected
No target amplification; no SPC
MRSA UNR
amplification
Indeterminate due to BD MAX™ System
IND failure
(with Warning or Error Codes )
Incomplete Run
INC
(with Warning or Error Codes )
MRSA POS (MRSA DNA detected)
· Fluorescence signal is detected for both MREJ (S. aureus specific) and mecA/mecC
targets; and,
· The SPC is ignored since MRSA target amplification overrides this control.
MRSA NEG (No MRSA DNA detected)
· Fluorescence signal is not detected by the BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay for any target
(mecA/mecC and MREJ targets) and fluorescence signal is detected for the SPC; or,
· Fluorescence signal is detected for the mecA/mecC gene only [the mecA and mecC
genes are not unique to S. aureus species and can be found in other bacterial genera
(e.g., S. epidermidis)]; or
· Fluorescence signal is detected for MREJ only (mecA or mecC gene drop-out).
MRSA UNR (Unresolved result, No Target and SPC Amplification)
· Fluorescence signal not detected for mecA/mecC and MREJ targets; and,
· Fluorescence signal not detected for the SPC (Inhibitory specimen or reagent failure).
IND (Indeterminate result)
· BD MAX™ System failure with Warning or Error Codes.

Establishing the Performance Characteristics of Nucleic Acid-Based In vitro Diagnostic
Devices for the Detection and Differentiation of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) and Staphylococcus aureus (SA). Draft Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug
Administration Staff. Document issued on: January 5, 2011
L. Test Principle:
The BD MAX™ System uses a combination of lytic and extraction reagents to perform cell
lysis and DNA extraction. Following enzymatic cell lysis at elevated temperature, the
released nucleic acids are captured by magnetic affinity beads. The beads with the bound
nucleic acids are washed and the nucleic acids are eluted by heat in Elution Buffer. Eluted
DNA is neutralized with Neutralization Buffer and transferred to the Master Mix Tube to
rehydrate the PCR reagents. The reconstituted amplification reagent is dispensed into the BD
MAX™ PCR Cartridge. Microvalves in the BD MAX™ PCR Cartridge are sealed by the
system prior to initiating PCR to prevent evaporation and amplicon contamination.
The amplified DNA targets are detected using hydrolysis (TaqMan®) probes labeled at one
end with a fluorescent reporter dye (fluorophore) and at the other end with a quencher
moiety. Probes labeled with different fluorophores are used to detect a specific amplicon in
the SCCmec right- extremity junction (MREJ), the genes for methicillin resistance mecA and
mecC, and SPC amplicons in three different optical channels of the BD MAX™ System:
MREJ amplicons are detected in the FAM channel (475/520), mecA and mecC amplicons are
detected in the ROX channel (585/630), and SPC amplicons are detected in the Cy5.5
channel (680/715). When the probes are in their native state, the fluorescence of the
fluorophore is quenched due to its proximity to the quencher. However, in the presence of
target DNA, the probes hybridize to their complementary sequences and are hydrolyzed by
the 5’-3’ exonuclease activity of the DNA polymerase as it synthesizes the nascent strand
along the DNA template. As a result, the fluorophores are separated from the quencher
molecules and fluorescence is emitted. The amount of fluorescence detected in the three
optical channels used for the BD MAX™ MRSA TX assay is directly proportional to the
quantity of the corresponding probe that is hydrolyzed. The BD MAX™ System measures
these signals at the end of each amplification cycle, and interprets the data to provide a result.

a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision Study
Within-laboratory precision was evaluated for the BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay at
one site. This study was performed in the framework of BD MAX™ StaphSR assay
(K132822). The results from the BD MAX™ StaphSR assay were re-analyzed in the
context of the BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay, considering MRSA as the only target to
be reported.
The precision panel consisted of four categories near the LoD (i.e., Moderate Positive
MRSA, Low Positive MRSA, High Negative MRSA, and True Negative). Each
specimen contained simulated nasal matrix (2% EMD or 5% Sigma-Aldrich w/v
Mucin, 5% v/v Whole Blood, 0.8% v/v NaCl, Saline, and 0.00002% w/v Human
Genomic DNA. Refer to the “Nasal Matrix and Simulated Nasal Matrix Equivalency
Study” section of this decision summary for details). The MRSA strains used were
Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 43300 (MREJ type ii) and a Staphylococcus aureus
strain obtained from a private collection (MREJ type vii). The negative strain used in
the panels was Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990). Bacterial strains were
suspended in the simulated nasal matrix described above at the targeted
concentrations. Bacterial cell numbers in the suspensions were verified by colony
counts. The bacterial suspensions were divided into 82.5 ul aliquots and frozen at -
800C prior to testing. At the testing site, aliquots were thawed on a cooling block,
vortexed, and spun at low speed. The contents of each aliquot were completely
absorbed onto a sterile dry swab. The swab was then transferred directly into a
Sample Buffer Tube (SBT) and processed according to the BD MAX™ MRSA XT
assay instructions for use.
The bacterial strains were tested as follows:
· Moderate Positive (MP) MRSA (MREJ ii): ≥ 2 and ≤ 5 x LoD
· Low Positive (LP) MRSA (MREJ ii): ≥ 1 and < 2 x LoD
· Low Positive (LP) MRSA (MREJ vii): ≥ 1 and < 2 x LoD
· High Negative (HN) MRSA (MREJ ii): < 1 x LoD
· True negative (TN): Negative specimens (no target)
Testing was performed in duplicate, over 12 days, with two runs per day, by two
different technologists (2 replicates/run/day x 2 runs/day by two different
technologists x 12 days = 48 data points for each panel member). Precision study
results for TN, MP, LP, and HN MRSA samples demonstrated 100% (48/48, 95% CI,
92.6% - 100%), 100% (48/48, 95% CI, 92.6% - 100%), 97.9% (94/96, 95% CI,
92.7% - 99.4%) and 60.4% (29/48, 95% CI, 46.3% - 73.0%) agreement with expected
result (i.e., negative for TN and HN, positive for MP and LP), respectively.
The precision study results met the pre-defined acceptance criteria for LP, MP, and
TN samples (i.e., LP overall correct percentage of approximately 95% with 95% CI;
8

--- Page 9 ---
MP overall correct percentage of approximately 100% with 95% CI; TN overall
correct percentage of approximately 100% with 95% CI). No specific acceptance
criteria were defined for the HN samples.
Reproducibility Study
The reproducibility study was performed using the same sample categories and
testing procedures as defined above for the Precision Study. This study was also
performed in the framework of BD MAX™ StaphSR assay (K132822). The results
from the BD MAX™ StaphSR assay were re-analyzed in the context of the BD
MAX™ MRSA XT assay, considering MRSA as the only target to be reported.
Samples in each category were tested in triplicate, on five distinct days, wherein each
day two runs were tested by two different technologists, at three clinical sites using
one lot of reagents (Site-to-Site) (3 replicates/run/day x 2 runs/day by two different
technologists/per site x 5 days x 3 sites = 90 data points for each panel member). One
of these three clinical sites participated in an extended study where two additional lots
of reagents were tested in 10 additional days (Lot-to-Lot) (3 replicates/run/day x 2
runs/day by two different technologists/per site x 5 days/per Lot x 3 Lots = 90 data
points for each panel member).
For Site-to-Site Reproducibility, the overall percent agreement with expected result
(i.e., negative for TN and HN, positive for MP and LP) was 100% (90/90, 95% CI,
95.9% - 100%) for MRSA MP and TN categories; 96.7% (174/180, 95% CI, 92.9% -
98.5%) for MRSA LP; and 63.3% (57/90, 95% CI, 53.0% - 72.6%) for MRSA HN.

An External Positive Control is intended to monitor for substantial reagent failure
while an External Negative Control is used to detect reagent or environmental
contamination (or carry-over) from other specimens or MRSA amplicons. External
Control materials are not provided by BD in the BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay.
However, during the clinical trial, external controls were freshly prepared and tested
per package insert with each group of samples tested on the BD MAX™ instrument.

A failed control invalidated the entire run. In the case of a failure of either or both
external controls, the testing of all samples included in the run was repeated from the
appropriately stored SBTs along with a new set of external controls. In cases where
external controls failed again, no additional repeat testing was performed.
Refer to K132822 Decision Summary for external controls performance data
generated during the prospective clinical study for the BD MAX™ StaphSR assay.
Internal Sample Processing Control (SPC)
The Sample Processing Control incorporated into each Unitized Reagent Strip (URS)
is intended to monitor PCR inhibition as well as reagent integrity for each sample
tested. A failed SPC renders a sample result “Unresolved” (UNR). The clinical sites
were instructed to repeat all UNR samples on the next run.
Refer to K132822 Decision Summary for SPC performance data generated during the
prospective clinical study for the BD MAX™ StaphSR assay.
Nasal Matrix and Simulated Nasal Matrix Equivalency Study
Negative natural clinical nasal matrix is difficult to obtain due to the high prevalence
of mecA/mecC and nuc genes present in normal bacterial nasal flora, in a proportion
of 60-85% and 20-30%, respectively. In order to compensate for the limited
availability of negative natural clinical nasal matrix, a simulated nasal matrix was
developed for the verification and validation studies of the BD MAX™ MRSA XT
assay.
An analytical study was carried out to demonstrate the equivalency between the
natural clinical nasal matrix and simulated nasal matrix developed. This study was
performed in the framework of BD MAX™ StaphSR assay (K132822). The results
from the BD MAX™ StaphSR assay were re-analyzed in the context of the BD
MAX™ MRSA XT assay, considering MRSA as the only target to be reported.
The composition of the simulated nasal matrix is the following:
Table 9: Composition of the Simulated Nasal Matrix

Mucin 2% (EMD) or 5% (Sigma-Aldrich) w/v
Blood 5% v/v
Saline (0.85% NaCl) 0.8% v/v NaCl (95% Saline)
Human Genomic DNA 0.00002% w/v (200pg/ul)
Note that bovine mucin from two suppliers (EMD and Sigma-Aldrich) was used in
the formulation of the simulated nasal matrix. During product development, Sigma-
Aldrich was unable to supply mucin due to placing the product on backorder. Thus,
the supplier was replaced by EDM. The suitable mucin concentration was determined
to be 2% for the mucin from EMD and 5% for the mucin from Sigma- Aldrich. The

simulated matrix containing 5% mucin from EMD was found to be inhibitory at 5%
compared to the clinical nasal matrix.
An MRSA MREJ Type ii bacterial panel (a bacterial suspension corresponding to a
target concentration of 2-3X LoD, 256 CFU/swab) was used in this study. Twelve
replicates of negative natural clinical nasal matrix and simulated nasal matrix (mucin
from EMD or Sigma-Aldrich) in SBT were tested using five BD MAX™
instruments.
Statistical analysis was performed. The Two One-Sided Test (TOST) procedure of
Schuirmann (1987) was used for assessing the equivalence of the SDPA means.
Rejection of the non-equivalence hypothesis in favor of the equivalence
hypothesis at a significance level of 5% occurred only if the 90% confidence interval
of the mean difference was contained completely within the equivalence margins
which are listed in the table below:

Data from this study were used to perform TOST equivalency analyses for FAM
mean SDPA values between clinical matrix and simulated matrix (5% and 2% mucin
supplied by Sigma-Aldrich and EMD, respectively). Data from the ROX channel
were not considered for the clinical matrix condition comparison, as the mecA/mecC
genes (detected in ROX channel) are present in a normal bacterial nasal flora.
However, the ROX channel was considered in the comparison of the simulated matrix
composition.
The mean SDPA obtained for the simulated and natural clinical matrices in the FAM
channel (5% Sigma-Aldrich mucin and 2% EMD mucin) are equivalent based on
meeting the Analytical Acceptability Criteria described above. The comparison of the
FAM and ROX mean SDPA of the two simulated nasal matrix composition showed
that the simulated matrix containing 2% EMD mucin is also equivalent to the
simulated matrix containing 5% Sigma-Aldrich mucin based on meeting the
Analytical Acceptability Criteria described above.
In conclusion, this study demonstrated that both simulated nasal matrices (5% Sigma-
Aldrich and 2% EMD mucin, respectively) developed for the BD MAX™ MRSA XT
assay are equivalent to each other and are equivalent to negative natural clinical nasal
matrix. Therefore, the simulated nasal matrices are appropriate and adequate to be
used in place of natural nasal matrix for the verification and validation studies of the
BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay.

Preservation of DNA on Collection Device
The preservation of amplifiable DNA on Liquid Stuart swabs was evaluated in an
analytical study. This study was performed in the framework of BD MAX™ StaphSR
assay (K132822). The results from the BD MAX™ StaphSR assay were re-analyzed
in the context of the BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay, considering MRSA as the only
target to be reported.
Twelve (12) methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains, 18 methicillin-sensitive
S. aureus (MSSA) strains, and 30 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus sp. (MSSsp)
strains were used in this study. The MRSA strains were of diverse geographical origin
and included MREJ types i, ii, iii, iv, v, vi, vii, ix, xiii, xiv, and xxi. For MRSA and
MSSA strains, a mix of 75 µL of simulated matrix and 7.5 ul of a bacterial
suspension corresponding to a target concentration of 2-3X LoD was used to
determine the preservation of amplifiable DNA on Liquid Stuart swabs. For MSSsp
strains, a mix of 75 ul of simulated matrix and 7.5 ul of a bacterial suspension
corresponding to a theoretical concentration of 1.30E+06 CFU/mL was tested.
Each collection (Liquid Stuart swab) was tested with 12 MRSA, 18 MSSA, and 30
MSSsp strains at baseline and under four different storage conditions using five
different instruments. The Liquid Stuart swabs were used to completely absorb 82.5
μL of the relevant bacterial suspension; the swabs were then inserted into their
respective transport tubes and stored under the following conditions:
· room temperature for at least 5 minutes (T=0)
· 25 ± 2°C for 48 hours
· 25 ± 2°C for 60 hours
· 2-8°C for 120 hours (5 days)
· 2-8°C for 150 hours
Samples were then analyzed with the BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay.
To be considered acceptable, the percentage of conforming results had to be equal to
or greater than 95%.
The percentage of conforming results met the acceptance criteria (≥ 95%), under all
storage conditions, for all strains tested.
In conclusion, this analytical study demonstrated that DNA from MRSA strains
absorbed on Liquid Stuart swabs is stable up to 60 hours at 25 ± 2°C and up to 150
hours at 2-8°C. DNA from MSSA and MSSsp strains absorbed on Liquid Stuart
swabs gave the expected negative result up to 60 hours at 25 ± 2°C and up to 150
hours at 2-8°C.

Lysis Efficiency
The lysis efficiency characterization was presented in the BD MAX™ MRSA Assay
510(k) (K120138). A lysis efficiency of ≥ 97% was obtained for the BD MAX™
MRSA Assay. Since the lysis strategy has not changed for the BD MAX™ MRSA
XT assay, no new lysis efficiency analytical study was performed.
Preservation of DNA in Sample Buffer Tube (SBT)
The preservation of amplifiable DNA in Sample Buffer Tube (SBT) was evaluated in
an analytical study. This study was performed in the framework of BD MAX™
StaphSR assay (K132822). The results from the BD MAX™ StaphSR assay were re-
analyzed in the context of the BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay, considering MRSA as
the only target to be reported.
Twelve (12) methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains, 18 methicillin-sensitive
S. aureus (MSSA) strains, and 30 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus sp. (MSSsp)
strains were used in this study. The MRSA strains were of diverse geographical origin
and included MREJ types i, ii, iii, iv, v, vi, vii, ix, xiii, xiv, and xxi. For MRSA and
MSSA strains, a bacterial suspension corresponding to a target concentration of 2-3X
LoD was used to determine the preservation of amplifiable DNA in the SBT. For
MSSsp strains, a bacterial suspension corresponding to a theoretical concentration of
1.30E+06 CFU/mL was tested.
The study was performed with 12 MRSA, 18 MSSA, and 30 MSSsp strains at
baseline and under four different storage conditions using five different instruments.
The Liquid Stuart swabs were used to completely absorb 75 μL of the relevant
bacterial suspension; the swabs were then inserted into their respective transport tubes
for five minutes. The swabs were then broken off into SBTs (three lots) containing
simulated nasal matrix. The SBTs containing the swabs were stored under the
following conditions:
· room temperature for at least 5 minutes (T=0)
· 25 ± 2°C for 36 hours
· 25 ± 2°C for 45 hours
· 2-8°C for 120 hours (5 days)
· 2-8°C for 150 hours
Samples were then analyzed with the BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay.
To be considered acceptable, the percentage of conforming results had to be equal to
or greater than 95%. Results were calculated for each time point separately.
The percentage of conforming results met the acceptance criteria (≥ 95%), under all
storage conditions, for all strains tested.
17

--- Page 18 ---
In conclusion, this analytical study demonstrated that DNA from MRSA strains is
stable up to 45 hours at 25 ± 2°C and up to 150 hours at 2-8°C after sample elution in
SBT. DNA from MSSA and MSSsp strains gave the expected negative result up to 45
hours at 25 ± 2°C and up to 150 hours at 2-8°C after sample elution in SBT.
Recovery of Methicillin-Resistant S. aureus Cells in Sample Buffer Tube
An analytical study was carried out to demonstrate that MRSA remains viable when
stored 36 to 45 hours after a BD MAX™ run (3 hours at 25°C) followed by
incubation at 2-8°C in the Sample Buffer Tube (SBT). This study was performed in
the framework of BD MAX™ StaphSR assay (K132822).
Three simulated nasal matrix lots were used in combination with three different lots
of Sample Buffer Tubes (SBT). Three MRSA reference strains representing MREJ
Type ii, iiv, and ii (PFGE USA300) were used in this study.
Cultures were prepared and diluted in order to obtain suspensions consistent with 2-
3X LoD of the BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay. The concentration was confirmed by
bacterial count. For each strain, 75 μL of cell suspension were distributed in 2 mL
tubes and absorbed with a swab.
Six swabs were spiked by absorbing a bacterial suspension of 75 μL (3 for 36 hours
and 3 for 45 hours). After the complete volume of sample was absorbed with a
collection swab, each swab was reinserted into its storage device and incubated for at
least five minutes at room temperature. Each swab was then broken in its respective
SBT (three lots) containing simulated nasal matrix. Tubes were closed and vortexed
for 1 minute. For each sample and incubation time (36 and 45 hours), a time zero
point was established using 600 μL of the suspension dispensed in 2 mL tubes pre-
incubation. All samples were then incubated for 3 hours at 25°C followed by 36 or 45
hours at 2-8°C.
To determine viability, two culture methods were used; direct culture and enriched
culture. The direct culture was performed by plating 50 μL of samples on each of the
six CHROMagar™ MRSA plates; mauve-colored colonies were considered as
MRSA positive. If plates were MRSA negative after 24 hours, they were incubated
for another 24 hours. The enriched culture was executed by adding 300 μL of samples
in a TSB NaCl 6.5% tube. Cultures with growth were then processed by following the
same steps used for the direct culture. If no growth was observed, tubes were
incubated for another 24 hours at 35°C followed by the same procedure. If MRSA is
isolated from three Direct Culture plates, the Enriched Culture may be halted.
MRSA viability was determined by the presence of MRSA on a minimum of one out
of six CHROMagar™ MRSA plates per strain by either direct or enriched culture
method.
18

--- Page 19 ---
Acceptance criteria were met all storage conditions. Growth was observed on at least
one out of six CHROMagar™ MRSA plates.
In conclusion, this analytical study demonstrated that MRSA (at 2-3X LoD of the BD
MAX™ MRSA XT assay) remains viable after storage of 3 hours at 25°C followed
by 36 to 45-hours incubation at 2-8°C in the SBT.
Reagents Shelf Life Determination
The stability of the BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay stored at 2-8°C and 25 ± 2°C was
evaluated in real-time. Testing was performed to determine the stability of the BD
MAX™ MRSA XT kit and the lysis efficiency of the extraction tube over time.
Since the reagents are exactly the same for both the BD MAX™ StaphSR (K132822)
and the BD MAX™ MRSA XT (K133605) assays, a single stability study was
performed to determine the shelf life of both assays. The results from the study were
analyzed in the context of the BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay, considering MRSA as
the only target to be reported.
Three lots of kit components (strips, Master Mix, Sample Buffer and Extraction
Tubes) were stored at 2-8°C and 25 ± 2°C. A subset of the first lot was subjected to
simulated shipping conditions prior to storage at 2-8°C and 25 ± 2°C. Components
were removed from storage at pre-determined time points for testing. Trend of the
PCR metric curves (in each channel) over time was analyzed by a linear regression
model and used to determine a stability breaking point. A stability breaking point is
defined as time point when the confidence interval (CI) of the linear regression
crosses the Allowable Drift Limits (ADL). Tolerance intervals with 95% confidence
and 99.73% coverage of the means were used to set the ADL empirically. The
tolerance interval assessment was based on a total sample size of 1088 for the POS
PCR curve parameters (SDPA and LogEP) and on a total sample size of 978 for the
NEG PCR curve parameters (SDPA and LogEP) tested at baseline (T=0). If no
significant degradation (i.e., no stability breaking point is identified) occurred over
time, the kit stability corresponds to the last tested time point.
Three lots of kit Extraction Tubes were stored at 2-8°C and 25 ± 2°C. A subset of the
first lot was subjected to simulated shipping conditions prior to storage at 2-8°C and
25 ± 2°C. Components were removed from storage at pre-determined time points for
testing. The extent of the lysis was measured by optical density and the lysis
percentage was calculated. This percentage was used to determine a stability breaking
point. A stability breaking point is reached when at least one out of three lots shows
failed results for two consecutive time points.
Shipping simulation consisted of storage in extreme conditions variations for up to 11
days. Temperature ranged from -10ºC to 40ºC and humidity varied from 10% to 70-
75% RH.
19

--- Page 20 ---
BD MAX™ MRSA XT kit stability and Extraction Tubes lysis efficiency tests were
taken into account to determine the shelf-life but were analyzed independently.
Overall kit shelf life claim is based on the least stable lot tested for the kit stability or
for the lysis efficiency (i.e., lot of BD MAX™ MRSA XT or lot of Extraction Tube).
To determine the shelf life of components in open pouches, a simulation of normal
storage conditions at customer sites was performed as the following:
1. Sealed bags of Master Mix and Extraction Tubes were stored at 25 ± 2ºC / 60 ±
5% RH for pre-determined periods of time prior to the initial opening of the
sealed bag(s).
2. The bag(s) were then unsealed and stored at 2-8ºC and 25 ± 2ºC / 60 ± 5% RH.
3. From this point on, bags were opened and closed every day.
4. Components stored at 2-8ºC or at 25 ± 2ºC / 60 ± 5% RH were tested after 7, 14
and 17 days.
The stability study is currently ongoing and available real-time data supports a shelf
life of up to eight months at 2- 8°C and/or 25 ± 2°C when Master Mix and Extraction
Tubes are stored in sealed bags.
After initial bag opening and re-sealing of the pouch, real-time data supports a shelf
life of seven days when Master Mix and Extraction Tubes are stored at 2- 8°C or at
25 ± 2°C. All other kit components are stored unsealed as per kit configuration.
Simulated shipping does not impact shelf life.
Un-reconstituted Reagents Stability outside of Protective Pouch
An analytical study was carried out to demonstrate the stability of the sealed reagents
(Master Mix and Extraction Tube) when stored for five hours at 2-8°C or 25 ± 2°C
outside of the protective pouch.
This study was performed in the framework of BD MAX™ StaphSR assay
(K132822). The results from the BD MAX™ StaphSR assay were re-analyzed in the
context of the BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay, considering MRSA as the only target to
be reported.
One methicillin-resistant S .aureus (MREJ type ii) strain and one methicillin-sensitive
S .aureus strain were used in this study. Bacterial suspensions corresponding to a
target concentration of 3X LoD were tested in this study. The study was performed
using more than five different instruments.
The Master Mix and the Extraction Tube were stored under the following conditions:
· 25 ± 2°C for 5 hours
· 25 ± 2°C for 6.25 hours
· 2-8°C for 5 hours
· 2-8°C for 6.25 hours
20

--- Page 21 ---
The swabs were used to absorb 75 µL of the relevant bacterial suspension and then
broken off into SBTs containing simulated nasal matrix. Samples were then analyzed
with the BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay.
To be considered acceptable, the percentage of conforming results had to be equal to
or greater than 95%.
The percentage of conforming results met the acceptance criteria (≥ 95%), under all
storage conditions, for all strains tested.
In conclusion, this analytical study demonstrated that un-reconstituted sealed reagents
(Master Mix and Extraction Tube) outside of the protective pouch are stable when
stored for up to 5 hours at 25 ± 2°C or at 2-8°C.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Detection (LoD) for the BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay was determined in an
analytical study. This study was performed in the framework of BD MAX™ StaphSR
assay (K132822). The results from the BD MAX™ StaphSR assay were re-analyzed
in the context of the BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay, considering MRSA as the only
target to be reported.
Positive specimens were prepared by soaking swabs in a wide range of MRSA
bacterial suspensions prepared and quantified from cultures. The tested strains
included 11 MRSA strains representing 11 MREJ genotypes (i, ii, iii, iv, v, vi, vii,
ix, xiii, xiv and xxi) corresponding to five SCCmec types (I, II, III, IV and XI). The
swabs were then eluted in simulated nasal matrix (Refer to the “Nasal Matrix and
Simulated Nasal Matrix Equivalency Study” section of this decision summary for
details). Each MRSA strain was tested in replicates of 24 per concentration by two
different operators using three different production lots of the BD MAX™ MRSA
XT assay. LoDs, defined as the lowest concentration at which 95% of all replicates
tested positive, were determined using a statistically based methodology. This
methodology allows determination of the LoD with a 95% confidence interval.
Specifically, the LoD results were determined using a statistical linear logistic
model that describes the relationship between the probability of the response and
the bacterial concentration. This method models the positive response (expressed in
percentage) as a function of Log (CFU/swab). The logistic model equation for the
fitted curve allows the computation of the LoD by inverse prediction using the
parameter estimates and their 95% confidence interval.

e. Analytical reactivity:
An analytical inclusivity study was performed using a variety of MRSA strains,
taking into account geographic origin, MREJ genotype (wild type and mutant),
SCCmec type, Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) type, temporal diversity and
susceptibility pattern. This study was performed in the framework of BD MAX™
StaphSR assay (K132822). The results from the BD MAX™ StaphSR assay were re-
analyzed in the context of the BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay, considering MRSA as
the only target to be reported.
Seventy-seven (77) MRSA strains from 27 countries were tested at a concentration
equivalent to 2-3X LoD in this study, including strains from public collections and
from well-characterized clinical isolates, including Vancomycin-Resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) and Vancomycin Intermediate Staphylococcus
aureus (VISA) strains.

- Strains isolated over 49 years (ranging from 1960 - 2009) representing
temporal diversity
- Strains representing 27 countries, geographical diversity
- Strains displaying additional resistance to Vancomycin (VISA and
VRSA)
f. Challenge Study:
An additional analytical study was carried out to evaluate the analytical performance
of the BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay using a well characterized challenge strain panel.
The objective of this study was to determine the assay results obtained with a
challenge strain panel containing MRSA strains with high and low oxacillin MICs,
including PFGE types USA 100 to 800, 1000, PFGE type IV/IBERIAN and mecC
variant LGA251 strain, BORSA, MSSA and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus

epidermidis (MRSE) strains using the BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay.
This study was performed in the framework of BD MAX™ StaphSR assay
(K132822). The results from the BD MAX™ StaphSR assay were re-analyzed in the
context of the BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay, considering MRSA as the only target to
be reported.
The challenge strain panel used in this study was composed of 17 MRSA, four
BORSA, one MRSE and five MSSA strains. All these strains were tested with FDA-
cleared methods for determination of the MIC. The MRSA strains were all tested
using the BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay at 2-3X LoD. The MSSA, BORSA and
MRSE (non-MRSA) strains were all tested at high concentrations (approximately 106
CFU/swab).

In conclusion, all strains tested as part of the Challenge Study exhibited the expected
results with the BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay. All MRSA strains tested as part of the
Challenge Study with the BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay exhibited MRSA POS results
when tested at 2-3X LoD concentrations. The MRSE, BORSA and MSSA strains
tested exhibited MRSA NEG results when tested at high concentrations.
g. Analytical Specificity:
The BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay was performed on samples containing high levels
of non-target organisms and MSSA strains, using the BD MAX™ System, to
demonstrate the specificity of the assay for detection of MRSA.
This study was performed in the framework of BD MAX™ StaphSR assay
(K132822). The results from the BD MAX™ StaphSR assay were re-analyzed in the
context of the BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay, considering MRSA as the only target to
be reported.
The analytical specificity study testing included the following:
· Fifteen (15) empty cassette variant MSSA strains tested at ≥106 CFU/swab
· Fifty-seven (57) strains of various non-staphylococcal species tested at a
concentration of ≥106 CFU/mL (except for Cryptococcus neoformans which
was tested at 3x105 CFU/swab, the highest concentration achieved)
· Forty-five (45) Coagulase-Negative staphylococcal strains (CoNS) and
Coagulase-Positive staphylococcal strains (CoPS) representing 28 species
were tested at a concentration of 0.5 McFarland with the BD MAX™ MRSA
XT assay.
· Fifty (50) MSSA strains tested at high concentrations (≥106 CFU/swab)
· Seventeen (17) viruses representing 12 different viral species tested at ≥ 105
PFU/mL

Most of the substances in the table above were available in a ready-to-use liquid or
gel format and were used full strength in this study. Certain substances (e.g., Mucin,
Chloraseptic®, Relenza®, Tobramycin) were rehydrated, dissolved or resuspended at a
biologically or medically relevant concentration prior to use in this study. Fresh blood
was obtained from a blood donor center.
For liquid substances, the volume tested was 75 µL since this volume represents the
maximum volume that could theoretically be absorbed by a swab. For gel substances,
swabs were coated with the substance. In both cases, the weight of each substance
was considered as the maximum weight likely to be present on a nasal swab
specimen. For substances available in a ready-to-use format, the actual amount of
active ingredient used (g or %) was calculated based on documentation provided by
the individual manufacturers.
MRSA negative samples and MRSA positive samples at 2-3 x LoD in simulated nasal
matrix (Refer to the “Nasal Matrix and Simulated Nasal Matrix Equivalency Study”
section of this decision summary for details) were tested with the highest amount of
each substance or organisms likely to be found at the sampling site or on the nasal
swab sample.
For each potentially interfering substance and for potential microbial interference
assessment, at least 95% conforming assay results had to be obtained. In addition,
equivalence had to be demonstrated between the conditions tested and the controls
based on the statistical analyses as described below:
The two one-sided tests (TOST) procedure of Schuirmann (1987) was used to assess
the equivalence of the SDPA means. Rejection of the non-equivalence hypothesis in
favor of equivalence hypothesis at a significance level of 5% occurred only if the
90% confidence interval of the mean difference was contained completely within
predetermined the equivalence margins below:
Table 22: Equivalence Margins for BD MAX™ MRSA XT Assay
Equivalence Margin
FAM SDPA (MRSA) ± 6%
With and Without Potentially
ROX SDPA (MRSA) ± 6%
Interfering Substance
Cy5.5 SDPA (Neg) ± 4%
Testing results that did not comply with these acceptance criteria were indicative of a
potentially interfering substance.
The Potentially Interfering Substances Study results demonstrated no reportable
interference (based on the acceptance criteria described above) with any

microorganisms or chemical substances tested, except for Tobramycin, which showed
inhibition in the BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay when tested at a concentration of 4.5 x
10-3 g/swab.
In conclusion, none of the potentially interfering microorganisms or chemical
substances at the concentrations tested in this study interfered with the BD MAX™
MRSA XT assay, except for Tobramycin at 4.5 x 10-3 g/swab. Tobramycin is reported
as an interfering substance in the product package insert.
i. Potential Microbial Competitor Study:
Low Loads of MRSA Co-Spiked with MRSE
An analytical study was performed to assess any potential competitive inhibitory
effects of increasing concentrations of MRSE when co-spiked with low loads of
MRSA.
This study was performed in the framework of BD MAX™ StaphSR assay
(K132822). The results from the BD MAX™ StaphSR assay were re-analyzed in the
context of the BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay, considering MRSA as the only target to
be reported.
MRSA MREJ Type ii and MRSA MREJ Type iv strains were tested at 1-2X LoD in
simulated nasal matrix (Refer to the “Nasal Matrix and Simulated Nasal Matrix
Equivalency Study” section of this decision summary for details), with increasing
concentrations of a co-spiked MRSE strain. The experimental testing conditions of
the study were summarized in the three tables below:

In conclusion, competitive inhibitory effects were observed for an MRSA : MRSE
ratio of 1 : ≥ 1 x 103 . These observed competitive inhibitory effects are reported in
the product package insert.
Low Loads of MRSA Co-Spiked with MSSA
An analytical study was performed to assess any potential competitive inhibitory
effects of increasing concentrations of MSSA when co-spiked with low loads of
MRSA.
This study was performed in the framework of BD MAX™ StaphSR assay
(K132822). The results from the BD MAX™ StaphSR assay were re-analyzed in the
context of the BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay, considering MRSA as the only target to
be reported.
MRSA MREJ Type iv, an MREJ type with one of the lowest LoDs of the assay, was
tested at 1-2X LoD in simulated nasal matrix (Refer to the “Nasal Matrix and
Simulated Nasal Matrix Equivalency Study” section of this decision summary for
details), with increasing concentrations of a co-spiked MSSA strain. The
experimental testing conditions of the study were summarized in the table below:

To be considered to be “no competitive inhibitory effect observed” for this study,
≥ 95% of expected results had to be obtained when the MRSA strain was tested near
the LoD in the presence of MSSA, the potential microbial competitor.

j. Carry-Over Study:
A study was conducted to evaluate the risk of carry-over contamination with the
BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay on the BD MAX™ instrument.
This study was performed in the framework of BD MAX™ StaphSR assay
(K132822). The results from the BD MAX™ StaphSR assay were re-analyzed in the
context of the BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay, considering MRSA as the only target to
be reported.
The testing panels used in this study were made of high positive MRSA members
and negative members with or without simulated nasal matrix (Refer to the “Nasal
Matrix and Simulated Nasal Matrix Equivalency Study” section of this decision
summary for details).
Carry-Over without Simulated Nasal Matrix
The MREJ type with the lowest LoD in absence of simulated nasal matrix (MREJ
Type iv MRSA strain) was used as the high positive panel member (8 X 107
CFU/swab). ID Broth was used as the negative panel member. Twelve (12) replicates
of the high positive panel member and 12 replicates of the negative panel member
were tested in each run; high positive and negative panel members were alternated
sequentially in each run. Three operators performed three consecutive runs for a total
of nine runs of 24 samples per run (i.e., 108 expected MRSA negative results).

Carry-Over with Simulated Nasal Matrix
The MREJ type with the lowest LoD in the presence of simulated nasal matrix
(MREJ Type xiii MRSA strain) was used as the high positive panel member (5.3 X
107 CFU/swab). ID Broth was used as the negative panel member. Twelve (12)
replicates of the high positive panel member and 12 replicates of the negative panel
member were tested in each run; high positive and negative panel members were
alternated sequentially in each run. Three operators performed three consecutive runs
for a total of nine runs of 24 samples per run (i.e., 108 expected MRSA negative
results).
The pre-determined acceptance criterion for this study is less than 2% false positive
rate (point estimate) due to MRSA contamination.
Two MRSA false positive results were obtained during the carry-over study in
absence of simulated nasal matrix. One MRSA false positive result was obtained
during the carry-over study in presence of simulated nasal matrix.
Overall, from 210 reportable results out of 216 expected MRSA negative results,
three false MRSA positive results were obtained (3/210, 1.4%; 95% CI, 0.5% -
4.1%) in this study due to carry-over contamination, which met the pre-determined
acceptance criterion for this study.
k. Assay cut-off:
BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay cut-off values (see the table below) were determined in
verification experiments in the framework of BD MAX™ StaphSR assay (K132822).
Table 30: MAX™ MRSA XT Assay Cut-off Values
Cut-off FAM ROX Cy5.5
SDPA Min 10 10 25
SDPA Max 42 42 37
EP Min 156 300 236
The cut-offs of the BD MAX™ StaphSR assay were initially established through a
series of internal analytical studies and verified through a clinical simulation as
described below:
Cut-offs were initially set using an approach based on (but not limited to) the Process
performance index (Ppk). The main idea behind cut-off determination was to vary the
threshold values (cut-offs) considering the appropriate distribution for the PCR
variables (EP and SDPA). The Ppk (the estimated proportion of false positive /
negative results) was calculated in order to maximize sensitivity while minimizing
non-specific amplification detection.
39

[Table 1 on page 39]
			
Cut-off	FAM	ROX	Cy5.5
			
SDPA Min	10	10	25
SDPA Max	42	42	37
EP Min	156	300	236

--- Page 40 ---
Briefly, the EP values of negative and positives samples were modeled using spiked
simulated biological matrix samples. The interfering fluorescence from nearby
channels (“cross-talk”) was also evaluated. Finally, the cut-offs were repositioned
within a certain range and the final choice was based on expected false positive and
negative proportions. These proportions were calculated using the distribution
properties to ensure balanced and optimal sensitivity/specificity performance.
A positive result is obtained in FAM, or ROX channel when the fluorescence signal is
higher than the EP cut-off and between the SDPA lower and upper cut-offs. However,
only specific gene(s) required to correctly identify MRSA must be detected in
corresponding channels. Moreover, cut-offs were set in order to allow the Sample
Processing Control (SPC) to be predictive of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
inhibition to avoid false-negative assay results.
Variability was included in the design of experiments to ensure that cut-offs values
are suitable for true clinical specimens. Multiple instruments, reagents and simulated
nasal matrix lots were therefore included in the study design.
The assay cut-offs selected were then verified with an experiment with 100 negative
clinical specimens spiked with a low charge of MRSA MREJ Type ii and adjusted
accordingly.
The final step of cut-offs determination was to verify whether cross-talk of
amplification signal occurred.
Following these steps, preliminary cut-off values were refined for each channel.
Finally, a clinical simulation study involving 150 clinical samples was performed to
verify the adequacy of the preliminary cut-offs.
These pre-determined preliminary cut-off values were validated again using the data
collected during the clinical performance study.

--- Page 41 ---
a. Prospective Study:
Clinical performance characteristics of the BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay were
determined in a multi-site prospective study in the framework of BD MAX™
StaphSR clinical investigation (K132822). The results of the BD MAX™ StaphSR
assay were re-analyzed in the context of BD MAX™ MRSA XT assay, considering
MRSA as the only target to be reported.
Three investigational sites participated in the study. To be enrolled in the study,
patients had to be eligible for MRSA or SA testing according to institutional policies.
Eligibility requirements for targeted screening as per clinical site policies included,
but were not limited to: patients admitted into the particular healthcare system;
patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit; patients transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit; pre-elective surgery patients; and patients being admitted from long-term care
facilities. Specimens from patients previously enrolled in the study were excluded
from the enrollment.
The Comparative Reference Method consisted of direct culture complemented by
enriched culture. Enriched culture analysis was completed for all specimens that were
negative for MRSA or SA by direct culture. Presumptive S. aureus colonies observed
on selective (S. aureus) chromogenic medium were subcultured onto Blood Agar
(BA). Identification was confirmed with an agglutination test, while methicillin
resistance was confirmed by Cefoxitin disk (30 μg) diffusion susceptibility testing.
Enrichment in Trypticase Soy Broth with 6.5% NaCl (TSB 6.5% NaCl) was
completed in the event that MRSA or SA was not confirmed by the initial direct
culture method. Turbid TSB 6.5% NaCl broth was used to inoculate additional
chromogenic medium and BA plates; MRSA confirmation was performed as
described above.
Performance against the Reference Method (Direct/Enriched Culture)
A total of 2451 specimens were enrolled in the study. Of those, 94 specimens were
regarded as noncompliant per protocol criteria, and five fully compliant per protocol
criteria specimens gave final non-reportable PCR results. A total of 2352 specimen
results were used to determine the clinical performance of the BD MAX™ MRSA XT
assay.
Compared to the Reference Method (Direct/Enriched Culture), the BD MAX™
MRSA XT assay identified 93.1% of the MRSA positive specimens and 97.5% of the
MRSA negative specimens. For the population tested, this resulted in a Negative
Predictive Value (NPV) of 99.5% and a Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of 73.2%.
