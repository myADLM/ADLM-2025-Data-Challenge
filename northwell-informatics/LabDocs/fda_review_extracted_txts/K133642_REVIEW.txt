2. Indication(s) for use:
The RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for Opiates is a homogeneous time-resolved
fluorescence assay that is intended for prescription use in central laboratories only
on the RapidFRET Integrated Workstation. The assay is used to perform a
qualitative screen for Opiates at 40 ng/mL in neat oral fluid samples collected
with the RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collector. The assay is calibrated against
Morphine. This assay provides only a preliminary result. To obtain a confirmed
analytical result, a more specific alternate chemical method such as GC/MS or
LC/MS/MS is required. Professional judgment should be applied to any drug test
result, particularly when using preliminary positive results. For In Vitro
Diagnostic Use Only.
The RapidFRET Oral Fluid Calibrator Set and RapidFRET Oral Fluid Control Set
are intended for use only with the RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for Opiates and
samples collected with the RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collector. The cutoff
calibrator is used to determine the cutoff level and translate the assay
measurement into a positive or negative result. The positive and negative controls
are used to monitor laboratory systems, operators, precision, accuracy and assay
conditions. For In Vitro Diagnostic Use Only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use in Central Laboratories.
The assay is not intended for use in point-of-care settings.
4. Special instrument requirements:
For use with the RapidFRET Integrated Workstation.
I. Device Description:
Reagents:
The RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for Opiates is sold as a kit in two sizes. Each kit
consists of 96 Well Microtiter Plates (round bottom plates), Acceptor Reagent A
(Opiates specific antibody conjugated to an acceptor fluorophore in buffer with
preservative), Multi-Donor Reagent (Donor fluorophore conjugated to drug derivative
in buffer with preservative) and Matrix Blank Reagent.
The assay procedure involves mixing an antibody-acceptor reagent and sample
followed by the addition of an opiate-donor conjugate. After completion of the
mixing and incubation procedures, the plate is inserted into a plate reader capable of
time-resolved fluorescence mode and the FRET is monitored at the emission
wavelength of the acceptor. The assay utilizes a matrix blank well consisting of each
sample and competitive reagent B, and is used to correct for sample variation.
Calibrators and Controls Sets:
The Calibrators and Controls Sets are required for running the assay and are
purchased separately from the Assay Kit. The Calibrators contain synthetic oral fluid
2

--- Page 3 ---
with either no Morphine (Negative) or Morphine at 40 ng/mL (Cutoff). The Controls
contain synthetic oral fluid with Morphine at 150% (60 ng/mL) or 50% (20 ng/mL) of
the Cutoff level.
Cutoff and negative calibrators are run at the same time as the unknown samples and
are required for identifying presumptive positive and negative samples. The sample
measurement is considered preliminary positive if it is less than the cutoff calibrator
reading, and negative if it is above the cutoff calibrator reading. Controls are used to
monitor precision, accuracy and overall performance of the test system.
The RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collector for collection, transportation, sampling and
storage of a neat oral fluid sample was previously cleared under k122703. The
RapidFRET Integrated Workstation was previously cleared under k122703.

immunoassay used to detect opiates in human oral fluid. This is a ready-to-use
homogenous system that involves energy transfer between an acceptor fluorophore
labeled to an antibody and a donor fluorophore labeled to drug. The assay is based on
competition between drug in the sample and drug labeled with the donor fluorophore
for a fixed number of binding sites on the antibody reagent. When acceptor and donor
fluorophores are brought into close proximity through a binding event, energy
transfer occurs. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signal is
measured at the wavelength of the acceptor fluorophore and is inversely proportional
to the amount of drug in the sample. A Cutoff Calibrator is used to translate the
sample measurement into a positive or negative result. Controls are used to establish
and monitor precision and accuracy.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All performance testing of the RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for Opiates was
performed on the RapidFRET Integrated Workstation.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A precision study was performed using three lots of the RapidFRET Opiates
assay. Negative oral fluid pools were spiked with Morphine derived from
NIST weight traceable standards, at 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, 125%,
150%, 175% and 200% of the cutoff level. These samples were processed
through the RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collector and analyzed four times daily
over several days (from 22 to 25 days) by two laboratory operators. The drug
levels in the spiked samples were confirmed by quantitative methods, GC/MS
or LC/MS/MS. Results from one lot are presented below. Similar results
were obtained for the other lots.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable. The candidate device is a qualitative assay.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The cutoff calibrator and controls are prepared by spiking known
concentrations of Morphine into synthetic oral fluid to obtain the cutoff level
calibrator (40.0 ng/mL), and the positive (60.0 ng/mL) and negative (20.0
ng/mL) controls. The negative (0 ng/mL) calibrator is drug free synthetic oral
fluid. Calibrators and controls are prepared from primary standards
(Morphine at 1 mg/mL in methanol) purchased from a commercial vendor that
uses NIST traceable weights and specific assays, such as HPLC and GC/MS
to confirm drug levels.
Value Assignment – Calibrators and Controls
Calibrator and Control lots are value assigned during the manufacturing
process in two stages. During the first stage new lots are assayed against a
minimum of one previously accepted, released and unexpired Calibrator and
Control lot using RapidFRET reagents. During the second stage, each new
manufactured accepted lot of Cutoff Calibrator, and of both Positive and
Negative Controls is quantitatively confirmed by MS based method for target
analyte concentration, and released only if the Sponsor’s acceptance criteria
are met.
Calibrators and Controls Stability Studies
Real-time stability studies were conducted on multiple lots of RapidFRET
Oral Fluid Calibrators and RapidFRET Oral Fluid Controls. The stability
protocols for open and closed vial were reviewed and found acceptable. The
open vial and closed vial study results support the open vial stability claim of
30 days and closed vial stability claim of 12 months when stored at 2 to 8 ºC
for the RapidFRET Oral Fluid Calibrators and RapidFRET Oral Fluid
Controls.
Sample Shipment - Stability Studies
A neat oral fluid pool was spiked with Morphine to 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%,
100%, 125%, 150%, 175% and 200% of cutoff corresponding to
approximately 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 ng/mL concentration of
Morphine. Each spike was subsequently processed through a RapidEASE
Oral Fluid Collection device to mimic the actual collection process as closely
as possible. Aliquots were stored and handled according to the collection
device insert. Samples were shipped at ambient temperature (4ºC to 30ºC)
and at low to high relative humidity conditions (7% to 100% R.H.) from
California to Maine multiple times by FedEx Standard Overnight Express

over 7 to 17 days using two sets of samples (one set shipped at high R.H. and
second set shipped at low R.H.). Samples were assayed using the RapidFRET
Oral Fluid Assay for OPIATES before and after each shipment. In addition,
at various time points, aliquots were reserved and analyzed quantitatively by a
mass spectrophotometry based method. The physical integrity of the
RapidEASE sample tube was also evaluated following each shipment. The
mass spectrometric quantitative results for high R.H. and low R.H. exposed
samples were consistent with RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for Opiates
results. Percent recoveries (at various time points compared to time before
shipping) ranged from 96.2% to 107.7% and 91.5% to 107.2% for the samples
exposed to high RH and low RH conditions respectively.
Sample handling and Storage - Stability Studies
Conditions for oral fluid sample handling and storage were evaluated by
preparing oral fluid samples with Morphine from approximately 0% Cutoff (0
ng/mL) to 200% Cutoff (80 ng/mL) in approximately 25% increments.
Samples were processed through RapidEASE oral fluid collection devices and
stored under various conditions including room temperature (21ºC to 28ºC)
for 14 days, refrigerated (3ºC to 7ºC) for 59 days, and frozen (-10ºC to -25ºC)
for 294 days (MS data) and for 383 days (by RapidFRET Oral Fluid Assay for
Opiates). Samples were periodically sampled and analyzed by RapidFRET
Oral Fluid Assay for Opiates and mass spectrometry. For each storage
condition two sets of spiked samples of 9 levels each were prepared and
analyzed in tandem. Frozen storage studies are ongoing. Percent recoveries
ranged from 89.3% to 108.2% after storage at room temperature for 14 days,
92.8% to 104.4% after 59 days of refrigeration, and 93.0% to 102.8% freezing
for 294 days. Based on the sample handling and storage study results, the
sponsor has included the following statement in the labeling, “Room
temperature storage for up to 7 days, refrigerated storage (2ºC to 8ºC) up to 30
days and frozen storage (-10ºC to -25ºC) for up to 12 months.”
Sample Recovery Study
Recovery studies were conducted by aliquoting neat, human oral fluid pool
into glass tubes and spiking with Morphine to achieve concentrations ranging
from 0% of cutoff (0 ng/mL) to 200% of cutoff (80 ng/mL) in replicates of
five for each level in increments of 25% (10 ng/mL). Approximately half of
the volume of each of these ‘PRE-RapidEASE’ samples was then removed
and processed through a new RapidEASE Oral Fluid collector, mimicking as
closely as possible the actual sample collection protocol, resulting in a ‘PRE-
RapidEASE’ sample. The concentration of Morphine in both the PRE-
RapidEASE and the POST-RapidEASE samples for each spike level were
measured by Mass Spectrometry. The results are summarized below:

e. Analytical specificity:
An analytical specificity study of the assay to evaluate the interference from
non-structurally and structurally related compounds was performed. The
study design and results are described below.
Non-Structurally Related Compounds
Potential interference from structurally unrelated drugs and metabolites were
evaluated by spiking these compounds at high concentrations in pooled
negative oral fluid and in pooled oral fluid spiked with morphine at ± 50% of
the cutoff. No interference was observed with the following structurally
unrelated compounds when tested up to a concentration of 30,000 ng/mL. 11-

over-the-counter medications, tobacco products, dental products, etc. that may
be present in the oral fluid samples. Aliquots of a neat oral fluid pool were
spiked with the potential interferents (at concentrations shown in the table
below) and with morphine at ± 50 % of the Cutoff level, processed through a
RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collector, and screened using the candidate device.
Results showed that all samples spiked at 50% of cutoff tested negative, and
all samples spiked at 150% of cutoff tested positive.

f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs analytically around the claimed
cutoff concentration of 40 ng/mL Morphine is described in the precision
section, M.1.a. above.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Neat oral fluid was collected with the RapidEASE Oral Fluid Collector from
volunteers potentially positive and negative for various opiates. Samples were
handled according to RapidEASE protocols including 7 days at ambient
temperature (including shipping), refrigerated for up to 30 days and then
frozen at -10 ºC to -25 ºC until testing. The samples were randomized and
blinded to the instrument operator and assayed using the candidate device and
the comparative mass spectroscopy (MS) based quantitative methods. A total
of 245 samples were analyzed by MS-based methods for opiate content
(including morphine, codeine and hydrocodone). Summary data based on
opiate content of the samples is presented in the table below:
