I. Device Description:
The GSP Neonatal Total Galactose kit contains sufficient reagents to perform 1152 assays.
The kit contains the following components:
· Calibrators have been prepared from human red blood cells enriched with galactose, and
with ProClin 300 as preservative. The hematocrit value is 50 - 55 % to correspond to a
hematocrit of a newborn. The calibrators have been calibrated against primary calibrators
gravimetrically prepared using a U.S. Pharmacopeia Reference Standard Preparation for
galactose. 6 levels of calibrators are included: A – 0.5 mg/dL, B – 2.5 mg/dL, C – 5.0
mg/dL, D – 10.0 mg/dL, E – 20 mg/dL, F – 50 mg/dL
· Controls have been prepared from human blood enriched with galactose and galactose-1
phosphate, and with ProClin 300 as preservative. Prior to dispensing the blood onto the
filter paper, the hematocrit value of blood used in the controls preparation is adjusted to
50 - 55 % to correspond to a hematocrit of a newborn. The low control is approximately
4.0 mg/dL and the high control approximately 12 mg/dL.
· Neonatal Total Galactose Assay Reagent 1 (trehalose, N-(2-acetamido)-2-
aminoethanesulfonic acid (ACES), 10-Acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine, 4-
hydroxyphenylacetic acid, horseradish peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase from bovine
erythrocytes) – 3 lyophilized vials
· Neonatal Total Galactose Assay Reagent 2 (cupric sulfate (< 0.02 %), trehalose, ACES,
galactose oxidase from Dactylium dendroides, and alkaline phosphatase from bovine
intestine.)– 3 lyophilized vials
· Neonatal Total Galactose Assay Buffer (ACES and ProClin® 300) – 3 bottles, 40 ml
2

--- Page 3 ---
· Neonatal Total Galactose Assay Reconstitution Solution (dimethyl sulfoxide and water)–
1 bottle, 20 ml
· Neonatal Extraction Solution (zinc sulfate (< 2 %) and 2-propanol (~40 %)) – 1 bottle, 60
ml
All human source materials used in the preparation of kit components were tested and found

--- Page 5 ---
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The study was performed using three lots of the GSP Neonatal Total Galactose kit,
three operators, and three GSP instruments in 54 runs on 21 operating days using 7
dried blood spot samples. The samples PS2-PS7 were prepared by spiking galactose
and galactose-1-phosphate with equimolar concentrations into heparinized whole
blood. In PS1 washed human red blood cell concentrate was used to minimize
endogenous total galactose. The hematocrit value of the blood used in the sample
preparation was adjusted to 40-55 % and dried blood spots were prepared. The
precision of GSP Neonatal Total Galactose kit were calculated with a full calibration
curve in duplicate for each plate. Two plates were used with 4 replicates of each
sample tested. Precision results are summarized in the tables below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The claimed measuring range for the GSP Neonatal Total Galactose kit is 1.15 – 50
mg/dL based on the Limit of Quantitation (see d. below) and Linearity studies.
The linearity was assessed in this study following the principles described in CLSI
EP6-A: Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures: A
Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline. The study used one kit lot and one GSP
instrument. A full calibration curve in duplicate was included in the plate. Each
sample and control were measured in four replicates, the samples were positioned in a
random order on the plate.
The samples used were dried blood spot specimens prepared from heparinized whole
blood. Blood drawn from one apparently healthy adult represented a “high activity”
sample. The hematocrit value of the blood was adjusted to 40% - 55% to correspond
to the hematocrit of neonates. This unspiked blood represented a “low concentration”
sample. A part of the blood was separated and equimolar concentrations of galactose
and galactose-1-phosphate were added to obtain a “high concentration” total
galactose sample. Samples with intermediate concentrations were prepared by mixing
the “low concentration” TGAL sample with the “high concentration” sample.

A polynomial evaluation of linearity was used for the data analysis.
The significance of the second and third order polynomials were evaluated by
performing a t-test. The regression analysis results showed that the second order
polynomial had statistically significant non-linear terms (β2). Thus, the second order
model was compared with the linear model.
The measured TGAL concentrations are compared to the expected concentrations. A
regression analysis was performed (measured vs. expected TGAL concentration), the
fitted regression model is:
y = 0.96x – 1.11 (R2 = 0.99)
where y = Measured TGAL concentration (mg/dL)
and x = Expected TGAL concentration (mg/dL).
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: There is no available internationally accepted reference material or a
reference method for total galactose. The calibration of the GSP Neonatal Total
Galactose kit has been traceable to the in-house reference calibrator series (primary
calibrators). The reference calibrator series include six levels, A-F, as dried blood
spots on filter paper. The reference calibrators have been manufactured using adult
human blood (endogenous biotinidase activity in serum) and washed red blood cells
as blood matrices.
Value assignment: The in-house reference materials of the GSP Neonatal Total
Galactose kit include primary calibrators, secondary calibrators, level calibrators 1-4,
QA controls Low and High “component” stage calibrators (Component Calibrators)
and controls (Component QC) and, final “kit configuration” or combination
assignment of the kit calibrators (Kit Cals) and kit controls (Kit QC). The primary
calibrators are used to monitor the level of secondary calibrators and level calibrators.
An initial primary calibrator lot is prepared adding gravimetrically determined
amounts of Galactose to human red blood cell matrix (washed red blood cell
concentrate in sucrose solution). The final concentrations of the manufactured GSP
Neonatal Total Galactose primary calibrators are based on gravimetrically determined
amounts of added galactose taking into account the endogenous level of the blood
suspension. Kit calibrators and controls are value-assigned using an internal
procedure, with testing using multiple replicates on multiple instruments
Kit calibrator contains 6 levels of calibrators: A – 0.5 mg/dL, B – 2.5 mg/dL,
C – 5.0 mg/dL, D – 10.0 mg/dL, E – 20 mg/dL, and F – 50 mg/dL.
Kit control contains 2 levels of controls: Level 1= 4.0 mg/dL, Level 2= 12.0 mg/dL.

Stability: The results of the accelerated and real time stability studies support a shelf
life of at least 12 months for all components of GSP Neonatal Total Galactose kit,
when stored at +2 to +8°C (Assay Reagent 1, Assay Reagent 2, Assay Buffer,
Reconstitution Solution and Extraction Solution) or at -30 to -16°C (kit calibrators
and controls). After opening, the Kit Calibrators and Controls should be stable at 2 to
8 °C for 7 days. Neonatal Extraction Solution can be stored on-board in the reagent
storage carousel of the GSP instrument for up to 14 days. Assay Reagent 1, Assay
Reagent 2 and Assay Buffer can be stored on-board in the reagent storage carousel of
the GSP instrument for up to 7 days. Microplates with punched calibrators and
controls in wells can be stored on-board in the GSP instrument plate storage for 12
hours.
Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria for stability testing has been
reviewed and found to be acceptable.
Sample stability: The objective of this sample stability study was to determine the
short term stability of dried blood spot specimens spiked with galactose and/or
galactose-1-phosphate. The test was performed using different storage conditions.
The sample stability study was performed using one GSP Neonatal Total Galactose
kit lot and two GSP instruments. At the zero time point each sample was analyzed in
16 replicates (4 replicates per plate) and in the other 5 time points (1, 5, 7, 9, and 14
days) each sample was analyzed in 8 replicates (4 replicates per plate).
The nine samples were dried blood spot specimens prepared from heparinized human
whole blood spiked with either a.) galactose b.) galactose-1-phosphate or c.) equal
molar concentrations of galactose and galactose-1-phosphate. The zero time point
samples were analyzed immediately after the overnight drying while the samples for
the other 5 time points were stored after the overnight drying in various storage
conditions. The sample stability is better at 2 to 8 °C than 21°C and 35 °C, if samples
are protected from moisture.
d. Detection limit:
The objective of the study was to determine the Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of
Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) for the GSP Neonatal Total
Galactose kit. The analysis of the LoB, LoD and LoQ were performed in accordance
with CLSI document EP17-A, Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and
Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline.
The LoB study was performed using two lots, the LoQ / LoD study was performed
using three lots of the GSP TGAL kit and three GSP instruments.
Limit of the Blank (LoB): The samples for LoB study were dried blood spots
specimens prepared from washed red blood cells in sodium chloride-sucrose solution.
The samples were subjected to short term stressful environmental conditions to
7

--- Page 8 ---
decrease the endogenous total galactose concentrations of the samples and stored long
term in -16°C – -30°C. The hematocrit value was adjusted to 40-55% and dried blood
spots were prepared.
The samples were measured with two GSP Neonatal Total Galactose kit lots using
two GSP instruments. Each plate included a full calibration curve in duplicate and the
results were analyzed using a plate specific calibration curve. LoB was calculated
based on 150 repeated measurements of five blank samples per one kit lot.
Specifically, repeated measurements (n = 60/sample) were carried out for the blank
(analyte free) dried blood spot samples on filter paper. The Kit Controls Low and
High, in quadruplicates (n = 4), were included in each plate and used for run
acceptance. The five LoB samples were assayed with six replicates in ten separate
runs performed over five operating days.
The LoB for total galactose is 0.34 mg/dL (19 μmol/L), defined as the 95th percentile
of a distribution of blank samples.
Limit of Detection (LoD) and Limit of Quantitation (LoQ): The samples for the
LoD/LoQ study were prepared from washed human red blood cells in sodium
chloride-sucrose solution by spiking with equimolar galactose and galactose-1-
phosphate. The hematocrit value was adjusted to 40-55 % to correspond to the
hematocrit of neonates. The LoD/LoQ samples were spotted on to Whatman 903
filter paper (75 μL/spot), dried overnight at room temperature in a fume hood and
stored at -16°C – -30°C in sealed bags with desiccant. The LoD/LoQ samples were
measured with three GSP Total Galactose kit lots using three GSP instruments.
Repeated measurements (n = 216) were carried out using four low level DBS. Each
plate included a full calibration curve in duplicate and the results were analyzed using
a plate-specific calibration curve and a calibration curve for the batch of two plates.
The Kit Controls Low and High in quadruplicate (n = 4) were included in each plate
and used for run acceptance. Altogether 27 runs were assayed during 20 operating
days using three GSP instruments and three GSP Neonatal Total Galactose kit lots.
The LoQ is 1.15 mg/dL (64 μmol/L), defined as the lowest concentration with a total
CV equal to or less than 20 %.
The sponsor’s claimed measuring range of the device is 1.15 – 50 mg/dL.
e. Analytical specificity:
The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of potential interfering
substances in dried blood spot samples on the measurement of GSP Neonatal Total
Galactose kit. The interference study was performed in accordance with the principles
described in CLSI Guideline EP7-A2: Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry;
Approved Guideline. The study used one kit lot and one GSP instrument.
The samples were dried blood spot specimens prepared from heparinized whole blood
8

--- Page 9 ---
spiked with equimolar concentrations of galactose and galactose-1-phosphate. Three
clinically relevant total galactose concentrations (5, 10 and 15 mg/dL) were used. The
hematocrit level was adjusted to 40-55% to correspond to the hematocrit of neonates.
The control pools were prepared adding equal volume of solvent (without the
interfering substances) to the base pool as was added to create the test pools. A
paired-difference test was performed for the potential interfering substances. Both
test and control pools were analyzed within one analytical run with 12 replicates for
all substances. A bias exceeding ±15% is considered a significant interference. The
tested compounds are listed in the following table:
Tested substance Concentration with ≤15%
interference
Acetaminophen 2.75 mg/dL
Ampicillin 152 μmol/L
Ascorbate 6 mg/dL
Bilirubin (conjugated) 16.6 mg/dL
Bilirubin (unconjugated) 20 mg/dL
D-fructose 18 mg/dL
D-glucose 1000 mg/dL
D-mannose 100 mg/dL
Glutathione 3 mmol/L
HSA 30 mg/mL
Hemoglobin 102 g/L
Intralipid 250 mg/dL
NADH 100 μmol/L
The sponsor’s packages insert states:
Intralipid was found not to interfere up to added concentrations of 250 mg/dL at 5 and
10 mg/dL total galactose; and up to 375 mg/dL at 15 mg/dL total galactose. When
present above these amounts Intralipid may cause a false positive screening result for
a specimen with measured total galactose concentration close to the cut-off value.
In addition, hemoglobin in combination with elevated bilirubin concentration of 15
mg/dL was found to interfere with the assay by increasing the measured total
galactose concentration (see the table below). Therefore, hemoglobin level at 198 g/L
and above in combination with elevated bilirubin level may cause a false positive
screening result for a specimen with measured total galactose concentration close to
the cut-off value.
Hematocrit levels from 30% to 66% (Hemoglobin levels 102–230 g/L) were found
not to interfere at total galactose concentrations of 5, 10 and 15 mg/dL.
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A method comparison study was performed to compare the candidate device (GSP
Neonatal Total Galactose kit) to the predicate device (Neonatal Total Galactose kit).
A total of 141dried blood spot specimens, including newborn patient routine sample
and adult whole blood dried specimens spiked with galactose and galactose-1-
phosphate were used in the study analysis. The weighted Deming regression of the
data yields the following equation:
y= 1.16x - 0.49; 95% CI: slope (1.07; 1.26), intercept (-0.73; -0.25), N=141
The slope showed an approximate bias of 16% between the candidate device and the
predicate device; however, the purpose of this device modification was adjust the
calibration to better align with the CDC reference sample concentration target levels.
Therefore, test results from the candidate device do not, and are not expected to,
directly correlate with test results from the predicate device.
A clinical study (see Section M.3.c below) was conducted to evaluate the screening
performance between the candidate device and the predicate device using their
respective cut-offs values. The screening performance of both devices is similar (see
tables below) and found to be acceptable. The clinical screening performance, not the
method comparison results, was the basis of the substantial equivalence
determination.
