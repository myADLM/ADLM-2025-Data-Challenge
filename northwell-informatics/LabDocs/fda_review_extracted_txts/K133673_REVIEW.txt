H. Intended Use:
1. Intended Use:
The illumigene® Pertussis DNA Amplification Assay, performed on the illumipro-10™,
is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test for the direct detection of Bordetella pertussis in
human nasopharyngeal swab samples taken from patients suspected of having respiratory
tract infection attributable to Bordetella pertussis.
The illumigene Pertussis assay utilizes loop-mediated isothermal DNA amplification
(LAMP) technology to detect Bordetella pertussis by targeting the IS481 insertional
element of the Bordetella pertussis genome. The IS481 insertional element can also be
found in Bordetella holmesii and Bordetella bronchiseptica strains. Respiratory infection
with Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella holmesii or Bordetella bronchiseptica may yield
positive test results in IS481 assays. B. holmesii infection may cause clinical illness
similar to B. pertussis, and mixed outbreaks involving both B. pertussis and B. holmesii
infection have been reported. Additional testing should be performed if necessary to
differentiate B. holmesii and B. pertussis. B. bronchiseptica is a rare cause of infection in
humans. When clinical factors suggest that B. pertussis may not be the cause of
respiratory infection, other clinically appropriate investigation(s) should be carried out in
accordance with published guidelines.
Negative results for the illumigene® Pertussis DNA Amplification Assay do not preclude
Bordetella pertussis infection and positive results do not rule out co-infection with other
respiratory pathogens. Results from the illumigene Pertussis assay should be used in
conjunction with information obtained during the patient’s clinical evaluation as an aid in
diagnosis of Bordetella pertussis infection and should not be used as the sole basis for
treatment or other patient management decisions.
illumigene Pertussis is intended for use in hospital, reference or state laboratory settings.
The device is not intended for point-of-care use.

illumipro‐10™ Automated Isothermal Amplification and Detection System
I. Device Description:
The illumigene Molecular Diagnostic Test System is comprised of the illumigene®
Pertussis DNA Amplification Assay Test Kit, the illumigene Pertussis External Control
Kit and the illumipro‐10 Automated Isothermal Amplification and Detection System.
The illumigene Pertussis assay utilizes loop‐mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)
technology to detect the presence of Bordetella pertussis in human nasopharyngeal swab
specimens. The assay targets a 198 base pair sequence of the Bordetella pertussis genome
residing in a region of the IS481 insertional element sequence. Each illumigene Pertussis
assay is completed using an illumigene Assay Control/Negative Control Reagent
containing Control material, an illumigene Sample Buffer tube, an illumigene Pertussis Test
Device and Mineral Oil. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens are eluted with illumigene
Sample Buffer. Eluted sample is added to an Assay/Control/Negative Control Tube,
vortexed and heated at 95°C for 10 minutes. The heat‐treated Specimen/Control sample is
added to the illumigene Test Device. Mineral oil is added to the illumigene Test Device to
prevent evaporation. DNA amplification occurs in the illumigene Test Device.
The illumipro‐10 heats each illumigene Pertussis Test Device containing prepared Sample
and Control material, facilitating amplification of target DNA. When B. pertussis is
present in the specimen, target DNA is amplified and magnesium pyrophosphate is
generated, forming a precipitate in the reaction mixture.
The illumipro‐10 monitors the absorbance characteristics of the reaction solutions at the
assay Run Start (Signal , S) and at the assay Run End (Signal , S). The
initial i final f
illumipro‐10 calculates the ratio of S to S and compares the ratio to an established
f i
cut‐off value. The illumipro‐10 software calculates this ratio for both the TEST chamber
and the CONTROL chamber.

L. Test Principle:
The illumigene Mycoplasma assay is based on loop mediated isothermal amplification
technology (LAMP). Loop mediated amplification of DNA is accomplished by the use of
specially designed primers that provide specific and continuous isothermal amplification.
Magnesium pyrophosphate is produced as a by-product of LAMP amplification. The
magnesium pyrophosphate forms a white precipitate in the reaction solution, giving the
reaction solution a turbid appearance. Change in sample absorbance created by precipitation
of magnesium pyrophosphate indicates the presence of target DNA and is considered a
positive reaction. The absence of target DNA results in no detectable change in sample
absorbance and is considered a negative reaction.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
A Reproducibility study performed at three independent laboratories included 10-
member test panels consisting of moderately positive (n=3), low positive (n=3),
high negative (n=3) and negative (n=1) samples. Samples were prepared by
inoculating quantitated suspensions of B. pertussis strain BA-589 into a negative
matrix of flocked nylon NP swabs containing pooled negative nasal wash specimen.
Prior to sample preparation, the nasal wash matrix was determined to be negative
for B. pertussis both by culture and by the illumigene Pertussis Assay. Final
concentrations of B. pertussis for each panel member are shown in the following
table.
Final Concentration Final Concentration Expected

External Positive and Negative Controls:
External positive B. pertussis control material is sold separately in the Pertussis
External Control kit. The control includes tris-buffered solution containing non-
infectious plasmid DNA with B. pertussis target DNA inserts. The test procedure
involves pipetting 50 µl of positive control material into a Control/Negative Control
Reagent tube, vortexing, heat treating for 10 minutes, followed by addition of the
heat-treated control sample to the illumigene test device and testing in the same
manner as a patient specimen. The illumigene Assay Control/Negative Control
Reagent (without patient specimen added) is used as an external negative control.
This reagent is heat treated and added to an illumigene test device in the same manner
as a patient specimen. External controls are recommended to aid in detection of
reagent deterioration, adverse environmental or test conditions, or variance in
operator performance that may lead to test errors. External control testing is
recommended with new reagent lots and shipments of illumigene Pertussis kits and
should be performed thereafter in accordance with appropriate federal, state, and local
guidelines. The illumigene Pertussis DNA Amplification Assay should not be used
for testing patient specimens testing if external controls do not produce the expected
results. External positive and negative controls were tested a minimum of once per
day during the clinical and analytical studies performed for the evaluation of the
illumigene Pertussis DNA Amplification Assay.
Specimen Stability:
A sample hold time study was performed to support claimed specimen transport and
storage conditions. The study included testing of unpreserved NP swabs (without
transport media), swabs stored in Liquid Amies transport media (without Charcoal)
and swabs stored in Liquid Stuart transport media. Samples were prepared using
flocked nylon NP swabs and nasal wash matrix determined to be negative for B.
pertussis. Positive swabs were spiked with B. pertussis, strain BAA-589 to a final
concentration near the assay LoD (3,265 CFU/mL of nasal wash or 1.48 CFU/test).
Testing included three positive and three negative swab samples tested in triplicate
for each storage condition and transport media type (including unpreserved swabs, no
transport media).
Samples were stored at 32° C (worst case room temperature) and at 2-8°C prior to
testing with the illumigene assay. Study results yielded the expected results for all
positive and negative sample replicates stored in the following conditions stated in the
package insert:
· NP swab samples stored unpreserved, with Liquid Amies (without charcoal),
or with Liquid Stuart’s media may be held at room temperature (21‐30°C) for
up to 5 days prior to testing with the illumigene Pertussis DNA
Amplification Assay.
· NP samples stored unpreserved or with both transport medias may be stored
refrigerated (2‐8°C) for up to 7 days prior to testing.
7

--- Page 8 ---
Eluted Sample Stability:
A study was performed to evaluate acceptable storage conditions for NP swabs eluted
into each of the following elution fluids:
· Tris-EDTA (illumigene Pertussis Sample Buffer)
· Molecular grade water
· 0.85% saline
· PBS
Samples evaluated in each elution fluid included polyester swabs (aluminum shaft)
stored in transport media (both Liquid Amies without charcoal and Liquid Stuart) and
flocked nylon swabs stored unpreserved. Low positive samples were prepared by
spiking each swab/transport media combination with a negative nasal wash matrix
containing Bordetella pertussis strain BAA-589 at approximately 2x LoD (3265
CFU/mL or 1.48 CFU/test). Negative samples were prepared for each swab/transport
media combination with matrix only. The baseline sample type was flocked nylon
swabs stored unpreserved and eluted in Tris-EDTA.
Diluted sample hold time was evaluated by storing eluted samples at refrigeration
temperature (2-8°C) and at the upper limit (worst case) of room temperature (33.5°C).
Testing of positive and negative samples was performed in triplicate for all storage
conditions and for each swab type/transport media/elution fluid combination.
All positive replicates for each potential combination of swab/transport media/elution
fluid produced the expected positive results by the illumigene Pertussis Assay. For
negative samples, only one replicate of one swab type (polyester swab in Liquid
Stuarts, eluted in molecular grade water) yielded a false positive result when stored at
32°C for 25 hours. Repeat testing of 20 additional negative replicates of the same
swab type yielded the correct negative results for the same storage conditions.
In summary, the study demonstrated that polyester and flocked swabs in either Amies
or Liquid Stuart’s transport media, and eluted in Tris-EDTA, 85% saline, PBS, or
molecular grade water are stable for the claimed storage conditions of 21-30°C for 48
hours or 2-8°C for up to 7 days.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LoD) of the illumigene Pertussis Assay was determined in an
analytical study using B. pertussis strain BAA-589. Samples were prepared using
serially-diluted and quantitated organism suspensions added to a negative nasal wash
matrix (flocked nylon swabs inoculated with nasal wash determined to be negative for
B. pertussis). Organism concentrations were confirmed by colony count.
The preliminary LoD was established for each of three illumigene Pertussis kit lots by
testing 20 individually prepared replicates at several serial dilutions. Testing was
8

--- Page 9 ---
performed until a dilution for which 19 of 20 replicates produced positive results was
identified. The final limit of detection was confirmed by testing an additional 60
replicates for each kit lot with testing performed by two operators on six illumipro‐10
instruments. The LoD was determined for each lot as the lowest concentration of B.
pertussis for which >95% of replicates were positive.

e. Analytical Reactivity:
An analytical inclusivity study was performed using well-characterized
strains of B. pertussis. Samples were prepared at concentrations near the
previously determined LoD. Stocks of each organism were diluted in
saline and dilutions were spiked into negative matrix (flocked nylon NP
swabs with negative nasal wash) to obtain final organism concentrations
of 3,265 CFU/mL or 1.48 CFU/test. Three replicates were tested for each
strain.
The following eight B. pertussis strains gave positive results for all
replicates tested:
B. B. pertussis ATCC 12743 B. pertussis ATCC 53894
B. B. pertussis ATCC 8478 B. pertussis ATCC 10380
B. pertussis ATCC 8467 B. pertussis ATCC 12742
B. pertussis ATCC 9797 B. pertussis A639
The following two B. pertussis strains initially gave positive results for
two of three replicates tested at organism concentrations of 3,265
CFU/mL. Additional testing at a higher concentration of 3,500 CFU/mL
yielded 100% detection of sample replicates.

f. Analytical specificity
In order to demonstrate the analytical specificity of the illumigene Pertussis DNA
Amplification Assay, testing was performed with samples containing high
concentrations of non-target organisms that may be found in NP specimens as well as
human genomic DNA. Samples were prepared by inoculating flocked nylon NP
swabs with negative nasal wash matrix and each potential cross-reacting organism at
the following concentrations: 1 x 106 CFU/mL for bacteria and fungi and 1 x 105
TCID /mL for viruses and 200ng/μL for human genomic DNA. Samples containing
50
the following organisms as well as Negative Sample Matrix and Dilution Controls
were tested in triplicate.

Study results yielded expected negative results for all replicates of each potentially
cross-reacting organism and human genomic DNA with the following exceptions:
· Strains of Bordetella holmesii and Bordetella bronchiseptica gave
positive results in all replicates tested with the illumigene Pertussis
DNA Amplification Assay. Samples containing these organisms
10

--- Page 11 ---
should be positive because they are known to carry the IS481 gene
sequence targeted by the illumigene Pertussis assay. This information
is presented in the package insert in the Intended Use Statement, the
limitations section, and the test Interpretation section.
· Unexpected results were initially observed for B. hinzii and H.
parainfluenzae. False positive results were obtained for one of three
replicates containing Bordetella hinzii and for three of three
replicates containing Haemophilus parainfluenzae. For each
organism, additional testing yielded the expected negative results for
20 of 20 replicates, demonstrating that B. hinzii and H.
parainfluenzae are not considered cross-reactive with the illumigene
Pertussis DNA Amplification Assay.
· Invalid results were obtained for two of three replicates for samples
containing Mycoplasma genitalium. Additional testing yielded the
expected negative result for 10/10 tests. Mycoplasma genitalium is
not thought to interfere with detection of B. pertussis.
In conclusion, all organisms evaluated in the cross-reactivity study are not considered to
cross-react with the illumigene Pertussis DNA Amplification Assay except for B.
holmesii and B. bronchiseptica.
g. Microbial Interference:
The same organisms evaluated in the cross-reactivity study listed in “1f” above were
evaluated for potential interference with the detection of B. pertussis. For this study,
samples containing B. pertussis ATCC strain BAA-589 with concentrations near the
assay LoD were mixed with each potentially interfering organism at high
concentrations (>1x 106 CFU/mL for bacteria and >1 x 105 TCID /mL for viruses).
50
Samples as well as Positive Sample Matrix and Dilution Controls were tested in
triplicate.
Expected positive results for B. pertussis were obtained for all organisms evaluated with
the exception of the following initially invalid results.
· Three of three samples containing H. parainfluenzae mixed with low-positive B.
pertussis gave invalid results. Repeat testing of 10 additional replicates yielded
the expected positive results for B. pertussis. As the initial results were not
confirmed, H. parainfluenzae does not appear to interfere with detection of B.
pertussis.
In summary, none of the organisms evaluated at high concentrations appear to interfere
with detection of the B. pertussis target in low-positive B. pertussis samples.
h. Interfering Substances
11

--- Page 12 ---
An analytical study was performed to assess the potential inhibitory effects of biological
and chemical materials that may be present in NP specimens on the performance of the
illumigene Pertussis DNA Amplification Assay.
Negative samples were prepared using inoculated flocked nylon NP swabs with
negative nasal wash matrix. Positive samples were prepared using the same swab
type and natural matrix with the addition of Bordetella pertussis strain BAA-589 at
a concentration near the assay LoD. Both negative and positive samples were
stored unpreserved prior to elution in sample buffer. Each potentially interfering
substance was added to eluted samples at final concentrations of 0.1 mg/mL, 1%
v/v, 1% w/v, or greater. All samples were tested in triplicate with additional testing of
any substance producing unexpected results.
The following biological substances did not interfere with the illumigene Pertussis
test results: Mucin (1% w/v), Human DNA (200 ng/µL), and Whole blood (1% w/v).
The following chemical substances, at the saturated solvent/diluents concentrations
indicated were evaluated and gave the expected results for both negative and
positive samples: Acetaminophen (10 mg/mL), Afrin® Decongestant Nasal Spray
[Oxymetazoline hydrochloride (0.0005% w/v)], Albuterol Sulfate [Salbutamol
sulfate (1% w/v)], Coricidin® HBP Cold/Flu tablets [Acetominophen (3.26
mg/mL), Chlorpheniramine maleate (0.02 mg/mL)], Diphenhydramine HCl (0.25
mg/mL) , Erythromycin (2% w/v), Mupirocin (2% w/v), Petroleum Jelly [White
Petrolatum (1% w/v)], Robitussin® Cough+Chest Congestion DM Cough Syrup
[Dextromethorphan HBr (0.1 mg/mL), Guaifenesin (1.0 mg/mL)], Suphedrine
PE [Phenylephrine HCl (0.3 mg/mL)], Saline Nasal Spray [Sodium chloride
(0.0065% w/v)], Smokeless Tobacco (snuff) (1% w/v), Tobramycin (0.6 mg/mL),
Vicks® VaporRub® [Camphor (0.48% w/v), Eucalyptus oil (0.12% w/v), Menthol
(0.26% w/v)].
Ibuprofen (10mg/mL) produced invalid results for 3/3 replicates during initial testing
of positive B. pertussis specimens; however additional testing gave the correct
positive result for 10/10 replicates. As the initial results were not confirmed,
Ibuprofen (10 mg/mL) is not considered to interfere with the illumigene Pertussis
Assay.
Aspirin at concentrations greater than 5 mg/mL was found to interfere with the
illumigene Pertussis Assay and this information is included in the product package
insert.
i. Fresh/Frozen Studies:
The clinical study included testing of both prospectively collected and tested fresh
specimens as well as archived frozen swab specimens that were eluted into either
Tris-EDTA, water, or saline prior to freezing. A fresh versus frozen study was
performed to demonstrate equivalence of eluted frozen specimens and freshly tested
12

--- Page 13 ---
swab specimens for testing with the illumigene Pertussis DNA Amplification Assay.
Samples were prepared with aluminum shafted polyester-tipped NP swabs which are
the indicated NP swabs with the lowest absorption for the illumigene Pertussis Assay.
A panel of contrived positive samples (n=35) and negative samples (n=35) was
prepared consisting of NP swabs inoculated with 35 unique negative nasal wash
specimens (negative matrix). Positive samples were spiked with B. pertussis strain
BAA-589 at low positive concentrations (1.5x LoD). The positive and negative NP
swabs were eluted by vortexing in illumigene Pertussis Sample Buffer Reagent (Tris
EDTA). All samples were tested at T prior to storing at both -20°C and -80°C.
0
Samples were frozen for a minimum of four hours prior to thawing. The panel of
positive and negative samples was tested after each of three freeze/thaw cycles for
both freezer temperatures. One positive sample gave a false negative result after the
first freeze/thaw cycle at -20C storage; however this result was not repeated for an
additional 20 test replicates of the same eluted specimen or subsequent freeze/thaw
cycles for the same sample after storage at either -20°C or 80°C storage conditions.
In summary, study results demonstrated that frozen eluted swab samples give
equivalent results to freshly tested NP swabs and are acceptable for inclusion in the
clinical studies and determination of the illumigene Pertussis DNA Amplification
Assay performance.
j. Swab Type and Transport Media Equivalence Study:
Flocked nylon, Polyester, and Rayon swab types were evaluated in an analytical
study. Each swab type was further evaluated either unpreserved, or in Liquid Amies
medium (without charcoal) or Liquid Stuart non-nutritive transport media. Negative
samples were prepared by inoculating sterile NP swabs with screened negative nasal
wash. Positive samples were prepared by inoculating sterile NP swabs with negative
nasal wash spiked with diluted Bordetella pertussis (strain ATCC BAA‐589) to
concentrations near the limit of detection for the illumigene Pertussis kit. Positive and
negative samples for all swab types and transport media combinations were tested in
triplicate.
The study yielded the expected results for all swab types and non-nutritive transport
media (and unpreserved swabs) combinations. Results confirmed equivalence of the
three swab types (Flocked Nylon, Polyester and Rayon) with the three transport
conditions (unpreserved, Liquid Amies (without Charcoal), and Liquid Stuart).
k. Assay cut-off:
The illumigene Pertussis assay is manufactured with fixed cut‐off values. The
product is designed around a pre‐selected cut‐off value and amplification reagent
concentrations are optimized to ensure appropriate reactions are obtained.
Development optimization includes evaluation of characterized positive and negative
clinical specimens.
13

--- Page 14 ---
Cut‐off values are applied in the following manner:
The illumipro‐10 calculates the ratio of the Run End (Signal final or S) reads with
f
the Run Start (Signal Initial or S) reads and compares the ratio to an established
i
cut‐off value. The illumipro‐10 performs this ratio calculation to both the TEST
chamber and the CONTROL chamber. Numerical results are not available to the user.
Fixed cut‐off values for the TEST chamber are used to report sample results. TEST
chamber Sf:Si ratios less than 82% are reported as ‘POSITIVE’; TEST chamber
S:S ratios greater than or equal to 82% are reported as ‘NEGATIVE’.
f i
Fixed cut‐off values for the CONTROL chamber are used to determine validity of
specimen test results. CONTROL chamber S:S ratios less than 90% are considered
f i
valid and allow for reporting of TEST chamber results (POSITIVE, NEGATIVE).
Specimens for which CONTROL chamber S:S ratios are greater than or equal to
f i
90% are reported as invalid and test chamber results are not reported. More stringent
cut‐off criteria are applied to the Control chamber reaction to ensure amplification is
not inhibited, reagents are performing as intended and sample processing was
performed appropriately.
Assay cutoffs for the illumigene Pertussis Assay were initially evaluated using
contrived specimens. Samples were prepared by spiking PBS buffer with dilutions
(20 CFU/mL or 40 CFU/mL) of Bordetella pertussis, ATCC strain 8467. Twenty
replicates at each concentration were tested. Results of the contrived sample study
confirmed that the previously established fixed cut‐off values are appropriate (82%
for the test well and 90% for the control well).
Additional confirmation of the assay cutoffs was performed using known positive and
negative clinical specimens from two clinical testing sites. Samples were
characterized as positive or negative by the standard of care B. pertussis testing
available at each clinical site. Finally, results from the pivotal clinical study were
used to validate the fixed assay cutoffs. In summary, illumigene test results for
clinical specimens demonstrated a clear separation for test well results between
positive and negative specimens, thus validating that the fixed illumigene Pertussis
cutoff is appropriate.
l. CarryOver Study:
A study was conducted to evaluate the risk of carry-over contamination with the
illumigene Pertussis DNA Amplification Assay test devices and the illumipro-10
instrument. Samples tested in this study consisted of alternating high positive B.
pertussis samples and negative samples both prepared using flocked nylon NP swabs
inoculated with negative nasal wash matrix confirmed to be negative for B. pertussis.
Positive samples were inoculated with B. pertussis strain BAA-589. Negative samples
contained negative matrix only. Alternating positive and negative samples were
processed in the same heat block followed by tested on the illumipro-10 incubator/reader.
A total of six runs were performed using three heat blocks and three illumipro-10
14

--- Page 15 ---
instruments. A minimum of 10 positive and 10 negative alternating samples were run on
each illumipro-10 instrument.
Results from the study showed no evidence of carryover or cross-contamination with the
illumigene Pertussis DNA Amplification Assay on the illumipro-10 system.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Not applicable
b. Matrix comparison:
Matrix Equivalency Study:
An analytical study was performed to demonstrate equivalent assay performance for
flocked nylon swabs inoculated with a negative nasal wash matrix as compared to
flocked nylon NP swab specimen matrix. Study samples were prepared using 40
paired matrix specimens collected from the same individual (nasal washes and NP
swabs). All matrices were confirmed negative for B. pertussis by both culture and the
illumigene Pertussis assay. For each matrix, testing included 20 positive and 20
negative samples. Positive samples were spiked with quantified B. pertussis cultures
(ATCC BAA-589) into eluted sample preparations at concentrations near the assay
LoD. Negative samples contained matrix only. Study results demonstrated 100%
correct positive and negative results for samples prepared with both NP swab and
nasal wash matrices. The study results support the use of a nasal wash matrix as a
substitute for NP swab specimens for preparation of analytical study samples.
Sample Buffer (Elution buffer) Equivalence Study:
In the clinical study, three different sample preparation solutions were used for
elution of NP swabs; Tris-EDTA, Saline (0.85%) or Molecular Grade Water. An
analytical study was performed to demonstrate equivalent assay performance for
different elution solutions. Samples were prepared using NP Flocked Nylon swabs
with positive samples containing organism concentrations near the assay LoD and
negative samples containing matrix only. Testing was performed using unpreserved
swabs, swabs preserved in Liquid Amies (without charcoal) and swabs preserved in
Liquid Stuart transport media. Samples were eluted in 0.5 mL of Tris-EDTA,
Phosphate-Buffered Saline, Saline (0.85%) or Molecular Grade Water and tested with
the illumigene Pertussis DNA Amplification assay. Positive and negative samples for
each elution solution/transport media combination were evaluated in triplicate. The
study yielded 100% correct positive and negative results for all replicates tested with
each elution fluid evaluated, thus confirming equivalence of the four sample elution
materials (Tris-EDTA, Phosphate Buffered Saline, Saline (0.85%) and Molecular
Grade Water).

3. Clinical studies:
The clinical study for the illumigene Pertussis DNA Amplification Assay run on the
illumipro‐10 was conducted from December 2012 to July 2013. A total of 729
qualified nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens collected from patients suspected of
having Bordetella pertussis infection were evaluated. All specimens included in the study
were originally submitted to a testing laboratory by an ordering physician specifically for B.
pertussis testing, were presumed from symptomatic patients, and were leftover and de‐identified
prior to inclusion in the study. No restrictions were placed on age, gender, or antibiotic
status. Four independent clinical test sites located in the Midwestern, Northern, Southern,
and Eastern regions of the United States participated in the device evaluation.
A total of 851 patient specimens were originally included in the clinical study of which
122 specimens were excluded from the final performance calculations due to improper
specimen storage or incomplete comparator assay testing. After exclusions, the dataset
includes 729 eligible specimens including 508 (69.7%) prospectively tested fresh
specimens, 184 (25.2%) retrospective specimens (all comers), and 37 (5.1%)
retrospective selected specimens.
The study population included 413 (56.7%) female patients and 308 (42.2%) male
patients. Gender was unknown for eight (1.1%) of the study participants. Patient age
information was known for 723 (99.2%) of patient specimens and ranged from 1 month
to 88 years. Thirty-eight (5.2%) patients were less than 1 year of age; 13 (1.8%) were
between 1 and 2 years old; 296 (40.6%) were between 2 and up to 12 years, 157 (21.5%)
were between 12 and up to 21 years, 190 (26.0%) were above 21 but below 65 years, and
the remaining 29 (4.0%) patients were above 65 years of age.
NP swabs were collected as unpreserved dry swabs or in a non-nutritive transport
medium (i.e., Liquid Stuart or Liquid Amies without charcoal). Swabs were eluted into
0.5 mL of Tris-EDTA elution buffer, saline, or molecular grade water prior to testing
with the illumigene assay. Retrospective specimens were eluted and stored at <-20°C
prior to testing. After testing with the illumigene Pertussis DNA Amplification Assay, an
aliquot of each eluted specimen was sent to an internal reference laboratory at Meridian
BioScience for comparator PCR testing.
Performance of the illumigene Pertussis DNA Amplification Assay was evaluated by
comparison to a composite of two validated real-time PCR assays followed by
confirmation of positive PCR amplification product with bi-directional sequencing. Both
comparator PCR assays targeted unique sequences within the IS481 insertional element
and neither of the comparator assay target sequences overlapped with the illumigene
Pertussis target sequence.
The comparator PCR assays included internal controls for each specimen tested as well
as external controls for each run. Validation of the comparator PCR assays included LoD
and Inclusivity studies. LoD studies demonstrated that the each PCR assay had a similar
analytical sensitivity to that of the illumigene assay and Inclusivity studies demonstrated
16

--- Page 17 ---
that the comparator assays detected ten well-characterized strains of B. pertussis.
Comparator PCR testing was performed at Meridian Bioscience, Inc. and bi-directional
sequencing was performed by a third party reference laboratory for specimens positive by
one or both comparator PCR assays. Only samples with bi-directional sequencing results
meeting pre-defined quality scores (PHRED Scores of 20 and E-values of <10-30) were
considered true positives. Specimens were characterized as positive for B. pertussis if one
or both comparator PCR assays was positive (Ct values <40) and confirmed by bi-
directional sequencing. Specimens were characterized as negative if both comparator
PCR assays were negative (Ct values >40).
Invalid illumigene results were initially obtained for 13 specimens (1.8%) and after repeat
testing, two specimens remained invalid and were not included in assay performance
calculations. Two prospective and two retrospective specimens were also excluded from
the analysis due to indeterminate results for one or both comparator PCR assays.
Performance for the illumigene Pertussis assay as compared to the composite reference
testing is shown in the following table for prospective, retrospective (all comers) and
retrospective (selected) specimens.

a Eight specimens produced false-negative illumigene results when compared to the Composite Comparator
Method. Six of the eight specimens produced detectable levels of DNA between 35 and 40 comparator assay
amplification cycles and were confirmed positive by bi-directional sequencing. Three of these six specimens gave
positive results in only one of the two comparator PCR/Sequencing assays.
b 11/13 initial invalid specimens produced valid results upon repeat testing.
False-negative illumigene results were individually evaluated at the conclusion of clinical
testing. The Cycle threshold (Ct) values produced during comparator assay testing were
above 35 for one or both comparator PCR/Bi-directional sequencing assays for six of the
eight specimens evaluated. High Ct values in PCR assays may indicate that low levels of

4. Clinical cut-off:
Not applicable
5. Expected values/Reference range:
Overall incidence of B. pertussis as detected by the illumigene Pertussis Assay in
prospectively and retrospectively collected, non-selected specimens (all comers) during
the period of this study was 8.2% (57/692).
N. Instrument Name:
illumipro‐10™ Automated Isothermal Amplification and Detection System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The illumipro-10 instrument heats each illumigene Pertussis Test Device
containing prepared samples and Control Reagent, facilitating amplification of target
DNA. When B. pertussis is present in a nasopharyngeal specimen, a portion of the IS481
Insertional Element is amplified and magnesium pyrophosphate is generated forming a
precipitate in the reaction mixture. The illumipro-10 instrument detects the change in
light transmission through the reaction mixture created by the precipitating magnesium
pyrophosphate. Specimen results are reported as Positive or Negative based on the
detected change in light transmission.
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ____X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
Specimens are identified by position. Default Sample Identification is based on Block and
Well position (e.g., Block A, Well 1). The user may input Sample Identification information
using the keypad or the optional external keyboard.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Specimens are processed manually prior to inoculation of test cartridges which are then
placed into the illumipro-10 instrument for automated amplification and detection.
