144.4, 191.0, 293.2, 440.0, and 583.2 mg/dL). Three runs were performed on each
sample, on each strip lot, with replicates of 8 for each run and test strip lot resulting in
a total of 24 replicates for each test strip lot and glucose level tested. The values from
the Performa meter were compared with those obtained from the reference method.
The results from regression analysis are summarized below:
Lot #1: y=1.038 x+3.08; R2 = 0.998
Lot #2: y=1.028 x+2.14; R2 = 0.998
Lot #3: y=1.003 x+2.8614; R2 = 0.998
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of
20 to 600 mg/dL.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
According to the sponsor, the ACCU-CHEK Performa system is traceable to the
NIST SRM 917 glucose reference material. A method comparison was performed
using the candidate device and a hexokinase method (Hitachi 917) as the reference
method (see Section 2.a.)
Value Assignment for Control Solutions and Linearity Set: The previously cleared
(k121679) ACCU-CHEK Inform II control solutions (Levels 1 and 2) and 6 levels of
the ACCU-CHEK Inform II Linearity Test Kit (Levels 1 to 6) are available for use
with the ACCU-CHEK Performa test system. The Linearity Solutions levels 2 and 4
are the same as the Control solution levels 1 and 2, respectively. Value assignment
for the control solutions and linearity set is established for the ACCU-CHEK
Performa test system and is based on the mean of repeated measurements compared
to the established target values for each level. The target values for the linearity
levels are provided in the linearity kit package insert and the control solution ranges
are printed on the test strip vial label.
Control Solution and Linearity Set Stability: Protocols and acceptance criteria for
open vial and closed vial (shelf-life) stability for the control solutions and linearity set
solutions were previously reviewed and found to be acceptable under k121679. The
labeling claims are 24 month shelf life stability and 3 month open-vial stability when
stored at the recommended storage temperatures of 39°F to 86°F (4°C to 30°C).
Labeling instructs the user not to freeze the solutions.
The protocols and acceptance criteria for the ACCU-CHEK Inform II test strips were
previously reviewed and found to be acceptable under k121679. The sponsor claims
closed-vial (shelf life) and open-vial stability of 18 months when stored at 39-86°F
(4-30°C). The labeling instructs the users not to freeze the test strips.
c. Detection limit:
The reportable range for the ACCU-CHEK Performa Blood Glucose Monitoring
System is 20 to 600 mg/dL. This range was verified by the linearity study (M.1.b).

d. Analytical specificity:
To assess potential interference the sponsor used venous whole blood samples
adjusted to 2 different glucose levels of 55 and 350 mg/dL, split into a control sample
and a test sample. Various endogenous and exogenous substances were then added to
the test sample only. The % difference between the test and control sample was
calculated and highest concentration tested at which no significant interference was
observed is presented in the table below:

The sponsor has the following limitations in their labeling:
– Lipemic samples (triglycerides) in excess of 1800 mg/dL may produce
elevated results.
– Intravenous administration of ascorbic acid which results in blood
concentrations of ascorbic acid > 3 mg/dL will cause overestimation of
glucose results.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To assess system accuracy, results from the ACCU-CHEK Performa Blood Glucose
Monitoring System were compared to a reference method, PCA-HK (Hitachi 917).
Capillary samples from 105 participants with glucose with concentrations ranging
from 34-582 mg/dL glucose obtained on the reference were measured on three test
strip lots. Samples <50 mg/dL and > 463 mg/dL were altered by glycolysis or spiking.
The results relative to reference are summarized in the tables below:

b. Matrix comparison:
Anticoagulant study:
Venous blood was drawn from ten donors having glucose levels in 5 different glucose
bins: <70, 71-110, 111-150, 151-250, >251 mg/dL. The donor blood was collected
into each of 4 vacutainer tubes (lithium heparin, sodium heparin, EDTA, and sodium
fluoride/potassium oxalate) and into vacutainer tubes containing no anticoagulant.
Each anticoagulant was tested in replicates of sixteen. Results of the study
demonstrate no significant bias when results from samples containing EDTA, lithium
heparin, or sodium heparin were compared to results from samples containing no
anticoagulant and support the use with the ACCU-CHEK Inform II system.

User Performance Study:
To assess the performance of the ACCU-CHEK Performa Blood Glucose Monitoring
System in the hands of lay users the sponsor performed a study with 192 lay user
participants. Results were analyzed by comparing blood glucose results from the
ACCU-CHEK Performa meter obtained by the lay user against the reference method
value (PCA-HK). The samples ranged from 47 to 576 mg/dL as measured by the
reference method. The results are summarized in the tables below:

N. Instrument Name:
ACCU-CHEK Performa Blood Glucose Meter
O. System Description:
1. Modes of Operation:
Each test strip is single use and must be replaced with a new strip for additional readings.
Does the applicant’s device contain the ability to transmit data to a computer, webserver,
or mobile device?:
Yes X or No .
Does the applicant’s device transmit data to a computer, webserver, or mobile device
using wireless transmission?:
Yes or No X .
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes X or No .
The applicant has provided documentation that indicates the device was designed and
developed under good software life-cycle processes.
3. Specimen Identification:
Samples are applied directly to the test strip as they are collected. The ACCU-CHEK
Performa meter memory stores up to 500 glucose test results with the time and date of the
test and up to 20 control solutions results. Individual patient results cannot be identified.
The labeling states that using memory data from meters used for multiple-patient testing
is not recommended.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
This device is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the fingertip and
venous whole blood. There is not patient identification with this system.

--- Page 12 ---
5. Calibration:
The system contains a code key included in each vial of test strips and is inserted into the
meter. The code key contains the test strip code information specific to that test strip lot
number. .
6. Quality Control:
The ACCU-CHEK Inform II Control Solutions are used as quality control checks to
make sure that the ACCU-CHEK Performa system and ACCU-CHEK Performa test
strips are working correctly. The labeling provides instructions on when quality control
testing should be performed. Once the control solution result is displayed on the meter a
control bottle symbol and a flashing L are displayed prompting the user to select the
control solution level that was used.
Control solution results are not included in the 14 and 30 day averages.
The Warning box language in the Operator’s Manual (page 29 and 41) states:
“Individual patient results cannot be identified. Using memory data from meters used for
multiple-patient testing is NOT recommended” and “Individual patient results cannot be
identified. Transferring data from meters used for multiple-patient testing is NOT
recommended”, respectively.

P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1) Hematocrit study:
The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated using venous whole blood
samples with hematocrit levels of 10 – 65% (10,15, 20, 25, 30, 43, 50, 55, 60, and 65%)
spiked with glucose to achieve target concentrations of 25, 55, 120, 350, and 500 mg/dL.
A total of 30 replicates were performed for each combination of strip lot, glucose
concentration, and hematocrit level tested. The results demonstrated that the ACCU
CHEK Performa Blood Glucose Monitoring System produces accurate results over the
claimed hematocrit range of 10 – 65%.
2) Altitude study:
To evaluate the effects of altitude on the Performa system results, venous blood samples
from three donors were altered to 5 glucose concentrations (35, 60, 160, 350 and 500
mg/dL) and tested at 10,150 feet above sea level. The meter results were compared to
those obtained with the reference method (PCA-HK; Hitachi 917). The results
demonstrate acceptable bias to the reference to support the claims in the labeling that
altitudes up to 10,000 feet have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements
from the ACCU-CHEK Performa Blood Glucose Monitoring System.

3) Temperature and humidity studies:
The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies using venous blood samples at
target glucose concentrations of 70, 120, and 250 mg/dL to evaluate temperatures ranging
from 61-95°F (16-35°C) and relative humidity from 10-80%. Combinations of the
claimed temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated and meter results
compared to a reference method. The results support the claimed range of operating
conditions: 61-95°F and 10-80% relative humidity.
4) Sample volume study:
The sponsor performed a sample volume study to support the claimed minimum sample
volume requirement for the ACCU-CHEK Performa system (0.6 mL) using blood
samples at three glucose concentrations (45, 120, 450 mg/dL). The system displays an
error code when insufficient sample is detected. Results support the claimed sample
volume of 0.6 mL.
5) Infection Control Studies: The device is intended for multiple-patient use. Disinfection
efficacy studies were performed on the materials comprising the meter by an outside
commercial testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus
(HBV) with the chosen disinfectant, Super Sani-Cloth (EPA registration #9480-4).
Robustness studies were also performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no
change in performance or external materials of the meter after 10,950 cleaning and
disinfection cycles (21,900 wipes). The robustness studies were designed to simulate 3
years of multiple-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the
validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
6) Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing was performed and found to be adequate
for the Accu-Chek Performa system.
