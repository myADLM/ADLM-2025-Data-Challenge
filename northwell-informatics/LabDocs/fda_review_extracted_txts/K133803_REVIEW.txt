The Diazyme Glycated Serum Protein POC Test Kit is intended for the quantitative
determination of glycated serum proteins (GSP; fructosamine) in serum. Fructosamine is
representative of blood glucose levels over the course of 2-3 weeks. The measurement of
glycated serum proteins is useful for monitoring diabetic patients. For in vitro diagnostic
use only.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
· For Prescription Use Only
· For in vitro diagnostic use

4. Special instrument requirements:
Diazyme SMART analyzer
I. Device Description:
The Diazyme Glycated Serum Protein POC Test Kit consists of the following
components (1) DRS Cuvettes pre-filled with Reagent 1 (R1), (2) DRS cap prefilled with
Reagent 2 (R2) and (3) one preprogrammed Radio Frequency ID (RFID) card which
contains a lot specific calibration curve. Reagent 1 is comprised of 40 prefilled DRS
cuvettes and 100 mM TrisCL buffer. R2 is comprised of 40 prefilled DRS caps and
enzyme/substrate reagent containing Tris.HCL buffer, enzymes, TOOS, HRP, Geneticin
and stabilizers.
The SMART Analyzer (k092911) is a compact cuvette based spectrophotometer for
point-of-care testing designed to analyze readings from single use reagent cuvettes. The
instrument only uses the Diazyme Reagent System (DRS) cuvette and caps and performs
the assay with a preprogrammed Radio Frequency ID (RFID) card. The lot specific RFID
card contains reagent addition time, mixing time, reading time and calibration curve for
estimating Glycated Serum Protein (GSP; fructosamine) concentration.
The Diazyme Glycated Serum Protein Controls are recommended for use with this
device. The controls were previously cleared under k042193.

L. Test Principle:
Glycated Serum Protein (GSP; fructosamine) concentration is determined through a series of
enzymatic reactions and the oxidative degradation of glycated protein fragments and uses
Diazyme’s specific fructosamine ™ to release hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide
released is measured by a colorimetric Trinder end-point reaction. The absorbance at 546 nm
is proportional to the concentration of GSP.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
In house Precision Study: Precision studies were evaluated in accordance with the
CLSI EP5-A2 guideline. Within run and total imprecision were assessed by testing a
two level serum based control with the approximate concentrations of 213 and 719
µmol/L GSP (Fructosamine) respectively. An additional five serum samples with
approximate GSP (Fructosamine) concentrations of 85, 225, 480,750 and 1200
µmol/L respectively were also tested. Samples were tested in 4 runs per day over 20
working days. Results are as follows:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed using 11 diluted samples with GSP (Fructosamine)
concentrations evenly distributed throughout the assay range. Samples were prepared
from a high serum pool spiked with human GSP (Fructosamine~1348 µmol/L) and
low analyte serum GSP (Fructosamine concentration ~ 2 µmol/L) to cover the assay
range. The range of samples tested was 2-1348 µmol/L. Each dilution was assayed in
triplicate on the SMART analyzer. The linear regression analysis between the

expected and observed values is as follows:
y=1.007x-0.1, r=0.999
The results of the linearity study support the claimed measuring range of 61-1348
µmol/L.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The Diazyme GSP POC Test kit is traceable to an internal standard (Master Lot)
which was gravimetrically prepared from commercially available reagents. The
concentrations of fructosyl propylamine were confirmed via a commercially available
Fructosamine assay.
The initial lot of calibrator materials (master lot) was value assigned through a
correlation study using control and patient samples with values determines using the
Diazyme GSP assay (k110188) on the SMART analyzer and Randox Fructosamine
assay on the Hitachi on the Hitachi 917. Based on the correlation study with this
method, the fructosamine values for the Master Lot were established. All subsequent
lots are value assigned against the Master Lot on the SMART analyzer.
The Diazyme POC test utilizes a Calibration Radio Frequency Identification Card
(RFID) card that is programmed with a lot specific calibration curve and is supplied
in each kit. RFID cards are programmed at the manufacturer site and are subject to
the same quality control checks as the reagents and controls. The calibration curve is
stable until the printed expiration date.
To construct the Diazyme GSP RFID card calibration curve, 2 levels of calibrators
used in the predicate device (k110188) are tested with the Diazyme GSP POC Test
Kit reagents on more than one SMART analyzer to obtain the rate of absorbance
change. The calibrator value and the rate absorbance change are programmed into the
RFID cards.
The Diazyme GSP Control Set (previously cleared under k042193) is recommended
for use with this device.
d. Detection limit:
The Limit of Blank, Limit of Detection and Limit of Quantitation of the Diazyme
GSP POC Test kit were determined according to CLSI EP17-A in the following
manner:
To calculate the Limit of Blank (LoB) of the Diazyme GSP POC Test kit, a blank
sample (water) was tested with 20 replicates daily for three days. LOB was calculated
as the mean of the 57th and 58th highest values for the blank samples. Based upon the
results, the sponsor claims a LoB=12 µmol/L.
6

--- Page 7 ---
To calculate the Limit of Detection (LoD) of the Diazyme GSP POC Test kit, five
low samples (0-33µmol/L) were tested in replicates of four over three days.
LoD=LoB + (1.645*SD of Low samples). Based upon the results, the sponsor claims
a LoD of 29.9 µmol/L.
To calculate the Limit of Quantitation (LoQ) of the Diazyme GSP POC Test kit, 5
serum samples were prepared with GSP values at targeted concentrations (39.4 to
251.4 µmol/L were analyzed. Each serum sample was assayed on five separate runs
with eight replicates per run. Based upon the results, the sponsor claims a LoQ of 61
µmol/L.
The claimed measuring range is 61-1348 µmol/L based on linearity.
The sponsor recommends that all samples >1300 µmol/L be diluted with saline and a
1:1 dilution be performed. In order to support this procedure, the sponsor provided a
dilution study in which 3 serum samples were spiked and then diluted 1:1 with saline
and analyzed on the SMART analyzer using the Diazyme GSP POC test. Samples
ranged from 1057-1203 µmol/L and % Recovery was 97-102%
e. Analytical specificity:
The level of interference from substances normally present in serum was determined
by testing two GSP serum samples (~225 µmol/L and ~550 µmol/L) spiked with
various concentrations of the interferent. Test samples were then compared to a
control sample (containing no interferent). The following substances produced less
than 10% deviation when tested at levels equal to the concentration listed below.
Interference Concentration
Ascorbic Acid 20 mg/dL
Bilirubin 7.5 mg/dL
Bilirubin Conjugated 5 mg/dL
Triglyceride 1000 mg/dL
Glucose 2400 mg/dL
Uric Acid 35 mg/dL
Hemoglobin* 100 mg/dL
