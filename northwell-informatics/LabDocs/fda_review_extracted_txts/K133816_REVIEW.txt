Traceability:
The IMMULITE Free PSA CVMs are traceable to the WHO NIBSC 1st International
Standard 96/668 through internal reference calibrators.
Value Assignment:
IMMULITEâ CVMs are value assigned using approved reference calibrators lot
manufactured with qualified materials and measurement procedures. Each level of
CVM was tested in six runs, three replicates per run for a total of 18 replicates using
two different kit lots on four instruments. The values are assigned using a curve of
assigned reference calibrators. The CVM values are calculated based on the
recovered values for each run on each instrument independently. CVM values are
then averaged across all systems. The Guideline Range (95% confidence interval) for
each CVM level was established based on the Target Mean and ± 2 Standard
Deviation (SD). The values in the table below are example of the target range for
each CVM level for the lot tested.
Level Catalog number Target Mean Guideline
(ng/mL) Target Mean± 2SD
(ng/mL)
1 LPTSCVM1 0.00 0.00 0.07
2 LPTSCVM2 0.20 0.17 0.22
3 LPTSCVM3 1.45 1.29 1.61
4 LPTSCVM4 24.40 22.00 26.80
Assay range 0.07 – 25.0 ng/mL
Value assignment is lot specific. Each lot of CVM quality control is tested for
verification by calculating the recovery of patient samples, spiked patient samples and
normal male samples and controls using the assigned value. The controls must fall
within their target ranges.
Stability:
The stability studies were conducted to validate shelf life claim for the IMMULITE®
2000 Free PSA CVM on IMMULITE 2000 platforms. The CVMs are run as part of
the calibrator stability testing. The CVMs are run in duplicates and the concentration
value is determined from the reference internal material. One lot was tested for 42
months. Two additional lots were tested for six months. For all studies there is
percent recovery of more than 90%. The claimed CVM stability is 6 months when
stored at -20°C prior to opening, and for 8 hours at ambient temperature (room
temperature) after opening. Each CVM is for single use only. Real time stability is
ongoing.
