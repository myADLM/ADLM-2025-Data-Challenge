For use with the VITEK® 2 and VITEK® 2 Compact Systems
I. Device Description:
The VITEK® 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the
doubling dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).
Each VITEK® 2 test card contains 64 microwells. A control well containing only culture
medium is included on all cards, with the remaining wells containing premeasured amounts
of a specific antibiotic in a culture medium base. A suspension of organism from a pure
culture is prepared in a tube containing 0.45-0.5% sterile saline and standardized to a
McFarland 0.5 using the DensiCHEK Plus™. The VITEK 2 System automatically fills, seals
and places the card into the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling,
sealing and loading operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the
card over a defined period of time. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is
generated that contains the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each
antibiotic contained on the card.
VITEK 2 AST-YST Fluconazole has the following concentrations in the card: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32
and 64 μg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in μg/mL). The MIC
result range for the VITEK 2 AST-YST Fluconazole card is ≤ 0.5 - ≥ 64.

L. Test Principle:
The VITEK® 2 System optics use visible light to directly measure organism growth. The
transmittance optics are based on an initial light reading of a well before significant growth
has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same well measure organism growth
by how much light is prevented from going through the well. Several parameters based on
the growth characteristics observed are used to provide appropriate input for the MIC
calculations. Discriminate analysis is used to develop the algorithm that determines the
susceptibility result for all antimicrobials on the VITEK® 2 System. The MIC result must be
linked to organism identification in order to determine a category interpretation. A category
interpretation (SIR) will be reported along with each MIC result.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility studies were performed using ten isolates (two isolates of C.
norvegensis, two isolates of C. krusei, two isolates of C. paraspilosis, and one isolate
each of C. guilliermondii, C. lusitaniae, C. dubliniensis, and C. tropicalis) in
triplicate at three external clinical sites on three separate days. The studies included
both the auto- and manual dilution methods with the VITEK 2 instrument system and the
manual dilution method with the VITEK 2 Compact instrument system. Greater than
95% reproducibility was demonstrated with both the VITEK® 2 and VITEK® 2 Compact
Systems. A summary of the reproducibility study performance is provided in Table 1
below.

using two recommended quality control strains: Candida krusei (ATCC 6258) and
Candida parapsilosis (ATCC 22019). In those instances where the test result was
out-of-range for all replicates of the reference method, all data from that day’s testing
was considered invalid and the testing for that day was repeated.
The QC organisms were tested a minimum of 20 times at 24 and 48 hour incubation
times by the reference method, the VITEK 2 instrument platform using both auto- and
manual dilution methods, and the VITEK 2 Compact instrument platform using the
manual dilution method. QC results for the VITEK 2 AST-YS Fluconazole were
within the expected results range ≥ 99% of the time for both instrument platforms and
both dilution methods. A summary of the QC performance is provided in Tables 2 and 3

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The performance of the VITEK 2 System was established for Candida spp. with a
clinical study conducted at three external sites. Testing was done on 406 fresh clinical
isolates and 85 challenge isolates in comparison to the 24 hour broth microdilution
reference method as described in CLSI documents M27-A3 and M27-S4. Both
automated and manual dilution methods were tested on the VITEK 2 System.
Challenge isolates were also tested with the manual dilution method on the VITEK 2
Compact.
Essential agreement was calculated for when the VITEK 2 system results were within
+/- two doubling dilutions of the reference method results. Category agreement was
calculated for when the VITEK 2 system result interpretations agreed exactly with the
reference method result interpretations. Evaluable results were defined as when both
the reference method results and the VITEK 2 system results were on-scale.
Evaluable results were also defined as when the reference method results were on-
scale and off-scale VITEK 2 system results clearly did not agree within the accepted
+/- two doubling dilutions. Results are summarized in Table 4 below.
