MRSA. The test uses recombinant monoclonal antibody fragments (rFabs) to detect
the PBP2a protein directly from bacterial isolates. The rFab and a control antibody
are immobilized onto a nitrocellulose membrane as two distinct lines and combined
with a sample pad, a pink/purple conjugate pad, and an absorption pad to form a test
strip. Isolates are sampled directly from the culture plate and eluted into an assay
tube containing Reagent 1. Reagent 2 is then added and the test strip is placed in the
assay tube. Results are read visually at 5 minutes.

L. Test Principle:
Alere™ PBP2a SA Culture Colony Test is a rapid immunochromatographic membrane assay
that uses recombinant monoclonal antibody fragments (rFabs) to detect the PBP2a protein
directly from bacterial isolates. The rFab and a control antibody are immobilized onto a
nitrocellulose membrane as two distinct lines and combined with a sample pad, a pink/purple
conjugate pad, and an absorption pad to form a test strip.
Isolates are sampled directly from the culture plate and eluted into an assay tube containing
Reagent 1. Reagent 2 is then added and the dipstick is placed in the assay tube. Results are
read visually at 5 minutes based on the presence or absence of a pink/purple Sample Line. A
pink/purple Control Line appears in the top half of the test strip in a valid assay.

A reproducibility study was performed at three sites. Testing was done at three sites,
using 18-24 hrs isolates that have been sub-cultured, by two operators in duplicates
for five days. The reproducibility panel consists of six MRSA, and four MSSA; 10
isolates x 2 tests (duplicates) x 2 operators x 5 days x 3 sites = 600
Testing was done from each of the following media: Tryptic Soy Agar with 5% sheep
blood, and Mueller-Hinton Agar induced with a 30 µg Cefoxitin disk. There was
100% (600/600) agreement with expected test results.

The following Product Stability Studies were performed to generate real time and
accelerated stability data to support the expiration date of each lot under stated
conditions.
The materials used in this study were as follows:
· Alere PBP2a SA Culture Colony Test Devices
· Alere PBP2a Culture Colony Test Reagent 1
· Alere PBP2a Culture Colony Test Reagent 2
Control Panel:
o S. aureus ATCC 43300 Positive Plate Control

o Alere PBP2a SA Culture Colony Test estimated Low Control
o Alere PBP2a SA Culture Colony Test estimated LOD Control
Stability conditions were set up as follows:
1. Accelerated –at 45°C and at 55°C
2. Real-Time at room temperature and at 30°C

--- Page 6 ---
Results are outlined in Table 1 below:
Transfer Lot 1 devices, Reagent 1 and Reagent 2 remained stable at 52 weeks of real
time at 2-8°C and continued to hold after 40 weeks at 30°C, 20 weeks at 45°C and 10
weeks at 55°C. Transfer Lot 2 devices, Reagent 1, and Reagent 2 remained stable at
36 weeks at 2-8°C, 30°C, and continued to hold at 20 weeks at 45°C and 10 weeks at
55°C. See below Table 1 for Stability Summary.
Table 1: Stability Testing Summary
Weeks of Stability at Various Temperatures
Lot 2-8°C 30°C 45°C 55°C
Transfer lot 1 52 weeks 40 weeks 20 weeks 10 weeks
Transfer lot 2 36 weeks* 36 weeks* 20 weeks 10 weeks
Transfer lot 3 28 weeks* 28 weeks* 20 weeks 10 weeks
*Stability testing continues on these lots at the stated temperatures.
It is anticipated that the Alere PBP2a SA Culture Colony Test will have at least 12
months of stability.
Quality Control:
The Alere PBP2a SA culture colony test has built-in positive and negative procedural
controls. The manufacturer recommends that these controls be included in each test
run.
1. Procedural Controls
a. The appearance of a blue line at the “control line” position can be considered
an internal positive procedural control. If capillary flow has occurred, this line
will always appear.
b. In comparison to the color of the control line, the background color on the
dipstick should be white within 5 minutes.
2. External Positive and Negative Controls:
The external controls tested during clinical and analytical testing are described in
Table 2 below.
Table 2: Controls
Expected Result With Device
QC Organism
Result
S. aureus ATCC 43300 Positive Positive
S. aureus ATCC 25923 Negative Negative
During the clinical study, external positive and negative controls were used for
each new lot and each day of testing.

A total of 130 positive and negative external controls were tested in the clinical
study and demonstrated 100% concordance with the expected results.
In addition to the above QC organisms, the analytical study included additional
supplemental positive and negative controls that were tested in triplicate on each
day of testing with results interpreted by two operators. All positive and negative
daily controls generated the expected results on each day of testing.

A limit of detection study was conducted using Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC
BAA44) and the detection limit was determined to be 7.3 x 108 CFU/ml.
