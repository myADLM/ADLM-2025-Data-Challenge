SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification
OIR Review Memorandum (Decision Making Document is Attached)
To: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention RE: K133869
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own
Class II, Class III or Class I devices requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable:
1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device:
CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel
510(k) number: K132508
2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in
its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for
use, package labeling, and, if available, advertisements or promotional materials (labeling changes
are permitted as long as they do not affect the intended use).
3. Description of the device MODIFICATION(S):
The modification presented in this special 510(k) consisted of a revised package insert for the CDC
Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel, Influenza A/B typing kit. Recently,
additional assays have been included in the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR
Diagnostic Panel and cleared by FDA to accommodate the new influenza virus subtypes. The
consumption of the various assays within the panel may be different since the prevalence of influenza
virus types and subtypes vary from season to season. To address the consequent variation in
consumption, CDC plans to provide the users with an option to order different configurations of
specific components of the panel ( including the Influenza A/B typing in this special 510(k)) so that
their supply of reagents can be managed efficiently minimizing the waste. The different components
of CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel will be accompanied by revised
labeling (package inserts) and the current submission is to clear the first component, i.e., Influenza
A/B typing.
4. The FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.

Verification Activities
To the best of my knowledge, the verification activities, as required by the risk analysis for the
modification, were performed by the designated individual(s) and the results demonstrate that the
predetermined acceptance criteria were met.
Manufacturing Facility
The CDC Division of Scientific Resources manufacturing facility is in conformance with the design
control requirements as specified in 21 CFR 820.30 and the records are available for review.
In conclusion, the modified labeling is truthful and accurate. The changes do not affect the
performance of the test and it is therefore substantially equivalent to the current cleared test.
7. Truthful and Accurate Statement, a 510(k) Summary or Statement and the Indications for
Use Enclosure.
The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use
for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular
modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices
demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the
design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the
device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.
