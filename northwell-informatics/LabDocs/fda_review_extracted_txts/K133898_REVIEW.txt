DECISION MEMORANDUM
INSTRUMENT ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
k133898
B. Purpose for Submission:
New Device
C. Manufacturer and Instrument Name:
Aerocrine NIOX VERO
D. Type of Test or Tests Performed:
Quantitative
E. System Descriptions:
1. Device Description:
NIOX VERO is a portable system for the non-invasive, quantitative measurement of the
fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (NO) in expired human breath (Fe ).
NO
The NIOX VERO system is comprised of the NIOX VERO unit with AC adapter, a
rechargeable battery, an electrochemical NO sensor, disposable patient filters, and an
exchangeable handle containing an internal NO scrubber filter. The NIOX Panel is an
optional PC application for operation of the NIOX VERO from a PC and access to
electronic medical record systems.
For testing, the patient empties their lungs, inhales deeply through the patient filter to
total lung capacity and then slowly exhales for 10 seconds. In approximately one minute,
the NO concentration is displayed in parts per billion (ppb). Results are processed using
dedicated software.
2. Principles of Operation:
Measurement principle is based on American Thoracic Society guidelines (ATS/ERS
Recommendations for Standardized Procedures for the Online and Offline Measurement
of Exhaled Lower Respiratory Nitric Oxide and Nasal Nitric Oxide, 2005. Am J Respir
Crit Care Med. 2005;171:912-930). The last three second fraction of a 10 second
exhalation is evaluated for average NO concentration. The exhalation flow is controlled
to 50 ml/s ±5 ml/s at an applied pressure of 10 to 20 cm H2O. Sample is evaluated in 25
1

--- Page 2 ---
seconds (2 ml/sec for 25 seconds). The inhaled air is NO free. NO is measured using
electrochemical detection. There is a gas inlet chamber with an electrolyte (sulfuric acid
solution) and hardware. The NO molecules diffuse through the membrane and reach the
electrolyte. A chemical reaction takes place where one electron for each NO molecule is
generated. The current is proportional to the number of converted NO molecules.
3. Modes of Operation:
NIOX VERO is a portable system for the non-invasive, quantitative measurement of the
fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (NO) in expired human breath (Fe ) measured in parts
NO
per billion (ppb).
The NIOX VERO system is comprised of the NIOX VERO unit with AC adapter, a
rechargeable battery, an electrochemical NO sensor, disposable patient filters, and an
exchangeable handle containing an internal NO scrubber filter. The NIOX Panel is an
optional PC application for operation of the NIOX VERO from a PC and access to
electronic medical record systems.
The NIOX VERO unit includes a sampling and gas conditioning system and a man-
machine interface (MMI). The instrument controls the inhaled sample appropriately via
the electronics and software program. Filtering of inhaled air eliminates contamination
from ambient NO levels. A built-in flow control keeps exhalation standardized at 50 ml/s
so that it is standardized for all patients. The sample enters an electromechanical sensor
and interacts with an electrolyte. A chemical reaction takes place where electrons are
generated proportional to the number of NO molecules.
The patient empties their lungs, inhales deeply through the patient filter to total lung
capacity and then slowly exhale for 10 seconds. In approximately one minute, the NO
concentration is displayed in parts per billion (ppb).
Results are processed using dedicated software. In order to verify the device’s
performance and reliability of measurements, there are built-in system control procedures
and a Quality Control procedure to be performed on a daily basis.
4. Specimen Identification:
There is no mechanism to identify the specimen.
5. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The user obtains a breath sample by exhaling into the device.
6. Calibration:
The manufacturer performs calibration for each NIOX VERO® Sensor. NIOX VERO
sensor is an electrochemical sensor pre-calibrated and pre-programmed for a defined
2

--- Page 3 ---
number of tests (60, 100, 300, 500, or 1000 tests).The user exchanges the sensor upon
expiration. The instrument prompts the user for upcoming exchange prior to sensor
expiration and does not allow for measurements with an expired sensor. No additional
calibration is needed during the lifetime of the sensor.
7. Quality Control:
NIOX VERO provides internal controls as well as an External Quality Control program
for the user to verify the reliability of measurements.
The External Quality Control program consists of two parts: One positive control from a
qualified staff member with a stable Fe value providing a normal biological Fe
NO NO
sample and a negative control consisting of a NO free gas sample automatically
generated from ambient air. The process consists of performing 3 QC measurements one
per day within 7 days. A mean is calculated from the 3 measurements that must be
between 5-40 ppb to establish the baseline. The following QC measurement on the 4th
day must be within +/- 10 ppb from the mean value of the initial 3 measurements and the
NO scrubber result < 5ppb. Then the QC has passed and the instrument is ready for
clinical use. A moving mean is calculated when the QC tester performs a QC
measurement following 7 days. A QC test must be performed each day of use. If the QC
tester does not perform a QC test in 30 days, the qualification is suspended and the QC
tester needs to re-qualify.

G. Intended Use:
1. Indication(s) for Use:
NIOX VERO® measures Nitric Oxide (NO) in human breath. Nitric Oxide is frequently
increased in some inflammatory processes such as asthma. The fractional NO
concentration in expired breath (Fe ), can be measured by NIOX VERO according to
NO
guidelines for NO measurement established by the American Thoracic Society.
Measurement of Fe by NIOX VERO is a quantitative, non-invasive, simple and safe
NO
method to measure the decrease in Fe concentration in asthma patients that often
NO
occurs after treatment with anti-inflammatory pharmacological therapy, as an indication
of the therapeutic effect in patients with elevated Fe levels. NIOX VERO is suitable for
NO
children, approximately 7 - 17 years, and adults 18 years and older.
Fe measurements provide the physician with means of evaluating an asthma patient’s
NO
response to anti-inflammatory therapy, as an adjunct to the established clinical and
laboratory assessments in asthma. The NIOX VERO is intended for prescription use and
should only be used as directed in the NIOX VERO User Manual by trained healthcare
professionals. NIOX VERO cannot be used with infants or by children approximately
under the age of 7, as measurement requires patient cooperation. NIOX VERO should not
be used in critical care, emergency care or in anesthesiology.
2. Special Conditions for Use Statement(s):
NIOX VERO should only be operated by trained healthcare professionals and only after
careful reading of the NIOX VERO User Manual.
The device should not be used with infants or by children under age of 7, or any patient
who cannot cooperate with any necessary requirements of test performance.
The device should not be used in critical care, emergency care or in anaesthesiology.
Subjects should not smoke in the hour before measurements, and short- and long-term
active and passive smoking history should be recorded. In addition, subjects should
refrain from eating and drinking for 1 hour before exhaled NO measurement. Alcohol
ingestion reduces FE in patients with asthma and healthy subjects FE .
NO NO
It is prudent, where possible, to perform serial NO measurements in the same period of
the day and to always record the time.
For prescription use only.

J. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical Performance:
a. Accuracy:
A method comparison study was performed, to compare performance of the NIOX
VERO to the predicate device (NIOX MINO). A total of 112 male and female subjects
(48 Children and 64 Adults) aged 7 to 78 years with either physician diagnosed asthma or
under evaluation for a diagnosis of asthma were enrolled and 109 subjects completed the
study.

Fe measurement. Analysis of the relationship between the NIOX VERO and the
NO
NIOX MINO showed the slope of the Weighted Deming regression analysis was
0.842 (95% CI 0.757, 0.927) and the intercept was -0.472 (95% CI -1.999, 1.055).
Exhaled nitric oxide is recognized by the American Thoracic Society as a marker of
airway inflammation and is recommended (in conjunction with other clinical
attributes) in the diagnosis of airway inflammation and in determining response to
corticosteroid therapy. In the clinical setting, the utility of FeNO is the shift (upward
or downward) or lack thereof, rather than a specific percentage change in the FeNO
value. Therefore, when comparing the change in nitric oxide values between clinical
visits, the difference in measurements between the NIOX VERO and the NIOX
MINO was not clinically significant.
See section J.2. for additional clinical supportive data.
b. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision was tested based on CLSI EP5-A2. Certified NO of 200 ppb and 2100
ppb in nitrogen calibration gas was used. Data was collected over 20 operating days,
two runs per day, with duplicate determinations for each concentration, using the
concentrations 15, 75 and 200 ppb. The repeatability and within-device precision
over 20 days were determined for each concentration. Five NIOX VERO sensors,
continually mounted in 5 NIOX VERO instruments, respectively, were used in these
tests. All NIOX VERO instruments were tested and stored at ambient room
conditions. The NIOX VERO instruments were continuously powered during the test
period.
The repeatability and within-device precision were calculated for the 5 instruments.
The results at the 15 ppb level is expressed as ppb, and at 75 and 200 ppb as
percentage of the measured NO concentration (Table 1). The repeatability and within-
device precision were additionally tested using concentrations of 5, 25, 75, and 200
ppb to include more concentrations across the measurement range of the device
(Table 2).

A multi-center, single visit, point-of-care, inter-operator variability study was conducted to
determine the repeatability of Fe measured with the NIOX VERO® device when three
NO
consecutive valid Fe measurements were obtained in a single subject by three
NO
different NIOX VERO® operators using the same NIOX VERO® device. Fractional
Exhaled Nitric Oxide (Fe ) levels in this study were assessed for a total of 122
NO
subjects at 3 different sites by a total of 43 different operators.

c. Linearity:
Certified NO at 200 ppb and 2000 ppb in nitrogen calibration gas was mixed with
nitrogen gas in a gas mixer, connected in-line with the NIOX VERO instrument,
(with mounted NIOX VERO sensors), to obtain 7 NO concentration levels (3, 5, 25,
100, 200, 300 and 330 ppb). Five replicate determinations of the concentrations at 3
and 5 ppb, and three replicate determinations on the other intervals were made.
For the 10 devices tested, the regression analysis gave slopes of 0.95 to 1.05 and
intercept ±3 ppb. The squared correlation coefficient r2 was > 0.998 for all the 10
devices tested. Results indicate linearity within the 5-30 ppb measuring range.
Effects of Temperature and Relative Humidity
Variations due to climate conditions were evaluated by test measurements at three
NO concentration levels (15, 75, and 200 ppb). Combinations within the claimed
operational range, i.e. temperature 10-35°C and relative humidity (RH) 20-80%, were
tested. Five replicate determinations of each concentration were made for each
climate.
5 NIOX VERO sensors, continually mounted in 5 NIOX VERO instruments,
respectively, were used in these tests.
The obtained upper 95% confidence limit was within 5ppb (for 15ppb) or max 10 %
(for 75 and 200 ppb) on all test occasions.
d. Carryover:
Not applicable.
e. Interfering Substances:
Sensor interference levels were tested in a laboratory setting. The substances and
concentrations tested are summarized in the table below. Substances were selected
based on their oxidizing potential, which could interfere with the electrochemical
signal from NO detection. The concentrations were in the same range or higher than
expected concentration of each substance in exhaled breath. The interference is
calculated in relation to highest NO level in the measurement range, i.e. 300 ppb. The
applicable concentration of each substance was generated, the gas stream was fed to
the sensor by a gas-mixer, and the sensor signal was measured. All tests were
performed at normal ambient conditions: Temperature between 20 and 24 °C, relative
humidity between 45 and 55%.
Interference was defined as an incremental change of at least 3.0 ppb NO. No
interferents met that definition; however nitrogen dioxide and hydrogen sulfide are
noted as interferents in the device labeling since incremental changes noted for these
substances was near 3.0 ppb NO. The table below provides interference information

Interference of exogenous substances
A clinical study was performed to investigate the influence of exogenous substances
(chewing gum, carbonated beverage and mouthwash) on Fe measured with NIOX
NO
VERO. The primary endpoint was the difference between baseline Fe and Fe
NO NO
measured directly after, one and two hours after exposure to each exogenous
substance. A total of 12 subjects were tested. The Paired Student’s t-test was used to
compare the time points to baseline following each exposure.
The results of this study show that there is little or no effect of these
exogenous substances on the measurement of exhaled nitric oxide. The
differences that were seen were all within the performance characteristics of
the NIOX VERO.

ATS guidelines recommend that no food or beverage be consumed, and no smoking
be done for at least one hour before taking an Fe measurement. This
NO
recommendation would be in line with the results from this study where the
differences mostly occurred in the 0-1 hr time frame, where the differences from
baseline was determined to be -1.08, 0.33, and -0.25, for chewing gum, carbonated
beverage, and mouthwash, respectively.
2. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Data Not Covered Above:
Other clinical supportive data:
A clinical study was not conducted with the NIOX VERO device. In 2007, a multi-
center device randomized open-label prospective single-cohort study was conducted
to demonstrate substantial equivalence between NIOX MINO® and predicate device
(NIOX®) when measuring the change of FE that often occurs after 2 weeks of
NO
corticosteroid therapy compared to their baseline levels (See k072816). Symptomatic
asthmatic males and females, performed two valid FE measurements at each visit,
NO
with NIOX MINO and NIOX respectively, with a limit of six exhalation attempts per
subject in each device. The order of the FE measurement on NIOX MINO versus
NO
NIOX was randomized. At every visit and for every patient, spirometry was
performed and asthma symptoms were recorded using Asthma Control
Questionnaire® (ACQ). In total, 156 subjects were included, 105 adults 18 - 70 years
old and 51 children 7 - 17 years old. Results from this study, in conjunction with the
new method comparison study described above, were determined to be applicable to
the candidate device, the NIOX VERO. See k072816 for more details.
Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The instrument is manufacturer calibrated. NIOX VERO does not require calibration
by the user. A replaceable sensor is used which is pre-programmed and pre-calibrated
for a defined number of tests. The life time of NIOX VERO instrument is set to 5.5
years. The number of possible tests is 15000. The sensor life time is limited to 12
months in unopened packaging following manufacture, for 6 months from initial
installation into NIOX VERO, or for the defined number of tests (60, 100, 300, 500
or 1000), whichever comes first. The shelf life for NIOX Filter in unopened primary
package is 2 years. NIOX Filter is for single use and must be replaced for every new
patient and measurement occasion. Stability information to support all claims was
reviewed and deemed acceptable.

Detection limit:
The lowest detection limit was determined in a laboratory setting, using mixtures of
standard reference NO gas and nitrogengas below and above the detection limit, at 3
and 5 ppb. Five replicate determinations of each concentration were made. 10 NIOX
VERO sensors, continually mounted in 10 NIOX VERO instruments, respectively,
were used in these tests. The mean and confidence limit at 3 ppb (mean 3.5 ppb, 95%
CI: 3.3,3.7) and 5 ppb (8.2 ppb, 95% CI: 7.9, 8.5) support the claimed detection limit
of 5 ppb.
Expected values/Reference range:
The expected values are provided from the literature. In the labeling the sponsor
states, “Given that physiological and environmental factors can affect Fe , Fe
NO NO
levels in clinical practice need to be established on an individual basis. However,
most healthy individuals will have NO levels in the range 5-35 ppb (children slightly
lower, 5-25 ppb) when measured at 50 ml/s.
(ATS/ERS Recommendations for Standardized Procedures for the Online and Offline
Measurement of Exhaled Lower Respiratory Nitric Oxide and Nasal Nitric Oxide,
2005. Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2005;171:912-930.)”
K. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
L. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
