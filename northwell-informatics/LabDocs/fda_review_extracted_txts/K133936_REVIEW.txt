Performance Characteristics of In Vitro diagnostic Devices for the Detection of Clostridium

L. Test Principle:
The artus C. difficile QS-RGQ MDx Kit assay uses PCR to generate an amplified product
from the tcdA and tcdB/tcdBv genes of toxigenic C. difficile DNA in clinical specimens.
Samples are extracted and prepared using the QIAsymphony SP instrument with the
QIAsymphony DSP Virus/Pathogen Mini Kit, followed by assay setup on the QIAsymphony
AS. Amplification and detection are carried out using the artus C. difficile QS-RGQ MDx
Kit with the Rotor-Gene Q MDx (RGQ MDx) and Rotor-Gene AssayManager software.
The presence of a toxigenic C. difficile target sequence is indicated by the fluorescent signal
generated through the use of fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes. The probes
do not generate a signal unless they are specifically bound to the amplified product. The
amplification cycle at which fluorescent signal is detected by the RGQ MDx is inversely
proportional to the toxigenic C. difficile DNA target concentration present in the original

specimen. A bacterial species unrelated to toxigenic C. difficile is introduced into each
specimen during sample preparation to serve as an internal control. The internal control
bacteria are lysed simultaneously with toxigenic C. difficile in the specimen, and
amplified in the same reaction as the C. difficile targets using PCR, and serve to demonstrate
that the entire assay process has proceeded correctly for each specimen.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
The precision of the artus C. difficile QS-RGQ Kit was assessed using a 7-member panel
consisting of 2 C. difficile strains: NAP-1/BI/027 strain, toxinotype III A+B+ (ATCC BAA-
1870) and 1470 strain, toxinotype VIII A-B+ (ATCC 43598). Panel members were initially
diluted in TE buffer then tested in Buffer ATL containing negative stool matrix with a
single strain present (NAP-1/BI/027 or 1470) at 3 concentrations; positive (approximately
2–3x LoD), low positive (1x LoD), and high negative (<1x LoD). A seventh panel member
(negative) was prepared using TE buffer only and also tested in Buffer ATL containing
negative stool matrix. The data obtained were used to determine the mean C , standard
T
deviation (SD) and the coefficient of variation (%CV) for each target and the internal
control.
For the within laboratory repeatability study, the seven-member panel was tested in
replicates of three, once a day for a total of twelve days (for a total of 262 data points for
the 12 runs). The testing was conducted by two operators using one instrument (QS/AS
RGQ MDx) and one reagent kit lot (Table 2).

To measure site-to-site reproducibility, the 7-member panel was run by 2 users at each of
3 sites (IMDx and 2 external sites). Each of the 2 users performed 5 runs on alternating
testing days. Panel members were tested in replicates of 3 that were randomized and
blinded to the user. A single QIAsymphony RGQ MDx system and one lot of the artus C.
difficile QS-RGQ MDx Kit were used at each site to conduct the study (Table 3). The
reproducibility study results are acceptable.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
For controls: See # I - Device Description above
Traceability for the QIAsymphony Instrument, Firmware, and Software is maintained
between requirements, specifications, testing, and risk mitigations. Product requirements
that are defined at the highest system level (QS-RGQ) are translated into product
requirements for the SP and AS subsystem, and translated further into specifications for
hardware, firmware, software, and disposables.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of detection (LOD) was assessed for the artus C. difficile QS-RGQ MDx
Kit using 3 toxigenic Clostridium difficile strains: NAP-1/BI/027 strain, toxinotype III
A+B+ (ATCC® BAA-1870); 1470 strain, toxinotype VIII A-B+ (ATCC 43598); and
VPI 10463 strain, toxinotype 0 A+B+ (ATCC 43255). The LOD is defined as the
toxigenic C. difficile bacterial titer (CFU/mL) detected with a probability of 95% or
greater and was determined by probit analysis. The results, representative of the
analytical sensitivity of the artus C. difficile QS-RGQ MDx Kit, are summarized in
Table 4.

Cross-Reactivity and Microbial Interference
A panel of microorganisms that may be present in patient specimens was tested to
determine whether these microorganisms interfered with the detection of tcdA or tcdB
targets or were cross-reactive with the artus C. difficile QS-RGQ MDx Kit. Organisms
were tested at a target concentration of approximately 1 x 106 CFU/ml for bacteria and
fungi or ≥1 x 105 units/ml for viruses separately in the presence of 2–3x LOD of each

of three C. difficile strains: NAP-1/BI/027 strain, 1470 strain, and VPI 10463 strain.
None of the potential interfering organisms cross-reacted or interfered with the detection
of any of the 3 C. difficile strains by the artus C. difficile QS-RGQ MDx Kit (Table 5).
Cross- reactivity for Clostridium botulinum was analyzed in silico and predicted
no cross reactivity or microbial interference for the artus C. difficile QS-RGQ MDx Kit.

Interfering Substances
A panel of 23 substances that may be present in patient specimens was tested to
determine whether these substances interfered with the performance of the artus C. difficile
QS-RGQ MDx Kit. Three toxigenic C. difficile strains: NAP-1/BI/027 strain, 1470
strain, and VPI 10463 strain, were diluted to approximately 2–3x LOD and spiked with
each potentially inhibitory substance. None of the substances showed an inhibitory effect
on the detection of C. difficile by the artus C. difficile QS-RGQ MDx Kit (Table 7).

3. Clinical studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity:
The performance of the artus C. difficile QS-RGQ MDx Kit was evaluated at 3
external testing sites using patient samples from patients suspected of C. difficile
infection. Patient samples were collected from 5 geographically diverse locations
within the United States. The artus C. difficile QS-RGQ MDx Kit was compared to
direct and/or enriched culture. For direct culture, the stool specimen was swabbed to
a CCFA plate and streaked for isolation. For enriched culture, the same swab was
used to inoculate enrichment broth (CCMB-TAL). At 36-48 hours, the enrichment
broth was subcultured to a CCFA plate which was streaked for isolation. Suspicious
colonies were identified and the cytotoxin assay was performed from a cell free
supernatant. The tables below present the data from these studies.
Assay vs. Enriched Culture Comparison
A total of 741 specimens were tested by both the artus C. difficile QS-RGQ MDx Kit
and enriched toxigenic culture. The overall assessment of sensitivity and specificity
versus enriched toxigenic culture is shown below (Table 9).

was estimated as 18.2% (135/741) when tested using the artus C. difficile QS-RGQ
MDx Kit. Of the patient population included in the study, the majority of patients
were senior adults (≥60 years) and the prevalence of C. difficile in this age group was
found to be 19% (75/395). The next largest age group was adults (age >21 to ≤59
years) and the prevalence was found to be 16% (52/324). The remaining patient
population included one infant (<2 years), 6 children (≥2 to <12 years), 9 adolescents
(≥12 to <18 years), and 6 transitional adolescents (≥18 to ≤21 years).
N. Instrument Name:
QIAsymphony RGQ MDx system
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The QIAsymphony RGQ MDx system consists of 3 subsystems: the QIAsymphony SP
(QSSP) for sample preparation, the QIAsymphony AS (QSAS) for assay set-up and the
Rotor-Gene Q MDx (RGQ MDx) for target amplification and detection.
2. Software:
The QIAsymphony SP and QIAsymphony AS are used in combination with the
QIAsymphony software (version 4.0) and the RGQ MDx is used in combination with
the Rotor-Gene AssayManager analysis software (version 1.0). As part of the
QIAsymphony RGQ MDx system, cycler control, data analysis and reporting with
the Rotor-Gene MDx instrument are done by the Rotor-Gene AssayManager 1.0 software
using plug-ins, which contain specific analysis algorithms and configurations.
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes X or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
For specimen identification, switch on the QIAsymphony SP/AS, and wait until the
“Sample Preparation” screen appears and the initialization procedure has finished. Then
log in to the instrument and load the sample drawer with the positive and negative
controls. Next load the “Sample” drawer with the samples and using the “Integrated
run” setup on the QIAsymphony touchscreen, enter the required information for each
batch of samples to be processed. Then define the assay to run, define the QIAsymphony
AS batch, load the “Sample” drawer with the internal control mixture, define the internal
control positions and start the run.

--- Page 16 ---
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The QIAsymphony SP instrument is designed to perform automated purification
of nucleic acids in combination with QIAsymphony DSP Kits. An assay is developed for
use with a specific QIAsymphony DSP Kit based on the application and sample type.
The QIAsymphony AS instrument is designed to perform automated assay setup and is
physically connected to the QIAsymphony SP. The eluate transfer between
QIAsymphony SP and QIAsymphony AS is done automatically. After the assay setup is
complete, the user needs to remove the assay rack from the QIAsymphony AS. The
Rotor-Gene strip tubes must be sealed with lids, transferred to the Rotor-Gene Q MDx
and secured with a locking ring. The Rotor-Gene Q MDx instrument is a real-time
nucleic acid amplification and detection system.
5. Calibration:
N/A. The QS-RGQ MDx system does not require calibration.
6. Quality Control:
A bacterial species unrelated to toxigenic C. difficile is introduced into each specimen
during sample preparation to serve as an internal control. The internal control bacteria
are lysed simultaneously with toxigenic C. difficile in the specimen, and amplified in
the same reaction as the C. difficile targets using PCR, and serve to demonstrate that the
entire assay process has proceeded correctly for each specimen. Kit also contains a
positive and negative control for use in the assay run.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
