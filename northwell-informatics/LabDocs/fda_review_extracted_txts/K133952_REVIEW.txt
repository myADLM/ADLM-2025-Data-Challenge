I. Device Description:
The VITEK® 2 AST card is a miniaturized, abbreviated and automated version of the
doubling dilution technique for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).
Each VITEK® 2 test card contains 64 microwells, containing a premeasured amount of a
specific antibiotic in a culture medium base. A control well, containing only culture medium,
is included on all cards. A suspension of organism from a pure culture is prepared in a tube
containing 0.45-0.5% sterile saline and standardized to a McFarland 0.5 using the
DensiCHEK Plus™. The VITEK 2 System automatically fills, seals and places the card into
the incubator/reader. The VITEK 2 Compact has a manual filling, sealing and loading
operation. The VITEK 2 Systems monitor the growth of each well in the card over a defined
period of time. At the completion of the incubation cycle, a report is generated that contains
the MIC value along with the interpretive category result for each antibiotic contained on the
card.
The VITEK® 2 YS Flucytosine has the following concentrations in the card: 1, 4, 16, and 32
μg/mL (equivalent standard method concentration by efficacy in μg/mL). The MIC result
range for the VITEK® 2 card is 1 - 64.

has begun. Periodic light transmittance samplings of the same well measure organism growth
by how much light is prevented from going through the well. Several parameters based on
the growth characteristics observed are used to provide appropriate input for the MIC
calculations. Discriminate analysis is used to develop the algorithm that determines the
susceptibility result for all antimicrobials on the VITEK® 2 System. The MIC result must be
linked to organism identification in order to determine a category interpretation. A category
interpretation (SIR) will be reported along with each MIC result.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Reproducibility studies were performed using ten isolates (four isolates of C. krusei
and six isolates of C. norvegensis) in triplicate at three external clinical sites on three
separate days. The studies included both the auto- and manual dilution methods with the
VITEK 2 instrument system and the manual dilution method with the VITEK 2 Compact
instrument system. Greater than 95% reproducibility was demonstrated with both the
VITEK 2 and VITEK 2 Compact Systems. A summary of the reproducibility study
performance is provided in Table 1 below.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Inoculum density control was monitored using the DensiCHEK Plus™ instrument.
The DensiCHEK Plus™ was standardized weekly with all results recorded and in
expected range.
Quality control testing was conducted throughout comparative testing at each site
using two recommended quality control strains: Candida krusei (ATCC 6258) and
Candida parapsilosis (ATCC 22019). In those instances where the test result was
out-of-range for all replicates of the reference method, all data from that day’s testing
was considered invalid and the testing for that day was repeated.
The QC organisms were tested a minimum of 20 times at 24 and 48 hour incubation

times by the reference method, the VITEK 2 instrument platform using both auto- and
manual dilution methods, and the VITEK 2 Compact instrument platform using the
manual dilution method. QC results for the VITEK 2 AST-YS Flucytosine were
within the expected results range ≥ 99% of the time for both dilution methods. The
MIC result range of the VITEK 2 AST-YS Flucytosine (≤ 1 - ≥ 64 µg/mL) does not
cover the expected CLSI/FDA QC range for C. parapsilosis for the 24 hour or 48
hour incubation reference method. All test instrument values ≤ 1 µg/mL for C.
parapsilosis were considered to be in QC. A summary of the QC performance is
provided in Tables 2 and 3 below.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The performance of the VITEK 2 AST YS Flucytosine was established for Candida
spp. with a clinical study conducted at three external clinical sites. Testing was done
on 557 fresh clinical isolates and 118 challenge isolates in comparison to the broth
microdilution reference method incubated at 48 hours as described in CLSI
documents M27-A3 and M27-S4. Both automated and manual dilution methods were
tested on the VITEK 2 system. Challenge isolates were also tested with the manual
dilution method on the VITEK 2 Compact. Clinical performance was acceptable.
Essential agreement was calculated for when the VITEK 2 system results were within
+/- two doubling dilutions of the reference method results. Category agreement was
calculated for when the VITEK 2 system result interpretations agreed exactly with the
reference method result interpretations. Evaluable results were defined as when both
the reference method results and the VITEK 2 system results were on-scale.
Evaluable results were also defined as when the reference method results were on-
scale and off-scale VITEK 2 system results clearly did not agree within the accepted
+/- two doubling dilutions. Results are summarized in Table 4 below.
