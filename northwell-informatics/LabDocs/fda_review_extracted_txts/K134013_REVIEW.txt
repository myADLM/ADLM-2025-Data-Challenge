product. The tests listed were performed by the manufacturer and/or independent
laboratories using manufacturer supported reagents and a representative sampling of
this lot of product. The sponsor recommends that each laboratory establish its own
acceptable ranges and the values provided be used only as guides.
Stability: The sponsor’s unopened, lyophilized shelf-life and reconstituted open-vial
stability protocols and acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable.
Shelf-life stability studies: Accelerated stability studies: control materials were stored
at three different elevated temperatures then periodically reconstituted and tested
against vials stored under normal conditions (2-8°C). Accelerated stability study
model and data supports shelf life claim of 37 months at 2-8°C storage. Real time
testing is ongoing.
Open-vial stability studies: the reconstituted controls were tested at periodic intervals
at day 0, 3, 28 and 35. The results support the claim of 28 days open vial stability
when stored at 2-8°C.
