I. Device Description:
The AmpliVue®HSV 1+2 Assay is an in vitro diagnostic test for the qualitative detection and
differentiation of HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNA isolated from cutaneous or mucocutaneous lesion
specimens collected with swabs from symptomatic patients. The assay utilizes helicase-
dependent amplification (HDA) for the amplification of highly conserved HSV-1 and HSV-2
gene sequences and a self-contained disposable amplification detection device that allows for
visual evaluation of assay results without analytical instrumentation.
The AmpliVue® HSV 1+2 Assay consists of three major steps: 1) specimen preparation, 2)
amplification of target gene sequences specific to HSV-1 and HSV-2 by HDA, and 3)
detection of the amplified DNA by target-specific hybridization probes by a colorimetric
reaction on a lateral-flow strip which is embedded in a self-contained disposable cassette to
prevent amplicon contamination.
The AmpliVue®HSV 1+2 Assay kit contains 16 tests per kit. The components are provided
in a single box and are: 16 each of Dilution Tubes, Reaction Tubes, Detection Cassettes, and
Amplicon Cartridges.

L. Test Principle:
The AmpliVue® HSV 1+2 Assay consists of three major steps: 1) specimen preparation, 2)
amplification of target gene sequences specific to HSV-1 and HSV-2 by HDA, and 3)
detection of the amplified DNA by target-specific hybridization probes via a colorimetric
reaction on a lateral-flow strip which is embedded in a self-contained disposable cassette to
prevent amplicon contamination.
Specimen preparation involves one dilution step in which specimens in viral transport
medium are diluted 80-fold in Dilution Tubes. The diluted samples are transferred into a 0.2
mL Amplification Tube containing lyophilized HDA reagents. Incubation at 64°C for 45
minutes results in the release of the HSV DNA and subsequent isothermal amplification of
the target sequence. The amplified DNA is detected by a set of specific detection probes
included in the Amplification Tube: HSV-1 target hybridizes to two specific probes, one
labeled with Biotin (BioTEG) and the other with Digoxigenin (DIG), while HSV-2 target
hybridizes to two specific probes labeled with Biotin (BioTEG) and 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-
FAM). A competitive internal control (IC) is included in the Amplification Tube to monitor
for inhibition, reagent failure or device failure. The IC target is amplified by HSV-2 specific
primers and hybridizes to the biotin-labeled HSV-2 probe and an IC specific probe labeled
with 2, 4-dinitrophenyl (DNP-TEG).
Detection of the amplified DNA with specific probes is achieved by AmpliVue cassettes. The
self-contained AmpliVue cassettes carry lateral-flow DNA detection strips coated with anti-
DNP antibodies (C line), anti-DIG antibodies (T1 line) and anti-FAM antibodies (T2 line).
HSV-1 amplicon complexed with BioTEG and DIG-labeled probes is captured by anti-DIG
antibodies at the T1 line and HSV-2 amplicon complexed with BioTEG and FAM-labeled
probes is captured by anti-FAM antibodies at the T2 line, while the IC amplicon complexed

biotin in the amplicon-probe complexes captures the streptavidin-conjugated color particles
for visualization and the test result is shown as colored lines that are visually read.
Interpretation of the assay results:
· Positive: Always read the Test lines (T1 and T2) first.
o When T1 line is visible, report the assay result as “HSV-1 DNA detected”.
o When T2 line is visible, report the assay result as “HSV-2 DNA detected”.
o When T1 and T2 are visible, report the assay result as “HSV-1 and HSV-2 Positive:
HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNA detected
· Negative: When no visible T line is present (T1-/T2-), a visible C line indicates that the
Internal Control DNA has been amplified and detected, eliminating the possibility of a
false negative due to failure of amplification or device, and thus the assay result should
be reported as negative - “no HSV DNA detected”. The C line intensity may vary with
each test. Any pink to red colored visible line in the control signifies a valid test.
· Invalid: If T and C lines are not present (T1- /T2-/C-), then the assay is invalid and the
test needs to be repeated.

The interpretation of the assay results is carried out according to the following criteria:
Test line 1 Test line 2 Control line
Interpretation of result
(T1) Reading (T2) Reading (C) Reading
T1+ T2- C+ or C- HSV-1 Positive: HSV-1 DNA detected
T1- T2+ C+ or C- HSV-2 Positive: HSV-2 DNA detected
HSV-1 and HSV-2 Positive: HSV-1 and
T1+ T2+ C+ or C-
HSV-2 DNA detected
Negative: No HSV-1 or HSV-2 DNA
T1- T2- C+
detected
Invalid: Failure due to inhibitory specimen,
T1- T2- C- reagent failure, or device failure. Repeat test
with original specimen.
Note: The absence of a C line (control) in conjunction with a positive test line (T1, T2 or T1
and T2) means that target material was successfully amplified. This occurs because of the over
abundance of amplicons that generates competition with the internal control target.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Reproducibility: The reproducibility of the AmpliVue® HSV 1+2 Assay was
evaluated at three test sites using a panel consisting of four panel members: HSV 1+2
High Negative; HSV-1 Low Positive; HSV 1+2 Moderate Positive; and HSV-2 Low
Positive members. The HSV-1 Low Positive member served as a HSV-2 Negative
member and the HSV-2 Low Positive member served as a HSV-1 Negative member.
The panel members were prepared in HSV Negative Matrix that consisted of a pool
of HSV negative cheek swabs in M4 medium. HSV Negative Matrix was spiked with
quantified HSV-1 and HSV-2 stocks at pre-determined TCID concentrations. The
50
HSV-1 and HSV-2 stocks were diluted in the HSV Negative Matrix to three (3)
different concentration levels, defined as High Negative (0.3 x LoD), Low Positive (1
x LoD) and Moderate Positive (3 x LoD level).
Each run tested the four member panel in triplicate and also included three each of
HSV-1 positive control, HSV-2 positive control and negative control. The external
positive controls used were HSV-1 and HSV-2 plasmid DNA. Two (2) operators per
test site each carried out one run of the four member panel plus controls per test day
for five (5) days using one lot of the AmpliVue® HSV 1+2 Assay.
Results of the reproducibility study for the AmpliVue® HSV 1+2 Assay performed at
three sites are presented in the tables below.

Precision:
The repeatability study used the same four member panel as used for the
reproducibility study. As for the reproducibility study, the HSV-1 Low Positive
member served as a HSV-2 Negative member and the HSV-2 Low Positive member
served as a HSV-1 Negative member. The HSV-1 and HSV-2 stocks were diluted in
the HSV Negative Matrix to three (3) different concentration levels, defined as High
Negative (0.3 x LoD), Low Positive (1 x LoD), and Moderate Positive (3 x LoD
level).
Each run tested the panel of four members in triplicate by two (2) operators, twice a
day (2X) for twelve (12) days on all three instruments (triplicate testing x 2 operators
x 12 days = 72 results per level for each virus). Positive and negative controls were
run in triplicate with each test run. The external positive controls used were HSV-1
and HSV-2 plasmid DNA. Results of the Repeatability study for the AmpliVue®HSV

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Internal Control
The competitive internal control (IC) consists of plasmid DNA. The IC target
sequence is amplified using the same primer set that amplifies the HSV-2 target
sequence. The internal sequence of the IC target is different from the HSV target
sequences and is detected by an IC-specific probe. After amplification, the IC
amplicon-probe complexes are detected as a visible Control line by anti-DNP
antibodies. The IC DNA and probes are pre-mixed in the Amplification Reagent.
External Controls
The assay Positive Controls are commercially available external positive HSV-1 and
HSV-2 from patient specimens. The controls are intended to monitor reagent and
cassette failure. Previously characterized positive HSV-1 and HSV-2 specimens may
be used in lieu of commercial HSV-1 and HSV-2 controls. The assay Negative
Control consists of blank viral transport medium or previously characterized negative
specimen and is used to detect reagent or environmental contamination (or carry-
over) by either HSV DNA or amplicons.
Note: For the analytical studies, HSV-1 and HSV-2 plasmid DNA were used as the
positive external controls. The plasmid DNA contains HSV-1 or HSV-2 target
sequences. For the clinical studies, positive HSV-1 and HSV-2 patient specimens
were used as the external controls.
d. Detection limit:
A Limit of Detection (LoD) study was performed to evaluate the analytical sensitivity
of the AmpliVue®HSV 1+2 Assay using two representative viral strains of HSV-1
(McIntyre & HF) and two representative strains of HSV-2 (G & MS). Quantified
(TICD /mL) cultures of the HSV-1 and HSV-2 strains were serially diluted to five
50
(5) concentrations in HSV-negative matrix pools and tested in replicates of ten (10)
with three reagent lots. The observed LoD of a HSV strain was determined as the
lowest concentration level that had a positivity rate of >95%. The observed LoDs for
HSV-1 and HSV-2 were determined to be 1.1 x 105 TCID /mL and 1.1 x 104
50
TCID /mL, respectively.

The LoDs determined in the initial study were confirmed with the same two HSV-1
and two HSV-2 reference strains diluted to the observed LODs (1.1 x 105 TCID /mL
50
for HSV-1 and 1.1 x 104 TCID /mL for HSV-2) and tested with twenty (20)
50
replicates using three (3) lots of the AmpliVue HSV 1+2 Assay. Since all HSV-1 and
HSV-2 strains showed positivity rates of ≥95% with all three (3) validation lots, the
observed LoDs were confirmed for both HSV-1 and HSV-2.
Clinical Isolates Testing: In addition, twenty (20) HSV-1 and twenty (20) HSV-2
clinical isolates were cultured and quantified in TCID /mL. Each isolate was diluted
50
to the corresponding LoD in HSV-negative matrix and tested in triplicate. The
AmpliVue HSV 1+2 Assay was able to detect all 20 HSV-1 and 20 HSV-2 clinical
isolates at their corresponding LoD.
Assay LoD: The final assay LoD claim is 1.1 x 105 TCID /mL for HSV-1 and 1.1 x
50
104 TCID /mL for HSV-2.

e. Analytical specificity:
A study was performed to evaluate the performance of the AmpliVue® HSV 1+2
Assay in the presence of eighty-nine (89) microorganisms that might be found in
cutaneous or mucocutaneous lesion specimens. The panel members were obtained
from suppliers as purified genomic DNA (GD) or quantified cultures (QC), or
prepared in house (IHC) by growing each organism and quantifying the culture. Each
potentially interfering or cross-reactive microorganism was tested in three (3)
replicates in negative matrix. Clinically relevant levels of viruses and bacteria are
typically 106cfu/ml or higher for bacteria and 105pfu/ml or higher for viruses.
Purified and quantified DNA was used for nine (9) of the microorganisms. For these
microorganisms, 106 copies per ml (cp/ml) or higher was used. None of the eighty-
nine (89) microorganisms showed cross-reactivity with the assay.

f. Interference Studies
This study was performed to evaluate potential interference with the AmpliVue® HSV
1+2 Assay with a panel of thirty-three (33) substances, five different viral transport
media, and the 87 microorganisms from the cross reactivity panel that may be present
in clinical specimens. The study was carried out in the presence of HSV-1 and HSV-2
at 3 times the limit of detection (3 x LoD) to evaluate potential interference with the
detection of the HSV targets. The study was also carried out in the absence of HSV to
evaluate potential interference with the detection of the internal control of the
AmpliVue® HSV 1+2 Assay. Each potential interfering substance was tested in
triplicate.
Interfering Substances: The analytical performance of the AmpliVue® HSV 1+2
Assay was characterized in the presence of interfering substances at the potentially
highest (“the worst case”) concentrations to evaluate the susceptibility of the HSV
assay to interference. Each interfering substance was introduced into the assay by
directly wetting a clean, dry Remel M4 kit swab with the substance and placing the
swab directly in transport medium. Calculated concentrations are based on an
estimated volume of 200µL of substance introduced by the swab. Each panel member
was tested in triplicate spiked with HSV-1 HF and HSV-2 G strains separately at 3 x
LoD. The panel was also tested in triplicate in the absence of HSV transport medium
to see if the potentially interfering substances interfere with the detection of the
internal control. No interference was observed in the presence of the potential
interfering substances tested.

Viral Transport Media: The performance of the AmpliVue® HSV 1+2 Assay was
assessed with the following viral transport media: Remel M4RT, Remel M5, Bartels
VTM, and BD Universal Viral Transport (UVT)/Copan UTM. Remel M4 had
previously been assessed and found to not interfere with the assay. Each transport
medium was tested after spiking with HSV-1 HF and HSV-2 G strain to a final
concentration of approximately 3 x LOD to determine if the viral transport medium
interferes with the detection of HSV targets in positive samples. The media were
tested in the absence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 (transport medium only) to see if the viral
transport media interfere with the detection of the internal control in negative
samples.
There was no interference observed with the Remel M4RT, Remel M5, Bartels VTM,
and BD UVT/Copan UTM media for the detection of HSV-1 and HSV- 2 target or
the internal control. Remel M4RT, Remel M5, Bartels VTM, and BD UVT/Copan
UTM did not interfere with the detection of HSV-1 and HSV-2 target or the internal
control.
Cross-Reactivity Panel Members: The performance of the AmpliVue® HSV 1+2
Assay was characterized by testing the eighty-nine (89) microorganisms that were
evaluated for cross reactivity in the presence of HSV-1 HF and HSV-2 G at 3 x LoD
separately to see if the presence of any of these 89 organisms interferes with the
detection of HSV targets. Each panel member was tested in triplicate. None of the
cross reactivity panel members interfered with the detection of HSV-1 and HSV-2
target.
g. Specimen Stability
A study was performed to assess the stability of HSV-1 and HSV-2 in viral transport
media in accordance with recommended storage and handling specifications of each
medium tested. Based on the supporting data, HSV-1 and HSV-2 were stable in all
five (5) media for 7 days at 2 - 8°C, and for 34 days at -70°C.
h. Competitive Inhibition
The performance of the AmpliVue® HSV 1+2 Assay was assessed for competitive
interference using simulated samples in two studies mimicking co-infections. The
first study used simulated samples with one target at a concentration near the LoD (3
x LOD) and the other target at higher concentrations (30 x LOD to 3000 x LOD). The
second study used simulated samples that had equal concentrations of HSV-1 virus
and HSV-2 virus (3 x LOD to 3000 x LOD).
In the first study, competitive inhibition was not observed with simulated samples
containing one target at a concentration near the LOD (3 x LOD) and the other target
at up to 300 x LOD. However, competitive inhibition was observed for both HSV-1
and HSV-2 with simulated samples containing one target at a concentration near the
LOD (3 x LOD) and the other target at 3000 x LOD.

--- Page 17 ---
In the second study, competitive inhibition was not observed with simulated samples
containing equal concentrations of HSV-1 virus and HSV-2 virus, from 3 x LOD to
3000 x LOD.
i. Carry-over/Cross Contamination
Test results confirm that carry-over/cross contamination does not occur with the
AmpliVue® HSV 1+2 Assay. High HSV-1 (HSV-2) positive samples were tested in
series alternating with negative samples. In order to challenge the device, cultured
and quantified viral stock served as high positive sample. The HSV-1 HF (7.96 x 108
TCID /mL) and HSV-2 G (2.27 x 107 TCID /mL) stocks were used directly without
50 50
dilution, for the highest concentration available. Remel M4 viral transport medium
was used as the negative sample. Ten (10) replicates of negative sample together with
assay controls were run by two (2) operators to confirm that negative samples (Remel
M4 viral transport medium) generate a negative result 100% of the time. Five (5)
replicates of high-concentration positive and negative samples were tested in a series
with alternating sample types. All HSV-1 and HSV-2 high positive samples gave
positive results and all the negative samples gave HSV negative results.
2. Comparison Studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison/clinical performance evaluation was done against a gold
standard/reference method using the FDA cleared, ELVIS® HSV ID/Typing Test
System (Diagnostic Hybrid, Inc.), i.e., cell culture using an enzyme linked virus
inducible system with HSV typing by fluorescently labeled antibodies. The testing
description and data are listed in the Clinical Studies Section below (Section 3).
b. Matrix comparison: N/A
3. Clinical Studies:
a. Clinical Sensitivity: N/A
b. Clinical Specificity: N/A
c. Other clinical supportive data (when a. and b. are not applicable):
The performance of the AmpliVue® HSV 1+2 Assay was compared with the ELVIS®
HSV ID/Typing Test System (Diagnostic Hybrid, Inc.) which is a gold standard
reference method i.e., Cell Culture using an enzyme linked virus inducible system
with HSV typing by fluorescently labeled antibodies.
Clinical Performance
The performance of the AmpliVue® HSV 1+2 Assay was evaluated at five
geographically diverse locations within the United States. A total of one thousand
17

--- Page 18 ---
three hundred and fifty-five (1,355) specimens from symptomatic male and female
patients was tested. Three (3) cultures (0.2%) were unable to be read due to gross
microbial contamination (there was insufficient quantity of each sample to repeat the
culture). Four (4) specimens (0.3%) were positive for HSV in the ELVIS culture
system, but the virus could not be identified as HSV-1 or HSV-2. Ten (10)
specimens remained invalid upon repeat testing by the AmpliVue® HSV 1+2 Assay,
and two (2) specimens were unavailable for re-testing. These nineteen (19) specimens
were removed from performance analysis. The ages of the patient population ranged
from 5 years to 60 years. The swab specimens were categorized as cutaneous (e.g.,
skin lesion, genital - penis), or mucocutaneous (e.g., anorectal, genital –
vaginal/cervical, nares, ocular, oral lesion and urethral).
The reference ELVIS viral culture used in this study is unable to detect co-infected
specimens and cannot identify HSV-1 if HSV-2 is identified first. Consequently, if a
specimen was positive for HSV-2, it was removed from the calculation of the HSV-1
clinical performance. Two hundred and eleven (211) specimens identified as HSV-2
positive by ELVIS were removed from the initial 1,336 specimens. The tables below
show 1,125 HSV-1 specimens from cutaneous and mucocutaneous lesions.

4. Clinical cut-off: N/A
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The prevalence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 with the AmpliVue® HSV 1+2 Assay in cutaneous
(e.g., skin lesion, genital - penis) or mucocutaneous (e.g., anorectal, genital –
vaginal/cervical, nares, ocular, oral lesion and urethral) specimens was estimated for the
1,343 specimens with valid AmpliVue® HSV 1+2 Assay results. Seven of the 1,343
specimens that had valid AmpliVue® HSV 1+2 Assay results were not included in the
performance analysis due to contamination or invalid results by the reference method;
these seven samples were included in the calculations of prevalence
The prevalence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 with the AmpliVue® HSV 1+2 Assay was
calculated for the combined sites based on the age of the patient and the specific source
of specimen and the results are presented below.
