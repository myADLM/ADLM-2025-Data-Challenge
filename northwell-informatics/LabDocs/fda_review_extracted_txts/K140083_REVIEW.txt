510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
A. 510(k) Number:
K140083
B. Purpose of Submission:
The purpose of the submission is the premarket notification for the Enteric Pathogens
Nucleic Acid Test which is intended to be run on the Verigene System.
C. M easurand:
The Verigene Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test is performed on the automated
Nanosphere Verigene System utilizing reverse transcription (RT), polymerase chain reaction
(PCR), and array hybridization to detect specific gastrointestinal microbial nucleic acid gene
sequences:
· Campylobacter Group (comprised of C. coli, C. jejuni, and C. lari)
· Salmonella species
· Shigella species (including S. dysenteriae, S. boydii, S. sonnei, and S. flexneri)
· Vibrio Group (comprised of V. cholerae and V. parahaemolyticus)
· Yersinia enterocolitica
· Shiga toxin 1 gene and Shiga toxin 2 gene virulence markers
D. Type of Test:
The Verigene Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test is a molecular assay which relies on
detection of specific nucleic acid targets in a microarray format. For each of the bacterial
nucleic acid sequences detected by Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test, unique Capture
and Mediator oligonucleotides are utilized, with gold nanoparticle probe-based endpoint
detection. The Capture oligonucleotides are covalently bound to the microarray substrate
and hybridize to a specific portion of the nucleic acid targets. The Mediator
oligonucleotides have a region which bind to a different portion of the same nucleic acid
targets and also have a sequence which allows binding of a gold nanoparticle probe.
Catalytic enhancement of the bound gold nanoparticle probes at the capture sites results
in gold-silver aggregates that scatter light with high efficiency and provide accurate
detection of target capture.

H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
The Verigene Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test (EP) is a multiplexed, qualitative
test for simultaneous detection and identification of common pathogenic enteric
bacteria and genetic virulence markers from liquid or soft stool preserved in Cary-Blair
media, collected from individuals with signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal
infection. The test is performed on the automated Nanosphere Verigene System
utilizing reverse transcription (RT), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and array
hybridization to detect specific gastrointestinal microbial nucleic acid gene sequences
associated with the following pathogenic bacteria:
• Campylobacter Group (comprised of C. coli, C. jejuni, and C. lari)
• Salmonella species
• Shigella species (including S. dysenteriae, S. boydii, S. sonnei, and S. flexneri)
• Vibrio Group (comprised of V. cholerae and V. parahaemolyticus)
• Yersinia enterocolitica
In addition, EP detects the Shiga toxin 1 gene and Shiga toxin 2 gene virulence
markers. Shiga toxin producing E. coli (STEC) typically harbor one or both genes that
encode for Shiga Toxins 1 and 2.
EP is indicated as an aid in the diagnosis of specific agents of gastrointestinal illness, in
conjunction with other clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological information; however,

is not to be used to monitor these infections. EP also aids in the detection and
identification of acute gastroenteritis in the context of outbreaks.
Due to the limited number of positive specimens collected for certain organisms during
the prospective clinical study, performance characteristics for Yersinia enterocolitica,
Vibrio Group and Shigella species were primarily established with contrived
specimens.
Concomitant culture is necessary for organism recovery and further typing of bacterial
agents.
EP results should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient
management decisions. Confirmed positive results do not rule out co-infection with
other organisms that are not detected by this test, and may not be the sole or definitive
cause of patient illness. Negative EP results in the setting of clinical illness compatible
with gastroenteritis may be due to infection by pathogens that are not detected by this
test or non-infectious causes such as ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, or
Crohn’s disease.
2. Indication(s) for use:
Same as Intended Use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For prescription use only.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Verigene System
I. Device Description:
The Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test is performed on the Verigene System which is
a fully automated, bench-top molecular diagnostics workstation. The System enables
automated nucleic acid extraction from unformed stool specimens (liquid or soft)
preserved in Cary-Blair media and detection of bacterial-specific target DNA. The
Verigene System consists of two components: the Verigene Reader and the Verigene
Processor SP.
The Reader is the Verigene System’s user interface, which serves as the central control
unit for all aspects of test processing, imaging, and result generation using a touch-screen
control panel and a barcode scanner. The Verigene Processor SP executes the test
procedure, automating the steps of sample preparation, target amplification hybridization
to the detection microarray. Detection and identification of bacterial-specific DNA is
performed in a microarray format by using gold nanoparticle probe-based technology.
Once the specimen is loaded by the operator, all other fluid transfer steps are performed
by an automated pipette that transfers reagents between wells of the trays and finally

--- Page 4 ---
Page - 4/45
loads the specimen into the Test Cartridge for hybridization. Single-use disposable test
consumables and a self-contained Verigene Test Cartridge are utilized for each sample
tested with the Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test assay.
To obtain the test results after test processing is complete, the user removes the Test
Cartridge from the Processor SP, and inserts the substrate holder into the Reader for
analysis. Light scatter from the capture spots is imaged by the Reader and intensities
from the microarray spots are used to make a determination regarding the presence
(Detected) or absence (Not Detected) of a bacterial nucleic acid sequence/analyte. This
determination is made by means of software-based decision algorithm resident in the
Reader.

L. Test Principle:
The Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test is performed on samples of stool preserved in
Cary-Blair media, collected from individuals suspected of having acquired an enteric
infection. The provided flocked swab is dipped into the specimen until flocked tip is fully
immersed. Once evenly coated, the swab is transferred to the Stool Prep Buffer tube and
broken at the pre-formed scored breakpoint. The Stool Prep Buffer tube is sealed with a
screw cap and thoroughly vortexed and centrifuged to ensure a proper mixture of the
specimen. Approximately 200 μL of the prepared Stool Prep Buffer (SLB) is pipetted
into the Specimen Well of the Extraction Tray and the Drawer Assembly is closed to
initiate the test. An automated pipettor performs all further fluidic transfers during the
Sample Extraction and Amplification steps.
Sample processing and analysis occurs in two phases: (i) Sample Preparation – Cells are
lysed and purified by a magnetic bead-based bacterial DNA isolation procedure. The
Sample Preparation steps occur within the Processor SP’s Extraction Tray, which is
preloaded with all reagents required to extract purified nucleic acid from the blood
culture specimen. (ii) Target Amplification – Purified nucleic acid is amplified using a
multiplex PCR based amplification to generate target-specific amplicons. Amplification
of the extracted DNA occurs on the Amplification Tray. At the end of these processes,
the extracted and amplified DNA is mixed with sample buffer and transferred to the Test
Cartridge.
The Test Cartridge consists of two parts: a Reagent Pack containing reservoirs preloaded
with reagents required for various steps of a specific test in the Processor SP, and a
Substrate Holder which houses the microarray. Within the Test Cartridge, the bacterial
DNA hybridizes to complementary sequence-specific DNA oligonucleotides, known as
capture oligonucleotides, arrayed on the surface of a microarray within the Substrate
Holder. The “captured DNA” also hybridizes to a second DNA oligonucleotide, known

--- Page 8 ---
Page - 8/45
as a mediator oligonucleotide, which is contained in the test-specific sample buffer. The
mediator oligonuceotide contains two sequence domains: one domain is complementary
to the genomic DNA target and a second domain is complementary to a common
oligonucleotide attached to a signal generating gold nanoparticle probe. After washing
away any DNA not hybridized to the captures, the probe is exposed to the captured
mediator/target complex. Presence of the gold nanoparticle probes at a particular location
on the substrate is then further amplified with silver enhancement reagents. All the
reagents required for the above steps are contained within the Reagent Pack and are
sequentially added to the microarray and transferred out to the waste well. Once the test
processing is complete, the Test Cartridge is removed from the Processor SP and the
Reagent Pack is removed and discarded. The remaining Test Substrate is now ready for
imaging and analysis on the Reader. The high detection sensitivity derived from
evanescence-induced light scatter after the electrocatalytic enhancement of the bound
nanoparticle probes is measured by optical methods. The relative intensity of light scatter
detected from each arrayed test site is measured. After background subtraction, the signal
intensities are compared to a signal threshold for a decision regarding the presence or
absence of target. A final ‘Detected’ or ‘Not Detected’ result is provided for each analyte
in the test. These results are linked to the test and patient information entered at the
beginning of each test session to provide a results report.
M . Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Sample Preparation and Stability
Simulated Samples for Analytical Validation Studies
For the analytical studies, target organisms were spiked into a Negative Stool Matrix
(NSM) pool, whereas the clinical simulated specimens were prepared by spiking target
organism directly into individual negative stool specimens preserved in Cary-Blair
media. With the exception of the specimen stability study that used fresh clinical
samples, all of the analytical studies described below involved testing of simulated
samples using a Negative Stool Matrix (“NSM”); preparation of this matrix is described
below. Simulated samples are prepared by suspending cultured and quantified strains of
target bacterial organisms in the NSM.
The NSM was prepared by pooling individual de-identified residual stool specimens
preserved in Cary-Blair medium. These individual “Cary- Blair specimens” were
originally prepared by diluting unpreserved stool specimens (obtained from individuals
in the intended use population) in Cary-Blair medium such that the stool comprises
25% by volume of the resulting specimen. Each individual Cary-Blair specimen was
confirmed negative for target organisms by testing the specimen in duplicate with the
Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test (EP) test. Obtaining duplicate negative results for
all panel analytes qualified the specimen for inclusion in the negative pool. NSM was
formulated by pooling the negative Cary-Blair specimens, combining with Enteric
Stool Prep Buffer in a 1:5 ratio, and clarifying by centrifugation and collection of the
supernatant. The NSM pool was again tested with the Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid
Test in replicates of 20 and confirmed as negative.

--- Page 9 ---
Page - 9/45
To prepare the simulated samples for analytical testing, the target bacterial organism
was diluted and added to the NSM to achieve the appropriate organism concentration.
These simulated specimens were either used immediately (within 30 min of
preparation) or stored frozen at <-70°C until use.
Simulated Samples for Clinical Validation Study
Simulated samples used during the clinical validation study were prepared in a similar
manner to the samples used for analytical testing with one difference. During the
clinical validation study, target organisms were spiked directly into individual stool
specimens preserved in Cary-Blair media which were confirmed negative by the
Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test prior to entry into the study.
Frozen Simulated Sample Stability
The purpose of this study was to establish the performance of frozen simulated samples
for use during clinical and analytical validation. This study tested six representative
bacterial organisms (see Table 1). For each organism five concentrations were prepared
in a 3-fold serial dilution series using NSM. A sufficient starting volume of each
simulated sample was prepared to make at least eight individual single-use vials at each
dilution, each containing approximately 300 μL of sample. Baseline testing of the
freshly-prepared samples was performed in replicates of four; the four remaining vials
were stored frozen at < -70 ºC then thawed and tested. The starting concentration of
each sample was chosen to approximately bracket the Limit of Detection (LoD)
determined for each of the analytes (see Section 2). Initial testing was performed at a
concentration 3x higher than the established analytical LoD with 20 replicates. If a
20/20 detection rate was obtained, the previously established analytical LoD level was
tested in replicates of 20 to test whether the detection rate at this level was less than
19/20. If the initial results yielded 19/20 detection rate, no further testing was
conducted. If the initial results yielded less than 19/20 correct results, higher
concentrations (6x and 9x the analytical LoD) were tested until the ≥19/20 detection
rate was met. The results of this study as shown in Table 1 are acceptable to establish
the performance of frozen simulated samples for use in the clinical and analytical
validation studies.

2. Analytical performance:
Precision:
The precision of the Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test was established by
conducting an internal study. The study was conducted for four days and included the
following sources of variability: operators, days, consumable lots, and runs. Fourteen
unique samples were tested daily in duplicate by two operators for four non-
consecutive days for a total of 16 tests per sample (2 operators / day x 2 replicates /
operator x 4 days = 16 tests per sample). Positive and negative controls were run once
per combination of consumable lots received. The 14 sample panel for the precision
study was comprised of six unique strains at two concentrations (12 positive samples)
and two negative samples (Negative Stool Matrix and Clostridium difficile), as listed
in Table 2. Previously characterized and quantified pure Tris stocks were inoculated
into screened negative stool matrix (NSM) at a Moderate Positive (defined as
approximately 2-5x LoD) and a Low Positive (defined as approximately 1-2x LoD)
concentrations. Each unique specimen was divided into single-use aliquots of 300 μL
each and frozen at ≤ -70 °C.

The initial call rate for the Precision Study was 98.2% (220/224). There were four
initial “No Call” results. These samples were re-tested according to the retesting rules
found in the package insert and all yielded a valid test result upon retesting. The final
study results for the negative panel members, moderate positive samples and low
positive samples agreed 99.6% with the expected results. The summary results of the
Precision Study as shown in Table 3 establish acceptable within-laboratory precision
of the Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test.

Reproducibility:
The inter-laboratory reproducibility of the Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test was
established by a three external site study. The study included five days of testing
incorporating the following sources of imprecision: sites, operators, days,
consumable lots and runs. Fourteen unique samples were tested daily in triplicate by
two operators for five non-consecutive days at three sites for a total of 90 tests per
sample (3 sites x 2 operators / site x 3 replicates / operator x 5 days = 90 tests per
sample). Positive and negative controls were run at each site according to the study
protocol.
The 14 sample panel for this study was the same panel previously described in the
precision study and was comprised of six unique strains at two concentrations (12
positive samples) and two negative samples (Negative Stool Matrix and Clostridium
difficile), as listed in Table 2. For each strain, the panel included a “Low Positive”
sample, which would be expected to produce a positive result approximately 95% of
the time, and a “Moderate Positive” sample, which would be expected to yield a
positive result approximately 99% of the time.
The results of the reproducibility study are summarized in Table 4. This table shows
the agreement between the expected results and the obtained results for each sample
tested. A sample which yielded an initial ‘No Call’ test result with the Enteric
Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test was repeated from the original sample (new aliquot) per
the package insert instructions and the repeat result was considered the final result. A
sample which yielded a Pre-Analysis Error was also repeated using the original

The percent agreement across all sites was 99.1%. There were 24 discordant calls 19
of which were observed at the low positive concentration. The final study results for
the negative panel members were 100% agreement with the expected results. For the
moderate positive samples, it is expected that the target(s) present in the sample will
be detected approximately 99% of the time; in this study, the targets were detected at
an acceptable rate of 99.1%. Undetected targets were observed with five moderate
samples No. 4 (Salmonella), No. 6 (Shigella/Stx1), and No. 8 (Y. enterocolitica) at
two different sites. In the case of sample No. 6, only the Stx1 target of the sample was
not detected. These results suggest that the observations could be explained as
random events, likely related to variations in the concentration, characteristics, and
stability of the prepared samples. Concentration of the sample was surely a factor for
the low positive samples. It was expected that the target(s) in the low positive sample
would be detected approximately ≥ 95%; in this study, combined, the low positive
sample targets were detected at an acceptable rate of 96.7%. Undetected targets were
observed a total of 18 times with low samples No. 3 (E. coli / Stx2), No. 5
(Salmonella), No. 7 (Shigella/Stx1), and No. 9 (Y. enterocolitica) at three different
sites. In the case of sample No. 7, only the Stx1 target of the sample was not detected
once and only the Shigella target of the sample was not detected twice. Unexpectedly
on one occasion, Sample No. 7 also generated one false positive result, with Stx2
being detected in addition to Shigella and Stx1.

Internal Processing Controls
Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test (EP) is a ‘specimen-to-result’ detection system
wherein nucleic acids are isolated and identified by an automated process. In order to
decrease the likelihood of false results due to processing errors, all reagents are
prepackaged in single-use disposables which are actuated by the analysis instrument.
The following controls are built into the system to so that processing failures are
identified and the appropriate actions are taken.
An artificial DNA construct (INTL CTL 1 see Table 5) serves as the internal
hybridization control or “positive control for detection.” It is a synthetic DNA
construct present in the sample buffer and is hybridized in parallel with every test
sample. For a valid Negative test result, INTL CTL 1 needs to be “Detected”. If the
INTL CTL 1 is not valid, a no call result will be returned and the test should be
repeated according to the instructions in the package insert.
An MS2 Phage serves as a specimen isolation and amplification control and is
referred to as the Internal Processing Control 2 (INT CTL 2 see Table 5). This control
is added to each specimen prior to the extraction step. For a valid Negative test result,
both IC1 and IC2 must be “Detected.” If IC1 or IC2 are not detected a “No Call –

--- Page 15 ---
Page - 15/45
INT CTL 1” or a “No Call – INT CTL 2” is provided respectively. If both IC1 and
IC2 are not detected, a “NO CALL – INT CTL” result is provided. The recommended
action for any “No Call” decision is to repeat the test according to the instructions
package insert.
The Imaging Control (IC) is a set of oligonucleotide spots on the Test Substrate that
act as a quality check for proper fluid control and movement between the Test
Cartridge and the Reagent Pack. Inability to detect the imaging controls results in a
“No Call – No Grid.” The Imaging Control signal is generated when a signal probe
hybridizes to an oligonucleotide on the substrate. Signal at these spots indicates that
the steps of probe hybridization and signal enhancement were performed as intended.
The detection algorithm requires that all controls be valid before decisions regarding
the presence or absence of any other target on the panel can be reported. If all
controls are not within the predefined specification, a no call result will be obtained
and further action should be taken according to the product labeling.

to each test specimen.
Sample stability
This study involved testing six representative bacterial organisms (see Table 6). For
each organism five concentrations were prepared in a 3-fold serial dilution series
using NSM. One freeze-thaw cycle was required and therefore only one cycle was
evaluated. A sufficient starting volume of each simulated sample was prepared to
make at least eight individual single-use vials at each dilution, each containing
approximately 300 μL of sample. Baseline testing of the freshly-prepared samples
was performed in replicates of four; the four remaining vials were stored frozen at < -
70 ºC. The frozen samples were subsequently thawed and tested in replicates of four.
The starting concentration of each sample was chosen to bracket the Limit of
Detection (LoD) determined for each of the analytes. The acceptance criteria was that
the LoD determined for the frozen samples differed by no more than plus or minus 3x
from the fresh LoD.

The test results in Table 6 demonstrate that the lowest concentrations where all
replicates were detected were identical for two (Salmonella enterica and Yersinia
enterocolitica) of the six organisms and within 3x of the fresh LoD for the remaining
four organisms. The frozen LoD for Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli and
Vibrio parahaemolyticus were no more than 3x lower than the fresh LoD
determination, and frozen Shigella dysenteriae was detected at 3x higher
concentration than the corresponding fresh samples. All the LoD values were within
one log of the strain LoD determined reported in the Detection Limit study.
A total of 256 initial tests were performed during the study. The initial call rate was
99.6% (255/256) with one No Call-Int Ctl 1, which was repeated successfully for a
final call rate of 100% (256/256). The study supports the use of samples subjected to
a single freeze/thaw cycle interchangeably with fresh/unfrozen samples in the
analytical and clinical studies.

Detection Limit:
The Limit of Detection (LoD) study tested representative strains of bacteria detected
by the Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test as shown in Table 7. In a range finding
study, quantified preparations of bacterial strains were diluted in Negative Stool
Matrix. Each concentration in the dilution series was then tested in replicates of four.
The preliminary LoD concentration level for a specific organism was the lowest
concentration level whereby all four replicates tested positive. The LoD for a specific
organism was confirmed by testing 20 additional replicates at the preliminary LoD
concentration to establish that the strain was detected in at least 95% of the
measurements. If the detection rate was 100% (20/20), 20 replicates were tested at the
next lower concentration.

Analytical Reactivity/Specificity:
Reactivity:
Alignment of GenBank nucleic acid sequences of the proposed gene targets was the
first step toward generating and selecting the appropriate probes for the assay and to
confirm inclusivity by in silico analysis. Table 10 lists the targets, specific genes, and
the total number of GenBank nucleic acid sequence entries used to confirm
inclusivity of each gene target. Acceptability of the target was based on the evaluation
of the Minimum Percent Oligo Identity (e.g. the percent match between a proposed
probe set and the GenBank consensus sequence for each target).

An analytical reactivity study for the Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test was
designed to wet test reactivity towards clinically relevant microorganisms that
represent temporal, geographical, and phylogenic diversity for each claimed target at
concentrations at two to three times the LoD. Analytical reactivity of the Enteric
Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test was demonstrated with a panel of 111 bacterial strains
shown in summary in Table 11. To prepare the samples, bacterial stocks were

a Seven strains also contain Stx1 and/or Stx2, therefore, some strains have been counted
twice.
b Two (2) strains contain Stx1.
c Five (5) strains contain both Stx1 and Stx2.
All tested strains generated the expected calls when tested in triplicate at a
concentration of three times the LoD. These test results establish the reactivity claims
of the Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test test.
Shiga toxin 2 variants Stx2c, Stx2d, Stx2e, and Stx2g were tested for reactivity based
on in silico analysis only. These four variants were aligned with three unique
GenBank sequences per variant. Overall, only one mismatch was found in the
alignment of Stx2d. The remaining alignment results showed no mismatches with the
selected GenBank sequences. This analysis is acceptable to establish reactivity
toward the Stx2c, Stx2d, Stx2e and Stx2g variants. Shiga toxin 2 variant Stx2f was
determined via in silico analysis to be non-reactive with the test based on the high
degree of mismatches (maximum of 71% identity) between the selected GenBank
gene targets and test probes/primers.
Specificity:
A specificity study was designed to assess potential unintended reactivity of the
Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test with clinically relevant levels of enteric
pathogens and microorganisms that may be present in stool specimens but not
detectable by the test. A panel of 161 organisms listed in Table 12 through Table 14
was selected to establish test specificity. The panels were comprised of 135 bacterial
organisms, 21 viruses, four parasites and one human cell line.

Samples were tested with the Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test in triplicate and
prepared as follows.
Bacteria
The bacterial organisms were added to Negative Stool Matrix at a concentration of at
least 107CFU/mL. If an organism could not be accurately titered or was unavailable,
genomic DNA at an estimated genome equivalent copy number to 107CFU/mL was
added directly to the Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test Amplification Tray,
bypassing the DNA Extraction step of the Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test
procedure. The organisms tested in this study were obtained from commercial sources
and the identities of the organisms confirmed using the following procedures:
· Aerobic organisms were identified using the Gram Negative (GN) and Gram
Positive (GP) identification cards of the BioMérieux Vitek 2 system whenever
possible.
· Anaerobic organisms identified using the Remel RapID ANA II system.
· Microaerophilic organisms and Bacillus cereus (aerobic) were identified using
standard microbiological methods involving growth on selective culture
media, biochemical spot tests, and Gram stains.
Seven organisms, including Astrovirus and Sapovirus (two strains), and all four
parasites (Blastocystis hominis, Cryptosporidium parvum, Entamoeba histolytica, and
Giardia lamblia) were only commercially available as genomic DNA or RNA.
Additionally, Campylobacter hominis was unable to be successfully grown and
therefore genomic DNA/RNA was tested. For each of these, genomic DNA/RNA was
tested directly utilizing the amplification-hybridization steps of the test. To prepare
the samples, negative stool matrix was processed through the extraction step using the
Verigene Processor SP to generate a stool-containing eluent, to which DNA/RNA
was added (equivalent to ≥ 107copies/mL in stool). This mixture was then tested
using the amplification hybridization steps of the test.
Viruses
The viral species listed in Table 13 were added to Negative Stool Matrix to final
concentrations of >106PFU/mL stool. For the viruses that could not be accurately
titered or were unavailable (i.e., Astrovirus and Sapovirus), genomic RNA at a
genome equivalent copy number of 107copies/ml was added directly to the Enteric
Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test (EP) Amplification Tray such that amplification and
hybridization could be performed without the DNA extraction step.
Parasites
As described above, the four parasites listed in Table 13 were tested using
commercially purchased genomic DNA. In these test cases, the equivalent of ~106
copies of genomic DNA was added directly to the Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid
Test Amplification Tray such that amplification and hybridization could be performed
without the DNA extraction step.
Human Cell Line

--- Page 21 ---
Page - 21/45
The human cell line was obtained from commercial sources and was evaluated by
adding an aliquot to the Negative Stool Matrix at a concentration of ~105cells/mL
stool.

* Species not associated with human infections.
There are forty-four species of Vibrio that are not associated with infections in
humans. Two Vibrio strains were wet tested and the 15 species were analyzed in
silico to establish exclusivity. The remaining 27 species were not tested due to the
low prevalence of these species in human stool and a lack of sequence information in
public databases. The test package insert states this with the following product
limitations:
The following 15 species of Vibrio, each of which are NOT associated
with infections in humans and therefore unlikely to be encountered in
human stool, were shown NOT to be detected by EP based upon in silico
analysis only: V. anguillarum, V. brasiliensis, V. coralliilyticus, V.
crassostreae, V. cyclitrophicus, V. ichthyoenteri, V. kanaloae, V.
nigripulchritudo, V. ordalii, V. orientalis, V. rotiferianus, V. rumoiensis,
V. scophthalmi, V. splendidus, and V. tasmaniensis.
The following 27 species of Vibrio, each of which are NOT associated
with infections in humans and therefore unlikely to be encountered in
human stool, were not evaluated for exclusivity by wet testing or in silico
analysis due to a lack of genome sequence information: V. aerogenes, V.
aestuarianus, V. chagasii, V. diabolicus, V. diazotrophicus, V. ezurae, V.
fortis, V. gallicus, V. gazogenes, V. gigantis, V. halioticoli, V. hepatarius,

pomeroyi, V. proteolyticus, V. ruber, V. superstes, and V. xuii
One hundred and sixty samples of the 161 tested yielded negative results for all three
replicates performed. One enteric organism, Campylobacter insulaenigrae, generated
one “Campylobacter Detected” result of the three replicates tested. Repeat testing of
six replicates did not yield a positive result, therefore, the initial results suggesting
cross reactively were not reproducible. To further investigate the anomalous result,
bi-directional sequencing of the fusA gene region of Campylobacter insulaenigrae,
which encompasses the region detected by the EP test, was performed. The percent
homologies between the Campylobacter detection oligos and the Campylobacter
insulaenigrae sequences indicate the potential for the test to amplify and detect

Campylobacter insulaenigrae. As this is a novel species that has limited references
attributing this organism to disease in humans, a limitation will be placed in the
product labeling. Therefore, the package insert contains the following statement
regarding the potential for cross-reactivity with this species:
In rare instances, Campylobacter insulaenigrae may yield a false positive
“Campylobacter detected” result.
In summary, this study is acceptable to establish the specificity of the test to 160
enteric organisms under the stated test conditions
Assay cut-off:
The presence or absence of each target analyte is determined by the mean intensity of
target capture spots relative to the Signal Detection Threshold. The capture, mediator,
and PCR primer oligonucleotides in the Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test are
designed to eliminate sequence-related cross-reactivity, resulting in non-specific
target signal intensities at capture spots that are similar to the microarray background
signal. In contrast, target amplicon hybridization to complementary capture and
mediator probes are expected to give signals that are well-separated from negative
capture spots. When reading a test slide, multiple images of each array are taken at
increasing exposures times and the final target group mean intensity value for an
analyte is assigned at the shortest exposure at which the intensity exceeds the Signal
Detection Threshold. If none of the target signal exceeds the threshold for any
exposure, the mean spot intensity is evaluated at the longest exposure taken. With this
imaging and analysis design, a signal detection threshold of 30,000 was established to
generate a “Detected” call for the eight bacterial target spot groups and two controls
of Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test test.
In order to demonstrate the appropriateness of the cut-off value for this threshold, the
target mean intensity values observed with the Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test
were examined for the final confirmatory tests of the sixteen simulated bacterial
samples tested as part of the Limit of Detection Study. In addition, the cut-off data set
included the test results of three viral samples which represent negative control
samples. In this case, to better represent negative samples, the target intensity values
at the maximum exposure (1280 msec) were analyzed, thereby negating any potential
impact of the exposure cap limit upon detection of a masked viral target. With
replicates of 20 for each sample and ten target spot groups evaluated per test, a total
of 3800 data points (1120 expected positive) were assessed in the study.
A logistic fit analysis of Expected Results by Target Mean Intensity for the chosen
threshold shows that expected positive signals are well separated from the expected
negative target signals therefore the chosen threshold value distinguishes the “True
Positives” from the “True Negatives”. Acceptability of the chosen cut-off is
established by the LoD study data and the clinical validation data.

Interfering species
Microbial interference
Analytical testing was performed to establish that nonpathogenic microorganisms
present in stool do not interfere with the ability of the Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid
Test to detect enteric pathogens. Two representative bacterial organisms detected by
the Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test shown in Table 15 are Campylobacter jejuni
and Escherichia coli (Shiga toxin 1). These test panel members were evaluated for
potential interference in the presence of 14 normal flora microorganisms listed in
Table 16. These microorganisms represent highly prevalent bacterium known to be
present in the human colonas determined through literature review. This study was
conducted using simulated specimens in NSM prepared as previously described. Each
of representative panel organisms were added to NSM at a concentration of three
times the LoD determined for the organism (see Table 15). The normal flora bacteria
were spiked individually into each prepared specimen at a concentration of 107
CFU/mL with the exception of the parasites Blastocystis hominis and Entamoeba
histolytica which, due to titer constraints, were spiked into the NSM at concentrations
of 9x106cells/mL and 7x105cells/mL respectively. The resulting specimens were
tested in triplicate.

The Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test results for all 28 samples, tested in
triplicate, correctly identified the expected analytes for the two representative enteric
pathogens evaluated. These results establish that, under the conditions of this study,
microorganisms that may be present in stool samples do not interfere with the ability
of the Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test to detect enteric pathogens in a sample.
Interfering substances
An interfering substances study was performed to assess the potential inhibitory
effect of endogenous and exogenous substances that can commonly be found in
clinical stool specimens. Two organisms (see Table 17) representative of the target
analytes detected by the test (i.e.; one Gram-negative bacteria and one Shiga-toxin
releasing bacteria), were individually challenged with 22 potentially interfering
substances at high, medically relevant concentrations. The organisms were tested at
3x the LoD determined for each organism.
The panel of interferents tested is provided in Table 18. Each sample was prepared by
adding the appropriate mass or volume of the interfering substance to a volume of
Negative Stool Matrix to achieve the desired interferent/stool ratio. An individual
culture of each of two representative organisms was then added to the
NSM/interferent mixture to achieve a concentration of 3x LoD for the organism. Each
sample was tested in replicates of three. NSM/interferent samples without bacterial
organisms were also tested as controls.

Testing results correctly detected all the bacterial target organisms with one
exception. In the Campylobacter jejuni sample with Hydrocortizone, two of the three
replicates gave the expected calls while one replicate reported detection of Stx1 in
addition to the detection of Campylobacter jejuni. The additional call for Stx1 target
was determined to be a result of sample to sample contamination or error in sample
preparation since both Campylobacter jejuni and E. coli (Stx1) stocks were being
handled during sample prep. The Stx1 signal was similar with other Stx1 samples in
the study, supporting the conclusion that a sample preparation issue caused the false
positive. The correct call was made for Campylobacter jejuni therefore the results
support the conclusion that Hydrocortizone did not interfere with the test.
Competitive inhibition
In order to assess competitive inhibition in the EP test, binary combinations of all six
of the EP test panel organisms (see Table 19) representing all possible dual infections,
were evaluated. Contrived samples were prepared in Negative Stool Matrix (NSM),
with one panel organism present at a Low Positive titer (3x LoD) and a second
organism present at a High Positive titer (> 106CFU/mL stool). The performance of
the EP test was evaluated with each of the 30 unique sample combinations tested in
replicates of three.

for Campylobacter, an additional six (6) replicate tests of the Low Titer Campylobacter
coli and High Titer E. coli sample was performed. All the additional tests yielded correct
calls for both organisms, suggesting that the errant result was not indicative of systemic
competitive inhibition. Across the different binary combinations, Campylobacter coli at

six separate test runs. Six samples, each containing a High Positive level (5x106
CFU/mL) of one of the test panel members spiked into the Negative Stool Matrix were
evaluated. The same Negative Stool Matrix was utilized as the negative sample.

All of the negative samples yielded “Not Detected” calls for all the analytes, with the
exception of a single sample (Run 2, SP5) which generated a “No Call – INT CTL1”
result. For this sample, analysis of capture spot intensities showed no residual Salmonella
signal from the previously run sample and the “No Call” result was not attributable to a
carry-over event. Following the “No Call” result, both the High titer Salmonella enterica
sample and the Negative sample were repeat-tested, with the negative sample giving a
valid “Not Detected” call. In addition, all the High Positive samples yielded the expected
“Detected” results for the intended organism and “Not Detected” results for the other
analytes. These results are acceptable to establish the carry-over/cross-contamination of
the Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test.

4. Clinical studies:
A method comparison study was conducted at seven external clinical study testing sites:
Children’s Hospital Central California, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, Laboratory
Alliance of Central New York, Medical College of Wisconsin, Southern California
Permanente Medical Group, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, and
Washington University. The study was conducted under IRB supervision at each testing
and specimen acquisition site.
The Verigene System, including the Verigene Processor SP and the Verigene Reader, the
Verigene EP Test Kits (EP Test Cartridges and EP Extraction Trays) and EP
Amplification Trays used in the method comparison studies were identical to the devices
intended for commercialization with respect to their functional features and reagent
composition. Instrument and kit components were manufactured in compliance with the
applicable sections of the Quality System Regulations. The testing for this study was
performed using multiple lots of Test Cartridges, Extraction Trays, and Amplification
Trays. Verigene Processor SPs and Verigene Readers used in these studies were standard
production instruments. The software versions were validated for use according to
documented test protocols and developed according to Standard Operating Procedures.
Each site utilized one Verigene Reader and multiple Verigene Processor SP instruments,
depending on each site’s specimen enrollment and testing volume.
De-identified specimens tested in this study were enrolled from individuals receiving
routine care and were recommended for enteric pathogen testing. A portion of each
leftover residual unformed stool specimen in Cary-Blair media was obtained for testing.
The study inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed below:
Inclusion Criteria
· Specimen must be collected from subjects/patients which meet the institute’s
criteria for a suspected enteric pathogen, such as individuals presenting with
symptoms of gastrointestinal infection (e.g., significant diarrhea—new onset of 3
or more unformed or; watery stools per 24 hour period, abdominal pain, foul stool
odor, etc.);
· Specimen will consist of unformed (liquid or soft) stool specimens preserved in
Cary- Blair (or equivalent);
· Specimen will be residual and de-identified;
· Specimen must be of sufficient volume ≥ 5mL fresh stool preserved in Cary-Blair
media or equivalent;
· Fresh, unpreserved specimen must be transferred to Cary-Blair, or equivalent,
within 2 to 4 hours of specimen collection;
· Cary-Blair media specimen must have been stored according to manufacturer’s
directions before enrollment in the study;
· Upon enrollment in the study, store the specimen at Room Temperature;
· Specimens must be shipped for Reference Testing within 60 hours of stool
specimen collection;
· Specimens must be prepared into Stool Prep Buffer within 48 hours of collection;

--- Page 32 ---
Page - 32/45
· Specimens must have initial EP test performed within 24 hours of preparation of
Stool Prep Buffer;
· Best efforts to avoid enrolling multiple specimens from the same patient will be
made however, it is recognized that due to the specimen de-identification process
this cannot be guaranteed.
Exclusion Criteria
· Inability to perform EP on a specimen due to a protocol deviation (e.g.,
insufficient specimen, residual extracted nucleic acid not retained, incorrect
shipping, handling or storage);
· Nucleic acid not recovered from Extraction Tray;
· Any fresh, preserved specimen not tested within 48 hours of collection;
· Any specimen not tested within 24 hours of Stool Prep Buffer preparation;
· Hard stool (not unformed, liquid, or soft);
· Specimen contaminated with urine or water;
· Leaking container;
· Insufficient volume;
· Specimens received unpreserved which are put into Cary-Blair, or equivalent, >4
hours from collection;
· Specimen containing interfering substances such as castor oil, bismuth,
Metamucil, barium, Vaseline, or other cream contaminants (refer to institution
specimen collection criteria);
· Specimens collected in diapers;
· Rectal swab specimens;
· Specimens arriving to lab already in preservative collection media other than
Cary-Blair (or equivalent);
· Specimens not collected according to manufacturer’s instructions (under-filled or
overfilled specimens);
· Cary-Blair media is a yellowish color.
The study utilized four categories of specimens to establish performance:
1) Fresh: Prospectively-collected fresh Cary- Blair specimens enrolled and tested at
the study test sites;
2) Frozen: Prospectively-collected frozen Cary-Blair specimens enrolled and tested
at the study test sites;
3) Selected: De-identified archived frozen specimens collected and stored in Cary-
Blair media were obtained from the specimen acquisition sites. These specimens
were shipped frozen from each specimen acquisition site to the Sponsor, blinded
and sent to the method comparison study testing sites for testing. In parallel, each
specimen was tested by analyte-specific PCR amplification and bi-directional
sequencing (BDS), following a previously approved protocol. This testing was
performed to confirm the original analyte identification. If the original analyte
identification could not be confirmed, the specimen was excluded from the
method comparison study.

--- Page 33 ---
Page - 33/45
4) Simulated: Simulated frozen specimens were seeded Cary-Blair specimens using
glycerol stocks and shipped to/tested at the study test sites. Each simulated
specimen was made using a unique strain of the intended organism.
For all fresh and frozen prospective specimens bacterial identification reference testing
was performed at a central laboratory. Each specimen was cultured and suspected EP
colonies were isolated and run for Phenotype Identification on an FDA Cleared
Automated System. All samples were enriched in MacConkey Broth for suspected Shiga
toxin producing organisms followed by EHEC EIA testing. In addition, bi-directional
sequencing (BDS) systems were developed to confirm identity of bacterial target
analytes. Overall, these BDS systems were used in the EP test Method Comparison study
in various capacities: (i) for species-level identification of clinical positives, if applicable,
(ii) typing of virulence markers (Stx1, Stx2), and (iii) discordant troubleshooting between
the EP test and the reference method identification. An overview of comparator methods
performed for each analyte are listed in Table 22.

The clinical study protocol specified running QC samples each day of testing, utilizing one
external negative control and one of eleven external positive controls (tested on a rotating
basis) representing all target analytes. Summary data for quality control test runs are
provided in Table 33. Since the Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test is a single-use
device, QC failures do not occur on the same test run during which a clinical specimen result
is generated. Therefore, an initial QC failure would not lead to the exclusion of a clinical
specimen result, provided a valid QC result was obtained upon repeat testing during the same
day as the initial QC failure.

6. Expected values:
In the Verigene Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test Method Comparison study,
1277 prospectively collected fresh and frozen specimens were obtained from seven
medium to large-sized healthcare institutions geographically distributed across the
United States. The number and percentage of positive cases (positivity rate)
determined by the Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test stratified by geographic
region for each of the organisms detected are presented in Table 36. Overall, the
Enteric Pathogens Nucleic Acid Test detected at least one target in 7.7% of
prospectively-collected specimens. In routine practice, prevalence rates may vary
depending on the institution, geographical location, and patient population.

N. Instrument Names:
Verigene System
O. System Descriptions:
1. Modes of Operation:
The Verigene System has one mode of operation available to the User. Prior to
initiating a test run the User places the sample into the sample loading well, loads the
consumable, and enters identifying information into the system. After the Processor
SP run has completed, the test cartridge is removed from the instrument and the
reagent pack is manually separated from the Substrate Holder. The barcode on the
substrate holder is scanned prior insertion into the Reader. The Reader images the
Substrate and automatically determines the test result without further user
intervention.
1. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes
for this line of product types:

2. Specimen Identification:
All tests must be ordered through the Verigene Reader. No tests can be processed on
the Verigene Processor SP without the user entering the Test Cartridge ID and
Sample ID to the Verigene Reader.
The User enters the Test Cartridge ID by scanning the barcode using the barcode
scanner attached to the Reader. The user may manually enter in the Test Cartridge ID
by selecting MENU and ‘Enter Barcode’ and then keying in the Test Cartridge ID
number with the Reader’s keyboard. The User has the option to scan the Test
Cartridge Cover’s 2D barcode using a barcode gun-style scanner to display the Test
Cartridge’s Reference Number, Expiration Date, and Lot Number on reports. The
User enters the Sample ID by scanning or manually enter the Sample ID using the
Reader’s touch-screen keyboard then confirming the Sample ID in the software.
3. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
Inadequate or inappropriate specimen collection, storage, or transport may yield false-
negative results. Due to the importance of specimen quality, training of personnel in
the correct manner to perform specimen collection and handling is highly
recommended.
Collect stool preserved in Cary-Blair media by using the media manufacturer’s
recommended collection procedure or collect unpreserved and unformed (liquid or
soft) stool specimens and place as soon as possible into the Cary-Blair media by using
the following collection procedure.
1. Put on fresh gloves.
2. For each Cary-Blair preserved specimen to be tested, place one sterile flocked
swab and one uncapped Stool Prep Buffer tube (place the cap to the side for
recapping later) into a biological safety cabinet (BSC).
3. Wipe down the outside of the specimen vial with a lint-free decontaminating
wipe.
4. Invert the vial containing the Cary-Blair preserved specimen twice and vortex
the specimen for 5-10 seconds to ensure homogeneity.
5. To prepare the Stool Prep Buffer tube, dip the provided flocked swab into
either the primary Cary-Blair preserved specimen vial or the secondary tube
until the flocked tip is fully immersed in specimen. Once evenly coated,
transfer the swab to the Stool Prep Buffer tube and break swab at the pre-
formed scored breakpoint. Leave the swab in the Stool Prep Buffer tube and
screw the cap finger tight on to Stool Prep Buffer tube.
6. Recap the original, primary Cary-Blair preserved specimen container and set
aside.
7. Repeat steps 1-6 for each specimen, changing gloves between each specimen.
8. Vortex each Stool Prep Buffer tube for 15-20 seconds.

9. Spin all prepared Stool Prep Buffer tubes in the Mini Centrifuge for 30-35
seconds at a MAXIMUM of 2200 rcf.
10. Pipette 200 µL of the prepared supernatant into the Extraction Tray.
It is recommended that Cary-Blair preserved specimens be stored refrigerated at 2-
8°C until testing is completed (for up to 48 hours after collection). For repeat testing,
prepare the stored specimen in a new Stool Prep Buffer as described in the Specimen
Processing section (see Section B) of the product labeling.
4. Calibration:
There is no user calibration.
5. Quality Control:
See Section 2 for a description of the Quality Control material included with the test.
P. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
Q. Conclusion:
