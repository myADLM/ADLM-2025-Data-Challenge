benzodiazepine class) in human urine at a cutoff concentration of 2000 ng/mL and
300ng/mL, respectively.
The tests may yield preliminary positive results even when prescription drugs including
Morphine and Oxazepam are ingested at prescribed doses; it is not intended to
distinguish between prescription use or abuse of these drugs. There are no uniformly
recognized cutoff concentration levels Morphine or Oxazepam in urine. The test
provides only preliminary test results. A more specific alternative chemical method
must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. GC/MS is the preferred
confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be
exercised with any drug of abuse test result, particularly when the preliminary result is
positive.
For in vitro diagnostic use only. It is intended for over-the-counter and for prescription
use.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For Over the Counter and Prescription Use
For in vitro diagnostic use only
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable. Device is visually read, single use device.
I. Device Description:
Each pouch contains a test cup and test card test card.
The OTC device also includes labeled vials for shipping the “preliminary” sample to the
laboratory for confirmation, plastic transportation bags, mailing boxes, and personal
identification numbers
Each test strip in the device consists of a conjugate pad containing colloidal gold coupled
with the anti-drug antibodies and a nitrocellulose membrane containing two test lines
coated with the conjugated drug antigen, and a procedural control line.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):

L. Test Principle:
The device is a rapid test for the qualitative detection of Morphine and Oxazepam in urine
samples. It is a lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay. When the absorbent end is
immersed into a urine sample, the urine is absorbed into the device by capillary action and
mixes with the antibody-dye conjugate, flowing across the pre-coated membrane. At
analyte concentrations below the target cutoff, antibody-dye conjugates bind to the drug-
protein conjugate immobilized in the Test Region (T) of the device. This produces a
colored test line that indicates a negative result. When the analyte concentration is above
the cutoff, analyte molecules bind to the antibody-dye conjugate, preventing the antibody-
dye conjugate from binding to the drug-protein conjugate immobilized in the Test Region
(T) of the device. When the sample contains target drug above the cutoff concentration no
colored band shows in the test region, indicating a preliminary positive result.

Precision studies were carried out for urine samples with concentrations of -
100%cutoff, -75%cutoff, -50%cutoff, -25%cutoff, +25%cutoff, +50%cutoff ,
+75%cutoff and +100%cutoff. For each concentration, tests using masked and
randomized samples were performed by three operators twice per day for 25 days
with three different lots of devices. The results obtained are summarized in the
following tables.

Accelerated stability and real time stability tests were performed on three lots of dip
cards and cups for morphine and oxazepam urine test devices using samples at -
50% cutoff and +50% cutoff, and negative urine. The stability study results support
the claimed shelf life of 18 months at 4 to 30 ºC. The transport simulation study
results support stability for 3 weeks when exposed to temperatures of ranging from
-20 ºC and 40 ºC.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable. The assay is intended for qualitative use.
e. Analytical specificity:
Analytical specificity studies were performed to determine whether drugs and
drug metabolites within the same class of drugs or with similar molecular
structures cross- react in the test system.
The target drug, drug metabolites, and other related compounds were added to
drug-free urine. The cross reacting substances and the lowest concentration that
produces a positive result was identified. A list of these compounds and their
level of cross reactivity is provided in the tables below:

Specific Gravity:
Twelve urine samples with density ranges (1.000-1.035) were collected and spiked
with each drug at 25% below and 25% above cutoff levels. Each sample was tested
using three lots of CR3 Keyless Split Sample Cup Morphine-Oxazepam. The results
showed that specific gravity range of 1.000 to 1.035 does not affect the accuracy of
the test.
pH:
A negative urine pool was adjusted to a pH range of 4.00 to 9.00 in 1 pH unit
increments and was spiked with each drug at 25% below and 25% above cutoff
levels. Samples were tested using three lots of CR3 Keyless Split Sample Cup
Morphine-Oxazepam and results showed that urine pH range of 4.00 to 9.00 does
not affect the accuracy of the accuracy of the test.
f. Assay cut-off:
Characterization of how the device performs around the claimed cutoff
concentration is shown in the precision section M.1.a. above as well as the Lay
User Study below.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The method comparison for the CR3 Keyless Split Sample Cup Morphine-
Oxazepam was performed at the manufacturer’s site.. Operators ran 80 unaltered
masked and randomized clinical samples. The samples were compared to GC/MS
results. Four “viewers” separately read results (3 experienced viewers, 1 OTC
viewer). Viewers A, B, and C in the table below were experienced professionals.
Viewer D was a lay person. The results are presented in the table below:

A lay user study was performed at three sites with 260 lay persons. In the study, 79
males and 47 females tested the Morphine samples and 74 males and 60 females
tested the Oxazepam samples. The participants had diverse educational and
professional backgrounds and ranged in age from 21 to >50. Urine samples were
prepared at the following concentrations; -100%, +/-75%, +/-50%, +/-25% of the
cutoff by spiking drug(s) into drug free-pooled urine specimens. The concentrations
of the samples were confirmed by GC/MS. Each sample was aliquoted into
