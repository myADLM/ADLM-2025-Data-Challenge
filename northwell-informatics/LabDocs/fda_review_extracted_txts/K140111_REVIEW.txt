H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use:
The BD MAX™ Enteric Bacterial Panel performed on the BD MAX™ System is an
automated in vitro diagnostic test for the direct qualitative detection and differentiation of
enteric bacterial pathogens. The BD MAX Enteric Bacterial Panel detects nucleic acids from:
• Salmonella spp.
• Campylobacter spp. (jejuni and coli)
• Shigella spp. / Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC)
• Shiga toxin 1 (stx1) / Shiga toxin 2 (stx2) genes (found in Shiga toxin-producing E.
coli [STEC]) as well as Shigella dysenteriae, which can possess a Shiga toxin gene
(stx) that is identical to the stx1 gene of STEC.
Testing is performed on unpreserved soft to diarrheal stool specimens or Cary-Blair
preserved stool specimens from symptomatic patients with suspected acute gastroenteritis,
enteritis or colitis. The test is performed directly on the specimen, utilizing real-time
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the amplification of SpaO, a Campylobacter specific tuf
gene sequence, ipaH and stx1/stx2. The test utilizes fluorogenic sequence-specific
hybridization probes for detection of the amplified DNA.
This test is intended for use, in conjunction with clinical presentation, laboratory findings,
and epidemiological information, as an aid in the differential diagnosis of Salmonella,
Shigella/EIEC, Campylobacter and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) infections. Results
of this test should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient
management decisions. Positive results do not rule out co-infection with other organisms that
are not detected by this test, and may not be the sole or definitive cause of patient illness.
Negative results in the setting of clinical illness compatible with gastroenteritis may be due to
infection by pathogens that are not detected by this test or non-infectious causes such as
ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, or Crohn’s disease.
2. Indication(s) for use:

The assay is run on the BD MAXTM System.
I. Device Description:
The BD MAX System and the BD MAX Enteric Bacterial Panel are comprised of an instrument
with associated hardware and accessories, disposable microfluidic cartridges, real-time PCR
master mixes, unitized reagent strips, extraction reagents, and sample buffer tubes (SBT). The
instrument automates sample preparation including target lysis, DNA extraction and
concentration, reagent rehydration, and target nucleic acid amplification and detection using real-
time PCR. The assay includes a Sample Processing Control (SPC) that is present in the
Extraction Tube. The SPC monitors DNA extraction steps, thermal cycling steps, reagent
integrity and the presence of inhibitory substances. The BD MAX System software
automatically interprets test results.
Brief Explanation of the Procedure
A soft to diarrheal stool is collected and transported to the laboratory. After the stool has been
homogenized, a disposable inoculating loop is used to collect a 10 μL aliquot of the stool
material and the contents of the loop are dispensed into a SBT. The SBT is closed with a septum
cap and vortexed. A worklist is created and the SBT, the BD MAX Enteric Bacterial Panel
Unitized Reagent Strip (URS) and the BD MAX PCR cartridge are loaded onto the BD MAX
System. The BD MAX System automates sample preparation including cell lysis, DNA
extraction and concentration, reagent rehydration, and target nucleic acid amplification and
detection using real-time PCR. Amplified targets are detected with hydrolysis probes labeled
with quenched fluorophores. The amplification, detection and interpretation of the signals are
done automatically by the BD MAX System.

L. Test Principle:
The BD MAX Enteric Bacterial Panel detects target DNA from unpreserved soft to diarrheal
stool specimens or Cary-Blair preserved stool specimens from symptomatic patients with
suspected acute gastroenteritis, enteritis or colitis.
A stool specimen is collected and transported to the laboratory in a dry, clean container (for
unpreserved specimens) or in Cary-Blair transport media. The specimen is vortexed for 15
seconds and then a 10 µL loop is used to inoculate a SBT. The SBT is closed with a septum cap
and vortexed. A worklist is created and the SBT, the BD MAX Enteric Bacterial Panel unitized
reagent strip (URS) and the BD MAX PCR Cartridge are loaded onto the BD MAX System.
Following enzymatic cell lysis, the released nucleic acids are captured on magnetic beads. The
beads, with the bound nucleic acids, are washed using Wash Buffer and the nucleic acids are
eluted by heat in Elution Buffer. Eluted DNA is neutralized using Neutralization Buffer and
transferred to a Master Mix to rehydrate PCR reagents. After reconstitution, the BD MAX
System dispenses a fixed volume of PCR-ready solution containing extracted nucleic acids
into the BD MAX PCR Cartridge. Microvalves in the BD MAX PCR Cartridge are sealed prior
to initiating PCR to contain the amplification mixture, thus preventing evaporation and
contamination.
The amplified DNA targets are detected using hydrolysis (TaqMan®) probes, labeled at one end
with a fluorescent reporter dye (fluorophore) and at the other end with a quencher moiety. Probes
labeled with different fluorophores are used to detect amplicons for the following enteric
bacterial targets:

• Campylobacter spp.: The assay detects the Campylobacter-specific tuf gene sequence of
Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli; however the assay does not distinguish
which species is present. Species other than C. jejuni and C. coli are not detected by the
assay.
• Salmonella spp.: The assay detects the SpaO gene of Salmonella spp.; however the assay
does distinguish which Salmonella species is present. All species of Salmonella should be
detected by the assay.
• Shigella spp.: The assay detects the ipaH gene of Shigella spp. or Enteroinvasive E. coli
(EIEC). The assay will give a positive result for Shigella spp./EIEC when S. boydii, S.
flexneri, S. sonnei, S. dysenteriae or EIEC are present in a specimen; however the assay
report does not indicate if the detected organism is Shigella spp. or EIEC. In addition the
assay does not distinguish which Shigella species is present.
• Stx1 and stx2 genes: The assay detects stx1 and stx2 gene sequences that are present in
STEC and S. dysenteriae; however the assay does not distinguish which stx gene is
present.
The four described targets as well as the SPC are detected in five different optical channels of the
BD MAX System. When the probes are in their native state, the fluorescence of the fluorophore
is quenched due to its proximity to the quencher. However, in the presence of target DNA, the
probes hybridize to their complementary sequences and are hydrolyzed by the 5’-3’ exonuclease
activity of the DNA polymerase as it synthesizes the nascent strand along the DNA template. As
a result, the fluorophores are separated from the quencher molecules and fluorescence is emitted.
The amount of fluorescence detected in the optical channels used for the BD MAX Enteric
Bacterial Panel is directly proportional to the quantity of the corresponding probe that is
hydrolyzed. The BD MAX System measures these signals at the end of each amplification cycle,
and interprets the data to provide a result.
M. Performance Characteristics:
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Site-to-site Reproducibility
Site-to-Site reproducibility was evaluated for the BD MAX Enteric Bacterial Panel in a
study that included three external clinical testing sites using a single lot of reagents. Ten
panels, each consisting of 12 samples were evaluated over five days with two panels tested
per day, each by one of two technologists resulting in a total of 90 data points per panel
member (3 replicates/run x 2 runs/day by two different technologists/site x 5 days x 3 sites).
Positive panel members were prepared as organism mixes with cultures of Salmonella
typhimurium (ATCC 14028), Shigella sonnei (ATCC 9290), Campylobacter coli (ATCC
43134) and Escherichia coli (stx1) (ATCC 43890). Each positive panel member contained
targeted organisms at varying concentrations: moderate positive (MP) ~3x LoD (Limit of
Detection), low positive (LP) at ~1.5x LoD, and high negative (HN) at C LoD. True
20-80
negative (TN) panel members contained sample buffer only.

MP: Moderate positive, ≥2 and ≤5 X LoD
HN: High negative, appropriate dilution of the organism to produce a negative result 20% to 80% of the time
TN: Sample Buffer only
Three replicates of each positive mix and true negative sample were included in each run.
Panel members were prepared by spiking SBTs with organism mixes. Testing panels were
shipped to testing sites and prior to testing, the user expressed a 10µl loop of pooled stool
matrix (previously determined to be negative for all analytes by the BD MAX Enteric
Bacterial Panel) into each sample.
The overall Site-to-Site Reproducibility percent agreement with expected results (i.e.,
negative for TN and HN, positive for MP and LP) was 100% for the TN category for all
targets, and ranged from 41.1% to 77.8%, 96.7% to 100% and 98.9% to 100% for the HN,
LP and MP categories, respectively. The reproducibility study results met the pre-defined
acceptance criteria for LP, MP, HN and TN samples of overall expected results:
approximately 95% detection for LP samples, approximately 100% detection for MP
samples, between 20-80% detection for HN samples and 100% negative results for TN
samples.

Lot-to-lot Reproducibility:
For evaluation of lot-to lot reproducibility, two users each completed a single run of 12 panel
members on a single instrument for each of two lots of reagents over a 5-day period for a
total of 10 runs. The same panels used for the site-to-site reproducibility study were tested in
this study. The overall Lot-to-Lot reproducibility percent agreement was 100% for the TN
category for all targets, and ranged from 13.33% to 62.22%, 95.56% to 100% and 97.78% to
100% for the HN, LP and MP categories, respectively as shown in the following table.

Positive and Negative External Controls
External Positive Controls are intended to monitor for substantial reagent failure and
External Negative Controls are used to detect reagent or environmental contamination (or
carry-over) from positive specimens or nucleic acids (amplicon). External controls are
not provided with the BD MAX Enteric Bacterial Panel; however recommendations for
control preparation and testing are provide in the package insert.
During the clinical study, external positive and negative controls were included in each
run and in the case of a failure of either or both external controls, testing of all
samples included in the run was repeated from the stored SBTs. Negative external
controls consisted of saline. Positive controls were prepared as organism suspensions
using cultures of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium (ATCC
14028), Shigella sonnei (ATCC 9290), Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni (ATCC
33291), and Escherichia coli (stx1) (ATCC 43890). Each positive control was tested on a
rotating basis.
During the clinical study, a total of 476 external positive controls and 476 external
negative controls were tested resulting in valid expected results for 456 (95.8%) and 450
(94.5%) for positive and negative controls respectively. Testing of positive controls
yielded three (0.6%) valid but incorrect results, four (0.8%) Unresolved results, five
(1.1%) Incomplete results, and eight (1.7%) Indeterminate results. Testing of negative
controls yielded three (0.6%) false negative results, ten (2.1%) Unresolved results, seven
(1.5%) Incomplete results, and six (1.3%) Indeterminate results.

Internal Specimen Processing Control:
Each BD MAX Enteric Bacterial Extraction Tube contains a Sample Processing Control
(SPC) which is a plasmid containing a synthetic target DNA sequence. The SPC monitors
the efficiency of DNA capture, washing and elution during the sample processing steps,
as well as the efficiency of DNA amplification and detection during PCR analysis. If the
SPC result fails to meet the acceptance criteria, the test result of will be reported as
Unresolved (UNR). An Unresolved result is indicative of sample-associated inhibition or
reagent failure. The user is instructed to repeat any sample reported as Unresolved.
Sample Processing Control Effectiveness Study
A Sample Processing control effectiveness study was performed to evaluate the
effectiveness of the SPC to monitor for substantial reagent or process failure. This study
was designed to test for failure in the extraction process, failure in PCR amplification
and/or failure due to the presence of PCR inhibitors.
For the SPC effectiveness study, the following conditions were tested:
• Failure in PCR amplification was tested by replacing the BD MAX Enteric
Bacterial Panel Master Mix tube with an empty Snap Tube (expected result =
Indeterminate (IND)).
• Failure in the Extraction process was tested by replacing the BD MAX Enteric
Bacterial Panel Extraction tube with an empty Snap Tube (expected result =
UNR).
• Failure due to the presence of PCR inhibitors was tested by placing 100 mM
EDTA solution into an empty Snap Tube of the BD MAX System test rack prior
to beginning a run (expected result = UNR).
A minimum of 24 replicates were tested for each test condition for which the assay
performed as expected, producing the expected failures as shown in the following table.

Specimen Stability Study: (Preservation of DNA in stool or Cary-Blair Media)
Stability studies were performed to demonstrate that target DNA is stable in unpreserved
stool and stool in Cary-Blair media prior to testing with the BD MAX Enteric Bacterial
Panel. The claimed storage conditions are storage at 25°C for 24 hours and at 2-8°C for
up to five days.

Study #1: Specimen stability testing included testing of clinical specimens previously
determined positive for Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Campylobacter spp, or E. coli
(stx1). Specimens were mixed together to obtain baseline Ct values near the LoD for each
targeted analyte (i.e., Ct values between 29 and 32). Testing included 24 replicates for
each specimen at baseline, day 1 and day 2 for storage at 25°C, and day 2 and day 5 for
storage at 2-8°C. Acceptance criteria for each analyte included positive results for >95%
of replicates tested with no more than a mean increase of 2 Cts as compared to baseline
testing.
For unpreserved specimens, initial testing yielded acceptable results for all four targeted
analytes for specimens stored at 2-8°C up to five days. For unpreserved specimens stored
at 25°C, the study yielded acceptable results for Salmonella spp, Shigella spp, and E. coli
(stx1) positive specimens; however study results did not pass acceptance criteria for
detection of Campylobacter spp. At Day 1 of storage at 25C, 87% of replicates for
Campylobacter spp. were positive with an increase in mean Ct values of 2.82. At Day 2
of storage at 25°C, 100% of replicates for Campylobacter spp. were positive with an
increase in mean Ct values of 2.41.
For Cary-Blair preserved specimens, initial testing yielded acceptable results for all
analytes when specimens were stored at 2-8°C. For Cary-Blair specimens stored at 25°C,
E. coli (stx1) did not pass acceptance criteria for samples stored at day 1 or day 2 and
Shigella spp. did not pass acceptance criteria for samples stored at 25°C at day 2. No
additional testing was performed for Cary-Blair specimens positive with Shigella spp.
because the final stability claim for Cary-Blair specimens stored at 25°C is 24 hours.
Study #2: It was determined that mixing of analytes and stool matrices may be the reason
that initial study results did not meet the acceptance criteria for 25°C storage for positive
unpreserved stool specimens containing Campylobacter spp. and positive Cary-Blair
specimens containing E. coli (stx1). Additional testing for these two analytes was
performed on individual positive specimens and the following results were obtained:
• Unpreserved Specimens: Campylobacter spp. - 100% of replicates positive with
difference in mean Ct of <2 Ct.
• Cary-Blair Specimens: E. coli (stx1) - 100% of replicates positive with difference in
mean Ct of <2 Ct.
In summary, the specimen stability studies support that targeted DNA is stable in both
Unpreserved and Cary-Blair preserved stool specimens when stored for up to one day at
25°C or five days or at 2-8°C prior to testing with the BD MAX Enteric Bacterial Panel.
Stability of specimen in SBT (Sample Buffer Tube)
An analytical study was performed to evaluate the stability of target DNA in SBTs for
both unpreserved and Cary-Blair specimens. Organism mixes were prepared with
Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella and E. coli (stx1/stx2)) cultures spiked into SBTs
14

--- Page 15 ---
with each organism near the assay LoD (approximately 1.5 x LoD). SBTs were also
inoculated with individual negative unpreserved or Cary-Blair stool specimens (negative
matrix). Testing included 24 replicates for each specimen type (unpreserved and Cary-
Blair) at baseline , after storage at 24 and 48 hours at 25± 2C°, and after storage at 48 and
120 hours at 5 ± 3 °C.
Acceptance criteria included a minimum of 20 valid replicate results with >95% of
replicates positive with a mean Ct increase of less than 2 as compared to baseline testing
results for each storage condition evaluated.
For Cary-Blair specimens, SBT stability for all targets met the acceptance criteria for all
targets at all storage conditions evaluated. For Unpreserved stood specimens, two of the
four specimen mixes failed to meet baseline acceptance criteria (i.e., there was less than
95% detection at baseline) and therefore two new sets of specimen mixes were prepared.
Testing of the final four specimen mixes yielded acceptable baseline results and passed
the acceptance criteria for all targets and storage conditions tested (5 ± 3 °C and 25 ± 2
°C).
In summary, this analytical study supports the storage claims for Unpreserved and Cary-
Blair stools in SBT (25 ± 2 °C for up to 48 hours and 2-8°C for up to 5 days).
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Detection (LoD) for each targeted organism was determined in an analytical
study. Samples were prepared in two individual organism mixes containing
representative strains of organisms detected by the BD MAX Enteric Bacterial Panel.
Target Mix 1 consisted of Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 14028), E. coli O157 (stx1 &
stx2) (ENF 10513), Campylobacter coli (ATCC 43134) and Shigella sonnei (ATCC
10523). Target mix 2 consisted of Salmonella enteritidis (ATCC 13076), E. coli O157
(stx2) (ATCC 43889), Campylobacter jejuni (ATCC 43429) and Shigella flexneri (ATCC
700930). An additional E.coli strain containing stx1 (ATCC 43890) was also tested
individually. Samples were prepared in unpreserved stool matrix as well as in stool/Cary-
Blair matrix. Prior to sample preparation, pooled matrices were determined to be negative
for all analytes by the BD MAX Bacterial Enteric Bacterial Panel. Multiple dilutions of
each strain were tested with the BD MAX Enteric Bacterial Panel with up to 36 replicates
tested per dilution. Testing was performed using three reagent lots and three BD MAX
Systems.
A minimum of 30 valid results per dilution were used to determine the LoD for each
organism strain using a statistically-based methodology which allows for the
determination of LoD with a 95% confidence interval. Each LoD was calculated using a
linear logistic model that assesses the relationship between the probability of the response
and the bacterial concentration. The LoD, defined as the lowest concentration at which
greater than 95% of all replicates tested positive, ranged from 10 to 653 CFU/mL (in
SBT) and 1,500 to 97,950 CFU/mL (in stool) for preserved Cary-Blair specimens and
15

--- Page 16 ---
42 to 910 CFU/mL (in SBT) and 6,300 to 136,500 CFU/ mL (in stool) for unpreserved
specimens.

e. Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity):
Inclusivity was assessed through testing of a wide range of clinically relevant GI
pathogen strains, genotypes, serotypes and clinical isolates. Samples were prepared
using 121 well-characterized clinical strains and strains from public collections.
Inclusivity testing included 30 strains of Campylobacter spp. (C. jejuni and C. coli),
30 strains of Salmonella spp. (S. enterica and S. bongori), 31 strains of Shigella
spp./Enteroinvasive E. coli and 35 organism strains positive for Shiga-toxin Types 1
and/or 2 (including 30 E. coli strains of which 20 were non-O157, and 5 S.
dysenteriae strains). Testing consisted of 35 organism mixes containing three or four
targeted organisms in each organism mix with individual organism concentrations at
1x LoD for each organism. Shigella dysenteriae and Shiga-toxin producing E. coli
were tested individually because they both carry Shiga-toxin genes. All samples were
prepared in SBTs using unpreserved stool matrix. Testing included 20-24 replicates
for each organism mix or strain (8 replicates each with three different reagent lots).
Acceptance criteria for a strain to be considered inclusive required an 85% positivity
rate at 1x LoD with a minimum of 20 valid replicates. Additional testing was
performed at higher organism concentrations for targets that did not meet the
acceptance criteria.
The BD MAX Enteric Bacterial Panel correctly identified 120 of the 121 strains
tested at the LOD. One strain of Shigella sonnei (ENF 15987) demonstrated 79.17%
positivity at a concentration of 56.1 CFU/mL of SBT. The isolate was further
evaluated and yielded 100% positivity at a higher concentration of 405 CFU/mL of
SBT. Seven other strains of Shigella sonnei were evaluated during the analytical
inclusivity study and met the study acceptance criteria at a concentration of 56.1
CFU/mL.
In summary, the BD MAX Enteric Bacterial Panel demonstrated acceptable
performance for detection of a wide variety of targeted strains. The tables below
include a listing of the 121 strains, serovars, and subspecies that were included in the
study.

Additional in silico analysis was performed to determine the expected detection of
stx2 subtypes a-g. The analysis supports the predicted detection of all stx2 subtypes
with the exception of subtype ‘f’ for which the targeted sequence contains several
mismatches with BD MAX Enteric Bacterial Panel primers. A limitation is included
in package insert regarding this subtype.

f. Analytical specificity:
A study was performed with samples containing high concentrations of non-target
organisms to evaluate the analytical specificity of the BD MAX Enteric Bacterial
Panel. The study included organisms phylogenetically related to targeted organisms
as well as other bacteria, yeast, parasites and viruses that may be found in stool
specimens. Samples were prepared using quantified organism preparations and
pooled negative unpreserved stool matrix.
The study included 106 bacterial strains, three parasites, two Candida spp., and 15
viruses. Included were nine Campylobacter spp. strains (non jejuni or coli) as well as
six non Shiga-toxin producing E. coli strains. Each organism was initially tested in
triplicate and if a positive result was obtained, an additional 20 replicates were tested
to confirm cross-reactivity. The following non-targeted organisms were evaluated for
potential cross-reactivity with the BD MAX Enteric Bacterial Panel:
• Nine Campylobacter strains (Campylobacter species other than C. jejuni or C.
coli), tested at a concentration ≥ 1 x 106 CFU/mL of SBT.
• Six E. coli strains other than Shiga toxin-producing strains, tested at a
concentration ≥ 1 x 106 CFU/mL of SBT.
• Ninety-nine other bacterial strains (including 53 species and subspecies), tested
at a concentration ≥ 1 x 106 CFU/mL of SBT (or ~ 1 x 108 genomic DNA
copies/mL or 1 x 108 elementary bodies/mL of SBT).
• Fifteen different viruses tested at a concentration ≥ 1 x 104 PFU/mL of SBT.
• Three different parasites tested at a concentration ≥ 1 x 105 cysts/mL of SBT.

additional false positive results. Therefore these organisms were deemed to be non-cross-
reactive with the assay.
The following organisms which are expected to be detected by the assay were evaluated
to ensure the expected positive and negative results occur in the appropriate optical
channels on the BD MAX system:
• Three Campylobacter spp.; one C. coli, one C. jejuni, subsp. doylei and one C. jejuni,
subsp. jejuni at a concentration ≥ 1 x 106 CFU/mL of SBT.
• Four E. coli; two O157 and two non-O157 strains containing stx1/stx2 genes tested at
a concentration ≥ 1 x 106 CFU/mL of SBT.
• Five Salmonella strains tested at a concentration ≥ 1 x 106 CFU/mL of SBT.
• Three Shigella spp.; one each of S. sonnei, S. boydii, S. flexneri, and S. dysentariae
tested at a concentration ≥ 1 x 106 CFU/mL of SBT.
Testing of these targeted organisms produced the expected positive and negative results
with the exception of one strain of Shigella boydii (ATCC 12028) which unexpectedly
gave a positive result for stx1/stx2 in one of three replicates. Additional testing of this
strain produced positive results with 8 out of 20 replicates for the presence of stx1/stx2.
Four additional strains of Shigella boydii tested in Inclusivity studies did not give positive
results for stx1/stx2.
In conclusion, all organisms tested by the BD MAX Enteric Bacterial panel in this
Analytical Specificity study are not considered cross-reactants with the exception of
Shigella boydii (ATCC 12028).
g. Matrix equivalence Study
N/A
h. Interference Study
A study was performed to evaluate potential interference of biological and chemical
substances that may be present in stool specimens in samples tested with the BD MAX
Enteric Bacterial Panel. Of these substances, a pool of eight different antibiotics was
tested with each antibiotic at a concentration that might be excreted in stool. Testing
included exogenous substances at 50% concentrations (1:1 substance/stool ratio) and
endogenous substances at varying concentrations. Samples were prepared in
unpreserved stool as a worst case representative specimen matrix due to the presence of
higher concentrations of endogenous interfering substances in unpreserved stool as
compared to Cary-Blair preserved stool.
Samples were prepared by inoculating SBTs with each potentially interfering substance,
unpreserved stool matrix, as well as organism suspensions at approximate
concentrations of 1.5 X LoD for each targeted organism. The strains used included
Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 14028), Campylobacter coli (ATCC 43134), Shigella
23

sonnei (ATCC 10523) and E. coli O157:H7 (stx1) (BD ENF 10513). Testing included 24
positive and 12 negative samples for each potential interfering substance. If any
interference was seen, additional testing was performed with lower concentrations of the
interfering substance.
Testing demonstrated no interference for all substances tested with the exception of
Nystatin cream, spermicidal lubricant, and Vagisil. Initial testing showed assay
interference for samples containing Nystatin cream and spermicidal lubricant at 50%
concentrations (1:1 substance/stool ratio); however it was determined that these
substances were tested at concentrations that could not form a uniform homogenous
mixture. Repeat testing was performed using lower concentrations of each substance and
study results yielded no interference for Nystatin cream or spermicidal lubricant at
concentrations of 31% and 34% respectively. Interference was seen for samples prepared
with Vagisil at concentrations greater than 9.2% and this substance is described in the
package insert as a potential interferent for the assay. The following table lists all
substances and concentrations evaluated in the interference study.

i. Fresh versus Frozen Study:
A fresh versus frozen study was performed to support inclusion of frozen archived
specimens in the clinical study. The study was designed to assess the effect on assay
performance after one freeze/thaw cycle. Sixty individual preserved (Cary-Blair) and 60
unpreserved negative stool specimens were used to prepare samples. Culture isolates of
Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella sonnei, E. coli (stx1) and Campylobacter coli were
prepared as a target mix and spiked into two aliquots from each negative stool specimen.

One aliquot of each sample was tested on the day of preparation and one aliquot was
stored for a minimum of 18 hours at -70°C. Study results demonstrated greater than 95%
positive results for both fresh and frozen samples for both unpreserved and Cary-Blair
preserved specimens.

In summary, results of the fresh versus frozen study demonstrate that one freeze/thaw cycle
should not significantly affect the performance of the BD MAX Enteric Bacterial Panel as
compared to testing of fresh specimens.
j. Carryover / Cross-Contamination
A study was conducted to investigate within-run carryover and between-run carryover
while processing specimens with high bacterial loads of Salmonella enterica (ATCC
13076), Shigella sonnei (ATCC 10523), Campylobacter jejuni (ATCC 29428) and Shiga-
toxin producing Escherichia coli (stx1 and stx2) (ENF 10513) in the BD MAX Enteric
Bacterial Panel. Positive samples were prepared in SBT with an unpreserved stool
matrix and an organism mix containing with all four targeted organisms, each present
at ~1 x 106 CFU/mL. The negative member did not contain any target analyte. Negative
samples were prepared in SBT with negative unpreserved stool matrix. Testing
included 16 runs containing alternating positive and negative samples tested on three
BD MAX instruments.
Study results included 167 valid replicates for all negative samples tested of which one
sample yielded false positive results for all four targets. The overall contamination
carry-over/cross-contamination rate for each targeted organism was 0.6% (1/167; 95%
CI, 0.11% - 3.31%).
k. Mixed Infection Study:
A mixed infection/competitive interference study was performed to evaluate the ability of
the BD MAX Enteric Bacterial Panel to detect low positive results in the presence of other
targets at high concentrations. Each of the targeted organisms was evaluated at low
concentrations (1.5X LoD) when present in samples containing mixes of other targeted
organisms at high concentrations (>1x106 CFU/mL). Samples were prepared with
unpreserved stool matrix. A total of 24 replicates were tested for each of the sample mixes
described in the table below.

Study results showed no evidence of competitive inhibition in samples with low
concentrations of each targeted organism when combined with high concentrations of
other targeted organisms.
l. Assay cut-off:
Assay cut-offs for the BD MAX Enteric Bacterial Panel were pre-determined in
analytical verification experiments and then subsequently validated using data from the
multi-site clinical study. The PCR metrics of EP (Endpoint Fluorescence), FDPH (First
Derivative Peak Height), and Ct Value (Cycle Threshold) from the clinical study were
graphically and statistically analyzed as compared to results from the reference method
for each targeted analyte. ROC curve analysis was performed separately for each PCR
metric demonstrating that use of the pre-determined cutoffs yielded optimal positive
percent agreement for all analytes as compared to the reference method. The analysis did
suggest however that a change in the Campylobacter spp. cutoff could improve the
negative percent agreement for the assay. Given the importance of detecting these
pathogens in stool specimens, it was deemed inappropriate to apply any change to the
decision algorithm for Campylobacter spp. and the cutoff was left unchanged. In
conclusion, results from the assay cutoff validation demonstrated that the initial cutoffs
determined prior to the clinical studies are acceptable.

3. Clinical Study:
Performance characteristics of the BD MAX Enteric Bacterial Panel were determined in a
multi-site investigational study. The study involved a total of eight geographically diverse
clinical centers where specimens were prospectively collected and tested as part of routine
patient care, and the excess de-identified specimens were then tested with the BD MAX
Enteric Bacterial Panel. Specimens were also collected at an additional four sites and shipped
for testing at a central location. Specimens were obtained from pediatric and adult patients
suspected of acute bacterial gastroenteritis, enteritis or colitis, for which stool culture had
been ordered by a healthcare provider. Unpreserved or Cary-Blair preserved specimens were
included. Stool specimens were required to have a soft or diarrheal consistency and only one
specimen was enrolled per patient. Additional testing was performed with preselected
retrospective (frozen) specimens known to be positive for analytes targeted by the BD MAX
Enteric Bacterial Panel.
Reference testing for prospective (fresh) specimens was standard direct stool culture
followed by biochemical tests to finalize identification of colonies suspected to be
Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter. The reference method for detection of Shiga toxin
1 and 2 included broth enrichment followed by enzyme immunoassay. For retrospective
(frozen) specimens, historical results were confirmed using an alternate PCR assay followed
by bi-directional sequencing in order to confirm the presence of target DNA.
A total of 3457 prospective specimens (2112 Cary-Blair preserved and 1345 unpreserved)
and 785 retrospective specimens (464 Cary-Blair preserved and 321 unpreserved) were
enrolled in the clinical evaluation. A total of 104 retrospective specimens for which the
historical results were not confirmed by an alternate PCR and bi-directional sequencing were
not included in performance calculations. The following table describes the number of
compliant specimens enrolled by patient age and specimen type.

Performance of the BD MAX Enteric Bacterial Panel by species/toxin type
Species/toxin type identification was obtained for each positive specimen either from the
culture and identification portion of the reference method testing, EIA result, or from
sequencing performed for the confirmation of retrospective specimen historical results.
While the BD MAX Enteric Bacterial Panel is designed to detect the species and toxin types
described below, the panel does not report results to the species or toxin level. The following
tables describe the assay performance stratified by species and Shiga-toxin type.
