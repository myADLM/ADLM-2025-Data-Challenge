M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Not applicable
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not applicable
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability:
There is no international standard available for CA 125. The Elecsys CA 125 II assay
has been standardized against the Boehringer Mannheim Enzymun Test CA 125 II
method. This in turn was standardized against the CA 125 II RIA from Fujirebio
Diagnostics.
Value Assignment:
For each Elecsys CA 125 II CalSet II manufactured, the calibrators are run in
duplicate on at least three (3) cobas e 411 analyzers and at least three (3) Modular
Analytics E170 analyzers with all the CA 125 II assay reagent lots available at that
time using the master calibrators as the reference values. The assigned value of each
calibrator is defined as the median value obtained over at least six (6) runs on at least
three (3) analyzers of the respective calibrator.
The target value and target range for CA 125 II CalSet II is shown in the following
table:
Level Target Value Target Range
(U/mL) (U/mL)
Calibrator 1 0 <1500 counts
Calibrator 2 500 450-550
Stability:
Stability studies were performed on cobas e 411 in order to verify the stability claims
for the Elecsys CA 125 II CalSet II. For each study, both the test and reference
materials were tested in duplicate and the acceptance criteria that the value for test
material is within 93 – 107% of the reference value.

after reconstitution was evaluated. The test materials were reconstituted and kept in
closed vials at storage condition: 2 – 8°C for 15 weeks, and -15 to -25°C for 21 weeks
(with or without freeze/thaw cycles). A freshly reconstituted CalSet was used as the
reference material for the study. The results support the following stability claim for
the reconstituted CA 125 II CalSet: 12 weeks at 2 – 8°C, 20 weeks at -15 to -25°C
with one freeze/thaw cycle.
Open vial/On-board stability: The test material was reconstituted and tested when
stored at 20 – 25°C for six hours in open vial. A freshly reconstituted set of CalSet II
was used as reference. The results support the claimed stability: CA 125 II CalSet II
is stable up to five hours at 20-25°C.
According to the sponsor, the reconstituted calibrators should only be left on the
Elecsys 2012 and cobas e 411 analyzers during calibration at 20-25°C. After use,
close the bottles as soon as possible and store upright at 2 – 8°C. For MODULAR
ANALYTICS, cobas e 601 and cobas e 602 analyzers, CA 125 II CalSet II should
only be used once.
Closed vial stability: The stability for the CA 125 II CalSet II was evaluated with
both the accelerated and an on-going real-time stability study. For the real time
stability study, three lots of test materials are stored at 2 – 8°C. Samples at time-
points 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 13, 19, 25, and 31 months are tested and the recovery value is
calculated by comparing to the value from the reference material (stored at -20°C).
For the accelerated stability study, the on-test material was stored at 35°C for three
weeks; the value of testing material was evaluated by comparing to the value of the
reference. The results generated from the on-going real-time stability studies support
a claim of 12 months when the CA 125 II CalSet II is stored at 2-8°C.
