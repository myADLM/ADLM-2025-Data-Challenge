SPECIAL 510(k): Device Modification
ODE Review Summary
To: THE FILE RE: DOCUMENT NUMBER K140150
This 510(k) submission contains information/data on modifications made to the SUBMITTER’S own
Class II, Class III or Class I devices requiring 510(k). The following items are present and acceptable
(delete/add items as necessary):
1. The name and 510(k) number of the SUBMITTER’S previously cleared device. GL GOODLIFE
SERIES BLOOD GLUCOSE MONITORING SYSTEM (k113307), which includes:
GoodLife AC-300 Blood Glucose Monitoring System
GoodLife AC-301 Blood Glucose Monitoring System
GoodLife AC-302 Blood Glucose Monitoring System
GoodLife AC-303 Blood Glucose Monitoring System
GoodLife AC-304 Blood Glucose Monitoring System
GoodLife AC-305 Blood Glucose Monitoring System
GoodLife AC-300 Professional Blood Glucose Monitoring System
GoodLife AC-301 Professional Blood Glucose Monitoring System
GoodLife AC-302 Professional Blood Glucose Monitoring System
GoodLife AC-303 Professional Blood Glucose Monitoring System
GoodLife AC-304 Professional Blood Glucose Monitoring System
GoodLife AC-305 Professional Blood Glucose Monitoring System
2. Submitter’s statement that the INDICATION/INTENDED USE of the modified device as described in
its labeling HAS NOT CHANGED along with the proposed labeling which includes instructions for
use, package labeling, and, if available, advertisements or promotional materials (labeling changes
are permitted as long as they do not affect the intended use).
3. A description of the device MODIFICATION(S), including clearly labeled diagrams, engineering
drawings, photographs, user’s and/or service manuals in sufficient detail to demonstrate that the
FUNDAMENTAL SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY of the modified device has not changed.
This change was for:
A. Addition of a Near Field Communication (NFC) module for wireless data transmission.
B. Addition of the NFC symbol to the S/N label of meters.
C. Change to the amount of foil-packed strips available: Added 15 strip and 100 strip packages
to the existing 50 strip package format.
D. Change to the bag size and the label size of foil packed strip package to accommodate the
new 15 and 100 strip package formats.
.
4. Comparison Information (similarities and differences) to applicant’s legally marketed predicate
device including, labeling, intended use, physical characteristics, and wireless data transmission
5. A Design Control Activities Summary which includes:
a) Identification of Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the modification on the
device and its components, and the results of the analysis
b) Based on the Risk Analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities
required, including methods or tests used and acceptance criteria to be applied

The labeling for this modified subject device has been reviewed to verify that the indication/intended use
for the device is unaffected by the modification. In addition, the submitter’s description of the particular
modification(s) and the comparative information between the modified and unmodified devices
demonstrate that the fundamental scientific technology has not changed. The submitter has provided the
design control information as specified in The New 510(k) Paradigm and on this basis, I recommend the
device be determined substantially equivalent to the previously cleared device.
The GoodLife AC-300 Blood Glucose Monitoring System, GoodLife AC-301 Blood Glucose Monitoring
System, GoodLife AC-302 Blood Glucose Monitoring System, GoodLife AC-303 Blood Glucose
Monitoring System, GoodLife AC-304 Blood Glucose Monitoring System, GoodLife AC-305 Blood
Glucose Monitoring System are intended for single-patient use. The GoodLife AC-300 Professional Blood
Glucose Monitoring System, GoodLife AC-301 Professional Blood Glucose Monitoring System, GoodLife
AC-302 Professional Blood Glucose Monitoring System, GoodLife AC-303 Professional Blood Glucose
Monitoring System, GoodLife AC-304 Professional Blood Glucose Monitoring System, GoodLife AC-305
Professional Blood Glucose Monitoring System are intended for multiple patient use in a professional
healthcare setting. Disinfection efficacy studies were performed for the predicate device (k113307) by an
outside commercial testing laboratory and demonstrated complete inactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV)
with the chosen disinfectant, Clorox Commercial Solutions® Clorox® Germicidal Wipes (EPA
Registration # 67619-12). Robustness studies also performed for the predicate device demonstrated that
there was no change in performance or external materials of the meters after 18,250 cleanings and
18,250 disinfection steps with Clorox Commercial Solutions® Clorox® Germicidal Wipes. The robustness
studies were designed to simulate 5 years of multi-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate
instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures. There were no physical changes to
the device relative to the predicate that would warrant new disinfection efficacy or robustness testing.
