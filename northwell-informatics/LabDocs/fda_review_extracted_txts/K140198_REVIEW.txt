I. Device Description:
The IMDx HSV-1/2 for Abbott m2000 assay uses nucleic acid extraction and purification
technology, performed on the Abbott m2000 Sample Preparation System (m2000sp),
combined with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), performed on the Abbott PCR
analyzer (m2000rt), to generate and detect amplified products from HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNA
that is isolated from clinical specimens. The presence of HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 target DNA is
indicated by the fluorescent signal generated through the use of fluorescently labeled
oligonucleotide probes on the Abbott m2000rt instrument. The probes do not generate a
signal unless they are specifically bound to the amplified product. The amplification cycle at
which fluorescent signal is detected by the Abbott m2000rt is inversely proportional to the
HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 DNA target concentration present in the original sample.
The IMDx HSV-1/2 for Abbott m2000 assay consists of two reagent kits packaged together:
• IMDx HSV-1/2 for Abbott m2000 Amplification Reagent Kit
• IMDx HSV-1/2 for Abbott m2000 Control Kit

L. Test Principle:
The IMDx HSV-1/2 for Abbott m2000 assay enables detection and differentiation of HSV-1
and HSV-2 DNA from clinical specimens and Internal Control through the following
workflow:
Sample Preparation
HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNA is extracted from the clinical specimens by the Abbott m2000sp, an
automated sample preparation system designed to use magnetic microparticles for the
purification of nucleic acids. The Abbott mSample Preparation System (4 x 24 Preps)
DNA
reagents lyse the HSV and the released DNA is then captured on magnetic microparticles that
are subsequently washed to remove unbound sample components. The bound DNA is eluted
and transferred to an Abbott 96-Deep-Well plate. The DNA is then ready for amplification.
The Internal Control is introduced into each specimen or control prior to the sample
preparation procedure and is processed along with the controls and specimens.
Reagent Preparation and Reaction Plate Assembly
The Abbott m2000sp combines the IMDx HSV-1/2 for Abbott m2000 Amplification Reagent
Pack components (IMDx HSV-1/2 for Abbott m2000 Amplification Reagent and IMDx PCR
Reagent-A) to prepare the Master Mix. The Abbott m2000sp dispenses the resulting Master
Mix into the Abbott 96-Well Optical Reaction Plate along with aliquots of the nucleic acid
samples prepared by the Abbott m2000sp. After manual application of the Abbott Optical
Adhesive Cover, the plate is ready for transfer to the Abbott m2000rt. Up to 96 tests can be
performed during each run, inclusive of a positive and negative control.
Amplification
During the amplification/detection reaction on the Abbott m2000rt instrument, the target
DNA is amplified by DNA polymerase in the presence of deoxynucleotide triphosphates
(dNTPs) and magnesium. The IMDx HSV-1/2 for Abbott m2000 Amplification Reagent
contains specific amplification primers for the HSV-1 Glycoprotein D gene, HSV-2 UL30
gene, and the IMDx Internal Control-B targets. During PCR amplification, high temperature
is used to separate the strands of double-stranded DNA. When the reaction is cooled to a
temperature at which DNA annealing can again occur, the analyte-specific, single-stranded
DNA oligonucleotide primers bind to the analyte DNA. The primers are extended by DNA
polymerase, thereby making an exact copy of a short stretch of the analyte DNA target
region. The DNA polymerase enzyme is a thermophilic enzyme that has been modified in its
active site by a molecule that renders it inactive. When the enzyme is heated prior to the
initiation of PCR, the inhibitory molecule dissociates from the enzyme allowing it to regain
its activity.
During each round of thermal cycling, amplification products dissociate to single strands at
high temperature, allowing primer annealing and extension as the temperature is lowered.
Exponential amplification of the target is achieved through repeated cycling between higher
and lower temperatures. Amplification of the HSV-1 Glycoprotein D gene, HSV-2 UL30
gene, and the IMDx Internal Control-B targets takes place simultaneously in the same
reaction.
4

--- Page 5 ---
Detection
During each round of PCR amplification, the fluorescent probes anneal to the amplified
target DNA, if present. The probes are labeled with different fluorescent molecules allowing
the HSV-1 Glycoprotein D gene, HSV-2 UL30 gene, and IMDx Internal Control-B targets to
be distinguished from each other. The probes are single-stranded, linear DNA
oligonucleotides modified with a fluorescent moiety covalently linked to one end of the
probe and a quenching moiety linked to the other end. When the probe binds to its
complementary sequence of the target during amplification, the fluorophore is released,
allowing fluorescent emission and detection.
Since this fluorescence occurs during every cycle, the PCR reaction can be read in real-time.
The amplification cycle at which fluorescent signal is detected by the Abbott m2000rt is
inversely proportional to the HSV-1 Glycoprotein D gene and HSV-2 UL30 gene DNA
target concentration present in the original sample.
Result Calling:
• HSV-1 and HSV-2: Results are reported independently for HSV-1, HSV-2 and IMDx
Internal Control-B.
• Positive and Negative Controls: If the IMDx HSV-1/2 for Abbott m2000 Positive
Control and IMDx Negative Control-B are outside of predetermined ranges, an error code
is generated and no results for the plate are reported.
• Internal Control: If the IMDx Internal Control-B is outside its pre-determined range, an
IC flag is generated. If no HSV-1 and HSV-2 targets are detected in a sample where the
IMDx Internal Control-B is outside its predetermined range, an error message is
generated, the sample is invalidated, and no HSV-1 or HSV-2 target results are reported.

Internal Control-B
The Internal Control-B consists of synthetic plasmid DNA, unrelated to HSV-1 and
HSV-2. An internal control is introduced into each specimen during sample
preparation to serve as an internal control. The internal control is amplified in the
same reaction as the HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNA targets, and serves to demonstrate that
the sample preparation and amplification processes have proceeded correctly for each
sample. The internal control primer and probe are pre-mixed in the Amplification
Reagent.
External Assay Controls
The positive control consists of a preparation of intact, inactivated HSV-1 and HSV-2
and is run as a separate control to demonstrate that the HSV-1/2 PCR reagents are
functional. In addition, the positive control functions as a process control to
demonstrate that sample preparation has proceeded correctly during the run. A
negative control consisting of M4RT viral transport medium is included in each run
to independently verify the absence of contaminating target material in assay
reagents.
e. Detection limit:
A Limit of Detection (LoD) study was performed to evaluate the analytical sensitivity
of the IMDx HSV-1/2 for Abbott m2000 assay using two representative strains of

of six 2-fold dilutions of the same strains of HSV-1 (McIntyre & Clinical Isolate 1)
and HSV-2 (MS & Clinical Isolate 1) was tested with three kit lots with 20 replicates
per dilution for each kit lot. The results from the three kit lots were combined to
provide a total of 60 results for each level of an HSV strain and each LoD was
determined using probit analysis. The final LoDs are presented in the table below.

diluted to 3 X LoD in M4RT viral transport medium and was tested in triplicate. All
strains were detected by the assay, demonstrating that the IMDx HSV-1/2 for Abbott
m2000 assay can detect a broad range of both HSV-1 and HSV-2 isolates.
f. Analytical specificity:
A study was performed to evaluate the performance of the IMDx HSV-1/2 for Abbott
m2000 assay in the presence of fifty (50) microorganisms and human DNA that might
be found in anogenital or oral skin lesion specimens. The panel members were
obtained from suppliers as purified genomic DNA (GD) or quantified cultures (QC),
or prepared in house (IHC) by growing each organism and quantifying the culture.
Bacteria were tested at 106cfu/ml or higher for bacteria and 105pfu/ml or higher for
viruses. For bacteria that were difficult to obtain or grow, purified DNA was used in
the place of the intact microorganism, and tested at a concentration of ≥1 × 106
genome copies/mL. Human DNA was tested at a concentration of 1 × 105 genome
copies/mL. All samples were prepared by diluting microorganisms or DNA into
M4RT viral transport medium prior to testing for cross-reactivity. No strains tested
were positive for HSV-1 or HSV-2 using the IMDx HSV-1/2 for Abbott m2000
assay. Similarly, no cross-reactivity was observed with human DNA.
To assess microbial interference, each test microorganism from the panel was added

to a sample tube containing one of four strains of HSV (HSV-1 MacIntyre, HSV-1
Clinical Isolate 1, HSV-2 MS, or HSV-2 Clinical Isolate 1) at 2-3 X LoD in M4RT
viral transport medium. Each potentially interfering microorganism was tested in
three (3) replicates at the same levels used in the cross-reactivity study described
above. The IMDx HSV-1/2 for Abbott m2000 assay was challenged with
microorganisms and the results of each test run were assessed for a change in result
call from detected to not detected for the HSV-1 or HSV-2 target. No evidence of
microbial interference was observed for any of the 50 test microorganisms included in
the analysis. Similarly, no evidence of interference was observed for human DNA.

g. Interfering Studies
This study was performed to evaluate potential interference with the IMDx HSV-1/2
for Abbott m2000 assay with a panel of twenty-eight (28) biological and chemical
substances. All of the potentially interfering substances were tested at concentrations
at or above physiological levels or typical usage levels with two HSV-1 strains
(MacIntyre and Clinical Isolate 1), and two HSV-2 strains (MS and Clinical Isolate
1). The study was carried out in the presence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 at 2-3 X LoD to
evaluate potential interference with the detection of the HSV-1 and HSV-2 targets.
The study was also carried out in the absence of HSV to evaluate potential
interference with the detection of the internal control of the IMDx HSV-1/2 for
Abbott m2000 assay. Each potentially interfering substance was tested in triplicate.
No interference was observed with any of the substances tested.

h. Specimen Stability in Viral Transport Media
The performance of the IMDx HSV-1/2 for Abbott m2000 assay and the specimen
stability were assessed with the following viral transport media: Remel M4, Remel
M4RT, Remel M5, Remel M6, and BD Universal Viral Transport (UVT). Each
transport medium was spiked with HSV-1 MacIntyre strain and HSV-2 MS strain at
2-3 X LoD and stored and tested at the following temperatures and intervals:
Refrigerated (2°C to 8°C)/Day 0, 2, 4, 7, and 8; Frozen (-300C to -10°C)/ Day 0, 2, 4,
7, 8, 11, 21, 28, 35, 64, 81, and 177. The viral transport media were also tested in the
absence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 to determine if the viral transport media interfered with
the detection of the internal control in negative samples.
For the specimen freeze-thaw study, stability was assessed by alternately freezing
specimens at -300C to -100C for a minimum of 2 hours and thawing at room
temperature for a minimum of 2 hours. Each specimen was tested in replicates of
three (3) for the stability studies at different conditions.
There was no interference observed with the Remel M4, Remel M4RT, Remel M5,
Remel M6, and BD Universal Viral Transport (UVT) media for the detection of
HSV-1 and HSV- 2 target or the internal control. The study data supported the
stability claims for HSV-1 and HSV-2 specimens collected in Remel M4, Remel
M4RT, Remel M5, Remel M6, and BD Universal Viral Transport (UVT) viral
transport media refrigerated (2°C to 8°C) for 7 days and frozen (-30°C to -10°C) for 6
months. The data also supported the claim that the specimens may undergo three (3)
freeze/thaw cycles.

i. Competitive Inhibition
Competitive inhibition of the IMDx HSV-1/2 for Abbott m2000 assay was evaluated
to assess the potential for interference in HSV-1/2 target detection when both viruses
are present in a sample. Two strains of HSV-1 (MacIntyre and Clinical Isolate 1) and
two strains of HSV-2 (MS and Clinical Isolate 1) were used for the study. Contrived
samples were made to mimic HSV-1 and HSV-2 co-infections, where one target was
present at LoD and the second target was present at a higher concentration. No
interference was seen in the detection of both HSV-1 strains in the presence of either
HSV-2 strain at concentrations of up to 1.0 x 105 TCID /mL. The highest
50
concentration of HSV-1 that could be present while maintaining detection of the
HSV-2 Clinical Isolate-1 target at 1X LoD was 100 TCID /mL. The highest
50
concentration of HSV-1 that could be present while maintaining detection of the
HSV-2 MS target at 1 X LoD was 50 TCID /mL.

h. Carry-over/Cross Contamination
Five assay runs were performed with alternating high positive and negative samples
using two contrived HSV-positive samples: one prepared using intact HSV-1 and
HSV-2 at cycle number (CN) values of 26.6 (HSV-1) and 25.5 (HSV-2), and a
second using HSV-1 and HSV-2 plasmid at cycle number (CN) values of 18.2 (HSV-
1) and 19.8 (HSV-2). No carryover events (0/138) were observed with the contrived
HSV samples formulated with intact virus. A carryover rate of 1.4% (2/144) was
observed with the plasmid-based contrived HSV samples.

system with HSV typing by fluorescently labeled antibodies.
Clinical Performance
The performance of the IMDx HSV-1/2 for Abbott m2000 assay was evaluated at
four geographically diverse locations within the United States. A total of 954
prospective specimens (807 anogenital and 147 oral) were tested by the IMDx HSV-
1/2 for Abbott m2000 assay and were compared to results obtained from the ELVIS®
(Enzyme Linked Virus Inducible System) HSV ID and D3 Typing Test System
(Diagnostic Hybrids, Athens, OH). The reference ELVIS viral culture used in this
study is unable to detect co-infected specimens and cannot identify HSV-1 if HSV-2
is identified first. Consequently, if a specimen was positive for HSV-2, it was
removed from the calculation of the HSV-1 clinical performance.
Prospective Studies: One hundred and sixty one (161) anogenital prospective
specimens identified as HSV-2 positive by ELVIS viral culture were removed from
the initial 807 anogenital specimens for the calculation of the HSV-1 clinical
performance. Due to low prevalence of HSV-2 in oral specimens, only two oral
specimens identified as HSV-2 positive by ELVIS viral culture were removed from
the initial 147 oral specimens for the calculation of the HSV-1 clinical performance.
Retrospective Studies: A total of 54 retrospective specimens (27 anogenital and 27
oral) were tested with the IMDx HSV-1/2 for Abbott m2000 assay and results were
compared to historical results from the ELVIS® HSV ID and D3 Typing Test System.
Twelve (12) anogenital specimens identified as HSV-2 positive by ELVIS viral
culture were removed from the initial 27 anogenital specimens for the calculation of
the HSV-1 clinical performance. There was no HSV-2 detected by the IMDx HSV-
1/2 for Abbott m2000 in the 27 oral specimens in agreement with the historical
culture results.
Results from the prospective and retrospective studies are presented in the tables
below.

negative oral samples remaining from the clinical specimens used for the method
comparison study were also tested. All samples were randomized and blinded to the
operator prior to testing. HSV-2 was detected in all contrived samples at all
concentrations tested.

Prevalence: The prevalence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 observed during the multi-center
clinical study was calculated for the IMDx HSV-1/2 for Abbott m2000 assay. The
prevalence rates for HSV-1 were individually established as 18.7% (121/646) for
anogenital samples and 42.1% (61/145) for oral samples. The prevalence rates for HSV-2
were individually established as 27.9% (225/807) for anogenital samples and 1.4%
(2/147) for oral samples.

Positive and Negative Predictive Value: Hypothetical positive and negative
predictive values (PPV & NPV) for the IMDx HSV-1/2 for Abbott m2000 assay are
shown below. These calculations are based on hypothetical prevalence and overall
sensitivity and specificity per specimen type as determined in the clinical trial.
For HSV-1, these calculations are based upon an overall sensitivity and specificity of
99.0% and 96.3%, respectively, for anogenital swabs and 100.0% and 77.8%,
respectively, for oral swabs. For HSV-2, these calculations are based upon an overall
sensitivity and specificity of 97.5% and 89.5%, respectively, for anogenital swabs and
0.0% and 98.6%, respectively, for oral swabs.
PPV was calculated using:
(Sensitivity x Prevalence)/([Sensitivity x Prevalence] + [1 - Specificity] x [1 -
Prevalence]).
NPV was calculated using:
(Specificity x [1 - Prevalence])/([1 - Sensitivity] x Prevalence + Specificity x [1 -
Prevalence]).
