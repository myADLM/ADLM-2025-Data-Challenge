L. Test Principle:
The Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System, Model GM720 uses electrochemical
methodologies. The system quantitatively measures blood glucose levels using an
amperometric method. The system employs flavin adenine dinucleotide-glucose
dehydrogenase (GDH-FAD) enzyme chemistry. The electrons generated during this reaction
are transferred from the blood to the electrodes. The magnitude of the resultant current is
proportional to the concentration of glucose in the specimen and the signal is converted into a
readout displayed on the meter.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
All performance characteristics were conducted on Rightest Blood Glucose Meter GM720
using the Rightest Blood Glucose Test Strip GS720. Testing performed on the Rightest
Blood Glucose Meter GM720 and the Rightest Blood Glucose Test Strip GS720 to
characterize performance of both the Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM720
and the Rightest Professional Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM720 is adequate since
both meters and the respective test strips are identical.
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility
Within-run (Repeatability)
Venous blood from one donor was adjusted with glucose to five glucose levels (30-
50, 51-110, 111-150, 151-250, 251-400) across the claimed range and tested on three
lots of strips on 30 meters (10 meters per test strip lot). Ten replicates were tested per
meter, test strip lot and glucose concentration. Results are summarized below:

Intermediate Precision
Intermediate precision was evaluated using three lots of test strips and ten meters.
Glucose control solutions in three concentration ranges were used (low range: 46.5~51.5
mg/dL, mid-range: 95~105 mg/dL, and high range: 285~315 mg/dL). Each control
solution was measured 10 times, on three test strip lots over 10 days, so that 100
individual measurements were generated (300 measurements per glucose level). Results
are summarized below:
Control Level Mean SD

3 271.9 5.8 2.1
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using 15 venous blood glucose samples to cover the 20-600
mg/dL measuring range. Glucose concentrations according to the reference method were
as follows: 0, 17.7, 23.7, 54.1, 116.5, 149.5, 215.0, 260.5, 318.5, 352.5, 410.0, 476.5,
506.5, 542.5, 617.5 mg/dL. Each glucose level was measured in triplicate on 3 lots.
Linear regression analysis for each test strip lot compared to the YSI resulted in:
y = 1.0311x – 5.3228; R2 = 0.9993 for Test Strip Lot 1
y = 1.0213x – 6.7709; R2 = 0.9986 for Test Strip Lot 2
y = 1.0203x – 4.694; R2 = 0.9983 for Test Strip Lot 3
y = 1.0226x – 5.023; R2 = 0.9982 for the lots combined
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measuring range of 20 to
600 mg/dL for this device. Data from bench studies and software verification studies
were provided to demonstrate that if a sample is less than 20 mg/dL glucose, the result is
flagged by the meter as LO and if a sample result exceeds 600 mg/dL glucose, the result
is flagged by the meter as HI.

c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
1. Traceability
The system is traceable to the NIST SRM 917b, dry D-glucose, reference material.
2. Stability
Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria for Rightest Blood Glucose Test
Strips GS720 were previously reviewed in k110737. The manufacturer claims shelf
life stability of 18 months and an open-vial stability of 4 months at the recommended
storage temperatures of 39°F-86°F with 10-90% relative humidity.
Control Solution Value Assignment and Stability:
Value assignment was established for the Rightest Control Solutions Level 1, 2 and 4
in k110737.
Stability testing protocols and acceptance criteria were previously reviewed and
found to be acceptable to support the shelf life stability claim of 16 months and an
open-vial stability claim of 3 months when stored at the recommended storage
temperatures of 36°F to 86°F.
d. Detection limit:
See linearity study in Section M1b above.
e. Analytical specificity:
To assess potential interference the sponsor used three test strip lots to evaluate two
glucose concentration intervals (60-100 and 150-300 mg/dL) in order to analyze 19
substances tested at a therapeutic and a toxic level. . Glucose values measured with
Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System at test conditions were compared with
values measured at control condition (without interferent). Results are presented in
the table below:

User performance study
Fingerstick, palm, and forearm: The user performance study was performed to
compare the lay user self-test results and the YSI method. Study was performed at
multiple clinical sites with 165 subjects self-testing using the fingertip and palm and
164 subjects self-testing for the forearm. The study participants were provided with
the User’s Manual in English, and performed fingerstick, palm, and forearm tests on
their own. A technician collected capillary blood from each participant for
measurement on YSI. The range of glucose values for the finger stick samples was
54 -333 mg/dL measured by YSI. Three test strip lots were tested in the study.

Yes ____X____ or No ________
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with this device. Samples are applied directly
to the test strip as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger and
palm or forearm. The whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary
action. The professional version of the meter is validated for venous, and arterial blood.
5. Calibration:
There is no calibration required for the blood glucose meter by the user. The meter is
automatically coded.
6. Quality Control:
Glucose control solutions at 3 different concentrations can be run with this device. The
meter automatically distinguishes control solution from blood and marks control solution
tests with a check mark and excludes them from average calculations. Recommendations
on when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. An acceptable range for
each control level is printed on the test strip bottle label and on the bottom of the test strip
box. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside these
ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Sample volume study:
Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM720 was tested with venous blood at
three glucose concentration intervals (40-60, 80-120, and 300-330 mg/dL) and nine
specimen volumes. For each glucose interval, the specimen volumes were adjusted to
0.60, 0.65, 0.70, 0.75, 0.80, 1.00, 1.25, 2.00, and 3.00μL. Each sample was measured in
three replicates for each of three test strip lots and same sample was also measured by
YSI. The bias for the three replicates in each test strip lot was calculated. Results
support the claimed minimum sample volume of .75 mL.

--- Page 16 ---
2. Altitude Study:
To evaluate the effects of altitude, 3 test strip lots were tested on 3 meters using three
whole blood samples with glucose concentrations of 50-75, 80-120, and 270-330
mg/dL. The samples were tested at 3281 ft, 6562 ft and 10,000 ft above sea level and
at sea level (0 feet) as a control. Results obtained were compared with those obtained
with the reference method (YSI). The results demonstrate acceptable bias to YSI to
support the claims in the labeling that altitudes up to 10,000 ft have no significant
effect on blood glucose measurements from the Rightest GM720 glucose meter.
3. Hematocrit Study:
The Rightest Blood Glucose Monitoring System GM720 was tested with venous blood
at six glucose concentrations (20-50, 60-80, 135-165, 180-220, 270-330 and 360-440
mg/dL). For each glucose concentration interval, the hematocrit levels were adjusted to
10, 20, 25, 30, 40, 55, 60, 65 and 70%. Each sample was measured in replicates of five
on three test strip lots. Results were compared to YSI. The % bias relative to YSI
demonstrated adequate performance to support the claimed hematocrit range of 20 –
65%.
4. Test System operating conditions:
Temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated for temperatures
ranging from 42.8oF-111.2oF and relative humidity from 10% to 90% including
extreme combinations of temperature and humidity, e.g. lowest humidity with lowest
and highest temperature and highest humidity with lowest and highest temperature.
Protocol and acceptance criteria were provided and found to be acceptable. The results
supported the Sponsor’s claimed operating temperature from 42.8oF-111.2oF and
relative humidity range from 10% to 90%.
5. Readability Assessment:
The readability of the labeling (user guide, quick reference guide and test strip insert)
using a Flesch-Kincaid analysis were found to be written at the 8th grade level.
During the lay user study described above in Section M.3.c, the participants were
asked to complete a questionnaire to evaluate the ease of use of the device and the
clarity of the English language labeling. Overall the users indicated that they could
successfully perform the test and that the user manual was written clearly.
6. EMC Testing:
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electromagnetic testing
(EMC) had been performed using IEC 60601-1-2; Medical electrical equipment- Part l-
2: General requirements for safety - Collateral standard : Electromagnetic compatibility
- Requirements and tests.

--- Page 17 ---
7. Infection Control Studies:
The device system is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy
studies were performed on the materials comprising the meter by an outside
commercial testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of Hepatitis B
Surface Antigen (HBsAg) with the chosen disinfectant, Discide® ultra disinfecting
towelettes, EPA Reg. # 10492-4. Robustness studies were also performed by the
sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or external materials
of the meter after 12000 cleanings and 12000 disinfection steps with the 24000
wipes. The robustness studies were designed to simulate 3 years of multiple-patient
use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate instructions for the validated cleaning and
disinfection procedures.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
The submitted information in this premarket notification is complete and supports a
substantial equivalence decision.
