H. Intended Use:
1. Intended use(s):
See Indications for Use below.
2. Indication(s) for use:
The One Step Single/Multi-drug Test Cup and One Step Single/Multi-drug Test Dipcard
are lateral flow chromatographic immunoassays designed to qualitatively detect the
presence of drugs and drug metabolites in human urine at the following cut-off
concentrations:
Test Calibrator Cut-off level
Barbiturates (BAR) Secobarbital 300 ng/mL
Benzodiazepines (BZO) Oxazepam 300 ng/mL
Methylenedioxymeth- 3,4-Methylenedioxy-
500 ng/mL
amphetamine (MDMA) methamphetamine
Methadone (MTD) Methadone 300 ng/mL
Oxycodone (OXY) Oxycodone 100 ng/mL
Phencyclidine (PCP) Phencyclidine 25 ng/mL
The tests are available in one of two formats: 1) Test Cup, 2) Test Dipcard, The test
configuration comes with a single drug screening test or any combinations of multiple
drug screening tests. The test is intended for in vitro diagnostics use. They are intended
for prescription use in clinical laboratories only and not for point-of-care use.
This assay provides only a preliminary analytical test result. Gas Chromatography/Mass
spectrometry (GC/MS) is the preferred confirmatory method. Clinical consideration and
professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly
when preliminary positive results are indicated.
3. Special conditions for use statement(s):
For Prescription Use in Clinical Laboratories.
4. Special instrument requirements:
Not applicable; this is a visually read single use device.

I. Device Description:
The One Step Single/Multi-drug Test Cup and One Step Single/Multi-drug Test Dipcard are
competitive binding, lateral flow immunochromatographic assays for qualitative detection of
Barbiturates, Benzodiazepines, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, Methadone, Oxycodone,
Phencyclidine and their metabolites in human urine at or above the cut-off levels as
indicated. The devices are available in one of two formats: 1) Test Cup, 2) Test Dipcard. The
test configuration comes with single drug screening test or any combinations of multiple drug
screening tests. The tests are visually read.

K. Standard/Guidance Document Referenced (if applicable):
None were referenced.
L. Test Principle:
The One Step Single/Multi-drug Test Cup and the One Step Single/Multi-drug Test Dipcard
employ lateral flow immunochromatographic technology based on the principle of
competitive binding. Drugs, if present in concentrations below the cutoff level, will not
saturate the binding sites of monoclonal antibody (mouse) coated particles in the device. The
antibody-coated particles will then be captured by immobilized drug-specific conjugate and a
colored line will appear in the test line region indicating a negative result. The colored line
will not form if the sample contains drug in excess of the cutoff level because the drug will
saturate all the binding sites of the drug-specific antibody, indicating a positive result. Each
strip in the device contains a procedural control that appears in the control line region
regardless of the presence of drug, indicating that the sample has migrated properly on the
test strip.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Initial precision studies were performed using the single drug and multi-drug test
formats. For these studies, drug free urine specimens were spiked with drug analyte at
different concentrations containing 0, +/- 75% cutoff, +/- 50% cutoff, +/- 25% cutoff,
+100% cutoff and cutoff of drug. The concentrations of the target drug were
confirmed with GC/MS. In both the single drug test precision study and the multi-
drug test precision study each concentration of urine specimen was divided into
aliquots. Each aliquot was blindly labeled with a separate number by a nonparticipant
and each aliquot was tested with one test format only (test dipcard or test cup). The
study was conducted at 3 hospital laboratories. Two operators per location tested 3
aliquots at each concentration for each lot per day (3runs/day) for 10 non-consecutive
days using one device lot per location. One operator tested the test dipcard format and

The original precision study data showed numerous negative results in the specimens
containing drug concentrations at +50% above the cutoff. A root cause analysis was
conducted by the sponsor to determine the cause of these results. The root cause was
identified to be inconsistent and inadequate volume of aliquoted samples. The
sponsor revised the precision study protocol to specify a sample volume per vial and
supplemental precision studies were conducted to verify that the root cause was

correctly identified.
Supplemental precision studies were conducted for the single drug and multi-drug test
formats using drug free urine specimens spiked with one drug analyte at different
concentrations containing 0, +/- 75% cutoff, +/- 50% cutoff, +/- 25% cutoff, +100%
cutoff and cutoff of drug. The concentrations of the target drug were confirmed with
GC/MS. In both the single drug test precision study and the multi-drug test precision
study each concentration of urine specimen was divided into aliquots. Each aliquot
was blindly labeled with a separate number by a nonparticipant and each aliquot was
tested with one test format only (test dipcard or test cup). The study was conducted at
3 hospital laboratories. Two operators per location tested 3 aliquots at each
concentration for each lot per day (3runs/day) for 10 non-consecutive days using one
device lot per location. One operator tested the test dipcard format and the second
operator tested the test cup format. Results from these supplemental precision studies
are presented in the following tables:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Not Applicable.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
External controls are not supplied with this device. The labeling provides information
on where external controls can be obtained.
Stability
Accelerated and real time studies have been conducted for The One Step Single/Multi-
drug Test Cup and the One Step Single/Multi-drug Test Dipcard devices. Protocols and
acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable. The information
supports the following expiration date for the unopened (shelf-life) stability: 24
months under 4 ~ 30° C for both the Test Cup and Dipcard formats.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable these are qualitative devices.
e. Analytical specificity:
I. Cross Reactivity with related substances
Analytical Cross-reactivity (specificity) studies were conducted. Drugs and drug
metabolites within the same class of drugs, or with similar molecular structures that
may cross-react were studied. When a positive result from a compound was
observed, the interferent was serially diluted with a drug-free specimen until a

Drug free specimens containing drug concentrations at +/- 50% of the cutoff
were spiked with each compound at a concentration of 100 ug/mL. The
concentrations of target drug were confirmed with GC/MS. Each sample was
tested in 3 replicates. The common compounds listed in this table were found
not to interfere with test results at a test concentration of 100µg/mL.

pH and specific gravity conditions:
To evaluate the effects of variable range of pH and specific gravity conditions
that might exist within the body, two pools of specimen were altered to reflect
the physiological conditions. One pool was altered to contain a drug
concentration +50% of the cutoff and the other pool was altered to contain a
drug concentration -50% of the cutoff. The performances of the test device
under varying pH (3-9) and specific gravity (0.900-1.050 g/mL) conditions
were studied and it was observed that pH ranges from pH 3 to pH 9 and
specific gravity ranges from 1.002 – 1.040 g/mL did not affect the
expected testing results.
f. Assay cut-off:
The test cut-off was determined according to the precision study. See precision
studies above in section 1.M.1.a.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
The study was performed using unaltered clinical urine specimens compared to
GC/MS. Samples were divided by concentration into five categories as stated in the
tables below. The samples were further divided into 2 sets, one for cup format testing
and one for dipcard format testing. All aliquots were blindly labeled by a
nonparticipant and samples were randomized prior to testing. Tests were performed at
two hospital laboratories by 4 lab technicians (2 operators per site). One site tested
the dipcard format and the other site tested the test cup format. For each drug analyte,
a total of 80 specimens were tested using the single-drug and multi-drug test dipcard
and the test cup formats. The results are presented below:
