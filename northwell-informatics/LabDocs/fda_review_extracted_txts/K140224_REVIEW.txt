L. Test Principle:
The principle of the EUROIMMUN EUROLINE ENA Profile 9 Ag (IgG) is that of
an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using a membrane as the solid
phase instead of microtiter wells. Different purified antigens have been coated and
applied in easy to read lines (bands) onto a membrane strip.

Autoantibodies in patient samples bind to the bands and are detected via a secondary
antibody linked to an enzyme. The strips can be evaluated visually by comparison of
the band intensity with the reaction control card or they can be digitized by use of a
flatbed scanner and evaluated with the computer software EUROLineScan.
The control band on the strips contains (non-specific) anti-human IgG, which reacts
with the sample IgG to show a color reaction if the incubation was performed
correctly and so represents a function test on each single strip.
The positive control contains a mixture of the targeted antibodies which bind to the
antigen coated on the blot strips. A strip incubated with the positive control shows a
positive result. If either the control band or the strip incubated with the positive
control is negative, test results are invalid and should be repeated.
The qualitative results are reported for each individual antibody separately as positive
or negative. The intensity of the reaction is not reported but only as a means to
distinguish between a positive and negative reaction and not as an indication of
disease status. The interpretation of the test results does not include a combined score
or diagnosis.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
Test results were evaluated by visual or automated reading of the test strips.
For visual evaluation, the reaction intensity of each antigen band on the test strip
was compared to the two color bars on the reaction control card that correspond to
the intensities just below (negative) and just above (positive) the cut-off.
For automated evaluation, the test strips are scanned using a flatbed scanner and
evaluated with EUROLineScan with a cut-off of 11 grey scale units.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Assay reproducibility was determined by testing 6 or 7 samples that cover the
complete range of results (negative, positive and near to cut-off).
The intra-assay reproducibility is based on 20 replicates tested in one day
using the same kit lot.

lot, each run on a different day with 3 replicates per run performed by the
same technician. Evaluation was performed both visually using the reaction
control card and automatically using the EUROLineScan software with a cut-
off of 11 grey scale units. The results are shown in the table below.

Controls: Controls are derived from human serum and match pre-specified
performance criteria.
Stability:
i. Real-time and accelerated stability
The stability studies were performed in accordance with EN 13640:2002
(Stability Testing of In Vitro Diagnostic Reagents) to demonstrate
unopened kit shelf-life stability (from the date of manufacture when stored
at recommended temperature 2-8°C) and opened kit shelf-life stability.
The acceptance criteria are that results do not differ more than one result
level [pos, pos (near the cutoff), neg (near the cutoff) and neg] from the
reference run (real-time stability study: day 0; accelerated stability study
and transportation simulation: 4°C stored sample).
For real-time stability study, three lots of all kit components stored at
recommended storage temperature 2-8°C were evaluated at different
occasions with three samples per antigen band. Original sealed kits and
opened kits were demonstrated to be stable for up to 18 and 12 months,
respectively, when stored at 2-8ºC.
For accelerated study, three lots of all kits components were stored for 7
days at 37°C and evaluated with 3 samples per antigen band. The same
lots stored at 4°C were used as reference. Reagents were shown to be
stable for 7 days at 37°C.
ii. Transport stability
To simulate transportation of kits from Europe to US, one lot of an
example EUROLINE test kit with equal composition and technology as
the EUROLINE ENA Profile 9 Ag (IgG) was stored for 7 days at 4°C and
-20°C and evaluated with 4 different samples. This simulation showed
that no deviation was obtained between the results of the differently stored
kits for the different antigen bands.
d. Detection limit:
Not applicable
e. Analytical specificity:
i) Endogenous Interference: Interference testing was performed for each
antigen using at least 6 samples that cover the complete range of results
(negative, positive and near to cut-off) for each antigen. Each sample was
spiked with two different levels of endogenous interfering substances,
namely hemoglobin, triglycerides and bilirubin. Evaluation of test results

was performed visually and no significant interference was observed for
concentrations up to 500 mg/dL for hemoglobin, 2000 mg/dL for
triglycerides and 40 mg/dL for bilirubin.
ii) Cross-reactivity: Analytical cross-reactivity was investigated using the
ANA reference panel (n=12) of the Center for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC, Atlanta, USA). The ANA reference panel includes:
native DNA, SS-B, RNP/SS-B/SS-A, RNP, Sm, U3-RNP, SS-A,
Centromere, Scl-70, Jo-1, PM-Scl, and ribosomal P-proteins. Each
reference sample showed the expected reactivity against the EUROLINE
ENA antigen bands.
f. Assay cut-off:
The cut-off is predefined by the visual evaluation. A sample is positive if the
respective band is clearly visible. The cut-off for each antigen on the
EUROLINE was set to the lowest limit of a clearly visible band.
To confirm the assay cut-off, 1118 clinically characterized samples sent in to
a clinical laboratory for determination of ANA (338 men and 780 women with
an average age of 57 years and age range between 18 and 99 years), as well as
150 control samples (79 men and 71 women with an average age of 37 years
and age range: 18 – 67 years) were tested. The results showed that negative
and positive results can clearly be discriminated by the assay.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A comparison study was performed with clinically characterized samples
obtained from different sources in Europe and North America. The samples
were tested with the EUROIMMUN EUROLINE ENA Profile 9 Ag (IgG) and
with the ELISA kits (k123261 or k063565) as the predicate devices. In
addition, 5 to 12 artificial samples with antibody concentrations close to the
cut-off were created for each antigen by mixing positive samples with
negative sample as diluent of the same matrix. The total numbers of samples
tested for each antigen differ as shown in the table below.

b. Other clinical supportive data (when a. is not applicable):
Not applicable.
4. Clinical cut-off:
See Assay cut-off.
5. Expected values/Reference range:
The levels of autoantibodies against nRMP/Sm, Sm, SS-A, Ro-52, SS-B, Scl-70,
Jo-1, CENP B and ribosomal P-proteins were analyzed in a panel of 173 samples
from US asymptomatic blood donors of mixed age and sex (79 men, 94 women
with a mean age of 38.3 years and age range between 19 and 50 years). The result
provided in the table below showed that the % samples found positive for each
autoantibody ranges from 0 to 3.5. It is recommended that each laboratory
determine its own normal range based on the population and equipment used.
