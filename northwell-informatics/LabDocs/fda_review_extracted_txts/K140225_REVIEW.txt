L. Test Principle:
The EliA wells are molded cups comparable to excised wells from a microtiter plate. They
are made of polystyrene and are coated with the respective antigen. The wells are at the
same time a holder of the coupled antigen for convenient automation and a reaction chamber
with reaction/washing solution handling based on pipetting to add and aspiration to remove
liquids.
The EliA wells are coated with human PR3 protein, or human MPO protein, or human
recombinant α3 chain of collagen IV. If present in the patient's specimen, antibodies to these
proteins bind to the specific antigen. After washing away non-bound antibodies, enzyme-

labeled antibodies against human IgG antibodies (EliA IgG Conjugate) are added to form an
antibody-conjugate complex. After incubation, non-bound conjugate is washed away and the
bound complex is incubated with a Development Solution. After stopping the reaction, the
fluorescence in the reaction mixture is measured. The higher the response value, the more
specific IgG is present in the specimen. To evaluate test results, the response for patient
samples is compared directly to the response for calibrators.

EliA GBM Assay:
The precision of the EliA GBM assay on the Phadia 100 and Phadia 250 was
evaluated on six samples containing various concentrations of antibodies. Each
sample was run on three instruments, four replicates per run, one run a day, for seven
days with one reagent lot (total of 84 observations per sample). The results are
summarized in the table below:

Lot-to-lot reproducibility for EliA GBM assay was tested on Phadia 100 with four
samples with mean concentration of 0.2, 13.1, 23.9, and 48.1 U/mL. Each sample
was run with duplicate per run, one run a day on three instruments for six days with
three lots of reagents for a total of 108 observations per sample. The results show the
CV% between 3.6% and 8.4% for the lot-to-lot variation.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity: For each of EliA PR3S, EliA MPOS, and EliA GBM assays, at least five
positive patient serum samples for each assay were serially diluted and tested for each
assay. Each dilution was tested in triplicate on Phadia 100 and Phadia 250. The
results of the dilutions were compared with their expected value. The linear
regression analysis for each assay gives the following equation:

The technical measuring range (detection limit, upper limit) for EliA is PR3S from 0.7
to ≥ 177 EliA U/mL. The upper limit of the reported results in EliA U/mL can vary
due to a lot-specific conversion from μg/L to EliA U/mL. Results above the upper
limit are reported as “above”. Linearity was shown for samples in the range from
0.4–226.6 EliA U/mL. The labeling states that due to differing binding
characteristics of the antibodies in patient samples, not all sera can be diluted linearly
within the technical measuring range.

Hook effect: For each of three assays, hook effect was assessed by analyzing a high
positive serum sample with antibody concentration above the upper limit of the
measuring range of each assay. The results are summarized as follows:
EliA PR3S No hook effect was observed up to 20,154 U/mL
EliA MPOS No hook effect was observed up to 23,823 U/mL
EliA GBM No hook effect was observed up to 18,540 U/mL
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability: There is no international reference standard for IgG antibodies that
specifically recognize PR3, MPO or the human α3 chain of collagen IV. The
instrument measures specific IgG concentrations in μg/L. By using a conversion
factor given by the lot-specific code of the EliA™ test well, the results are
automatically converted to U/mL for EliA PR3S, EliA MPOS and EliA GBM.
Calibrators: The EliA IgG calibration is a total IgG calibration. The IgG calibrators
are traceable (via unbroken chain of calibrations) to the International Reference
Preparation (IRP) 67/86 of Human Serum Immunoglobulins A, G and M from WHO.
New batches of IgG calibrators are compared to a secondary standard (standardized
with the IRP) or the IRP directly and adjusted accordingly to meet the correct
concentration. The standardization of the assay is based on a set of six WHO-
standardized IgG Calibrators derived from human serum with the assigned values at
0, 4, 10, 20, 100, 600 µg/mL.
The calibrators are required to perform an initial calibration curve, which can be
stored in the Phadia instrument and may be used for up to 28 days on this and
additional IgG assays. Each additional assay outside of a calibration run includes
curve controls that have to fall within defined ranges to verify that the stored
calibration curve is still valid.
Controls: Both EliA ANCA/GBM Positive Control 100/250 and EliA IgG/IgM/IgA
Negative Control 100/250 are for single use only. The EliA™ IgG/IgM/IgA Negative
Control were cleared under k131821. The EliA ANCA/GBM Positive Control is
prepared from selected pooled human sera and contains IgG antibodies specific to
PR3, MPO and GBM. The mean values for every lot are determined with four
consecutive control assays, each in six replicates. Ranges are calculated as respective
mean ± 3SD. The target ranges for the EliA ANCA/GBM positive controls and EliA
IgG/IgM/IgA negative control for each of EliA PR3S, EliA MPOS, and EliA GBM
assays are shown below:

Stability:
Shelf life: : The stability of EliA PR3S wells, EliA MPOS wells and EliA GBM wells
was evaluated with both the real time and accelerated/stress study. The results
support stability of the kits under the recommended storage of 2 – 8°C for up to 18
months.
The stability of EliA ANCA/GBM positive control was evaluated with real time
stability study. The results support the stability of the EliA ANCA/GBM Positive
Control up to 9 months at 2-8°C.
On-board stability: The on-board stability EliA PR3S, EliA MPOS and EliA GBM
carriers (containing the antigen coated wells) was tested over four weeks using three
positive and two negative samples only on the Phadia 250 instrument since Phadia
100 reagents are stored off the instrument and are only loaded as needed for an assay.
The on-board stability for the Phadia 250 instrument was determined to be 28 days at
2-8°C.
Open vial stability: Stability of the foilbag containing the EliA PR3S wells, EliA
MPOS wells and EliA GBM wells after first opening was tested and determined to be
9 months at 2-8°C.
d. Detection limit:
The limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ)
study was modeled after CLSI EP17 by testing six blood donor samples from
apparently healthy subjects on three Phadia 100 and two Phadia 250 instruments. On

e. Analytical specificity:
Endogenous Interference: For each assay, interferences were assessed by testing four
serum samples: one negative, two positives with concentration levels around the cut-
off, and one high positive sample. Each sample was spiked with the interference
substances or substance-specific blank, and analyzed in two runs, three replicates per
run (n=6) using one lot of EliA antigen wells and one lot of system reagents. The
ratio of spiked and blank samples was calculated. The data demonstrated that the
three analytes were not adversely affected by high levels of the following substances
tested up to the concentrations listed in the table below:

f. Assay cut-off:
Based on the results of the expected values/reference range study described below in
Section M.5, the cut-offs were setup so that: 1) the 99th percentile of the results from
400 apparently healthy blood donor samples must be below the upper limit of the
equivocal range for EliA PR3Ss and EliA MPOS; and the 95th percentile below the
lower limit of the equivocal range for EliA GBM; 2) the lower limit of the equivocal
range is equal or higher than the lowest positive calibrator; 3) the upper limit of the
equivocal range is at least 1.4 fold above the lower limit of the equivocal range. The
assay cut-offs were set as follows:
EliA PR3S

2.0 – 3.0 U/mL Equivocal
> 3.0 U/mL Positive

EliA GBM Assay:
A total of 460 samples were included in the clinical validation for the EliA GBM
assay. The validation set of samples includes 69 samples from patients diagnosed
with Goodpasture syndrome and 391 samples from patients with other autoimmune
and infectious conditions. Clinical sensitivity and specificity to aid in diagnosis of
Goodpasture Syndrome are summarized in the following tables:
