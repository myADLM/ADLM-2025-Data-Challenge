L. Test Principle:
The carbon dioxide (in the form of bicarbonate HCO ) in the sample reacts with
3-
phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) in the presence of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) and
magnesium to yield oxaloacetic acid (OAA) and phosphate. In the second reaction, and in the
presence of malate dehydrogenase (MDH), the reduced cofactor isoxidized by OAA. The
reduced cofactor absorbs strongly at 405 nm, whereas its oxidizedform does not. The
difference in absorbance between the final reading and the blank,monitored bichromatically
at 405 nm/508 nm, is directly proportional to the total carbon dioxide concentration in the
sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Following CLSI EP5-A2, samples (low, middle, and high levels of carbon dioxide) were
tested in duplicate, twice a day, for 20 days, for a total of 80 results per level internally.
The samples were commercial serum controls, including one diluted sample, to evaluate
the low end measuring range. The results were tabulated and the data were analyzed for
means, standard deviations (SDs), and percent coefficients of variation (%CVs). The
precision results are summarized below.

POC Precision:
Studies for precision were performed at three external POL-type sites to evaluate the
Hitachi E40 Clinical Analyzer with S TEST Reagent Cartridge Carbon Dioxide in
one of its targeted intended use environments, the physician’s office laboratory.
For the external site precision study, each site received three blinded serum samples
(the Precision Panel, labeled A, B, and C) that were chosen to represent low, middle,
and high concentrations of carbon dioxide. Each sample was assayed six times per
day for five days, reporting 30 results per level. Precision results were as follows:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
A linearity study was performed according to the EP6-A guideline. Twelve (12) serial
dilutions, plus the zero standard (total = 13 samples), were prepared and tested. The
intermixture samples were prepared from a starting concentration of 55 mmol/L. All
samples were tested in duplicate by the Hitachi Clinical Analyzer E40. The mean Hitachi
results (y-axis) were plotted against the assigned values (x-axis) and a linear regression
analysis was performed across the claimed measuring range.
The linear regression correlation between the expected values and the measured values for
the CO is summarized below:

Slope y-intercept r2
0.918 0.091 0.9988
In addition, percent recovery for samples in the reportable range is shown in the table
below.
Sample Assigned Mean % Recovery
1 0.0 0.1 0.1 mmol/L
2 1.4 1.8 0.4 mmol/L

9 33.0 32.3 97.9%
10 38.5 36.2 94.0%
11 44.0 39.9 90.7%
The sponsor’s claimed range is 5 to 40 mmol/L. The percent recovery in the clinically
relevant sample range of 22.0-33.0 mmoL/L is within ± 5%.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The CO assay is traceable to American Chemical Society (ACS) reagent grade
2
sodium carbonate alkalimetric standard.
There is no calibration needed by the user. Each lot of S TEST Reagent Cartridge
Carbon Dioxide (CO2) is calibrated by the manufacturer prior to shipment using material
referenced to a standard which is traceable to American Chemical Society (ACS) reagent
grade sodium carbonate alkalimetric standard. The 2D code printed on each cartridge
provides the analyzer with lot-specific calibration data.

Controls
The sponsor recommends two commercially available controls for use with this assay in
the labeling.
d. Detection limit:
Following CLSI EP17-A2 guideline, the analytical sensitivity was defined as the limit of
detection (LoD), and the LoD was calculated from the limit of blank (LoB). For the LoB,
the blank sample for the carbon dioxide reagent system was assayed 20 times per day for
three days for a total of 60 replicate results. The LoB was estimated as the mean of the
57th and 58th highest values for the true blanks. For the LoD, five low samples were
assayed four times per day for three days, for a total of 60 replicate results. The LoD was
calculated as the LoB + 1.645 x SD of the low sample. The table below showed the
results for the LoB, and the LoD of the carbon dioxide reagent system.
Carbon Dioxide
LoB (mmol/L) 0.70
LoD (mmol/L) 0.89
The sponsor’s claimed measuring range of the CO2 assay is 5 to 40 mmol/L.
e. Analytical specificity:
Two levels of serum based samples (low and high, approximately 17 mmol/L and 30
mmol/L, respectively) were spiked to six levels with each interferent, and all seven
samples (the 6 spiked samples and the neat, zero baseline sample) were tested in
replicates of three by the Hitachi Clinical Analyzer E40 following CLSI EP-7A2
guideline. In each case, the spiked sample result mean was compared to its neat control
mean result, and recoveries were calculated. Significant interference was defined as a
change of ≥10% in recovery. Results are summarized as follows:
Lipemia: no significant interference up to 1,000 mg/dL Intralipid
Ascorbic acid: no significant interference up to 50 mg/dL
Hemoglobin: no significant interference up to 1,000 mg/dL
Unconjugated bilirubin: no interference up to 19.1 mg/dL
f. Assay cut-off:
Not applicable
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
A total of 96 serum samples including 3 spiked and 3 diluted samples spanning the
measuring range (5.0 to 40.0 mmol/L) were assayed in singleton and in a blinded fashion
by both the Hitachi E40 system and the Sekisui reagents on the predicate system. The
comparative data were analyzed by Deming regression and are shown below.

POC Method Comparison:
Three POL sites and a central laboratory received 47 blinded serum samples including
four diluted samples and three spiked samples ranging from 5.1 to 36.8 mmol/L.
Samples were assayed on the Hitachi E40 Clinical Analyzer at the POL sites using S
TEST Reagent Cartridge Carbon Dioxide (y) and the predicate device as the reference
method (x). Deming regression yielded the following results:
Site # n Range Regression “r” CI* CI Intercept
(mmol/L) Equation Slope
1 47 6.6 to 36.8 y = 0.91x + 1.49 0.984 0.87 to 0.95 0.67 to 2.32

* 2 samples at Site 2 quantitated below to dynamic range (<5 mmol/L) and were
excluded from data analysis.
For all three POL sites, a negative bias was observed for samples above the clinically
relevant range (>30 mmol/L) at POL sites. Difference between the candidate device
and the predicate device is very small within the clinically relevant range.
b. Matrix comparison:
A study was performed to validate the use of lithium heparin plasma as an alternative to
serum for the Hitachi Clinical Analyzer with S TEST Reagent Cartridge Carbon Dioxide.
Fifty (50) matched serum/plasma samples including 2 spiked and 4 diluted samples that
spanned the measuring range were assayed in singleton and the results were compared
using linear regression (plasma = y-axis).
