L. Test Principle:
The Joinsoon EON L and EON LS Glucose Monitoring Systems use an electrochemical
method based meter and dry reagent biosensor (test strip) for blood glucose testing. Both test
strips, the Joinsoon Single Strips and Joinsoon Snap Strips utilize the enzyme glucose
oxidase. Each non-coding test strip has a Reaction Zone with the Enzyme at one end, and
contact pads at the other end. The electron accumulates on the electrode when glucose reacts
with the reagent on the electrode. A current can be detected by the meter when a constant
voltage is applied across the electrodes. The current is converted to a glucose concentration
by an embedded transfer function in the meter. The size of the current is proportional to the
amount of glucose present in the sample.
M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance
a. Precision/Reproducibility
Within-run (Repeatability)
Venous blood from 3 donors was adjusted with glucose to five glucose levels (30-50,
51-110, 111-150, 151-250, 251-400) and tested on 3 lots of single test strips. Venous
blood from 3 other donors was adjusted with glucose to the same five glucose levels
and tested on 3 lots of multiple use test strips. Ten runs were performed on each
sample with 5 replicates per run/strip lot resulting in 100 replicates for each lot and
glucose level tested. Results are summarized below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using 3 lots of Single Strips and 3 lots of Snap Strips, with 8
meters and 20 venous whole blood samples with glucose levels ranging from 20-600
mg/dL (24, 64, 89, 120, 150, 191, 216, 250, 265, 317, 343, 395, 405, 428, 465, 496, 505,
521, 576, and 610), obtained by spiking pooled venous blood with a glucose solution.
Each glucose level was analyzed 8 times over 3 test strip lots. Linear regression analysis
for each test strip lot compared to the YSI resulted in:
Single Strips:
y = 0.9969x + 0.9751; R2 = 0.9995 for Test Strip Lot 1
y = 0.9967x – 0.0931; R2 = 0.9991 for Test Strip Lot 2
y = 0.9986x + 0.7973; R2 = 0.9995 for Test Strip Lot 3
Snap Strips:
y = 1.0067x + 0.6969; R2 = 0.9994 for Test Strip Lot 1
y = 1.012x – 2.3156; R2 = 0.9991 for Test Strip Lot 2
y = 0.9901x + 1.8869; R2 = 0.9992 for Test Strip Lot 3

The results of the study support the claimed glucose measurement range of 20 to 600
mg/dL for both test strip configurations.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Traceability
The system is traceable to the NIST SRM 917c reference material.
Test Strip Stability
Test strip stability was assessed in accelerated and real time studies. Testing
protocols and acceptance criteria for the Single Strip and Snap Strip test strips were
reviewed and found to be acceptable. The sponsor claims shelf life stability of 20
months and open vial stability of 3 months at 35.6°F-89.6°F (2°C-32°C) and 10-90%
relative humidity.
Control Solution Value assignment and stability:
Value assignment of the 3 levels of Joinsoon Control Solutions was determined in an
in-house procedure. The control solutions were prepared by gravimetric addition of
glucose to achieve the target values of 40, 120 and 360 mg/dL for Level 1, Level2,
and Level 3 respectively, and confirmed by YSI. The values for each level were
assigned by repeat analysis using 100 test strips and 10 meters. The mean, SD and
CV are used to establish the range for each solution, which is provided on the test
strip vial labels.
Control stability was assessed using accelerated and real time testing. Protocols and
acceptance criteria were reviewed and found to be acceptable to support the sponsor’s
shelf life claim of 30 months and open vial claim of 3 months at 2°C-32°C.
d. Detection limit:
Reference the device reportable range and the linearity studies (section M.1.b.).
e. Analytical specificity:
To assess potential interference the sponsor used venous whole blood samples
adjusted to three glucose concentration intervals of 76, 166, and 285 mg/dL. Each of
these samples was tested with the Joinsoon EON L Blood Glucose Meter with Single
Strip test strips and the Joinsoon EON LS Blood Glucose Meter with Snap Strips and
against YSI for a reference method. Each potential interfering substance was tested at
a minimum of two concentrations, normal/therapeutic and high/toxic concentrations.
Each sample was tested 10 times using 3 strip lots and the % difference between the

--- Page 10 ---
system sample and the YSI sample was calculated. Results are presented in the table
below:
Potential Interfering Concentration at

using wireless transmission?
Yes __________ or No ___X___
2. Software:
FDA has reviewed applicant’s Hazard Analysis and software development processes for
this line of product types:
Yes ___X____ or No _______
3. Specimen Identification:
There is no sample identification function with these devices. Samples are applied
directly to the test strips as they are collected.
4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose tests are intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger. The
whole blood sample is applied directly to the test strips by capillary action.
5. Calibration:
There is no calibration required by the user for the Joinsoon EON L or Joinsoon EON LS
blood glucose meters. The meters are automatically coded.
6. Quality Control:
Glucose control solutions at 3 different concentrations (Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 are
available; Level 2 is included) can be run with this device. The meter automatically
distinguishes control solution from blood and marks control solution tests with a check
mark and excludes them from average calculations. Recommendations on when to test
the control materials are provided in the labeling. An acceptable range for each control
level is printed on the test strip vial labels. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if
the control result falls outside these ranges.
P. Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In The
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Sample volume study:
The sponsor performed a sample volume study to verify the minimum sample volume
requirement for the EON L and EON LS systems using blood samples at 2 glucose
concentrations (48 and 150 mg/dL) and samples volumes ranging from 0.2 – 0.9 µL
(0.2 µL, 0.3 µL, 0.4 µL, 0.5 µL, 0.6 µL, 0.7 µL, 0.8 µL, 0.9 µL and 1.0 µL). Results
support the claimed sample volume of 0.8 µL. Validation testing demonstrated that the
sample detection feature functioned appropriately when the sample volume was <0.8uL.

2. Altitude Study:
To evaluate the effects of altitude, the Joinsson EON L blood glucose meters were
evaluated with 3 Single Strip lots and 3 Snap Strip lots tested on 6 meters using 3
whole blood samples each spiked to 3 glucose concentrations (77, 168, 285 mg/dL).
The samples were tested at 2256, 4118, 7951, 9500 and 10,745 feet above sea level.
Results obtained were compared with those obtained by YSI. The results demonstrate
acceptable bias to the reference to support the claims in the labeling that altitudes up to
10,745 feet have no significant effect on blood glucose measurements from the
Joinsoon EON L and EON LS Glucose Monitoring Systems.
3. Hematocrit Study:
The effect of different hematocrit levels on the EON L and EON LS systems was
evaluated using venous whole blood samples with hematocrit levels of 30 - 55% (30,
35, 40, 45, 50, and 55%) spiked with glucose to achieve target concentrations of 77,
167, and 286 mg/dL. Results of samples at each hematocrit level were compared to the
corresponding YSI value as well as to 40% Hct levels. Three Single and three Snap
Strip test strip lots were used in the study. The % bias of the Joinsoon EON L and EON
LS system results relative to YSI demonstrated adequate performance to support the
claimed hematocrit range of 30-55%.
4. Test System operating conditions:
Temperature and humidity operating conditions were evaluated on the EON L and
EON LS systems for temperatures ranging from 50°F-104°F and relative humidity
from 10% to 90%, including extreme combinations of temperature and humidity, e.g.
lowest humidity with lowest and highest temperature and highest humidity with lowest
and highest temperature. Protocol and acceptance criteria were provided and found to
be acceptable. The results supported the Sponsor’s claimed operating conditions of
50°F-104°F (10°C -40°C) and relative humidity range from 10% to 90%.
5. Readability Assessment:
The readability of the labeling (user guide, quick reference guide and test strip insert)
using a Flesch-Kincaid analysis were found to be written on average at the 8th grade
level.
6. EMC Testing:
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electromagnetic testing
(EMC) had been performed using IEC 60601-1-2; Medical electrical equipment- Part l-
2: General requirements for safety - Collateral standard: Electromagnetic compatibility
- Requirements and tests.

--- Page 16 ---
7. Infection Control Studies:
The device system is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy
studies were performed on the materials comprising the meter by an outside
commercial testing laboratory demonstrating complete inactivation of Hepatitis B
Surface Antigen (HBsAg) with the chosen disinfectant, Barbicide Wipes Disinfecting
Towelettes (EPA Registration # 46781-8-954). Robustness studies were also
performed by the sponsor demonstrating that there was no change in performance or
external materials of the meter after 2000 cleanings and 2000 disinfection steps with
the Barbicide Wipes Disinfecting Towelettes. The robustness studies were designed to
simulate 3 years of single-patient use. Labeling was reviewed for adequate
instructions for the validated cleaning and disinfection procedures.
Q. Proposed Labeling:
The labeling is sufficient and it satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 809.10.
R. Conclusion:
