L. Test Principle:
The Abbott RealTime CT/NG Assay is a nucleic acid based test using polymerase chain
reaction (PCR). The specimen collection swab provided with the Abbott multi-Collect
Specimen Collection Kit is used to collect a sample that is placed into a transport tube with
STB until the time of testing. Infection is detected through the use of PCR to amplify and
detect bacterial DNA. The presence of amplified CT cryptic plasmid DNA and NG genomic
DNA can be detected through a sequence-specific labeled probe that hybridizes with the
target sequence. Cleavage of the probe during PCR releases a fluorescent reporter dye from
the quencher dye and results in a signal that is used to detect the target-specific product.

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
All studies described below (except the biocompatibility and sterility testing) were conducted
using plasmid targets. The CT plasmid contained highly conserved target sequences derived
from the cryptic plasmid found in all serovars including A through K and L1 through L3. The
NG plasmid contained Opa gene target sequences which are highly conserved among all
strains of NG.
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision
An in-house precision study was performed with a four-member panel consisting of a
high CT/NG positive sample (45,000 copies and 22,000 copies per 400 µl respectively), a
high CT/low NG positive sample (45,000 copies and 640 copies per 400 µl), a low
CT/high NG positive sample (640 copies and 22,000 copies per 400µl), and a CT/NG
negative sample. Positive panel members were prepared by diluting stocks of CT or NG
plasmid into an Abbott multi-Collect Specimen Collection Kit Transport Tube with STB
followed by a Specimen Collection Swab to simulate a swab sample.
Three runs were performed per day for three days on three Abbott m2000sp/m2000rt
Systems with each run testing seven replicates of the four panel members using three lots
of swabs (3 runs per day x 3 days x 3 instruments x 4 panel members x 7 replicates per
panel member x 3 swab lots = 756 measurements per analyte). One replicate was
excluded from the analysis due to an “unrecoverable instrument error,” so the final
number of measurements considered was 755 measurements per analyte. Three
technicians participated in the reproducibility study, with each operator running a single
run each day. For the Abbott RealTime CT/NG Amplification Reagents, the Internal
Control (IC), and the Abbott mSample Preparation System reagents, one lot of each
DNA
were included in this study. Results of the precision study are summarized in the table
below.
6

--- Page 7 ---
Table 1: Overall Precision (Instrument and Swab Lots Combined)
The data presented in Table 1 demonstrates 100% detection of various concentrations of
CT and NG DNA in the three positive panel members. Although a false positive occurred
for CT in one of the replicates for the negative panel members (1/188 = 1% false positive
rate), the percent negative rate for the negative panel met the pre-determined acceptance
criteria of ≥ 95% for each analyte, indicating that precision of the new swab fiber for the
detection of CT and NG DNA with the Abbott RealTime CT/NG Assay, is acceptable.
b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
N/A
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
Freeze/Thaw Stability
The freeze/thaw stability study was conducted to confirm that the Specimen Collection
Swabs manufactured with the new swab material meet the specimen storage claim
previously cleared in K092704: Specimens should not undergo more than four
freeze/thaw cycles.
Three lots of swabs (30 replicates per lot) were placed in low positive CT and NG spiked
samples prepared in STB and stored in the Abbott multi-Collect Specimen Collection Kit
Transport Tubes. Samples contained a target concentration of 640 copies of CT and 640
copies of NG in 400 µL (approximately 2X the assay LoD). Samples underwent 5 freeze/
thaw cycles (freeze at -15 to 25°C for ≥ 90 minutes and thaw at 2-30°C for ≥ 60 minutes)
prior to testing with the Abbott RealTime CT/NG Assay. For the Abbott RealTime
CT/NG Amplification Reagents, one lot of each, the Internal Control (IC), and the Abbott
mSample Preparation System reagents were included in this study. One
DNA
m2000sp/m2000rt instrument was included. Results of the freeze/thaw study are
summarized in the table below.
7

--- Page 8 ---
Table 2: Percent of positive samples after 5 freeze/thaw cycles
The data indicates that, following five freeze/thaw cycles, the percent positive rate for CT
and NG samples at a concentration 2X the LoD was 100%. This supports the claim
previously cleared in K092704 (no more than 4 freeze/thaw cycles).
90 Day Specimen Stability
The 90 day specimen stability study was conducted to confirm that the Specimen
Collection Swabs manufactured with the new swab material meet the following specimen
storage claim previously cleared in K092704: 14 days at 2 to 30°C and 90 days at -10°C
or colder.
For the duration of the 90 day stability study, three lots of swabs were placed in high and
low CT and NG positive samples prepared in STB and stored in the Abbott multi-Collect
Specimen Collection Kit Transport Tubes. Low positive samples contained a target
concentration of 640 copies of CT and 640 copies of NG in 400 µL (approximately 2X
the assay LoD). High positive samples contained a target concentration of 2,000,000
copies of CT and 2,000,000 copies of NG in 400 µL (approximately 6250X the assay
LoD). For the Abbott RealTime CT/NG Amplification Reagents, the Internal Control
(IC), and the Abbott mSample Preparation System reagents, one lot of each were
DNA
included in this study. One m2000sp/m2000rt instrument was included.
Samples were tested at baseline, day 14, day 56, and day 105. Six replicates were tested
at each time point for each of the three lots (6 x 3 = 18 measurements per time point)
under the following conditions:

Condition 14 days at 30°C
Intermediate 56 days at -10°C or colder
Frozen
Condition
Final Frozen 105 days at -10°C or colder
Condition
Mean cycle number was compared for all storage conditions and time points tested for
CT and NG high and low positive samples. The results showed that incubation under all
conditions described above resulted in a cycle number change ≤ 1, indicating that the new
swab material does not affect the stability of CT and NG DNA collected with the swab
and stored at either 2-30°C for up to 14 days or at -10°C or colder for up to 90 days.
Real Time Specimen Stability
The real time specimen stability study was conducted to confirm that the Specimen
Collection Swabs manufactured with the new swab material meet the shelf life claims
previously cleared in K092704: Sample storage at 2-30°C for up to 14 days, sample
storage at -10°C or colder for up to 90 days, and swab shelf life of 18 months.
To confirm that the new swab material meets the shelf life claim of 18 months expiration
dating, swabs were tested at baseline (3 runs) and then again at various time points (7, 13,
18, and 19 months; 2 runs at each) after storage at one of two different conditions:
i. Ambient temperature (AT): Three lots of swabs were stored at ambient
temperature (15 to 30°C).
ii. Transport temperature extremes (TTE): One lot of swabs were stored at the
following temperatures and times to simulate potential shipping conditions: 15 to
30°C for ≥ 120 hours, followed by 30 ± 2°C for ≥ 64 hours, followed by 40 ±
2°C for ≥ 88 hours, followed by 3 cycles of 12 hours at -20 ± 5°C and 12 hours
at 5 ± 3°C, then storage at 15 to 30°C until testing.
To confirm that the new swab material meets the sample stability claims for patient
specimens (both at the beginning and end of their 18 month expiration dating), one lot of
swabs stored at either AT or TTE were tested at the following time points:
i. Storage at 2-30°C for 14 days with testing at baseline and on day 14 (1 run per
time point) followed by
ii. Storage at -10°C for 90 days with testing at day 45 and day 90 (1 run per time
point).

Swabs were placed in high and low CT and NG positive samples prepared in STB and
stored in the Abbott multi-Collect Specimen Collection Kit Transport Tube. Low positive
samples contained a target concentration of 640 copies of CT and 640 copies of NG in
400 µL (approximately 2X the assay LoD). High positive samples contained a target
concentration of 2,000,000 copies of CT and 2,000,000 copies of NG in 400 µL
(approximately 6,250X the assay LoD). For each run, 5 low positives, 5 high positives,
and 15 negative (STB only) were included per lot. For the Abbott RealTime CT/NG
Amplification Reagents, the Internal Control (IC), and the Abbott mSample Preparation
System reagents, one lot of each were included in this study. One m2000sp/m2000rt
DNA
instrument was included.
Several indicators (e.g., fractional cycle number, decision cycle, maximum ratio) were
assessed for changes to determine if a loss in sample stability had occurred. Regression
plots were generated for each stability indicator vs. time in days to determine the mean
with 95% confidence interval and action limits around the regression line (note that the
action limits used are the same action limits cleared for use in K092704).
For all time points tested for each storage condition and swab lot, the results were within
the action limits indicating that, at baseline, the new swab material does not affect the
stability of CT and NG DNA collected with the swab stored at either 2-30°C for up to 14
days or at -10°C or colder for up to 90 days. This study is on-going and will be completed
in December 2015; therefore, an accelerated stressed sample stability study was
conducted to obtain the data to support the 18 month shelf life for the new swab material.
Accelerated Stressed Swab Stability
The accelerated stressed swab stability study was conducted to confirm that the Specimen
Collection Swabs manufactured with the new swab material meet the claims for shelf life
previously cleared in K092704: swab shelf life of 18 months.
Swabs were stored at one of two conditions prior to testing:
i. Accelerated Stressed Swabs: Incubated for 16.3 weeks at 55°C (± 4°C) with a
relative humidity of 50 ± 20%. These parameters were used to simulate 2.5
years of storage on the shelf.
ii. Non-stressed swabs: Stored at ambient temperature (25 °C).
After storage at the conditions described above, swabs were placed in low positive CT
and NG spiked samples prepared in STB and stored in the Abbott multi-Collect Specimen
Collection Kit Transport Tubes. Samples contained a target concentration of 320 copies
of CT and 320 copies of NG in 400 µL (approximately 1X the assay LoD). Swabs were
tested at 14 days at -10°C, 7 days at 4°C, 4 days at 23°C, or 1 day at 40°C time points.
For each storage condition (stressed and non-stressed), three lots (with 28 samples each)
were tested for each time point.
For the Abbott RealTime CT/NG Amplification Reagents, the Internal Control (IC), and
the Abbott mSample Preparation System reagents, one lot of each were included in
DNA
10

--- Page 11 ---
this study. Two m2000sp/m2000rt instruments were included.
For all time points tested for each storage condition and swab lot, the detection rate was ≥
98%. This is comparable to the values that were cleared in K092704, therefore, this
indicates that, when the new swab material is stored at accelerated aging conditions
designed to mimic an 18 month shelf life; it does not affect the ability of the swab to
collect CT and NG DNA for detection with the Abbott RealTime CT/NG Assay.
Biocompatibility
Because the swab is a surface device that contacts the skin and mucosal membranes for a
limited duration (< 24 hours), in accordance with ISO 10993-1:2009, the following
biocompatibility studies were conducted:
· Cytotoxicity – MEM Elution (ISO 10993-5: 2009)
· Sensitization – Guinea Pig Maximization (ISO 10993-10: 2010)
· Irritation – Intracuteneous Reactivity (ISO 10993-10:2010)
· Irritation – Vaginal Mucosal Irritation (ISO 10993-10:2010)
These studies were conducted according to the protocols outlined by the International
Organization for Standardization document cited above. The results were acceptable to
demonstrate that the new swab material is non-cytotoxic, non-sensitizing, and non-
irritating.
Sterilization
Swabs are sterilized by radiation. Studies were conducted according to the following
document: ANSI/AAMI/ISO 11137-2:2006 (Corrected 21 April 2009). The results were
acceptable to demonstrate that the new swab material is sterile.
d. Detection limit:
Limit of Detection (LoD) Confirmation
For the LoD confirmation study, a stock solution was prepared containing 32,800 copies
per mL of CT and 32,800 copies per mL of NG plasmid diluted in Abbott RealTime
CT/NG Negative Control diluent. Dry swabs were placed in this stock solution where
they absorbed approximately 30 µL, resulting in a concentration of 948 copies of CT
and/or NG plasmid per swab. Next, the CT/NG positive swabs were inserted into an
Abbott multi-Collect Specimen Collection Kit Transport Tube containing 1.2 mL of STB.
The swab shaft was broken at the scored line and the collection tube was recapped and
vortexed for 10 to 30 seconds. From this sample, 400 µl of STB (containing 320 copies
of plasmid DNA) was removed from the transport tube for DNA extraction on the
m2000sp instrument. Based on the data provided by Abbott, it is estimated that 50% of
the DNA is recovered after extraction; therefore, the resulting 100 µl of sample contained
160 copies of plasmid. From this sample, 25 µl (containing 40 copies of plasmid
11

--- Page 12 ---
DNA/reaction) was removed for DNA amplification on the m2000rt instrument.
Three swab lots were used to prepare the samples co-spiked with CT and NG at a
concentration that is 1X the assay LoD. Each swab lot was tested with 26 replicates per
run over three runs (3 lots x 26 replicates x 3 runs = 234 samples). Each run included
two replicates of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG cutoff control and one replicate of a
CT/NG negative control. For the Abbott RealTime CT/NG Amplification Reagents, the
Internal Control (IC), and the Abbott mSample Preparation System reagents, one lot
DNA
of each were included in this study. One m2000sp/m2000rt instrument was included.
Results of the LoD confirmation study are summarized in the table below.
Table 3: Detection Rate Analysis for Swab LoD Study
The data shows that samples were positive at a detection rate ≥ 98%, indicating that the
new swab material does not reduce the ability of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG Assay to
detect CT and NG DNA at the LoD concentration previously cleared in K092704.
e. Analytical specificity:
N/A
f. Assay cut-off:
The assay cutoff previously cleared for the Abbott RealTime CT/NG Assay in K092704
(7.4 cycles and 4.4 cycles beyond the mean cutoff control cycle number for CT and NG,
respectively) has not been changed; therefore, no additional testing was required.
2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Based on the results of the analytical testing, the changes to the swab material do not
affect the performance of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG Assay; therefore, additional
clinical testing (beyond what was provided in K092704) is not required.
