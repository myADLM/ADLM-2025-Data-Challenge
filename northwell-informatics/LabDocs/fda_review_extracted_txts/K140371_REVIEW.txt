L. Test Principle:
The FreeStyle Precision Neo Meter (in conjunction with blood glucose test strips) utilizes
amperometric technology to quantitatively measure the glucose concentration in capillary
whole blood samples from the fingertip and in MediSense Glucose and Ketone Control
Solutions.
The FreeStyle Precision Neo Meter measures glucose electrically. The glucose biosensor is
capable of recognizing the glucose present in whole blood or control solutions by virtue of
the glucose specificity of the enzyme GDH present on the glucose test strip. The electrons
liberated by this reaction are transferred via a co-factor and mediator to the meter where they
are read as a small electrical current. The size of the current is directly proportional to the
level of the glucose in the applied sample.

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
Linearity was evaluated using 3 sets of venous blood samples each with 9 glucose
levels ranging in glucose concentrations of24, 50, 81, 128, 193, 264, 335, 413, 486
mg/dL. Each sample was tested in replicates of 10 on each of 3 strip lots. The mean
values from the FreeStyle Precision Neo Meter for each strip lot (Y) were compared
with the reference value obtained from the YSI method (X). The results from
regression analysis are summarized below:
Lot 1: y = 0.98x+6.966, R2=0.997
Lot 2: y = 0.96x+6.425, R2=0.995
Lot 3: y = 1.00x +6.682, R2=0.995
The results of the study support the sponsor’s claimed glucose measurement range of
20 to 500 mg/dL.

Real time stability was performed to support a shelf-life of 18 months at the
recommended storage condition, at a temperature ranging from 36°F-86°F (4°C to
30°C) and between 10%-90% relative humidity. The study protocol and acceptance
criteria were found acceptable. 4
Open vial stability:
NA. The strips are individually wrapped.
Control Solution:
The control solutions compatible for use with the current device (MediSense Glucose
and Ketone Control Solutions) were previously cleared and stability and value
assignment was established in k983504. The shelf life of the control solutions are 18
months at 39-86oF. Once opened, the controls are stable for 90 days at 39-86oF if
tightly closed after use.
d. Detection limit:
The reportable range for the FreeStyle Precision Neo Blood Glucose Monitoring
System is 20 to 500 mg/dL. This range was verified by the linearity study (M.1.b).
e. Analytical specificity:
29 endogenous and exogenous substances were screened for interference by spiking
high concentrations of each substance into 2 venous whole blood samples, one at low
glucose value of 50-100 mg/dL, and one at high glucose value of 250-350 mg/dL.
Each sample was tested in replicates of 10 on each of 3 strip lots. The % difference
between the spiked sample and the control sample with no substance was calculated.
The sponsor defines no significant interference as bias within ±10%.
Among the 29 substances tested, sodium and xylose exhibited interference at low
glucose concentration of 50-100 mg/dL. Dose repose studies were performed and the
upper limit for no interference was at 50 mg/dL for xylose, and 477mg/dL for
sodium.
Based on the test results, the sponsor state in the strip insert:
1) The system exhibits interference from Xylose at low glucose concentration levels.
Do not use during xylose absorption testing.
2) The system exhibits no interference from the following substances above the
concentrations shown below:

To mitigate potential confusion that users will misinterpret labeling claims of no
interference from therapeutic heparin and EDTA with the ability to use these as
anticoagulants, the FreeStyle Precision Neo Blood Glucose Test Strip labeling state
the following in the “Limitations of the Procedure” section: “This test strip is not
designed for use with arterial, venous, neonatal, serum or plasma samples and should
not be used on blood samples collected in tubes containing EDTA or heparin.”

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
To assess system accuracy, a total of 215 capillary blood samples with glucose YSI
values ranging from 29- 438 mg/dL were evaluated by the health care professionals.
Three meters and 3 lots of strips were randomly assigned during the study. To obtain
low or high end glucose values, 10 capillary blood samples were glycolyzed or
spiked. Therefore, 225 samples were available for the test.

User Performance Study:
A user performance study was performed to compare the lay user self-test results and
the YSI method. The study was performed at 2 clinical sites in the US and 165
subjects were evaluated. The study participants were provided with the User’s
Manual in English, and performed fingerstick tests on their own. A technician also
collected capillary blood from each participant for measurement on YSI after the
participant obtained and ran their sample. The range of glucose values for the finger
stick samples was 53-358 mg/dL measured by YSI. 2 test strip lots were randomly
assigned in the study.

4. Specimen Sampling and Handling:
The glucose test is intended to be used with capillary whole blood from the finger. The whole
blood sample is applied directly to the test strip by capillary action.
5. Calibration:
The meter is automatically coded. No calibration is required by the user.
6. Quality Control:
Three levels of aqueous glucose control solutions are available (sold separately) for use with
this system. No controls solution is provided with the FreeStyle Precision Neo Blood
Glucose Monitoring System.
Instructions on how to order the control solutions are included in the user manual. The meter
has a function for the user to select that they wish to run a control solution to prevent control
results from being stored in the internal memory as patient results. Recommendations on
when to test the control materials are provided in the labeling. The control solution readings
are not included in the average of the patient results when the measurements are performed in
the “control solution mode”. An acceptable range for each control level is printed on the test
strip vial label. The user is cautioned not to use the meter if the control result falls outside
these ranges.

Other Supportive Instrument Performance Characteristics Data Not Covered In the
P.
“Performance Characteristics” Section above:
1. Hematocrit Study:
The effect of different hematocrit levels was evaluated using venous whole blood
samples with hematocrit levels of 15 – 65% (15, 20, 30, 42, 50, 60, 65%) spiked with
glucose to achieve target concentrations of 40-50, 100-120, 210-230, 330-350 and 440-
460 mg/dL. Results of samples at each hematocrit level were compared to samples with
the same glucose concentration at normal (42%) hematocrit as well as to the
corresponding YSI value. The data supports the claimed hematocrit range of 15 – 65%.
2. Altitude study:
Venous whole blood samples collected from 3 blood donors were spiked with glucose
into 3 concentration levels (40-50, 100-120, and 380-420 mg/dL). The glucose meter
readings at an altitude of 10,000 feet were compared to the readings at sea level as well as
the YSI method. The results demonstrate acceptable bias to YSI to support the claims in
the labeling that altitudes up to 10,000 feet have no significant effect on blood glucose
measurements from the FreeStyle Precision Neo Blood Glucose Monitoring System.
3. Sample volume study:
The sponsor performed a study to verify the test strip sample volume requirement and the
test strip fill error requirement established for the proposed FreeStyle Precision Neo
Meter. Blood samples at glucose levels of 40-50, 100-120 and 380-420 mg/dL were
tested on the meter and compared to the YSI values at 3 sample volumes of 0.4, 0.6 and 1
μL. The results support the claimed sample volume of 1 μL and the error message, “E-
3”, is triggered and displayed on the meter when an insufficient sample is applied.
4. Temperature and humidity studies:
The sponsor performed temperature and humidity studies using venous blood samples to
evaluate temperatures ranging from 15ºC to 40ºC and relative humidity from 10% to
90%. Meter results were compared to YSI reference analyzer. Four temperature and
humidity combinations were tested including low temperature/low humidity, low
temperature/high humidity, high temperature/low humidity and high temperature/high
humidity. No significant effect (relative to YSI reference analyzer) was observed with the
temperature and humidity combinations tested. The results support the claims in the
labeling that the system can be used in conditions of 15 to 40°C with relative humidity of
10 to 90%.
5. Readability Assessment:
The readability of the labeling using a Flesch-Kincaid analysis were found to be written
at the 5.6 grade level for the user manual and 7.7 grade level for the strip insert.
During the lay user study described above in Section M.3.c, the participants were asked
to complete a questionnaire to evaluate the ease of use of the device and the clarity of the
English language labeling. Overall the users scored 5.5 out of 6 for ease of use (1,
strongly disagree; 6, strongly agree).
13

--- Page 14 ---
6. EMC Testing:
The sponsor provided documentation certifying that acceptable electromagnetic testing
(EMC) had been performed.
7. Infection Control Studies:
The device system is intended for single-patient use only. Disinfection efficacy studies
were performed on the materials comprising the meter by an outside commercial testing
