510(k) SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE DETERMINATION
DECISION SUMMARY
ASSAY ONLY TEMPLATE
A. 510(k) Number:
k140373
B. Purpose for Submission:
The cobas 8000 ISE module and the ISE Gen 2 reagents were previously cleared for serum
and plasma sample types under k100853 and urine was added as a sample type in k123726.
In this submission, the measurement of urine has been modified to (1) add a measuring range
extension below the standard measuring range (Under Range Rerun) and (2) to include a new
LHH calibration scheme (Low/High/High) in which all three standards (S1, S2 and S3) are
used for the full calibration with S3 used as a compensator. The LHH calibration scheme
applies to the standard measuring range and extended measuring range.
C. Measurand:
Sodium, potassium, and chloride
D. Type of Test:
Quantitative, indirect potentiometric measurement with ion-selective electrodes

L. Test Principle:
Sodium, potassium and chloride are measured using ion-selective electrodes utilizing an
indirect (diluted) method where urine samples are automatically diluted at 1:46 ratio
(standard range) or 1:31 (under range) using ISE diluent. Each of the electrodes (Sodium,
Potassium and Chloride) has a membrane with an open liquid junction that is ion-selective.
The reference electrode uses the same design of the ion-electrodes and it is exclusively used
as a reference for every measurement. The difference of all voltages between the reference
electrode and any ion-selective electrode is a measure for the concentration of individual
ions. For every test, the voltages of both ISE internal standard and diluted sample solution
are measured for each type of ions (Sodium, Potassium and Chloride). The measurement of

M. Performance Characteristics (if/when applicable):
1. Analytical performance:
a. Precision/Reproducibility:
Precision studies for the cobas 8000 ISE electrodes for the measurement of Na, K,
and Cl using the LHH calibration scheme were performed using one analyzer, one
site, one lot of reagent, and six samples. The six samples used for the precision
testing were comprised of four human urine sample pools (HU) of varying
concentrations (low, mid, Medical Decision Level (MDL), and high) for each analyte;
and Liquichek Level 1 and Liquichek Level 2 controls. Separate studies were
conducted for the normal (standard) assay measuring range (sample volume 10 μl)
and the automatic rerun using increased sample volume (15 μl).
The within run precision study was performed with 21 single determinations for each
analyte. The intermediate precision was performed over a period of 21 days, two runs
per day, and two aliquots per run for a total of 84 samples per analyte. The
summaries for the precision studies are presented in the tables below:

b. Linearity/assay reportable range:
The measuring range is 60-350 mmol/L for sodium and chloride in urine on the cobas
8000 ISE module (standard range). The sponsor has added an automatic rerun
function for measurement of the sodium and chloride in urine in the low range (Under
Range) of 20-59.9 mmol/L.
The Under Range rerun is triggered automatically when the initial sample result is
measured below the standard measuring range for sodium and/or chloride samples
(below 60 mmol/L). A rerun order is automatically generated by the software and a
new sample is measured using an increased sample volume of 15 μl instead of the
standard 10 μl (sample dilution ratio of 1:31 vs. 1:46, respectively) to rerun the
patient sample. The current measuring range for potassium in urine is 3-100 mmol/L
and this range is not being expanded.
Linearity studies were performed according to CLSI EP6-A for the automatic rerun
function. A dilution series of eleven concentrations was prepared using urine sample

Sodium 0.9834 1.385 18.1 to 61.8
Chloride 1.0189 -0.5900 16.5 to 60.1
Additional linearity studies were performed for the standard measuring range with
LHH calibration scheme. Linear regression summary results are presented in the table
below:

Sodium 1.0214 -2.8874 60.0 to 350.0
Potassium 1.0274 -0.031 3.0 to 110.0
Chloride 1.0024 -7.0149 60.0 to 350.0
Linearity studies using the LHH calibration scheme support the sponsor’s claimed
measuring ranges for urine samples of 60-350 mmol/L (sodium and chloride) and 3-
100 mmol/L (potassium) and the extended ranges of 20-59.9 mmol/L for sodium and
chloride.
c. Traceability, Stability, Expected values (controls, calibrators, or methods):
The ISE Calibrators ISE Standard Low (S1) and ISE Standard High (S2 and S3) are
standardized against primary calibrators prepared gravimetrically from purified salts.
The calibrators were cleared in k132418. The LHH calibration scheme is being
implemented for the cobas 8000 in this submission.
d. Detection limit:
Studies were carried out in accordance with CLSI Guidance Document EP17-A for
sodium and chloride for the automatic rerun using increased sample volume. For
determination of LoB, one analyte free sample was measured in five replicates, six
runs, three days, on two cobas 8000 ISE modules. A total of 60 measurements were
obtained per analyzer. For determination of LoD, five samples (one replicate) with
low-analyte concentration were measured in six runs for three days on two cobas
8000 ISE modules. In total 60 measurements were obtained per analyzer. For LoQ
studies, a low level sample set was prepared by diluting three human urine samples
with an analyte free diluent (ISE Diluent). The low level sample set was tested in
single replicate for three days in two runs per day on two cobas 8000 ISE modules.

LoQ is defined as the concentration where total error is less than 30%. Results from
the detection limit studies for the automatic rerun function are summarized in the
table below:
Analytes LoB LoD LoQ Claimed Measuring Range

Sodium 6.9 9.3 12.6 20.0 to 59.9
Chloride 6.3 7.4 9.8 20.0 to 59.9
For detection limit studies for potassium, the rerun function is not implemented.
Therefore, a verification of the LoQ of the cobas 8000 ISE module was conducted for
potassium. A low level sample set was prepared by diluting 3 human urine samples
with an analyte free diluent (ISE Diluent). The low level sample set was tested in
single replicate for three days in two runs per day on two cobas 8000 ISE modules.
LoQ is defined by the sponsor as the concentration where total error is less than 30%.
Results from the detection limit study are summarized in the table below:
Analyte LoQ (mmol/L) Claimed Measuring
Range (mmol/L)
Potassium 1.13 3.0 to 100.0
Additional detection limit studies were performed to demonstrate that the LoB, LoD
and LoQ for the standard range for sodium, potassium and chloride have not changed
due to the proposed new LHH calibration method. Results from the detection limit
study are summarized in the table below:
Analytes LoB LoD LoQ Claimed Measuring Range

Potassium 0.28 0.35 1.13 3.0 to 100.0
e. Analytical specificity:
Interference testing was conducted for the automatic rerun using increased sample
volume. Urine sample pools with known concentrations of each analyte were spiked
with drugs and concentrations listed below. The analyte concentrations of the spiked
aliquots were tested in triplicate and the mean of the triplicate determinations is
compared to the analyte concentration of the reference sample which contains no
drugs. The known concentration of the urine pools were 32.5 mmol/L for sodium and
27.6 mmol/L for chloride. Additionally, hemoglobin interference was tested by
spiking a human urine sample (containing sodium and chloride at 22.1 mmol/L) with
several concentrations of hemoglobin (105 to 1050 mg/dL). Conjugated bilirubin
interference was tested by spiking a human urine sample (containing sodium at 43.5
mmol/L and chloride at 45.5 mmol/L) with several concentrations of conjugated
bilirubin (1.0 to 66.0 mg/dL). Significant interference is defined by the sponsor as

mmol/L) adjusted at pH values ranging from 3.7 to 8.7. There was no significant
interference for sodium and chloride at pH range 3.7 to 8.7.
The above interference data obtained for the under range re-run function are
consistent with the interference studies performed for the standard range function for
sodium, potassium and chloride in k123726.

2. Comparison studies:
a. Method comparison with predicate device:
Sodium, potassium, and chloride values for urine samples were obtained on the cobas
8000 ISE module using the LHH calibration scheme and were compared to those
determined on the corresponding reference method and to the predicate cobas 8000
ISE with the L/H/Sc calibration scheme. The reference methods used were: Flame

Photometer IL 943 for sodium/potassium and coulometric (Chloride Analyzer 926S)
for chloride. No more than 20% of the samples were either spiked or diluted to cover
the measuring range. Samples in the normal assay range were run on the cobas
8000 ISE module using the LHH calibration method and compared to samples on
the same analyzer using the existing L/H/Sc calibration method for the cobas
8000 ISE module. In addition, samples were tested in singlicate on one cobas 8000
ISE and were compared with the cobas c501 for the automatic rerun of sodium and
chloride samples in the range of 20.0-59.9 mmol/L. The cobas c501 (k132418) was
used as a comparator for the low range for sodium and chloride in addition to the
Flame Photometer and Chloride Analyzer because it has the ability to measure in this
range (20-250 mmol/L). The results were calculated using Passing/Bablok Linear
regression. The method comparison result summary is shown in the tables below:
